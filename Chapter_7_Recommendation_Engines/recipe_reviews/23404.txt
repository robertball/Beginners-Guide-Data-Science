So delicious!  I pureed mine in the blender as I prefer smooth creamy sauces, and I added three garlic cloves as I love garlic. I used only half of the onion, and substituted 3/4 cup of skim milk instead of the heavy cream to cut back on calories. The addition of Italian seasoning added an extra zip and zing. Served over fresh cheese ravioli and with a side green salad, it was a fantastic and simple meal. If you double the recipe, you can freeze the remainder of sauce and have on hand for guests or cold nights when you crave comforting pasta dishes. A terrific recipe that I will make again.

Very good!  A winner in my book.  I substituted fat-free half and half for the cream,cut the butter a little and doubled the garlic. I also used my hand blender and smoothed it a little, so that it wasn't super chunky but still had texture.  Hubby loved it.  Served it over organic spinach fetuccini with spicy italian sausage sliced on top.  Beautiful meal!

This sauce has a great flavor to it--sweet but not cloying. I must concur with other reviewers: the consistency is a bit too thin. I suspect this could be thickened without sacrificing too much flavor by adding flour according to taste. Flour is usually an ingredient in cream sauces, but is absent from this particular recipe. Spices and tomatoes may need to be increased if flour is added, but the sauce should become satisfactorily viscous. I suggest adding flour in small quantities, being cautious not to use too much.

Incredibly good and so easy to make!  I doubled the sauce and used half and half instead of cream. The only thing I added to thicken it was a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I will make this again and again.  With recipes like this, there's no need to buy jarred sauces!

This was excellent and easy. I didn't have Italian style tomatoes so I used petite diced and added 1 tsp of Italian seasonings. I only used 1/2 of an onion, otherwise made to recipe. Delicious, served over mini penne pasta and shredded parmesan. Wish I had grilled chicken to go over top. One complaint: this really only made enough for 3 servings, no way 5 unless this was for a side dish. Thank you.

This has become my staple sauce since I first discovered it on this site.  I have made it a countless number of times now, both as per recipe for a small scale, and slightly altered for a much larger scale.  Regardless, I always use more garlic than called for and always run the whole thing through the blender to smooth the sauce.  This is absolutely delicious and always receives rave reviews.  Quick, easy, and foolproof - what more could you ask for?

WOW!  What a great sauce!  So here's what I did...like another member, after cooking tomatoes, onion, garlic and spices in saucepan, I put mixture into blender and pureed.  Then I put back into saucepan, stirred in 3/4 cup nonfat milk (in place of heavy cream) and butter.  I left out sugar altogether.  Didn't need it.  I added a small amount of grated parmesan cheese to give it an extra kick.  What I got was a sauce that tasted like it was full of fat and calories, but it was actually almost fat free and very healthy!  Not to mention, it was EXTREMELY easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!

sauteed onions, mushrooms, garlic and red pepper, then added tomatoes, brought to a boil..... Then I pureed the whole thing in blender. My family has yet to know off these added, rarely eaten (by them) veggies........I replaced fat free half-n-half for heavy whipping cream (as I do most things, too much fat & calories for us) and added fresh grated Parmaggiano cheese! The sugar is important (altho I use Splenda) to help take adge off the tomato taste. Was yummy and very creamy!

This was a great sauce for our pasta.  I didn't have any Italian diced tomatoes so I just used regular and added italian seasoning.  Also, didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I used 3/4 of a cup of whole milk and 1/3 cup of butter.  I added red pepper flakes (husband likes it hot) and a little all-purpose flour to thicken and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make again!

Ok, I have made this twice now. I still don't love it. It is sweet in a disgusting way, and the texture is weird because of the chunky tomatoes and all the dried basil. Maybe I will spring for fresh next time! I am going to make it again, and try other reviews' suggestions to put it through the blender. I added probably 1.5 T of flour, which really helped thicken it and make it a great consistency, not runny. I like the flavor but must try it with these modifications, and without the sugar...

This is extremely delicious and easy to make! I decided to add green peppers and more onion, garlic and cream than was mentioned. I also did not use the canned italian style diced tomatoes, but regular tomatoes. You can definitely change it around a bit to fit your taste. I served it over spinach fettuccine alongside fried chicken cutlets and some homemade bread. Everyone loved it! Don't use half and half instead of heavy cream. Some suggested it so I tried it and I was very disappointed!!

Super easy, Super yummy! Two thumbs up from hubby :-) The one thing I have to say is remove pan from the heat for at least 5 minutes before adding the cream. The first time I made this, I didn't take it off the heat long enough and the cream curdled when I added it.

Ok everybody don't hate me but one night when I needed something really fast I used a jar of premade sauce and added a dash of sugar, a dash of wine,  and the heavy cream! Super quick and super easy!

An excellent base sauce for pasta-especially ravioli. I like to boil my ravioli, then place it in an oven dish and smother with this sauce. Then I top it with asiago, mozzarella, panko and italian breadcrumbs and bake at 400 degrees for about half an hour. Scrumptious!

YUM! I love a good cream sauce, but hate the calories that go with them. Lightened this up considerably by using Fat-Free Sour Cream, and skipping the butter and sugar (it doesn't need the sugar). I also sauteed mushrooms to go in it...because...well...mushrooms just HAVE to go in a cream sauce!

We modified this recipe just a tad bit by first adding sausage. Then, to make the sauce more "kid friendly," we set some aside for the adults and put the rest in the blender (minus the sausage). The result was a smooth, creamy, rich sauce that was scrumptious.

My husband loved this! The first time I made it I thought it was too sweet, so the second time I added a little more salt and a little less sugar. Pureed in the blender and added shrimp and red pepper flakes.

Good recipe! Doubled sauce. Sautéed garlic, 4 cloves & diced mushrooms. Blended all seasonings & diced tomatoes in blender, then added to the skillet with sautéed items. Only used 1 tblspn butter. Used 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup soft butter & 1 tsp flour to replace heavy cream.  Added diced olives and another 1/4 salt to sauce. Also flour as needed to thicken sauce and let simmer. Serve over a light pasta and top with Parmesan cheese.

Definitely my favorite pasta recipe! If you use half and half instead of whipping cream be aware that it is a little sweet (at least the kind that I use) and so it may be best not to add sugar. My boyfriend loves this every time I make it. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  Some changes that I made- were to add chopped baby spinich and shitake mushrooms sliced thinly to the sauce prior to adding the cream.  I fry salmon in a seperate pan and break it up then add it to the sauce over penne pasta.   Absolutely amazing!

I really enjoyed making this recipe and it turned out wonderful. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used fresh Romas from my garden and also fresh basil and oregano as well as dried. I added garlic powder, onion powder, and used half and half because I didn't have any cream. WILL make again and again! Thanks!

I've been trying to duplicate the penne rosa recipe from Noodles and Company chain. This looked similar  to there ingredients and I followed the recipe exactly.It wasn't quite what I wanted but a good base for  future attempts. Next time I will puree it like several suggested and  it was lacking a little kick to me.

This was pretty good - the only change was that I used plain diced tomatoes instead of italian style since I already had those in the cupboard and I pureed the tomatoes mixture. I found it to be a bit bland so I may play around with the spices a bit next time, but it could also have been because I used plain diced tomatoes.

I made this tonight for dinner and I must say that this is one tasty dish.  I double the recipe for the sauce and added 7 cloves of garlic and 1 small sweet onion.  Also, I used (1) can of regular diced tomato and (1) can of fire roasted both were Hunts brand.  This will be added to weekly rotation for sure.., even my 11 year old picky son said it was good.

Simply delicious.  All I added was fresh spinach and cooked italian sausage.  Threw it all together with "Quick Gnocchi" from this site (a winner, too), in a casserole and baked it.  Fantabulous dinner and leftovers were wonderful, too.

Used a blender to make it a smooth sauce. Freezes well for later use!

Yum! I did use a little less basil and added parsley. I blended the sauce minus the heavy cream, then returned to the pan, added the cream and let it heat through on low until serving. We had it over whole wheat penne and it was delicious. Thanks! :)

I don't know what to say about this except for the fact that I did not care for it. It wasn't very sauce like, the spice combo was just kinda 'meh' and i didn't find it very creamy. Overall it was bland.

Awesome! I added 2 extra cloves of garlic and used about 5 fresh basil leaves and I even added a cube of frozen spinach just to get more goodness into the kids! They loved it.

Great recipe, Kimber. I used 1/4 of an onion, 2 cloves garlic, fresh basil and oregano, and added 1/2 cup tomato puree. Threw it all in the blender before returning to heat and  adding in the cream and butter... also added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Served over 4 cheese tortellini, and boy, was it ever good! Thanks.

delish!  i did do a few changes...i added veggies, mushrooms, baby bells, and kale.  i did not have heavy cream, and did not feel like going to the store; so i used about half a cup of low fat sour cream, about half a cup of 1% milk, and about two Tbs of butter.  yum, yum, YUM!  my son does not usually like red sauces, this one he did!

This was a great starting place or sauce. I followed a few other suggestion:used fat free half an half instead of cream, added extra garlic, ran it through my food processor because I prefer smoother sauce.  I also like a little kick so I added red pepper.  I also used half diced tomatoes and half tomatoe paste since i dont like chunky sauce.  This also made it thicker. MIt was a little too sweet for my tastes, so next time I'd cut that out, but overall a great base and easy to make.

I love making my own sauce now and again so this was a great recipe to mix things up. Only having whole milk on hand I used that but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. I didn't thicken it or blend it so it still had a little chunkiness to it. We served it over spaghetti which may have been too light weight of a pasta, but we paired it with sun-dried tomato chicken sausage and sprinkled fresh spinach on top with a little parmesan. Very nice but it could use a little more kick. I will try some of the other reviews' suggestions next time. Thank you!

Recipe is simple and tastes great. If you really want to take it to the next level without much effort, add sliced black olives, sliced mushrooms, and capers for authentic Italian flavor. The addition of the previous three ingredients really makes this dish taste shine. :)

My family did not care for this at all, in fact it got thrown out!  The sauting of the onions made it WAY too sweet, I even cut down on the amount of onion and sugar to start with.  The texture of the sauce was quite gross....I've had creamy tomato sauces before and LOVED them....this wasn't even close.  Will not use again.

This is a great sauce!  It's always a hit when I serve it to people.  I always blend it in the blender after it's done to smooth it out and I usually use Italian style stewed tomatoes and extra garlic cloves.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I added about half the cream to make the pasta a bit less 'saucy' and added mushrooms and chicken.  Its great if you are looking for a simple tasty meal

Excellent sauce!! I put it in the blender before pouring over pasta - since I'm not a big tomato fan, that really improved the texture & whole experience for me.  Highly recommended!

This recipe gets 4 stars because it is a little bland as is.  It is a great starting place.  I sauted hamburger meat in the olive oil, onion and (2 cloves) garlic.  Then added addional 1 tsp italian seasoning. I also used brown sugar per another review, and half & half bc that is what I had.  It will be watery at first.  Let the juices simmer off before you add the dairy. It will thicken on its own.

My husband said that it tasted like it was from a restaurant....so we'll take that as a good thing. Very easy to make, but turned out a little soupy. I guess next time I'll have to let the liquid reduce longer. I also left out the onions because I didn't have any...I don't think it lacked any flavor without them...as a matter of fact, I don't think that I would have liked it with the onions.

Pure goodness and simplicity. This sauce came out beautifully Exactly as it was written, with the one exception that I blended it---which is really a matter of personal preference: chunky or smooth. 
I served my tomato cream over slightly baked hot Italian sausage pieces which I quickly caramelized in a hot pan (we like the crispy edges). Turning down the heat, I added big chunks of green, red, yellow and jalapeno peppers. When the vegetables were cooked to just under crisp, I added the sauce and let everything simmer together for a few minutes. My husband and I cleaned our plates, and there is None of this left in the fridge---all the leftovers were quickly snatched up! This was a winner for my household.

After making this many times now, I pretty much have this recipe memorized. I generally use the fire-roasted canned tomatoes and add  spices to taste, such as omitting the  oregano and adding garlic. Like many reviewers, I've subbed half & half for the heavy cream with success. Sometimes I use the immersion blender; sometimes I want a chunkier sauce. This compliments virtually any pasta, although my favorite use for this sauce is for my stuffed bell peppers, which happens to be dinner tonight. Overall, this sauce is fast, simple, and delicious....a winning trifecta!

Pretty good! I added sauteed mushrooms and a bit more garlic, salt, and sugar. I also pureed it.

Next time I'll puree a little less (it wasn't chunky enough), use FRESH herbs, add more veggies (spinach?) and maybe add a bit more cream and/or parmesan cheese. Maybe pureeing in a little cottage cheese would be good:)

Overall, great tomato sauce recipe! I suggest doubling it and freezing the left overs.

This sauce is amazing. I used half and half cream instead of the heavy cream and it turned out GREAT!! My husband looked in the pan while I was making it and wasn't too keen on the appearance, once it was on the table in the pasta, well lets just say he ATE HIS WORDS !!

I really liked this recipe. I made it with beef stuffed ravioli. The only thing I did differently was using the food processor to make it a smooth sauce, as others suggested and added a bit of flour to thicken in up. I can't wait to try it with other kinds of pasta. It was a really easy dish to make with ingredients I always have on hand.

Hard to believe a sauce this good is so easy.  Great flavor.  I did add a little anchovy paste and a few flakes of red pepper. I use Stevia instead of sugar. But the recipe needs no changes.  Love it over small penne pasta.  I think the consistency is perfect when made with cream.  This makes for a heavenly vegetarian meal.

Wow what an easy sauce... i was stumped tonight on what to make and had some chicken raviloli to cook so i pulled this up and made it with what i had... i used 1/2 and 1/2 as i NEVER use heavy cream cus of the calories and I think 1/2 and 1/2 has the same amount of creaminess without all the fat... this was such the perfect last minute dish and the whole family including my picky 12 YO liked this... that deserves a 5* in my book!

LOVE this sauce. I made this cream sauce tonight, except I used 1 cup of Half & Half in place of the Heavy Cream then I pureed it in a blender and added another .5 cup of Half & Half brought it to a soft boil and served over Gnocchi. OUTSTANDING!!!

This was super easy to make and has a good flavor but we did not just love it.   I followed the recipe as indicated and served it over penne rigate pasta.  We only got 4 servings out of it instead of the indicated 5 servings but it is likely that we used more than what a real serving actually should be. I wonder if it were to simmer a while if the flavors would be richer.

I used an immersion blender for mine because I was looking for a smooth sauce. It kind of had a weird consistency when done cooking, almost like the cream broke in the sauce and looked curdled.  I wish I had let the tomato mixture simmer for longer and then added the cream at the very end.  But the taste was faaaaantastic.  I served it over cheese tortellini, and will make it again.

This was delicious! And it was really quick and easy, plus I made it healthier with a few adjustments.   I threw some spinach in after browning the garlic, cooked it for a minute before adding the rest. I also substituted a 10 oz can of tomato sauce (with basil and oregano and garlic) and a 4 oz can of tomato paste for the diced tomatos, since I too like a smoother sauce. I also substituted 1/4 cup fat free milk and 1/4 margarine for the whipping cream and butter.   It was amazing! Not too watery, not too sweet.

My boyfriend actually found this recipe one night we he cooked to surprise me.  This sauce has a lot of flavor is great with ravioli or any pasta you can think of.  I am thinking about trying to couple with pork in a chicken parmesan style dish. We shall see... This recipe has become a staple in our house!

We tried this recipe and absolutely love it!!  We used a little milk to balance out the cream, which lightened it up a bit. It has become a family favorite!

This is a great base for an amazing sauce. I made my own changes such as using twice as much garlic, adding celery with the garlic and onions, as well as adding some red wine and beer into the red sauce. Once I felt it cooked down I used my hand blender to smooth it out then added the butter and half and half instead of heavy cream. To finsih it off I added shavings of parmigiano reggiano. This recipe is a keeper!

This is an awesome recipe.  I puréed in a blender as recommended by others to have a smoother consistency.  I did this just before adding the cream.  I used fat free half and half and it worked great.  I also upped the garlic.

This was really easy and so cheap to make!  One recipe makes enough for 8 oz dry pasta, double it for a whole lb.  Like others, I pureed my sauce to make it smooth, but is also really good "chunky". I used half and half instead of cream (because that's what I had).  This sauce is also awesome as a base for a baked ziti - just sub ricotta for the cream, top with cheese and bake!  Here's a tip:  if you want to skip the pureeing step but like a smooth sauce, start out with a can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced.

this was easy and fabulous!  best of all i got to use my fresh basil and oregano that i have been growing.  i used 2% evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream, blended it with an immersion blender and added a touch of cornstarch to thicken it up.  super delish.

This sauce was amazing! I don't know if I will ever buy store-bought sauce again. The sauce is even great before adding the cream.  I basically doubled everything but instead of using a second can of diced tomatoes, I used a can of tomato sauce, and I also added a generous splash of red cooking wine.

This was a quick and tasty pasta sauce.  The heavy cream add a nice change from regular red sauce.  I topped this with parmesan cheese and leftover sliced grilled sausage.

Yum!  My husband and I were pleasantly suprised with this.  Tried it for the first time tonight and followed the directions for everything except the butter- omitted it, and the cream- used 2% milk instead.  A terrific and deilicious alternative to jar sauce- easy too!

Easy and delicious! I sauteed the onion and added crushed jarred garlic for the last minute. I didn't have Italian tomatoes on hand so I used petite regular (no-salt) tomatoes and added extra spices. Had a few tomatoes that were on the way out, so I chopped and added those also. Per a review I read, I transferred the mixture in a couple of batches to my mini-processor, and then added back to the pot. Also added a few tblsps tomato paste, a little white wine and about a tblsp of grated parmesan cheese. I subbed regular half-&-half for the heavy cream but fat-free would have been healthier! Look forward to having over pasta or ravioli! Seems better than store-bought sauce. Thanks Kimber!

This is a winner.  Such an easy and rich sauce to make.  I loved the addition of cream; in my opinion it really takes it up a notch in flavour -- but I could imagine making it without the cream to save calories and fat. It would still taste good.  I added mini-fillets of chicken breast, sugar snap peas and mushrooms.  I used a roux of about 2T butter/2T flour so that it would be thick.  Shrimp would be good too. We used linguine pasta.  It's an easy recipe that tastes as though you worked for hours. It also is easy to adapt to your family's tastes.  We will make it again and again.

This is a nice sauce that I served over Trader Joes ravioli.  I had some FF half and half that I needed to use up, so I substituted that for the heavy cream. I also sauteed two links of sliced tomato mozzarella basil chicken sausage, and added it to the sauce. I was quite satisfied with this recipe.

HE liked it a lot, I didn't.  Too soupy, needed more garlic, I sub'd  fat free half & half for the cream, and added some grated parm.  Not bad, not great, I don't think tweaking would help this much more, but thanks anyway.

This was a nice sauce.  I used half-and-half, adding it to the blender while I pureed the other ingredients.  This made a smoother sauce than the original recipe.  Note:  If you like generous portions of sauce on your pasta, this actually serves about 3-4.

So simple and absolutely delicious! We have an over abundance of tomatoes in the garden so I added some fresh tomatoes to the 14.5 oz of canned.  I used the light heavy cream which made no difference in the rich taste and also added some shrimp.  It made a perfect meal for my husband and I.  It was so good that I think I would serve it to company!  Karen S.      Melville, NY

There are only two of us, but I made this sauce for 6 servings (since a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes makes that amount) knowing if it was a good as the reviews that there'd be enough for use later in the week.  (Use the serving size calculator - very helpful)  Purchased chicken/cheese ravioli for use with this sauce and it was awesome...  Two nights later,  I gently reheated the sauce in the microwave, adding small amounts of leftover Heavy Cream to adjust refrigerated consistency.  This time paired with Ziti pasta.  (Raves were Equal to meal prepared earlier in the week from the Mrs..)  Next will try Linguine and perhaps add sliced mushrooms during the onion/garlic sautéing stage.  As my wife is a great fan of sauces that use tomatoes, she absolutely loved it and has asked for frequent inclusion in menu rotation.    BTW - with this sauce prepared ahead of time: Second meal prep time took 10 mins to boil the Ziti, you cannot beat that for a restaurant quality meal made at home.

I made this week with fresh tomatoes from our garden and loved it! Instead of pasta, I used it on Eggplant Rollups. (Filled with ricotta, parmesan and spices, I am low carbing) Wonderful sauce!

This was a good recipe. I didnt have everything on the list, so I used 5 fresh tomatos instead of canned, 2% milk instead of cream, an extra tsp. garlic, and double the salt and pepper. I also added 1/2 a tsp. of corn starch for a better thickness. I put this sauce on ravioli and topped with fresh basil and parmesan cheese. Easy and delicious. Tastes best hot!!:)

Didn't have heavy cream but I did have reduced fat cream cheese.  Used 2 OZ cut into small slices and melted it in. Didn't have Italian style diced tomatoes so used regular diced tomatoes and added 2 T. fresh basil and 2 T. fresh oregano.  Added one more clove of garlic and just a pinch of sugar, left out the butter.  Followed other reviews and used my stick blender to smooth it out.  Sprinkled fresh parsley and Parmesan on top.  Absolutely delicious!

Delicious and fresh taste! I'm serving it with gnocchi. I pureed all the ingredients in the blender and cooked for a few minutes until the garlic and onion were no longer raw.

I did like the flavor of the sauce, but the consistency of the sauce wasn't quite what I expected.  I tried the sauce with penne rigate pasta, but the sauce wouldn't stick to the paste.  I also tried the sauce with angel hair pasta and that tasted much better.  I will make this pasta again because the sauce doesn't taste like other sauces that I have tired. It will add variety.

Just made this sauce and it's soooo yummy! I pretty much followed the recipe as is and it turned out really good. I only had thick cream in my cupboard, so I only used about 1/4 c of that. I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of one, increased the oregano (because I LOVE oregano in Italian dishes) and blended everything together. The sauce is so much better than the jarred sauces I usually buy and it's actually cheaper as well. This will be my go-to pasta sauce from now on :) Thanks for posting such an easy but delicious recipe!

*Update 05/14: Just used this for a lasagna, and it was even better! I omitted the butter this time and used 1/2 & 1/2.

This just looked too easy to be any good but I had all the ingredients on hand so I gave it a whirl. I doubled the recipe, added a 6 oz can of tomato paste to thicken and subbed half and half for the cream  but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It started smelling amazing right away and only got better as it simmered. I doubt I will buy store sauce anymore. Thanks so much Kimber!!!

I'm going to try it. But I'll use Philadelphia cream cheese instead of cream and leave out the butter. The cream cheese gives it that "Bolognese" rich taste (and it would be thicker as comments indicated was preferred).

I don't add sugar because the tomatoes have their own natural sweetness. Also use fat free half and half to cut down on calories.  This is really great with bacon added!  Cook 1/2 lb of bacon drain and throw in just prior to tossing over pasta or chicken, veggies, fish.
It's a winner!

I used fresh basil and blended the finished sauce. Then I tossed it with bowtie pasta, and mushrooms, grilled chicken, and sun-dried tomatoes sauteed in olive oil/white wine. Topped it all with shredded Parmesan and more fresh minced basil. I am keeping this recipe. It was visually appealing and yummy enough to serve to company but quick and easy enough for a Sunday evening at home.

This sauce is fantastic...with some modifications.  First, I just use regular canned tomatoes, not the italian style.  I am not a huge fan of dried basil, so I use fresh basil that I grow on my deck.  I also took the suggestion of other viewers and blend up the sauce so it's not so chunky.  I also use half and half instead of heavy cream because that's what I usually have on hand and I omit the butter altogether.  I usually serve this over mini cheese ravioli with garlic bread on the side.  It really is a fantastic meal that I can throw together in minutes.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Thought this was the base for a very good sauce. I used tomato sauce instead of tomatoes since all the reviews stated that the chunks were gross. Omitted the sugar and oregano, I think the basil added enough sweetness.  I also added 2 small cooked diced chicken breasts and 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper although more could have been added. I poured it over rigatoni. Delicious! I know I altered the recipe quite a bit, but it's a good starting point to an even better sauce. I also think a few tablespoons vodka (making a vodka sauce) would be delicious! And use fat free half and half or regular whipping cream, heavy cream has way too much fat.

This was a home run for both my husband and myself.  My only addition to the recipe was some sauted mushrooms, which I made ahead of time, then set aside, while I prepared the sauce as directed.   Add the mushrooms just before serving. This will become a favorite sauce for us but, next time I plan on doubling the portion to have an extra portion to freeze.

Reduced fat/sodium version:  This weekend I made a healthier variant of this sauce by doubling the diced tomatoes (28oz), adding crushed red pepper, dropping the added salt and sugar, and substituting light cream in place of heavy, and margarine for butter.  I served this with a pound of ground beef (browned) and a multigrain pasta, which made three hefty servings (I eat a lot, most people could probably divide into 4).  This is now one of my favorite and easiest recipes.  

Next time I might serve with hot turkey sausage, and maybe red onion instead of regular.  As for the red pepper, I did not measure, but am used to how much I like in my food.  I would suggest that if you are not used to using it, start small and work your way up.

Pretty good.  I made more sauce, both bc I had an extra tomato to use up (I used three large beefsteak tomatoes--which is equal to about 1 1/2 cans worth) and bc I really didn't think this would make enough otherwise.  It did, though--I had enough to top three more servings of pasta, so I guess I'd have been fine.  This is incredibly easy to make, and I used greek yogurt instead of the heavy cream:  don't have any heavy cream and I get sick when there's too heavy of milk products, so it works better for me anyway.  I did puree this a bit, but I cooked in a skillet--should've cooked in a pot since it was hard to puree with the immersion blender. I left out the sugar--I know some people think it makes tomato sauce less "harsh"; I just think it makes tomato sauce disgustingly sweet, so I always leave it out, which works better for us.  Hubs thought this was just okay--I guess he's not interested in a creamy tomato sauce and would prefer alfredo or tomato sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of the dried herbs is too strong, and it needs more salt (I used fresh tomatoes) and for the sauce to be completely pureed.  I doubled the recipe to have enough sauce for 3/4 of a box of penne (but used just 1 onion, 4 medium-sized fresh tomatoes, 1 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, 1 T basil.  Everything else doubled.)

Used this recipe as a base for a tomato and italian sausage cream sauce. Altered this by (1) using fresh roma tomatoes, (2) mixing italian sausageinto the onion/garlic mix, (3) adding chicken broth, and (4) adding 2 T tomato paste. Oh, and also sprinkled in some red pepper flakes. Delicious!

Very good and have been making something similar for many yrs.  Do not use Italian style tomatoes because we find them sweet - just add extra Italian herbs.  Also we do not blend it and at the end throw in some halved black olives.  They really give it some zing......

My boyfriend and I loved this sauce! I didn't do the onions and garlic because we're not a fan of those flavors. I also put the tomato mixture in the food processor because I don't like chunky sauces. Thinking about adding mushrooms or other vegetables next time before I process it!

Great sauce. I halved to use up leftover angel hair pasta.  I used fat free milk instead of heavy cream, 3 garlic cloves (if I did whole recipe I would have used 6 garlic cloves). I only had petite diced tomatoes so added in 1 tsp of italian seasoning, still using other seasoning as well. Like other reviewers I pureed the sauce then put back in pan with handful of mushrooms and then tossed in the left over pasta. I don't think we could ever go back to jar sauce.  So tasty and so easy to make.

Simple and wonderful recipe. I suggest using 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. This recipe can also be modified to make a delicious vodka sauce: add half a cup of smoked mozzarella as you simmer the sauce, and add a shot of vodka.

This is only the second homemade tomato sauce I have tried to make... it was amazing! Fiance isn't a fan of a lot of tomato and sometimes the texture but he loved it! The only change I made was after everything was cooked I pureed the sauce so it was a thicker, smoother sauce rather than chunky - definitely will be making this again!! (It's fabulous with Meatball Nirvana and we made them with Turkey this time)

It was excellent, I added about 1 tsp of crushed red chili peppers to spice it up a bit.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I added an 8oz. frozen spinach to the mix and I liked the color and taste balance.

This is my "go to" for potlucks or big parties.  Easy, quick, cheap.  I serve over rigatoni and usually double the recipe and use 2 lbs of pasta.  I use my immersion blender to make the sauce smooth and creamy.  I also add parm after blending.  Once I added mushrooms after blending the sauce and it added a nice texture and flavor, but the original recipe is fantastic too.  Always a big hit, served with caser salad and garlic bread.  YUM!

This was a great pasta sauce for everyday dinners.  We made it with fat free half and half to cut calories, as well as, add a sprinkle of Wondra quick mixing flour while simmering to thicken it.  We were pleased with the flavor.  Also, it reheated great the next day for lunch!

Excellent. Simple and not too many calories! Although you would probably need to double the recipe to get 5 servings. Loved it. May have needed more salt though.

Delicious, easy! I made it with skim milk for lower fat and b/c I had no cream (probably not as luxurious, but still very tasty) and put it through the blender to make it a bit smoother (when using the milk). Wish the recipe made more for freezing, but I bet you can double (or triple) it.

This was so delicious and very easy to make! I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. I served this amazing sauce over fusilli pasta and served some parmesan roasted asparagus on side. I left out the sugar and pureed the tomatos in a food processer to make a smoother sauce. Next time I make this I am going to make a double recipe. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

OK tasting, served over cheese ravioli.  I melted the butter, whisked in 1 TBLS flour, and 1/2 cup milk instead of using cream because I didn't have any. THen I stirred that into the tomato mixture.

If you like oniony sauces, great.  If not, half an averagely large onion will do.  Was very tasty on penne.

I made the recipe as written but only had half and half so I used that. With that said I should have added some flour or some thickening agent because it was pooling on the plate. I also would half the basil, too basily and I love basil. Otherwise loved the sauce, will make it again with modifications.

OMG, I just had this tonight and could not stop getting seconds! DELICIOUS! This was my 1st time making 'pink sauce' and I am very health conscious so I made some heart-healthy changes. I used 3/4 cup nonfat milk instead of 1/2 cup heavy cream (I never use heavy cream for anything), only 1 tab olive oil instead of 2, omitted the sugar and salt (as the can of diced tomatoes had enough sodium), and added a whole bag of fresh organic spinach. I served the sauce over fresh butternut squash ricotta ravioli. I think it's my new favorite dish!!! Will be making this as often as possible!

Made this just the other night and wanted to make sure I rated this.  (I tend to forget a lot with the recipes on here that I make) But I loved the simpleness of this.  My kids looked at the sauce and were like, "eww that looks gross", for whatever reason IDK, but once I told them they had to try it they actually scarfed it all up.  At the end of dinner they actually ate every piece of noodle and asked if I would make it again.  I was impressed for such an easy (and cheap) dinner.   I have to admit I did stear away from 1 thing that the recipe calls for which I usually dont do, but I felt that after the holidays I like most Americans packed on 5 lbs and need to cut a few calories from my diet.  So instead of the heavy cream I opted for milk saving myself about 200 calories overall in the dish.  I like to think a pinch here and a pinch there goes a long way!

Not sure what I did wrong but this wasn't my favorite. I skipped the onions and oregano, but I don't think the sauce made enough for the amount of pasta I made. I only made about 2 cups so I would have enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow and it there wasn't enough sauce. It tasted ok but I wish I had taken enough time to puree the tomatoes, I think that might help.

Very good and very easy. I simmered it until almost all of the juices were gone, then used my hand blender to make it smoother before adding the cream. This made the texture perfect- creamy, not runny as some others reviewers mentioned.

This was good.  I stuck to the recipe with these changes ... I browned 1 lb hamburger (my family won't eat vegetarian), added more garlic, and a 15 oz sauce.  Smashed the tomatoes with my potatoe masher (kids don't like large chunks).  Oh.  I also used 1/2 of an onion.  Served with garlic bread.  Not WOW, but a very good, quick and easy meal.

So good! I used about 1 TBL minced dried onions instead of 1 whole fresh onion.  I added one more can of diced tomatoes (which I pureed), 1 TBL Italian seasoning and a tiny bit more salt.  Left the amount of cream the same - delicious!

First off, I loved how easy this was to prepare. I had all of the ingredients on hand so it was a cheap recipe as well. The only change I made was substituting the heavy cream for fat free half and half to cut the calorie/fat content down.   My boyfriend and I both were knocked away at how wonderful this came out! We served it over gnocchi and the flavors were excellent. I felt like we were eating a gourmet dinner at home.   This one will definitely be made again!

Stunning presentation...Amazing Flavor!! Who would have thought a little addition of cream could make something go from "good" to "heavenly"!  I followed the recipe except I used fresh herbs and added mushroom and spinach to the finished product. I did not blend it like so many others as I thought it took away from the presentation. I will not change a thing WHEN I make it again. Buon!!

Made this tonight & loved it!  Per other reviews, I doubled the recipe.  Other than that, I only made a few changes...doubled the garlic, added a little flour to thicken it up & blended some of it.  Fantastic!  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is a favorite recipe. I use half the onion, and no sugar, and I add about 1/2 tblsp. of red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also top this with feta cheese at the end and serve with breaded chicken.

THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!  I LOVE making pasta sauces with my homemade pasta (thanks, Kitchen aid attachment :)  and was looking for a vegetarian version to try.  Well, this beats all of the recipes with meat that I've ever tried too!  It is so rich, so creamy, so delectable.  East to make.  And my husband loved it too.

Amazing sauce! I now add chopped zucchini, squash, red pepper, sometimes asparagus! I've used all sorts of veggies to create a "no-meat" dish that is hearty and healthy. Also, I am a college student and this meal is perfect for any budget!

Great recipe! My family loved it. I added some grated carrots, and increased the sugar to 1 tbls. I didn't add the butter because to my surprise I didn't have any but it still tasted great. Higly recommend this sauce. Thanks.

I made this for my family the other night.  It will go in my Company's coming file.  It was fantastic!  I put it in the processor so there were no chunks.  Added a pound of shrimp and served it over tortallini. Fantastic and quick.  Easy to make on a weeknight.

What a great, quick and simple sauce to jazz up some plain pasta. The only thing I might do differently next time is add a splash or two of white wine. This is a definite keeper. Thanks so much Kimber.

Excellent! I reduced the basil and it was still strong basil flavor - so unless you love love love basil, I would suggest cutting the basil down by 1/2 or 1/3. Otherwise - very good sauce!

I was looking for a new fresh tomato cream sauce to make for my penne pasta; I liked this one.  It does use a lot of heavy cream though; I would suggest cutting the cream in half and thinning it out with 2% milk, if possible (kinda heavy on the tummy).  It was a pleasant tasting sauce; I will make again with that one suggestion; husband liked it a lot!

This is so good. I felt like this should have some meat in it to bring it together. So I tenderized/flattened two chicken breasts, dipped them in lemon juice, then sprinkled them w/ garlic salt and ground pepper. I then grilled them on a cast iron griddle and added the chicken to the sauce once it was finished. I served the sauce over linguine. I will definately make this again. My 7yr old asked for seconds!

So simple to make, and so delicious to taste. Not messy, hardly takes time to make, and the results are absolutely yummy. I used regular tomatoes instead of the canned ones,and added a bit of cheese, just for the taste. Me, my dad and my brother absolutely loved it. However, although i made it according to the quantity for 5 servings, it was a little less for the 3 of us, so the next time i'll be increasing the quantity. Overall, an outright winner.

This is a really tasty recipe.  Since it really only makes 3 servings, I added about 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 cup of regular canned pasta sauce to help increase it to 4 small servings.  Also, to make it thicker just simmer it uncovered until it is a thick as you want it.  Stir often.

My family loved this recipe.  I put the sauce in the blender, as mentioned by others and it was creamy and delicious.  I also added more garlic, as my family loves garlic.  I have also tried making this recipe with southwestern seasoning, southwestern canned tomatoes and a little cayenne.  It was so good my son wanted me to teach him how to make it!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The taste was good, but I didn't care for the consistancy.  I think others were right when they say the tomatoes need pureed.  Also, it is a bit bland, so next time I would add more garlic or italian herbs.  My husband hates any meal that doesn't have meat in it, so I added a shredded chicken breast, and that made it hartier.  Also we used cheese filled tortilleni as the pasta.

Ok, didnt really turn out like I wanted, had this at a restaurant and it was a lot better, this was maybe too chunky and not smooth and sweet enough?

It was a great starting point for me, I'd never made my own tomato sauce before, but I had some fresh tomatoes to use up!  I chopped three medium tomatoes instead of the canned ones, and used fresh basil instead of dried.  It was delicious, but for consistency with fresh tomatoes I really should have pureed at least part of it to give it more 'saucyness'.

Pretty delicious. I used fresh tomatoes instead of the canned. I used penne pasta and threw it in a dish, layered on some mozzarella and baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and it was awesome. Highly recommend trying it!

I had two differant kinds of pasta i needed to use and some canned tomatoes. I came here as always.Glad i did!! I Fallowed the recipe to a "T" And it is sooo yummy!! Super simple,tasty and budget friendly.The best part my kids loved this and i do mean love it!!Thnx much will be making again and again.Next time i will throw in some zucchini & maybe spinach.This is so versatile and if u find it a little bland just up the herbs,ect according to your taste.Oh i did top mine with some shredded provolone that needed to be used up.Great Saturday lunch  or a quick week night dinner served with salad and some garlic roll's!! Yummy!!   *Side note* If you  do not have the cream no worries!!This sauce taste really good even before you put the cream and butter in.*UPDATE* I just finished making this again for lunch.This time i did throw in some chopped fresh spinach, grated carrot & Zuchini..Yum!! My kid's gobbled it right up and didnt even notice that the veggies were in there :))

Loaded with flavor and easy-breezy to whip up! I gave this a 4 because if followed as written its texture is a bit too chunky/not pasta coating friendly as a sauce. Next time I will blend as others suggested. I used 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 and 1/2 vs. cream and served over italian gnochi with garlic toast and a ceasar salad, great color and taste combo.

This is a very adaptable recipe, which I like: I didn't have any onion, so I amped the flavor with extra garlic (three cloves), which I sauteed before adding one can of regular, no added salt, diced tomatoes.  For seasoning I added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.  Instead of heavy creaming, I used half-and-half, since that's what I had on hand.  The sauce was a little thin, but very delicious!  I look forward to making it with the cream next time, but the seasonings were just right for us.  I served it with whole wheat cheese ravioli, with Italian cut green beans on the side.  Yum!

This was really delicious, but it needed a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook to really let the flavors blend and mellow. I usually let my tomato sauces simmer for a minimum of 30 minutes, preferably more.

I thought the flavor of this was very good.  I also blended it slightly to make the texture smoother.  If you are trying to make this less fattening - DO NOT substitute fat free half and half!  As soon as I added it to the sauce it separated and formed a solid, making the whole sauce really grainy.

Wow! my family loved this, I added a green and yellow pepper and served it with a breaded chicken patti and penne pasta topped with mozarella cheese.  I did double this since I have a large family.  I did use milk and 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch because I didn't have heavy cream.  I also used regular diced tomatoes since that is all i had on hand.  But it was great.

This is a winner!  So easy and yummy!  I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used fresh grape tomatoes instead (their skins aren't tough like cherry tomatoes). I squashed them a bit once they were in the pan and then let them melt down while the sauce simmered.  It worked really well! I also didn't have heavy cream so I once again used what I had; some skim milk and a tablespoon of sour cream.  The sour cream added some nice tang.  I also added some dried italian seasoning and doubled the fresh garlic.  A few fresh basil leaves on top finished this off nicely.  Will make this again!  Thanks!

This is a fantastic and simple dish.  I'll be doing this again--often!  I used half-and-half, because that's what I had on hand.  It would definitely be a little bit better with heavy cream.  It needs the richness.

It was a good sauce! My variation subed the heavy cream for a can of cream of mushroom soup with about a half cup of milk because I didn't have the cream on-hand. I also added a can of mushrooms and fresh parsley, which really made a good, thick sauce. Then, I used it for the Chicken Parmigiana, found on the twenty for twenty list, which is served also tossed with whole grain linguine. It was awesome!

My husband and I both really like this sauce. It had a lot of flavor and wasn't bland at all. I was expecting a little bit more of a creamy sauce but this one was very good, just tomato-dominated. I also used my stick blender in the pot and made it almost completly smooth with just a little texture.

I made this for dinner last night after getting home from work, was looking for something quick and tasty and found this whilst at work. I used fresh tomatoes as I had them in the fridge with a little passata. Everything else I did the same just cut the recipe down a bit for 2 people. I didn't measure just added what felt right. This was lovely, fresh and tasty and made the house smell like I'd been cooking for hours it was gorgeous! And there were no complaints about a tomato cream sauce "I don't like tomato sauces" could have fooled me the plate was spotless nothing left at all. 30 min after walking in the door this was on the plates and shortly after it was gone. Will definately be making this one again. Thank you.

This was really good. However, the onion confused me.  It seemed like there was a lot of onion, and it made the sauce chunkier than I think cream sauces should be.  But then again, I'm really an amateur, so maybe I did something wrong? I mean...it's not like onions liquefy when you boil them in the sauce, right? Maybe I should try blending the whole thing before putting in the cream next time.  But it was really good.  Now I have way too much because there's just one of me! I used three cloves of garlic and put in a little bit of tarragon, and had it over gnocchi, which is basically the best pasta EVER.  It was very good. I might add a little chili oil next time.

My husband made this last night and served on spinach ravioli.  It was a real treat.  It was extremely easy and tasted like it came from a fine Italian restaurant.  If you want to impress someone, do not hesitate to try this.

My husband likes white sauce, I prefer red. This is a perfect sauce for both of us to enjoy. I like to add sauteed mushrooms & green peppers and serve over spinach fettuccine. This recipe is a regular.

This was easy and delicious!  It was a tad bit sweet, so I think I'll leave out the sugar next time.  I also used fresh oregano and basil.  (I added the basil at the very end.)  I smoothed it slightly with an immersion blender.  My husband thought it was awesome. 

Thanks!

This was great. It is tomato season so I just used oven roasted roma-style tomatos from the garden. I omitted the sugar - not a big fan of sweet sauces and pureed it with an immersion blender. Turned out great.

This sauce was so delicious, my family went crazy when I made it for them. I served it on top of angel hair pasta, with a romaine lettuce/apple/pecan salad and french bread. Since we like a lot of sauce with our pasta, I doubled the recipe. However, I cut the onion down to only half of one instead of two as the doubled recipe calls for (my sister doesn't really care for onion...so I cut it down to make her eat it). Overall, this was a fabulous sauce. I will definitely make it again.

Good taste but way too much onion for my families taste.  It was a little overwhelming.  If I make again, I would cut it down by half.  Thanks

This recipe was easy to follow.  Like a few others, I chose to puree the sauce in the blender as I prefer a smoother sauce.  Once this done I then added the cream and butter.  I tasted the sauce while making it and it was delicious.  I served this sauce over cheese ravioli along with roasted garlic bread also found in allrecipes.  I enjoyed eating the sauce the following day and found the the blend of spices set in overnight.   My family loved this recipe and it will definitely remain in our household.

This is delicious as is!  Not to mention easy.  Just the right balance of cream and tomato.  When you are boiling it leave the lid off so that the sauce evaporates.  Bon appetit.

This sauce was just what I was looking for!  I served it over a homemade ravioli and it turned out great.  However I definitely agree with some others that the recipe should be doubled, I barely had enough.  Its better to have a little bit extra anyway and you can always freeze it.  I basically followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the dried basil.  I added lots of fresh basil instead, which I chopped up and added in towards the end.  I also garnished the dish with some basil and it looked wonderful.

I love this recipe, it is so quick and easy.  It has become a family favorite.  Only thing I do different is use half and half instead of the heavy cream, it always turns out great.

My husband and I loved this sauce. It was very easy and very tasty.  The only changes I made was to use fat free evaporated milk instead of cream and to put the sauce in the blender briefly to smooth out the tomato chunks. Neither of us missed the fat of the cream. Thanks so much for a great recipe!
eta: made this again for a spaghetti potluck and added cayenne pepper to taste. Very popular!

I think the chunky texture of this is what turned me off a little.  Usually I like chunky, but I don't think chunky goes with cream sauces.  I would have enjoyed it more if I had used just tomato sauce, I think, and simmered it longer with more herbs.  I used fresh basil in this which improved it.

Changes: 2 cloves of garlic, 1½ cups diced tomatoes and ¾ tsp Italian seasoning instead of canned Italian style tomatoes, ¾ cup cream. 
I ended up burning my garlic and onions and it still turned out ok, but it would probably be better if you didn't. Since I didn't use canned tomatoes I added just a bit of olive oil when I put them in the pan. I also cooked them until they were squishier which took a bit longer than the 5 min called for. It might have been good to skin the tomatoes first, but I didn't notice it that much. It cooked down to make a nice creamy albeit a bit lumpy sauce. It was good, but I agree with other reviewers that it makes more like 3 servings than 5. I think I ended up with 1½ cups of product. I did think about putting it in a blender before adding the cream. I might try that next time just for fun. It was still good as is. Thanks!

This is a great easy recipe.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead, tripled the garlic(like i almost always do!) and added a bit more cream.  It tasted extrememly close to a restaurant version at our favourite italian place!

This is a great recipe.  So simple, and so delicious.  Served it with store bought gnocchi (I was a little hesitant of that, but it was great) and had dinner in less than half an hour.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the onion flavor was overpowering.  I read that in other reviews, so I used a small onion--which was probably less than half a cup.  Still, the onion overpowered everything else and was SO strong.  I think next time I make this I will start with 1/8 cup of onion and keep working with it until I get the right amount.  Other than that, it was great.  I added a few red pepper flakes which gave it a little kick, and will do that again next time.

This receipe is really tasty. It's much chunkier and different than I imagined, but it is great! Ours didn't reduce properly the first time so it was too watery - just give it more time if you need to. :)

This was so rich and good (after I made a few modifications)!

I used one small onion,  4-5 tsp garlic, 28 oz. italian diced tomatoes (pureed before adding to pan), approximately 12 oz cream, pepper, 2 tbl. butter,  a dash of oregano, and the kicker...2-3 cups of parmesean cheese! This made a world of a difference. It not only thickened the sauce, but added the richness that I was looking for. I omitted the basil, sugar (like other reviewer's suggested), and salt. There was absolutely no need for the salt if you are using salted butter and adding in the parm. I wanted a hearty, rich, creamy, sauce and this was so good! My husband, who is not a fan of red sauces, absolutely loved it! This was enough sauce for about 1 pound of spaghetti.

This was great! It may become my new sauce for all pasta. I puréed the tomatoes because my husband won't eat pieces of cooked tomato. The tomatoes I used already had basil, oregano and garlic. I added a little more garlic, but that was it.
My husband added ground Italian sausage to some of the leftover sauce and put it over spaghetti. He thought that was great also.

I have made this twice now..  The first time as per the written recipe..  The second time with a reduction in sugar and basil by a tad...  I found the second to be more appealing for my taste buds..  Will be making this many more times in the future..

SCRUMPTIOUS! My family and I loved this sauce. It's so easy and quick to make, yet it delivers on taste. I doubled the recipe, but next time I will triple it. If you are making a family-size package of spaghetti and you like a lot of sauce, you'll need to do that. Next time I make it, I will use 2 to 2 1/2 times the garlic the recipe calls for. As originally written, you are getting just a hint of garlic and I like a bit more than that in my spaghetti sauces. I am going to try substituting some cream cheese for the heavy cream as well...(I think it will make the sauce a bit thicker). I did simmer the sauce for about 30 minutes to really blend the flavors and cook out the "tin can" taste from the tomatoes. This made the sauce a nice consistency, but I do enjoy my sauces on the thick side. Anyway, this recipe is a winner and with a bit more garlic, I will consider this one to be perfection.

Simple and superb! Just beware: this doesn't make 5 servings; I doubled it for my eight eaters and it still wasn't quite enough. To stretch it, I added 10 oz. of tomato paste and 1 cup of whole milk. The final result was perfect.

This is absolutely delicious, and so easy to put together. Even more so for me, as I used pre-minced garlic (a LOT more than was called for), and onion powder. Since so many reviews stated the sauce was thin, I did drain the tomatoes before adding. I  just brought all but the cream and butter to a boil, then cooked on medium for about 10 minutes to let the tomatoes simmer a bit longer for better flavor. I then reduced the heat, and added the cream and butter and cooked about 5 minutes as called for. I did not blend as others did, as I like little chunks of tomato. Sauce was a little bit thin, but not overly so once tossed with penne. The next day the consistency is perfect. Topped with shredded parmesan.

Followed this recipe for the most part and like another cook, I didn't have Italian diced tomatoes but added a bit of Italian seasoning to the regular diced tomatoes I had on hand.  I also used a hand blender to cream the sauce in the pot after adding the cream and butter. This had incredible flavor and was rich and a perfect consistency.  I did find that it takes more than 5 minutes to boil down after the tomatoes are added.  For me it was more like 12 - 15 minutes and this may be why some cooks are having to add flour to thicken it. Try letting it simmer longer to reduce the liquid and I am sure you will find this to be a creamy delectable sauce for whatever pasta you accompany it with.

I love this type of sauce....the only thing I did different was to purée it just a bit with a stick blender. We like our sauce a little smoother. Otherwise it was delicious as written and I will make it again. In the summer when I have fresh basil I will use that instead of the dried....should be even more delicious!!

Perfecto!  Very tasty and easy to make with no time at all.  The sauce was creamy and not too thin.  I made this recipe as a side dish in case it didn't work out.  Next time I'll add shrimp.

This was so delicious I almost ate the whole pan. The only difference was I only had a can of Fire Roasted Salsa Style tomatoes so I used that. It definitely gave it a kick, but I love spicy foods. Will make this again and again.

Excellent.  I had a can a 28 oz. can of peeled san Marzano tomatoes on hand so just doubled it and mashed it up.  Quick, yummy, easy.  Used it all on a package of pasta.  I'm thinking if I only did half as suggested it would not be enough.

I have made this a few times and really enjoyed it with the exception of the sweetness.  So I have reduced the amount of sugar to no more then 2 or 3 tablespoons and I have added red pepper flakes to the onion and garlic as they sautee to add a bit of a kick.  I now use crushed tomatoes (28 ounce can) and add a 6 ounce can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.

I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I sautéed about 5-6 medium tomatoes in oil for about 15 minutes with garlic and onion powder since I was out of onions. I blended it as suggested  and added all the spices and remaining ingredients and let simmer while making pasta. This only made about three servings and I did also add flour as others suggested.

This was wonderful.  I ran out of olive oil after 1  Tbl so I also used 1 Tbl butter.  I used three huge tomatoes from the garden, peeled, chopped, with a the juices and added 1Tablespoon of Italian seasoning  instead of the canned tomatoes. I also used half & half  instead of heavy cream and butter. Before I added the half & half I used a wand blender to make the sauce partly smooth.

Great recipe! I have a picky two year old and he had three servings! This will be a regular recipe for our house. 
I made no changes to recipe aside adding a dash of Italian seasonings as recommended by other reviews.

We made this and my husband really liked it alot and he doesn't even eat tomatoes. I read a few posts about adding flour because it was "runny" you have to cook it until most of the liquid evaporates (which is more than 5 minutes). My husband is actually cooking this again tonight. We will be trying this sauce on different dishes.

This recipe was so delicious! I added parm.Cheese, rosmary and Italian seasoning into the sauce. I added rotisserie chicken from the night before with my own seasonings. I added Italian seasoning, salt and pepper,roasted minced garlic, olive oil, a little bit of zest honey mustard. This meal was very delicous, I would make it agian.

Very good recipe to experiement with.  I grilled chicken and deglazed the pan with white wine, added rosemary, half bar of cream cheese, sauteed red bell pepper, ground italian suasage and a dash of basalmic.
The family loves it.  Sometimes we add shrimp, chicken or all three.  It's not a meal to use if you are counting calories.  It's definitely for an induglent night.  Let me know what you think!

This has become a staple in our house we live it! I do use a hand blender and no way is this five servings as is I definitely increase the amounts, I do like heavy cream better but even tripled only need 1/4 cup at most if you also add butter, and don't skip sugar! I have found you don't need to increase it when doubling but need for acid in tomatoes, also small amount of flour or it will be thin but best sauce ever from a can!!

I tried this for the first time with company and was not disappointed! I looked for and couldn't find anyone else who had added peas, but I decided to add petite sweet green peas (frozen) and thought they were a nice touch. I doubled the recipe on everyone's recommendation (a 28 oz. can of tomatoes) and and added more salt. I left the petite cut Roma tomatoes as they were because we like little pieces of tomato and used a pint of heavy cream (come on, it's not like we're going to eat this dish every day!), added a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and maybe four cloves of finely minced garlic. I'm not a very precise measurer, so a lot of my cooking is by feel. It was not thin at all. Served it over rigatoni and had some leftover. Got rave reviews. Easy and quick - it's a keeper.

Very good. Here are the changes I made(only 1 really).  Only 1 TBSP of olive oil to cook onions and garlic, after cooked them a little while I put all my spice in, drained the tomatoes and put them in the blender, then put them in with other stuff, cooked 5 minutes added cream and butter , cooked another 5 minutes...done.  It was great and not runny in the slightest.

Great recipe ! I have used fresh tomatoes (pureed in the blender) and no sugar. Also i sauteed some mushrooms on the side and added them when the sauce was ready. Added some parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce !!!!!YUM

I've been using a similar recipe for years... it uses evaporated milk in place of heavy cream... I suppose you could use fat free in place of it. I've always liked this as a simple, quick meal.  Can be on the table in less than 30-mins.

I made this recipe as written (except for the tomatoes...I only had a box of Hunt's tomato sauce so I used that) and it came out absolutely delicious. I'm sure the suggestions for changes are excellent but I preferred to use the original recipe - and it was worth it! Super easy and paired REALLY well with the garlic chicken also on this site.

It was good. I also pureed it in the food processor. I added some additional garlic and red pepper flakes to make it more spicy.

For a quick pasta sauce this recipe is very good. I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just used milk instead. I also added around a teaspoon of fennel seeds. To thicken the sauce I used a teaspoon of cornstarch. One person said it only made about 3 servings. She must use 2/3 cup per serving. It made just a hair under 2 cups. I like making my recipes from scratch. This way I know what goes into them. Thanks for a great alternative recipe to my pasta sauce with meat. 
UPDATE-This can eaisly be made vegan by using almond milk instead of cream. It's delicious. It's my favorite sauce for pasta and many casseroles.

I made this about a week ago over Penne Pasta. I changed a few things and it came out amazinggg. Instead of using can tomatoes I used fresh and just added Italian Seasoning to the sauce. I used half the onion, double the garlic and FRESH basil all in the blender. I also used about 1/3 cup of tomato paste and added a little of white flower to thiken up the sauce a bit. Omitted the sugar. Again it was Delicious andnot hard to make. Will deffinetly do it again.

Made this "purée" style.  Absolutely delicious as is. I was worried that the cream might be overpowering, but it was a perfect balance of tomato and creaminess.   I will make this again and again!

OMG!!  I don't think I have ever commented on a recipe on here, but this one deserves it.  This was the best pasta I've ever tasted in my life.  I absolutely love the Olive Garden, but I could NEVER go there again, as long as I can make this!  I honestly think that my basil seasoning made the difference as it seemed to have some "hot" spice in it.  Not bad, just enough.  I used "Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Seasoning" (the "Mixed-Up Basil one) that is all natural.  I got it either at Ingle's or Food City in the spice section.  

This recipe has been moved up to my "keeper" list.

Wonderful sauce.  I like mine chunky. If I wanted it smooth is use tomato sauce instead of tomatoes. Also if u take out the CREAM and use skim of course it's going to be runny. Cream helps thicken it. But NEVER use flour. Blah it ruins the taste. Use cornstarch  makes a nice smooth thick sauce without sacrificing taste. I always use it in gravies, sauces.... Anything that calls for a thickener. I take out some of the sauce add the cornstarch till it's thick like icing. Then add a little bit at a time. Wait till it boils and see how much it thickens. Add more if necessary. But be careful not to add to much at a time or u will be adding more liquid. So much better then flour.

This Recipe was excellent and easy! im so glad i found this. I have been wanting to make a easy and tasteful pasta sauce for a while now and found it. The only adjustments i made is i added more garlic and oregano. I love the smell and taste of oregano and i added a small can of tomato Paste and sauce to give it extra flavor and color. Sauce came out great with some linguine and fresh Parmesan.

I have been making this sauce for many years! I sometimes add Vodka when I am cooking this sauce. Also, if I want a meat sauce I add pre cooked Italian sausage with all the grease patted out of it. If I want a bit of a kick to this I add either some medium salsa or a third of a 14.5 can of petite diced can of tomatoes with green chilies. If I have half and half on had I use that instead of the whipping cream. I do add the sugar as the sauce can be a bit acidic. I double all the spices that this recipe calls for and use an additional garlic clove and half the onion that is called for. I double this recipe then freeze in several containers so I have it to pull out of the freezer when I want a meal for two.

So good and so easy. This recipe will be used regularly. I have made it twice now. I used heirloom tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes since that's what I had on hand. I used a handful of fresh basil since I had it. I also left out the sugar. It took more time to reduce the sauce since I used fresh tomatoes. I really like it! Thanks for sharing!
P.S. I agree with another reviewer, this recipe serves 3

This recipe is wonderful.  My only adjustment was the onion (I only used half - personal preference).  Also, I added mushroom and chicken at then end.  It was a great meal for the middle of the week!

I doubled the sauce, except only used 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Sauteed mushrooms and chicken.  Used 4 cheese ravioli.  Me and my husband absolutely loved this recipe, and will definitely make again.  Would also be good with shrimp, or no meat.

Tasty, but doesn't make enough sauce for a pound of pasta.  I also wish it wasn't chunky, but I could blend the sauce before adding the cream and butter.

This sauce does have a great flavor to it. However, we did not care for the texture. I only used half an onion and fresh tomatoes and it was simply not the cream texture I was searching for.

Really good sauce! I was trying to copy a similar sauce my husband and I tried at an Italian restaurant, and this is really close to it. The sauce in the restaurant was a little bit thicker, my guess is that they add flower in it. But, this sauce is also really, really good. We ate pasta with spinach, but would've worked even better with, like, cheese ravioli? Love it!

Very tasty! I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and doubled the other ingredients (except for the onion), substituted fat free half, and cooked the sauce for a bit longer. I think I would also use a lot less basil next time.

very good but we wanted to add a little more to it. We added about 2 slices of fried bacon, 3 sliced and cooked italian sausages and a can of mushrooms drained. We make our version of this recipe lots and save leftovers for lunches.

Super easy and tasty!  I did make a few changes - half n' half instead of the cream because that's all I had, fresh basil from the garden instead of dried, and omitted the pepper because I hate it.  It came out great.  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this sauce countless times since I found this recipe, and everyone in the house loves it! After the first time I've taken to using half and half in place of heavy cream, at least a little bit healthier and just as tasty!

Loved this sauce!   I added too much sugar to mine because it came out a little too sweet. I added about 3 tablespoons of chicken broth and that worked to take the sweetness out.

I made this on a whim so I wasn't able to shop for all the ingredients...however it turned out fabulous!  Probably our favorite sauce recipe yet!!  All I had on hand was a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos (which was great because we love a good kick) and I didn't have heavy cream so I used cream cheese instead (all I had!)  I did everything else as listed.  It was phenomenal!  My husband about licked the bowl clean!  :)

I also pureed mine in the food processor to get a creamier sauce. The flavors taste more complex compared to how easy it is to make. I will switch it up and add shrimp or broccoli florets at times, whatever I have on hand. Very quick and impressive entree.

This is delicious.  I read some reviews stating they couldn't get the sauce thick enough.  I substituted cream cheese for the heavy cream and it was perfect!

I'm not good at experimenting but at the drop of a hat, when I had just a half hour to prepare dinner for 2, this recipe worked! Absolutely delicious. I  usedonly one-half of a small onion instead of a whole onion and I used 2 garlic cloves, not one.  I had all of the ingredients except the 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes so I substituted what I had on hand: a one-quart container of fresh grape tomatoes, which I mashed in the pan when added, along with an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I used those two items instead of the large can of diced tomatoes. This sauce was perfect with a half-pound of macaroni. Added grated parmigiana & more fresh pepper to my plate. Delicious! (For those who thought the sauce was too liquid, they may have covered the sauce while it simmered. Don't cover it.)

Delicious! I make this about once a week because my boyfriend loves it. The only thing I change is I like to add half a zucchini and half a banana squash chopped up. I add it when I add the tomatoes. It gives it a more flavor and texture.

Just made this for dinner and it was just ok.  I wish it had more of a tomato flavour. Also, I think there was too much dried basil. I wish I had made it with fresh instead.  My husband thought it was just ok too. I think with tweaking and fresh basil, this would be much better.

So I realized I did not have cream after I started making this sauce. I used cream cheese in the place of it. I think it would have tasted better if I had not used salt at the beginning, because adding the cream cheese made it more salty. But it isn't bad! I think the sauce is a little too sweet for me though.

Very good sauce, the whole family loved it! I ended up cutting back quite a bit on the dried herbs (the canned tomatoes already had a lot of herbs in them) and adding in a bit of parmesean cheese at the end. We will definitely be making this again!

To make this a healthier dish I will sometimes subistute the cream for milk or do half milk, half cream.  This dish has become a stable in our household!

Fantastic! I made it with half an onion and a large diced fresh tomato.  I used whole milk instead of cream, and added some tomato paste for a thicker texture.  The key is to puree it -- I used an immersion blender. Great as a sauce, and good enough on its own that I plan to eat it as soup tomorrow!

This was pretty good.  I doubled it and blended one of the cans of tomatoes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I put "some" butter in rather than measuring it and added six garlic cloves - that is the only variant.  I doubled it to toss with 5 mild sausages and 17 oz of pasta.  Pretty good.

Great sauce! I followed a few of the others tips and it came out delicious! Both my kids are picky and they both ate this PLUS seconds! A winner for me!
I did 1/2 an onion, added 3 cloves of garlic & pureed the tomatoes for smooth texture..Perfect for my family!

I've made this twice.  The first time I used 1% milk because I didn't have cream and added flour to thicken and it tasted good, and I'm sure the cream would make it just that much better!

The second time I made it, no one (including me) really liked it.  ???  It was really bland (which is weird because of all the spices).  I hate that I can't rate it higher, but I'm only giving it 3 stars.

Excellent!  Made a few changes...added 8 oz. whipping cream, small can of tom. paste (with the oregano/spices), 2 TBSP of butter with all the org. ingredients, let sauce simmer for about 40 mins and.  We served it over penne pasta  and sauteed up some chicken-everyone liked it, including my very picky son!

This is a delicious sauce.  I subbed milk & a bit of butter for the cream since I didn't have it, and 19 oz. can of garlic & olive oil tomatoes since I had it on hand.  I'll definitely be making this again, simply delicious!!

Woww.. we were blown away by how good this is. I was craving a tomato cream sauce and this was better than I've ever tasted. I did follow another reviewers advice and put it the sauce in a blender to make it smooth and added some sweet italian sausage. MMMmmm...Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy to make and delicious!  I added chicken (cut into small pieces).  And I prefer a saltier taste so next time Ill add more salt and probably omit the sugar.  But salt was something that can be added to your liking afterwards.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I added spicy ground pork sausage to balance out the sweetness of the cream. Then I threw it over some Radiatori pasta. Yum yum yum!

It is so tasty that I almost ate the saucepan! I only added a little bit more garlic, cause I like a combination of tomatoes and garlic.

This took some tweaking, but I ended up with a very flavorful dish. I cooked the chicken separately (one pound of cubed chicken) in a little oil and 3/4 tsp salt, a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper and about a tsp of garlic powder. I covered this and let it cook, stirring only occasionally. For the sauce, I doubled the amount of minced garlic, finely diced one onion and added 8 oz of sliced white mushrooms. Used about five ripe tomatoes for this. I added 3/4 tsp of salt and about 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. I let the tomatoes cook down and then took out the mushrooms; the remainder I pureed in the blender to get a smooth consistency (careful if you do this - it is very hot) and then put the puree back in the pot together with the mushrooms.  Added 1 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup of chopped fresh basil to this. Don't forget the sugar - it will help cut the acid/tart taste of the tomatoes. At this point I added 1 cup of half and half and 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken (since I didn't use the heavy cream). Chopped up the seasoned cooked chicken even further in the meantime and added it into the sauce. Served over penne pasta and it was delicious. Will definitely make this again.

i really liked this, and the recipe made enough for half a box of penne. i used  2 cloves of garlic and a small onion, 3/4 cup of milk because im watching my calories and fat and i also ran in through the blender really quick. i tossed the pasta with the sauce, added some parm cheese lots of italian seasoning and it came out awesome!

As with the first time I make any recipe I followed it as written. I have to say it came out so well that I would make it exactly the same way again. There was no need for any modifications in my opinion. It was delicious.

Simply delicioso!  I love a creamy tomato sauce, and this recipe is a winner!  You can add more chopped onion, tomato, etc, to thicken it, and more milk to make it more creamy.  I will be making this again & again!  My Italian man raved!  Thank you!

Oh my gosh, this is so good! This was my very first time making sauce from scratch, and this was so easy to prepare and came out perfect. I used half the onion, twice the garlic, subbed half and half for the heavy cream, and thickened it with a little flour...and it was perfect! I served it on manicotti (which I find rather bland with regular tomato sauce--I parboiled the manicotti shells, filled them, and baked them in the sauce, and the shells softened up nicely in the oven--I used 20 servings of the sauce for 1 box of manicotti), and it was absolutely delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

I was looking for a yummy recipe that could compare to the creamy tomato sauce that I love at a local Italian restaurant and this hit the mark.  I did as others suggested by using 3/4 cup of nonfat milk instead of the heavy cream and added some Italian seasoning.  I also substituted the sugar for 4 packets of Splenda and added a small can of tomato paste to make it thicker.  I also simmered it for about an hour to let the flavors meld.

My husband liked it but I guess cream-tomato sauces are not my cup of tea, I've never really been impressed by them. After I told my husband how much cream was involved he decided maybe it wasn't worth it.

this was wonderful!  I did melt the butter in a separate pan and added an equal part flour to the butter to make a roux since some had said the sauce was a little on the thin side. I also added a splash of red wine. Loved this sauce!

This sauce is AWESOME!  I was looking for something somewhat simple to make for lunch/dinner, and we had ample tomato sauce and pasta, so I went looking for a recipe and found this!  I ended up running to the store and buying the cream and plain, no salt-added diced tomatoes.  I omitted the onion, replacing it with a dash of onion powder, added much more garlic (I think I put about 5 cloves in it), and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a teaspoon.  I also added about 1/3 cup of vodka (since I absolutely adore vodka sauce).  Before adding the cream and butter we ran the sauce through the blender, since it was super chunky, and I'm glad that we did.  The sauce came out amazing and delicious!  I served it with meatballs (on the side) and garlic bread.  Next time, though, I will double the recipe!  Four of us ate it and there's only one small serving left!  We will definitely make this sauce again!

Wonderful! Family loved it. I used Fresh tomato, half and half and about 1/4 tbs butter. Plus used 1/4 tsp each: seasoning salt, Italian bread seasoning, and dried tomato pesto. I also used fresh basil. Will use again. So easy. I made this and added frozen meatballs before the cream and butter. Once cooked then I added the cream.

Second time I sauté one shallot and one onion. After a few minutes I reduced heat and added several whole partly smashed garlic. Cooked for a minute. Then added ingredients as suggested. I only used 1/4 tsp each: seasoning salt, Italian garlic bread seasoning, and dried tomato and garlic pesto seasoning.

Yummy!  I did stick the sauce in the blender after I cooked it.  I recommend doing this, especially for picky eaters.  Also, this is perfect for a 2 person main dish.

Love this sauce.  I also used a tomato sauce as a substitute when I was out of diced tomato and added some parmesan cheese.  Absolutely wonderful!

Use crushed tomatoes instead of diced and don't substitute anything for the cream. doing it this way will give you a thicker sauce....no flour needed!

Very, very delicious recipe!   And super easy.   The sauce was done before my pasta was finished.  For those who had found this to be too thin, be sure to do the step where you boil the liquid down off the tomatos, it will help the sauce not be runny.

DELIGHTFUL! It was grocery day and I somehow planned meals for the entire week except tonight...it was time to get creative! I didn't use any olive oil, instead I sauteed the onions in the butter and then added in about a tsp. or so of flour, whisked it with the butter and added the cream (used 1/2 c. cream and about 1.4 c. milk) until there were no lumps. Then I added in all the other ingredients. Simmered for about 15 minutes to get a good consistency. Then I pureed everything in the blender! Wonderful! I also added about a tbsp of vodka, extra pepper and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for a little kick!  My fiance said it tasted just like the sauce on his seafood pasta at one of our favorite restaurant - he even said it tasted GOURMET. Score one for Allrecipes :)

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup of half n half and 1/2 whipping cream, added some garlic powder and red pepper flakes. It was so good! Def a good change from regular spaghetti. Will try it next time with chicken on top too.

My family loves this dish.   I always double the recipe so there will be left overs.   If you double the the recipe drain one of the cans of diced tomatoes to cut down on the liquid.   I also use light cream instead of heavy cream and I only add 1/2 a table spoon of butter.

i was unfortunately disappointed with this. from the reviews, and having followed reviewers' suggestions, i thought it was going to be amazing, and it was just okay. i might make it again, but would play with the seasonings and add lots of veggies to jazz it up.

I really liked this.  I would most definitely double or triple the sauce.  I cooked for 2 people and there was barely enough sauce and I followed the recipe exactly.  I bet mushrooms would be good in this also.

This pasta sauce is out of this world! My whole family loved it! Definately puree the sauce in your blender for a few sec. before mixing with cream and if possible use fresh basil. We topped our hot pasta with slices of grilled chicken and some shrimp. Thanks K imber for sumitting your recipe!

Tasty and definitely quick and easy....I added cut up fresh green beans and sun dried tomatoes to my fusilli while it was boiling so this ended up as a colourful interesting dish! Next time I will double the sauce as we like lots of sauce and will try lighter cream (as others have suggested) to make this healthier.

The flavor of this sauce was good, but the texture was off.  First, it was much thinner than I expected it to be.  And second, I either used too big of an onion or I didn't cook it long enough- they were still crunchy and overwhelmed the dish.  Next time I'll add some tomato paste for thickening, and use less onion.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I was looking for a way to use up some heavy whipping cream I had on hand and this worked out great and so easy and fast - black olives might be a nice addition to this sauce, but it's great as is.  Hubby liked it too!

I blended the sauce as recommended by others, but it still had a strange consistency. My husband was a little skeptical, but it tasted much better than it looked and he gave it a thumbs up. I'll definitely try this again, but maybe puree longer..

I changed just a little bit to give it a stronger taste. 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.  With parmesan on top of a bowl, it was amazing.  I also used fresh tomatoes (peeled and seeded) instead of canned.  5 medium tomatoes seemed to replace the can pretty well.

I LOVED this recipe!  I made it exactly as-is except had to use a substitute for heavy cream (whole milk and butter) as I didn't have any in the house.  Husband said it tasted like a restaurant!  It was even better as leftovers the next day for lunch.  YUM!!!!!

Very easy and so delicious.  Not heavy like so many pasta sauces.   I might even turn it into a tomato soup.

This sauce is really delicious. I prepared chunky, with 1/2 the onion and added cooked, cubed chicken breast, broccoli and mushrooms (during saute phase) . With the addition of the vegges and meat the recipe does serve 5. Sauce can be runny, but it's nothing a little cornstarch can't fix! Yum!

This has become my husbands favorite dish that I make. However, he's a true italian....so when I make this, I add a little more sugar than this recipe calls for. Sometimes, 3 teaspoons. ;) And I also add a little more cream. Depending upon the consistency....I either add some more tomatoes or if I don't have a can open....I just add a little sauce from an open jar in the fridge.

Very good. I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes (all I had), 4 cloves of garlic, fresh basil, and a can of tomato paste to make it a bit thicker. It was delicious as well as easy to make on a night I had time restraints!

My very picky eaters loved this recipe...I used garlic diced tomatos and that really brought out the garlic flavor.  I even added some groud up italian sausage which one of my eaters loved, the other didn't like chunks in her food.  Would definitely make again.

I tried this recipe on a whim because I wanted something fresh that wouldn't take too long to cook...this came out great for me! I pretty much did exactly what the recipe said and pureed the tomatoes before adding the cream, based on other reviews. The flavors were perfect together, and it wasn't a heavy meal, which is what I was looking for. I will def add some sausage or chicken the next time I make it!

THANK YOU for this recipe!!!! It was really good!!! The only things I did differently are: I Doubled the recipe  and since I don't have a blender I pureed 2 small onions and 3 cloves of garlic to make sure it was smooth.  After adding the cream I added a small hand full of Romano cheese to the sauce while simmering.  I poured the sauce over cooked cheese filled Ravioli in a baking dish and covered with shredded Mozarella and Cheddar cheese and baked for about 20 mins.......:)  Next time I make this sauce I'm going to try it over my homemade Lasagna  P.S when you double the recipe it calls for 2 tablespoons of basil....I only used about 3/4 of a tablespoon.... Thanks Again :)

I'm giving this a 5 for super easy.  To make it with meat I topped off the pasta with Chicken Picatta from Sam's Club found in the frozen section. The chicken picatta comes with 2 trays so double the sauce recipe and freeze half. EASY & YUM!

This is a very solid basis for a simple, quickly-made cream sauce.  As other suggest, a puree would likely be best for most.  However, quick being key, I've had good results following the directions as-is, but sub-ing sun-dried tomatoes for canned/fresh and using finely chopped fresh basil.  A little flour helps to thicken the sauce just a bit.

This is a really good recipe. I have made it several times and my husband would have me make it several times a week if he could! To make it more "hardy" I added about 1/2-1 cup of beef flavored TVP (I'm vegetarian)- tastes great!

husband said it was restaurant quality.  I added two chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces for the last few minutes of simmering (chicken was cooked 95% of the way before adding it to sauce).  Very quick to make so a good go to recipe when in a hurry.

I tried this recipe TWICE and it didn't turn out the way I expected; some flavors lacking, some flavors too bold, thin and runny BOTH times. My rating is on how the recipe turned out, NOT on taste or idea. The first time I did it, I did exactly as directed. It took alot longer than 5 minutes for the liquid to evaporate, and after about 10 minutes of waiting for the cream to thicken it up at the end, I added a little cornstarch and water.  Granted, it DOES taste good, but on a personal note, I'd reduce the basil by about 1/2 and add a little more garlic.  Though this recipe didn't make the grade, I am going to hang on to it because it has potential.  I think next time, I'll up the garlic and try using all fresh ingredients, puree them, and try it with about 1/4 of a cup of chicken stock instead of water.

Well, I was really excited to make this, but it just didn't turn out how I expected. I think one attributing factor is that I must have chosen too big of an onion. I think I will try this again, but definitely with less onion. It looks great in the picture, but what I ended up with was a very thin and oily sauce. I think I will run the leftover through my food processor and add some jarred sauce to it and it will be quite good.

I tried the recipe as written, but we didn't care for it.  However, this may be easily attributable to two things:  first, the recipe merely called for "one onion" (rather than specifying a specific size or amount of chopped onion) and I think the onion I used must have been about double the size of what was needed; second, the recipe stated a yield of 5 servings so I cooked a 5-serving amount of pasta to match but I think the sauce was stretched far too thin.  The overall result was a bland oniony glaze.  The next day I reheated the leftovers with a storebought can of spaghetti sauce and it was great - probably did benefit from the cream of the previous sauce.  Willing to try again but will reduce onion and alter ratio of sauce to pasta.

Do not change anything about this! So good, I put red pepper flakes on the table for people that needed more spice. I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount for a box of pasta. I added sweet italian sausage to make it a filling meal. My guest loved it. Oops, forgot to say I threw the sauce in the blender to get rid of chunks.

This was easy to make and did not take much time at all. Altough I ended up adding some tomato sauce. I didn't like how thick and chunky it was. But would make again the same way I did.

I followed this to the T with the exception of subsituting half and half for heavy cream. I was not totally impressed. I thought it was too liquidy. I boilded a little longer to try and remove some of the liquid. The flavor is good, but I thought there was a little too much basil and not enough oregano. Next time I will add more oregano and less basil. I will probaly drain some of the liquid from the tomatos and boil a little longer.

I adore this sauce.  The trick to getting it thick is just to let it simmer on low for a while.  I use extra garlic and lots of black pepper and add sugar to taste and serve it over any kind of cheese filled tortellini.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good and simple...a little too mild for our taste as written, but this is easily adaptable to accomodate for more heat or flavors, i.e. hot peppers, green peppers, cheese, etc. I also used fresh garden tomatoes rather than canned, so either will work. Great simple, basic recipe.

Really enjoyed this simple to prepare sauce. I used light cream, turned out just fine. I did lightly sprinkle a dusting of cornstarch over sauce to thicken at the end of the five minutes.

Very good with some modifications.  I blended it before adding the cream to make it smoother as another reviewer suggested.  I also cut back the sugar to 1/4 teaspoon and used fresh basil and fresh tomatoes that I had on hand.  Will definately make again.

This sauce is so good.  My family loved it.  I would suggest you add flour to thicken it up.  Other than that it is good just the way it is.

I thought this recipe was amazing, but i  doubled the sauce and instead of using 2 cloves of garlic i used 4, and one large onion instead of 2..I used a little less than a box and a half of whole grain penne and the doubled sauce was just right for 5 people, and 2 servings left over for lunch the next day at work.  The other thing i would also recommend pureeing at least half of the sauce if you prefer a smoother sauce... This was an amazing recipe..I think next time I may add some grated parmigiano reggiano to the sauce next time... mmmmmmm

Good flavour. Easy to make with simple ingredients. Mine didnt thicken up very much even after adding the cream so I used 1 tbsp of tomato paste. Did the trick!

Easy and delicious!  We pureed at the end for the picky eaters amongst us.  Could use a little more bite...relatively mild flavors.

Very good sauce and so easy to put together. I used half and half instead of cream because that's what I had and I increased the amount of garlic. I will make this often.

This is a wonderful sauce, and the prep time is so
quick and easy. But as others have noted it serves
2 or maybe 3, but not 5. Followed the recipe other
than reducing the onion to 1/4 cup, tripled the garlic
(you can never have too much garlic), added 1/8
cup red wine and 1 tbs of chopped black olives. I
pureed it with my stick blender, then served it over
angel-hair pasta. 5 stars and highly recommended!

Absolutely delicious! I substituted skim milk for heavy cream and cut out a bit of the butter and the sauce still turned out very nice.

This was very tasty, I didn't have heavy cream so i sub with low fat organic milk and cream cheese, with a half tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce! Will use again and again. Thanks

Its a brilliant recipe and i will be giving it a go, but the only down side is is that its fattening with the whipped cream in it. So i cant keep making it as a regular dinner for the family. But apart from that it looks like it will make a nic meal for everybody.

My husband normally dslikes tomatoes, but he LOVES this sauce. I think next time I might used crushed tomatoes instead of diced, I like smaller chunks. Otherwise, easy and delicious recipe.

This sauce was absouletly awesome!  I used Zesty Jalapeno diced tomatoes for a little zing.  Very good.  I also agree with a previous post, I think it was to much basil, but hey.. we learn as we go to our own tastes.  Thanks for sharing!! This a def. Keeper!

I followed the advice of others and puréed the sauce, as I'm not a lumpy sauce fan. I put it in the blender and a word of advice if you are to use the blender method: Be careful when pulsing as the sauce will be hot, creating steam in the blender. The steam builds up, you turn the blender on, and the pressure inside may make everything explode. If you've ever seen those old pizza pop commercials... you'll get the picture. I learned the hard way the first time. And I also put in at least double, if not triple the garlic. You can never have too much garlic! :) All in all, a wonderful recipe.

I made this as a quick fix meal last night, and it was great! I doubled the recipe as other had suggested. I used one can oregano, garlic, and basil dicred tomatoes and one can petit deiced tomatoes. I also used 2 big cloves of garlic and only one diced onion. I would definitely make this again!

I served this sauce over chicken & spinach cannelloni for Christmas dinner.  It was a hit.  The part I love the most is how quick and easy it is to prepare; I made it the day before.  I added white wine to it, and used a little less tomato and put it in the blender.  I baked the cannelloni, and then poured the pink creamy sauce over them, so that the sauce will not dry up in the oven.  It came out delicious.

Simple, tasty and economical! I used half a medium onion and will definitely dice it the next time I make this meal. I used fat free half 'n half instead of the cream. My 3 year old loved it and my husband said I could make this every week and he'll eat it.

Added some sauteed mushrooms and a bit of marjoram and it was delicious. Next time I'll use a little bit more diced tomatoes for some extra oomph.

This is delicious!  And so easy!  I served it with cheese ravioli, and everyone (me, 17 mo. old, picky preschooler, and even pickier husband!) was happy.  Like others, I substituted whole milk for half and half and used a hand blender to smooth it somewhat.  This thickened it, also.  I also subbed dried parsley for oregano since I used Italian style tomatoes.  I brought the leftovers for lunch--YUM!

Was very pleasantly surprised with this sauce. I followed to a tee (whipped up in the processor as one reviewer suggested), it was delicious over campanelle. It could be argued that it was a bit on the sweet side but not terribly. As another reviewer noted, this recipe would really suit 3 people rather than 5. Recommend it highly.

Absolutely delicious! I make this at least once a month, usually in a double batch so I can freeze half of it for later.  I omit the butter and sugar, and I use a little less olive oil than the recipe calls for.  It's fantastic!

I thought this was pretty good.  I served over bow-tie pasta with some chunks of chicken mixed in.  I used my immersion blender at the end to make the sauce smoother.  Will probably make this again.  It might be good to mix in melted cream cheese in place of the heavy cream.

This is really delicious, I love it. My only problem is it's a little too soupy, like it doesn't stick to the pasta. I will make sure I drain my pasta more next time and I love a chunky sauce so I didn't take others advice on  blending the tomatoes so they're smooth. I wish I had because I think that would have helped with my runny sauce problem. After it cools down a little, it thickens up. I might take another person's advice and put a little tomato paste in. Otherwise, this is just so delish!

I made this with Gnocchi I from this site and it was absolutely delicious!  I didn't have dried basil on hand so I used Italian herbs.  Excellent recipe!

This is one of my favorite sauces I have ever made.  The flavor was amazing and I didn't know all those flavors were so easy to create.  Even without the cream base, the tomatoes after the seasonings were deliciouso.

the first time i made this i followed the suggestions to blend it to have creamy sauce-  it was a little bland.  i tried it again using the original recipe and wow, YUM!  even greater if you add grilled chicken or shrimps.  oh, and definitely will not serve 5.  it's good for only about 3 people.

I thought this was super easy and delicious. I didn't have any cream so I just used milk and a dollop of cream cheese (someone suggested it). I cooked up some linguine and grilled some chicken breast.  I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent. I triple this recipe to mix with angel hair pasta and top stuffed chicken breasts. I break up the tomatoes with a potato masher so it's not so chunky. I also substitute fat free evaporated milk for the 1/2 & 1/2.

I had this souce for dinner tonight with home-made fettucine. My husband loved it, but it was just average for me. The sauce seemed a little bland but it might have been because I ate it over freshly-made pasta (which is much thicker than the store-bought dry noodles). Next time, I will try thickening the sauce with permesan cheese and maybe add more garlic for flavors.

This was wonderful. Just what I was craving. I put in a few dashes of red wine, (cause I was drinking it while makig!) and used half & half in place of heavy cream. I also added some canned tomato sauce (about 3/4 can) to thin it out a bit.I served with marinated grilled chicken breasts, salad and warm bread. I agree with the others that its not enough for 5, especially if you want dipping sauce.

I enjoyed the ease of this recipe. I added some diced bell peppers and some left-over chicken and went a little heavy-handed with the spices the second time I made it. I think this is a great recipe, and it's easy to adjust to personal tastes.

I used this sauce for gnocchi.  Have a more substantial sauce was great.  I really enjoyed the taste - restaurant quality.  I used about half the butter.  Definately make this again!

This recipe is PHENOMENAL! I made the Tomato Pesto Bread Batter recipe from this site and I used the bread to scoop up this creamy, chunky sauce. I have to agree with other reviewers, though... I LOVE sauce with my pasta and this MIGHT be enough for two servings for me, but definitely not for 5. In actuality, I could eat all of this sauce, plain, all by myself. I would give this more stars, if I could.

Good sauce!
I made a few alterations though.  I'm a fan of really creamy chunkless (is that an existing word?) sauce, so I started by pureeing(sp?) the garlic and onions, instead of just chopping them.  I did that before I cooked them, and in retro spect I probably should have cooked then pureed them, because it would have been easier to tell they were done.  Not to mention that I doubled the amount of garlic, because I like the extra kick.
Also, instead of using canned diced tomatoes, I used canned tomato sauce.  Because of this, the cream was unnecessary, because the sauce didn't need any more thinning.
And, last but not least, I added some pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to give it some spice, because I am a spicy food fiend.  I think Tobasco sauce would've worked out better, but I was fresh out.

Any recipe that my kids will eat gets 5 *...I changed it up and used 3 med fresh tomatoes, chopped fine from the garden, a tablespoon of soya sauce, 1/4 cup wine, 3/4 half and half cream and fresh basil from the garden...the rest was the same...oh and a sprinkling of nutmeg and instead of olive oil I used olive oil I have garlic and rosemary sitting in and omitted the onion and garlic other than that and put garlic powder (as my kids won't eat a cooked onion). They devoured it over gnocci!  Thanks a ton for a  great base.

Nothing terribly special.  I had been really excited to try this one, too.  In the end I doctored it up a bunch just to try to get a better flavor.  I added some crushed red pepper, a little more sugar and butter, and some vodka, and got more of a vodka sauce flavor.  It ended up being better the next day for dipping with Easy Focaccia from this site.

We loved this!  I served it over homemade fettucine pasta.  I added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and used 3/4 cup half and half rather than whole cream.  I don't think it really makes 5 servings either, more like 3.  But we will make this recipe again!

WOW. I made this for my sister's birthday dinner, as tomato cream sauce is her favorite. I was hoping this would come close...she and everyone else told me it was better than any restaurant version! The changes I made were to reduce onion to 1/2, and added an extra garlic clove. I took another reviewer's advice and pureed it in the food processor before adding the cream and it was a perfect consistency. I will definately be making this one again!

i'll give it a five becasue it is so simple, easy, quick to make and my boyfriend loved it!. personally i thought it was kinda tangy but i'll try adding white wine next time. 
I only used half of a onion and used 3 cloves of garlic. i put the mixture in the blender and made a pureee and then addeded heavy cream and cooked for a little bit more. 
i don't understand what the other reviewers were talking about when they say it only comes down to two servings. i think its definelty five servings and also make sure you use "undrained" tomatoes and cook it until the water evaporates.
this is a keeper.

My family (2 teens & husband) & I really like this. By accident, I used the big 28 oz can of tomatoes, and cooked it down for a while. I used less sugar, and 1/2 to 1 cup of half & half instead of cream. Since I had it on hand, I also added approx 2T of romano cheese. I sauteed & added to the sauce some chicken sun-dried tom.sausage, cooked a bag of tortellini, mixed it all together. It was plenty of food for 4! Yum!

Absolutely delicious!  I made the recipe as written except that I added a bit more garlic, a touch more sugar and a little more basil to give it a little more flavor.  It was fantastic!

Also, the recipe as submitted made enough sauce for my wife and I to have on raviolis with a yogurt-cup sized amount of leftover sauce.

I agree put less onions and more heavy cream.  I didn't have the Italian diced tomatoes so I just used regular diced tomatoes and it was still great.  I also added chicken and crushed red peppers and it was delicious.

Amazing recipe.  My hubby loved it!!  I added red peppers, scallops and shrimps to make it a seafood pasta.  I put the scallops and shrimps when adding the cream so that they don't overcook.  Will definitely be making again.

This was a very good sauce, but I put more diced tomatoes (3/4 of a 28oz can)and I added a half a can of tomatoe paste to thicken it up and it turned out really great. Also next time I think I'll only put half an onion (a whole was was too much)and also maybe a little bit less basil. But still, this is really good and we will definatly make it again! Thanks!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!!  I did cut down on the onion quite a bit to maybe 1/4 cup.  The only other change I made was that after some of the liquid cooked off, I put the sauce into my food processor and pureed until smooth.  Then I transferred it back to the pan and added the butter and cream.  I served it along with cheese ravioli. YUM!!!
It tasted like I had gone to gourmet school!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

i've been searching for a tomato cream sauce that's like the one at my favorite restaurant. this looked promising & came close to my expectations. i followed the recipe exactly as written & had enough sauce to cover 3 servings of penne. fortunately, it was the right amount for what we needed. i suggest doubling this sauce to yield 5 healthy servings. note: be careful to only simmer & not boil your sauce after you stir in the heavy cream. thank you kimber!

This was a great sauce to serve over Grandmas Gnocchi.  I will use it over pasta and also add some sea food as a variation.

This was a last minute decision because we were tired of plain, red tomato sauce on our pasta.  What a fantastic addition to my recipe box this is!  I didn't have any cream, so I used half-and-half.  It turned out better than I expected, and it's just as good as any tomato cream sauce that I've had in a restaurant!  I will absolutely make this again and again.

I turned this recipe into a crock-pot dish with meatballs. It was a huge success at a pot-luck! Prepared as stated, only I didn't simmer off the liquid. Poured the whole thing into a crock, added pre-make/cooked meatballs and cooked til heated thru. Added cream and butter half hour before serving as I didn't know if the cream would curdle. It was fine!
Also, increased yield to serve 10.

So easy & so delicious! I've made it three times now, and the whole family keeps asking for more. Each time, I've followed the recipe "as is" but added baby shrimp to the saute mix. The results never cease to amaze!

I used this sauce to replicate the Angelini di Mare I had at Macaroni Grill the previous night.  This sauce was WAY better!  I doubled the recipe (omitted the butter), pureed the canned tomatoes, added 3/4 lb. jumbo shrimp (cooked in the sauce), two 3 oz.pkg of Lump Crab meat, 1/2 C. fresh frozen green peas (blanched), and freshly shredded parmesan both in the sauce and as a garnish.  It was DELISH!!!!  It got rave review from my friends I cooked for.  I used 1 1/2 pkg of angel hair pasta, and it was plenty for three to have seconds, and still have 2 hefty servings left over.  Suffice to say doubling the recipe feeds 6-8 at $3/person!!  Definitely a keeper!

Very good and also quick and easy!  Used half and half instead of the cream and thickened with cornstarch and water.  Left out the butter.  Even my super picky 5 year old daughter asked me to make this again.

this was fantatic!  soooo easy to make.  I too added less basil and twice the cream (or half and half).  It is "thin" but absolutely restaurant tasty.  My family and friends love it!  Thanks Kimber!!!  Will make it often!!  I already crave it weekly!

I cooked 2 diced chicken breasts with a bit of oil  with a good amount of curry before the sauce, when the chicken was almost done added all the sauce ingredients and continued to cook until the the chicken was done. Also doubled the sauce because I wanted to put it over rice. I put the diced tomatoes in the blender for a second or two so they wouldn't be chunky and I didn't add the oregano or thyme. I didn't want it to taste Italianish. It was AMAZING! I put it over some basmati rice and omg it was frickin ridiculous. 10/10 would make this way again :)

I revamped this recipe quite a bit. I used 2 cans of Whole tomatoes...I also added some crushed red pepper flakes along with the other herbs. I simmered and let the sauce reduce for an hour. Then I mashed up the tomatoes with a potatoe masher. Added my cream....way better and so much more flavor!!

This looked tasty so I gave it a try,I am a very experienced cook and just wanted something quick ,based on the reviews I did. Sorry but I had to rework the whole thing! It was so acidic and bitter I added more sugar as I usually do for pasta sauce; that didn't help. I did remember reading someone added cream cheese and so I did that which helped a bit. Eventually, because I wanted to use the tomatoes, I crumbled and browned a chicken sausage and added that, plus some nutmeg, a bit of leftover beef broth and almond milk. Basically turned it into a pseudo bolognese  sauce minus the wine. I think adding some tomato paste would help as it can add  sweetness too. Often oregano can also be overpowering  which this amount was. We tossed over some bow tie noodles and it was pretty descent.  I don't usually write reviews and certainly my intent is not to  make the cook feel bad but this really needs help.

I used crushed tomatoes, and tweaked the measurements of the added spices and allowed the sauce to cook a bit longer before adding my cream and I added peas and bacon. It was fantastic!

This had a good flavor.  My changes based on what I had on hand and taste.  Used milk instead of cream, so would add flour as thickener next time. Did not add sugar. Blended sauce to make it smooth.  Mixed it with some sautéed spinach and shrimp and served over thin spaghetti.  Husband loved the flavor and said he would be glad to eat again.

Made it to serve with store-bought ravioli. The ravioli was not impressive, but the sauce was great. I pureed in the blender and added a bit of cayenne and no sugar. Will make again.
With more cream, it could be a good tomato soup, too.

Loved this!! Flavor combination was wonderful. I took recommendations from past reviews and puréed the tomatoes. I used half the onions thinking they’d be overpowering if I used full onion. I could have used a bit more but half worked well. Just yummy. Need to lick my bowl now :)

Fast and easy!  This is an excellent home made creamy marinara sauce that my kids enjoyed.  I followed the instructions from other reviewers by blending the sauce and omitting the sugar.  I also accidentally bought half and half instead of cream, but was pleased with the end result!

Insanely good. Followed recipe exactly—just blended it before doing the cream and butter. So good and so easy!

Great Taste. I added meat balls and used Ziti noodles. It is such a nice smooth mixture of tomatoes and cream. Yummy!

Super yummy! Definitely will make it again. I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I substituted it with milk and extra butter than the recipe calls for. I also pureed mine when I was done making it. Delicious!

I added some sweet Italian sausage to it and cooked the onion and garlic along with that before adding the other ingredients.  Added just a little more "chew" to the dish.

Ok this recipe has a good foundation but is not very good on it's own. Too sweet. I modified the recipe and give the modified version 5 stars. 

Here is what I did differently - 
-blended tomato/onion mixture in blender after simmering
- added one can of tomato sauce and simmered for 5 mins

I also included red pepper flakes which made it nice and spicy.

This is a great recipe. Like many online sauce recipes, however, it can come out a little flat. I recommend adding either a little more butter or maybe even an egg yolk. The latter will make the sauce a little thicker too. Another option is to add parmesan cheese directly to it. Be sure you boil the tomatoes until there is very little liquid left, as this liquid is mostly water with little flavor and will make your sauce watery if you leave it in. The less liquid the better, just don't overcook the tomatoes. I have tried this with many pastas and my favorites to pair it with are penne and ravioli.

I made a couple alterations to this recipe 
For starters I used an entire onion and a half, diced and sauteed until very soft in about two sticks of butter. I left the heat on low and just cooked the onions way down. Translucent nearly. 

Then I added about six cloves of garlic, minced, and let that simmer with the onions until fragrant. Whole can of marsano tomatoes. And about three tablespoons of tomato paste. 

Forget dried herbs in this dish. Fresh basil is where it's at. I used an entire large container I found at Fry's for four dollars. Idk how many ounces that was but it was a lot. 
I used half in the sauce after adding the tomatoes. Roughly chopped. 
A little sugar salt pepper and garlic powder. I let that simmer 

Then I added about a cup of Pinot grigio. Amazing in this recipe. 
About a cup and half of heavy cream. More salt sugar and pepper to taste plus the rest of the roughly chopped basil and voila. Amazing creamy fatty pasta sauce. 

I topped with shrimps sauteed in butter garlic red pepper flakes and salt heavy cream and parmesan. Was divine last night.

Super easy. Delicious. Only changes were per other suggestions. More garlic (to taste - I used 2 cloves). I also used regular diced tomatoes and threw in some oregano, marjoram, and rosemary. I blended with an immersion blender after adding half and half and butter and the consistency was great. Not runny at all. Had dinner on the table in 30 minutes. This recipe is a keeper!!

My husband and daughter thought this was the best sauce they have ever had.  It is very rich.  Be warned though, this doesn't make a lot of sauce.  I needed to make it again to cover a full box of pasta. From now on, I know to double the recipe.

Loved it, I did follow suggestion of putting sauce into food processor. I did this returned to pan and added the cream. I then added some petit tomatoes drained. I have a family member who does not like onions hence the food processor . I added fresh basil at the end and withheld some of the dried basil. I may add some  pasta water if it’s too thick. I added cooked sausage and tossed with rigatoni noodles. I love how simple this was. It’s the kind of recipee that is a great base and then you can add what ever to make it your own. Pepper flakes, chicken, zucchini have at it!

Delicious!

I stayed close to the original recipe while taking a few repeated advices from the comments. I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1. I also substituted heavy cream for half and half to save on calories. Used a hand puree blender to get the sauce nice and creamy, just for preference.

Great sauce but way too much onion. I tripled it and used 2 onions and it was way too much. 1/3 onion for 5 servings should be much better.

Sauce was too thin and items were too chunky to be enjoyable. I should have processed it, but i don’t have a processor and the recipe didn’t call for it. Flavor was decent, but in the end it wasn’t worth the effort and the mess.

This is my go-to recipe, for years now, for a simple pasta sauce that I can make really quickly.  My only modifications, for personal preference, not that there is anything wrong with the recipe, is that I add about a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, and before I add the cream, I blend the tomato sauce so it's smooth.  It's really good without those mods though.  Thank you for so many years of the best pasta sauce ever!

Excellent sauce recipe. I make mine with coconut milk instead of cream and it tastes amazing on top of being healthier. Make sure you allow the sauce to boil long enough to remove most of the liquid from the can of diced tomatoes as otherwise the sauce will be too thin. The recipe says 5 minutes which is way too short in my experience.

I made this for my family last night, we also had my sister in law over.  It was a big hit with the whole group!  I made changes, like many of the other reviewers.  I did not use sugar.  Instead I drizzled balsamic vinegar in with the Italian diced tomatoes.  I used fresh basil from my garden and I used heavy cream in my sauce.  I also put Italian style Angus beef meatballs in mine, and served over Angel Hair pasta, salad on the side.  It was delish!  I am going to make this one again and again!  It is a great alternative to the same old red sauce, so tasty!  Thanks Kimber!

Definitely a keeper. I followed all the specified ingredients and found it to be a delicious blend.  This is one of those great recipes that can be used for any type of pasta. You can even add some Italian sausage and a bit of cayenne. Delicious!

I made this as written. I live in an RV and I am always looking for recipes I can make with pantry ingredients. I used Trader Joe’s shelf-stable whipped cream. The only fresh ingredients I needed were the onion and garlic, which I do keep on hand. Simple to make and my husband liked it. He said it tasted “fancy.”

I didn’t have basil or oregano but I used Italian seasoning and followed the rest of the recipe and stirred in some cooked macaroni pasta. It was delicious! I can’t wait to make it again and add some Parmesan cheese and chicken to it. It was so light and creamy, it’s definitely something I will be making often.

The huge chunks of tomato and onion detracted from the good flavor of the sauce. I was in a hurry and didn’t read the reviews , but next time, I will use a hand blender on it and use less onion.

I served this last night for 8 people.  It was delicious!!  I got rave reviews and everyone asked for the recipe.  The only thing different that I did was add shredded parmesan cheese to the sauce to thicken it up!!  YUMMY!!  Definitely will make this again!

Absolutely divine! I added a bit of red pepper flakes, a couple tablespoons of cream cheese, green beans, and a handful of halved cherry tomatoes (I like the freshness of them compared to only using canned). I will probably add more garlic or garlic powder next time. I love my garlic! Haha.

I was initially frightened by the amount of onion, so I did 1/2 and pureed my tomatoes (picky kids). But this was a super flavorful sauce! Yes. I will make it again! Great staple for pastas!

Hubby rated this as a five, which rarely happens. I think the only couple of things that I did differently from the original recipe, was I used 2 cans of the tomatoes, and I didn't put the cream and butter in until we were ready to eat it, which was 2 evenings later. I served this over cheese ravioli but next time will serve over tortellini.

I had higher hopes for this sauce. I was disappointed with the way it turned out; too sweet, and flavours did not blend nicely. I would not make this again.

This sauce wasn't much of a sauce--more like sautéed tomatoes and onion with cream over it. The flavor was okay but texturally was not great. I added 3 cloves of garlic and there still was no hint of garlic flavor. I also added Parmesan cheese at the end because I felt it was still lacking. And I didn't add the sugar because, do we really need sugar in everything these days? Blending it might help, but I still felt like it needed more depth of flavor.

I pureed the sauce before adding the cream and butter as my family likes a smooth sauce.  I also added fresh basil,4 cloves of garlic  and only 1/2 the sugar.

I liked how it tasted after I pureed it without the cream too will try this as a tomato sauce next time!!

yum! i love that i found this to make my own sauce. I do still buy the jars for days when i'm feeling lazy but there isnt much to getting this done so it's not a big deal to just throw things together. thank you for sharing .

Easy to make, quick meal, and very good. My extremely picky 7 year old even liked it!!! I will definitely make this again but will have to double the ingredients because it doesn't really make enough sauce for two adults and three small children.

I’ve made this MANY times. The first couple of times the sauce broke and was a weird texture, but this is because the time stated to evaporate most of the liquid from the tomatoes was too small. I typically leave the tomato mixture on heat for an extra 3-5 minutes. Using a hand blender is a must too!

Loved it! I used my stick blender to make it smooth,  also added a small  8oz can of tomato sauce. I served it over lobster ravioli. Delicious!

This was fantastic!  It reminded me of vodka sauce minus the vodka but better than any store bought version.  My only changes were using half an onion and following the recommendations to put the sauce in a blender to puree before adding the cream and butter.  I'm not a fan of tomato chunks in pasta sauce so the blender worked perfectly to smooth them out.  I would've never guessed such a high quality tasting sauce could be made so easily!

I have made this recipe twice now. Once, served over cheese tortellini, and last night, served with Penny pasta and cut up Italian sausage. I blended the sauce the first time, and didn’t the second time, and both ways were perfectly wonderful. This is such a good find. The addition of fresh basil at the end is really good, but I didn’t find it necessary. Still, it’s a great recipe to play with, but it’s wonderful just as is.

I tend to add a little more garlic and cream and then cook a little longer until the sauce is nice and thick.

I was worried it wouldn't be thick enough, but it was perfect! Added some cheddar cheese to it as well, really helped to pull it all together nicely. Also added a bit more cream, but yummy!

Really flavorful and delicious! I disagree with the assessment some reviewers have had that the sauce was "sweet;" it didn't taste any sweeter to me than similar sauces I've gotten on pasta dishes elsewhere. I do think it would benefit from being a little thicker, but it tasted so good on the pasta that I really didn't mind!

Loved this simple recipe!   Didn't have cream on hand so used 3/4 nonfat milk and 2 tbs of butter and 1/4 cup sour cream. Added red pepper and Parmesan for a kick!   This came out amazing!   Hubby loved it!

This was a hit at the dinner table, however I personally found it just a little bland. I did add 1 more garlic clove, and only used 1/4 tsp of sugar as per many reviews and it was sweet enough without being too sweet. Overall it tasted good, I just wanted more flavor from it.

I peeled the shrimp and sprinkled weber Cajon seasoning on them.  Sautéed 5 crushed garlic cloves and 1/2 chopped onion in olive oil.  Then I deglaze  the pan with some white wine and added 2 tsp butter.  I cooked that for a minute or so and I added a can of diced tomatoes and fresh basil.  I cooked that down until thicker...then added the cream and shrimp.   So so good.

Three stars is my honest review because it's a decent base, but it needs some work.

This sauce is way too sweet for my tastes. I halfed the sugar and it was still too sweet. The onion is sweet and so are the tomatoes and the cream! No sugar needed! Also, way too much onion. I'll either use a smaller onion next time or use half an onion. I used two cloves of garlic, but I think it could have used three. I also puréed the whole thing to give it a creamy texture. Other than all those changes, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! ;)

I used tomatoes I had frozen from my garden.  Hard to believe but I was out of basil.  I added extra garlic.  Used whole milk and added a little xantham gum to thicken it.  Added fresh mushroom, fresh chopped spinach and some left over chicken chopped up.  Excellent!

Super tasty sauce. The only thing I changed was that I skipped the sugar, added some Italian sausage, and threw in a can of tomato paste to make it thicker. Will definitely make this again.

This is really excellent. The only thing I did was to use fat-free evaporated milk instead of heavy whipping cream (which is something I do in any recipe). Still tastes delicious, but cuts down on the calorie and fat content. Even my picky eater loves this, and it's great over tortellini and ravioli.

I'll definitely make this again!  Took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar to 1/4 tsp, added 1/2 tsp of Italian spice (because my diced tomatoes were plain) and 3 cloves of garlic.  Delicious!  Thanks for this easy recipe.  Used it with Costco lobster raviolis.

I really like this recipe. I love italian tomato recipes so this was perfect for my pasta and chicken dish. I would recommend adding about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce BEFORE adding the heavy cream and butter. I also doubled this recipe because i didn't have a 14.5 ounce can and only had a 29 ounce can. It worked out perfectly. I loved it!

I didn't realize how sweet this sauce would be. It was like having syrup on pasta. Next time I make this, I'll use fresh herbs, more garlic, and no sugar.

My 11 year old granddaughter, Kortni, made this recipe today all by herself. She even chopped the onions and cooked the pasta by herself. It was quick and easy and it tasted great. She will definitely be making this again.

I doubled it and the creaminess got thicker. I also served it with homemade noodles and added some bacon! The noodles are called gnocchi! Loved it! Definitely a winner and keeper!

Really enjoyed this sauce. I did make a few tweaks because of taste preferences and ingredients that I had on hand. I used tomato sauce instead of Italian style diced tomatoes and I used half and half instead of cream. I heated the half and half and butter together on the stove before whisking it into the tomato sauce, to prevent any separation.

Excellent go-to pasta sauce. Very simple and quick to make and makes an amazing dinner that seems like you spent hours cooking. I was looking for a tomato cream sauce for with shrimp. Cooked the shrimp with the onions and garlic then set aside until the last step. I used an immersion blender like others to smooth out the sauce. Also added a splash of quality sweet vermouth. I used Carpano Antica Formula vermouth. Was very flavorful and thick. My husband absolutely loved it too.

this is one of our go-to recipes, the thinner consistency means  it's excellent over tortellini. (the heavy cream is what provides the body to this sause so if you are using a lighter fat option you may need to thicken it another way.) We add extra garlic and fresh herbs when we can but otherwise use this recipe as written.

Had about 2 1/2 C of cherry tomatoes sitting there, telling me they weren't gonna last much longer so used them.  
Other than that, totally followed it, did take the advice of others & blended it so it was smooth.  Maybe a bit more cream than was called for, 18%.  Awesome!  Will definitely make it again~

I adapted this recipe slightly, and it was incredible. I always use a drop or two of a hot pepper infused olive oil in addition to whatever olive oil is called for to give a tiny kick. I don't use garlic, bc I'm oddly allergic, but the onions do the trick for me with flavor. At the end (before the heavy cream) I use an immersion blender. When I get to the heavy cream and butter, I also add grated parmesan and top it off with some fresh basil. 
I've also added (cooked) ground meat to this as well, after the sauce is complete.

This sauce is delicious!!   Because I am a vegetarian , I like a chunkier textured sauce to compensate for the lack of meat so I added diced red and yellow peppers and chose to follow the recipe and not purée.   I did add a little flour as a thickening agent.   I also added crushed red pepper flakes and parsley along with the basil and  Oregano.  Served with penne pasta topped with Parmesan cheese.   Will be making this on a regular!!

This recipe was delicious!  I had to substitute the Italian diced tomatoes for stewed tomatoes, and only used half an onion, but my husband and daughter loved it as much as I did. Next time I will have to double the recipe since it made less than I expected.

This was rather tasty. As per other reviews, the consistency was a little thin, but not much. This recipe, as well as the flavors and consistency, was very close to a tomato cream soup I make. So much so, this recipe could be made as a soup.

I made a couple of minor changes: 1-2 additional garlic cloves  because I love it. I added Italian seasonings instead of the basil and oregano because that is what I had on hand. It is a lot of seasoning and could be cut down. I added some tomato sauce  (1 cup or so left over from Sunday dinner) and added extra cream (perhaps 3/4 - 1 cup total) to tone down the flavors from the herbs. DEFINITELY blend it; I used a stick blender.

My 5 year-old and 3 year-old loved it. My 2 year-old did not. I like it and would make it again.

Loved it! This is my new favorite quick pasta sauce recipe. Instead of heavy cream, I used Neufchâtel cheese (like cream cheese, but healthier) and a little bit of milk for a richer flavor. I also puréed mine after cooking because I like a thinner texture. Next time I might only purée 3/4 to keep some of the tomatoes in the sauce.

Loved it! My tomatoes didn't have Italian seasoning so I just added more basil and oregano. I crushed the tomatoes more as they were cooking. I only added half an onion and 1 clove of garlic but next time I'll use more of both. I didn't add the sugar.

Made this recipe twice, and both times were amazing. Next time I think I'll puree the tomato. I do add extra milk, and let it simmer longer than 5 minutes to thicken. 

Served over lobster razvoil.

I'm in the middle of the mountains in Central America, and I wanted tomato cream pasta today. I ended up chopping up three fresh tomatoes in place of the canned ones, and I used a handful of powdered milk and a big squeeze of mantequilla in place of the heavy cream. I also added a dash of flour like some if the other reviewers said. It was so, so good. I'm making another batch tonight to take to school tomorrow.

My family loved this! When my toddler is asking for pasta, he's referring to this sauce over noodles! The only thing is I didn't have an onion on hand so I substituted onion powder, dried basil, and used already minced garlic instead of fresh. Again, what I had on hand. It still turned out awesome. I also doubled this recipe for we felt there just wasn't enough sauce and we wanted leftovers. Thanks so much for this recipe. This is definitely a delicious sauce we go for that takes so little time!

This sauce is absolutely delicious; I always double the recipe and freeze some for later! I always double the garlic, and loved it here, but only do that if you're a garlic fanatic like me! I also used half the onion, and puréed the sauce in a blender, as recommended by other users. Loved the smooth, creamy result!

With some changes, this sauces is delicious.  I used Prego pasta sauce instead of dice tomatoes, fresh oregano and basil, half an onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic, a cup of heavy cream, a teaspoon of sugar, and 2 table spoon of chopped sun dried tomatoes halves.

"Mom, you can make this again. " To me,  that's the best compliment! I used low fat half and half instead of the cream.  I used an immersion  blender to smooth out the sauce.  Flavor was EXCELLENT! I grilled Italian sausage and garnished/placed one on the side for my teenaged boys. j

I made this recipe which I would give 4 stars.  I made some changes (added chicken, skipped the sugar, used two cans of tomatoes, and added chicken base.  It made several meals.  Fantastic.

This is the first pasta sauce I made from scratch... And it is amazing! Very easy to make. I only had half an onion, as it looked a lot bigger than usual. I make my own pasta from scratch, and now I have the perfect sauce to go with it.

I loved it! It was just not enough for my box of penne pasta. Next time I'll double the recipe! Love it though! Didn't change a thing which is unusual for me. I usually add something or change out an item. Just perfect!

This was a great start for a simple homemade pasta sauce.  I used 4 fresh tomatoes, peeling and dicing before adding to the garlic & onions.  I then pureed like other reviewers had recommended.  I like my whole fat cream, so I added a little more than half cup, and also added a dallop of cream cheese.  With these amounts it was enough sauce for the family dinner with no left overs.  Kids loved it and everyone had seconds!

Have made this recipe 3 times in the last month because I love it so much. It was the first time cooking for my boyfriends family and I made this sauce to go with elbow noodles, and they all had a second helping! However I did add a little more tomato than what the recipe called for. And I also added Parmesan the second time around and it just enhanced it that much more. Definitely one of my favourites.

I used 3/4 c skim milk instead of heavy cream since that's what I had on hand. I put all ingredients in the blender and it was very good with Mushroom Ravioli.

Made a second time  as instructed. This is so good!

I didn't have the Italian tomatoes on hand so I used Rotel Tomatoes with Chilis....Yumm.  It added just a little something extra to it.  I did add a wee bit of flour to thicken as it was still a little runny. I simmered a couple of chicken breasts in broth, saving the broth.  I then shredded the chicken and added to the  sauce.  Cooked the pasta (I used penne) in the broth for additional flavor.  Served sauce over pasta and enjoyed!  It was a quick, easy, yet tasty meal.

Awesome sauce, worthy of many repeats in our house! So easy to make, too! I didn't have any dried basil so, nor Italian seasoned canned tomatoes, so I just added Italian seasoning and some extra oregano to taste .  Family doesn't like tomato chunks so I took the immersion blender to it. I tripled the recipe, and it fed us 2 nights with the rest going to the freezer for a super-easy weeknight dinner. Served with fettuccine, grilled chicken breast slices and a side salad. YUM!

I made this for my family the other night and everyone is still raving about it! For the most part I followed the directions, except I doubled the garlic and added tomato paste to help thicken it. I also added meat 1/2 pork 1/2 beef to make it a bolognese sauce.  You will not be disappointed. What are you waiting for, go make it! ??

This was an awesome sauce very tasty, made it just as recipe described no substitutions, I did use a hand blender to make it a bit smoother to hide the onion from my daughter, she loved it.  Served it over Penne Pasta was really great.

I've used a similar recipe in the past. The only differences I noticed are I don't use sugar, and I use fresh basil. I've added grilled chicken strips to the sauce before, and usually serve it tossed with a pasta dish, such as penne.

I didn't have any onions, so I used dried minced onions.  I used half and half because that was what I had on hand.  All in all quite tasty, and I will use a fresh onion next time.  Also, I think I will use tomato puree next time, I didn't care for the chunks.

This is a really good pasta sauce...very easy to make.  I live in Mexico where canned tomatoes are not available except at Costco which is located 2.5 hours from where I live.  Not a problem.  I sauteed the onion and garlic for a few minutes. I cut up 3 fresh Roma tomatoes in small chunks and sauteed them with the onion .  I blended 4 Roma tomatoes to a lumpy consistency and added that to the sauteed onion, garlic and fresh tomatoes.  Once that was reduced a bit, I stirred in the cream and seasonings.  Skip the sugar!

Easy, simple and very good.  I added Italian seasoning and Herbs de Provence because I did not have Italian style diced tomatoes. My sauce seemed a little thin so I added 2 tbs tomato sauce. Delicious! Will make again.

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe--except for the onion and dried herbs--to coat one-and-a-half pounds of pasta (medium shells) as a main course for my family and the proportions were just right. Made a ton, great next day leftovers. Despite using canned tomatoes, it still felt like a much elevated dish from the routine jar sauce, which I often will "upgrade" with the addition of some cream.

Will definitely make again.  Used a stick blender to make it less chunky. Made some meatballs and had this over them with garlic bread.  Didn't even need pasta.  Add a salad and you're done.  Yum!

I made this today  with minor modifications to suit personal preference and used it to make a delicious eggplant parmesan.   Per a few other reviewers' suggestions, I used a can of organic diced tomatoes (all I had in the pantry) and half-and-half instead of heavy cream, half a small red onion, two cloves garlic and fresh basil, since I had it on hand, half teaspoon sugar.  Added some dried oregano and Italian seasoning.  Pureed mixture in Magic Bullet.  Very tasty, silky texture, excellent for layering with sliced, baked eggplant and fresh mozzarella.  Yummy!

After reading some of the comments, I adjusted the sugar (just used to taste) and added red bell pepper & mushrooms. Added some shrimp just before adding cream. It was delicious!!!

This is very good.  I did, however, use evaporated milk in place of heavy cream.  I would definitely share this recipe with my friends.

This is the closest to a Bolognese sauce as I've ever made.  Very good, very easy...husband loved it.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used fat free half & half.  I put tomato paste in it to thicken it. Next time I will use the heavy cream.  I believe that might make a difference.  Other than that...I did exactly as recipe said.  I made a double recipe...had enough to left to freeze for a quick dinner another night.  (I, too, put in blender...such a difference!)

Very good sauce, and like many others, I made changes.  I didn't add any cream or milk, used a combination of fresh & dried basil, added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, a sprinkle of chili peppers & grated several tablespoons of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese into the sauce and let it simmer for 30 minutes.  Will definitely make it again.

This is a very nice sauce. I have made similar for many years. It is yummy over gnocchi. People are afraid of cream and butter. Don't be. Fat does not make you fat. Quite the opposite, it gives you energy and  keeps you satiated, but blend it into a creamy sauce. I have also made it with fresh tomatoes from the garden.

Agree, absolutely delicious!  Instead of canned tomatoes used diced garden tomatoes and garden fresh basil and oregano and a bit less onion and sugar..
Followed the spirit of the recipe, but simmered longer than five minutes until it thickened up.  Measured the cream and butter exactly, mixed it in and served with twist pasta.
Definitely a keeper recipe, and a good one to use when you get a lot of garden tomatoes at once (which usually happens :-)

Very tasty recipe
Stands up to hearty pasta shapes
In response to other reviews, if it's too thin... Cook it a little longer, different canned tomatoes can have more water than others
Same thing with sugar, use as much or little depending on your tomatoes, sugar helps with the acid 
If your basil tastes funny, check the date on the bottle, it's probably  3 years old, or grow some in a bucket
My kids love it just like the recipe

I used Pomi tomatoes instead of a product that comes in a can. That cut out the preservatives and extra salt. I had to add my own Italian seasoning , but as others have noted that works well.  I made it using my blender to make it smooth. The sauce tastes great.  It is not too sweet and can be used in anyway you want.

I have made this recipe a few times.  However I cut back on the basil (1 Tsp, instead of 1 Tbls) , and I used rotel tomatoes to give it a little zip, and added cooked diced chicken breast to the sauce.  Its DELICIOUS!!

I will never buy Creamy Tomato Pasta Sauce again! This sauce is so good.  The flavors blend well and it's superb.  I added the seasonings with the onion and garlic  and let them steam together before adding the tomatoes.  I will probably use fresh basil and oregano next time but it was fine with dried herbs. After the sauce was cooked, I added in a bag of brown rice Rigatoni and coated the pasta with the sauce. Excellent meal.

Doubled the recipe, tripled the garlic, subbed whole milk for cream, added garlic powder (1/2 teaspoon for doubled recipe), added parmesan cheese (1/2 cup for doubled recipe) and blended it.   Would add some Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and more milk next time for more fluid texture.  Looking for flavor profile of Bucca di Beppo's spicy tomato cream sauce.

First time:  Really good. I used chopped fresh tomatoes. Like others, I used my immersion blender to blend everything before adding the cream. Once I added some grated mixed Italian cheese at the end, it elevated to 5 stars.
2nd/3rd times - Have also left it chunky which is good too!  At the end I added 2-3 big handfuls of fresh spinach, tossed it all with angel hair pasta, and it was amazing.

I have been using this exact recipe for 6 years and it is always spot on perfect. Unless I get a little excited about the cream and add too much, but that's my own fault. It is spectacular !!!!

This is quite a simple recipe, and very good! I quickly mixed this together and threw it over some pasta in a pinch, and voila! Dinner is served.

Way too much onion. It took over the sauce. I would definitely cut back next time I make it.

This recipe was great. I sautéed the onions until they were soft then put the garlic in with the oregano salt sugar and pepper and let that cook for about a minute before I put in the tomatoes.  I also used 3 tablespoons of fresh basil instead of dried and put that in with the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again.

I wanted something a little different and this really fit the bill. I didn't have diced tomatoes on hand so instead used tomato purée. Made the sauce a little thicker and there was no need to put it in the blender! Perfect consistency! I frankly like full fat in my meals (full flavor) so I put in both the cream and the butter. It was a family hit. Will definitely make it again!

The recipe does not say how much pasta this sauce will cover. I used 6 ounces of penne and it was just enough. Taste was good.

It was a great recipe. I didn't have cream so i used 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3rd cup of butter and it turned out great :) going to try it again with actual cream next time and maybe it'll go from like to love.

Made sauce as written but omitted sugar and onions.  Added ground turkey w/onions.  Next time I will double the recipe.  Only served 3 as written.

This was fantastic.  Next time we won't skimp on the onion and we'll add a little flour to thicken it but the taste was awesome.

I too used 1/2 an onion, 1/2 n 1/2 instead of cream, more garlic, added italian seasoning, oregano and used a hand blender to break up the tomatoes, but i also added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Family loves it and its really easy to make

I added a little more tomato sauce to get the color in it since the heavy cream washed it out. I also ended up adding a little more salt/pepper and red crushed pepper of course :-) 
Made with chicken. Finger-licking-good!

This is similar to another recipe on this site:  Bow Ties w/ Sausage, Tomatoes and Cream.  While the other recipe is very good, I am not a huge meat (especially pork) eater and therefore this recipe is a good vegetarian option.  As with other reviewers, I added some additional veggies - in my case, mushrooms and red pepper strips.  I also added a full carton of cream (one cup rather than half a cup) just to ensure it got used up.  (Definitely more fattening, but I prefer that to waste!)  And I added an additional clove of garlic because my husband and I LOVE garlic.  Easy and flavourful, I'll be sure to put this one on the rotation.

I love this recipe (and so does my fiance)!  I have made it several (hundred) times by now and I never deviate from the original recipe.  I notice that a lot of people have an issue with the sweetness to the tomatoes, but I have a huge sweet tooth, so the sweetness didn't bother me as much.  As far as the "thin" consistency goes, I usually let mine set for a minute or two before serving, it thickens right up.

I think it is important to adhere to a recipe, but it is always fun to add you own zest to the recipe! Changes: I added more garlic  since I'm a garlic lover.  To bring a little more kick to the recipe, I added a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. I do not like added sugar to any kind of sauce I make, so I omitted that (probably why it wasn't too sweet like other people stated). I did not have Italian flavored diced tomatoes, so I used plain and added fresh basil (along with the dried basil).  I added more salt and pepper as well. For a protein boost, I added Italian seasoned grill chicken and served it over penne. My fiancé and I thought it was very yummy.  I will definitely make this again!

Doubled the recipe
Added 1 lb. ground buffalo
Used Italian seasoning instead of dried basil & oregano
Used Spice World Minced Garlic instead of garlic cloves

Suggestion for next time:  ease up on sugar, add a bit more salt

Pretty much awesome!

I was missing the basil, oregano and sugar as I am in the middle of moving and had already packed it all.  After reading the reviews I had wanted to blend it to make it smoother but alas the blender was packed as well.  So I went with everything else and added some chopped bacon to cook with the onions and garlic.  It came out superb.  I don't mind the chunky tomatoes and onion.  Can't wait to try it with the added seasonings.  Would probably add some mushrooms next time.  Will definitely need to double or triple the recipe if you are using it for a main dish sauce.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe.. Contrary to what a lot of post said, I LOVED the chunky taste of the sauce, it was so different from all the other pasta sauce recipes. and a huge thank you to the person who posted about removing pan from heat before adding cream.. I am not a very experience cook and I am sure that saved  me.

Nice change from regular pasta sauces.  My daughter really enjoyed this.  It doesn't make enough sauce - would recommend doubling or even tripling the amount.

This was insanely amazing as a base to add your own kind of seasoning and make something really special.WARNING: this only makes enough sauce for about two people, so if you're cooking for a family adjust accordingly. When I made it, I added Cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch, and more black pepper (I'm a huge fan of spicy food!).

Used garlic salt instead of a clove, just sprinkled a generous amount over onion. I used a 796 ml can of tomatoes and after the water boiled out I mashed them lightly to make the pieces smaller, which worked well. At the end I threw in some leftover Romano cheese and some Parmesan too, very yummy. Omitted the basil because I ran out and had none in the house. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream which was fine, I didn't measure, just poured in until looked nice and creamy.

This is the sauce I've been looking for. Tastes like the creamy tomato sauce I get in restaurants. 

I only made minor changes:
whole tomatoes -> canned tomato sauce
3 cloves garlic
2 tsp basil
pulverized the onion in the food processor
cooked over low heat for ~90 min

My 5 year old loved it even though I added chicken. It was pretty good, but after eating leftovers once, I wasn't up for eating it a third time. She ate it three times though. I used light sour cream instead of the heavy cream, which may have affected it for me.

I followed Michael E's review and suggestions but I did add about 2 tsp organic sugar and used my basil and oregano essential oils to season, it was delicious. I added a can of the fire roasted diced tomatoes (because that's what I had), I probably won't use them next time. I have enough extra sauce to use it on baked ravioli that was suggested by another reviewer.

I had the pasta and needed a quick and easy recipe for sauce. This recipe saved the day. Super quick and easy to make.
From one of the reviews I caught that someone had pureed their tomato sauce in the end, I did the same with a hand blender and it turned out super! 
Most importantly,  my husband really enjoyed it. I added some chopped fried sausages in too at the end. I highly recommend this recipe.
Thank you!

This was great. Served over pasta with some Chicken Apple Cherry Sausage. Used frozen garden tomatoes. Had left overs that I just added extra liquid to the next night. Just as good second night too!

This is fantastic. Its kind of sweet so i add some red pepper flakes to it. I also throw some shrimp in at the last minute.  This is usually made twice during the monthly rotation.

Ill  definitely make it again. I used skim milk to reduce fat so I didn't get that creamy sauce as the picture shows (even after adding a little flour). Good but kinda bland at 1st. . I squeezed a whole lemon in the sauce and it made all the difference in the world. Even left the whole lemon sit in the sauce over night (in frig) and it was amazing!!!!

It was good I used my blended because I like my sause smooth and creamy. But the taste was fantastic.  Also I use almond milk in place of heavy cream . As for this Emly person she said she didn't like it but made it twice and is going to make it again. Unreal she must have it out for the person that made the dish and gave us the recipe.  I don't know either person I am way down south in La.

Excellent recipe! As written, it is gluten free. If you must substitute for heavy cream, has anyone tried using evaporated skimmed milk? This is an old standby alternative to add texture of heavy cream in sauces without fat that doesn't alter flavor. I haven't tried it in this but think I will for at least part of the heavy cream to see if it works. For those who don't like the chunky consistency, try crushed tomatoes & add the extra Italian seasoning. I like this recipe as is, though. I think any type of meat from chicken to Italian sausage could be added as well! This is a keeper!

I prefer using fresh ingredients whenever I can. I used diced fresh Romano (plum) tomatoes & fresh basil -so much better!  I left out the onion & sugar.  I also substituted goat cheese for the cream & served the sauce over spaghetti squash. This healthy recipe is delish as a side or main dish!! P.S. Always add your fresh basil right before serving.

I have always believed that, in cooking tomatoes, sugar is essential.  I actually use more than in the recipe.  
This is now a huge favourite with my wife for whom I cook!

This was absolutely delicious.  I went to an italian restaurant and ordered chicken parmesan- the spaghetti had a different sauce on it than the chicken- and it stole the show! I found out that it was a tomato cream sauce and immediately went looking for a way to make something similar. I made this exactly as directed with some additional pepper (my personal taste). It was amazing. My only regret is that I did not make more! Definitely delicious!

Easy, quick and yummy. I made four small changes here:  I used two garlic cloves, instead of one.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and smoothed half my sauce in the blender, so it still had a little chunkiness but not too much. After I added the butter, I tasted it and thought the sauce needed a little more tomato taste, so I opened a can of tomato sauce I had on hand and added a few tablespoons to the cream sauce before the last simmering step. Last, I added perhaps a half tablespoon of flour to thicken the sauce a bit (I did not measure exactly; just eyeballed it).  Very pleased with this.

I agree that the sauce is a little thin, but it's an awesome way to have a creamy sauce without vodka. I made this with poached shrimp, diced tomatoes and mushrooms. Great post-workout meal.

Such a great recipe!! The only changes I did was not to add the onions, garlic, and sugar. I did add a little bit of cooking white wine to the tomatoes, while they cook. The wine gives it a fresher taste, and my husband just loves it.

This was delicious!  I used a little less sugar.  I used half and half since that's what I had.  Added a table spoon of flour.  And added Italian sausage,  since my husband needs some tyyof meat with his food.  It was great.  He asked for seconds and asked to have that for his birthday meal!

I thought it was really good! I used a combo of sun-dried tomatoes and fresh tomatoes as well as used flavored olive oil and it really turned out well.  I thought the texture was perfect for a pasta sauce.

LOVE this stuff!!!  Only change I make is so use either plain diced tomatoes or the garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes (I reduce the garlic or leave it out all together if I use the garlic tomatoes).  There's something I don't like about the Italian seasoned variety, just a personal taste.  Do NOT leave out the sugar, it makes such a huge difference.  Reduces the acidity of the tomatoes and takes away that "canny" taste.  It does not make it sweet, so don't be afraid.  DELICIOUS.

Delicious!  I decided to make chicken Parmesan for dinner and decided to make homemade pasta sauce for it. Boy am I glad I did!  I followed advice from fellow cooks and only used half an onion.  I ran out of minced garlic, so I sauté the onion first and added garlic powder in with the rest of the ingredients. To cut down on calories, I used half-and-half. Double the recipe!  You won't be sorry!

Very good, quick and easy. I doubled the recipe for 1 lb of pasta and could have maybe even used a little bit more. I did add a bit of flour at the end to thicken it up. It was delicious and sweet and will make this again!

Made it twice. The first time I messed up and it looked super funky.. The second time I followed directions and for some reason it still had a weird texture and didn't make as much as I thought. . It has good flavor just not sure if I'll made it again. Husband liked it   atleast

Delicious. I didn't use an onion, used just regular tomato sauce, and doubled the recipe.  We will definitely use this again. Reminds me of my favorite dish at an Italian restaurant we go to. Yum!

I made this pretty much exactly as written other than not actually measuring the ingredients and using just regular diced tomatoes.  This is the sauce I have been looking for! I always found homemade tomato sauces to be too acidic no matter what I added.  This was absolutely delicious.  My kids liked it as did my mother. I will definitely make this again. I can't see making any other ever again :)  Thanks Kimber!

I added sliced yellow and orange bell pepper as well as a pinch of red pepper flakes to this recipe. Served over a trio of vegetarian ravioli- was a huge hit.

Really fast and easy dinner from ingredients I already have on hand!  I doubled (ok maybe tripled the garlic) and I used half and half instead of heavy cream!  Also used a hand blender at the end to slightly puree it . I think it wouldn't be as good otherwise!  We gobbled this up with crumbled sausage and penne pasta! It only served 4 of us so I would definitely double this recipe for leftovers or seconds!

It tasted amazing. However I felt copious amounts of herbs to be able to actually taste taste the flavor.  I also didn't appreciate that the cream had a slightly grainy look and texture.

Delicious!!! I used a bit less cream as I don't like sauces that are too heavy. I also blended it as my son and husband don't like chunky sauces. Surprisingly enough, my husband (who doesn't usually like tomato sauces) has requested that I make this again and said he'd prefer this over any store bought sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good recipe. I didn't have canned tomatoes or an onion, so I used fresh tomatoes and left the onion out. I also used my immersion blender to puree the tomato/spices before adding the cream and butter. Will definitely make this again.

I just finished making this sauce and put it over tortellini. It was amazing! Puree in a blender is a must. Flavor and consistency is night and day. I will be making it again.

I made it almost exactly as listed but blended it like others said. To me, it was lacking flavor, so I added Italian seasoning. If I make this again I will use half an onion instead of a whole onion. It was way too much! And I will also omit the sugar. This had a weird sweet taste to it. I'm sure with these changes it will be a 4 or 5 star.

I love this sauce recipe. My husband asks for it all the time. It takes way longer to cook off most of the liquid than 5 minutes. I always let it cook for a while, until the liquid is mostly gone, before I add the cream and butter. At the end I always add parmesan and whatever other cheeses I have to make it cheesy. So yummy.

This recipe was delicious!! This is the first time I tried it and was very surprised. However, I did make a few adjustments because I didn't have a few ingredients. I had to dice regular tomatoes and add tomato sauce and I also didn't have heavy cream so I just used whole milk instead. The dish tastes like it was missing something and the sauce didn't come out as think as I hoped but that was prob due to not having all the right ingredients. I would deff recommend this and make this again but the right way. Delicious tho!

Wow!  So easy...and so fabulous!   This is one of the best smelling dishes I ever made.   I fried up some turkey kielbasa with the onions, then when the tomatoes came to a boil, I added some tortellini and cooked until they softened.  After that, the cream and some shredded cheese.  Easy one pot meal that the family DEVOURED.   I felt pretty cool being able to say I made it from scratch instead of from a jar.  This is a serious WIN.

My husband is sometimes a picky eater, but let me just tell you he absolutely loves this!  The first time and every time after making this, I have used a Vidalia onion, partially because that's pretty much all we use.  I will have to try a "regular" yellow onion sometime just to see what the difference is. But the vidalias give it that much more sweetness to cut the amount of sugar added. I also use WAY more than one clove of garlic.  Ours is an Irish/Welsh household but you'd swear some weeks we were Italian!

I made this last night and I am still thinking about it. The dish was easy and wonderful. I omitted the sugar as the onions provided sweetness. I used stewed tomatoes and a squirt of tomato paste for richness. Otherwise just followed the recipe as written. The sauce had a lovely consistency...I did not use a blender for the sauce. My husband was blown away by the taste and presentation. One tip...I used FRESH fettucini from the dairy section of the grocery. This made the dish as it was delicate. The next time I make this (which will be soon) I may add lobster at the end. Thanks you for a great vegetarian recipe.

Great! I substituted 1/3 pkg (roughly) of cream cheese instead of heavy cream. I got a slightly heavier sauce than what I think this recipe intended, but it was what I had in the house.

I make this with only 1/2 the onion, add about a half cup of red wine, add cooked Italian sausage at the end and serve it over tortellini.  Amazing!!

Such a simple recipe has no right to taste this good!  Made as is, it is spectacular!  I occasionally add some fresh baby spinach or chopped mushrooms.  I've also grilled chicken tenders with Italian herbs and balsamic glaze and served them on top of the sauce.  I've used the sauce with cheese ravioli--Belissima!!  I've used herbs d'Province, fresh herbs and Italian herb paste--you just cannot screw this up!  Thank you Kimber, for taking my limited Italian menu to a whole new level!

I tried it per the recipe. Too sweet. I wish I hadn't added the sugar. After realizing it was too sweet, I did add fresh basil, more herbs, salt, pepper and a couple splashes of hot sauce.  I am glad I used a mix of crushed and pureed tomatoes because I think the consistency with the diced would have been too chunky.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. I always make a double batch in hopes of taking leftovers to work. But I have 3 teenagers who ate every single bite. What I had of this recipe was delicious. My kids request this once a week. I couldn't be more pleased with its ease and quickness. Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe!!!

I really liked this recipe and will be making it often, since I almost always have all of the ingredients in my pantry. I added mushrooms late (when reducing after adding the tomatoes) because I almost forgot them and totally misread that it called for 1 Tablespoon of basil and just used 1 teaspoon. I liked having the chunky tomatoes. I would maybe add a bit more cream and definitely double this recipe if I were cooking for more than just myself. It makes enough sauce for me to have a plate for dinner and a plate of leftovers. If I were a more normal person I could maybe stretch it to three, but there's no way this makes five normal person servings.

The only substitutions I made were based on what I had on hand (onion powder-no onions) and personal preference, (brown sugar over white), everything else was as is.  I loved it. I made sure the tomatoes were boiled down before adding the cream and butter.  I had it over spaghetti with leftover chicken on top from a previous tomato based recipe.

Loved it! I cooked angel hair pasta and a spinach  and other greens blend in olive oil with sea salt. My presentation was pasta with this sauce on top and the greens around the perimeter . I topped it with parmasean cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  I made this on  Ash Wednesday an alternative for a meatless meal. I can see. Adding shrimp or Italian sausage in for variation .

I loved this recipe. I made the recipe as written except followed other commenters advice and added less sugar and thickened the sauce slightly with flour. Such a nice flavor yet easy and fast.

My Independent Living class made this today - they loved it as well as the adults who were lucky enough to get some! We had Parmesan to sprinkle on top and I would definitely recommend adding it, Mozzarella would be good too.

Wonderfully rich and creamy.  One hint to help thicken the sauce is to add a bit of grated parmesan cheese at the end if it isn't thick enough. That will thicken it without worrying about a "floury" taste.

Excellent sauce! It complimented our spinach/kale raviolis perfectly! the only change I made, however, was to use a can of plain tomato sauce instead of the can of diced tomatoes...it still came out delicious!

Fantastic recipe.  Followed recipe exactly as presented with the exception of using three garlic cloves, instead of one, and adding chicken.

I served it with penne pasta and a salad on the side.  I will add this to my keeper file!  Thanks for the recipe, Kimber!

I thought it was great, very tasty. My family suggested perhaps next time I could add some diced cooked Pancetta to the sauce with the butter and cream. I will try that.

The whole family liked this recipe.  My two-year-old and five-year-old picked around the tomatoes, so I will run it through the food processor next time, as others have suggested.  I cooked some mild Italian sausage separately, added it during the last 5 minutes, added penne pasta when the sauce was finished, and stirred it all together.  My husband asked me if it was a different sauce from what I usually make (which comes from a jar), and I told him it was homemade.  He said it was really good, and then asked if I was serious about it being homemade.  He was impressed.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Bonus that I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.

This recipe is excellent as is. I did not find it runny at all. Just do not exceed by too much the cooking time that will make your sauce runny as the oils start separating even more with the heat. If you want to "cook more" your sauce only do this when cooking the tomatoes and add the time to the desired chunky or thickness by time lapses of 5 minutes. I also think that without the cream this makes for a good chunky tomato sauce for pasta. 
Someone suggested to omit the sugar. Well, the sugar is necessary for balancing the acidity of the tomatoes. When I cooked this sauce I rectified the salt.

I made sure I simmered the tomatoes for quite some time to thicken it up really nicely. I had this with beef ravioli and it was DIVINE!

Simply yum!  Simple and quick to make.  Tasty and filling; served over a mixture of orecchie and wild garlic fettuccine.   I only added a pinch of baking soda to cut the bitter tomato taste and I used San Marzano whole tomatoes and cut them up with the juice.  So flavorful - and the leftovers were even better as it gave the ingredients a chance to meld.

Bpth my children and my friends liked this dish. I diced real tomatoes and added Italian spices.  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the recipe, pureed it with a hand-held blender, and used half and half instead of cream.  It wss a bit runny and I will definitely add tomato paste next time.

This recipe intrigued me so I tried it except I used fresh tomatoes and was quite disappointed with the overall result. It was bland, dull, flat. I had to then try to add some notable taste to it so added extra salt (no big help)then added crushed red pepper (eh, okay)fresh parsley, (better but still eh). It didn't need the sugar at all and I wish I didn't add that since the onions were sweet enough. I love the concept of a fresh tomato cream sauce so I will keep reworking this till I get it where I think the flavor should be at.

I chopped up about 5 fresh tomatoes instead of using canned. Delicious! Also, I put in blender to smooth the sauce. After blending, returned to pan and added sliced grilled hot Italian sausage.

I made the recipe exactly as written other than I pureed the ingredients in my food processor first.  After I tasted the sauce when it was ready to serve, I was disappointed.  I think maybe the basil was a little overpowering and it definitely needed more salt for my family.  I added a little more cream to tone it down some, salt and pepper and served it over grilled Italian sausage and bowtie pasta.  Probably won't make again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  Super easy to make.  I needed another reason to keep heavy cream in the house! :)

If you have a tomato hater like I do, you can substitute 1/2 jar sauce and let it cook down until thick.

I have been making a sauce like this for years but don't add sugar and use half & half.  Fresh ingredients definitely are preferred if available and my favorite add ingredient is cooked salmon.  I buy a little extra when making salmon for dinner just for this reason.

Easy, quick and tasty. What could be better for a week night dinner. With a salad and wine, Wow!  One thing I did was to cut the sugar by half. And I added about 3 tbls of pasta water to help thicken.

I loved this recipe. I prepared the recipe as written except I added fresh chopped basil as a garnish on each serving. The consistency was just right and the flavor was fresh and light. Because I had leftover cream, I made it two nights in a row, but on the second night I used fire roasted tomatoes. I really couldn't tell much difference. On the first night, the dish was an entree and on the second evening it was a side served with chicken breast.

My 16 year old son loved this and even ate the leftover right out of the pan with bread.  It was really east and tasty.  I made minor adjustments.  I put in 1 cup of cream instead of half a cup and I added a 1/4 cup of shredded italian cheeses.  I like that this is a sauce that can be tailored making it a little different for the type of pasta or the type of eater.  I can take or leave meat but my boys are definitely carnivores.  So I can see adding some shrimp or chicken for them.  I sauce comments about the sauce being runny, it just takes longer than the 5 minutes stated in the recipe for the liquid to evaporate.  If you cook it for 10 minutes you will have almost not liquid when you add the cream.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe, I followed the recipe, but used half and half and cut the butter in half. I choose rotini pasted for thus. I cooked the pasta according to the box, the I combined the sauce and pasta sprinkled with 5 cheese and a little coby and jack for a little color and baked in 350 for about 10-15mins. Served with backed chicken and mixed vegetables. Delicious

I'm not sure what I did wrong because I followed the recipe to a "T" but the sauce separated when I added the butter and cream and it wasn't very appealing looking.  Also, 1T of basil was WAAAAAY too much.  I should've trusted my instinct on that one.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled it and made the dollowing changes: I used fresh tomatoes- peeled and diced and added Italian seasoning (had a lot of tomatoes from my farm co-op).  Pureed for smoother consistency.  Also subbed fat-free half and half for the heavy cream.  (Probably would have had a little better consistency had I not done this, but it was still excellent.). I'll make this again the same way, but I think I'll add some tomato paste to give it a little more density.  Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe 3 times exactly as called for and also using some other people's tips, I've put it in a food processor to smooth it out, I've left it chunky, I just don't like it. It's an odd consistency either way and the blend of seasonings just doesn't work for me. It's sweet with an odd spiciness, I'll have to keep looking..

I felt that this really only made 4 servings tops.  I added 1/4 cup white wine after the shallot and garlic, but before the tomatoes.  Puréed for better texture, use fresh basil, and deleted the sugar.

This recipe is great!  My whole family loves it, even my pickiest kid.  I like to use 4 cloves of garlic.  Purée with emulsion blender after adding cream to finish it off. I always double it for 6 - 8 servings.  Great over cheese ravioli or tortellini.

Great Sauce! The end result was a little too sweet for me, so I added another 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning to balance it out.

This was awesome! Only thing I did different was double the servings; and whisk a tablespoon of flour into sauce after butter & heavy cream. I served sauce over lump crab meat & noodles. My son said its one of the best things I've ever made!!! A keeper!

This sauce is wonderful !!!!  It's a keeper for me.  I didn't have Italian tomatoes and substituted regular canned diced tomatoes and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning (my homemade from the Food Channel) and this is delightful.  I will use this every chance I get.

Thanks for an inspiring vegetarian dish!  I would improve it by removing the dairy and in its place use earth balance spread and coconut cream which is delicious and much healthier.   To get the cream, keep your can of coconut milk in fridge, 24 hrs minimum, the cream will rise to the top and you can scoop it off!

Really liked this recipe! I made mine with tomato sauce instead of a can of diced italian tomatoes. Turned out great, the perfect thickness, not too runny, not too thick. I had never had a tomato cream sauce and this was better than I expected! Perfect for an easy, quick pasta meal!

It is a good base but adding your own is important. I always add crushed tomatoes and some tomato paste to make a richer sauce. Strange as it may be a couple oxo envelopes also add to flavor to my family's. (I am vegetarian.)

I essentially followed this to a 'T'. I had only Half and half in the refrigerator so I used that rather than whipping cream.( I used slightly less dried basil, and since I had plain diced tomatoes in the pantry I added a bit of Italian seasoning to it to compensate) I loved it. I may omit the sugar next time as I am not sure it's needed. I also used an immersion blender so it was not so chunky. I will definitely make it again! It's awesome! Note: it really does not make a large amount so I agree with doubling the recipe unless of course you are cooking for 1 or 2! Thanks for this easy and great recipe!

I made this recipe with fresh basil & fresh tomatoes (not the Italian style mentioned in the recipe).  It was pretty good although I think I would double the recipe next time for the amount of pasta I used.  Will make it again :)

Added some frozen spinach just to have some veggies involved, and added a bit more salt. Puréed the sauce because my family prefers fewer chunks, and more sauciness. Topped with Parmesan.

So yummy & easy. Even my picky kids ate it. My husband thought it was a bit too sweet, so maybe I will cut down the sugar next time. I doubled it. I did not saute the garlic & onions. But I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic & onion and another can with basil, oregano & garlic. I put a little olive oil in and blended it since my kids don't like chunks. Then I followed the recipe as directed. I really like this and will use it often!

I thought this was super delicious, but I had one kid stage an uprising at dinner because she didn't want to eat it. The flavor was perfect, but it was a little thin. I think blending it, as some suggested, would have made it thicker, or possibly if I would have let it reduce some more. THe only changes I made were that I doubled the recipe, and used one can italian diced tomatoes and one can diced fire roasted tomatoes.

Divine. Will definitely make again and again. I used diced tomatoes with chilies, so it was a bit spicy too. I loved it and it was good even the day after.

This recipe was fabulous!  My husband raved.  I followed one cook's recommendation to use 3 gloves garlic. Yes!  I also used fresh basil vs. dried, and sliced about 3 Tbs.  At the very end we added some chicken from a store bought rotisserie chicken. YUM.  It is in our keeper box. LOVE IT!

This was ok.  Not the best thing I've ever had.  It was edible but it was lacking something in the sauce.  I might try adding some different seasonings if I make it a second time.

I think as written, it would be decent.  With some alterations it is fantastic!  I tripled the garlic, used light cream instead of heavy cream & doubled the amount, added frozen peas towards the end of the garlic/onion cooking, and used an immersion blender at the end to make it a little smoother.

Awesome recipe. Easy and super good. I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes and ended up using a mixture of tomato paste and crushed tomatoes, which worked out very well. I just boiled the tomato sauce longer, probably about 15 minutes to remove most of the moisture before adding the cream.

I found this recipe posted on another site and decided to try it.Here's how I made it.Except for making this in a large skillet the recipe was made exactly as it was written.And I must tell you, " This is the first time I've ever had a red sauce with heavy cream in it. I served this over pasta with Turkey Meatballs. Thank you for taking the time to post this recipe and, " Keep Smiling :) "

Delicious!  Just can't seem to get the smooth consistency.  Always "gritty".  =[  Have tried blending it.  Any other tips?

I changed up the recipe a little; mainly due to laziness and lack of some ingredients. I used progressive tomato basil soup and cream and onion spread. i did not put any sugar in mine. i figured the soup had enough.everything else more or else was the same. it taste great.

reviewing this as I'm eating it. Excellent recipe. Diced my own tomatoes, used 3 cloves of garlic, skipped the butter, and used a hand blender at the end to make it creamy. so quick and easy!

Even when I'm careless measuring, and substitute ingredients, it still comes out marvelous and she'll ask for it again.

Just made this for the first time with a few modifications.  I only had a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, so I used those - and they are delicious.  Also excluded the onion since I didn't have one and it was fine.  Used much more garlic; 3 cloves instead of four.  I used ground oregano and also added some rosemary - great idea.  Decreased the sugar per other reviewers suggestions; I did add about a tablespoon of flour and used half and half instead of whipping cream.  I like the "chunky" style so I did not run it through the blender.  Delicious and flavorful!  Exactly what I was hoping to have for dinner tonight!

Very yummy sauce, and easy to make too!  I added some herbs from a cantanzaro herb mix that I have instead of just the basil/oregano (the mix included both, yay) but otherwise I kept it exactly the same.  It was fantastic alone, but combined with the Meatball Nirvana recipe from this site, it was amazing (all of us could barely move we ate so much)!

For reference, here is the link for the meatball recipe, try it out: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/meatball-nirvana/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=nirvana&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page

I make this to pour over cheese ravioli from the frozen food section of the grocery store at least once a month.  The spice proportions are perfect and I always put it into my magic bullet blender after cooking to make it a great, smooth sauce.  I actually replace the cream with Vanilla Soy Milk and the butter with a non-dairy spread and it is still wonderful!  I haven't tried to freeze it but I think it would even freeze and keep well.  It's SUPER easy to make and I recommend it to everyone!

Excellent recipe, easy to make and fast for last minute meals. A few additions or changes: I add extra garlic (about 3 cloves). Next, to make it sugar free, I use a sugar substitute (stevia) instead. I use regular diced tomatoes and I simmer longer than 5 min (about 15 min) making it thicker before adding the cream  and and butter to stretch this recipe because it does not make enough for 5. Doing this makes enough for about 3. If you need to feed more than double everything!!! Delicious and definitely restaurant quality!

Amazing! This was so good we made it two nights in a row.  I did make a couple changes - instead of using canned tomatoes, I diced two large vine tomatoes.  I also used garlic salt since I didn't have any garlic on hand, and threw in 2 chopped green onions.  The sauce turned out thick enough without any adjustments.  We also added cooked sweet Italian sausage and spinach the second time. Yum!

Added sauteed chicken strips and it turned out great.  I may try half and half next time to see if the heavy cream is worth the extra calories.

This was wonderful!

I added just under 1/4 cup onion because many reviews said it was too onion-y. That turned out to be about 1/3 onion rather than a whole. 
I also added 1/2 can tomato paste. 

It was perfect! Wanted to lick my plate.

Tasted amazing! Me and my husband loved the flavor! I used the sauce over a spinach and cheese stuffed ravioli type pasta, and it was EXCELLENT. Tasted like a dish from a restaurant.

The onions had a delicious caramelized flavor which really added to the overall depth of the sauce. Also, since I only had extra thick double cream, I used less than the recipe called for and thinned it out with milk.

Definitely a sauce I'll use again, and will definitely try on an assortment of different pasta dishes!

it really is quite good. easy to whip up as well. except for the cream, most ingredients are general pantry items that most cooks will have on hand already. i am going to try to experiment with substituting milk since it is more readily on hand.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  Due to other reviews, i did use about 1 tbsp of flour to thicken it a little.  Also, I used fresh basil and oregano.  Turned out great served over spinach tortellini.

added 3 garlic cloves, used diced tomatoes and just added italian seasoning, used skim milk 3/4 cup instead of cream, used only 1 tablespoon of smart balance spread instead of butter, used Truvia instead of sugar,  added 1/2 block of Tofu and Tomato paste to help thicken.  pureed it all with hand held blender. yum

Absolutely amazing!! Loved to make something with things I already have in the pantry... It was better than going to Olive Garden.  Next time I want to try with sauteed mushrooms!  This is a winner!!!!!!!!!

This was delicious!  I will add more garlic next time, and probably toss in some fresh basil.  To my taste, it needed a little more salt as well. I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed in a little flour with half and half instead of using heavy cream, and it worked beautifully. Overall a really great sauce.

Very good sauce. It's very versatile and easy to make your own. I used 1/2 an onion and 1 shallot. I also pureed mine. I didnt have heavy cream, so I just used whole milk. Im sure the cream would have been more decadant, but for those watching their weight, the milk was fine. I served mine over cheese and spinach stuffed shells at a dinner for the vegetarians. It was great. I might try it with some penne and feta. Great sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Mild tomato flavor, especially when I added 1/4 tsp of baking soda to cut the acid. This is a complex sauce with many flavors, and could be adapted lots of ways. I have some left-over meatballs in the freezer, and I defrosted and cut them into quarters and added them during the last 5 minutes. I also used sour cream instead of heavy cream.

Really great sauce - I did blend it quickly before adding the cream for a smoother sauce, and I also added one chili since I wanted a bit more spice, but other than that it was quick and easy with excellent results!

This sauce is really good.  I did double the recipe just for quantity sake. I also only used 1/2 small onion and 3 cloves garlic.  Just because we prefer garlic flavor over onion in our sauce.

**Just a note: To those who state the sauce is too thin, you probably didn't allow the sauce from the canned tomatoes to reduce.  You must bring it to a high boil and then reduce the heat to allow the liquid to boil off and thicken.  Also, this isn't meant to be a low fat recipe. If you substitute heavy cream for milk or even half and half plan on adding flour to your base otherwise you will not have the same thickness.

This was excellent. As I had been searching for something like this, but creamy so I made one change.  Before adding the cream and butter I put the tomato/onion base in my food processor and processed until creamy. I then returned it to the pan and added the cream and butter.  My husband LOVED it, as did my entire family.  I added fresh basil leaves and a dollop of goat cheese to each serving (over angel hair).  A keeper.

I LOVED this recipe, though my hubby thought it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll cut back on the cream. But it's a nice change from the usual bottled tomato sauce! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this. I made sauce exactly as written and was very good. Since then i have made several times to suit my taste. It is excellent if you add chicken strips, peas or asparagus and lots and lots of garlic! YUM

I love this recipe! I did alter it a little the second time I made it by adding a can of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce to give it a fuller tomato flavor. Either way, this is an EXCELLENT recipe (my dad gave his approval, and he grew up with authentic Italian cooking).

Five star recipe as written when it comes to the flavor, but this recipe does result in a pasta sauce that is rather thin.  Others have mentioned thickening it with flour so I'll try that next time; I just like to try a recipe as written the first time around.  The bf and I really enjoyed this one and I'll be making it often.  Thanks for the recipe!

A solid sauce, but a little too sweet and creamy for me.  Though I modified as follows:  Fresh tomatoes instead of canned, added cayenne pepper, more garlic, salt and pepper and some fresh parmesan.  Also, I took out the oregano and reduced the cream some.  Oh, and added a few meatballs.  Next time, less onions, no sugar, and maybe puree the whole thing, at least a bit.

So simple, and so good. I made a few alterations - like I used only and 8 oz. can of tomato sauce that cost about 50 cents.  I also used italian seasoning because i didnt have oregano.  No basil - but a little cilantro - which i couldn't really taste..

Excellent! I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was very tasty and surprisingly unique. I actually spread it out over about 6 servings and it was still fine. Could I have doubled it? Sure, but it was fine and flavorful if you want a finer coating as well.

Congratulations!!  You nearly replicated the Spaghetti O in a can sauce.  It tastes nearly like it.  Cooked it exactly to spec.  The color is off, but still almost tastes like it.  Cooked it multiple times, Recommend it.

Loved the sauce, all I changed was using fat free half and half then adding some flour at the end to thicken it up. DH raved about it, served it over chicken parm.

I doubled recipe and added more seasonings per other reviewers.  Everything else was pretty much the same.  It was delicious and I'm making it again.  I was worried about teh chuncks of tomato in the sauce, because my hubs doesn't like chunky tomatos, however they became much smaller after cooking and simmering. Thanks for the recipe.  I will use this frequently.

Very good and tasty.  Easy to make this sauce and can add to any pasta.  I used half and half and made sauce for my ravioli.  Delicious!

SO good! My husband loved this sauce...BUT,i did make a few changes. I substituted freshly chopped tomatoes for the italian diced ones that were called for. I also added sliced chicken sausages to add more texture and flavor. Oh, and i left out the butter, the cream was enough. Overall, delicious recipe, will be making it many many times to come. =)

This recipe is part of my regular rotation.  Absolutely love it!  The sugar is crucial, left it out once and it was a little bitter.  I sometimes pair it with chicken meatballs, which go nicely.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent! For next time I think I will cut the onion in half. The onions were very mild tasting, but there just seemed to be an excess amount. I served this with penne pasta (1/2 pound) and sliced chicken breasts. I mixed everything together and then served. This allowed the chicken and pasta to absorb some of the moisture and taste of the sauce. I also thought the amount of sauce was just right with the pasta and chicken (I don't like pastas slathered in tons of sauce), but think it serves closer to 4 people.

I found this to be quite bland. Also, it was a very small amount of sauce. Maybe 2-3 servings, not 5.

I love the tomato-cream sauce that is served at Carrabba's. I was hoping this would be just as good and it was. Carrabba's is still better but this was close. The only difference I made was I added a bit more garlic. Other than that, I made it exactly as directed. Make two batches because one is not enough.

Really fantastic. Just the right amount of tomato and cream. I used left over marinara sauce from scratch instead of the Italian-style diced tomatoes but other than that it was exactly the same. We ate it with three cheese tortellini. It's my hubby's new favorite sauce and my toddler loved it even when I put pureed sweet potatoes in his!

This was an easy and tasty last minute pasta sauce for one of those "It's 5 o'clock and I have no idea what we are having for dinner" nights.  Used whole milk (all I had on hand) and added some cream cheese for richness.  Had regular crushed tomatoes, so added about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning. Ran the whole thing through the blender for a creamy sauce since my kids will not eat chunks of onions.

Loved it!  Took another's advise and sautéed mushrooms with the onions and garlic.  Didn't have heavy cream so I used the milk/butter substitute and added shrimp to my pasta!  "Thats a 10!" said my husband!

Pureed half the tomatoes and added about 3/4 cup of shredded smoked gouda cheese to melt into sauce.  Also used fresh basil.  Very good!

I have a similar recipe & only made a few changes to this one. I used all of the following my homegrown: basil, oregano, parsely, tomatoes, & onion. I also add sausage to the sauce. I dumped pasta into a bowl & then the sauce & mixed together. Delicious!

This is the best tasting sauce ever.  My body has a hard time digesting milk and cheese.  This recipe is perfect.. the heavy cream does not bother my stomach and there is no cheese in this but it tastes like there is some in it!  I will be making this for years to come.  A fav!!

Wonderful!  I doubled the recipe for a large group.  Once the sauce was made pureed it with an immersion blender.  I added 1.75 pounds cooked diced chicken, 1.5 cups frozen peas and a pint of sliced baby portabello mushrooms.  Continue to simmer until heated through.  Then add 14.5 ozs of cooked farfalle pasta.  Stir and YUM!!  Served 6 plus leftovers.

This was a tremendously rich and delicious sauce!  I also added some spicy italian sausage, however, the dish would have been superb without.  I used a spinache penne, a can of fire roasted and diced tomatoes and opted for fresh herbs.  Fantastic!  Thank you very much.  Also, I made the full fat version and I agree that one could probably get away with making some low fat substitutions i.e. half and half and still have a wonderful sauce. Thank you very much!!

We loved this one to death. the only thing is there is no way it is 5 servigs.  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes therefore I doubled the cream. I have to admitted that I did spoil us this time and used the heavy cream. I never do. I usually use fat free half and half. It was sooooo worth the fat. I also used fresh basil since I have ton growing in my garden right now. I also threw in some freshly grated parm cheese in the end. YUM!

Perfect as is.  So good we were only able to get 3 servings out of it.  Splitting it 5 ways would not have been fair.  I considered pureeing but I felt the tomato chunks made the sauce more complex.  Later I'll probably try lightening it up a bit with milk or half and half, but there's no way you'll be disappointed with the full fat version.  I served it over a portebello / provolone ravioli from Trader Joe's and it was superb.

YUM!! Love it! I only used 1/2 an onion, added a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning and 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan. Then I pureed it in the food processor.

Very Good, very simple but use less onions! I used 1/2 onion diced and it was still a little overwhelming. I ended up adding more tomatoes and some red pepper flakes. Next time I think I will add some red Bell pepper.

Excellent sauce!!!! I changed mine around just a little. I used half whole milk & half cream. also, I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced. I added spicey sausage and served it over mini penne pasta. My husband loves this!!! This is a keeper:)

I agree with a previous reviewer that said this would serve only 3, not 5.  I really simmered off most of the liquid before adding the cream and found this to be a very nice consistency, not too thin at all.  I left mine chunky, but could also see pureeing it for a nice smooth sauce.  My tomatoes must have been pretty sweet, because I only added 1/4 t. of sugar and might not add it at all next time.  Also, I skipped the butter.  Very good!

Adding some sausage would be a great variation if you're looking to add some meat. Otherwise, the richness and pure indulgent feeling that the recipe provides is just right!

I would have given this recipe only three stars, but my biggest problem with it may have been something I caused.  I thought it was too sweet.  However, I substituted fat-free half and half for the heavy cream (as suggested by other reviewers), and fat-free half and half is sweetened, so I'm guessing that was the problem.  I don't think I'll make this again, although I ate it all.  I'd recommend that people taste the sauce before adding sugar, especially when they make a substitution.

I can't say enough good things about it. We make large batches twice a month and freeze half, and thereby have this sauce at least once a week. It's not very much work either. Also, an excellent way to get fussy eaters to eat veg because it coats so well. Simple but hearty, as it should be.

This recipe is a great starting point.  I add tons of extra veggies (zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms, spinach) then puree half in the blender, then add it back in to the sauce.  I also add a small can of tomato sauce.  Delicious way to sneak some extra vegetables onto my boys' plates.

This was overall pretty good. Blending it is a must, makes the consistency much better. I did not have a problem with it being too runny, I just let it boil a little longer than suggested. Would be FANTASTIC with some grilled chicken.

YUM!!!  I have never taken the time to sign up for a membership so that I could rate a recipe.  I found this recipe SO good that I just had to sign up so I could rate it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and thought it was absolutely delicious.  I do, however, plan to experiment next time by doubling the recipe then adding maybe some shrimp or chicken and artichokes and black olives.

Divine! I made this for a dinner party, and it was a hit! I did blend the tomatoes before I cooked them so that the sauce didn't have big chunks, but I left the minced onion pieces for texture.

Great recipe! Super easy. I followed the advice of other reviews and upped the amount of garlic. I didn't have any Italian diced tomatoes, so I just used plain diced, and it was still delish! I also doubled the sauce and tossed it with a box of spaghetti and some grilled chicken. It made plenty for my family of four, with some leftovers (although everyone was scraping their plates, so there wasn't as much left over as I was hoping for!).  Oh, and for the love, PLEASE don't use skim milk or any other kind of milk or half and half in this recipe - the heavy cream is what makes it so yummy. I tried subbing whole milk, and I was sorely disappointed.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer by adding a tsp. of Italian Seasoning to make up for the fact that I only had plain diced tomatoes. I must agree that this really only makes enough sauce for 3 entree sized servings, I will double next time. Really great flavor!

This was SO GOOD! I didn't make any alterations even though other reviews said they used a blender. I however, like the chunky tomoatoes in the sauce. I recommend doubling the recipe if you're going to feed more then 2 or 3 people. It didn't go very far. Also, I think next time I'll add chicken and mushrooms.

ah.may.zing. I am obsessed with getting tomato cream sauce on my pasta when available at restaurants! This was my first attempt at making a sauce from scratch, and to my surprise it was a huge hit!...I served the sauce over farfalle and topped it with grilled chicken and brocolli! I also pureed the sauce in the blender for a smoother texture...I will make this again and again!

Delicious......used 2 (28 oz ) cans of chunky crushed tomatoes.....used fresh chopped basil instead of the dried.....way more garlic and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy crream to cut fat and calories. Served over rigatoni pasta.....Easy and quick and very tasty...my family enjoyed this sauce. Thanks!

YUM!  I made this as directed with two minor exceptions. I doubled the entire recipe, but kept the onion at the single recipe quantity, and I used a large can of crushed tomatoes + 1 tsp Italian Seasoning as that was what I had on hand.  It turned out wonderfully.  Very yummy with chicken and using the crushed tomoates meant I did not need to hit it with an immersion blender to have a smoother consistency.  This will go into our rotation.  Thank you!

My husband, 6 year old and I loved this! Made a salad to go with it and it was plenty for the three of us. I didn't have any onions, but sprinkled a bit of onion powder, used 2 cloves of garlic, diced mushrooms, and put the tomatoes in the food processor so it would be a smoother sauce (so glad I did!)Also didn't measure the basil, just added until I thought it was enough, maybe a teaspoon, a tablespoon seemed like it would be a little much. But like my 6 year old said, "Tasted like it was from a good restaurant!" Hubby wants to know when I'll make it again :)

Yum! Will make this again many times. Such a nice change from regular tomato sauce. Also a great way to get a large serving of veggies by adding peppers, mushrooms, and others. Thanks for the great recipe!

Drain the water good if you are using home canned tomatoes for this one otherwise it's slightly runny.  Otherwise Great!

I guess given the number of reviews, I expected a little better tasting sauce.  I did add one more clove of garlic and more sugar, as I thought the sauce was too tart.  Even after doing that, there was an unpleasant after-taste.  I might try again with crushed tomatoes, but I'll see.

This is really good! It has become a staple in our kitchen.  I usually add something, cream cheese, bleu cheese crumbles, feta, whatever I have on hand, and the recipe tastes great with all of them. I've added chicken, beef, and seafood and have loved it every time.  This one is a keeper

Sooooo good!!  And there's so much you can do to it!  This time I added zucchini.  I didn't have any cream so I used skim milk plus 2 Tbsp plain yogurt.  I pureed this in the blender with half of the tomato sauce mixture, then added in some crumbly cream cheese I had, then mixed it back in with the other half of the tomato sauce so it was still a little bit chunky.  Soooo yummy!!

DUDE!! This sauce was so good...I browned some ground beef and added it to the sauce to simmer, and it was perfect! Will definitely make it again.

As others have stated, it is a great basic sauce that has room for versatility. I added parm cheese and sundried tomatoes. Very good :)

Loved it! I also like a creamier sauce, so I put in into the blender on puree and then added my cream and butter. I also added chopped baby bella mushrooms to the onion and garlic sautee. I have a picky 9 year old and he actually said he liked it! I served over cheese ravioli and it was awesome! To be honest, it reminds me a bit of the Portobello Ravioli at Olive Garden! Super yummy and I will be making it again!

This sauce was a hit at my house! Husband, sister and her boyfriend all raved about it.  A million times tastier than the crappy packet mix ParmaRosa I used to make, ha ha ha.  I used twice the amount of tomatoes and twice the amount of cream (used half & half).  Oops, I also used margarine instead of butter.  Oops, and added four cloves of garlic and a sprinkle of freshly ground dehydrated garlic...and a generous amount of fresh pepper.  I found that the sauce didn't want to thicken up after the cooking time given but I ended up leaving it simmer for about 20 minutes and it did somewhat.  It was still a bit runny so I served it in shallow bowls to avoid spills.  What a delicious, economical, versatile recipe...the addition possibilities are endless--sausage, beef, chicken or just veggies.  Ohhh, how about as a sauce for lazy ravioli or lasagna!  I served it over pasta, of course, to which I added two stalks of chopped celery and half a chopped red pepper.  Sprinkled cheese over top.  Served with biscuits dipped in garlic butter before baking.  Thanks for sharing...I'll be making this often!

I loved this recipe. I added chicken meatballs and I mashed the tomatos with a fork because I'm not a big fan of chunky tomatos. It turned out great :) I loved the sweet creamyness of it.

Really good! I used fresh tomatoes and chicken broth instead of the canned tomatoes, and just used milk and sour cream instead of heavy cream.  I will make this again, it was very good! I served it over chicken.

Just not for us.  Tried it out, but my husband and I didn't like it.  Pulsed it in the blender to get a smoother sauce, but even with some extra hot sauce in it my husband didn't want to eat it.

My sauce seemed a little  too runny and chunky, and not really saucy, so I added a small can of tomato paste. It was swell.

There is a lot of basil and a lot of onion in this sauce...but not so much sauce. Added a can of tomato sauce and this helped a little. Will try using two cans of petite diced tomatoes, more half/half and extra garlic next time. Won't double the onion or basil though. Enjoyed it last night with crumbled italian sausage and was quite tasty.

Was really really delicious. The only thing I noticed is that there was a lot of onion in the sauce which is fine with me, because I like onion but for others you might want to cut the onion a little. Also I used fresh basil instead of dried.

Very delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it & I used 1 cup of 18%table cream, 1/4 cup of butter & 2 tblsp of flour to thicken. Turned out great & didn't take away from the flavor. I also added mushrooms and diced chicken.  Will make this a regular dish when I want something different from a typical alfredo sauce.

Quick and easy, also very good.  I did make a few additions: 1/3 cup roasted red peppers & 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms.  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used 1/2 cup fat free half and half & 2 Tblsp. 1/3 fat cream cheese.  Will definitely make again and share the recipe with friends.

Inspired by SunnyByrd's photo, I pulled this out of my recipe box and gave it a try tonight.  I've collected so many recipes that some of the best ones (like this one) often get overlooked.  This was absolutely wonderful - very easy to pull together and very filling.  I would definitely serve this to my dinner guests.  I followed SunnyByrd's lead and served this with shrimp over fettucine.  Only change I made was to increase the garlic to 3 cloves.  Simply scrumptious! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Wow!  This sauce was really good, and we're so addicted to regular marinara sauce that I was afraid to stray.  But it was a real hit!  We served it over rotini and added sliced grilled chicken to make it a meal, but I think it would be great over ziti as a side dish also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe!! I added cubed chicken to the sauce.  Because of the chicken I had to increase all of the liquids. I added a little tomato paste, a pinch of flour to thicken the sauce, and some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  It came out delicious! Everyone loves it!

This is a wonderfully fresh tasting sauce that can be nice and light on the stomach as well. I use 2% milk instead of heavy cream. Sure, it loses some of its thickness, but my arteries don't argue with me. It's a quick and easy sauce for impromptu dinner parties that wins raves.

Incredible starter recipe!  I always double this as it is not nearly enough for my family, even doubled.  I also include a can of tomato sauce to make it more smooth and use less onion & more garlic.

I did not find this sauce to be anything special. I pureed it with a hand-held blender stick, and added more salt. It was okay but not great. Not sure if I'd make it again.

I only had milk, instead of whipping cream, but this was wonderful! When I added the tomatoes into the mixture, I also added shrimp and it was absolutely fabulous for dinner with some crusty bread and butter. Thank you!

I love this recipe!  I didn't have any italian diced tomatoes so I used some petite diced tomatoes instead.  I also add some fried italian sausage.  So good!  One of my ultimate comfort foods!

Flavors were good, but overall the sauce was just ok.  It's a very thin sauce.  My young boys didn't care for it much. Probably won't make again.

My husband loved this!  I put this sauce over 4 cheese ravioli.  I was nervous when I started making the sauce because my husband does not like onions or large chunks of tomatoes.  For my husband I after letting the onions, can of diced tomatoes and spices simmer together I threw them into a vita-mix blender and blended them, then added the cream and butter.  It turned out wonderful!  I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 simply because my 2 daughters 8 and 22 mo. would not eat it, I think their taste buds might not be ready for this one just yet.  I will make it again for me and my husband though!  Great sauce!

I did not really like this recipe. I made it as directed except for doubling the ingredients and it just didn't taste right.  Maybe it was my can of tinned tomates(used San Marzano tomatoes) I probably would not try this again.

This recipe was so good...and easy!  I must admit I couldn't help but add another clove of garlic and then a dash of cayenne with the other seasonings.  It was perfect.  I served grilled chicken in strips on top of the pasta and used whole wheat rotini.  It was wonderful!

Fantastic recipe! Like a previous poster suggested, I blended the sauce in the bullet and poured directly on the pasta. I also used 2 chopped up tomatoes instead of the can of Italian tomatoes and it still turned out great. I used this sauce over gnocchi and wow, what a meal!

Delicious and flexible! I didn't have cream, so I used 2% milk - cooked and reduced it by half - and it turned out wonderfully. I also love garlic, so after sauteing the onions a little I threw in 5 cloves of sliced garlic and cooked until soft. I didn't need more or less salt or spices. I served it over cheese tortellinis :) Yummmmm!

I LOVE Tomato Cream Sauce, and this recipe is a godsend! It's SO delicious. I did throw it in the blender for a thicker consistency after following the recipe. For someone without a blender, perhaps substituting the diced tomato with canned tomato sauce and herbs would yield a similar result.

This was excellent.  I doubled, using a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I added 2 tsp of Italian season.  All other ingredients were doubled.  it came out great.  served with small penne pasta and the turkey and blue cheese meatballs.  by the way... doubling the recipe really only enough for 4 adults

This had a really good flavour! Scaled the recipe down to 3. Added 2 cloves of garlic, half a tomato and 2 tsp of tomato paste instead of what was called for. Also added more herbs. Will definitely make again.

I read many of the commentaries before making this, and decided to blend it before adding the heavy cream and also added 4oz cream cheese and some asiago/parmesan shredded cheese.  It was nearly what I was looking for, but it lacked a little flavor.  I thought it was good, but my husband thought it was really bland.  Maybe more basil?  I'm not sure.... I do think I'll make it again...but it needs a little more kick.

I tried this recipe two ways. Made half as written and the other half I made healthier by omitting the butter and using skim milk instead of cream. We preferred the healthier version but didn't love it either way. It might be better with more spice but will probably not make again.

I only did half and half and the can of tomato, and I blended with the hand blender like others. I made the mistake of letting the cream curdle, will avoid that next time. I think this would be way better with fresh tomatoes and fresh basil.

Mmm!! This is good! :D I absolutely love it! I put in 1/4 tsp of minced garlic, a bit more sugar, and added no onions when I made mine, and it's great! I'm going to definitely make this again! Probably on a weekly basis!

Excellent sauce. As suggested I used more garlic than the recipe stated and instead of the cream I substituted Marscapone (italian style cream cheese) which helped keep the sauce thick. Was very sucessful. We topped with sliced pan fried chicken breast and lots of shaved parmesan - Yum.

This was good. I was wanting a tomato-cream sauce for some Gnocchi.  I made the sauce as directed and it still did not have the taste I was looking for. It was good but not quite what I wanted.  So I added 4 oz of cream cheese and 1/4c parm. cheese.  It turned out to be exactly what I wanted.  It was REALLY yummy!

This sauce was loved by my very picky boyfriend who hates when I experiment with food. 

I put the tomatos in the food processor for a few seconds before adding them when the recipe directed.  We used all the onion and a little extra garlic, with a pinch of red pepper flakes.  The sauce was even delicious before adding the cream and butter as a plain red sauce.  

You can let it simmer for 5-30 minutes before adding the cream (we used canned evaporated milk) and butter, so you can time it with the rest of your food!

Good, but messy to make.  I agree with others that you need to double the amount of sauce.

This was a really good recipe. It was easy to make, and it turned out pretty good. I don't like my pasta sauces runny, so I let mine simmer until really all the water evaporated, and I also added some baby spinach to give add some green to the red. I opted to try using half and half cream, instead of heavy cream. I'm not quite sure what the difference will be in consistency, but I guess I'll find out eventually because I'll definitely make it again. :-)

Very good. I added some cornstarch to thicken as well as some roasted red peppers and two tablespoons of tomato paste. Will do again.

Very delicious!  The first time I made it as written and it was wonderful - not too thin at all when simmered as directed.  The second time I used a can of crushed tomatoes and substituted half and half for the heavy cream.  Equally delicious.  This was so quick and easy; I'll be making this often.

I followed this recipe as written, as I always do.  I liked the flavor of the sauce but I think I will follow others advice next time and add a little flour so the sauce won't be so thin, because it definitely has a soupy consistency. I think I will also reduce the amount of chopped onions.  The sauce needs the onions, but probably not as much as noted.  I served this sauce over 3-cheese tortellini.

Five stars for ease, taste, and time. Great flavor with little effort. Only changes were crushed tomatoes in thick puree and red onions because that's what I had on hand. Served over cheese ravioli with parmesean. Thanks!

I usually have to up the amount of spices a recipe calls for, but I may tone it down next time. I did add some red wine, as I generally do with most red sauces. Still, tasty. I may also add turkey sausage next time.

I only had stewed italian tomatoes, so I pureed at the end. Delicious! I also added 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese, 1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley, and a couple of sprinkles of Italian seasoning. I will definitly be adding this to the family recipes!!

This recipe is SO great!  I did blend my sauce as some other reviewers recommended, but other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  I served the sauce over bowtie pasta with some chicken that I cubed and sauteed in a pan with olive oil and garlic salt, and then topped with fresh parmesan.  Yummy!  Thank you SO much for this recipe.  It was just what I was looking for!

I give 4.5 stars. It tasted good, and my mother who is not fond of any kinds of cream sauced dish liked this pasta sauce. I followed the recipe precisely. It tasted good. However, I like the sauce a little creamer, so I'd like to puree a cup of the sauce next time I make it.

Good recipe! Unfortunately this wasn't quite enough for my family of 4 - and we aren't big eaters. I thought I had cream on hand when I started making this, but didn't. I ended up using milk as many suggested - not bad, but would have been better with cream. I also added some red pepper flakes for spice. Will do again with slight modifications.

I was looking for a simple pasta sauce that was a little different.  This was a great recipe from which to start.  Since I didn't have enough basil, I added sweet marjoram to make up the difference.  Instead of cream, I used milk to cut down on the fat.  I also added a little more salt and a splash of dry sherry.  The recipe was a hit.  Thanks to Rachel for the idea about adding a thickening agent.  I didn't even think of that.

I really liked this sauce and it was extremely easy to make. I substituted half and half for the cream because that is what I had on hand. I also added red pepper flakes. I add that to all of my sauces because I like a little spice. I did think it was missing something though. Next time I will definitely add more garlic and maybe play around with spices a bit. It will be made again.

This was great! I followed others' tips and pureed for our kids, and used 1% milk instead of cream to make it more healthy. I'm sure it would be creamier with the cream, but it was still rich enough with the milk. Great, easy sauce.

This was a hit with the fiance.  It works so well over penne pasta and is a wonderful cream based sauce.  Next time I will probably add some parmesan cheese to it to give it some cheesyness.  Instead of using heavy cream I used half and half just to watch the fat and cholesterol.  Over all a wonderful sauce.

I liked this sauce, but didn't love this sauce.  I was hoping it would measure up to a tomato/cream sauce I had last week while dining out...it didn't.  It was ok, but had too many onions for our liking.  I'll keep looking for a closer match to the restaurant sauce.

Wonderful recipe - doubled it with ease. I had fresh basil on hand and it was delicious. I also blended it a bit as I don't like tomato chunks, so it was thinner than I anticipated. I think I would use rotini next time instead of spaghetti because the sauce will stick to rotini better. Definately a keeper.

Loved It! I added kielbasa, diced chicken breasts,black olives, fresh spinach, oregano, fennel seed and garlic powder. My kids asked for seconds, which they normally wouldn't with this kind of dish...a true hit! I also served over whole wheat pasta. Oh...I used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than heavy cream. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

This was so good!  My boyfriend thought it was too rich, so I'll probably use less cream next time.

This is a truly magnificent sauce in that it is easy to put together and taste divine!  I only used 2 med. onions since 3 seemed like a lot and of course seasoned to taste.  Other than that I followed the recipe and was immensely pleased.

This is a great sauce and easy to make.  I added more garlic than called for.  I also added some cooked chicken strips one night to the sauce and the family loved it.

This was a very good sauce, though I did make a couple of changes: I omitted the sugar, used fresh basil, two garlic cloves, and 1% milk instead of cream. I served it over whole wheat penne with diced chicken, and it was delicious!

Some people say that you can never have to much of a good thing. This is a very good sauce and the family loves it. Drawback. Husband loves this so much that I have to make extra and freeze it so that I am not cooking it as much. So ladies with hungry men, be careful because this stuff can be addicting. I learned the hard way. lol

This sauce was very good.  I took the advice of another reviewer and pureed the tomatoes and onions but it was a little to runny so I added a tsp of cornstarch mixed with a sm. amount of creamer first so it would be smooth.  It lacked a little umph for us and had to add in a little crushed red pepper and a pinch of chile powder.  My husband said it needed sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese to make it perfect.

Agree with most of the other ones. I pureed the tomatoes as well. I agree this is a lot of onion if you use a regular sized yellow onion.  Also I agree this is not a lot of food but is probably enough for a small meal for 2. Also had no heavt whipping cream so used half and half, turned out good but probably would taste better with cream.  Overall good, but this is a recipe most people will probably modify to suit their preferences. I personally will add more seasoning next time, use half the onion and probably add some other veggies or meat so it's more of a meal.

So fast and easy and fantastic!!!  Also, I had never had stewed tomatoes before and wasn't expecting chunks of tomatoes; what a pleasant surprise.  I thought this recipe might just be a regular tomato sauce with a bunch of spices, but it  totally exceeded my expectations.  Boyfriend and I ate it up.  Thank you!

This is really yummy!  I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and a bit of Italian seasoning as well.  I don't think it really needs the sugar so I usually leave it out or just use a pinch.

This recipe is soooo good.  I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used 1/2 and 1/2.  I don't think it needed the butter and I did add some hot pepper flakes and a dash of white wine to give it a bite.  I will be making this alot.  I feel it only serves 2 though so make sure you double it if you want left overs

Overall, this is a very good sauce. I added 4 oz of pancetta and changed the diced tomatoes to tomato sauce (personal preference). After that, I think it had WAY too much basil; it was overpowering. I will definitely reduce that to 1.5 teaspoons next time. With that change, I will definitely be making this again. Very easy.

Quick, easy, and really tasty.  I use one Tbsp of Italian seasoning instead of the other 2 separately.  We use 1/2 and 1/2 to make it a little better for you.  Last time, my husband added some cooked italian sausage and it turned out great!  The only thing is...this recipe only makes enough for the 2 of us...there's never any for leftovers!

I really love this pasta sauce!  I add an extra half can of the tomatoes so that it goes a little further.  I add steamed peas, broccoli and chicken to some penne pasta, toss it all together with the sauce, and it's excellent!  My family loves it!

This was great!  I was expecting to be less impressed since the ingredient list is not that extravagant.  I only used half of my onion and had about equal parts tomatoes and onions.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great base to start from. I pureed the tomatoes in the blender because I like a less chunky sauce. I also did not add cream, but substituted milk and it turned out just fine. I would probably add a few more spices next time, and omit the sugar.

My husband told me that "this is better than going to the Olive Garden!"  I used 1% milk instead of the cream.  It was great!

This sauce wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special.  I followed the recipe but replaced the heavy cream with evaporated milk (it was all I had).  The sauce had great consistency and wasn't thin at all.

I use plain tomato sauce (I'm not big on tomatoes), heavey whipping cream and add shredded parmesean. Besides that follow the recipe to the t. Awe, tastes better than Carrabas.

MMMM good!  Exactly what I was looking for and SOOOOOOOOO easy!  I wanted something a little smoother so after sauteing the onions and garlic, I threw them in the food processor with the tomatoes (I had regular, not italian, on hand so I used those).  Then I continued as directed....yummy!  Thanks so much for such a wonderful and easy recipe!

Spectacularly easy and delicious.  The sauce would be good even before adding the cream and butter--and healthier too--but the cream and butter increase the richness by several notches.  My wife has a discriminating palate and she loved it; she had a second helping and rarely gets seconds on anything anymore.  We prefer a thicker sauce, so I mixed 1/2 cup of cream with a heaping teaspoon of cornstarch, stirring in a measuring cup until fully disolved, then added it to the rest of the mixture.  Doing it that way prevents lumps from forming.  This recipe combines great taste and ease of preparation.

Very delicious!  I added more garlic, and I used 2% milk because it was all I had.  I also added about a half cup of grated romano cheese and some white wine which gave it a nice zip.  At the end I thickened it with a little flour.  I'll definitely make this again!

Excellent! Use maybe 2 tablespoons onion. Added red pepper with the onions. Didn't use sugar. Others mentioned being thin. You have to do what it says and after it boils, simmer down some of the liquid. Using the cream helps thicken it. I used 1/4 c. heavy cream and 1/4 c. 2% milk.  Skipped butter. I did a quick blend but not puree.

Oh so good. This is so delicious, easy to make and inexpensive. I took the advice of others and blended the sauce smooth. Because we have vegans in the home, I used non diary margerine and milk rather than buter and cream. Definitely a keeper.

YUMMY! Made this last night and topped with grilled chicken. We left it chunky but would like to try it blended. I followed the tip about using skim milk instead of heavy cream and it was great. I also used a bit less butter. Super delish and will definitely make again.

This was really yummy.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because i prefer smoother sauces.  Next time I will put it in the blender and I think that will make even better.

OUTSTANDING! husband normally drenches his meals with parmesan, but this time, not one piece of cheese hit his plate! he "drank" all the extra sauce and licked his plate clean! as for me, i loved it as well :) will definately make the sauce over and over-maybe even for the italian in-laws!

I really enjoyed this mixed with jumbo shrimp. I added fresh chopped parsley, more garlic, a few splashes of red wine and a can of tomato paste, as I found the tomato flavor a bit subdued. Definitely a keeper.

For my tastes, this recipe used far too much onion, but I just added some more tomatoes, garlic, basil, and oregano to even it back out and put it in the blender. Based on advice in the other reviews, I also added a chopped red bell pepper and pureed the sauce before adding the heavy cream and butter. A big hit at my house!

Great, flavorful recipe.  I used fresh basil and added a couple of splashes of white wine.  I think the wine made a great difference in the taste.

This was just how I like my recipes simple, fast, and good.   I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  It could have used a little more flavor so I gave it a 4.  Next time, I'm going to try some of the suggestions others have left.

I was looking for something to put over whole wheat pasta. This was an excellent sauce. I didnt use heavy cream, used a low fat cream substitue and it was wonderful.  I will make this again and again.

Very good and very like a sauce I already make.  I used 1/2 of a medium onion, 1, 14 oz can diced italian tomato's and 1 can of italian stewed tomato's.  I also used 3 garlic cloves, and about 1/2 tablespoon of italian seasoning. I had made a rump roast 2 nights before and added 2 large thick slices to the sauce.  My old italian mil used to make a roast in the sauce and the slices in the sauce reminded me of that.  Thanks! This was enough for me and my son and daughter in law, over ravaoli.

I loved this sauce. My wife prepared it as a topping for a grouper filet that I pan fried in olive oil with a light flour and herb breading. The combination was excellent!

This is a wonderful sauce.  Based on suggestions of others, I added hot pepper flakes, reduced onion (actually used Shallots) added sun-dried tomatoes and increased the amount of cream a bit.  Served with cheese filled tortillini.  Great reviews by all at the table.

This was so easy and tasty!  I used red pepper as recommended, added some shrimp and served over rice.  I can't wait to try it with pasta.  One of my new favorites!!

Very good recipe.  My family was getting sick of jarred sauce so I was looking for something easy that also tasted great.  This is it!!  I made and will make the following modifications, though:  First off, my hubby and daughter do not like chunky sauces.  After I added the diced tomatoes and let them cook down a bit, I put them in the blender to emulsify them a bit.  It made a nice puree.  I also used half-and-half and it turned out fine.  I think blending the tomatoes helped to thicken the sauce too since others mentioned it was a little thin.  I also only used about 1/3 of an onion and it was plenty.  Next time, I'll do the same but will add lots more garlic, more fresh basil, a little more salt and maybe some sun-dried tomatoes to deepen the flavor.  A great sauce that you can really tweak and make your own!

The first time I made this sauce, I used half and half instead of cream as that was all I had.  I've now tried it with heavy cream, and it really doesn't make much of a difference.  So if you prefer a less-fattening variety, the half and half works.

This is the best pasta sauce I've ever had.  Everyone I've cooked it for thought it was fantastic as well.

definitely double the recipe.  I used half the onions and double the garlic and a little red pepper.  I also blended the mix before adding the cream and butter.  My only issue was it was a little watery...and it was fattening :)

I used 2/3 of an onion and minced it like the garlic.  It blended very nicely.  The Italian tomatoes fit perfectly and give an extra basil flavor.  I can't imagine adding extra cream and butter, I liked the fact that it was creamy, but not heavy.  I agree it serves less than stated.

Very very good.  Extremely tasty.  I used only 1/2 onion and like 3 cloves garlic.  Then I used two cans of diced tomatoes(used the one flavored with basalmic vingar/basil-great extra taste), sugar, sea salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and used italian seasoning to taste.  I doubled the cream and butter as well.  Will def make again and again.  THANKS!

This sauce was absolutely amazing. So simple. My husband bought the wrong tomatoes so we used Italian style stewed tomatoes and it was still absolutely amazing!  Thank you so much, Kimber! This one is a keeper.

This sauce was delicious, but I think the recipe calls for WAY too much onion. It was still great, but the next time I use this I will probably cut the onion down to 1/4 cup. I also did not have any canned tomatoes, so I added 2 cups of chopped and cored fresh tomatoes. Because there wasn't a lot of juice form the can to boil, I added a little water. I also added a little tomato sauce when I added the cream, just because I like it more tomatoey. I also added prosciutto and scallops.

We really liked this one! I nice change as I usually just use canned sauce to make a quick meal. I served this over beef raviolis with a salad and bread. There was nothing left by the time we finished as we kept soaking the sauce up with the bread! This could easily pass for a fine resturaunt's meal and it was super easy. Most people have all the ingredients on hand, with the exception on the heavy cream, so that is a big plus in my book.

I thought this was very good but needed to add a good deal more salt.  I roasted chicken breasts in an oven bag and then shredded them and put them in the pasta.  It tasted even better the next day!

Mmm, makes a nice creamy tomato sauce.  Mine ended up coming out a little spicy, but I tossed in a few red pepper flakes.  I will definitely make this recipe again, and I will play more with seasoning to tune it to my exact liking.  This a good foundation to play with.

My husband-to-be wanted me to make this every night of the week!  The second time I made it I added a 5oz can of tomato sauce and a generous shake of red pepper flakes because we wanted it a little thicker and a little spicier.

This pasta sause is absolutely wonderful.  My husband had seconds.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream, but the taste is great.  I added chicken, garlic & herb link sausage.  Next time I'm going to try shrimp and scallops.  Great sauce!
