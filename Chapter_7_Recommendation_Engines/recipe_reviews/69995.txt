This is a good recipe, spicy, but not too hot. It took 2# asparagus to make 1 qt.Didn't have white wine vinegar, so used red wine vinegar. Would advise to use a tall jar so you don't have to trim so much off bottom. Will try this with green beans later. Be sure to use a wide mouth jar.

Very good -different from the usual pickled vegetables I've made.  Use the smallest diameter spears you can so they will be tender.  Better to let sit a week or more for flavors to develop.

I boiled the asparagus for a minute before putting it in the jar. I wanted the asparagus to be somewhat soft. I thought it tasted a bit too much like Old Bay. I would definitely cut back on that. I don't know if I will make it again, but it was good.

Asparagus is my hubby's favorite vegie so I gave this a shot. I'm happy to say that he headed right for the fridge every night after work to munch. Thanks so much!

I had some pretty thick asaragus so I blanched it for two and a half minutes then plunged in an ice bath. And my asparagus wouldn't fit in the jar, so I just put it in a ziploc. These were good, probably would increase the thyme and garlic since I didn't taste it and maybe cut back on the sugar. A little too sweet. I used dried cayenne pepper for the jalapeno. I made this recipe and the "Pickled Asparagus" with dill. I like the flavor of this one. The other one added onion which I will add to this recipe.

Made batch 5 X this recipe. Only thing I did in addition is add 1 tsp. Alum to make a little crunchier.  Was totally happy with how they turned out and will make again.  Thanks.

Very good and easy as well.  Followed instrs  exactly except cut back on old bay as suggested..However not nearly enough liquid to cover tops of asparagus tips so ended up making more
"pickling..otherwise good recipe.

I'm a vinegar nut, so when I didn't have white wine vinegar, I used distilled white vinegar and I thought it was the perfect amount of bitter for me.   I did not find it necessary to blanch the asparagus before canning.   They came out the perfect tender-crisp that I love.   I also omitted the thyme.   This is a great recipe, with or without my changes.   I will make again.

Asparagus is a fav of my husband's, the skinnier the better.   And we've had skinny lately. He loved them.  I would definitely make them again.  The qt. jar is empty now.  I'm meeting my sister at my Dad's for a week, they always love the preserved items I bring to them.  Since I am strapped for time, I am reusing the liquid, reheated of course.  Going to try for 2 pts, cutting the spears in half.
