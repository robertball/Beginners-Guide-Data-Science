Great jumping off point, but I made a few changes.  Instead of garlic salt, I used fresh minced garlic.  While cooking, I used salt and pepper to release some of the zucchini and onions natural juices.  I also cut the oil down from 2 T. to 1 T.  I didn't have pinto beans, but garbanzo beans and I only put cheese on the top.  We devoured the entire casserole and it was a great way to use up some of my garden's zucchini.  Thank you for a tasty recipe!

Delicious!  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Also, I think the next time I make this, I'll wrap it up in tortillas.

This recipe was alright. I made a few changes...I left out the oregano and used black beans instead of pinto beans (that's what I had on hand). Also, I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of chipotle hot sauce to the salsa and it added some flavour and heat. Not sure if I'd make again.

This dish earned rave reviews from both my husband and myself!  The only tweaks I made were to cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and to not put the extra cheese on top of the casserole.  Also, we assembled the dish over the weekend, refrigerated, then heated in the oven during the week.  I found I had to double the oven time to 40 minutes with the dish being so cold to start with -- so just keep that in mind if you use this approach too.

I made this after a friend sent me the recipe.  I added 1 lb of ground turkey to make it meaty for my fiancee and a smidge of Velveeta that was leftover from another recipe.  It was wonderful!!!  

We ate it over Fritos and used the leftovers for burritos the next day.  Perfect Fall food!  

Yum! Yum! Yum!

This dish was so good. I'm doing low carb right now so this was great for that application. I did change/add a few things that I think made is spectacular. I browned 1 lb of chorizo with the onion and then browned the zucchini. I used a can each of pinto and black beans and added about a cup of velveta and a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese. 

Made this for a party and it was a lot so thought I would have leftovers for the week......Nope. Not a chance. They raved and it was almost all gone, maybe one serving left. 

This is definitely in my line up of favorites.

Good recipe.  Made exactly as recipe stated.....needed something else.  Next night added some chicken to the leftovers and much better.  If I make it again, will add chicken again and a little more of the spices a little bland for my family.  All in all a good recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for 3 adults tonight, and all of us loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.  I used 3/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and red beans instead of pinto beans, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Spicy and yummy!

This was quite good. I would probably make it again when I have an over abundance of zucchini. I used minced garlic, (three cloves), and just plain salt.  We liked this served over crushed tortilla chips.

Really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe except for doubling the rice and using a full can of pinto beans (14 oz, I think) to stretch things out and add more "body" to the casserole. With those additions, I had to add a bit more salt to taste. Delicious and very easy to work with.

Excellent dish. I realized when I went to add the rice that I only had uncooked rice. So I added almost two cups of vegetable stock and about a half cup of sour cream to the dish for the rice to cook in. It needed a little longer in the oven, but turned out great!

Awesome recipe. We have tried it as written and then out diets changed to a fat free vegan diet so the next time we left out the olive oil and cheese. It was still awesome.   The leftovers are perfect in a tortilla with lettuce, avocado and bell peppers a squeeze if lime is good addition as well.

After reading the reviews, I added a few things and this is a family favorite.  We are meat eaters, so I add ground beef and increase the seasoning by at least 1 teaspoon.  Pinto beans are hard to find in Belgium where I live, so I use kidney beans.  I also make a layered casserole with two tortillas on the bottom, one in the middle and one on top with a layer of cheese to finish.  We serve with fresh cilantro and sour cream.  Delicious!

I thought this was fabulous! I don't keep pinto beans on hand so I used a can of chili beans and added a pound of cooked chicken breast.  We ate it plain and ate in taco shells also.

Another terrific way to use up that summer zucchini.  The only change I made was to use black beans instead of pinto beans.  This is a great main dish, or a very hearty side dish.  Everyone really enjoyed this one!

Made with quinoa instead of rice. Used less cheese and salsa.  Thought what I ended up with was amazing.  Thanks for the jumping off point!

We love this one. I use black beans and brown rice and fat free cheddar cheese and it turns out GREAT!
I use it a lot for our Weight Watchers program.

This is really good! DH HATES beans (says they taste like dirt) but I added a can of garbanzo beans so they would blend in with the egg noodles (didn't have rice). I also topped it with sour cream. He loved it! I knew I could change his mind. Thank you Leah.

I give this a 4.5 star rating but my husband absolutely loved it so it earns a 5.  I used half the cayenne, added three diced chicken thighs and served with both flour tortillas and tortilla chips.  My husband is still raving about it - good thing, too, because it made a LOT.  We both agree that corn would be good in it.  I made the whole thing in an oven-proof skillet and saved a little on clean up time.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I consider good either. Pros: cheap, easy, and makes a ton. Cons: shockingly bland and flavorless. I might try again this summer when zucchini are overflowing, but I'll add fresh garlic, up the spices, and add something. Cumin? Lime? Cilantro?

I do change this a bit but I love that it's a Mexican casserole that isn't as heavy as others.  I switch out 1 pound of zucchini for 1 pound of ground turkey so my husband feels it's more of a meal.  I season liberally with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning.  I use a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (Ro-Tel) instead of salsa.  Leftovers are very good wrapped in tortillas, though I would like a bit more rice & beans when served that way.

Very good. I used MJ cheese, 1 can of chili beans and 1 Cup (or more) cooked shredded chicken.

This was delicious!  I didn't change anything when I made it, and it was full of flavor and had an awesome spice.  Gotta try it!

The flavor was great but there was way too much zucchini.  I will make it again but with half the zucchini and a bit more spice.  Maybe this was mean as a side dish instead of a main.

I made this recipe as is except i added one green and red pepper. I also used about 2 lbs. of zucchini instead of 3 lbs. I omitted the oregano and used 1 cup brown rice instead of long grain. It was good but a little spicy for my husband I love spice so it was perfect. I also didn't cover it while cooking and it was fine. I will make again.

For people who want that nice hot spicy flavor, use canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  The adobo sauce gives it a nice smoky spicy mexican flavor.  Even if you don't like it hot, the adobo sauce itself is a good addition.

I used 3 peppers (deseeded) and 1T adobo sauce and it was very hot (for a person who likes moderate spice to their food).

Fantastic! Hubby's new favorite casserole!  Made just like the recipe says except used 2 cans of rotel in place of the salsa-I was almost out of salsa.  We like really spicy food and this was perfect!  I cut up and cooked 11 batches of zucchini and froze it so hubby can have this all winter!

Super easy and very good! We replaced the rice with quinoa, used soya beans, added a bit of ground sausage and only put the cheese on top. Will for sure use this recipe again.

This dish was a mixture of spicy and flavorful. My whole family loved it, and even though i left out the cayenne pepper, it was still spicy enough! It was a great way to use up zucchini. Well i am definatly going to make it again and you should too.

This was pretty good.  I used 3 medium zucchinis.  I added 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon fresh mined garlic to the zucchini and onions while it sauteed.  I also added 1 teaspoon ground cumin an extra cup of rice, and used black beans instead of pinto.  I also decreased the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon.  I think this would be great as a burrito/taco filling (with a little sour cream, etc.).  Overall, not bad.  :)

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I’m not generally a big fan of zucchini unless it’s hidden in a cake or brownie, but this really impressed me.  I had black beans on hand so I used them but otherwise it was all as directed.  Thank you for the recipe, I will definitely make it again!

The recipe doesn't say what kind of salsa, so I used a spicy salsa verde.  I was out of rice, so I used quinoa, and instead of cheddar I used a blend of cheddar and jack cheese.  It was delicious! ]

I usually try to make and review recipes as they're written, but this one is truly versatile.  You can switch it up to your taste or to use what you have on hand.   This will go into my recipe box for sure.  I'm glad to have a veggie side dish to serve with a Mexican dinner.

Easy, delicious. 

We reduced the cayenne in half, and still it had quite a bit of heat when combined with a medium salsa. We substituted black beans for pinto and rinsed these before adding to the dish. 

We will definitely be making this again.

I made this casserole recently. It was delicious (quite spicy) and I recommend it without reservation. I made some changes: I used brown long-grained rice instead of white, and black beans instead of pinto beans. I also doubled the amount of rice and beans. It could be a vegetarian main course or a side.

Made a couple of tweaks and it turned out delicious!!  Added some salt, pepper, 1 tsp cumin, and was generous with the minced garlic.  Ran out of salsa so only used 2 c (which I think was fine), and just used the whole bag of 2 c of shredded cheese (which I think was a good life decision).  Good spice level with the cayenne and a combo of med/mild salsa.  But warning - this makes a TON of food!  My 9x13" dish was completely full!  But like most casseroles, seems like it will reheat well, and with all that zucchini it will get me to eat my veggies.

UPDATE: I've made this a few times now.  Each time we make it we end of tweaking things, but in general it needs salt, I always do a little extra garlic and cheese, and we just pour in one can of beans (not going to save a part of a can).  It reheats very well and makes for a hearty vegetarian entree.

Delicious! I made it without beans (for me) and added extra rice and made it as written for my husband. We both love spicy foods and this was just right....but definitely would be too spicy for those who like it mild. Super yummy and we're both enjoying the leftovers.

Not sure that covering it with foil did much for it since it only cooked for 20 minutes - cheese was just melted on top not bubbly. Served with nacho and Frito dip chips. Wonderful. Will make burritos with leftovers. Even picky daughter liked it. Also used rinsed black beans since I had on hand. Very nice.

Made it as listed and it's pretty good. One thing I do to add a little "something" is add a spoonful of peanut butter. It's odd but worth it.

Loved it with some alterations. I added eggplant, yellow bell peppers, and left out the oregano. Used fresh garlic, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Mexican chilli powder. I also added about a tsp of hot sauce for more flavor and extra kick. It's delicious! Next time, I'm going to use this mixture to stuff bell peppers.

This was ok.  There is a lot of flavor, BUT I wanted the zucchini to shine through and I felt it got lost in all the other flavors (just a personal opinion).

Great flavor but too dry after baking. I will add chicken broth to it next time to adjust for what liquid the rice will continue to absorb in the oven.

Soupy, maybe I should have cooked the zucchini longer?

I skipped the part about baking it since everything was already cooked. This was a good tasting but sloppy pot of food. This could easily be adjusting in any number of ways and still really in a similar trading healthy meal. I made several adjustments. I used garlic powder and 1 teaspoon pink Himalayan salt instead of garlic salt; 2 cups of cooked rice instead of just 1; black beans instead of pinto beans; ½ teaspoon cayenne instead of a whole teaspoon, 1½ cups salsa since I wanted to see how little I could get by with; and a small amount of smoked applewood cheddar and about 4 ounces of regular sharp cheddar cheese.

This was delicious!  My family enjoyed and there were no leftovers!  I browned chorizo and added to the veggie mixture.

Awesome meal!  If you like a tasty but not overly spicy meal then my husband and I recommend using mild salsa and only an 1/8 of the hot pepper.  It was so good!!!

This recipe is good. We ate it with tortillas, sour cream, extra salsa, cheese, lettuce & tomato. I forgot to add the oregano which I will remember to add next time I make it. I didn't add as much cheese either. I felt like it was missing a little something but I will be making it again :)

This is such a great recipe and has become a staple in our dinner rotation! I make this almost exactly like the recipe describes. My only changes are using about 2.25 lbs of zucchini instead of the full 3 lbs, using a can of pinto beans which ends up being slightly more than the recipe calls for, and about a cup and a half of cooked white rice. I also added shredded chicken once and it was good too, but really not necessary. DH says this is the one entree I make that he is okay with not having some form of meat in it. It is delicious and very satisfying. An AllRecipes favorite!

This is a cheesy and spicy casserole which contains zucchini, onion, garlic, rice, pinto beans, salsa, cheddar, and spices. I slightly adjusted some of the ingredients to get the desired portion size. If you are very sensitive to heat, I suggest lowering the amount of cayenne pepper used. Guacamole, sour cream, and tomato garnishes really help to tie the flavors in this dish together.

This dish was very tasty. I used jalapeño ranch style beans and Central Market salsa. I added ground turkey and left out the rice. My husband said I should make it often. It will be part of my monthly rotation.

this turned out really good.. made this for bf and bf's daughter.. she doesn't like spicy so i used mild salsa and left out the cayenne.. super quick and easy and they both liked it a lot.. used cannellini beans instead of pinto and maybe a little more cheese for the topping.. thank you so much for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: you can easily double the beans (black is my favorite) and rice (brown works well too) or add meat/tofu for a more complete meal.. i've also omitted the cheese and still enjoyed it.. took the advice of others and used fresh garlic (3 cloves) and omitted the salt/garlic salt all together.. such a simple versatile recipe.. ty again for posting

Me and my boyfriend loved this. Did not use paprika or oregano because I did not have it. The first time I used the 2.5 cups of salsa, but thought it was a little too much. The second time, I used a little under two cups and thought it was much better.

This recipe is wonderful as is. I had to make a few adjustments d/t  lack of ingredients on hand. I increased the onion, used brown rice, a full can of pinto beans and fresh salsa. I used garlic cubes which contained the spices listed (and than some) less the cayenne pepper. Added a side of baby carrots and we were good to go. Thank you for sharing.

Love this recipe! I substituted rice with quinoa (in which case make sure to use less salsa so that it doesn't become too soupy) and used all squash instead of zucchini. Add a little fresh cilantro and throw it in a wrap - delicious and spicy!

I followed another reviewer and used 2 garlic cloves instead of the garlic salt. I used 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper and cut the recipe in half since it's just my husband and me and there was still more than half leftover. I also subbed black beans for the pinto beans. My husband doesn't like typically like vegetarian dishes but gave this 4 stars.

I could eat this until it comes out my ears.  I used 2 zucchini, 2 small yellow squash and 2 carrots.  I had lite red kidney beans on hand and used brown rice.  EXCELLENT.  My new favorite way to eat squash!  This is also made less fatter by omitting the cheese and serving the veggie salse over the rice instead.

Wonderful flavors!!  I did add 1 lb of ground beef cooked and drained. And one more cup of beans.  Plus we don't like real hot so I only added 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and it was still enough spice, but we could handle it.  Thanks for sharing.  I had to use some of our zucchini left from our garden.

I simplified the recipe a little and found it to be delicious as a burrito filling and we got about 5 dinner servings out of it.  I threw in a little fresh garlic instead of the powdered, and used four yellow summer squash and 2 zucchini, and added two chopped green peppers before baking.  I cooked a half cup of raw rice, and threw in all that it produced when cooked.  I also drained one can of pinto beans and threw them all in.  I used about 4 oz of salsa as we're not big on spicy and we had a half empty jar in the fridge so I threw that in :-)  I also mixed in the cup of cheese but omitted any on top.  This is a really good base recipe so feel free to simplify or alter as I did, the results are great.

Results from 2nd attempt: used five zucchini, skipped onion, cooked up what was left in a couple bags of beans--recipe is so adaptable.  Skip the tsp cayenne, though, it was too hot for us (w/only ~2Tbl homemade salsa!).

We substituded black beans for the pinto and I didn't have paprika in the house and this recipe still came out delicious.  We used Sargento's 4 cheese mexican mix and the whole thing was gone.

Boyfriend really liked, but I thgouth it was alright, which surprised me since it has a BBQ flavor and he is vegetarian and typically does not like the taste/smell/thought of BBQ sauce.  Will make again, but may modify just a little.  Served on chili tortilla wraps
