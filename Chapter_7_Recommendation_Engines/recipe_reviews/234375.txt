It is almost like Rudy's; just a little bit too much cream cheese.  Cut the cream cheese down by 1/3 to 1/2 and it is perfect!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using buttermilk for half of the cream.  Didn't realize I was out of cream.  We make similiar recipe on the stovetop; it is better and way less the mess of preparing it in the crockpot.

I made it everyday for two years working at Rudy's.  You can buy the ingredients dirt cheap at Walmart.  It's very simple & very fattening.

I have made this dish several times and every single time my friends ask for the recipe. It's so simple. As a "token" to the calories, I use Splenda (or the equivalent) instead of the white sugar. Okay, it's not much, but it helps my conscience. This side dish goes with nearly everything and is always a pleaser especially as a "comfort" food.

I have used this recipe several times, following the exact steps.  The only thing that i need to change is the time in the cooker, but it may be because I triple the recipe as everybody LOVES it and there are never leftovers.
