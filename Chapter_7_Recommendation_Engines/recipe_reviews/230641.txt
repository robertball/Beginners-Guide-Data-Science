Wow.  That was awful.  It was so watery, I didn't even attempt to put olive oil in it.  And, the flavor . . . I like olives, but this just did not taste good.

So inexpensive to make and better than store bought. You can add xtra oil or the olive liquids to taste. And 1 med clove of garlic is plenty. We just love it!

There is no way that this is runny, unless the olives and beans are not drained. I add the olive oil as I mix, because I don't want to use that much olive oil and then I also add a little lemon juice, for added moisture.  A very good basic recipe.

Yea it helps to drain the beans first if you add the liquid of them it's very watery and if you didn't add the black olives you didn't make it
