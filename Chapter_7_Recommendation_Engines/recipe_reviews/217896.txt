The taste of these muffins is ok. There are no starches really, just heavy flours. The notes say to use any gf flour in place of the ones listed.  I used 3/4 c of sorghum flour plus 1/4 cup of brown rice flour in place of the soy flour. They were heavy like bricks. I also believe that 1.5 Tbsp of baking powder is way too much. I used one tbsp and there was an acidic aftertaste. I used coconut oil for the vegetable oil. For such a thick batter, the oven temperature burnt the tops and left the bottoms raw. If I were to make these again I would use a lighter flour mix, reduce the baking powder, and reduce the oven temperature (increasing cooking time).

I used Bobs Red Mill 1 for 1 for flour and used potato flakes because I didnâ€™t have rice cereal.  They are ok but kind of heavy.  Seems like they need some liquid so last 6 muffins I added almond milk.  Also I added some spices, since there were none in The recipe, cinnamon, nutmeg cloves and allspice...still they are kind of tasteless 
Future batches will include 1/2 c almond milk, and at least 1t cinnamon.
