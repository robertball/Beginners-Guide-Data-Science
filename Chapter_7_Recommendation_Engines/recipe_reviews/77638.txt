I loved this chicken and I served it on top of cilantro-lime rice.  I didn't use any of the optional garnish to help keep the fat amount low.  I also poked holes in the chicken and marinated it overnight.  I will make this over and over again.

I love this recipe! It's super easy and really good. I've always got the ingredients laying around, so it's great for a last-minute meal. I've substituted lemon juice in for the lime juice when necessary, and it still tastes great.

This was great. I used EV olive oil and lemon juice because that is what I had on hand. I grilled the chicken and served it all over rice. Wonderful! Will definitely be making again. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

A very flavorful and attractive dinner entree!  I substituted 1 cup pico de gallo for the 1 cup salsa simply because of personal preferences.

Yum!  I broiled my chicken after marinating for 2 hrs. Although very good, I think it would be even better if marinated for 4-6 hrs. and then grilled.  I can't wait to try it again this way.  Serve with rice for a super easy & delicious Mexican meal!

I'm with bellepepper.  This wasn't bad, just ... "nothing."  It only had a little lime flavor & no spice flavor at all.  I even rubbed the spices on then added the marinade.  Eventhough I did the recipe as listed, the lime juice began to "cook" the chicken & I only marinated it for about an hour, maybe less.  Maybe the salsa (I didn't make) & the toppings are what made others rate it high.  'Not keeping this one.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I use extra virgin olive oil instead of canola oil, but follow everything else exactly.  The black bean salsa is so good I can eat that by itself.  I would recommend broiling the chicken over baking.  It is way more moist and takes less time to cook.

I've had this recipe save for almost a year and we've made it about a dozen times.  It is incredibly flavorable and extremely delicous.  I make it according to the directions and it comes our perfectly every time!

Delicious recipe! I broiled chicken for 10 minutes on each side. Chicken came out moist and perfect. I loved the spice that this dish had and I will definetely make it again!

My husband and I grilled up this chicken last night and decided it's definitely a keeper.  We served it over cilantro basmati rice. I made extra so my husband could take leftovers to work, and when he woke up this morning, he said, "You know what I'm excited for?  Lunch!"

What a great recipe!  I added a variety of vegies (green/orange bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, green onion, tomato), spices (cumin, chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cheyenne pepper), and diced up corn tortilla to the salsa mixture to make is more substantial.  The marinade was simple but delicious.  I will definitely make this in the future.

Great recipe! Tastes great and so easy to make!  I baked the chicken in the marinade for 33 minutes instead of grilling or broiling (to hold in some of the juice from the marinade) and it turned out great.

Amazing recipe, easy to make and oh so delicious. I stumbled across this last week and made it for my family and everyone raved about it. I served the chicken on spanish rice and the marinade and the salsa really set the whole dish off, the diced avacado is a must as well.

Really enjoyed this.  The marinade was not especially flavorful but my extremely picky seven year old ate it over rice and loved it!  Enough said.  The salsa was so good.  Mixed the beans and corn with Trader Joe's fresh salsa and ate it with everything!  Yum!

This was a delicious mexican fiesta for sure! I made this for my boyfriend and I and he loved it. The recipe is perfect and full of flavor! I chose to serve it on top of a flour tortilla so that we could eat what we want and roll the rest up to make tasty burritos. I also served it with mexican style rice.   I altered the recipe to make only 2 servings but it was still a lot of food. I didn't mind though because we had lunch for the next day :) I'm a college student so leftovers are essential! And even though cooking is not my forte, I loved making this dish because it is EASY and SOOOO GOOD! It's definitely a keeper!

I scaled this down to 2 servings for Hubs and me and it  was really just ok.  Sort of bland and definitely no pizzazz.  You may want to omit the water in the marinade if you try this.  I realize that there’s not all that much in there, but by adding it you will only be diluting the flavor that is there, IMO.

Made this the other night and it was very tasty and very quick and easy. Substituted vegetable oil for canola and lemon juice for lime juice (all I had on hand) and turned out very good. I did tweak the salsa a bit with some spices and added some diced tomatoes with chilies since I thought it was a bit on the bland side on it's own. Will definitely make again!

I made this tonight for Cinco De Mayo.  It came out great even though I did not have a lot of time to marinate the chicken.  I did not change a thing because it is super easy and delicious.

Quick and very easy meal. The whole family loved it! Marinaded the chicken for 3-4 hours and broiled in the oven. Took maybe 10 mins on each side. Chicken held its flavor very well.

This recipe was great!  It had tons of flavor.  One thing I changed was instead of using purchased salsa, I used one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  It spiced it up a notch and still gave it a great fresh flavor.  I also marinated the chicken for longer than 30 minutes.  Overall, great dish!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was such an easy, delicious and economical recipe to make.  I served it with Mexican rice from this website and it was delicious.
