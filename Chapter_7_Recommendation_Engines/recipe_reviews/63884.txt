A fantastic salad that makes a meal. Easy to prepare and great for a potluck. I'll definitely make this again. Just a hint... bright red grapes give this recipe some needed color. YUMMY!

Even after doubling the grapes and celery, the salad still had too much dressing (at least more than pictured). Instead of opening a frozen oj concentrate just to use 1/4 cup, I would use the juice of one orange next time to help cut back on the amount of dressing.
