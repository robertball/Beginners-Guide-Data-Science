This was a nice way to top sweet potatoes.  I only used half the amount of butter in the recipe.  I had leftover poblano butter which we used on corn on the cob later in the week, also delicious!

The Butter topping is a very good alternative to a sweet topping for baked sweet potatoes... I did roast the poblano pepper and removed skin then followed the direction exact.  My daughter didn't care for the savory and heat from the roasted pepper on her Sweet Potato but everyone else cleaned it up skin and all....  I will include this again when my menu is running on the "rich creamy" side to balance flavors. I think this would be amazing on all vegetables especially roasted Corn, Green Beans and definitely,  I can't wait to try on saut√©ed Brussels Sprouts.

This was really good. Used Best Life fat-free margarine and seeded and roasted my poblano.
Excellent on a sweet potato!
