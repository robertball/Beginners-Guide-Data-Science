I made it for my friends birthday party. It was very good. I marinated the chicken breasts and thighs over night. For me personally it was little too salty, but everyone (including my husband) at the party loved them. Next time when I make it for our dinner, I will use half amount of  Teriyaki sauce.

I love it. I changed up a few things but it was amazing. I cut my chicken into squares. I used crushed red pepper flaxes in place of curry. Also i mixed everything for the sauce heated it up and put a 1/4 cup of sugar in. I added lo mein noodles and then pressure cooked everything. seriously amazing. My children ate every bite.

I made slits in the chicken and marinated overnight, then baked.  It was good and the chicken picked up the flavor.  I will make it again.

We loved it, not ??’d it.  We marinade it overnight.  We used Soy Vay “Very teriyaki” instead of the teriyaki called for in the recipe.  I’m going to try to freeze the leftover marinade, I’ll let you know how it does frozen.  We baked only 2 chicken breasts @ 1 1/2 pounds verses the chicken called for in the recipe.
