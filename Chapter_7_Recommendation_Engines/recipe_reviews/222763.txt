Ridiculously delicious and simple.  I throw everything in a zip-lock bag and marinate while I prep the rest of dinner before putting these on the grill.  Super simple and delicious. I will make these over and over.  Thanks.

Very easy recipe.  The balsamic makes for a very nice finish to these zucchini.  My zucchini hating husband even likes them like this.

We tried this out last night using one zucchini that was pretty small.  I halved it lengthwise and just eyeballed the seasonings.  Hubs grilled this for a total of 6 minutes.  Rather than basting the zucchini with the balsamic vinegar, we just sprinkled some on at the table.  Quick and easy!  We’ll do this one again.

This was very tasty and simply! I loved it on the grill and will def do again. In addition to the zucchini I did the same with some mushrooms. The mushrooms don't take as long to cook but were really good as well! Thank you.

Lashgirl, you are the best! Your partner in life is a very lucky person! I made the zucchini on the grill but what I did with the last brush of balsamic was to spray it on the zucchini just about a minute before removing from the grill. Then, once placed upon a plate/platter, lightly spray again, while it's still hot, and the flavors are increased (at least for us)! Thank you for the great idea for this tasty veggie.

This was a good way to prepare zucchini on the grill, but I wish that the balsamic stuck to it a bit better. The olive oil coating on the spears made the vinegar bead up. I added an extra drizzle on the plate, and I think you can skip the grilling it in step entirely if you like.

Seconds after placing the zucchini on the grill, the aroma let me know that this was going to be something special.  It was a big hit at our Fathers Day weekend cookout.

Put balsamic in shallow dish so it is already on the squash. Then cook and baste as directed with plenty of oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder or granules. Makes grill flare up but it really didn't make it burn. It took spears longer to cook on the grill than I thought but even zucchini hater hubby liked these.

Made this on my George Foreman grill and was delicious!  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar on hand so I used balsamic vinegarette dressing instead and it turned out wonderful.  This was the first time my husband had ever had zucchini and he loves it.  This will be a favorite for sure.

Marinated the zucchini in balsamic and Italian spice blend for 30 minutes, and brushed with EVO when started to grill. Fantastic!

I loved this but the kids wouldn't touch it, hence the four stars. I don't have a grill so I mixed all the ingredients with the spears, then oven-roasted on 400 for 40 minutes. The result was a really sophisticated side with a strong flavor of balsamic vinegar that was a hit with the adults but not at all child-friendly.

This just doesn't cut it for us. With the spice and balsamic being so heavy, you don't get taste of zucchini. I don't know if changing the amount of seasoning or balsamic would make a difference, but we're not making this again. Very disappointed as we like zucchini on the grill & thought this would be a nice change from some of the ways we already prepare it.

Made these last night on the grill.  They were wonderful. I halved them instead of quartering, much easier to handle on the grill, but then you will have to add an extra minute or so on each side(since their thicker).  Will make these again.

Amazing! I prepped these and brought them to a friend's to grill out one night. They were a huge hit with everyone. Very simple, on-hand ingredients made them even better. 
The balsamic is almost carmelized on there, making it sweet and tangy.

I broiled these in the oven instead of grilling because our grill space was full of meat.  I laid them out in glass casserole dishes, cut side facing up, brushed them with both the oil (I used coconut oil) and balsamic, sprinkled the garlic powder and Italian seasoning, and added some fresh shaved Parmesan cheese on top as a final touch. Then, I broiled on high for about 4 minutes until the cheese was toasty brown.  They were perfect!

It was so easy and delicious!  My zucchini was a bit big so I'm not sure I cooked it long enough, but I'll do it differently next time.  Also, I used the George Foreman grill.

Too oily for my tastes, but my husband liked it.  Next time, I might try painting on the marinade while grilling,  versus letting it "sit" in a marinade for any length of time.

This was ok. It was easy to make and it was a simple grilled zucchini. Nothing that would wow you but if youre looking for a simple trusty side dish, this works well.

Loved it. The balsamic vinegar added an excellent tang. I've tried it with a variety of seasonings and we've loved it every time. Can also do this in a saute pan (just a bit of coconut oil adds great flavor).

Tried this recipe at the very last minute of my grill plans. Loved it, but my kids really enjoyed it. Very simple, as long as you control your heat and the amount of time you keep it on the grill. I burned my second batch slightly because of those factors. Overall, pretty good way to grill zucchini.

This recipe was very easy. I added fresh crushed garlic then floated some shrimp in the remaining marinade for grilling. I'm looking forward to trying this with other veggies.

Super tasty - only thing I did differently was only to halve the zucchini instead of quarter it and I added a tiny bit of Parmesan to the mix of herbs.

It is easy to prepare.  However, I was expecting much more tanginess since balsamic vinegar was used.  Perhaps I should have marinated the zucchini first.

Enjoyed this easy veggie side. To make it even simpler I didn’t measure the ingredients. Instead I just brushed the cut up zucchini spears with the oil and sprinkled the seasoning on; enough to my liking.  Then on grill I brushed the balsamic on. No measuring really needed!

I made this to go with some steak tenderloins I was making.  I followed directions to a tee.  I let it sit while I cooked my steak.  I think this helped flavor the zucchini a bit.  I loved the way the balsamic vinaigrette added the right amount zip.  This was its amazing to me.  I loved it.  I just wish I could cook my zucchini better.  I always get a few real squishy pieces.  Lol.  Definitely will make this again!

loved this recipe - so simple. I grilled the zucchini on the George Foreman grill instead of on the outside grill.  I also cut up some mushrooms and used this same recipe and grilled mushrooms at the same time. delicious.  This would be a good recipe for grilling portabella mushrooms.

Only thing I did differently was make small slits diagonally down zucchini tops prior to topping with balsamic to increase its flavor as there we live the flavor!

We just had this. My picky 5 year old just devoured an entire slice himself!  I also will admit to not being a huge grilled zucchini lover, but this was truly fantastic! Completely altered my view of grilled zucchini.  Heartily recommend!

This is similar to the recipe my mom used since I can remember.  The only difference is she didn't do the balsamic vinegar.  It added a nice touch.  If you don't want to use the grill, you can simply bake in the oven.

It was okay. I ended up using I Alina dressing after the grilling to liven up the flavor.

This didn't work for us.  It's a weird mix of flavors that ends up tasting like pine-sol.  Other people seem to like it, though.

Easy and delicious. I cut my zucchini in half, then cut each piece into quarters to make sticks. Really easy to grill this way and it cooked nicely.

I will make it again. I drizzled the olive oil instead of brushing it on. I definitely need a do over since I didn’t read the intstructions the whole way through. Rookie mistake.

We liked the flavor of the balsamic on the zucchini.  We will be making this again when we have zucchini from the garden.  It was really easy to make and very tasty.

It tasted fine.  Probably would have been better if I'd used the grill outside instead of the griddles in doors.

I've been making zucchini like this for years, but never with balsamic. I normally sprinkle with finely grated Parmesan cheese, but now will happily try the balsamic.

Very good.  I have done this outside on the grill with a different seasoning before I tried the recipe, I followed the directions except for cooking the squash on my cooktop in a 'grill pan.  I am pleased I tried it inside.  The finish with the balsamic was wonderful!

This was fabulous!  My only change was to add feta cheese during the last few minutes, and I poured the remaining marinade over the zucchini after it came off the grill.

Marinated in balsamic dressing 15-20 mins.  Added red peppers (no green peppers or mushrooms on hand) Sprinkle Parmesan over and drizzle more dressing on top after grilling. Try using sliced tomatoes and grating some mozza over after final turn on the grill. Have a toasted baguette ready!

We had the grilled zucchini for dinner last night. It was delicious. I will increase the garlic, decrease the Italian seasonings to 1/2 tsp and marinate the zucchini for about 15 minutes prior to grilling. Perfect summer veggie dish at the cottage.

Made these under the broiler since it is too cold here to grill out.  Mine turned out a tad mushy, likely because they were not necessarily the same thickness, so some overcooked while waiting for the thicker pieces to cook.  Would definitely make again and use a slicer so that each piece is the same thickness.

Delicious!  I had already cut the zucchini in rounds when I discovered this recipe.  Guess what? It tasted great cut this way, too!  I appreciate that the grilling time is fast and the zucchini doesn't get mushy.  Served this with 'Restaurant-Style Tequila Lime Chicken' from AR.  Thanks LashGal, for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper.

I used one zucchini cut in half crosswise, making it 2, each the size of a cucumber, and cut each in 6 lengthwise pieces.  I made the marinade and instead of just brushing in on, I soaked the strips in it for about 15 minutes. When when they came off the grill, I tossed the rest of the marinade on them for extra flavor.  I think I will poke some fork holes in them next time and soak them just a little longer.

I really liked this simple, but tasty recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
I made it almost exactly as printed - used sea salt.  It was so yummy.
I did marinate with the balsamic instead of brushing it on as suggested.

Not much flavor.  I love zucchini but I'll stick with my tried and true garlic and oil.  Sorry.

We loved this!  I had a giant zucchini and wanted to try something new.  I followed the directions and served it with fresh chopped basil and tomato slices.  Yummy!

9/5/2016 - grilled alongside the cedar plank salmon on AR.com - both turned out delicious!

7/8/2013 - Easily thrown together and on the grill with the meat - delicious and pretty on a plate!
