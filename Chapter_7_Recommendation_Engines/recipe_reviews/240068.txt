Love slow cooking, love spaghetti squash...but like others had two concerns; 1.) Veggies can turn out very mushy in a slow cooker and trying to split an uncooked spaghetti squash can be down right dangerous...so I decided to try this method using other submitter's suggestions. 1.) I used only 1/2 cup of water. 2.) Cooked on Low for 3 hrs., as soon as the squash was just tender to touch, I turned the slow cooker off and let the squash cool right in the cooker. It turned out perfect. So, easy to cut and shred. All of the strings came out easily and were not mushy at all. Maintained individual string texture.  This will be the way I cook spaghetti squash from now on.

I wasn’t a big fan of this.  Yes, it was easy, but a slow cooker cooks with moist heat, and moist heat was not the best method for spaghetti squash, at least not for me.  Moist heat resulted in too-moist squash.  Not overdone at all mind you, but still almost on the soggy side - it simply retained too much moisture.  And I even used a lot less water than called for, just enough to cover the bottom of the pot.  Interesting to try, but I’ll stick to roasting my spaghetti squash in the oven.

I just recently tried this method for cooking spaghetti squash after seeing it on Pinterest, and this is the only way that I will do it from now on! I tried it twice and both times the squash came out perfectly...this method is a keeper!

This is very good but I got the same outcome by pricking it a few times and cooking it for about 10 to 12 minutes in the microwave.

I never ate spaghetti squash before and was very pleasantly surprised.  I used this slow cooker recipe but  as some reviewers suggested I only used 1/2 cup of water.  After about 3 1/2 hours I let the squash sit in the crock pot while it cooled.  It came out perfect.  I sauteed the squash with butter, garlic and a bit of salt and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese. It was wonderful even my husband like it who was dead set against trying it.

I cook and eat spaghetti squash on a regular basis, and I was excited to stumble across this method of cooking it.  Even though it was ridiculously easy to prepare, unfortunately I found that the squash came out tasting a bit funny.  I cooked it according to instructions, but left it on warm for several more hours; perhaps that was the issue.  (Usually not a problem with most slow cooker recipes.)  I don't think I'll be making spaghetti squash this way again, I will stick to the oven.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was amazing. I was unsure about cooking this in the slow cooker. But it turned out amazing! The seeds scooped out wonderfully. So good. I did 15 pricks in the squash. I think next time I will do fewer. It was a little on the more moist side. A great alternative to turning on your oven when it's 102* outside. :) I would add a photo but we ate it all. Even my kids liked it.

I love everything about crock pot cooking and own several in varying sizes.   I love experimenting and trying new things, and I love tossing something in and leaving it alone.  I've fallen in love with a Twice Baked Spaghetti Squash with Pesto recipe, but am not so fond of a) cutting the squash, b) having to baby sit it while it cooks the first time in the oven.  This method of cooking the squash was sooooo easy, and when it was done cooking, cutting the squash was much simpler.  Some other reviewers said their squash was mushy, so I cut the water down to one cup.  Mine was not mushy at all!  It was perfect for for my twice baked casserole dish.  I will definitely cook my squash this way from now on.

I cooked a medium sized spaghetti squash on low in my slow cooker all afternoon, while I was at work. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did not add any water as it does not need it. It worked well! It didn't turn out very mushy.

When the squash was done, I sliced it open width-wise. Since the strands go around the squash horizontally, the strands will be longer - more like spaghetti made from wheat.  If you slice the squash open lengthwise, you are cutting the strands in half.  

With the squash already done when I got home from work, supper was ready in minutes. I will use the slow cooker method again, for sure. 

Thank you for posting this recipe!!

Excellent way to cook a spaghetti squash!  Love it!  I would say that for a medium size squash, it will only need a maximum of 4-5 hours of cooking time.  This is going to be my standard way to cook it going forward for sure! :D

This worked very well as an alternative to baking spaghetti squash.  A nice idea for if you are going to be out of the house for a while and want to cook something with the squash when you come home, or if you simply don't feel like using your oven.  I cooked mine for the full 6 hours and it turned out perfectly tender.

Turned out fabulous.  I reduced the water to about 1/2 cup. On low it steamed in 3 1/2 hours in my slow cooker which runs to the hotter side. Enough liquid releases from the squash itself that a large amount of water isn't needed at the start of cooking. Loved not having to turn my oven on!

This was super easy to do and nice to just forget about it once it was in the crock. Just salt, pepper and butter and it was delicious. Easy to cut and scoop out the seeds too.

Awesome! I prick it 10 times with a knife then put it in the crockpot for about 2 hours on high no water it creates  condensation on its own. Then I turn it to low for another 2-3 hours perfection every time. This is the only way I make squash. Thanks for the recipe!!

Outstanding!

Easy!

Highly recommend as a side-dish.

FWIIW, after separating the strands, I topped with honey, melted butter, & white wine.

(My only caveat is that slow-cookers do vary as to  how hot they get.  As I know my smaller one tends to cook things a tad faster than most recipes predict, I cut the cooking time to just below the recommended minimum.  It came out with just the right texture.  Had I followed the recipe, exactly, it would have been mushy.  So, if you are not sure as to yours heat , I would not try this for guest, the first time.)

Edit:  After reading more reviews, I would add that I had no problem cutting the cooked squash.  Knowing that the skin would be tough and the interior soft, I did not cut with a sawing motion.  I plunged cut (point first) with a chef’s knife.  So, I was cutting 90* across a thin skin – not parallel along a surface.  Also cut lengthwise.

So easy.  I love this way of cooking spaghetti squash.  I put pierced 2 of them and put in my crockpot for 6.5 hours with 1.5 cups of water.  I then let it sit for approximately 2 hours in the crockpot to cool.  Cut and scooped out perfectly.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I put mine in a slow cooker..no pricking, no water... and it turned out fine, although the flavor was a bit bland.  Will need to spice it up next time.  EASY way to cook and cut spaghetti squash!

I'm so happy I found this easy way to cook the squash!  I used the cooked strands with my favorite meat sauce and I'll never go back to regular pasta again.  Low calorie and just as yummy! 
 With leftover strands, I sauteed veggies I had on hand (broccoli, red and yellow bell pepper, onion) in olive oil and added it to the squash with feta cheese and made another fantastic dish!  I can't wait to make my next spaghetti squash and it use it as a base for even more recipes!

This works well and produces delicious strands of squash. However after trying a second time I realize you must prick the skin deeply or the squash will appear hard. Also, be sure the squash fits in the slow cooker with the lid on. The second one I did was too big and ended up taking 8 hours on high rather than 4.

So nice to have the squash cooked when I got home from work! I prefer it roasted, but this recipe makes up for it by a lot with convenience. Side note, you’ll get longer “noodles,” if you cut it in half the other way.

My family likes spaghetti squash more than I do, but we all enjoyed this treatment. Only change was using a half-cup of water. Will do again.

This way of cooking worked really well. My crock-pot only has the 4 to 6 hour setting in high, so put on 8 hour low setting and took out when done at 6 hours.
The squash was very tender and very easy to get out of shell.

Easy way to cook spaghetti squash without having to cut it into half when raw. As per previous reviews I only used half a cup of water and cooked the squash on low for 3.5 hours. I think next time I would cook it a bit longer as it was still a tad raw. Would definitely recommend this method.

This was my first time to try spaghetti squash.  Instead of using the slow cooker I used my steamer.  I steamed it about an hour and cooled, cut and took out the shreds as directions stated.  I topped it with some spaghetti sauce and parmesan cheese. It was wonderful.

It couldn't have been any easier!! 5 1/2 hours on low and it was perfect! I served it with a tomato meat sauce the first meal and had enough for a side dish for a second meal; I tossed it with zuchini chunks, olive oil and some seasonings! Magnifique!!

Wonderful way to cook it during the hot summer months.  This works great if you're not in a big hurry for it.  A friend of mine gave me several and I've been cooking them all weekend.  I plan on freezing the strands for dishes later on!

This was the first time I served spaghetti squash. It's amazing how much it tastes like pasta! The texture is similar to noodles also. I like it better than whole wheat noodles.  I'm a fan.  This recipe has 3 stars because the squash became mushy and watery at and below the water line. Next time I'll try baking it in the oven.

I gave it five stars for how easy it was to make and how well it turned out.   I enjoy spaghetti squash, but had trouble making it in the past in the microwave (cooking time was never consistent based on size of squash).   This option will alway be my "go to".    So, so easy with no mess and the texture of the squash was perfect!

maybe my squash was smaller than the directions call for, but it came out over cooked. Next time I will not cook it as long.

So much better than cooking in the oven!  I will try using chicken broth the next time I cook the squash. It might add more depth of flavor.

I will never make spaghetti squash any other way!! 

It's so difficult to cut when it's raw but when you put it in the slow cooker you put it in whole so there's no cutting until after it's done cooking so the skin gets soft and super easy to cut.

Side notes: make sure you use a lot of salt or Mrs Dash on your spaghetti squash because it's very very bland without it, even if you put a sauce on top of it.
Also... a friend baked it in the oven once without pricking any holes in the squash and it exploded in her oven so make sure you do that...

This worked perfectly.  I think I left my squash cooking for closer to seven hours and it still turned out great.
