Super SUPER easy!  I was looking for a peanut butter recipe for my husband who doesn't like chocolate (how kooky is that??) and when I happened across this one, I figured I'd give it a shot since he loves marshmallow creme too.  And WOW was this a big hit!!  Thanks so much for posting it!  It's a keeper!

While making this recipe, I noticed the huge amount of sugar,so I only put in 2 cups instead of three, and still it came out incredibly sweet! Tastes good, but wayyyy too rich and sweet.if I  ever make it agan, I'll only use maybe half a cup of sugar...However, now that we've tasted them over a week later, everyone seems to start liking them! They seem to taste much less sweet, now that they are a bit drier. Perfect texture now. I guess the longer they stay, the better they get!

This is an awesome recipe, and you can make two batches out of 1 12oz can of evaporated milk, mine doesn't turn out like the picture, maybe cuz I use real butter, but I also use Reese Peanut Butter chips, and pour the bag in, so good, my husband and 2 sons will eat the whole batch if I let them. It has now become a family tradition to make this fudge.

I love this recipe and so does wveryobe at my job! Instead of using the peanut butter chips, I use a 1 1/4 cup peanut butter as its easier to combine in the end and makes for a creamier fudge.

This one was way too sweet. I made two batches and cut out one cup of sugar in the second batch but it didn't make too much of a difference but it was softer than the first batch (it was as hard as a rock and crumbled when cut).

Made two different fudges I found on Allrecipes and this one was the biggest hit. Almost every piece is gone and still have about a quarter of the other left. I will definitely be making this one from now on. Simple enough to make. I pre measured everything so it will be ready once the mix was boiling. Defiantly one to try if your wondering about making it.
