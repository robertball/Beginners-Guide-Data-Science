I made a few changes to this recipe and even my picky son liked it! After I breaded the chicken I browned them to a golden brown. I didn't have enough munster cheese so I mixed in mozzerela cheese too. I then took low sodium cream of chicken soup, diced up 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup chicken broth and heated for the gravy. Poured this over the top of the chicken and baked as indicated. It turned out so tender that we didn't need a knife. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent, tasty chicken dish!  This recipe is so easy and simple to make.  The proportion for each ingredient in this recipe is perfect. The cream of chicken soup and Muenster cheese go very well with each other.  May I suggest the addition of canned, sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced green onion on top of the Muenster cheese before adding the cream of chicken soup in order to add more taste and color to this wonderful dish.  However, the recipe is excellent as it is. I will definitely make this excellent chicken recipe again.

While this dish was pretty good, my husband and I both thought something in the taste was just not quite right.  I think next time I will either dillute the soup a bit to make the taste less powerful, or perhaps use a little soup as a gravy instead of using a whole can.  I will try this recipe again.

I think this chicken came out okay, but nothing special. It seemed really dry to me and I followed the recipe exactly.

It's a five because I changed a few things:  1. Definitely brown the chicken in some olive oil - then sprinkle with salt.  Use only 3/4 of the can of cream of chicken and add some water (1/4 c or little less). I also topped it with parmesean cheese.  My 3 year old daughter, who is very picky, loved it!

This is a tasty way to make chicken. What I don't agree with is the "Rinse Chicken". You are NOT supposed to rinse chicken.  Rising the chicken does not clean it at all. What it does do is cross contaminate your kitchen by spreading the potential bacteria around. Even the USDA is against rinsing meats.

The first time I made this (exactly to the recipe) I too found it a bit bland.  Now when I make it I marinade the chicken breasts the night before in zip lock bags with chicken broth, garlic, and whatever spices I happen to feel like.

My family enjoyed this chicken dish.  Very easy to make.  I used cream of mushroom soup and added a clove of minced garlic to the soup.  I didn't use a whole can of soup.  Half of the can was plenty.

This was so good! Approved by picky hubby who dislikes anything with chicken, and my 12 yr old daughter loved it. I made this exactly recipe states and chicken came out extremely juices and perfect. This dish has already been requested for next week.

I found this chicken somewhat bland. The cream of chicken soup flavor did not infuse at all with the chicken. I coated with munster and provolone cheeses and used italian breadcrumbs. My bf loved it so I'm willing to try it again. Overall it was something new.

This was rediculously good although making it was so easy I was worried it would be bland and boring but I was so wrong. The chicken was moist and juicy and had a wonderful flavor... my picky boyfriend who doesnt really like new things said he liked it and would like me to make it again and my even pickier 6 yr old raved about it and wants to eat it again!

Simply delicious! Especially if you're a cheese lover! The only changes I made:  didn't have enough Munster cheese, so I added Monterey Jack and Parmesan. Also added green onion and a little garlic powder. I will say it tasted better leftover the next day! Yum! In the future, when I cook this I will add artichoke hearts to give it a little tang, which I felt it was lacking.

This was a new and easy way to bake chicken. I will probably make it again sometime if I have Muenster slices to use up but would most likely not make a special point to get the ingredients.... it was good but not "wow".

This was good, but not something one could eat often - a bit rich.  I could see where people were coming from with the bland comments, although it allowed me to really taste the cheese, and I think next time I would try browning the breaded chicken first.  I was too lazy.

This is a satisfying way to have chicken.  Makes the chicken really tender.  I changed it a bit for our tastes - make it with chicken tenderloins instead of breasts (easier to work with and more tender), and used LOTS of shredded cheddar cheese instead of Muenster.  Makes the sauce so cheesy!!  I also add more cream of chicken just so everything's covered.  This makes great leftovers too especially if you double or triple the recipe.

Delicious!  I had thin breast, so I breaded it, and browned it as other viewers suggested.  I then rolled them up and placed them into the baking dish.  I sprinkled a little ionized salt on top, and then in the same pan that I browned the chicken in, I warmed cream of mushroom soup (3/4 of a can) with some milk.  I placed the cheese, on top, then the soup mixture, then some sprinkled parm cheese over that.  So, so yummy!  My husband already requested it again soon.

I made this for dinner last night & it was good (& easy!)  I only had about 7-8 oz. of sliced Muenster cheese, but that seemed like enough (I covered each piece of breaded chicken with a slice of cheese) and I mixed the can of cream of chicken soup with a little milk (& the REMAINING egg that I dipped the chicken in).  It just made it easier to spread.  Baked (loosely) covered with foil for 25 minutes at 375 and then uncovered and baked for 20minutes more at 350.  Was perfectly tender and the flavors blend well in the creamy sauce.  Served with steamed broccoli.  We'll make it again sometime when we need an easy dinner.  Oh! and I might not bother with the breading next time, if hubby's make on his Low-Carb diet.

My husband made this for me. He said that when he went to the store to get the ingredients he had in his head that it required dried ranch seasoning (for salad dressing). When he got back he realized it didn't need it but put in a packet with the 3/4 cup of plain bread crumbs (not the Italian ones that the recipe calls for). It added a nice ranch flavor that went well with the cheese and chicken. So if you're looking for a variation or a way to add more flavor you might want to try this. We both thought it was very good.

This was just "okay" for us. Nothing really special. I agree with others it is lacking flavor. It just tasted like baked chicken with chicken soup.

I agree with the last reviewer that it's lacking in flavor.  But, my whole family ate this without complaining and it was an easy recipe to prepare so techinically I'd give it "4.5" stars.  I made with mashed potatoes and spooned the sauce on top.

This chicken was awesome and so easy to make! I agree that it was a little salty so I need to think about how I'll reduce that next time. I wonder if there is a reduced fat/sodium muenster in the deli and maybe mixing 1/2 can of soup with low fat milk would be a healthy but still tasty alternative. Also, I think 12ozs of cheese was too much. I layered it on top of the chicken and then another layer on top of the soup in the last 15 minutes and still didn't get to the 12ozs. I also sprinkled about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs on top of the soup mix to give it a nice look. Can't wait til' hubby tastes this one! :-)

I made this recipe a long time ago and am finally writing a review. My family absolutely loves when I make this. My man especially likes it so much that he wanted it renamed after him. So, when I tell him I'm making Chicken Angelo, he corrects me and says, "you mean chicken Tony?" It's simple and delicious and we like it served over rice.

This dish is delicious.  I brown the chicken breasts after coating with bread crumbs after reading reviews.  I also sprinkle cheddar cheese or parmesan, whatever I have on hand, and broil for 5 mins. after the dish cooks. Excellent.

cream of mushroom (with a little red wine added), instead of cream of chicken really improves this dish in my view.

This was a quick, tasty chicken dish. It was very rich. I added an entire can of milk to the soup so we could have more souce (we ate this with rice and green beans). The only downside is it isn't very "pretty" - more like a casserole. It's fine for family, but I wouldn't serve to guiests.

This was pretty good!  The nutty taste of Muenster does wonders to this chicken.  I use Ritz crackers finely crumbled instead of bread crumbs.  It's a keeper!

i will have to rerate this after we try it. i read all the reviews before making it so i made made a few changes. i only had 8 oz of muenster, so i only used 8oz; i used half seasoned bread crumbs to half flour;i used half a can of cream of mushroom soup, about a half a can of chicken broth mixed with an envelope chicken gravy and a 1/2 a cup of milk.  after transfering the chicken to the casserole dish i poured the gravy mixture into the pan i browned the chicken in and used a whisk to get all the yummy brown bits up. looks very good, cant wait to try it.well we loved it, the gravy turned out perfect, im gonna remeber to try that method with some other recipes. the chicken turned out very juicy and i think 8 oz of cheese was just the right amount. maybe next time i will try this recipe with a little stronger flavored cheese like cheddar. i will definatley make this again.

I liked this recipe, but it needed "something", and I'm not sure what. It was pretty good, but I think next time I will add a slice of tomato on top of the chicken (and under the cheese), and season it somehow. I'm not sure - it just could've had more flavor than it did.

This recipe is great...Made as stated, but I felt it needed something extra. Next time I made it, I used the Cream of Chicken with Herbs and that took it from fairly ordinary to extraordinary with no extra work! Thanks!

This is the second time I've made this dish and it is FABULOUS!  My hubby was sick with the flu and this is the only thing he begged for.  You can substitute other cheeses or Italian breadcrumbs and it still turns out great!

This was easy and good. I went with one of the reviews and used chicken gravy instead of soup and liked that way.  The other way seemed too salty per reviews.

My this recipe is SALTY!!! I even used Campbell's Healthy Request soup, which has lower sodium. I should have listened to other reviewers who said not to use the soup straight, but to thin it with water or milk.  This would have been fine with just the breading and cheese and *no* sauce. The sauce doesn't add much, in my opinion. I'd rather taste the chicken and the cheese.

This was a very easy dish to make that is even better the next day.  The kids ate it up, company raved, and even got my hubby to wash the dishes in appreciation.  I'm not a chicken fan, but then again I was never creative in cooking it either!  Thanks for the recipe, will make again.

I made it according to directions. Chicken was very tender and juicy and I think the flavors are perfect together. I cooked it for 50 minutes and then put it under the broiler until lightly brown and bubbly. Insanely easy and delicious! Served mine with green beans amandine. Yum!

This was so easy to make and so good to eat! Some variations I made to this meal was using Cream of Chicken with Herb soup to add some extra flavor and putting cooked stuffing on top of the chicken before layering the cheese.

I only give it 4 stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe. I omitted the egg and bread crumbs and added a tiny bit of milk to make the cream of chicken soup smooth, but it was still really good! Excellent flavor.

Easy to make and finicky kids enjoy so that is always a major plus. Don't be tempted to season chicken with salt when preparing (as I did) as the soup adds plenty of saltiness to the overall taste.

Very moist and delicious. I mixed cream of potatoe and cream of chicken soup and it was great! Served with steamed broccoli and it made a quick and easy dinner. My husband said it reminded him of stuffing - he loved the "sauce"

This recipe has become a standing favorite of mine.  The chicken turns out very juicy and tender.  I use 2 chicken breasts since I make this for 2 people, but I still use almost a whole can of soup.  I think it makes just the right amount of cheesy sauce for the chicken.

We liked this recipe.  I loved the Muenster cheese!  I followed the recipe exactly, and did not feel that it tasted too soupy as mention by other reviewers.  I will definitely make it again.  Very easy!

This chicken dish was so delicious & was very easy to prepare!  Had a block of Muenster cheese that needed to be used & Allrecipes came up with this when I searched ingredient.

Have made this several times and everybody Loves this! I did, like many others, make a few changes. I typically only use what's on hand so instead of muenster cheese, I topped the breaded and browned chicken with pepper jack. I also mix the (cream of mushroom) soup with 1/2 cup chicken broth and two slices of american cheese to make it even cheesier. Absolutely amazing- perfect extra gravy for rice on the side.

so, my husband liked this a lot. I wasn't a big fan. it seemed a little slimy or a little off in taste. i'm not sure cream of chicken was a good choice here? i did change the recipe according to other reviews. 5-6 chicken breasts, 1 egg beaten, 3/4 C breadcrumbs, 6oz mexican cheese mix, 6oz mozzarella cheese, 1 can cream of chicken, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 C chicken broth. after putting egg and breadcrumbs on the chicken, I baked it for 5-10 min. The rest of the ingredients i had heated on a pan on the stove and mixed up. poured it over the chicken and cooked for another 20 min.

I browned the chicken before baking it in the oven. It came out of the oven looking fabulous. The cheese melted to a wonderful warm brown color. It was a bit lacking in flavor for me. But all the boys (ages 4-33) said it was good....so, it's a keeper for sure!

UM DELISH!! My husband LOVES this and so do I. The muenster gives it a great flavor! I'm going to try all sorts of cheeses in the future, but the muenster give it great color and melts wonderfully!

My son and I both loved this recipe. I used turkey tenderloins in place of the chicken. As other reviewers suggested, I used cream of chicken with herbs soup to add a little extra flavor, which I thinned out with approx. 1/2 cup of skim milk. Threw in a few fresh mushrooms and the dish was complete.

Initially, I served this recipe to a dear friend. Not only did she LOVE it, she wanted the recipe so she, in turn, could prepare it for her husband. I, then, prepared it for my gentleman friend who ALSO loved it. It has been determined by those whom I love that this is truly a keeper. I always strictly follow a recipe the first time I prepare it; however, with this recipe, I will always follow the recipe. It is truly wonderful.

Delish!! This recipe tastes great and is easy to make.  I topped the breaded chicken with steamed broccoli, mozzarella, and two cans of soup diluted with almost a can of milk. I baked according to the recipe and it turned out great. I served it with rice and the family gobbled it up!  This recipe will be a commonly requested in our house. I look forward to trying it with crumbled bacon and Cheddar cheese. Thanks, EllenMarie!

my entire family loved this one. even my picky children. i made it exactly as the recipe states. we loved it over rice. next time i might thin the soup a tad. the saltiness others complain of is not from the soup but the cheese. that's just how it tastes. if you don't like the taste of muenster you could try mozzarela instead.

I don't eat meat, but I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it, his favorite recipe that I've gotten from the site, so far. Only thing I changed was using Mozzarella instead of Muenster.

I made this recipe multiple times and have adjusted the preperation each attempt.  Although it was good as is, I like most of you probably are, enjoy giving it my own twist.  Recently I decided to marinate the chicken for 6 hours prior in a cup of chicken broth infused with garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, and a 1/2 cup of ranch.  Next, followed the recipe until it came to covering the cheese with strictly the soup.  Instead, I mixed the soup with 1 cup of the marinade.  Amazing!!!

Three stars only because it was so easy to make. You have to really like cream of chicken soup to enjoy this dish.  I thought it was too bland, but the chicken was very tender and my 2-year-old loved it.

This tasted very good and the chicken was quite tender. I used only an 8 oz package of muenster cheese slices and that seemed like plenty. I also used the low fat and low sodium chicken soup. I would have liked it better if the sauce was a little less thick. Very easy though - I loved that part!

This recipe was almost too easy for it to be really good.  I was wrong!  I did not use the Cream of Chicken soup (I did not have any).  I substituted Campbell's Chicken Gravy and we loved it!  I may not ever find out what it really tastes like since I always have the chicken gravy handy!
