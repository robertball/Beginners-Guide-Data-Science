Oh. My. Gosh! This was AWESOME! The only thing about this recipe is that next time I have to make DOUBLE! My whole family loved it! We tripled the curry just because we felt like 1 tsp was a little mild, and next time I might add some garam marsala to heat it up a bit more (we love spicy LOL) but seriously folks...as is this is a fantastic recipe! Easy to make, I sauteed everything BUT the rice, curry, and broth in a pan until it was brown, then added a little broth to get all the yummy bits off the bottom. Then I just dumped the entire contents of the pan, plus the rice and broth, into our rice cooker and Voila! My hubby walked in and insisted on 'taste testing' right away, and between him and the kids (17, 13, and 5) we didn't have any left! Thanks so much, this just got added to our weekly menu!

HELPFUL TIPS: A can of broth has 2C and since this is usually for my husband & toddlers, I halve the recipe using 3/4C rice and 3/4th a can of broth.  That way I don't have to open up a second can.  For 2 picky toddlers, they give this 2 thumbs up! What kid can resist rice (which is a lot like their baby food) if it contains craisins! I like them better than plain ol raisins.  Also, instead of going through trouble of toasting almonds, I use "Almond Accents" found next to salads or dressings at the store.  Any flavor (they have ranch, honey flavored, etc) works very well and they're already toasted and sliced!  Not to mention you can use the rest of the bag to top your salads.  Outside of that, this definitely needs a T of curry (used almost 2tsp if you halve the recipe), and I prefer using half oil, half butter b/c the rice turns out better and cooks the curry like other indian dishes require (for 5 minutes constant stirring). Also can do this in one pot by adding it all in while browning rice except broth, almonds, craisins.

This is a really pretty, colorful, flavorful and different side dish! I doubled the curry following the lead of previous revievers and still found it very mild, not nearly prominent enough. Curry has a delicious flavor that is not hot, so it could easily be tripled in this recipe. Leave out the raisins if you must (and as hubby would have preferred) but the toasted almonds are a must!

This was delish. I used brown rice instead of white and olive oil instead of butter.  I also added mushrooms.  It was really good. The almonds added a really good crunch.

I've made this several times now, and my whole family really likes it. I've made it with both white rice and brown rice and they're both good. I double the curry powder and garlic, halve the butter, and omit the raisins. I also like to add some veggies. (a grated carrot or two, some broccoli, etc. Love the almonds - this is a great recipe!

Wow. I made this and I needlessly worried my family would not like but they LOVED it. 

I made it exactly as instructed in the recipe, except I put in considerably more curry powder, as I enjoy a stronger flavor. 

My household consists of me, my husband, two teens, one toddler and my elderly, ill father-in-law. Every single one of them had seconds or, in my son's case, thirds! 

Easy to make and delicious! I will definitely be making this often.

I loved this dish!  Instead of green onions I used white onions.  I doubled the curry powder.  I added a cup of chick peas to make it more filling.  And, I added the raisins in with the rice and broth to cook and soften.

Great and easy. I like to use more healthy options, so I think I'll use a wild rice blend next time, but this really had the perfect amount of seasonings and flavor. And nice and easy - thank you!

Really good.  Just-right seasoning and amounts of onions, raisins, and almonds.  I did substitute olive oil for half of the butter.  Delicious and attractive dish.

I had to leave the raisins out of this dish because I would not have liked it at all that way. Turns out, we didn't particulary care for this rice anyway. Even with added curry, the flavor is too mild. For any prominant flavor at all, you must add the almonds. This recipe seems to be a good starting point, but other seasonings need to be added to give it more taste appeal.

Nice easy, tasty meal. The toasted almonds and raisins are excellent together. I tripled the amount of curry, and it still could have used more. Also, it needs more heat. I added half of a diced jalapeno with the garlic, but it still wasn't quite enough.

Also, definitely add fresh cilantro as a garnish at the end.

REALLY good recipe! I used a couple tbsps of olive oil instead of butter. Chopped a half a white onion, 1 stalk of celery and grated a carrot in additon to the green onion. I just sauteed the veggies in a pot then added the rice and broth when the veggies were soft. Bring to boil, reduce to low and simmer for about 18 minutes. stirred in the raisins and nuts (I used walnuts) and the rest of the green onions. Thumbs up from hubby, and our 5, 4, 2, and 1 year old kids! Great recipe!

Love love love this dish! I doubled the recipe and added red pepper flakes, a shredded rotisserie chicken, carrots, and broccoli to this to make a meal out it. This is one of our favorite dishes! I make it at least once a week.

I made this tonight and it was a hit.  It smelled and tasted *wonderful*!.  only changes I made were to use 1/8c butter and 2t curry powder.  Will be making again.  Note: the almonds and raisins were good...but even if I had left them out, the rice would have been great itself.

This recipe was easy to follow and had great flavor.  I omitted the raisins though b/c my hubby doesn't like them in food.  I would definitely make this again and serve it to company.

This was an excellent side dish! I doubled the recipe because I was serving 12 people. I also gave a heaping measure of curry because I like it. I took the advice of another cook and used the almond slivers found near the bagged salad at the grocery. I will definitly be adding this to my list of favorites. It pairs well with the Honey Baked Chicken II from this site. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe with olive oil instead of butter and without the raisins and almonds (we're very plain like that). I also added Jennie-O Turkey Sweet Italian Sausage for some protein to make this an entree. It came out amazing! Will def make again and share with friends and family.

I really enjoy the flavor of curry. Some people say that curry is spicy. I have never thought that. You can get dishes with curry that are spicy. But I never thought that curry itself was all that spicy. I made this dish as the recipe state only substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth (we have a vegetarian in the family). My husband had never had curry before and didn't know what to expect, neither had my resident vegetarian. This recipe was a HUGE hit. We all enjoyed it very much. I really thought this recipe would be a great addition to the Thanksgiving table. Not only was it delicious, it was really pretty to look at. Thank you for sharing this really excellent recipe. We will be making this one again.

Great rice dish, and really versatile.  I used craisins and garnished with parsley to look festive for Christmas.  The curry was mellow enough that I didn't feel like it overpowered the other food at the table.  I'll definitely make this again, but I'll only make half the recipe for our family of five.  This was more like eight servings.

Love this rice dish-bursting with flavor! I added carrot slivers & a handful from fresh cilantro at end-also used cranberries instead of raisins as it was for a Christmas party. Will be making this one on a regular basis-so yummy!

This was fine, but nothing special. We served it with cedar plank salmon, steamed broccoli, and a delicious curried salad. The pilaf complimented all of these but it was the other dishes that stole the show. Perhaps show stopping isn't the job of a pilaf, though?

Friday night dinner and not wanting to go out for ingredients.  This was a great solution.  Very good tasty and flexible to changes with what's in the pantry.  My substitutions were chopped, dried apricots for raisins and cashews for almonds.  Next time I will use almonds - a bit more crunch. I will make this again.

I really like this rice!  I think the almonds and the raisins really make the dish.  I used brown rice to make it more healthy and added 2 cans of chicken broth. The first time I made this on the stove and I think there wasn't enough liquid because the rice still turned out a little hard. The second time I made it I added water to the chicken broth and threw everything into the rice cooker except the almonds. Turned out great and was even easier to do!

Made this with Jenny's Grilled Chicken Breast.  Left out the raisins and almonds, doubled the curry and added mushrooms.  We really liked this recipe.

This was great! I used brown long grain rice and also vegetable stock (4 cups because brown rice needing to cook a bit longer) instead of the chicken stock. I would definitely make this again.

Great recipe to start with - I made a few adjustments.  I used jasmine rice, which didn't have to cook as long (maybe 20 min total), tripled the curry, added a dash of soy sauce, omitted the raisins and used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Overall this probably didn't affect the flavor much, but just some personal preferences - and this is one I'll be making again and again!

Delicious and easy to make!  Add in a bit of extra curry powder to really get that curry flavor out.

I made this rice the other day for my family.   It was really YUMMY and tasted great with the kebabs that I made on the grill.  I didn't have raisins onhand, so I didn't use them.  Don't leave out the toasted almonds....they really made the dish.  It seemed to be done earlier than the recipe time, so I would advise you to watch it.  I didn't think that my husband would like it, but he did and was looking for the leftovers in the fridge the next day (he usually isn't very good at using leftovers).

Wow! Was this easy and delicious! No more boring rice. I followed the recipe but tripled the curry and sprinkled in a little cayenne to add zip. Instead of plain raisins I used a mix of golden raisins, dark raisins and dried cranberries. Didn't even need to toast the almonds but I'm sure it would make this even more delicious if possible! I will make this often because it doesn't overpower the other food on the plate. Served it with a seared ribeye and green beans. Maybe next time with chicken or grilled shrimp on top. Awesome!

I ended up not using the exact measurements as stated in the recipe, but it definitely was great as a guide in terms of doing something different with rice. I browned the garlic and onion on the stove and to save time, put rice in my rice cooker with vegetable stock, curry powder, apricot, cashews, the cooked garlic and onions and avoila! Everybody loved it!

This recipe was wonderful, I added more garlic and more curry, just personal preference.  With those changes it had lots of flavor, this will be a staple in my house.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I made this dish for dinner with our Christmas goose. They complemented each other perfectly! Also, my husband and sister-in-law said they didn't like curry. But they loved this! They both said it was their favorite side dish!

I'm giving this a four just because i don't think this would have been nearly as good without my modifications.

I used olive oil instead of butter, more curry powder, more rice, a dash of nutmeg, added the raisins in while it cooked and then tossed it with already made made honey roasted almonds after

This is a nice side dish.  If made with multi-grain rice and a little less butter, it tastes great and is quite healthy.  I didn't have almonds, so I put toasted walnuts instead, and it was still delicious.

We loved this pilaf, but only after I tweaked the recipe! It definitely needs more spice. Only a half tsp of curry would have been drowned out by the chicken broth in my opinion! I actually used 1-1/2 tsp of curry and another 1/2 tsp of garam masala. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt, but that might have been because I use low-sodium chicken broth! My rice was falling apart at 30 minutes on simmer, so next time I'll turn off the heat at 25 minutes. I would like to try this with Texmati brown rice, see if I can make it a little healthier and make the rice stay together a little better. Also, 2 TBS of butter and 2 TBS of olive oil did just fine for me. I'd rather not use that much butter in a rice dish. All in all, a great pilaf that we'll definitely make many times with the changes!

This has become one of my favorite rice recipes.  I am gluten free and finding a rice dish with flavor is an adventure.
The dish is not spicy, just a warm flavor.  The curry powder softens during cooking and the raisins are a perfect contrast.  Easy to  make too.

Delicious. Followed to a T albeit the anise seasoning (I thought I had some, but didn't). My father doesn't care for rice and had a second helping of this keeper!

I made this with a seven seas curry and it came out tasting kind of like... too much. Next time I'll add a little less curry and a little more chicken-flavor. All the curry made it taste kind of dry.

It was ok, but not great. -- certainly easy enough. But there was something about this that left a bitter taste. It was improved with a side of fresh tomatoes, but still not quite right. I might play with this a bit to bring out its full potential next time.

This is a wonderful, delicious recipe.  I was looking for a rice side dish recipe using ingredients I had and, oddly enough, I had almonds and golden raisins both.  But no green onion so I used a regular onion, and lots of it.  Thank you so much for this fantasic delight!

This was really really good.  I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I know some people get upset when others rate a recipe according to changes - but I believe the recipe is still a close resemblance to the original.  I made it with minute rice. Taste great and only took about 10 minutes to cook once I browned the rice. I didn't have chicken broth so I diluted chicken soup base in water and I didn't have raisins but had intended on using them.  After tasting the rice - i'm not sure raisins would have worked.  This dish tasted a lot like rice a roni.  I will be making it again.  Haven't decided if I'll add the raisins though!

this recipe is so delicious!  i used jasmine brown rice and 2 teaspoons of madras curry powder and it was the perfect amount of seasoning.  It does not taste like a 'curry dish', but a  very flavorful nicely seasoned have-to-have another serving rice dish.  i used college inn brand white wine and herb broth instead of chicken because that is what i had in my pantry.  i also used pecan pieces instead of almonds because that is what i had on hand as well. i used chopped onions to saute with the garlic and used the green onions after it was done and added quickly sauteed chopped carrots for color tossed in the end with the golden raisins and pecans.  i am saying you have to try this because it is over the top and a wonderful dish to tantilize your palate!  i made it for a covered dish for work tomorrow and could hardly keep from eating it! thanks for the recipe and i will definitely make it again, and with whatever i have on hand as the recipe is very versatile.

Definately hit the spot. Based on comments and personal preferences I used diced dried apricots instead of raisins. For step 2 I tossed rice and broth in my rice cooker (basmati is a one to one ratio in rice cookers). Have tossed everything into the rice cooker as well, but didn't turn out as crunchy.

Thanks to BellevueMama for the idea of adding the Garam Marsala and to Lee for the wonderful recipe. I took the advice and added the marsala and the family really loved it.  They don't usually like "fancy foods", but I thought I would give this a try and it was great!  Thanks to you both!

I've made this recipe twice now, both times with fantastic results.  I made a few changes, though.  First, I tripled the amount of curry powder following a previous user's recommendations.  Second, I realized I didn't have enough chicken broth (only 1 cup) the second time I made this and didn't want to go to the store just for that.  Instead, I used the 1 cup of broth, added 2 cups of water and then increased the salt to 1 teaspoonful.  As for the almonds, I set my oven to 300 degrees F (arbitrarily), spread 1/2 cup of slivered almonds on a baking sheet, and stuck them in for about 10-15 minutes, while the rice was simmering.  After the 10-15 minutes, I turned the oven off but left the almonds inside until the rice was done simmering.  They were so crunchy and warm :).  Btw, I didn't really taste too much of a difference between the first result and second result, despite the difference in amount of chicken broth used.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a good recipe.  I have varied it a bit, at times...when I don't have green onions, I use a regular onion.  I also add in about 1/2 cup of toasted pine nuts.  The last time I made it, I didn't have chicken broth, so I used 4 cups of vegetable broth (made with 2 vegan bouillon cubs), and it was fine.  I also use brown rice instead of white.   Overall, a good recipe as is, but also turns out well with a few variations.

This was awesome.  Subtile flavor even though I did take from the other reviews and added a totaly of 1 teaspoon of curry powder.  However, next time I will put the rasins in a short time before all the moisture is gone to help plump the raisins.  All in all, this was great and a definate keeper!

We liked this pilaf. We added mushrooms, and omitted the almonds. Next time though, we will use 2 or 3 times the amount of suggested curry powder, as it was too mild for our palate!

It was really good.  I had to add extra curry powder since the suggested amount was very little.  I'll be making this again, but next time I will add some peas, carrots or some other vegetable to it.

Very good compliment to AR's: Grilled Chicken Thighs Tandoori.  If you like curry, you may want to add more--the 1/2 t. just gives it a very subtle hint of curry.  I didn't add the raisins, but, still very good.

Great recipe! I used 2 tsp of curry powder as others suggested. This ended up tasting like the right amount. Also followed others' suggestions and added the raisins to the rice/broth mixture so they would soak up the moisture and come out more plump. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic!  I made a few modifications.  I omitted the raisins and used jasmine rice (that was all I had on hand) which lessened the cooking time.  This is my hubby's favorite side dish.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! My boyfriend and I like to use half a white onion instead of the green onion and 3 teaspoons of curry (which isn't too spicy - really punches up the flavour.) Good as a side dish or a main course if you throw in some red peppers and prawns :)

This was an easy, versitile, and delicious rice dish. I was making Crumb Coated Chicken Thighs, from this site, and this was the perfect side dish.  I did make some modifications - extra onions and curry, olive oil instead of butter, used a brown/wild rice mix, and added a can of peas at the end. I didn't bother heating the broth and felt the salt was unnecessary as broth has so much. I was out of raisins and can't wait to make it with them. This will become a regular rice dish for us. Thanks

This is quite good. My husband loved it but I thought it was a bit on the salty side--perhaps because there was salt already added to the broth. I used white onions instead of green, olive oil instead of butter/margarine, and toasted sunflower seeds instead of almonds (b/c I ran out). This mix worked well. I would make this again.

Really good! Omitted the nuts, not crazy about crunchy stuff in my rice. Otherwise, followed exactly as written. Nice light but still flavorful side dish. Paired well with Chicken Fried Chicken (from this website--best chicken EVER!)

It tasted really good.  I halved everything because I was only cooking for 2, but I put in 1 1/4 tsp curry.  I just couldn't imagine it tasting "good" without that much curry.  I didn't have any almonds but I know i like raisins in my rice, so i doubled the raisins too.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was amazing. I added a bit more curry for more flavor but besides that it was perfect. Will add this to more more favorite side dishes. For you health nuts....try using a multi grain rice and cut back on the butter.

This was absolutely delightful. A few modifications I made: Added some chopped turkey as well as green pepper, so it made this a bit more of an entree dish. I also added a bit of cumin. Turned out I didn't have enough rice as well, so I did half rice and half barley, meaning I cooked this for slightly longer then the recipe called for. I just finished off the last of it tonight, and wish I'd made more!

I really liked this. Had to add an extra teaspoon of curry powder to increase the flavour and added an extra cup of water. The flavour was subtle and the raisins (I used crasins) added just the right amount of sweetness.

This is a great starting point for folks like myself, looking for something easy and different.  I made a few adjustments: as a lot of people here have said, I added more curry.  1/2 tsp just isn't enough.  I put in about 2 tsp, but will probably go for 1 tbsp next time.  I also find that about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of cinnamon gives it an additional, subtle flavor that compliments the dish.  I sauteed some chick peas on the side with garlic and onions, then mixed them in at the end.  But the biggest and best substitution would be that I used quinoa instead of rice for a healthier, protein-rich alternative.  Great dish!

I really liked this. I think for others it is an acquired to put raisins in a savory ride dish. This is suble in flavor but so pleasant to eat.  TY for sharing

This recipe was very easy to follow and my rice was a huge hit.  The second time I prepared this dish, I used two teaspoons of curry powder and enjoyed a new level of flavor. Thank you for this winning recipe!

Wonderful side dish! I turned this into Curried Rice-A-Roni by halving the rice and adding 3/4 cup broken angel hair pasta. I didn't add the raisins or almonds because I was serving along side of the Ham Slice with Pineapple-Orange sauce from this site which was also terrific. Will be making again.

great idea for a quick dish! I used instant brown rice, cooked and set aside. Fried up onions and garlic (doubled both), and doubled the curry powder. Stirred in rice and a couple cups of low sodium chicken broth. It bubbled away while I finished grilling the rest of dinner and served with diced green onions. Very yummy and fast!

I used whole grain brown rice---yum!
Makes more than four servings--more like eight.

This is a keeper and was actually a quick make. Only took about 10 min longer than making plain rice. I used fragrant jasmine rice and honestly it was absolutely a perfect match. Another wonderful dish that the entire family enjoyed. Will make again and again. Thank you :)

I used 1/2 a yellow onion in place of the green onion and evoo rather than butter. Also, i chose brown rice for the nutritional value. You can be generous with the curry powder too. I left out the raisins and the almonds just because they didn't sound good to me at the time and it was still delicious without them. Served with Tandoori Chicken and Gufrati (indian green beans).

WONDERFUL!! I would give this 10 stars if I could. We didn't add the green onions because we didn't have any. We also didn't add the raisins or the almonds. As other reviewers suggested we doubled the curry and it was perfect!  It was so yummy. My 1 year old and my "well defined taste" 5 year old loved it too!! This is definitely a keeper!

My husband and I made this again but did it a little differently so that we could make it more of a meal. I added diced chicken, zucchini and mushrooms. I boiled the chicken and then added it into the pan with the veggies. I sauted (sp?) them for about 10 minutes, we like the zucchini to still have a little crunch. I also sprinkled the chicken, zucchini and mushrooms with about 1/2 tsp. of curry. It was SO yummy and filling!

This was good. I didn't have any green onions so I used half an onion and I also left out the raisins and the almonds because I didn't have those either. Overall, it was pretty good. I would probably add about 1Tbs of curry powder next time. I can smell the curry, it just doesn't have that strong curry taste.

This rice came out amazing. I used jasmine rice, and homemade chicken broth, and omitted the raisins and almonds. My curry powder has been around for a while, so I had to use about 1.5 tsp of it to give it a proper presence. I highly suggest you create your own curry powder, if you grind your own spices then even better. Only then would I see 1/2 tsp being sufficient for this dish. That being said, I'm a pretty die hard curry fan so take my advice for what it's worth. This rice dish places somewhere up with risotto with my family.

Excellent flavor.  I tried lightening this up a bit  by using only 1 tbl olive oil and a tsp of butter.  It was so dry, I added another tbl of butter and it was still dry.  I will definitely make again, but with the full quotient of fat, probably half healthy oil and half butter.

This was sooo good! Hubby and I couldn't stop eating it! Only change I made was to use olive oil in place of the butter, and I probably added a bit more curry powder (didn't really measure). Oh, and I guess I threw the raisins in with the broth so they could plump up. Anyway, delicious! We both declared it our new favorite side dish!

This is the BEST rice ever. I added 1/4-1/2 teaspoons of ground cumin and dash of cumin seeds. I mixed the cumin & the curry powder along w the butter, garlic, and green onions. I used jasmine rice as well. Before covering, bring to a boil and let it boil for 2-3 minutes then cover and simmer. I let it simmer for 45-50 minutes. I also used vegetable broth instead and skipped out on the raisins.

Really easy to prepare and super yummy!  I served this with kabobs but was delish on its own.  I atually forgot to add the curry before the rice cooked, so I stired it in once the rice was done and it tasted great.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe for a party and served with kabobs.  Even guests who claimed they doesn't like curry flavors or fruits in rice dishes raved about this pilaf.  It is a very light curry flavor so when I make it again just for my hubby and me, I will add extra curry, but it's the perfect curry amount for feeding a crowd since flavors aren't overwhelming.  I used toasted slivered almonds and golden raisins.

Super yumz!  I followed some of the reviewers advice and added more curry 1-1/2 tsp, but will only add 1 tsp next time.  I used slivered almonds and toasted them, but would probably have tasted just as good without toasting.  If you are using brown rice like I did, you may find you want to add about 1/4 cup more of either chicken broth or water (if you want to cut down on the salt) if you want a more tender rice.  Thanks for the great recipe!

First time I've made this and it's excellent!  I used 1/3 more curry than called for and next time will use even more.  I also used Basmati rice.  Left out the golden raisins... didn't think my family would be into it.  Excellent recipe, though!  I'll be saving it, for sure!

Was very good for a change. Followed some advice and sauted everything except rice, curry and broth until brown and then added a bit of broth to get all the bits from the pan and then dumped everything into my rice cooker. Turned out very well.

Although i modifed this recipe to suit the ingredients i had in my kitchen, i would rate it a 5 based on my version.    I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain Perfection rice, which has a cooking time of only 10 minutes, and used 1 cup rice and 2 cups of broth to equal 6 servings.    I kept the amounts for the remaining ingredients the same, while omitting the salt altogether.  I used toasted pecans in place of almonds, and dried cranberries instead of the raisins, and will definitely do the same next time, both for taste and appearance.  The dish got rave reviews, and everyone had seconds.

I had been looking for a recipe for curry fried rice.  I used this as a base.  I just omitted to raisins and almonds and didn't hold back any onion.  I also used  a lot more curry.  more like 3 tablespoons.  but we really love curry.  It was delicious and the kids loved it!

I really enjoyed this rice dish! I love rice anyways...and am always looking for a different way to serve it. It was a hit with the family. I didn't use the amounts exactly...I more or less eye balled everything. But it turned out great! Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Only thing I did differently and it worked out fine was I used regular yellow onion diced instead of green onion and I didn't have almonds. Yummy!!

This was really good. I made quite a few changes based on other reviews and based on what I had on hand. 1) I used red curry because that is what I had - I also tripled it like other suggested. 2) I added 1/2 cup of shreaded carrots and 1/2 a cup of french cut green beans. 3) omitted the onion because I did not have one and added onion powder instead 4) I used walnuts instead of almonds 5)I used olive oil instead of butter. THIS recipe was great!

This dish is AMAZING.  I make it all the time because it is simple, fast, and delicious.  I triple the curry powder because I like spicy food and omit the onion.  I also add chicken to make it feel more like an entree.

Loved this recipe. I recommend cooking the rice about 10 minutes less than recommended. It was a little on the dry side, but that's mainly because we didn't watch it closely enough. This was fantastic along with Tarragon Grean Beans and also Tilapia with Pineapple Salsa.

I made one change and added one ingredient.  Instead of almonds, I used cashews.  And to add one more veggie component, I threw in a handful of frozen green peas when the rice had about 5 mins cooking time left.  Garnished with cilantro it was perfect - a little sweet, a little salty, a little spicy.

i love this! i love aromatic food, and the curry was just the ticket. i doubled the curry, though, and added 1/4 cup of chopped chives, and used cashew pieces instead of almonds. i also used chicken bouillon cubes instead of the canned one, so i thought i didn't need to add salt. turns out, it wasn't as salty as i wanted it to be, so i had to add salt anyway.

it turned out really great for the first try! i served it along with the Balinese Chicken Wings recipe on this site.

Excellent! I upped the curry powder to a tablespoon, and used olive oil instead of butter. Regular onion works just fine. This was flavorful and sophisticated.

This is not terrible...but not wonderful either.  It seems to be missing some sort of *BAM* flavor.  I may increase the salt and maybe some more spice.  Sort of bland.

The recipe as stated was a great inspiration but needed tweaking. A quarter cup of butter was way too much butter; I used a little over 1 Tbsp. and it was plenty. I sauteed the almond slivers with the onion to save a step, and added another 1/2 tsp. of curry powder. For a more Mediterranean feel, I used dates instead of raisins, and added diced persimmon, frozen peas, and diced chicken. NOTE: This made WAY more than 4 servings; more like 8-10, especially if used as a side dish. Half of it made enough for three adults as a main dish, with leftovers. Thanks for the idea!

LOVED THIS! The leftovers are my lunch today. I omitted the raisins (didn't have any) and used onion powder instead of green onions (didn't have any of these also). I served this with some crab cakes and it was a perfect side. I'll be making this alot more often!

This was awesome rice.  Great texture with the almonds.  The only thing I will change next time is cook all the onions with the rice.  I thought the raw onions over powered the rice.
