I thought these were great.  I did refer to my cookbook as to preparing the artichoke before boiling it - removed the choke, removed the discolored leaves, cut the top inch or so off the artichoke and then snipped the tips off the remaining leaves.

This is my first time making artichokes and theses were sooooo amazing and easy.  The grilling really does make a difference. These were better than I've had in a restaurant, and my boyfriend said they were the best he's had in his whole life.  I used more garlic and shallot than called for and it turned out great.  A tip to keep your artichokes under water while boiling is to invert a steamer on top of them.  Serve as well with mayonaise and fresh lemon wedges for a variety.  Oh, and by the way, a great way to remove the choke is to use a grapefruit spoon (if you have it)- it's easy to get it out whole that way!  Hope this helps!

The garlic butter dip was a big hit. Since it started to rain, we moved the grilling indoors to the broiler. I just broiled the artichokes for about 5 minutes and they were still great.

This was wonderful. I added a bit more garlic and shallots. Also, right before putting them on the grill, I put balasmic vinegar over top. I don't think I will artichokes any other way from now on, this is the way to go.

This was great and easy.  I made it for my visiting family who come in from artichoke country of Monterey California area.  They enjoyed the Texas mesquite smoke flavor from our grill. (We use only wood, not gas) I added half an onion to the boiling water, and 1/2 stick real butter with a squirt of lemon and sea salt.  I trimmed the sides and top and it had a great presentation as well.  I served with lemon cilantro butter and cilantro mayo but they enjoyed then as they were.  I will definatley do this again when entertaining.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Hate to toot my own horn, but I can't get enough of these.  Try sprinkling a little grated parmesan on the grill after basting with the butter.  I love shallots now, on everything.

YUMMERS! My kids have been addicted to artichokes since they were in pre-school, but unfortunately, they can be so darn pricey. So, being that we had no kids for dinner tonight, we decided to treat ourselves. I too steamed them and loved the fact that they were cut in half prior to cooking. Never did that before. Both hubs and I are big on garlic and onion and don't care about bad breath as long as we're both eating it! Great recipe, Nina, and thank you!!

These are fantastic. I used foil on the grill, which helped them not fall into the coals, and also used ridiculous amounts of garlic and shallot. We'll definitely make these again.

these artichokes are great!  i don't use the same sauce for dipping though.  i mix 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup real mayo and 1 tablespoon lemon juice.  PERFECT!

Pretty good. I felt it could use a bit more flavoring, however. Also ~ be careful when putting them on the grill after removing them from boiling water. Mine were VERY tender (yummy), but accidentaly dropped a few on the floor. After the fact, I almost think putting them on foil and then placing on the grill would be a better idea. The garlic and buttery taste is great. Overall ~ I'd give it 4 stars for flavor, but 3 stars (which I'm giving) for the vague directions.

These were great. I had never made artichokes before. I remove the choke after boiling, as it is much easier then. Also, I was out of charcoal, so I had baked them in the oven instead for about 6 minutes a side at about 350. Added more garlic and pepper for added flavor.

These were fantastic, I am so glad I made them.  I boiled them for about 20 mins, I think 30 would make them fall apart easily on the grill.  Like other reviewers I made much more of the basting sauce by using a few more shallots, a few more garlic cloves and olive oil and butter.  I also put in some lemon juice and a few drops of Red Hot.  Foil on the grill is a must!  Thank you, the grilled flavor is amazing!

This is the best way to get the true flavor of artichokes and I love the smokey BBQ flavor.  This is the only way I cook them.

Maybe I just don't like artichokes. I'm a first-timer and this was sooooooo bland. How can that much butter and garlic be so blah?

very good basic recipe. I omit the butter and do one quick brush with olive oil, since we prefer a sour cream dill sauce over melted butter for dipping.

These were fantastic, i couldn't find a shallot so i just used a lot of garlic and they still turned out really great. We used all of the butter on the artichokes so for dipping I used mayonaise mixed with pesto.

Yum!  These were really good!  It would be nice if the recipe provided more specifics about cleaning/preparing fresh artichokes for us firsttimers, but a quick google search answered my questions.  I served with a garlic and parmesan mayo.  Delicious.

Oh my GOSH!!  These were better than any artichoke that I have ever eaten.  I used a lot more shallot and garlic so it was very thick butter.  It was incredible!!! UPDATE: last time I added a pinch of smoked sea salt.  I forgot it this time and it was "missing" something.  If you get the chance to add a sea salt, it enriches it!

A very well know restaurant here in KC serves these, which is the only reason I eat there.  Now I can make my own on my own grill!

Fabulous recipe....I added 2 more garlic cloves.

Just one word Fantastic! Artichokes are my fav.. I grew up on them My normal way to eat them is steam them and then dip them in mayonaise wich I am also love. My hubby hates artichokes because he thinks they are an excuse to eat straight mayonaise. I cook with shallots alot and I always have some on hand and I was out of mayonaise so I browsed on this site and found this recipe. Anything with garlic rates high in my book. And this was just amazing wow I will never look at mayonaise the same way again.

Great recipe!

This was the first time I ever cut artichokes in half to clean out the choke prior to cooking.  I liked the end results much better than cooking them whole.

I steamed the artichokes for 20 minutes rather than boiling them.  As an added bonus, that meant that all of the garlic was still on them after the grilling step, rather than only half.

The final product was very tasty.  Variations using fresh lemon, or vinegar, or pesto, or sundried tomatoes will be fun to try.  I definitely intend to make these often and experiment along the way.

OMG!  I think that was the best artichoke I've ever eaten.  I broiled mine instead of grilling it, and it was just fine that way, imo.  I could have eaten two artichokes by myself.

So good! Great side dish for a BBQ. Something a bit different from the standard grilled veggies, yet something everyone will love. Made these for the first time for dinner with my grandmother and we all enjoyed them.

These came out great! I did make a couple changes. I used EVOO instead of butter (much healthier). I omitted the scallion and added parsley as well as lemon juice. I will defiantly make these again. Good thing boyfriend wasn't home for my garlic breath!

WOW!!! We loved this recipe!  I always enjoy artichokes... but this is the best.  I was noce because I could have it ready ahead of time and then just have my husband finish it on the grill.  The flavor was excelent, even though I did not have the shalots.   Thank you!

These were absolutely AMAZING!!!!  I didn't have shallots so I just used some fresh chives from my garden and, of course, lots and lots of garlic and the artichokes were excellent.  I already bought more artichokes to make the recipe again.  A+++++++

First time Artichoke-cooker.  This recipe rocked as a fun appetizer for a campfire cook.  We cooked & ate the artichokes while the steaks marinated.  Cooked in cast-iron over the fire added a wonderful golden brown color.  Check out my photo~

Wow, that shallot butter is delish!
I made this on a whim because I had 2 artichokes that needed to be used, and happened to have shallots too.  My husband wasn't home, and I ended up eating two whole artichokes for dinner by myself.  I don't really recommend that.  But they sure tasted great at the time!

I had a similar style artichoke at a local grill, and this recipe was just as good if not better.  I definitely will do this one at the next big family BBQ.

Thank you Ninakooks.  I have tried other artichoke recipies and ALL tasted like either straw or bark.  This recipe, not only being easy, is attractive and scrumptious. Made it for company and they were astounded by the flavor and the presenation.  The grilling does the trick.  If there were 10 stars, I would give them to this recipe.

though they were good, we didn't find them to be that much better than just steaming them as I usually do.  More work for no extra flavor.  However they did look pretty.

This was a great recipe and very simple.  I had to get more information on the internet on how to prepare the artichokes prior to boiling.  They are also expensive in my part of the country, but worth it on occasion.

Really tasty alternative to regular steamed artichokes.  I liked it a lot.  I had a problem with the artichokes kind of falling apart once they came out of the pot and therefore made it hard to grill.  Flavor was great.  Will try again and boil less time to get the true grilled version of this.  Loved the shallots and garlic in the dipping sauce.  Added a few dashes of tabasco to the dipping at the end.  YUM!

This was our firt time eating artichokes; always had been curious what they tasted like...  And let me tell you; they're absolutely wonderful.  It certianally won't be our last time having them; either!  This recipe is great; has a delicious flavour; is quite easy compared to a good number of the other recipes.   Very filling; too; after eating just one (though I'd doubled the recipe); I was full.  Will definately make this again!

I loved how the artichokes turned out, but I was a little disappointed in the shallot butter.  I will continue to prepare my artichokes this way, but will probably use a garlic mayo instead.

I am a huge artichoke fan and I thought this was a great change to my normal steaming. I gave it 4 stars b/c they were a little soggy from being boiled. Next time I will steam them before putting them on the gril. 

The garlic/onion butter was delicious, but I don't recomm. it if you are planning a nice romantic evening.  I am sure I'll be smelling of onions and garlic for a week!

I used this recipe to try artichokes in something other than a dip; I really did not care for it. Will not make again.

I just put the butter on the portions I will be eating.  This was DELICIOUS!  worth the extra effort with the butter.  we will be eating our chokes this way a lot in the future.

First let me say that I have never eaten an artichoke before, but wanted to try something different. This recipe has me wanting more.  I will absolutely make this many more times.

I liked it OK, but it was very messy and just not as good as stuffed artichokes.  I was a little disappointed.  The flavor of the heart was also just not as good as when the artichoke is steamed.
