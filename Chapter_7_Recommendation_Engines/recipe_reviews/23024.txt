This was so good and unbelievably easy! To the previous reviewer who asked, you do not mix the cake according to the directions on the box. Only use the three ingredients included in this recipe-dry cake mix, pineapple (do not drain!), and vanilla. It is scrumptious and was a great hit!

I was a little confused by this recipe.  Was I supposed to make the angel food according to package and then follow the directions of the recipe or was I just to mix the cake mix (dry) with the pineapple?  I made it according to package first, which left it very soggy.  Plus, I thought that it was a little tart.  I would be willing to try it again if I made it incorrectly the first time.

These were delicious and so quick and easy to make!  I made them into cupcakes for a great WW 3 point snack.

Review from 'confused Natalie' should probably be removed.  She gave it a 2 because she didn't understand that the directions were to be followed just as written, not reinterpreted any which way.  The instructions are clear, the ingredients easy to find, the cake ridiculously simple to make and out of this world delicious.  I love this one.

I made this in the traditional Angel Food Cake Pan and it worked great. Remember to ALWAYS invert the hot cake pan over the neck of an empty wine or large soda bottle until it's cool. That way the cake stays nice and high. 

It's also good with pure Orange Extract instead, but this recipe is a winner as it stands. Thanks for posting this one.

This recipe is so quick to throw together and tastes wonderful.  I baked it 25 minutes and it came out just right.  The warm pineapple aroma that lingers in the kitchen is very pleasant.

I've made this recipe regularly since discovering it at a WW meeting probably 15 years back.  It is fast, tasty, and relatively healthful eating.  The only difference in the directions I was given is that I was told to NEVER prepare the pan.  I was told that the angel-food cake would not rise properly if I greased and/or floured the pan.  The only time I did so (had a senior moment and forgot), the cake still tasted good but did not rise like it had when I had not prepared the pan. No one else has mentioned this, so I guess it is working great for most of you.  However, I noticed one person did say her cake did not rise, and I thought this might be the reason.  Thanks for sharing this here.

It definitely was easy & few ingredients.  It looked great out of the oven, however the cake middle collapsed!  It didn't look so pretty.  I dressed it up with coolwhip & slices of pineapple & star fruit.  It tasted pretty good.  I gave it four stars since it wasn't pretty & I was taking it to a potluck.

For those having trouble with the cake collapsing in a 9x13 pan, before you pour the batter into your baking pan, invert four pint glasses (or any four identically sized glasses) on your cooling surface and balance the corners of cake pan on the glasses, adjusting until the pan is stable and balanced.  Prepare the batter and bake according to the recipe.  When done baking (no jiggle, top is browned and cracks feel dry) immediately invert the pan on your glasses and let cool completely.  Problem solved!

I made this cake for my diabetic grandmother's birthday and it was well received.  I used an ungreased Hefty EZ foil pan (the disposable kind) and did not have any problems with the cake sticking.  I couldn't find the 18 oz angel food cake mixed but used a 16 oz Betty Crocker angel food mix and it worked great.  I iced the cake with sugar-free Cool-Whip and sprinkled it with a fruit confetti made from diced pineapple and diced strawberries.  Will make again!

This was so easy to make and delicious. My family loved it and it is hard for us to agree on anything. Only one thing I done different was place a layer of brown sugar in bottom of pan. I did use an angel food pan and cooled using a wine bottle with cake inverted. Wonderful!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Got this recipe from my cousin titled "Easiest Cake in the World".  She had diabetics in the family and 1/12 of this cake was ok for them.  The biggest difference was that the pan/dish did not need to be greased and she did not add vanilla.  Be advised that the mixture will foam and fill the dish before baking.  Love it!!!

An 18.25 ounce angel food package ?
16 ounce is the only size found.
A 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple was substituted since no water was included.
My angel food tin pan worked well, was easy to empty, and resulted in slices wider for toppings.
Oven preset to 350, 35 minutes total.

Very tasty and fluffy !

I needed a recipe for a lactose intolerant friend.  This was awesome!!  I cut up strawberries, added a little sugar and orange juice - and whipped topping for those that could have milk products.  Great reviews from everyone!  My husband said it was addictive.

When I first made this recipe I used a metal pan.  Mine also sunk in the middle.  A friend of mine said she always uses glass cake pans.  So I did and it puffed up beautifully.

The flavor was really good although the middle fell once I took it out of the oven so it didn't look very nice(I wondered if it was because I didn't invert the 9 x 13 pan like you are supposed to with a traditional angel food cake? Any one know if you are supposed to do this?).  Next time I think I am going to put the pineapple and juice through a food processor as the crushed pineapple I bought was still a bit chunky for my taste.

This was a very good cake. I like that it is lighter than most cakes and more diabetic friendly. I added areosol whip cream to the top(what I had on hand)..something I think added alot to the flavor, as it is not very sweet. I would make this recipe again.

Okay....first run-thru tonight.  I always make exactly as directions say the first time.  My cake tasted good, but got a bit over-done.  My oven runs a little hot, so next time I will try 25 mins and start checking then.  I will rate again when I have made adjustments.

This has long been my stand-by for a quick DELICIOUS dessert! One word of caution, though, you absolutely canNOT use a 2-envelope angel food cake mix with success, it must be a one envelope mix. Also, I've always used a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple not 8 oz.  It can be baked in a 9x13 or bunt pan.  When taken out of oven if you can allow to cool upside down, it is best, just as you would a normal angel food. Top with whipped cream, or frost the whole cake with it. I only frost the cake with whipped cream if I don't expect any leftovers, and top with moist flaky coconut.  Thanks for posting this, and reminding busy people what a really special cake this is, and so quick and easy!

I cannot believe how simple this was to make! After seeing some of the comments on this recipe, I was weary making it but it looked so easy I went ahead anyway. I;m glad I did! It is so tasty and sweet. I also added pineapple rings on top just before baking.

So simple and so delicious! I may add some chopped pecans next time I make it, but it is perfect as written. A friend said you can substitute a can of blueberry pie filling for the pineapple. I plan to try that for my husband who loves blueberries.

Cake is very easy to make. It does taste good but it’s a little too sweet for me. I don’t think I’ll make it again.

Deliciously moist and a dollop of cool whip with cherry and juice on top is the icing on the cake.

I didn't use my mixer to blend items in bowl(was I supposed to?) so it got flat.  It also slid out of the greased glass dish I used when I tried to invert it to cool.  Hope it tastes better than it looks!

I thought this was delicious!  I made as directed except for the addition of 1 cup of flaked coconut, as some reviewers have suggested, and topped with homemade whipped cream and diced strawberries.  It was like a fancified strawberry shortcake!  One little oopsie though, one reviewer suggested that any angle food cake needs to be cooled upside down.  I suggest that you do not try this with a cake baked in a 9x13 pan or it will end up on the counter like mine did!  haha!  no matter!  It was still wonderful and we all had a good laugh!

I made this recipe for a family get together. I made it without the vanilla. Everyone loved it and it was gone quickly. We served it with Orange/Pineapple ice cream. I will definitely make this again and may even try a different canned fruit.

This cake was so easy and loved by everyone.  It isn't a pretty cake but some white pineapple sherbert on top and no one noticed.  There are so many toppings you could use with this one.  Great potluck cake.

Made this for Easter and it didn't even raise very much.  I used a bundt pan but don't think that was why...I did exactly what the recipe said.  Sorry, I won't make again w/o revising it.
