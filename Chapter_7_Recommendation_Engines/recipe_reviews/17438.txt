Great taste! Recipe mentioned salt but didn't say how much.  I used 1 tsp.  Also mentioned milk or yogurt, but failed to mention how much milk, so I used yogurt.  Next time, I won't drizzle any honey over the top layer - it just sat on top of the cake, unabsorbed, and gave the caramel frosting a mottled appearance. I will definitely make this cake again - delicious!!!

I came across this thinking it would be a cute cake idea to bring to a church dinner.  Unfortunately, the only thing they liked about it was the name.  The cake was too heavy and the frosting was too stiff and hard to work with.  Sorry.

This was an awesome cake! I loved every minute of it! I made it for an office party along with a fantastic chocolate cake. The choclate cake was barely touched. It was good!!!

I made this cake in a pinch, and I guess it performed okay since it was for my 3 year old daughter's birthday, but I wouldn't serve it to anyone I wanted to please.  It didn't bake well, very heavy and course, with a thick outer surface too tough to cut nicely. Maybe if I had used the caramel frosting, honey, and pecans it would've worked, but I don't think I'll bother.

This cake tasted very heavy, without much flavor.  It also didn't raise very well at all.  The instructions mention adding salt, but the ingredients don't list salt.  I won't be making it again.

I have served this cake to friends and family several times now and each time I receive raving reviews and everyone wants the recipe.  This is by far one of the best cakes that I have ever made!  Thank you very much for posting it!

I used the mini angel cake pan my sister sent me from USA, so made 6 individual cakes (stops any fighting!)  I couldn't find caramel frosting over here so I used "MaryKaye"s recipe and both complimented each other.  I have been ORDERED to make some more.  This time I'll try to remember the honey.

I stumbled upon this recipe years ago for my mom's birthday....it has since become her FAVORITE cake. I've made a couple changes since it is so sweet, added dried cranberries on top to give a bit of tart and I use buttercream frosting instead of carmel. Turns out fantastic! :)
