Very good and so easy. I added a little arrowroot powder at the end to thicken it up some and served it over zucchini noodles.

This was the absolute *wettest* preparation. Not in any way could this be considered "creamy". I think the broth should only be 1/4 cup at the most.

This is a really delicious recipe! I subbed roast for sirloin, and doubled the shrooms and salt. I also had to do some thickening to the gravy. Thank you SO much for the awesome recipe!!! Definitely a repeat!!

DH really loved the gravy, and I thought the flavors were excellent.  I'm knocking down one star due to the method, because my beef did not get tender and the gravy did not thicken up in an hour of cooking time.  I suspect the temperature was a bit high for tender beef.  I thickened the gravy with some arrowroot powder and added a bit of homemade seasoned salt.  I served over mashed potatoes, and DH was a happy man.  Thanks for the idea!

It was a good recipe. I added a cornstarch roux and some extra broth to create enough sauce to serve it over wide noodles. Worked out great!

I made this but not in the oven. I did it via slow cook in a cast iron pot. i added red wine plus I added corn starch to thicken the sauce. I served it over rice and it was fantastic!!
