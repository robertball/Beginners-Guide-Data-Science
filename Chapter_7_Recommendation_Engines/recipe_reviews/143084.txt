The addition of cinnamon and the crumb topping makes this banana bread recipe unique from most. I substituted butter for the shortening since I felt it would give it more flavor. The bread turned out  moist with lots of wonderful flavors, the crumb topping adds a nice texture and as well as an additional sweetness.   If doubling the recipe, as I did, there is no need to increase the amount of the crumb mixture, there is plenty for two regular size loaves. I had searched a long time for a banana bread recipe with a topping such as this, and I will be making this recipe many times again. The reduction in temperatures helps to prevent burning of the crumb topping, so I wouldn't skip this step. It helps to create a more moist bread as well. This is a welcome addition to my recipe collection. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great tasting bread!  I doubled the recipe, including the crumb topping (which was a mistake, regular recipe is plenty, for two loafs).  When doubling the bread recipe I used 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of almond, I also used 4 bananas.  The smell was wonderful and it tasted great, just too much of the topping for my taste (when doubled). Also cooking time was over an hour with two loafs, approx 45 minutes at 350 and 35 minutes at 325. I think I will try apples with this recipe, crumb topping is similar to a pie topping that I have for an apple pie.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

well, I made this recipe twice today (first time making it) and the first time it bombed... i hadn't read the reviews yet about it bubbling over and not cooking. I was so frustrated that I made it again and this time split the batter into two loaf pans instead of one, there was plenty of crumb topping for the two loaves. I baked it for about 15 min longer checking it every 5 min just in case and it turned out GREAT! and I have 2 banana bread loaves instead of one. I will use this recipe again, the crumb topping was wonderful!

Absolutely amazing! I used a muffin pan instead of a bread pan, but I had just about the right amount of batter to make a dozen muffins. They were very moist and very "banana-ee". I made them one evening, and they were gone by early afternoon next day.

I have to give it a one star, my "bread" is still a batter and its been in the oven for 1 hour, when the recipe calls for less time. I have no clue why its still a batter. Maybe because there was a lot of crumb topping?

I have some personal failings when it comes to "cutting in" butter or shortening, but I must admit this is quite tasty, though, it seems sunken and a tad bit soft in the middle, despite the fact that I cooked it to the maximum point then left it in the oven (turned off). Overall, cakelike and delicious, but I probably won't make it again, partly because of my own difficulties, and partly because Barbara Kingsolver helped me realize what a large carbon cost bananas have, unless you actually live in Belize or Ecuador.

This recipe makes wonderful muffins!!  I wasn't too thrilled with the way the loaf turned out, though.

I doubled the cooking time and still came out with squidgey bread.  Completely soft 3/4 the way through and completely not usable.  Something is very wrong with this recipe.  I bake a lot so I am not chalking this up to inexperience.

My bread took much longer to bake than the recipe directed.  The flavor was very good--what I tasted--I made it for my husband to take to work. It barely got done in time for him to take it.

Another bake sale favorite better than any other banana bread.  I used baby food bananas instead.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I'll be making it again today.  It was the best bananna bread I have ever made.    I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.   It could probably stand to be a little bit sweeter so I will add a tad more sugar.

Terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly detail for detail. it spilled over the side because it was too watery and it won't harden.  I've been baking it for over an hour now.  I don't know why it's not working, but it's not.  I'm not happy with this recipe at all!

I am always trying to find ways to get my children to eat more fruit.  Well This recipie was a big hit in out house.  My husband told me over and over how good it was.  I will be sure to make this again.  The crumb topping is wonderful on this bread.  I did add more bananas than this recipie called for and I used butter instead of shortning..

Add me to the "still batter" list.  My bread is not yet finished, so I can't comment on flavor.  So, why is it not done?  I used glass bread pans, and I used butter rather than shortening.  I know my oven bakes at 25 degrees less than the setting, so I adjust for that.  

Later in the day....
Okay.  It took nearly two hours to bake.  The flavor is nice, but the texture isn't quite bready enough

I may try it another time.  

I forgot to add that I am nearly at sea level.  Perhaps that affects the recipe?

Although I had to alter a few things about this recipe (which is a part of the baking experience) it was delicious and anyone who tried it, loved it!

The final result of this recipe tasted very good. It was, however, a long process getting there. Other reviewers mentioned their bread not baking. Very true. The baking time is way off with this recipe. Mine took an extra 30 MINUTES. I made the crumb topping as the recipe stated, but could only fit half of it on the bread. I saved the other half. I did sprinkle some regular oats on top for appearance. I noticed this batter was extremely runny. I think the liquid - 1 cup of milk - was way too much. If anything, I may try decreasing the milk by half and adding an extra banana. The cinnamon would definitely be better added with the dry ingredients. The recipe calls only for ALMOND extract, but the directions tell you to add the VANILLA extract.  I don't believe the oven should be turned down to 325 while baking. My crumb topping barely browned at all even with the excess baking time. 350 might give this bread a chance to finish baking in the suggested time. BTW, the total baking time is also listed incorrectly. It states 45 minutes, but 20 + 15= 35, not 45. Most quick breads take about an hour to bake (I've made quite a few). I may try this again with several modifications.

4 stars because I substituted butter for shortening, and because the cook time is off. This bread takes Forever to bake, but (to me) so worth it! Love-Love-Love it! I've made this for years, both as bread and as cupcakes- which shave off a bit of bake time.
