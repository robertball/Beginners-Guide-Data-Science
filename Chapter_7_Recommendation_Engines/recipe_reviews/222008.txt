Love this one!  I've made it with different kinds of sausage (pork, turkey, and chicken), but the best I've found has been from Publix greenwise italian chicken sausage - the jenny-o spicy italian turkey sausage is a close second.  With either of these I don't have to worry about measuring the drippings, I just leave it all in the pan as it's leaner than pork and not nearly as oily.  Also, as I like spicy more than my wife does, I'll use Sriracha on my plate, and she'll use a sweet pepper relish.  It's just so darn good!

Scrumptious !    Sausage, cheese, spicy,  what's not to like.  I've  been looking for a recipe like this and it was everything I wished for.  When you make this be sure to take the cook's advice and strain the juice,  you'll be glad you did.

Since I made some changes to this I'm giving it 5 stars on principle-- I added some eggplant to the mix and used mozzarella as well as a tiny bit of grated aged provolone since I didn't have enough cheddar on hand. I'll make sure to have cheddar on hand the next time I make this. I didn't cook the squash on the stovetop nearly as long as the instructions called for fear of overcooking, and the texture turned out perfect according to my tastes. I also added a little beef stock to it before going into the oven because I thought it would have been a little dry otherwise. It was very tasty and I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous! My neighbor had given me some zucchini and yellow squash from the farmers' market, and I am so glad I found this recipe. I used kielbasa, because that's what I had.  I chopped purple, red, yellow and green peppers and a whole onion and used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Italian seasoning, pepper and a bit of salt were perfect. I did the whole thing on the stove, rather than heating up the whole house by turning on the oven. I mixed the cheese in at the last, and served it to a very grateful hubby. He gave it the 5 stars, before I had even taken a bite.

Easy enough for the man of the house to make. He did it all on the stove-top instead. Subbed the veggies for a bag of frozen Italian veggie mix and left out the green pepper (didn't have any). Opted for a can of spicy diced tomatoes. Also some red wine was used for de-glazing after the sausage was cooked and the pan de-greased. My boys ate this atop some cooked spaghetti.

This was awesome.  Used 2 fresh chicken basil sausages...less fat, and yellow peppers.  A big hit with the family.

Great recipe, this is not the first recipe I have encountered that instructs reserving some liquid and then not mentioning where it is to be used.

I had an abundance of zucchini and yellow squash so came here and searched for a recipe with them in it.  I came across this recipe and thought it sounded great because sausage was added and we could have it as a main dish.  I used Bob Evans spicy sausage roll, a 14.5 ounce can of fire roasted tomatoes because we love them, and a combination of shredded mild cheddar and cheddar jack cheese since we had a little of each.   Rock_lobster, you have changed our lives!!!  This was such a giant hit with my hubby and 2 grown sons, I posted it on facebook with the recipe and it is our all time favorite vegetable recipe :)  Thank you SO MUCH for the recipe, I made a double batch first time now I have to make MORE cause I am finishing it off for breakfast lol.  Nice job!!

LOVE this dish! We don't change a thing about it and it's a regular in our home. I recommend it as a gateway dish to introduce squash to your family or friends. It certainly got us to try more squash dishes!

I was looking for a way to use squash and zucchini I had in the fridge and came across this recipe. I was surprised at how delicious it was. Hubby loved it. I had to use a mild form of the sausage due to young kids, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This one is going on the 'keeper' list. Thanks so much for submitting!

I used this recipe as a guide. I made several modification, but without this basic recipe, I couldn't have done that, so for that reason alone, you get 5 stars. I'm doing the paleo lifestyle so these were my modifications: omitted the cheese, used baby eggplant along with the squash and zucchini (used my mandolin to cut them lengthwise). Layered it all in my baking dish like I was making a lasagna, using my veggies instead of pasta, and baked. It was great. Thanks for the recipe.

Even my husband who hates squash will eat it. I usually use 1 lb of spicy Italian and 1 lb of sweet and is perfect! I usually double the recipe so we have plenty of left overs.

I made a few changes to the recipe because of my husband's dietary restrictions. We used basmati rice, Italian seasoning instead of salt and whole wheat Panko breading instead of bread crumbs. Our sauce was also low sodium, home-made with tomato sauce, tomato paste, diced tomatoes and some Italian seasoning. The husband and kids really liked it and requested that it be put on the regular rotation.

5 stars for ease and taste. Able to adjust vegetables as you see fit.  I added cubed eggplant and mushrooms, then needed a 10 x 14 pan. A lot of chopping prep work but at least it will last us two meals. Also broiled the vegetables instead of stovetop. Served with baked potatoes, a perfect side.

Very good. I make something pretty similar without the tomatoes and with different veggies. This was a nice change. Comfort food with a great flavor. I did add some white wine and chicken stock to the simmering process otherwise all the same. Will make again.

Very good and different. I added eggplant and cooked zucchini, squash and eggplant in chicken broth...I used breakfast sausage and stirred a handful each of sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, and Mexican cheese in addition to placing it on top. Very flavorful!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes on this site.  I have made it multiple times.  Getting ready to make it again right now actually. My kids love it too! Who knew there was a way to get kids to eat squash?

Delicious with spice Italian sausage and added eggplant.   I found the prep time to be too long to make often, but the casserole was generous in size.  My family loved it!

It was my first time making ratatouille - didn't know what it was until a client gave me a bag of fresh fall vegetables and recommended it.  I made it with Italian Turkey Sausage and added egg plant.  Couldn't stop picking at the pan after dinner.  I simplified the recipe.  Instead cooking this and setting it aside and cooking that and setting it aside - I cooked it all in one pot.  Knowing how much time it takes to cook each veg. helped.

This was SO tasty. Every bite has its own unique flavor. My husband and I just moved to Braselton and thought it would be fun to try a local Braselton dish. All of the ingredients were also on sale at Kroger this week. We will definitely be making this again!

Yum.  I have tomato, zucchini, and squash growing this year , and was looking for a way to use them up.  I did make a few changes.  I used one large zucchini, 2 squash, 3 big tomatoes ,and a few cherry tomatoes.  No canned.  I did have half a jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce I threw in. And of course 1 lb of mild Italian sausage.   At the end of the stovetop cooking, I added about 1 cup of shredded parmesan, and then once it was in the casserole dish, I topped it with shredded mozarella instead of cheddar.  It was all about using up what I already had and this recipe worked great!

I've made this 3 years in a row as a side item for the family Easter dinner. Everyone is so exited that I keep bringing it back. I use venison breakfast sausage in place of the spicy sausage and it comes out great!  Highly recommended. Always a big hit.

I made this for dinner last night. I used what I had on hand, which differed a little from listed ingredients...turkey sausage, red bell pepper and 3 small zucchini. Since turkey sausage doesn't have alot of  fat, I had to use a little more olive oil. I followed the recipe, except baking. I did not have excessive liquid, therefore I did not see the need. My husband and I are squash lovers, so we really enjoyed this recipe!

One word - Delicious !   It's my go to for company or just a great tasting hearty meal.  My only addition is some toasted pine nuts that I add to the mix, otherwise I keep it just like the recipe.

Great recipe to make on Sunday and eat throughout the week. I didn't have Italian seasoning on hand so I used 1tbsp of basil, parsley, and oregano. I also used ground turkey instead of pork, added 1tsp cayenne to add some heat, and used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  A very easy and delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe and we ate it over rice. Would be good over noodles as well. Super yummy and easy to make. I cooked sweet turkey sausage in the oven on hi broil and then cut it up. Everything else I did the same as recipe. Good stuff!

We were looking for a filling veggie dish that was on the healthier side.  I found this and was happy to see that it did not include eggplant as a traditional ratatouille does.  We aren't eggplant fans but  I expect that if you do like eggplant, you could easily add some to this and it would be fine.  I adjusted ingredients a little based on what I  had on hand.  I used kielbasa rather than ground sausage.  I sliced each piece in half lengthwise, then sliced the halves into thin "half moons".   Because kielbasa cooks off alot less fat than ground sausage, I added a little more olive oil than is called for.  I omitted the green pepper because we don't care for cooked green peppers. (Ironic that the only two vegetables that we don't care for would both be in this dish!) I used a whole onion because we love onions and to make up for the missing green pepper.   I used 3 zuchinni rather than 2 along with the 3 yellow squash.  I used my large cast iron skillet and it was FULL.   I used bottled minced garlic (and probably more than 2 cloves worth!)  Once I added the one 14.5 ounce can of tomatoes, I could tell that it needed more, so I used a second can.  I simmered the veggies partially covered for 20 minutes or so, then decided that rather than heating up the oven, I'd do like another reviewer suggested and just cook it on top of the stove.  After simmering and stirring  for a good little while and adjusting the seasonings, it was missing something, so I went to my fave "red sauce

I don't put it in the oven, no need. Just a yummy fresh one skillet meal. We also don't add cheese for a healthier meal.

Loved it! For me personally I don't feel like the cheese was necessary in this recipe. Overall the meal was a huge hit in my house.

I used nenni's Italian pork sausage recipe, tomato products left from canning and didn't use the oven. I cooked as directed except stirred in the cheese and served instead of topping and placing in the oven. I like to keep some bite to my summer squash and thought the bake time would push it too far for our preference.  This was great on toasted hoagie slices.

Delicious!  I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I just diced three or four roma tomatoes and simmered them for a little bit before tossing them in.  

I don't much care for steamed squash, so I was thrilled that this turned out to be so tasty and easy to make.  Since I used my food processor to slice the squash, and zucchini very thin (2 mm slices), I also shortened the stove top cooking times a little bit.  It still turned out perfectly.

A very flexible recipe.

This is my second time making this dish and my family loves it. Even my picky teenagers did not mind the amout of veggis in this dish. As noted by Rock_lobster, you may want to remove some of the liquid before baking. I cooked as listed the first time but used mozzarella instead of cheddar. It was a little on the water side. The second time I strained the can tomatoes really well before adding them to the skillet and that made a huge difference. The only other sub I made was using minced garlic instead of fresh. I think this a great way to use squash!
