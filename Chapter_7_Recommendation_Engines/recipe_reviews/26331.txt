This pie is simple and delicious for anyone who adores fruit pies. The second time I made it, I used extra lemon zest and blueberries and found that it just improved the flavor! One note -- I suggest beating the egg whites to soft or medium rather than stiff peaks -- they'll integrate better into the rest of the mixture and you won't find weird clumps of egg white in the batter but will still get a light consistency.

Happy cooking -- The Staff

This was a good pie that is great after dinner in the summer. However, be warned that the batter may spill over during cooking - as it did with me - so be sure to place on a baking sheet while baking, just in case.

This is a sponge pie, not a custard pie.  That technicality out of the way, the lemon filling is absolutely delicious.  However, I'm not sure the blueberries really added anything, and they weren't especially attractive on top of the pie.  It's good, but I think there are better blueberry desserts out there.

This pie is fantastic. Light and sweet and just the right amount of lemon. Everyone I fed this to absolutely loved it. Be careful about browning the top, and mine didn't need to cook for the whole 50 minutes.

This is light and refreshing and the zest of the lemon enhances the lemony blueberry flavour, a great combination.  I used organic milk and eggs and the eggs whites whipped up beautifully. Mine needed an additonal 5-7 minutes after removing the foil to set up. I like blueberries so I used 2 cups. Enjoy!

Although this pie didn't have a rich, creamy texture I would expect from a custard, it was still an easy pie to make and a light touch to end any meal.  My guests for Super Bowl seemed to enjoy it. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the blueberries to 2 cups.  I baked the pie for the 50 minutes recommended, covering the pie after 30 minutes.

I followed it exactly but used a flan pan with pop out bottom.  It turned out really well, very tasty.  Made it for a friend & she wants the recipe! I would take the advice of another review & add more lemon zest.  The lemon taste is fresh and lovely but it leaves you wanting more!

This pie was terrific! I used a bit more lemon for a more tart edge to it, but otherwise followed the recipe as written, if you want something light and yummy, this is the one for you.

Easy and delicious.  I used a graham cracker crust and it was very good with the filling.  I was surprised at how many blueberries there were in proportion to the custard.  I will try it with other fruits, too.

This turned out wonderfully for me. Followed the instructions but free-handed the blueberries - probably about 2-2 1/2 cups.   Everyone loved it and even had a few ask for the recipe!

The flavor was quite nice, but in my opinion the texture was too foamy.  In my case it didn't resemble custard at all.  I would prefer something a bit more rich.

I absolutely love this pie! The lemon custard is light and delicious, and the blueberries complement the filling very nicely. I used a 9" deep dish pyrex pie plate, and I doubled the recipe, filling the crust right to the top. I made a cover from foil, using the pie plate as a guide, and I tented the pie after about 20-25 minutes to reduce the browning on the top. I baked it for a full hour and 15 minutes at 350. It seemed a long time to bake the pie, but this is the 2nd time I've baked it this way, and needs every minute of that for the custard to set properly.

The flavor was awesome! There were no leftovers. I used canned blueberries (drained and rinsed) since fresh were not available and it worked just fine.

First, you can't "cream" 1 tbsp butter w/ 2/3 c sugar!
I baked it twice and long as recommended and the top was
getting so brown I took it out of the oven.  Still not
DONE!  I threw it away.  What a waste of time and money!

I followed suggestions and increased lemon zest.  I also used half and half only because I had it on hand.  The biggest change was to bake in custard cups with NO CRUST.  Lemme tell you this is a scrumptious dessert.  Light and zesty with those blueberries bursting with flavor.  If you are gluten free (but not celiac) you may be able to handle this dessert as a custardy cup.  The whole recipe only includes 2 Tsp flour and make six 1/2 cup portions, so your exposure is really limited.
These flew out of the fridge the same day I made them.

The texture is a little strange. The top part of the filling is spongy from little air bubbles, while the lower part is creamy. The flavor is pretty nice, although I think a tiny bit of salt would improve it.

This is a delicious pie, beautiful and simple to make. I followed the recipe as written, only baking a little longer -- I made it in Frisco, Colorado at 9,000 ft. above sea level. I wholeheartedly recommend.

I should have made this as reviewed, but doubled the lemon juice and zest.  It was good, but probably a little too tart.  My husband said it reminded him of lemon curd.  The blueberries did nothing for the pie at all.

The taste is there but i live in Colorado and im not sure if altiude was to blame or the 1% milk but i followed the directions,  cooked for 50min and let it sit. Cut into it a few hrs later and the center was not cooked, ran all over. Never tried a pie like this so no idea what went wrong....

Good- but not great.  Will make again when blueberries are in season and inexpensive for an easy dessert.

Made this pie exactly as stated DELICIOUS!!!!!  I did take another reviewers suggestion and put it on a baking sheet in case it over flowed but it was fine. Already had to give this recipe to my 3 guest.

I loved the flavor and lemon and blueberry anything, but it did not set up. No doubt this was my fault. We spooned it out and ate it in bowls. I had a serving and my partner ate all the rest after dinner!

Working backwards in my recipe box, this was the next recipe up for the making.  It had been in my box since January 2011.  This pie had a very unique texture to it.  It really wasn't custardy, but I'm not really sure how to describe it.  The lemon and blueberry flavors did come through and that was nice.  But, the texture kept us from really enjoying this pie.

I placed my foil on top at 30 minutes but when it was finished cooking I didn't think that it was brown enough on top so I put it under the broiler so it was more evenly browned. I tore the foil and placed where is was already brown so it looked more even. Highly recommended!

You do have to bake at least 50 mins. After 30 mins I covered with aluminum foil. My husband absolutely loved it and went back for seconds.
