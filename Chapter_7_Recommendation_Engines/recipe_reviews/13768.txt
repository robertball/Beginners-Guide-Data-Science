If you've never roasted pumpkin seeds before here are my tips.  When you carve your pumpkins scoop the seeds into a colander and the guts onto newspaper.  Inevitably some of the guts will be mixed in with the seeds but when you run water over them it's separated out pretty easily.  After you drain the rinsed seeds, pour them onto a large, dry cookie sheet and let them sit for 24 hours or so to dry out. Now you can pick out the remaining pieces of pumpkin stuff that didn't get pulled out earlier and they will roast better if they are not wet when they go in the oven.  My family prefers them seasoned with garlic salt in place of regular salt but you can use whatever suits your taste.  So good!

These were delicious!!  
I did make the following adjustments per other reviews: 1) I boiled the seeds in salted water for 20 minutes (it really does clean the seeds well,) 2) I then laid them out on a cookie sheet overnight to dry, 3) The next morning I mixed them with 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon melted butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil and 4) I spread the coated seeds on a cookie sheet and baked them for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.  They were perfect!!!!

We are enjoying these hot out of the oven, and I want to post a quick review because it is always so helpful to read the comments of others - thanks everyone! We had two cups of seeds so I upped the butter a bit and upped the salt even more - used garlic salt instead of Mortons.  I learned from others that it is VERY important to keep your single layer single in order to get the nice toasty seeds - and even then, ours took a longer than 45 minutes on two cookie sheets.  We just watched until they were toasty brown - and they are SO DELICIOUS!  Thanks and happy Halloween!

I followed the steps to the recipe as written. As for the  ingredients I had a lot more seeds so I used more butter (2tbs) and more salt (2tbs). I never boiled them as other users suggested. I only put them in a sink of water and cleaned them by swishing them around in the water and rubbing between my hands. This is NOT a complicated recipe so I suggest the 1st time you make these follow the recipe as written and the next time tweak as you like. Also for the ones that say you don't have salt on the inside....this is like salted sunflower seeds the salt is on the outside of the shell so you get the salt in your mouth as you crack open the seeds. PLEASE don't make this more difficult for people trying to make this for the 1st time as there are too many saying you HAVE to do this or that. If you are making this for the 1st time follow the recipe & remember these reviews are personal preferences and like I said you can "tweak" after you get the feel for this! :)

This is by far the best roasted pumpkin seed recipe.  I have tried different recipes over the
years, which have way more ingrediants than this one.  I used Lowry's seasoning salt
with mine--my kids loved them--they want to buy another pumpkin just for the seeds!

I love pumpkin seeds!  I found that leaving them unrinsed gives them a nice flavor.  Also, I spray them with butter flavored Pam instead of using butter to lighten them up.  Stir every 10 minutes or so too.

Very good!  I used suggestions from other reviews.  I used a combination of butter and garlic flavored Pam instead of butter, and seasoned salt.  Sprinkled a little bit of sugar on while they were hot...makes a great taste.  They were gone in an hour.  I'm going to experiment with cinnamon, nutmeg and regular salt.

I made this for my daughter's Halloween party and they were delicious!  The parents couldn't stop eating them.  I followed the directions of the person who suggested adding a sprinkle of sugar after baking.  It was just right with the salt I had added previously!  Excellent.

My family loves roasted pumpkin seeds.  We spiced up the seeds a bit this year by going with a seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  How delicious!

Great recipe... I grew up eating these things by the bag. You might vary the salt and butter to taste... I like my salty. As a matter of fact, I boil them for about 15 minutes in salt water, and then them dry overnight before baking. The biggest hassle is removing the pumpkin mush from the seeds. Here's a trick that might help. Separate the seeds from the bulk of the orange gunk. You now have the seeds and a whole bunch of orange strands. Get a deep pot or container, place the seeds in the water, give it a bit of a swirl, and let settle. The seeds will float to the top, and the bad stuff will settle to the bottom. Use a slotted spoon (or whatever) to remove the now clean seeds. Hope this helps... Keep the faith and keep cooking.

Everyone reviewing this is making it way more difficult than it needs to be.  It is not necessary AT ALL to dry out the seeds or boil them in water!!!  Please don't!  The only adjustments I made was that I used SEA SALT, and I accidentally cooked it at 350.  
These were the BEST pumpkind seed I ever had!!!

It's much better to boil the seeds first.  If you boil them in salt water, it infuses the salt in the seeds, instead of leaving the salt on the surface.  It also eliminates the work of cleaning the seeds, because the boiling does the work for you. Finally, the result is tastier.  Joy of Cooking recommends hulling pumpkin seeds, because the hulls are tough.  Boiling eliminates that problem, resulting in a tasty, crispy (but not tough) product.

This recipe is similar to the one that I use - except mine calls for 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to every 2 cups of seeds. Then, during the last 10 minutes of cooking time, I sprinkle generously with cinnamon sugar. This just seemed a bit bland compared to what I usually make - didn't care for it as much. Mine are sweet and salty. Also, I think it takes much longer than 45 minutes to cook and dry out the seeds completely - at least it did for me. I also tried boiling one batch of the seeds in salt water prior to baking like other reviewers have suggested - but did not like the texture/taste/color of doing that. The seeds turned gray and I just thought they tasted... strange. The seeds actually retain a lot of flavor if not cleaned too much. Guess I'll stick with my own tried and true recipe!

I've perfected this recipe after trying all the different suggestions in the reviews.  First, I buy 3lb bags of raw in shell pumpkin seeds on Amazon.com.  The seeds are fat and huge!  I boil 4 cups of seeds at a time for 20 mins (or until gray in color) in heavy salted water.  I lay them out on baking sheets over night.  The next day (still moist) I melt 3 tbs of butter, 3 tbs of olive oil, 1.5 tbs of garlic salt and a little bit of Laurys Seasoning salt in a large bowl and dump seeds into bowl and mix well.  I let them soak in it while the oven is preheating to 325 degrees.  Then lay them out on 2 large baking sheets and bake for 30 mins or so, stiring them half way through.  Once they're golden brown to my liking I take them out and the man of the house is right behind me at that point begging for a handful of them.  We like them just crispy enough that the shell itself chews up tasty as well.  

I've learned that boiling them in the heavy salted water first lets the flavor get into the seed and also helps the seasonings on the outside stick and soak in better when the shells are still moist the morning after boiling them.  The neighbors love them, we love them, that's why we order seeds in bulk now.

Great recipe! Pumpkin seeds are awesome - I can't believe I ever wasted them! So this recipe is great as is. If this is your first time, do it this way - super good. If you are iffy, split them in half and do half one way and the other another way! No worries!  Two sheets in the same oven, hell! 300 degrees and and 45 minutes are about perfect for any batch. It is the before stuff that people are discussing, and that is "just to taste" things. Some people boil beforehand - I did it once and didn't taste the difference. I say, screw it, right from the pumpkin:  a little pumpkin gut is not a crisis - some butter, some salt, maybe some garlic salt, maybe some chili powder, whatever - mix it up in a bowl, throw them on a pan, rake 'em around until you are happy. (I actually just put the seeds straight from the pumpkin with a little bit o' guts still on them in a bowl, put a clump of butter in the middle, and nuke for a minute or two to melt the butter). Then I mix up whatever I want (typically garlic salt and Johnny's seasoning) until I feel like it looks right. Throw it on the pan, give it a whirl occasionally between discussing pumpkin carvings, and when they look all crispy and golden, call it good! :D

Boil your seeds in very salty water for 10 minutes, then spread on sheet and bake for 25 min. at 425. Yours will be better than the posted recipe.

This is a great, basic recipe.  There are obviously a multitude of variations that can be created.    I am specifically commenting on baking technique, as the basic recipe is fine as is.  Your geographic location, altitude, humidity, oven size /temp, the actual moisture content of the seeds, and your 'added' ingredients all play factors in how long you will spend actually roasting your seeds.  What may take me more than two hours to perfectly roast my seeds, may only take 20-40 minutes for you.

To make these a little lighter I did them without the butter.  Actually, I've always done them without butter (never knew anyone used it).  Just cleaned the seeds, salted them, and popped them in the oven until they were golden brown.  They're so good that I'm going to go buy more pumpkins just for the seeds.  If you make enough, you can store them in an airtight container and enjoy them longer, if they last that long!

Recipe a good start- but before roasting, need to boil in salted water as suggested by other reviewers. So much better than roasting alone.

I've roasted pumpkin seeds many times, but could never consistently get the temperature to baking time ratio correct.  This is a great basic recipe and starting point for more creative endeavors, and a classic treat, as is.  My daughter and I like a little more salt and a lot more butter, but that's just us.  

I'm glad I followed the recipe exactly before reading the reviews.  Boiling them in salt water and drying overnight is not necessary!!!  It might have added something, but during this busy season, it would have created more dirty dishes, not to mention wasted time and paper towels.  That being said, I do think the butter and salt mixture would adhere better to dry seeds.  You can easily accomplish this by baking the seeds for 10 minutes before adding them to the butter /salt mixture.

Thanks for a good classic recipe and instructions!!

Me, my kids, my friends and family all loved these! We did not crack them open and eat them, we ate them whole. The recipe needs to tell you how to prepare your pumpkin seeds, and here's what worked for me that was super delicious: Separated the seeds from the guts, layed them on paper towel to dry overnight. Melted 2 Tbls. of butter, and mixed the two in a bowl. Then, I put them on a cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray, and sprinkled them with season salt, to taste. Baked them at 300 for about 40 minutes shaking the pan a couple of times. stored them in a paper bag, so they stayed crunchy. The seeds were so warm, toasty, and awesomely crunchy and delicious! My 4yr old and 6 yr old loved them!

I modified it as well...the soaking in salt water for 2 hrs or boiling it tastes better...salt on the inside.

I made this as called for, except for the salt.  Instead of salt I seasoned with Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning!  It has salt in it as well as other seasonings and adds just the right kick!  If you are making it for kids don't use too much, as it will have a bit of a bite...but otherwise it adds just the right amount of deliciousness!

I boiled the seeds in salty water for about 15 min to get the 'goop' off and get them a little more seasoned. Dried them over night on paper spread on the countertop.  I then put them a glass pie dish with the butter and salt baked for 1 hour at 275*.  Came out perfect!  No fru fru seasoning- just pumpkin seeds!

I've done the boiling thing first, and truthfully, I notice very little difference in the final outcome, taste-wise. This recipe is so easy and quick and the roasted seeds come out very crunchy and delicious. So save yourself a step or two that other reviewers mentioned about boiling, letting sit out 24 hours, etc. If you want your roasted seeds quick and delicious, just follow the recipe here as written and you'll by happily munching in no time. But do experiment with flavors. I personally love some garlic powder mixed in with the butter and salt before I coat the seeds prior to roasting. Delicious!!

The kids really enjoyed these!  I made three different kinds of seeds last night, & these were #1 for our 12 year old daughter, & #2 for our 11 year old son.  My husband & I preferred the spiced seeds (found on this site)  YUM!  Thanks Rosemary!

This is a fair recipe for people with experience baking pumpkin seeds before, but for beginners, just thought i would add a few notes.

1) You need to clean the seeds off first by rinsing them in a collander under cold water until there are no pumpkin guts left on the.
2) After rinsing them, if you boil the seeds in a pot with some salt(you can add other seasonings too)then the shells will be much crispier after baking, and also it helps make them easier to digest.
      *approximately 3 cups water per cup of pumpkin seeds*
3)Just a note: adding other seasonings can be a very fun experience. my favorites are salt,rosemary, and garlic powder; and brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. all are very tasty!

great flavor, but the oven temp at 300 was too high, most of them burnt.  I'll try this again, but at a lower temp.

Boil the pumpkin seeds first about 30min in heavly salted water.  This give them a salty flavor on the inside and allow the stringy pumpkin to seperate off the seeds easier.  Let them cool. Remove ALL pumpkin residue or it will burn during roasting.  Then roast or leave overnight to dry on baking dish and roast the next day.  

Takes only 25 min to roast and stir every 5-7min.

This was by far the best recipe I've tried for pumpkin seeds. Making sure they were dry before baking was the key. I added a little more butter and some garlic powder, and they are great!

Immediately after the seeds were baked, I moved them all close together and sprinkled 1T cinnamon sugar over the seeds.  Back into the oven for about 2 minutes just to help set the sugar mix.  YUM!!!

I followed the recipe for the first time and it was great.  I did crush my sea salt to a finer powder.  This is great.  Now I will adjust my salt to include a spicer blend.  Once you know the end taste of the recipe you can adjust it.  I would recommend to follow it first and then create your own.

I had 4 cups, used 2 tbsp of butter and seasoned salt.  Cooked @ 300 degrees for 1 hour, and stirred half way between.  I did not drain or clean the seeds with water.  I like that added taste of the pumpkin.  Turned out great.  Just watch to be sure they don't dry out too much.

This recipe was so delicious! I used low-fat yogurt butter, and I added cinnamon and sugar to the butter and salt mixture, and I coated the seeds in a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking them. The sugary taste was so good! Keep an eye on the time though, and check at least every 10 minutes. Sugar made pan sticky, but tasted very good. My family loved these! It's really a fool proof recipe. I'm 13 and I did it. Thanks Rosemary!

Don't follow this recipe as is - if you follow the directions exactly, your seeds will come out tasting and smelling like chewy, burnt popcorn.

My suggestion would be to follow the reviews instead of the actual recipe. (Sometimes this site cracks me up - a recipe is rated as five stars, but everyone that rates it as such follows a completely modified recipe instead).

Dry the raw seeds out for 24 hours, then boil in salted water for ten minutes, and dry. Cook at 250 instead of 300, and stir them every 10 minutes while they're cooking.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I first boiled the seeds in heavily salted water until they turned somewhat gray.  I then coated the seeds in a mixture of 1 TBS butter, 1 TBS olive oil, and salt after which I roasted them in the 300 degree oven for about 30 minutes on a foil-lined cookie sheet, stirring once.  They were delicious and more flavorful than those I've merely roasted in salt and oil for many years. Thanks to the originator and to those reviewers who added suggestions.

I buy these in bulk at Winco (they are the raw pumpking seeds and are green not white). I soak them in 4 cups of warm water with 1/4 cup of salt for about 15 minutes.  Put on a baking sheet and cook for about 15 minutes at 375 degrees. I'm addicted to these.

I have to give this recipe the best rating. I didn't know what to expect when I made these. Because I never even heard of eating Pumpkin Seeds before until my picky eater 4 year old daughter had them at school. I made them and she loved them they came out perfect, within 20 minutes of making them, my daughter ate them Shell and all. I did boil them for like 45 seconds before mixing in the butter mixture to make sure all excess pumpkin was off though, Just for my piece of mine. They were EXCELLENT.  I cant wait till my next pumpkin. To me they taste like Sunflower seeds. Absolutley a keeper. Thank You!!!! :O)

for some reason we grew up basicly roasting our salted pumpkin seeds on an oiled cookie sheet until they were almost dry. these were good but i was curious about what other folks did. here we are at another halloween & i found this neat recipe. the butter gives the pumpkin seeds a richer taste & wonderful golden color. we added a bit more than a pinch of salt & someday may try this with garlic powder or seasoned salt but in the meantime the basic toasted pumpkin seed rules! thanks & have a great autumn, rosemary.

Getting the pumpkin seeds out of the pumpkin, etc. is a hassle.  But, we liked the results.

These taste so much better with butter than the olive oil I've used in past years!  Thanks for the recipe - this is the one we'll be using from now on!

I follow this recipe every time I carve our pumpkins. I usually coat with sugar & cinnamon instead of salt. Very good & easy recipe :)

My husband loved these.   I rinsed the seeds and let them dry overnight.  I then sprayed seeds with fat free olive oil (only to cut down on calories but butter would have been more flavorful I think) and then sprinkled with sea salt.   I baked them on the top rack in my oven for 40 minutes (until golden brown), stirring them every 10 minutes.  After I took them out of the oven for the first stirring, I sprayed a bit more OO, and sprinkled a bit more salt. They turned out golden brown and crunchy.

This is a great treat in the fall. Just a tip..boiling the seeds for 15-25 seconds makes it easier to remove the extras.

My 12 year old daughter made these all by herself, and used the seeds from our Halloween pumpkin.  She added some sugar and cinnamon as another person suggested, and they are delicious.  We all keep coming back for more!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe. The seeds turned out crunchy and buttery tasting. I used two cups of seeds and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. I sprinkled Lawry's seasoned salt all over the seeds before baking. Yummy. Thanks for a great recipe.Happy HALLOWEEN!

Happy day after Halloween!  I followed the recipe - somewhat.  Followed one reviewer's advice and boiled the seeds, dried them overnight on a cookie sheet and then coated them with a butter, olive oil, and salt mixture. Roasted at 300 degrees for around 30 minutes. The family said they were the best we have had - thank you Rosemary.

Works okay, but I found it better to simmer seeds in salt water first.  I then lightly dried seeds by spreading seeds on sheet pan and placing in oven that was brought to 300 degrees and then shut off.  I found that dry seeds hold butter and oil better for the baking process.  When baking seeds I used 1 tbs of unsalted butter melted and a few drops of EVOO and mixing in bowl (3 cups of seed).  After baking at 300 for approx. 30 minutes I removed from oven  and coated with nutritional yeast and a hint of sugar.  The salted water adds plenty of salt, especially as these were primarily going for the kids.  

Nutritional yeast is a healthy alternative to salt and butter and toppings with weird additives.  An additional hint: I found that if I bake on a silpat sheet it is not necessary to stir seed during baking as they brown equally well on bottom.

I made these exactly as stated in the recipe.  They were DELICIOUS.  Had a hard time not eating them all myself.  I had about 8 pumpkins.  After they cool completely I am going to seal them in 4 oz packages using my Foodsaver and using them as part of treat baskets for Christmas.

I did this in my toaster oven so having them all spread out in one layer isn't possible.  I reached in with a fork and stirred them every once in a while.

One change, I didn't use butter but sprayed the seeds with Pam and then sprinkled with sea salt for one variety and cinnamon/sugar for the other.

200 degrees for about 25 minutes made them perfect.  Simple and wonderful.

Chnaged it  up a little. Boiled then simmered the seeds AND some of the stringy pulp with 2 tsp of salt for about 15 min. In a seperate bowl, made a mixture of 1 stick of melted butter, 1/2 cup of honey and a pinch of cinnamon. After draining the seeds and pulp I mixed all of it together then spread out onto a cookie sheet. Baked for 30-35 min at 375 degrees or until they were toasty brown. The house smelled so good and it was soooo yummy, both seeds and pulp!

These are the best pumpkin seeds I've ever roasted.  So simple and yet, absolutely perfect.  I had 3 cups of raw pumpkin seeds- 3 med/small pumpkins.  Melted 2 Tbs. unsalted butter, poured butter over bowl of seeds and mixed with a spoon.  Next I placed all the seeds on one cookie sheet and sprinkled with salt. Placed them in 300 degree gas oven and cooked for 45 minutes, stirring every few minutes.  These seeds are beautifully golden and possess an amazing crunch!
A perfect fall snack.  Thank you!

Rather than boil in salt water per suggestions, I only changed up a bit by putting the seeds in a skillet with butter, ovoo, and sea salt.  Stirred enough to heat through, then baked.  Perfectly delicious!

I figured out that you really need to make sure that your seeds are dry.  This recipe has little flavor.  I used about 2 cups of dry seeds, 2 Tb butter, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce and salt to taste.  Slow cook those @ 250 for 2 hrs stirring occasionally.  These were awesome.  Try it, you will see.

Cleaned seeds then boiled in heavily salted water for 20 minutes.  Mixed with 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil, garlic powder & Italian seasoning.  My kids love pumpkin seeds & don't want to wait 24 hours so I don't do any of the drying out overngiht that others suggested.  Just plan to bake them longer. YUMMMMM!!

First off, the boiling suggested by some reviewers isn't necessary if you soak the seeds in a bowl of water immediately after digging them out of the pumpkins and just scrub them between your hands once in awhile when you plop another handful into the bowl. Most of the guts come off easily. I allowed the seeds to dry about 24 hrs. I had twice the amount called for and I wanted spicy garlic-flavored seeds, so I used 2 tbsp homemade pepper oil (olive oil and red pepper flakes does nicely - let the mixture sit at least 24 hrs before using), and then mixed together 1tbsp sea salt and several healthy shakes of garlic powder and stirred that into the oiled seeds. I roasted them as the recipe directs and they're DELICIOUS!!! Totally addictive with just a hint of spicy heat.

I read the adjustments everyone said to try, but decided to go with the recipe as done. I sprayed the baking sheet with pam, then spread the pumpkin seeds on it, drizzled a little olive oil and a scoop of melted margarine (I Can't Believe it's not Butter) over the top of the seeds. A couple of grinds of sea salt, spread them out evenly with the back of a slotted spoon. and baked for 35-40 mins. (I stirred it twice during the cooking)... Really yummy!!

There appears to be a debate over whether to use butter or oil. I used butter because I love butter - wrong choice. Butter burns. Next time I will use oil.

Just the recipe I was looking for.. simple and original!  I used cooking spray instead of butter (less fat & calories.. came out perfect)

We had high hopes for this recipe after reading all the great reviews.  We followed the recipe to a T, and they were burnt and bland.  We made one batch plain, and added some honey to another batch.  Both burned.  We'll keep looking. Sorry.

Excellent! Far superior to any of the packaged pumpkin seeds you can buy at the grocery store. I added some garlic powder and my only batch was gone by the end of the next day. I've vowed to buy many more pumpkins next year just for the seeds!

Used this with butternut squash seeds. Tried what others said and dried overnight after rinsing and only needed 20 minutes to bake (follow your nose - when you smell it, it's ready!). I never used to eat roasted seeds with the shell on but these are delicious. Only needed about a teaspoon of butter for all the seeds in a small butternut squash.

This is the pumpkin seed recipe I pretty much follow.  I rinse most of the pulp out of the seeds and mix about 2 tbl. of butter and then spread with salt and/or Lawry's seasoning.  As I carve about 5 pumpkin every Halloween, I have about 6 cookie sheet of seeds to bake.  I bake each sheet for about 30-45 minutes at 350.  They are gone in days.

LOVE THESE!!! We dry them 1st without rinsing them off (we do remove all the "guts" from them). We enjoy the roasted pumpkin flavor w/ the butter & salt.

i did try the boiling in salted water method first then dried them out overnight. I used butter and some oil and salt. I had to split the seeds in two batches to make sure they weren't all on top of each other. They turned out very nice.

Very simple-which is what I was looking for.  I did not want to wait for the seeds to dry overnight as some reviewers recommended so I spread them on a baking sheet and put them in a warm (170 degree) oven for a couple of hours and it dried them nicely.  I then proceeded with recipe using season salt.

The butter is the key!  Well salt is also necessary but in the past i've just toasted them with salt after cleaning them in water, but adding butter is SO much better!  I can't wait to make these again!!!!  They were incredible and they didn't last long unfortunately! :-)

I following another reviewers suggestion about drying the seeds overnight and also about 1T butter & 1T olive oil.  Also since I LOVE salt I increased the salt by a 1/2 t....WRONG!  I wish I had followed the recipe there.  I also sprinkled 1T sugar after roasting...what a great taste!  The grandchildren are coming over this weekend and we are going to make some more together!

After mixing 2 cups of pumpkin seeds and 3 teaspoons of melted butter together; I layed out half the mixture and added tons of salt. It is delicious. If you accidentally use too much salt, melt some chocolate chips and coat this wonderful treat with chocolate.

I put extra salt on because I LOVE salt. DON'T DO THIS! even though it seems like a small-ish amount, use what it says! Mine were WAY WAY WAY too salty.

I agree with joscrazym in that you have to boil until grey (about 10-15 min.) before baking them.  I've tried for many years to roast pumpkin seeds and they never turn out right, but I took his advice and they turned out great - so much flavor on the inside and not just the shell!

I have found roasted pumpkin seeds MUCH tastier if you remove the guts from the seeds, but then bake the seeds with the guts. Also DON'T rinse them as this just rinses off the yummy pumpkin flavor. Bake in a glass pan with olive oil and salt and the guts, stirring occasionally. I get rave reviews from my co-workers for having such tasty seeds. They do get a little soggy if packed into tupperware or plastic bags, but still yummy.

For those of your who like them salty but don't want to mess with boiling them in salt water.... I added 2-3 tablespoons of salt instead of a pinch and then put them in a colendar when they're done to shake off the excess salt....really good and salty enough for my family!

Excellent...I took the advise of others and boiled the seeds for 45 min, let dry overnight and then roasted.  This will be a yearly Halloween tradition from now on.

Just made a batch and their great! I tossed them in butter and salt and then every 15 minutes took them out of the oven, shook them around, and added a little more salt.  Simple and YUMMY!

These were really good.  I mixed a bunch of tips from other reviews and they came out perfectly!  I boiled them in salt water for about 30 minutes, then let them dry on paper towels overnight, then used both butter and olive oil, and added granulated garlic and white pepper.  Since I changed it so much, I gave four stars, not five.  I cannot imagine it with just salt.

We had a pumpkin on our fall harvest table in daycare and cut it open yesterday to examine it.  We toasted the pumpkin seeds and they are absolutely addictive - I wish it had been a bigger pumpkin!  I used seasoning salt.  I also boiled them for 30 seconds as suggested by another reviewer to remove any residual pumpkin strings.

I don't keep butter around usually, so I used olive oil instead, yum! I also tried the cinnamon and sugar idea, those are in the oven!! Definitly a big hit with my 4 year old! :)

Very good. I made two batches, both were tossed in butter and seasoned salt, one was also tossed in a little worchester sauce, and i sprinkled the other with a little sugar when they were warm. My fav was the sugar, but the worchester disappeared at work.

GREAT!  Just a nice, simple recipe.  Use butter - it makes the difference.  The color is golden brown and the taste creamy.  I added cinnamon and sugar before baking and during baking to make dessert pumpkin seeds.  YUM!

I made this recipe, but soaked my seeds in salt water over night. Then followed the recipe accordingly. The roasted seeds were DELICIOUS!! Golden brown, crispy and just enough salty flavor!

300 degrees for 45 minutes is way too hot for too long. My oven is accurate and if anything runs a bit cool.   Set the timer for 15 minutes to stir them and they were already browned.  After 30 minutes they were beginning to smell burnt.   I turned the oven down to 250 and left them for another 5 minutes.    

After cooling they taste overly browned...almost burnt.  The shells are so over baked that they crumble instead of split.  It's easier to eat the entire seed, shell and all...but the taste isn't good.   

Suggest turning your oven down to 250 and baking a little longer.   I will also try what others have suggested and boil the seeds first in salted water, allow to dry and then roast.

Here is my helpful hint. When cleaning out the inside of the pumpkin use an ice-cream scoop. I broke my large spoon scooping one year and went to the drawer and saw the ice-cream scoop, tried it and never looked back. Love roasted pumpkin seeds.

Finally! I have roasted pumpkin seeds before but I never care for the end result. I used less butter, only 1Tbs. and I ground up Kosher salt and used about half a teaspoon. I think it's the temp. that mades a difference. Plus I never added any butter before so these were really good. I added some sugar like some other posters and it really is a nice touch. (I have a sweet tooth so keep that in mind) they almost remind me of honey roasted peanuts for some reason, perhaps it was the sweet cream butter??? either way thanks a lot Rosemary, and all the reviewers. This recipe is a keeper!

Good, but I think I will simmer my seeds in salt water first before I dry them so they have a saltier taste.

I added extra salt, and they still have little flavor, and I think they are too hard, even though they are well-browned. I think 2 tsp. is too much butter, as they were greasy.  Next time I will try the "boil them in salt water" method instead, then bake with oil and spices.

I had to use a little more butter with mine but I think I should have left them in the oven a while longer. They weren't as toasty as I would have liked them. Every oven is different though and I guess it's just trial and error. Love pumpkin seeds!

These are a great use of a hulled pumpkin.  I did not measure the salt and added a little garlic powder.  I did bake them much longer until a nice, rich color.

Boiled seeds for 15-20 minutes to remove excess gunk.  Spread out on cookie sheet, sprayed with PAM and sprinkled with seasoned salt.  Baked as directed.

A very nice recipe, I did substitute Nu Salt for a family member who is watching their sodium intake, and I did cook at a slightly  higher temp (320) for same time (45 mins) to get more crunch. This was simple and easy and tastes great! Next time I may try the soaking in salt water as suggested by others.

This was GREAT- but I used garlic salt instead of just salt. Next time, I will bake them slightly longer and/or even broil them for the last few minutes as I like mine extra crispy!

Used about 1 tsp salt instead of a pinch.  This was excellent.  Tasted like buttered popcorn!  Next time will add a pinch of sugar right when it comes out of the oven.

I boiled these in salted water first and sprinkled them pretty well before going into the oven. A 'dash" is not near enough. They were pretty bland.

I wish I had thought of mixing butter and olive oil-great combo, and I do that in a lot of regular recipes as well. I found that other reviewers' suggestions of checking after every 10 min. is worthwhile. I needed to turn my oven down to 285 after 20 min. and only roasting for another 5 min. Perfect! Thanks for just the right combo. I need to put these away before I eat them all...

The most important element of pumpkin seeds is getting the pumpkin seeds dry enough. I liked the result of the 300 degrees for 45 min better than the 225 for an hour and a half that I tried last time I made these. Thanks!

I've never been a fan of toasted pumpkin seeds but seeing all the positive reviews made me want to try this one. It was very good! Not necessary to dry or boil the seeds beforehand. Ours went straight from the pumpkin to the cookie sheet. We toasted them a little longer than the recipe said so they would be good and crisp. Also added extra salt for flavor. We sprinkled garlic powder on a few and fresh cracked pepper on a few; those were good as well. We'd definitely make this one again!

These turned out great. They lacked a certain taste so I added a little garlic salt after and they were perfect. I dried them overnight first and while baking them at 300 degrees, I stirred them around every 10 minutes and they came out nice and crispy! Mm!

The only thing that worked on this recipe was the temp and cooking time. I ended up using more butter and a LOT more salt. As this stands I thought the seeds were incredibly bland and I could barely taste the salt.

This was a good, simple recipe for pumpkin seeds.  I thought it might be good if I didn't rinse the seeds, as I've always done before, and it might add some pumpkin flavor.  This wasn't a good idea as the pumpkin on the unrinsed seeds burned a little.  My suggestion is to be sure you rinse the seeds well.  I think other reviewers suggestions of adding garlic is a good one.  I'll try that.

Classic and delicious! I made my second batch using a tablespoon of melted butter instead of the suggested 2 tsp, the extra butter brought out more of a nutty flavor. They were so yummy, my whole family loved them!

These turned out great! Thanks for the recipe. I used garlic salt, salt, and pepper on mine. These formerly ho-hum seeds were a hit at my house!

Very good recipe.  I have never used butter/marg before just salt so this was a nice change and will use this recipe in the future.  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious and so easy! I'm not a fan of pumpkin seeds but my granddaughters are so I decided to try these. They are truly addictive! I followed the recipe as written except, as I had 3 cups of seeds, I used 2T of butter and did dry them out overnight since they were very wet. As recommended, I used 2 cookie sheets to ensure a single layer. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I let the seeds dry for a couple of days on a tray and then roasted for 40 minutes at 300 degrees on tray lined with parchment paper. I added a little olive oil to cut back on the butter.

So simple! I just tossed them in the butter and then sprinkled the salt after. I think you can taste the salt better in the end that way.

I admit it...I wing it.  I don't have much time so I just throw things together. I did not wash the seeds or soak them at all.  I threw it all together and put it on a pan and put it in the oven until it was done.  I forgot to set the timer so I don't even know how long it took.  But the seeds turned out fabulous!  If it doesn't taste right, I think it could be your seeds. Just a thought.  Thank you for keeping this recipe simple.

I personally didn't love these, but I don't like pumpkin seeds.  The kids and hubby loved them, though.  They wanted to dig more seeds out of the trash from our pumpkin carving afternoon adventure, but I told them we had roasted plenty!  I did salt them again when pulled out of the oven.  Will do this again next year!

The variations on this recipe are many. You can used garlic salt and parmesan or if you like them spicy some cajun seasoning.

Perfect.  I did dry them overnight, but did everything else as written.  Checked them and stirred every 10 minutes and they were done in about 37 minutes.

Roasted Pumpkin Seeds' Haiku: "Can't go wrong with these. Carve your pumpkin, save the seeds! Maybe some more salt?" The hardest part of doing this is yanking and cleaning the seeds from the pumpkin guts, and waiting on them to dry; otherwise, following this recipe couldn't be easier, and the result is a nice, simple roasted pumpkin seed. Course, one could always add a plethora of seasonings, sugars, or spices, but this is a tasty, unpretentious treat.

Excellent!  I boiled them first with salted water.  Laid out on a cookie sheet and dried for about 24 hours. Tossed with butter as directed and roasted 3 batches- one with salt and a touch of olive oil and then added a dash of sugar after- one with salt and buttery popcorn oil and the last with garlic powder and salt.... My favorite was definitely the garlic powder and salt batch!  Yummy!

This recipe is great!  Instead of regular salt I used a packaged spicy salt blend including sea salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper.  I also baked them longer, about 1 hour, stirring every 10 minutes.  They were crispy and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Per the suggestions of others, I tried garlic powder on half the seeds and cinnamon/sugar on the other half.  Nobody in my family liked the cinnamon/sugar coated seeds.  My husband said he would like a little more garlic powder than I added, so I will double the salt and garlic powder next time (maybe a 1/2 tsp of each).

I found this recipe for some seeds from a pie pumpkin I got for my step daughter. Incidentally, her name  is Rosemary. I've tried other recipies, but this one definitely hits it on the button! Great Recipe!
The only change we made was we checked on them with about 13 minutes to go, and they were all done so we took them out.

Substitute butter with 1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil for healthier recipe. Also once you have separated/washed the pumpkin seeds, put in a metal colander, run cold water through them to make sure everything is clean, then use a blowdryer through the holes of the colander while mixing seeds around with hand. Dries the seeds in 8 min and no loads of soggy paper towels and long air-drying times. My oven worked best with 35 min. Easy snack, addicting, and good for you!

It was a very easy recipe...I just took clean seeds from 3 pumpkins, soaked them in heavily salted water for several hours, drained them, spread them loosely on many different cookie sheets, let them air dry for a few hours then one at a time put them in a 300 degree oven for 40 minutes (used a metal spatula to "stir" around at the 20 min mark) and put them in an airtight container out of the oven.

Decent base, but DO get creative, and DO boil them first. I boiled mine in salt water for about 20 minutes, then allowed to air dry overnight. Didn't use any butter, but just olive oil and garlic salt. Lined the pan w/ foil for easy cleanup, then poured ranch dressing powder over the second half. Mmmm. Ate so many yesterday that my tummy hurts today. :)

I use a little more butter and add a touch of Worcestershire or liquid smoke. I also cook a bit of the stringy stuff from inside the pumpkin (tossed in the same butter mixture and spread thin on cookie sheet). When this roasts up (sometimes it takes longer then seeds) it tastes awesome.

I added a little garlic salt to give it more flavor. It's important to make sure the seeds are very clean and completely dry before doing this as well.

This recipe works perfectly.  I also have tried changing up the "flavors" by making a batch of "cinnamon and sugar", "seasoned salt and garlic" or if you like it spicy..."seasoned salt, garlic and cayenne pepper".  Yum.  I got rave reviews from a friends daughter (a teenager) so I knew I got it right!  haha

Very good. I recommend after rincing the seeds, letting the dry for a little longer than the recipe calls for. Also sea salt tastes great.

My family tells me these were good.  I set the seeds out overnight to dry, I used seasoning salt and butter and after they cooled slightly, my children gobbled up their portions.  I had a nice big bowl of seeds left over and my husband stole them and ate them when I wasn't looking.  He said they were great.  

Oh well - maybe next time.

I love pumpkin seeds, but I've always found it hard to get just the right crispness to them without overcooking.  This is definitely the perfect basic recipe!  I used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.

I followed the suggestion of a reviewer & separated out the seeds, then boiled them x 20 minutes to clean them off & allowed them to dry overnight on a cookie sheet. The result the next morning were seeds that were tasty without the seasoning. The inner pulp was moist while the outer shell was crunchy. I used fake salt UNsuccessfully due to my sodium restricted diet  but the flavor was too obvious as being fake salt. Use real salt.

I tried as I have tried many times over the years. I didn't like this, but of course I just have never liked roasted, cooked or anything pumkin seeds. Sorry this didn't change my mind! YUCK! I'll rate this as 4 stars just to be nice. Roasted Pumkin Seeds Just Don't Do It For Me. And this reipe didn't do it as well!

Well I can't say how the original recipe would have turned out since I made a few changes. I boiled the seeds in heavily salted water for 20 minutes and then let them soak another hour. I layed them on papertowels to dry for almost 2 days. Then I mixed them with 1TB of butter, 1TB Olive Oil and 1TB of salt and baked in the oven on 300 degrees for 40 minutes and they were toasted with just the right amount of salt.

These were ok but a little drier than I like. I like to shell mine and the shell was to brittle to shell easily. I also tried a batch using seasoned salt and the flavor was amazing.

Instead of the Creole seasoning please do try the sugar and cinnamon seasoning. Anything works with Butter!!! I just thought of trying a nutmeg spiced seed...... Will let y'all know how that comes out!

I boiled mine for a few min and let dry for at least 24 hrs. If you decide to let them dry before roasting make sure YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THEM! They roast very fast. So so yummy :)

It was ok.  I have never had these, similar to sunflower seeds I guess :)  Did ours with Garlic Salt & pepper.

I made some last year, and they didn't turn out.  I tried this one this year, and they turned out perfect.  I did sprinkle mine with some garlic salt though.

These were soooo good!  Just the standard pumpkin seed, but that is fine with me!  About a cup of raw seeds only took about 25 minutes in my oven...so be careful to watch them so they don't burn!  Thanks for sharing!!

used garlic salt (most definately more than a pinch) and these came out wonderfully!  Didn't pay much heed to the cook time, just checked and stirred every 10 minutes until I felt they were done. (w/ one or two taste tests *smile*)

This is the simplest recipe for someone just starting out.  I've been roasting seeds for years and my favorite is this:  gut the pumpkin and separate the seeds.  Rinse and then soak the seeds in salt water over night up to 24 hours, then I lay them out on parchment paper and paper towels to dry, typically overnight to 24 hours.  I then take them off the paper towels and spread them out on the parchment paper to continue drying.  Once I'm happy with how dry the seeds are I then follow the above recipe.  I suggest roasting the seeds in multiple batches to prevent them from being under cooked or potentially burning. I do this in multiple batches depending how many pumpkins  I have.  My way is not hard, it just takes several days to do a batch, but they come out perfect every time.

FYI to newbies on the seed-roasting front. Fresh from the pumpkin, roasted, you can eat the shells. They aren’t woody like the store bought kind. They don’t accumulate in your mouth like that... not splintery etc... so seasoning the outside works great! I like to add a dash of Cajun seasoning or something of the like. 

I think this recipe’s cook-time largely varies based on your pumpkin seeds. I used them fresh after a rinse and wipe-dry from the pumpkin and they were over-done in under 15 minutes. The seeds were from a pie pumpkin, and about 3/4 cup. so more delicate than a jack o lantern seed. I definitely ate every single one though! Lol! Talk about a fiber rush!

Roasted as directed, seasoned only with salt. My preschooler is gobbling them up.  I did try rinsing them in a bowl of water as suggested by one reviewer To clean them but ultimately found I needed to boil them as others had suggested. That worked best.

Tasty! I put the seeds in a bowl of water and soaked them overnight. Then I rinsed them off in a colander...cleaned up perfectly. Spread them out on a cookie sheet to dry overnight. I only had 1 cup of seeds and the butter was a bit too much but was fine anyway. I used a combo of garlic salt and seasoned salt. I think any kind of salt to your liking will work!

These are fantastic but I only cooked mine for 25 min and they were perfect, any longer in the oven and they would have been way overdone. All ovens have different cooking times

I brought 2-1/3 Cup seeds to a boil in salted water for 20 minutes, then air and sun dried outdoors for an hour on a large clean towel.  I used 2 Tablespoons real butter, a pinch of sea salt and pinch of Nu Salt (potassium)due to my low sodium diet. I shuffled the seeds and lightly sprinkled Nu Salt halfway through.  They are crunchy and done when they slide around freely on the cookie sheet when shaken.  That took my oven 38 minutes at 300 degrees.  Crunchy and full of flavor.  I will not share :)

Boil and then simmer seeds in salt water until grey, then toss in olive oil and bake. Watch closely so they don't burn

Made these twice now. Did small pumpkin and squash seeds first time and so delicious and simple! Did the large pumpkin seeds tonight and so yummy as well. Thanks for the simple recipe. These are the best my pumpkin and squash seeds have ever turned out!

This recipe is wonderful.  I've made before but I used olive oil and have always cooked the same night.  Don't know if it made a difference but this time I let them dry out overnight.  The butter really makes a difference.  I mixed it all in a bowl and then also added some garlic powder.  I stirred every 15mins for 1hr and then left in oven another 15mins with oven turned off.  Perfect!   I had a big pumpkin so the seeds were bigger and I had no problem with them burning.  For those that have had them burn, check and make sure you put on middle shelf and if seeds are smaller then cook less.

this recipe worked for me, however i used way more salt and cooked it for at least an hour, turning frequently. a dash of sugar at the end was interesting, but i like the original better.

I have done something similar. I rise them in salted water for about ten minutes. Five if you're stirring. Then I lay them out on a cookie sheet and pour melted butter over them and sprinkle garlic salt on them. (Some people add Lawry's season salt but not I) And then I bake them on 350 until  they brown. Witch is usually like 15 minutes just depends on what size pumpkins you get.

I add a couple of steps before following this recipe: Heat a pot of water to boil, generously salt it, stir to dissolve, turn off the fire and add the pumpkin seeds. I let this sit overnight, then drain the seeds, spread them on a sheet pan and let them dry thoroughly, about another day or so. To me, this add a deeper salty flavor that actually penetrates into the seeds. Then I follow this recipe, stirring the seeds occasionally. Absolutely fantastic!

This recipe works perfectly for us. The seeds come out wonderfully crisp and full of flavor. I do like to dry my seeds overnight before roasting as they seem to get crispier.  Use as much salt as you like (my husband likes a lot). Extra fine popcorn salt seems to stick the best. Thanks for the recipe!

I think I used too much butter or something, but these aren't as crisp as I was hoping for.  There's a very fine line between just right and burnt. They have a yummy flavor, just not very crunchy.  I might try dry roasting them next time.

I don't carve the pumpkins..I just reach inside and put all the seeds in a collander...clean with water sprayer...then I put them into a sauce pan on low and stir constantly to get rid of all the water.  then I add the butter to melt and then throw the pumpkins and butter back intothe collander to get all access butter off of them.  I also put a wash rag in the door of the oven so steam can escape! Awesome!

Yum! This is a good, basic pumpkin seed recipe. I made a small batch from a pie pumpkin, about 3/4 cups, and they were done in about 25 minutes. I also left them in the oven after turning it off to let them dry a bit more. Pumpkin seeds are our favorite after making pumpkin soup or jack-o-lanterns!

I washed the seeds in water first and patted them dry. Tasted awesome with just butter and salt!  I don't cook them for 45 minutes though, about 30 is enough otherwise they get too dark for my liking

I don't know why mine didn't turn out as well as all the other reviews, maybe I had too much butter for the amount of seeds, but mine were either burnt or soggy. Sorry.

I have been roasting pumpkin seeds for 20+ years.  I was always under the assumption that you didn't need to let them dry out (rebellion on my part!).  I decided to try this recipe and and followed others suggestions about letting them hang for about 24 hours.  Yeah, do it.  I melted (sorry I just winged it Butter, maybe a TBLS and added some olive oil for about 2 cups or so).  I also added to that wet mixture some salt, garlic powder, "wor-blah-shire" sauce.  Then I threw a bunch of seeds in it, stirred it up, put in on a greased and foiled cookie sheet.  300 degrees for 45 mins while shaking up the pan every little bit....came out super yummy.  Can't go wrong

These are so addicting.  I love them!  I personally wanted them a little saltier so I salted them generously while they were cooling.  Next time I would definitely use more salt before baking.  I would imagine if you boil them in salt water first they'll get nice and salty too.  I just cleaned them out of the pumpkin and let them dry over night, tossed them in the salt and butter and roasted for exactly 45 min.  Yum!

I'm not even a big fan of pumpkin seeds, but after carving a pumpkin, I decided to put the seeds to use and bring them to a family get together on Halloween. Well, OH MY GOODNESS... these were delicious! I followed the directions exactly, but before baking, I sprinkled a hearty amount of garlic powder in addition to the sea salt, which added a nice flavor. Everyone in the family loved them. I'm positive that I'll be making these every year!

Like Joseph, I boiled in salt water first.  Then spread on the cookie sheet overnight to dry. When I added the oil & seasonings, I also sprinkled a bit of soy sauce, and baked about 30 minutes at 325, turning at 10 minute intervals.  Perfect!

I think this recipe would have turned out really well, but I took the suggestion to boil them in salt water. THIS I would discourage -- by boiling them in salt water they do take on extra salt but it makes the seeds WAY too salty. Simply coating the seeds in butter and a light sprinkling of salt should be enough. I also added some pumpkin pie spice afterwards which helped to cut the saltyness, but is also quite good!

We make 4 tasty versions of this recipe each year in my classroom and have kids (and teachers) taste test them to see which one is the favorite.  We do Butter & Salt,  Spicy Taco (made by using a packet of taco seasoning), Cinnamon Sugar and Garlic and Herb (made with garlic salt and Italian seasoning).  Everyone loves it and we get requests for it each year!

For roasted pumpkin seeds I am sure this recipe is the bomb. We do like them but they are not as good as the store bought ones and I boiled them for a few minutes to loosen them from the membrane and tossed them in the butter and salt and tested one and I liked them better before they were put into the oven. I am going to try making them boiled somehow. We do like this recipe tho and am sure we will make these again.

Easy. Quick. Tasty. I made half with regular salt and half with seasoned salt-the seasoned salt was a nice twist; works just as well with olive oil.

These are good but need more flavor. The salt doesn't stick to the seeds very well.

Make sure you rinse off the seeds in a colander and let dry for 4 to 24 hours. I followed the recipe however, garlic powder and McCormick season all.  Next time I think I will boil them in salt, dry them and roast them with olive oil.

Thanks for helping me make my very first roasted pumpkin seeds a success.   Butter and salt...two of my favorite ingredients.  Can't go wrong with that. Plus I needed a simple recipe to use especially after spending hours of carving pumpkins with the family.

Butter is nice for roasting but I think plain salt didn't have enough flavor. Next time I'll throw in a dash of tamari or soy sauce. Also mine only took 1/2 hour. My kids liked them!

This is a great recipe.  This is the first time I roasted pumpkin seeds, I thought it would be fun to make it a tradition when we carve pumpkins.  The first time I roasted them, I didn't know they were like sunflower seeds and you had to crack the shell.  I kept putting them back in the oven b/c I thought they weren't done, I kept saying, it taste like a shell like sunflower seeds.  I finally took some to my neighbor who said yep, you need to crack those puppies open!

If you rub the pumpkin pulp and seeds in your hands, (above a colander) you will find the seeds leave the pulp for the bottom of the colander.
I soaked them in water and mortons hot salt,(over night) toss them with olive oil and sprinkle a bit more hot salt. (I like spicey foods) Bake until golden.

These are really very good. I carved my pumpkin, sorted the seeds, rinsed them and dried them for about an hour (I am in a dry climate). Used more salt + garlic salt and flipped over halfway through cooking. Straight out of the oven these were delicious. :) Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I rinsed the seeds (didn't dry them), seasoned, and roasted (for about 55 minutes). I may add a little more salt the next time, or just use garlic salt instead of garlic powder.

This is your staple roasted seed recipe, and it's fantastic! MAKE SURE to dry seeds out on paper towels after rinsing them off in a collinder. Once they're dry, toss them w/ melted butter-NEVER USE OIL-real butter only. The oil vs. butter thing makes a big difference. Roast until brown and toasty. Cool, serve, and munch away! BEWARE: They're addictive!

Really liked these. Used olive oil(faster than having to melt butter) and coated seeds in cayenne and cajun seasoning. Cook time and temperature pretty accurate. I didn't soak or boil or dry these. Just rinsed, seasoned, and cooked.

Followed recipe exactly.  My whole family agreed that it needed much more than a pinch of salt: I sprinkled all seeds with sea salt.  I think I'd try garlic or seasoned salt next time.  Also, I cooked at the exact temp and times specified: not sure why some reviewers felt it needed more time.  Mine would have been burnt if I cooked for an hour, as someone noted.

Simple and easy, though you need a bit more than a pinch of salt (I did anyway).

These are time consuming, but fun for once a year.  I used a garlic salt combo.  My brother ate a large quantity of them, inhaled is probably the better word.

Yum. Followed other reviewers advice and boiled them in salt water and let dry overnight before roasting. The cooked pretty quick in my oven and need to perfect the timing a bit more.

I boiled my seeds for about 15 minutes and let dry over night.  Then I mixed with the butter but instead of salt, I added garlic salt.  It took about 45 minutes to roast, but they are so yummy!!!

Recipe  comes out just fine...I added about 1 tsp. salt and had to roast them for over an hour at 300 then I kicked it up to 350. Eventually they browned and were perfect.  Yum!

Love these... I used grapeseed garlic oil and salt then roasted. Yummy.  I made another batch that started burning because I forgot to set my timer, well my hubby LOVED these, he said he could eat the whole seed and they were nice and crunchy.  Grapeseed oil is so light and fewer calories, and makes a great bread dipping oil as well.

I substituted the butter for Benecol (good for lowering cholesterol) and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil.  I added more salt as recommended by another reviewer and baked in a convention oven for only 25 minutes - they came up fantastic, but they go so fast that I will have to buy another pumpkin! Thank you for a fabulous recipe.  This was my first time roasting pumpkin seeds and I could not believe how easy it was. I wish I had had this recipe when my daughters were young and we used to carve more pumpkins than now that is only me and my hubby. Well my grandaughters are getting to that age of carving pumpkins, so I will  enjoy them with them now!

The only thing I used in this recipe is the oven temperature and cooking time. Rinsed the seeds in a colander, let them dry over night, mixed them with olive oil, seasoned salt and garlic salt. Turned out very yummy!

I love pumpkin seeds...these were great!  I made sure that the seeds were dry (dried them for more than 24 hrs to be sure)and I followed the recipe with the exception of adding garlic salt like one reviewer had suggested.  I think I may just carve some more pumpkins just to get more seeds!

Perfect enough for me. If you like a more salted flavor, boil in salt water or salt more often. I followed the recipe and it was perfect.

I wish I would have read all the reviews before cooking mine. Even though I was stirring every few min. I sat down to have lunch and by the next 10 min. they were burnt.  A shame because I think they would have been GREAT.  In my oven I don't think they need more than 25 minutes.  I will attempt another batch later this week as I have more pumpkin pies to make :) i'll be sure to come back and re-review this recipe.

They were greasy and bland.  After I cooked them I had to wash them off, sprinkle salt on them and bake them for another 20 min. to get them crunchy again.

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! I used a little extra salt and some freshly ground pepper. This will be the recipe I use from now on. Great snack!

These are tasty! Made them for a preschool class and their Harvest Party. Never had had them before. Will make again. I can actually see making these a bit spicy by putting a little Cajun seasoning on top.

I've tried a number of pumpkin seed recipes over the years, and so for this is the best.  I decided to take the seeds out of the oven about seven minutes early and found that they were still a little moist on the outside (probably due to the butter).  So I took advantage of this and seasoned them a little more with black pepper.  Though I'm sure that other seasonings would work very well too.

Boiling is a must! I boiled the seeds in salt water . And then roasted them with cinnamon and a little oil (just to grease the pan). My kids said they tasted like popcorn. I've roasted pumpkin seeds before without boiling them-they were not bad but no one went back for seconds, boiling was the missing step that made these fantastic!!

Delicious! I like mine so crunchy that it's easy to eat the whole seed and this did it. I had one cup of seeds and could have reduced the butter a little because I didn't have as much seeds at the recipe called for but they turned out perfect. I stirred every 15 minutes. Thanks Rosemary.

Loved it. I used A pinch of salt and Trader Joe's Onion Salt blend and I stirred every 10 minutes. . Yum! Also, I use a fork to comb out seeds before diggy out strings. Works for me. And lastly, I love taking basic recipes and experimenting after the first time or two so please keep the suggestions and comments coming on all recipes!

Since I do not use garlic powder (I prefer fresh garlic), I used a seasoning condiment (like a Mrs Dash but with sea salt), and it tasted heavenly.  I am now hooked on doing my own roasted pumpkin seeds with a little spicey herbs for flavour.

I used fresh out of the pumpkin, pumpkin seed. I washed them and laid out to dry for 24 hours. I doubled the recipe because I had so many seeds but I think the baking time was a bit too long. Mine came out a bit burnt. I should have checked more often but my expectations were higher.

Doesn’t matter is salt gets on the inside. They’re pumpkin seeds, not at all like sunflower seeds, you eat the shell too.

Pretty much all of the 5-star reviews that I read after making this myself (and trying to figure out what I did wrong) have tweaked the recipe. In my opinion, a pinch of salt that the recipe calls for is no where near enough and I don't usually even care much for salty foods.

I substituted coconut oil for the butter but used a small amount of blue bonnet to add some butter flavor  I used it all mixed to taste in way more than what was suggested and tossed it in a colander by dipping it into the bowl of coconut oil and blue bonnet and then tossing it to distribute it evenly then suspended it above using bbq tongs let drain for about 5 minutes while preheat oven... then I tossed it again with kosher salt and spread it on the pan and roasted it as with the recipe... the family loved it... and I reserved the coconut oil and blue bonnet mixture for my next few batches... because I've saved all the seeds I need for next season and I have a lot of pie pumpkins to cook this month...

I did everything but I also saw a "spicy" version and made my own. I did all the steps in this recipe but 10 mins after they had roasted I added Mrs Dash No Salt, Garlic Herb. They are addictive even with the shell.  I also didn't have to roast them quite as long for my taste.

Have been making pumpkin seeds like this for decades. There are those who want to complicate basic things. Just make them as written they are delicious.

This recipe worked really well! Thank you. As my grandma can't have butter I used coconut oil instead. I didn't make a difference! My family was fighting over them they were so good. I did add a sprinkle of pepper before they went into the oven. My Mom said they were especially delicious when sprinkled with cayenne.

We boiled our seeds in salty water. Waiting until they turned grey. Placed on a cookie sheet and roasted at 250 until dry. First time to make these and I preferred it this way. My mom did the original recipe and it wasn’t as salty.

This is as good as my mother used to make when I was a child (I never got her recipe). I added a light sprinkling of coarse pickling salt for appearance’s sake. I found a few extra minutes roasting time if the seeds are deeper in the pan. What a great Hallowe’en treat!

The only difference I did was to soak my pumpkins in a salt water brine in the fridge. Drained in the morning and followed the recipe. Delicious.

Good base recipe. I don’t like using butter so I switch out olive oil and sea salt. Timing is off for me I only needed 30 minutes as others mention. Also I recommend drying the seeds overnight before cooking. I haven’t tried the saltwater bath but next year I will.

I ended up only roasting them for 30 minutes and I probably could have taken them out at 25 minutes. I also added a sprinkle of fresh ground pepper.

I pretty much only used this recipe to find the baking temp. But I use olive oil instead of butter and I don’t really time how long they’re in the oven, I just roast until they’re golden brown. I also leave a bit of the pumpkin “guts” on the seeds because I like the flavor once it’s roasted

My Mom used to make these at Halloween with our jack-o-lantern pumpkin seeds.  I make them now when I have pie pumpkins, as the seeds are smaller and more tender.  Of note; if using seeds from a fresh pumpkin DO NOT rinse them!! Simply separate the seeds from the pulp with your hands.  Yes it's a bit slimy, but if you rinse them you lose A LOT of flavor.  I use seasoned salt instead of plain salt but you can season them however you like.  For example Cajun seasoning such as Zatarain's, Tony Cachere's,  or Slap Ya Mama would be good too!

A batch of these typically lasts about 30 minutes at my house!

Made as is and it is awesome! Best roasted pumpkin seeds I’ve ever had. My kids, 9&7, agree. I didn’t bother pre-melting butter - cut it up, spread out on baking sheet with seeds and salted it all. Stirred after first couple of minutes then after another 15 - 20 min’s. Perfect.

Good gracious, we can't stop eating them! I added a little more than a tablespoon of butter before I saw what the recipe called for.  The butter browned and gave the seeds an almost caramel flavour, so delicious! Not sure why anyone would boil these first, keep the recipe just as it is. With the butter content,  I decided to store them in the fridge, but they won't last long!

Love pumpkin season just for the seeds. I grow them myself. I put garlic and onion powder on them or Old Bay, Taco seasoning.

Not all pumpkin seeds are equal.  The seeds of the organic pumpkin I used for soup, when roasted per this recipe, were like eating wood chips (not that I've ever eaten wood chips).  Not at all like the pepitas I like, which come from a different variety.  Also, the recipe and video say that they are good and good for you, but don't say why they are good for you.  I would not recommend this recipe because it does not specify which variety of seeds should be used, and it is generally misleading.

Very good. I put parchment paper down on baking sheet and then after 20 minutes of baking, I took the seeds off the paper when I flipped them over. Makes turning the seeds over quite easy.

I had bought a pumpkin for Halloween, I though it was a waste to just throw it away given the fact that i hadn't carved it. I decided to look up pumpkin recipes and I found this one, anyway, I cut my pumpkin and pulled the seeds from it and it's currently in the oven and all I smell in the house is pumpkin.....(my other half doesn't like the smell of pumpkin lol). I added a little extra butter and some cinnamon and pumpkin spice. Can't wait to try them!

I followed the recipe exactly, and ours had the mouthfeel of sunflower seeds, with shell on.  Seems like a step must be missing.  So I let them cook longer - low and slow, following the advice I saw on some posts, and zero improvement, just darker brown.  Still felt like chewing a sunflower seed with slightly softened shell on.  Maybe next year, I'll try the boiling method first?  (cough cough)  Still have some stuck in my throat.  Yuck.

So I found this simple but delicious recipe and I did have to adjust it a little because I had 4 cups of seeds and I love butter and seasoned salt so but they were perfect! Some saying boil them & do this & do that... make your own recipe!

Great recipe! I did end up boiling the seeds in lt water to clean the pumpkin guts off the seeds. I boiled for about 5min.  I let dry for about an hour. I recommend you give the seeds  longer to dry. I tossed the seeds in melted butter and salt. I baked for 40min 300 degrees. 
NOTE: watch the seeds because they will burn. I could of took them out at 35minutes

Good recipe! Like other reviewers, I boiled the seeds in saltwater for 20 minutes first, let the seeds dry overnight, then toasted with olive oil and garlic salt on 300 for 30 minutes.

I cooked the seeds for roughly 40 mins and they came out far too crispy. I did toss them in butter and salt but just to add a kick, I sprinkled cayenne pepper. I would do less butter as well

These were awesome! The only difference I made was 1 Tbsp of butter, 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil and subbed seasoning salt and a dash of garlic salt.  I hope my family gets to try them before I eat them all!

I just rinsed with water and patted most of the water off, then added a little oil and garlic powder and salt, I then put them in the oven in a large deep fry pan because I had so many and baked at 350 degrees for about 30 to 45 minutes for each pan.  They were great.

Make these every year. My mom's recipe is similar to this. But we use a packet of hidden valley ranch mix instead of salt. Much more flavor!

This was so good. I never had dried in the oven pumpkin seeds and these are excellent. They taste like almonds when toasted. A keeper.

Pretty good. 2nd time around I read reviews & boiled the seeds in heavy salted water for about 10 minutes, blotted dry with a towel, shook them up in a large ziplock with about 2.5 tablespoons of butter, salt & garlic powder then cooked on 325 stirring every 10 minutes for about 30 minutes (desired readiness). Liked them better the 2nd time.

I cooked it with a little less seeds and forgot to cook it for less. They are good and I put cinnamon on them. I would make them again but a little more seeds.

Easy. Tasted great. The 45 minute cooking time was too long though. They nearly burned after 20 minutes. Every oven is different. I suggest checking and stirring every 15 minutes and adjusting accordingly.

Completely delicious! Butter is definitely better than olive oil. Pink himalayan saIt was divine. I stirred twice and left them in a few minutes extra. They were perfectly crispy. I'm thinking the addition of a distinctive herb or spice could take this to five stars.

I used ghee instead of butter.  This is the standard recipe that so many of us have been using for decades. Love it. Don't forget to rinse and dry your seeds first.

I roast pumpkin seeds every year. I liked the added butter. I let mine soak in salted water overnight then roast the next day. We do not like ours crunchy so I cut the time by 10 minutes.

This recipe is a great base for yummy crunchy seed deliciousness! I was making a soup from delicata squash, and the seeds toasted up perfectly with this recipe to be used as a crisp, salty soup topper! This will be my go-to way to use seeds from all my winter squash and gourds.

I used raw, shelled pumpkin seeds from the health food store, and soaked them overnight in water with 1 tsp salt.  After draining them,  I roasted them as the recipe instructs, with a little splash of Worcestershire sauce.  Lining the baking sheets with parchment paper really helps with clean up.  These are delicious!

I didn't make any changes and just followed the recipe....very good actually. Next time I will try some cayenne in it to spice it up a bit. Just as another person posted...try this recipe the way it is written...it is fool proof, then if you like....tweak away on your next batch.

Great basic recipe for those who prefer traditional roasted seeds. Oven temp and time were spot on. I shuffled mine every 15 minutes.  Now for the modifications: 1) I did 6 pumpkin's worth of seeds, approximately 8 cups; 2) 6 Tbs of melted butter and 1/3 cup Braggs; 3) all this fit on 2 cookie sheets which I roasted at the same time.  They turned out perfectly! Braggs provides a wonderful light, but thorough salty flavor, almost like soy sauce, but without all the sodium. The color is beautiful as well.

I'm new at this so I red many of the reviews first. I boiled them in salt water for about 20 min. and let them dry overnight. I mixed them in a bowl with melted butter and Lowry's seasoned salt. Baked at 300 for about 45 minutes. All I can say is "Wow!"

They were very yummy.. Usually we would just clean them, salt them and bake them in the oven. This time I added onion powder and black pepper baked for  30 minutes. My hubby had cleaned them the night before and put them in the fridge so there wasn't time to dry them out or a need to add oil or butter since they were wet. Now we want to buy a bunch of pumpkins on sale and have some more seeds!

My best yet! As per Martha Stewart, I left the seeds pulpy. Baked at 300 for 40 minutes, then vented the oven, turned the oven off and let them sit to get crispy, but not burned.

I tried this recipe including JOSCRAYM's suggestion to boil the seeds in salt prior to baking...they were delicious! I used a spiced salt and olive oil instead of butter. These were great. I'm going to try the butter next time to get a comparison.

In the fall and winter I always have my own blended pumpkin pie spice on hand. When we carve our Halloween pumpkin, I do the seeds, tossing some of my spice mixture in there and they're so good.

So many opinions-boil/don't boil. I decided to follow the recipe. I added garlic powder as the video suggested. They were beautifully done after 45 minutes at 300°.  They were crunchy, but not enough flavor. Even though they had been baked in garlic powder, I added cinnamon/sugar to half and they were delicious. I guess next time I will try boiling them in salted water to see if they are more flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad! Using the butter made them taste like popcorn though. I re-did the recipe with just vegetable oil spray and they came out much better!

It's good, I personally decided to touch it up with a bit more salt though, to bring out the flavour more :)

I used buttercup squash and spaghetti squash seeds.  Melted enough butter to coat, used seeds of @ black cardamom crushed and salt for spice.  YUM!  The butter vs EVOO is the key, which alot of recipes call for

45 min if you have lots of seeds. Most of mine got burnt after 30 min. Well, i didnt stir them. I also added some pepper to the seeds besides salt for zest. It was good...

I used salted butter and more than the recipe called for which I think is why my seeds didnt come out as good as everyone else's.  The seeds which were dried out toasted quite nicely but are extremely buttery and saltery.  If you like movie popcorn than this recipe for pumpkin seeds are for you.

Yum! OMG this was a great recipe! I added a bit of Parmesan Cheese a few minutes before they were done and reduced the temp to 275 instead of 300 and cooked for 60 minutes.

These were wonderful.  I did make a small change in that I boiled the seeds in very salty water until they were gray in color and then put them in a single layer on a cookie sheet in the oven @ 250 degrees for 30 min.  Then I prepared them as the recipe calls and baked them for an additional 30 minutes.  WONDERFUL!

I dunno - maybe I am not a pumpkin seed fan - too much work to get to the meat, and unlike some, I do not like to eat the shell.  I am giving 4 stars though because my children liked this one a lot (I had a lot of seeds, so I made some of this, some of the "Spiced Pumpkin Seeds" and some of the "Cinnasweet pumpkin Seeds."  This was ds7's favorite.)

Good basic recipe.  We tweaked it a little by adding more spice - garlic, salt and pepper.

Mmmm! I left the seeds unrinsed and added the butter and salt. Threw them in the oven and they came out perfect!

We love these!  Very easy recipe with great results. I recommend boiling to clean and blanch the seeds prior to cooking and half the salt.  I adore salt and it was still a little much.

Excellent recipe! I used sea salt and pretty much doubled everything for extra flavor.  Started with baking at the original temp and time - was just not crisp enough so upped it to 350 for another 20 minutes and added more salt - ended up perfect!!

Doubled the sauce (butter, W sauce and season all salt instead of regular salt)  I wound up using an 8x11 glass baking dish.  Cooked at 275 for about an hour and a half....good stuff, this will become a tradition in our house now.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is perfect. Simple! Who doesn't love simple. The only thing I did was add some garlic salt. No Drying overnight or boiling or soaking. What a hassle! My seeds came out wonderful, and are oh so addicting! Enjoy :)

Quick and easy! The best way to cook pumpkin seeds when you're dealing with 6 pumpkins worth of seeds! My changes are to not really measure the butter and instead of salt I use season salt, a little garlic powder and just a hint of creole seasoning. I also baked them for about an hour or so but my oven's temp is a bit lower than it reads. They turned out light and just enough flavor to enhance the pumpkin without taking over it!

I think I used olive oil instead of butter and dried them overnight first.  Stirred every 15 minutes.  Watch time - I used 275 degrees and took 45 min since dried first.

This was a super easy recipe and the seeds came out great! Next time I'm going to try adding cinnamon like others suggested. THANKS!
