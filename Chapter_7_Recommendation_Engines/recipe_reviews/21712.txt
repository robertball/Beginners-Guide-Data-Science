Chocolate can be a mystery, so Here is a tip to keep your chocolate from becoming too thick. When you are melting over a double boiler, don't let the water touch the bottom of your upper pan.  Heat until only 1/2 of the chocolate is melted, then remove from heat and stir gently until it is all melted.  The chocolate should actually be cool or tepid to the touch.  If it's hot, chances are it will sieze up and thicken.  If it does that, no amount of heating or stiring will fix it.

Sooooo Good! I am giving one dozen of these to my Mother and Father in law for their 9th anniversary. I am on a fixed budget and it only cost me $4.50 to make these - No Kidding! $2.50 for Strawberries (18), and the chocolate (milk & white) was on sale for $1.00 a bag each! They look gorgeous and taste even better. I also used a small crock pot instead of a double boiler which worked out well. I dipped the strawberries in milk chocolate, let them cool in the fridge for approx. 15 minutes and then took a toothpick, dipped it in white chocolate and strung it over the milk chocolate. AWESOME!!! Check out the photo!

Just FYI:  Chocolate chips come in 11.5 ounce bags now.  I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate and I did not use shortening, but butter (a little less than 2 T due to smaller bag of chips).  Since chocolate burns easily and then gets hard and globby (even in the microwave), it is good to get the water in the double-boiler actually boiling, melt the butter (or shortening) first, and then add the chocolate so everything is nice and toasty warm for it to gently melt.  If you don't have a double-boiler, try using a regular pot, get the water boiling in it, then use a smaller pot to rest in the big one to melt the butter & choc chips.  These are really tasty.  Thank you!

I've been making chocolate covered strawberries for awhile, and the key is proper tempering and good chocolate. You shouldn't need to add anything at all to the melted chocolate -not even butter or shortening. It detracts from the the flavor of the chocolate. One of the best types of chocolate around is Callebaut -it's superb, and you can find it online. I have found that the higher quality the chocolate is, the better consistency it has for dipping when tempered. Tempering requires a lengthy explanation, but Allrecipes has an excellent article on how to do it here: http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Tempering-Chocolate/Detail.aspx 

Trust me, you *will* notice the difference between properly tempered chocolate and non-tempered chocolate.

Awesome!  I've never made these before because I assumed that they would be very difficult and time-consuming, but these were very simple.  I used an 11.5 oz. bag of milk chocolate chips and slightly less than 2 Tbsp. of shortening and they turned out perfectly. I don't own a double boiler so I microwaved the chocolate chips and shortening in a glass bowl (about 2-3 minutes at 70% power) and used the toothpicks and styrofoam idea, which worked very well.  I dipped 30 medium to large-sized strawberries and still had quite a bit of the chocolate mixture left over.  I'm sure that I could have dipped at least 10 more strawberries.  Also, be sure that the strawberries are thoroughly dry so that the chocolate will stick properly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are great!!  Very easy!!  This makes ample chocolate for dipping, so you could dip a few bananas or extra strawberries (I had a lot of chocolate sauce left over.)  Next time, I think I'll use semi-sweet chocolate instead of the milk chocolate - I think it would taste even better.
I was unsure of how far to dip the strawberries (all the way to the top?), but I saw a picture of dipped strawberries in a magazine, and they had only dipped the strawberries half-way to the top, with white chocolate drizzled in zig-zags across the chocolate.  Beautiful!! Since strawberries are known to be grown with a lot of pesticides, I rinsed the strawberries first with a veggie wash, but I was careful not to bruise them, and I let them drain on paper towels until they were thoroughly dry so the chocolate would adhere properly. Any moisture would have interfered with the chocolate adhering.  Thanks for this great recipe!!  So easy, yet so beautiful.

I used a regular pot on the stove and melted the 2 T. of shortening first and then added an 11.5 oz. pkg. of Guittard milk chocolate chips.  It melted up very smooth!  I stuck toothpicks in the (dry) strawberries, dipped them in the chocolate, and then placed them in upside down plastic strainers/colanders with small holes.  They worked really well and the strawberries were very tasty!

I LOVE making chocolate covered strawberries, especially for Valentine's Day.  Over the years I've learned to add a little kick to them.  Here are my little secrets - 1) I use semi-sweet chocolate and definitely drizzle the white chocolate over for a beautiful effect; 2) SPIKE THEM! - and here's how... Fill a syringe with a sweet white dessert wine, like a nice Reisling, and slowly inject the wine into the strawberries from near the stem (after you've done the dipping in chocolate.)  You want to inject enough wine to saturate the berries, but watch not to add too much otherwise they end up becoming runny.  These are always a hit when I bring them to dinner parties and of course when treating my husband to a romantic dinner at home.  Enjoy!

These were an excellent, easy and elegant dessert that we really loved. Like some others, I omitted the shortening and did not miss it. I also found that 12 ounces of Ghiradelli Dark Chocolate (or "bittersweet") chips was good for 2 pounds of strawberries.  I also just dipped the berries,let the excess chocolate drip off, and placed them on a wax paper lined cookie sheet in the refrigerator for about 4 hours until I was ready to serve them.  (The chocolate hardened in about 30 minutes.) I still had a little bit of chocolate left, so I drizzled it over pretzel sticks and put them in the refrigerator to harden. Once the chocolate was set, I put them in a zip lock bag to enjoy later. We will definitely make these strawberries again and again.

These were fantastic!!! My suggestion is to melt the shortening before adding the chocolate. The 1st batch I made I didnâ€™t do this and it stayed clumpy. These were a huge hit at my party. Nobody could believe that they were homemade. I even used the store brand choc. Chips. Easy to make, highly recommended!!!

Forget the double boiler. Put the chocolate/shortening in the microwave. Zap it for 30 seconds. Stir. Zap it for 30 more seconds. Done. Dip your berries. This recipe covered 30 healthy-sized berries for me. Enjoy!

A good rule of thumb to remember is 1 Tablespoon of shortening for every 1 Cup of chocolate chips. I used semi-sweet chips. 

I decorated the berries with 1/3 Cup melted white chips. I put the melted chips in a ziploc bag, poked a hole in one of the corners and squeezed the chocolate onto the berries. Mmmmm!

Chocolate + Strawberries is always a good combination.  Five stars from me; didn't use the shortening and it turned out fine.  A lot of people mentioned microwaving the chocolate chips.  Yes, that gets the job done, but consider using a heat-safe bowl in a pan of water on the stove (at medium low heat).  This is a good thing for three reasons.  1, the chocolate is melted at much more even pace, creating a creamier consistency.  2, you have to stir the chocolate constantly on the stove, making it much harder to burn than in a microwave.  3, by using the chocolate from the bowl (which is in the hot water) the chocolate retains a lot of the heat, and doesn't cool off (get clumpy) as fast.  

Remember all - the gist of this recipe is melted chocolate.  Use it everything - pretzels, other fruit, oreo cookies, big marshmallows.  Don't forget you can dip the chocolate creation in just about anything as well - graham cracker crumbs, crushed up cookies, sprinkles, nuts, coconut... the possibilities are endless. Have fun with this one!

Delicious! NOTE: The shortening makes it shiny! If you are eating it for yourself, don't bother. However, if you are presenting it or giving it to someone, add in the shortening - it does make a difference! ALSO: If using white chocolate, DO NOT add shortening. Also do it in small amount multiple times, because it solidifies so much quicker than normal chocolate.

This recipe is amazing and these strawberries were the hit of my mom's 80th birthday party. Be sure that your strawberries are really sweet - tasteless, pithy ones will just taste like chocolate. But ripe, sweet strawberries coupled with chocolate are an unbeatable combination. My sister and I made nearly 100 of these in less than 30 minutes. A few tricks that we found helpful: (1) have a large piece of styrofoam ready, and just dip the strawberry and put the end of the toothpick into the styrofoam. This allows the chocolate to set quickly and to look perfect. (2) Use medium-sized strawberries. Large ones are just too unruly to dip and eat. It's nice to be able to eat the strawberry and chocolate in just one or two bites. (3) We used Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips because it's what we had on hand. But it was a nice balance with the sweetness of the berry. Milk chocolate may have been too sweet. (4) We just melted the chocolate in the microwave and then set the bowl in a larger bowl of very hot water. Then we just kept adding more hot water from the kettle every few minutes to keep the chocolate perfect for dipping. This was our first time to try this recipe (and my sister doesn't cook at all) and it turned out amazingly!!!

I am wondering how you got the strawberries to stay on the toothpick when dipping!!! Every time I tried this, the srtawberry was so heavy, when I dip it in the chocolate, it falls off the toothpick and into the double boiler!!! I ended up just holding then end and getting chcolate all over my fingers and leaving the berries on wax paper to dry. I was just making them for fun so the appearance didn't have to impress anyone!

I have always made these using a chocolate ganache, with chocolate chips and heavy cream, but I found this works equally as well.  Gorgeous, and so easy "even a cave man can do it!" Finishing them by drizzling melted white chocolate over them only makes them that much more beautiful.  The only challenge is finding the prettiest, jumbo strawberries which, in my market anyway, is usually and unfortunately only around the holidays.

TIP: after thoroughly washing/rinsing strawberries, place them in a colander to drain and then carefully dry each one completely (I use paper towels and blot gently), being sure to leave the green leaves intact (they look pretty on the dipped strawberries). Any water or moisture that gets into the melted chocolate will cause it to become crumbly and unusable. 
I also melt a variety of chocolates. Besides milk chocolate, I melt semi-sweet and dark. These can be layered dipped. Lay cooled dipped strawberries on parchment paper lined tray and put in fridge for a bit to harden. If you put them in the fridge while the chocolate is warm, they will bead up with moisture causing them to become soggy when you take them out. 
If you want them to be extra festive, you can add various and colourful sprinkles or chopped nuts to them before the chocolate sets up.  Chocolate dipped strawberries are one of my fave indulgences and are actually not at all difficult to make. ENJOY!

I melt my chocolate in a mini crock. temp is just about perfect. As to cooling them... Turn your collander upside down and put the toothpicks in the holes. great way to serve at a party as well.

I first off want to say that these turned out absolutely perfect. And its thanks to the wonderful reviewers on here, so thanks everyone who does helpful reviews. These are some of the things I garnered from all your suggestions that worked wonderfully:
I didnt have shortening, someone suggested canola oil, used that, the chocolate hardened, but not to the point of breaking off first bite, it was perfect.
I used the micro, someone said to make sure I stir every 20 secs or so, so as not to burn, so thats what I did, and it melted to a perfect consistancy (I made the mistake last time I tried these , without having looked on here first, and I burned the chocolate, of course..lol).
I used white chocolate (yummmmm).
I used cold, dry berries, the chocolate was already hardening on them before I even finished the batch.
I did the decorative drizzle with a ziplock, but I used milk choc for the drizzle. Looked so pretty too.
I didnt follow any measurements, I did it by eyeing it, and I used 4 squares of choc (about 4 oz), approx 1 tsp of canola oil, and about 18 good sized strawberries. 
It was such a simple but awesome recipe, I'll be making again and again.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I didn't have a double boiler, but I just used a regular saucepan and made sure I was constantly stirring to avoid scorching the chocolate. Also, I added 2 tablespoons of Nutella to the chocolate for an even more delicious hazelnut flavour. For Valentine's day, I made these for my husband and added valentine's heart sprinkles to the chocolate before it hardened.

For everyone that doesn't have a double boiler- you can easily make one with a saucepan and a glass or metal bowl. Just put abut an inch of water in your saucepan, let it come to a boil. Then set your bowl(must be bigger than the top of pan) on top of that~ and Voila! A double boiler!

The recipe was perfect as-is.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave and used the leaves to hold the strawberries while dipping.  Parchment paper works great for a non-stick cooling surface.  As a tip, DO NOT store the strawberries in an air-tight Tupperware container or the moisture from the strawberries will melt the chocolate and wilt your strawberries.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! I cut out the shortening all together, it was completely unnecessary. I rolled some of the dipped berries in sprinkles and some in ground nuts! YUM!!

I made these for a 4th of July party. I put the strawberries on bamboo skewers, dipped them in the chocolate and placed the skewered berries into a flowerpot stuffed with green leaf lettuce. The lettuce looked like leaves of flowers and the strawberries looked like rosebuds. Everyone was very impressed.

I have been making these for years - but NEVER did the upside down styrofoam thing - WOW - THANK YOU! My chocolate covered strawberries have never looked better!
One side note: For people who have trouble melting the white chocolate - use LESS heat! THe hotter it is the more it will stay solid and lumpy!
ENJOY

Some more tips for making these lovely berries:  
1. Pick strawberries with lovely green leaves, if possible.  
2. Wash the strawberries carefully.  
3. Place them on paper towels to dry.  If, after they are dry, you notice any "red" left over on the paper towel, sit these berries to the side for "practice" or "test" berries:  if the skin is bruised or broken they will continue to let the juice out and weaken the integrity of the chocolate after they are dipped.  These are the ones that you can practice on and test (eat!).  
4. Make sure the berries are absolutely dry or the chocolate will not set well.
5. You can use a toothpick, as mentioned, OR you can pull the leaves straight up and use them as a handle.  This will get them out of the way of the chocolate (who wants chocolate leaves lol).  Dip and rotate so that the chocolate covers the berry 2/3 to 3/4 to the top.  Lay them on one of the "flat" sides (on a waxed paper surface) to set. 
6.  To assure that the chocolate adheres well AND hardens quickly, you can chill you berries briefly in the fridge or freezer until the surface is cold.  Just don't leave them in that environment too long or the berries will start to "sweat" as they return to room temperature and, well, you've got that problem of chocolate on a "wet" berry again.  
7.  You can dip them again, if you like...but be aware that the harder and thicker the chocolate shell, the more likely the chocolate will break and fall off the berries with each bite.

These were so easy and fun to make!  We used semi-sweet mini morsels because that is what we had on hand.  I don't have a double boiler so we melted 1/2 bag (6 oz) of the chips and about 2 tsp. crisco in a glass measuring cup in the microwave.  I heated it on high for 30 seconds stirred and heated again on high for only about 15 more seconds.  Stirred it well and that melted it perfectly.  We used wooden scewers and stood them in a tall glass to hold them.  Melting the chocolate in a narrow container made it really easy to dip the strawberries.  This made about 16 medium size strawberries.  Great recipe....thanks so much!

This recipe is so easy but it tastes like a million dollars.  I used nestle's chocolatier dark chocolate without adding anything to it, I just followed the melting directions on the bag and it worked out great.  I melted white chocolate, put it in a plastic baggie, and drizzled it over the chocolate strawberries.  I dipped bananas and pound cake into the left over chocolate and those were delicious as well.  Everyone was asking me where I bought the chocolate covered strawberries!!!

These were super easy and quick.  When making these make sure to leave the stems on. I took mine off and regreted it.  Also it helps if you put them in the freezer for about 8 min before dipping them.  As they are firmer and the toothpick won't slide out as easy.  Hope that helps.

I don't like milk chocolate because it tastes like milk instead of chocolate.  I used high quality chocolate with more than 70% cocoa, (which is also much smoother) and added 2 Tbls of Organic Virgin Coconut oil.  They were fabulous!

De-lish!  Super simple and quick too.  Use room temperature berries and then keep them at room temp prior to serving or they will "sweat" and not look as pretty!

Oh, yummy!!  I had really good results with this recipe and it was not time consuming by any means.  I bought a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips and only used about 3/4 of it. I don't have a double boiler, so I zapped my shortening and chocolate chips (Hershey's) in the microwave.  I added a splash of vanilla extract to the melted chocolate. I wanted to add some raspberry syrup, but didn't have any.  Anyway, they turned out beautifully and with my leftover chocolate...I dipped some pretzels in it. Thanks Kitten.

Thank you. Very simple- I had no problems. I did make sure my strawberries were very dry before dipping. I used white choc. and then dip the tips in blue sugar for the 4th of July- a huge hit by adults and kids alike (idea from Family Fun Magazine).

Simply excellent.  The shortening gives the chocolate a silkiness that chocolate-only lacks.  Someone made the suggestion to not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl the chocolate is in to prevent seizing and that is important advice.  If you don't own a double-boiler, just heat water in a regular pot and place a metal mixing bowl over the top.  Melting chocolate in the microwave is a short-cut that rarely has good results.  The stove-top method is very easy... I put the water on to boil and once boiling, reduced to simmer and the chocolate was perfect for the entire session.  Dip your pretzel, cookie or fruit, shaking carefully to get rid of excess chocolate and roll in sprinkles or crushed peppermints if desired.  Wonderful recipe!

This is perfect.  I don't have a double boiler so I just use a smaller bowl inside of a pot of boiling water.  A tip though...you have to be quick with this.  Start dipping as soon as the chocolate melts and keep whisking now and then to smooth it.  You can also put the leftover chocolate in the microwave for quick dipping.  Works fine.  I LOVE it.

Make sure not to make these the day ahead, or the chocolate shell will start falling off. Also, dry the strawberries before trying to dip. These were made for a party, and looked great dipped in semisweet chocolate with white chocolate drizzled over top.

This was my first time making chocolate covered strawberries and I feel like I am a pro now - I will never lose this recipe.  I think that the key is the quality of chocolate that you use (I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips, this made it a bit more expensive but SO worth it).  I love the Mcgyver-toothpick on styrofoam trick - made for some pretty strawberries - withough the large clump on the side that you get from allowing them to dry on their side.  One recommendation: When you are dipping the berries, hold the leafs back -because when they get covered in chocolate, the people that eat them get the leafs in their bite of strawberry - yuk. I think that the criso made all of the difference-made the chocolate melt like silk. Would have loved to have used long-stemmed strawberries but those are so hard to fine these days.  Made my own double boiler for these (does anyone actually OWN a double boiler??)  by placing a mixing bowl on top of a pot.  I did milk and white choc strawberrries - and did a drzzle by putting the melted chocolate into a ziploc and cutting off the tip-add canola oil to the chocolate to make it more liquid and easy to drizzle.

Wow!  I was amazed at how easy it is to make chocolate covered strawberries.  To buy a dozen of already made one's will cost you $20 - $25.  I spent less than $5, and they came out great!  The only comments I have are that the amount of chocolate called for in the recipe will be more than enough for a pound of strawberries.  Next time I'll use an 8oz bag of chips.

Prep was easy.  I setup the styrofoam cups first on a cookie sheet, put the toothpicks in the berries so once I got to dipping, it would go quickly.  Also drizzled a small amount of white chocolate over the finished product, which the cookie sheet came in handy for.  It takes about 15 minutes for the chocolate to harden.

THINGS NOT TO DO: first we were melting witenagemot chocolate for the strawberries. We put it in a microwave and stirred every thirty seconds. Don't do this because it'll burn!!! Then we put the same chocolate into a home made double boiler only to realize that the pits can't touch. 

So now we added some oil to it so then it doesn't stick as much and are melting it. Hopes it will go smoother with the other chocolates! Overall, this recipe was great! Delicious!

Lumping problem hint:  Your strawberries must not have been fully dry.  Even a little bit of water into melted chocolate will cause it to seize.  Just add water a little bit at a time and keep stiring, it will become smooth again.

Forget the double boiler and crock pot and use your microwave!...I put my chips, or baking squares, or chopped up leftover easter bunnies from the freezer with the shortening in a pyrex on MED for 1 minute.  I stir and then put back in on MED for 30-60 seconds, depending on the thickness of the chunks.  It will be lumpy, but the pyrex will still be warm.  Continue stirring until the rest of the chocolate melts.  Also I put them straight into small cupcake liners and serve them that way.  These are great and always yeild rave reviews.  Good luck.

One trick I want to pass on about the drizzled white chocolate -- melt the white chocolate and with a fork, dip the fork into the chocolate and move your hand back and forth to make artistic designs.  Very unique look and you don't need to pipe the chocolate over the strawberries.

OMG I love Godiva chocolate covered strawberries, but they're so expensive, so I wanted to make my own, and these were great, instead of using a boiler, I put them in a microwave save dish and added the amount of veg oil required on the directions to melt them, and instead of using the styrofoam I layed them on wax paper and put them in the refridgerator for about 30 mins, I made a variety using coconuts and nuts and white chocolate

Well I love dark chocolate. I used 8oz Ghiradelli  semi-sweet and 8 oz Ghiradelli  60% bitter-sweet mixed.  Didn't use the shortening, but 2 tablespoons of organic coconut milk/cream instead.  Coconut milk like that is a paste or Crisco/shortening type out of the can.  Worked great.

I used semisweet chocolate chips instead and they were just as good. Very fast and easy to make. They looked just like the ones at godiva where I also drizzled melted white chocolate on top. Don't worry about the toothpicks method of drying. Even if you just lay them on wax paper they still come out looking great. To prevent the chocolate from getting hard and burnt when melting make sure you melt them at 1 minute intervals at power 5 or medium power, not high. Some people question adding shortening but the shortening actually gives the chocolate a smoother and glossier texture as well as softens it a little to make dipping easier. Good luck.

Chocolate dipped strawberries are so easy to make yet never fail to impress! I made some for my friend's birthday party and everybody couldn't keep their hands off it. Wonderful recipe! 

One question though: how do you prevent the chocolate from lumping? My melted chocolate quickly developed lumps before I even finished dipping all the strawberries!

Easy and elegant.  I found that halving the recipe was easily enough for a pint of berries.  Tried it with milk, semi-sweet, and white chocolate pieces and all turned out wonderfully.  Try to make these same day as they will be served if possible, though they keep fine overnight in the refrigerator they do start to "juice" if able to react with the sugar in the chocolate for too long.

Excellent!  Easy to work with...  My daughter asked for them for her school birthday treat.  Definately use the shortening for a smoother consistancy and a shinier presentation.  I tried them with and without.  It was easier to work with when shortening was used as well.

What a great, easy, fun recipe!  I used a pkg of milk chocolate chips and almost 1 T of shortening.  I melted the shortening in the microwave for about 30 seconds to melt it, then added the chocolate chips.   I cooked it on 70% power for 1 minute then stirred it and it was perfect.  I loved the toothpick on styrofoam idea!  I used the leftover chocolate to dip animal crackers for the kids.  Thanks for this recipe!

I served these for my husband's 25th birthday party, and they were excellent.  I used an old trick to melt the chocolate.  Put a glass bowl on the hot plate of the coffee pot, and the chocolate will melt beautifully without scorching!  This recipe's chocolate sets nicely without the mess of parafin.

I had to make these on-camera for a video thing, and they were actually easy peasy! Of course it all starts with the strawberry. Taste one and make sure it's good all by itself, because chocolate can only do so much. The other thing I learned is dry your strawberries before you dip them so the chocolate can stick to the fruit. You're welcome.

This recipe is so simple and easy to do. After asking questions to different people I was told the vegetable shortening would ruin the recipe, and that it smells bad. So what I did was I bought 2 bags of Dove milk chocolate's and 3 pints of strawberries.  I didn't have a double boiler so I used a pan of water and a large Corning bowl. I put a couple of inches of water in the pan and brought to a simmer, while it was simmering I opened the Dove chocolate's and put them in the bowl, after I had them all opened I placed the bowl on top of the simmering water. It only took a few minutes for the chocolate's to melt, after the chocolate was melted and I thought at the right consistancy I took the bowl off of the water and dipped the strawberries. (A chef told me you should never let the chocolate get more than 99 degrees) so I just eyeballed it to make sure it didn't get to hot. I placed wax paper on a platter and dipped the strawberries in the chocolate and just layed them on the platter, after filling a platter I put them in the freezer to quick cool them and I started the next platter. Before starting the next platter I re-warmed the chocolate, then when the second platter was done I put it in the freezer and put the first one in the refridgerator. These strawberries turned out absolutely perfect, they were beautiful and delicious! Next time I will take the other's advice and melt the white chocolate and drizzle over the the milk chocolate dipped strawberries. The recipe is quic

These couldn't be simpler.  I have tried to make them before by just melting chocolate chips, but they tend to melt too easily again.  These set up much better than my previous attempt.  I have also dipped fresh peach slices (you have to dry them very well first though.)

Didn't use any shortening and it worked out great! Didn't measure the temperature either - I melted 90% of the chocolate in a double boiler and when it was melted I added 10% of the chocolate OFF the double boiler. I then let the chocolate sit to cool off a tad and dipped the strawberries! Perfect!

I made these for the 1st time today, I'm very happy with the results. I don't have a dbl. boiler, so I microwaved the chips at 50%-60% pwr. I was afraid to burn the chocolate, so I didn't get it as melted as I would have liked, but oh well. They don't look perfect, but I didn't have that kind of time anyways, they taste amazing and that's what counts! I also injected half of them with pineapple rum and let me tell you.... HOLY COW THEY ARE AMAZING! LOL. I think I'll be keeping that tray at our table for us, hahaha. I made these for my Husband's company picnic.

I just want to say i was scared to death to try this.  I have never worked with chocolate before. Unless you count adding chocolate chips to a cookie recipee! This was super easy! It was time consuming to dip each strawberry but super easy! I did follow the advice of one reviewer and didn't let the water touch the bottom of the double boiler. I will be making these again....and again....and again!

Great & simple dessert for any occasion...or a special family dinner treat! I use either a 1/2 & 1/2 combo of dark & milk chocolate candy melting wafers or just dark wafers and melt slowly in microwave. I wash the berries, place them on paper towels, and leave them to dry for at least 2 hours before dipping. When dipping, I hold by their stems and dip, wipe excess on bottom w/a butter knife, then place on wax paper to harden. As mentioned, they can be decorated with white chocolate (or dip 1/2 in dark then when dry, dip other 1/2 in white wafers) and nuts.

These were so easy to make and SO good! I used both white and milk choc. chips. I dipped the berries in the white first, then in the milk leaving a border of white at the top....looked so nice! I also dipped some in milk choc. and then drizzled the white over them....what a presentation...many compliments! I had a TON of chocolate left over, so next time I will use 8 oz. of chips/1 TBSP shortening for 1 lb. of berries. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested using a pyrex bowl to make a double boiler...worked great! Wonderful recipe!!

I make chocolate covered strawberries all the time and i do not like useing shortening or a double broiler. So here is how i do it (SUPER easy and NO shortening/double broiler): in a glass bowel i put a bag of chocolate chips (I prefer Giridelli milk or dark chocolate) and put it into the microwave for 30 sec at a time- stirring well every 30 sec until all smooth. Dip the strawberries (as described in directions) and put them in the frig until set! I also like to drizzle with white chocolate- I melt it the same way as described above and with a fork dip it into the melted white chocolate and with a "snapping wrist" motion drizzle the chocolate covered strawberries! MMMM i hope this helps someone! Enjoy!! :o)

This was an excellent recipe. I made this for a pot luck and everyone raved over it. I knew this was a good recipe when my husband (who is not a chocolate lover) went back for 2nds. I made copies and gave it to everyone.  I melted some white chocolate, took a fork and drizzled that over the chocolate. They looked so elegant.   I dried mine on wax paper instead of inserting toothpicks and placing in styrofoam. I liked the wax paper because it made the drizzling of the white chocolate easier.

Love these!  First weekend for strawberry pickin' so you gotta do some with chocolate.  I melted dark chocolate and white chocolate almond bark.  Didn't use the shortening.  I did half dipped in dark and half with the almond bark.  After sticking in the freezer for 10 minutes, drizzled remaining chocolate on berries.  I didn't have any strawberries left!  I used my leftover chocolate by laying out dry roasted peanuts on waxed paper and drizzling both chocolates of the peanuts until set...YUM!

PERFECT BASE RECIPE!!  I used semi-sweet choc. and white choc.  I also used the microwave at 70% power for 2-3 min. -- much easier than a double boiler!!!  (Wash, dry, and chill strawberries first.) I made about 50 or so of these for my nephew and for a party, and had zero left.  I used toothpicks to drizzle the white choc. over the dark, then drew straight lines across the white chocolate for that professional look.  Thanks!!!

This was great!  For an extra twist, and a more appealing visual effect, dip the strawberries in white chocolate first.  When hard, dip them in the milk chocolate, but don't cover all of the white.  The effect of seeing the red of the strawberry, then white, then milk chocolate is beautiful.

I used some white chocolate as well to decorate mine like tuxedo's. They were so cute for N.Y.'s eve and made a great impression. I think overall, that I prefer a ganache coating on strawberries, flavor wise and for other reasons. Don't make these too far ahead as the sugar reacts with the berry, which begins to change the flavor and cause 'weeping'. Best quality, fresh berries are a must.

I prefer a more bitter chocolate with the sweet of the strawberries, so I used Semi-sweet chips instead, but had great results! I also made some red, white and blue ones for our weekend bbq - everyone loved them!

The oil makes the chocolate shiny and not greasy at all, so the strawberries look so much prettier; Just cut the oil in half or so, if you'd like.  I always use the microwave, a minute or so at first, then in 10-second intervals until slightly softened...perfect every time.  You certainly don't need expensive chocolate for them to taste delicious, Nestles is good enough!  Do you think the kids notice or even care? I would rather have a good quality sweet strawberry.  Certain desserts or candy require a quality chocolate, but not these.  By the way, white chocolate is very difficult to melt without oil, since it is not really chocolate at all.

Made these for fathers day with big giant lucious strawberries just picked. Washed and dried them and used milk choc chips and two tablespoons of shortening. Put them in the microwave for one minute. Took it out and whisked it and it was ready!!! they came out wonderful. used some Wilton White chips and melted them and made stripes with a toothpick. TIP: when melting chocolate it can never ever come in contact with water. make sure your bowl is dry, your whisk is dry and if you sample a lick, USE A New spoon!!! It will turn it rock hard and you cannot recover. Did over 30 HUGE ones and still had some left for banannas and grapes. EXCELLENT recipe. I have also used this to coat half a butter cookie and add sprinkles to the wet choc.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I used semi-sweet chips, my personal preference. I make my own double boiler with a metal bowl over simmering water. I kept some of the chips out and stirred them in after removing the bowl from the pan. This makes the chocolate the right temperature for dipping right away. I ran out of strawberries and used apricots and marshmallows to use up the chocolate. Delicious!

Awesome recipe.  I'm not very creative, but my platter looked picture perfect. Had to substitute 1T olive oil for the shortening (didn't realize that stuff went bad).  Otherwise followed recipe exactly.  THANKS!!

Excellent recipe, similar to my own.  I do not own a double boiler, but I do have a pot and a metal bowl... I boil the water in the pot and have the metal bowl inside.  Always works for me.  Instead of shortening I use a small amount of milk (until the mixture is homogeneous, yet not too liquid-y).  You can substitute the milk for Baileys to give it a different kick...

Didn't have shortening, so I used 2 TBSP butter as one reviewer suggested.  Don't have a double broiler, so I melted on low heat.  As one reviewer suggested, I kept the heat on low as I dipped, but only got 20 strawberries done before the chocolate started hardening (maybe my strawberries still had a bit of moisture on them, even though I towel dried each one).  I was afraid I'd have to throw out the rest of the chocolate.  But, I took the pan off the heat and stirred desperately, and the sauce softened up.  I was able to finish dipping.  I got almost 100 strawberries (4 lbs) covered with one recipe of chocolate sauce!

Alright, everyone else gave 5 stars but ...was way too much chocolate for 1lb strawberries could've easlisy dipped another pound or more. Also why the shortning? To make it soft? I usually just melt the choc and dip no added ingreds and its fine but hard. So I tried this and after they cooled the grease from the shortning had beaded on the top leaving an unattractive slick. I used hersheys semi sweet chocolate. Next time I will decrease the shortning to less than a tablespoon.

We did not have a double boiler, so we made one. We got one larger pot, filled it with water and placed a smaller pot inside of the larger pot. It turned out just perfect. Yum Yum...make sure you stir constantly!

Delicious and easy to make but they take quite a bit longer than 15 mins. to prepare.  Also, I used closer to 2 lbs. of strawberries.  The foam idea was a good one.  Also, be sure your berries are completely dry before coating or the chocolate is harder to stay on.

This is a very good recipe, but I have worked with chocolate for many years and the amount of chocolate listed here is too much for the amount of shortening.  The darker the chocolate, the more shortening or paraffin is needed to make and keep it smooth.  The strawberries must be clean, dry, and room temperature before starting.

Delicious and simple. I followed the recipe and used milk chocolate chips, but next time will use dark chocolate. Unfortunately, I put the leftovers in tupperware and refrigerated but the next day were soggy and covered in condensation so I threw them away.

What more could I possibly add to this wonderful recipe? Just allow plenty of time making them. They are always so elegant looking, to say nothing of the wonderful taste.

So easy! They came out great! Nice and smooth! I didn't have a double boiler so I followed the advise already noted about melting them half-way and then removing the pan from the heat source. It was great. 16 oz of chips was plenty for about 2 dozen medium sized strawberries. I will use this recipe again and again!

i did what some other reviews said and used butter for the shortening.  i used 1 tb of butter to about 8 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips to 1 lb of strawberries.  i melted the butter in the double boiler first then added the chips. melted this until smooth and still cool.  then dipped, washed and very dry strawberries in.  this turned out beautiful and tasted great.  thank you for the recipe!

You can't go wrong with this recipe. For perfect consistency, remove the pot from the heat when about 2/3 of the chips have melted, and stir to blend in the rest. I prefer semisweet but the kids just love milk chocolate. I always serve with fresh whipped cream...YUM!

DELICIOUS!!  What is better than chocolate covered strawberries?  I made these for Valentine's Day, and used the HUGE strawberries with the long stems on them.  I used dark chocolate and they were so good!  You would pay a fortune for these in the stores...why do that when you can make your own. Also, I have made them without the shortening and honestly they are just as good.

These came out great! I didn't use the styrofoam, but I did let them cool on walx paper. I used 3/4 bag of semi sweet chips and around 2 tablespoons of shortening. I also added a teaspoon of Kahlua once the chips had melted. Afterwards i put some white choclate and shortening in a ziplock and then microwaved it for about a minute. I let it cool and then did some criss cross designs with the white chocolate. I agree with a previous post - let the white chocolate cool before adding it to the other chocolate or else you will have a mess. In my opinion the microwvae works just as well, but you have to be patient. Check on it every 15 seconds and stir it so the chocolate doesn't burn.

Such a simple recipe but it makes you look like you really did something special! Try to get the most ripe, flavorful berries you can. Putting the dipped berries on a sheet of waxed paper is simple and the flat spot is no big deal. One note of caution, the chocolate can freeze up and turn solid and grainy if you let any water or other moisture in it while you're melting it (including condensation from a cover). The shortening is supposed to help prevent that, but it can still happen.

Anyone who doesn't have a double boiler. The best way to keep the chocolate hot is a crock pot. Just keep it on low.

Easy to make and very tasty!  I had so much chocolate sauce left over though, it would be wise to double up on the strawberries, dip frozen bananas or pretzels.

I couldn't even manage a makeshift double boiler, so I melted the chips on low heat.  It worked fine.  I skipped the toothpicks and just held the berries by the stem for dipping and placed them on a cookie sheet.  The chocolate coating stayed on the berries well.  The tasted great and were fun and easy to make.

This is the best dessert I have made in a long time!  It's easy and absolutely delicious.  Perfect for chocoholics like myself!  My husband and I anjoyed them on Valentine's Day with a glass of wine.  If you can, double-dip them for that added kick of chocolate!

Really easy to prepare chocolate using a double boiler. I usually microwave my chocolate and it ends up quite hot. The chocolate was warm/cool after its bout in the double boiler. 

Used bittersweet chocolate and shortening. The chocolate was shiny when it hardened, shinier than when using butter. 

I ran out of space in the plastic colander I was using as a stand for the toothpicked-strawberries, so I used an egg carton (with the eggs intact to weigh it down). After the chocolate hardened, I microwaved a small handful of white chocolate morsels. A sliver of shortening made the chocolate 'drippy' enough, spooned it into a snack baggie, cut a hole, place berries on wax paper and drizzle.

These are delicious! I like to make one batch of milk chocolate strawberries and another batch of dark chocolate ones mmm

Based on the other comments, here are some useful tips:

Use half milk chocolate chips (or dark) and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. 
Use 1T of shortening instead of 2.
Make sure the strawberries are completely dry before dipping them in the chocolate. 
The chocolate shouldn't be too hot, so take the bowl off of the heat when the chocolate chips have been mostly melted
Use 2 toothpicks when dipping bigger strawberries.
Lay the strawberries on wax paper and place them in the refrigerator.

These were awesome and so easy to make!  They were a huge hit at my party.  I didn't have a piece of styrofoam so I used an empty egg carton!  I will definitely make these again.

Very Tasty and easy to do. I just took some to a friend that has terminal cancer. It's hard to find something useful and meaningful to do other than prayers and good food. She has a close knit family that is good at helping as well as friends. If you'd like, please add Betty to your prayer list for an easy passing.

I was a little apprehensive about melting the chocolate after reading some of these reviews, but it was so easy. The chocolate came out so smooth, and as long as the strawberries are totally dry, they turn out beautifully. I don't own a double boiler, so I just put a smaller pot into a larger one, and it worked just fine. After the chocolate was melted I removed the upper pot to ensure that I didn't over heat.

These are so good! I make them at least once after we go strawberry picking. I have found that they taste better when dipped in a sweeter chocolate; if the chocolate is to bitter, it overpowers the sweetness of the strawberry. I also like to drizzle them with white chocolate; they look so pretty!

This was an easy recipe- however I made a few mistakes that I'll share- hoping to help save others...(I used the recipe before with no problems - so it does work well - usually!  I'm positive my problems weren't due to the recipe.) 1st of all- make sure your bowl isn't glass (I thought mine was tempered...a cracked bowl later- I realized it wasn't.) That should have tipped me off for problem #2 - if the water is too hot- your chocolate won't melt! it becomes a solid slab in the bowl! What I think saved it was that I had added the 2 tbsp of butter, so as I let it just sit there & cool- it actually softened and melted. (I of course started a 2nd batch thinking I completely ruined the 1st batch, and although I thought I was being more careful-it too was overheated). Maybe the biggest tip would be to not start the project when you are on a tight deadline-like when you come home at 3:30 and your teenage son says he needs to bring something to the potluck dinner meeting that night & needs it by 5:30 - & he decided he was trying for a prize by bringing chocolate covered strawberries...we were probably trying to rush things along- pretending to be patient...schedule in plenty of time. So- while the 1st batch cooled, we were dipping pretzels in the chocolate, then as it continued to soften, I was able to cover the strawberries too! So, after a QUICK chill in the fridge, he was off to his meeting! (with bonus chocolate covered pretzels- some rolled in coconut!)

I've made these for so many years and they are so delicious.  First I lay a sheet of waxpaper on a cookie sheet. I'm usually impateint so I toss my chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl and cook for 45sec-1minute.  I stir until smooth. Then instead of the toothpick I just hold by the green stem and dip them then lay on the waxpaper.  I put the whole sheet in the fridge for 15 minutes to set up and if I feel like it I will melt a small amount of white choc with the shortening and drizzle with a spoon back and forth over the strawberries.  Back in the fridge and they are set up nice and good to plate and present.  I do like using semi-sweet choc better for a richer taste but the milk choc is great as well.  (if you really have time and want to impress see stuffed strawberries recipe on this site then follow this one-HOLY GOODNESS!)

Delicious and beautiful!  Make sure your berries are completely dry when you dip them.  Chocolate melted really nice when you melt the butter first. Was a great inexpensive gift!

I cut the recipe in half and still had too much chocolate for a 1/2 lb of strawberries. I used the leftover to drizzle over the strawberries with a fork, after the chocolate had hardened a bit, to give it a nice design.   
I really recommend using dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. strawberries (as well as raspberries and cherries for that matter) and dark chocolate are a match made in heaven.  its more elegant too.

I've made these twice in the last month.  They are great!  Both times I used Semi-sweet chocolate chips and used the microwave method to melt the chocolate (i.e. 20s at 50%, stir, 20s at 50%, stir, etc...).  They are super easy to make and are some of the best tasting things ever.

I loved these! I made them for my sweetie on Valentines Day and we both really enjoyed them. I followed the recipe exactly (with the 2 tbsp shortening). I didn't have any problems with clumps or lumps. I heated the chocolate and shortening over medium heat and then when it was all melted I turned it down to warm/low while I dipped the strawberries. I think this might have prevented any lumps to form because the chocolate never got a chance to cool. Will definitely make these again and i'm looking forward to trying it with other fruit.

Great and easy recipe, but I didn't understand the reason for the shortening, it turned into little crunchy bits. The second time I went without and the strawberries came out perfect. I also found that semi-sweet chocolate chips taste the best...I mede this with apple slices as well as strawberries!

Delicious!! I used other reviewer's suggestions:  half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I only used a tablespoon of shortening for about 11 oz of chocolate, and it was enough to cover 2 lb.s of strawberries, some pound cake pieces, and a few mini Stella Dora cookies.  I brought it in to the office for Valentine's Day and everyone loved the taste as well as the presentation!!  I used 6" bamboo skewers instead of toothpicks and placed into a flat, circular styrofoam board.  It looked like a little forest of chocolate covered strawberries!  Wonderful!!  The cookies and pound cake I put into a styrofoam cone which looked nice too, but stability proved tricky when you go to pull out the goodies.  Next time, I think I'll cover marshmallows too and a cover with a graham cracker square.  Great recipe for any variety of chocolate covered treats!!!  Thanks!!!!

So easy--took maybe 10 minutes.  I used the strawberries right out of the fridge.  I just washed them and patted them dry.  As they warmed to room temp., it helped the chocolate become firm.  I served about 2 hours later.  Oh, and because I don't keep wax paer in the house, I just greased some tin foil, and had no problems with sticking.  It was just for the family, so I skipped the whole toothpick drying technique, though that would make them fancier...but no more delicious!

Wonderful, and so easy!  I made these for a party for a co-worker at my house.  The guests were so impressed! I arranged them on a 3-tier candy dish and it just looked exquisite.  Had some chocolate left over and had raspberries in the fridge, so I spooned a small dollop of chocolate on top of each raspberry. Our guests devoured these faster than the strawberries! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very EASY and good...I used semi sweet choc. chips, and I didn't have styro foam so what I did was use my strainer (colander, I think thats what you call it) just flipped it upside down and voila, it held the toothpicks in place very well. I did have left over choc, so I went ahead and made me covered cherries...(lol I used the jarred cherries and marinated them in amaretto for a few minutes, and dipped them in the choc), Will definitely make this again, and I'll try making choc. covered grapes like the ones they sell at festivals here in Germany!

For some reason I have no luck with these when using my double boiler. I tried twice and ended up with a large clump of hard chocolate both times. Tried a third time in the microwave. One minute, stirred, then an additional minute and stirred again. Came out perfect!

The chocolate/shortening melted perfectly and the strawberries were a snap to make using the toothpick/styrofoam method.  The first batch were fine, but on the second batch, my chocolate was a little too warm.  Next time I will only keep the chocolate warm enough for dipping or spooning over the strawberries.  Great recipe!

This was my first time making these.  At first I used the wax paper, but one side of the chocolate came out flat.   So, I ended up placing the tookpick on the strawberry, dipping them in the chocolate, and then placing the toothpicks in a styrofoam plate.  That tip alone was worth the whole recipe.

This was a very simple and good recipe but did not think that it tasted very well once refridgerated.  The chocolate became very "chalky" and did not taste as good as it did before it was refridgerated.

If you're able to afford a better quality of chocolate I suggest the Callebaut brand. It makes a world of a difference when melting and dipping. No need to add shortening, butter, oils etc..

Sweet!  I have made this a couple times.  I don't have a double broiler so I put a small pan inside a larger pan of boiling water.  It worked pretty good.  My chocolate was a 12 oz bag and I forgot to adjust the shortening (I used margarine) so my chocolate didn't harden as it should have, but that was my fault.  I just layed the strawberries on wax paper because I didn't have any styrofoam.  Very nice treat.

I did these with white chocolate chips.  Dipped the strawberries about half way up the berry, then rolled the tips of the berries in blue tinted sugar.  Voila! red, white and blue strawberries for a Memorial Day picnic.  My grand daughter and I did these among lots of giggling and dripped chocolate and named them the best of the whole meal.  My daughter said she never even got a taste!  We'll do this again for July 4th and I'll post a picture.  They really look great for the American holidays.  If I can find strawberries at Christmas we plan to do them with a little bit of green sugar to make a red, white and green theme.

I made these for Christmas and put them on a Christmas tree styrofome  cone.  It looked beautiful! The chocolate melted perfectly.  I did not wet my strawberries, but wiped them with a damp paper towel.  There was no beading and it was quite impressive at the dinner table on Christmas day!

I loved this recipe as did my sister. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk and used butter in place of shortening and upped it to 3 tablespoons. The only thing I have to say about this recipe is that a double-boiler is not necessary and using a small pot works just as well. I have never used a double-boiler and my chocolate has never seized or burned.

Easy, I dont have a dble boiler, I used 2 pots and took the chocolate pot off when half way melted and stirred it until it melted. I used a little less than 2tbs butter instead of shortening and a 11.5 oz bag of chocolate chips. Yummy, thank you!!

I used butter instead. Came out great. Although I heated it up for to long and got thick so I added heavy whipping cream and it seemed to do the trick!!! Hubby loved them and my daughter couldn't get enough. :D Thanks for the recipe it is the best and easiest out there:)

Everybody asks me to make and bring them to get togethers.  Just remember to remove any excess water left on berries from rinsing otherwise it will ruin the chocolate.

Perfect every time. Like others I used the microwave to melt the chocolate.  I use long skewers and then once I dip the strawberries I stick the other end in a upside down strainer and let them dry.  Works great...no messy chocolate to clean up and they look beautiful and professional.

I made these for Valentine's Day and they turned out really well for me.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips, which created the perfect contrast with the sweetness of the berries.  There is no need to use toothpicks or skewers, just hold on to the stems and leaves.  I will be making these again!

Made exactly as the recipe stated.  I just held them for a minute after being dipped and then put them on plate with foil on it - put them into the refrigerator immediately and had almost no "extra" chocolate on the bottom of the strawberries.  Were a huge hit at the wedding shower I made these for.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made a lot of chocolate covered strawberries and found that there isn't a need to put butter or shortening. The perfect combo for me is Baker's milk chocolate with 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. Yum!

These turned out marvelous!  However, there was enough chocolate to dip 2 lbs of strawberries.  I also drizzled them with white chocolate and they looked as good as they tasted.

Very easy and very pretty.  I didn't use the styrofoam and they worked fine.  I just dipped them by their stems.  I had two pounds for a small party and had none left over.  I didn't even get to try one, they went so fast.

I don't have a double broiler either, so I just used the microwave in 30 second intervals. I cut the recipe in half, and microwaved the shortening first. I nuked it first for 30 seconds, stirred and nuked it an additional 30 seconds. Then I added the chocolate. I nuked it 30 seconds, and stirred. It only took another minute stirring after 30 seconds again and I had very smooth melted chocolate. I didn't really have any styrofoam on hand, so I just improvised and used an egg carton. These strawberries turned out wonderful!!

This didn't work out so well for me.  The juice from the strawberries didn't let the chocolate get hard so the chocolate was runny and semi-melted and not very pretty to serve.  I used hershey's chocolate chips and don't think that was the problem.  I've used baking chocolate before and they turned out fine that way - so I think I'll stick to my old recipe.

Great recipe!  My strawberries look so great!  I made them for my neice's birthday party tomorrow.  When I was asked to do it, I felt very intimidated, but this recipe made it easy..  I used butter flavored shortening.  I made two batches.  For the first batch I used Bakers semi-sweet baking chocolate and melted it in the microwave in a 2-cup glass measuring cup.  The texture was so smooth and it looked wonderful on the strawberries.  For the second batch I used Hersheys special dark chocolate bars, also melted in the microwave.  The mixture was a little clumpy and doesn't look as nice.  However, both taste great!

Excellent, easy and quick!  I made these for my husband for Valentine's Day and they were a hit.  As others have said, there was more than enough chocolate sauce for 1 lb of strawberries.  next time I will either cut the sauce in half or buy more berries!

very good and easy - the only things I notices is the choclate wasn't really smooth when I was dipping the strawberries in it. I had to smooth it out a little.

I have tried many recipes for chocolate coated things and this one has worked the best. One thing to remember is to use good quality choc. chips - some of the less expensive kind have a lot of wax and it makes it impossible to get a smooth consistency. Thanks for this useful recipe!

It was easier than I thought! I used a bag of Dove milk chocolate.  I didnt' use shortening. I turned off heat to melt the chocolate since it was a small amount.  I heated 2/3 of the bag of chocolate until melted.  Then I put in the other 1/3 to cool it down.  The stawberries came out perfectly!!  I was so nervous to make these, but it was easy and DELICIOUS!  I still had some chocolate left over so I dipped some pretzel sticks I had on hand.....they were delicous too!

The tooth pick in the styrofoam allows for a nice even coating of chocolate while it cools. To do the white chocolate streaks like in the picture you would need to let the milk chocolate cool and then lay them down on wax paper and drizzle the white chocolate over top.

These turned out beautiful for me. Instead of using toothpicks, I used 6 inch wooden skewers. It was easier to dip them in my double boiler then stick them in a piece of styrofoam. I stuck the pointed end of the skewer into the styrofoam. It was more secure than sticking the other, flat, end in. I used chocolate disks made for candy and melted them. The chocolate set up quickly and I was able to lay the finished strawberries in a pan with wax paper on the bottom. I also laid 2 layers of paper towels under the wax paper. They traveled well in my covered cake pan.

this was by far a ton easier then I anticipated. With Easter tomorrow I wanted some chocolate covered strawberries w/ whipped topping on top of a chocolate cake i made. I did follow a few other reviewers suggestions and did melt the shortening first then the chocolate to keep it smooth; I also used my double boiler and made sure the water didn't touch the top pan! I've now got 3 wonderful trays of Chocolate covered strawberries in my 2nd fridge for tomorrow! Thank you so much! Easy and i have some left over chocolate that can be reheated that I'll be giving to my hubby's best friend (also our neighbor) so he can reheat in the microwave (i'll give him a second thing he can put water in underneath) and make some more of his own. 
Thanks again! :)

Great simple recipe that looks so fancy!  I placed a colored toothpick in each strawberry and used them for dipping.  I had a pot of bittersweet chocolate, and a pot of white chocolate, and I decorated them by painting dark chocolate hearts on the white strawberries and drizzling white chocolate on the dark ones. The whole operation only took 30 minutes and best of all, NO BAKING!!!

Turned out great!  I used vegan chocolate chips and coconut oil (it's solid at room temp). I probably heated my chocolate too hot, but the only problem with that was it took a long time to cool the berries. I cooled the strawberries on parchment paper. Thanks for the easy recipe!!!

This is a great and easy way to impress. I have been making these for special occasions for years. I jazz them up by sprinkling toppings on after resting them on the wax paper. Try toasted coconut, shaved chocolate, or almond slivers. Just make sure you have them all ready ahead of time so you can sprinkle quickly before the chocolate sets. I make a lot at once so I can share with lots. I reuse the container the strawberries came in and can fit two layers of strawberries inside with wax in between.

Just made these and they came out great!  I just melted, on low, Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips, stirring constantly until melted and smooth.  Then I turned off the heat and dipped the strawberries, which I had already put toothpicks in.  Went really quick and 1- 11.5 oz. bag did about 2 lbs. strawberries.  I used some foam and worked like a charm.  Skip the shortening, it's not needed.

Its the way I've always made them! YUMMY! I don't think the shortening is necessary, but I used a little butter instead.  I made these as the ending to a yummy Valentine dinner for the family!

These are the best!  I don't own a double broiler so I microwave the chips with the shortening, at 30 seconds at a time, twice.  I stir in between & the remaining chips just melt as I stir.  I have tried using butter instead of the shortening but what every single time I've done this, the chocolate seems very "soft" out of the fridge.  It doesn't have that slight crunch you get when you buy them whether at Godiva or at the fair.  But they come out perfect when I use the shortening.

Just made these for Mother's Day and they were a HUGE hit! Everybody loved them! They are really cheap to make and I even skipped out on the shortening and they turned out fabulous! I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave for approx. 1 minute, stirred the chips and dipped the strawberries. I added almonds, chocolate sprinkles and caramel on them afterwards. I definitely recommend this recipe. White chocolate strawberries are amazing too!

I love these, and use dark chocolate, sometimes chips sometimes a better grade. I melt the chocolate in the microwave until only half of the chocolate is melted, stir, dip, and then place on waxed paper. The most important thing is to make sure the strawberries are DRY or your chocolate will become grainy.

Always wanted to make these. And they are so easy to make.I bought the milk chocolate melting disks a pound of those.I melted them at half power in 1 minute increments to melt choc. For tthose afraid of burning choc the microwave is the way to go real easy. I wanted to use the styrofoam but did not have any, so I just layed them on wax paper. Oh and I did not use the shortening. Next time I will buy styrofoam see if I can get them to look professional :)

Very, Very GOOD!! after reading about chocolate I found it better to melt the chocolate in a "dry" environment... chocolate and water are NOT friends, so even the smallest drop of water in your chocolate could ruin this experience...I melted the chocolate 50% power in the microwave and stired every 45 sec (it takes 3 x 45sec per chocolate cup) make sure that NOT ALL the chocolate has melted, it will with the remaining heat. Make sure to dry your strawberries!!..everyone loves them and it is very easy to get creative...cheers!!

Be sure to read a few reviews for tips.  I melted the mixture in the microwave in a glass measuring cup and kept it warm in another bowl of hot water while I worked.  I think this kept it from cooling to quickly.  This may help others.  They turned out super for me!

I don't know if this has already been mentioned but instead of using that method to melt the chocolate chips I put them in a microwavable dish and heated them up on the defrost setting at 10 second intervals. After every ten seconds I would take the bowl out and stir it. I would say it took about 4-6 ten second intervals to completely melt the chocolate. I would say it still tastes delicious using this method. Also I just placed the strawberries on a greased baking sheet to dry.

I tried it twice with butter instead of shortening because of the trans fat. The chocolate wouldn't melt right. So, the third time I just did plain chocolate, which was wonderful!

This recipe is amazing for not only strawberries, but anything else!  I have dipped marshmallows, shortbread cookies, pretzels and more using this recipe.  The shortening allows the melteed chocolate to be a great dipping consistency.  So, when asked for melted chocolate in any other recipe, remember 1 tbsp of shortening to 1 c. of chocolate chips!

Great recipe!  Make sure the strawberries are thoroughly dry by patting with paper towels, otherwise the chocolate receeds from the strawberries.  Also, DO NOT be tempted to add more shortenening,or that's all you'll taste.  Be patient and keep stirring the chocolate till the desired texture is acheived.  Also, semi-sweet chocolate can be used.

These were yummy! I inserted toothpicks in the strawberries and used a wooden spoon to either coat the strawberries in chocolate or roll the strawberry in the chocolate. When I tried dipping them while the chocolate was in the double boiler, the steam kept burning me and the strawberries kept falling off. It was much easier the other way. =)

This is such a fantastic and impressive treat!  Cheap too!  All you have to do is make sure they arent wet or the chocolate wont stick!  Use candy sticks instead of toothpicks as the hold the strawberry up better for drying.

INCREDIBLE recipe!!  So easy, and sooo good!  I already have requests to bring them to Easter Brunch next Sunday!  
I did drizzle white chocolate over them -- if you melt it, then put it in a baggie & snip off just a VERY small corner of the baggie, it works perfectly!

I made these last night for my husband for Valentine's Day and they were a hit.  So simple and tasted amazing.  Although, I did not use the shortening.  I drizzled them with white chocolate too.  Wow, so good.  For those people who mentioned how much left over chocolate this recipe makes, I recommend using the serving conversion.  I converted this recipe to 10 servings.  Note a drop left!!  Thanks for sharing.

I did not have styrofoam at home, so I used bananas and oranges to hold the toothpicks. A banana could easily hold about 8 strawberries and the orange (which I placed in a tight fitting condiment bowl) held up about 5 easily. Later, I peeled and chopped the bananas and orange and froze them separately for using in smoothies!

I had extra melted milk chocolate left in the end, which I scooped out on aluminium foil, and used a spoon to spread it in the shape of a heart. When it hardened, I used it as centerpiece for my decoration!

Next time I will experiment with different flavors of milk chocolate.

Fantastic!  I made them for New Years Eve, and what a hit!  I used Hershey milk chocolate'chipits'..so good tasted like cadbury chocolate.  So many compliments on these.  I'm all about no fuss, so I just held them by the stem and dipped them then just placed on baking sheet.  Unless your guests are really fussy this method seems to work just fine : ) I've already had a request for these for the next big get together!

My guests last night were so impressed with this wonderful treat.  Totally easy and foolproof! I actually dipped two pounds of strawberries with one standard size bag of chocolate chips, and still had a little chocolate left over.

I never would have thought that making these would be so easy!  I also used raspberries, which were REALLY good.  I just stabbed them with a toothpick to dip and then laid them on wax paper.

I did use the coffee hto plate method suggested, and it took a great deal of time to melt, though it did not scorch.  I woudl suggest that if using the coffee hot plate method, add a little chocolate at a time, and not the entire amoutn at once.  This gives the chocolate a chance to heat up and melt down a lot quicker.  It saves a lot of time.  I also tried making strawberries, bananas, and grapes on skwers and then dipping them in chocote.  I froze them for a few hours,a dn the kids loved it.

Made these for Valentine's and they were DELICIOUS.  Shared with children's teachers and co-workers and received rave reviews.  I used semi-sweet morsels and white chocolate morsels for drizzle.  I really like the slight "bite" of the semi-sweet morsels.  A nice contrast to the juicy, sweet berries.  Co-workers said they were better than any they had every bought.  YUM!

Using shortening is much better than just the chocolate only which is what lot of other recipes say to do. I prefer to use semi-sweet chocolate chips. I heat it easily in the microwave, just be sure not to overheat the chocolate or it will get nasty and lumpy. I put it in a small bowl or a coffee mug, stirring every 20 seconds until the chocolate chips are almost completely melted, then I stir it for about 30 seconds to let it finish melting outside of the microwave. I use a shish kabob stick to dip the strawberries, I stab it straight down into the stem, it's way stronger than a toothpick. :)

Great presentation & good taste. Looks pro too. But instead of drizzling white chocolate, I used other things like sprinkles & lightly toasted nut bits. I made these for Valentine's Day 2012! :-)

Did it all in the microwave (at 30 sec intervals). Let them dry on wax paper in the fridge. Worked perfectly! No need to go through the double boiler hassle.

These were so easy to make!  I chose to follow a mix of recommendations and used 12 oz semi-sweet chocolate (ghirardelli) and 4 oz bittersweet.  I think any kind would taste delicious though.  I used the two tbsp of shortening as well.  I didn't have double boiler so I used a pot with a mixing bowl.  Once I melted the chocolate, I kept the bowl over the water, but lowered the heat and I had absolutely no problem with the chocolate clumping up.  Also, I added some Canola Oil to the white chocolate and it made it much easier to drizzle with an icing tip.  Love it and so easy to make!

I made these ahead a few days in preparation for Valentine's Day and stored them in an airtight container in the fridge. When I took them out for Valentine's dessert, I found that the chocolate had "sweat" on it and that there was some standing "sweat" around each covered strawberry. Still tasted great, although the chocolate had started to come away from the fruit a bit. Weird?

Today was my first time making chocolate covered anything. I run the school age class at a daycare and today was our big Valentines party so I made chocolate coverd strawberries and bananas. They tasted amazing. What an easy and delicious recipe. I melted my chocolate in a thick steel pot on the very lowest setting and patted each strawberry with a paper towel before dipping. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This recipe was great!  The only mistake I made was I didn't let them dry on parchment paper and the chocolate froze at the bottom of my dish.  But we still enjoyed them once we managed to get them off.

I feel so dumb for ever buying chocolate covered strawberries! I never realized they were SO easy! I melted my chocolate/shortening in a mini-crockpot since I don't own a double boiler. I used store brand chocolate chips and they taste like they came from a chocolate store. I can't wait to serve these to my family and friends. Oh, and I had extra chocolate so I covered some banana chunks. Mmmm...

Made these for Mother's Day for my Mom and Daughter. This was my first attempt at these. Turned out wonderful. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 1 1/2 T of butter flavored shortening (all I had) and the double boiler method (just used a medium pot under a smaller pot). I made sure my berries were dry and didn't use a toothpick or the styrofoam. I used wax paper on a cookie sheet, dipped them by hand about 2/3 up the berry and chilled in the 'frig. Once they're chilled, they come right off the wax paper. One thing I'll watch next time, a couple of the berries were touching when they went into the 'fridge and when you separate them, some of the chilled chocolate broke away from the berry. They were definitely still edible. My grandchildren, daughter and Mother all loved them and thought they were very pretty. I'll be making these again. After looking through the photos, I'd like to roll them in finely chopped nuts or maybe coconut for something different.

These were so easy to make...I have a burner on my gas stove that has incredibly low heat which is perfect for melting chocolate, so I used that and had no problems at all.  I got creative in the drying part..didn't have styrofoam and didn't want to lay them down, so I put them on the oven rack (cold oven..lol..) stem side down so the stem hung below and the strawberry itself rested on the rack with the chocolate side up...left them there until they dried and then refrigerated them...they came out perfecto!!!!

This was perfect! We also melted a small amount of white chocolate and used a fork to quickly drizzle over the dark chocolate. They were very pretty and everyone really enjoyed them.

I had never melted chocolate before, and so I didn't know how easy it was to burn it! But after trying (and failing) once, it was EXTREMELY easy and turned out delicious!

Very easy. And looks beautiful. It was the first time I was melting chocolate and having read up on it, I was very nervous. I used a steamer, so that the boiling water does not touch the dish which had the choc chips. It melted fine and was no hassle.. Loved it. It looked nice and fancy.

So easy!  I too melted the chocolate without the shortening, and it turned out just fine -- I bought some extra pretzel rods to dip into all the leftover chocolate (there was a lot when using a full bag of chips for 1 pound of strawberries).  I came into a little bit of trouble drizzling the white chocolate on top - I made a makeshift frosting bag by snipping the corner of a regular plastic sandwich bag, and it made adding the white chocolate on top very easy & look great!

I agree with the person who said just use choclate and add nothing.  Also, I am baffled that people are able to use toothpicks. Mine fall out but maybe it's due to the fact that I don't use shortening.  I just use my hand to hold them.  This is a easy, inexpesive treat. Guys, make this for your girls on Valetine's day and she will think you are one of a kind!
PS. Many people think coconut oil is healthy so one may substitute that for the shortening.

I used 2 bags of chocolate chips (12 oz each)- 1 milk choc and 1 semi-sweet.  I slowly microwaved them at 60% power, stirring every 30-40 seconds.  Once they started to melt, I mixed in 2 tbsp canola oil.  Once the chocolate had melted and was creamy, I dipped the washed and thoroughly dried strawberries in and put them on wax paper.  They took about 30 or so minutes to set in the refrigerator.  I easily covered three 16oz boxes of strawberries and could have covered more.  Easy and delicious!

I can't believe how easy these were to make! I have use both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chip and I prefer the semi-sweet. I think it has a nice look and taste to it. I make these for all my parties and they're always gone within 5 minutes!!

Great recipe, very easy. The berries looked great and the price of a dozen berries was well under $4.00. I added a bit of oil to the chocolate, but there was no "shine" on the hardened chocolate...no big deal really, but how do I get a shine?

I used oil instead of shortening because that's what I had. I also used someone's idea about the collander. It was perfect to hold the berries for drying. They were a hit!

These are so easy to make, and so beautiful.  I also microwaved some white chocolate (almond bark) and drizzled on top of the hardened milk chocolate.  I can't wait to surprise the husband and kids with this elegant treat for our Valentine's Day dinner!

I did not have any shortening so I just melted a bag of Giradhelli's milk chocolate chips in the microwave. I inserted a toothpick thru the top of the strawberry and dipped them in the chocolate. I put them in the freezer for a few minutes after dipping to set the chocolate and they came out beautifully!

I used 2lbs of small strawberries, about 4.5oz of milk chocolate chips and 4.5oz pure semi-sweet chocolate chips, and about 1tsp of unsalted butter. I took the suggestion of someone below, and heated the chocolate in a bowl in 20sec increments about 70% power, stirring every 20sec. I had to heat it about 2:20min. The chocolate stayed smooth up until I finished dipping all the strawberries (which I washed and paper-towel dried individually), a 1/2h later, much to my surprise! :) I would suggest breaking the toothpicks in half if you're using small strawberries, and pre-poking the holes in the stryfoam- it makes it much easier. I also tried the coliander idea but I found my strawberries fell all over the place,  see what works for you! These hardened in about an hour in the fridge, but because I made them for lunch with my boyfriend the next day, I kept them in the fridge overnight hoping they wouldn't go mushy and run, and they didn't! (=D!!). I needed to keep them cool for another 3 hours out of the fridge, so I put it in a plastic container surrounded by ice packs in an insulated lunch bag. They were perfect!

I used this recipe for a party and everyone raved about these strawberries.  I think the shortening must make this one so good.  I never used it before; I usually just melt chocolate chips.  Highly recommend this.  It's a good take along to parties or just for yourself.  :)

This recipe is great - the shortening works just as well as paraffin!! I also added some icing coloring to the white chocolate to make pink for easter - it worked out great! And what a great idea to stick the toothpicks in styrofoam!

This takes practice! One tip- Place the finished strawberried into the freezer to set the chocolate fast. Definitly use the tooth pick and foam idea, i tryed balancing them on the green and it was nearly impossible. I used foam trays from the grocery store, i buy pears on them, turn them upside down. I made 50 for a family picnic, and i'll be making almost 200 for another!

The toothpicks and styrofoam are good idea. But I see no point in the shortening. 

To make the chocolate easy to work with, just add a little milk in the glass bowl and warm it up a little before adding the chocolate chips. 

Don't use the microwave! I tried it and it was hard control the temperature. I used a glass bowl and a small saucepan for a double boiler.

In order to make the chocolate coating glossy without going through the whole complicated tempering procedure,I seperated the chocolate chips into two batches (the second batch was samller). Once the first batch has melted in the milk, I put in the second batch. Stir until smooth and glossy.

Simple and yummy!

Absolutely fantastic! I make these for summer get togethers and they are always the first thing people go for.  Very easy to make, just be sure to use good quality chocolate or they end up tasting too "lardy".

I had to bake a cake tonight that didn't turn out as lovely as I would've wished (should've used a recipe from this site!).  I needed something quick, easy, and eye-fetching as a decoration, and this filled the ticket beautifully!  I didn't have to dry the berries on toothpicks set in styrofoam.  I just dipped them in the melted chocolate and carefully tipped them on the stem end on a parchment lined cookie sheet and they stayed in place (they would have been in a perfect position to drizzle white chocolate on them).  I am so pleased to be able to make such a lovely presentation for my co-worker's birthday.  I had more than enough chocolate, so I mixed salted peanuts into the remainder and made chocolate peanut clusters.  Kitten, thank you so much for this submission!  You are a lifesaver!

The recipe was great!  I will follow it exactly next time.  Here are some things I learned while doing this for the first time.  I discovered that trying to melt the chocolate chips in the microwave burned the chocolate.  I also found out that adding the Crisco made the chocolate smoother and easier to dip.  I couldn't taste the Crisco at all like others have mentioned.  It was an easy recipe and I would definitely do it again.

I made this for my husband on Valentine's day.  I used milk chocolate and white chocolate chips and after dipping the strawberries in one or the other I filled some of each chocolate into sandwich bags and cut off a little bit of the corners.  I used these makeshift pipping bags to make fancy lines and dots.  Looked really professional, tasted great and made my husband feel pampered.

I didn't have shortening so I just melted semi-sweet chips in the microwave.  It may not be as smooth as with shortening, but it looked fine.  If you only dip about half the strawberry, like in the photo, you can probably do 2 lbs with a bag of chips.  Be sure the bowl and the strawberries are DRY!

This is THE recipie to use on a date.  It is so simple and easy that the two of you can make them together and have alot of fun while you do it.  Make them at the beginning of the night and then cuddle up in front of a movie and wow your special someone with a gourmet dinner.  Afterwards your strawberries will be cooled and you can enjoy your creation together.  What man could resist?

Make sure you make these with really high quality strawberries and chocolate.  The huge ones with the stems on them and Ghirardelli chocolate chips make these to die for.  They are also really pretty decorated with a drizzle of white chocolate.  

Do not attempt to make these the day before, they will still taste amazing but the strawberry juice starts to come out and they will not look so pretty.

The milk chocolate was not thick enough & ended up clumping & burning.  I used semi-sweet chocolate instead & they turned out perfect.

This is a great recipe! I "kicked it up a notch" by letting some of the strawberries cool for a minute and then rolling them in crushed almonds or crushed macadamias or mini chocolate chips. I tried to sprinkle with powdered sugar - but this was not very successful. I used small bamboo skewers insted of toothpicks.

I had trouble keeping the chocolate from clumping.  I've made chocolate strawberries before just melting chocolate in a double boiler and I found that much easier.  The results from this still turned out just fine.

Wow! My three girlies 7, 4, and 1 year old loved making these as much as eating them.  We dipped in white chocolate and drizzled swirls in milk chocolate.  They were beautiful.  They took a few hours to overnight to completely harden.  The teachers at our elementary/preschools loved them.  We included a note to "Have a Berry Good Year!"

Hubby Drew went to one of the food clubs yesterday and brought home strawberries, so Ty decided to chocolate cover them. I know it was us and not the recipe, but our chips didn't really melt, but got all dry and clumpy. We had store brand chips in the house, so maybe that was the reason. We ended up throwing it away. Fortunately, I had some sweetened name brand baking chocolate and that worked fine for us. Needless to say, the strawberries were sinful! It's so cute because "Kitten" is my nickname for my niece! Hey Josie, glad you requested the same. Maybe something will come of it.

Scored some major points with my girlfriend when she woke up to these beauties. Don't forget to put them on a cooking sheet - it will reduce the chances of the chocolate sticking to the plate.

The recipe is good. What saves time is putting the strawberries on the Styrofoam first then pouring the chocolate sauce over them.

Simple and Easy - but full of YUMMOLICIOUSNESS!! I made these for my sister's bridal shower and they were a HUGE hit!  We decided to do several of her favorite foods for the entire shower menu - and I knew chocolate covered strawberries had to be an option on the dessert menu!  This recipe was almost too easy!  One recipe makes several chocolate covered strawberries - especially depending on the size of your berries.  With the shower being in early summer, many berries were very large - but I was still able to get almost 2 dzn berries from this recipe and 3/4 of each berry was covered (I made them later in the summer for another bridal shower, and the berries were much smaller and I was able to almost 2.5 dz from one recipe.)  For "setting and cooling"...I dipped each berry in the chocolate, placed them on wax paper lined cookie sheets, and then placed them in the refrigerator.  They were set in about 20 min.  I was then able to store them in an airtight plastic container - to make transporting much easier.  For serving, I placed each strawberry in individual silver cupcake liners, and then displayed them on a Wilton cupcakes & more display stand...it was so pretty and a nice touch to the dessert table! I kept the berries simple - nothing drizzled on top - but may "dress them up" in the future, depending on the situation.  Such a quick, simple recipe - great summertime treat, a Valentine's gift or a nice touch to a bridal party lunch.

Thanks for the tip on setting the chocolate covered strawberries upside-down. I didn't have Styrofoam so I used an upside down egg carton. I recommend poking holes using a pin rather than trying to poke the toothpick through. Also, next time I will watch the chocolate more carefully so as not to let it steam and therefore lose its smoothness. Based on my attempts plus other reviews, once the chocolate is overheated, there's no fixing it. The all recipes article on tempering chocolate was very helpful. Thanks for all the helpful reviews! The flavor of my finished product was still very tasty and I'll make these again with and without shortening. :-)

I know this annoys people, but I did not really follow the recipe. Just want to share what I did.

I melted Lindt milk chocolate in the micowave in small batches, since it seizes up quick...and i just dipped the strawberries in them. Didnt even have a chance to cool them, theyw ere so yummy I was dipping and eating! Have to work on presentaton though, as the melted choc gets thick and it makes it hard to dip.

So easy and delicious!  I used semi sweet chocolate chips for the anti-oxidant element.  I also microwaved the chips and oil to speed up the process and it worked great.  Had extra chocolate and coated marshmallows with it.  Great gift idea!

This was the first time I had true success making a full batch of chocolate covered strawberries.  In fact, I was able to dip 2 pounds with one bag of chocolate chips.  I don't know if it was adding the shortening or making sure the strawberries were completely dry but they were great.

I even sent 1/2 to a neighbor (via her husband) and she called the next day to say they were beautiful and she thought for sure he had bought them.

Easy & delicious! You can get as creative as you want to with this recipe. I only used 1T of crisco per 1C chocolate. First I dipped the berries in Guittard milk choc & put them on a parchment lined cookie sheet. I put them in the fridge on the cookie sheet to cool for about an hour then I dipped them back into bittersweet chocolate. Then I sprinkled some with course sea salt, some I rolled in mini semi-sweet chips, some I rolled in red crystal sugar. Skys the limit to how you can decorate these berries. They were a hit with my loved ones. Will make these again & again!

I always make chocolate covered strawberries. Especially for Valentine's Day. This recipe was totally easy. I just hadn't done it with chocolate chips and shortening. SO I thought what the heck...I'm in the mood ;-) Easy Peasy! My family loved them. I have no complaints. Great recipe.

This was trial and error for us even after reading many of the reviews. Chocolate is very tricky to melt properly and we were never able to get it to a "drizzle" consistency at all, our berries were quite large because thats all i could find so they were delicious but not as attractive as i wanted. There has to be a way to make the chocolate a little thinner so i will continue to search for easier methods and the best melting chocolate to use.

Delicious, quick and easy to make.  I didn't add any shortening and the dipping went fine without it.  I microwaved the chips in a small deep bowl for 2 minutes, checking every 30 seconds to see if the chips were melting and give them a stir.  I put the dipped strawberries on parchment paper to cool the chocolate before putting them in the refrigerator to harden.  I made a batch with 6 oz of semi sweet choco chips and a 2 oz batch with 60% cacao choco chips, which my husband likes.

I used just chocolate and strawberries, they came out awesome. I used ghirardelli 60% cacao baking chips, melted the chocolate in a makeshift double boiler, and plopped them in the freezer for about 4 minutes after dipping. I decided to lay berries on their side rather than use the toothpick method, and I found using long stemmed strawberries very handy for dipping. Plus they look cute! Perfect for vday ; )

Don't microwave in a glass dish! This did NOT work. I ended up making a double-boiler and having to add more butter because my chocolate got so dried out from the microwave.  I just put a glass pyrex bowl on top of a pot with some water in it so that the moisture was held in. It took a while, but it really worked out in the end.

Easy! Doubled recipe and used extra chocolate for chocolate dipped pretzels.  I didn't have a double boiler so I used a large sauce pan and put a metal mixing bowl on top and melted the chocolate.  Thanks! Everyone wanted the recipe!

In lieu of a double boiler, place the chips and shortening in a glass bowl and microwave for 15 second intervals, stirring in between, until the consistency is right.  Varies for the quantities you use, but it took me 3-4 cycles of the above (I used 1/4 recipe).  This is faster and easier than on the stove.

These were easy and yummy. I used a full bag of Ghirardelli 60% chocolate and half a bag of semi-sweet and scant 2 Tbls shortening. I dipped layed them on a freezer paper covered cookie sheet, set in fridge for half an hour then dipped again.   When I had 6 berries left to dip the second time I added a pinch of Cayenne pepper to the chocolate. Delicious. I happen to like things with a bit of kick. I got 25 large berries and a small bit of choclate left over.   I am going to give some for mother's day to friends who love dark chocolate.

For something that looks so fancy, this recipe was SO easy!  It was quick too.  I'd suggest washing your strawberries and letting them air dry well before you plan to make the recipe just to make it easier for yourself.  :)  YUMMY!

YUM!! The shortening is a must if you want to drizzle white chocolate over the brown chocolate. This makes the consistency right.

These were so simple and delicious!  I dipped them, cooled them in the fridge, dipped again once chocolate was set (my family loves chocolate), then drizzled them with melted white chocolate.  They were all gone in a flash!  I will be making these again and again.

I followed other suggestions for properly tempering the chocolate and didn't have to add any shortening or butter.  These turned out perfectly and were a great addition to the dessert buffet at a party.

I used 1/2 milk chocolate, 1/2 semi-sweet. Made the recipe even easier by microwaving the chocolate and shortening. 1 minute on high, stir 30 seconds more on high...perfect and delicious!!

I used this for chocolate covered bananas, and maybe it was the moisture of the bananas but... I found that adding margarine made the chocolate very creamy, never to dry hard. This is desirable depending on your preference~ I however, love having that "snap" to chocolate when you bite into it, so next time I shall just temper chocolate without any additives!

This is the perfect recipe for Chocolate Covered Strawberries.  Others I've tried were too heavy on the shortening.  I always use waxed paper and they firm up in the fridge in less than 30 minutes. A quick, easy, delicious dessert. People ask me to bring them to parties!

This was good.. but it's far easier to by the big bars of chocolate almond bark and melt for 1 1/2 minutes and dip. I can usually find the big bags of almond bark for about $3 at the local grocery store.

These were very easy. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used semi-sweet choc. I had large strawberries tooth picks would not hold them ,I used small kabob skewers...they worked. Thanks for the recipe.

These came out great! I do not have a double boiler so I used the microwave and it was perfect. Make sure you wash and dry off the berries very well before coating them in the chocolate. I melted the 2 tbsp of butter (as suggested by others) in a bowl in the microwave then I mixed in the bowl 1 whole bag of ghirardelli 60%cocoa chocolate. I put it in the microwave for 1.5 mins t 50% power, stirred and kept microwaving in 15 second intervals and stirring until it all melted. I just laid them on wax paper to harden. After an hour in the fridge they were perfect and ready to serve. Everyone commented on how professional they looked. HIGHLY recommend this for a crowd. 1 bag of chocolate easily coated 2 lbs of strawberries. I ended up coating pretzel rods with the leftover chocolate and still had chocolate to spare.

Easy...with endless variations!  Tip:  Use the end of a long-handled, fireplace matchstick to dip the berries in chocolate!  It's sturdier and keeps your hands out of the chocolate.  It's better than a fondue skewer because berries don't slip.

Cut out the shortening. Used 3 different melted dips: white chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and peanut butter w/ milk chocolate. Dippings: shredded coconut, toffee bits, hazelnuts, sliced almonds, and nut topping. Melted chocolate in separate containers in microwave. Dipped strawberries in. Dipped in dipping bowls. Placed on parchment paper on cookie sheet and put in fridge. Fancier than the store-bought ones! Perfect valentine's day dessert!

The strawberries turned out beautifully !Thank you ! A hint for those of you that do not own a double boiler. I put a custard cup (it can withstand boiling water) in the bottom of the lower pan. Place smaller pot on top...much safer than trying to hold it ! I find it very safe!

This is the only way to make chocolate covered strawberries and have them turn out perfect every time.  I do buy white chocolate baking bars, put a few in a baggie, throw it in the microwave for a few seconds until melted and then decorate the chocolate covered strawberries after the chocolate has set.  There is never any left.

Very good.  After I dipped them I put them on wax paper and let the chocolate harden and then I drizzled white chocolate over them.  They were a big hit.

I've been making this for years. Another great fruit is blueberries, these look great. You eat them right off the toothpick. Buy appetizer toothpicks that are longer than normal about 4-1/2". Put 3 to 4 blueberries on, keeping them all close to each other, towards one end. Dip them in chocolate then move the toothpick around so the chocolate swirls around the berries and sets. Stick the toothpick into an upside down styrofoam plate, then refrigerate.
You can serve these by poking the toothpicks into a pear or apple thats been cut flat on the bottom so it doesn't roll around. Place your covered strawberries around this. This looks and taste amazing.

I loved this recipe for melted chocolate!  My sis is allergic to strawberries so I dipped marshmallows into the chocolate and rolled them into crushed graham crackers to make "lazy s'mores".  They were a huge hit!  I loved the simplicity of the melting recipe and also the great consistency that the s'mores had.  I definitely will try this again with berries and other foods!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This has to be one of the easiest things to do EVER! I love chocolate covered strawberries but due to past bad experiences with melting chocolate i was intimidated. I finally decided to try again and make these for a friends baby shower along with coconut macaroons. Both came out great and complimented each other well. As long as the heat is low and you stir it often you cant go wrong.

So easy and tasty! Served them at a party and they disappeared so fast! I melted my milk chocolate/shortening in the microwave on a low power and it worked great. I recommend having toothpicks and styrofoam though (especially if you are going for looks), because resting the strawberries upside down to harden was tricky (there were a few casualties).

I made these using the Paraffin Wax instead of shortening.  They came out wonderful, although watch your chocolate doesn't get to hot or the chocolate will be ruined.  Also, like another reviewer suggested I injected some Riesling into special adult strawberries and they were even better:)

Great simple recipe that my husband and I enjoyed on Valentine's Day.  I even took the left over chocolate and put it in a ziploc baggie, snipped off the end and wrote out "I love you" in chocolate.  I froze the letters and placed the strawberries around them when it was time to serve them.  He loved it!

Awesome!! SO GOOD yet SO EASY!!!!  I stuck them in the freezer for about 20 minutes so that the chocolate would harden so that there is a slight crunch when you bite into it.

Oh yum!  Okay, so they haven't set up yet in the fridge but they were easy to make ...I used Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet chocolate chips and shortening.  However, I couldn't resist dipping the last of the strawberries into the chocolate mixture and devouring them on the spot!  Delicious!  What an easy, easy, dessert to make!!

Loved it.  Would be good to do ahead of time and store them in the fridge to ensure they will be hardened.  We made them on Valentines and it was a great treat! Yum.

This was so easy to make (and easy to eat) I made 101 strawberries and stuck them on bamboo skewers.  I displayed them in a styrofoam - they looked like chocolate long stem roses!  Very cute display and I got rave reviews from other choir members! :)  I will definately make again

These were wonderful and so easy.  I used an 11.5 ounce bag of milk chocolate chips and only 1 T of shortening and it worked out fine.  I melted the chips and shortening in the microwave on 50% power checking every 20 seconds to stir.  I dipped 2 lbs of very large strawberries and it turned out to be the perfect amount.  Everyone loved these at the party.  And they looked beautiful, too!

I used this recipe for an engagement party.  I needed to double the recipe, so I used 1 bag of milk choc. chips and 1 bag of semi-sweet choc. chips and doubled the other ingredients.  It covered about 50 stawberries and worked out perfectly!  Here's an idea some may want to use: I removed all the stems from the strawberries and placed the chocolate-dipped strawberries on a beautiful platter with the chocolate-dipped part pointing up and the undipped part flat on the platter.  Then I melted white chocolate chips with this same recipe, put it in a ziploc bag with a tiny part of one corner removed, and swirled the white chocolate in the shape of a heart over the chocolate-dipped strawberries in just the center of the platter.  The whole look was very aesthetically pleasing and the strawberries were gone in no time at all.  Note: If you do this part, just make sure the white chocolate is at room temperature or cooler so it doesn't melt the chocolate on the chocolate-dipped strawberries. Thanks for the great recipe!

Phenomenal.  Just beware: if you coat the chocolate on the strawberry too thick, the chocolate gets everywhere when you bite into it!

Perfect, will make again! I use this chocolate recipe on many things, like drizzling chocolate on biscotti. Always turns out. I agree with other posters - the double boiler method is the best for melting chocolate.

the strawberries were easy to make, i didnt have a double boiler so i put a smaller pan inside of a larger one of boiling water, i would use less shortening next time cause we could really taste the shortening in the mixture

Okay!  This recipe was super easy and quick. I just finished making these. Took me a little over 20 minutes to do a pound of extra large fancy berries.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  I used wooden skewers and I stacked 3 syrofoam bowls together and flipped them upside down and punched holes in them with a pen to rest the chocolate coated skewed berries until they were dry.  Will experiment with other kinds of chocolates in the future.  Next time I will drizzle white chocolate to jazz them up further.  I've already eaten 3 of the smaller ones.  What a simple elegant dessert! I will be making these again.  Can't wait for my family to get home and try them. And they're good for you - lots of vitamin C in the strawberries and the healthy kind of chocolate -  dark chocolate.  This recipe is a winner!!!

This recipe was awesome! I also used 5 styrofoam plates but I used heavy duty toothpicks called party sticks that were much stronger than regular toothpicks. I rolled the strawberries in nut topping and they were even better. The regular ones tasted a little too chocolatey after we had those.

These were the best!  After reading the reviews I was surprised that so many people had stryofoam.  I bought stryofoam plates and stacked them about 5 deep and stuck the toothpicks in to them.  It worked great!

The greatest tip from this recipe is piercing the strawberries with a toothpick, dipping in the chocolate and the styrofoam holder was life saver. I used a narrow coffee mug to hold the chocolate for dipping and it worked great. Also I liked to use longer narrower strawberries. It was so much easy then I thought and I made 200 for my daughter's wedding in about an hour. I left the toothpicks on for the holder.

Terrific! These are a wonderful treat and are so
easy to make. I made some and took them
to a retirement home when I visited an old family friend recently, and those people were so surprised and pleased and grateful!  Thanks for sharing this recipe. It puts smiles on faces!

Super easy.  I didn't have toothpicks or styrofoam - so we used bamboo skewers and a flower vase - and I served them that way! They were for a little girls' valentine's day party so sprinkled them with pink sprinkles.

Used white chocolate and used hershey chocolate for brown stripes. Everyone LOVED it. It's super easy to make but be sure to work fast, because the chocolate thickens super quickly after it melts.

An inverted colandar in lieu of the styrofoam worked great. Also, I used a sandwich sized ziplock bag with the corner snipped off (like a pastry bag) to apply melted white chocolate after the semi-sweet layer hardened in the fridge. It was too thick to drizzle from a spoon. Make sure you start off with ripe but firm strawberries for best flavor.

Made these for a Valentine's day treat and they turned out perfect. The bag of milk chocolate chips I had wasn't quite 16 oz so I topped them up with some semi-sweet ones resulting in a chocolate combination.  As others have suggested, I melted the shortening first in the microwave and then added it to the chocolate as I started to melt it on the stove. 

I also melted white chocolate chips to be able to do the stripes. I did add a bit of shortening to the white chocolate but not as much as I did to the milk/semi-sweet chocolate. In other reviews, people had suggested not using any shortening at all with the white chocolate so I didn't want to make the white chocolate too runny. I didn't have any issues and was very pleased with the results.

So good! How can you go wrong with chocolate and strawberries? I made these just as written, but my bag of chocolates was only 12oz, so I only used 1.5 Tablespoons of shortening. Turned out GREAT!

Great! I just wanted to try this out, so I went with a 1/4th recipe. I followed the recipe and but did not bother with the toothpicks or Styrofoam - I just put it on parchment paper.  I also dipped dried fruit. My son is home from college and this is a big favorite for him. It is nice to be able to do it, without buying the special melting chocolate - some of which is not great quality. I melted it to just melting (still has some small lumps), and then took it off the stove, but left it in the double boiler, which kept the chocolate noce and soft.

Easiest dessert to make by far and impresses the crowd!  Simply delicious!  I don't use the toothpicks and styrofoam.  I just dip by holding the stem or leaves then gently scrape off the exess chocolate on  one side of the berry on the inside of my double boiler bowl and place them on wax paper.

Something tasted slightly "off" about the chocolate.  I attribute this to the shortening.  Next time, I would take another reviewer's advice and make it without shortening.  In my experience, the addition of shortening-- a very unhealthy hydrogenated substance that most animals won't eat-- rarely benefits a recipe.

These are great!!!  I especially found the tip about using two pots to make a double boiler.  I tried it and it was great!!!  The other great tip was to take the chocolate off the heat when half of it was melted.  YUM!!!

I just tried this recipe and it was so simple and delicious! Don't let fear of working with chocolate prevent you from trying this recipe. Also, since there will be plenty of chocolate sauce left after the 1 lb of strawberries try dipping other fruits. In my opinion you can dip almost anything in chocolate and I'll try it! :-)

These were definitely the most delicious chocolate strawberries I have ever tasted! The chocolate turned out nice and smooth and the berries were sweet and juicy, totally easy for parties and valentines gifts. This is a recipe I would recommend to all my friends. It was so easy that my kids helped to make them the whole way.

I've also used golden delicious apples with this, instead of strawberries.  Just be careful to cover all of the actual fruit; it will oxidize quickly otherwise.  I would also recommend refrigerating the chocolate covered berries for a few hours before serving.

PERFECT! I used this to cover strawberries, bananas, graham crackers, and almonds. They came out perfect. I've tried melting just chocolate on a double boiler, like other reviewers have said, but the shortening definitely makes all the difference.

Sooo AWESOME and SUPER easy!! I melted my chocolate chips at half power , stopping and stirring about 1 1/2 min. until all chips are melted. then stirred in the shortening. I used the store brand and the turned out awesome!! White chocolate burns really easy, I would use half power and stir every 45 seconds until melted and add shortening.

This was an extraordinarily easy to follow recipe and turned out to be spectacular! I didn't use exactly 16oz. of milk chocolate chips... Instead I used an 11.5 bag of milk chocolate chips and a dash from another bag with the 2tbs of shortening and it turned out very well. I put the shortening in fist, let it melt, then the chips. The strawberries turned out perfect! They look and tasted fantastic! Thanks!

i love making these.  i don't use this recipes though.  I have found it easier to just use chocolate chips microwaved for about a minute.  at 30 seconds i stir it to make sure that the chocolate isn't overheated. if the chocolate gets dry, then you can add a bit of veggie oil to make it liquid again.  i also just lay them on a piece of wax paper to dry, and then drizzle with some melted white chocolate.

For years I used brown chocolate, but now I use white chocolate. Oh my goodness, if you haven't tried white then do so. It's nice to offer both, very impressive.

These are sooooo good and the recipe is easy. I made these for our Mother's Day Tea for church yesterday and they got rave reviews. I used a double boiler but only used 1/2 Tbsp shortening. I took the advice of some of the readers here and also dressed them up by drizzling melted white chocolate on each - a much fancier look, perfect for the tea. Another tip - after dipping in the milk chocolate, you can dip the tip of each strawberry in finely chopped pecans or walnuts for those who love nuts.  Also make sure you allow the strawberries to thoroughly dry after washing them and don't allow water to get into the melted chocolate. I made some more to give to my mother in law for Mother's Day - she is going to love these.  If you have any melted chocolate left over, instead of throwing it away, you can make little candies by placing a little in small paper liners and allow to harden. Top with the white chocolate and sprinkle with nuts if used.

Awesome!!! My family didn't realize I made them, and thought I spent a boat-load of money purchasing at a local bakery. Everyone was more than satisfied.

I made these for my husband, mother and sister for Valentines day. I used Nestles milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-chocolate. Every raved about them. They were and still are begging for more.

This is always a good quick recipe to do for Valentines.  I did this for a dinner party we went to last night but didn't add the shortening which I thought was even better.  Once the strawberries were dipped, I sprinkled chopped pecans on some, red & white candy sprinkles on others and some left plain.  I also dipped banana pieces in the melted chocolate then drizzled peanut butter on each one.  A HUGE HIT!  Mind you, when I make my rumballs I do add veggie oil to thin out the chocolate.

One step is missing.  After the first 4 or 5 dips, the chocolate siezed.  I'm now told by the resident chef that the strawberies had mositure on them. I should have dried them first to make sure they did not.  That neds to be mentioned somewhere

I made these for my daughter's 18th Birthday dinner. I served them with chocolate cupcakes with strawberry frosting. I used semi-sweet morsels instead of milk chocolate and used butter instead of shortening. I've been making chocolate covered strawberries with candi-quik for years but wow, these were so much better. The toothpicks make it so much easier to dip and I actually left them in for serving. Thanks for a great recipe! I can't wait to try this with white chocolate!

Amazing! I hve never made chocolate covered strawberries before.  I followed the tip about not letting the pot where the chocolate is melting touch the boiling water and I used a large dark Belgium chocolate bar from Trader Joe's.. PERFECT and beautiful.

This did not set up as well for me. I think maybe because I used butter because I did not have shortening. I will try again with shortening. I think overall it was a pretty easy recipe for what I wanted. I made the perfect chocolate cake from hershey's and made a chocolate glaze on top and added these around the cake. All in all it was just ok. thank you!

So good. I made Stuffed Strawberries, and dipped some of them in the chocolate as well. I used my little dipper crock pot and melted the chocolate and shortening in it. That worked really well for me.

GREAT except I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  A little richer taste.  I decided not to use the toothpicks (awkward for dipping).  I just held at leaves and dipped.  I will make these again soon.  I am thinking of using these for Valentine's presents.

So delicious yet so simple. I melt my chocolate in the microwave and stir it ever 10 seconds. It usually takes about 1 minutes to melt 16oz of chocolate to the right consistency.   So much cheaper then buying chocolate covered strawberries at Godiva ($4.50 ea.) You can make about 40 for just under $10 with this recipe.  You should definitely try this recipe out!

The best dessert I have made by far and the easiest! I followed the recipe precisely except I cut the leaves because I found it easier to eat. I'm going to keep this recipe and make boxes of chocolate covered stawberries for everyone for x-mas! It's that good!

I didn't use shortening(it just freaks me out) so I wasn't able to keep the strawberries out for very long without them melting. Instead I just covered them with chocolate, froze them for about 30 min, and served them with heart shaped pancakes and syrup for a fabulous Mother's Day breakfast. I probably couldn't have taken them out of the house since they lacked shortening so definitely use the shortening if you plan on transporting them. If not, just freeze them! They're divine with dark chocolate but I just don't like milk chocolate.

The strawberries came out great.  It was very easy to do.  However, I had problems storing them overnight.  I read that you should refrigerate them but then I read that you shouldn't refrigerate them.  So I didn't and they leaked on the bottom.  They still tasted great but didn't look very good.  I guess I'll try refrigerating them next time.

Super easy to make.  I've tried making these before with just chocolate (no shortening OR paraffin) and couldn't figure out why the texture was off.  Obviously now I know what I was missing!  So yummy.  Oh, and the tip to dry them in styrofoam is great, they look much prettier.

Delicious! I used butter and milk in place of shortening. I could not find my double boiler, so I used the metal bowl on the pot trick, and it worked out fine. I placed them in the freezer for about 10 minutes to get a quick set, then removed them from the toothpicks and placed on parchment paper. This is a wonderful recipe for a party... high impact and quick!

It was easy, even for a beginner like me.  I microwave 11.5 ounces of Ghiradelli chips at 50% power, stirring every 30 seconds....It really turned out well, thanks to many of your suggestions (including making sure the berries are cold and dry before dipping them into the melted chocolate.

I made them for girlfriend for V-Day, and they were definitely a hit.....

Made with the 11.5 oz bag of choc chips (only sz available) and about 1.5 tsp of shortening.  Melted in the microwave at half power and stirred often-- melted perfectly and went on strawberries great!  Good and easy recipe!

Wow!!! So good and tastes just like a professional made them! There was enough chocolate for 2 pints of strawberries, but I just made chocolate covered blueberries and bananas with the leftovers!

very easy to do for get togethers or to take somewhere, I made them for Christmas, and used green food coloring in white chocolate chips to drizzle over them, then added red sprinkles, very pretty and very good mixture to coat strawberies, dries fast, and "shells" wonderfully!

Wow!  Quick, easy, and beautiful!  I didn't read all the reviews, so I don't know if anyone suggested using half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet morsels.  It was the perfect combination.  I didn't have styrofoam, so tried the colander trick and they were gorgeous.

Made for cooking club event and they went over huge. The milk chocolate were easy and delicious! I tried doing white chocolate, but couldn't really get the chocolate to melt evenly and stay melted. I'll stick with milk chocolate nxt time. yummy

These were really yummy and easy to make.  I used butter as my shortening but I think I will try crisco next time.  The chocolate got a little soft after sitting out for a while.

These were absolutely delicious.  I used a little more than a cup of chips and 1 tablespoon of shortening - it was more than enough for a pint of strawberries.

Awesome, but really, how hard was this to mess up? Melt chocolate, dip strawberries, enjoy. 

I stole someone else's idea and drizzled white chocolate over the dipped strawberries. It was a really nice effect.

For taste it's a 5 stars. But I think there is a way to have the chocolate less thick, mine was  very thick and sometimes was hard to get the strawberry out with out pulling off the stem. But really chocolate and strawberries, what's not to like!

Good if you make them as directed, in a double boiler.  I tried to use the microwave to melt the chocolate (as someone else had suggested) and it got so messed up I had to start all over again.  I good recipe for your kids to help with.

Very Good Recipe. I used one tablespoon butter, 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a tad of milk. I used a whisk to stir the chocolate mixture, and it turned out really smooth.

I prepare these quite frequently and don't see the need for the shortening.  It just adds more calories.  This is an over abundance of chocolate however one can always use extra chocolate.  Double dip them!  Use that extra chocolate to cover the hole after you fill them with liquor!

Always a crowd pleaser. I like to decorate them with white chocolate or dip them into different toppings (granola, nuts, coconut etc...). Why pay $5 for one strawberry when you can make a whole batch of them yourself for the same cost?

This was so easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser. I've made 3 batches in 3 days. I found that I can make 2 pounds of strawberries with each recipe and still have some leftover for pretzels. I thought it would be messy and a pain to make but it sure wasn't. Thanks! =  )

This recipe is awesome, simple to make and easy to halve.  Use the best chocolate you can find, which in my case was Ghiradelli's.  It was so yummy, and perfect for a romantic weekend.  Instead of sticking the dipped strawberries on wax paper, you can manipulate the strawberry with two toothpicks and place it leaf side down on the waxed paper.

THIS DEFINITLEY EARNED ITS STARS!  I made it for my husband as part of our anniversary dinner--something romantic, I thought.  He doesn't even like strawberries, and he said, "I don't really like strawberries, but I think I could start eating them now!"  He watched as I made them.. and used the idea of drying them on styrofoam-- no flat spots!!! He said, "You never cease to amaze me."  VERY EASY!!! YOU WILL LOVE THEM!!  I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips, stuck the toothpicks in the empty egg-carton, wrapped them up in parchment paper in a gold-foil box... I was impressed w/ myself!  Total prep-time and clean-up was about 30 minutes.

I'm sure this recipe is very good, but I ended up using Wilton Candy melts, in my crockpot set to low. I did pump it up to high for a couple minutes to get the melting going, but then backed it off down to low again, and stirred to help. I had several very large berries, and washed and dried them gently with paper towels. I had nothing but success with the crock pot, and dry berries. I think the styrofoam idea is great, and though my berries were to large to toothpick to it, I will do it next time. I dipped in dark chocolate and then made swirls and designs and drizzles with melted Wilton White Candy Melts. I made these for Mother's Day and they got rave reviews. So easy, so elegant.

I was pressed for time so I just put some chips in the microwave and put on half power for one minute. Stirred and it was perfect. Have to work quick with the dipping but I was doing five pounds of strawberries for a party instead of just one. Also made a batch with white chocolate only and served both side-by-side, calling them "Black and White Strawberries" on my wine tasting party menu. They were part of a line up of foods that match perfectly with California merlot. They looked and tasted great.

Yum! So delicious! We dipped them twice, but once is really all that's needed. The chocolate seemed to overpower the taste of the strawbrries when dipped twice. Great recipe and it couldn't be easier!

Oh! My guests are still talking about them! I used Guittard(sp?) milk chocolate chips and Ghiradelli white chocolate as the drizzle.  I also dipped first in white, then cooled in the fridge to double dip into the milk chocolate for a layered look.  I had so much chocolate left over that I took the blueberries we had and skewered them onto toothpicks (about 2 or 3 per pick) and dipped those into the chocolates for "blueberry buttons" which were also delish! Put a metal mixing bowl over the saucepan w/ boiling water as my makeshift "double broiler."

I have made these twice in the last week for two different parties and they were the first things eaten.  The toothpick and styrofoam idea is a winner.  Make sure strawberries are completely dry for chocolate to stick.

Ok, I got bored this afternoon, so I jumped on the computer and stumbled upon this. I had to adjust the recipe because I only had 8 strawberries (wasn't planning on doing this) and a leftover Easter bunny. so... I melted my bunny and dipped the strawberries in it was YUMMY! I had a little leftover chocolate so I put a handful of mixed nuts in my pan and made nut clusters. VERY YUMMY! thanks kitten!!!

This is hands down the easiest recipe for chocolate dipped strawberries out there. It is actually fool proof if you can follow directions. I have added 1/2 tsp of almond extract for a unique flavor from time to time. If you do not succeed the first time give it a second chance because it's to good to pass up.

Chocolate strawberries are very easy to make....simply melt the chocolate with half a teaspoon of canola oil(or any vegetable oil) in the microwave just
until the chocolate (I've used choc chips and they work very well) is
melted.  Dip the strawberries in the choc and lay on a waxpaper-lined
cookie sheet.  Cool in the refrigerator until the choc is set and then
melt some white choc chips.  I put the melted white choc chips into a
ziplock plastic bag.  Snip off one corner and drizzle the white choc
onto the choc-dipped strawberries and vola you have a beautiful masterpiece!

Delicious and easy!  However, white chocolate has to be treated differently than dark/milk.  My white chocolate covered strawberries looked horrendous because it hardened so it was basically beautiful strawberries with globs of white.  Still tasted great!

This was my first time making these.  I didn't want to use lard, so I tried light corn syrup with the chocolate, terrible.  I ended up using butter, letting it melt first then mixed the chocolate in with it.  Be careful to not overcook, cause it will get thick.  Probably will try to make these again with modifications.  The people I made this for said they tasted good!

Easier than I thought, and faster! I also used drained and dried Marachino cherries, stems attached. I put them out in the cool garage for a few minutes and they hardened quickly. I used a four oz package of semi sweet Ghirardelli chocolate along with the milk choc disks. I may increase the amount of it next time since I love a darker chocolate. 16 oz of chocolate made about 24 huge strawberries and 24 cherries. Also, I sprinkled some non-parrells on some of the strawberries right after I dipped it instead of using the white candy swirls. I'm making these again!

Not going to be near as hard on this recipe as some others were.  Recipe should be halved for 1 pound of strawberries.  You can learn this by reading the reviews first, but a lot of people, like myself, don't always do that.  The next day the chocolate forms a hard shell and falls apart, the shortening could be increased, or add more butter to help keep chocolate softer.

I made this for my wife for Valentine's Day today and it was better than anything I could buy. I found large, sweet strawberries with the stem and used milk chocolate bars. I followed previous remarks and melted the shortening in the microwave and then added the chocolate bars. I microwaved the chocolate for 25 seconds and stirred to blend and kept this process until it was melted well. Strawberries were dipped in the chocolate and I placed them on parchment paper and in the fridge to cool and set. I also had cut-up fresh pineapple and dip it in the chocolate as well. They were delicious!  Had a hard time keeping my son from eating them up before my wife came home. I will never buy store bought chocolate-covered strawberries again!

Always make some of these around Valentine's Day.  Instead of dipping them in the chocolate, I "paint" them using a pastry brush.  In my opinion, it is much less messy and I can hold them gently by the stems..never a chance of them coming off of toothpick!

We did this with both strawberries and pineapple chunks, using bittersweet chocolate. It was SO GOOD! The only thing was that the chocolate got lumpy with the pineapple chunks, so when we do it again we'll sqeeze out some of the juice before we dip the pineapple.

These were super easy and tasty.  They made a nice, thick coating for the strawberries.  I only wish that my strawberries were a little sweeter.  I think I will also try this with other fruit as I love chocolate covered anything!

I made a tray of the chocolate covered strawberries for our family reunion.  Out of this world!  The only problem was 3 pints of berries was not enough.  Many did not get to try them because they are magic .... POOF.... they disappear!

This worked really well. We used some semi-sweet chips from another bag, and I think it made it a little less sweet but not bitter.

This was the easiest chocolate strawberry recipe I've ever made! I was quite worried that it would be much too messy and it turned out so easy! If you're careful, there is absolutely no mess in your kitchen. My guests raved on and on about how much it complimented the dessert (angel food cake). Thank you so much for this recipe!

These are always a hit! Super simple, decadent and very impressive looking. I try to use real milk chocolate when I can, but they are delicious either way. Also, I like to drizzle them with white or dark chocolate making for a pretty presentation! :)

Worked out well and tasted great. Didn't have any problems with the chocolate. Coated the strawberries well and dried to a nice finish. I didn't have any extra chocolate left over though like some of the other reviewers. I actually ended up having some uncovered strawberries because I ran out!

I made these twice and both times they looked good and tasted good, but the chocolate just breaks right off the strawberry when you take a bite. I used good chocolate and good strawberries, so it was definitely yummy!

I made these today.  I did not have a double boiler, fondue pot or any such thing.  I took my big soup pot and filled it a few inches deep with water, took my smaller soup pot and put it inside with the ingredients.  The chocolate and shortening melted fast and did not burn, was nice and smooth.  I grabbed a hold of the strawberry leaves, dipped away and placed them on wax paper.  Within a couple hours they were set.  Some of them while they were still hot I sprinkled coconut on them, that was good and pretty.  I used store brand semi sweet mini chocolate chips in a 12 oz bag.  Will make these again since I have leftover chocolate, or maybe use it for pretzels.

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were fabulous!  It was so simple.  I only used 1 pound of Strawberries (16 total) and a 12oz bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet choc chips.  I eliminated the butter/shortening completely and didn't miss it.  I placed them right on wax paper and they were delicious.  Enjoy!

So easy ~ so good.  Turned the the heat to low after it started to melt.  The chocolate was perfectly melted for at least a half hour.  Followed recipe and used Ghirarhelli milk chocolate ~ they were sinful!  Will never buy chocolate covered strawberries again!

I tried this today.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but the chocolate mixture was too thick and then wouldn't set after dipping the strawberries. Tastes great. I just couldn't make them look like the picture.

I loved this recipe and make it every year around Valentine's Day! Very simple & simply delicious. I use a really high quality dark chocolate or any kind of dark chocolate that is at least 60% dark chocolate - which makes it even better and it cuts down on the fat & sugar!!

I made these for a banquet that had about 100 people attending.  They were the very first thing to disappear from the dessert table.  I made two different varieties.  In one I used semi-sweet morsels.  In the other, I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels swirled with white chocolate.  They both turned out great!

I had only the bare essentials for this recipe; a small pot, butter flavor shortening and store brand chocolate chips... and wow! I melted the chocolate ever so slowly after first melting the shortening. I have toothpicks, but was really happy with just using the leaves, rolling in the chocolate and laying them on parchment paper on a baking sheet to set in the fridge. Simple and amazing.

These were awesome, my best advice is to have everything ready, strawberries clean and dry, styrofoam ready, then get chocolate melted and work quickly.  The reason is because it was kind of hard to keep the chocolate at the right temp.  Also I used someone's idea to melt a little white chocolate in a zip bag with a little shortening and cut the corner off to drizzle over and it worked perfectly!

Gets the job done, but the vegetable oil separates after a while and oozes out of the strawberry.  Also, not the best flavor/texture.

using plain milk chocolate was too sweet for an elegant dinner. instead, i used part semisweet part bittersweet chocolate and then drizzled some white choc.

This recipe was simple and worked perfectly for my chocolate covered strawberries!! I do not own a double boiler so I just put a small amount of water in a pot and placed the chocolate and shortening directly into a smaller pot. Then I put this pot into the larger one with the water. It melted quickly and easily and tasted great. I dipped each strawberry and placed them on some parchment paper. This went directly into the fridge and then after it set (20 minutes or so) I placed them directly on my cheesecake and used the leftover chocolate to drizzle the entire cheesecake!

Also, like another reviewer said, the strawberries should be dried off with paper towels before dipping.  I had made chocolate frosting and had leftover in the freezer, which i heated in the microwave, hulled & washed berries,dried them then dipped in the chocolate frosting and set to dry, came out great.

This was a great recipe. The only problem I had was that it made waaay too much chocolate for 1 lb of strawberries. I ended up making chocolate-toffee candies and chocolate covered pretzles too..which were both great :)

These were great.  I used a little less then 2 Tbsp of shortening because the bag of chips was only 11 oz.  I didn't have a double boiler or a stainless steel bowl, so i melted them in the microwave at half power for one minute, then stirred. i then microwaved then for 30 seconds at half power, stirred and repeated that one more time. They were almost completely melted, so I just kept stirring until they were smooth. The chocolate was perfect, not clumpy at all, I think the shortening really helps make it smooth.

I agree with other reviewer's regarding the use of good chocolate.  Instead of strawberries, I prefer to use raspberries. I had these at a wedding and the taste was superb !

So simple and delicious.  My 4 yr old helped me make these and he had a blast.  I do not use the double boiler method since I hate trying to hold a bowl over a pan of boiling water while trying to stir which is what I do since I do not have an actually double boiler.  I melted the butter and chocolate over very low heat stirring constantly.  This does tend to thicken the chocolate more so I thinned it with a little milk.  It also helped cool the mixture so I did not bother with toothpicks just picked up the strawberry and dunked it.  My son loved doing this plus he got to lick his fingers when we were all done!

I've never made these before, but they're super easy. And I would totally make them again! I did replace the shortening for butter. And drizzled a bit of white chocolate on the top.

I had a very difficult time with the melted chocolate - it began to harden up after a minute or so of melting. Maybe there is something about melting chocolate that wasn't covered in the recipe. I tried a second time, working as quickly as I could. Even then, the chocolate was very thick and difficult to work with. I wouldn't make this again.

These strawberriew were easy and fun to make.  I used fresh strawberries that I just picked from a local farm and the taste was devine! I served them at a party and everyone enjoyed them.  They were all eaten in minutes.  I got creative and rolled a few in crushed toffee and those were the first to go! I had two problems with the presentation.  I did not allow them to cool on the sticks as suggested.  Instead I placed them on wax paper and there was a lot of chocolate left behind when I peeled them off.  Next time I will try the stick method.  The other problem was that I served them on a very hot summer evening.  As soon as they were out of the fridge the chocolate softened and they did not have that "snap" when you bite into them. I really like them best right out of the fridge!

Awesome! My sister and I made these for a church function at our house and they were a big hit, and rather cheap to make too. The only changes I made was not using the butter, and I used both white and regular chocolate chips. Mmmm! Definately a 5 star recipe!

I made this with the shortening and while I didn't taste one myself everyone said they were great and I do think the shortening helped to melt the chocolate and with the dipping.  I just put them on waxed paper to set rather than the styrofoam as suggested here.  I did melt some white chips with a tiny bit of shortening and used a wooden skewer to drizzle the chocolate on top and I think it makes them look really special. This is a very easy recipe with professional-looking results.

Easy and so tasty! Made this for dessert to our Valentine's Day dinner. I used an electric fondue pot to mix the shortening and chocolate. Worked great! What a beautiful presentation! Will 100% make again. My only recommendation, be sure to line the dish with wax paper before setting berries in the refrigerator. Otherwise, the chocolate will stick to the dish. Thanks!

Perfectly simple, and simply perfect. Served as part of a Valentine's Day dessert. After dipping in milk chocolate and letting that harden, I drizzled white chocolate over them. Served alongside a chocolate tarte, dusted with icing sugar on large glass plates. A beautiful and elegant finish to a meal, and easy too! Thanks very much.

3rd time's the charm. I tried microwaving with shortening and chocolate chips and burnt the chocolate twice. So, I read reviews and tried using the bowl inside the boiling pan of water. This worked great with milk not shortening. I only needed a dozen strawberries so I used 1/2 bag (about 6 ozs) of choc chips and 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk. The chocolate came out creamy and smooth . You must stir constantly while melting.

Awesome and easy!  Dipped in semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate.  Made for Valentine's Day for my sweetie and he thought I bought them!

OMG!  What a great recipe!!  I have never made chocolate covered strawberries before because I thought I had to have a double boiler, and that it was time consuming.  Wow was I wrong.  This recipe couldn't have made it easier.  I used a 16 oz bag of chips, and was able to do aprox. 35 medium sized strawberries.  I don't have a double boiler, so I used the microwave method with a little less than 2 tablespoons oil, and a glasss pie dish at 70%. I splurged on Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips.  I also drizzled white chocolate over the milk chocolate.  They turned out perfect, like I spent a lot of money making or buying them!  I know they are going to be a big hit.

My 5 year old daughter is starting to experiment with food. I let her do this all on her own (I melted the chocolate) and it turned out great. virtually impossiable to mess up and it takes literally no time at all. Great recipe!

Awesome!! I loved this. I made them for my daughters one year birthday party. I made some with plain chocolate, i dipped others in coconut, and chopped walnuts. They were a hit. Served them the same day as I prepared them, otherwise they would of made the chocolate run as other reviewers mentioned.

I just made these over the week-end and they were YUMMY and EASY. They disappeared in about 10 minutes and were a huge hit with the kids. Was in a hurry and put them in the refrigerator to harden. Also, left the toothpicks in making them easy to pick up.

I just made these and they were terrific. I didn't have a double broiler so I microwaved the chips for around a minute at medium heat in a glass dish.  They were a little messy to handle, and some of them smudged, but  the taste was fantastic.

These are great.. If you want to make them a tad bit sweeter cut a little slice out of the end of the strawberry and add cream cheese... Makes these strawberries even better

The strawberries I used were too large to be supported by one toothpick, so I created a tripod effect with three toothpicks. This is a time consuming project, much longer than I had anticipated. Allow yourself time to experiment, especailly if you've never made these before!

Very simple and fun to make. All of my guests loved them. Using the styrofoam makes it a little messy, but it looks a lot better than just laying them on wax paper.

Very, very easy and tasty! I used semi-sweet chocolate squares because that is what I had on hand. Yum!! My family keeps requesting these for take along treats on picnics. I make them the night before and they are nice and firm by picnic time so they travel well packed in a cooler.

They turned out beautiful! I gad a gard time keeing them on the toothpicks though. I had very large strawberries, so I made a tripod out of toothpicks. They were very good, and I will make them again,

This was a smash hit!!!! made these for a party of 30 and everyone raved about the presentation!! I used a slow cooker to melt the chocolate and it made it smooth and silky! I then melted white chocolate and drizzled it over but this can be challenging! you have to make the chocolate thin enough to drizzle so I added canola oil instead of shortening. I also used colorful plastic party stix to stick them and that added extra color. Awesome!!!Yummy!!

I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. It was so easy and it tasted sooooo good! My boyfriend was very impressed. I bought the long stem strawberries for a more elegant look. I also made my own double boiler by putting a smaller pot into a bigger one. I used the styrofoam and for the most part it worked, but you have to be real careful that you don't shove the toothpick too far into the stawberry, or the stawberry may fall once you put the rest of the toothpick into the styrofoam, some of the berries were so big that they tilted and leaned against one another. That was the only problem I had, I may use skewers next time. But overall, it was very good and I will make them again.

I made these last night and they were so easy! My fiancee did most of the work himself and didn't mess anything up! I expected a huge mess and a lot of work, but it was neither! We didn't care about them drying perfectly (since we were just eating them by ourselves) so we let them cool on wax paper.

These were good, but I had trouble with the styrofoam. I used a take out box, which didn't support my heavy strawberries. Next time I will stack a few plates like someone else suggested. Make sure you dip fast, because the chocolate will turn into frosting quick!

I am making chocolate covered strawberris for a Valentine's Day wedding and tried doing so the other night as I had never made them. They turned out great. I used the almond chocolate bark for dipping but couldn't come up with a way to dry them that wouldn't mess the shape up. I did come up with using a corn cob holder to make the dipping easier but this is a great idea and has to be so much faster than holding them till dry enough to lay them down. Thanks...:)

High on presentation and taste; takes little time and little skill!  I dipped them and put them right on wax paper.  (I didn't stick them in styrofoam.) They were gone when w/in minutes of being put out. Thanks - great recipe

This is one of my favorite deserts to make, and it's so easy. I don't change the recipe a bit, but I always have a lot of chocolate left over. I then raid the kitchen looking for other food to chocolate cover! Thanks so much!

Very easy to do. The recipe was even easier because I melted the chocolate in the microwave (I only made about a dozen or so strawberries). I like to use a fondue fork for dipping the strawberries in the chocolate and double dip the strawberries so they have a real good coat of chocolate on them. I loved how decorative and professional looking the white chocolate made them too. YUM! Thank you!! :)

Melting chocolate is hard! I read a guide on how to do it before doing it and it helped me out. One cool thing I found out from this recipe is that the shortening makes the chocolate not fully solidify at room temperature. It will stay kind of soft. Other people here have mentioned that you don't need the shortening to melt the chocolate and that' true but I like it better with the shortening. Here's why, when you bite into the strawberry and the chocolate is just a little bit softer than fully hardened chocolate, it doesn't break up and fall off the strawberry. It will stay on the strawberry. My friends who ate them with me appreciated that :)

This recipe for the chocolate coating works wonderfully...it's probably a bit much for a pint of strawberries, but that makes it easier to dip...just find some other stuff (pretzels, etc) that are smaller to finish it off.

I loved these! I exchanged the shortening for coconut oil and it melted all together and even added a bit of a yummy coconut-y flavor! I dipped them, let them cool at room temp (about 10 mins) and dipped them again, and then drizzled them! Sooo delicious. Of course I will make them again!

These were a hit for my hubbys birthday.  Also, so easy to prepare & easy on the checkbook - we will be making these often!  I used Hershey's chocolate chips, half semi sweet & half milk chocolate.  They did not turn out overly sweet this made the perfect balance of sweetness.  On the advice of other reviews, I made sure the boiling water did not touch the pan holding the chocolate.  I melted the shortening first then added half of the chocolate chips.  After the first half of chips melted I turned off the stove and added the remaining chips.  Stirring constantly they all blended & melted together perfectly.  I did not have any problems with the consistency of the chocolate.  This is the first time that I have ever tried making chocolate covered strawberries so I was quite clumsy while dipping the berries & took longer than I probably should've bust still no problems with the chocolate.  I absolutely reccommend this recipe!  Easy peasy even for beginners.  I also do not own a double broiler & just used a regular pot w/ a stainless steel bowl that fit almost 1/2 way down into it but not quite.  Get creative!  There are endless ways to use this recipe!

Important to remove the chocolate from heat once melted. It becomes nice and silky, and cool enough so you don't get a nasty burn if it drips on you. Also had trouble keeping the strawberries on the toothpick--they were clean & dry, but quite ripe and soft. Wound up scooping the chocolate with a rubber spatula & swirling the spatula around the strawberries while holding them sideways by the toothpick. Basically, I frosted them. Not as pretty as the professional ones, but so delicious!

Personally I don't care much for chocolate cover strawberries but, my girlfriend loved them and that's who they were for. Make sure you set on wax paper or something nonstick as the chocolate on the strawberries will stick to the plate in my case and half or more of the chocolate will come off or be stuck to the plate, I knew this but it was worse than I thought it would be. Also the shortening was put in with the chocolate to help it stick better to the strawberries.

They look amazing! I had to trial/error the first two strawberries cause I didn't realize if they were wet from cleaning, the choco wouldn't take. Silly me! The chocolate had a very strong shortening smell which put me off a bit, but it tastes fine! I think the boyfriend will enjoy these!

I just finished making a whole berry strawberry pie and had leftover strawberries.  I looked at this and was a little frightened, as once before I tried to melt chocolate and it failed miserably.  I put my pan on the stove on low heat and melted the shortening, then added the chocolate chips, worked beautifully.  I called my family in to try my  "new recipe", no one came...they are  cautious  over my attempts to make them guinea pigs.  My 12 year old finally came in and devoured them saying "its a keeper mom".  Happy Mothers day to me!!

Very straight forward and worked perfectly.  I melted the butter first and then added my chocolate (I used white chocolate).  Then I removed it from the heat once it was mostly melted and stirred it until it was melted to the perfect consistency.  Worked wonderfully.

I just want to say something about melting chocolate. I have used a double boiler to melt chocolate for years with no trouble at all. Just have a time amount of water in the bottom pan and keep it on low/medium heat and the chocolate will melt just fine. What seizes up chocolate is when water mixes with the chocolate so just be extra careful to avoid this.

Tried both double boiler and microwave...stick to the microwave.  AWESOME. I have made them 4 times in 2 weeks. (I am now known for them!)   Easy and beautiful. I didn't have any styrafoam so I just laid them on wax paper. No one cares about the "flat" part of the strawberry after it dries...it still tastes like chocolate.

Great, fast, easy and simple recipe. For more style, you can double dip (first time in white chocolate on one side, then cool, then dip in regular chocolate on both sides, with the white chocolate side slanted to form a "V" then chill) for a tuxedo effect. Very cute!

I LOVE these, they are so simple to make! a lot of people make this recipe even harder than it should be!...  I buy chocolate chips in the bunk section at the store, all i do is put a ton of chocolate chips in a microwaveable tuperware container, i put it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time, depending on how many chocolate chips you use depends on how long it takes, but usually I microwave until the middle gets soft and i stir them all together. when the middle is soft you should be good to go... just mix the chocolate chips all together and you don't have to worry about over heating your chocolate, the melted chocolate chips are warm and melt the other chocolate chips that have not melted yet, just let it sit for a few minutes, dip your strawberrys and place on wax paper (I also like to dip fresh bananas, pretzels, nuts, ext.)

It's easy.  It's always good, even if the strawberries are mediocre and store brand chocolate is used.  I love this recipe because it can be simple or fancy, and it's really simple to make.  I agree with other comments that suggested melting the crisco first, and making sure the boiling water does not touch the top pan in the double boiler.

I omitted the shortening from the recipe; the chocolate was thicker to dip still worked out fine.  One tip: I put my dipped strawberries in the freezer to set the chocolate since the temp inside my kitchen was a little warm. BIG MISTAKE! I went off and forgot them in there and ruined the fruit (obviously)...Next time I'll just put them in the fridge.

Delicious. Replaced shortening with cooking oil at a 1:1 ratio, because I didn't have shortening. Also chopped up nuts to add as topping.

A great way to dress these up is to drizzle with honey and then a fine dusting of powdered sugar.  It makes them really pretty plus it tastes great.  Also, if you don't like to temper chocolate, there are bowls of chocolate disks you can buy that melt right in your microwave and are much easier to work with and tastes just as good. You can find them with the baking goods in Wal-mart and most other stores.

I was going to buy a box of chocolate covered strawberries from a website for V-day... but $36 was WAY too much for just 6 strawberries. Using this recipe, I made 24 berries, and 12 chocolate covered grapes for just under $5! They were just as good as store bought! My husband thinks that I spent all day making them, but I only about 20 minutes on the whole project! And clean up was sooooo easy! For a little added flair, I put the berries and grapes together in Valentines Day themed cupcake foils, SO CUTE! Thank you for saving me money and making me look clever!

These were sooo good. I made these for a girlfriend one night while we drank wine. I ended up mixing a little bit of peanut butter into the WHITE chocolate (colored with food coloring) and drizzled it over the strawberries. The subtle taste of peanut better was perfect. We ate as many as we could...we gave up with only 2 strawberries left! YUMM!

I am so happy that I found this recipe!  I am not a huge fan of dessert but chocolate covered strawberries are my weakness!  I cannot believe they are so easy to make.  I will be making these often.  Highly recommended.

I made these two different times for school parties. They looked and tasted great. I do suggest, however, that you use a higher quality brand chocolate chip. I used generic chips the first time, and Nestle's the second time. The second time I made them they were better.

Excellent recipe! This is the second time I have made these, and the first time they were a huge hit. I have used a pyrex dish over a pot with boiling water as a makeshift double boiler, and it was worked just fine. For anyone making them the first time, white chocolate is a bit more difficult to melt than the milk chocolate, and you may need to add a tiny bit more shortening. Also, the first time I made these I used Ghirardelli chocolate chips (white/milk). The second time I used IGA milk chocolate chips...huge difference! Although they set, the chocolate did not set as well. Spend the few extra dollars and buy the better brand chocolate...its worth it in the end!

I made my own modifications to this recipe to meld with what I had available.  I used both semi-sweet and 60% dark cocoa chocolate chips and 2 tbsp. shortening.  I melted it in a metal bowl over barely simmering water.  it allowed me time to dip all the strawberries without taking it off the heat and then re-melting it.    It tastes awesome.  I used the 10 minute quick set that others suggested.  This is a great recipe to mix and match different chocolates according to your taste!

These are perfect. I did use milk chocolate chunks not chips but I am sure they taste the same. We also drizzled white chocolate on some of them! Perfect for valentines day or any day really.

I'm a little late telling you this but I made lots of these strawberries for Valentines day. Everyone loved them. My mother in law was very crazy about them. She had recieved some from work and these totally out did the others. Funny thing is-the other strawberries cost 13.99 for 6. I didn't even have that much in mine and I gave alot more than 6 to my mother in law and mother. I suggest anyone who likes strawberries and chocolate will love these!

So good and easy.  Tastes way better than the little containers of chocolate that you buy to dip fruit.  It makes such a perfect, smooth finish.

I'll never use the melting chips at the craft store again! The shine, taste, and presentation are store bought quality! Made as written w/ butter flavored shortening. I didnt put one batch in the fridge and just let them cool on the counter before serving and these were MUCH softer than the batch that went in the fridge for later. When making again, I'll prob. skip the fridge and serve immediately.

Great recipe.  I could not believe how easy and quick, it was to make these great strawberries.  I really think the shortening made a difference with the consistency of the chocolate.  I was afraid to try the butter and I am a butter person after reading the reviews and people said the butter made the consistency hard. Will experiment with the syringes and flavoring next time.  I just made it according to the directions.  Double yum on these strawberries.

If you have left over chocolate that you don't want to waste, freeze dipped strawberries to set, then dip again.  I use corn on the cob sticks rather than toothpicks as they can handle the weight better.  Only drawback is that they are more difficult to push through the styrofoam.  I use medium size strawberries rather than large as that also alleviates some of the weight problems.

Great recipe.  However, I think half the chocolate and shortening called for would cover a pound of strawberries.  I had a lot of the chocolate mixture left over.  Wasted.

Why pay an obscene amount of money for gourmet berries when you can make them easily in your own kitchen?  This recipe is very simple and the berries taste and look fantastic!  Add multi-colored sprinkles or nuts to make them look even more fun.

These are delicious! I first had these at a wedding in 1998, and at my own wedding in 1999, they topped my husband's "groom cake". When I make them, I'm reminded of my wedding day! Thanks for a simple, but great recipe!

great recipe. like everyone else, i had too much chocolate (and i even cut the recipe down by 6 oz or so!), so i looked around the kitchen and saw a can of cashews. i threw a bunch in the remaining chocolate, stirred it up, and spread them on a plate to cool. both the strawberries and the cashews were delicious. i made them for my boyfriend for valentine's day.

I have made these without adding shortening or wax and with. I like the results much better with adding the shortening or wax. The strawberries have a nice shine to them. Looks like I bought them from a speciality shop. Thanks for the great recipe.

The chocolate was very good paired with the strawberries but it dripped off and crumbled. 
Overall, Pretty good.

These were great and so easy to make!  I made them for our bible class last night and everyone enjoyed them.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and they still tasted wonderful.

Absolutely sensuous at our house ;-) Double dip with white and dark chocolate! I love this recipe this time of year, we have a ton of pick your own strawberry places around here. You can get long stems on your strawberries so you won't need toothpicks; just place on wax paper. Talk about fun feeding this to your special someone! Just add a bottle of champagne......

These were excellent.  I made them for a reception, and people went back for second plates to take home! I also drizzled white chocolate on top after the milk chocolate had been in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.  Delicious!

Not that this recipe needs another "5 star" rating to increase status! How fabulous! The strawberries turned out delicious and perfect--very chocolaty! Mixed semi-sweet with milk chocolate and easily coated 2lbs strawberries (or anything else, I imagine!).
This is LOTS better and cheaper than buying the Baker's Dipping Chocolate in the styrofoam cups. These are more expensive and barely cover 1lb fruit. Also, the foam cup melts upon heating (scary health hazard!).  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

I made these this afternoon and they turned out great!  I used semi sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  I also rolled a few in crushed hazelnuts, and if I would of had mini chocolate chips, I would of tried to roll some in those too.  I used swekers and a stryofoam brick, but be careful to distribute them evenly becuase I didn't on one brick and knocked it over and ruined a few strawberries, whoops!  Everyone is also impressed with these!

Great Recipe. I have made it twice now and have had rave reviews. People just love them!!! The first time I made them with a double broiler. The second time I melted the chocolate in the crock pot as several others suggested. Both work well. Since I had a very busy day the second time I was making them, I put the chocolate and shortening in the crock pot while I was gone. When I got home, it was ready to dip. The first time I used wooden toothpicks, the second time I used those heavy duty appetizer picks. They worked much better!! They were much more stable for positioning the strawberries on the upside down styrofoam plates and they are longer. I stacked about 4 plates. This is a very impressive dessert to bring to a pot luck!!!!

Very simple to make. Although I did not have a double boiler so I used two pots one on top of the other (I was luck that one was slightly bigger that the other). I would recommend using high quality chocolate (such as Ghirardelli). The better the chocolate the better the flavor. I also used this to dip cookies in and they taste better that the Strawberries.

very easy - turned out great! I made them for my daughter's wedding. If you make them ahead of time, be sure you have enough refridgerator space because they do need refridgeration if not used within a couple of hours.

what an easy way to make scrumptious treats. i used ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips with ripe strawberries. use the toothpicks if you require a neater presentation but in all honesty, they'll get eaten either way! thanks kit!!

I made these for a party last weekend and they were a hit!  Drizzling with white chocolate is definitely worth the time.  I did 4 1/2 lbs. of berries with 2 bags of chocolate chips.  Took me almost 2 hours, but I found it fun!  Will certainly make again!  Thanks, Kitten!

These are perfect.  I use only 1 tablespoon of the shortening and that works well.  I have never had it get grainy or clump up.  They are the best.

Minimum effort with maximum results. I made 100 of these for my sister's bridal shower. I also drizzled some melted white chocolate over the milk chocolate. Everyone was impressed and amazed. "My" strawberries were the talk of the party. A million thanks!

Quick, easy & delish. I didnâ€™t have chocolate chips on hand, but did have 16oz bag of Merckens chocolate wafers on hand, left over from Christmas baking. I tempered as suggested. Very quick & easy for wonderful results. I did not need to add shortening or butter, maybe Merkens has a higher fat content. Also, as previously noted in another review, recipe made way too much chocolate for 1# of strawberries. Fortunately I had 2 bananas & a pint of blackberries, so I just covered them all. I really hadnâ€™t planned on covering all of the xtras. As much as I love them, my brain & gut tell me I shouldnâ€™t. Next time, and there will be a next time, Iâ€™ll make 1/2 chocolate recipe & more if neede

I was so impressed with the consistency and application of the chocolate. I've made other recipes before (using just chocolate). It seems the Crisco allows me to add a much thicker and smoother layer to each berry. These looked professional.

After dipping in chocolate, gently rolled some in Heath milk chocolate toffee bits. Some in shaved dark chocolate, chopped toasted almonds, and in mini chips.

There's no need to add shortening. It's chocolate perfection to put in microwave for 30 seconds, stir, 30 seconds, stir. You cannot mess it up this way. If you need just a couple of additional seconds, heat in 10 second increments and stir. You can use for strawberries, bananas, almonds with a touch of sea salt on top after it's cooled for a bit. I love dark chocolate best but semisweet or milk is also great.

This is a great, easy recipe for melting chocolate, not only to dip strawberries but anything else that tastes better with some chocolate on it.  I made this exactly as instructed for Mother's Day for our daughter and her family.  Needless to say, none were left.  I did not have time to try adding the white chocolate decorations but will try sometime in the future.

this is pretty good, however, watch out for the chocolate seizing. I went through two bags of chocolate chips before I got it right.

These are a family favorite! To make them a little more special I like to add sprinkles. Easy to make and much cheaper than store-bought!

This was a last minute choice for taking to a holiday party tonight!   It could not have been easier.  I deviated only slightly ~ I used a double boiler, melted my shortening first before adding the chocolate and kept stirring until all the chips were melted.  I used 1/2 milk chocolate chips and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I removed the melted chocolate from the pan into a bowl to roll.   I did not use toothpicks as they are too short.  I used small 4" kebab sticks.   I realized quickly that the melted chocolate was messy so I turned two styrofoam egg cartons upside down and inserted the inverted chocolate covered strawberries into the carton to dry!  Worked great!  I still have to decorate with icing ~ or not ~ and cool before serving later this evening.   Easy peasy  and oh so delicious!  Definitely will make again!  By the way ~ there is plenty of chocolate left over.  I may dip some pineapple chunks, too!

AMAZING! Just a tip, however. I heated up the milk chocolate morsels in a bowl in the microwave and didn't add the shortening and it came out wonderful. Yes, without shortening the chocolate gets that slightly "dusty" appearance when it cools and sits for some time, but that was ok for me. I also melted the white chocolate in 30 second intervals in a glass Pyrex bowl. I used a fork to drizzle irregular strokes of the white chocolate over the strawberries once they cooled from being dipped in the milk chocolate. I had to use a fork to drizzle it bc the white chocolate had a thicker consistency which didn't work in a ziplock bag with a hole in the end. I used the toothpicks in the tops of the strawberries to dip into the milk chocolate in the beginning and flipped them over and stuck in styrofoam to dry. It worked wonderfully. I added some chocolate covered pretzels to the leftover mixture and laid them on a plate's edges to dry. I also added some ground-up walnuts to the freshly filled milk chocolate on some. Delicious!!!! Everyone loved both the strawberries and pretzels. Will be making again soon. Thanks!

These chocolate strawberries were easy to make and delicious! I bought 2, 11.5 oz bags of Ghirardelli chocolate baking chips. In the recipe, I used 1 1/2 cup semi sweet and 1 1/2 cup  milk chocolate  chips.  I used a double boiler and removed the chocolate when it was almost fully melted. I didn't use shortening like the recipe called for. I was going to take the suggestion of others and substitute butter instead, but I was out. Next time, I will use butter and drizzle white chocolate ontop! Definitely a keeper

I loved this recipe. I only used half a bag of chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon of shorting. After dipping them in chocolate I put them in a freezer for 30mins. It came out great!

Instead of using butter, you should probably use milk. I used only butter and chocolate chips and the chocolate was smooth and liquid-like. I added just a little bit of milk and it instantly turned out smooth. The chocolate on my strawberries looked like it was melting off also. Other than that they turned out great!

Just made these as a side for Father's Day dinner. Melted the chips and shortening in the microwave in a glass dish using the microwaves set melt functions. Turned out perfectly smooth. Used the tops of the strawberries as handles for dipping. Set up beautifully. Tastes divine.

So easy to make and yet they are really pretty. I use toothpicks and a large piece of styrofoam to set the chocolate, helps to keep the strawberries covered evenly all the way around.

Exactly what I wanted!  Melted perfectly.  Smooth and glossy when dipped.  Not gloppy!  Set up beautifully!!!  made two batches--one milk chocolate and one semi sweet.  Both perfect.  Followed another tip of melting the shortening first, then adding chocolate.  Used a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup in microwave and it was perfect to melt, mix and dip in.

I used coconut oil instead of shortening, about a teaspoon of oil per half cup of chocolate chips.  I drizzled white chocolate after cooling the dipped berries.  I appreciated the hints from other cooks about not overheating the chocolate.

Because of diabetes in our home, I managed to find sugar free chocolate chips in the bulk section of our grocery store. At $2.29/100 gms, they are expensive but worth it, there is absolutely no taste difference between these and the regular chips. A beautiful treat without feeling deprived.
 Alyssa, I held the strawberries by the stem.

As others suggested, I melted the shortening first and then added the chocolate. I don't have a double boiler, so I just melted it in a pan on the stove. I made these with milk chocolate and white chocolate. Some strawberries I just dipped in chocolate and some strawberries I dipped in chocolate and then rolled in nuts. I served these with a strawberry coulis.

I didnt realize how easy this was! I used 11.5oz each of Ghirardelli milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate, and tollhouse white chocolate for the extra flare. I also used 2tbsp of the shortening. I used a make-shift double boiler (microwaveable plastic bowl inside a pot of water lol) to melt the regular chocolate. 

Then I dipped by hand and placed the strawberries on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet which worked well. To melt the white chocolate I just put the chips in a bowl and placed it in the microwave. Just like another poster I put the melted white chocolate in a zip lock baggie and clipped one end to make a little piping bag to create the extra flare. The strawberries taste so good. Just made these for Thanksgiving! Can't wait to make these again!

Perfect, and perfectly easy. Melted chocolate and shortening together in a glass bowl in the microwave at 50% power for 90 seconds, stirred and then again for 90 seconds. Stirred until solids melted. Had enough chocolate to coat 2 pounds of good-sized strawberries, with some left over. Very happy with this recipe!

Really easy to make and so delicious. I used normal cooking chocolate but was able to temper it without problems. It was however sometimes difficult to turn the strawberry with the toothpick, because the toothpick was too loose.

Awesome!!!  I have never tried to make chocolate covered strawberries before, but these turned out great for a first-timer!!  
Nixed the shortening and used the glass bowl over the sauce pan with the water about 1/2 inch from bottom of glass pan for the double-boiler.  Piped the white chocolate with the ziplock- worked like a charm!  
I need some more practice-definitely not "Shari's Berries" material, but not too bad for the first time!  I know my girlies and hubby will LOVE them!  Thank you everyone for your suggestions!  :)

this was an awesome recipe!! toothpicks worked great! my first time I made chocolate strawberries. My first batch came out great but my second did not due to the fact that steam from my homemade double boiler got into the bowl so beware of that.

This is an awesome recipe! I love the review that suggested making in the microwave at around  70% pour, a minute or so at a time. It is easier than the store-bought chocolate made for dipping. These are so easy and delicious. Love it!

Yummy! We only needed a few strawberry's to go with our dessert, so I just used a little semi-sweet choc & butter in micro on 1/2 power about 15 sec at a time and stir.Was perfect.Definantly bring to room temp befor eating.

Great recipe!  I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips.  I microwaved the chocolate in a glass bowl for 2 1/2 minutes on 70% power, as recommended by another user, and it worked perfectly!  Will be making these again for sure!

Since I don't have a double-boiler, I put a glass bowl on top of simmering water.  Making this dish this way is tricky since I don't have much control over the temperature.  After dipping about 6 strawberries, the temperature of the bowl gets too hot and the chocolate starts getting gloppy and grainy.  To fix the consistency of the chocolate, I have to add a little bit of cold water (to cool the chocolate down) and stir it up again.  I added Amaretto Di Saronno to half of the chocolate.  For the other half, I added Grand Marnier.  Yum.

Very easy and was a really big hit with the family, especially my little 2-year old nephew!! We also sprinkled a few dipped strawberries with some bits of toffee -- those were really good.

Fabulous.  Chocolate chips come in 12 oz bags so I opted to just ignore the missing 4 oz's and they turned out FABULOUS!  There was plenty of chocolate to cover 1 lb of medium size strawberries, I even had a little left over the I used to cover some raspberries.  I can't wait to surprise my man with these Valentines Day.

Good... but make sure you use the freshest strawberries possible because otherwise they go south pretty quickly.  I wasn't fond of the shortening used in this recipe.

I made these for my husband's 60th birthday party. We had 40 people over and I wanted to make dishes that people love, but are usually expensive to buy ready made and this was one of them. This was in addition to other desserts that we made. I used 3 pounds of strawberries and just put them on wax paper to set.  I also just used the microwave to melt the chocolate chips. I used Ghirardelli and followed the instructions on the back of the label.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe. I put them on a 3 tiered plate stand, on nice plates. They looked beautiful and they tasted terrific. I just priced them at Macy's and Godiva and they were asking $5 each at Macy's and $4.50 for a small and $5.50 for a large at Godiva. And the clerk said the one's they had were all large.  And the ones I made were the same size. It was good to see our guests eat as much as they wanted of these delicious treats. Thank you for an easy recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

This is not an easy recipe to do if you are not good at working with melting chocolate so I gave it 3 stars because of the messy difficulty of the recipe.  I did follow the directions for melting chocolate on the package - recommend you NOT do this, but go ahead and add the shortening, it makes the chocolate thinner and smoother. I did this the for the white chocolate batch and they were much better, but still difficult.  Also, the styrofoam thing didn't work for me and the wax paper was messy. Still, even though these weren't perfect or very pretty, everyone at the party raved and ate them all up! I just thought it was a difficult to execute and messy project.

I used the ingredients in this recipe.  I heated the chocolate mixture in the microwave, then dipped the strawberries by holding their stems.  I just set each one on wax paper and put them in the fridge to help harden the chocolate quickly.  They were a hit!

Wonderful recipe! Around here, chocolate covered strawberries are very expensive.  These are even better than the strawberries from the chocolate store!  Thanks for sharing this.

Fantastic!  So easy to do and it looked so professional.  Great for Mother's Day!  I drizzled white chocolate on top too.  I did have a problem when I tried to melt the white chocolate in the micro. and ended up using some Wilton white chocolate melts in the micro. instead.  The double boiler worked great for both semi-sweet and dark chocolate.  I took someone else's advice and used Ghirardelli and it turned out great!

This was easy, I doubled the receipe and followed it to a T and it came out perfect.  I melted the chocolate in a tin bowl within a pan of boiling water.

Easy and fast! After I finished dipping them, I put them on wax paper on a cookie sheet and placed the sheet in the freezer for 10 mins. Took it out and it hardened nicely. Transfered to a plate, took out the toothpicks, and put it in the fridge. Next time I would like to roll them in some nuts. I had some left over chocolate and some pretzels, so I made chocolate covered pretzels...yummy!

My boyfriend made these for Christmas to go with a bottle of red wine and they were absolutely delicious!!! Way better than the chocolate covered strawberries we got at the Marriott when we got the "couple's package" last Valentine's Day!! I would make these anytime, but they would be great for a romantic evening in, with candlelight and a bottle of wine!!

I love this recipe. I use the crisco shortening sticks to making measuring easier. It does make more chocolate than needed for the recipe - you may want to dip twice, add another pint of strawberries, or reduce mix by half to avoid waste.

I made this for dessert at a recent BBQ. I got rave reviews and everyone was asking about the recipe. It was so easy to make! I took the advice of another reviewer and put the strawberries in cupcake liners for easy handling.

I made these with semi sweet chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand and they were very good, but I think next time I will use milk choclate.  This recipe was very easy.  I did not have any wax paper so I lightly greased a cookie sheet with shortening and placed the strawberries on there and they did not stick.  I was able to get most of the strawberries to stand upside down with out toothpicks, but even the ones that fell on their side still turned out pretty.

This recipe is fantastic!  I was making these for a party, and kept getting interupted by my neighbor and my own two small children.  The sauce remained smooth and silky, even though it sat atop my double boiler for almost two hours!  Mistakes (smudges) were easily fixed by dipping a second time.  I used a combination of dark and semi-sweet chocolate chips, and was able to coat two pounds of strawberries.  Be sure to leave plenty of space in your refrigerator for these beautiful, delicious treats!
