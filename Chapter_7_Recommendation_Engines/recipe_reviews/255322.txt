This was delicious!  Saw the TV show this morning and decided to try it.  Since it is February, there were no peaches at the grocery store.  So I used celery, red pepper and a whole honey crisp apple.  I am the caretaker for my very fussy 81 year old mother, and even she loved it.  Only left in oven 18 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

This was something very different for us, and we liked it (the kids weren't too crazy about it, though, lol). Hubby and I liked the combo of the sweet with the spicy and smokiness of the sausage was a nice addition. Thanks for sharing. :)

Not sure if my andouille sausage was spicier than the other reviewers, but the combo of the spicy sausage and jalapeño was overkill.  It overpowered the apple and peach.  Because peaches were out of season we used canned peaches. Overall, it was fun to try the recipe, but I will look for alternate stuffing suggestions next time.

What a lovely unique idea and fast to make! I was NOT a fan of the balsamic vinegar. Everything else was delicious!

Excellent!! I used only apples because peaches weren't available. And doubled the jalapeño. A winner in my house!
