This was great!  I used super sweet frozen corn and jarred red peppers. Followed the recipe as written. Really good! I used olive oil mayo to reduce the fat. The recipe made too much dressing for my taste so next time I won't put all of the dressing on or will make more of the corn/pepper/basil, as I don't like my veggies swimming in dressing. Thanks for posting.

I had 4 ears of corn to use up and stumbled on to this recipe last month. I used bottled roasted red peppers & since I only found the recipes 4 or 5 hours before supper,  the dressing did not marinate as long as Chef John recommends. Dried basil, no fresh herbs hereabouts.  But it was still very yummy. It will go into my hot as heck summer sides rotation.  Thanks again to Chef John.

We catered a 80 person group of cowboys and cowgirls for a annual cross country  trail ride.
the salad  was gobbled up by the hungry trail riders at days end.
The comments were positive and some asked for the recipe.
The dressing is really good. Roasting the vegetable in a oven at 375 for 15 min was the key to a nice  flavour from the corn. 
I used no name frozen corn because of the quantities.
I will definitely make again for a smaller group of family or friends for a  Bbq and use fresh corn when it is in season.
It was a hit!!

Would rate it a ten if possible.  We loved it so much it was made twice in one week.  The best thing about this site is that serving sizes can be adjusted, and the math is automatically done; extremely helpful.
First time made it exactly as printed but added one half of a diced zucchini with fresh ears of corn.  Second time did not have fresh ears of corn on hand but did have about 3/4 of a bag of frozen fire- roasted corn which is ab-fab. Defrosted it in a dish on the counter while the dressing was made.  And, btw, dressing did not need to be refrigerated for very long, just until it got a little cold which suited us just fine.  Decided to saute some onion in the olive oil first for another layer of flavor plus another veggie.
Added the zucchini half next, then the corn and jarred red roasted peppers, b/c we love the roasted flavor of them and it's so easy.
Didn't take long at all.  Allowed it to cool in a bowl awhile, then added the refrigerated dressing.  We loved it and ate every bite right away!
A truly delicious recipe with just a bit of a kick, which can be adjusted to suit one's taste.  Also, had enough dressing left over to put it on top of steamed broccoli, which was just as dee-lish!  Will try it next on top of asparagus.
Will definitely continue with this one during the summer heat.
Thank you Chef John!

Made exactly and felt the dressing had too much vinegar. After refrigerating overnight, the salad was exceptional.  Will definitely make again with no changes.

Made this for a luncheon yesterday and served with shredded bbq pork sandwiches. It was a hit!  I increased everything by about half except the dressing, and there was plenty of that for the increased amount of other ingredients.  I will definitely make this again ... and again!

I took this to a bridal shower and it was a big hit. I used fresh corn and roasted the pepper myself on the stove. I don't think I added as much dressing to the salad as called for, but keeping the tangy flavors more on the subtle side was nice, too. I'm actually glad I have lots of leftover dressing, I could use it on a hundred other things!

This was a perfect compliment to grilled Mahi Mahi. I reduced the amount of vinegar to 1 TBS and it was a bit too overwhelming.  Otherwise made as writtten.

I cut the dressing recipe in half as I knew 1 cup of mayo would drown the corn and peppers. Use a squeeze bottle to coat the veggies for control. The “italian seasoning” was overpowered by the red wine I used.

The vinegar was too overwhelming, so I may cut that back some.  Added diced jalepanos at the end for some kick.  I didn't mind the amount of dressing it made. Wasn't too bad.

I made the dressing , I was looking for an Italian dressing recipe for a salad bowl . I followed it , except I had no Italian seasoning .I used poultry seasoning instead and added fresh oregano and a touch of fresh rosemary . It worked and will definitely make again ! The videos attached to Chef Johns recipes are always funny , entertaining and insightful .

My wife loves anything with corn and this is one of the best things I ever made for her.  This is really good.  We used fresh corn off of the cob, which I think makes a big difference in taste.  Also, the dressing was a lot more than we needed.  We saved the leftover dressing for a side salad.  But we will be making this again.  Great for a dinner party too!

We saw this in the 2017 summer issue of Allrecipes Magazine and had to give it a try.  Very quick and easy to make and tastes great!  I am excited we have some leftovers and looking forward to trying it as a cold salad as well.

This recipe was a bit of a disappointment for us.  It really didn't have the flavor I was expecting.  It made too much dressing and if you are going to try this, you need to cut back to at least half of the recipe.  I hate to waste ingredients.

This recipe was good but not great.  I agree with everyone who said it makes too much dressing.  I am not sure what I will do with my leftover dressing.  There were suggestions made by others that I may follow.

Super easy to throw together with ingredients I already had on hand. I halved the recipe since there's only 3 of us here. Also, I used TJ's roasted frozen corn and eyeballed all of the ingredients. The flavor was good, but I feel like it could use a little more heat. Maybe some green chili's or pickled jalapeno. Really good salad for a hot summer day!

I made this for Mother's Day weekend and it was delicious - everyone loved it.  My brother took one bite and said "Who made this?  It's great!"  After reading the reviews, I did not add the entire amount of dressing.  Next time, I'll double the corn and there should be more than enough dressing. Thanks for sharing this keeper!

This will be my new go-to summer salad.  I made this for a wine tasting picnic lunch, paired with brie and proscuitto baguette sandwiches with fig spread.  This was a perfect choice as it didn't need to be refrigerated and it paired wonderfully with the sandwiches.  Absolutely delicious and so easy!

This was a pretty good recipe.  Overall my husband liked it more than me and gave it 5 stars, while I said 3, hence the 4 star review.  I could tell right away that I was not going to like that much vinegar, so I halved the amount.  I did also add in a touch more of the sugar to help with the zing in the dressing.  The recipe makes way too much dressing.  I only used 1/3 of it and even then I think I overdressed the corn and I think that is one of the reasons why I didn't care for it as much, since I was expecting this to be a nice lighter dish and it was a bit heavy with the dressing.  Overall it had a really nice flavor.  I loved the fresh basil in it.  I think if I make it again, next time I would just very lightly dress the corn to keep it fresh tasting.  Thank you for the recipe!

Made this on the weekend for a group BBQ.  Everyone loved, loved, loved it!  Made it exactly as written.  The guys were fighting for the small amount of leftover next day at lunch!  My new fav veggie for a BBQ!

I used this recipe as inspiration to make a side dish to go with the Chicken Cheddar and Guacamole Burgers (from this site) because I wanted a Tex-Mex spin as opposed to an Italian spin.  I used corn cooked in olive oil then added the roasted red peppers and a fire-roasted poblano ranch salad dressing.  We gobbled it up!

This was just okay - I did use fresh corn (grilled) and roasted my own red peppers, but I can't imagine it would be better with frozen corn and/or jarred peppers.  I think it's the mayo that throws this off for me - maybe I'll play with other dressings.
