Wow - this is one awesome Jewish Apple Cake! And it's definitely a crowd pleaser as the submitter states.  It sweet, moist, rises beautifully and is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have Rome Beauty apples, so I used a combination of apples that I had on hand.  Other than that, I would change a thing with this recipe. Apparently since this recipe has been handed down and made for over 37 years - if it ain't broke, don't fix it! All I had to do with this after it cooled, was to dust it with a little confectioners' sugar as if this beautiful cake needed anything else.  Thanks Janyce for a wonderful recipe that I hope many more people try, they'll be glad they did!

Heavenly! To make it healthy version: I replace 1 c oil with 1 c unsweetened applesauce; use 1 c egg beaters instead of 4 whole eggs; reduce white sugar by 1/2 c. For flavor, try replacing the 3/4 c white sugar with brown sugar to mix with the cinnamon and up the cinnamon to 4 tsp - also sprinkle some raisins or dates or dried cranberries for variety. Whole house smelled wonderful. I think with the healthy changes, this would make a nice breakfast addition.

If you want the cake a little more moist, decrease flour by 1/4 cup.

Absolutely phenomenal recipe! I just got a new fridge yesterday, and in unloading and reloading, I came upon a bag of cranberries that really needed to be used - NOW. So I first made cranberry sauce out of them, cooled it, and used it in this cake, in place of half the apples. I scraped 1/3 of the batter in the pan, topped with the cranberry sauce, put in another 1/3 of the batter, topped with the halved apple mixture, scraped in the remaining batter. The flavor is sensational, the texture super moist. Aside from the cranberries standing in for half the apples, I cut the flour back to 2-3/4 cup. I baked it for only 85 minutes. I checked on it at about 45 minutes, and it appeared to be browning early. So I placed a piece of foil on top for the remainder of the baking time. It came out with a nice, crunchy crust on top. I glazed it with a lovely caramel rum glaze: 3 Tb butter, 2 Tb brown sugar, 2 Tb white sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp dark rum, 2 Tb whipping cream, combined in a small sauce pan over medium-low heat, until it comes to a simmer. Continue to simmer for 3 minutes. Brush over the warm cake, right after you remove it from the pan. It's not a lot of glaze, but it's quite flavorful, just enough to point up the cake's ingredients to perfection and to impart a lovely sheen. BTW, I will try making it with only apples the next time. Yes, the cranberries and glaze were a little difference, but the cake flavor and texture remained unchanged, and gotta say, they're stellar.

Wonderful and easy!! This is a very tasty, not too sweet cake that is a cinch to make. I substituted 1/2 C. of the oil with applesauce and didn't have the dryness problem some reviewers complained of, in fact mine turned out very moist. I also drizzled powdered sugar glaze over the warm cake and it was a nice touch. I didn't have Rome Beauty apples but just used whatever was in my fruit bin and it was great! I highly recommend this recipe, it is a great brunch cake for Spring!

Wow! Great cake- I've made it 3 times now and it is fantastic!!  The only alteration I make is to substitute 1/2 C. olive oil and 1/2 C. plain yogurt for the 1 C. vegetable oil.  Thanks for sharing!

i wanted to use up the last of my fall apples, so i made this recipe based on the rave reviews it got.  i made the following alterations: 1 c. unbleached flour, 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour, 1 c. rolled oats (instead of 3 cups all purpose flour); 1/2 c. applesauce + 1/2 c. canola oil (instead of 1 c. oil); 1 c. egg whites (i had a bunch left over from some lime curd i made a few days back, in the future i'll probably use whole eggs), 2 Tbls. of flax seed meal, and brown sugar instead of white.  i made this recipe in two loaf pans since my bundt pan has gone missing, baking them for about one hour, and it turned out great!  i like the wholesomeness the oats give the cake, and i think it'll be perfect for quick, easy breakfasts all week!

I just made  this cake 3 days ago for my family that was visiting, and they loved it.  I took the advice of others and used 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce.  The cake really came out moist, and now three days later it is still moist.  I may use more apples next time though.  I really like the flavor of the apples with cinnamon.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

YUM! I was just looking for an apple recipe that I already have the ingredients for. Having never tried a Jewish apple cake, I don't have much to compare it to, and I had to adjust it slightly for what was available to me. But here's what I did.  First of all, I had a bag of McIntosh apples on hand rather than finding Rome apples. Since they are small/medium apples and not large, I used one or two extra. It came to about 6 cups once sliced and cubed.  It wouldn't hurt to use more but this seemed to do the job. I didn't have enough vegetable oil so I melted some margarine spread to use instead and it worked fine. I also doubled the cinnamon and only had a 9x13 glass dish to bake it in. Since it was a different shape, it only took a little over an hour to bake. I didn't even have to use an electric mixer either. Just mixing it with a spoon worked well.  It does require lots of dishes but is very tasty!

This is a very good cake!  I added about 1-1/4 t. cinnamon and one single-serve container of applesauce + canola oil to make up the c. of oil.  Didn't use Rome Beauties, I don't know what kind of apples they were - maybe really large Red Delicious (6 c. chopped) - there was quite a bit of juice from the apples and I drizzled most of that on top before baking.  Baked about 1 hr. 40 mins.  Lots of dirty bowls from this, but worth it.  (Tip:  use a LARGE bowl to beat the eggs and sugar)  I posted pics.

Rave reviews from folks at work and even from my mother-in-law!  That is high praise!  Great recipe for traditional Jewish Apple Cake.  I used about 6 different types of apples, as I had been apple-picking in a huge orchard.  Excellent results!  Wouldn't change a thing!

This is the only Jewish apple cake I've ever made, and it was great. I would have liked it a bit moister. When it was hot and first out of the oven it was perfect. Not as moist as I would have liked after it cooled down.  I used a rounded top bundt pan, which almost fit all of the batter. I think in a square top pan, it all would have fit. I cut the apples into large chunks. My mom used to use apples, cut in half and then sliced. I think I prefer the slices over the chunks and I'll try this next time.   Overall, a fabulous homemade cake!

This was my first ever Apple Cake I made for my husband's birthday and I envisioned it looking like some pictures I've seen. So I decided to melt some butter to coat bottom of bundt pan, sprinkled about 1/4 cup of Brown sugar over that and then layered some thin apple slices on top of that. I then continued the recipe as directed.  I couldn't be more happier about a cake! Wish I could share the photo, it looked magazine worthy! Lol - and My husband loved it! He even said it was the best Apple Cake he ever had (including his moms!)   
Our family devoured it! I am passing this along to family and friends!

After our bible study on the book of Esther we had a Jewish celebration.  I make the Jewish Apple cake first to try out with some friends, they all loved it and wanted the recipe.  So on celebration day it was a hit. "Thanks" for all your help with the recipes and cooking instructions.

Love, love, love this recipe.  Great flavor, perfect texture and baked up nice and high.  I have made many Jewish Apple cakes and this one, by far, has been the best.  I used a variety of apples, the juice of an orange and home made vanilla extract.  I omitted the salt and used sodium free baking powder. I also used Egg Beaters in place of the whole eggs.  The base of this recipe is so good that I plan on trying it with lemon and blueberries then maybe almond and fresh cherries.... this recipe is definitely a keeper!  **UPDATE** 



    5 large Rome Beauty apples, peeled, cored, and chopped

    3 cups all-purpose flour (used 1 cup whole wheat, 1 cup oatmeal and 1 cup almond flours)

    1 teaspoon salt (Skipped)

    1 tablespoon baking powder (used sodium free and added sodium free baking soda)

    4 eggs (used egg whites)

    2 cups white sugar (still working on a good sub for this)

    1 cup vegetable oil (used Fat free mayo 3/4 cup and 1/4 cup oil but will use all mayo next cake)

    1/4 cup orange juice (fresh squeezed orange)

    1 tablespoon vanilla extract
I added and  inulin fiber powder and chia bran fiber I am loving this cake and how versatile it is.

I only had a 9 inch pan so I used a ramekin in the center and halved the recipe to get the same affect.  Came out perfectly!  This recipe is dangerously easy.  DANGEROUS.

This was a wonderful cake.  I always have to change recipes just a little to make it my own.  Added some cinnamon to the batter and made a streusal topping with oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon and some butter.  Baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 1 hour.  Had some really tart apples and was afraid they might be too tart, but they weren't.  Served with homemade cinnamon ice cream and everyone loved it.

It took me 60 minutes to bake the cake in a Bundt pan as opposed to the suggested 90 minutes so make sure you check on the cake.
I baked this for Rosh Hashanah and received a lot of compliments on it. I would definitely recommend this recipe. I used gala apples and one granny smith in my cake.

Very easy to make and is a very showy cake.  I made a cream cheese drizzle icing to go over it.  I also made a few additions and changes:
- added a tablespoon of orange zest.  I found it to enhance the apple flavor.  
- I added a teaspoon of cardamom, ginger, and cloves
- I used half Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples
OVERALL:  huge hit at the party!

I really liked it! I did change the recipe a little bit, I added 1/2 cup of plain yoghurt and 1/2 of oil. Also, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the apples, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1 and used 2 1/2 cups of flour and it was super moist (maybe next time I will use 3 cups), but still very good. Also had no problem using a bundt mold, it came out perfect.

Perfect! I have been making this for my kids for years now same recipe just only using 2cups apples and different method of mixing. Used this method with 4 large apples 2 tsp cinnamon and it was sooo good. Not dry at all and very delicate . Will adjust my recipe to this, happy to see it here. Never knew the name .

Made exact according to recipe.  
A lot of work and came out very heavy.
  For some reason apples did not stay in middle but sunk to bottom.
Will not make again.  Brought it to a dinner for a dessert.  Not happy with it at all.
First time I had  been disappointed in an all recipe!!
Sorry!!

This is by far the most popular cake I serve to my family and guests.  It is tender and moist and with lots of fresh apples.  I make this cake exactly as Bubba handed down the recipe--it does not require any alterations.  Don't mess with Bubba.  She knew what she was doing!

A great recipe that brought back fond memories.  My Mom made this cake for us all the time when we were growing up and used the same recipe.  She never iced it with anything, and when I used this receipt to make the cake recently, I  served it plain just the way my Mom used to and it was perfect!

Came out beautiful.  I did some extra prep.  I lined the bottom of my tube pan with parchment paper.  I also omitted the orange juice from the batter.  I instead squeezed a fresh lemon and orange into a bowl and added the instructed sugar and cinnamon with the sliced apples and let the apple slices marinate in the mixture.  I drained off the marinade and lightly squeezed the apple slices before layering into the batter.  I cut the cake in half to easily remove from the pan and and plated the halves together as one whole cake.  Couldn't see the seam as to where I cut it with all of the beautifully browned apple slices on the top of the cake.  This was a test to make sure I could make this cake for a party I am going to.  Success!

A friend made this cake for me.  It was delicious!  I had to have the recipe and make one for myself.  The cake is easy to make, moist, tender, and yummy.  Be sure to completely butter/grease the pan beforehand.    It goes well with tea,  for breakfast, to serve to an impromptu gathering of friends, or for late-night dessert.  I'm surprised at how much I really enjoy this cake!  Use whatever apples you have on hand.  Mine were right from the apple tree in my Dad's yard.  But I suspect this cake would be great with any apples.

I was looking for the recipe I used to make in the early 70's but this one was drier, although the taste was good. I added some chopped walnuts to the apples just because I could. I would make it again but substitute applesauce for half or all of the oil.

It was a good cake, but not great. I substituted Gala apples for the Rome apples because Romes weren't available. Next time I make it I'm going to add at least a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, not just to mix with the apples. I will also bake it for 10 minutes less than the recipe calls for. My tube pan is dark and thick and my cake was overdone at 90 minutes. It started smelling "done" at 70 minutes, and I should have probably only baked it 80 minutes. I also made a glaze out of the remaining cinnamon sugar mixture left over from the apples (and added more cinnamon), which I think gave the cake an extra oomph.

This is almost the same recipe published by Bundt Nordic ware in 1973. When I made their recipe the bake time wasn't long enough however this recipe is much closer to what I adjusted to. They called their recipe "Apple Dapple Cake". It has an amazing caramel sauce to pour over but I thought the cake was almost too sweet to add additional sugar to. Ultimately I found my go-to Jewish Apple cake recipe when I have a lot of eggs & apples on hand.

Great Cake!!!!! I made it for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loved it. I should have made two. I followed the recipe exactly as written....I think I may add a few extra apples next time. I made a glaze with powder sugar and apple cider which made it extra good. 
Thanks I will Keep this recipe forever :)

It was outstanding.  The problem was it never made it to the party it was so good.   Part of it stuck to the Bundt pan.I attribute it  to not having divided the batter and apples evenly.  Possibly the heaviness of the apples caused it?  I was very careful about greasing and flouring the pan.   Attempting the second one this morning for a wedding reception.

Excellent! Delicious even for a couple of days (if not eaten right away). A keeper.

My mother in law made the same recipe only used 2 cups of flour instead of 3 cups. I would think 3 cups of flour would make the cake on the dry side.  When made with 2 cups of flour this cake is delicious!!!

I followed the instructions to the "T" and it never cooked all the way through. I even put it in the oven for 1-1/2 hours and it still was all mushy - didn't hold together. The instructions didn't say what kind of baking pan to use but the picture clearly shows it in a bundt pan, so that's what I used. Very disappointed - I had to toss the entire project in the trash can!

This recipe is a favorite!  This has been my apple cake recipe of choice since 1980 when my mom-in-law gave me the Kappa Guild cookbook.  Sometimes I substitute applesauce for the orange juice.  Thanks, Iris!

I added cinnamon and nutmeg to give it a little spice. I made it in a bundt pan. I do not recommend that since the apples stuck to the pan when I tried to put them on the top. New cook, bad choice. The recipe is very good.

Next time, I'll use 3tsp of cinnamon instead of 1. Otherwise, it turned out great.

Very delicious and moist.  My husband's family ate the entire thing at Rosh Hashanna dinner!  It's now the new "favorite" at home.
