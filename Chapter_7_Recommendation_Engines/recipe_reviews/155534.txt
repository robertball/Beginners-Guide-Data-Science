YUM!!! This recipe is amazing!!!  I am an avid baker and love, love, love cupcakes! My tried and true cupcake recipe had previously been a variation of the Magnolia vanilla cupcake recipe, but since my boyfriend's daughter is now a vegan, I needed to find something to bake for her birthday.  All I can say is WOW!  The texture was great, moist, dense enough (but not too dense), with a faint coconut aroma (due to the coconut oil).  My boyfriend actually said these were the best cupcakes I'd ever made and has now been officially converted to a cupcake lover.  I served these with a confectioner's sugar "quick frosting": a 1 lb. box of confectioner's sugar, 1/4 c. orange juice (or an orange reduction using vegan butter & agave syrup for a little more flavor), about a 1/2 tbsp. of orange zest, and 1 tsp of bourbon vanilla.   I've already made this recipe twice (in two weeks) and will continue to use it, even for my non-vegan friends and family.

These were great! I didn't have almond milk but is subsituted soy milk and added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. I just used vegetable oil. I made icing with vegan butter, powder milk, and vanilla extract.

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I was having a guest to dinner who is lactose intolerant, so I needed a milk-free dessert.  These were very easy to make and taste very similar to regular cupcakes.   I used rice milk and canola oil because that is what I had on hand, and I curdled the milk with lemon juice b/c my guest couldn't eat vinegar, and the cupcakes were great! This is a keeper!

These were DELICIOUS!  Some of the best cupcakes I've ever had.  Loved the coconut flavor.  I made a coconut frosting to go on it as well.  1 cup powdered sugar, 1 cup coconut, 1 Tbsp coconut oil, and 1/4 cup almond milk.  Combine in a saucepan, bring it to a boil, boil 5 min.  Spread it while it's lukewarm.  It complemented it nicely.

I made vegan chai cupcakes! I swapped about 2 tbsp of the sugar for a sweetened powdered chai mix and these came out spicy-sweet and delicious (even without frosting)!

Update 10/15/11-I made this batter into processed-sugar free biscotti by using my modified recipe below, pouring the batter into a 9 x 13 pan, baking it (check at 20 minutes), cooling it, cutting it into biscotti shapes, laying them cut side up on a cookie sheet, and baking them for 10 to 15 minutes on each side.  See bakingribbons.blogspot.com for complete instructions.  Update 12-05-09 made again today  Instead of sugar I used 1/2 cup granulated splenda, 1/4 cup Agave syrup, and reduced the Rice milk to 1 1/4 cups. Also subsituted whole wheat pastry flour for 1 cup of the flour. Sprinkled sliced almonds on top. Baked 13 min and they were done. Finished with a mix of cinnamon and splenda sprinkled on top right out of the oven. Diabetics can eat this. READ ORIGINAL REVIEW FOR CHANGES: I just made these they are delish!!! As the recipe and reviewers say, easy to modify to your tastes. I made 12 cupcakes and put the rest of the batter in an 8x8 pan for a little cake. YUMMY! I used Rice milk instead of almond milk, canola oil instead of coconut oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice instead of vinegar, 3/4 teaspoon almond extract instead of vanilla, and I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon. They are wonderful!!!

Great recipe!  I've found that vegan recipes work well for my family, as my oldest son is allergic to milk and corn, and even though I needed to substitute the baking powder for 1/2 t baking soda and 1 t cream of tartar, (baking powder contains cornstarch), these are great cupcakes!  We use jam for frosting, as powdered sugar also contains cornstarch, and my youngest son is allergic to citrus.  But, we will make these frequently!

I followed the directions, which said to add the coconut oil to the almond milk, but didn't mention that you need to let the almond milk sit out long enough to be above room temperature before you add the oil.  If you don't do this, there is NO WAY your coconut oil will do anything other than revert back to it's hardened state, and you'll have massive clumps of coconut oil in your batter that cannot be broken up by any means, which will do nothing other than utterly ruin the batter, and leave you absolutely infuriated.  Details like this NEED to be in the recipe since not everyone likes to consider the physics of a 4 1/2 star recipe that should be fine as is.  In hindsight, this error should not have happened since I know that coconut oil will solidify at 76 degrees, but when I'm making a recipe, I simply expect the recipe to be accurate, and since the recipe list did not call for WARM milk, it was not.

Really amazing vegan cupcakes (and I've made plenty before!). I couldn't find my cupcake tray, so had to settle for making flatter fairy cakes instead. But they came out very nice and moist. They didn't rise very much (This is always a problem with vegan cakes.), but when they're that delicious I didn't really mind. I used regular sunflower oil instead of coconut oil, soy milk instead of almond milk, and white wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. Absolutely delicious cupcakes, that I will be making for years to come. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because I didn't have any cow milk or eggs in the house but I really, really wanted some cupcakes.  I used vanilla flavored oat milk, cake flour instead of all-purpose flour, and canola oil. The result was fluffy and delicious! :-)

Except or the funky apple cider vinegar after taste, these are amazing. I used rice milk and canola oil. I will be making these A LOT.. but using white vinegar or lemon juice  ;] Also regular white sugar is NOT vegan, it's processed through animal bone char.  Use a vegan sugar such as beet or unrefined. ... In fact  I'm curious how to use agave nectar with this recipe, anyone know????

EDIT TO ADD: the second time I made these I used lemon juice, I made 6 white then added 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the remaining batter to have 6 chocolate. YUM we are on cloud 9...  here is my frosting: 1 cup Earth Balance, 3 1/2 cups vegan powdered sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract.

Good recipe. Tasted like normal eggy, milky cake. 

Changes I made: I reduced the flour to 1.5 cups and added 1/2 cup cocoa powder. I added a tsp espresso powder. I used canola oil instead of coconut oil, because it's what I had. made about 40 mini cupcakes, baked at 350 for 10 minutes. tasty!

I'm not sure what happened - but this recipe did not work.  The finished product was gummy and all the cupcakes sunk when I took them out of the oven.  They were very oily.

I am not vegan but have a good friend who is. I made these for a get together and EVERYONE loved them.

I used canola oil instead of coconut, and it worked out great.

I made a chocolate glaze frosting: 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/3 cup warm water.

I made no changes - these are perfect!  First time I baked cake using coconut oil and loved it. The coconut oil adds no noticeable coconut flavor.  Made 1-1/2 times recipe and got 22 cupcakes.  Took to church and everyone liked.  Here is the frosting I used, enough for 2 dozen cupcakes:
***  3 cups pdr sugar, 5-6 Tb soy or almond milk, 3 Tb cocoa pdr, 1 square unsweetened baker's chocolate melted, 2 Tb almond butter, 1 Tb margarine, 1/2 tsp vanilla, dash salt.

these were excellent. I read all of the revies before making them, so took the advice and combined several ideas. I added 1/4 cup of cocoa, and mixed 1/4 cup of OJ with 1 1/4 cups of vanilla soy milk. Then for the frosting, I followed Lisa S's cooked coconut frosting recipe on page 3. Thanks so much for a versitile recipe!

MMMMM!  I made just half of this recipe for cupcakes for my mums birthday (since it was just the two of us)....delicious!  She didn't even notice it was vegan!  I made a basic buttercream icing (vanilla, icing sugar, butter, touch of milk) for them and topped them off with some multicolored nonpariellels and little pumpkin jelly candies (maybe I'll post my pic they were super cute).  To make it the way I did but totally vegan, you could substitute a vegan margarine and soymilk/almond milk for the butter and milk...maybe next time thats what I'll do:)

I am telling you! I recently have become a huge fan of "Cupcake Wars" and have been looking for a recipe. This one is IT! After several tried and failed attempts with other recipes, I know I can bake cupcakes with this recipe! The cake is sooo moist! I used lemon juice in place of vinegar and canola/olive oil in place of coconut oil. All recipes is #1 thanks to recipes like this!

Great recipe!! I used rice milk and lemon juice rather than apple cider vinegar (because I didn't have any) and I enjoyed mine without any icing.  Of note: when I mixed the liquid ingredients the coconut oil firmed up due to the cold temperature of the milk.  The batter was clumpy but this did NOT effect the outcome. This is a must for ANYONE, vegan or not.

These were wonderful, moist and certainly didn't leave anyone wanting for dairy or eggs. I topped these with fresh beries and glazed with apricot allfruit jam. They were a hug hit in the office!

I made these for a friend of mine who is Vegan the day she moved in to her new apartment... Her brother (not Vegan) had come to help her move, and he ate 4 and went on and on about how good they were. When I told him they were Vegan, he was very surprised! Made exactly as directed - very good recipe!

Wow! Awesome! I only made a few changes. I used canola oil because my kids dont like coconut. I also used very vanilla soy milk and white vinegar. Finally, i upped the vanilla extract to 2tsp. It rose perfectly and was light and fluffy! My kids ate it all up.

These are awesome. The first time around, I didn't melt the coconut oil all the way, and they came out kinda rubbery. The second time, I used canola oil, and then saved some coconut oil for the frosting. I also use unsweetened Silk soy milk, instead of almond milk, then shake in a little bit of soy protein for good measure. They turned out amazing! I had one friend tell me she was really weirded out by the idea of something vegan, then proceeded to eat three cupcakes. After baking, the cupcake wrappers get really oily, but the cupcakes themselves are nice and fluffy and oh-so-good.

Simply amazing. I'm speechless. I followed this recipe exactly and was amazed at how delicious they were! My husband LOVED them! Topped it off with the avocado frosting on here and it was delicious! Will definitely make again...and won't tell anyone they're vegan cupcakes until AFTER they tell me how great they are!

I'm known for making cupcakes for my friends on their birthdays.  One of my very good friends is a vegan so I was trying to find a vegan cupcake recipe.  Luckily I found this one.

Instead of coconut oil, I used regular vegetable oil because I couldn't find coconut oil at the grocery store.  The batter was really simple to make, I had most of the ingredients excluding the oil.  The cupcakes came out really moist with a hint of vanilla flavor.  I really love this recipe because you can customize it with any type of frosting.

I'm definitely going to try this recipe again, hopefully I can find coconut oil!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out amazing! I would recommend whisking the vinegar/milk/coconut milk/vanilla mixture really well before mixing it in with the dry ingredients.  for frosting, I did a simple buttercream frosting using Earth Balance vegan butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and a bit of almond milk.  I used a piping bag and the frosting was just perfect!  this is an AWESOME recipe!!!

We are not vegan, but I wanted to try something different for V-day! I made these for my son's class today and they were a huge hit! After reading some reviews I used canola oil.  I also used both lemon and vanilla extract. I used a non-dairy frosting and they loved them.

These cupcakes are really good! I did follow the recipe exactly except I added a bit of almond extract as well. I used to eat only vegan and these were the perfect treat. I recommend a vanilla vegan frosting for the top. Yum!

I used milk I made from milk powder because I didn't have almond milk and just plain vinegar because I didn't have apple cider vinegar. It didn't come out too bad. It didn't rise that much but it was fluffy and nice when it was right out of the oven. and instead of coconut oil, I melted some butter and used the same amount - 1/2 a cup. I also put half a cup of oatmeal. if I had more ingredients like chocolate chips and raisins, I'm sure it would just make it more delightful. All in all, easy and nice =)

Just made these.  Followed the recipe exactly and they came out light and fluffy, maybe just a bit too sweet, but yummy!  No frosting needed, a sugared sliced strawberry would be pretty..  I think your results will only be as good as your ingredients, so use the highest quality you can, and follow the directions as closely as possible, but just for the first time...after that... experiment! explore!  Have fun!

Very good! These were enjoyed by both the vegans and the ominvores among us. I used vegetable oil because the coconut oil was a bit expensive. Actually this made it a lot easier than other baking recipes that require creaming butter, beating eggs, etc.

I made these for a potluck at work and for the people that didn't know any better they had no idea they were vegan. Will make again, the texture is perfect and the taste is out of this world.

my husband has recently gone on a health food kick, and i was aching for some cupcakes, so i made these. They are great! my first vegan cupcake recipe. The only thing i changed was the oil. To cut the fat (because i knew i wanted cream cheese frosting), i substituted unsweetened apple sauce and they were very tasty. my husband liked them!

YUMMY!  This recipe introduced me to Coconut Oil which I've learned has some excellent health benefits.  Be sure to use a nice Virgin Coconut Oil to get the yummy coconut taste.  It is expensive but worth it!  I filled 12 muffin cups almost to the top with this (original yield says 18).  I used a dollop of Hershey’s Coca frosting on top because I couldn't figure out the proportions of the recommended frosting.   They came out fantastic!

These are delicious!  With the orange citrus frosting, they taste unbelievably good.  Without the frosting, I thought the coconut oil flavor was overpowering, but once I frosted them, it all seemed to come together, and the coconut flavor was pretty much gone...or it just worked better with the orange and lemon.  I'm making them for my daughter's first birthday cupcakes.

Wow. I made these for a dinner party where there was a vegan, and everyone loved them! The only change I made was substituting vegetable oil for the coconut oil. I will post the recipe for vegan chocolate frosting I made when I have more time. Can't wait to try out different flavours!

I've made this a few times.  As written, I think the vanilla (or almond extract) overpowered the coconut flavor.  I am rating it 4 stars because I changed it a little.  I used coconut milk, skipped the vinegar, coconut extract and used Lisa S's icing recipe.  After reading the review that it was muffin like, I used cake flour (or omit 4Tbsp of A.P. flour).  My cupcakes were delicate, light and fluffy and had a great coconut flavor.

UNREAL!  The recipe seriously makes me want to cry in a good way.  My son has a lot of food allergies and I mourn for what he'll miss out on, but this recipe changes it all.  These are delicious.  I used rice milk instead of almond milk.  I also didn't want too much coconut flavor so, I put a shade less than a 1/4 cup of oil instead.  Mine rose well too, very light and no typical vegan density, hooray! Thank you SO much cornfairy!

food allergies prevent my daughter from eating milk & egg, and therefore, she misses out on a lot of baked goods...these however are great!  so great that 6 kids just gobbled them up -- totally unaware of their "vegan-ness"  SCORE!

Yummm. These were amazing cupcakes. I would give them 4 1/2 stars because I tend to like things less sweet than average. I love coconut oil and the vinegar makes them nice and fluffy. I made just as directed this time but I think next time I'll use less sugar and substitute something else. The coconut oil is so sweet that it doesn't really need much sugar.

Awesome recipe! Cupcakes turned out fully and delicious. 

I did chocolate version with soy milk instead of almond milk, a little extra baking soda, and instead of the oil, melted vegan butter and chocolate chips. I think the extra baking soda is what kept this from being too dense and the final product was super fluffy. 

This will definitely be my go-to recipe.

I LOVED these! Thank you so much. I was to bring dessert to non-vegan people and I was so happy with this:-} It's funny though, my nephew LOVES cupcakes and only licked the icing and took a little bite and said that the "bottom part did not taste good on my tongue". But, my son, who only ever licks icing off of cupcakes and never eats them ... he downed the WHOLE thing. But, my hubby and I think that my son is a vegetarian at heart:-}

ADDING: BEWARE ... they do not keep long and will be disgusting! Best eaten fresh and no longer than 2 days. Or, maybe that was just the way I packaged them (air-tight tupperware container).

These cupcakes are awesome!  I made them for my fiance's birthday.  He is not a huge fan of sweets, so I always have a hard time figuring out what to make for him.  He loved these!  Also, I cannot eat dairy or eggs, so these were perfect for me as well.  They taste great.  No one would ever know guess they are "vegan".  I followed the recipe with only one modification.  I used vegetable oil instead of coconut.  Next time I'll try canola.

Excellent recipe!  One of the best tasting vegan cake recipes I've come across.  I like vegan recipes because they don't use eggs, which my son is allergic to.  I made a few slight modifications.  Instead of almond milk, I used regular skim milk, since my son is also allergic to nuts too.  I also added about 1/4 c. of orange juice to the batter after all the ingredients were mixed.  My family, especially my husband, loved the cupcakes.  My son also asked me to make them for his class for his birthday in October.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Amazing! I used rice milk and canola oil and these babies were fantastic. I also added the zest of one orange into the batter. Also took the suggestion for the frosting - I'm not much of a baker and had no idea you could make such a nice, thick frosting so easily and without butter/cream cheese. Play around with the proportions of orange juice, cocoa, and powdered sugar until you get the consistency you want with the frosting.  This made a fantastic Orange/Vanilla cupcake with Chocolate Orange frosting. Quick, easy, vegan, and delicious! Can't ask for anything more.

these are very excellent, although the texture and flavor made me think of muffins more than cupcakes.  i recommend trying out different flavorings - these are very versatile.  instead of trying to make an icing, i just sprinkled different types of toppings on the batter in the pans before i baked them, such as cinnamon or nuts.  also, for a very different twist, tear open about 5 teabags of earl grey tea and mix the tea granules in the batter before baking - it's delicious.

Very good recipe.  I followed a reviewers suggestion and used the juice of 1 lemon then added almond milk to make 1 1/2 cups.  I also used canola oil since that is what I had on hand.  In place of the vanilla i used lemon extract that i found in my cabinet from another recipe.  The cupcakes had a light lemon flavor but a great lemon scent.  I think adding lemon zest to the batter may make for a more lemony flavor if that is something you are looking for. Although I am not a vegan I will make this recipe again if I find myself without eggs in my kitchen again!

These were very moist, probably the best cupcakes I've ever had constistency-wise. They were a bit bland though; I'd recommend adding either cocoa powder or chocolate chips, or using a very strong-flavored icing (I used a whipped vanilla that tasted pretty much like the cupcakes).

I did not care for this. dripping with oil. The texture was chewy. As a disclaimer, I substituted lactose-free milk for the almond milk. But I think the main problem is the the coconut oil; it re-coagulates when it mixes with the liquids.

The texture of these cupcakes was nice.  They tasted okay, but nothing special.  I'd say you couldn't tell they were vegan, but they still didn't bring enough flavor.

Extremely simple recipe, which is great for the novice baker like me! I made the first batch for my daughter's 2nd Birthday. They turned out great and nobody realized they were vegan. I subbed applesauce for half the oil in one batch and almond oil for coconut oil in another, and added cinnamon and clove to make spice cupcakes. I also usually use 1/2 the amount of sugar called for, because i dont like really sweet cakes. This recipe lends itself well to substitutions and variations.

ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING!!!! Made 30, had 18 left after the first night, all gone in 3 days. :) YUM! I just substituted 1/2 cup flour for 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs, and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Silly me, I didn't relize how quick theese were, and ended up having to wait 10 minutes for the oven to heat up. Even though I let them sit for 10 minutes before baking, left them out overnight, they were sinfully moist, chocolate-ey, and deliciuos! And I didn't feel bad about eating 3 because there is no butter. I finally found my go-to cupcake recipie!

Best cake recipe EVER!  This was for my husbands birthday and he loved it!  Had to use regular milk (out of the almond) and we put it in an 8x8 for a larger cake instead of cupcakes.  We also put rainbow sprinkles in the batter for fun.  Still turned out moist, delicious and awesome!  I'll try it again with the almond milk.  I'll be using this recipe again and again and again!  Thank you!

Awesome cupcakes. I used soy milk and canola oil because that's what I had on hand. I also added some diced strawberries and topped the cupcakes with strawberry frosting. I could see this recipe being tweaked to make many different flavors, and I'm sure it would be great as is. Wonderful recipe!!

These are truly amazing. I made them for a friends birthday and people went crazy for them! I topped them with a (nonvegan) chocolate cream cheese icing and toasted coconut. Many recipes out there for raw food coconut oil and agave icing that would be great on them too :)

These turned out beautifully. They were moist and not too sweet, which is how I like my cupcakes. I used distiller white vinegar since I was out of apple cider vinegar, used a scant cup of sugar, and sunflower oil, that being all I had in the kitchen. I got exactly 18 medium-sized cupcakes. Next time I'll try to sub half the oil for applesauce to cut back on the fat, but I have a feeling that it will make them more dense. But I will definitely make these again!

I've been wanting to try these for so long! So I ordered coconut oil first and did! These are great! So soft, moist, simple and yummy. I put some homemade whipped cream on them with fresh fruit. So delicious. These don't need frosting and if you do put frosting, make it simple. However you top it, they are so good! Nothing at all on these is perfectly fine. They taste delicious as is. I have made these using Silk and Almond Milk and both time were excellent.

Fantastic! My husband and I are vegetarians who do vegan one day a week. So, as a snack/dessert I decide to make these with vegan coconut icing. I switched the coconut oil for almond oil because, well, almond oil was a whole $4 cheaper. My husband is addicted to these and my co-workers loved them not even knowing that they were vegan! Delish!

I love this recipe soo much !! I made them first for my baby shower and a lot of my friends are vegan but I also made them gluten free by subbing the flour with gluten free flour and I used lemon extract and put raspberries in the center before adding the cake mix in.  Everyone loved it so much I wish I made a double batch, This time I made them it is for a pot luck and I made the frosting with coca powder like suggested but I used apple juice and mixed in raspberries and the powdered sugar is always too sweet for me so I liked that the berries complement the sweetness and provides a different flavor with the lemon and berries inside the cupcakes. I don't mind the seeds but my husband said I should strain them out . . . if you ever do use this suggestion and want the extra work knock yourself out !! like I said I don't mind them!

I'm not a vegan but one day had a hankering for a vanilla cake.  I found that I had all of the ingredients for this recipe so decided to give it a try.  It was just a tad dry for my liking but quite good and I didn't think it needed any frosting.

Well, I hate to say it, but I really didn't like these. So heavy, not like pound cake dense, just heavy. The coconut oil did give them a nice flavor, just can't get past the heavyness. No one in my house will eat them. Thank you for posting this recipe, they are just not for us.

Cupcakes are very easy to make and came out light and fluffy with a nice coconut flavor.  I filled the cups too full so I had to be careful frosting the the cupcakes because they were a little more fragile since the bottoms were so light and delicate.

This was very yummy. Even my non vegan (college student) friends loved this. I used rice milk instead of almond, reduced sugar to 3/4c., i reduced the oil (using part almond oil, part coconut oil) to 1/3 c and added 2.tbs applesauce instead. I made a lemon orange buttercream frosting (1/2c. vegan earth balance butter, 2c. confectioners sugar, 1tbs both orange  and lemon juice, 1/2tbs. each lemon and organe zest, 1 tsp vanilla. i spriled with coconut shavings). I also made a mocha buttercream frosting (1/2c. vegan earth balance butter, 2c. confectioners sugar, 1/4 c. espresso cooled, 1tbs. coco powder. after frosting sprinle coco. have to mix a lot to combine the water from the espresso and the oil).

This is my new favorite cupcake recipe! I used rice milk instead of almond milk and a gluten-free flour mix and they came out great. It's not often that I've been able to just switch out the flour amount with a gluten-free mix and they come out ok. And I've used different oils as wells. Very versatile!

these cupcakes are great!  i put them together so fast this morning with just the stuff i had on hand.  i was a bit worried about substituting rice milk, since it didn't really curdle, but they still taste fantastic.  also, like others, i doubled the baking soda, and they rose just fine. i used vegan chocolate frosting, and i am pretty sure if i leave them on the counter, my roommates will eat them all up before i get home from work tonight.  anyway, thanks for helping my first foray into vegan baking go so smoothly!

my taste tester was my toddler. I said "Charlie!! try a CUPCAKE" I knew if it tasted bad- she would shake her head "No" if i tried to offer her more. Instead she came back and her spoke her first two syllable word "Kekcay"=cupcake. she loved it. ran back for more and more.  I baked these for a friend that is doing the 30 day vegan trial to see if she could like it. It was her birthday and so i thought i'd try these. She loved them. Even the table of men across from us at the restaurant we went to- who initially snickered when i told them they were vegan cupcakes- had one and liked it.   I used the confectioner sugar and orange juice icing someone else recommended. It gave it a nice citrus kick.

I absolutely love this recipe! The texture of the cupcakes are perfection! If you made these and think they turned out dense, you may have tweaked something incorrectly. I make these true to the recipe and they come out light, sponge-y and delicious. The only thing I will add is to *not* use 365 brand almond milk. I wasted three cups of it before realizing that it does not curdle. Almond Breeze and Silk work just fine though!

These are wonderful.  I actually used almond milk, but changed the flours and oils.  Added some nutmeg and put them in my square cupcake pans (12).  Yippee whoopy!  They are delightful.  They are just a touch oily so next time I'll cut the oil back.  they have a fine texture.

Delicious! I looked for a new recipe today, because I didn't have any eggs in the house. I subbed Sucanat (SUgar CAne NAtural) for the white sugar and whey (leftover from recently making yogurt) for the almond milk. The slight taste of coconut is wonderful. I will be making these again... soon!

This was a GREAT recipe. I had never made a vegan dessert before and I really liked this one. I made my own version of it that I think is pretty good too, using similar ingredients and procedure, but with some spice!

1 TBS apple cider vinegar (You may also mix regular vinegar with apple juice, I've done that when I don't have A.C.V. and it's been fine)

1 cup chai tea concentrate (I have been using Dragonfly brand Sweet Tea Chai)

1/2 cups almond or soy milk (what you have handy/prefer. If you're not vegan then regular milk works fine, or you can go half way in between and use lactose free milk!)

2 cups all purpose flour

1 cup white sugar

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt

1/2 cup coconut oil, warmed until melted (This is part of the original vegan cupcake recipe. I don't have coconut oil so I use 1/2 canola oil with a tsp coconut extract or simply 1/2 cup oil)

1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

 

 

In a small bowl, combine apple cider vinegar, chai tea, and milk. Stir and set aside to allow milk to curdle slightly. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the melted coconut oil and vanilla to the chai liquid mix and stir. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-22 minutes. These will be a bit more doughy than regular, fluffy cupcakes.

I'm not even a vegan, but I have to say, these cupcakes were absolutely amazing! Since im not vegan, I used canola oil and regular milk, the texture was nice and moist, I wouldn't say it was fluffy like cake but it was still delicious. I topped them with some chocolate icing and they were good to go:)

Liked the texture, did not care for the flavor. It may just be my kitchen, but the cupcakes tasted heavily of flour. We're adjusting the recipe to see what works. Such as lowering the amount of flour, adding more vanilla and sugar. I want people to taste my cupcake and be shocked that it's vegan, not think, "Well, it IS vegan." As an avid baker, and recently turned vegan, I'm looking for a recipe good enough to replace my infamous brownies. The quest continues. The only thing we changed was the oil, as we didn't have coconut oil. This recipe is a great starting point, though.

I'm not vegan. I love eggs and butter in my baked good. However this cupcakes came out tender and light without using an egg substitute. I topped them with some homemade chocolate almond butter. It pretty much was the perfect cupcake.

Delicious! Made them for my son's second birthday,no one knew they were vegan! I made cupcakes, mini cupcakes, and a small round cake out of two batches.  I would stick to cupcakes next time as the cake took a really long time to cook all the way through.  Delicious though, especially with sprinkles!

Wow! Amazing cupcakes! I was so impressed that I honestly didn't notice the lack of eggs or milk! Actually had multiple omnivorous (and oblivious!) friends mention that they were the best vanilla cupcakes they had ever had. I also made this into a 8" round cake to act as the middle layer of a three layer cake (in between the Vegan Chocolate Cake recipe on allrecipes.com). It didn't rise a lot, but as the middle layer, it worked perfectly fine.

Wonderful cupcakes!  I made them chocolate by adding 1/2 cup of Cocoa powder to the coconut oil and vanilla, mixing it together on a low heat and letting it cool before whisking in the almond milk.
Thanks so much for the recipe!

These are so yummy.  I love coconut oil and almonds - the smell of the cupcakes baking is wonderful and faint.  I cooked them in the babycakes cupcake maker.  I used white vinegar (forgot to get apple cider vinegar), unsweetened almond milk and turbinado sugar.  These were the only variations I made.  Made a thin lemon icing using powdered sugar and the juice and rind of one lemon.  My husband likes cakes sweeter, so I thinned the icing with more lemon, poked holes in the cake and poured some of the thinned icing, then topped the cupcake with thicker icing.  I will make this again and again.

I'm not vegan but was craving cupcakes and wanted to make a healthier alternative.  These are amazing!  Cook time was approx 20 min. I substituted sunflower oil for the coconut oil as one of the reviewers suggested.  Used the Vanilla powdered sugar frosting recipe on here and will definately be making these cupcakes again!  Thank you

Wow, what a recipe! I saw this online yesterday and made them this morning. They are really fantastic: so light, and not too sweet.  My kids loved them too.  I made a basic vegan frosting to go with it (spectrum shortening, vanilla, vanilla almond milk and powdered sugar).  I will be using this recipe in the future for sure, as my son has a dairy & soy allergy.

Excellent! Whether vegan or not it's simply excellent. Can't believe someone would rate this a four let alone a three. Maybe they used refined coconut oil, unrefined has an excellent flavor and should be used. Refined has no flavor and none of the benefits of unrefined.

All the great reviews sold me on trying this recipe out.  I wanted something new so I took the opportunity when making cupcakes for my niece's birthday.  I doubled the ingredients and made two dozen cupcakes.  Half I flavored with coconut extract and the other with lemon.  The cake's texture was much different than a standard yellow cake.  It's moist, dense and spongier.  People could tell they were different.  They were still very much enjoyed.  Some said they preferred the standard cake to this version but that may just be from the stigma of hearing "vegan".  I flavored one dozen lemon and the other coconut.  I used a lil over one tablespoon of extract in the divided batters but the flavor came out too subtle.  Next time I would up to two tablspoons each.  I frosted with a swiss meringue buttercream that I also flavored lemon and coconut.  They had a nice summery feel.  All in all people gave them higher praise for looks over taste.  I'd make again but maybe for a more accepting crowd.  Definitely glad I tried to this out.

I made these exactly as directed on recipe and they are the BEST!  I have friends who are vegan and made them for them - I am so glad they are vegan or I may not have tried such a recipe....boy would I have missed out!  These are great vanilla tasting cupcakes - with or without icing they are good.  Also, they are very moist and very easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  It is my go-to for cupcakes now!

very easy to make. I made these last night. They are moist and dense. I made a vegan frosting out of tofutti cream cheese,earht bound spread, vanilla,and powdered sugar. Obviously not the exact same as "regular" cupcakes but very good. I would make em again.

I work at an organic/health food grocery store, and this is by and far the BEST vegan dessert that I have ever tasted. This recipe was super easy to follow (even for non-vegans like me). I topped it off with a mix of orange juice and confectioner's sugar. My vegan and non-vegan friends were delighted! Thank you so much for sharing such a tasty recipe!

I found these cupcakes a little too dense and "bready" texture-wise. The flavor was good, and the chocolate and vanilla frosting I put on top was good. Got mixed reviews at work, but most people enjoyed them and would not have known they were vegan if I didn't tell them.

These are really, really good, and I don't bake vegan, but had to give these a try. I added just a little extra coconut extract to the batter and left out the vanilla flavoring. The cocoa-orange juice-powdered sugar makes an amazing frosting for them. Will make again!

These are AMAZING. I can't get enough! This recipe was so easy to make and the cupcakes are wonderful. I didn't even frost them, I was so impatient to try one :) The frosting suggested does sound good though - I'll try that next time. Wouldn't change a thing about these. YUM YUM YUM!

True vegans do not eat white sugar.   During the final purification process, cane sugar is filtered through activated carbon (charcoal) which may be of animal, vegetable, or mineral origin. The “white sugar” can be replaced with beet sugar or unbleached sugar to be truly vegan.   With the exception of that, these are very good.

I'm not vegan, but used this recipe and it was fabulous - like eating marzipan in cake form.  Being not vegan, I used cow's milk in place of the almond milk (which did not curdle), but did everything else the same - except used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Loved the texture, the flavor, and ingredients (going to buy almond milk tonight).  Will be my go-to cupcake recipe, especially for my lactose intolerant nephew (ironically his sister is allergic to coconut!).

Normally i HATE vegan foods, but these are absolutely delicious. i was going to a pot luck and many of my friends are vegetarian and a few gluten-free... This is my go to recipe for those friends(except the gluten-free) and now they always ask and expect them. Great job with this recipe... One thing, i did not have access to almond milk, so i substituted coconut milk and it turned out great!

Made these for a vegan friend for her birthday.  She was pleasantly surprised at my efforts.  She ate 4 cupcakes upon presentation! The recipe made 16 standard size cupcakes, which baked up beautifully.  I made a buttercream frosting with Earth Balance spread, powdered sugar, almond milk and vanilla extract.
In making these again, I would definitely sub applesauce for some of the oil.  They were a bit on the greasy side.

I LOOOVEEE this recipe. I have made it so many times and always got excellent results. I have a few friends in my job that are vegan so I always use this recipe when making dessert to my job. No one notice is vegan because the outcome is exactly as regular non vegan cupcakes. VEERRRYY YUUUMMYYYY!!

I've been vegan for 3 years, and this is the first time I ever got my cupcakes to rise and poof up! I was so excited when I took them out of the oven.  I ended up only making 12 and filling them up higher- 3 tablespoons per cupcake.  The wrapper came off super easily, too.  They were just a little sticky, but that was to be expected.  They weren't at all dense like the ones I used to make.  This is a recipe to stay! I also used vegetable oil instead of coconut oil, and I used RAW apple cider vinegar, which I think had a better effect on the curdling with the almond milk.  Can't wait to share these with everyone!

I've made these twice now and decided I need to review these, as they are fantastic!  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly.  I made them for my daughter's birthday celebration at school.  They passed the second-grader test and the teachers told me they were some of the best cupcakes they'd ever had.  No one even knew they were vegan.  I just made a second batch for my son's birthday.  He requested lemon cupcakes, so I used lemon juice instead of apple cider vinegar and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon zest to the batter.  I just tasted one, and it will take some serious will power not to eat them all before the party!  The subtle lemon flavor paired with the coconut oil is a seriously good combination.  They're not super lemony, but paired with a lemon frosting, they will be amazing.  Thanks for the great, versatile recipe!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe except used chocolate soy milk.  My boyfriend recently became vegan and he hadn't indulged in a sweet treat for months.  He loved them and more surprising to me...I loved them (I'm definitely NOT a vegan!) No frosting necessary, in my opinion! I'm baking some now for his birthday that would have otherwise been absent a cake treat.  Thank you!

I hate to leave such a low rating, but this recipe was just all wrong for me. Let me preface my review by saying that I don't practice veganism and have only had vegan cupcakes on one occasion before this so I am using that recipe as a comparison. I didn't find this one to be sweet enough and it had a strange flavor. I brought them into the office and we ended up tossing them away after one of the guys said his dog "wouldn't go near these" (harsh, I know!). I will stick to the other vegan cupcake recipe my sister shared with me. It was perfectly sweet and you would never guess it wasn't a "regular" cupcake.

I am a new vegan and LOVE cupcakes, so was pleasantly suprised how well these turned out. Delicious! I did as a few others, and changed things here an there, using canola oil instead of the coconut. I used self rising flour but also added the baking powder and soda and they rose quite nicely.
I used a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. It didn't give the frosting measurments above so I used a cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and a few tablespoons of OJ until I reached a consistency of thick icing. I left 4 cupcakes and iced with raspberry jam and shredded coconut.

I made these into spice cupcakes to celebrate the fall and I used a few substitutions. I substituted coconut oil for healthy balance oil, and the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour (to make myself feel a little better). I also didnt have apple cider or white vinegar, so I heated some milk and added balsmic vinegar, which didnt affect the taste at all. To make them spice I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. They turned out delicious. I didnt have anything to make frosting so Ive been topping them with a thin layer of nutella and I love them!!!  GREAT CUPCAKES!

Wow!  Yummy.  FYI I found Vegan Sugar at Whole Foods.  It's not as fine a grain, but it worked great for me.  Also - I only got 12 regular cupcakes from this recipe.

Wow! These are so good I almost don't want to put frosting on them! I have been wanting to cook with coconut oil more so I am happy to have found this recipe. Didn't have almond milk but had half and half so just mixed half and half with water, then added a few drops of almond extract! Not so vegan anymore, but still great! YUM!

I don't like cupcakes, but I made these with a persistent and an extremely picky 6-year-old eater. She LOVES LOVES them, and actually, so does everyone else in the house. They didn't even mention that I didn't use "real" ingredients (cow's milk). :)  Thank you for the easy recipe.

Great vegan recipe.  I used vanilla soymilk and canola oil as that is what I had in my fridge.  These are not very sweet and I actually think they would make a better muffin than cupcake.    ***Update***  I made these again with the soymilk and canola oil as muffins.  I put in some chopped up blackberries I had and bit of extra sugar.  No frosting.  Very good vegan muffin!

These are outstanding cupcakes!  I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they rose just fine.  They were incredibly moist and tasted like coconut.  I doubt anyone would be able to tell that they are vegan.

Did a bit of substitution. Portion all stayed the same. Used whey protein powder as the milk (its all I had, as I don't drink any milk regularly), used brown sugar, used whole wheat flower, I added a 1/2 teaspoon more of baking powder, used a sifter to blend all the dry ingredients with exception of the sugar-added that after, used canola oil as I did not have coconut oil. Didn't use the apple cider. Didn't have cupcake pan so I made it into a few small loafs. I got a normal rise out of the cakes. I over cooked it a bit though to get a nice crunchy shell, all at 350 degrees started the timer at 30 minutes added 10 to 15 minutes accordingly to get the outside a nice firm shell, I started monitoring the oven at the 25 minute mark. I made sure to constantly check the center to make sure it baked all the way through. cool completely before you taste. Very tasty, nice shell, soft and fluffy on the inside. This would taste great if it had nuts. I didn't use a blender, I whisked and then used a wooden spoon.

Lovely texture, though they don't rise as much as a traditional cupcake.  I also made these with some chai spices (cinnamon, clove, cardamom, black pepper) and they were very good.

Doesn't need to be apple cider vinegar - I used plain white b/c it's what I had on hand.

Also made a simple icing using icing sugar, coconut oil, cinnamon and some orange syrup - worked quite well.

Oh man, I tried this recipe. The texture and flavor are awesome! I never would have guessed these are vegan. BTW, all fat coconut milk works great. Family loves them! Dad didn't even know they were vegan! Truly amazing. Not one didn't rise. Again, truly, truly, amazing!

I read the reviews of this recipe, and I was sure to warm the almond milk mixture before I added the melted coconut oil.  I made it as a cake and added frozen blueberries to the batter.  When the cake cooled, I dusted it with powdered sugar and some chopped toasted coconut flakes.  Everyone loved the cake. It was moist and full of flavor.  I don't think anyone would guess it was vegan if I didn't tell them!

Mine came out gumm. I even put them back in the oven for 10 more minutes hoping they were just undercooked but they were still gummy and stuck to the liners. Not sure where I went wrong; they had a great flavor but I couldn't get past the texture. I also wish that I knew they wouldn't rise much (first time making a vegan cupcake and I'm told that low-rise is the norm) I would have filled them more.

Excellent recipe, can substitute almond milk for rice or coconut milk, coconut oil can also be substituted for vegan butter.

I am sooooooooooo far from vegan but made these for my friend. First time making vegan anything, using coconut oil or even tasting almond milk. MY GOD!! These were the best cupcakes I've ever made. So simple yet they punch you in the face with perfection. If anything they were better the next day. Almost like a cheesecake texture. I read through the comments and stole someones idea for some icing as well and it was just a coconut orgasm. My friends mom tried them and wanted the recipe. No way! I'm going to be hanging this recipe over everyones head. If you want to eat it you must go through me first! :p This could almost turn me to the dark side (almost). Totally recommend to EVERYONE!!

super easy. super moist. super delicious. this is one of the first vegan recipes I have come across that didn't require ingredients that I didn't have on hand which is the best part. that means I can whip them up anytime. truly this was a fast simple recipe.

I truly think this is the best, hands down recipe for a white base vegan cupcake. I changed the proportions of some of the ingredients to suit what I thought the cupcakes were lacking in taste and texture. Also,to get a better risen and domed cupcake. They get rave reviews for a reason!!

These were my first vegan cupcakes that I have made and there we're great! I used rice milk instead of almond. I also added lemon essential oil to the mixture and then added few fresh blueberries in when I had the batter in the muffin pan. Made a vegan lemon cream cheese frosting to go on top! AMAZING!

I made these for my son's birthday and brought them to his class. I got so many hugs! The kids loved them. I didn't have enough coconut oil, so I just used canola, but they turned out great all the same. Nice and tender, and they rose just fine. Next time I make these, I'll make sure I have coconut oil on hand.

Well, the flavor is really good but once you pour the coconut  oil in the almond milk, it hardens. Maybe need a integrative almond milk should be room temperature even though I let it stand for 10 minutes waiting for the milk to curdle.

This recipe was okay, but it was a little chewy, I found that if you put them in the fridge they lost their chewy texture.  I also thought it was very annoying that they didn't have the recipe for the frosting mentioned in the description.

My 11-year old son and I made these and we added two teaspoons of cocoa powder and some carob chips to make chocolate, chocolate chip cupcakes. They were moist and delicious. Though, they did take a few more minutes to bake than the recipe called for.

Love these cupcakes. They are light, fluffy, and not too sweet - I literally just inhaled 3 of them just right now. The frosting really makes a huge difference, too. I use the Homemade Vanilla Buttercream Cake Frosting I found on Vegweb.com.

I made these cupcakes and they were okay. Although the coconut oil gave them a nice flavor, they were very oily. I found that they were very moist, which is always a good thing in baking. They were easy to make, very soft, and light and fluffy. But they stuck to the cupcake paper like crazy!!!

Amazing!  First time ever leaving a comment because these were really, really great.  Don't know if I'll ever use a different recipe.....even if I have eggs and butter!  Thanks for sharing!  I did add cocoa into the dry ingredients, and used the frosting recipe.  Still licking my lips!!!

I goofed & forgot to add the coconut oil... but the muffins came out just fine; perhaps because I used coconut milk, which gave the batter some fat? This is an excellent "base" recipe; I'm looking forward to experimenting with variations, like adding blueberries, cranberries, pumpkin... maybe even trying a savory version with less sugar and sharp cheddar & green chili. These muffins are great to make when you need to accommodate a vegan at the table but also want to please folks accustomed to the texture & quality of muffins made with butter & eggs. Thank you so much for sharing!

Awesome recipe. Made it last night, everybody was raving about these. I did not have coconut oil, so I sub. with canola oil. Also, used an extra 1/2 tsp. of baking powder instead of baking soda and added a little apple juice and o.j. to the mixture. Will make again today with blueberries and baking soda. Very light and fluffy and easy recipe to make.

I used half the sugar, soy milk, and canola oil.  Still a great recipe producing a soft moist good looking cupcake. I am unable to have milk and milk products and this recipe is perfect.  Simple and versatile, I filled the cupcakes with vanilla pudding and topped with chocolate glaze. Very good.

Very delicious! Expensive to make because of the coconut oil, but if you're a vegan, I suppose you're probably used to your ingredients costing more.   Didn't use the recommended frosting instructions, went with a vegan chocolate frosting that I found on another website - delicious.

I just made these cupcakes and they are so easy and delicious! I made a simple icing of confectioners sugar, lemon juice and vanilla. Yum!

I love these cupcakes & so does everyone who eats them!  No one would ever guess they were vegan.  I rarely have almond milk handy so I use the vanilla soy & add almond extract.

Failed! I used this recipe for mini-cupcakes. I thought it would bake faster, but they actually came out with a rock-hard shell and undercooked center (after way more time than the recipe said!)

I used gluten free flour and 1/2 whole milk 1/2 kefir for the milk/vinegar, otherwise followed the directions and they were great!!! The gluten free flour is the Cup4Cup multipurpose gluten free flour.

The only changes I made were coconut milk for the almond milk and I used distilled white vinegar in place of the ACV. These cupcakes were amazing! The texture was perfect, not dense like most other vegan cupcakes. I made a coconut cream chocolate frosting for these. I will definitely be making these again!

this. The cupkes come out 100% according to the recipe. The slight change I made was adding 1 Tbsp of flaxseed and 1 Tbsp of quinoa flour.

I made this as a trial for an order for a co-worker's son birthday.  I was amazed!  I used everything except I substituted Soy milk for the almond milk and I used canola oil instead of the coconut oil.  it was light and fluffy and didn't have an aftertaste.   I took the trial to my non-vegan co-workers to try without telling them they were vegan.  They also liked them.  The only con is they didn't rise and I think  that was because of the lack of egg.  I might try to use an egg replacement the next time. This is definitely a keeper.

I made it as cupcakes and I made it as cake.  I doubled the recipe and made a 4 layer 6inch cake.  It was perfect.  The cupcakes I made with almond milk, the cake with soy milk.  I used the vanilla flavored ones with both.  So moist, so yummy.

Turned out chewy and sticky and tastes like dough instead of vanilla. Very bland and not as impressive as I expected from the reviews.

Oh man.... TYPOS, guys!!! This recipe says 1 1/2 cups almond milk to 2 cups flour. That is WAY too much milk! Mine overflowed in the oven and turned into a disaster. Next time, it should be 1/2 cup almond milk.

Great recipe! For my second batch, I reduced the flour to one cup and added a half cup of shredded coconut with a couple drops of coconut extract. Delicious! They were a hit.

These cupcakes are sooooo good.  I found this recipe after having a real big craving for cupcakes and they turned out amazing! They are so light and fluffy and when they are warm they are even better. My batch made about 16 cupcakes but of course this differs between how much you fill your tins. I used cupcake liners and they popped out of each liner super easily when ready to eat(almost too easily, I almost dropped one!). And they are very easy to make, because the ingredients are things that can be easily found around the house. Although instead of using coconut oil, I opted for using vegetable oil and it worked out splendidly! Even if you aren't vegan I really think these cupcakes are worth making!

This is my first time making vegan cupcakes. I was a bit worried because the recipe note at the top stated that they don’t raise like regular cupcakes.  I am an avid baker, and thought maybe it would help the rising process if I sifted the flour and sugar. Oh my they turned out beautiful. They raised perfectly, and tasted scrumptious. I even filled the cupcakes with pie filling apples before baking. I love your recipe, and will for sure use this over and over.

I'm not vegan but I'm so glad I tried this recipe -- I had lots of almond milk on hand so I looked for a recipe with this milk. This recipe is a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleasantly surprised.  Here are a couple things I would note for myself next time: the cider vinegar and almond milk didn't curdle as I thought it should, even after leaving it for twice as long.  That said, it didn't seem to make a difference to the final outcome.  The other note for next time is to reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup (1 3/4 cup total). Thank you for sharing this recipe.

These turned out perfectly! I must admit that I made changes and I am only commenting in case somebody didn't need these to be fully vegan. I only needed them to be egg-free so I used buttermilk instead of almond milk and vinegar, and butter instead of coconut oil. I will definitely be using this recipe again for egg-free treats for school!

(It was that bad i bothered to make an account)
Made it as is written.
Very accurately and it just wasn't good...
Maybe my standards  are too high but those cupcakes felt like cheap preserved cupcakes with a taste and aftertaste of  preservatives...
I really hoped this recipe will turn out great.
Though, the search continues...

It was so moist and delicious. I used monk fruit sugar instead of regular sugar for health reasons. Some one said they were dense, not light and fluffy. But I didnt mind at all. I made them for a birthday party and my son wanted to eat all of them lol. I will make this again.

I was scrolling down this website (because I clicked on an add by accident) and saw this. However, I am not vegan, but it inspired me to make cupcakes, and they were good. 5/5

I'm not vegan but my niece is so I was looking for a cupcake  recipe for her wedding shower.  These cupcakes are delicious, moist and flavorful.  They were a hit with all of the guests and I agree with another reviewer about being a go-to recipe.

Excellent recipe! Unlike many vegan bakery recipe epic fails where the chemistry doesn’t allow the baked goods to rise properly or the taste is “off,” these plumped up nicely and were soft, cakey, and delicious. Top with Allrecipe “Buttercream Icing,” subbing Earth Balance for butter and soy milk for milk.

Soooo good! But I tried to fit all of the batter into just 12 cups, and that was overambitious. :-D (It took ~24 minutes to cook through.) I'm not even vegan, but the reviews praised these so highly that I had to try 'em. I'm glad I did!

Super easy, fast, and easy to divide or double the recipe. I made it using 1/3 of the ingredients to make 6 cupcakes. Since I’m plant based and celiac, I used Bob’s Red Mill 1:1 all purpose GF flour mix (with the blue labeling-the red has too much garbanzo bean flour and no xanthan gum in the mix), and soy milk. For the “buttercream” I used Earth Balance/vanilla/organic powdered sugar/matcha green tea powder. I’ll definitely be making this recipe again!

I've experimented with different milks and oils and they are all good. My favorite is whole milk and coconut oil, vegetable oil works fine too. Remember to warm up the milk if you use coconut oil otherwise it will become a messy clump when it hits the cold milk.

I didn't curdle the almond milk, and the recipe came out great--filled the cupcakes with morello cherries and topped them with dark chocolate chips instead of frosting (because we're not frosting-type people), and even the husband, who is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy proclaimed them as delicious.  They are. Never going back to the egg-based kind.

Absolutely delicious! Very moist and great flavor. Made a simple chocolate glaze with powdered sugar, cocoa, almond milk, and vanilla extract.  I used all the batter for 12 cupcakes rather than 24 and they were perfect.

Amazing cupcakes. They are moist and have a delicious lighter taste, not as overly sweet, as ordinary cupcakes.  Will definitely be my 'go to' recipe moving forward.

I used vegetable oil instead of coconut. I also threw in a handful of sprinkles right before putting them in the muffin tin to make “funfetti” cupcakes. These were so tasty and nobody knew they were vegan! Will definitely make this again. I was nervous that you would be able to smell the apple cider vinegar but you couldn’t at all.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have vanilla almond milk so I used chocolate almond milk instead and added a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder to turn them into chocolate cupcakes.  They turned out delicious!  they rose nicely.  the cupcakes were very moist and tender.  The Mr. didn't know they were vegan until I told him.  He's pretty picky and even he was impressed!  I will definitely use this again perhaps even as my go to cupcake recipe.

I live in NM and I had to bake for 25 minutes and they came out perfect!  Next time I may even bake at 375 degrees to brown a little.  Next time I'm adding chocolate chips.  I think these cupcakes are way better than regular ones.

The perfect basic vegan cupcake recipe. It rises well unlike other recipes. I used way more vanilla than what the recipe called for, and used sunflower oil instead of coconut oil. Topped it off with vegan lemon buttercream frosting and it was AMAZING!

Tasted great! I would like to use liquid coconut oil next time since the solid clumped back together when added to the almond milk mixture. The cakes still turned out but there were a few small holes where the oil clumps melted.

The wet ingredients amounted to wat more than needed with the dry ingredients and I had to add extra flour. The flavor profile is completely off and the cupcakes did not rise above cupcake holders. Cooking time was much longer than 15 to 20 minutes.

My family loves these cupcakes.  Made them for a party and everyone ate these instead of the non-vegan chocolate cupcakes.  I've made them a few times now and always a huge hit.  Making them again tonight for my daughters 18th bday. ;)

My dairy free son can enjoy cupcakes again!  This is a good recipe that I will make again.  I suspect it may be better than our experience because I had to use gluten free flour.  Initially I was underwhelmed with the final result but I tried another one the next day and it was much better!  I think the flour I've been using needs time to absorb the moisture and soften up a bit.

Great vegan cupcakes, although mine were more like muffins. I put 1/2 and 1/2 whole wheat flour and white flour. As well, 1/2 and 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar.  Also added some cashews, chia and cranberries.  Absolutely delicious!

Was super anxious at the thought of making this since I almost never bake. I substituted the almond milk for soy and it actually came out wonderfully!  I also used cinnamon over the icing as a light garnish. :) Will be making this again!

Very nice and moist! I would recommend adding something aromatic in addition to the vanilla, such as orange zest, cinammon or liquer, as they are a bit flat.

This recipe turned out so delicious! I wanted them to be chocolate cupcakes so I only used 1.5 cups of flour and then used .5 cup of cocao powder and they turned out so moist and chocolatey. I also used olive oil in place of the coconut oil.

Very good!! I'd rather use Vanilla Almond Milk for a much better taste. However, it is a bit soggy and not as tough as a regular cupcake.

This recipe is amazingly easy, moist and delicious! I've made two batch for cupcake centerpiece for my engagement party and it turned out beautifully, no crack, flat top, delicious moist cake. Everyone complimented me for the delicious cupcakes. Trust what the reviewers said and give this recipe a try. One thing I like to add that you should mix it well until the sugar dissolved properly to prevent some cupcake being too sweet from the other. I kind of mix it a bit too little so the last few cupcake from the batter is too sweet.

I've been looking for a decent vegan vanilla cupcake recipe for quite some time. I think I finally found it. This is by far the best vegan vanilla cupcake I've ever had. The only changes I made to the recipe was to use organic refined coconut oil instead of unrefined because I didn't want a coconut flavor. I also stirred the melted coconut oil into the flour mixture before adding the milk because I've had issues in the past with coconut oil solidifying when added to cold liquid...  other than that the recipe was prepared as instructed. Made 17 cupcakes....definitely will make this recipe again and again.

My little guy was diagnosed with a severe dairy allergy so I've been looking for a non-dairy cake recipe for quite some time. I came across this and figuerd why not... it looks like it will work. I did everything EXACTLY  as stated in the recipe.  Knowing that the coconut oil was being mixed in with the almond milk  then with the dry ingredients, I made sure to wait to warm up the oil until I was ready for it. The cupcakes were light and fluffy. Two out of 18 cupcakes turned out a bit dense but that may have been placement in the oven. Other than that everything was perfect. Little man absolutely loved it. He and his older brother devoured all of the cupcakes.  I'll definitely be making these again.

Finally! I've been searching for a good, basic vanilla cake recipe.  The recipe was simple to follow and they baked up light and fluffy! This time around I substituted rum extract and topped with eggnog buttercream for the holidays.  the possibilities are endless!

I was making these for a dairy free friend, so I did whip one egg white and add at the end. Also, added sprinkles. Heated the oven to 400 degrees F and then turned down to 350 degrees F when I put the cupcakes in the oven (a trick to help them get the nice rounded top). Will add a little more vanilla next time to give them a stronger vanilla flavor, but they turned out excellent! I will make them again!

Oily and super soaked through the paper liners. I think it had a flavor of cornbread. I'll stick to my vegan recipes.

This is my second time making this recipe and both times I've loved it. My mother became vegan not long ago and I had to search for a new recipe to make her on her birthday/Mothers' Day. This time around I halfed the recipe and made about 20 mini cupcakes. They are so light and fluffy and loved by the whole family! If you want a denser cupcake a recommend just leaving it in the fridge overnight.

I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I used peppermint and it turned out yummy. It has a slight cool taste, but all in all its great. I made these for my daughter, she's Vegan and now that I've tasted them, I'll be sure to make them again.

This is a fantastic recipe! Easy to add different flavors. I use freeze dried fruit to make any fruit flavor without color bleeding. I’ve used every type of non dairy milk with equal success. This also bakes up very beautiful cakes. I turn down to 325 and bake until the center is not jiggly. I don’t time things so I’m not sure how long it actually takes to bake them into cakes.

Made these exactly as described and thought they were great. When scooping them into the muffin tin I was worried there was not enough moisture but once cooked they came out just fine. They are just a tad on the denser side but still quite fluffy.  This can make a great base for any flavoured cake you'd like to make. So glad I finally found a good vegan vanilla cake batter.

I made these and added some almond extract; yum! however I baked this for around 25-30 minutes and they seemed to be raw or maybe the coconut oil made it seem that way. I don't know what I did wrong but they still taste okay.

My family recently began to convert our household to veganism for health reasons, and there was a birthday coming up. The test batch of these cupcakes did not disappoint! They are a little more crumbly than the conventional cupcakes I have made in the past. The flavor is lightly coconut and delicious!

Followed exact recipe because I'm new to the Vegan lifestyle and didn't want to risk anything, but when I followed this recipe, the end result tasted like corn bread.  I didn't mind it, but I was expecting it to taste sweet not savory. Maybe it was the fact that I used unsweetened almond milk.

I will definitely be making this again! I Added cocoa powder and used chocolate cream cheese icing.  It was probably the best cupcake I've ever had! Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly as is. I served the cupcakes the following day, so did not eat them fresh. The cupcakes were moist but firm, almost between the texture of pound cake and sponge cake. A little too firm for my liking, but the flavor was really nice. I rated this recipe 3 stars instead of 4 because it did not yield enough batter to fill two 12-cup muffin pans. I only had enough for 20 cupcakes instead of 24.

I used lemon juice rice milk
And canola oil, they did not rise the right way. They were dense and doughy (even after 25 min in the oven). Does anyone know what happened here?

I have made these twice. They are delicious and always a hit at work. I substitute canola for the coconut oil because I can't eat coconut, but they're still great. This last time I spread a little apricot preserve on top and sprinkled on some crushed walnuts. Delectable :)

I used So Delicious chocolate coconut milk (carrageenan free) and instead of the regular flour, I made them gluten free by substituting with 1/2 cup of coconut flour and 1-1/2 cups of brown rice flour. I am new to this stuff since having my now 6 month old who is currently suffering from many food intolerances (oh the joys of 13 days of antibiotics at 5 weeks old and a previously recent diagnosis of dairy and egg intolerance!--which if anyone is going through the same thing- I cannot stress enough the importance of good probiotics for your wee one!). Anyways--- I had no idea what to expect--- I used a dark nonstick cupcake pan so I lowered the temp to 325 degrees. Those cuppycakes were definitely not done after 15 or 20 mins! So I kept adding 5 more mins to the timer. All in all they were in there for a good 30-35 mins until I could tap them and feel them firm enough to where they won't just fall apart and/or crumble, etc. To my surprise they were super delicious and moist in the middle! If you do try to make it gluten free and/or lower the temp because of nonstick bakeware, I would just suggest keeping an eye on them so they don't over-bake either. Now to attempt a yummy vegan, gluten and soy free frosting! Oh my baby, how I must love him! I mean, he is pretty adorable and all ;) He better take care of me when I am old and decrepit! Haha!

Perfect moist and spongy texture but not the most appetizing corny taste. I ended up mashing a banana and using that as a quick diluting 'frosting' which disguised the not-too-pleasant taste of the cupcakes.

Best vegan cupcakes! Kids loved them! Husband-who never eats sweets ate 5!! Made with Almond coconut milk and substituted 1/4ts vanilla with almond extract. If making minis reduce baking time to about 12min. Careful not to overtake because they WILL become rock hard .

This is EXCELLENT -- far better than ordinary cupcakes!

First of all, one can use a combination of bread flour and all-purpose flour if necessary. You can mix many kinds of dry ingredients (nuts, chopped fruit, berries, etc.) with this recipe and it turns out great. I personally liked throwing in a dozen or so muddled raspberries and two dozen fresh cranberries I had on hand. This recipe is also nice in that it isn't overwhelmingly sweet, and it doesn't taste like baking soda or baking powder (something I'm sensitive to). The cupcakes can be frozen, refrigerated (etc.) and they're still great. 

Other comments (from other reviewers): any kind of oil seems to work well (my wife uses vegetable oil), it's important to mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, a hint of orange juice or orange zest can be used, and so on.

Eh. I agree with others who said they were a bit like cornbread - or maybe the texture of banana bread. Not a fine crumb, but heavier and more dense. Flavor was fine. They were ok, but not very cupcake-like in texture for me, so I'll look for another recipe.

These are easy and came out nicely and I feel that it may be versatile so you can probably add your own twist to it. I want to try cinnamon or cocoa powder next time.

I use coconut milk instead of almond, brown sugar and whole wheat flour. Sometimes it takes 25 min to bake. Adding berries on the top makes these cupcakes even better!

These were very tasty and no need for frosting. I did change a few ingredients such as vanilla kefir instead of the almond milk and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I now have a go-to egg free cake batter. I might try it with a gluten free flour next time. Thank you!

Very good...I recommend using vanilla flavored almond milk it adds a little bit more sweetness.

Easy recipe. Cupcakes came out soft and yummy. Didn't rise much. My icing was a disaster!

Just made these - hands down the best cupcakes I've made to date!
Followed the recipe, but instead of regular almond milk, I used the low fat vanilla kind (what I had on hand).  I also increased the baking soda so 1/4 tsp, and used regular vinegar.  Baked for 15 min, and they rose perfectly :)

Three more things... I didn't use white sugar but rather raw cane (after running it through the food processor to make fine), substituted vegan | non-hydrogenated | melted shortening for the oil (ran out of olive oil ~ who does that?) and did as a few suggested and added a 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa to the second half of the batter.  These cupcakes were moist and delightfully delicious. This is now my go-to recipe for cupcakes... Thanks, again!

These are delicious! I used coconut milk instead of almond milk and they were still very vanilla-y.  Then i made a cherry glaze with conf sugar, cherry oil & vanilla extract.  I can't wait to make these again! Next time i want to try a chai glaze over them.

I was looking for an eggless cupcake recipe for my friend who's allergic to eggs. I used skim milk instead of almond milk and lemon juice instead of vinegar. I also used melted butter instead of coconut oil.  I added lemon extract  instead of vanilla.  They turned out perfect! For those looking for an eggless recipe not necessarily a vegan one this is the recipe for you!! I topped it off with the butter cream frosting II -an eggless frosting added some lemon extract to that as well. They turned out perfect!

The most moist cupcake I've ever had or made, it was phenomenal. I made a peanut butter frosting to go with it, using almond milk, powdered sugar, and a dash of vanilla extract, and they turned out great. loved this recipe!

Vegan food is not yet easily available even in cities like London. I hope that it will be soon when recipes like this one become popular. The reason they are not very common is that many café owners are not familiar with alternative ways of making delicious desserts like this one. I haven’t tried this recipe yet but I am very much looking forward to give it a try.

Love This Recipe! Guess What I Made These With  Whole Wheat Flour And They Came Out Really Good. I Kept Having Such A Hard Time Making My Cupcakes Fluff Up  Without  Eggs But These Come Out Really Moist And Fluffy. The Possibilities Are Endless Now With This Basic Recipe. I'm Going To Make Them With Different Add Ins.  Very Good And Easy Vegan Recipe!

I made these with my little niece today, and we both loved them! She really wanted chocolate, so I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder plus 1 1/2 tablespoons more of almond milk.  I also subbed canola oil for the coconut oil, and they turned out great!  (The chocolate flavor was still pretty subtle, so if you want a dark chocolate flavor, you'll need to make more adjustments.)

These cupcakes were easy to bake and a total hit at my office, when combined with an avacado, cocoa and honey icing. (not vegan).  Will definitely make them again.

What a great recipe! These cupcakes are beautiful and so easy to make! I made them for a birthday party alongside some red velvet cupcakes and I have to say these were devoured first and everyone loved them. The chocolate frosting recipe with the orange juice is awesome too! I don't like orange and chocolate together, but you couldn't taste the orange at all! I will definitely be making these again!

Absolutely delicious cupcakes! I used rice milk instead of almond milk-- when the rice milk didn't curdle, I got a little nervous as the batter was a soup-like consistency. But after cooking for 20 minutes, the cupcakes were cooked through to a perfectly dense/moist texture! I made a few different frostings: one with powdered sugar, cocoa powder, fresh-squeezed oj, and a little sea salt; and one with powdered sugar, fresh-squeezed oj, and a little vanilla. The chocolate was the clear winner, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a sweet/salty punch! Thanks for this incredible recipe!

Made these for a family get-together because my aunt has gone vegan for health reasons.  The rest of my family...not vegan.  I made a simple frosting made of powdered sugar, orange juice, and orange zest.  Everyone, vegan and non-vegan alike, LOVED this.  Great recipe!

This cupcake has a different texture to it. It isn't you typical cupcake. After eating it you don't feel like you have a overload of sweets. But if you put icing on it then it is a different story.

Great recipe! I always go to vegan recipes when I run out of eggs or butter and I think its a keeper! I used normal milk but didn't have the apple cider vinegar or any vinegar at all so just used 4tbs of lemon juice to make buttermilk and it was still great! It was moist and soft and didn't have that eggy flavor that some white cakes have sometimes.

Hi

I just need to ask a question because I want to start baking vegan cupcakes. The recipe calls for all purpose flour and white sugar.  These are things I usualy put into regular baking.  Should I be looking for a special type of all purpose flour or sugar? Organic maybe.  Thanks!

I have really enjoyed these cupcakes. I did a test batch as I am making them for a little boy who has milk and egg allergies. Even my husband liked the "Hippie Food" The taste was light and not oily like I though they would be with the coconut oil. I will be making them again. I'd say about 3 dozen so a little boy can have treats on him birthday.

I just took these cupcakes out of the oven!  They are beautiful and more like muffin tops which I love!  I made half of the recipe and replaced the sugar with Agave nectar(2/3 cup) , used Cake Flour instead of All Purpose Flour. Result = 6 servings Yummy!
