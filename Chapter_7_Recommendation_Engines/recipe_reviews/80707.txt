This turned out delicious. Everybody in my house likes mayo based slaw, except me, but when they tried this they all agreed that it was even better than their usual pick.

I am usually bad about leaving reviews, but I just made this, had a taste while it was still warm, and it was amazing! As a child, I would go to visit a friend of my mother's each summer, and her kids would make this. I have some BBQ ribs cooking right now and thought that this would go well with them. This is exactly as I remebered it to taste, and even my husband who is not a big cole slaw fan thought that this was really good! Thank You!

Very yummy!  I like healthy alternatives so I substituted 3/4 c. water and 1/4 c. oil, rather than 1 c. oil.  Next time I will add carrots, etc.  I will also use less liqid as it was a litle soupy.  Overall, very tasty!!

Fantastic! A perfect accompaniment to BBQ or roast turkey. I found a jar of this in the back of my refrigerator one time (forgotten for several weeks), and it was still fresh and delicious! PS Vernell was my grandmother's cook, too!

A delicious slaw, especially with a barbecue sandwich.***Update - The next time I made this, I used a 16 oz. pkg of coleslaw mix, halved the marinade ingredients, and used Splenda instead of sugar. It was still delicious!

Didn't have white vinegar but used 3/4 cup apple cider vin and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. Made as a slaw to put on pulled pork sandwiches but it was so good people were just eating the slaw with spoons. I finely shredded a large carrot which made it sweet but not too sweet. Will make again!

The best slaw I've ever had, but I still changed it slightly to suit myself. I use about half a cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup called for. I also substitute water for half of the oil. Perfect for me, I even eat it for breakfast, after having made it to go with pulled pork.

This was a nice basic slaw recipe.  It was a little sweet for me even though I cut down on the sugar because I don't like sweet stuff.  Hubby though does like sweet stuff and it just got a "yeah it was yummy from him"  I know that that does not mean 5 stars.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I like this slaw even if it's not the crisp, light slaw I'm more accustomed to. I should have interpreted the suggestion to "serve it with a slotted spoon" as a clue that there would be a lot of liquid. Still, the flavor was good!

Very good, although very little different from Amish Slaw.  I don't care for mayo-based slaws - that's why I was drawn to this recipe.  I didn't separate anything - I heated the ingredients in the list then combined with the cabbage all at once. I will add some grated carrot for colour.

This was good but a little oilier and sweeter than I like.

"Vernell's Slaw" is a wonderful slightly sweet coleslaw with a light hint of a celery taste. It is tasty, but not overpowering such as to compete with other flavorful dishes. It reminds me of those "full of love" type recipes that I can find in old church cookbooks. I substituted honey for sugar (equal amounts) in mine. Thank you HUNGRYHIPPO2 for sharing your recipe.

Easy to make and excellent, especially the next day.
