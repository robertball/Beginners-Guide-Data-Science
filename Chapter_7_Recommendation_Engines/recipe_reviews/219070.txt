These are wonderful!  If you love pecans and pralines, you will love these crunchy cookies.  They do taste like praline cookies.  They are sweet enough but not sweet like pralines.  They were very easy to make with ingredients already in my pantry.  No trip to the store necessary.  I don't bake very often, but these are worth baking.  I made the recipe as written except I used margarine instead of butter since that is what I had on hand.  I used a tablespoon to drop the dough on the cookie sheet, but these made much larger cookies than what I expected.  I set out to make 24 and it made about 18.  But they were delicious!  These would be awesome if they were dipped in chocolate!  Thanks for a great cookie recipe.

These crispy cookies have a subtly sweet and rich praline flavor. Easy to make and delicious!

Delicious cookies, I did roll in sugar before baking. I had to turn my oven to 350, 375 was too hot. They cook up real fast, need to check on them after 7 minutes. This will be a popular recipe for me to bake. Thank you for posting it. This isn't a real sweet cookie.

Loved it! I added extra pecans and put some bigger pecan pieces on top. The problem is I can't stop eating them.

I used a hand held mixer and the dough would not come together. I finally used my hands to mix the dough and that worked. The flavors are delicious but my cookies were not crunchy and did not brown even after baking for 14 minutes.

Yum yum!  These cookies remind me of blondies in cookie form.  I had to bake mine at 350 degrees since they started getting too dark at 375 degrees.  I used my tablespoon cookie scoop for the first tray and these came out very large and soft and chewy. The next tray I used my teaspoon cookie scoop and these came out crunchy as the name suggests.  These are delicious cookies I'm sure to make again.

I just made a batch of "Renee's Pecan Crunch Cookies". Let me say they are very good and very tasty. I will be making them again very soon.
