Very good recipe.  I omitted a tbsp. of brown sugar, water and ice, added a snack size container of vanilla pudding, and used 2 fozen bananas.  Excellent.

Used skim milk and left out the water; pretty tasty and refreshing. Simple to prepare. Also, added a little bit of cinnamon.

Quite good...debated 3 or 4 stars.  Nice and smooth and creamy, but a bit too watery for me.  Might substitute milk for the water or use a cube or two less ice.  Of course you could half this recipe.  Try using honey instead of brown sugar or adding a pinch of your favorite spice.  Also, check out the Banana Anna recipe on this site - both are great.

I made this for my 6 year old daughter. She really liked it. There was some left over so I gave it a taste even though I don't like bannanas. I am glad I did. This was one of the best smoothies I have ever tasted. The texture is perfect. Can't wait to make this for my husband. Thanks for sharing this with us.

Thanks so much! I had strep throat and without being able to eat anything for a few days I thought I was going to die! The only difference was I left the water out. Thanks so much, again!!

This is a great banana smoothie.  Other than adding extra banana for a stronger taste, the recipe is great as is.

This was pretty good, but I had to add an additional banana and 1t of vanilla for personal preference. Not too intense. Not too sweet. Thanks a bunch, Danielle.

This smoothie was absolutely delicious! One of the best ones I've tasted from allrecipes.com
I doubled the amount of ice cubes (my freezer pre-makes them so they're a tad small) so the drink was more to my kind of consistency--thick. Next time I'll probably add another banana to add a little more flavour, but all around I loved this smoothie! It doesn't require a range of fruits, just bananas, which is great because I don't have the money to buy berries all the time. :) I definitely recommend this recipe to any banana lovers.

I added 1/4 tsp. vanilla and realized after blending the banana and milk that my husband forgot to refill the ice trays so, needless to say, we were out of ice. It had a wonderful flavor, but was more like lumpy banana milk than a smoothie. Was delicious though. Will definately try it again, but with ice!! :)

I had 2 ripe bananas I needed to use up and found this recipe.  It was awesome.  I added a dash of vanilla extract but may try almond next time to switch it up.  If you add extract, you could probably decrease the sugar a bit.

Hubs and I really enjoyed this, although I didn't understand the need for the water - except as a springboard toward ideas for substitutes.  I think it would be kind of  flat if prepared as is, so I replaced the water with orange juice. We found the drink lightly sweet and refreshing  - I especially liked the addition of brown sugar rather than white. However, I'm really curious, now, to try replacing the water with Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur.  Or Godiva Chocolate Liqueur - -or Baileys, Chambord, Frangelico, or even banana liqueur!  The possibilities are endless and all sound delicious.

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the brown sugar in order to cut down on how much sugar was in the smoothie.  Be conservative with the ice or it may get too watery.  I added an extra banana and it has a real strong banana flavor, but it is DELICIOUS!  It is very healthy too, without any yogurt.  Just banana, milk, water, and ice!  Would have never thought that would come out so good.

mmmm....I always keep bananas in the freezer,Just stick 'em in when they get too ripe. Peel them when you are ready to use in a recipe. I left out the water like everyone else, but had to blend for a really long time, due to the frozen banana, could've put in a splash more skim milk, but didnt want to dilute the banana taste. Now I have an ice cream headache from drinking it.

Really good!Usually when I make smoothies.they end up tasting horrible.I didn't have high hopes for this one.When I made this,I was glad I did.It tasted like perfection!I didn't put the 2 tablespoons of water because,I was going to put in ice cubes anyways.The only problem is,it gave me a sour taste while drinking it.Probably because of the brown sugar.Anyways,BEST SMOOTHIE EVER!!!

Made as is (which is how I rate - instead of changing the entire recipe then rating the new recipe) it is exactly what it seems.  A perfectly adequate quick simple thin smoothie that kids will drink because it is cold and reminds them of a milk shake.  It is also a perfect BASE for an excellent smoothie.  Vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, yogurt, and other fruit all kick this up a notch. You and/or the kids can have fun experimenting and seeing what does what when added or removed.

This was ok, I used skim milk and omitted the water.  Next time I'll chill or freeze my bananas first, the room temp. banana made the smoothie kind of warm. Could've been a wee bit sweeter but that probably all depends on how ripe your bananas are.

This was an overall delicious smoothie. It was a little watery due to the amount of water listed in the recipe. Other than that, it had the perfect amount of sweetness. It was very simple to make and my family enjoyed the drink as well.

This was really good! 
I only used a banana and a half. Same amount of milk, water and ice, but I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and that made a difference.
I actually hate bananas, bit this was great!

It is a stretch to say this makes 4 servings. I used soy milk and doubled the banana; it had a good consistency and mild but tasty flavor.

Next time, I'll use less ice and less milk. The drink was very watered down, and there wasn't much flavour. Next, I will use some vanilla pudding and perhaps some nutmeg.

Just made and it was delicious!! I emitted water, added 6 ice cubes, and used 1%milk. I added a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. I only had 2 banannas on hand but probaly would of added a 3rd or maybe some yogurt to make a tad thicker. I topped my 7yr olds with whipped cream and he chugged his down. He said "why havent you made this for me before"!  It made 2 large glasses so i'd def double recipe if making for more than 2 people.

Very good smoothie.  At first I made it exactly to the recipe (except I halfed it), and it was very good.  However now I've modified it to 2 tablespoons honey instead of 1 tablespoon brown sugar , and omitted the water and one ice cube.  Now it's FABULOUS!!!

After I started to make this, I realized I had made similar recipes from on here before. I usually, just use a pack of Truvia, but decided to try the brown sugar to see if there was a difference. I honestly, thought the Truvia gave it a sweeter taste. I noticed at least one of the reviews saying this was watered down. So, I didn't add the water in the recipe. I have never heard of water in a smoothies like drink anyhow. Either way, it still turned out about the consistency of a slightly thick milk. It wasn't bad, just not one of my favorites.

I had a banana smoothie at a French bistro this passed weekend and it was sooo delish that I wanted to make it at home. The banana flavor was perfect, a subtle sweetness in it was great!! I stumbled upon this and wow it was right on the dot!! It made me two large glasses, my boyfriend loves it too =)

I ADDED SOME VANILLA AND CINNAMON BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE BLAND. MY SISTER SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH ICE CREAM BUT GAVE YOU4-1/2 STARS. OVERALL A VERY SIMPLE COOL BREAKFAST DRINK. ENJOYABLE!

I made this leaving out the water.  Instead, I added a touch of vanilla and plain yogurt.  Cut the ice to 6 cubes and garnished with a Hershey's kiss on top.  Read good!  I may pop some frozen blueberries into a future batch.

The water isn't really needed. I did add a little nutmeg. Tasted like banana bread. We drank one batch down and instantly made another.

This was really good with a few changes. Used 1 banana, eliminated the water and ice cubes (my banana was frozen), added 1 teaspoon vanilla and a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg in addition to the brown sugar and milk. Tasted like a milkshake minus the ice cream!

Good!  Great way to use up bananas that are starting to brown that the kids won't eat.  While I love baked banana goods, I wanted something fast and easy as I cannot always bake and would prefer to avoid too many baked goods.  This is fast and low-fat and the kids like it.

I wish they would repost this recipe without the water.  Usually the goal is to have a thicker drink, not water it down.  We added 1/4 cup of blueberries, 2 TBSP flax seed and a scoop of protein.  Yum!

Fantastic!  Can maybe add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to thicken it up a little.  Yummy as is!  A pinch of cinammon is an idea as well.

This is great. If you rub lemon on the bananas and put in the freezer you don't need ice and it is very thick. I also added a little vanilla.

This was pretty good. I did find some of the other reveiws helpful so I did change a few things. I did not add the water and also added some vanilla. Also added a few more ice cubes. I think next time I will use soy milk. Thanks for the recipe!!!

While I was adding the last 3 indgredients, I also added a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I am going to reduce the 1/4 tsp of cinnamon next time to just a pinch because it was a bit overpowering.  I am wondering if honey would be good instead of cinnamonn and might try that next time.  I didn't use the full 1/4 cup of water either, since I used skim milk.  I used about an 1/8 cup instead.

This recipe has a very mellow, smooth taste, the banana is just right, not too strong or too weak. It is also very refreshing.

Don't cry over spilled milk.  I mushed the bananas in the milk using an immersion blender and it fell over. I threw all the banana back in and guessed at how  much milk I lost and added that back in. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 as much like another reviewer suggested. Not sure if I had the right combo, but it was delish! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is a good base for banana smoothies. I used the following:

2 bananas (overripe; don't use it)
1 cup of low-fat milk
1 tbsp of honey (orange flavor)
6 cubes of ice

Don't use overripe bananas because they add a hint of sourness to the smoothie. To make it sweeter, use 2 tablespoons of honey.

This recipe was very good but there was a little bit too much brown sugar for my liking, but I added only 1tbs and it was perfect. I am totally going to make this again.

Delicious! I substituted the brown sugar for white sugar (simply because of personal taste), left out the water, and did 4 cubes of ice instead of 8. Simple, delicious, and I will make again!

I couldn't decide between 3 and 4 stars. This smoothie was okay, but nothing special. I made a 1/2 recipe and it made two small servings. If I wanted a large glass, this would not have been enough. I didn't like how the brown sugar overpowered the smoothie. I didn't really taste the banana at first. However, after letting the smoothie sit in the refrigerator for a few minutes, the flavor grew on me. I tasted less brown sugar and enjoyed the texture more without all the bubbles on top. Overall, decent smoothie. Nothing I would recommend, though.

This was "ok" for flavor - definitely easy to throw together, but it was sort of boring in the taste department. The brown sugar did give it a little something "different" but it was that and a watered down banana taste. I would try this again but would replace the water with pineapple or orange juice for some more flavor! :)

The kids really liked this one. I did add a little vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I needed some extra milk and water as my bananas were frozen and large. The mix was creamy and delicious.

Great recipe, which is extremely quick and easy. It's also fairly filling too, so if you're in a hurry in the morning, just make one of these shakes and you're good to go. Delicious!

I made a slightly different smoothie, but I would still give Danielle credit because her recipe inspired me.  I used one frozen banana, 4 frozen strawberries, 1/2 cup milk, and a tablespoon of brown sugar.  It was very delicious, and next time I will try it without the added sugar.  YUM!

This was OK. I didn't think it was sweet enough and it was really really banana flavored. My boyfriend really liked it though.
