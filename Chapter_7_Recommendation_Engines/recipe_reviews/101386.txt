this was really good! I cooked using the panbroil method, and the only thing I did was add a combination butter and olive oil to the pan. I cooked on high heat about a minute on each side then reduced heat to low for about 5 minutes on each side. I forgot to wrap the bacon around it, but the butter was really tasty!!!

I made these for dinner tonight my whole family enjoyed this.  I did mine under the broiler and my bacon turned out perfect.  I seasoned the pork chops with Kosher salt, pepper, a little adobo seasoning and with Grill Mates Montreal Steak.  To the butter topping I added some chopped fresh parsley.  I served this delightful pork chop with risotto and steamed vegetables.

I broiled these last night. With the bacon being so close to the heat source, I noticed that it was sparking flames in my oven! I just took them out (they were almost all the way done) and pan broiled them. I used another commenter's idea and held the chops on the sides to crisp up the bacon. They were DELICIOUS and very juicy!!!

I used applewood bacon (thick sliced) and it added a lot of flavor to the pork chops.  I pan grilled them and found that high heat was good for searing but preferred to cook on med-low to low.  The garlic mustard butter was so good that I've kept some just for general use.

Yu-um! This would have been.... okay, without the butter. My husband loves garlic and I'm not so big on it. So I made the butter like it calls for, so he could have it, and just mixed it without garlic for me. The bacon didn't brown for me in the oven and I can't stand my bacon that way, so I just stuck them up on their sides in a skillet and turned them as needed until the bacon was as done as I wanted it!

Absolutely love this recipe! My 18 month old gobbled this down and my husband went back for seconds. The mustard-butter was the perfect touch that put it all together.

Meh, it was alright... I didn't get the bacon cooked well enough, so my experience wasn't the greatest. I probably won't make this again.

I tenderized the pork for 24 hours in equal parts of sugar and salt. Other than that, followed the recipe and it turned out splendidly. It took a bit longer in my gas oven to broil it... since I couldn't quite get the appropriate height setting without getting too close to the flames. We paired it with Kabocha squash and a bit of maple syrup. Our salad was chopped spinach, with a bit of onion, cucumber and avocado - topped with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The whole thing was splendid.
