I love the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, so I was eager to try this!  Unfortunately, I didn't really think it was the same.  I would recommend making a pumpkin syrup if you need the pumpkin, but I tried it with pumpkin pie spices and a little vanilla and it turned out very well.

very good, I liked it even better than Starbucks.  Instead of sugar and vanilla I used one ounce of Starbucks' vanilla syrup.

I went ahead and tried it despite the bad reviews and liked it! I added more milk and sugar (I like coffee more milk and sugar anyway!) And made a bunch in a crock pot for a party! Oh, and just be sure to cook the pumpkin mix until frothy.

I tried this recipie this morning. I used regular coffee instead of espresso since thats what we had. I Like it alot. It does remind me a bit of chai tea, but it was very good. I'll definately make this again.

I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the pumpkin. I felt a little weird using actual pumpkin in a coffee drink, unless it's blended. It's tasty, but not something I'd drink everyday. TIP: This makes a nice night cocktail with pumpkin liquor. I've had it a couple of times now and really enjoy it.

I have never tried a pumpkin spice latte at a coffee shop, but i've been hearing alot about them latley. So I decided to make my own at home. I used just 1 tablespoon of sugar and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Instead heating the milk mixture over the stove I just wisked everything together in a mug and microwaved it for about 2 minutes. After the milk mixture was nice and hot I topped off the mug with some strong brewed drip coffee instead of espresso. I wasn't so sure about putting canned pumpkin in a latte, but it actually was very very good. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I loved the recipe.  I did not make it exactly as written, I made my pumpkin puree without the milk and cooked it to marry the flavors, then made my espresso, added to the pumpkin puree and then added frothed/steamed milk.  I like the frothed milk better, just my preference.  This was a great recipe and it tasted very close to the commercial holiday lattes.

This latte has great flavor, but I didn't like the texture of the pumpkin so I tried using sweet potato baby food (they don't make pumpkin) and it turned out great! No little lumps! I also substituted 2 packets stevia for the sugar and it was yummy too.

I made this recipe almost exactly. The only difference is I don't brew espresso at home. I made a strong instant coffee and used that. This was delicious! I did double the recipe. I may use just a tad less sugar next time or substitute Splenda, but I will definitely be making this again and again.

I tried this recipe not really knowing what to expect.  The pumpkin flavor was not very distinct and all of the pumpkin sank to the bottom of my glass.  It almost tasted like a chai latte.  I probably will not try this again.

This is pretty good, i did use pumpkin pie spice instead of pureed pumpkin, that is what the submitter suggested if u dont wanna use the puree. I just added it to the milk with sugar and heated, then removed from heat and added a bit of vanilla.  I then topped the espresso with it.  Really good

Simply perfect and delicious latte.  I substituted about half the milk with almond milk and only had organic pumpkin pie filling on hand and it turned out wonderfully.  I used an immersion wand for the pumpkin mixture and topped with a touch of cinnamon for presentation.  Will be keeping this recipe for future use.

This was absolutely delicious! Perfect for a nippy fall morning, bringing the familiar tastes of the season to the invigorating energy of coffee.  Not having a means to make espresso, I just substituted that for 1/4 cup of water with 1tsp instant coffee, and I feel it turned out fine.  I also tried this as a coffee-free drink, using 1/4 cup water and 3 tbsp of hot cocoa mixture. It was yummy and my family loves it! This is definitely being made again in my kitchen!

Great taste and great for the holidays. I used vanilla almond breeze instead of milk so it didn't froth as much, but it was still very delicious

I liked it. I only used 1 tablespoon sugar. I don't like a real sweet coffee. It's like you're drinking a hot cup of autumn.

I heated all the ingredients except the espresso, doubling the pumpkin puree and adding Splenda. Once heated, I frothed the mixture with an immersion blender, poured into a mug and placed in Ninja Coffee Bar, Cup size, Specialty brew. This is a good starter recipe.

As much as I wanted to love this, I couldn't give it 5 stars.  I think it's a great start though!  I combined the milk, pumpkin, sugar and vanilla in a large jar and shook it for about a minute to make it frothy.  I then placed the uncovered jar in the microwave for about a minute to heat the mix (beware, the foam will quickly expand in volume!).  Since I don't have an espresso machine, I brewed some very strong coffee, and added it to the heated milk/pumpkin mix.  I then garnished with a little whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.  It was decent, but lacked something as it wasn't very rich.  Maybe this would be better if you use cream or something a bit richer.  I also think it could use more pumpkin!  :)

If you can remember to stir this while drinking it is an "o.k." latte. But if you don't and you get the sludge that sinks to the bottom, it will ruin it for you.

Way too spicy.  I might try it again with less spice and perhaps add sweetened condensed milk.

I have found using canned pumpkin in any drinks makes for bad results. Pop in to your local BevMo or other shop that will have torani pumpkin spice syrup, or any other brand pumpkin spice syrup, heck get other flavors too... its way better than this, and way better than the starbucks PSL.

I made exactly as directed and found it to be good.  Just don't expect it to be Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, cause it's different.

Very nice and easy to make. A lot better than paying $5 for a cup, I'd rather sit at home, enjoy it and save the money!

Yum, tried this out today since I had just baked a pumpkin cheesecake pie for a party and had some pumpkin puree left over. My husband and I love this!

i like the flavors.....but it is way too sweet....i would recommend only using half the amount of sugar or the amount you would put in your regular coffee.

I've attempted to recreate one these on my own before, and I'd like to say Thank You for helping me to finally get it right!! This was delicious! What a lovely way to kick off the Fall season. With 2 tbsp of sugar it's VERY sweet, but that's fine by me!!  This one is a keeper!

Though this may not taste like Starbucks, I thought it was great.  It was sweet enough, but I may play around with adding more spices.  Before heating on the stove, I blended in a Magic Bullet blender and it was very frothy.

Loved this! I changed it up a bit though.  I used a little more pumpkin spice, and did not use the pumpkin. Used regular coffee from the morning and sugar substitue.  It was delish!

Just made it and this is a terrific recipe.  I put all the non-coffee ingredients into a Pyrex measuring cup and microwaved it on high for 2 minutes.  I then brewed a Nespresso Ristretto pod into a travel mug and added the hot pumpkin mix.  I will be saving a TON of money now that I have a way to make a delicious Pumpkin Spice Latte at home.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! As good as Starbucks, for sure, and a lot cheaper with a little effort. I followed the recipe as listed, though I multiplied it, refrigerating the latte part for use with my coffee throughout the week. I had a mug fresh from the saucepan yesterday, and a reheated one this morning from the fridge portion. Both were delicious! 

Some reviews said the pumpkin puree didn't blend in enough; I took those reviews to heart (who wants chunks of pumpkin floating around in their coffee?) and got out the electric hand mixer. While the pan was on the stove cooking, I beat the latte for a few minutes until it frothed, and then just stirred the rest of the time. Turned out really well, and no pumpkin floaties. Topped it with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon. Delicious!

This was a nice drink. I thought it was a bit thick and too sweet for me. You have to drink it quickly or you end up with lots of spice and pumpkin puree at the bottom of your cup.

I really liked this.  It turned out quite well, although I just used strong brewed coffee.  Because I won't be using espresso, I will decrease the sugar a bit next time as it is a  sweeter than I expected.

I just made this. It turned out great, my whole family loved it. I followed the recipe, except using just brewed coffee and a little less sugar. I blended the ingredients in a blender instead of in a pan on the stove, which worked really well and created a nice froth. I will be making this again.

I did like this when I started to drink and it was very similar to the Starbucks brand although when I got the the bottom of the cup it was all goey. I am going to try this recipe again but I will exclude the purée and maybe add a pumpkin syrup. Overall it wasn't too bad.

you really have to make it with the pumpkin puree, it turns out great! I didn't have espresso but I used cinnamon coffee made in my keurig with great results. I also didn't use sugar, but in my opinion you really don't need it. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is so simple and so delicious!  I used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 cup and that helped with maintaining the pumpkin flavor. It wasn't gritty and very smooth! Thanks for this recipe.

Finally-a great homemade pumpkin spiced latte recipe that I could make healthier and it's still delicious. I did use 4 oz. espresso because I wanted it to still taste like a coffee drink. For the "fewer calories" part I used 1.5 T. Splenda instead of the 2 T. sugar and skim milk.

This was pretty good...I doubled the recipe and added 2 packets Truvia instead of the sugar. I also put a small amount of heavy cream in mine b/c I like it a little richer. Other than that, it was tasty.

to the coffee drinking world:  I do not like the taste of coffee.  I make these drinks with hot chocolate.   I just made a tasty hot drink with milk, unsweetened cocoa powder, dash of pure vanilla, sugar to taste and Hiram Walker Pumpkin Spice liquour.

I made this for a Halloween Brunch and it was a BIG hit! I bought the espresso from Starbucks since i don't have a espresso maker (and i wanted to be sure it tasted good), i also ran the milk through the blender just before pouring over the espresso to make it extra frothy. This recipe is even better than Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte! Everyone wanted the recipe! Watch the milk closely, i made the mistake for turning away for a minute and it boiled over onto my stove.

Fantastic!  I actually added half the sugar and it was almost perfect.  I think I might decrease the sugar just a little more next time.  I'm not a huge fan of really sugary coffee.  But, it tasted really great!

I thought this was quite yummy. I don't have espresso but I do have just the run-of-the-mill store coffee but regardless this was great! I could have made it more frothy I think. Thank you for the great recipe! I can't wait to share it with the holiday guests!

The overall taste of this is RIGHT ON with the coffee shop flavor but the grit from the pumpkin pie spice isn't pleasant so I can only give this a 3 star rating.  I bet this would be really good with the Pumpkin Pie flavored syrup!

DELICIOUS!!! I may just try it without the sugar because warmed milk in lattes tends to be sweet enough for me. Will see how it compares to this yummy recipe ;)
