I was disappointed with this. The cod totally dominates the other flavors. The enoki mushrooms and leek may as well not have been there, and there was only a hint of saltiness from the bacon. The chili paste was way too hot too (but that may well have just been the brand I used). If I were to make this again, I would use a milder-tasting fish like tilapia, use chestnut mushrooms and onion. This is worth playing around with, imo.

My family and I thought that this was wonderful!!  Used a little less Chili Sauce and it gave just enough kick without being to spicy.  :)

Yummy dish. Instead of doing individual stuffed pieces we made one big roll and then grilled it and sliced it. This was much faster.

I made this a while ago but as I did not have any leek or mushroom, I only made the cod wrapped in bacon. Still taste good to me! :)    Thanks for sharing this simple recipe.

This was great! I love enoki mushrooms and never see them used. I agree with the review that the cod dominates, so next time I will use something thinner like sole and adjust the filling amounts. Also, I lightly sauteed the enoki and leek before stuffing them and it greatly enhanced the flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

Made for a special dinner for my husband...I personally wasn't sure if it would turn out but my husband, brother in law and myself thought it was very tasty. I grilled for far longer as my bacon was not cooking in the alotted time

I admit I didn't have some of the ingredients, but this was good anyway. I used fresh cod my husband had just caught spear fishing while scuba diving. I didn't have the mushrooms or chili sauce on hand. I partially pre- fried the bacon because it was thick cut applewood bacon, and I didn't want to overcook the fish trying to get the bacon done. Used two slices bacon for each roll, because they were shorter than regular bacon. Plenty of saltiness and flavor, maybe the difference is the bacon used. All the family liked it, and I thought it was much better than the mayo/sour cream/parmesan cheese cod that my husband loves ( and I am tired of eating). Finally a cod recipe that's easy and yummy!

WoW!  Using 4 fillets - instead of chili sauce I used 1 tbsp Asian Chile paste rubbed on both sides.  Because the paste is thick some will fall off but what stays on is plenty to add some flavour and spice. I stuffed the fillets with Enoki and aged white cheddar and wrapped with turkey bacon.  After cooking the fish, I simmered the juices down, add grated parmesan to thicken....!  Fantastic!  This is definitely a keeper recipe!
