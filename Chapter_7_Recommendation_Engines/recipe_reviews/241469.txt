Asparagus just screams spring to me!  My spears were thin so I put 3 spears per bundle and cut them a bit longer than the 3 inches recommended.  If you don't care for goat cheese use Boursin or cream cheese with chives. The chives in the market were pretty short so I use the tender thin green onion sprouts.  Delicious and very pretty!
