The marinade is basic at best, and I recommend using one w/ some soy, and ginger added to the basic EVOO Lemon mixture.  Now the dill sauce is simply amazing.  4 stars for the sauce alone.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have white wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar.  Also, I only had 1 tbsp dill.  Overall, I thought the recipe was a 4-4.5.  My husband didn't like it quite as much and gave it a 3.5-4.  I would make it again.  I had frozen tuna steaks, so I made them medium well.  If I had fresh tuna steaks, I would have done medium rare, which would have improved the overall taste in my opinion.

Made this for dinner tonight and the entire family loved it.  Had to make one substitution, stone ground mustard for the spicy brown mustard.  The marinade is enough for more than 2 tuna steaks, I had about 8, and it turned out fine.  I will definitely make this again!

Skipped the mustard powder and used apple cider vinegar in place of white wine vinegar.  Outstanding!  This was the best sauce I have ever had on fish!  In fact, this was the best fish meal I've ever made!  The boyfriend was thrilled and ate it all and all the leftovers the next day.  The sauce was great on the potatoes and couscous we ate with the tuna as well.  Broiled my tuna for 6 minutes on each side, and it was still pink in the middle but o-so-tasty!  Again and again, I will crave and cook this!

This recipe was so unexpectedly great. I chose this one over others based on the reviews and I was not let down. I broiled the tuna, since I do not have access to a grill, and would suggest reducing cooking time. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I paired the tuna with boiled baby red potatoes and green beans, the dill sauce was a perfect compliment. I am using the left over sauce on a salmon fillet tomorrow evening. I have added this recipe to my stand by cookbook so that I can reference it at a moments notice. Thanks for the great new staple!

This was a superb recipe!  I did not have white wine vinegar so used red wine vinegar instead and in place of the white sugar I used an equal amount of Splenda.  My husband took one bite and said "wow".  Will definitely use again and will also try it on other types of fish.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Nice flavor variation when your favorite tuna recipe is getting stale.  I substituted lime for lemon juice - not sure it matters.  Next time I make this, I will leave out the sugar - really not needed.

The dill sauce was delicious.  I only put in one Tb sugar since we try to avoid it.  I'd recommend cooking the tuna so it's still got some color inside, so not to dry it out.

This was an interesting sauce, and I liked it alot for something different.  I scaled down to 2 servings and it still made more than double what I actually needed.

Jeez Louise, you must love yourself some dill, "Splashme", haha.  I only used 2 tablespoons and still it was too much for me.  (There were no complaints from anyone else at the dinner table tonight.)   I agree that it will definitely taste better after some time but I don't see the dill ever becoming tolerable {for me}.  My tuna steaks, however, were awesome.  I just simply used another sauce for my portion.

Excellent recipe! I made it tonight for dinner and my husband and I loved it. I was afraid that the sauce was going to be too sweet with all the sugar in it, but it was perfect. Will be making this again!

The sauce was great (with my substitutes) and I loved the slight lemony flavor the marinade added! I subbed Splenda for the sugar.

Made this tonight for dinner and substituted blue marlin steaks for the tuna and yellow mustard for the brown mustard.  My husband and I liked the overall flavor of everything, but we felt the dill was much too intense and it overpowered the fish.  When I make this again, I think I will use only 1 tbs of dried dill.

I actually only used the sauce on tuna I made using the ginger citrus recipe tuna steaks recipe from allrecipes.  The sauce was amazing!  I agree with the rater who said it's even better the next day.

Sorry.  It didn't do anything for me.  I cut down the sugar in the sauce and it still was too sweet for me.    All the ingredients seemed good; just didn't happen.  And, yeah.  Way too much sauce for two servings.

I doubled the recipe, but found that doubling the sauce made on direction #3 does not need to be doubled, (I did double it) but would have been plenty  without doubling.
Everything turned out perfect.  I do not have a grill, so I used my oven and finished up with 5 min under the broiler.   I nailed it!  
                        ABSOLUTE PERFECTION!!!!

I followed the recipe as is.  Quick, simple and tasty.  The brown mustard, dill sauce has a sweet and tangy taste.  Recipe has been added to my favorites.

Marinade is simple and doesn't "flavor" the Tuna like some marinades can.  The sauce is outstanding!   Only two substitutions:  I use red wine vinegar and I leave out the mustard powder.  I season and sear the tuna filets, then serve them with the sauce drizzled over them and also some on the side.

This will be five stars the next time I make it.  The dill sauce is too sweet.  I'll use half - maybe one third the amount of sugar. Like others, I added a little soy sauce and garlic to the marinade.

Do ourselves a favor... Reduce the sugar for 2 tuna steaks to 1 tbs. Too sweet. The mustard, dill and the substitution of apple cider vinegar were perfect

I'm not a mustard fan, so I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor.  Will definitely be making this again (and again, and again...)

The fish was yummy. I substituted stone ground mustard because my daughter doesn't eat spicy food. The sauce was a HUGE hit!!  We will have this again!!

Real good and real easy too! The only thing I added was some fresh  basil to go along with the dill. This sauce is also excellent on shrimp n pasta or just about any kind of seafood.

Made the recipe exactly as it's written... But only seared the tuna so it was extremely rare. Sauce was fantastic... Would love to use on other meats. Marinade did the job... Sauce was the star of the meal.

We really liked these, but I think I'd reduce the sugar to 1 TBLS if I made these again, as it was a bit sweet for our taste.   I really enjoyed the dill/mustard, but the sugar was a bit much.  THANKS for the recipe, SPLASHME!

This is a great recipe for tuna steaks. Takes the bottom line on this recipe, nothing else to it. We enjoy this one every time

Loved this recipe. It was very simple and light. The sauce also makes a good salad dressing. We made this with a Quinoa Side Dish. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quinoa-side-dish/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=quinoa&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page

I cubed the tuna steaks, pan cooked them and served them over salad greens and cherry tomatoes with the dill sauce (as an appetizer for a dinner party). It was delicious and made a beautiful presentation! The dill sauce was more than enough for 6-8 servings!
