Yum! My only change is I used a little bit of ranch seasoning in place of Greek. The flavors are super subtle, creamy and delicious. I'd never had rockfish before. We made a second batch of rice because we didn't want the sauce to go to waste.

I didn't cut my potatoes or oranges small enough. Broiling dried out the oranges. Not sure how to improve the flavors, but it might make a decent stew.

The fish was amazing. The orange flavor of the sauce was exquisite.
I didn't serve it with rice, but I wish I had the sauce was so good.

It was OK. I thought the sauce would have more flavor.

My wife and I enjoyed this very much. I wasn't sure if 300 degrees would be enough, so I turned the heat up to 350 or so for the last ten minutes and I kept an eye on it while broiling so I could push the orange pieces down to prevent buring. I will certainly make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
