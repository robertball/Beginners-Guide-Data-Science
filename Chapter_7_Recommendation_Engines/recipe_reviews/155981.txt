I halfed this recipe and served it at a Christmas party with friends.  The ricotta made a very nice texture, with good flavor, but we did not care too much for the candied cherries.  I think it would be just fine without them.

This pie was nice for something different to make for the holidays. I followed the directions as they were except I omitted the candied cherries.  It came out really well, my family really liked it.  The lemon flavor was really a nice touch because without it the pie wouldn't have had much flavor.
