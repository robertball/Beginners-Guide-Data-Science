I made these today for my daughter's swim team Christmas party. The cake mix that I had was 16.5 oz, and it worked out just fine with no other adjustments. I was surprised at how these puffed up with using the cherry CokeÂ®! I wasn't quite sure how I was going to cut the well out of the cupcakes, but in my drawer, I found this little citrus thingy, that you are supposed to screw into a lemon or lime, and when you squeeze the lemon or lime, there's a little spout that the juice comes out of. That thing worked GREAT for pulling a "plug" of cake out of these! I filled each with 3 cherries and a bit of the cherry pie filling. I did add a bit more powdered sugar to the cream, probably 1/8 cup more - as I really wanted the whipped topping to hold up when I piped it. I did pipe it onto the cupcakes using a pastry bag fitted with a 1M tip. I added a sprinkle of grated chocolate, just to dress them up a bit. They turned out very pretty! Reminded me of a black forest cake cupcake.

These are very moist, as most cola-cake mix cakes are. Neither the cola nor the cherry flavor are very strong so this really becomes a recipe you make to save on time or ingredients, but not really for "cherry coke" flavor. I made it a couple of times. Devils Food chocolate seems to pair the best. And I added the juice from the jar of cherries to punch up the flavor some, but even then it wasn't strong. These are cute, novel, and easy and they do taste yummy, but really just as a moist, plain chocolate cake.

I have made these cupcakes about two years ago, and boy let me tell you, they were so delicious. I was amazed that no eggs were used and they came out so moist. I want to convert this into a cake this time.

Very good. Honestly, you kinda need a spoon to eat them....they are VERY fluffy/soft but also oh so good! Made them three times now and notice I do better using the cake mix without added pudding in mix. Kids love em!

They where so good! I put some cherry flavoring in the frosting. I also had some leftover batter, so I made a little cake.

I peeled off the cupcake wrapper and it fell apart. It was all mush with the cherry filling their were too many cherries. I didn't enjoy this recipe.
