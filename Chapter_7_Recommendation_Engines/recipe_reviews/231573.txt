I used Johnsonville ground Italian sausage what a nice change of pace. Mom can't take spices so I used beans with bell pepper even still the flavor was awesome and something I want to do again.

We liked this one. Made with turkey and regular chili beans (couldn't find the hot ones). I thought thus might be too dry but it wasn't. We served it with raw onion and tomato and shredded lettuce. Along with sour cream and salsa.

I used Taco Seasoning I recipe instead of prepacked seasoning and cooked dry red beans instead of chili beans. I also added some chopped sweet peppers (I'm always looking to add veggies to my family's diet). This was a great weekday treat meal and easy enough to let the kids get involved. My whole family loved it. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! I made this using half regular nacho chips and half spicy Doritos.  (didn't have enough  Doritos).  I cut the amount of the recipe in half and had enough to share with my mom too with leftovers. She also liked it.

The Taco Casserole was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I've made a couple of substitutions. I used burrito seasonings instead of taco seasonings, and used black beans instead of hot chili beans. Also, I added some chopped tomatoes for more flavor. It was so good  my sister and I came back for seconds!! :-)

A nice new flavor, we really enjoyed it at my house! Didn't change a thing, although I may try this again using shredded chicken in place of beef just to see how that works out, but really doesn't need any changes at all!

So sorry, really wanted to love it. Followed the recipe to a "t." It was quite dry and lacked that flavor that makes you want to keep coming back for more.

My son would not touch it due to the beans, but he's 3.  My opinion was that it was a bit dry.  I think adding a can of rotelo or even a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilies would have added a little extra moisture and that something that was missing.  I will try again with adding those items, but it was a good base recipe.

Very good recipe.  Added lots of cheese to this.  Next time I'll try some corn & black beans.
