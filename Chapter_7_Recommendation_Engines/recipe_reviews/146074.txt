Sliced tomatoes with herbs and olive oil is a staple in my house.  But for some reason, this was particularly delicious. Maybe it's the COMBINATION of herbs which makes it so special.  Or maybe it's the minced garlic or Parmesan cheese, which I don't generally use. Just don't refrigerate this, which is always a no-no with fresh tomatoes.

I made one big change that made this delicious, even though I had to use some bottled spices because I didn't have fresh on hand. I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar, oh my god good. This even smelled awesome while I made it, and because of timing it didn't get to sit for long either. The red wine vinegar was even better than balsamic, which I didn't think was possible. If I make this recipe again with fresh ingredients and enough time to marinate, this recipe is 10 stars! I will make this again for sure!

If you love fresh ripe tomatoes, you'll love this! I don't know what could possibly make this any better other than maybe some red wine or balsamic vinegar - but try the recipe as written first and you'll understand why people spend hours planting fresh tomatoes and herbs in their gardens!

Made this as a side last night with our wonderful fresh NJ tomatoes. Oh so good. But PLEASE don't refrigerate the tomatoes; the chill just kills the taste. When you're done, use some nice crusty bread to sop up all the wonderful juice. Thanks!

I've made this 3 times in the last 4 days (I omit the parsley as I don't like it). It is SOOOOO good! Awesome made as written, but even better with a dash of white balsamic vinegar and slices of mozzerella. Thanks so much!

This is so much better without the garlic. The flavor of it completely overpowered that of the tomatoes. The tomatoes are, or should be, the star in this recipe and should be allowed to  shine, with the other ingredients as supporting actors. They should point up and celebrate the fresh, delicate flavor of burstingly, achingly ripe tomatoes. As written, we found the garlic to be  a "spotlight ho." Perhaps sauteeing the garlic lightly in a bit of olive oil until just starting to color before adding would help this problem, but I found that when I made the dish without any garlic whatsoever, it was just about as close to perfection as it gets. And I'm a garlic lover, so that says a lot!

YUM! I used two bags of Romanita tomatoes and only used a dribble of EVOO because our main dish was a little fatty, I didn't want overkill. I didn't have fresh spices so I used a quarter teaspoon of each, except the fresh garlic. My littlest didn't care for it (he dosen't like much of anything, he's four) but the rest of us loved it. I think next time, I might add a little balsamic vinegar.

I made this for a BBQ this weekend, it was a big hit. Everyone loved it!  I read most of the reviews, and disagree with some of them.  One said the amount of garlic was too much, I think it was spot on. Also, one review said it was a no-no to refrigerate fresh tomatoes. Ish, I can say that biting into a room temp. tomato is not that appealing to me. I think that cold fresh tomatoes are much better!  Next time I am going to sub. the parmesan with sliced fresh mozzarella! Thank you for a great recipe:-)

A Truly excellent recipe, you don't even need that much oil, the juices from the tomatoes give it all the wetness it needs.

Easy and tasty, and a good use for bountiful summer tomatoes!  Flexible, too - can vary the herbs to taste.  I took a shortcut and sprinkled everything on top of the tomatoes, but I think I should have followed the directions and mixed the oil and herbs into a dressing.  I also agree with the reviewer who recommended leaving the dish out of the fridge until served - not only does the cold change the tomatoes, but the olive oil congeals.

I mixed red tomato wedges and yellow grape tomato halves for this delicious salad.  I'd recommend adding salt when you're ready to serve because the parm is pretty salty - taste and then add salt as needed.  This would be good without parm too.  Due to what I had on-hand I used a combination of fresh and dried herbs.

It is a good recipe but I definitely agree that you need some red wine vinegar.  I ate it right away but think it would have been better had it marinated for a bit.  Watch out for the garlic since it's fresh, it packs quite a bite!

I did not add the garlic because I thought it would have been too overpowering.  I did add sliced red onion, and fresh chopped basil instead of the other herbs, sprinkled it with little olive oil and balsamic vinegar, then topped with capers and blue cheese crumbles.

I cannot believe that no one said anything about refrigerating this dish.  Fresh tomatoes should never be refrigerated!  They lose all their flavor that way.  I made this twice.  Once I followed the exact instructions and everyone said it was tasteless.  Next, I made it the same way but did not refrigerate it and everyone loved it!

What's not to like about fresh sliced tomatoes covered in herbs just snipped from the plant? Delicious. Don't refrigerate before serving though, or you will kill all the flavor. Just let sit at room temp an hour before serving, instead.

Turned out wonderful even though I used all dried herbs.  I thought I would need to add some balsamic vinegar, but it wasn't needed.  I didn't refrigerate mine, but left them at room temperature.

Definitely use fresh or cut back on the spices.  I only had dry, so I halved them, but the oregano was strong, so I would use maybe 1 teaspoon of each spice next time if I use dry again.  These aren't too bad; bf liked them better than I did, but he likes tomatoes with dressing.  I need a bit more with tomatoes--like bread or mozzarella slices.  All in all, though, easy and good.  Something bf makes on his own (with Italian dressing) so we'll probably make again.  Thanks.

Excellent - light and refreshing.  I used fresh thyme and chives, and dried oregano and parsley, reducing the latter two appropriately.

This is fabulous.  You MUST use fresh herbs and not the dried stuff.  I also purchased fresh mozzarella balls from my local Italian grocery store....sliced the cheese and added to this salad.  Other than that, I followed the recipe "as is".  My guests loved it and could not get enough of it.
Very Yummmmmmy!!!!!!!!!!

Made as written (except did not chill to marinate) and love the combination of these flavors but next time will add a bit of red wine vinegar and use roasted garlic simply because I love their flavors :-) For those who are raw garlic shy/think it is too overpowering I plead with you to try roasted garlic with this recipe - YUM! Also, regarding chilling the tomatoes, please know you can safely marinate them, covered, at room temperature for up to four hours and then chill any leftovers for use in a salad the next day.

This is a great way to enjoy tomatoes, and an easy side dish. It can be made with dried herbs as well (use 2 teaspoons each instead of 2 tablespoons) if you're short on fresh herbs. Sometimes I like to add red wine vinegar to taste to change it up a bit. Love it! Thank you!

Depending on how many people I am serving and how many fresh tomatoes I have, I sometimes add other veggies. Most frequently I add sliced cucumber and red onion. If there are leftovers, I refirgerate it and save it for the next day to top a lettuce salad. I look forward to this side dish every summer. Yummy and healthy.

One of our local markets had really nice looking on the vine tomatoes on special this week.  Now to get a decent tomato in Ohio is next to impossible this time of year - we usually don't get good tomatoes until July!  So I bought some and made this recipe.  I had fresh thyme, oregano and chives growing in the garden and fresh parsley from the market.  I sliced and arranged the tomatoes on a serving dish and spooned the dressing over.  I covered and left it at room temperature for a few hours before dinner.  Remember, refrigerating tomatoes is a no-no - they lose some of their flavor.   Well, let me tell you, this was DELICIOUS!!!  GOOD tomatoes and FRESH herbs are key to this recipe.  I'll be making this a lot this summer.  THANK YOU!!!   THANK YOU!!!

Good but I have to agree with a lot of the others. I think it could have used some red wine vinegar. I will add next time. Thanks for the recipe. It was a great way to get some use out of my herb garden.

Quick, easy and delicious! I did add some red wine vinegar to the dressing. If you like fresh herbs, then this is the recipe for you! Yum!

Just made this for supper, and it was fantastic. Followed the directions exactly as written, and it was terrific.  Everyone at the table agreed that a bit of lemon juice, or lemon zest in this would give it a great zing. Otherwise, perhaps a raspberry vinegar or something similar would be a great addition.   Very Tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this a few weeks ago and I just thought it was great. Last night I tried it out on my husband and his friend and I thought they would never stop raving about them! Simple recipes like this make a cook like me look like a genius. My husband kept saying "How could you make a tomatoe taste so good"? Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made this for my husband and myself for supper. We love tomatoes and this was outstanding. We let it marinate for 3 hours. AWESOME!!!! Very easy.

Sliced homegrown tomatoes are good enough to stand on their own, but this recipe enhances their flavor nicely and creates a much prettier presentation, as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Momazirlott!

Made as-is, it's a bit too oily. Next time I'll cut back. WONDERFUL flavors, though.

Very good, I added a half a hot pepper finely chopped per our preference for hot. I had to use dried spices but it came out great. Thanks for the nice quick side dish.

Fabulous!!  I cut the recipe in half, and found that it needed an extra Tbl. of olive oil, + 1/4 tsp. salt + 1/8 tsp. pepper.  My store was out of fresh oregano, so I used 1/2 tsp. dried.  The garlic sounded like a ton, so I reduced it to 1 tsp. (for a halved recipe).  So glad I reduced it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple, and quick to put together.  Unfortunately I did not have fresh herbs, so had to use quality dried.  I cut the herbs down by half.  Added a small amount of sugar, and red wine vinegar to the dressing.  Substituted the Parmesan for Feta cheese.  Worked perfectly with my Lasagna dinner last night!

This is an excellent way to use fresh tomatoes. One note- they're not as good the second day out of the fridge...a bit soggy. Also, I used dried herbs instead (make sure to turn the tablespoons into teaspoons) but I'm sure its even better with fresh. Just don't make more than you think you'll eat- room temp is the way to go for serving.

This was very good and so easy. I thought it might need vinegar, but the cheese gives enough of a tang. I didn't have chives, but next time I'll add a small amount of shallot if I can't find chives again. Nice, simple salad!

This was pretty good.  I definitely agree that it needs some red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar.  I also threw some toasted pine nuts on top for some crunch.

Simple and delicious. I make as-is, but with just a 1/2 tsp of garlic) to sit in the fridge for 2-3 hours. When I serve, I slice up some buffalo mozzarella to go with it (if I have it in the house) and a light drizzle of balsamic glaze.  A nice side dish to go with a simple summer bbq.

4.14.18  Seemed to me that the herb-tomato ratio was off, and that’s not to say that I don’t like herbs and olive oil on fresh, tasty tomato sllices.  The amount of herbs just overpowered the tomatoes (both from a flavor and presentation perspective), and I didn’t even include the chives.  Honestly, I was just longing for a bit of vinegar, it was just too oily for my tastes.  I refrigerated the tomatoes for several hours and sprinkled the parmesan on just before serving, but I also didn’t like the transformation of the tomatoes after chilling...they just didn’t look too appetizing.  This recipe has had very good reviews, so I suspect my criticism is personal taste preference.  Just won’t be making this again.

Used tomatoes from garden with fresh herbs and about 5 tablespoons of red wine vinegar (which was a little too much).
Followed  rest of recipe for large gathering and people seemed to really like it.  I took home an empty plate.  I will make again using less red wine vinegar.

Made these over the weekend with Roma tomatoes that I had cut into chunks.  These were fantastic!  Would definitely make again, but this time maybe add a little Balsamic vinegar.

Lovely refreshing summer salad, especially if you have the herbs already growing in your garden. I did water the dressing down a bit and added some lemon juice to taste.

Loved the herb/oil mixture over the tomatoes but eliminated the garlic.  The chives give it a good "oniony" flavor.  All the garlic would have overpowered the dish and for some, like me, raw minced garlic repeats.  The herb/oil mixture also would make a nice side dish for homemade or market fresh bread.

I liked this a lot. If you have leftovers, they are great to throw into another recipe as a time-saver because they are already seasoned!
