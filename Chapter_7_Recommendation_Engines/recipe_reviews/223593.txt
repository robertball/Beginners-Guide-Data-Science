These deviled eggs were very simple to make and had a nice flavor.  I really liked the addition of the chopped pickles.  It gave them a nice sweet and tangy bite!  I wasn't so crazy about the addition of the honey mustard, but, that is just my personal preference.  I would probably just add a little yellow mustard instead next time.
