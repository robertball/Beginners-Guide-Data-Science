I didn't have any ice made so I just omitted it. I also added some maple syrup to sweeten it. The shake was very creamy and tasted good.

This recipe needs some kind of sweetener. I added agave syrup but it would have helped by using fruit sweetened greek yogurt.
After the agave it was delicious.

I love all things pumpkin. The only thing this needed for me was sweetener. I added two pkgs. of Truvia.
*I made a variation of this the next day. I added two more ice cubes and a half scoop of Jay Robb vanilla whey protein powder. Nice variation.

I love pumpkin everything! This shake is pretty awesome. I used unflavored almond milk, and after reading reviews stating it's bland, I decided to use vanilla Greek yogurt to help sweeten the deal. It came out perfect! Will be making this pretty often!

I had to make this my own as this is very bland as-is for me. I doubled the recipe and added 1 frozen banana (chopped), approx 2 tsp. vanilla extract, 4 packets truvia sweetener, only 1 cup almond milk in lieu of the 2 cups skim, substituted vanilla honey yogurt as that's what I had on hand, several dashes of pumpkin pie spice and topped with whipped cream. Approved by my very picky 10 year old.
