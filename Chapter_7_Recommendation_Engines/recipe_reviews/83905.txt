This was my first time making creme brulee, and it turned out great!  Couple things I did.  I heated the cream/sugar/salt over a double boiler until hot, but not boiling.  I tempered the eggs as stated in the recipe  before adding them to the cream mixture.  Once I added the egg mixture, I heated again until hot, but not boiling - then strained into a bowl with a pour spout.  I used the water bath as suggested, but did not cover them with the foil.  I baked for about 45 minutes, as my ramekins were not the short, wide ones - but the narrower, taller ones (I got 5 out of this recipe).  I cooled them for about 10 minutes before refrigerating them. I also brought them to room temp (about 40 minutes) before carmelizing the  top.  I used the broiler, but I think I will invest in a kitchen torch for the next time, as it made the mixture too hot, and I didn't have time to cool them again before serving.  The taste was WONDERFUL!

Yummmmm.  We made the recipe as-is, and caramelized the sugar in the oven.  We thought the creme brulee tasted great (with the vanilla as-is).  The chocolate was melty, not hard as a rock for us.  Although I'm sure it was hard as a rock after chilling in the fridge, putting it in the oven to caramelize the sugar melted it.  The amount of sugar in the recipe was too much for our ramekins, ours did not have that much surface area.  I would recommend only using enough sugar to just coat the top.

I made this recipe the other day and it turned out great! Definitely a keeper. Following the advice of others, I only sprinkled enough sugar just to coat the top of each ramekin. I also mixed a teaspoon of milk into the melted chocolate in each ramekin to prevent the chocolate from getting too hard in the refrigerator.

WOW, so good! I've made this at least 5 times now and every time it gets gobbled up, even if I botch it somehow, I almost scrambled the eggs once and another time I spilled water into it when filling up the water bath and it still got eaten!  One thing I always do is double the recipe, you will need to do this if you're serving more than 3 people. I also add a couple of tablespoons of milk to the chocolate so it will spread easier, then I stick it in the freezer until the creme brulee is ready. I find adding one extra egg yolk (to the doubled recipe) gives extra flavor. Make the creme brulee one day before but caramelize/torch the sugar just before you serve it.  It's really good when it's just below room temp.

This was great, but a few suggestions:
1. I followed the other's suggestions and halfed the vanilla
2. The chocolate was great, but hard as a rock.  I may try melting it in to the cream to make it a chocolate dessert
3. Half the amount of sugar on top.  It was way too thick.

Very good - I loved the twist the chocolate added.  Simple but decadent!  The vanilla was a bit too much, however.  Next time I'll use my own favorite creme brulee recipe and just coat the dishes with melted chocolate. Also I used whole milk (lactaid) with pretty good results - two of them set up well and the other two were a little loose, but still tasted good.

This is a great recipe.  Do not be afraid to double or even quadruple it.  I made a vat of it for a church dinner (enough to fill a 9"x13" pan) and then torched it when we were ready to eat.  There were many folks there who had never eaten this, and thought it was crummy of me to just bring "puddin" when everyone had backed beautiful texas sheet cakes and of course the beloved bundt! They sure changed their tune when they tasted it!  I don't take the credit-the recipe makes itself! Thanks

I love this recipe! I've made it several times, and heard nothing but rave reviews when I serve it. It's best served right after the 4-6 hours of chilling, otherwise the chocolate becomes too hard. But you can also add a little milk to the chocolate to help keep it softer. Instead of white sugar, I use raw sugar, ground powdery fine using a food processor or blender, and only use enough sugar to nicely coat the entire top. Then use a kitchen torch in quick, circular or back-and-forth motions, moving to a different area as the sugar starts to melt  to keep from burning it. Depending on the group I'm serving, the process of caramelizing can also be part of the entertainment for the evening! I've tried some other recipes, but this one is my favorite.

This was a great recipe in that the creme brulee was so rich and yummy.  I didn't care for the chocolate part only because it took a jackhammer to get to into it.  Next time I will try to adapt it with something that won't be so hard when it comes out of the fridge.  All in all, it is a good recipe.

Sinful is right!! The custard was deliciously creamy. Unfortunately, I didn't have any chocolate chips handy, but I couldn't skip the idea of a little chocolate kick. So instead, I spooned about a tablespoon (generous! Haha) of Nutella into the cups then microwaved them, and spread the chocolate in the cups. :) Worked like a charm! I will be making this again, thank you!!

I made this for my family last night and it was great!!  I followed the recipe and the chocolate on the bottom was a nice touch.  I have a torch and the topping was amazing.  Would definately make this again.

I loved it and so did my younger sisters and friends. It's true that it doesn't make enough but that can be modified. I made it with chocolate and nobody ate that part so I left it out the next time and it was eaten all up. It's a really good recipe. I make it all the time.

The first time I made this for a male friend,  he said he'd follow me to the ends of the earth.  The second time I made it, he wanted to marry me.  Yes, it's that good.

I have a pomegranate tree, full of Fruit. I juiced up 1 quart of juice, added a 1/2 cup of sugar, & brought it to a boil & cooked it down into a syrup. Then I drizzled this syrup over the above recipe before serving.Still have lots of syrup remaining for pancakes & waffles.

I was so happy at the way this turned out. I followed the recipe as is and had no problem with the choclate being to hard. I did however use the broiler to brown the sugar, and I happen to like the burlee on the warm side. It was also an easy and elegant desert. Thank-you so much for the recipe!

First time making these and it turned out great.  I doubled the recipe but kept the same amount of vanilla per other's suggestion and mixed milk with the chocolate since I used a torch to caramelize the sugar and didn't want it to be too hard from the fridge.  A lot of fun and exciting when it turned out great.

This is my first time making creme brulee and it turns out excellent! I made it twice within several days. Reduced chocolate to only 1 1/2 tbsp as I thought it was too much. And the second time I accidentally added sugar into the batter but it all turns out well. Will definitely re-use this recipe.

The custard part was really good!  The chocolate was also a tasty addition.  Because we used a torch to caramelize the sugar the chocolate did not melt all the way through after refrigeration.  Next time I would caramelize or warm in the broiler to melt the choclate.

a very tasty treat.  Here's what I do to increase the sinfulness (if that is indeed a word).  I bake it uncovered and it always sets perfectly.  This admittedly creates a slight film which becomes undetectable once the top is torched.  The consensus among tasters at my house is that less bruleed sugar is more for the carmelized topping.

This was a terrific brulee and much easier than my old stand-by from the New York Times. I did not use the chocolate.

I love this recipe! I've never made creme brulee before, I decided to try it and do not regret it! I have some short oval shaped ramekins and I ended up having extra left over, I only have 4 ramekins but could have filled 5. I also switched the chocolate chips for white chocolate chips and the taste was incredible!

This was wonderful! I was making for two, so cut the eggs to two, and used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 skim milk to ease the guilt pangs. I added the milk to the chocolate like some others have suggested. We put cappuccino flavored sugar on top. It was amazing -smooth creamy and the flavors worked so well together. Only change I would make is to not put the chocolate up the sides of the dish. It got singed by the torch.

Five stars all the way! This was a very easy and impressive dessert, my guests loved it and wanted more. I have made it with and without the chocolate and it is good both ways. I followed the instructions exactly. I just wish I had made more, I never get requests for second helpings for dessert:) Thank you!

OMG!  Thank you *SO* much for posting this recipe!  I took a chance on it & attempted making Creme Brulee for the first time for a dinner date, and it was AWESOME!
The amount of vanilla was perfect, but I love vanilla and frequently use more than recipes call for anyway.
I did follow a previous suggestion and added milk to the chocolate to keep it soft, and that worked very well.  That's the only alteration I made to the recipe, and it turned out fantastically!
I made it because creme brulee is his favorite dessert even though I don't generally care for it - not anymore!  :)

We skipped the chocolate part because we used a torch to brown the top and it wouldn't have heated the chocolate up to melt it.  If we ever do it under the broiler I would do it.  Very good and very easy.  Make the night before and let sit in the fridge until  you're ready to brown.  Served w/ strawberries and blueberries in individual bowls.  thanks!

All I can say is... AMAZING! This was so delicious and simple! The chocolate at the bottom was a nice addition. Not too overpowering and not too sweet! The texture was perfectly smooth and just when I thought I messed up and some water got into one of the ramekins, that one still turned out great!

Added a few sliced strawberries to go on top and it was a wonderful touch! Wouldn't change a thing with this recipe. Also, the hint of vanilla in the creme brulee was beautiful!

Yum!

The creme brûlée was fabulous. The chocolate probably needed cream like someone else suggested.

This was my first time making creme brulee.. And it was wonderful! I halved the recipe for 2 ramekins.. But used 3 egg yolks instead of 2.5 
Also based in other reviews it seems like if you are crisping the sugar with a kitchen torch then the chocolate around the edges end up being hard. So I melted my chocolate with the creme. 
The end result was amazing.. And I'm so glad I finally got up the courage to make a creme brulee. Thanks!

This was a good recipe. I ended up having to refrigerate it overnight and most of the next day - which I'm not sure if it effected it. It took more than 3 minutes for the sugar topping to melt and carmalize (sort of). During that time the chocolate and the custard got pretty hot. I found the custard slightly bland, but the chocolate helped with it. I will try this recipe again.

Awesome!  My husband and I loved the crunchiness of the topping along with the sweet, smooth rich taste of the custard.  And the chocolate blended the tastes perfectly.

This is a nice recipe.  I didn't find the custard to be silky smooth like I've had in restaurants, but it had a nice flavor.  I did find the chocolate to be a little overpowering, so if I make it again, I might use half the suggested amount.  I did use my broiler to caramelize the sugar, and the heat softened the chocolate.  Overall, tasty, but not perfect.

I skipped the chocolate part cause I wanted to taste a normal creme brulee seeing as I've never had creme brulee before.
It tasted really good but the instructions were rather confusing. I recommend adding exact temperatures for parts like when heating up the cream/sugar but since there were none I just used the same temperature I use for making other custards.
I would've given this a 4 for not good instructions but it brought back some cool memories of me as a kid...

It was a little grainy and took forever to set up. That was probably my fault though, I was used to making custards which can be eaten warm and solid out of the oven. This was just not one of those. I'm not going to make it again.
