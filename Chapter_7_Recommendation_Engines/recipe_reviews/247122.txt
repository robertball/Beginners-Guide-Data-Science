This was a simple recipe with few ingredients, but, had very good flavor!  I am not a fan of boiled vegetables, so, I roasted the asparagus & red pepper in a little olive oil and salt & pepper before adding to the beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

Cooked beans as recipe calls for and chilled in fridge. Saut√©ed asparagus and red peppers and tosses in chilled beans to cool them.
