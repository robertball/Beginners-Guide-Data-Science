Mmm good, flavor increases if you let it sit for a bit. Went back for seconds only this time I added Sriracha and it was even better. Next time I'm going to try adding scallions, green onion, & pineapple. Hi sister Martha :-)

Thank you for this yummy recipe! I do not own a dutch oven so I improvised with process. I sauteed my cod in a shallow pan with extra virgin olive oil, 5 minutes on each side. Sometimes it falls apart in the pan which is no big deal to us. In a separate saute pan heated the lime juice, rice vinegar, brown sugar, and soy sauce. Mine never thickened either but brought to a boil. Added tomatoes. Then put sauce with tomatoes in the cod pan and warmed together, then served. Very tangy tasting! Yum!

I would not have thought to combine these flavors, but they take the cod to a whole better place.  I used tomatoes from the garden with some basil and sage leaves in with the brown sugar sauce.  Delicious.  The cod smelled so good it was gone before I could get a picture, maybe next time! Do try this if you are tired of the same old boring baked cod.

I liked the flavor and used the sauce on rice. Very simple with good flavor. I also substituted the rice vinegar with balsamic vinegar.

I'd make this again.  My wife doesn't like lime so I used lemon juice but then I ran out of lemon juice so I used mango and it still worked out pretty tasty, although probably more sweet than tangy.

Super yummy, very easy to make. I added lime zest to the top of the fish before baking as we love lime. I served it with quinoa and carrots.

Nice and sweet, but it's lacking a crunch. Something that adds a bit of texture would really up this dish.

I would give this zero stars if I could.  Started out making exactly as directed, but after stirring and simmering the glaze 20-25 minutes and it not getting any thicker at all, I added a bit of thickener.  After it was thickened, I put the cod in the sprayed pan as directed and covered.  After 10 minutes of baking, the fish still wasn't cooked which was no big deal, but the glaze became funky looking.  Baked another 5 minutes and the glaze looked even worse.
Went out for dinner.

The sauce was amazing and gave just the right flavor to the fish. I had to cook it longer than the 10 minutes given in the recipe for the fish to cook all the way through but my fillets were quite thick.

This glaze works amazingly well on this fish. Next time I will double the glaze and keep the extra on the side for dipping.
