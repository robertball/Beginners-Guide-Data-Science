Having a dinner party tonight and made this for my guests. I thought it needed just a tad more sweet but other than that I love it. Since two of my guests are juvenile diabetics I added one packet of Sweet N Low. Thanks for the post! ***Update*** My dinner guests LOVED this and asked for the recipe! Make sure you give this recipe time for the flavors to meld.

We loved it! I used 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 white vin. and 1/2 & 1/2 olive oil/ veg. oil. I think Balsamic gives it more flavor. I also added more hot pepper sauce. We like zing in our food. Thanks for the delicious recipe. Tastes even better the next day after everything gets a chance to blend.

Not only was this an excellent salad dressing, we marinated pork loin chops all day in this dressing before putting them on the grill, and they were fabulous!

This is a great salad dressing and very easy.  I usually add a couple extra cloves of garlic to the recipe.  I also add extra kosher salt when I toss it.  It tastes great for quite a few days for salad all week and if you don't use it all or you need a quick marinade, it makes great grilled chicken.  Very versatile!

This is absolutely delicious.  The only adjustment I made was to add about 1/2 tablespoon more of the mustard. Everyone I have served it to has liked it. It is especially good on mixed greens with some asparagus in the salad.

Vinaigrette just like I like it -light, not too acidic and NOT made with balsamic vinegar (don't care for it at all), not to mention an oil to vinegar ratio of 3:1. (Well, I adjust it to that ratio) I used white wine vinegar, olive oil and skipped the hot sauce.  It's not difficult at all to eat a good, tossed salad with a dressing like this.

Outstanding!  I used a spicy pepper mustard instead of what the recipe called for, and a few more shakes of the hot sauce and it turned out sweet and wonderful!

Excellent vinaigrette dressing!  I cut the amount in half and added a little splenda for added sweetness.

I've tried several of the dressings on this site, and I have to say this is the best. I reduced the oil by a little under half. My goodness, I could drink this out of the bottle! So long store-bought dressing!

A keeper.  My only change was that I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  Next time I think I will use more mustard.  I also want to play around with different kinds of vinegars.  Thanks!

Great tasting - different than your norman honey mustard dressing.  I added more honey, and also added about a teaspoon of white sugar to make it just a bit sweeter.  Thanks!  Will use this a lot this summer.

This was the yummiest dressing I've ever tasted! So sweet and tangy! I added more honey and used the spicy brown mustard instead of dijon. Poured it over lots of salad greens and a little purple onion. I'm going to add some mandarin oranges and maybe some slivered almonds next time. Thanks for this recipe...it's a keeper.

I thought this was great.  My husband will ONLY eat honey mustard type dressings and I am not fond of them but we both really loved this, such a great compromise!  I think it would go great with any type of tossed salad.

Gotta make more!  The kids love it. Used white wine vinegar and olive oil.  Everytime I make a salad now the kids say's "Do we have that GOOD Dressing?"  This will be a staple at my house now.

This dressing was spectacular.  Since I have kids I did use about half the pepper and only one clove of garlic.  My whole family loved it.  It is something other than the usual boring dressings available in the store.  My three year old couldn't get enough of it.  I will make it again and again and again!

This vinaigrette is excellent!  Everyone I've served it to just loves it!  (I used white wine vinegar instead of just white vinegar - not sure if it makes a difference.)

This has been our "house" dressing for the past few years.  I started using it while living in Scotland - the store bought dressings there are pretty bad. Now we won't go back to store bought, even in the US.  This dressing changed us! 
EVERYONE loves it, my sister says she could drink it straight!

The only change I make is to use fresh squeezed lemon juice in place of the vinegar (hubby is anti-vinegar) and sometimes (when I don't have hot sauce) use cayenne.  Great with Mediterranean food!  
Warm pita stuffed with green salad and feta with this dressing = YUM! 
Thanks for posting it!

This was awesome! I used Splenda instead of the honey to keep it as low in calories as possible. You could also substitute half the oil with a strong broth if you like - I used 1/2 cup reconstituted vegetable bouillon.

Made this to use on a salad.  My husband and 2 kids 12 and 3 loved it.  It was simple and all ingredients easily on hand. I did add a tad more hot sauce.

I know I shouldn't rate a recipe if I have not followed it exactly as written, but I did not have white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar instead. It was a little too tart for me at first, but when I added another tablespoon of honey, it was just right. Thank you!

I used olive oil as suggested by a few people and I didn't think it went well.  Next time I will use veg oil and give this recipe a fair rating it probably deserves.

I was watching a cooking show the other day and someone made a simple mustard vinaigrette that looked good.  I didn't catch the whole recipe so I came on here to go exploring and found this gem.  I usually make Italian dressing or a sesame Asian dressing, and I get bored with it, but no more!! This dressing actually has me craving salad.  There's just enough honey to cut through the vinegar but not so much that it's actually a sweet dressing (which is a perfect for what I want).  And I like the amount of salt in this. Excellent.

I used an old whole grain mustard and I had to add more mustard. I think this would earn 1 more star if it had a green herb or second note to it like cumin or something.

Wow! This is great stuff! I made a couple minor changes- I used apple cider vinegar, because that is what I had on hand. And I also added a tiny bit of brown sugar, just as personal preference. I made it yesterday, and it was very good right after I made it. I refrigerated the leftovers, and I am having some today, and it is even better! Aside from the flavor, what I like best is that it is made with ingredients that I typically have on hand and it is quick and easy to make. Great recipe!

yum!  we used it on a simple spring salad with craisins and pecans.  i used apple cider vinegar since it's supposed to be healthier and a spicy mustard so i didn't use hot sauce.

A good dressing, I too added extra honey, use a jar to mix it and it turned out great! I put it on a chopped salad, made of romaine, iceberg, small tube pasta, chicken breast, bacon, tomato, gorgonzola cheese & green onions...yummm!

Way too oily for my taste. I had to add a half cup of Balsamic Vinegar along with the white vinegar. I added a packet of Equal as well....there is nothing like just ev olive oil and Balsamic vinegar for a dressing. This dressing was not worth the trouble.

Great starter recipe, but I had to add/adjust a few things. Red wine vinegar is a great sub for white vinegar. Definately had to cut  back on the oil, but added a little more mustard and got a better consistency. Also, red pepper flake is a must, even in addition to a few drops of hot sauce. As tangy as it is, it needs a little more spice.

VERY good! Took some of the suggestions and used half olive oil and half balsamic vinegar.  Also added extra honey and dijon mustard. Next time will probably half the salt and only use 1 teaspoon.  Otherwise, turned out wonderful!!! Will be using often!

I just tried this vinaigrette minus the hot sauce and subbing organic agave syrup for honey since that's what I had on hand.  This was one of the simplest, most delicious vinaigrettes I've ever tried!  This is definitely a keeper!

Being on a diet, I've been making my own salad dressing as of late and got bored of my balsamic vinaigrette.  This recipe was a perfect alternative.  Since I was on a diet, I didn't use honey and opted for 3 packets of Stevia instead, starting at 1 packet and increasing it to my taste preference.  I also put in red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce since I didn't have any on hand and I'd seen Jacques Pepin do it on one of his shows.  I used regular ol' yellow mustard too since I didn't have Dijon, which was fine, just a bit more tart.  I also forgot the minced garlic (oops!) but I didn't even notice at all until I checked the recipe again after eating my salad.  I'll have to remember for next time.

Some alterations for personal taste: 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of distilled white vinegar and 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar, used siracha for hot sauce. Used this with pasta salad. Yum!

Fabulous dressing. It was my first! I'm traveling in Central America and they don't sell dressing in the marcados, so I'm very happy I found this great recipes. I added some rosemary and a bay leaf to give it a little something extra. Simply wonderful for cabbage and beet salads!!

Very nice recipe.  I think you may consider the garlic and/or hot sauce as "optional".  I chose to leave them out, wanting a more classic honey mustard, and it was very tasty.  I also scaled down the amount of oil and thought it came out fine--a little bit thicker, perhaps, but it did help me save some calories!

This was delicious, the only change I made was 1/2 cup EVOO and 1/2 cup canola oil in exchange for the 1 cup vegtable oil. My brother who doesn't like vinagaigrette, even enjoyed this one! Thank you for the recipes.

YUM!  I am back referencing this page again because my boyfriend constantly requests this recipe.  This vinaigrette tastes wonderful...tangy, a little sweet, and just a bit of heat for the perfect balance.  I do use just a little less oil, but that's all I change.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

I did half dijon and half whole grain mustard.  It was totally fine.  I added 2 tablespoons of sugar because I felt it needed it (I tend to like dressings a bit sweet).  The sugar made it less vinegar-y and softened the taste a lot.

Yum.  First made this last night, and have given the recipe to 3 people today! Very tasty and easy, and really dressed up a basic salad of greens, cucumber, carrot and lightly blanched sugar snaps and corn with a  little shaved parmesan.  Would not have considered marinating meat in this (it's for salad right?)- but after reading other reviews I will give it a try. Thanks for the recipe, I am sure we will eat it often!

Pretty simple recipe. I did listen to the reviews, and substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, but I didn't use as much, and added just a little bit more vinegar to cut the too bitter taste of the olive oil. Very easy to put together and tasted pretty good over my rice and beans. Will have to grab a refillable bottle and make some more.

This is my new go-to vinaigrette recipe. I'm not a crazy fan of bottled salad dressing so I always tend to make my own. This hits the mark perfectly. It's not really spicy so if you like more spice up the amount of hot sauce. I just really love it as is. It's TO DIE FOR!

I used white wine vinegar for the white vinegar and a 3 to 1 proportion of EVOO to canola oil for the vegetable oil.  I'd love to add more honey for extra sweetness, but as a diabetic will probably just add a bit of artificial sweetener next time instead.  I might want to add more mustard, too, and maybe some additional hot pepper sauce to up the flavor a bit. For us it is a good start on a basic vinaigrette, but needs some adjustment to get the flavors to our personal taste.

I will definitely make this again.  It's a superb "make it your own" base recipe.  If you like more kick, add more hot sauce, if you want more sweet, throw in a bit of sugar/Splenda, if you like more tang, add more vinegar.  You get the idea.  Be sure to make ahead so all the flavors meld and *then* add whatever you'd like.  I made this for a romaine/green apple/cheddar cheese/chicken/chopped almond salad I threw together.  Delish!!!

I made this as is and it's not good. Too much oil and salt. It honestly tasted just bland salty oil!  I have a creamy honey mustard dressing but wanted a honey mustard vinaigrette, so tried this one due to the reviews, but sadly disappointed.  I remade it using white wine vinegar, no salt, more black pepper, hot sauce,  mustard and honey along with cutting the oil in half.  I don't like writing bad reviews but as stated not what I was looking for just a good place to start.

I think making salad dressing for guests shows that you appreciate their company, I wanted something that would go with a bag of spring mix salad.  I used half canola oil and half olive oil, I reduced the salt to one and a half teaspoons. You can always add, but can't remove. It was great, I will make it with a coarse grind mustard next time just for contrast.

I rate a recipe on the recipe.  Not on how it was after several changes, so therefore I rate this a one star.  As written it is very bland and taste mostly of oil.

I did stray from the original recipe some, but I feel that if it were made as written, it would be incredible.  I made a single serving and used about half the oil called for to keep the calories and fat lower.  I loved this dressing!  Definitely a keeper.

My whole family loved this dressing (kids are 7 and 10).  WAAAYY better than what you can buy for a vinaigrette.  Solid bet for a dinner party or keep in fridge and use through the week for your mid-week salads.

Great recipe! My fav dressing so far. I made some slight alterations- halved the amount of oil ( used extra light olive oil in place of veg oil ), didn't have white vinegar at hand so used raspberry vinegar instead, and omitted the hot sauce ( as hubby doesn't like anything remotely spicy!). Was lovely with a salad of spinach leaves, strawberries, green apples, roasted almonds, dried cranberries and feta cheese ( see spinach strawberry salad recipe in this website!). Thank you!
Update: forgot to mention -  did not add 2 tsp salt ( I probably wouldn't add so much salt to any dish) 1/2 a tsp seemed to suffice for us!

With the proportions mentioned in the recipe, my wife and I found it a bit too oily.  We added another 1/4-1/3 cup of Apple Cider vinegar and another 1-1 1/2 teaspoons of mustard, and it sang!  A really enjoyable dressing.

I was looking for a new vinaigrette to try for chopped veggie salads when I stumbled upon this one.  There's a mustardish vinaigrette on one of my favorite salads here and I was intrigued by the hot sauce in this one, so I decided to give it a whirl, fully expecting to LOVE it.  While I didn't end up LOVING it, it is a very nice, light, crisp vinaigrette, but I felt like I was missing a little something, though I can't pinpoint exactly what that something is.  Thanks for the recipe, sal!

I love this dressing with a spicy mustard! I use a stick blender, and it emulsifies the oil, making a thick, creamy dressing.

This was an amazing salad dressing! So easy- I didnt add hot sauce and I equaled oil to vinegars with just an extra splash of oil at the end. Also used half grain mustard and half just regular hot dog mustard. I am addicted! I used it on 2 salads 2 days in a row!

I halved this and used it as a marinade for cooked green beans with a couple slices of sweet onion. Excellent!

Excellent, tangy vinaigrette. Made with white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, with great results. Makes lots. Thanks!

I used this dressing as a variation of Emily's Famous Roasted Vegetable Salad, also on this site.  The only change to the dressing that I made was to use red wine vinegar because I didn't have white.  I crushed the garlic into the dressing after roasting whole cloves with the vegetables.  The salad recipe called for the squash and eggplant to be sliced and I chopped them instead. I also cooked the veggies for a total of 20 minutes.  Using the recommended time would have over-cooked them. My hubby-to-be had his first bite and thinks I created perfection...can't claim the recipe as my own, though.

This was just a little bland, not sure why. LIke the basic vinaigrette and just think it needs a little something extra.  Next time I will add some lemon juice.

I wasn't crazy about this - I think following the recipe as is would have been way too much oil, and too much vinegar.  I did as some others suggested and cut the oil, however I used vinegar as in recipe and it was too tart.  Proportions definitely need tweaking.

This was a four star dressing (just a bit too sweet) until I tried it on pasta salad. Cooked pasta, mustard vinaigrette, and whatever is lying in the fridge = my invitation to any barbecue all summer. No mayo spoilage!!

This was pretty good.  After tasting I added a little more honey.  Also, thought the oil was too much for us.  Will make again with less oil and a little extra honey.

I think this is a great vinaigrette, but I made some changes that make it the best!  Use less vinegar - with the mustard, it is too tart.  I also doubled the honey since the vinegar needed something to counter balance it.  I also added more mustard to achieve that mustard taste.  After all, it is a mustard vinaigrette.  Since extra virgin olive oil is better for you, I substituted it for the vegetable oil.  If you are not used to EVOO, then this substitution may come to a surprise when you taste it.  This also stores in the fridge for days.

Good!  I used part Extra Virgin Olive Oil, could maybe use a little less oil.  Also, it seemed kind of bland, so I added a little more mustard and honey.  I took it to a friends house with a salad and everyone loved it and put it on their chicken as well as their salad.

The vinegar was a little overwhelming. I played around with the recipe to make it more to my liking. I added extra honey, a bit of soya sauce and I used olive oil.

I have been on this kick for awhile of making my own dressings. It's cheaper, healthier and many instances better than what you can get from the store. This Mustard Vinaigrette is one of those examples. It's a simple, tangy dressing that goes well with meat, fruit, cheese or whatever you put on your salad.  It's wonderful! I used olive oil instead of vegetable as it was all I had, and though it was great.

This dressing is delicious, quick, and easy - I had all the ingredients on hand and threw it together right before dinner. Only two small changes: I used 1/2 c. veg. oil and 1/2 c. olive oil (as recommended by another reviewer) and added a little extra mustard and honey to taste. I served this over a simple field greens salad with sauteed shrimp - and I wished I had a piece of bread to mop up the leftover dressing!

Great dressing! I skipped the salt and used evoo which after all of the other ingredients were in my food processor, I slowly drizzled to help emulsify. I used apple cider vinegar and didn't measure the oil. I stopped when it looked and tasted right. Yum!

I thought that this was very oily.  So after I made it, I waited until the oil separated from the rest of the ingredients and poured out half of it.  Once I did this my husband and I both loved the taste of it.

Simple - easy - delicious

My sister-in-law was visiting and I needed a quick dairy free dressing. This was great. I accidentally doubled the honey and the mustard and I think I would do that again if I made it.

Really nice dressing. So happy to have found it. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a tad salty and it needed to be a tad sweeter. Maybe I needed it sweeter to balance the salt? I used extra virgin olive oil. I will definitely make it often!

I did not like this recipe. I followed the instructions but left out the hot sauce since I don’t eat it. The recipe yielded more oil for my liking and surprisingly was too tart. I will not make this one again.

Love it.  Have started to hate every salad dressing there is on the market.  So finding this was awesome!  It is quick, tasty and I make a bunch so that we can use it all week.  I keep it in the fridge and take it out about a half hour before I want to use it, so the olive oil can adjust to room temp again.  Yummy!

delightful dressing, I suggest making the day before to let the oil absorb the flavors of the ingredients.

I made it exactly as listed.  A nice robust dressing that I used for steak salad with bleu cheese.  I didn't notice the heat at all.  Would have been just as good without the hot sauce.

I made chef John's http://allrecipes.com/recipe/239230/chef-johns-coq-au-vin/ and it was pretty rich in the sauce with the butter and other ingredients.  This salad dressing was AMAZING and broke up some of that richness... I'll definitely be making again.  I can see using it in a tuna salad in the summer too

The flavor when I made it was nice.... but I did not consider it hot and I didn't taste a lot of mustard. To suit our tastes I put 3 tablespoons of mustard in and added six more drops of hot sauce.  Then we thought ot was delicious tossed with homegrown lettice for a nice salad but I want to rate it as it was written.

This was excellent and so easy! The only thing I did differently was add slightly more honey to taste and left out the hot sauce. I served it over sliced hard boiled eggs and lettuce for breakfast; now I'm hooked!

This was so easy to make and was excellent over a large tossed dinner salad. I went with the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio (used white wine vinegar) and for the oil used half olive oil and half canola. I went heavy handed with the garlic, and also found that I needed to add more honey. Overall a delicious vinaigrette that I know I'll make again. Thanks sal!

Made this and my guests loved it instantly. I put balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, oregano flakes and fish sauce. Really complimented my Kale/Romaine/Cherry tomatoes/Carrots and yellow radish salad.

Wanting something zippy and tangy to go with the salmon dinner I was making, I tried this recipe.  My only change--I put all ingredients into a salad dressing jar and shook it up instead of whisking it together, it really didn't need anything else!  Very nicely balanced flavors, I will definitely make it again!

My husband made the recipe as written.  It was so delicious it left me wanting to lick my salad bowl after it was gone!  It has so much flavor, and I love the combination of sweet and savory.  This recipe will become one of our go to's for salads!

Great recipe.  I am allergic to garlic so I have to omit it. Although the mustard has garlic in it, I can try a little. Recipes never taste as good without the garlic, but have to adjust it.  Wish there was a substitute for garlic.

I didn't have actual Dijon so used grainy mustard, and I can't have nightshades so I eliminated the hot sauce, and I subbed olive oil. I used a wand blender to blend it. It was great!!! With my very limited diet at the moment it is nice to find a dressing with most of the ingredients that I can actually have. Next time I might add a bit more honey.

When I looked in the refrigerator and saw that I was out of salad dressing after I had already put together my spinach salad with parmesan and cherry tomatoes, I was quite disappointed.  Then, it dawned on me to make my own dressing.  So, I looked up a recipe, decided on this one, and within five minutes, I was enjoying my delicious salad.  This recipe is simple, fast, and has an excellent flavor.  It is slightly sweet, mildly tangy, and perfectly smooth.  I loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

Sooooooo quick and simple.  The honey, vinegar, hot sauce, and mustard are a great pairing.  I used a deli brown mustard, apple cider vinegar, and homemade habanero hot sauce, and I think it's great.  Far better than anything at the store.  I even used powdered garlic.  I did that because putting raw garlic in oil can be a no-no because of bacteria.  The vinegar might counter it or something but I have no real clue, plus I was feeling lazy!

Fantastic! My 8 year old picky eater loved it. I did however use olive oil instead of veritable oil and added an extra bit of Sri racha hot sauce for some extra kick ;)

Made a salad for company and whipped this up as I had everything on hand and didn't want to use store bought dressing. A complete hit! For the salad I used: A head of green lettuce, a chopped up Braeburn apple, Carrot peelings, halved cherry tomatoes, and chopped up RED onion. Seriously delicious! I suggest making this a day or two in advance as the flavors meld and get even better. Quick and easy menu idea: serve alongside BBQ pulled pork sandwiches (McCormick slowcooker spice pack is great and I use kaiser rolls from the bakery) topped with grated cotija cheese and cilantro, and maybe a chocolate cream pie? The meal totally hit the spot and besides the pie, came together quickly.

Perfect as a vinaigrette! However, if you're looking for something a bit creamier, this isn't the dressing for you.  Just a hint of honey and dijon, oil and vinegar are the real stars here.

Very good, but I added salt only to taste. The amount called for in the recipe seemed high, and it was plenty flavorful without the exact amount.

Can prepare w/ or without the oil. Whichever your preference. I like them both. Yummy
