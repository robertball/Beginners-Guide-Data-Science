I brought this to a party and people were raving about it! It is soooo good.  I used roasted red peppers from a jar to save time and served it with pieces of pita bread and sliced cucumbers.  I will definitely be making this again soon!!!

I had all the ingredients on hand since we just had gyros for dinner the other night.  Wish I would have had this with the dinner!  I did cheat and used the jarred roasted peppers.  I also added a little lemon juice for zing.  This was fantastic.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe.  When I tried it out on my friends they loved it.  It is ridiculously easy and highly customizable.  Last time I made it I used the normal nonfat Publix yogurt, but think I may try the thicker Greek style next time for a little more body.  I also would experiment with upping it to one and a half or even two peppers, since the feta is a strong taste that, though delicious, seems to steal the show from the peppers.  Highly recommended.

This was fantastic - totally addictive, I couldn't stop eating it! I used a little ground chipotle instead of cayenne - with the fresh garlic it was an excellent kick! Make it skinnier with reduced fat feta and fat free yogurt.

Great recipe, but I make mine a little different.  I use two red peppers which I sautee myself and I include the garlic and add some basil as well here with the olive oil.  Once it cools, I add the entire mixture to the food processor along with 1/3 cup of plain yogurt (to taste, can be omitted completely) and 1 1/2 tea of hot sauce (also to taste and can be omitted.

I had this dip at a greek bistro in SLC,  we thought it was delish and this recipe is exactly what we had! Amazingly good, gets spunkier as it marinates for a few days. If you love feta this dip is for you. Yum!!!

I used jarred roasted red peppers and found that there was not much flavor to this dip.  If I made it again I would try fresh roasted red peppers and definitely let it marinade for a day.

It was tasty, though I used the food processor instead of the blender.  Next time the blender, and hopefully it will be smoother!  I used 1 pepper, 4 oz of light feta, 2 cloves of garlic (just 1 next time!), a tsp of lemon juice, and 1/4c light sour cream.  I will make it again.

I had some problems trying to get the results I wanted from this recipe, and in the process used almost every small appliance in my kitchen.  First, the feta didn't blend completely, so the texture was chunky.  After a few minutes in the blender, the texture was better, but thin.  I ended up adding cream cheese to the mix and it ended up quite wonderful, but only after a lot of attention and transferring the mix from food processor to blender to bowl with a hand mixer.

The Feta taste was strong.  My family ate it, but not ALL of it.  I did like the ease of this recipe.

This was a simple recipe, but we felt it had too much of a feta taste, which overpowered the other ingredients.

Like others said, it's a good base receipe. I've ramped up the roasted pepper amount 3 times, otherwise the dip is too salty. The added peppers do make the dip more liquidy which may be a good thing or not. I like mine runny. Easy to dip pita and veggies. I also added hot sause. Peppers from a can work well.

I used 3 red peppers I roasted myself and cut back the yogurt to 2 tablespoons.  I think if I would have used less pepper and more yogurt that the pepper taste wouldn't have been strong enough for us.  I love how quick and easy this recipe.  And will add it to the recipe box!

So easy to make.  I only had a 5 oz. carton of Feta and used Greek yogurt.  I loved the flavor and will definitely make it again.

This has excellent flavor and is simple to make.  Can be spread on eggplant sandwiches.  The garlic gets stronger the longer it ages.  My kids don't appreciate the garlic smell but it tastes sooooo good!

Definitely needs 2 peppers as written. Very good but makes a lot as this is a strong flavor. Went over well at my BBQ. I served it with drizzled EVOO and parsley on top and carrots and pita chips for dipping.

Delicious flavor!  Could use more yogurt for creamier texture.   Mine came out more like a spread than a dip, but still delicious!

Made the recipe as directed. Way too salty for me. I started eating the dip with nachos, but quickly realized I has to use something less salty like pita bread. Next time, I would use about half as much feta cheese.

I found it a little bland, so added some lemon juice and greek spice. Tasty but a little runny. I even drained the yogurt so it would be thicker. I did use low fat though. Next time I will try adding a little low fat cream cheese.
