I had a bucket of dried figs sitting around and didn't know what to do with them. This recipe was perfect. The figs made the loaf moist with a good texture and compliment the flavour of bananas nicely. The only change I made was to add some walnuts, which were a nice touch. I will definately make this again!

This was very good and moist, but I save 5 stars for amazing. I used 3/4 cups fresh figs instead of dried and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, regular milk and white flour (what I had on hand). I think if I make it again, I will reduce the amount of cinnamon and add other spices, like maybe nutmeg or allspice, for a richer flavor.

My only changes were to use regular milk instead of soy, and I chopped and soaked my figs in the microwave for a minute in a little water to soften them up. It made a dense, moist loaf, pefectly, lightly sweet.  I used the olive oil and didn't notice a flavor change, but appreciated the healthier oil ingredient.  Recipe is a keeper, thanks!

I needed to use up some figs and gave this recipe a try and I'm glad I did.  It's really good!  I used AP flour since that's all I had and a bit more cinnamon, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely will make this again!   
**update**  So I made muffins with this recipe and I baked for 25-30 mins. @ 350 degrees F.  Turned out very nice  :)

While I can't giving it a super-glowing review, I was still impressed with the flavor and moistness of this recipe. I used whole milk and AP flour because it's all I had on hand. I also added toasted, chopped walnuts, which was a pleasant addition. I think next time I will up the bananas (I may have been slightly short??) and cinnamon... then I'll have a winner. They had perfectly puffed tops (I made muffins...). I'm willing to give this another go!

Wow.  This is a healthy recipe for a normally fat laden breakfast treat.  I could not believe how moist this bread is with only the 2 tablespoons of oil.  I didn't have whole wheat flour around, but I just used 3 cups of white, unbleached instead and just regular milk in place of the soy.  Love.  Love.  Love.  Yummy...I didn't feel a bit of guilt eating this and I can serve it in good conscience to my kids.

Used fresh, in-season figs instead of dried, added pecans, put in a dash of almond oil and made in muffin cups for easy breakfast on the road. Cooked for 40 rather than 55 because they were muffins instead of a loaf. Makes 24 delicious and moist muffins.

I didn't have whole wheat flour so used AP. 2 cups seemed like plenty so I didn't add the last 1/2 cup. I also used Penzey's baking spice instead of cinnamon. These turned out good, but they didn't knock my socks off to give it a 5.

This is a yummy, healthy recipe! I made it into muffins. Great with strawberry cream cheese or peanut butter. I did make a few changes: I upped the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp., subbed applesauce for the eggs, & used fresh figs. I also added chopped walnuts. I will be adding this to my favorite recipes!

The texture is lovely, but the taste is a little bland, even after I added some ginger. It makes 18 normal size muffins.
