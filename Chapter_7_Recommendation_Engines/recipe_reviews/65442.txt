I want to say a big thank you to some of the people who have tried my recipe and given me some great tips. I know the cucumbers can 'leak' their juices and make too much liquid so I usually add them close to serving, but I didn't know about that cool trick with the salt. I will be trying that next time I make these.  Also I found out when my hubby makes these he uses red wine or apple cider vinegar which gives this a great taste.  I noticed one reviewer said she used sour cream because she had no mayo...my Mom used to do that also, I found out my sister tends to make it that way.  Again, thanks for trying the recipe and glad you like it.

Good recipe.  If you salt the sliced cukes and let them chill in a colander for an hour or so, they'll lose much of their water and hold on to the dressing.  Maybe there was a little too much mayo and I used fresh dill, which I think is better than dry, but otherwise thanks for the recipe!

This salad was an absolute delight!! It had the perfect blend of what I was looking for, although I did add a bit more vinegar, and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, and used walla walla onions.  I know we shouldn't rate when there have been substitutions, but this one really rocks!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.  It only gets better with more time in the fridge!!!! YUM!

Oh boy! This is good! We just hit our first day over 100 degrees yesterday, so I wanted to start doing summer cool recipes. This will be a hit all summer. 
I was afraid of the sugar, seemed like too much, but I like to be true to a recipe for the first time, and it worked really nicely. I couldnt find my white vinegar so I used rice vinegar (then found the white) and it also worked very well. There is something about the combination of cool cucmber and the salty sweet dressing that makes you want to have more. I kept taking sneak bites before I could put it in the fridge to cool. 
I wouldnt do anything different, Yum!

Very Good!  I scaled back to 4 servings and only used about 2 tablespoons of sugar.  After slicing cucumber I drained them for about 15 minutes.  This is to keep from adding additional liquid to the dressing and making it thin and watery.  Great summer salad

YUM!  My cucumber were on the larger rather than medium side, so the full cup of mayo worked - if they were smaller I could see where there would be too much dressing.  I also used splenda in place of the sugar and 1/2 sweet onion.  Plus I sprinkled the sliced cucumbers with a little salt and let them sit then rinsed before adding the dressing.  It was still good and not watery the next day.

This salad is terrific with a spicy dish, like hot wings, etc. We love onions, so I added 1/2 c. thinly sliced sweet red onion. The salad tastes even better if you marinade for a while. I'll make thia a lot!

This is an awesome recipe. I had been searching for a good creamy cucumber salad recipe, and I found it! Of course, I added 1 sliced onion to the mix. It was great!

Great flavors!!  Love the ease of preparation. 

My ONLY complaint is that mine is very watery.  I made it yesterday evening and this morning it is pretty watery.  I guess next time I'll try the salt trick I've read about.  

Otherwise, it would have been 5 stars for taste and ease!

Excellent recipe! I fixed it just as written.  I also took advice from others about prepping the cucumbers:  salt, chill one hour in colander; rinse; chill one hour in colander, then add dressing and chill.

With the exception of halving recipe I followed exactly.  All three of us really liked recipe.  Next time I'll add a little red onion as another reviewer suggested. Four star because of excess moisture.  Thanks.

WOW! This was absolutely FANTASTIC!!! My neighbor hand-delivered an AWEESOME plate of food a few nights ago (she knows I'm on my own for dinner on Tuesday nights). She made a delicious cucumber salad to accompany the bacon wrapped filet and rice pilaf she prepared. I LOVED her unique salad and have been craving it ever since. :) I usually like my cucumbers marinated in a vinegar / sugar mixture, but decided to try a creamy version this time around - and boy I'm glad I did! With the exception of halving this (my hubs hates cucumbers!) and adding half a (sliced) red onion, a GENEROUS dose of fresh cracked black pepper and 2 small cloves of (minced) garlic, I made no significant changes. NOTE: To avoid a watery mess, you must sweat your cucumbers FIRST. Simply place your sliced cucumbers in a colander set over a large bowl, sprinkle with 1-2 t of salt (~ 1/2 t per cuke) and allow to sit for 1-2 hours. Rinse, drain and voila! If you haven't already, you've GOT to try this. Thanks SO much for sharing your mom's recipe, Lisa! I see myself making this often during the hot summer months. :-)

I've been searching for a good cucumber recipe and this one is ok.  The recipe doesn't call for refrigerating a few hours before serving, but I would recommend doing so to let the flavors come together.

LOVE IT!  And now for the changes...I was out of mayo so I used sour cream; salted, drained, quick rinse of the cucumber slices so I skipped the salt later on in the recipe.  I'll be making this a lot.

I scaled this down to 2 servings, as I was experimenting w/a variety of cuke salad recipes (I've never made it before and there are a TON of recipes out there...this was one of the 4 I selected).  Of the 4 cuke salad recipes I tried, this will be my go to when I want a creamy cuke salad!  I'm not a fan of mayo, so I subbed fat free sour cream and followed the rest of the recipe, other than omitting black pepper per personal preference.  This is really good!  I did add a bit more white vinegar to thin it out a little (and because I really like vinegar!).  I would definately make this again.  Thanks for a simple yummy recipe!

Out of all the cucumber salads I have made, this is the household favorite. It's not too sweet and does not have a heavy vinegar taste. Perfectly creamy and edible!

Excellent & so easy to make. Everyone at our picnic raved about the delicious cucunbers. I did take other reviewers suggestion and used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream.

Just the recipe I was looking for! I added some hakurei turnip which added a nice bite, as well as some sliced onion. I used Greek yogurt instead of mayo to cut WAY down on the fat and calories. I actually like it better this way...mayo just seems too heavy and greasy for crisp, juicy cucs. Awesome summer salad!!

This one's a keeper!  I did make some modifications to the dressing.  I only used about 1/2 cup of mayo and about 1 Tbsp. of apple cider vinegar for more flavor.  Used sea salt instead of regular and greatly reduced amount of sugar, down to like 1 tsp.  And I actually used Xylitol instead of white sugar as it is healthier for blood sugar and all natural.  Tossed in half a small red onion, sliced, and a handful of peas.  Let it 'marinate' all day and served with BBQ later that night.  It was scrumptious.  :-)  Will be making more often to take to work, thanks!

I really liked this - I'd never had a creamy cucumber salad before. I let my cukes drain for a bit, but not lvery ong, so there was a little extra water in the salad, but I didn't mind it - I like how it thinned out the mayo.

This was just the thing I was looking for!  I had a craving for some creamy good cucumber salad and this was just right.  It's easy to make and don't need any fancy ingredients (I left out the dill).  I also added some tomato.  Yum!

I'm rating this 5 stars AFTER my alterations. First: you MUST salt and let sit for at least one hour to allow for the liquid to drain off. Drain the liquid THEN add the sauce, otherwise its too runny. Second: For those of you like me who love garlic add about 2 medium sized cloves minced. Third: Add about 1 tblsp or even 2 of FRESH DILL! makes all the difference. And lastly: refrigerate 4 hours or overnight for the flavors to really meld! Enjoy alongside grilled chicken/steak and roasted potatoes, yummy!

I couldn't find a recipe exactly like I wanted, so I adjusted this one. I used half Mayo & half sour cream, & added a thinly sliced sweet onion. I also salted sliced cukes a couple hours & drained/rinsed before making. This is best if made at least a few hours before serving. Fresh dill is always best but dried worked ok in this.

My absolute FAVORITE  cucumber salad.  We eat this at least once a week during the summer months when cucumbers are plentiful from the garden.  I usually add some sliced onion, as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We liked it!  A little too much sugar and we should have salted the cucumbers first to avoid the liquid problem, but delicious.  Thanks!

This is just a wonderful, quick and easy recipe!  It is so delicious and makes using up all of the summertime cucumbers that much easier.  I used a little less mayo, and actually used Miracle Whip instead.  Yum!

I did reduce the sugar by about a teaspoon. My wife and I thought that it would make a great salad dressing as well. Thanks for the recipe

this was very good, I did as some others said and salted the cucumber and left them for half hour and then made the salad.  Everyone like it and it was a great way to use up the garden cucumbers

This recipe is just like the cucumber salad my grandmother used to make with a couple little alterations...I used a little less than half the sugar and cut the mayo down to 3/4 cup. I substituted fat free mayo for the regular mayonaise and used sea salt instead of the seasoned salt. The result is fantastic and the fat free mayo really tames down the fat content! I also chilled the cucumbers beforehand so that everything could be served immediately.

I'm not big on sweet dressings so I reduced the sugar to 1 Tb. and slightly increased the vinegar to make it a little tangier. All the cucumber lovers in the family really enjoyed this.

This flavor combination is awesome.  The melding of the sweet and tangy is incredible.    I did not expect this.  We loved this.  I will be making this often now.  Only had red wine vinegar on hand, but came out perfect.
THANKS LISA  :D

Made this for Easter dinner, was looking for some easy things I could do ahead of time. Made the night before so it could marinate. Opened it up to stir it the next morning and was suprised at the amount of liquid in the bowl. It definitely was alot more than when I first mixed it with the cucumbers. Didn't know if I did something wrong, but everyone said it was really good. Will make again, but don't know what I could do different other than not make it so far ahead.

This was a very good side dish. Quick and easy. I used fresh dill, because I didn't have any dry. And I used Mrs. Dash for the seasoning salt. My husband and I both liked this dish.

This recipe was very good!  I used three large and very long hothouse cucumbers.  I should have cut the dressing in half, because I ended up with way too much.  But the taste was delightful and I would definitely make this again!

Excellent!!! The only change I made was that I used apple cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar... just the best taste all around and I normally do not give 5-stars.  Not sure what the others were saying in that the salad was too watery as mine was perfect! :) Thank you for posting this!

I made this with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 non fat yogurt, cut down some of the sugar and added a bit more dill.  We served it with our Lamb Kabobs and honey potatoes and spring asperagus for Easter dinner, everyone thought it was an excellent addition.  I will serve this again. Great summer side dish.

I made this for my husband the other night and got the ultimate complement...he said it tasted just like the cucumber salad his mother makes. Score!!!! Thank you so much for this great recipe! The only thing that I changed was that I used lite MW (to save on calories) and added more dried dill weed.

The flavor of this cucumber salad was very good but thought it needed a tad more dill.  Perhaps that's just my taste though.  I followed the recipe exactly this first time around and after adding the cucumbers it made the dressing very runny so it didn't "stick" to the cucumbers very well.  Luckily, I saved half of the dressing (because I only cut 2 cucumbers for now) and when I use it I will take the advice of others and salt and drain the cucumbers first.  Then I think it will be perfect.

I made up a half-order and added a few sliced small onions.  Excellent !  One precaution: Go easy on the amount of mayo.  My salad was rather "liquidy".

Very good! Had company at the last minute, so added two small diced tomatoes, and some red onion just to increase the size. No leftovers here!

When I made this for lunch, I thought it had too much mayo. I let the rest sit for a good half hour and tried it again. It was much better after letting it rest. The liquid from the cucumbers waters down the dressing a bit and I much prefered that. Overall good taste but I will note the resting time for future salad making.

Very yummy PERFECT just as it is, so this is the perfect base if you want to tweak to your personal taste. I have been making this since I was a kid using either mayo, salad dressing or sour cream as a base. To it, I also add chopped tomato, sometimes onion or chives. I think it would work well for just about any fresh raw veggie. I can also see it being used a dip for carrots and celery too. VERY Tasty! Thanks!

Perfect!  This tastes exactly like my grandmother's recipe from years ago.  Other reviewers commented that the sauce was too sweet, so I started out with only half of the sugar.  However, I ended up adding the full quarter cup and thought that was just right!  I also followed the advice to sweat the cucumbers, which turned out to be excellent advice.  This was the first time I've made cucumbers where the cream sauce was still creamy two days later!  Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but may be a little too sweet.  I will use less sugar next time The recipe makes a lot of dressing.  I had halved it and used 1 1/2 very large cucumbers and had tons of dressing.  I added another 1 1/2 cucumbers and still could have added more cucumbers.

In lieu of altering the recipe I decided to give it a try as is. It turned out good, however, a change is warranted as suggested by other reviewers. Less mayonnaise and some added sour cream should do the trick. Otherwise, it had great taste and the texture wasn't bed either. Thanks for a great base recipe.

This was a hit at dinner tonight.  Was given some home grown cucumbers and wondered what I would do with so many.  I don't like dill so I used fresh cilantro instead.     I thought it was great  -- but then I love cilantro.  I also took others tips and added sliced onion and used cider vinegar.  I put half the dressing on my cucumbers and put in the frig for almost an hour.  It was then a bit watery. I used a slotted spoon to serve them and thus drain them a little.  Then used the dressing I had saved to drizzle a little over the salad.  

I think I will also try the dressing with the changes as a cole slaw dressing.

I thought this was pretty good.  I added onion which gave it a little kick.  I also pressed the cucumbers for about an hour before to reduce the moisture a bit.  This makes a lot of dressing.  I really like the dressing, but I may make only half of it the next time.  But that is just my personal taste.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Really needs the tomato for some added color.  other wise it was a really nice salad.  And it's best if you let it sit in the refridgerator for a couple of hours before serving.  I will make this again.

Very good! Agreed that you need to let the cucumbers drain prior to adding the dressing.  I sliced them, salted them and let them sit for an hour.

It was too sweet and a bit runny, but worth trying again with some modifications... cucumber, dill and mayo makes for a really good start! Looking forward to trying again with some of the suggestions.

Delicious! I also salted the slices and left them rest in the strainer for about an hour. Followed the recipe exactly and added some slices of sweet onion. I kept taking bites before placing in the fridge, it's so good. This is definitely a keeper!

Oh my gosh! Excellent recipe. I was afraid there wouldn't be any left for dinner because I couldn't stop tasting it. I did follow the suggestion and salted the cucumbers for about an hour, then drained and rinsed them, then patted dry with a paper towel. I forgot to slice the skin off and they were fine. I didn't have seasoned salt so I used Mrs. Dash's salt free seasoning instead. And I substituted splenda because I'm diabetic. The recipe was a huge success. I had just enough mayo for the two extra large English cucumbers I used. They probably equaled four regular. I've always made cucumber salad with just Italian dressing and this recipe is so much better. Thanks so much. I'll be making this often.

I thought this was allright. It does remind me of something my mom would make, reminiscent of the bean and mayo salads. I only had 1 English cucumber and made 2 servings. I didnt peel it because, it is not needed with this style of cucumber. Only change I made was cutting the dressing in half after changing the servings. It was plenty dressing for me.

I always add onion rings and sliced tomatoes.  As they are consumed, add more!  My grandmother always made it without mayo but just as good either way.

This is so easy and delicious, my family is not a fan of sour cream...so this works better for me.

Very good. I followed the advice of others and used apple cider vinegar, and used half mayo and half sour cream. I also added onions but it was good without them too

I salted and drained cukes before adding to the dressing. I use 1/2 sour cream and red wine vinegar. Forgot the dill.

I found this recipe a bit disappointing, but my husband loved it.  He doesn't like cucumber so I made his portion with tomatoes; maybe it tastes better that way!  Will make again and tweak it to my personal taste.

we substitute sour cream or Greek yoghurt for the mayo and it's terrific! Also we use vadalia onions, thinly sliced.

This was alright. I followed the directions to the T. It was a bit too sweet for what I am use to & the sauce/dressing was to thin. Thanks you for sharing  though.

I loved this recipe.  We really like our cucumber salad tart so I put 1/4 cup of vinegar in the recipe and cut the sugar down to 1/8 of a cup.  This would be good on salad as well.  I made this, served it with dinner and there were no leftovers.  Wonderful!!!

Very good recipe. I already had the cucumbers, thin sliced red onion and some minced garlic in a bowl when I found this...it didn't hurt the recipe at all! :) This is a keeper, good the following day too!

I took the advice that others offered, suggesting to add salt to the cucumbers so that some of the liquid would drain off. The cucumbers were perfect, not too much liquid at all! I didn't have any dill at home to add so I left it out...still great, but the dill would have made it perfect!

When my Mom makes this (minus the dill weed and salt) for Sunday Dinner my daugher (5) and Dad always fight over them.    A thing my Mom also does is add a splast of dill pickle juice to it as well.

I use a bit less mayo then called for, I also do the salt trick with the cucumbers, if I have time.
fresh, chopped dill is a must.

Yum! Exactly what creamy cucumber salad should taste like! Plus, chilling it for a couple of hours isn't necessary if your main ingredients are already cold. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

this is very good...I tried this twice, once with onions and once without.  I prefer them with the onions.  I also suggest using a little less sugar, it tends to be a little sweet.  Otherwise, it's very good and a keeper.

Very good but very rich.  Halved the recipe.  Used 1/2 real mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Made the rest as written.  Very few left over.  Can't wait to eat with my lunch at work tomorrow.

Very delicious way to eat cucumbers.  Both myself, my husband and our 4 year old loved them.  I think next time I'll cut back a tiny bit on the vinegar and mayo this makes a lot of sauce.

This was not good.  I followed it exactly as the recipe stated; there was way too much dressing for the amount of cucumbers in the salad.  I ended up having to drain some of the dressing to make it halfway decent.  I would not recommend this.

I gave this recipe a full 5 stars for it's versatility.  It's so easy and you can play with it and not go wrong (she says with great hope in her heart).  I did not have dill used green onions instead.  I'm sure I did not add a full cup of mayo...but played with the amount of ingredients and it STILL TURNED OUT GREAT.  Thank you very much for this easy and deliciously delightful recipe...will make again and again, maybe even with dill!

The flavor was good especially when it was just mixed but after sitting around for a little bit the juices from the cucumber leaked out and thinned the coating so it didn't really stick. Next time i'll probably do the salt thing to release some of the moisture from the cucumber and then toss OR just make sure to toss and serve immediately...I used plain yogurt in place of the mayo, if you are watching calories it takes the recipe from 237 to 61.5 a serving and tastes just as good :)

Wonderful summer salad that uses up all the cucumbers making their way out of the garden.  Light, fresh and easy.  I followed suggestions of others and salted/drained the cucumbers prior to dressing.  I also adjusted amounts to 1/2 cup mayo, 4 teaspoons sugar, used apple cider vinegar and added freshly ground pepper.

Very Good!  I am trying new recipes with all the cucumbers from my garden and this one is great! I followed it exactly although I did let the cucumbers sit & drain for awhile before adding them in with the other ingredients as suggested by another review.

Excellent cucumber salad. I did make 2 slight changes to the recipe. I doubled the dill and added thinly sliced vidalia onions.

Cucumbers were 6 for a dollar this morning at my produce stand then when I got them home I wondered what I was going to do with all of them before they went bad!  Searched and found this recipe. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was yummy.  I also used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream as others mentioned to lighten it up a little.  This recipe is delicious!  Thank you!

Too much mayo and too sweet for my taste, even doubling the vinegar. I would use less mayo & sugar if I were making this again.

This is very good.  I've been making my own version of this for years, except without the sugar.  Then the other day I decided my cucumbers were missing something.  I found this recipe and added a bit of sugar.  Perfect!  That was the missing ingredient.  It makes all the difference.  I include onions in this also.  I like the extra crunch.

Was looking for a cucumber salad recipe other than the normal vinegar based type.  This is it!! Deseeding them and soaking & setting helps with the texture.  Then drain well with paper towels.  Added 1/4 c. sweet white onion slices and halved the sugar as others stated. Using a good quality Mayo is a must!  Thanks for the recipe; it's definitely a keeper!!

Nothing fancy but wonderful flavor! I used 1/2 c mayonnaise and 1/2 c sour cream (rather than all mayonnaise) and I added onion slices. I do score the cucumbers with a fork, salt them, let them rest 30 minutes in a colander in the refrigerator before blotting them dry with paper towels. If we eat the cucumbers and onions out in a day, I just add more of those.

Brought this to a potluck cookout and it was well received - a little runny, but cucumbers tend to do that I guess.  I did "enhance" this recipe with the suggested modifications, which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.

This turned out really good, I had lots of compliments on it. I did put salt on them to let them dry out, but they still were very wet, so I took paper towels and laid them on top of the towel, then laid an additional towel on top of the cucumbers...the mayo still got runny'ish. However, I received quite a few compliments.  I did add some green onion. I also only had about 3/4 C of mayo left in the jar, and that was a really good amount. Note: If you taste the dressing BEFORE you mix it with the cucumbers/onion it tastes VERY sweet, but once mixed with the cucumbers/onions it balanced out.

This is so refreshing on a hot summer day.  I have an abundance of cucumbers in my garden and was looking for a good recipe and this is it!  I peeled them and then put them in the food processor (used the slicing blade)in order to get them really thin.  I used splenda in place of sugar and they were a tad sweet for me so I just added more dill and vinegar, but that can be alleviated by using less splenda next time.  I also used half sour cream and half mayo.  I think next time I may use all sour cream.

This is a very sweet recipe. I halved the recipe and only used 2 tablespoons of sugar, and I don't like it at all. But I'm more of a savory girl, and I knew I shouldn't have used that much sugar. I like the base of this recipe though, and next time I will use only maybe teaspoon of sugar. Oh! I also used sourcream. They're interchangeable, really, but I do prefer the salad with sourcream.

I love the dill! I also used this dressing (minus the dill) on cabbage and it was perfect. Slicing in half and taking some seeds out helped it not get too watery and still good the second day.

The dressing on this salad is really good, but a quarter cup of sugar would be a LOT.  I was adding it to taste and probably used two tablespoons or so.  I also used reduced-fat sour cream in place of half the mayo.  There's a lot of dressing, but, hey, it's wicked good on tortilla chips.  You won't see me complaining.

Just made this recipe. Wow was it good. I did add some tomato wedges cause of the hunger factor. I am considering adding some whole wheat pasta or sliced chicken to make it a meal. Thank you for a fantastic, perfect blend recipe. My tummy is so happy.

Yum!!!  I am so addicted to these with all of the free cucumbers people have been giving away, my mom used to make them too.  The hint about letting them sit salted then rinsing definitely worked well.  And I used splenda instead of sugar (and light mayo).  Delightful!

This was fabulous! I loved the sweet creamy dressing and the cucumber and dill flavors all went so well together. I didn't use any onion, but I can see how it might be a good addition (at least the powder). However, this was fantastic just as it is. I used light mayonnaise. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm, I loved this salad! Thanks so much for a keeper!

This was very good... I did make some modifications though.  I had a huge cucumber from my garden so I peeled it and sliced it thin. Then when I made the dressing I decreased the sugar by half and added 2 packets of splenda and equal. I used half mayo and half sour cream and omitted the seasoned salt. Also used red wine vinegar instead of regular white vinegar. Increased the dill, about twice as much and had to add another big TBSP of mayo and sour cream because it was a little sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and mix in the rest of the ingredients, then taste for sweetness (before adding any artificial sweeteners if I even need them.) I also added a little thinly sliced red onion from my garden. Later I dipped sliced garden tomatoes and raw zucchini in the extra dressing left behind in the bowl, yummy!

My mom got to try this recipe before I did, but it was really good. Perfect for all the cucumbers coming from the garden in the summer. It does get a little watery if you make it too far ahead, but overall a really good recipe.

This is a delicious recipe. I prepared it with the Apple Cider as some readers had said, but to add some color, I blanched some carrots for just a minute then sliced them and added to the salad. I also added thinly sliced onions. This is a perfect bbq side dish for the summer. Thank you.

I really really enjoyed this recipe.  I am a big cucumber fan and the dressing was just right. A little sweet taste to it. I served it with Sloppy Joes. Very good!

This dressing was really good ... I must admit I did use Apple cider vinegar, fresh dill and added a heaping
tablespoon of sour cream ... and used less sugar. I will make this again !

This cucumber salad is to die for! I have gotten so many people hooked on it, including my neighbors and grandmother. It is also a great creamy sauce just to make to put on mashed potatoes. 5 thumbs up!!! I also use English cucumbers instead; 1 English for every 2 regular cucumber it calls for. Usually only do this when I can find them on sale (got them for 1$ a piece today) :)

The cucumbers swam in dressing.  I'd definitely cut the dressing down to half, or even a third of the recipe amount if I were to make this again.

Yummy! Everybody wanted seconds!
I made a double batch - because our garden cukes are very prolific this summer.
I took advice from others about prepping the cucumbers: salt, chill one hour in colander; rinse; chill one hour in colander, then add dressing and chill.
I had a little leftover - so I drained the dressing to use in another batch, chilled the salad  - and it was delicious with lunch the next day.

This is still in the process of combining, but I am so impressed. I just LOVE cucumbers, in salads and in sandwiches to mention only two. I took a hint from ani her reviewer and lightly salted the sliced cucumbers and they are still in the fridge draining. From past experience, I know this is necessary to a salad that won’t be soup. I have just pre-made the dressing with the following changes (yup, had to do it)! I used 1/2 and 1/2 mayo and sour cream and I used white wine vinegar instead of plain white vinegar. Of course I had to see how that all tasted. YUM!! Can’t wait to combine everything and serve for dinner. I liked the idea of adding sliced sweet red onions, too. Next time. This is going to be in my summer rotation salad recipes. Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

I made this exactly to the tee using the measurements in this recipe and even sweat the cucumbers with salt as others had recommended in a colander, but it was still too much “dressing” in the end. I probably would have added 2-3 more cucumbers with the same liquid measurements and increased the dill and they would have been fine. Otherwise tastes great.

Perfect!  Love this for a side dish in the summer.

We add a sliced onion, and on occasion, tomato slices.

Maybe I did something wrong. I let the cucumbers sit in a colander after sprinkling them with salt for about an hour, but the salad still is quite soupy. Also could use more seasoning.

My husband made this and it turned out great. We used homegrown cucumbers which I think is far better then store bought ones. Very easy and tasty.

I just didn’t like it all that much. Cukes  with a splash of rice vinegar and a dusting of salt, then chilled, is faster and more a match to my personal taste

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Every time, making more and more. Now I am tripling it!  It's a great side salad for these 100+ degree days we are having right now. My mom used to make a cucumber and onion dish for my dad, but did not use mayo. I like this creamy version better!

This was very delicious. We split the mayo with sour cream as others suggested (just because I don't like mayo to be overbearing). I added tomato chunks and diced sweet onion. I don't mind that the sauce was a little runny. We usually leave it in the fridge overnight but, I ate this fresh and loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my BF as he was seeking his favorite cucumber recipe from childhood. This was not the one he remembered so I felt disappointed until he tried it. He said this was the best thing I have ever made and he wants this one to be the cucumber salad recipe we keep.
I swapped the mayo for soy free vegenaise since that is what I had, and added some fresh red onion from the garden. AMAZING!

I stayed true to the recipe and had a little too much water.  Found another review suggesting salting the cucumbers and draining for 15 minutes.  I'll try that to see if water content is reduced.  I'm single cooking once weekly and just finished off the first recipe 6 days later.  Tasted just as good as the first serving.  Thanks to Mom and to you for sharing her recipe.

Hubby loves this.  I did let the cukes sit to drain their excess water.  It becomes watery after a day or so, I just add more cucumbers.

I make a salad quite similar to this -so I combined mine and this one and it was a winner-I used-6-8 large cucumbers-peeled-thinly sliced-salted and put in a colander in a large pan and covered it for an hour-then I gently pressed the excess water out-I added a 1/2 cup HV ranch dressing-and used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup of vinegar-and instead of seasoned salt-I used garlic powder-onion powder -and 1tbsp of dried parsley-after it sits overnight -I think the taste is so much better.I also did not rinse the cukes and onions-I simply left the salt out of the recipe

Followed the direction as well as the recommendation to put them in the frig for an hour. Salted. Turned out great. A must with fresh cucumbers from the garden.

I made the dressing in a bowl and added what I thought to the cucumbers I had chopped.  I added less sugar but I wish I had added all of it.

Made the dressing exactly as written ,with the addition of a sprinkle of black pepper, and cut in half. I used four small cucumbers, some cherry tomatoes and about half of a small white onion diced. And it was wonderful! I will be making this many more times. Thank you for the recipe!

I will most certainly  make this again, but of course I will have to do the salt/draining thing.  Even with it being a bit watery, this was so good!  I used fake sugar and fresh dill and I did add a bit of chopped red onion.

This is the first time I made cucumber salad with mayonaise dressing.  I have to say that I prefer the same base recipe with sour cream.  I was out of sour cream, so I tried this with mayo and I much prefer balance between the fresh tartness of mayo with lemon juice and sugar.

I too salted and chilled my cucumber to get some water out.  I also used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo and used rice vinager instead  of white.   I added red onion. So delicious!   This recipe was sweet, but my family loves sweet and salty so it was perfect for us. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the directions exactly (for 2 servings) but when I tasted the mayo mixture it was too sweet for our tastes.  I ended up starting over and using about a quarter of the recommended sugar and it came out great! I added some red onion too. I do think the sauce would work great with broccoli slaw or maybe as a Cole slaw cream too.  Thanks for sharing!

Salting them ahead is a great idea so you can pour off the liquid the cukes make,  then after their drained, add your dressing.  I like my cukes sliced much thinner.  Add a little Tabasco sauce for a livened up flavor.

My grandma first taught me this recipe. She always sliced a sweet onion into this as well. If you have left over "sauce", make sure all of the cucumbers are out and save just juice and any onions until next day.  Can add a fresh cucumber the second day and the juice has extra flavour thanks to the onions. (Sauce is also great on boiled potatoes)

I have made it  2x now and love it!  I do salt the cukes and let them sit several hours to overnight, drain and then make the dressing, i added less seasoned salt due to the already salty taste, black ground pepper, a little garlic, and only 1 Tablespoon of sugar and a bit more vinegar.  I am a vinegar person. It's so good!  tyvm for the recipe!

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo as we are a miracle whip family, I also added about 2 tbsp of milk as I wanted it to go a little further as I did use larger cucumbers as well as a large onion.  I didn't have any seasoning salt so I used some sea salt, a little thyme, a tsp of celery flakes and mixed it all together and refrigerated for about an hour.  I did not include dill as I didn't have any, and I don't like dill anyway.  My husband said it was wonderful, he prefers the sweet salads so this was perfect for him.

I made this for a party at the pottery studio. Those who tried it liked it and asked for the recipe. What I do recommend is making it the night before to allow the flavors to brighten.

I didn't measure the sauce ingredients. Just made to taste. Used fresh dill. Next time I would add thinly sliced onion.

This was good but I ended up with too much dressing.  I salted and iced the slices for an hour before to remove as much water from the cucumbers before mixing the salad.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I cut back on the mayo a little bit because I don't like my salad too saucy, and adding some thinly sliced onions is a must. Other than those two little preferences, great recipe!

It was OK, I think it was too sweet and it got a bit watery after about an hour. I will probably not make it again.

I added half the sugar based on some reviews I saw, as well as some fresh dill from my garden (in addition to the dried), and this salad was great--very tasty. It did tend to get a little soupy as the evening wore on, as liquid escaped the cucumbers, so I would try the cukes in salt tip (before adding the dressing) next time. But this time I had so many cucumbers from my garden, I just added more of them to the bowl to take advantage of the extra dressing that was left over at the end.

I didn't add the dill weed and halved the sugar, but this was still so delicious!! I made this about 1 hour before eating it and had no issues with the sauce getting watered down. Again, so delicious!!

This recipe reminds me of something my mom used to make, I did cut the sugar in half because our family doesn't care for sweet dressings, but other than that the recipe was perfect, will definitely use this one against.

Yummy, but little too sweet. On the next try, we might add more dill and a squirt of lemon or lime.

I made this quite a lot last summer and the entire family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly as given and the only thing I now do differently is to let the sliced cucumber drain for a while first to cut down on the liquid. If the cucumbers are large I will remove the seeds, which also cuts down on the juice. When time is short I often just add extra cucumber slices to improve the liquid to cucumber ratio.  I also now add very thinly sliced red onion for a punch of color and a nice flavor contrast.  My garden is bursting with cucumbers right now and this wonderful salad is in our fridge every day!

So so so so so GOOD!   My friend added more seasoning salt, not much.  Just a little.  Even without more of the seasoning salt, it was still good.  I don't like cucumbers at all, but I liked this recipe so much I will definitely make it again and again.  Slightly more watery than I had envisioned, but I just drank the juice lol.

So tasty!  I agree with the other reviewers about too much mayo and the liquid settling out.  I will try the salt trick next time I make this and I will half the ingredients for the dressing while still using the same amount of cukes but it tasted great!  a lovely light, sweet side dish for the summer!

This was excellent!  I did the suggestions of others, such as salted the cucumbers and let them sit in a colander for an hour to get the water out of the cucumbers.  I also did the suggestion of 1/2 c. of mayonnaise and 1/2 c. of sour cream.   I did add a sweet onion, chopped loosely just because that is how my mom used to make it as well.  LISAPAV thank you so much for the recipe!!

Yum! Next time I'll use less mayo and sugar, and more seasoned salt. I think this dish is best made right before you serve it rather than mixing it ahead of time- although maybe you could mix together mayo, salt and dill to let the flavors meld.

This is the perfect, old fashioned, creamy cucumber recipe.  I have made this several times now and I think its very yummy!  I make it with apple cider vinegar, sea salt rather than seasoned salt and add some black pepper to taste.

Great flavors.  It was too sweet for us, but I tried it again with half the sugar and it was perfect.  My cucumbers were on the small side so the full recipe was quite a bit too much but everyone really liked the taste!

Really positive comments whenever I serve this. As others have mentioned, I also salt my sliced cukes for an hour or so  & then rinse & drain before adding the dressing. Substituted greek yogurt for half the mayo , left out the salt, & used both fresh & dried dill weed.

I couldn't give this recipe anything less that a 5 star! It doesn't have a strong mayo flavor that has always turned me away from cucumber salad. saladI love dill so I added a little extra. I'm going to use this dressing on my salad too.

I have made many wonderful meals from the recipes on this site and have never felt the urge to write a review as this one. This recipe is fast and easy with ingredients you most likely have on hand and delicious!  My husband raved about it and said he could eat a full bowl of just this salad alone.  I am not a big fan of mayo and often reduce it or substitute it so I wasn't sure about this...the dill gives it a light and refreshing taste.  I plan on taking this to the next planned family BBQ coming up.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will probably be in our family for many years to come as well!

Excellent even without the dill. Used Cavenders seasoned salt and did the trick from another reviewer with the salt letting some of the liquid drain before mixing with dressing. Bottom line its going to be soupy but I think that is the norm for a salad like this. Was DELISH.

This turned out wonderful. Followed to the T almost. I just let the cucumbers sit in the fridge with salt on them for about one hour to remove some of the H2O prior to adding the dressing mix and added some fresh onion too. Wow I could eat the entire batch. Thanks for sharing.

Shockingly sweet!  It's a great salad with red onion and garlic added.  But, if you make with the recommended 1/4 cup sugar, it will overtake everything else.  I used 1/8 cup sugar, and that was still plenty.  I did salt and rinse the  cucumbers to extract the liquid, so the salad had a nice rich texture, and I also used half mayo and half sour cream.  I will make this one again with these revisions

We just smoked six racks of baby backs and two shoulders and I wanted a cool tasty side dish that wasn't just potato salad or Mac salad and this hit the spot. Very cool crisp and flavorful, and super simple. It was only my husband and me so I cut the recipe in half. PERFECT side dish!!! Thank you!!!

This was really good!  We enjoyed it with a spicy meal to cool our tongues and it was great!  Didn't change a thing other than letting the cucumbers sit in a strainer with some salt to get rid of the water that seeps out of the cucumbers.

Let me suggest another option to this delicious recipe, you can change the mayo and use yoghurt instead. I'd also suggest a slightly sweet type and leave out the sugar too. Dieting? Use fat & sugar free yoghurt. Yummy!!!

Thank you for this great recipe. I tried your recipe exactly as printed and it is great.  I also tried it with the cukes sliced paper thin and it was also great. I added paper thin sliced Vidalia onions.  Everyone who has tasted any variation of your recipe has loved it.  Thanx again!!!!

The dressing is really good, but kind of overpowering, I couldnt eat alot of it thats for sure, I think the dressing would be better suited as a dip for sweet potato fries!  I followed the recipie exactly except i did not peel my cucumber as i like the peel

Sorry, just not to our tastes.  We love cukes and always have a ton in the house so we thought we'd try some new recipes.  My husband and I felt this was overly sweet, and there was a lot of leftover sauce that wasn't used.  We used Lawry's for the seasoned salt but I think it gave it a funny flavor.  We did add red onions per another review and those seemed to help the flavor, but it was still just too sweet for our tastes.

I loved this recipe, some how I forgot the mayonnaise while making this recipe and didn't miss the taste at all. I have made it 3X since then and still don't use mayo, and I cut the cukes down to 1 large since I eliminated the mayo. I didn't use salt to leach out the water either and it turned out fine.

Terrific recipe for that overabundance of cucumbers in your late summer garden. I used a combination of 1/3 sour cream, 2/3 Mayo. I kept the sugar amount. The salad was great. Finally, I've tried the salt trick several times, and I find it takes away from the crispness. Lettng the cukes rest in the fridge for 4-6 hours seems to work bet to remove some of the water.

It was ok, I might try it again.  I think there was too much sauce, which overpowered to the cucumber flavor.  If I make it again, I will cut the sauce down or use a lot more than the recommended cucumbers!

Salting and draining worked for me. Also used fatfree mayo and Splenda instead of sugar. Added a little onion just because I like it. Stayed creamy in fridge for a day. That is all it lasted.

Not my favorite - and I'm not sure what I'd do to change...  the cukes get very soggy, even with the salt trick. The flavor is great, though.

way, way, way too sweet.  I even doubled the dill & still all I could taste was the sugar.  Next time I will halve the sugar, although it may need even less than that.

My friends family makes cucumber salad for all their gathering and I LOVE it so I picked this recipe thinking it would be like it, it was close but there was something different that they do, but not sure what it is. I did half mayo half sour cream. Great way to use up extra cucumbers. Thank you......

Excellent, as is.  Better with the cucumbers peeled (a lot of the pictures have the cumcumber peel on).  This is the best recipe I have ever tasted with cucumbers involved.

Used 3/4 cup of miracle whip and only had 3 cucumbers, so that was too much.  Peeled, sliced and place the cukes in a colander over the sink and sprinkled with salt.  Let sit for about 30 minutes, then made the dressing with 3 packets of stevia instead of sugar and apple cider vinegar instead of white. Did not measure the dill or seasoned salt.  Blotted the cukes with paper towels before adding to the dressing.  Pretty good stuff.

I used previous reviewer's tip to salt and drain sliced cucumbers.  I used lowfat mayo and splenda/sugar blend for the sugar.  I also upped the dill to 1 T and used 1/4 cup of vinegar.  SOOOOO good!

This is really, really good.  It's a lot like one my mom used to make years ago-- though this one seems to have a 'brighter' flavor-- which I like :)  I used a previous reviewer's tip to salt and drain the sliced cukes before adding the dressing-- what a great tip!  (In fact, I let my cukes drain overnight, since I was just making this for myself-- and I got tons of extra moisture out.)  This is one for my 'go-to' recipe list-- thanks for posting it!!!

very similar to what my mom has been making for years.  I gave 4 stars because as written, this is very tangy.  I just made it, but left out the dill, because it would have been too strong and added 1 1/2 t sugar.  I also used 1/2 sour cream, 1/4 miracle whip, and 1/4 mayo.  But sooo good and refreshing this time of year.

This was a nice change from the usual cucumber salad. I like the creamy dressing. I would definitely sweat the cukes before mixing this up. It ended up being a little more runny because I didn't do that. And I added in about half a red onion, chopped. The flavor was delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I have tried several recipes like this and haven't found the perfect one until now.  I love the dill, just the right amount.  Next time I am going to add some onion as well.  Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe.

I liked this, but I too added some sour cream and then I added a little salt because it was too sweet for my tastes.  My 3 children did not like them however.

Great!  I will use this again especially when my cucumbers in the garden get too big. I seeded, salted and let drain before adding the dressing and they were still edible the next day.

I realy liked this. A good blend of flavors. Make sure to leach the cukes. I used 1/2 sour cream for 1/2 the mayo. Makes alot of dressing for the amt. of cukes.

I made these with dinner tonight and they were great!  The sweetness was a nice balance with our meal.  I didn't have any dill, but it was still great without it.  Thanks!!

Really good.  Hubby hates mayo so used miracle whip instead.  Makes it nice and sweet.  He doesn't normally like cucs, but loves this recipe.

I made this as is, and it was good.  Next time I will use less dressing, and maybe try some sour cream in place of some of the mayo.  

Onions would be a great addition too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe and reminded me of a salad that my grandmother used to make. I added 2 chopped tomatoes to the salad and did not change the amount of dressing--it was amazing! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good!  My family doesn't usually choose to eat cucumbers, but we had some from a friend's garden.  This recipe had my entire family (even the children) asking for more!

I took others advice and also added half a cup of lite mayo and half a cup of lite sour cream.  I only added 1 tbsp. of sugar as we thought it was sweet enough and then added the dill, salt & vinegar to taste per our preferance.  Thanks

I have made the mayo, sour cream and dill cucumbers, including the salt water soaking, many times. I wanted to try this one though because I had a bunch of cucumbers that had gotten a little sunburned on the vine and that tends to make them slightly bitter. The sugar appealed to me in this recipe, perhaps, to disguise this. I also had no onions and this recipe actually didn’t call for any. Besides, hubby only tolerates the other creamy cucumbers I make, and I thought he might warm up more to the sweet sauce. These were good, I made them with cider vinegar (never have used any vinegar before). I may make this again but I would like to try it with onions next time. Hubby ate these cucumbers but didn’t comment on whether they were any better or worse than they ones I usually make. Maybe he just isn’t a cucumber fan.

Pretty good recipe.  It is a SWEET salad, not the "typical" mayo/sour cream dressing I am used to on cucumber salad, but good none the less!  I also used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo which worked very well.

I really didn't like this recipe.  I found it way to sweet.  I ended up scrapping the dressing and starting over without any sugar at all.

I made this for my husband. He wanted me to make a vinegar and oil type recipe his mom used to make, but this is the only recipe I could find. He absolutely loved it. He told me to forget his mom's recipe and use this one for now on. I have never liked vinegar and oil cucumbers, but I loved this! (I did add onion slices)

Good taste and a nice change from my usual cucumber salad.
