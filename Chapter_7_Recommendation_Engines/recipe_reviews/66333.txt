This one I will make again and again. The only thing I will do different the next time is to add half a layer of cheese between the meat and rice mixture in the casserole dish. Good tasting dish.

I took the advice of several folks and added extra soy sauce (upped to 3 tbsp.) so the recipe didn't get too dry, however, I found that the fresh mushrooms I used probably would have compensated enough and it was a bit "juicy". I didn't mind, as the extra flavor from the soy sauce was wonderful. I upped the seasoning (curry) to 2 tsp. but that really was a bit too much. The curry overpowered many of the other flavors. I will use 1 1/2 tsp next time and that should be just right. Also, I used sharp cheddar (my preference in cheese). I found that the cheese really brought the flavors together and was necessary in each bite - it really made teh flavors "pop". I did add some to the mixture, but not nearly enough. I will likely use the 2 c. called for in the mixture next time and only a light sprinkle on the top of a little extra (maybe 1 c., if that much). I will cook the wild rice for an hour on the stovetop next time, as mine was a little chewy, even after baking (the wild rice I use - directions say cook for 1 hour). Over all, this is a very filling meal - good comfort food for fall/winter. Will definitely make again! Yum!

Wonderful.  I layered the cheese as someone suggested; used some peas instead of water chestnuts (did have any on hand).  Will make this again--tomorrow night with the water chestnuts.  This is one of those recipes you can 'tweak' anyway you like!

Really good.  I was a little apprehensive about the cheddar-curry combo but it worked really well.  Other than adding a 1/2 tsp corriander and I used turkey instead of beef, I followed the recipe exactly.  It did leave little buttery pools on the plates.  A whole stick of butter is really a lot but I think it was an imperative part of the flavor.  Perhaps the fat/flavor could come from something a bit more solid...  maybe mayo.  I may give that a try.  But I would make this again as is.  ADDENDUM: Since this review I have made this several times.  My fourteen-month-old LOVES this!!  We can't keep her bowl full!!  My parents and my in-laws (completely opposite tastes) all love it!!

Absolutely excellent!! Every time I make it, it disapears. You could add bacon if wanted. Heck, who doesn't like bacon. Be creative. The curry powder is a must though. It really give a unique flavor, so don't ever thing of leaving that out. It would not be the same. Donna-Minnesota.

I followed this recipe with only a few minor alterations: fresh mushrooms and, since I didn't have water chestnuts, I threw in a cup of corn. It was mildly flavoured. Next time I would use a bit less butter. I will make this again as even my husband, who only likes white rice, went for seconds.

I was skeptical of the curry and cheese combination, as many other reviewers mentioned. But they insisted that it was great and should be tried. I really should have gone with my gut on this one--one bite of this was one bite too much. I do like the idea of a casserole that combines beef with wild rice and brown rice, but the flavoring was way off. You gotta think there's a reason that curries topped with cheddar cheese have not taken off in fusion restaurants across the nation.

YUMMY!  We just loved this and we gobbled up all the leftovers - in fact, I'm surprised there weren't any fights!  I did make this w/ ground turkey instead of ground beef, fresh mushrooms and I added a bit extra spice and soy.  Awesome - thanks!!!

This is a good weeknight meal; it's so quick and easy to prepare.  I used leftover cooked wild rice and it worked fine.  I don't care for curry, so didn't use it.  I didn't have mushrooms so used peas instead; also added minced fresh garlic and a touch of ground ginger and a can of sliced bamboo shoots.  I'm glad I did as others suggested and added a layer of cheese in the middle of the beef mixture and used a few more Tablespoons of soy.  Thanks for a quick and easy base recipe I will use again.

I could not bring myself to put cheese on this...  it just doesn't seem right.  Soy sauce with cheddar and curry?!  A whole stick of butter?  What is going on in this recipe?  Too many odd flavors, rice doesn't get fully cooked with only 3 cups broth.  Was also too greasy (even with halving the butter called for).

We weren't expecting this to be anything special, but we were pleasantly surprised! My husband and I both enjoyed this and it was very simple and tasty. We substituted 8 oz of fresh whole mushrooms cubed (not chopped) instead of the water chestnuts and canned mushrooms and cooked them with the ground beef. The cheese is instrumental - don't leave it out. My husband doesn't like curry normally, but he really liked this casserole!

Good flavor combination. Like others have noted, the curry and cheese seemed a little odd at first read, especially with soy sauce, but it works. I followed the ingrdients pretty closely, except that I added garlic (ALWAYS!) and used frozen peas instead of the water chestnuts (didn't have any on hand). But instead of creating a third pot/pan to clean, I used a deep skillet for the ground beef, added the rice in there and mixed with about 1/3 the cheese, then sprinkled the rest of the cheese over the top and let it simmer for about 20 minutes on the stove. I didn't get the browning effect, but the mixture was nice and bubbly.

And really, to those who cried "bland" at this... maybe you should follow standard cooking practice and tatse as you go. One person's bland is someone else's spicy!

Turned out fabulous and all loved it.  Had to change up a bit due to time schedule.  Did not boil the rices, etc-  The night before I mixed the rices and broth together, browned the onion, celery and beef and mixed the whole thing together with seasonings also  mixed in the 2 cups cheddar cheese instead of putting on top.  Put in baking dish, covered with aluminum foil and into the refrigerator. Cooked it the following morning for 2 hrs. at 350, then put 1 cup cheddar cheese on top to melt when done. - turned out great.  Recipe changes:  used celery instead of mushroom and w. chestnuts; used 2 Tablespoon of soy sauce; and 1/2 tsp curry powder - based on other's reviews.  Thanks for the ideas.

This is a good filling recipe but it is just a bit dry. I used an extra cup of chicken broth for the rice and added a can of cream of celery soup and a can of water. That helped the dryness but the ingredients still needed something to tie them all together. I solved the problem temporarily with ketchup, something my neice strongly approves of:)

Made this last night.  Did not have waterchestnuts or mushrooms so added cream of mushroom soup and corn.  It was a huge hit with my kids (and me!).  The curry powder and soy sauce are an excellent combination and tastes even better the next day.  Definitely a keeper!

I followed the directions pretty closely. I just used 2 cups of a wild rice blend  (that had brown rice in it), fresh mushrooms, and no water chesnuts. All the flavors blend well together, it fills you up, and it makes a big batch! Will be making this one again- thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe. My 5 and 7 year olds asked for 2nd and 3rd helpings.  I only changed a few things.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I used a can of corn instead of water chestnuts.  I will be making this again in the near future.

This recipes was so easy but I didn't have a lot of time so I used some shortcuts and ingredients on hand.  I used minute brown rice and cooked with the bay leaves and chicken broth per the box instructions.  I used olive oil to cook the onions instead of butter and added garlic and onion powder when cooking the meat.  Instead of waterchestnuts and mushrooms I threw in some frozen bell peppers and mixed veggies.  Also folded the cheese into the entire mixture reserving a small amount to sprinkle on top.  Make sure and taste the mixture before putting it in the oven so you can add spices to your taste.  I added a lot more curry and some cayene for a kick.

I used a bag of 90 second brown and wild rice to save myself a ton of time, and skipped the water chestnuts since we don't like them.  I layered the beef and cheese, as per other reviewer's suggestions.  This was easy but a bit bland.  I think I may try adding some diced tomatoes to the beef mixture next time.

This had a really good flavor, but came out a bit dry.  Next time, I'll add a can of cream of mushroom soup or mushroom gravy to it and I think it would be perfect.

This recipe is awesome.  My whole family actually ate it and clamored for seconds and thirds.  I don't care for mushroom so I substituted with toasted almonds. I also sub'd olive oil for butter.  It rocks.

This was surprisingly good. I amped up the flavor by using more curry, mushroom soy sauce, sharp white cheddar, and some really flavorful shitake mushrooms. Wasn't sure it would turn out great, but wow. Great unique& delicious recipe

Delish! I doubled the curry, added 1tsp cumin, 1/2tsp ginger, 1/2tsp blk pepper & 1/4tsp red pepper flakes. This made the meal very pungent. Next time I plan to add celery flakes or dried celery. My husband loved it so much he went back for 3rds!

Trying to eat healthy, so no way was I going to add a whole stick of butter. Plus you get saturated fat from the beef, Plus you get saturated fat from the cheese. Why would I even make this LOL? I used 2 TBS of butter and a smidge of olive oil. Added green and red bell peppers with the onion, and frozen corn for color, flavor and nutrients. I only had 1/2 cup of wild rice, so I increased the brown to make up for it. Worked fine. Used a lean hamburger (93%). Other reviewers complained of dryness, but I did not have that problem at all. I found it very rich, in fact next time I won't use any butter and I'll drain the meat. My mouth still feels greasy. My rice was completely tender before mixing with the beef and baking, so maybe that also is what makes a difference in dryness? I also followed the suggestion of adding some of the cheese in a layer in the middle. Only 3 stars because the seasonings were way too mild. I had to add quite a bit more soy (actually I used low sodium tamari) and curry and added black pepper. Garlic would be good too but I was having a garlicky side dish of broccoli rabe. All in all I am happy with it after my tweaking and keeping this one. This makes a huge amount, I hope it freezes okay! EDIT:  I lowered to two stars because I did not care for it the next day.  Will not be keeping this one after all. Sorry, but thanks for the idea!

My husband is a picky eater and he loved this dish. I added cheese in between layers of beef and rice mixture. Next time I will add more soy sauce and curry as others suggested. The flavors were a little too subtle for me. I will keep this one in my box!

I thought this dish was OK, my family did not care for it at all. Needed more flavor and probably a can of cream soup.

This was definitely too dry. I had to add 1/2 c. RF mayo and 1/2 c. RF sour cream before baking it. I loved the flavor with the curry though, and I will make it again with the above modifications.

This is a very good casserole with an unusual combination of flavors that ended up  smelling and tasting wonderful.  We made a few changes (who doesn't on Allrecipes?).  We used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I don't like water chestnuts, so we added corn, as someone else mentioned.  We cut way back on the cheese, only one cup. I only used one tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil, way too much butter originally.  Gotta watch those fat calories....  In the end I really liked it, and I never liked wild rice before.  My husband liked it also.  My 6 year old liked it before my 9 year old made her negative opinion known. So a pretty good winner overall.

This one is a keeper!  I have eight VERY picky kids and every one of them cleaned their plates-a recipe with curry no less!  I too used the sharp cheddar cheese but other than that stayed true to the recipe.  Wonderful.

I was reading the past comments and I have incorporated on what the comments have said.  I used 2 cans of the Chicken Both and the rice used (I cannot remember what I use but I will come back to this.) I brown the turkey meat with the Onions. (I skipped a step with the butter)  When it was time added fresh mushrooms, 1 can of Peas, 2 cups frozen Corn, Water Chestnuts (per recipe).  My husband and In-Laws LOVED IT!!!!

I really liked this recipe but didn't love it. It did come out a little dry. My family isn't big on water chesnuts or mushrooms so I omited these and added in corn. Overall it was pretty good.

This was very good.  I used sharp cheddar cheese which gave it a nice tang.  Next time I will mix some of the cheese into the rice/meat mixture for a more even flavor.  We added a bit of hot sauce as well.

I have to agree w other reviewers, the combination of ingredients doesn't sound good, but we really liked it!  I did use fresh baby Bella mushrooms and all wild rice.  I will cut the butter  in half next time.  Will definitely make again.

I will definitely make this again! It has a very unique flavor and looks impressive as well.  I will try using another cup of chicken broth next time as the liquid was completely absorbed before the wild rice was done.  I used a can of corn, drained, and a 10 oz box of frozen peas. I did not have any water chestnuts. I placed half of the wild rice mixture in the 9x13 pan and layered 1 1/2 cups cheese and repeated those layers once more.  I added a little garlic powder and pepper to mine and it was perfect!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This actually had a really good flavor. Next time I will definitely take out the water chestnut and add mixed veggies or something for color. Will also up the curry for a bigger punch of flavor.

Make this all the time but modify it to fit our families tastes; celery, more soy and sauteed fresh mushrooms. Something to note, all recipes that involve curry should be sauteed together with the onion to bring out the flavor. Lastly, I add cheese in the casserole and then top the casserole with cheese. Yum!

I made this with a couple of substitutions.  Wild rice is so expensive and I already had two boxes of the Uncle Ben's Long-grain and Wild Rice, so I used them.  Although I used both boxes of rice! I used only one of the seasoning packets.  This shortens the time needed, as the rice cooks in about the same time it takes to sauté the onion and brown the beef.  Wifey and I both liked it enough to go back for seconds, but agreed that it could stand a few tweaks.  Next time, I will sub 2 Tbs teriyaki for the soy sauce and add a couple of ribs of celery diced.  The jury is still out on whether it could benefit from 2 cloves of minced garlic.

This is a very good recipe with a few minor adjustments. Do not add the butter unless you like very greasy food. If you do use the butter to sautee the onions, make sure you drain the fat from the ground beef and onion mixture completly. Otherwise, you will have a very greasy hotdish. Also, I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added extra soy sauce and curry powder. I added 4 tbsp. of soy sauce and 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of curry powder. I also took the recommendation of adding a layer of cheese in the middle. As weird as some of these ingredients sound together (curry, soy sauce, chedder cheese) it really is a tasty recipe. My husband can't stop eating it!

Fantasic recipe! Full of flavor and healthy! I usually add a teaspoon more of curry powder, omit the water chestnuts (don't keep on hand) and less cheese. I cook both my rices together in a rice cooker with the broth and bay leaves. Makes easy clean up. Try this, you'll love the flavor with the curry and soy together, great combo!

We were not a fan of this one.  It came out on the dry side and we didn't care for the cheese sprinkled over the top of the rice.  This was also rather bland.
