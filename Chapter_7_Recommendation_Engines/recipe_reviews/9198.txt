The BEST mashed potatoes ever! I've never baked them, per the final step - just mash them and put them on the table, where they are immediately eaten by my family.   These have become the standard for our family dinners.

I made with sweet potatos instead of yams and it was still very good.  Use fresh rosemary, it makes quite a difference.  I thought it had a very good overall taste, but if you like a strong garlic flavor use more.  My guests thought it needed a little more salt, but that may be because I used very little salt in cooking.

Thank you for this recipe. My husband and I loved it. I did not have time to bake it, so I just served eliminated that step. To suit my taste, I added a pinch of allspice and nutmeg and topped the mound of potatoes with a sprinkle of brown sugar. Exquisite with lamb and asparagus and a nice red wine.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner...It turned out well and was a nice change from regular mashed potatoes.  I sauted minced garlic with olive oil instead of using whole garlic cloves.  I only used about a 1/4 cup of the reserved liquid from boiling the potatoes.  It was plenty creamy without putting in any more of the liquid.

I found this recipe a few years ago and made it for Thanksgiving.  I wanted something different than the traditional mashed potatoes. I LOVED IT!  I made it the following year and on other occasions as well.  My guests enjoyed it as well.

The dried rosemary gave it a texture that I didn't care for.  Maybe it'll be better with fresh rosemary.

Made it for a catered affair of 32 people, absolutely no leftovers.  Kept it hot in a large crockpot and served it with "Tangy Honey Glazed Ham" from this site and green beans.  Thanks a lot for sharing!

Very different yet very delicious. It is not that hard to make and it can be prepared the night before and then cooked the day of the event. It tastes wonderful with the rosemary adding a great kick. I am a fan of lots of cheese so the extra made it wonderful for my friends and I.

Turned out good and the family liked it too.  I recommend a bit more garlic and a little garlic salt mixed in before baking.. Although it takes some time to make these, the prep is pretty easy!  Made a good side dish at our Thanksgiving dinner tonight!!

Oh my these are good! I just made them up through the point where they go in the oven. Now I'll freeze them and heat them on Thursday. I had a bowlful first and will have to exercise self discipline not to eat more. As another reviewer said, they don't really have to be baked - but that step does make them easy to make ahead.  

The only change I made to the recipe was because I didn't have whole garlic but had the stuff in the jar. I took about 1/4 cup of that, drained it good and then browned it in olive oil and tossed that, olive oil and garlic, into the mashed potato mixture. I also added a little more rosemary than the recipe called for, probably more than a teaspoon.

This recipe is a keeper.

Delish!!  Anyone out there that has a little ceramic  dish can roast the garlic in the microwave if pressed for time.  Drizzle a little olive oil & heat for 1 minute -- you'll be amazed at how little time it takes!

This recipe is fantastic!  I smashed an entire head of garlic cloves, put them in a Pyrex custard bowl, and generously drizzled olive oil on top so that there wasn't a dry spot, but they weren't drowning, either.  Fresh rosemary is the key to this not being "spiky" when you eat it, or if you only have dry, you can roast it with the garlic (make sure to stir it around so that it's thoroughly coated) so that it infuses into the olive oil, and softens/plumps up a bit.  Grated parmesan works in the bottle works, but if you can find finely shredded, you get those cheesy stings that are oh-so-good!

Great recipe: we changed it a little to 2 lbs of potatoes and 1 lb of sweet potato just out of personal preference.  The roasted garlic and the hint of rosemary gave this dish a really sophisticated flavour without being too whacky for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is pretty good and shows a lot of potential.  I found the leftovers to be tastier, probably b/c the potatos had a day to absorb the garlic taste.  I also melted extra stretchy cheese on top of them when I microwaved them.  Excellent.  I think for the future,  I would add a lot more delicious roasted garlic to the amount of potatos.  Really appreciate this recipe b/c I've been looking for an alternative to plain white (starchy) mashed potatos.

You will knock the socks off your family and friends when you make these mashed potatoes. I have made then both in the oven and on the stove top. Either way they rock!

I cut out the olive oil and baked the garlic cloves in aluminum foil for 30 mins at 350. I have made this many times and everyone has loved it!

I'm not a yam fan but Husband is, and he thought these were just ok. Quite a lot of work for not especially spectacular results. I'll probably make this again with regular potatoes and minus the yams. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

It was a huge hit on Thanksgiving, but everyone agreed that 1/2 cup of fresh rosemary was too much. In fact, next time I make it I will cut it in half. Other than that......mom wants the recipe so that means it was good!

I used jarred roasted garlic (2Tbsp) and fresh rosemary (1 1/2 tsp) and these turned out great! Tasty without being too spicy, you could still taste the potato and yam flavors.

This dish is wonderful and has become one of my favorites! It takes a bit of time to make but it isn't at all complicated and it is definitely worth the effort.  I like to add a little bit of garlic salt and some plain yogurt when I make it...really yummy!

I made this recipe for my parents on Thanksgiving and they loved it.  My dad had seconds and asked for all the leftovers.

If the usual sweet potatoe dishes are too sweet for your taste...this recipe is the way to go! Lovely rosemary (use fresh) and garlic goes well with turkey!

This was a weird blend of flavors.  It didnt get eaten.  The sweetness of the yams with garlic and parmesan just didnt work for us.

My fiance grew up on potatoes but I hate them so we rarely cook them, yet we both really liked this recipe.  I used minced garlic instead of roasted (my roasted cloves didn't work out so well).  I will definitely make this again- with more garlic.

these were AMAZING. what i actually did was cut the tops of those small, red potatoes off, and hollowed them out. i baked them a bit, then piped the mashed potatoes and yams into the small potatoes. when people saw them, the orange yams, green rosemary, and red potatoes just left them speechless (not to mention the flavor)!

This is a really good dish!  I modified it a little, as I do all recipes to fit the dietary needs of my family.  I added diced onions and boiled them with the potatoes. It gave it a lot more taste, although this recipe is great as is.I also used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter.  They were still so yummy! It is a bit more work than I anticipated but well worth it.

These were fantastic!  My boyfriend hates yams, so I made them with only russet potatoes, and they turned out wonderfully.  I'm not the biggest fan of mashed potatoes, but the rosemary and garlic flavor had me going back for seconds - this will be my only mashed potato recipe from now on.

We loved this!  I made it as written and it was delicious plus you get the added vitamin value of the sweet potatoes that you don't get in regular mashed.  Awesome!

I skipped the baking step, too, and I don't think the end result was as good as if I'd topped with cheese and baked the mashed potatoes.  Next time I will follow the recipe more exactly.

Although I didn't love this dish--a little too much garlic for me, my Thanksgiving guests loved it. Use fresh rosemary, it's much better.

These were okay, they weren't FABULOUS like I thought they would be.  I won't jump to make them again.

this was such a good recipe!  i tried to make it a little more healthy- i didnt use any butter (it doesnt need it) and just added a little fat free evaporated milk (just a tablespoon or two) as someone else suggested....i used fresh rosemary which was sooooo good- the only problem was that i over did it a little- oops.  still a great recipe though :)

So very tasty. I made this for Christmas last year and everyone loved them, especially my sister. She won't stop bugging me to make them again. I don't think anything needs to be changed with this recipe, it's fantastic the way it is.

Awesome! very easy, very tasty and I love that you can make it ahead and pop it into the oven whenever the turkey or chicken comes out. Definately feel free to use extra roast garlic, mmmmm. Thanks!

This was SOOO unbeleivably good!  Cooked exactly as written but scaled down for 4. I'll be bringing this to the easter family potluck.

This was quite a change from your basic yams! I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was gobbled up!

tried this as a christmas side dish.  takes some extra effort that i'm not sure is worth it.  the potatoes kind of "dilute" that sweet yam flavor.  i'd suggest adding brown sugar to taste before baking.

This is a fantastic way to serve potatoes.  The whole house smells delicious when these are in the oven.
