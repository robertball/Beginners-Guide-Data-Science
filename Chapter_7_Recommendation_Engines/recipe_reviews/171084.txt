Delish! This is was a nice appetizer for a grilled steak dinner.  In addition to the pepper, I added a little kosher salt. I used light feta cheese and since it wasn't herbed I added some minced garlic, basil, and oregano. I also put in some parmesan cheese and a bit of seasoned bread crumbs over top. You have to watch these carefully on the grill. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these again last night as a side with our grilled steaks.  My hubby is not as keen on feta as I am so I decided to mix the feta with a bit of three cheese mix from my deli,(Parmesan, Romano, Asiago).  Hubby really loved the simple addition.

mmm I really liked these. I had tomato basil feta on hand, and decided to use that. I was inspired by the basil though so I added a bunch of fresh copped basil from the garden as well as the chopped insides of the tomatoes back in with the cheese and bail mixture. I cannot wait to make this with tomatoes out of my garden instead of out of the store.

These were simple to prepare and turned out nicely, though they were quite simple.  I'd like to try these again, with a clove of garlic and chopped basil and shredded parmesan mixed into the fetta.

Why haven't I tried this sooner?  I spray Pam on mine rather than rubbing them with olive oil.  I typically only have regular feta on hand so I mixed in a little dried oregano and basil before stuffing the tomatoes.  I loosely fill them so the cheese actually melts.  I've done this in the oven or the grill (depending on the method of cooking that night) and they have both come out tasting yummy.  Sad the tomato season is ending here.  Will make as often as possible.

Quick and easy and full of flavor. I added a tsp or two of greek basil dressing and some bread crumbs to absorb that. I also dabbed the tomato fruit (sans seeds) with a paper towel and mixed with rest of ingredients before stuffing the shell. 15 minutes on med heat did the trick. Thanks, Wilemon!

I like recipes that are very simple and this one turned out great!  I used light feta & ran out of propane just in time for grilling, but they were still very tasty.

Simple.  Flavorful.  Nice presentation.  My tomatoes were overcooked at 13 minutes though.  Will shorten cook time next time.

These were good.  Not very original, or "different" but they tasted good.  My husband thought that they would be better if cooled and used on a sandwich...which is what he did.  I would rather chop up the tomatoes and top a pizza with them and the feta.  I did broil versus grill these...maybe that makes a huge difference.

Great side, especially when grilling. I added a little Parmesan in with the feta before stuffing the tomato's. Cooked on the top grate of the grill. Still needed to to keep a close eye on them. The small one started to crumble quickly.

These are so good that I am making them again today! Just made 4 yesterday to try and they are fantastic. I baked them for 15 minutes on 400 degrees. Just had plain feta, so sprinkled with basil. Also infused garlic in olive oil and used that to spread on inside and outside.

This recipe is delicious! I made it as written, except I didn't have garlic and herb feta, just plain feta. So I added some minced garlic and herbs de provence to the feta. It was a hit for our 4th of July grillout! We will definitely be making these again!

Yum! I expected the feta to be overpowering, but it really wasn't. I had plain feta, so I mixed in garlic, basil & oregano. I also salted & peppered the inside of the tomato before adding the filling and topped it off with a little grated parmesan. Hubby wants to put these in the regular rotation!

Winner!  We really liked this one with a steak. The only problem is that I could have eaten two instead of one!

Absolutely amazing! I don't even like tomatoes, but these were incredible. All the flavors just went so well together. We also changed it up a bit and made half of the tomatoes with Romano cheese and fresh herbs. Delicious!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I didn't have feta cheese but I had goat cheese which I mixed with garlic and added some grated zucchini to it. Also a pinch of cayenne pepper and Italian spices. The broiled stuff tomatoes were delicious.

I have to give the recipe as written only 4 stars, but I had tweeted it and the family is looking forward to this side dish again. I had large tomatoes, so I doubled the feta cheese and added about a cup of Asiago and Parmesan cheese mix with 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning. People were looking for seconds and disappointed there was none.  Thanks for the great barbecue idea!

This was pretty good, and I would make it again, but I don't think it's fantastic - just "very nice."  I did have trouble with one of the tomatoes collapsing before the cheese was really hot and melted, but that's the fault of the tomato, not the recipe.
