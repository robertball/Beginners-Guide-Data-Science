I like recipes you can modify to what ingredients you have on hand. I had no mushrooms so subbed onion instead. Also used a mozzarella/cheddar cheese combo. The omelet was fluffy! The directions are spot on. Will definitely make this again. It's an any meal dish, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Thanks for the recipe:)! (I've already had seconds)!!!:)

Very good. Fluffy too! Had no ham so I used bacon, also used mozzarella and cheddar. Original recipe yielded three large servings, enough for three adults for a quick dinner. Will make again.

Looked good but my family didn't love it.
