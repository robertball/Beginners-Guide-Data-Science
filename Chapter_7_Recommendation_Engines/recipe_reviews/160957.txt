In 56 years I've had plenty go in this mouth of mine, but last night was, as the old man put it..."a defining moment"...this was undoubtedly THE BEST shrimp dish we have ever had. OMG....we could not stop raving about it.  I am so glad that we tried this, and I will be making this often.  I don't know what to say, I am speechless, which is rare..but I am so pleased to have found this recipe.  If you are a shrimp lover, friends you need to give this one a try..you WILL NOT be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing.

Love love love this recipe! It is dead-on exact to the Slippery Shrimp at Yang Chow's in L.A.'s Chinatown. One bite took me right back to the west coast! The second time I made it I doubled the sauce and that was nice as well.

WOW!!! This recipe is just fantastic!  My teenage son summed it up, OMG!!! We love upscale Chinese food and to be able to make it at home and enjoy a GREAT restaurant quality dish right out of your own kitchen was very enjoyable. This is our new favorite dish. We decided not to include it in our regular rotation and to keep it for special celebrations or for a special pick me up! We also did the same recipe with Chicken and that was excellent as well! Thanks to Angela the submitter of this dish we can ALL ENJOY IT!!! Thanks Ange...

Okay, I have been going to Yang Chow for 9 years now and after making a few changes I believe I am about 95% with revisions. I have made this 4 times over the past 4 days (I had alot of shrimp in the freezer) and here are my changes. Omit cayenne. 1 1/2-2tsp garlic, 2tsp ginger minced, five japanese dried red chili's (I found mine in the spice packet spice section of the grocery store where eveyrthing is like .99c)sliced down the middle or just use 1/2 -1tsp crushed red chili flakes ( I used both)or to taste, 3tbs vinegar, 1tbs sherry or wine, 1/2 tbs ketchup, 6tsp white sugar, 1tsp fish sauce or 1/2 tsp salt (I used fish sauce-no salt). Fry the shrimp really well, definately longer than 45sec. I use a cast iron skillet and cook the shrimp pretty hard until I hear it start to hiss. The goal is to get a good crispy shrimp. Once they are tossed in the sauce some of the crunch will go away, but it will still have great texture. Drain on a paper towel or cooling rack. All the other ingredients should stay as is. Combine the ingredients that make the sauce ahead of time to let the peppers marinate to give it some heat and after you do the garlic ginger step and add the sauce and cornstarch mixture, make sure to let it get really reduced to concentrate the flavors. I kid you not, I sat down and couldnt believe how close this was to the real thing. Don't forget to serve this over white rice.

These tasted great when they were hot. Reheated, not so much. My only complaint is that the cornstarch didn't give it a good breading. Next time i will dip in battered egg, then maybe cornstarch? I think the shrimp should be "tempura" fried.... but everything after that was great! I did fry them in veggie oil with some sesamee oil bc I didn't have peanut oil. Will make again but with better batter!!!

This meal was DELICIOUS!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  I have never used a wok before to cook, but the shrimp took much longer than 45 sec to brown, like 5 min or so.  Also, this recipe is VERY similar to Bang Bang Shrimp from Bonefish Grill, but this one has a few more steps and ingredients.  Also, if you don't have a wok, you can cook it in a large skillet and be fine.  A wok is not necessary.

Outstanding! Won rave reviews from the whole family (with the exception of girl child - who didn't care for the "afterbite") I did double the sauce, but next time I will triple it for extra for the rice. Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing!

Undeniably awesome.  I can't resist tinkering with a recipe, but this one is perfection as is.  In fact, it is the first recipe from this site that I haven't changed one thing.  Well, okay, I doubled the sauce, because ooh mama!  Is it good!  The coating is just right--not too heavy, just a light crispy coating.  My husband isn't a shrimp kind of guy, I have to coax him to eat it.  He really liked this and said he would definitely want it again.  Yay for me, cuz I get to eat this again.  And again.  And again...

While I have never had Slippery Shrimp, the idea of this recipe sounded really delicious. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. It had an odd chemical taste to it, that I gather was the combination of vinegar, wine and cayenne. In spite of all of the sugar in the recipe, I found no sweetness to this. I guess I won't be making again. Thanks for the recipe though.

This recipe was soo good! I served it over rice, and it was delicious! I didn't have green onions, so I used regular onions and it came out great!

Loved this recipe! I'm a veggie kind of girl so I doubled the recipe and started off with sautee-ing julienned carrots, onion, bell peppers and mushrooms and then began adding the ingredients to make the sauce. I served it over egg noodles that had been boiled and drained and then tossed with a splash of sesame oil and maggi seasoning (which you can buy at any asian market). This is now in my regular cooking rotation and my family loves this dish.

AMAZING!! I used a bag of already cooked, tail-off shrimp and just tossed it in the corn starch, skipping a step. We both loved it, and wish it had made twice as much!

The recipe is delich!!  I just made it tonight.  I did not change a thing.  The shrimp were perfect with the cornstarch and not gummy - you definately have to shake the cornstarch off.  Give it a try!!

Excellent dish and really it was fairly simple to make. I made a few mods that worked really well. First off, I did not want to make a separate side of vegetables, so I dusted about a pound of blanched red, green and yellow pepper strips that I also in the corn starch and fried with the shrimp. Because of all the extra veggies there was not enough sauce, so I added half a cup of fresh OJ and a little more cornstarch to the sauce and it turned out beautifully.

This was actually really good. I was nervous about tring it due to the negative reviews I read.  Now I know why it’s called slippery shrimp as it is a little slippery.  I did not think it was too sweet at all.  Love the sweetness along with the spice in it.  I have never eaten at Yang Chow’s but know how rewarding it is to reproduce a recipe from a great restaurant!  I made Quick Chinese-style Vermicelli to go with this as I’m burned out on rice… I had to Dr. it up quite a bit but turned out great with this shrimp dish.  I double the sauce to have enough to go with the Vermicelli (rice pasta).  My hubby and I loved this dish…I really have come out of my cooking “box” and have explored a lot of Asian cooking and I’m really glad I have! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good and pretty easy.  Definitely double the sauce (but not the cayenne).  Shrimp take longer to brown than 45 secs.  Use a candy thermometer to make sure oil is as hot as required to avoid mushy coating.

Really, really special. The ingredients came together seamlessly. The cornstarch coating is perfectly light -- no need to use egg wash or anything else. Thanks for nailing a great dish!

I made this on a whim & it is now one of my favorite shrimp dishes! I loved the sweet/spicy flavor! Next time I will definitely double the sauce & add some broccolini with the shrimp. Delicious!!

This was pretty darn close to Yang Chow's. I like a lot of sauce so next time I'll double it, but other than that this was fantastic. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My wife loves shrimp.  So I thought that I'd try this recipe out.  She liked it so much, she asked me if I'd marry her again.  It was very delicious, thanks for posting the recipe.  This one's a keeper.

To those that say this recipe doesn't provide enough sweetness...if anything, it's a bit too much sugar, especially when the vinegar accentuates the sweetness. I've never been to Yang Chow, but if this is representative of their regular fare, count me out. The ingredient list starts out okay, but I'd sub in ground Szechuan red pepper instead of cayenne. And, of course, 5 teaspoons of sugar is excessive for only a pound of shrimp. Something I did appreciate was the light battering and the subtle zing of the green onions. Too bad for the overwhelming sweetness, though.

Very good! I did not have white wine so I used sherry and I used rice vinegar. Wow! I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic! I used 1/2 lb of shrimp but kept the sauce for the full recipe because reviews said it needed more sauce to cover rice. I used coconut oil to fry in and subbed white wine vinegar for the wine and vinegar that I didn't have and a little less sugar. Sadly no fresh ginger so used powdered. I sautéed some vegetables in the pan before proceeding with the sauce to make it more of a meal. I added toasted walnuts with the green onion for the top. It was pretty spicy but that didn't stop us from eating it all! Will definitely do this again

Oh snap this was so good!  I made it according to the recipe but used vegetable oil for frying because I did not have peanut oil.  I will make this again for sure but next time I will coat in more corn starch for extra crunch and cook the shrimp at a slightly higher heat to make more crispy.  The sauce was good but not spicy enough for me so I will ad more cayenne to the sauce next time.  OUTSTANDING!

The flavor was amazing. 
I was a little leery after measuring out the ingredients for sauce ,but was surprised at the outcome. 
Nice burst of flavor with minimal ingredients .
Wish I could avoid the extra step of frying the shrimp in oil  but overall it was worth it and I will definitely make it again .

I made this yesterday for a New Year's party and received rave reviews. We all liked it but it was a lot of work! I doubled the recipe and cooked in a frying pan.  Just getting the shrimp coated & fried -- my kitchen was a total mess. Still, I'm going to make again, but i think I'll make the sauce and just add the raw shrimp to it.

Very good!  I doubled the sauce and still added 1/2 cup more water because I thought it was too thick.  I also added cornstarch coated red pepper slices with the shrimp. I used extra large shrimp and fried for about 90 seconds.

The only changes I made were out of necessity. I didn't have a few things on hand. And I doubled the sauce per other reviews. I will however cut back on the Cayenne next time. a little too spicy for us and we like spicy.  It was awesome! definitely a keeper.

I made considerable changes to this recipe, not to say that the original is bad, it is simply what i do with all base recipes. What i did, was i added baking powder, flour and an egg wash to the shrimp. This came out almost like a tempura or a very crispy, and light coating. Instead of adding cayenne pepper, i substituted red chili saice. chili flakes, ketchup, white wine vinegar and fish sauce for the saltiness on the sauce. 

The shrimp soaked up a lot of the sauce and wasnt overly crispy, but great. i reccomend making this recipe from scratch and also having fun with it.

My entire family loved this meal. When I started preparing this I was certain I had all the ingredients but later realized I didn't have wine or the cayenne pepper.  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and a mixture of chili powder and red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  I also added a splash of seasame oil in the sauce. Even with the substitutions this was delicious.  

We look forward to making this again and will add this delightful dish to our regular rotation. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I've never been to Yang Chow, so I'm not familiar with this recipe. I love shrimp and I'd never tried a Chinese dish that I didn't love. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This recipe had an odd aftertaste to me.i wasn't sure if it was the sauce or the cornstarch on the shrimp that caused it. I also found that it required a longer cooking time than stated. The leftovers weren't edible.

Pretty good flavour, but I found the sauce to be a bit chalky when I doubled it.  Next time I'll try less corn starch in the mixture.  I also had a hard time getting the "cripsy" exterior on the shrimp.  It really is a delicious sauce, though.

This was wonderful. I used rice vinegar, and stir fried some cut up fresh asparagus before adding the garlic. Completed it by serving over white rice. I agree with the original poster, cook shrimp for 45 seconds, no longer than 60 seconds if you want your shrimp tender. I did add garlic powder and ground pepper to the corn starch coating. Will make this again, would make a great dish to serve at a small dinner party.

Spot on! I tried it, it Really IS Great! I followed this recipe to the T, except I only had a sweet sparkling white wine, but that is only a Tablesppon off. So Good! Thank You! P.S They need to post this in Gluten Free Recipes too!

In order to make this a bit healthier, I changed a few things and it still tastes amazing!!! I only used 1/4 cup vegetable oil to quick sauté the shrimp, I did NOT coat them in corn starch either. I followed the recipe as written otherwise. I did steam some broccoli and added it in at then end with the onions! Served it over brown basmati rice. Delicious!! I enjoy the heat of this dish too!

OMG!  We loved this!  Made it according to recipe except I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested.  This will certainly be repeated.

Followed this recipe exactly.  My only critique is that there wasn't enough, since we liked it so much.

This is a delicious recipe! I used Tiger Prawns and they were yummy. My husband and his friend told me this recipe was the best thing they tasted in a long time. This one s a keeper!!

O.M.G.   This was so delicious.  I wanted to try a "different" shrimp recipe -- something other than grilled or scampi and came across this recipe.  I was a little leary at first of a shrimp recipe with ketchup in it, but you don't taste the ketchup.  The ingredients blend together and make a thick sauce.  Perfect with rice or pasta, and some fresh vegetables.  I was so full, but I just couldn't throw out the last two shrimp, so I ate them!  Hubby (who is as picky as they come) ate every last bite and told me to make it again -- soon!

My mouth is watering just thinking about this dish.

I have never commented on this site but this was amazing. I have been tired of the same thing over and over. This was a change from the norm and absolutely fantastic!!! I made it exactly as stated. Next time I will double the sauce to soak in rice. That's it perfect!!

i thought the recipe was very good. I served it with coconut brown rice with a squeeze of fresh lime, which i think was a compliment to this recipe. I would have the sauce made ahead of time so the shrimp doesn't get cold. My husband liked it. I will definitely make this again!
