I love to make these cookies.  I have made them umpteen times.  I make them with brownie mix and not cake mix.  The ones with the cake mix are too, well...cakey.  These turn out yummy chewy and they are the easiest cookies in the world to make.  I have found the trick to make them perfect, non-spreading, and non-sticking.  Instead of adding the eggs and oil separately; beat the eggs and oil together in a small bowl first, then add it to the mix and combine.  Now, you can do your additions.  Butterscotch, semi-sweet, milk chocolate, heath bits, coconut, nuts, or whatever your fancy.  I use a small cookie scoop and cooke for 12 minutes.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  They turn out perfect

I really wanted these to be amazing.  I read all of the reviews and decided I was going to go with the exact recipe with one exception.  I refrigerated the dough for about an hour.  There is nothing wrong with the taste of these cookies but the are very difficult to work with.  All the time you save with prep you waste after baking.  You have to watch like a hawk in the oven because they go from under to over very quickly.  You also have to time your removal from cookie sheet precisely...too short cookie literally falls apart in your hand making a yummy mess.  Too long and you need a crow bar to get them off of tray, again, yummy mess.  I ended up only getting about 10 servable cookies. the rest were a yummy crumble.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did not use a Cake Mix, like alot of others did, because it called for a Brownie Mix. Based on actual recipe posted, these did not turn out well at all! I only baked them for 7 minutes, second sheet 6 minutes. Looked fine when they came out, but when I tried to remove them from the sheet, they were stuck like glue! I ended up with a crumbled mess. Even had to break out a knife to scrape them off. Rated 2 stars ONLY because submitter did suggest a cake mix as well and everyone who did it that way had no problems. Otherwise, it's a zero.

This is the best quick dessert recipe I have found yet. I usually use a cake mx when I make this. I tried the spice cake mix idea and it was great. 
Plus, these cookies have a great shape and thickness for ice cream sandwich cookies. Just soften some ice cream, shovel some out with a spoon and place it on a cookie. put another cookie on top, stick the whole thing in a zip-loc bag then immediately in the freezer. Take out and serve whenever you want. This  is a great treat for a party (nothing fancy, cuz it can be a bit messy while eating) or for any hot summer day.

1st batch made as stated and the taste was fine, but the cookies really spread out -way too much IMHO  2nd batch -substituted melted butter for oil and added 3/4 cup of quick oats.  MUCH BETTER!

I couldn't rate these a five because I don't like white chocolate and therefore didn't make this recipe as written, but I chopped up York Peppermint Patties instead and got rave reviews on these.

I would definitely use parchment paper for these and err on the side of caution with the time.  I also noticed that these spread differently depending on which brand of brownie mix you use.  When I used Duncan Hines mix they spread really flat and crispy and only needed 8 minutes to bake.  Pillsbury brownie mix resulted in a puffier cookie that needed about 9 minutes to bake and came off the cookie sheet easier....another reason I couldn't quite rate these a 5, the recipe is not consistent.  Not a fault of the poster, just a matter of fact based on my making them two times with different brands of product.

Quick and easy!  Both times I used Reese's Pieces instead of choc chips.  Just like eating a little brownie.  I also rolled them into balls the second time to make sure they had a chewie center.

Yumm-o!  These were super easy and dare I say, better than making them from scratch.  I mixed the dough with peanut butter chips and refrigerated for a couple hours.  I used a small cookie scoop, baked 12 minutes and cooled 5 minutes on the pan (which was lined with parchment paper.)  It needed the full 12 minutes because the dough was cold and the scoop made a thick cookie.  Perfect!

This is a good, quick recipe when you're in the mood for cookies but don't want to make it from scratch. I used a brownie mix and followed the directions. I made sure, though, to line my baking sheet with parchment paper---easier clean-up and makes sure the cookies won't stick! I also baked this for ONLY 8 MINUTES. It will look a little undone but will continue to bake when you take it out of the oven. Leave the cookies on the sheet for a minute and transfer to a wire rack. My cookies came out looking crackled and flat (not a bad thing), crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Really good! (Store leftovers in an airtight container.) TIP: Everyone's oven is different. Try baking one small batch at 8 minutes, another at 9 or 10. See what works best for you. 8 minutes worked best for me!

Excellent!

After reading a lot of the reviews, I followed the recipe precisely, using tips from reviews such as mixing eggs and oil first, and making certain that cookies cooled for at least one minute before removing from cookie sheet. We always use silicone mats on our cookie sheets so that MAY have made the cookies lift off easier but honestly the only time one didn't release was because I took  that batch from the oven too soon and it was completely raw in the middle! 

I did have trouble getting the white chocolate chips to stay in the dough but that might have been due to using frozen chips. (didn't want to wait for them to come to room temp)

I made some chewy and some crispy and am enjoying both as I type this review.

These were very easy to make. I followed another person's suggestion and whisked together the eggs and oil before adding the brownie mix. Then folded in the white chocolate chips. I baked for about 9 minutes. These cookies did not flatten out, which was great. They tasted good, too.

I made these with a brownie mix and peanut butter chips.  YUM!  I baked for 10 min. and did grease my pan.  They did stick a little when I removed from pan (after cooling a couple of min) but no big problem.  Will definitely make these again.

Delicious and easy! A great way to make brownies less messy so you can bring them places/share! I made mine with milk chocolate chips instead of white (because that's what I had on hand) and they were great!

This is one of our favorites. I usually use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. They are fabulous! I have made cookies for years like this with cake mix. Devils food and mini chocolate chips are just as good as these, just don't over cook!

Just took these out of the oven...nice and chewy, but very sweet.  I used white chips...(Nestle's morsels)...and probably should have used something that said "chocolate" in it.  Not much chocolate flavor, but good, nonetheless.

4 stars for ease and alright-tasting cookie.  Had no problems getting them off the cookie sheets, but definitely let them sit and cool for a minute or so before you remove them to cool completely.  I followed the recipe but used M&Ms, about 1 cup.  Baking them longer than 8 minutes will result in a crispier cookie.  Depends on what you were looking for.

I forgot to make cookies for my son's nursery school graduation.  I found this recipe and whipped it up after work.  I used butterscotch chips.  The cookies disappeared in no time flat.  A good basic recipe when you're sort on time.

I love it! Brownie cookies? Such a good idea. Take ashleynicole's advice about not overbaking them though... I thought I was being careful but just a few of the cookies burned (barely) on the bottom, but they were really easy to just scrape off. I changed it up a little by sprinkling the cookies with those hot cocoa powder things. This recipe is very simple and DELICIOUS!

This recipe is FANTASTIC - And with my little tweak you will get the best cookies ever.  I start with the oil, the cake mix, the eggs and I add 1/2 PKG OF CREAM CHEESE - and baking time is 12-16 min.  The cream cheese adds just the right kick.  I did two variations....
   1)  I used a carrot cake mix, then added white choc chips, raisins & walnuts. (next time I'll also add chopped apple)
   2)  I used a lemon cake mix, no chips at all.
   To both of these I melted milk chocolate chips in the microwave and then dipped half the cookies in chocolate - EVERYONE loves these cookes and it is by far the most amazingly versatile recipe I've ever used - the possibilites are simply endless!!!

I made these when DD needed cookies for a church retreat, and they were easy, quick, and delicious! I followed the advice of other reviewers, mixing the eggs and oil together before adding to the batter. I used a Ghiradelli mix with chocolate chips already in it, and [er directions, I added a cup of white chocolate chips. I baked on parchment paper for 10 mins. at 350, let them rest 1 minute after I took them out of the oven, and they cooled on a rack over my sink (so any crumbs would be easy clean-up). To anyone using a plain cake mix, add 1 Tbsp each of butter extract and vanilla extract, and the flavor improves greatly.

I've made this recipe several times and each time my boyfriend's coworkers beg for more. I substituted the white chocolate chips for regular milk chocolate chips because we aren't fans of white chocolate and they were divine. Soft, chewy with a slightly crunchy edge. So chocolatey!!!

OMG what can I say these are AWESOME!!! These are so good and easy I almost wish I never would've tried the recipe because my family and I have been eating and making way too much of these!! The first time I tried this recipe I actually only had a dutch chocolate cake mix and butterscotch chips. While I was making them I was worried but I shouldn't have. They turned out wonderful to say the least. My kids said they reminded them of chocolate soft batch cookies and they were right.  I also tried them another time with chocolate/white chocolate swirled chips and they were okay but the butterscotch chips were better. The absolute best yet though was when we mixed in some sweetened coconut and butterscotch chips...perfection and so easy!! My next try will be with toffee chips and I'm sure they'll be good to. Thanks SO much for this super easy supper yummy recipe!

This was a great, easy recipe.  I happen to have brownie mix in my house so I thought I would give it a shot.  I cannot bake usually but these brownie cookies were perfect.  I didn't have any choc chips but I did have M&M's.  YUMMY!!

I made these with one box of Devils Food Cake mix. Baked for 10 minutes. Kids and husband loved them! VERY easy to make! Make sure to let them cool for a while before removing from baking rack. I put the cooling rack with cookies in the fridge for a few minutes, so they wouldn't have to wait so long to eat them. They were GREAT with a cold glass of milk! What a great way to make cookies when you are short on time and ingredients.

This is an awesome recipe - I have to admit that I hate brownies from mixes but inevitably end up with boxed mixes.  I must get amnesia in the grocery.  I made this recipe as written, just substituted peanut butter chips for the white.  They turned out amazing!  The texture is crunchy and chewy and the chocolate flavor is more intense than a usual brownie.

These tasted great, but were flat, and I mean FLAT...my pancakes are fluffier.  I couldn't take them to the luncheon that they were intended for.  Like cardstock flat, huge disappointment.

I tried this with substituting applesauce for oil (1/3 cup like recipe states).  They cookies are good, but they are very flat and gooey.  I like my cookies a little on the "rare" side, so maybe that is why they are gooey.  They don't come off of the pan very easily, but they taste wonderful!

So yummy and so easy!  I made mine with a devil's food cake mix and peanut butter chips.  The cookies were moist and delicious and came together in about 20 minutes!

These were yummy.  Everyone liked them, and they were really good and gooey.  I didn't have white chocolate so I just used regular chocolate chips.  I had to add a bit of water to mine because my mix was a bit larger than what was called for.  And I greased my sheets.  I only baked them for 8 minutes, they were still a bit soft on top.  It seemed like they weren't done, but once they cooled they were fine.  The only thing I don't like is that they get dry and crumbly much faster than regular cookies the next few days after.  I suppose if they don't last that long in  your house you'll be fine.  :)

These cookies are wonderful. However, I did have to alter them a bit to accomodate what I had in the house. I didn't have while chocolate chips on hand. So I searched my cabinets and found those white almond bark candy discs that we had from a different project. I broke those into chunks and used them instead.  I had a ton of compliments!  We will use this recipe again soon!!

These were awesome. I used 2 cups of white chips instead of one. Tip: do not over bake these.

This was a quick substitute for baking brownies since they usually take 45 minutes. I served these warm, as part of a brownie sundae, and with regular chocolate chips. Excellent!
