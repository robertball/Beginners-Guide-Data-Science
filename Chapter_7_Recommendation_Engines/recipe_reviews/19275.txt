The batter for these brownies tasted great before I baked it:) but the pan the recipe calls for is too small for the ammount of batter it made. It took over a hour to bake it and when it was finally done it was dry dense and not very tasty. The only thing that helped it was to put one "brownie" in a bowl and cover it in chocolate syrup and milk. If I make it again I would use a 9"x 13" pan instead of 9"x9" and I would add 1/3 cup milk.

This recipe turned out pretty good! On another review of this recipe they suggested to use a 9x13 pan instead of a 9x9 pan and also they would add 1/3 cup of milk. I took both of those suggestions the first time I made it and they turned out great! The next time I use this recipe I am not going to use as much cocoa - it was just to much cocoa for my taste. It is very cakey just the way I like my brownies.:-)

I think what would help it most of all is to cut down on the flour--that's considerably more than most brownies call for.

I just finished baking these browines they smell great! i followed others advise and used a 9x13 pan and it filled the pan no way this can go in a smaller pan and i also added 2/3c milk. I thought i did something wrong to start with because it looked so thick wasnt sure they were going to come out right. Just waiting on them to cool off now so i can put the icing on them

I would agree with the reviews that call this version "cakey." The added milk definitely helps. Not as sweet as I expected but used as a base for a larger desert or with added ingredients like chocolate chips I think the mild sweetness actually works in its favour.

These Brownies are definitely cakey as opposed to fudgy. I followed the advice given by others and added 1/2 cup of milk to the batter and they were still fairly dry. However with a glass of milk they were excellent--the perfect foil. They definitely have a strong chocolate flavor.

Super dry and cakey. Its needs oil or milk or something. The topping made it easy to swallow otherwise top with ice cream.

I probably should have tookin the time to read the comments BEFORE cooking so i went by the recipe...I agree they are very dry and super dense! The only thing that made these edible was a brownie glaze i made and a tall glass of milk!

I didn't think these were bad at all. I did add some milk but that was my only addition. I also had to use soy flour water for the eggs since I was out and I didn't add the topping. I made these into mini brownies in a mini muffin pan cooking them for about 10 minutes. The batter was really good and the brownies were pretty good too. Especially the doughy ones:).

I tried making this on a whim and it turned out like a dense cake. The favor was a bit bland for what I was expecting.

I made some adjustments to mine because of previous reviews I did 1/4 less flour added 1/4 more sugar and some milk. Also I added 1/2 tsp. of baking poweder. The result was good if a little rich. I probably should have added more sugar but still enjoyable. My family loved them!

Based on other reviews we cut the flour to one cup and added about 1/3 of a cup of half and half (had no milk). I had low expectations based on all the negative reviews so I was pleasantly surprised. They weren't cake-y at all. They are dense and moist. We left off the chocolate frosting and didn't miss it. We ate them warm it will be interesting to see how they do once they cool.

I read the helpful reviews so I substituted 1 cup of the butter with sour cream I added a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda 3 tablespoons of almond butter a teaspoon of more of salt and I substituted cacao for cocoa 1-1. I also used 1 cup of organic raw sugar and 1 cup of organic brown sugar to counteract the sourness of the cream. It seems to have just the right consistency and is not too dry as other reviewers said regarding this version. It came out moist not too fudge but yet not too fluffy either.

I'm sorry but these were so dry. I even took the advice of other reviews and they were still dry.

I liked these for their thick cake like texture. I tweaked it using 1/2 cup special dark cocoa powder and 1/2 cup regular cocoa powder. I added 1 tsp of espresso powder and 2/3 of a cup half and half to smooth the batter out. Bake at 350 for 45 minutes in an 8x8 pan and they came our great.

I goofed. I was interrupted many times and ended up using both the cocoa powder and semi-sweet chocolate in the brownie mix. It fix this blunder I added 1/4 c sugar 1 c milk 2 T oil 1 T baking powder and walnuts. Put it into a 9x13 pan for 40-45 minutes. Came out ok. Needed more sugar. It was moist though.
