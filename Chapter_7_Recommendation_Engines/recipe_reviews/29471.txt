Good Stuff!  I cut the recipe in half because eight pounds of mussels seemed like a lot.  The 4 of us were so enamored with these mussels that I wish I had gotten the extra four pounds to make the next day!  Good and simple, but you feel like you're cooking dinner in someones seaside villa!

I fell in love with Mussels when I spent a fall in Belgium and this recipe was so delightful and easy. I added 1 small red pepper and 1/2 a portabella mushroom as I had them handy. :).
