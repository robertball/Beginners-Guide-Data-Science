Made with individually frozen halibut fillets cooked on the broiler, this meal is incredibly quick to prepare. 
 
The simple sauce is fantastic and one of the reasons I like the dish so much.

These tacos were so good and so easy. I changed the process a little: after shredding the cabbage I added a spoonful of mayo and a large spoonful of sour cream, then drizzled in some of the chipotle sauce and mixed it up. Then topped fish with the "slaw." We added a little more chipotle marinade on top because it was so yummy!

We just returned from Panama City FL were we thought we had the best fish tacos, that was until we tried these!  Wow, the finishing sauce has a great taste and great kick.  

I used Orange Roughy because there was no Halibut in the store and other reviews said the Cod was a little bland.  I also kicked it up a notch by adding a southwest chipolte seasoning to the fish before adding it to the marinade.  

I topped it off with fresh strawberries (on the side), guacomole, and mango salsa (this was the icing on the cake so to speak).   Fabulous dish,  my husbands says it's a keeper!

More like 3 1/2 stars.  The sauce was great.  Very flavorful, but the tacos themselves not amazing.  I used cod, but maybe halibut would be a little better.  The recipe was ok, but not amazing.

We had these for dinner tonight and they were amazing.  We used tilapia and added avocado, but either than that, I cooked according to the recipe.  We will definitely have these again and again!

Great quick and easy dish.  Very tasty and even my husband (who says everything I cook is too bland) loved them.  I used fresh Tuna and it was great.

I used tilapia (marinaded for a couple of hours), white corn tortillas & I used shredded lettuce instead of cabbage. I also added some leftover salsa from another recipe (Seared Scallops with Tropical Salsa) & w/out it, I think this would be very bland. Although my grandson preferred the tacos w/out the salsa. I served these w/ Santa Fe Rice Salad ...will have again.

I was really looking forward to trying this, but was really turned off by the strong worstershire taste that the marinade left in the fish (a little worstershire taste goes a long way with me). This tasted nothing like traditional fish tacos.

I think I was expecting something different than what this was. It was OK but I'll keep looking for one I like.

just wonderful. My husband is always honest with me regarding my new recipes, and he told me he loved this, even though I used the wrong type of fish; Sole, which kind of fell apart after the marinade and grilling. I will use cod next time, and I will make it again. Loved it.
