Really yummy! Something different. The key to making these is not to try and roll the balls right away. The dough needs to refrigerate for a good while. Wait until it is firm like a cookie dough then spoon out and forming into balls is easy. After they are made it is best to let them refrigerate overnight for the best results.

not very good at all.  They taste a little like condensed milk.  It doesn't seem like enough coconut milk but it is, just keep on stirring.  Will not make again.

LOL. I'm Brazilian and I love those Milk powder deserts. 
They are supoused to be sticky. You need to grease your hands with butter to rool it. They are should not be hard as a cook doh. 
And yes, It should have a tast of the powder milk.

They are plain and flavorless and taste only like sugary milk. I suppose they would be a little better with lees powdered milk a little more coconut milk and a bit of vanilla extract. Also you cannot roll out the dough until putting in in the refrigerator to stiffen up.

I cut this recipe to 20 servings but followed the directions otherwise (at first). What I had was more of a batter than a dough. I let it sit for about 15 minutes and it firmed up a little. It was still not thick enough to roll. I didn't want to add more confectioners' sugar or powdered milk. I decided to add flaked coconut. After adding about a cup the dough was finally firm enough to roll. It was still sticky so I used a cookie scoop and dropped the balls into the sugar then rolled them. They do firm up in the refrigerator and make a very tasty treat.

I really like this great fun for my 4 yr old son rolling these in sugar:) but due to the powder milk taste I added a tsp of vanilla which help cut that powder milk taste a little but it still had the flavor just better.
