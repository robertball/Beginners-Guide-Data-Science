I wasn't sure which part of the lavender plant to use in this recipe.  The first time I made it, I used the blossoms, which didn't chop very well.  The second time, I used the leaves, and the bread turned out much better.  In fact, it won second prize at our local fair.  The bread was definitely different and not something I'd want all the time, but it would make a good bread for a tea or shower and definitely improves with strawberry preserves.  It's also firm enough to toast and smells delicious when prepared that way.

I haven't made this yet, but I felt the need to help. When baking/cooking w/lavender you use the flower, NOT the leaves. The loves are used in cosmetics. It is best to steep the flower in the warm liquid (in this case, milk), than removing the flower and adding the liquid to the recipe. I am looking forward to trying this recipe.

This bread is really easy to make and very delicious! It has a cake-like texture, but isn't too heavy or too sweet (I might use just a little less sugar next time). The lavender gives it an almost mint-like freshness that's is really quite delightful. A lemon glaze, or a bit of lemon zest in the dough would be a tasty addition. I can't wait to make it again!

This bread is very different and quite tasty.  I also prepared a citrus glaze:  1/2 cup sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp orange juice and 1 tbsp lavender blooms.

Fragrant, lovely, slightly dense tea bread. I made it with fresh lavender from my garden, which added another reason to enjoy this recipe. The next time I make this, I'll reduce the amount of lavender to 2 tablespoons because it is possible to have too much of a good thing. I also glazed my loaf with confectioners' sugar mixed with freshly squeezed lime juice. Heavenly.

This is more of a sweet bread such as banana or zuchinni bread beings no yeast is involved, but SO GOOD!!!
I made mine with lavender, orange thyme, lemon thyme,lemon balm & one sprig of rosemary...Sounds funny, but rosemary goes very well with citrus in my opinion,,,
Topped with seseame seeds..... It was fabulous!!!!!
Will top with a powder sugar glaze tomorrow & see how it is,,,,
Very moist, cake like bread that I will make again...
Leave it to your imagination... varations are endless!!!

I made this with 3 tablespoons and it was too strong. When I made it the second time, I used 2 tablespoons and made mini loaves so that I can try the citrus-lavender glaze that another poster added. The glaze is a great addition and we like it better than without.

This was insanely delicious. My husband and I spread some raspberry preserves on it right after it came out of the oven. I veganized the recipe, as well. I used 3/4 cup unsweetened Silk soy milk instead of cow milk, no eggs, and added 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp white vinegar to help it rise. I also baked it at 350 for 50 minutes, divided between 2 mini aluminum foil loaf pans. Turned out amazing, flaky, moist and delicious! Perfect for my current lavender obsession.

I love lemon with lavender, so I added the juice from 1 lemon (close to half a cup) and a tablespoon of lemon zest. It was delicious and added some moisture to this bread which is a little on the dry side. The texture with the lemon juice added was closer to pound cake.

This tea bread is a pleasant surprise. It produced a lovely light crumb and a beautiful crust with just the right amount of crispness. My kids compared the crust to 'cookies' (interpret that however you like :) and ate half the loaf before it was cool. I was using dried lavender, so chose a half tablespoon measure of it, which imparted a subtle taste, but it was definitely there. I find it resembles mint somewhat. I also added a tsp of fresh lemon zest, and a tsp of vanilla. I used 3 egg whites instead of the two whole eggs and canola oil instead of butter. I will be making this bread again. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I substituted the butter for "unsalted butter" and used a bit less of the lavender.  It's very light and not too sweet.  My oven bakes quickly, so the bread was done in 25 minutes.

Very nice! I ended up grinding half of the lavender so it would mix more easily into the batter. 
I also made the citrus glaze and loved it.

This is fantastic, very different but so good. I only had dried lavender on hand, so I used 1 tablespoon rather than 3, and it turned out great.

The tea bread came out light and fluffy and golden, and the scent was delicious. But personally, I found the taste of lavender overpowering. I used fresh lavender flowers from my herb garden. If I make this again, I will probably use less than half the amount of lavender and strain all the flowers out of the milk before using. I did squeeze some lemon in before baking, and that gave a very pleasant flavor.

Very good....a soft flavour and very easy to make.
I used dry lavender so I reduced to 1 1/2 Tbs.  It is a little bit dry but remember this is a bread not a cake.

I put a lemon frosting on top and the combination went absolutely fabulous.

This bread was wonderful! I used about two tablespoons of fresh lavender from the garden and some others suggested to lower the sugar to half a cup so I lower it to a happy medium at 3/4 cup of sugar. I also added 1/2 - 3/4 cup of fresh blueberries. I also had to let it bake for twenty extra minutes, but it was wonderful. It wasnt dry or too dense. It was perfect! I will be doing this again!

Excellent recipe. I made this with freshly chopped lavender leaves. Simmering them in milk was a great idea. Also substituted 1 c amaranth flour. Topped with a light lemon glaze (just freshly squeezed lemon juice and sugar)

OHMYGOD this lavender tea cake is amazing. I must say I substituted soy milk for real milk, just because there was none of the latter at our house. I kept all the other elements the same. So flavorful. Not ridiculously crumbly and soft in all the right ways! Kudos! Just a note, don't forget to take the lavender leaves off the stem!

I used a bit less lavender than called for. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. I think it may  have been overpowering if I hadn't made those changes. Overall very good, try it warm with butter.

I loved it.  Such a delicate flavor.  The house smelled wonderful when it was baking as well.  Lavender is such a nice flavor to add to things.  It gives it a bit of an unexpected twist.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the batter is fantastic, but I think I prefer it without the lavender.  I guess I'm just not a lavender person.  I used 1 tbsp of dry, which I think is just a tad too much.  It gets a bit of perfume taste to it. I should have added just a tad more flour because it was a bit crumbly.

Good bread! very tasty and perfect with tea. I used 2 tablespoons of lavender and it was fine. If I make it again I will put a little less sugar in it. It was a tad too sweet for my taste.

Not bad. I ended up making this today after hubs tried to serve me tea using culinary lavender. :)  since he'd already steeped it, I just added a bit more and used powdered milk in the tea water to keep the flavor.  I also added some lemon zest the the batter and made a quick lemon glaze using 1/3 cup sugar, 4 tablespoons lemon juice. I boiled for 3 minutes then poured over the loaf. Very nice, thank you!

This unique bread was moist and sweet with a delicate taste of lavender. It seems more like cake than bread to me, but delicious either way and very easy to make. I steeped my chopped lavender leaves in the milk for about 20 minutes, then strained the milk and used it (without the leaves) in the recipe and this seemed to work very well.

Added crushed almonds because i thought the leaves smell might overpower it.. It tasted quite nice. One thing though, if you've got really high quality leaves, u need to cut down on them. I used 2 and a half tablespoon and still felt it was overwhelming.

This bread was just perfectly sweet and eggy.  i would recommend grinding the lavender with a mortar/pestle or food processor to infuse the bread more evenly.  i served this with homemade concord grape jelly and people LOVED it.

Wonderful!

Made this once for my choir friends and it didn't last long, once they'd got over the initial shock of baking with something they associate with old ladies' perfume...

Now they are always requesting it! And I've actually had to buy more lavender plants, because the one in my herb garden's getting a bit bare.

The lavender milk idea is lovely, and if you strain it and add a little sugar it makes a perfect bedtime drink.

Thanks!

I absolutely love this recipe, I've made it 3 times now, the last 2 I've doubled the recipe as I've been making the mini loaves and giving them to friends. Delicious with butter but even better with lemon curd!

My lavender didn't make it through the summer. But I have 4 large rosemary bushes, so I substituted that for the lavender. I honestly don't think it made that much difference. But it is delicious slathered with REAL butter!

Really really good! I made this as muffins instead of a loaf (just baked for about 25 minutes less), halfed the amount of sugar and added some vanilla and they turned out great! I loved having these for breakfast with my tea!

If you like lavender, you will enjoy this recipe! I am a very novice baker and found the recipe easy to follow. I didn't have any fresh lavender on hand so I purchased dried/culinary lavender. I made a few changes:
-1 tbsp dried lavender (previously crushed with a rolling pin)
-Replaced half the butter with sour cream 
-Reduced sugar by half

Added a lemon/lavender juice on top for a citrusy kick when the loaf cooled: whisk 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp dried lavender (adapted from Jaime's review)

FANTASTIC! Stuck to the exact recipe and manually mixed this...then put in my bread machine to bake on Light setting. It was beautiful and tasted great! People gobbled it up and were amazed! The key to working with lavender is making sure you get culinary lavender and finely chopping it. The amount of lavender in this is PERFECT. I will not change a thing in this recipe.

Delicious.  Nice alternative quick bread.  Only change to recipe was I added 1/8 cup of lemon juice as others suggested.  I also strained the lavender flowers out of the milk before adding into the mixture which gave the bread the benefit of the flavor without the texture of the flowers.

Really good! I thought it was a little bit dry, but that could be because I ran out of butter when I was making this by about a tablespoon... I brought it to a party and everybody who likes lavender loved it. It is very floral. I'll make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I just ate a piece of this and it's delicious! The only change I made was decreasing the lavender to about 1 tablespoon (freshly harvested) based on previous comments about the strong taste using 2-3 tablespoons. Would definitely recommend this---thanks for posting!

Delicious. I had to bake it a little longer (my oven is screwey) and I think I overdid it b/c it was a little dry, but it was still amazing. I've never cooked with lavender before and this was a successful experiment! I would definitely make it again. My roommates loved the smell.

This recipe disappointed me. I followed the directions, except using splenda instead of sugar (Which I do all the time in baking recipes). The bread rose just like in the photo but when I took it out of the oven it collapsed completely and became flat and dense. I don't know what could have gone wrong. I make quick breads regularly and have never had this happen. Disappointing.

I thought this was okay.  I used fresh lavender from my garden, but I didn't think it tasted much like lavender at all.  It was good, but nothing special.

This an absolutly wonderful and easy to follow recipe. I made it for a ladies tea and used a citrus lavender glaze found on another site. It complimented the bread well.
