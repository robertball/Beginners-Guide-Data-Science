Yum!  Comes out perfect using imitation crab meat (sea legs or whatever fridge type they sell in your area). Did not add any salt but did add 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning.

I was looking for another recipe to use crab meat other than crabcakes.  This is an elegant  entr√©e which is easy to make.  I made it for my wife's birthday.  I made 2 small changes.  So as not to break up the crab meat, I waited to add it to the sauce until the very end and then gently stirred it.  I also added 1 tbs of sherry to the sauce.  I now may make this for the family on Christmas.

My family loved this recipe. I was looking for something different to do with crab besides crabcakes. This one will be going in my recipe box to make again. Delicious!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  This recipe gives you all the great taste of the lump crab that you paid for, with just subtle flavors as an  accent.
