I made this using Lime Juice Concentrate instead of lemonade - it was so delicious - just like Key Lime Pie. Very easy to make.

Delicious!  I didn't bother with the food coloring.  The filling over fills the pie so you don't need to use all of it.  I set mine in the freezer as it was going to be served outside in the heat.  It's pretty good frozen as opposed to the refrigerator.  If you let it thaw for a little bit it's easier to cut.

Very simple, using the most basic of ingredients and quite good. I bought all the ingredients called for in this recipe at my local discount grocery store. I used low-fat cream cheese and FF whipped topping. I had no pre-bought crust so I made my own using a package of Mother's iced oatmeal cookies and a little butter. I might add a little more lemon, perhaps some zest, next time as I like my pies a little puckery-sweet.

My 10 year old daughter made this for a Father's Day dessert. Very easy!!! It has a great lemon flavor and is perfect for a cool,light summer dessert. The pie was made with fat free sweetened condensed milk,lower fat cream cheese, and low fat Cool Whip and it was not lacking in flavor in the least. Because it is soooo simple I am sure this will be served often at our house all summer long.

Excellent.  I have made this a couple of times and everyone loves it.  We like it very sour so I added the juice of one more lemon and the zest of all the lemons I juiced.

I too have used the limeade and chocolate cookie crust.  Sprinkle some of the crust mixture into bottom of clear stemmed glass then add scoop of pie filling and alternate.  Add a twist of lime on top with some of the whipped topping.  Makes a beautiful dessert.  Yum - think I may have to do this for dinner tonight.

I made this for Father's Day as dessert. I used lower fat creamcheese and low fat cool whip and regular sweet and condensed milk. Used some regular coolwhip in the spray can to decorate the pie. I had enough filling for 2 pies. The filling didnt get as firm as I had hoped, but it could have been the humidity. Will make again possible w/ limeade, I think it will be like a KeyLime Pie :)

YUM! I am nearing the first trimester of my first pregnancy and the cravings have hit. My grandmother used to make me this pie in the summers when I was a kid. I probably haven't eaten a slice of it in over 15 years, but this was what I was craving. Oh man this stuff is delicious! Perfect for a warm day. So glad I could find the recipe!

I enjoyed this but found the texture to be a little too soft.  I know it's mostly whipped cream but I would like it to be a bit more firm.  Maybe freezing it would help.

This was really good and easy.  Just what a summertime dessert should be.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and added in lemon zest just because I had it.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and all the filling fit in my deep dish pie pan.

I really couldn't stop licking the spoon! This pie is very refreshing and has a great balance of tart and sweet. I do have a good bit of filling left over, so if it doesn't get eaten first I will probably be able to get another pie out of it. I will most definately make this again! Thanks for posting :)

I also found a recipe in a magazine similar to this.  It took about a 1/2 of lemonade concentrate with vanilla ice cream and a tub of cool whip.  Very similar to this, but this one is a bit more creamy.  I like the other one better for the texture though.

This is a very easy make-ahead dessert that's great for summer. And bonus...it doesn't heat up the kitchen! Put some grated lemon and fresh blackberries on top and it's pretty enough for company! Also, for a breast cancer survivor I tried pink lemonade and strawberries...yum!

I use to make this years ago and had lost the recipe. I was happy to find it again, used it  for my  daughters birthday 'cake" as she is not a cake fan and remembers eating it when she was a kid. It is easy and a perfect dessert for a hot summer day

Super high ratings from my family.  This was so easy to put together.  I used Lite Cool Whip & put it in the freezer instead of the fridge.  Great for a summer dessert!
