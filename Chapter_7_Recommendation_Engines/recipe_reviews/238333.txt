These were good, although they did not taste very "peachy".  They were the first thing gone at my church potluck though.  Easy to make with frozen meatballs (maybe fresh meatballs would have absorbed more of the sauce and made them more fruity tasting).

This was a hit.  I used fig preserves instead and people couldnâ€™t tell.  They were eaten quickly.

These were a huge hit. I ended up using peach-mango preserves and they turned out amazing. I wanted to make my own meatballs but ran short on time so I just used frozen ones and was not the least bit upset. People went back for seconds, thirds, and fourths until it was the first thing gone at the table.
