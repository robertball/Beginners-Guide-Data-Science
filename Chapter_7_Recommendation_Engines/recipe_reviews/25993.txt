This familiar recipe is like the one used by my mother and grandmother. It is much better with butter instead of shortening and increase the cocoa to 2/3 c for a chocolate boost.

This is fine. You have to make sure you boil it fully and it thickens as it cools so wait before you frost!

I use this more like a ganache type frosting. This is my go-to recipe if I am out of butter. Followed the directions and it has never been gritty like others have mentioned.

I used it to frost a chocolate cake and it works pretty well as a drizzle (using it before it thickens). I also added 6 squares of Hershey's milk chocolate to it which gave it a chocolate boost. Overall pretty good Frosting but not my first choice.

It was delicious! The only thing I would say was that the texture was more like a ganache not a frosting. And I really wouldn't say it was gritty because I sifted the sugar. Loved it!
