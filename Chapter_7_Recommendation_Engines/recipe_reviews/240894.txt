This was a big winner in my family. It was simple to make and we all liked it. I'm a vegetarian but the rest of my family is not. My kids are 4 and 7 and they both liked it, as did my husband. I did not add the chili powder thinking it might make it too spicy for the kids. We'll definitely have this again!

Excellent!  I used 2 green peppers instead of orange and yellow. 1 can of green chilies instead of jalapenos. Mexican cheese instead of cheddar. I put sour cream on the top before eating and ate with tortilla chips.  I will make again!

This was so delicious! My only changes were green instead of more expensive yellow peppers,added a can of diced green chiles (because I love them),used El Pato hot tomato sauce instead of enchilada sauce, and half pepperjack with the cheddar. A garnish of diced tomato and avocado topped it beautifully. What a great idea for a light, healthy dinner! Thank you R8DERMAN!

This recipe is great (im reviewing it as im eating the leftovers)! I messed up and grabbed the green enchilada sauce but it still tasted really good. Also added a small can of corn. Will certainly make again!!

This recipe was great!  I subbed pinto beans for the black (what I had in the pantry) and, after the realization that I didn't have the enchilada sauce I thought I did, I used plain tomato sauce mixed with some hot sauce for the topping.  I utilized my rice cooker to cook the quinoa while I sautéed the veggies and it all came together quickly and easily.  I left the cilantro out since my husband doesn't like it and just put fresh on mine.  We put this in whole wheat tortillas and it was a great weeknight dinner.  Definitely going into rotation - thanks!

Loved it, with minor modifications.  I cooked my own beans and made AllRecipe's The Best Enchilada Sauce (and it is - so good could eat it like soup).   I found the casserole "guts" to be bland, so added extra recipe spices of chili powder, cumin, salt and then added a little Aleppo pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika.  I also added 8 ounces of chorizo chicken sausage.  It took me about 3 hours to put everything together with all the prep.  I'm always slow the first time I make any recipe, and making everything (but the tomato paste in the enchilada sauce) takes time.  The end result was worth the effort and the two of us will have leftovers we'll enjoy all week.

I cooked the quinoa in broth (because I always do), used fresh parsley in place of the cilantro (because I don't like it), and sprinkled the top with only 1 cup of reduced fat cheese to cut calories and we just loved this.  We had it as a light dinner but would make a great side as well

The only change I made was to use green bell peppers as that's what I had on hand. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, it will now become one of our regular meals.

Excellent! I did add some corn. I also cut up tomatoes and put them on top of the enchilada sauce.  Added tortilla chips to the meal and homemade refried beans. Delicious!

I ended up not adding the enchilada sauce but just about 1/4 sharp cheese on top.  I added some sweet corn and tad bit more cilantro.

This has very nice flavor.  I followed the recipe as written. I grew up in New Mexico on enchiladas and I found this very satisfying.  The quinoa/bean/pepper base is quite moist.  I used red enchilada sauce.  In New Mexico tradition, I topped my serving with a fried egg and sour cream.  It was a nice, but not necessary personalization. We will have this again.

This turned out amazing. My husband loved it and didn’t even feel the need to add any spice to it. The only change I made was to use green enchilada sauce instead of red sauce.

This is indeed a healthy and versatile dish.  I made it once as is and the second time a cooked up 1 lb. of beef with taco seasoning and added it, along with a can of whole kernel corn, 1 cup of celery, and 1.5 cups of quinoa to 3 cups water.  I divided the final mixture and added hot enchilada sauce to one half and mild sauce to the other half to satisfy both tastes in my household.

This was really good and my family loved it. Had to replace the bell peppers with a can of mild Mexican peppers as my wife can't eat bell peppers. Added some crumbled taco chips to the top to add some crunch and it was a big hit.

Very good healthy Mexican food!  Used harissa oil instead of olive  for extra heat since I didn't use a jalapeno pepper.  Used low fat Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar since the store was out of 2% cheddar.

This was so yummy and it's a nice spin off of enchiladas and is slightly healthier. I actually think I prefer this over regular enchiladas. I used the basic recipe and added green chilies and ground turkey. As mentioned, this recipe has a lot of potential. I will definitely be making this again.

It was bland to my taste, but my husband liked it. I will try again but as some of the others said make some changes.

This was great!  I made my own enchilada sauce (Homemade Enchilada Sauce on AllRecipes.com) and added the juice of half a lime instead of just 1 t.  I didn't have jalapeno peppers, so I just added cayenne powder and some hot sauce to give it an extra kick.  The whole family loved it.  We will definitely have this one again!
