Really liked how this came out. Added 2 tablespoons of matcha instead, also added a small bit of sweetener. Overall, great recipe.

I used half chocolate cashew milk and half regular, added a little stevia, and skipped the whipped cream because I don't do dairy - tasted awesome!

I used almond milk and added a pkg of truvia for a little extra sweetness. Since this was my breakfast, I also added protein powder. This is a very good recipe which can easily be adjusted for personal tastes.

Refreshing and tasty! I did use almond milk. I also used 5 ice cubes, and it came out very thin, not like I would expect a frappe to be. Maybe increasing the ice cubes would thicken it? For the matcha green tea powder, I went according to the instructions on my container. It mentioned 3 tblsp, which I used, and this had very good flavor. I also used a packet of Stevia and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract for in place of the sweetener listed. Thanks for this good drink recipe! Oh, just realized I forgot to add the whipped cream....next time!

I added 2 cups of ice cubes, but it was still not thick enough so I added an extra cup. It was very bland, even with 1 1/2 tsp of matcha powder. It will be a good recipe with some adjustments.
