This recipe was great. I made it as a cake as well as cupcakes, and they
were both delicious. It's a fairly simple recipe to follow, and everyone will be
extremely appreciative when it's done.

This was very easy to make and very chocolaty.  It didn't take long at all to mix up, and was very moist.  The frosting is excellent, too.

Didn't like how this turned out at all. It was mushy and heavy. The frosting was wonderful but is probably the only thing that my daughter liked. Won't try this again.

How sinfully delightful! Talk about decadent! I've been making the Hershey's chocolate cake for just about every special occasion for the last year and it's the perfect cake. We made this one for my son's Cub Scout Cake Auction and my husband (who's supposed to be on a diet) made the highest bid and brought it back home! We doubled the recipe, and made a 4 layer cake and also used whipped cream frosting with chocolate instead of the butter cream (which is also absolutely delicious!). We also put my son's pack number in candy M&Ms instead of just sprinkling them on top. It was huge and heavy - almost looked professionally done - sort of! Even though he didn't win top bid, he did get the award for Looks Like Yummiest Cake! Great recipe - give it a try - you'll never go back to boxed cake again - I promise!

I'm sure this is a great cake, but I tried to make it at 5000 feet and it fell.  I would love it if someone would put a chocolate layer cake recipe for altitude on this site.  I seem to be stuck with Betty Crocker as my only answer.

Good recipe. Great presentation. I would actually recommend using chocolate chips instead of Hershey's kisses (sorry Hersheyâ€“ I love you, I do) because it was just too overwhelming for the individual slices when cut. I also would probably have preferred a vanilla icing, but that is just personal preference.

This is delicious!  I made it for my 7 year-old nephew's birthday party and he loved it!  I made the cake in two 9" layers exactly as written, but frosted it with chocolate whipped cream frosting ('Cool Whipped Frosting' recipe from this site).  I mixed some of the frosting with crushed Oreo cookies to fill in between the layers and decorated the cake with Oreo cookies.  It was a huge hit and I will be making this again and again.  Next time, I might add cinnamon and coffee powder,as one reviewer had suggested.

I love this cake! I actually made it for my husbands Birthday last year. He enjoyed it so much that he requested it again this year.
I use the Whipped Cream Frosting with Cream Cheese from this site. YUMMY

Oh my!  Perfect, moist and sinful!  Yum!  I swapped the kisses for Oreos because it's what I had on hand.  It made the perfect Birthday cake!

This was INCREDIBLE! I made it as a cake for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and it was a huge hit. My cakes always fall (no fault of the recipe, I'm sure) so I tried to hide the dent by sprinkling colored confetti sprinkles on the frosting. I then added the Hershey kisses and it looked beautiful, dent and all. It was a tremendous hit; everyone loved it.

I tried this again but made it into cupcakes, instead, because I didn't want to deal with another fallen cake. I used sweet mini-morsels to decorate the cupcakes. They were a huge hit, too. I will DEFINATELY use this recipe again, we all loved it!

This cake was delicious!! I made it for my daughter's 1 year old B-day party and everybody loved it.  It was a big conversation topic.  I have to admit that I was a little worried after I added the cup of boiling water, cause it was really runny.  But it turned out perfect.  I used whipped cream cheese frosting... Delicious!!!  Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitively make this cake again.

Very simple to make. Turned out nice and moist. The icing was a bit runny and very very sweet.
Overall a wonderful cake.

My six year old daughter, her six year old friend and I made this for my husband for his birthday.  It was easy and quick and everyone LOVED it.  I usually alter something in a recipe, but this one I followed to the letter.  I will definitely make this one again!

When I first made this cake, my husband and I were both disappointed.  We loved the cake and we loved the frosting, but we didn't think they went well together( I didn't add the kisses), but then my hubby came up with the good idea to top individual slices with a strawberry sauce ( the kind you buy in a tub in the freezer section).  We have now changed our mind that this is the best cake ever.  The stawberries tied everything together.  Excellent

This is a really good, moist, easy to make cake. Tastes just as good the day after.  I made the cream cheese icing too but found it very sweet so mixed cocoa into it to get a chocolate icing instead.  Tasted great this way.

This is a great chocolate cake recipe.  I actually frosted it with chocolate frosting.  I was just looking for a really good rich, moist cake recipe and this definitely was what I was looking for!  I recieved many compliments on this cake.  Batter was really thin after adding the water, but cake turned out great!

I tried this recipe several times, I added 3 tsp. cinnamon powder & added 2 tsp. instant coffee to the hot water. This is great! I didn't use the frosting, I prefer to use chocolate frosting with this cake. I will do it again and again...

I love this cake but the frosting I will pass on next time I make it. I will do chocolate or maybe cream cheese. But the cake so outstandingly moist and so yummy. Its a pleaser.

I liked this recipe very much.  I made it with my son on his 9th birthday.  It was easy to make and it taste great.  The cake was rich but not too sweet so the frosting was a perfect match.  Everyone loved it.

EXCELLENT...FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AND CAKE TURNED OUT PERFECT. I DID HOWEVER USE A DIFFERENT FROSTING.USED THE WHIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER READERS. IT'S A KEEPER.
