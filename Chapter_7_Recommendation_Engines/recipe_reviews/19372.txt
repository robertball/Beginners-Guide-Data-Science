Very good recipe.  I modified it a bit.  I flavored the cottage cheese with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.  Instead of simmering in milk, I made a white sauce from butter, flour, milk, curry powder, saffron, salt and pepper...Yum!  I found that simmering the dumplings in the sauce for 20 minutes more than sufficient.

Jodi! This is a KILLER recipe! Absolutely delicious and easy to do! I plan to make these very often, and during berry season, I will add a little sugar to the cheese and some blueberries! Yowza! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm sure this could turn out well, but I made this when I was first beginning to cook. I had big problems keeping the stuff inside. It tasted pretty good, but it was also really messy.

Definitely needs modification. Prepared like this, they are flavorless and the texture is awful. Perhaps would be better with mods, but I will not make these again!

These were on the messy side, but good when all through.  I used a little bit of heavy whipping cream to make the sauce a little thicker.  I will try them again sometime.

My grandmother (from Vilnius, Lithuania) made these all the time.....called Peedagaechee (phonetic spelling).   Slight variation......she mixed the cheese (she used farm cheese) with an egg, some salt and lots of black pepper.  After making the dumplings she dropped them into boiling water and removed them with a slotted spoon once they floated.  Place in a casserole dish and dollop with a little butter so they don't stick together.   Keep warm. Saut√© 1/4 to 1/2 lb of salt pork, sliced very thin, until crisp....set aside.  If there is a lot of grease in the pan drain some off, reserving about 1 - 2 T.  Add at least 1 cup of sour cream to the drippings and heat thoroughly while scraping the pan.   Add reserved salt pork and pour over dumplings.   A great side dish in places of potatoes....and wonderful for breakfast!  Truly, in a pinch you can use frozen cheese ravioli

These are great but much better when you bake them till golden brown instead of fry. Then  instead of evaporated milk i used whipping cream and add dill to the cream, bring whipping cream and dill to a boil then add to dumplings and bake for an hour instead of simmer on stove.

I followed the recipe without any modifications at all.  It needs more flavor, but otherwise it's a good recipe

My family( from Lithuania) boil these dumplings in lightly salted water instead of milk. Then when cooked and drained, we pour melted butter and a bit of pepper on them. Yummy.
They can also be filled with a minced meat and onion mixture, boiled  and then served with a bacon and cream sauce. Double yummy.
