FANTASTICO!!  This is by far the simplest and most flavorful arroz con pollo.. I have tasted so far! This has the southwest flair!! I'm so impressed with this!! It's not greasy at all, the chicken was moist and the seasoning was very subtle on the chicken.. But when combined with the rice and beans (which had the bolder flavor)..it  balanced each other out perfectly. The only additions I made was I added 1tsp of adobo seasoning To the chicken (next time I'll probably add 2tsp+), I also added  2 minced garlic to the onion and rice mixture and used Goya black beans ( I just drained them..didn't rinse).. Other than that I sticked to the recipe..If you have any leftovers it's great reheated the next day.. The only other suggestions I would make is cook the chicken on medium heat...brown your rice on medium heat and stir constantly or else your rice WILL burn (so have your sauce and water already prepped to pour in) it also took me 12 min.. to brown my rice. Lower your heat very low when your simmering everything so your liquid doesn't evaporate so quick that your rice doesn't have a chance to become soft.. (it took me 30 min. For my rice to soften and then After that I turned the heat off and let it sit for a few min. With the lid on.. Just to make sure.. Cause I hate crunchy rice.) Everyone who loves Mexican food MUST try :-)

I got a thumbs up from everyone in the family when I made this dish.  I loved how easy it was, too.  I've already been asked when I'm going to make it again!  It will be a new addition to my dinner menu rotation!

My son found this recipe and we cooked it together. He already wanted to add some red/yellow/green peppers and chili's to the basic recipe:) Cayenne Pepper and fajita seasonings as well. We also used boneless chicken breast and cut it into quarter-inch square pieces. Brown Rice works well...just a bit longer cooking time. Yummy!!! This is a good basic stating point and you can easily add your own punch to it. We've already made it twice in 2 weeks....the second time we doubled it so we could have left-overs:) It is a family fav already!! Sorry ladies...my son is getting domestic for his future wife!!

I was looking to make something with minimal ingredients and little time tonight since I have spent so much time cooking this week. After several amazing meals this one sure fell flat. Very bland and boring. It was edible and that is about it. Will not make again it needs much more flair.
