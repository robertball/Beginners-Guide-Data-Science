I know I already reviewed this recipe once, but I made it again this weekend.  I sauteed the onions and then put the rest of the ingredients with a ham hock in the crock pot.  I used two cans of white beans.  I added elbo macaroni already cooked just before I served.  Sprinkled with parmagian cheese and served with garlic rolls.
good dinner

So very good!  I threw everything together except the noodles in a slow cooker, I used a smoked ham hock as well.  My  8 year old son loved it.

This is a very good recipe. Similar to my Italian mother's and grandmother's. A couple of tips: Go easy on the carrot or it will be too sweet. Also put the cooked pasta only in the soup that you intend to serve right away. For leftovers, I keep them separate or the pasta will soak up all the liquid.

This was a big hit in my house.  I have traveled Italy extensively and this recipe tasted like the Pasta e Fagioli I have had while there!  I used a nice piece of salt pork instead of the ham and then cut back on the salt and it still came out great.  My husband does not like beans but loved this!

I just threw everything in the crockpot, except the pasta. I added it about 45 minutes before serving. The recipe itself has fairly simple taste to it. But that is usually how Pasta Fagioli is. It is like a very mild minestrone. I increased the garlic and  added a little bit of fresh sage to mine. And of course salt and pepper. The main reason I used this recipe is because I was looking for something to do with the ham bone. This was a nice change from my Navy Bean Soup but I don't know if I will make it again.

Lack of flavor comments had me add the following and it was GREAT according to my family.  2 cans of tomatoe paste, 12 chopped garlic cloves. spinach, chicken broth (instead of water), Penne Rigate pasta (visually more appealing than macaroni,)  and 1 can each (red & light red) kidney beans with a can of cannelli beans instead of dried to add color and ease. ENJOY!!!

I've gotten recipes off of this website for years and this is my first review.  This is the same recipe that my italian father used my whole life.  I was happy to see that it was on here.  I changed a couple things to try to make it my own.  I used 2 cans of navy beans instead of the dried.  I added 2 small cans of tomato paste, and I added a bag of baby spinach.  It was so delicious no one could stop eating it!  We will keep this recipe for the future.

We enjoyed this soup.  I had to add a lot of chicken broth at the end because I had apparently not used enough water to cook the beans.  I thought it could have used more vegetables and less pasta.

Awesome soup!  I don't eat meat, but my husband and kids said this was great. My husband said he'd give it 4 3/4 stars.  Used leftover Christmas ham.  Added some fresh basil and fresh oregano toward the end.  Served with "Easiest Focaccia Recipe" bread from this site, and some fresh Parmesan cheese.  A big hit with my meat-eating family!

A very good recipe.  Though I must say, growing up in my house (my family coming from near Naples south to Salerno) "Past'e fasule"  was not a soup.  It was pasta, beans, sometimes pancetta or other ham-based meat, and a thick sauce. The sauce could be tomato based or white, similar to an alfredo. And sometimes it would be merely olive oil, or oil and butter, with pepper and salt. Sometimes anchovies were even added, with a little basil, garlic, and parsley. Sometimes just butter, pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, and grated cheese. Past'e Fasule was a versatile dish: Pasta, beans (and though usually white beans such as Cannellini or Great Northern, they could also be Cranberry (Romano) Beans, or Kidneys, or even Fava beans. I once had the dish with black beans -- not traditional but still satisfying).  As with Minestrone, there is great latitude for inventiveness.

this was awesome..... I didnt measure the water, just covered my ham bone with water and added a ham boullion,and a chicken boullion cube.cooked til beans were done and added everything else to the pot and cooked til carrots & celery were done. I incresed the veggies to 4 celery and 4 carrots, 1 onion and the 3 cloves of garlic, then added 2 cans of italian diced tomatoes (14.5 oz cans) added my cooked pasta at the very end. this was delicious, I made it 2 times in 2 weeks and the first time I used 2 cans of white northern beans and the 2nd time a bag of white northern beans, both were equally delicious. thanks so much for a wonderful hearty soup.

Who knew? What an awesome use of the leftover ham and bone.  This makes a lucious, hearty soup no matter how you may change it to your preference. The ham give it a rich wonderful flavor.

Thank you for giving me a good base recipe! I did as others suggested and used chicken broth, used more garlic, a small green bell pepper (diced) and more carrots (chopped baby carrots). Needed lots of salt and spices to jazz it up a bit. I served the soup with warm Italian bread.

I doubled the recipe because I had such a meaty ham bone and used dried canellini beans.  I thought the broth was weak, so I added some ham buillion.  It was pretty good, but it seems like it could have been better.  Maybe it could use some Italian Seasoning.  We added parmesan cheese at the table.

I included two cans of chicken broth for part of the 10 cups of water.  Then I  put all the ingredients in a crock pot (except the noodles) including two cans of cannelli beans (instead of steaming beans) and slow cooked for six hours.  It was good, but not great.  Needed more flavor.

Very delicious. Added more garlic for flavor as others indicated. I forgot the pasta, but did not miss it. Plenty of starch in beans.

i made this in the crock pot. and used kidney and navy beans from a can, as that's all I had in the cupboard and needed to do something w/the ham bone!   This is very very good.. I undercooked the macaroni just a titch.. knowing that I was going to freeze and reheat individual servings.  This way the pasta comes out ok.   I always add more garlic and herbs then most recipes call for.. same here. I also added just a dash of red pepper flakes for a little zippy heat.   very very good soup base recipe!!!

I was certainly impressed! My only regret is that I should have made only a single serving of pasta and added pasta as I went along--I am only one person, and there is a ton of leftovers! Really tasty, though. Hearty, delicious, and not "beany" like I feared! Yum!

the recipe was a little confusing with ref to the amt of water & some of the ingredients but it came out wonderfully.  By the way, my last name is italian for beans.  We've made this a number of different ways.  This is an excellent version.  Will use it again.

The directions for this recipe call for hot pepper flakes, but they are not in the ingredient list. Also, parsley is listed in two steps, but how to divide the parsley listed in the ingredients is not specified.  I must have totally improvised incorrectly because I thought this soup was very bland.  I finally added some left over puttanesca sauce, which made it palatable, but not good.  Substituting chicken broth for some of the water may have helped, but I would never try again or recommend this recipe.  I rarely make a ham, and love using the bone for soup, so I feel like I wasted a ham bone opportunity on this.

This was delicious.  My finace' and I loved it.  My sister is settling into a her new home, so I took some to her with bowls, spoons, and cornbread to heat up as her and her husband were hungry.  It was so good I just had to share the yumminess!
