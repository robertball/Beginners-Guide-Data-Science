Excellent! I loved the ginger and berry taste with the orange juice. Will make again and again!

Up until making this smoothie I had never tried gogi berries. In fact I can't figure out a comparable taste to describe a gogi berries, but they're good...maybe think cranberry craisins but not tart. Warning if you don't like ginger you won't like this drink.

Really nice!!! I loved the freshness that the ginger adds to this drink. I added some ice so it would take more the consistency of a smoothie. A healthy and refreshing way to start anybody's day.

Refreshing with the touch of ginger and goji berries. A great way to jazz up orange juice. The smoothie is not thick, but very tasty. You probably could blend the ice to make it thicker.

Great flavor. I often make orange-ginger juice, but I never would have thought to add goji berries, but it adds a nice touch and a bit of tang. I wouldn't exactly call this a smoothie (not thick at all), but it's definitely a very tasty juice. Thanks for the recipe!
