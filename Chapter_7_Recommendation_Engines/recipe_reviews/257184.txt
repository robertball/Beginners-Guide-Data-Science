I added more chicken just because I had leftovers.  I did add the eggs which I was reluctant to do.  I thought is was better that veg beef soup I make all the time.  The addition of the eggs was great.  I will make it over and over.  You could use store bought rotisserie chicken if you work or need something quick and easy.

This has to be one of the perfect diet foods! I used shredded chicken (from a deli rotisserie chicken), added celery, steamed green beans, leftover roast corn cut from the cob, and a couple extra carrots. It was so hearty that I didn't even miss rice or noodles. Excellent recipe!

This is fantastic comfort food on a chilly day! I saw some of the suggestions in the reviews saying to add more herbs, so I added fresh cilantro, dried oregano and dried basil, and it was awesome! Used celery instead of cabbage, red onion instead of white onion and one Idaho potato instead of two small red potatoes. Also, the egg adds such a delicious touch.

As written this is bland and in need of herbs. Easy fix though so I'm giving it a 4 star.

I had some leftover turkey and was looking for a good soup recipe. This was it! I only added carrots and celery because that is all I had on hand. I have never heard of adding eggs at the end but they sure made a difference! Thanks for sharing!!!

Found it a little bland as well. I suggest adding basil and oregano while simmering. Othetwise a great soup!

This soup turned out great! Very soft delicate taste that didn t overwhelm me. I had to make some adjustments for my diet but still used mostly the same recipe and cooking instructions and it s the beat I have ever had! Added extra veggies and chicken to have leftovers for the next few days!

This was a quick easy and filling soup. I made slight modification in that I used orzo instead of potato and celery instead of cabbage. I was going to leave out the eggs but I am so happy I didn't...It made the soup even more hearty.
