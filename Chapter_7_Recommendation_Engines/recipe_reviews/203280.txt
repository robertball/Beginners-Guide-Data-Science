Excellent frosting.  I don't like store bought frostings, but I thought I'd give this a try because of the nutella.  I used sugar-free nutella because it's what I had on hand and it came out perfectly delicious.  I imagine it would be so much better, but sweeter with the regular nutella.  I made a 2 layer cake and topped my cake with a cherry and some crushed hazelnuts.  There was plenty of frosting for a nice thick layer.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really yummy.  The only change that I would make is to add at least 2-3 tablespoons of milk, because the consistency is really thick and slowed my beaters down!  The milk smooths it out and makes for a creamy, delicious frosting.

I'm not a big frosting fan, but the added nutella decreased the richness.  The combination of this with the cookies was a bit hit in our household.  Would not change a thing!!

What a great idea to make regular chocolate frosting taste like it came right out of a bakery.  I love chocolate frosting, but I don't want to take the time to make it from scratch, and canned chocolate frosting just isn't good.  Thanks for the idea!  By the way, don't add any water.  I added just a tiny bit, thinking it would make it more spreadable.  It did, but it was a little gooey.  Don't change a thing in the recipe.

Very easy and delicious. I agree with the other reviewers, this frosting is pretty thick. I added about 1 1/2 tablespoon of milk.

Frosting was much too stiff and did not whip up well until I added some softened butter. Then it was great!

This was super easy n quick to make. My electric mixer is on stereroids, so I opted to just blend/mix with a rubber spatula and it worked fine. Turned my plain lil yellow cupcakes into a heavenly lil treat. My hubby says they are a "WIN". Thanks for sharing.

t worked! It had a deeper flavor than just the can stuff, and surprisingly even after i added the powder sugar it wasn't too sweet.

I know it's not fair to rate a recipe if you're going to change it, but I thought others who think most frosting is too sweet would like to know that it works just fine if you mix the can of frosting with the entire 13 oz jar of Nutella. I wanted more of a hazel nut flavor and to reduce the sweetness more. I used 2 t. vanilla and left out the powdered sugar. It is still pretty sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.

I really like this because it adds a little something to the store bought chocolate frosting that is too thick and artificial. I also like the nutella because it breaks up the chocolate frosting with chocolate cake. I also added some softened butter to the recipe because it was thick.

It was easy but the chocolate frosting over powered the Nutella.

What an easy fix! Tastes amazing and is super easy and quick. I had to add liquid to mine as it was a bit too thick to frost what I needed, but consistency is in the eye of the baker =}
