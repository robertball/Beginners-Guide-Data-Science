This was so easy and fast.  I also tried it with pineapple chunks.  I accidently made it too thick one time so I added some white wine.  It cut down the sweetness a little bit.  We liked it.

this dish was o.k., but sauce needed a little kick. next time i will add a bit of fresh ginger and red pepper flakes.
