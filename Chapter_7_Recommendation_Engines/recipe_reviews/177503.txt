Easy and tasty!  I used Bisquick, and I only had regular chicken broth so I added a couple cloves of minced garlic.

Loved them!  Very similar to 'Cheddar Bay Biscuits'.  The only change I made was to use home made chicken stock and minced garlic, but they are wonderful!

I cut this recipe back by half. I did NOT have Campbell's Roasted Garlic chicken broth, what I did use was homemade chicken broth and a teaspoon of garlic powder. These actually were quite tasty, I was very surprized. I would make these again but I think I would brush butter over the rolls before baking next time.

These biscuits were good. I used regular chicken broth. I enjoyed them but didn't care for the bottoms to be so crisp. What can I do to make the bottoms softer?
