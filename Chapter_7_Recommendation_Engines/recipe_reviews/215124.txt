I put this up yesterday and was able to get 20 half pints.  I only added 1 teas of cayenne pepper and the rest of the recipe I kept the same.  I tasted it and it is very good.  The consistency is that of apple butter and about the same color.  I think this is going to taste really good with pork chops.

Imagine A-1 steak sauce with an extra kick.  I make this for my husband, and to give away as gifts; this year I added grated zucchini.

Made this last week since i was out. Made 8 750ml jars (big batch) used my apples and plums from the trees. Holy smoker doodle dandy im using this recipe from now on
 The only ingrediant i changed was a 3 tbsps of matouks hot sauce, rather than cayene.
I must say it adds a kick.
