This will be a regular side dish at our house!  I was short on time, so I used a bottle of italian salad dressing and it was delicious :)  I'm sure the red wine Vinaigrette would be great too!  Will try that next time when I'm not so pressed for time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! I cut the Quinoa down by a lot but used the same amount of veggies, cut the oil in half in the dressing, it was really good. I was a little nervous b/c i tasted the dressing and didn't really like it--but i put it in anyway and it was a fantastic complement! Thanks!

Excellent salad! I'm always looking for gluten free recipes and this is one of the best. I loved the dressing so I added extra. Taking it to a potluck at work today!

The dressing for this salad is out of this world! I crave this salad. I have used light olive oil in place of the canola oil and I use trader joes sweet/hot mustard which give it an extra special taste. I love that you can use whatever veggies appeal and I use half the amount of quinoa cooked in chicken broth. If you love quinoa sald and want a new and amazing recipe you have to try this one!!

Wow! This was excellent! The only thing I did differently was I added broccoli and I used red pepper instead of green. Also, I was real short on time so I used bottled organic italian dressing. The colors in this dish are beautiful:) I cannot wait to share this with my family. I am sure it will become a staple in our home. Thanks so much for sharing.

A little dry for my tastes, i usually cook the quinoa in more water, and I would definitely up the veggie ratio in the future to make it more salad-like.  Otherwise decently tasty.

So awesome. What a great summer side salad or add some chopped chicken and make it a meal!   I cut the quinoa in half, used a yellow and orange pepper, 1 cucumber, used Kalamata olives, small broccoli florets, and an extra tomato. Also cut the oil in half in the dressing. SO DELICIOUS!

Great gluten-free & vegetarian dish. Hearty enough to be a meal. I halved the recipe since 4c of quiona makes a ton! I only gave it 4 stars because the dressing was a bit too tart for me, so I added a couple pinches of sugar to balance it out a bit. Otherwise, this is a definite keeper!

This is an awesome salad!  Beware if you are using a powerful blender like a Vitamix and cutting the oil in half as some have suggested... it comes out VERY thick, like pudding!  But still incredibly good.  I just folded it into the salad and it worked itself in just fine.  But there will be NO liquid dressing.  Also, I used Kalamata olives because that's what I had and I also added about 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese.  DELISH!

I'm trying to use more quinoa in our family's diet because it is such a healthy whole grain and I am always trying new recipes I find here on allrecipes.com.  This is my new favorite!  The dressing is what makes it, so take the extra time to shake of the ingredients in a mustard jar.  I add diced carrots and celery, just because I had them and a cup of frozen corn for color. I omitted the olives because I don't care for them.  This was so tasty!  Thank you for sharing!

Loved it! Fresh and healthy.  Scaled the quinoa to just 1c to 2c of chicken broth to cook it in. Used 1 large cuke, 1 red pepper and kept the other veggies the same. I also used 1/4c red vinegar,  2tblspns of olive oil(which was plenty), a pinch of salt,  pepper,the lemon juice and 1tblspn of dijon. Excellent and so good served cold. Thanks!

This is a fun, easy recipe. Everyone at the bbq LOVED it.  I did 2 cups Quinoa 4 cups water in the rice cooker. It cooked the Quinoa perfectly! and then for the dressing i did. 1/4cup wine vinegar and a 1/2 cup light olive oil.  I also did not add the green pepper because i didnt have one. it was really, really good.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I had to adjust the dressing.  As per another reviewer, I also found the dressing far too tart and had to add sugar. I've made the dish several times, and just love it with the dressing amendment.  I've added feta cheese, chopped, sautéd asparagus and other vegetables.  And it`s good in the fridge for at least 3 days - if it isn't eaten up before then;-).  PS. to cook quinoa properly, twice as much water to the amount of quinoa is required.

I have made this twice and tweaked the recipe the second time...much better! I used olive oil instead of canola oil and didn't want to go through the pain of using a blender again, so I just whisked the dressing. I also cooked my quinoa in chicken stock instead of water for more flavor. I forgot about the lemon while I was making the dressing, so I squeezed the lemon over it and stirred it at the end. I'm sure it was more like a Tablespoon of lemon instead of a teaspoon, but the recipe was delicious!

Great.  Nice and flexible to add whatever veggies you like/have on hand. I too use olive oil.  I used the vinaigrette dressing (scaled down)as a chicken marinade once, and it was really lovely too.

Delicious! I can't stop eating it!! FYI, don't use 4 cups of uncooked quinoa unless you are going to feed an army. I wouldn't use more than 2 cups of uncooked quinoa and double the vinaigrette recipe to ensure everything is coated.

Served this at a potluck and it was a huge hit!!  I only used about 2.5cups Quinoa because that's all I had, but kept the same amount of veggies and dressing.  Will be making this one again!

I've been looking for a good Quinoa recipe and this was great! I would recommend less quinoa to balance with the veggies. I would add more dressing next time. It will soak up by the next day. Also, I added crumbled feta which gave it just the right kick!

I was hesitant putting 1 cup canola oil in dressing it seems kind of excessive.  I just made this according to recipe and it is FABUUUULOUS!  I did add red, yellow and orange peppers along with green pepper.  This is a nice salad to keep on hand.  I will make this often.

This was delicious, but I did make a couple changes to the  recipe so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for the original recipe. For the dressing: I added 2 cloves minced garlic to the recipe, and also about 1/2-1 tsp of sugar. I think this really rounded out the flavor of the dressing better (before it was a bit tart). I also added Feta Cheese and used Kalamata olives instead of black olives to the salad and that really kicked up the flavor. Also added an orange bell pepper.
I thought the quinoa to water ratio was perfect--I used to use the recipe off the trader joe's box, which calls for way more water, and I always had too much water after cooking. This amount was perfect; cooked 15 minutes.
I also only refrigerated the quinoa for about 10 minutes and it was still great!
We will definitely have this again!

I did really like this but thought there was too much oil. I will cut that back next time. This is a great dish for a hot day! I was looking for something to use my garden tomatoes and cucumbers and this dish was a home run! Thanks, we will definately make it again.

I absolutely love this salad.  I have made it regularly all summer.  It is so tasty and almost addicting.  I halve the recipe and my favorite addition is to put a whole (minus the stem) jalapeno pepper (including seeds) into the blender while blending the dressing.  It adds a little extra zip, but is not overly spicy.  I also use a spicy brown mustard.  YUM!

We LOVED this salad!  What a great summer dish.  The only thing I added was some yellow pepper (just for color and because I happened to have one); I used grape tomatoes (because that's what I had on hand); and omitted the olives (because we don't like them).  To save time, I didn't make the dressing - I used about a half bottle of Brianne's French Viniagrette.  Yum!  My husband and 18 month old loved this.  We will be making this again soon!

What a healthy and refreshing salad, especially for the summer months. I also added crushed cashews as a topping, and cut the veggies into bigger chunks.

Great way to use quinoa.  I cut the recipe in half, but only used half of the quinoa.  Next time, if I cut the recipe in half, I will use 1 c. quinoa and 1 c. water, cooking it for 15 min.  I also added some blanched, chopped fresh broccoli.

I have made this repeatedly.  I love it!  I use 3/4 cup olive oil and add a bit less quinoa (3 cups).  My quinoa requires 2 cups water per cup of quinoa in a rice cooker.  You really can add what you want to in terms of vegetables.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and absolutely
love it. At first I made it exactly as specified but have tweaked the amount of oil down to 3/4 cup and slightly more lemon (1 1/2 tsp). It is so light and fresh tasting and everyone remarks what a perfect dressing makes the salad.

Like so many other reviewers I made changes mainly to reduce the quantity. I used only one cup of quinoa so I cut back on everything else, especially the oil.  One cup of quinoa still produces a pretty big salad.  I think this recipe is gréât. I made it for myself but would also serve it to company. It's always nice to make it yourself instead of buying it at the deli counter. It also keeps in the refrigerator very well. Really enjoyed this!!!

This was great.perfect for the summer and you can adjust the veggies to make it your own. Oh and the dressing is FABULOUS, I am going to try it as a marinade and also as a salad dressing.

I mixed this in with artisan green lettuce, as I wasn't sure the kids would eat just the quinoa.  Also reduced the original serving size given.

Delicious! Left out olives because I don’t like them. Considered also leaving out the onions as I generally don’t like them raw but glad I kept them in. Doesn’t take as long as the recipe says - if you chop everything in advance and don’t count cooking time, probably only takes about 20 min. Recommend!

Great recipe, makes a massive quantity of salad! Enough to last you all week.  I did half quinoa-half bulgur (mainly cause it's cheaper, but also to mix things up a bit).  Definitely tastes better the next day.

Wow! Fresh, bright, healthy, easy and economical! I halved the serving size and  reduced the oil based  on other reviews. Used left-over quinoa that had been cooked in vegetable broth. The quinoa was in a two cup container and packed to the rim (think take-out rice packed).  I believe the amount of quinoa called for in the recipe would  be a bit much. What a great way to use some left over veggies.  I added chopped fresh parsley when serving because it's abundant in the garden right now. This will be great for  lunch tomorrow with some avocado.  The options are endless, maybe some chopped spinach,  garbanzo beans, a jalapeño to spice it up!  What a great recipe to have on hand. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing salad. I used a brown rice, quinoa and chia seed mix and baked a salmon fillet with cherrie tomotoes to sit on top. Left over salad was delicious with tuna stirred through the next day for lunch. Will definitely make this again!

Very tastey!  Crowd pleaser. I did change a few things up, used 2/3C oil, cut quinoa in 1/2(as others had suggested) added1/2C vinegar, couple carrots and a handful of fresh parsley. Lastly tossed in some crumbled feta just before serving. Omitted olives( I love them but everybody else doesn't)wit

Dressing needs work. You don't need that much oil. I used half a cup of EVOO. It needs sweetness to balance out the tartness so I added a couple teaspoons of honey. Also added a clove of grated garlic to give it more flavor. I added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

This was very good!  Beware-it makes a TON!  I used a bit more water to cook the quinoa in as the normal water to quinoa ratio is 2:1, so I went a bit in between with about 5 1/2 cups water to 4 cups quinoa.  I added a bit of chicken bouillon and salt to the water before adding the quinoa for extra flavor.  I also doubled the vinaigrette as it was too dry.  Many of my guests had never heard of quinoa and loved this recipe!   Very easy and tasty!

This dish is delicious!  I took the advice of some reviewers, and only used two cups of quinoa/two cups water.  I added orange/red/yellow bell pepper for color.  And lastly, I sprinkled feta cheese into the salad.  It is so very good!  The only reason I did not give this dish the full five stars is because of the 'fat factor'.  I felt so guilty using all that oil!  I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 cup smart balance.  The next time I make this, I am going to experiment with a 'lighter' version of the dressing.  Overall, I highly recommend!

Just made this and it was a huge hit! The only things I changed was that I made 2 cups of quinoa instead of 4, and used a red pepper instead of green. Otherwise, I kept all the other ingredients the same. Two cups of quinoa was plenty. This is a great salad that I plan on making a lot in the future.

Not bad. I did not like the dressing after I made it.  I added more vinegar because it was too oily.  I also added a little sugar. Once I tossed it with the veggies (I used way more veggies and less quinoa) it was pretty good. Took it to a school function and a lot of people liked it, including my 14 yr old daughter.  I thought it was pretty good, while not my favorite. It is healthy so I will keep the recipe for an occasional side dish.

Love it!! You can add pretty much whatever veggie that you want. It's even good if you use brown rice rather than Quinoa and have it taste just as good.

Made a few changes: omitted the olives (having falafel as well - salty enough!) and added chopped fresh cilantro and orange pepper.

As per other reviews, I made half the amount of quinoa, but the dressing the same amounts except only half the oil. it was extremely tasty, and the fact that it's good for you is just bonus.

Very light and refreshing. This will become a regular at our house! I cut the quinoa to 3 cups, and I increased all the dressing ingredients by half except the oil because there was a lot of quinoa, and it would have been bland without the extra dressing. I used olive oil because we prefer its flavor, used grapes tomatoes cut in thirds, and added about 1 cup of chopped carrots. The only thing I would do different next time is to cut the quinoa to 2 cups.

This is the first Quinoa recipe I have ever made and I have to say it is DELICIOUS!!!  Like other reveiwers, I only used half the amount of oil (just to cut out some fat) and only have the amount of quinoa, because I am the only person in my house who will likely eat this. :o)
You could pretty much use any veggies you have one hand, but its the dressing that makes this salad sooooo good!  Thank you for sharing

I would've rated it higher, but there are ONLY 5 stars. Love, love, love this recipe!  Since there was so much quinoa I didn't combine it with the the veggies until I served it at the table and everyone drizzled the dressing to their taste. I'll use the leftover quinoa in another recipe. I also substituted summer squash for one of the cukes.

LOVE the dressing (although I cut the oil in half)!  Great combo of veggies & quinoa.  Very quick - the hardest part is chopping the veggies.  Yum.  It's a keeper.

I loved this! What a fantastic way to use quinoa. I cut the quinoa and dressing in half, but not the veggies. Excellent! I will definitely make this again. Thank you!!

Yum!  I never thought to use quinoa in this way (like a pasta salad).  It was very good- just be aware that this recipe makes a TON!  We only had 2 1/2 cups quinoa, so we used that with the regularly listed amount of veggies and dressing and it still made so much we barely had a bowl big enough to fit it in.  But we ate it for lunch all week it was very tasty.  This would be a perfect healthy side for a summer BBQ.
