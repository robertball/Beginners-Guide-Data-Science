This was fantastic. I loved the flavour. I ommitted pouring the butter over the meatballs, and used garlic and herb chicken stock. Added some fresh black pepper and served it over steamed brown rice with grilled veggies. My family loved it.

These are requested now for family gatherings. To make it easier I now just add the bread crumbs to the meat mixture instead of rolling the meatballs in it. Very good flavor!

I included this at Hubs' request as part of our New Year's Eve array of appetizers. I wasn't enthusiastic about it but surprisingly found I was a lot fonder of them than I thought I'd be.  But I did bump up the flavor a bit since I noticed that other than some salt, pepper and a little onion it was totally lacking any seasoning. I knew some garlic, fresh parsley and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce couldn't hurt.  More important, it wasn't until after I had the meatballs mixed up that I realized, to my surprise, that the bread crumbs weren't intended to be included in the mix - rather, the meatballs were to be rolled in them.  Frankly, that seemed odd to me, so I'm glad I made the "mistake" of adding the bread crumbs, the traditional way, to the meat mixture.  But it's really the sauce that brings these meatballs to life - creamy with a pronounced fresh dill flavor.  These were part of our assortment of appetizers for our New Year's Eve celebration, but the ample amount left over will be great reheated and served over hot, buttered noodles. Four stars rather than five simply for the instruction to roll the meatballs in bread crumbs rather than adding them to the meat mixture.

I have a love/hate relationship with this recipe. I've made it a couple of times now. I guess I love the idea and how it CAN turn out. I like to add the bread crumbs to the meatballs instead of rolling them in it - makes a great meatball! But as written they are WAY too salty, so you have to cut the salt by at least half. The sauce is nice, but tends to need a little tweaking to be interesting. Its great comfort food and worth making, but the written recipe is just off enough to ruin it if you aren't careful. I'll probably make a version of these again anyway - and probably never would have if I hadn't found this recipe, so thanks! :)

This recipe is great. I have served it as many parties and everyone ask for the recipe. I used pre-made meatballs which cut down on time.

This is really not very good, unless you like a VERY sour-cream-y sauce, much more so than a stroganoff.  We had to toss the sauce!

This recipe was a hit and very filling!
I used premade meatballs and cooked the meatballs and sauce together before serving.  I also served the leftovers over rice and with a salad for a light dinner.

Meatballs were a bit bland, I would add a little cracked pepper and a little bit of season salt additional.  The sauce was great and made up for it.  Great recipe

This was a great recipe. I used only ground beef for the meatballs, but otherwise followed the recipe very closely. The meatballs came out like a dream and the sauce was really great. I will certainly make this again! Thanks.

I had high hopes for this, but was utterly disappointed. My observations:

1. Chicken stock and sour cream: NOT a good combination. Maybe with a better base, the sauce might be a bit more palatable. 
2. 2 teaspoons of salt is quite a bit. The meatballs themselves were quite salty, but otherwise rather tasteless. 

Overall impression: The Danes (if this indeed is a traditional danish recipe) should leave meatballs to the italians and swedes.

For the meatballs, I used equal parts pork and beef and they were among the most delicious I've ever had.  I know many people suggest substitution of frozen meatballs, but I'd really only support that idea if absolutely necessary.  The homemade variety is really worth the effort.  Also, I added some cornstarch (I know, I know) to the sauce to thicken it a little more.  The dill is just brilliant and with the homemade meatballs it elevates a common and tired entree to something you'll be excited to make.  Highly recommend.

I'm really only rating the sauce as I needed a quick fix when my husband made kofta and used a few too many red pepper flakes.  In order to save my mouth and this dish I made the dill sauce and served the kofta over Brazilian Rice (recipe also on this site) and ladled the sauce over.............WOW what a lifesaver and so tasty.  I'm sure it's divine over the meatballs in this posting as well.  I'm going to try it tonight over beef tenderloin.  Thanks so much for the great sauce.

This was REALLY good!  I love the dill with the sour cream and it was so easy to make.  I served over brown rice w/side of veggies.  The meatballs had a great flavor and really weren't too time consuming either.  Glad I found this recipe, I don't cook much with dill, but really enjoyed the flavor-1/4 cup is a perfect amount!  Also, forgot to get heavy cream for the meatballs and just used regular milk instead.

i made my own meatballs, which are always a hit, but wanted to try this sauce.  i really wanted to like it, but it was way too much sour cream taste.  it wasn't terrible, but i knew my family wouldn't like it.  my husband stepped in and added garlic, some italian seasoning, and parmesan and that made it better, but it's not something i would make again.

A huge hit!  I only used beef, though I kept everything else the same.  Everyone love it, and I can't wait to have it for dinner again.

I tried this sauce last night with store bought turkey meatballs and made rice instead of pasta. I also added a bit of parmesan cheese to balance out the sour cream taste. Everybody loved it...all went back for seconds. No leftovers this time.

Even after many mishaps (not reading my directions quite thoroughly enough), these turned out great. Turns out that you can accidentally skip the heavy cream and the meatballs will still turn out fine. I'll try it the right way next time, though. I think also in the interest of cutting down the expense, I might not use all three meats. I'm not sure how this will change the character of the meatballs, though.  I followed suggestions to put the breadcrumbs in directly with the meat, which also seemed to work well.

This was good!  I used all ground beef because that is what I had.  Cut down the salt and they were still a little salty to me.  Overall the whole family liked them.

This is my new meatball recipe!  I had to modify it based on what I had on hand, so I used all pork, half & half, and seasoned breadcrumbs (which I mixed in with the meat).  I served the meatballs over rice and poured the dill sauce over it all.  It was delicious!  My 3-year-old even dipped her meatballs in her dill sauce.

Sauce was OK, I can imagine using it for other things like the other reviewers mentioned.  But the sauce is not flavorful enough for these bland meatballs. Mine were dry and lacked flavor.

Loved the dill sauce! Would be FANTASTIC on salmon. I overcooked the meatballs (totally my fault) so I don't think it was as good as it could have been otherwise. Fantastic sauce though - really fantastic!

Just made this recipe. Absolutely loved it. I actually read the reviews after I made it. Don't add the bread crumbs to the meat mixture. That is what keeps the moistness in them. I don't usually cook with much salt. I figure it can be added after the fact if needed so I just did a slight sprinkling with Himalayan salt. Also used a low sodium chicken broth. I generally make my own but didn't have enough so had to purchase. The key to any sour cream recipe is to never boil sour cream. Take the flour, broth and butter once thickened off the burner and let it sit for a couple minutes. Then put in the dill and sour cream. Turned out amazing. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is different from what I usually make and I like it.  I used only lean beef as that is what I had on hand.  I did use more dill as I do like it too.  I ate it on noodles but this would be great as an appy as MPFEIFFER states.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

The meatballs were excellent. I cut the recipe in half for me and my husband and there were no leftovers!! I served the sauce on the side as my husband prefers the meatball naked and used ground beef in place of the veal. As mentioned by another reviewer, I just mixed the bread crumbs in with everything else to save time and would do it again.

Good.  I used pre-packaged meatballs and I really think that fresh made meatballs would have made all the difference between good and great.  Next time I will make the meatballs here.

Love this!!!  I used a pound of pork and omitted the veal. I've been looking for this recipe because I remember it from my childhood. The meatballs are incredible. They are always gone before the sauce, so I freeze extra sauce and serve it over store bought meatballs for a fabulous weeknight dinner.

Delicious sauce, firm meatballs.  Would skip pouring butter over the meatballs before they bake, and next time will use less butter in sauce--it separated and looked bad when served.  Tasted great.

These could be good if you use HALF the butter, light or non-fat sour cream and half-n-half rather than heavy cream. Very, very greasy. The sauce needs some seasoning too. Cracked black pepper, and possibly a dash of nutmeg. Some sautéed garlic would be a nice addition, too. Two stars for a lack of seasoning, and too much fat.

We used premade meatballs and beef broth instead of chicken broth.  The sauce was really good and tasted great over egg noodles.  It is a really rich and filling meal.  It would probably make a great appetizer meatball for a party.

The meatballs were bland, they definitely need the sauce.  I did like the idea of baking them, though, instead of the usual sauteing.

Hubs love the meatballs were amazing he said!  No need to add the heavy cream, instead I added Worcestershire sauce, more onions,  and garlic.  Turned out VERY tender.  He was not a fan of the sauce but I LOVED IT! Will be making this for company.   I served the entire thing over fettuccine. I did add a pinch of cumin to the sauce -- kicked it up a bit AND the dill was grown in my garden :-)

Melt 1/2 cup butter on low heat with 3 cloves of minced garlic until butter is barely beginning to bubble. Stir in 1/4 cup of flour. Increase heat to medium. Gradually stir in 1/2 cup chicken stock, 4 tablespoons lemon juice. Bring to a boil for about 2 minutes until it’s thick. Keep stirring! Add 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 2 cups sour cream, 3 tablespoons minced fresh dill. Reduce heat to low. Stir in 3 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper. Set aside sauce. I used store bought Rosina brand Italian meatballs, prepared as instructed on package. Once meatballs were baked I placed them all in my crockpot and covered them in the prepared sauce. Set crockpot to keep warm and ate the meatballs after at least 30 minutes of marinating in the sauce. These are even better the next day because they’ve had time to really soak in the sauce!

I made 1/2 the recipe and I’m sorry I couldn’t rate the meatballs (had some in the freezer I needed to use) but that sauce is AMAZING and would likely make cardboard taste good! As with some other reviews I cut the butter by 1/2 (used 1/4 c)with great results and because I can’t possibly get enough dill I added the whole bunch. Served with noodles, YUM! Absolutely will make again and thx for the recipe.

I made this tonight and enjoyed it and will make it again.  I read through most of the reviews and decided 1) added mushrooms and garlic to the butter before adding the flour.  2) only added 1 cup of sour cream and 1 tablespoon of dried dill.  Dried dill is stronger than fresh.  And 3) added a little cracked pepper.  
I used frozen meatballs, added them to a slow cooker and then poured the gravy over top and let them marinate all day.  Very good on a cold day.

This sauce was really good. How can you rate a recipe on too much fat content. If you don't like the ingredients that are in a recipe don't make it. If you are concerned about fat content you can use reduced fat sour cream and less butter which makes no difference in the taste of this and therefore still deserves a good rating. I didn't use this recipe for the meatballs because I had some in the freezer to use up. I didn't have fresh dill so used 1-2 tsps of dried dill. We enjoy dill so this was the right amount for us.

I used Kroger homestyle meatballs because I didn't feel like making them myself. I put in a lot of fresh dill and some dry dill because I wanted more flavor. Everyone liked it but next time I am going to try beef broth instead of chicken. Or stir in a pack of brown gravy. It was really good but the sauce was a bit light compared to the meatballs.

I only used beef and pork 50/50, also left out the onion per my taste, and used panko brad crumbs for extra crunch. This is a wonderfully different meal served over egg noodles. I have made two more times and will continue to make this. Thank you for sharing it!

I made this recipe using packaged meatballs and my husband and I thought it was fabulous.  I even halved the amount of butter in the sauce and didn't miss the butter flavor at all.  A real winner in our book.

I love dill, but I found the amount in this recipe to be way too much. Yes, I know its a dill sauce, but I didn't expect the dill to be so overpowering. If I make this again, I will reduce the amount.

Not knowing actually how my grandmother made her meatballs. I saw Danish and said "Okay,I will try this." For an old Danish farm boy they are great. I have made them three or four times now. You don't have to use veal, 1 pound of bulk pork will work.  Mix in your bread crumbs into the meatball mixture. I didn't have good results the other way.  Also,a lot of people are saying  to leave off the butter on top before baking, and using a little less sour cream, or use half and half instead of cream in the meatball mixture. Now that I'm close to 50, I'm going to agree, in my 20's I would have said it's a sin. Thank You So Much For Sharing this recipe.
