Very good - as everyone said - it's a little cake-like, but definitely has the texture of a soft bread.  And once it's toasted, it's out of this world (slice it thick b4 toasting). The sweetness is sublte onced it's done - just how we like it.  (Similar to sweet Hawaiin bread)  I use either currants or small dried blueberries. I think raisins are too big for this bread. I've also used this to make french toast.  Slice it then let it sit out for a day to get drier.  Taste and texture is like brioche. I've also added a little buttermilk or milk, whatever I have one hand, when my dough is a litte too dry About 1-2 tablespoons at most. (1 pint sour cream = 2 cups) Tip- cover tightly with foil after it's done and let it steam for 30 min. or longer.  This will lock in the moisture.  A trick for all loaf breads.

Wonderful! I considered using other recipes but decided on this one because I didn't have buttermilk, which seems to be used in most recipes. This is moist and dense and has a lovely texture. I added 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds and shaped the loaves into freeform rounds on a greased baking sheet (wet your hands with a bit of cold water to facilitate shaping). I also used a pastry brush to apply some melted butter halfway through the baking time. The breads were golden and crusty and absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again - and not just on St. Patrick's Day - as a base for bread pudding. No caraway seeds, of course. :)

An interesting version of Irish soda bread, but too cake-like for my taste and with far too many raisins.  One cup would be about right, I think.

Fantastic tasting recipe!  I have made the same Irish Soda Bread for years.  I couldn't find the recipe this year and tried this one.  I love it.  I like the cake-like texture!  A Keeper

Not really Irish Soda Bread but very good and easy.  I used low fat sour cream and it came out just great.

This looks good but I have one question:
Do you really make this Irish Soda Bread with no milk at all?

This bread was extremely easy to make. It's sweeter and runnier than normal soda bread so I had to make it in a loaf pan. Good for breakfast or a snack.

Very quick and easy to prepare, and incredibly delicious!  Cakelike, though not overly sweet, it can be enjoyed any time.  It goes VERY quickly in my house!

This recipe turned out great! I did do a few modifications based on other recipes and what was on hand but the end result was as close to perfect as I'm gonna get. First, I didn't have a full pint of sour cream so I substituted part buttermilk. As another reviewer said, the end result was too moist, so I added flour enough to work the dough. I set the convection oven for 350 because 325 seemed low. Instead of bread pans, I used two cast iron frying pans, as is - no grease, no flour. I sifted the dry ingredients a couple of times for even distribution of the ingredients. Then mixed in the wet ingredients just a little bit with a handful of raisins and maybe a tablespoon of caraway seeds. Then barely kneaded the dough and wasted no time getting the end result into the oven. Usually my soda breads come out a little bit dense and a little heavy. Not this one. It was nice and light, which was probably due to cutting way back on the mixing and kneading. Another recipe noted that the baking soda starts working as soon as it hits the buttermilk/sour cream and its important to work fast.

Loved it! Family Loved it! Never had soda bread before. It reminded me of a sweet raisin bread. Great warmed with butter.  I cut the recipe in half which made only 1 loaf.   Used 1 cup sour cream, only one egg and added 1/2 cup of milk. And made my 1/2 cup sugar heaping.  Doubled the raisins. The rest of ingredients just in half. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for an international foods luncheon at work and got rave reviews. I am not a good cook at all, and this was easy and turned out wonderfully my first time! One batch made 16 mini loafs (had to decrease cook time).

My family is very Irish.  My maiden name is O'Hern and my mother's is McCabe.  My husband's family is McCoullough, and McDounough.  Trust me I have tried MANY Irish Soda bread recipes...none as moist and tasty as this one!  A must try!!!  Can't wait to tell my mother-in-law that I found a recipe better than hers.  hehe!

Terrific recipe which I will make again. Used 1 c. whole wheat pastry flour and 3 c. white flour, along with lite sour cream. It was too sweet for my idea of soda bread, so next time will use only 1/2 c. sugar. Loaves were done after 50 minutes and looked nice enough to give as gifts. Followed a previous suggestion to cover with foil after removing from oven to let steam for 30 minutes. Worked great!

I've had people say "no thanks, soda bread is too dry." Then they taste this one.  It's almost more of a cake than a bread - very moist. I've been making it for years & I'll never get store-bought again! Happy St. Pat's Day!

I cut the recipe in half and filled up 12 muffin tins instead of baking it in a loaf. I baked it at 325 for about 50 minutes. I wanted to make sure they weren't doughy in the middle, but 50 minutes might have been a bit long when they're so small. They were a little crispy on the outside but perfect inside! I added my own mixture sprinkled on top before I baked the muffins (cinnamon, sugar, ground nutmeg & ground ginger.) That was a nice addition. I wouldn't recommend using paper muffin tray liners though. Because the recipe doesn't have any butter in it, the batter stuck to parts of the liners. Just greasing the muffin pan would have been better than using liners. But overall, I was happy with the recipe and the small changes I made to it. Went great with my corn beef and cabbage Irish dinner.

I really loved this bread. A member of a club I belong to made this for our annual corned beef and cabbage fund raising dinner. When asked for the recipe, she stated it was a family secret. This is the recipe! I guess the family secret is allrecipes.com I followed the recipe exactly except I had to add a few tablespoons of milk because the batter was too stiff, as suggested by another reviewer. Still tasted great! Thank you ladies for sharing this wonderful recipe.

i have 4  boys and we loved this!!Even when my parents came to visit they raved over this bread...After it was done baking, i brushed the top with butter and wrapped in foil like another review suggested to lock in the moisture. Excellent sugestion as the bread stayed moist for several days. Will make this again and again. WONDERFUL recipe. Thanks!!

This was an easy recipe and everyone that has tried it really likes it!  I would check on the bread towards the end though. When I checked on the bread 15 minutes prior to being done, it was already a golden color so I pulled it out, but that could just be my gas oven.

So good and very easy recipe. Batter was a bit dry so I added about 3 tablespoons of milk. I also baked it in a bread pan. Will make again but will add bit more raisins next time.

I made this recipe for the first time last year and it was a huge hit! This year when I made it, again, rave reviews!  I prefer golden raisins, and this year, I simmered them on the stove in plenty of Irish whiskey, removed them from the heat, covered and let soak up the whiskey (I actually simmered 2 cups, but only used one in the recipe).  When the raisins were cooked in the bread, they were plump, and had the slightest, really, ever so slight taste of the whiskey - one would have to know the raisins were soaked to identify the whiskey.  Just a fun little addition to Irish Soda Bread - excellent recipe!!! By the way, the extra raisins taste terrific over vanilla ice-cream!!

Delicious! I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, sifted 1 tsp of cardamom into the dry ingredients, then substituted currants for the raisins, and also added 1/4 cup of milk to the batter. It came out fabulous, rose beautifully, and had a nice golden color to the crust. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was fantastic. I can't stop making this. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and have been experimenting with different dried fruits. made it with dried mixed fruit and mixed dried berries so far. I think I like the mixed berries a little better.

I don't have a long history of eating Irish Soda Bread, but I love this bread. Our dear friend, Pat, can't wait for St. Patrick's Day every year, because I always make it for him along with a traditional corned beef dinner.  What a treat!  Thanks for a great recipe ladies.  P.S. I don't change a thing and make the recipe as written.

I gave this recipe 5 stars cause my husband likes it. He does not like Irish soda bread. This is a cross between cake and Irish soda bread.I cut the recipe in half. Put 2 eggs and 1 cup of sour cream. Made one loaf.Great warm with butter and a cup of tea.

This was terrific! After the first batch, I made a second batch and added shredded cheese to it, and some roasted peppers on the top, a wee bit of garlic and voila, a terrific accompaniment to beer cheese soup!

This is now my recipe for soda bread on St. Pat's Day. So moist, so good. But I made a few changes, i added enough flour to be able to shape the dough into a round loaf (probably another cup), slashed the top and baked till done (probably an additional 15 minutes).

Very delicious and easy to make.  Whole family devoured this (even 4 yr old and 2 yr old).  Made one loaf with caraway seeds and the other without.  Both were very good.  Definately did not think 1 c. of raisins was too much.  Bread has somewhat of a cake-like texture and I was worried it may be too sweet, but it wasn't.  You may want to watch while baking.  Was done perfectly in Pampered Chef Stonewear Loaf Pan in 50 minutes.

Nice-- dense and cakelike with a little sweet. I served it with corned beef and cabbage last night and toasted it this morning with fried corned beef and eggs. Delicious!

I made this last weekend and it came out wonderfully despite all the things I did wrong! I was out of sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt, added a splash of oil, extra raisins, vanilla and the zest of an orange ( I fear bland food)...It was excellent with butter and would make a great breakfast or with coffee treat! Thanks!!

I was looking for a recipe that didn't include caraway seeds (yuck!).  This one was very easy to make and tasty.  The recipe didn't specify, so I made one batch by hand and a second using my mixer.  The batch made with the mixer did turn out better. The mixing time was kept to an absolute minimum to keep gluten from developing.

I made this recipe at the request of my 1st- and 3rd grade daughters who wanted to bring an "Irish" snack to school for St. Pat's. They are fiercely proud of their Irish heritage. As am I...but I admit that I really hate making soda bread. Until I found this gem. It is super-simple, doubles very easily (one loaf for each girls' classroom plus one mini-loaf for my breakfast tomorrow...with some coffee and bacon, mmm!!!) It is not "authentic Irish" but you know what, neither is corned beef so screw tradition! If it tastes good, EAT IT!!! My only qualm was that it rises VERY quickly. Not a problem unless you double it in too small of a mixing bowl, then wham, batter dripping all over my countertop. So use a really big bowl. Forewarned is forearmed! It is quite sweet compared to the real deal, but I say go with it. I enhanced the inherant sweetness with a sprinkle of coarse sugar on top of the loaf prior to baking, and a cup or so of currants in the batter. Slainte!

If your looking for authentic, this is not it.  Irish people cook this in a large round rought iron pan and they do not add sour cream, instead use 1/2 stick of margerine and blend it with the dry ingredients until its like cornmeal.  Also, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg is optional, but nice!   Put a cross on top to let the devil out and bake for 40 minutes.

I have made this my new Irish Soda Bread recipe!  My old recipe was a dry and crumbly bread.  I've made 3 batches in the last week and EVERYONE who tastes it, loves it. Even DH who doesn't like soda bread can't get enough. In one of the batches I added ground caraway and sprinkled the top with a little cinnamon sugar. MMMM. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My daughter needed an Irish Soda Bread for an international food fair at school so we chose this one. It was a hit!  We loved it and so did everyone else.  It was easy to make and very moist and so much better than other soda breads I've had before.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this at LEAST once a year on St Patty's, but people start drooling around New Year's.  Awesomeness - exactly as it is.  I only put the raisins in some boiling water first to plump them a little.  Put a little real butter out with it - incredible!

I love this recipe! I use a bundt pan and sprinkle powdered sugar on top lightly. Makes a good-looking gift to take to a party, etc. This time I am going to mix raisins and craisins. Hope the luck of the Irish is on my side with this variation!

This was an excellant easy recipe.   My husband is not a big bread eater and he loved it!  It was moist and sweet.  I used Sun Maid baking raisins found in the same section of your grocery store and the regular raisins.  They are very moist and smaller... perfect for this recipe as some other reviewers mentioned regular raisins did not work well.

This isn't Soda Bread.  This is called Railway Cake.  I swear on my Irish father's grave that Soda bread doesn't have sour cream and raisins.  As far as a Railway Cake recipe is concerned, this recipe will do.

This was an excellent recipe! I was worried about the raisins staying hard, as there was little moisture in the dough, so I "marinated" them with a capful each of vanilla and orange extracts (a VERY good combination!) I also added about 1/4 cup milk, because my dough was too dry. The loaves came out perfectly. A very good, and very easy recipe to follow.

This bread was so easy to make, and was delicious! The two loafs didn't last more than 3 days. I made it with raisins, but am looking forward to trying cranberries, cherries and raspberries. Was excellent toasted with a little butter for breakfast!

Before I come across this recipe I had only had Irish Soda Bread once before at a Potato Bake, and I must say that this recipe was much more superior in taste! Yes it is a bit cake-like in texture, but I loved how light and moist it was! The only change I made was substituting currants for the raisins. The first time I made this recipe, I used plain yogurt (with an additional tsp baking powder) b/c I didn't have any sour cream on hand. Today I used the sour cream and it's just as delicious. Thanks Arlene for sharing your mother's wonderful recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to follow.  And the flavor of the bread is great!  Mine came out a little drier than I had hoped for, but next time I will follow the advice of previous reviewers and "steam" the loaves.  I did take the advice of another reviewer and used currants instead of raisins.

Fabulous, it's a keeper. I only made one loaf and served it with a beef barley stew. Every crumb was gone! Changes I made were to halve the sugar, sub plain yogurt for the sour cream and skip the raisins. I was sorry I halved the recipe because every crumb was eaten and I have no leftovers!  It's not the soda bread that Autn Mary made, it's better!

This bread is so delicious! I used one cup of wheat flour in place of one cup of white. I also used 1/2 cup of raw brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of white sugar. This is a great recipe - thank you!

Wonderful.  It was gobbled up at our St. Patrick's dinner faster than I would have anticipated!  I added an additional 1/2 cup of golden raisins too which improved both the taste and the look of it when sliced.

I used 1/2 of a 16 oz container of light sour cream, and a few tablespoons of buttermilk. I also used golden raisins that I soaked in hot water. I brushed some melted butter on top a half hour before taking out of the oven. Turned out just okay- a tad too sweet (but I did put green sparkling sugar on top-that could be it)- and kind of hard. I usually make a pretty good Irish Soda bread, so I think I'll probably stick with my old recipe. Maybe I didn't put in enough sour cream....

My family and I loved this recipe!  It is the perfect texture and sweetness.    I halved the recipe to one loaf when I made it the first time and just added 2 eggs insted of the 1 1/2.    Next time I will make 2 loaves and make one with raisins and one either plain or with chocolate chips!

I made this for my Irish grandma for Christmas, and she was so happy because it reminds her of her childhood, when her mother made Irish soda bread almost every day.  Also, I made it with mini chocolate chips bc I didn't have any caraway seeds--this was lucky because my grandma said they get stuck in her dentures! It was great with the choc chips.

I love this bread! It is hard to tell what it will be like when making it. The dough is very gooey, sticky and thick. I had to add a couple TBL of milk to help me mix the entire dough. I didn't use my stand mixer (attempted to do it by hand) but I think the mixer would make it easier. I used a mix of golden raisins and cherries (dried), I think about 1/2 cup more of fruit would make this amazing! Also about 1/2 way through I coated each loaf with butter. Be careful to put the same amount of dough in each pan, I didn't and had to leave one loaf in for an extra 10 minutes. Ate it warm out of the oven with some butter and coffee... what a great treat! This is a great breakfast item, or a light dessert. AMAZING!

This was GREAT for a themed St. Patricks day party.  We used real butter and jams, divine! Also tried lemon curd with it, that was the best.  The warmness is what makes this.

Great recipe! I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream and the bread was still moist and rich. Sprinkled caraway atop the loaves. Smelled great and kids loved it way better than the cabbage that came with the corned beef for our St. Patrick's Day dinner. (Big surprise!)

This was SO simple to make and delicious.  I added a handful or two of chopped walnuts instead of the raisins and loved it.  Tastes very similar to scones, but moister.  It's perfect for breakfast with butter or cream cheese and makes a nice snack, too.  I warm it in the toaster... YUM!

I must admit that I made a few changes.  Due to a wheat allergy, I used 2 cups brown rice flour, 1 cup soy flour, and 1 cup wheat free gluten free baking mix.  I was out of sour cream, so I used 2 cups cottage cheese mixed with 2 T milk and 2 T white vinegar.  The mix was a bit too dry, so I added a bit more milk for moistness and baked in two 8 inch cake pans.  The bread was sensational, and no one knew that I didn't use all-purpose flour!

I made this bread with fat-free sour cream and orange flavored craisins and it turned out great.  The craisins infused the bread wih an orange flavor.  tastes amazing fresh out of the oven!

I love this recipe! To lighten it up I use low fat sour cream and egg substitute, and I use whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. I also bake it in a cupcake pan, so I get about 16 mini breads--great for work or social events. Great recipes!

This is wonderful and so easy to make!  I used 1/2 all-purpose white flour and half all-purpose wheat flour and added 1 tbsp of flax seeds and 1/2 a cup of chopped walnuts.  I can imagine all sorts of dried fruit, seeds and/or nuts being a nice addition to this bread.  I didn't find it to be cake-like at all, but then again, I did use wheat flour for half of the flour.  Either way, it came out beautifully, golden brown and not too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!

I served this at a Red Hat Society dinner for St. Patrick's Day and it was a big hit.  The fancy ladies abandoned all delicacy and came back for seconds and thirds.  I added a cup of coarsely chopped walnuts, just because.  This is definitely a recipe for the bread-phobic cook.  Easy, easy, easy.

This recipe was very easy and produced a wonderful bread; better still, the ingredients are those I normally have on hand.  The bread was very moist, and everyone enjoyed it at our St. Paddy's Day dinner.  Thanks!

Excellent, everyone liked this better than the traditional recipe saying it was moist instead of dry. I even used fat free sour cream. I wouldn't call it "cake like".

I baked this bread today and it is one of the best renditions of Irish Soda Bread I have ever tasted!  My guy had 4 slices before he finally slowed down - this is a recipe that I will use again and again.

I have been using this recipe for awhile now and I always get rave reviews. It is very moist and tasty. I prefer to divide the dough in two and place it on a parchment lined cookie sheet which produces two rustic looking round loaves.  Today I made it with a dried fruit blend mix from trader Joe's instead of raisins and it is quite delicious.  Great sliced and buttered but even better sliced, toasted and buttered. SO good!

Having not actually tasted traditional Irish Soda Bread, I can't comment on its authenticity, however, it was super easy to make (gotta love the bread maker!) and very yummy. And as toast the next morning - heaven!!

This soda bread is wonderful! It's really easy to throw together, and comes out nice and moist. I thought the sweetness and the recommended amount of raisins were just right. I will definitely be making this many times. Thanks for sharing!

It is really good! I halved the recipe and probably could've eaten the whole thing while it was still warm. The kids and hubby like it too. I put less sugar, but next time, I'll put even less sugar and less raisins. thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. The sour cream makes this soda bread more moist thatn your usual soda breads! I will only use THIS recipe on St. Patty's Day. For fun, I sometimes add some green food coloring (although, some people might think it's mold hehehe...).

If you are looking for a very traditional soda bread, this recipe is not for you. However, if you are interested in a bread that is sweeter than normal soda bread and chock full of raisins, with a fine texture, this is an absolutely wonderful bread! I love it with butter, but it really doesn't need anything - its very yummy.

finally a soda bread that is edible! I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf. Used 2 whole eggs and added 1/8 C. water since the batter was very stiff and thick. I'll be making this alot and not just on St.Patricks Day!

This bread is pretty good, the taste was great, but the only thing I wasn't crazy about was how dense the bread came out. I used non-fat sour cream which might have had something to do with the texture. I'll make it again with regular sour cream.

This is my first review written for Allrecipes.com.  I halved this recipe, using 2 eggs, because I only have one loaf pan.  Not only was this a really easy bread to make, but the results garnered rave reviews.  Just follow the simple instructions ("mix until just combined" -- don't use a mixer!) and you will be rewarded with a very tasty and versatile bread.  Thanks for posting, Arlene & Agnes.

This is such an easy recipe to do at the last minute when you want a home baked bread.  My son, who hates cakes, is always asking for this bread.  Recently he suggested cinnamon to be added and it was delicious.

To me a reason for giving 5 stars is that I will make this recipe again.  That's the case with this soda bread.  Have made it more than once now and it seems to evaporate into thin air.  This batch got an excellent rating from an Irish friend who knows more about soda bread than I do.  For my latest batch, I wrapped the loaves in a damp tea cloth while they were hot.  This made a moister crust which I prefer. Easy, inexpensive and yummy.  Try it toasted!

This was very good--a big hit in our home. Loved the cake-like texture. Great toasted for breakfast and also as a snack. I ended up adding 1-2 tbsp more of sourcream for moistness. Yummmm!

I have to say that this is a wonderful recipe, My girlfriend had never had Irish Soda Bread before and when I made this recipe she fell in love with it at first bite. It is even better toasted and goes wonderful with a cup of coffee.

Very tasty. I used two eggs to make a half batch. I tried to change things up by using chocolate chips alongside the raisins, but the raisins were much better.

This was the first Irish soda bread I'd ever made. It was a real winner for me. I didn't change anything about the ingredients. I baked it for an hour and it was done. Also, I let it rest for about 10 minutes before baking. Thank you for a wonderful bread!

This bread is super tasty! I cut it in half because I only have one loaf pan. Also used fat free sour cream, it turned out moist and delicious. Will make this one any time so easy to make.

This is much richer than the normal soda breads (I have been making soda bread for too too many years).  Also far too much sugar so is really a sweet bread used for slicing with tea in the afternoon.   Could almost be called a dessert bread.  Certainly tastes good..........but a bit sinful for this type of bread and certainly too sweet to serve with a meal.

I served this on St. Patty's Day 2008 for the neighbors and us. It really stole the show. I used golden raisens instead. I also put all of the dough in one pan and just kept it in a little longer at a slightly lower temp. It is very moist, no one will mind that it is not like "traditional" soda bread.

easy to make, but i thought it was a little bland.  substituted half the sour cream with yogurt.  my husband didn't seem very excited about it either so probably won't make it again.

very good, moist, and DELISH! yummy, and i used a bit less sugar then recommended, to help cut down the calories a bit, but still it was sweet and yummy. my mom bought some irish soda bread from the store, and it wasn't half as good as this. this was much, much more moist. 5 stars to this one!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it last year for St. Patrick's day.  I liked it so much, I have been making it ever since.  The recipe is perfect as is, if you try any other recipe, you'll just be wasting your time.

Very good and moist!  Used Golden raisens as suggested because we are not big raisin fans.  We had it for dinner on St. Patty's day and again for breakfast the next morning with a little cinnamon!

I made this for St. Patrick's day & I too added a Tbp. or two of caraway seeds but other than that made no changes to this recipe....I loved it! I made an Americanized version of Irish stew (no lamb) & served this alongside...it accompanied the stew much like a sweet cornbread. Will not wait till St. Patrick's day to have it again!!!

i just whipped up a batch of this, and since i don't like raisins cooked in things i used dried cranberries. it is still in the oven so i don't know how it will taste, but i have to wonder...one comment said the mixture was runny and mine was not. mine was thick and sticky, like usual sodabread dough, so i wonder if i did something wrong?

as far as rating it, the dough tasted delicious so i am assuming the bread will as well. it was super simple to make although i did have to work to get all the dry stuff mixed in.

This is a great Irish bread recipe I use currants instead of raisins. The recipe is missing one ingredient that is water you can't mix this into a batter unless you add some water it's just too dry. Every body who tries this bread loves it.

I have never received more compliments about anything I have cooked than this. My husband said it should be the one thing I bring with when we are invited somewhere. Cake like and moist.

I made it for a dinner/meeting when someone else made the Irish Stew.  The bread went very well with the stew as much as a soup spoon !!!  Everyone really liked it.  The next day, with what I had left-over, I made toast.  That, too, was very good.
Just a couple things I did different with the recipie, was leaving out the raisns and slightly beating the eggs together before adding them to the dry mixture.  And near the end, added a couple tablespoons of water to pick-up all of the dry mixture.  It was suggested to me to make this one of my regular "Bring A Dish To Pass" items.  And I will !!!

I've made a couple of different recipes of Irish Soda Bread before and they were good.  I only make it on St. Patrick's Day.  I was unable to make it today so my husband found this recipe and made it.  It's not "traditional" and I loved it!  This is the new recipe, and I might make it more often, now.  It's almost a cross between a biscuit and pound cake.  Everyone gobbled it up.

This recipe is very like an Irish teacake my grandmother used to make. I would add 1/2 cup of melted butter to make it a little more moist. The raisins are a must. Other adds that would give it a lift: orange peel (1 teaspoon) and/or caraway seeds!  Easy to make. I'm going to try again adding the orange peel and the melted butter for some additional moistness.

First time I made this tried to cut in half, but forgot to cut back on eggs and it was so good that now when I make it, I use 4 eggs for 2 loaves. I make it all the time and my husband & friends love it..Consider it to be one of my all time favorites.... SheilaR

Really tasty, both fresh and as toast or french toast.  I made it using sour dough starter instead of half of the sour cream.  Made for a dense loaf, but excellent.

This the best soda bread I've ever eaten.  It was moist and didn't taste like baking soda.  I gave some to my parents and they raved about it too!  I used white whole wheat flour for all of the flour and half the amount of sugar.

I've made this bread every year for St. Patty's Day for the last four years. It is always a big hit and everyone wants the recipe. Since I only make it once a year, it always surprises me how sticky and unweilding the dough is. And every year I get to the point of dumping it in the loaf pan thinking it will surely be a disaster, and it miraculously turns out great! (Must be the luck of the Irish!) My only variations: I put the whole thing in one large loaf pan and have always omitted the raisins. The finished product is definately sweet and could be used for a breakfast or brunch bread. Love it with tons of butter!

This bread was very moist and quite delicious.  As other reviewers suggested, after it is out of the oven, I brushed the top with melted butter and covered tightly with foil to steam for 30 minutes to lock in moisture.  Next time I will try adding the caraway seeds as others suggested.  I used 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of cran-raisins.  Delicious!!

I made this bread yesterday. I wanted to try it before St. Pat's Day. It is wonderful and very easy to make. It makes two nice loafs. I am giving one away today. I will bake it again for St. Pat's Day. Good job girls.

I make this recipie all the time, and love it... so does everyone else!!  I add a little more raisins, or switch it up to a mix of raisins and dried cranberries, or other dried mixed fruit.... it just makes each bite so much sweeter and tastier.  i also toast each slice and slather with butter... OMG !!!  I better stop... off to the kitchen to make a loaf...lol

I followed this recipe exactly but didn't get the 5 star results. Not what I expected.  This was not a very flavorful bread, too dry and it was indeed cake like.  It was better toasted with some butter.

I have been making this for years and it's always a hit.  It is definitely more cake-like then typical soda bread, but I prefer that to the typical rock hard that I've grown accustomed to.  Make this, but be prepared to get critiques from your strict Irish friends who like the dry bread they are used to.

Excellent recipe and easy to make. I ended up having to make three of these as the kids devoured them all instead of a breakfast of eggs and bacon. They were delighted to know that I saved the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe!  And I was SO dissappointed because this had such great reviews.  When mixing this dough, it was extrememly thick and sticky-- very difficult to work with.  I followed the recipe completely, and it came out dry yet spongy with absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  Totally bland, even with some butter spread on a slice of it.  MAYBE if you added some vanilla to it, and more sugar (it wasn't sweet at all) and tons more fruit (I used blueberreis) it might be just okay, but I wouldn't waste my time and ingredients again.

It had very good taste, but I found it rather dry.   Butter on it made it better!    I will make it again just to be sure it was not me screwing something up.

This was very sticky and hard to mix, I didn't know if you are supposed to just stir it or use a mixer. I stirred it, then had to just use my hands. I put in a TBSP caraway seeds, forgot the salt accidently, and had to sub 1/4 c mayo for part of the sour cream. I didn't like it as much as my other recipe, but hubby just said, THIS IS THE BEST ONE EVER. So there. Thanks for the post!!

I used reduced-fat sour cream, and it worked beautifully.  I mixed the sour cream, eggs and raisins together before adding. The mixture was a little dry, so I added a bit of buttermilk.  This makes great toast!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe is marvelous.  I do think that 1 1/2 of raisins would be better and plan to make it this way in the future. Best Irish soda bread ever made.

Delicious....tender, moist and delicate. I used splenda baking sugar instead instead of sugar and add 1 teaspoon of anisse seeds in addition to the raisins that I use 1 and half cup. This is the first time I try this kind of bread, so I don´t know if the original recipe calls for a dry bread, but I prefer a moist one, so this recipe is really a keeper for its simplicity and flavor. Thanks for sharing it.  Mery

Yummy! Very different from any Irish soda bread I have ever had but it tastes great. To me it is more like a cake. The only thing I changed is I added some caraway seeds to the batter. This will be a new addition to our Saint Patrick's Day dinner

Since my heritage is Spanish and not Irish, I have not been exposed to much Irish Soda Bread in my time.  After I married into Irish decent I've tasted the family recipe and found it to be a very dry bread but saw potential. This recipe has been the best Irish soda bread that I've ever tasted.  Very moist, not too sweet, just perfect!  Great to pair up with my morning coffee.  The kids LOVE it!  Hint:  Stir really well.

great recipe ! I have tried many and this one is really great. The batter was very thick and crumbly so I added about 2 tblsp. of milk, it rose beautifully and tasted great.This recipe made 5 mini loaves.(great for teachers & neighbors !)

Made this to accompany a corned beef and cabbage dinner over the weekend.  The bread is moist yet easily cuts into thin slices without much crumbling.  Don't be fooled by the super thick/sticky batter -- it raises beautifully.  Sprinkled caraway seeds over the raw batter prior to baking.  Delicious!

I married into a very Irish family and loved all the Irish foods and traditions I've been introduced to.  All was fine till this St. Patrick's day when it was my turn to cook for everyone!  I was so lost and decided to make this recipe.  Let me tell you it was so easy to do and the results were amazing.  The whole family couldn't get over how it came out so moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It was truly a lifesavor and I have a feeling will be a new favorite at our family gathers!

It tastes good. However... you are told to not overmix it, yet it needs overmixing in order for all the dry ingredients to finally be incorporated. The other thing is that you spend twice the time of preparation in prying loose the gooey, awfully sticky dough off of the beater, sides of the bowl, spatula, and your fingers. If not, half of it would be left sticking to everything it can.

This was so easy to make and turned out great!  I didn’t have any raisins so I used chocolate chips instead.  I love the crispiness of the edges and the softness of the center.   It is sweet and that is great for me.

We loved this. Will be good with soup also. I didn't have sour cream so used sour milk made with lemon juice and milk. Baked in a round bread pan.....made 1/2 recipe so  it looked more like a traditional soda bread. Did't even need butter.

Very good! Everyone who ate it, couldn’t get enough. I felt it was a little dry, but still delicious, so I gave it 4 Stars. Maybe I’ll try aluminum foil next time.

This was delicious! I added a splash of vanilla, sprinkle of cinnamon, and crushed fennel seeds. It turned out great. It wasn’t too cake-like.

Not your typical Irish Soda Bread, but delicious!  I cut the recipe in half (used only 1 egg) - added some anise seed since I was out of caraway seed. Sprinkled top of loaf with raw sugar before baking. This recipe is a keeper!!

Great recipe! I love raisins so I used 3/4 c raisins plus 3/4 c golden raisins and for my caraway lovers I also added 1 t caraway. The flavor was wonderful! I also liked it because it uses sour cream (which I always have) and not buttermilk which I never have. Definitely a keeper!

Cooking time is wayyyy too long.  Baked for one hour and it was rock hard.  Didn't check on it as I was outside.  Like a rock.  Also didn't seem to be enough moisture and way too much flour.   Didn't use my normal St Paddys day recipe and I regret it :(

This isn't the kind of Irish soda bread that I'm used to making, but it's very good! It's a cross between a muffin and a scone. I used my homemade yogurt in place of sour cream and the texture was absolutely  delightful!

Took this out of the oven about an hour ago and already I have eaten a third of a loaf. This bread is moist, not too sweet and taste great. The only adjusments I made were to add an additional egg and half cup of milk. PERFECT!

I really enjoyed this.  I don't think it's cakey the way some have described it.  I think it's just more moist than most soda breads.  It has a nice balance of flavors and isn't too sweet.  Best of all, it's extremely easy!  I'll definitely make this again.

First time trying this recipe. Used whole wheat flour, 4 medium eggs and about 1/2 the raisins. Was a little dry, but good. Served it with Corned beef, cabbage, etc. Very nice Irish meal. Beat the monotony of one more Italian dish. Family loved it.

This is really good. Its not traditional Irish Soda Bread and is more like a quick bread and cake like as others have mentioned but the taste is excellent. I didn't quite have a full pint of sour cream on hand so I topped it off with probably about a half cup of milk and it still turned out excellent.  Watch this bread closely while its baking as 60 minutes could be too long depending on your oven. I checked mine at 50 minutes and it was done and just on the verge of becoming overdone.

I used whole wheat flour and non-fat plain yogurt (I only had whole wheat fl. and yogurt) and 1/2 a cup sugar.  Turned out terrific, very easy to make!

I have been eating Irish Soda Bread for years but never attempted to make it. This recipe was So easy and delicious. I substituted currants for the raisins and I did add 2 tablespoons of Carraway seeds. My aunt who has made Soda bread many times thought this was awesome and asked for the recipe. It was great toasted with butter. I will be making this many times.

We all loved this!  I used currants, instead of raisins, as per another user's suggestion, and when my picky grown son asks for seconds on bread, it's a hit!  Yes, it is more cake-like and sweet than traditional Irish soda bread, but none of us ever liked the traditional recipe!  ;-)  Next morning, we had it toasted for breakfast, and it was even more delicious!

This soda bread did not bake in over an hour, and I made only 1 loaf. The ends, which were baked through, had a good flavor and texture but the rest was mush inside. I'm not sure why, as I followed the recipe exactly and my oven works well.

I also cut this recipe down to 2/3 to bake it in a 9x5 loaf pan and it turned out excellent. :) I'd never had a soda bread before and I was pleasantly surprised with how much we all enjoyed it. It's very similar in taste to a biscuit and yet sweeter... I baked it for closer to 75 minutes at 300 degrees and I used a wooden skewer to test for doneness so we wouldn't have a baked-outside, doughy-inside problem. Thank you so much for sharing, Arlene and Agnes! It's the best with butter and/or jam!

This is my second recipe/attempt at Irish Soda Bread.  This one turned out better than the last, but still not quite what I wanted.  I believe this would have turned out a little better if I had reduced the cooking time a little bit, it got a little too done.  The taste is good, more cake-like than the last recipe I tried, and not as dry.  Really nice recipe, but not quite what I'm looking for...Thanks!

This was the first time I ever made soda bread and I halved the receipe just in case, I had to go back and make more it was so good! So easy, even I could do it. And who doesnt have all these easy ingrediants on hand?! Great receipe! Can even make it healthier by using the splenda baking mix of sugar, and whole wheat flour, and fat free sour cream and it tastes just as delicious!

This was the first time I tried to make Irish soda bread & I must say , it was very easy & EVERYONE loved it! It is very heavy & dense. I was hesitant about the caraway seeds but, they also added to the wonderful taste & texture!
So I raise my glass to Agnes Waters & her daughter Arlene for sharing!!!

This was descent. It is moister than other soda breads. I added more raisons and a tablespoon of carraway seeds, but found it didn't have enough seeds for me. Which made it a little bland for my taste. I gave the extra loaf to some friends (who've never had Irish soda bread) and they say they liked it.
