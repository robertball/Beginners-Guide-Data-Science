I added onion and celery to this so kids get veggies in there sometimes I even add a little garlic clove for flavor and since I am pepper lover I use lots of fresh groun pepper. This also needs more cream 1 cup for sure.

Excellent recipe! I made this dish for Thanksgiving. I doubled the amount of crackers and added a half cup more of the whipping cream for a fuller casserole dish.

The recipe states that it serves 8, but I would say it serves 4 if you also have a salad. It was not very creamy. It had good flavor and it was very easy to make.
