Not only are these potatoes delicious, but they are an easy make-ahead side dish!  I made only 1/4 the recipe because there are just the two of us (along with a few tasters), and it filled a little 4x6 baking dish just perfectly!  I followed the recipe except for maybe going just a tad heavy on the yummy Classico Alfredo sauce (maybe 1/3 of the jar---but totally not necessary).  This is excellent, and it will even be adaptable to another dish---I'm thinking eggs.  Thanks so very much, Baking Nana!

I made this with a roast and it was a nice change instead of mashed potatoes. I added extra green onion and next time I make it I will add even more!  The overall flavor and texture reminded me of a baked potato with all the fixings.  Very good!

These are perfect with meats.  We had them with beef kabobs and they were the perfect compliment to the zesty grilled meat.  Very easy to make, I made 1/2 the recipe for the two of us with 2 servings leftover.  This is a real keeper!

I feel the instructions are a bit confusing; the tablespoon of salt, mentioned first, is intended for boiling the potatoes, and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt is for the seasoning. As for the consistency, my cuisinart food processor made these more like mashed potatoes. Next time I will use a manual grater.

I thought this was a great, unexpected twist for potatoes.  The flavor was great and the recipe was easy.  I served it with grilled chicken and steamed broccoli.  A great dinner!

I make these often because my family likes them a lot. Sometimes I grate the potatoes and sometimes I slice them, which I think looks better but makes no real  difference.  Smoky Gouda kicks it up a notch, and ever since I tried that, it's been the only way to do them.  If the cheese isn't grated, I just put slices over each potato layer, and that works fine.

No changes. Just did not like the sauce.

Flavor really good!  Instead of grating, I sliced the boiled potatoes really thin after cooling for about 15 min. Didn't have time to go through the refrigeration process and they came out great.  Ell make again.  Also cut recipe in half but used all the Alfredo sauce!
