Good basic flavor. I made my meatballs with ground venison and used store bought spaetzle. I thought the gravy needed a little something to kick it up so I added a tsp of worchestersire sauce, sea salt, and a generous dash of cayenne.

Now this is food that really schmecks! Wonderful recipe, the only change I made was to use half beef and half pork sausage since that is what I had on hand. The spaetzle was nicely tender and the sauce rich and creamy.

Because I'm lazy, after making the meatballs, I added the onion until tender, then added 1 can cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can water and 1 cube of beef bouillon. That's it. Excellent dish and super tasty!

My family loves this recipe!  I have been making it for years and I like to double the recipe because the leftovers are great.  My changes: I use two tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley in the meatballs for each pound of meat plus extra to sprinkle over each serving.  I also skip the poultry seasoning and the caraway seeds in the sauce.  I prefer to use fresh mushrooms instead of the canned ones called for in the recipe.  I lightly saut√© them in a small amount of butter or margarine before adding them to the dish. I use light sour cream to save on calories.  The spaetzle are great with this dish but I also have served the meatballs over steamed rice or wide buttered egg noodles with great success.  It is hard to believe that such a simple recipe would result in such a delicious dish!  It tastes like Beef Stroganoff, except with very tender meatballs and for a lot less money.

We enjoyed this.  The caraway seeds are such a nice addition, but not overwhelming.  My only changes were fresh mushrooms ... sauteed ahead, as were the onions.  Also added worcest. sauce & cayenne to gravy as suggested.  Not only will my kids request this, but they'll want freezer containers to take back with them.  Thanks!

Omitted caraway seeds, and used fresh mushrooms. The family ate it up and fought over the leftovers the next day!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was really good, but I did use fresh mushrooms sauted them with the onions in a little butter and i used fresh parsley verses the dried because I had it on hand. Mixed into the meatball mixure 1 teaspoon of fresh garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce as viewers reccomended. This is a 5 star recipe but for our taste liked the added ingredients and the spaetzle i thinned with a little milk to go through the holes in my colander spaetzle was so light and creamy. Was so good the next day for leftovers!
