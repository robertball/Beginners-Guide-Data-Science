Without a doubt, the finest muffin/butter tarts I've ever eaten. I replaced the 1/2 C. of regular flour with a 1/2 C. cake flour to give them some lightness, but other than that *****!

I know I have written review for this recipe before, but since then I have made at least three more batches & I found that the longer you leave these in the oven, the more flavorful & less eggy they before (I left them in the oven for 30 min once by accident, & they actually turned out very well).  Now I tend to bake them for at least 25 min instead of 15 to 17.

These are super!  They are very filling.  I've lost count how many times I've made these.  Thought it was time to review!  I used a little over 3/4 cup sugar.  I do bake them for at least 25 min at 350 degrees instead of 15 to 17 at 375 degrees and they have always turned out perfect.  Great warm or cool!

They came out tasting fantastic, dispite the fact that I screwed them up a little bit.  Distracted by my mother who came over to chat, I accidently added the baking soda into the rasin mix on the stove.  Oops!  Then, when mixing the batter, it became a very strange texture I could only describe as gluey, with little white chunks in it.  I'm not sure if that's how it's suppose to be or not, but as I said, they taste pretty darn good.  My grand-mother loves them (she is a buttertart fanatic!) so I will definitely make these again.

These muffins were okay. Interesting flavour. Didn't think they really tasted like butter tarts. They didn't all get eaten which is unusual in our house. They were a bit dry. May have been better if I had cooked them a minute or so less.

I had never heard of a Butter Tart before trying this recipe. However, after trying these little bites of heaven, I feel I may need to look into Butter Tarts. The unique preperation for these muffins make them a nice change from your run-of-the-mill blueberry variety. Some reviewers noted that the maple flavor wasn't strong...I used pure maple syrup and it really takes these muffins to the next level! I took these into work and they were gone in no time. I will definitely make these again!

Wonderful muffin - ravished by my children and husband. I did make a mistake and put the maple syrup into the batter before baking. I realised the error and added more syrup to the tops when done. I think it gave it a bit more of a maply flavour than otherwise and it still turned out great.

Shorter time prep than I had expected. I was expecting a heavier muffin but in fact it was very light and extremely moist. Delicious. Provided the kids like nuts it would be a hit with them too! Great with coffee!

This review is for all you high-altitude bakers. These muffins are good. By cooking the raisins they absorb the liquid and work well with the texture. I used cake flour in this recipe as it often seems to work better in high altitude. However I must note that you will absolutely need to lower the oven temp to 350 to get a nice rise.

Moist texture with crunchy exterior. Much closer to bread pudding in flavour than a butter tart. Definitely enhanced by the flavour of the maple syrup. I made these in mini-muffin tins for a Tea reducing the cooking temperature to 350 and the cooking time to approx. 11 minutes.

Loved these! I would not call them butter tart muffins but they are delicious - taste a little like raisin bread french toast. I forgot the nuts and it needed the extra crunch. Be careful heating the raisin mixture and not let the eggs congeal. Enjoy!!!

these are to die for. Do not omit the maple syrup it just gives that little bit more to these muffins. I like many others baked these at 350 for 18-20 min. Keep an eye on them they do brown quickly. I also used dried berry mix instead of raisins! YUM

A real keeper! My husband went wild for these muffins. We had fresh strawberrys left over so I relplaced the rasins for the stawberrys. He had me make a second batch to bring into his buddies at work. I'll be holding onto this one for a while! Thanks Joanne!

These were good but they are a very dense muffin. I made the recipe as is with one exception - I've never before had a butter tart that had maple syrup in it so I left that out. It was good but not sure I would make it again

I love butter tarts but not these. I found no resemblance between these muffins and butter tarts. I thought I had done it wrong the first time as the batter is as thick as cookie batter and I threw it out and started over after getting the same result twice I come to the conclusion that it was meant to be that way. They seem to cook very fast on the top tho so keep an eye on them we have a gas oven so things do tend to bake faster in gas. I will stick to proper butter tarts and give this recipe a miss.

This was very tasty. I used mixed dried friut instead of rasins. Although I really did enjoy the cake it was nothing to write home about... I don't think using just rasins would have made a difference. There just wans't that special "something".

I don't know why I kept looking at this recipe but I finally made it. Loved this out of the oven (after it was cool) - I don't normally like maple syrup but someone said it couldn't be forgotten so I did it. It made this great crunchy topping. I will decrease the sugar next time to about 1/2 a cup - it was way too sweet. I will also whisk the cooked mixture vigorously the whole time cooking as I did get scrambling in parts. Also baked it at 350 as suggested by others for 25 minutes. The boyfriend and roommate loved these! I'm dying to try the strawberry suggestion someone else made.

These were pretty good just not the knock out I expected. The mixture in the pan seemed lumpy (watch for the eggs becoming "scrambled"). I would give them another try though maybe with cranberries.

These are just ok imo. The taste is good but I found they dried out very quickly. The next day they had that day old taste to them. I think they would taste much better with buttermilk and maybe not dry out so fast.

I don't know that I've reviewed a recipe I thought unsatisfactory and I won't be breaking any habits with my review of these muffins. They are delicious! I have made them on several occasions and have a double batch baking as I write. I decided to read all of the reviews on this recipe in an effort to determine if my results were similar to others. Specifically that the muffins didn't seem to be quite done at 17 minutes. I've taken the suggestion of one reviewer in particular this time around reducing the temperature to 350 and increasing the baking time to 25 minutes. I think this will work very nicely. One review has left me baffled in that this individual found the muffins to be dry! I can't help but think that an error was made in the measurement of ingredients as I've never found these muffins dry. They are quite rich and very moist even too moist if not baked for an adequate period of time. All considered though these are highly recommended. I've not had maple syrup on hand on any occasion that I've baked these muffins and thus in keeping with the butter tart have used light corn syrup with great success. Thanks!!

Don't use muffin liners with these as the syrup drips down the sides and won't get soaked into the muffin if you use liners.

...Sweet..good texture with slightly crunchy tops...raisins kinda pop in your mouth when you bite down on one of these...Fill your muffin cups full as these do not rise (I ended up with 15)...I baked at 350 for 20 and left off the maple syrup...kids loved them right out of the oven. Hope they are just as good later...

These are very tasty I replaced the white sugar with brown sugar right away because I have never made butter tarts with white sugar and I think it made a difference very tender and they had a caramel like flavor along with the syrup.

Delicious! Excellent recipe for people who love dense moist cake-like muffins. I mixed brown sugar into the sugar required and also subbed some whole wheat flour for the flour required. Out of the recipe's 12 servings size I got 30 mini-muffins. They were a huge hit as a brunch side and a breakfast treat. I would definitely make these again as a dish to bring to a brunch or tea.

I just made a double batch of these and I have one word for them. AMAZING! The whole family loved them. I'm a huge butter tart fan and although not the real thing these muffins do have a butter tart flavour to them. They were moist soft and fluffy. Make sure you use pure maple syrup on them and not the fake stuff. Delicious! I will make again.

These won't last the day here they are that good. Didn't use nuts so increased raisins (1/2c)and forgot the syrup. No matter they're awesome. I could've just eaten the batter!

These muffins are delicious!! My bf said it's the best muffin he ever had and i totally agree with him! They smell heavenly when they're in the oven! May decrease the amount of maple syrup nxt time though since both of us don't have e sweet tooth. Overall these are excellent. Strongly recommend it!!

I'm not a huge fan of butter tarts but tried these out on my family - and thought they were quite good! Wonderfully moist and delicious and better than butter tarts in my opinion.:)
