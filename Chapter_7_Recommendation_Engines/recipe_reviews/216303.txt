Beautiful color on this dish and it was fast and easy to toss together. This was good but it just wasn't the traditional flavor I was expecting. My husband didn't say anything so I don't know if he noticed the difference or not. I only made this because I didn't have regular mushroom soup on hand. I didn't have any red pepper.  This was good and we were able to have our holiday green bean casserole, but I like the white sauce better personally. Thanks for the great substitute in a pinch, I wouldn't have tried this otherwise.

I like to add broken up water chestnuts for a little crunch, as well.

This is a great option if you want to switch up from the tradition green bean casserole. I was asked to bring a green bean casserole for Christmas dinner to my in-laws and there was nothing left! It looked very festive having the Red peppers mixed with the Green beans. Although when doubling this recipe I didn't double the green beans. 4 Cans of green beans was plenty. My husband decided he likes this more than the traditional way.

This is a great basic easy recipe for a green bean casserole!  I left out the red peppers and it still tasted great and my family ate it all up.  I used a half a cup of sour cream instead of milk to add even more flavor and it came out great.  I've been able to substitute greek yogurt in place of sour cream in every recipe I've had so I'm going to try that next for a healthier alternative.

Ohhhh, this was so good as comfort food.  It was rich, creamy, and had a nice, crunchy top.  Another plus was that it was really simple and quick.  I would definitely make this again.  Good with and without peppers.

I decided to shake up the Thanksgiving routine this year. Normally I make my green bean casserole with creamy mushroom soup so I thought the golden mushroom soup would be interesting. The dish turned out fabulous. The only changes I made was omitting the red pepper and adding chopped, crispy bacon. Yummy!

I substituted Cambells condensed fiesta nacho cheese for the milk, red and black pepper, added all ingredient's to a pyrex 6x8, topped with Arby's frozen curly fries, and cooked for 50 minutes at 385.  I omitted the french fried onions.  Added ketchup to the crispy fries, what a delicious meal.

All I did was add cheese during the last 5 min of the bake, tasted great! It was just a little runnier than I expected.

This is a tastier & prettier version of the traditional recipe. The red peppers are a nice touch.  Made it for a party of 6 & none was left.  Would definitely make again.
