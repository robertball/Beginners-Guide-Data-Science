Good recipe. Additionally; however, seitan may easily be made using vital wheat gluten. Some commercially prepared brands include unnecessary fillers and flavors in their products. Making it yourself is very easy. It's also much less expensive, and no doubt healthier.

I did use chicken instead of seitan, but the sauce is great!

Made pretty much as stated only used real chicken.  I liked it but my husband and kids didn't.  I couldn't get a good answer out of them as to what they didn't like about it, they just didn't.

I made two batches of this, one with seitan and one with chicken. Everyone agreed they were both delicious. Will definitely be making this again.

Used crunchy peanut butter and mixed all the ingredients in no particular order. Also mixed with extremely thin Vietnamese pasta. Oh, and one last thing... I used a little less sugar. It came out AMAZING!!!

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.. it was almost perfect for me. The only thing was it was a bit too sweet. An extra bit of hot chili sauce fixed it up though. I did make my own seitan as I was unable to find chicken flavored..not difficult and it freezes well.  Will make this again for sure

Yum. Made it with sauteed crisp tofu and green beans. Everyone loved it, even the picky 7-year-old.

This was simple to make and fast to put together especially using the pre-made seitan. I made the sauce per the recipe, except that I used agave syrup instead of sugar and used only half the amount called for since I think coconut milk is sweet enough as it is. It was pretty good as is but the only flavors I could really pick out were the peanut butter and coconut milk so I doubled the seasoning elements (red curry paste, chili sauce and oyster sauce) and that helped a lot. I wasn't sure about the spinach but it added a nice color to the dish and blended in well with the other flavors. I served this over whole wheat spaghetti. Will make this again with my changes.
