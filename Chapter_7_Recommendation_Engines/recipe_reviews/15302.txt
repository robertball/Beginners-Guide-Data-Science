This recipe is GREAT!  I did make a few changes:  I diced up some onion and garlic and saut√©ed it in the oil.  Then I cut the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sprinkled some hot chili powder on the chicken pieces prior to browning.  I then added the tomatoes with green chili peppers, beans and I used frozen corn and it turned out fantastic.  I did try to freeze it and it freezes really good.  However, I would suggest if you do freeze it you may want to add the beans in closer to the end of the cooking time because mine were a little soft after reheating.  GREAT DISH!!!

EXCELLENT! Per other reviewers, I used northern beans instead of black beans, added some minced garlic, onion powder, all-season salt & chili powder. Sprinkled some mexican-blend cheese overall. Served over "Onion Rice," also found on this site and the combo of flavors was great! Thanks Tammy! This one is worth repeating!

Great recipe! One morning I threw frozen chicken breasts into my slow cooker along with most of the other ingredients listed in this recipe, and ended up with a most delicious soup. I did make my own black beans, adding them to the slow cooker a couple of hours later; I also added 1/2 cup of uncooked white rice and some smoked sausage...turned out great. If the chicken hadn't been frozen, I would have tried the recipe as written; I will do that next time because it sounds wonderful. Thank you for this delicious, versatile recipe!

I'm rating this 5 stars because the corn & bean mixture was great--that is, after I spiced it up a bit. Added a 4 oz can diced chiles, a bit more cumin, 3 cloves of garlic, chili powder, & some chopped onions. I tried to spice up the chicken,  but it was still a little blah. Next time, I think I'll make margarita grilled chicken & serve with the beans & corn mixture from this recipe as a side dish.

This is a great recipe!  It was simple and fun!  I used chicken tenders that cook quickly, and  seasoned the chicken while browning.  I used a bit of mined garlic, onion powder, chili powder, and season salt just for a little more flavor.  I also added half a jalepeno and a bit of cilantro toward the end for an extra kick.  I shreaded the chicken and served in on tortillas with cheese.  All of my roommates thought it was awesome!!

Really, really good - and easy.  I didn't have any tomatoes with chilies, so I just used medium salsa and it came out great.  It got rave reviews from the husband and child.  It's very similar to a recipe I used in Weight Watchers, but much more moist and tender.

This is a great recipe, something different for once!  Reading some of the other reviews, I added garlic and chili powder, then cut the chicken into cubes so it soaked up more flavor. A great crock-pot recipe too!

I too seasoned the meat before browning it(I cubed the chicken).  I used garlic, onion,& chili powder's, pepper, and Adobo.  I browned the chicken in olive oil, then removed from pan.  I sauteed half an onion with 2 garlic cloves and threw all the rest in the pan.  I added some additional chili powder, red pepper, and half a teas. of chipolte sauce.  I had to leave suddenly, so I pulled out the crock pot and dumped it all in on low.  2 hours later-served it to some friends and got raves all around!!

Great recipe, but it does need some spicing up as other reviewers have noted. I added onion, garlic, more cumin, chili powder and oregano. Also used chicken thighs instead (seasoned these first as others suggested), and added an extra can of black beans because we love black beans. Great one pot meal. Served it with yellow rice and cilantro. Will be making this again.

Dish had great flavor to it, but the consistency wasn't quite what I was expecting (looked nothing like the picture, and I followed the recipe to a tee). My husband and I both enjoyed it even though it didn't have a good presentation. I think next time I'd coat the chicken in flour and brown like that first, and maybe use taco seasoning instead of the cumin. Overall, a good, very easy to make recipe I'll definitely try again!

Made this tongiht and it was great. I cooked it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high and added maybe a 1/2 c water to it. I added more cumin, chilli powder, garlic salt and 1/2 onion and cilantro. Topped with cheese and more cilantro (I love it!) I also added more salt. It just needed something. A lemon or lime might have been good but my husband hates it when I add that. Very good base recipe.

Wow! This was wonderful. Here's What I did... 6 Chicken breast, cut into strips. Cooked those in a little olive oil, until cooked thru. Then added 1 small jar of salsa (medium), about half of an onion,1 can of corn (drained) and 1 can black beans (drained) Added Cumin powder, and garlic powder after I got everything mixed up. I served it over brown rice... Eat!  :) It thickens up after you turn it off, even better I think.

This was a 5 star hit at my table. Both of my boys and husband gobbled it right down. I altered it slightly by cubing the chicken breast  and  tossing it with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, some chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and cumin before cooking. I also added an additional chili powder and cumin in with the tomatoes. I held off on adding the black beans until the last 10 minutes of cooking and served it over whole grain brown rice. Empty plates and NO leftovers!YUMMY and thank you for the recipe!

Super easy and quick, a great meal for a busy weeknight.  After cooking, I ended up cutting up the chicken and mixing everything together to use as a filling for tortillas.  Some added cheese, lettuce, sour cream and salsa, finished them off perfectly.

This is a great recipe.  When I make it, I do so in a crock pot on high for 5 hours, shred the chicken then prior to serving, add 4oz of cream cheese and let it melt then mix in.  It just pulls the flavors all together.  Very, very good!

My power was off all day and my plans to have friends over tonight to eat my pork from the crock pot were ruined and I came across this.  I thought it was a good basic recipe which I'll keep evolving.

I sauteed the frozen chicken tenderloins in some olive oil with minced garlic, onion powder, and cumin on medium heat with the lid on, stirring regularly, to cook the frozen chicken until cooked through, 10 min maybe.  I also started some brown rice cooking to serve with it.  I threw in a sliced bell pepper (I buy when on sale and keep these sliced and frozen so I can throw them in whenever), two cans of tomatoes, two cans of black beans (rinsed and drained), and two cans of corn (drained) and let it simmer for awhile probably about 30 minutes, but you could do it in as few as 10.  I was worried I might have to add some flour as it was very soupy from the tomatoes but, as others mentioned, it does thicken after you take it off the heat.  

Not everyone was a huge fan, but I loved that it was super simple, healthy, and budget friendly.  The kids drenched theirs in ranch and my Mexican husband squeezed lime juice.  I'm sure I'll make it again, and will likely add cream cheese or even the Philly Cooking cream in southwest flavor, or even a ranch sour cream dip would be good too if you like the creamy texture.  I've frozen our leftovers and will probably add some shredded pork to eat on tortillas next week.

Made this last evening for supper and we all thought it was great.  My hubby doesn't care much for chicken and he even liked it.  I will definitely make this again and probably double it so we have some left for lunches.  Thank you for sharing.

Good recipe.  My husband liked this a lot and said he will be requesting this again. Request?! This isnt Dennys! haha. I did make some changes and followed some sugestions.  I browned the chicken in 1 tbsp oil and 1 tsp butter.  After browning each side of the chicken breasts, I added 1 tbsp minced garlic and sauteed til lightly browned.  Tossed in corn (I used frozen-thawed) and the black beans (omitted tomatoes, as hubs doesnt like them).  Added garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and cumin.  I needed some liquid to allow the chicken to simmer in since I didnt add the diced tomatoes so I added about 1 cup of reduced sodium chicken broth.  Simmered until chicken was done and served over rice.  We like to add sauce to our rice so next time ill add some water with the broth.  This is a keeper, will be making again..at his Majestys request! haha

Quick and easy, but kind of a pain to serve. Next time I make it (if I make it again) I'll cube the chicken before cooking.

I had such high hopes for this, but the chicken, beans, everything were so dry!  If I tried this again, I would probably chop the chicken up-- maybe even cook it chicken stock and shred it, retaining the stock and adding the beans and corn.

it was alright I guess, I did what other reviewers said and added some diced onion and garlic, and I browned the chicken with taco seasoning coated on both sides, also I added some chicken broth when simmered and it was still just alright.  Oh well, thanks for the recipe though.

This was so easy to make and tasty.  I added some spices to my chicken (which I cut up into bite-size peieces) based on other reviewers' suggestions:  onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, and cumin.  I served this over crushed tortilla chips and topped with low-fat Mexican cheese and light sour cream.  (I skipped the chips.)  This would be good in a tortilla, too.

This recipe was great for a quick, easy dinner but....there was something missing.  I seasoned the chicken well before browning, and added extra cumin near the end, but it needed a little something more.  I can't quite put my finger on what that might be....Served the leftovers as a quesadilla after cutting the chicken up, and it was quite good that way.

This was EXCELLENT!!  I used 2 14oz cans of the local brand diced tomatoes with chilis and added some extra corn (I used frozen) I had used chicken cutlets in this recipe as well since thats what I had. Once served I squeezed fresh lime onto our servings and we added our own hot sauce and jalapenos as we liked.  We ate up the extra "salsa" with blue chips.

I made this in the slow cooker, just threw it all together and used dry beans.  Served it over rice, topped off with some shredded cheddar cheese.  My boys - ages 8, 5 and 2 loved it as well as myself!

Both my husband (fussy) and I loved this! It was easy to make, too. However, I made a few minor changes. On the advice of other reviewers, I coated the chicken breasts before browning, but I used fajita mix instead of the suggested taco mix. I didn't have tomatoes with green chilies, so I used a can of regular diced tomatoes and added some ground cayenne pepper. I used an ear of fresh corn cut off the cob instead of canned. When I finished cooking, I sprinkled a little fresh cilantro over the top. Very yummy, a little spicy, and a definite dish to make again!

Why is it that a lot of the "southwest" recipes don't have any southwest spices in them?  Another recipe that's a great starting point. Like everyone else I doctored mine up.  Seasoned the chicken with "Johnny's Grub Rub", then added 4 cloves of garlic, one onion, tsp of red pepper flakes, and my pinch of cumin was about 1 tsp.  After doctoring, yummy! 4 stars.

Easy and delicious.  We added a little chili powder and more green chiles as well as a little melted cheddar on top, however it is great even without the cheese.  We will try adding onions and garlic as others suggested.  It has a lot of potential for easy modifications which makes it a great recipe for a quick weeknight meal.

I make a version of this but use chicken cut in bite size pieces, sprinkle with taco seasoning then add a can of drained black beans, diced tomato and some corn.  I mix is up then top with some corn bread mix and bake till chicken is done.  Yummy

This dish was extremely good! I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces rather than using whole breasts. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I added a lot of seasoning (salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and oregano), which I think was crucial to the dish. I served it with Spanish rice. It was so easy and healthy that I would definitely make it again.

We loved this recipe. I didn't think I had anything for dinner, so I looked for something with chicken and black beans and this is what I found. Super impressed. Very easy. I didn't have the tomatoes with green chili peppers so I used some others' input and put garlic, chili powder, salt and pepper in as well. Next time I will try it with the chili peppers. We put it over rice, so yum! I also used frozen corn, it was great

I think it was very good. Like others I did make a few changes. I added chopped onion, garlic, chili powder, chipotle peppers, lime juice and 1/3 c. chicken broth since we like spicy and broth. Everyone really liked it. We, also don't care for big pieces of chicken breast but instead of cutting it into pieces, I pounded the breasts into thin pieces. Definately a keeper. I think for leftovers, I will cut the chicken into bites, add cheese, green onions and sour cream and make nachos!

Delicious!  I cubed the chicken as others had done. I do think next time I'll use 2 breasts next time because DH and I loved the bean mixture! I added a bit more cumin and about 1/4 tsp of chili powder, added some green pepper and frozen corn instead of canned. Served it over rice and dinner was a hit! I rated this 4 stars rather than 5 since I didn't cook it as directly, but it's 5 stars with the additions! Definitely keeping this in the dinner rotation! Thanks Tamatt for a great dinner recipe!!

Fantastic weeknight meal. I printed this awhile ago but hadn't tried it yet until this past week. We were particularly busy and I was looking for something quick. Didn't really change anything except I cut the chicken into bite size cubes to make it cook quicker. Also seasoned the chicken with some mexican seasoning before cooking and used frozen corn instead of canned (just what I happened to have). Thanks will definately make again!

I really thought my family would like this....they didn't...It just wasn't a good flavor combination for us.  I tend to really enjoy things with these ingredients....it just didn't blend well for us.  Super bland and just didn't have that wow factor.

This recipe is not very interesting, even after I tweaked it. I like the idea though. If you're making it, try sauteing onions and garlic in the oil first, then adding some spices: cumin, chile powder, chipotle chile powder. Let them stand for a few minutes with the onions over low heat, this will bring out their flavors more in the dish. Now add the rest of your ingredients. I think the best way to pull the whole dish together is to shred the chicken before serving. Serve on rice. A slightly sweet cornbread is also a nice compliment to the sweeter/spicier chicken mixture.

Very good, actually better the next day.  As per other reviews, spice the chicken before browning with at least salt & pepper. We liked it sprinkled with some longhorn cheese.

This was fabulous.  I made this tonight for our dinner and served it with white rice.  To be fair, I did do a few things different, but kept the intent of the recipe.  I sauteed some chopped onion and garlic with the chicken while browning.  Used petite diced tomatoes, and then chopped some jalapenos added those along with the black beans and the corn.  I served it on a bed of rice along with crushed tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Everyone agreed this was a keeper!  I'll be making this again.

Mine didn't look like the picture either. I wasn't sure if the chicken was getting done or not so I chopped it into bite-size pieces, turning it into a sort-of stew. All the chicken and veggies had the same sort of brown-ish tinge to them, but the flavor was pretty good. Easy to make and even my picky family liked it, so that's a plus.

I've made this several times now, and this is what I do:  I cut the chicken into cubes and cook it.  While the chicken is cooking I throw just a little bit of taco seasoning in to give the chicken some flavor, and also some garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  Sometimes a splash of chili powder too.  I cook the chicken and spices until it isn't pink any more, then add the other ingredients from the recipe.  I add a little more of the spices I listed earlier in addition to the cumin.  Then I let it simmer for a while so the flavors can mix.  When it is done, I wrap it in a flour tortilla with a dollop of sour cream and some salsa and it makes a pretty tasty little burrito!  It's even better the next day after the flavors have had more time to mix.  I've made this one already several times and will continue to do so.  It's quick, easy, and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I followed others advice and dredged the chicken in taco seasoning.  I also added garlic and onion when cooking the chicken.  I served it with shredded cheese and sour cream, rolled in a tortilla like a burrito.  My husband loved it and has already asked me to make it again ... it has only been a week.  It was pretty easy to make and healthy too.  YUMMO!!!

I seasoned the chicken with Adobo seasoning first.  As some reviewers suggested, I added some chopped onion and garlic.  Thought it was a great, quick recipe for busy nights.

Sliced chicken into strips, seasoned with lots of cumin and 2 cloves pressed garlic. Sauteed 1 chopped onion in olive oil, added chicken & cooked until lightly browned. Added veggies & 1 can diced chiles & simmered until juices cooked down. Served on warm corn tortillas with sour cream & sliced avocado. Even better the next day!

Great recipe!  Very tasty and easy to make!  We just ate it plain this time, but next time I will make either white or Spanish rice to go with it.  I think I might also try serving it by slicing the chicken up and rolling the mixture into tortillas.

Next time, I will leave out the chicken.  No flavor.  But we really liked the bean and corn mixture.  I added chopped onion, garlic and one tsp of cumin.

Awesome dish.  I make it in the crock pot and add some chili powder and 1 c. white rice (not instant).  Not a very pretty presentation because the beans and tomatoes break down and the rice gets kindof mushy, but it tastes great!  Top with a little sour cream and cheddar cheese.  You can even use frozen chicken breasts in this one!

5 measly stars is not enough for this recipe!  I used boneless chicken thighs, which I seasoned with freshly ground pepper and browned. I added the tomatoes with chiles, beans and frozen corn. Low sodium taco seasoning (about 1/3 of a packet) and 1/4 teaspoon of cumin seasoned the dish perfectly.  Sprinkled with fresh parsley and shredded mexican taco cheese, over whole wheat couscous, and this got rave reviews from the entire family.

I added some garlic powder and chili powder, but ommited the cumin because I was out of it.  Turned out very well.  Served it with a little cheese grated on top and tortilla chips on the side.

Even my kids loved this, and gave it 5 stars before I even asked for their opinion!  I added 1 cup chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic, sauteed before adding the chicken, then added a LOT more cumin (to taste).  I didn't have the can of corn, so we went without it and never missed it.  Yum!

This is a very easy, healthy, and filling dinner.  I'm on a diet, so I replaced the oil with fat-free cooking spray.  I also added a bit of minced garlic.  All in all, this was wonderful.  It's only 5 (Weight Watchers) points per serving, too!

This is a great recipe to serve as a main dish, shred the chicken for a salad, or use in a tortilla.  You can also modify the recipe by adding jalapenos (minus the seeds for me!), chili powder, onion, green/red peppers, using whatever beans you have on hand, or cooking the chicken with fresh garlic.  Also, fresh corn scraped off the cob adds incredible flavor.

As is, this recipe is great, but you can also use it as a springboard to create other variations.  I make this for my husband because he has to eat low fat, but it has tons of flavor.  He loves it.

Fantastic.

This is a simple -- very simple -- recipe.  Followed it pretty closely, using a third less oil, sweating 1/4 cup onion and 2 cloves of garlic before adding the chicken (given other reviewers' suggestions).  DH was not particularly impressed; to be honest, neither was I for a main course.  But it's a good lunch when you want something relatively healthy and relatively quick.

Even though I added taco seasoning and garlic to the chicken and a can of green chiles, I was a bit disappointed in this recipe. We ended up eating it in tortillas with cheese and sour cream but I don't think I'll make this again.

Made the meal based on the author's instructions and it just wasn't a big hit in my house. It was eaten but no one seemed interested in having it again in the future. I am keeping it around so that I can play with some of the custom versions to tailor it more to our tastes. Thank for for a good base recipe!

This recipe needs a little more kick.  For spice, I added Chili Powder and fresh garlic (minced).  Slicing the breasts into strips stretches the recipe a little better.  I'm going to squeeze a little fresh lemon or lime on it about 2 minutes before it's done simmering as well.

Easy and tastes pretty good!  I thought it was a bit too soupy with the canned diced tomatoes.  May try using fresh diced tomatoes in the future.

It didn't have enough spice for me. It seemed a bit bland. Perhaps I should of added more, or something else to it. I may try it again, but next time add more of a twist to it.

This was very good. I seasoned the chicken heavily with chili powder before cooking. after mixing everything together, I put a little bit of rice in it to soak up the juices. I was going to serve it with some rice, but then my husband and I got carried away with dipping into it with tortilla chips. Before we knew it...it was all gone.  And then he requested it as a dip for a football party. That's approval from him if I ever saw it.

This was surprisingly good.  We did change it up a bit by adding a diced onion and 4 chopped cloves of garlic.  We also added in 2 diced tomatoes.  My husband said he wasn't expecting much and was pleased especially since it was so filling.

I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks before I cooked it.  I also added onion and garlic but I left out the corn (because I forgot it).   I took the chicken mixture and made chicken quesadillas with it and the whole thing turned out delicious!

I probably would have given this recipe only three or four stars had I made as-is...I make Southwest food often, and this would not have been nearly enough spice for me and my husband.  But I'm giving five after my changes...this recipe is a GREAT place to start and build on to suit your individual tastes. I actually used chicken thighs b/c that's what I had on hand.  Instead of cooking them in the skillet I baked them in the oven for 12 minutes at 375 uncovered, then at 325 covered until just below being perfectly done.  I brushed both sides of the chicken with olive oil and seasoned with 1 tsp. Emeril's Southwest Essence, 1/2 tsp. sea salt, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin, and 1/2 tsp. paprika.  While the chicken was baking I make the bean mixture on the stove.  I first started with half a diced onion and three small diced peppers (green, red, and orange).  To that I added four cloves of garlic, the tomatoes and chiles, the corn, beans, fresh cilantro, and a Tbsp. of fresh lime juice.  I also added half a fresh tomato (leftover from the night before) to thicken up the mixture a bit.  I seasoned with salt, SW Essence, and cumin.  I then topped the finished mixture over the chicken and placed back into the oven for about 12-15 minutes at 400 degrees.  I served along side rice and garnished with sour cream and fresh chives.  Next time I'll add Mexican blend cheese over the top as well.  I know that's a lot of changes, but I had peppers to use up!

This recipe is a really great idea, I would've used pinto beans because the black beans caused the dish to become muddy looking even when rinsed well.  Also could have used some more flavor...don't know what would have helped, just needed something.

The ingredients in this do nothing to enhance flavor.  You might as well prepare each individually and then mix them on your plate.  It's edible but I won't make it again.

I hate to be the neysayer here..but this was bland, bland bland..I put chilli powder on the chicken before I browned it, I added more than enough cumin at the end..and nothing..no taste.  The only upside was that it did look good and pretty.  Sorry to disagree with the rest..but this definitely needs a kick somewhere.

I added chopped red onion as I cooked the chicken. I also marinated the chicken in a lime/chipotle marinade with a little onion powder and chili powder. I also substituted Rotel for my diced tomatoes. Overall this was outstanding for such a quick meal. I served over spanish rice.

I took the advice of others and cut the chicken into small pieces, cooked them with garlic and onion and also added a lot of cumin and chili powder.  Served it over brown rice.  It was delicious.  If I wasn't trying to eat healthy, I definitely would have made this with cornbread, as I think that would be fantastic!

The recipe as is gets 3 stars...there just wasn't any flavor!! But by adding a few spices this easily earned 5 stars! I sauteed garlic and green onions in olive oil spray instead of the oil. Seasoned the chicken with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Then added it to the onions and garlic. Followed the recipe as is after that...soooo yummy! Served with brown rice with lime juice and cilantro mixed in. Perfect HEALTHY meal!

I thought this recipe rocked.  Of course I spiced it up with way more than it called for.  I marinated sliced chicken in a mesquite lime marinade and then spiced it with minced garlic, chilli powder, cayene pepper, salt, pepper, and lime. For my can of tomatoes I used Rotel and used two cans instead of one. At the end I topped it with some more fresh squeezed lime, cheese, and chives served over a bed of fiesta rice.  It was delicious and served about six people.

So sorry - made exactly as directed and was not that impressed.  Pretty bland.  Towards end, I scrambled about to try to fix and added chipolte with adobe sauce and additional seasonings - still only adequate.  We doused top with diced red onion, and lots of cheese and sour cream which made it somewhat better, but still ....

Like other reviewers, I used white beans instead of the red. Taking a couple of other suggestions, I also added one fresh jalapeno, garlic and green onion plus a bit of chili powder. What a super jump-off recipe to endless variations on a theme !!  Good job, and thanks for sharing !!

This was fabulous! This was a great cheese-free recipe! I only had plain diced tomatoes, so I added a whole can of diced green chilies to the mix. The whole thing balanced out so beautifully! Awesome recipe!

Saut√©ed garlic and onion in the oil, added lots of chili powder to the chicken. Still bland, so added more garlic powder, onion powder, diced jalapeno and chili powder. The chicken never really soaked up the flavor, maybe it was the quality of the chicken. I will probably try it again and keep tweaking it, as I love the idea... maybe some cheese or breading the chicken?

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I sauteed a little onion and garlic in oil before adding in the chicken.  I had cut the chicken into chunks and seasoned it liberally with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper.  After browning the chicken, I added the tomatoes, beans and corn and a dash of cayenne for heat - we like a little heat.  Served it on rice and sprinkled a little cheese, sour cream and taco sauce on top - YUM!!  My hubby LOVED it.  Said it was his favorite of anything southwestern that I've ever made - and I have a killer taco recipe, so his statement carries some weight!  It was even better the next day.  This is going to be a regular on our menu.

Great mix of ingredients. I gave only 4 stars because I made alterations--without my alterations, this recipe may have been too bland for my taste.
While simmering, I mixed in one recipe of the "Taco Seasoning I" mix found on this website. This was great!!

This recipe was ok, I thought the chicken was a little bland but the overall concept was great.  I made it again but I rubbed the chicken with chili powder, salt,cumin and a little cayenne pepper and added some chopped onion.  It was fantastic and healthy!

My family truly enjoyed this dish. I made it Saturday and was asked to make it again tonight (Thursday). I sauteed the chicken with onion and garlic. I also added an additional can of beans and a little more cumin and red pepper. Guacamole and chips compliment the flavor wonderfully. It is a fun recipe to play with. Thanks.

I think this recipe has great potential, however, I did not make it as stated so my tremendous result is the result of a totally new recipe which I think I will add later.  I loved the combination of the beans, rice, corn, and chicken with the southwest flair, however, this would not have had enough flavor as stated so I could not give it really high marks.  Thanks for sharing the recipe because it inspired me to create a really wonderful meal for my family.  That is what this site is all about.  Thanks again!!!!

This was great!  I used my crock pot because I had read that some others had done it this way.  I used frozen chicken breasts and put GrillMates Chipolte Pepper marinade all over the chicken and put them in with 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies and a little bit of salsa.  I let that cook on low for about 4 hours.  Then I added 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of the mexicorn.  I let that simmer for another 2 hours and then shredded the chicken.  We used flour tortillas, added some shredded cheese and sour cream and they were yummo!!!  And I have tons of leftovers because I always make more so I can freeze!!  Thanks for the neat recipe, will have to try it the way it was meant to be sometime too!

This recipe was disappointingly bland. It needs some sort of a kick, although I did leave out the cumin. I'm just not crazy about that spice. It should have been replaced with something else. Maybe some black olives would add some zip?

This was great and very tasty!  I used fresh salsa though, instead of the diced tomatos, therefore I left out the advice to add garlic.  I had to let it hang out on the stove a little longer than I thought (husband was not home on time) lid ON, but it was still great.  I added some Trade Joe's frozen brown rice near the end and it was perfect.  I served it with some sour cream on the side.  Very tasty!  My 1-year-old loved it!

This was very good, but I agree with previous posts that it is a bit bland.  I added onions, garlic, cayenne pepper, and chili powder as other suggested and it still didn't have a whole lot of flavor alone.  Next time, I'll add an additional can of Rotels, and maybe even use a hotter variety.  Topping this off with cheese, salsa, and sour cream made it delicious!

Kind of a disappointment.  Thought this would be a great lower cal selection, but it was pretty bland, even after adding extra cumin & (lots) of other spices.  Needs something to pull all the ingredients together so that they meld & make a multi-layer taste sensation.  As it is, the flavors each stand alone & never really come together.

We really enjoyed this and it was perfect for when you're on a diet, like me. I thought it was fabulous. The only thing I did different was I added some salsa in addition to the canned tomatoes to help with the blandness that most other reviews mentioned. I also seasoned the chicken with cayenne pepper and cumin before browning. I also served with mexican rice and some cheese and sour cream, as well. Awesome recipe

Yummy and easy. I sauteed onion and garlic in the pan before browning the chicken. I also rubbed the chicken with chili powder, ceyenne pepper and cumin before browning, as others suggested. I am usually not someone who likes spicy things (my husband does, which is why I added it), but the amount I added made it just fine. It would have been bland without it. I also added green pepper. It was yummy.

I loved this! I cubed and seasoned the chicken first, as others had advised. I also added a packet of Goya Sazon, along with a sauteed onion and bell pepper. For the can of diced tomatoes, I used Mexican Rotel. I didn't have any black beans, but I know that would have made it even better. This tasted GREAT in a low carb tortilla with some fat-free sour cream. Best of all, it's low in fat (depending on how much oil you use)and packed with veggies! I will definitely make it again.

Really good. Very fresh tasting. Didn't have canned tomatoes so substituted salsa. Also added a dash of cinnamon while simmering. Great served over rice with a dollop of sour cream. Will definitely make again.

This was fine. I coated chicken cutlets with taco seasoning before cooking them. I put in a bunch of cumin, some cayenne and chili powder. Served over brown rice with lime juice and butter like someone else suggested. We put cheese on it along with sour cream. Pretty good overall. It would be good in a tortilla.

Ive been making this recipe for a while.  To make it quicker and keep the chicken moist you can cook it in an oven bag. I just throw it all in with some instant rice and a half cup of water. Add more seasonings, cayenne works well, clean up is a breeze. Your cassarole dish wont even be dirty.

I liked this recipe, but made a few changes.  I used salsa instead of the tomatoes, and I topped it off with shredded cheese and sourcream.

I thought this recipe was just delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (due to my crazy inability to experiment with recipes) and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I ate mine with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of shredded Mexican blend cheese.  My boyfriend ate his as it was and enjoyed it.  After reading the reviews with him, he thinks I should add garlic and cilantro.  If I am able to step outside the comfort of a recipe, I might just try it!  All in all, an easy and delicious entree!

I made this in the crockpot and added a few more spices:  garlic, cilantro & chili powder.  It proved to be a healthy meal served over brown rice.  Leftovers were even better the next day when I reheated it, sliced the chicken, and put everything in warm tortillas topped with a dollop of FF sour cream & FF shredded Cheddar.

Great flavor in this dish! I couldn't get black beans but red beans turned out fine. I like this dish because you can add spices to make it hot, or leave it mild too. Great dish to make for friends! I made with "Mexican Rice III"

I loved this recipe!  It was very colorful! As recommended, I cut the chicken breasts in half width wise.  I rubbed taco seasoning on them for more flavor.  I also served this with sour cream and guacamole!  Will be making this again soon!

EXCELLENT!!  I took the advice of some reviewers, and seasoned the dish a little more - added more than a dash of cumin, some garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder and fresh ground black pepper.  Also, cut up the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and served all on a bed of pasta.  Very filling & nice and spicy.  Will make again for sure!

This was a great dish but I made a few modifications:  I rubbed the chicken with chili powder and some taco seasoning a few hours before I cooked it. And I cut up the chicken and made the whole thing as a stir fry - it was great over rice!

Easy and delicious! Instead of cumin and chiles, we put some Emeril's Southwest Spice on the chicken and then followed the recipe from there. Couldn't be easier and was very tasty! My husband likes things spicy and I don't, and we were both very happy with the result! (I don't work for Emeril, just happened to have the spice in the house.)

This was a great, easy recipe.  I grilled the chicken rather than browned, for a smoky flavor.  Also, I added 1 c. chicken stock and 3 c. instant rice.

Super easy and tasty - though I did make some changes. Added onion and julienned red pepper. I like more spice so I also added cayenne pepper, smoked paprika and some garlic powder (since I was out of fresh garlic). Will make again!

I've made this several times and my husband and I both love it as is.  The flavor from the diced tomatoes with green chili peppers simmers into the chicken very nicely.  I loved that this recipe had just a few ingredients that blended so beautifully. This is an easy, colorful and very satisfying meal.  No changes needed.

A few changes and note my 5-star why

1) I preseasoned my chicken with Goya Adobo with cumin, a little fresh cumin, some garlic powder, some onion powder, cayenne powder and a little Mrs. Dash - Table Blend. 

2) I used jasmine rice in lieu of regular while rice. Very aromatic and flavorful. 

3. In the saut√© process, 1/4 of one vidillia onion and two teaspoons of garlic paste was added, along with a little more Adobo and fresh cumin. 

4) I also substituted finely diced tomatos with garlic and olive oil, a can of Goya black bean soup and a bag of Birds-Eye gold and white corn (I precooked this before adding). 

5) I cooked the chicken to about 85% done (minimal pink remaining), added the remaining ingredients then simmered for 40 minutes. 

This is magnificent.

Healthy, delicious and easy! Kept well for a couple days after for leftovers. Definitely will make again and again. Only, I made mine with cauliflower rice. It ended up being soup the night of (which still tasted great!) and ended up being the casserole after it sat over night for all of the liquid to be absorbed. Either way! :)

I loved this recipe! But I also modified it as well. I added onions, fresh garlic, cilantro, chili powder, seasoning salt and some garlic salt. I also added 2 cans of tomatoes w/chilies and cut the chicken breast up instead of leaving them whole. I also paired it with the Cilantro-Lime Rice recipe from the site... It turned out amazing and was a quick dinner!

This recipe has you dumping a lot of stuff onto a barely seasoned chicken breast. I enjoy Southwestern food, so I still liked the food, but there are much better Southwestern recipes here.

Rubbed chicken in taco seasoning, added sliced olives, topped with cheddar. We've been making this at least once a week for years. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Thi recipe was good.  As is, I think it would have been a little bland, so per other reviews I added some salt and pepper to the chicken and some garlic to the mix.  Next time I think I'll add some chicli powder and possibly onions. All in all it was a good healthy dish!

I added onion as others suggested and saut√©ed as chicken browned. I used Rotel tomatoes with chiles and it was plenty spicy for us. Also used frozen corn - a can full - can from black beans.  I cooked for awhile without lid to absorb some of the juice. We liked it.

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 due to fact that I had to tweak it a little to suit our tastes.  The changes I made included adding a can of green chiles, adding 1 Tbsp. of chili powder and used about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp. cumin instead of the pinch as called for.  These few additions seemed to make a world of difference, at least for our family it did.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so simple and easy, yet incredibly tasty and DELICIOUS! I also first sauteed two onions and a couple of cloves of garlic, and then added the chicken. Instead of using cumin (I don't like it), I used chili powder and garlic powder! Another small change I made upon the second time making this recipe, is that I used a 19oz can of diced tomatoes and I really found that it made this dish a bit more saucy, as a lot of the liquid evaporates while simmering. If you can't find diced tomatoes with green chili peppers, that's ok, either don't use chili peppers, or buy a small can from the Mexican food aisle in your grocery store, OR buy fresh chili pepper and dice 'em up! I also used frozen corn instead of canned, and I made Spanish rice from Uncle Ben's, which was a great side dish, although I mixed everything in my bowl all together and it was a bit like paella! Last addition, I made fresh guacamole, and it was fantastic to put atop this masterpiece! Very filling and healthy dinner, just remember moderation! Have left overs for lunch the next day! Bonne appetit!

This is potentially quite nice but a little bland! For me, south western cooking has a little more to it, and this really needed a lot more 'oomph' - I added 1 heaped tsp ground cumin plus a little minced jalapeno chilli (or 1/2 tsp chilli powder); some dried oregano; 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon and I served with some sour cream. Much improved.

This was good and also reasonably quick to prepare.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil added fresh garlic and onion sauteed until translucent and then browned the chicken.  1/2 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of New Mexico chili powder and it was great.

From a family who does not usually eat beans, this recipe is a KEEPER!  It is delicious and easy.  I do add a second can of tomatoes with chile's for a bit more flavor and juice.  Yummy, easy and healthy too!

I made this with the additions that were recommended by many, but as a vegetarian, I used Quorn Chik'n tenders.  Browned them a bit just as the recipe called for for chicken.  WOW!  Definitely a keeper!

This was so easy to make and had a lot of flavor.  I stuck to the recipe as written, and had enough sauce left over to make a spanish omelette the next day.  It was really good.  If you're looking for a quick, tasty way to prepare chicken, I would recommend this recipe.

Just made this dish with the added onions, garlic and chili powder. I'm glad I did so but it was still kind off bland for me and my husband. Just seemed like it needed something more. I will probably make again but with more seasonings next time. Overall, it's an okay meal.

My husband didn't find this dish all that exciting but I thought it was pretty good.  I used fresh corn and added lots of onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder and extra cumin.  As another reviewer suggested, I served it over Onion Rice (from this website).

I diced the chicken breast and used plain diced tomatoes and no cumin, therefore I added a package of taco seasoning. I served it with rice and sour cream and shredded cheese for topping. My husband couldn't get enough of it!

I gave this recipe 3 stars solely for nutritional value.  The taste, however, was pretty boring.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before cooking to the chicken some extra flavor; but when the tomatoes, corn, and beans all simmer together the flavors also blend in a mushy, mundane flavor combination. Very bland. In order to eat this, I had to end up putting it into tortillas with cheese and sour cream to help out the flavor. Again, pretty healthy, but not something I will make again.

Great dinner!  Husband isn't a fan of beans, so I used great northern beans for a more mild flavor, added chili powder, and diced my chicken to soak up more flavor.  Served with Onion Rice!  Awesome!

I thought this was a fantastic easy dinner.  My 4 year old devoured it.  I served it over cilantro lime rice and it tasted great.  I think next time I'm going to try adding a little Caribbean Jerk seasoning to it.

Quick, easy and relatively healthy dish. Spice it up in your own way. I used onion, garlic, whole cumin and cilantro. Cut the chicken into 1/2 inch cubes before cooking and serve it over rice for a quick meal.

Good for a quick dinner but average on taste. This reminded me of Moe's chicken rice bowl, which I like.I did cut my chicken into pieces but will probably just roast my chicken breast in oven first next time, then sherd.  I added onions, chili powder and up'ed the cumin. Served with rice and grilled tortillas. Cheese, sour cream, tomato chunks and cilantro on the side. Will make again.

The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I added the cumin while it was cooking and added a bit more than was called for. I looove this recipe! It is so easy (and cheap) to make and is full of flavor. I invited my mom over for dinner one night and she liked this recipe so much she made it for my dad two days later!

Added garlic, onions, and long grain rice.  Mixed it all together with the rice.  Fantastic!  Good by itself or in a burrito - the burrito was outstanding.(Touch of sour cream is nice too)

As is this was not bad.  I used 1 already cooked frozen chicken breast and added garlic powder and more cumin.  Next time I'm going to add onion and red peppers.  Now I have another great lunch option.

When I went to eat left overs, I cut the chicken into cubes and sprinkled colby jack cheese on top of mixture, heated, and had it with tortilla chips.  Great take on nachos!

I made this dinner one night for my husband and I and we both enjoyed this dinner. I did make my own personal changes to suit my taste in that I threw in some fresh chopped cilantro and squeezed in some lime juice. It was delicious!

I liked this and probably could have given it 5 stars but felt it needed more zing.  After cooking the chicken breasts I set those aside on a plate covered in foil and then sauteed onions for about 3 minutes.  Then instead of the tomato/mild chile can, I used diced tomato with jalapeno and instead of just the kernel corn I used the Southwest corn with peppers. Then, I upped the cumin to a tsp and added it to the bean/tomato mixture.  I also added a tsp of minced garlic, a tsp of crushed red pepper, a half tsp of hot sauce (I prefer Crystal) and cilantro.

This is so easy and fast to make. It's the perfect meal for a busy weeknight. We usually double the tomatoes and beans to give us enough for leftovers. We serve over brown rice and top with cheddar cheese or sour cream.

I make a recipe very similar to this, but instead of a can of tomatoes with green chilies, I use a jar of salsa.  That might help with some of the other users that thought this recipe was too bland.  Serve with rice and it's a super quick and healthy meal!

Great recipe!! Didn't change much, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning; then seasoned the simmering mixture with chili powder and served with couscous.

My kids don't ever like beans or tomato sauces but they loved this meal.  I made some changes based on the reviews I read.  I added onions, garlic powder, chili powder, pepper, minced garlic, and more cumin. We ate this with some rice and used a few corn chips over it.  Very good and filling.

I just made this and so good. I only used 2 chicken (that is what I had defrosted) and used a can of mild chili beans instead of black (that is what I had) I drained but didn't rinse because I wanted the chili flavor. Very good!

This was very good.  I made roughly half the recipe, but used the full can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, half the can of black beans (froze the rest for later) and frozen corn, thawed.  Instead of using the cumin, I dusted my chicken with taco seasoning before browning, and also added more after adding the tomatoes, beans and corn.  This is a snap to put together for busy nights, and we enjoyed it.

This dish was delicious.  Reading the other reviews, I added chopped onion, garlic and chili powder.  I also cubed the chicken.  We ended up putting it over tortilla chips to make Southwest Chicken Nachos.

Very enjoyable, the chicken came out very moist and tender. I sauteed some onions and garlic in the oil prior to browning the chicken, which I seasoned with salt and pepper. I upped the cumin to about 1tsp, added 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cayenne. Served with brown rice. I imagine that a dollop of cool sour cream with some minced cilantro would also be tasty.

I made this recipe as stated except I cut up the chicken so I could use it on tortilla shells, 2 cans of tomatoes diced and 1 small can of diced green chilies. It was rather bland at first. So I added chili powder, curry, garlic powder, 1/4 c salsa, pepper, and 1 TBLS of lime juice. Also next time I will make sure to drain my tomatoes or add a thickener as it was really runny for making burritos. Otherwise, my family really liked it and I will definitely make again with some modifications.

Great recipe. I did add chili powder to give it a little kick.  I also browned garlic in the pan before cooking the chicken.  Turned out amazing with Mexican rice.

This is a great recipe, I usually season the corn mixture a bit more with cajun and greek seasoning and the chicken with a fajita seasoning.  Then we use this as a filling for tacos and just add cheese and guacamole.

Sooooo good yet sooooo easy.  Everybody loves a tender, juicy flavorful chicken. I pounded the chicken breast  to 1/2 or 3/4 of an inch. Paper towel dried & sprinkled Tony Cacheras seasoning sparingly & left in fridge overnight.  Dredge in flour before lightly browning the chicken to keep the juices in. Since I quadrupled the recipe, I placed it in the oven 350F for about 30 -35 minutes.

I took some advice from reviews and cut the chicken into bitesized pieces, I sauted onion and garlic with the chicken and seasoned it with onion powder, garlic salt and pepper.  I added the tomatoes and corn and some chicken bullion with the cumin and added the beans in at the last minute.  I served it with corn tortillas and shreaded lettus and we made tacos out of it.  We really liked it as taco filling.  My 2 year old ate 3 whole tacos!

This recipe is GREAT with changes/additions.  I cooked the chicken breasts in water (as I always do) reserving some of the chicken broth to add to the mixture; cut the chicken into bite size pieces after cooked; added two cans diced tomatoes, one 4 oz can green chilies, one can drained/rinsed black beans and frozen corn.  I spiced it up with 1/2 t. cumin, garlic and onion powder, course/restaurant ground black pepper and 1 t. low sodium taco seasoning.  I served it with brown rice.  I didn't add cheese or sour cream because I tried to keep it healthy but may add these in the future!  Next time I'll add a little lime juice and cilantro and see what that does to the taste.  My husband said at least 3 times during dinner, "this is really good."  Very yummy with changes/additions.

Awesome!  I made this to have a healthy, (fairly)low calorie & tasty meal, and was delighted with the result!  I served it over brown rice and used a bit more corn and tomatoes & a bit less black bean (not a huge bean fan, but they are great source of protein) As another reviewer suggested, I added a few sprinkles of both chilli powder and onion powder.  It gave it a little extra kick & flavor.  YUM.  I portioned this up, and froze several servings for a later date.  REALLY TERRIFIC RECIPE!  Thank You Tamcatt!

Delish! :D I added garlic (cause I love it) and onion (cause I love it too) in the oil before the chicken. I added a little more cumin, some chili powder, a small amount of lime juice, and fresh cilantro at the end as well and it turned out so yummy.  I think next time I'll add in some diced poblano pepper.

This was so good and incredibly easy! I added some chili powder to the chicken in addition to the S&P at the beginning. I also added some fresh garlic, fresh lime and some fresh oregano to the bean and tomato mixture. When it was done we added some fresh avocado, and it was very flavorful. Definitely will make again!  *Tip* to still make it a quick and easy meal I heated up the 90 second microwave in a pouch Uncle Ben's Rice to lay the chicken over!

Excellent, quick and easy recipe! If you like this, try slow cooker chicken taco soup on this site for a crock pot recipe that has an almost identical flavor....I serve topped with cheese and sour cream. I know, ruins the 'healthy' factor..but so good!

I made the similar changes in terms of adding more spices and cutting up the chicken, but I also added a little chicken broth to make it souper. I served it over couscous and it was delicious. My 2 yr old even liked it.  I'd make it again for sure!

This recipe was a 4 as is but with added spices like cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and chili powder, it ended up being a lot tastier!  I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces as recommended and then sauteed them in the skillet with garlic and all of the spices above.  I added a lot more seasoning once the beans, corn and tomatoes were added.  Served over yellow rice.  With these changes, I will def be making this again for a quick week night meal!

I really liked it, however, I did add some additional spices. I cut the chicken into 1 inch pieces and seasoned it with seasoned salt and chili powder. I also sauteed 1 diced garlic clove and green onions before I added the chicken. My husband said it turned out better than he expected, and for him, that's a compliment!

This was pretty good - Agreed with other reviews that the presentation/end result wasn't exactly what I was thinking. I would probably up the Cumin - I also added chopped onion to mine as it sauteed and also added cilantro(i LOVE cilantro). I enjoyed it alot the next day  - actually a lot more than the first day.

This was just okay. Nothing really stood out about it. I used frozen corn instead of canned. The chicken was dry. I sauteed onions and garlic to go with it, just as a preference. I also put some sour cream in mine for added flavor. I want to make it again using chicken thighs, so the chicken retains some moisture. Served over white rice.

I used this for a base recipe as hubby and I are on a diet.  I just threw most of the ingredients in a dutch oven.  I had no beans but will use next time.  I I did not use oil and crushed three small home grown tomatoes and added a yellow bell, green bell and a hot chili.  Had some fresh parsley about to go bad so I throw that in with garlic sea salt and pepper.  Hubby loved was filling and low calorie.

I used left over corn on the cob (3 ears cut off) and roasted it in a little oil with the pre-cooked, cubed chicken. Also used a jar of Chipolte salsa instead of the tomatoes. Served with rice. Great!

This recipe is okay, but after reading all the reviews and then preparing the dish, I can definitely see how if prepared as written it would be bland.  I browned about a half cup chopped onion and a minced garlic with the chicken breasts.  I upped the cumin from a pinch to 1/2 t., and added 1 t. Chili Powder.  It was still, even with all this, a bit bland for us.  If I try this again, I will look for other ways to spice it up a bit.  My 14yo also suggested melting cheese over the top, and I kind of think he might be on to something.

This was GREAT! I used medium salsa instead of diced tomatoes and was a little afraid that the spice would be too much for my husband so I added more corn and another can of beans. Instead of 4 whole chicken breasts I used two chicken breasts and cut them into smaller pieces to make it go farther. With all the extras it made a perfect amount for dinner for 4 and lunch today! I also made a batch of white rice and served this with tortillas. This recipe makes WONDERFUL burritos! Thank you so much for sharing, we will be having this one again...soon!

This dish was good and my children liked it too. It was a bit spicy. I think I am going to try just diced tomatos, not diced tomatos with chilies

I was skeptical about the looks of this, but my husband and boys loved it served over rice.  I followed the idea of sprinkling taco seasoning on the chicken breasts before browning.  When there were leftovers, I shredded the chicken and mixed the leftover rice and vegetables with it.  It was even better the next day!

This recipe is Excellent!  I made a few changes: I did what another person said and diced up some onion and garlic and sauteed it in the oil.  Then I sprinkled the chicken breasts with some hot chili powder, prior to browning.  It turned out beautifully! The chicken was so very moist!  Also my family says, "this is defiantly gonna be a recipe that we are going to have to have again!"

Wow, this came out fantastic and was SO EASY!!  I followed the instructions exactly, but I found it necessary to add a little water to keep it all from cooking down too much.  I served it over brown rice with fat-free sour cream and mild Taco Bell sauce on the side.  The end result was a huge hit!  A++++ recipe and it‚Äôs healthy too!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful meal idea.

This is a great recipe. I just usually add additional veggies (onions, green and red peppers, etc.).  I also add a clove of garlic to give it a little more flavor.

This was really great. Had to transfer to a "deeper" pan once it started overflowing my original pan, so make sure you have a big enough pan to cook it in.

Great base recipe, but needs a little spice. Before browning,I rub the chicken breasts with a spice rub found in the "chili spiced chicken breasts" recipe on this site.3/4 t chili powder,1/2 t ground cumin, 1/4 t garlic powder & 1/8 t ceyenne. After browning I remove the chicken from the pan & set aside. In the pan I sautee 1 small onion, diced and 1-2 cloves garlic, minced, just untill slightly tender.Then, add the beans,corn,tomatoes, chicken,cumin and a pinch or 2 of chili powder and simmer away! I also find that a can of plain diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chilis, rather than the rotel works well. With the revisions I give this 5 stars.

I thought this was tasty but I noticed that the sauce cooked down alot so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and I sprinkled in a left-over packet of taco seasoning mix. I also shredded the chicken and mixed it all together. This was really good served over a bed of yellow rice!

This is one of my favorite recipes that I've ever made!!!  Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also didn't have diced tomatoes with chiles, so used one can diced tomatoes and one can diced chiles.  We served over rice and it was sooo good and so healthy for you too.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

super tasty and super easy!  But we made a few changes, so it's rated with the changes in mind:
we marinated chicken tenderloins in lemon juice, garlic powder and parsley (our new trick for chicken), browned them in olive oil with diced onions and minced garlic; added diced tomatoes (with the juice) and black beans (rinsed and drained); cumin, corriander, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper, and let cook for 20 minutes (uncovered).  Put instant brown rice and cooked for 10 more minutes (covered).  Served with sour cream and cheese.

This was excellent.  Changes I made: per other recos, I first sauteed 1 onion and 2 cloves garlic before I browned the chicken (also had cut my chicken into strips).  Added 1/2 tsp. chili powder and 1/4 tsp. all-seasoned salt.  It was so yummy.  It felt hearty yet light and healthy.  It had a bit of a kick to it, so I think next time I'll ease up on the chili powder so that my toddler can try it.  Served it over white rice and it was a great meal.

5 stars for both ease of preparation and taste.  I was surprised at how flavorful the chicken was!  I had seasoned it with just salt and pepper and all the other ingredients just infused the chicken with tons of taste.  It was also very tender and the medium sized breasts I used only took about 20 mins.

Delicious! I made this last-minute because I had all the ingredients on hand. I also chopped up an onion and a clove of garlic and sauted it with the chicken, and I added chopped cilantro right before serving. I will definitely make this again, and serve it with lots more chopped cilantro and with guacamole and sour cream on the side. This would make a great burrito rolled up in a tortilla (with the chicken shredded or chopped, of course). ETA: I made this again, but this time I cubed the chicken before browning, and I liked that a lot better. I also made Mexican Rice and served it over that, which was yummy.

This was really good and quick for a mid-week dinner.  I knocked it to 4 stars because you can't make anything "Southwest" without onion, garlic, chili  and cumin at a bare minimum.  Good blend of textures with the corn and beans, and with some spice tweaking, it was a hit.  I served it over rice and it looked just like the picture!

Really fantastic!  I used cut up chicken tenders and it worked perfectly.  I increased the cumin and added chili powder and some hot sauce to taste.  Served over brown rice with cheese on top.  Quick to prepare and delicious!!  Will definitely make again and again. :)

Excellent! Really easy and yummy. I followed other reviews and sauteed onion and garlic with cubed chicken. I added a bit of salsa and let it simmer about 30 minutes. Served it out brown rice. My husband loved it!

Maybe I did something wrong...based on the other great reviews...  What I ended up with was basically non-seasoned chicken topped with canned veggies. This could be good if the chicken was seasoned and the finished dish was 'saucier'.

Simple, easy and delicious. I used boneless, skinless thighs and thought they substituted quite well. Everyone loved it has requested it be added to the rotation.

I changed this recipe a little bit by cutting the chicken into strips and seasoning it with taco seasoning while it was browning.  It's low in fat and calories but still managed to taste pretty good.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  Not only is it so easy and quick and delicious- it is so healthy!  I couldn't believe how good it tasted the first time I made it.  I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces when I make this and I always season it with chile powder.  I have sauteed onions and garlic with the chicken before and that turned out wonderful.  I also sometimes add cilantro in the last 5 minutes of cooking and that adds even more great flavor.  I usually serve over rice, and my husband loves to put this in a tortilla and make a burrito out of it.  So healthy and so good!  This has definitely become a regular meal in our house.

I made this last night and everyone loved it!  I used a little broth to cook the chicken instead of oil.  This is a light dish that tastes hearty.  It was satisfying, yet I didn't worry about it messing up my diet.  Great recipe!

This recipe is deceptively simple.  It has a really enjoyable flavor.  I cut the chicken into strips before cooking and served it with tortillas and light sour cream.  I ate the rest in a bowl with sour cream like mexican soup.  It was awesome both ways.  I'm keeping this one!  I would call this light tex-mex comfort food.

This was really good.  I did add some chili powder to the chicken.  My husband said it tasted like something he'd get from his favorite mexican restaurant!  It was a hit!  Thanks.

I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and added a few spoonfuls of sliced pickled green chillies.  Also used more corn and 1tsp cumin, and added 1 cup quinoa. Simmered with lid on - great taste but chicked was a bit overcooked.  Next time will add more cumin and also cayenne, and add the chicken later so it doesn't get so dry.

A great, hearty dish and the heat from the chiles added a nice kick. The chicken came out very moist too. It tastes just as good reheated.

This is a great weekday meal that is very tasty and easy to prepare.  I served it over yellow spanish rice which really gave it a great flavor (I think plain white rice would have been a bit bland).  Oh, and since bland is bad, I followed others' advice and heavily seasoned the chicken before cooking it up. If you have a more mild pallate, I would just make the recipe as is.

I thought this was a very easy and healthy recipe -- perfect for a weeknight.  I did take the advice of some of the other posters and I seasoned my chicken before browning.  I used adobo, salt, pepper, and a little cumin.  I also used frozen corn instead of canned.  I served it with rice and my fiance loved it!  I would definitely make this recipe again.

Very good and healthy. Be sure not to dry out the chicken. I served it with brown rice that I flavored with lime juice and butter.

This was a very simple, healthy meal.  I took the chicken breasts, dredged them in flour mixed with taco seasoning, then browned them in the skillet.  I dumped all the rest of the ingredients in and let it cook-my fiance commented on how tender and flavorful the chicken was and to add it to our favorites list.  Yum!

I thought this recipe was really good and easy, but i thought it had the tendancy to be a little bland, so I had to add some more cumin and some more heat, but overall very good.

I thought this was just okay. I coated the chicken in taco seasoning and cut into bite size pieces. It was good, but sort of bland. The consistency was also very mushy.  However, it was great the next day wrapped in a flour tortilla, with sour cream, guacamole, Mexican rice, and some salsa. Good as a burrito filling, not good alone though.

This recipe is great, my husband and I make it when we want a quick and delicious meal.  I also season the chicken before browning it in the skillet and I also leave out the corn for my husband who is not big on vegetables!

I made it like the recipe explains.  It is very easy and quick.  The taste is good.  At the end of cooking, I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces.  Initially, I forgot to add the cheese, and the flavor was just okay.  Then I remembered to add the cheese and that made all the difference.  The cheese is a necessary addition.  My 6 year old enjoyed it... she really liked the black beans.  Next time, I will periodically check to see if the chicken is done, because I think 30 minutes may have been to long since the chicken turned out a little rubbery.  I will make this easy dish again.  My sister liked it and asked for the recipe also.

Soooo easy and tasty. It is great for a week night meal after work. I added a little mozerella cheese to the top just long enough to let it melt before serving. A healthy, convenient, delicious dish.

This was a pretty spicy dish! It had good flavor but just seemed to be missing something. I did change a few things: I cut the chicken into bite size pieces (small children in the house, less cutting at dinner time), added the taco seasoning, and we served it over Mexican Rice (white rice, salsa, peppers, onions). BUT it still needed something. My husband suggested next time we have flour tortillas and wrap the mixture in it with the rice mixed in also. I think that would also be a welcome addition. Otherwise, nice flavor and a great way to add beans into your diet! OH yeah, I also topped it with about a half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar.

This was an easy recipe, but instead of breast I used chicken tenders (cut down on the cook time). I did what other people mentioned and dredged my tenders in taco mix before browning. Then I followed the rest of the recipe. Everyone loved it, served it on top of spanish rice.

Very Good!!! I cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and took the advise of others and rubbed chicken with some chili powder, onion powder a nd garlic powder prior to browning. I also added a lot more than just a pinch of cumin.

Definately a keeper and will be making again! Thank you for the recipe.

I followed other reviews and added to this.  I coatesd the chicken in flour and also rubbed some taco seasoning and garlic to start with.  I also added more cumin than called for.  The recipe was good -but the extra spices definitely helped.  I've had something similar at a friend's house where she just dumped the cans in with no spices and it was bland.  This had nice flavor and the chicken came out very moist.  Cooking time was shorter than stated.

Wow. I was surprised at how tasty this dinner was. I sauteed the chicken in the pan first with a little butter, onion and crushed garlic, flouring the chicken first with cayenne pepper added, as I have seen people suggest a few times. Now, this wasn't invite the inlaws over kinda good, but the kinda good that you make once a week. I am so glad I tried it!   OMG, ETA: I have been making this 2 x a month since I first reviewed it in 2003! Great standby recipe!

Very good and very easy!  We loaded up on the cumin and added a bit of hot sauce for extra kick.  Fresh cilantro might be fun if you had some on hand, but it really is GREAT as is!

This was surprisingly good for the lack of seasonings.  The chicken absorbed the tomato and bean mixture.  I didn't make it with corn because I can't eat it.  Even my daughter who is picky loved the chicken.

The only change I made was to sprinkle the chicken with homemade taco seasoning before browning.  I think it would have been a bit bland without.  Otherwise it is easy and tasty.  Great served with mexican rice!

My family enjoyed this recipe! I did cut the chicken into cubes prior to cooking simply to make it easier for my kids to eat. I also added two cloves of minced garlic and some taco seasoning. It gave it a nice flavor. I served it over rice to round it out as a complete meal.

This is a great recipe but needs more heat and more flavor. Try garlic and onion, I also use a little cumin, curry, red pepper flakes and even a little chili powder.

Won't be making this again. It needed help. I added salt, pepper & some cheese melted over the top. Hubby used cajun seasoning so we could eat it. It helped, but won't make again. I do something similar as a side dish for enchiladas. I use garlic, kidney or black beans drained, chili powder, cumin, tomatoes - can or fresh cut up. I also add frozen corn & finally rice. It I have some extra cheese like Mexican, I'll put some over the top before serving.

Took the recommendations of the others by adding garlic, onions, chili powder, and I added a bit of salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper too, and OH it was Delicious! I put my portion on a bed of romaine with Tomatillo (green) Salsa as the dressing and it was perfect! My husband and step-daughter love cheese, so after I took my portion out of the cast iron skillet, I sprinkled on some shredded cheese and covered it for a few extra minutes so it could melt. Saving this to make again!

I made this and served it over rice. I had to significantly change the amount of seasonings because it was very bland as called for. My boyfriend liked it, and I thought it was tolerable but I don't think I'll make it again.

I put this together ahead of time for a busy night, so I made a few changes.  I drizzled olive oil in a baking pan, put chicken breast tenders in the pan, sprinkled with salt, pepper and cumin, topped with salsa, corn and beans.  Baked at 350 for 30 min covered, then removed foil to evaporate some juice.  The family loved it, chicken was juicy and tender.

I heeded other reviews' bland warnings and decided to spice it up. I added some onion and finely diced jalape√±os when browning the chicken, and then seasoned with garlic powder, cayenne, and cumin. A little spicy and very delicious!

I too seasoned (red pepper, ancho chili powder, tiny bit of seasoned salt) and browned the chicken, removed it from the pan, & added some minced onion and garlic to simmer in the oil until fragrant. Meanwhile I sliced the chicken and added it back into the pot. I used fire roasted tomatoes and a 4 oz can of green chilies instead. I used two chicken breasts as I‚Äôm cooking for two, so I halved the corn and black beans and let it simmer adding a bit of cornstarch so the sauce would thicken. I then served it over jasmine rice. Last minute and delicious!

I made this.  I used rotisserie chicken and taco seasoning.  I cooked rice with water and juice of one lime and cilantro and added it to chicken with onions beans corn and Rotel tomatoes with peppers and taco seasoning.  I have used it in a burrito with all the fixings.  It is a wonderful thing!

I accidentally bought the tomatoes without the green chilis, so maybe it's my own fault, but this recipe was really bland. I added a bunch of cumin and chili pepper, to no avail. It was ok, but I don't need to put it in the rotation.

this recipe is great when I made mine I felt that it did not have the southwest taste so as I was cooking it I threw in some peparika, salt,pepper, and a little chicken broth so the chicken wouldn't get dry. It really made everything pop.

I cut up the chicken into cubes because I like smaller pieces. I also went ahead and added bell peppers, onions, back olives and garlic. I also added extra cumin because I like the flavor. I'm anxious to try this inside a tortilla shell as well!

I made this with a copy cat Qdoba Lime CILANTRO rice on the side.  I added garlic salt and pepper when I was pan frying the chicken.  Family stated that it was a keeper.

Hubby said it was ok. Just something was missing. Definately needed salt, something was just off. Probably won't fix it again.

Very good. I browned the meat in olive oil in  frying pan, then cooked in oven. I added salsa to the recipe. When finished, I added Mexican cheese on top and put in broiler to melt.

Like others, I cut up the chicken and seasoned it w/chili, onion, and garlic powders along w/cumin and some oregano. I also saut√©ed some diced onion and garlic in olive oil prior to adding the chicken. I used seasoned black beans, too. It turned out great. There was more liquid than I expected but using a slotted serving spoon to serve over rice made the dish a hit. I also added some Mexican cheese mix at serving time. It was great and will definitely keep it as part of my dinner rotation.

This is really good. I did make a few changes. I bought some fajita seasoning and threw it in after I browned the chicken and threw in the rest of the ingredients and I also used frozen corn instead of canned. Also I uncovered it after and let it cook down and thicken up for about 10 mins on medium so it wasn't so soupy. Delicious!

After reading some of the other reviews, I also adjusted the recipe. I added onion powder (no onion available). I added chili powder & minced garlic. I added the cumin while cooking.  I still felt it needed something. I didn't have cilantro & I think this would have added to it. I am going to try another suggestion next time. I am going to use salsa instead of the can of tomatoes.   I am also going to try the slow cooker that was mentioned. We loved it but I am going to play around with it.

One of the easiest and inexpensive dishes to make. I've made it exactly as written, and also with salsa instead of the canned tomatoes with chiles. Both came out good. Always a hit with the kids!

I had to add a lot of spice to this recipe before we ate it . How people can say it is great and then add all sorts of ingredients kind of defeats the purpose of rating to begin with. The rating I have given this is as it tasted as made by the recipe, not all the ingredients I added.

Super easy and delicious. Here are some helpful modifications: I added onion and garlic with the chicken. After they were browned, I added red pepper, garlic pepper, and paprika to spice it up. After I finished cooking the meal, I also added cheese and broken pieces of blue corn tortilla chips to the servings. You can also put this on a flour or corn tortilla for a tasty taco/burrito! Yum!

Tasty! My hubs and I liked this quite a bit, albeit with a bit of doctoring on my part. :) I felt this would be pretty bleh as written, so to add a little pizzaz, I seasoned my chicken (which I cubed) with 1/4 teaspoon each of chipotle chili powder, cumin and salt. I also saut√©ed a small chopped onion and minced garlic clove in a little EVOO BEFORE browning my chicken. I then proceeded as directed. Because I was only serving two adults, I halved everything (which was easy to do since I already had a half can of beans in my fridge and was measuring the corn from a bag in my freezer). Serving this over brown rice with cubed avocado, a dollop of sour cream and fresh lime was a fantastic (and yummy!) idea. Thanks for sharing your healthy recipe, Tamcattt. With a little tweaking, this wasn't bland in the least! :-)

I would assume if one were to just follow the original recipe it would indeed taste rather bland, however, following Missdvs' advice, I added vegetable oil, diced onion and garlic to the saute pan prior to cooking the whole confection. I then browned the chicken breasts (not diced, whole), letting it soak in the garlic and onion flavor. I added Hungarian spice, chili powder, a pinch of salt and pepper. I then added the tomatoes and diced green chili's, the black beans (rinsed) and the corn (drained and rinsed) and cumin. To top it off as a special treat I sprinkled Mexican style cheese over the top lightly- it added to the meal nicely. My husband and I agreed that this meal could make for excellent serve-yourself chicken burritos- but just an idea ;) .

This was quick and easy to make! I cubed my chicken and used evoo instead of vegetable oil to cook my chicken in. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and chili powder then I sprinkled the cumin over everything like the recipe says to. I also added onion and minced garlic. Will make again!

made exactly to recipe and my hubby and I both thought the sauce was ok but chicken bland and dry from pan frying.  If I make it again I would add red pepper, onion, and use a medium rotel or perhaps salsa and use my crock pot so chicken would be moist.

We loved this recipe. Really full of flavor. I used different sized cans and it all worked out. The corn was 15.25 oz, the diced tomatoes were 14.5oz Muir Glen brand with medium green chilies and I used 14 oz of chicken because that's all I had.  I diced the chicken just speed things up and served with farro. Really yummy, quick and easy.

Awesome! Will definitely become a staple.  I followed the recipe, but added a couple drops of habanero hot sauce to spice it up a bit, no chili powder, garlic, or onion like others have. You should make this tonight!

I guess I used this recipe as more of a guide. I didn't have any chili peppers, but I did add about a teaspoon of chili powder to spice it up a bit, as well as a couple garlic cloves. I also am not able to find black beans where I live, so I replaced them with kidney beans. Served it with rice. Overall, it was very tasty!

I LOVED this dish. I normally don't enjoy southwest type dishes, but this is delicious. I'm not a huge spicy fan and this was just the right amount of zesty. If you are looking for a big kick, I'd make sure to add some heat.

I served this last night and it was voted a keeper.  I adjusted it after reading some reviews, by seasoning the chicken with Paula Deens' house seasoning and my homemade taco seasoning after cutting into bite sized pieces.  After chicken was browned with some onion I added a large can of Rotel tomatoes and chilies with one can each of black beans and corn.  I served over brown rice.  Did not need the cumin. AWESOME.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This was an excellent base recipe. Per the suggestion of other reviewers, sauteed onion and garlic in the oil first, and then added other ingredients. I would recommend adding a tad more seasoning-- I used a little taco seasoning, and a few hits of chipotle poweder and chili powder as well as the suggested cumin. I also chopped the chicken into small pieces, and served the dish with Mexican-style rice-a-roni.

This was really easy and really good! I did have some diced onions on hand and also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and cayenne paper. Thats all I did extra! We ate wrapped in tortillas and sprinkled with cheddar cheese! Supper yummy! Husband really liked :)

This was an easy weeknight dinner. I added a LOT more spice than suggested, and it went over pretty well. I found that it had to cook a bit longer than directed.

This was very bland and the chicken turned out somewhat rubbery and flavorless.  I ended up just eating the toppings and leaving the chicken behind.

i served the chicken by itself, it had enough flavoring from cooking with the other ingredients all day. as a side i served brown rice and poured the southwest mixture over it and topped with low fat sour cream. i also substituted garbonzo beans, sounded wierd, but it was all we had and it was actually perfect with it! i cant believe it but my 5 and 2 year old loved it! it was sooo flavorful and delicous!!! this is a must for the weekly menu! it was simple and fast to make and my whole family loved it! :)

Very Good!  Added some things due to some folks saying it was bland.  I made the chicken in the oven wrapped tightly in foil (350 for 50 min) with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, a little cayenne and a drizzle of olive oil.  Always comes out juicy and tender for whatever recipe or just by itself.  I cooked some chopped onion and green pepper in a pot until onion was translucent, added juice from the diced tomatos and then about 3 chopped garlice cloves.  Once that cooked a bit, I added everything else and shredded the chicken with 2 forks and added that.  It seemed kind of dry so I added about 1/2 a can of chicken broth (14.5 oz).  We ate on soft tortillas with lettuce.  I'm sure adding sour cream and cheese would put it over the top, but we are trying to get rid of those extra holiday pounds.  My hubby was poking around in the pot and said, "You put beans in this??".  I explained we are dieting and they are filling.  He ended up having two helpings.  I would definitely make again.  Thanks Tamcattt!

Lighter than the typical mexican foods we eat, but still filling and satisfying.  I added some salsa, red onion and garlic at the start of simmering.  5 minutes before done sprinkled with mexican spices and chopped cilantro.  Served over rice.

I love this recipe; super easy, even a beginner like me could do it! I made one change, I put the can of tomatoes and green chile into my Magic Bullet to puree it -- I'm a texture eater and cannot stand to bite into a tomatoe! It made it a tiny bit soup, but I was still able to eat the meal with a fork!

Well, let me say, this was a bit of a let down after reading the 7 out of 8 - 5 star reviews on the first page.  I am with the one reviewer who said this is bland.  I stuck with the original recipe, then added the cumin, then paprika, then some oregano and some salt, and chili powder.  Still smelled just ok, (you know how you can tell by the scent of something on the stove it needs more umph).  Well I added 2-3 Tbsp of homemade taco seasoning, and hoped for the best.  My kids liked it.  (Amazingly since one doesn't like beans and the other doesn't like corn!) My dad thought it was just ok, my husband and I.. well... it wasn't bad or gross, it just wasn't good.  Served with side of rice and warm tortillas and shredded cheese.  I'm not even sure at this point what would make this 'better'.  There's a Mexican Casserole recipe from this site that I make all the time, the only difference: that's with ground beef (or I use turkey), no corn and a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Made this as written and it is good. I'm not a fan of 'southwest' foods but my husband loves it so I decided to make it. I'm glad I did because it was a nice change to what we normally have and he really loved this dish.

Overall, a very easy and simple meal that has good flavor. As others have noted, I did saute onion and garlic with the chicken. I will definately be making this again, but maybe try marinating the chicken beforehand to add more flavor.

This recipe was very good. I cut up the chicken in small chunks and sprinkled taco seasoning on them. I added an extra can of black beans and used a half pack of Goya hot picante mix along with a little chili powder. Served it over spanish rice.

Chicken did soak up some of the juices, but was a bit bland as one poster said. The veggies were really good and overall an excellent healthy recipe! I would make it again.

Really good basic recipe. 
I added cajun, chili powder  and tex mex seasoning as I felt it would be a bit bland without any. I also added cilantro once it was done cooking.
I think it would also be tasty with some shredded cheese on top.
Overall good recipe that I will make again

Yum! My boyfriend and his parents all approved. I did however tweak the recipe a bit. I added garlic, chili powder and cayenne pepper as well. Also, I cut the breasts into smaller pieces once it was broiling so the flavors could soak in more. Also added another can of green chili's. We like our foods HOT! Enjoy!

YUM! I made this last night as something "different".  It was wonderful!  Chicken was nice and moist and full of flavor.  I did add some cayanne pepper and a pinch of pepper flakes since I did not have tomatoes with the chili's.  Also, I had a ton of fresh tomatoes to use, so I diced them up to use instead, (about 2).  Will use this again!

Good but needs some salt, onions, garlic, etc. to flesh it out.

This was pretty good--didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  I'll have to customize it more next time.

This was a light but tastey chicken that didn't leave you full of guilt afterwards.  A nice way to dress up the meat without the heavy sauces or added fats.  I added plenty of fresh garlic/lime/cilantro to the mix along with a lil cayenne pepper to spice it up.

Here is what I did: I sprinkled 1 tbsp chilli powder & 1 tbsp minced onion spice over 1lb uncooked chicken pieces, and let sit for a few hours. I saut√© 4 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp cumin. Then I added 1 small onion. Next I browned the chicken pieces. and added the tomatoes, beans and corn. I let it all simmer for about 20 minutes, while I cooked some spanish rice.  It was awesome served over the spanish rice, as it would have been pretty liquidy to just plop on the plate as it was. Prepared this way, I give this 5 stars. Would be good topped with green onions and cheese too.

The only reason it got a 5 is b/c I added salt, pepper, and cumin to my chicken WHILE it was cooking. I wouldn't recommend cooking any chicken without any seasonings.

Quick, easy and incredibly tasty.  This one is a definitely a keeper!  I recommend using Frys/Kroger brand Fire Roasted salsa style canned tomatoes if you can find them.  They add some kick to anything you cook.

Not only is this a great meal, the beans are awesome the next morning with a fried egg on top with warm tortillas. If you want more flavor, try adding some tomato bullion (found in the Mexican aisle, if they also carry Herdez brand salsa casera 2 cans are perfect). This is a staple recipe at our house. Marinating the chicken in some of the salsa for a few hours beforehand makes it even nicer.

Had a ton of flavor!  I did add more cumin and some chili powder.  I put this in low carb flour tort. and served with a fresh spinach leaves with cilantro lime dressing (also from this site) and avacados on the side.  Very good and healthy...will make this again.

I made this recipe as written and it was very good.  There isn't anything particularly exciting or life-changing here.  Just a good weeknight dinner that only dirties a single pan and spoon.  I like that there are enough beans and corn in the pan to be served as a side dish and the green chiles in the tomatoes provide a subtle kick of spice.  I served this with baked potatoes for a good, quick dinner.  I will be using this recipe again.  The only change I will probably make in the future is seasoning the chicken before browning with some pepper, chili powder and garlic.

This dish is great!  It is very easy and enjoyable.  I added some hot red pepper to the chicken before browning each side, but that is just because I like spicy food.  I ate it over "Onion Rice," which is also found on this sight.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good, i didn't have tomatos so i used salsa instead, added cheese at the end and placed it all over rice---I did cut my chicken to more bite sized pieces.  Agree it needed some seasoning but my family ate it without issue!  Also used, refried beans as a side, and placed the sour cream on the table along with the salsa jar.  Very good!

This was good but it needed a little more spice to it for my liking.  I added Frank's Red Hot Sauce to it to give it more of a zing.

Excellent. Used Rotel original tomatoes with chilis. A little spicy for the kids but tasted amazing. Might need to use the Rotel mild next time. Seasoned the chicken with cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper like some of the reviews suggested. Served it with brown rice and everything came out amazing. Put a little cheese and sour cream on top for the kids. Definitely will be making this again.

Very good. I drained the tomatos and used it as taco filling.

Great, easy recipe!  I added a second can of tomatoes so that I could use the leftovers to make soup.

Yummy! I sauteed a yellow onion in olive oil, then added chicken coated with taco seasoning (from this site) to the pan. I browned the chicken, then sliced it. Then I added the tomatoes, beans and corn and simmered everything until the chicken seemed done. I didn't need to add any cumin or any extra spices because it was already so flavorful. I served it over brown rice and with sour cream and guacamole on the side. So easy, so tasty, and so healthy. A winner!

This is excellent! I cut my chicken into 1 inch pieces and we use this as stuffing for burritos or tacos. One of hubby's favorites!

This was absolutely delicous!  Although I wanted more of a stew so I substituted the black beans for diced potatoes.  I also added and extra can of green chilies (yum), extra cumin, and some snipped fresh cilantro.  Obviously to make it more like a stew, I also cut up the chicken into bite size pieces.  I know I changed it a lot, but I was great.

This turned out very well and was a big hit. I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the 10 oz can, and added extra cumin, paprika, Mexican seasoning, garlic and a dash of hot sauce. Instead of using the chicken breasts whole, I cut them into large (but still bite-sized) chunks, and that was just right. My boyfriend said it was one of his favorites! I served it with Onion Rice as another reviewer suggested, and they went very nicely together. I would certainly recommend it.

This is a great weeknight meal. I diced my chicken before browning it, so the entire meal (rice included) came together in less than 20 minutes. As written it is a bit bland, so be generous with your seasonings. This will be added to our rotation for busy night dinners. Thanks!

It was ok. Would I make again? Yes. It was fast and easy with little oil and sodium used. I would use the recipe because of this reason more so than the taste. I did add fresh garlic as some reviewers had mentioned, but stayed away from package seasonings for sodium reasons, the garlic added to the overall flavor ( I forgot to add the cumin).

This was pretty good, but I had to add a lot of spices to it to get it more flavorful. Great base recipe, just a little bland for our tastes. Thanks! :)

I like this recipe. We eat it over rice with sour cream, cheese and green onion. I increase the cumin in the recipe to 1/2 tsp and sprinkle on some garlic salt before it simmers.

Very good recipe.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and crushed red pepper flakes.  Didn't have any chili powder on hand.  I also cooked the chicken in olive oil cooking spray rather than in oil.  It was still very good and my fiance really liked it.

This recipe is good!! My hubby made this for the guys at the fire station and they like it.  He then made it for me the next day, delicous.  It is now a kepper in out cookbook with a few changes, I added garlic and onion and seasoned the chicken with cumin, chili powder, salt and pepper before sauteing in the pan.  Served over yellow rice.  Super good.

Suprisingly good.  My husband said it was his new favorite.  I took the advice of others and seasoned chicken before cooking.  Like them I used seasoning salt, onion powder, a little mexican seasoning called Cholupa, and some garlic powder.  Turned out great.

I thought this recipe was alright but had a bit too many beans in it. I thought it kind of diluted the other flavors. Overall it was alright, I may try it again sometime and modify it.

Very nice and filling!  I didn't have cumin, so I used garlic powder, chili powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper for seasoning.  I also browned an onion with the chicken and served everything over brown rice.  So easy to make from kitchen staples, and a great way to kill a craving for Mexican food without breaking the nutritional bank!

This recipe was quick and simple. I used chicken tenders to speed things up even more. As some of the other reviewers suggested, before browning I rubbed the chicken with a Cajun seasoning mix. I then set it aside and saut√©ed half an onion and a couple tablespoons of minced garlic until tender. Then I added the beans, corn and can of tomatoes and green chili‚Äôs, added the chicken back in and simmered for about 20 minutes. The chicken was so tender it could easily be cut with a fork. We had brown rice as a side. The meal pleased the entire family which included my 70 year-old ‚Äúnot so experimental‚Äù father and my 11 year-old daughter. It will go into our regular meal rotation as a quick and healthy choice with a nice little kick to it!

I have made this recipe several times this time instead of green chilies I added a can of "ranch style" beans (pinto) with sliced jalapeno peppers.  It gives it a great kick.  The easiest recipe ever.

Loved this.  I could not find cumin so I ended up sprinkling with cayenne, hubby was sniffling - thought it was too hot, but I loved it.  Loved the bean/corn mixture as a side dish.  Fixed some spanish rice with it.  Could add maybe a sprinkle of shredded cheese at the end and some sour cream for the snifflers.

This is a very colorful dish and looks great on a plate but unfortunately it doesn't have that much flavor.  Here in Texas we like our food to make a little more taste than this!!

Made it, liked it but thought I could improve.  This is what I did:  boiled 4 tomatillos in no fat, low sodium chicken broth with garlic and cilantro until soft.  Drained most of the liquid, pulled out stems on tomatillos and added to beans and corn mixture with additional diced garlic and onion.  I used 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. of cumin.  Poured mixture over the top of chicken and baked.  Squeezed the juice of 1 lime over top of chicken and served on low fat flour tortilla with slice of pepper jack cheese.  It was super good.

My husband made this for me and I am so proud of him!  It came out sooo good, and it was soo easy for him!!! We used kidney beans instead of black beans, so my 4 yr old devoured it too. Great recipe!

Love it Love it! I did use Pinto beans which when they broke down, they acted more like a refried bean coating. Tastes good, but not visually appealing. Would just use black beans, some garlic and a little bit of chili next time. Love the corn in there.

Delicious! Possibly my favorite chicken recipe from this site! My boyfriend and I loved every bite. We did add more spices though because we like things hot hot hot! I even added extra ingredients while simmering which provided me with a lot of leftovers that almost became a soup. So we added tortilla chips and cheese and enjoyed a quick version of tortilla soup for the next few days. All around a wonderful recipe.

This was tasty and SO EASY. No mess either. The only change I made was seasoning the chicken with a little extra cumin before browning it. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and thought they soaked up the flavor wonderfully. I love black beans, so I stuck with those. Served with Mexican Rice (also on allrecipes) and cornbread.

This tasted great, and the main reason I gave it 5 Stars is because my 19-month old gobbled up a huge bowlful of it!  Any recipe that gets my toddler to eat tomatoes, corn and beans gets a 5 in my book!  I'll make this again to make sure my little guy stays healthy!

I love the versatility of this recipe. I usually marinate the chicken breasts in oil, taco seasoning and garlic before cooking. I place the chicken breasts in aluminum foil and add the black bean, tomato and corn mixture on top with some cooked Mexcian-style rice and then baked them in the oven until the chicken is cooked through. The flavors really combine nicely. A great recipe alone but can also be used for a tasty enchilada or burrito filling. Thanks!

This was delicious and so easy to put together. I had some Cajun marinated chicken breasts which worked great. I also had some fresh cilantro on hand, so I sprinkled that over the top. Served with a sprinkle of shredded cheese on top with sour cream on the side. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe! Since I didn't have green chilies, I replaced them with chopped up jalapeno peppers. This recipe reminds me of the Arizona chicken recipe.

Very good.  I dredged the chicken in taco seasoning and then after cooking the chicken and adding the tomatoes, corn and beans, I added the remaining taco season to the vegetables and stirred.  Very tasty and easy!

Excellent! I used a can of Trader Joe's Cuban Style black beans and didn't drain them so it took a bit longer to simmer down. Per other reviewers, I also added cumin and fresh garlic.

I didn't think this was going to be very good, but there is SO much flavor to it. I add more cumin and some onions to it. Have some mexican rice with it and you're good to go! very good.

Quick and easy, but definitely a little blah.  Maybe if the chicken was marinated or rubbed with a spice rub before browning.  I served it with spicy Spanish rice and chips with pico de gallo.

This was a pretty good recipe- quick and easy, pretty good taste.  I followed some suggestions on here such as seasoning the chicken with garlic, chili powder, and cumin.  I also tried it with cheese and sour cream.  All in all pretty good.

Excellant!

I didn't change the recipe at all except I topped mine with salsa and low-fat cheddar cheese. I will definately move this into my rotation! Great recipe and good for you. Thanks!

This was just excellent!  It didn't take very long to make at all which is a huge plus for a working mom.  When it was finished, it didn't look very appealing but believe me it was fantastic.  I even forgot to add the ground cumin and it still turned out great.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks Tammy!

Excellent.  Very easy.  Would not change a thing.  I used a mexican canned tomato with cilantro and lime.

We really enjoyed this!  And healthy too.  I served this w/ Mahatma mexican rice and fresh fruit as an appetizer.  A total success, and the left overs kept well also.  I'll definately make it again.

Pounded the chicken breasts first, sauteeing in butter instead of vegetable oil. Added a LOT more seasonings, otherwise very bland. Topped with a Mexican four-cheese blend. O.K. but probably won't be making again.

This is a great recipe!  I served it over Spanish-style rice, and my husband and I both cleaned our plates.
