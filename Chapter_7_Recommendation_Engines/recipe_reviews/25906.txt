I make green beans all the time in this very same manner..here's a tip:  When you buy smoked sausage or have leftover ham, throw it in the food processor and always have it on hand in the freezer.  You will have DOUBLE the flavor in your dishes, but the sausage won't "steal the show". Perfect for green beans, purple hull peas, even gumbo, and soup.

Easy. I used smoked sausage. I will keep this but change the way it is cooked. Shorten the cooking time way too long.

This is one of my "go-to" vegetable dishes.  I cook the sausage first, then saute the onion (or shallot) and garlic in the sausage fat, plus a little extra oil.  Also, as as many have suggested I use beef broth instead of water and I use a healthy amount of garlic salt and pepper.  I finish it by using corn starch to thicken the remaining beef broth into a rich sauce.

Awesome recipe!  Even my two year old ate this. I used mild Italian sausage,out of the casing and chopped up.  Other than a little season all, it needed no other spices. I also used fresh green beans, so it did take the 30 minutes to finish.  I will definately be making this again.

I used fresh green beans and bacon instead of sausage.  I didn't even add the olive oil.  Excellent!

I left out the sausages and I think that may have messed it up, because there was no flavor then. Don't leave out the sausage, I tried it. It will affect the recipe.

This is sort of a classic meal. I made it for my roommates and they loved it. Part of the reason why I think is attributed to the very cold day we had in our city. It was also very filling, so to lighten the meal up for desert we had bananas and strawberries with chocolate sauce and brown sugar drizzled on top. This also made it a slightly more balanced meal.

I've made this several times over the last few years and this year I finally found the sausage that I like best.  I used Johnsonville "New Orleans Brand Andouille Recipe Spicy Smoked Sausage", which comes in large links about the size of a large hot dog.  I slice them and follow the recipe, using beef broth instead of the water.  Everyone really loved the green beans this year and the sausage was very tasty.  I'm making them again for Christmas.

Great recipe.  Even though I messed it up a bit (I only had canned green beans), I was happy that my family actually ate veggies and wanted more.  In the future, I look forward to making this the way it was supposed to be made.  Thanks!

What an excellent idea! I used a 1 lb. roll of country sausage. I fried it, adding 1 stalk of finely chopped celery and 1/2 of an onion chopped fine. I drained off the grease, then added 2 cans of green beans. I had some leftover potato patties in the fridge. I chopped them up and threw them in as well and cooked for a few minutes. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was ok, but not awesome.  We created the sauce by mixing in cornstarch with the leftover liquid and that definitely helped.  It just wasn't flavorful enough, though, and I'm not great enough at cooking to know what could've really helped and complimented the ingredients correctly.

A great receipe with some modifications.  Brown the sausage before the onion and garlic, use broth instead of water, and I used frozen french style green beans.  Yum!

This was great and so simple.  I used the frozen tiny Haricot Verts beans so the cook time was less.  I substituted chardonnay for the water.  I added it to the cooked onions, garlic and sausage and let it cook down some before adding the beans. Also added some Herbes de Provence.  Took this to a wine tasting and it was a hit.  Thank you.

Very simply - won't make this again - I had sausage and green beans that I needed to cook up before they went bad - I chose this based on that - no one cared for this dish.

This is a very versatile recipe.  I can't imagine all the creations you can come up with.  I made this as the green bean dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  It seemed to be liked by just about everyone.  I decided to use a chicken mushroom sausage, but I definitely think I will try it with the spicy sausage next time. I might even substitute pearl onions for the chopped ones.

I made this recipe with the meat of choice being Jimmy Dean's spicy sausage. The only exception was to add some mushrooms which were sauted with the onions and garlic. I gave this five stars because my wife raved about how good the green beans were. I thought it's one of the best ways to prepare green beans that I've had yet!

Wow!  This really is awesome!  I used Shaw's Supermarket brand Italian Chicken Sausage (sliced) and 1 lb. of frozen mixed whole green beans, and three good size new red-skinned potatoes (sliced).  I used 4 Elephant garlic cloves (instead of 6) with the onion, and added 2 beef boullion cubes.  I added fresh ground pepper, and a dash or two of seasoned salt.  The house smells fantastic!  Quick preparation and lots of raves!

I crumbled up 6 strips of bacon in lieu of the sausage, and this was really good.  There was alot of flavor too.  My dinner guests loved it with the italian-style green beans that I accidentally bought!

this was a really easy recipie, and was good, but nothing earth shattering.  I used fresh green beans, added a teaspoon of beef boulion and a tablespoon of brown sugar like someone had suggested.  I served this over "spicy rice" (rice cooked with a little curry and lemon pepper seasoning.)  with breadsticks on the side.  A great meal for those on a tight schedule.  From start to finish it took about 45 minutes.

This really didn't do it for me.  I did take the advice of others and used beef broth instead of water, so the beans actually had a really great flavor.  I just didn't like them paired with the sausage.  Personal perference I suppose!

Out of this world! Tired of bland side dishes, I seached this site & found this recipe. Wow, am I pleased! Didn't have to change much. I cut this recipe in half since there is just my husband & I. I used mild sausage links & crushed garlic in a jar instead of fresh. I cooked it for 25 mins, 5 less than the recipes states. I served this with some breaded pork chops. My picky husband even liked this recipe. The little bit of leftovers I have will be good for lunch along with the leftover mashed potatoes from another night. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

For a green bean dish this was very good. We used a sweet brown sugared link sausage instead of a spicy one and everyone just loved it. Everyone went back for seconds. We will make again in the near future.

I have a mass amount of fresh green beans to use up, so I used them.  I also happened to have 2 left over Italian sausages so I cut those up and this made a great meal for me & side dish for the others.  I really liked the blend, next time I may try vegetable broth instead of the water.  Thanks Kari!

This recipe is really good, my family loves it.  I used canned grean beans instead of frozen and I used the liquid from the can and omitted the water.  I also tryed it with bacon instead of sausage and it was good like that also.

I'm a vegetarian, but this is one dish that I really miss from childhood.  I decided to try this recipe using Boca brand vegetarian smoked sausage.  I cooked it just like the recipe said, and it was fantastic! I only had about one pound of beans, so I halved the recipe and used two sausage links.  Even if you're not a vegetarian, this is a great way to cut back on fat and calories.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very, very good recipe. I used this for a dinner for 25 and got great reviews. Very easy to make and well worth the effort! And, as an added bonus, it reheated well for the little bit of leftovers that remained.

I have been making this recipe for the past two years for thanksgiving.  Only I substitute chorizo sausage.  It is a really big hit and I get asked to make it each time.

Because I didn't have any sausage, I fried up some bacon and added that instead. It tasted pretty good!

This was great with fresh string beans.  Freshly ground pepper improved the flavor.
