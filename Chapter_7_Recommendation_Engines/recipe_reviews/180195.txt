I don't like a lot of ice, I added used three cubes just to make it cold. I did not have whipping cream, I used fat free half n half instead. Very good flavor but extremely foamy. I think I'd like to try this over ice instead of making a smoothie out of the ingredients, then re-review.

The only reason for the 4 star rating is b/c the quantity of ice is too vague.  The flavour otherwise is very good!
