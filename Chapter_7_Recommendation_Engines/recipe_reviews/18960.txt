This is a great punch.  I had it at my daughter's wedding and at my father's wake.  I had to refill at both occasions. Everyone loved the punch.  Now, they are requesting it at Christmas also.

This was a very good punch. Not to sweet and very light.  I was short 1c of the pineapple juice and added 1 extra c of the ginger ale.  Everyone loved it, I will be making this again.

I loved this punch, and so did everyone at my son's birthday party! I used Sprite instead of Ginger Ale, and bought the Edys orange sherbet with vanilla ice cream all ready mixed in. Awesome!!!

I served this super-simple punch at a reception for my piano students' recital, and parents and students alike raved over it!  It couldn't be easier, and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I made this punch for a wedding shower where both men and women attended.  Everyone raved about it and kept coming back for more!  It will be my punch recipe from now on.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit both with the adults and the kids. The kids didn't want to try it at first but when they did they asked for seconds and thirds. Will make it again for sure!

Very good!  Not too sweet and also used Dreyer's orange sherbet with vanilla ice-cream.
