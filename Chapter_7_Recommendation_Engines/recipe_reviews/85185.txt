Wow, a one star review just because it mentions bottled hot sauce.  I grew up with a mexican best friend and learned lots of my cooking (including chorizo and eggs) from her mom.  There was always a bottle of Tapatio on the table and we always splashed it on.  I agree that jack cheese may be 'americanized', but come on, loosen up a little bit... it's a good recipe for chorizo and eggs.

Excellent. So good I had it 3 or 4 times in one week.  Even better to saute peppers and onions before adding the eggs.  Also made once with colby jack cheese and it was great too.  Good with or without hot sauce.  I recommend making sure you use corn tortillas, not flour, as the texture and flavor make this dish better.

These are delicious!  Actually, this is my husband's favorite recipe to make so I just get to enjoy eating them!  To save on number of skillets used, he browns up the chorizo then just adds the eggs and scrambles them up with the chorizo.  Corn or flour tortillas both fine but a little tastier with corn. We use Cholula Sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, this makes a great breakfast!

Yummy! This is a typical breakfast meal here in south Texas. My son loves these. I use small (6-7 inch)flour tortillas instead of corn, but I guess it's just a matter of preference. I make a bunch of them up in advance and freeze them as they reheat well and make a great hot breakfast on the go. This is really good with sage sausage too. Thanks Bearnesta for sharing this favorite!

My whole family loves these - including the 3 year old.  We usually saute onions and peppers to add to the eggs and also top with a mixture of fresh tomatoes and diced green onion. Following the directions included in this recipe for warming the corn tortillas is important - just warming in the microwave or in foil in the oven does not do the trick!

Being Mexican, I make this a lot....like atleast once a week for breakfast. I dont put the chorizo in the tortillas like tacos though.. Something else I do is just fry chopped potatoes, then add the chorizo, then add the eggs. You can eat this with tortillas or you buy bolio (bread), slice it open and make a torta (sandwich). I eat with canned jalapenos or homemade green salsa...but I also like it with Valentina sauce.
Forgot to mention that eggs and chorizo tastes really good with sliced avocado on the side.

I have made this similiar recipe for years for my family. I use flour tortillas and add onion, green and/or red pepper to the egg mixture. The chirozo is the best! Top with sour cream and salsa...YUM!

This is an excellent recipe.  More like a breakfast burrito than a taco.  I used ground turkey breast breakfast sausage to cut back on the fat, colby/jack cheese and I mixed the salsa in with the eggs & sausage mixture.  Also used large flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  Made leftovers into individual breakfast burritos and froze.  They reheat well without getting soggy.  Will definitly keep these on hand in the freezer for a quick breakfast.  Yeah, Yeah, I know it's not "authentic" Mexican, but it is a very yummy recipe.

Pretty basic recipe here.  Just chorizo, eggs and cheese.  How else would you make it? I suspect that all the rave reviews are coming from folks who have never tried chorizo before.  If you have, you wouldn't think there was very much to this recipe.  Pretty tasty, but very basic.

Just reading this recipe brings back wonderful memories. My great grandmother used to serve us something very similar minus the cheese (she was from Mexico and very emphatically anti-cheese) with added diced, fried potatoes and served with re-heated pinto beans and homemade tortillas. I can't even begin to describe the taste. She mixed the chorizo, eggs and potatoes together, piled into the tortilla and we had the beans on the side. A more perfect combination has yet to be thought of. Try this recipe, you'll be glad you did.

This is pretty much the same recipe I grew up on and continue to make for my family. So simple and delicious. I prefer it with queso fresco if we have any. Oh, and Mexicans do eat hot sauce. I use Tapatio on everything if I don't have any homemade salsa.

I do a variation of this recipe as well. we call them breakfast burritos! but because my husband is so picky i tend to make everything separately. i prepare the scrambled eggs and set aside. then i do the chorizo and set aside. i also tend to make bacon and crumbled breakfast sausage for people that don't like chorizo. we use hash browns or fried potatoes then dress it like a burrito with sour cream, salsa, tomatoes, cheese, and tabasco (don't let that other person tell you mexicans don't like tabasco, i love it), etc. there is no wrong way to prep your breakfast burrito!

I am full blooded Hispanic come from a family who cooks all authentic Mexican food. In Our house we had bottled hot sauce, to this day still do for my own family. If you want the real thing its better to make salsa but is time consuming. I have been making this dish for years with my mother cooking and now with my children. Its a great recipe!

I have been making this for thirty something years after dating a man of hispanic origin for a few years. Even raising my kids on it.  They prefered this over pancakes on the weekends.
The only thing I did different was to first brown some peeled potato pieces in the leftover chorizo grease and if a quality chorizo I would have to add a bit of butter to brown the the potatos.  I would then add back the chorizo then add the eggs and cook.  I would also then melt the cheese to the top of the eggs and then scoop out and serve in the tortillas.  I usually used flour tortillas that I heated directly on my gas burners, flipping them as they puffed up and toasted.
By the way, this is not just a breakfast, this makes a great supper dish as well, it is one of those comfort meals that makes your kitchen smell so fragrant with the spice of the chorizo, and fills the tummies of even those who seem to be bottomless.

My husband is from Mexico and when we were first married, he would make this every Saturday (adding diced potatoes).  I had not attempted to make it myself, so I thought I would surprise him.  I made this all by myself and he was sooo impressed.  Of course he had to show me up my making his homemade tortillas......but this recipe is something that I just LOVE!  I can blame a little weight gain on this one here.

I used portuguese sausage instead of chorizo that I bought on sale at Grocery Outlet and a new kind of tortilla I found on my last grocery trip that is half flour/half corn. I used my own homemade salsa. My boys really chowed down on this. I loved it because it was cheap and easy to make. Next time I make this, I'll throw in some onion, garlic, peppers and mushrooms just to beef it up a little more.

Love these! I've been making them for years. I have found we like it better in a flour tortilla instead of corn. But it's fabulous either way. And adding onions and green peppers also gives this a flavor boost.

Made this for dinner tonight - so awesome. I used beef chorizo since I don't eat pork, and used a mix of flour and corn tortillas. I had 2 tacos, 1 flour, 1 corn. I liked the corn the best, but the flour was pretty awesome too. I just cooked the eggs in the pan w/ the sausage to save myself a few dishes to wash and it worked perfectly. Awesome dish, love that i can make taco-truck tacos at home!

This is a regular at our home. I've been making chorizo and egg tacos, burritos, plates, etc., since I was a little kid. We always have a range of bottled hot sauces. You can save a pan by just adding the eggs to the chorizo. And save a pan for warming the tortillas if you have gas burners. Just warm them on the flames with tongs. Also a dab of sour cream, cilantro and cheddar are great compliments to this recipe. :)

My husband is mexican and is VERY picky about everything he eats. Me being a vegetarian, I can't rate this based on what I thought of it but the presentation was nice and he loved it. Although it may not be as authentic as his mom's cooking he actually asks for it quite often and that is very uncommon with him! Sometimes I add peppers and onions but he actually prefers it without. We always use homeade flour tortillas and hot sauce, half the salsa. Thanks for the recipe!

A delicious, quick and different twist for breakfast.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used shredded taco cheese that I had on hand instead of the shredded Monterey Jack.  Yummy!

Great recipe. I've been making variations of this recipe for decades: sausage and egg, bacon and egg, potato and egg, etc. Of course you can add cheese, hot sauce, chopped jalapenos, fried corn tortilla chips (migas). I prefer flour tortillas for breakfast tacos, but whatever floats your boat is fine. And don't worry about whether the ones you make are "authentic" or not. Just add what you like, omit what you don't like or don't have available, and enjoy. 
One tip I would like to share: When you bake potatoes for dinner, bake a couple extra and use them in this recipe within the next 2-3 days.

Pretty good! We didn't change the recipe this time. Next time, we are adding peppers and onions. I'd eat it either way.

Very good. For another breakfast variation, I fry frozen cubed potatoes with 1 small chopped onion, and season with salt and granulated garlic while cooking. Mix in cooked chorizo and eggs. Place mixture over a warmed flour tortilla and add a little sour cream. I use Tapatio hot sauce, no salsa, and sprinkle with shredded Mexican cheese blend in place of Monterey Jack cheese. Wrap into a burrito. Delicious!

AWESOME recipe!  Great directions, too.  I usually make breakfast burritos for my husband and anyone that knows that burritos are usually made with flour tortillas and TACOS with corn tortillas can appreciate this recipe.  I didn't change a THING!  I will suggest using a cast iron skillet for heating the tortillas, that is what my mom always used, and Tapatio hot sauce. We owned a Mexican restaurant when I was little and my aunt was the prominent cook/chef and she made something similar to this for us in the morning with shredded cotija cheese.  ANYONE that would give this recipe a mediocre or bad rating obviously does not know how to prepare these correctly so they should just stick to Jimmy Dean or McDonalds and quit trying to cook!  SHEESH!

Om nom nom tacos! nom nom...

I had some jalapenos and a tomato laying around, so I diced up borth about 1/4" chunks, and sautéed them in the pan for about 2 minutes before adding the egg/milk mixture, followed by the chorizo.
Also used Sharp Cheddar instead of Monterey, since I prefer cheddar and had some there.
Topped with a spoonful of sour cream!!
Om nom nom....

It's a common egg & tortilla breakfast recipe... Americanized only with the shredded cheese & tabasco (use COTIJA  CHEESE OR QUEZO FRESCO) & yes, most Mexicans use Bottled hot sauce ( Tapatio, Cholula, etc) ... Thanks for sharing!

I love Mexican food, and especially tacos! (However, I've come to prefer tostadas or quesadillas, as you get all layers of ingredients in each bite.) When I make this, I add the eggs into the cooked chorizo, so they mix with the juices (okay-FAT!) for more flavor. And to save a pan, you can heat your tortillas right over a gas burner - they get nice charred spots on them. And yes - BOO to grumpy BEACHQUEEN1!  I know for a fact that lots of Mexicans DO eat bottled sauces & salsas - not everyone has the desire to make everything from scratch!

Very good...Chorizo is pretty greasy and it ran down my arms as I ate it, but it tastes good and is pretty. Queso fresco would be better than monterey jack.  I added sour cream because the wife loves it.

Excellent!  A really tasty alternative to the 'traditional' breakfast!  Followed the recipe to a tee, though we made sure to use hot chorizo.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I made this for breakfast for my work and everyone really liked it. I did do a couple things differently. I used 1 lb. of spicy pork. I think 1.5 pounds would be too much. Next time I'm going to buy the bigger can of crescents so I can make the crust go up the edge of the pan more. Some members recommended cooking the crescents for 5-10 minutes first which I did but don't think I will do that next time. And you have to bake this for at least 30 minutes. Cook time is way off.

This was quick and everyone liked it.  We added fresh avocado slices on top.  Of course, if I had more time it would be nice to have made homemade salsa.  We used Trader Joe's Salsa Verde instead.  We also used Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo sausage since we a vegetarian and gluten-free.  The only tricky part was heating enough tortillas in time before the eggs cooled.  Next time I may heat them in the pan before cooking the eggs, top with cheese, then keep them warm in the oven on a cookie sheet until we're ready to dish them up.

This was good, but very messy.  Perhaps I will actually fry the tortillas next time until they are crisp before I top them with the ingredients.

It was a hit at our home this morning for breakfast! Yum!  I did saute some onions and mushrooms as suggested. I also had a leftover twice baked potato which I cutup and added to onions and mushrooms before adding the egg mixture!  Delicious served with some salsa and sour cream! Next time I'll make sure I have some avocado to add.

Yes, very tasty indeed!  However, other then eaten as a once in awhile treat for breakfast, and unless most of the ingredients were replaced by healthier options (i.e., ground turkey, wheat tortilla, egg whites, low fat cheese) - then you are looking at coronary makin's.

I really enjoyed this -especially because I had everything on hand and was looking for something simple. I browned the chorizo with some onions then added the eggs and thre in some pepper jack cheese at the end. I think it's very important to use corn tortillas and crisp them slightly as directed in the recipe. It really makes the dish. I put a little fresh cilantro (I love fresh cilantro!!) on them, a bit more cheese and served with homemade salsa. Yummy late night snack!

My husband and I just ate these for our Christmas breakfast, while listening to Lou Reed, Van Halen, and Back Sabbath CDs we just unwrapped. Thanks for your part in helping us celebrate a holiday unlike the same ole same ole. We love this recipe, wouldn't change a thing, will make it again and again. Take care.

I don't like Chorizo so I use regular sausage or I add onion and red peppers to the eggs while I am cooking them.  I don't use hot sauce, I use hot salsa.  I also use flour tortillas.  Breakfast tacos are my favorite breakfast since living in San Antonio, TX for 20 years.  They were to die for there.  A very wide variety of breakfast tacos.

I have been dating a Mexican for three years and when we go out for breakfast on the weekends, we always get chorizo and eggs. This was just as good as the dish at the restaurant we always visit (or even better if you can get homemade tortillas from a local tienda). While every Mexican I've met does eat store-bought sauce as well as homemade, I'd suggest Cholula hot sauce because I think it tastes richer than Tabasco. I'd also add some diced tomatoes and skip the cheese (Americanized but still tasty, I guess). Try it with some whole or refried black beans and you've got a perfect breakfast!

I love these.  So easy to throw in a pan in the morning and done in minutes.  I usually just throw some cheese into the eggs before I add the chorizo back into the pan and I think they are great just as they are without salsa on top.

Superb! I think a lot of the flavor of this will depend on the quality of your chorizo.  I grew up with chorizo being scrambled with eggs and served up in tortillas with fried potatoes.  THIS way, however, is MUCH better!  We served ours up with monteray jack/green chile cheese, sour cream, cilantro and salsa for those who wanted it.  I was surprised at how much better I liked this vs the "old" way!

This is not what we eat here in Mexico, but it is what mexicans eat in the US. In here,when we have huevos con chorizo (eggs and chorizo) we just fry the chorizo and add the eggs ans salt, that is all, some people eat it with bread others like it with corn or wheat tortillas, but the tortillas are served aside, some take a tortilla and make a taco, others just take a bite of the eggs and then a bite of the tortilla, same with the salsa, homemade or from a can (not the liquid kind like tabasco or habanero, just green or red blended salsa), some like it some don't, I personally think the chorizo flavor is strong enough, pouring salsa over it is too much for me; and you can serve the dish with re-fried beans or fresh avocado slices. I just don't know where to get the Monterey Jack and I'll change the tortillas for tostadas, they will be easier to eat

Beachqueen1 is sure picky. A number of my Mexican friends use bottled hot sauce. I enjoy this recipe and occasionally make hot sauce, but more often use bottled.

I made these for me & the husband since he's never had them before. I grew up eating this as a kid and I must say this was close to how my mother made it. Only we didn't add milk to the eggs and we ate them with flour tortillas but they are good when eaten with corn tortillas as well. I also cut out the tobasco sauce. I'll make these again soon.

Fantastic!  Easy to modify as you like, adding mushrooms, etc.  But the kids love eggs and I love chorizo, and both of them together is a hit for everyone!

I didn't have chorizo or any sausage on hand, but had left-over taco meat, so I used that.  It tasted great and was a great way to use up left-overs.  Also sauteed some onions before cooking the eggs, per other reviewers. Very yummy and filling!

This is very similar to what I grew up with, and what I have been cooking for years.  Try making your own chorizo, several good ones here on Allrecipies. I don't like the ingredients listed in the store bought (questionable to my stomach) and way to greasy for me.

I am sure this recipe is very good,since it is another variation of cooking up eggs with chorizo,and you really can't go wrong with a chorizo recipe.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe, but changed it up a little bit to exclude the chorizo sausage and substitute it with ground chicken breast to make this meal a little leaner. It worked out well. I used 16 oz. chicken for 10 servings. I cooked the ground chicken with onions, garlic, salsa and 1/2 - 1 cup tomato sauce (canned) with mexican spices and cilantro. Using the spatula to break up the meat while stirring it constatly helps to prevent the chicken from becoming crispy and too dry. Then I followed the rest of the instructions from the original recipe to create a very delicious sunday brunch. Enjoy!

I love Mexican food and this is some of the best I've had.  I'm a vegitarian so I left out the sausage.  I used southwestern style egg beaters (not diluted with milk), flour tortillas, fiesta cheese blend, and the jalapeno queso spread on this site and they were amazing.  I keep a steady supply in the refridgerator by request.

We eat breakfast burritos all the time.  We also use homemade flour tortillas, potatoes, and onions.  Sometimes we'll add some green chiles to it, too.  Mmmmm!

Nice change for breakfast!! Only changes I made was using flour tortillas because I thought the corn would compete with other flavors.  And to scramble the eggs alone with out diluting them with milk.

Excellent and easy, one of our new favorite breakfasts.  I love this recipe as is, but might try to vary it up in the future maybe by adding potatoes.

Good recipe. I was very surprised that it didn't include onions and peppers. Like other reviewers, I added them anyway for more flavor. I served the tacos with a side of Patatas Bravas sans dipping sauce.

My family loved this recipe and it truely is authentic. The flavor and heat are just right for us.  This is in response for the reviewer that says Mexican families wouldn't use bottled hot sauce on their breakfast tacos. Living here in southern California, I have many hispanic neighbors and friends.  They all use bottled hot sauce on their meals LOL.

I'm writing from Mexico, I agree that this is not an "authentic mexican breakfast recipe" but it's delicious! a nice mexican-american twist. I used the Tabasco sauce when I would normally just use fresh made salsa, and it took me a while to get the Monterey Jack (I would normally use a fresh crumbled cheese like Cotija on these) and yum! really good! I will be making this again, and my kids loved it!

i enjoyed this recipe.  i have been making a similar on for many yrs that i had learned on a trip, deep into mexico.  the tortillas were cut up and fried crispy, and hot dogs were sliced and also fried.  to that the eggs were added and it all came together with a side of refried beans!

Made this again, over 10 years later and it's still a delicious simple breakfast recipe. 12/22/2008 Made these for guests at my home yesterday after a long night of Santarchy. They didn't have any ground chorizo at the store I went to, so I bought sausages and cut them open to get the ground pork out.

Great recipe!  I already had some mexi shredded chicken on hand, so I used that instead of chorizo.  I can't wait to try that with it.  Very tasty!  I'm always looking for good, easy breakfasts and this fits the bill!  Thanks!

we had these tacos for dinner tonight and my husband and i both thought they were excellent. I added sauteed onion, red pepper and mushrooms. I used the flour tortilas and although i thought they were fantastic i will try the corn next time.

My family loves this recipe for a quick breakfast option. My left-over-crazy husband and son even love ALL(including the eggs) of this warmed up a second morning if we had too many leftovers. I, being a purist, love it freshly made above all else.

These are great.  I don't particularly care for chorizo, so I used sage sausage instead.  I also prefer the flour tortillas.  But these were a big hit.

Great base recipe and can easily be personalized with extras as toppings (potatoes, cilantro, avacado, salsa fresca, black beans, onions, sour cream/plain yogurt, shredded cabbage).  Reheats nicely in small potions, making it an easy weekday breakfast too)

I have no idea if these are "authentic" or not. However, I do know that they are OUTSTANDING. Followed the recipe except for the milk. Garnished with avocado and PW Restaurant Style Salsa. Will definitely make these again and often.

Great!  I added enchilada sauce and put it in the oven for about 15 minutes. My husband adds guacamole and salsa. It was good just as the recipe is and only gets better with the additions.

This is my new favorite taco. We took out the meat and put in onions, mushrooms and peppers that were sauteed in olive oil. Excellent meatless meal.

This is a nice basic recipe for breakfast tacos.  Nothing fancy, but oh so satisfying.  Depending on what's in the fridge, I sometimes will dress it up with sauteed red/green peppers or onions, potatoes, Hatch green chili's, etc.  If you don't have Queso Fresco cheese, the Monterey Jack works just fine.  And, no, I am not Mexican, but I too always serve this with Tapatio, Cholula, Valentina, or whatever hot sauce is at hand.  My family loves this!

I've been making breakfast tacos for a long time by just trying my own recipes.  I didn't think this was anything special.  It was good,  but not great and I don't think I'll bother making it again. I did like the corn tortillas. I will use those again for other recipes.

Made this for breakfast for my family this morning and it was excellent! I sautéed the chorizo with onion and red pepper. When you put all the ingredients in the corn tortilla, it tastes just like a taco. Will be making this again.

I love these tacos!  I have made them several times just as written. They are delicious.  They're a great change from our traditional breakfast dishes. I like doubleing the recipe so I have left overs. They reheat well. The salsa on the top is great touch!

Not my favorite. This was my first time trying chorizo that pretty much ruined the dish for me.

I was giving this exact recipe (with the pepper & onion from video) years ago from my south Texas sister-in-law.  It's a great spicy hot breakfast guaranteed to warm up any tummy on a cold northern winter morning.  I sometimes add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt to even out the heat.

Another Texas girl here. I've been making these for many years. Other than green peppers and onions I also like to add hash browns or other types of fried potatoes.

Pretty quick and easy to make.  I added chopped onions with chorizo as it browned for extra flavor.  Overall a delicious recipe that is definitely a repeater.

Thanks for the recipe! Loved it! I used the soy chorizo from Trader Joe's (I don't eat pork) it was fantastic! I didn't have any milk but was able to make the egg mixture work without it, lol! Can't wait to try adding didn't stuff in the future!

I crumbled up queso and mixed it with the eggs I also did not add hot sauce or salsa, I felt it would take away from the flavor. I added cilantro to the top all in all it was great and filling!

This is very traditional.  Our Mexican family makes them this way but we seldom use cheese.  It is a taco (corn tortilla) and if you want a burrito, use flour tortillas.  Rice or potatoes are a good addition for burritos.  Splash a little vinegar (during cooking) or lime juice when served (op.) to brighten the flavors. Egg whites are not necessarily healthier. The egg yolk has all the vitamins and some of the protein.  Cholesterol is hereditary according to my doctor.  Mine is good and I eat whole eggs every day.  I like my food a little hot, hubby doesn't so I use Tobasco or Louisiana hot sauce. We make our own salsa, we call it pico de gallo.  Onions, tomatoes, fresh cilantro (no salt). Salt extracts the moisture from the veg.

Delicious.  The chorizo was perfect after allowing it drain before combining.  A few diced potatoes might be good cooked with chorizo.

I love this.  I have always made my own chorizo (i don 't like salivary glands in the premade).  I use the Tampico dry mix with regular breakfast sausage & marinatme overnight.  It is much better & I control the amt. of spice.

The chorizo sausage is basically simply like a hot Italian sausage so if you aren't into spicy sausage use a mild type of sausage. But anyone who like the heat will enjoy this breakfast to start the day.
One commenter stated this is a basic recipe but from this you can dress it up anyway you like by adding ingredients.

I add a couple chopped mushrooms, diced peppers and onions to the chorizo and when that's all cooked, add an egg to hold it together. I prefer a flour burrito sized tortilla, assemble then bake until crispy. Salsa and sour cream garnish.

I have been eating chorizo and eggs all my life. But never with Tabasco. Being of Mexican-America heritage, we use Tapatio or Cholula. We also do not make tacos but tear the tortilla in bite size pieces and scoop up the eggs.

This is quickly becoming a breakfast staple in my house. 
The only modification I made was to crisp the tortillas in a lightly oiled skilled. It really takes the recipe to another level. 

It's really easy. You just heat the oiled skillet over medium heat, place the tortilla in the skillet and quickly build the taco while it's still in the skillet, fold in half and serve.

My Mexican mother in law taught me to fry the chorizo until almost done then add the scrambled egg mixture into the same skillet (why dirty an additional skillet?) , she also added finely chopped onion and garlic to the scrambled egg. Also, as she had a gas range she would warm the tortillas right on the burner. Of course homemade salsa was a must (for her the hotter the better !)

Something others forget to mention is how easy it is to sub other meats for the chorizo. Leftover meats from tacos, tamal fillings, etc. Made some tamales last night, ran out of masa, so breakfast tacos this morning!

What happened to the onion and bell pepper in this recipe that the video showed. That looked like a nice addition to the eggs and chorizo.

I have made this several times now. It is such a hearty,easy breakfast. I just use the sausage that I have on hand.Today it was just plain breakfast sausages. I  saute peppers,onions,crumbled sausage together,add the  beaten eggs.I use a cast iron pan for the corn tortillas . they get nice and crispy,top tortillas  with egg,sausage mixture  and cheese...eat with salsa...so yummy.

I made these with whole wheat tortillas. They were not spicy at all, on their own. I did add some cubed potatoes and onion; and used a very small amount of sour cream to hold the edges of the tortilla together. We have leftovers and will freeze some for grab-n-goes; but will add hot sauce to them before assembling to freeze. Not sure if I will make this again, but if I do I will be sure to add more spice while cooking.

first, Chorizo can be purchased as Pork or Beef, Perhaps it is also made from other fatty meats as well I have heard of Goat Chorizo, it is made from the Salivary glands, lymph nodes & jowels of the pig mixed with spices and packed in the casing which are the intestines. I was taught how to prepare chorizo by a mexican, you brown the chorizo add eggs and scramble together I prefer to add sharp cheddar cheese to melt in the mixture, I serve with sour creme and top with more cheese, Jack or Cheddar and avocado when available. I find this served with Corn tortillas better than flour.  Someone asked about how to prepare black beans, 1st go to market, buy a package of black beans, follow cooking directions printed on the package, like any beans, you simply boil them slowly in water, can add onion garlic meat or whatever else you want, cook until soft easily mashed between your fingers.

My husband and I make this all the time. We add green or red pepper. He scoops it with his tortilla (the authentic way) but I like eating as a taco with fixings inside.

Before frying the chorizo, I fried some chopped onion and jalapeño (half chili) and then added the sausage, fried until it's a little brown and then added the whisked eggs, din't add milk......cook until firm and serve with hot tortillas, cheese is a good addition but refried beans are better.....

My sector in the office gets together every Friday for breakfast.  Each Friday a different person in the group makes or brings something in for everyone to eat.  This Friday was my turn and I brought in the breakfast tacos... Was a big hit! I made at home and bright in. Very easy to prepare. I added red peppers and onions to eggs.   I cooked sausage separately because there is a vegetarian.   I'm already planning to make again for camping trip!

I add cooked home fries and top the chorizo, egg, and potatoes, with cheese, sour cream, and taco sauce. That's a huge success at our house.

All 5 because this is a great, easy recipe.  So many variations from this recipe.  I use either tofu or an organic turkey spicy sausage.  Sometimes add spinach to the eggs. I do use an organic locally made hot sauce, but shouldn't get a 1 star because the hot sauce is bottled...

This is one of my favorite  Mexican dishes.  I first learned about it from a co-worker who brought  me this breakfast treat to try.
She called it "chilaquiles" and I think the only difference in the recipe seen here and what I enjoyed are the corn tortillas which were cut  into triangles and mixed in with the sausage/egg  and topped with cheese.   That's the only change I would make to this tasty recipe--making the tortilla closer to bite size and included in the mixture.

Everything is great! I also used a smidgen of cumin powder. It adds that smokey flavor. I also used chihuahua cheese. Lastly.......no Chicago taco is complete unless you top it with diced onion and diced cilantro. That reeeeeeaaaally brings it all together.

Very simple, very good. I used poblano peppers instead of green bells, and thinly sliced red onions. Spreading a thin layer of refried beans on the tortilla before the cheese is a variation I've used. Warmed Ro-Tel also makes a great topping.

I haven't tried this, but.....we had a little Mexican place with two ladies that barely spot English close to my old job.  Their breakfast burritos had some refried beans in them also.  They were exceptional.
