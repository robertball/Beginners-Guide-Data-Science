This was very tasty!  The only changes I would make would be to add plenty of minced garlic to the sauteed onions, then when the onions are done, blend in a tablespoon or two of tomato paste to give the sauce a little more body.  Then don't add the mushrooms until about 15 minutes before the dish is done.  Will definitely make again.

This was excellent and so easy to make.  I cooked the bacon first though, and then cooked the chicken for a minute in the drippings instead of cooking the chicken in oil (removing) and then cooking the bacon in the oil like the recipe stated.  Also added a bit of fresh garlic with the onions (I used shallots). Delicous

Pure goodness. I only used the breast & thighs of a whole cut up chicken in this (there was only two of us). I coated my chicken w/ some flour and then browned it and set it aside. I added a couple of tbs of margarine and sauted the mushrooms in that pan along with a couple of shallots that I subbed for the onions. I added the wine and then reduced it, then added some chicken broth, about 1/2 cup and seasonings. I peeled and seeded the tomatos (I use roma's), quartered them and simmered it all together for about 30 minutes. Served it over steamed rice......an absolutly "guest worthy" recipe.

So good!  My family really loved this recipe.  I followed it very closely-- my only deviations were to add some chopped artichoke hearts (my husband and I love them) and I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, drained, since fresh tomatoes didn't look so good at the store.  This is was very, very flavorful.  I served it over egg noodles with steamed spinach.  My kids even enjoyed the chicken.  I will make this one again.

This recipe was very good. Not quite as good as I had thought it was going to be though. My kids liked it but my friend who was here for dinner did not like it at all. I think the next time I make this recipe I will try it without the wine or perhaps get a better wine than cooking wine I had on hand. I think it was my cheapy wine that threw the flavor off.

With just a few tweaks, this is 5 stars.  I doubled the fresh herbs and held off putting in the basil until the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Before I browned the chicken I dredged it in flour seasoned w/ s&p, and a trace of chipotle powder for a touch of smoke, as I don't eat red meat (the bacon).  Since I used the flour and no bacon, I added a bit more oil before sauteeing the veggies.  I included a couple of coarsely diced carrots and 2 minced cloves of garlic w/ the onions & mushrooms, as I'd seen in other, similar recipes.  Two full-sized tomatoes make a lb. if, like most Americans, you don't have a food scale.  For the cooking wine, I chose a decent Garnacha--an inexpensive, low tannin, Spanish red, but if you can get Dolcetto on sale that would be great.  Don't forget to offer lots of crusty Italian bread to sop up the sauce.

Time I rated this one as I have used it many times - it is excellent - sometimes I have used both red and white wine in this depending what I have left over - either turns out equally well and I add a little crushed garlic - we love it - thank you.

I didn't have a whole chicken so I used chicken breasts. This recipe was one of the best! I loved the bacon flavoring in the background, not too overwhelming. I did spice mine up quite a bit with lots of fresh garlic and lots of cayenne pepper...A keeper in my household!

I almost never cook with any chicken besides boneless, skinless breasts, but I did make this as the recipe called for. Thankfully the grocery store had whole already-cut-up chickens, so that made things easier. I thought it would be way too much food for my 3-person family, but it was great! We all really enjoyed it, including the semi-picky -yr-old. I loved the sauce over rice I served with it, also. It's already on this week's menu again. Thanks!

Excellent!  Added 3 cloves of minced garlic and used a very good quality Zinfandel as my wine.  Served with roasted red potatoes and garnished with Parmesan cheese right before serving.

I was hesitant to make this recipe but i had chicken thighs i didnt know what to do with.  Well, it turned out great and very good flavor...I will make this one of my regulars!  Great recipe for cheap cuts of chicken.  I added green pepper to give more color and it was good!  I also thickened the sauce alittle with flour water.

This was great. I used canned tomatoes (Muir Glen 28 oz can) and it was great. Got bit thick at the end of cooking (I kept it on the stove for 3+ hours), so I added broth and wine to thin it out.

This was OK. Maybe my problem was that I used canned chopped tomatoes instead of fresh, but whatever it was, I didn't find this blend of flavors appealing.

This dish benefits from the simplicity of all skillet dishes.  I've always enjoyed the taste of wine and chicken cooked together as it is a very savvy flavor.

Since I abhor the texture of mushrooms but enjoy their flavor, I pureed the mushrooms.  The mushroom flavor was greater than I would have expected from chopped mushrooms, so I recommend the use of this technique even for people who like mushrooms.

This was okay, it didn't have much flavor, even though I added red pepper flakes.  I think keeping the bacon in withe the liquid made it soggy and flavorless, next time I would sprinkle it on top of each serving while it's crispy.  I think this recipe has a lot of potential to be great.

This recipe was just ok.  I found this recipe too tomato - y and acidic.  I could have just as easilt opened a can of tomato sauce and pour it over chicken.  Mom's Chicken Cacciatore by Jana is much better.

Great combination of flavours in this recipe! The only thing I did differently was add a can of chicken broth with the wine. Lots of sauce that was great with egg noodles. Next time though, I think I'll make it 1/2 cup wine, and 1/2 cup broth. Thanks!

This made me think of an Italian style Coq au Vin (perhaps because I used red wine). I served it with pasta and it was to die for! I did make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: chicken legs with the skin removed, a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, red wine instead of white, rosemary instead of basil. In addition, I added pepper and thickened the sauce a bit at the end. I froze the left overs, and they were just as delicious later.

Really good! I added garlic per prior reviewers' suggestions. I used dried (rehydrated) shitake mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh. Added 1 can of stewed tomatoes, chopped, because I only had a few fresh tomatoes on hand. Thickened sauce with a roux and served over rotini pasta. Great flavor!!

We didn't have any bacon on hand, so I did without.  No fresh basil, but we had dried. We didn't have a whole chicken, so I used chicken breasts cut into strips.  I did have 8 oz fresh baby bella mushrooms on hand.  They were perfect for this.  It was quite a hit.

This came out AWESOME. I did change a couple things for time sake, I used pre-cooked bacon and used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies, gave it a nice kick.  I also added a cup of spaghetti sauce to thicken it a bit.

We added a clove of garlic, crushed tomatoes left over from another recipe (instead of diced tomatoes), 3 mammoth chicken breasts (about 2lbs) instead of a whole chicken, and (accidentally) a dessert white wine.  The recipe was delicious, but the dessert white was a mistake. Also, the chicken came out a little overdone, I suspect marinading it overnight and making sure it's *just* white all the way around will make a big difference. Next time, I think we will add more garlic, use proper white wine, marinade the chicken and use fresh tomatoes. This was delicious, and I will certainly make it again.

Used 3 large chicken breasts, cut each into ~4 pieces.  Chicken was a little tougher than I would've liked at the end of cooking, but flavorful.  Served with rice, as the sauce is very thin.

Well, we liked this recipe.  WE SKINNED OUR CHICKEN PIECES, then browned in oil with infused garlic, we also used rotel diced tomatos.  It turned out great, thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe, but I used crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce. Added more seasonings to the sauce and seasoned each piece of chicken prior to browning. I let this simmer for quite awhile to really bring out the flavors. I didn't see the need to brown the chicken in the evoo as the chicken skin gave off enough oil on its own. A nice hearty dish for a chilly night. Thanks a lot Diane!!

This was bland. I seasoned, remembering that bacon is salty, it didn't help. I will try again and consider adding capers or a hot sauce or something for a little zest. A good base, just needs something to spruce it up.

Unfortunately, I found that this was only fair at best.  Too big of a recipe for a skillet.  The flavors were a bit overwhelming - too much going on.  Would not make again.

Really good--I added minced garlic and used 2/3 c. chicken stock and 1/2 c. wine.  Turned out pretty good.  I might omit the bacon next time, though.

VERY GOOD, thanks Diane! I made a few adjustments, though. First, I went with some leftover pea pods in lieu of mushrooms (added a little color too). Then, I included plenty of garlic as it wasn't included in the recipe. Finally, I added some yellow peppers that I had. It was incredible. My mother and father-in law loved it.....and you know how that goes (acceptance)hehe.....Anyways, thanks again Diane!

This was so yummy!  Very hearty and full of flavor! I made roasted potatoes, asparagus, and rice with this and it was delicious!  Took the advice of adding some tomato paste.  Perfect!  Thank you!

This was DELICIOUS! We did a slow cooker chicken cacciatori recipe a few weeks ago, and that came nowhere close to how good this was! I used boneless chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand. Had about 2.5 pounds, sliced up. Added in a ton of freshly minced garlic, because it never hurts to have more =) Served over a penne and rigatoni pasta mix. Topped w/ a tad bit of Parmesan cheese. This is definitely a keeper!

OK taste but nothing to write home about. Flavor is standard for this type of dish. More garlic could improve it as well as maybe a marinade in the wine before hand. Over all an OK dish, not something I will make again soon.

my family loved it! i rarely have fresh herbs around but it was still very flavorful using dried. i usually use chardonnay for the white wine that recipes call for. it worked well in here.
