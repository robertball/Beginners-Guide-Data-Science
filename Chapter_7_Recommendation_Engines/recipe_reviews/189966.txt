This was delicious.  I added some zuchinni to the onion and red pepper.  I also used good cheddar instead of blue cheese.  Will serve this again.

I used red onion, bell pepper and asparagus. I reduced the balsemic with the veggies while I broiled the fish, then added the veggies and cheese and broiled until the cheese was melted.  Everyone LOVED this.  I did use sharp cheddar for husband and kids because they don't like blue cheese.  They still loved it.  I had to use soy cheese for mine and it was still awesome, so this is very adaptable.

Delish!  Fantastic tilapia recipe!  I ended up broiling it on low for a few minutes at the end.  Also, I served with rice instead of the greens.  Thanks!

I finally found a recipe that would make tilapia (or any fish fillet) more interesting! I modified the recipe by adding a bit of blackened seasoning to the fish. I placed the fish in baking dish lined with slightly greased al foil. Instead of blue cheese, I used chedder which I think it's a mistake as the flavor was not strong enough. Next time will use blue cheese or feta cheese. Also, I will add 1/2 more tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the onion and red pepper although I think for most people, 2 tablespoon should be enough. I baked the fish at 400 for 15 minutes and for the first time, I received compliments from husband on tilapia!

Good stuff.  Had to make sub the blue cheese w/ feta since I think blue cheese is one of the worst tasting substances on the planet.  Cook time is approximately 20 minutes.  I might try a little shorter time next time.

I must admit that in my opinion tilapia is not the most exciting fish to work with - but this recipe makes it something extraordinary. I used feta cheese instead of blue, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious results.

Really delicious!  Followed the recipe almost exactly, just did a half red pepper and a half yellow pepper.  Only thing I left out was the cheese because I didn't have any.  It was great without it, but I'm sure it'd be even better with the blue cheese. Will definitely make again.

This was quite different and very good. I also tried it with Parmesan and it was even tastier.

While I am not a fan of fish, I made this for my friends with positive feedback and recipe requests.  I was worried about making fish because of my inexperience in cooking fish.  Following this exact recipe made for very happy guests; guests who even believed I was skilled in cooking fish. Thanks for the easy and successful recipe.

This was gourmet tasting and looking!  My husband liked it just the way it was written out.  I added Raspberry walnut vinaigrette to mine to give it some sweet.  Maybe just some cranberries would have done the trick too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm generally not a big fish eatter in general, but my fiance and myself bought some tilapia fillets on a whim and decided to try them out.  And thus we found this recipe... and I was immensely impressed.  It was succulent, flavorful, and just completely amazing!  We had to alter the recipe slightly due to us lacking a few ingredients- we had to cut out the pepper and blue cheese- but otherwise we followed the recipe, added mushrooms and asparagus to the onion mixture, and we had ourselves some delicious tilapia.  We'll certainly be using this recipe again... and hopefully soon!

This was a great recipe!  I didn't have any blue cheese, so I didn't use it.  I thought the end result was a bit mild, so I added some lemon juice, and it was GREAT! I wish I had had that cheese, though.  I think it would've given it a much richer flavor.

wow. this recipe was awesome and super easy.  I didn't take anything out for dinner but I had frozen tilapia in the freezer to easily thaw.  This recipe was perfect. Easy, healthy and delicious!

This was edible, but that's about all I can say for it.  I thought it sounded odd, but figured it had so many great reviews that I'd give it a try.  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  I didn't change anything.  Maybe it's just my tastes, but my girls and I did not enjoy this meal.  My husband said that it was decent, but he wasn't thrilled with it.  I will not be making this again.

This recipe is awesome!  It is so easy, tasty, and healthy.  I did substitute feta for the blu cheese because of personal preference.  Will definitely make again and again!

Absolutely delicious! I used a little more balsamic vinegar and added chopped garlic. I also substituted the tilapia for Salmon. Great recipe!

Wonderful Wonderful. The lightness of the tilapia, the boldness of the balsamic vinegar and the crisp of the salad greens made a delightful dinner. Like any good cook, you adjust your spices and flavors to your families tastes. I added more balsamic vinegar. Thank You for Sharing. A Keeper.......

Super tasty and easy.   I used a couple of tilapia filets from Costco. I sauted the onions and peppers, and added a clove of crushed, fresh garlic for just a minute before adding the balsamic vinegar.  I also topped with feta cheese instead of blue cheese.   There wasn't much sauce once I pulled the dish out of the oven, so I drizzled a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the greens before topping with the tilapia filets. Big hit! Will make again.

Loved this recipe! Can't wait to make it again! Did not cook it for 30 minutes as the recipe said. Cooked it for 20 minutes. Wonder how it would do add garlic next time? I didn't think it needed it but my guy did. This is a keeper!

I made this dish last night with a few variations and it turned out excellent!  I used sharp cheddar instead of the blue cheese and eliminated the peppers all together. (I am not a big pepper fan).  I found that cooking the tilapia for about 15mins at 350 degrees worked out best.  I served this dish over mixed greens with a side of homemade garlic bread. Delish! (Check out the pic above from Lauralu!)

I'm giving this 5 stars because not only is it delicious, it is easy to prepare, and relatively quick. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting feta cheese for the blue cheese, which tasted great! My two kids even loved this recipe. The hardest part is slicing the onions. It was flavorful and delicious, and my husband urged me to make it again, soon, so that's a great recommendation. All in all a truly great recipe.

This is one our staple fish meals. My husband dislikes plain fish so this one meets all the touch points of a great meal, good for you with great flavor. I use any  color of peppers available and have used both feta and blue cheese. Great dish!

This recipe is delicious!  I subbed Parmesan cheese for the blue cheese and served it with Farro, our new favorite grain...much more satisfying than rice.  The fish was simple but elegant.

This recipe was delicous and is definitely a keeper.  Don't be afraid of the cheese!!  I cooked at 375 for about 15 min, also added zuchinni to the veggies.  I would guess whatever fresh veggies you have to saute would work equally as well... (asparagus, julienned carrots, etc.).  I served over greens as recipe suggests; however I bet rice would be great too as others have mentioned.  Will definitely make again!  Served with a grilled peach with balsamic glaze - what a yummy end to this dish!

This was a good idea, but in the end the tilapia just tasted like fish :P The sauce just didn't stick to the fish enough and the cheese (I used feta) didn't add much to the dish.

I decided to risk making something new for my out-of-town guests, and not a speck of it was left! I used flounder instead and added baby asparagus tips to the onion/pepper mixture. I didn't serve it with the greens but instead other kid friendly veggies. The blue cheese and balsamic combo was a nice change of pace.

A few adjustments: little to no blue cheese, extra balsamic and saute the peppers and onions more than you think you need to. My boyfriend made these adjustments and I almost didnt recognize the recipe

this is a total winner, I did mess with the recipe a bit. Since I read the former reviews, I also opted for red onions and I used Feta Cheese instead of blue cheese.  Also I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic and instead of salad I used a bed of rice. My family loved it and it was easy and quick to make. This is a keeper.

Very tasty. We used a green bell pepper instead of red, and added a seeded and chopped jalapeno pepper for a spicy kick. We also replaced the blue cheese (ick) with shredded cheddar and only used 1/2 cup. This is a keeper.

This was delicious! Kids and hubby both asked when I was making this again. Subbed Feta for bleu cheese because that was hat I had on hand. Served it over baby greens, which added another layer of taste and texture and made for a colorful presentation. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a keeper. I didn't have blue cheese, so I used goat cheese and it was wonderful! I think blue cheese or feta cheese would go super as well.I served it along side of salad, quinoa with roasted veggies, and rosemary bread. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great dish.  Even better the second. I don't like blue cheese but in recipe it was good.  Baking the cheese I feel changed its flavor.  Anyone that substituted should really give it  a try, I'm glad it did.

This was perfect for my husband's low carb diet he has been on.  I didn't have blue cheese so I used feta.  The combination of balsamic vinegar with the cheese and mixed greens really makes for a nice tilapia salad.

OMG...this was delish!!!  My husband, who does not think I can "cook", was unbelievably shocked at how excellent this tasted!  The only thing I did different (by accident) was cook the onions and peppers in the balsamic vinegar.  Otherwise, the same, it was delicious!  Of course, my 6 year old was not quite as discriminating...he didn't like it.  He favored a hot dog....

Sigh! I was only trying to use up some fish and searching for recipes I might like. This was only ok. Husband and kid thought it was alright, but did not want to have it again. I am so not a fish person and I could not barely stand to eat more than 3 bites. If you like fish and blue cheese, go for it!

All I can say is that I was not a fish lover AT ALL...As a matter of fact, I was a hater. This dish converted me by giving me a very light fish, with a very light sauce and the crisp of veges. YUM! YUM! YUM!

This was great!  We eat fish at least twice a week and I was looking for something new.  Have 4 kids (2 are picky eaters) and they all loved this. Great recipe. Served with parmesan noodles and peas for kids.

Very good. Tilapia can be a pretty blah fish, but the balsamic added a great flavor. I didn't have blue cheese so I substituted goat cheese which tasted great and added some yellow pepper since I had it on hand and it added a nice color. Served with jasmine rice.

I am not usually a fan of fish with any kind of cheese let alone one with such a strong flavor profile.  This, however, was outstanding and easy!  You know it has to be good when even a super picky three year old gobbles it up onions and all!

This ended up being really good and will be one of my weeknight staple recipes for cooking fish!  We eat fish a lot and often bake it to make it lower fat.  I didn't have blue cheese but used feta and then instead of using just plain balsamic vinegar, used bottled fat free balsamic salad dressing instead--came out really good!

This is a really good dish...as my husband said, "worthy of any fancy restaurant".   I didn't have blue cheese and just used cheddar, and it was amazing.  Can only imagine how much better it will be with blue!

Wow! We added 1 clove of chopped garlic to the saute pan in step one but otherwise made the recipe as is. Because it was so wonderful, we had it as an entree in which case the recipe serves 2. The next time we make this, we will double the onion, pepper, and balsamic vinegar to make more of a sauce/dressing for the greens. Thank you Mr. Wohler, this is divine!

Ok so I thought if I had to cook the onions, etc on the stove, I would just fix the fish on the stove.  This was working out pretty well.  I also added a can of summer squash that I had been wanting to use up.  I hadnt planned on using the blue cheese since hubby doesnt like it, then I decided to use an Italian mix.  Then I thought it looked like it really could use a bit of color and texture that the broiler could produce.  So once I hit it with a little broiler time, it resulted in a really nice looking dish.  But that meant I had to dirty up another dish afterall.  Thank you for sharing.  I will be making this again.

I chose this recipe from all the Tilapia recipes because of the ingredients, prep time, etc; then I read all the raving reviews; I was excited all day to make dinner!!!  And it was worth the wait!  Fantastic!!  My husband also liked it very much - but I could have used half the blue cheese for his taste!  GREAT MEAL!!!!  Thanks!

Excellent!  This recipe is easy, quick, delicious, and the cleanup is a breeze.  We didn't have any blue cheese, so we omitted it without any problem. The only thing I added was to squeeze half a lemon on the tilapia filets - because I can't seem to get away from not using lemon with any fish I make. :)  I served with sweet potato baked fries (steak cut) and a cabbage salad.  Thanks for sharing - this is going straight into my recipe binder.

Looking for a last minute meal, I found this fabulous dish.  Used a red onion that I had on hand instead of yellow, and only had 1/2 of one.  Used an orange bell pepper which worked just as well as a red would have.  Had gorgonzola on hand instead of blue cheese.  Put the whole mixture on top of the fish and baked at 400 for 15 mins. which was just perfect.  Yum!  It was great!  My husband is very picky, so I completely altered his by sprinkling garlic powder over his filet, then onion flakes (he hates onions, but this gives him the flavor) and then covered with a cheddar cheese blend.  His was ok... but mine & the kids was fabulous!  Thanks for an easy, quick and HEALTHY meal!  Oh, served over romaine lettuce.

This is wonderful! I had to change only a slight few things as I didn;t have everything on hand. I used zucchini instead of pepper and gorgonzola (Italian Blue Cheese). I also 'baked' it in our bbq on bricks. We all thought it was outstanding and I WILL DEFINITELY be using this recipe over and over again!

Very good.  Omitted cheese, added fresh garlic.  Recommend using a more concentrated, aged balsamic for more flavor.  Cheese not necessary but would be a nice touch.  I didn't have the appropriate type.

This is a delicious recipe! I tweaked the recipe very slightly, though; I used less blue cheese & olive oil to lessen the fat content. I broiled the fish for the last few minutes, too. I will try it with feta cheese next time.

Seriously delicious.  I used halved cherry tomatoes (in lieu of the red bell pepper).  I highly recommend this substitution.  The tomatoes roast in the oven and are a fabulous / sweet compliment to the blue cheese.  I also used a light champagne vinegrette to dress the greens.  Sooo good.

Thanks for helping me find a new delicious way to serve fish.   I used an italian cheese blend because I'm not a fan of blue cheese, and an italian seasoned salt instead of plain S&P.  Love the suggestion someone had of adding zucchini to the pepper/onion topping, which is absolutely fantastic and could go with just about anything IMO!

I made this a few weeks ago and it was DELICIOUS!! Guess what??? I'm making it again tonight. I am going to try Feta cheese this time as others have suggested but my husband and I still loved it with Blue Cheese. Also, adding a few other veggies to the mix and will serve with rice and garlic bread. Thanks so much for sharing this :-)

The blue cheese seemed to almost take away from the flavors of the fish.  I'd recommend using less, if any, if you want to taste the fish.

This was very tasty! I used more balsamic than it called for and didn't measure my onions and peppers. I also didn't use the bleu cheese or salad greens. But the combo of those sauteed veggies and the vinegar is scrumptious! I am not a big fish fan, but know it is good for me. So I was very pleased to find a recipe that made the fish yummy!!

Easy dish.  I used a red onion and added asparagus.  Instead of blue cheeze, I used gorgonzola, which has a smoother flavor.  When plating the dish, I put the full stems of asparagus on top and drizzled Dellalo Balsamic Glaze over the dish.  Not only did it look great, but it was tasty!

I was surprised how great this turned out because it sounded so simple -- and it really was easy to prepare AND clean up!  The ingredients are easily on hand and this will probably become a regular in our tilapia recipe rotation.  We served it over white riceinstead of salad greens,  which was a nice side.

This easy dish got RAVE reviews at my house tonight. I served it with grilled asparagus and herbed cous cous. I didn't have enough bleu cheese so I added a bit of feta. I will make again.

This recipe is good enough to make a tilapia hater ask for seconds. I added 2 jalapenos for some kick and substituted feta for the blue cheese. I served with corn tortillas for my husband and he raved about them big time. Thanks for a great recipe!

My new favorite recipe for tilapia!  I added zucchini and garlic to the pepper and onion mixture, and I used a little more than the 2T of balsamic vinegar.  I also omitted the cheese and baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  I might try broiling it for a few minutes next time, as per some of the other comments.

Love this recipe!  I didn't have blue cheese so I substituted parmesan cheese and it turned out so delicious.  I also added a little minced garlic with the onions and bell peppers, as well as a teaspoon of sugar to caramelize the balsamic vinegar.  Very tasty!  This will make it to our weekly meal rotation for sure!

This was simply amazing! I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for something to do with tilapia I had on hand and now our family has a new favorite fish dish! Tastes like something you would be served in an excellent restaurant. I only had about 1/4 cup of blue cheese, so can't wait to try it with the amount called for, although I think a whole cup might be a bit much. Also, I sprinkled kosher salt and a tiny bit of garlic pepper on the fish before topping with the peppers and cheese.

Loved this recipe! Peppers taste great with the tilapia. Made with sharp cheddar cheese because that was what I had. Used the Kroger frozen peppers and onion mixture for a speedy supper with frozen tilapia. Added some Mrs. Dash-not sure which variety- in addition to the salt and pepper. Will serve this to company in the future!

Easy, healthy, delicious.  I chose to put this over a bed of spinach and added quinoa as the side.  My wife snapped a photo of it plated because of how gourmet it looked (and tasted).

This was awesome. I didn't have red pepper so I used just the onion, and I cut the blue cheese in half. It was amazing!

This was so yummy.  I added some chopped zucchini in as well and the  dish was so good!  Never thought those things would go together so well!

My husband and I loved this dish! It can be hard to find ways to make fish more flavorful and this recipe did just that!  I subbed apple cider vinegar and mozzarella cheese the first time I made it, because that is what I had on hand.  It was still very yummy, but not as good as the original recipe!

I wasn't certain of the cook time.  For me 25 minutes was perfect.  I checked it at 20 and I wasn't certain it was enough.  I didn't make any other changes.  The family and I really enjoyed it.

Wow, this was delicious. Very flavorful. I used virgin coconut oil with veggies instead of olive oil, a tad more balsamic, and goat cheese instead of blue cheese (because I didn't have blue cheese). Simple, quick and extremely tasty.

We didn't use cheese, in an effort to make it healthier.  It really needed the cheese.  The flavors were okay, but it seemed like it was missing something.

My boyfriend wanted to eat tilapia a different way and we found this recipe. The balsamic was a turn off while it was cooking but it tunrned out really tatsty. We ate it for dinner with rice and for lunch on a salad- soooo good!

LOVED this recipe and so did my family - I did not rub down filets with olive oil and it was fine - no need for the extra fat.  Added garlic too.

really enjoyed the flavor of this.  we changed the proportions a little to have more veggies - used 2 peppers and 2 onions w/ ~3Tbsp balsamic.  seasoned the tilapia with garlic powder as well and followed others' suggestions of broiling fish alone for 5min on low, flipping and adding the balsamic mixture and feta and broiling another 4-5min.

Although this is an excellent base recipe I thought it would be a bit bland so I changed it a little.  I added a TBS of garlic to the veges.  I also seasoned the fish w/ Old Bay instead of salt and pepper and broiled one side for 5 mins on low then flipped them and added the veges and blue cheese and broiled them another 4 mins until cheese was melted and fish flaked.  Then I served on rice with a side salad.  5 stars with the changes but 4 as it is written.

Surprisingly amazing!  I added zucchini and served it over Rotelle pasta for my husband and he loved it. I ate mine over a bed of spinach and grated carrot and I loved it. I substituted  pepper jack cheese cut into small cubes for the blue cheese and it worked nicely by giving it a little extra spice. I baked it for 15 mins at 400 degrees F. We'll be eating this again. :)

I LOVE the veggie mix on this.  I used red onion and green pepper.  I also used Feta instead of blue cheese.  I am not a fish fan, but need to eat healthier so I thought I would try some Tilapia.  I needed a piece of feta in every bite to cover up the fish flavor.  I also served with rice instead of greens.  If you like fish, this is a good recipe!!!

This was soooo good.  Trying to watch my calorie intake so I cut down on the olive oil and blue cheese by about half and it was still delicious.  I had it over arugala.  I will make this over and over.  Thanks.

This was very good, I used feta instead of blue cheese and I used arugula for the greens to give more of a balance of sweet and bitter. I baked the fish about 17 minutes. Thanks!

I would give this dish 4.5 stars if I could, it is definately tasty and repeatable, but fishy, so I would not serve this to anyone who was iffy about fish. My Husband liked it very much and had several helpings and wants me to make it again. I like I did not have red peppers in the house, so I substituted sundried tomatoes which worked well. The blue cheese is what makes the dish: the flavors blend well together. I would consider taking this idea and replacing the blue cheese with another strong flavor such as capers or dry cured black olives.

Was delicious, didn't have bleu cheese so I used fancy shredded cojack.  Was delicious!  I'll definitely make this again.  I wish you could give some ballpark estimate of cooking time-I hardly ever cooked fish and I had to wing it.  20 minutes

Found this recipe after I bought talipia for the first time. Used what I had on hand which was yellow and orange bells, a mixture of half blue cheese, half brie with herbs & then I read the reviewers who suggested feta which I also had - oh well!. Used a little more balsamic thinking it would be great over the salad greens & it was. My husband really liked it. Next time I'll use only blue or only feta cheese.

This was great! I rarely measure ingredients exactly so I can’t say this recipe is great as is. I loved the basalmic flavor on the veggies! I only made one cod filet and baked it for ten minutes. I used parmesan cuz that was the only kind of cheese I had.

Good way to jazz up a normally pretty bland fish.  I added some cherry tomatoes to the onion and bell pepper. Was a little generous with the balsamic. Added feta after it came out of oven. Nice change of pace . . .

Great recipe! Not a blue cheese fan so left it out completely, used melted butter with sautéed garlic over the fish instead of oil and I added thin carrots as well. We really enjoyed this.

I made the recipe as written and found it really jazzed up the tilapia.  A very tasty way to get more fish into the diet.

This was delicious, will definitely make again.  Before baking, I sprinkled the fish with Sazon Tropical, and added a little balsamic salad dressing in the bottom of the pan.  I used two  shallots in place of the onion, and added a little chopped jalapeno.  I added red pepper flakes to the oil.  I omitted the cheese (as my daughter doesn't eat cheese), and baked for 18 minutes at 375.  The fish was flavorful and not dry.  Served over yellow rice - thanks for sharing!

I made this with cod (cause I can't tell the difference anyway) and pepper jack cheese slices rather than bleu cheese sprinkles. I used a whole onion and half a bag of frozen bell peppers. Followed all the instructions (except I only had small foil bread/cake pans) so I put the fish in, then 2 slices of cheese, then the onions/peppers. Covered with tinfoil and baked for 17 minutes. It was pretty good.

Made this without the blue cheese and it was still delish! The balsamic vinegar gave it a little sweetness, and the onions went a a little caramelized.

Very good! I used a lite balsamic vinegar dressing drizzled over fillets arranged in baking dish. I didn't measure, approximately 1/4 c. Then I cut my fresh vegetables, yellow and zucchini squash, orange and yellow sweet peppers; Sautéd in olive oil and arranged on top of fish, then sprinkled with fresh chopped green onions and sparsely drizzled with blue cheese dressing; all because that's what I had on hand. I served this with buttered egg noodles, although I wanted to prepare rice but didn't have enough. Will definitely make it again but will use more balsamic dressing so we have more sauce to drizzle over noodles which turned out to be a good compliment.

We tried this tonight using tangerine Balsamic vinegar, served it over brown rice with sauteed asparagus, and found it delicious. I will make this again, but will increase the Balsamic to three tablespoons and will add some minced garlic.

very tasty and a touch gourmet! like most people on here, i didnt have any blue cheese so i substituted it with Feta cheese. i also added blackening seasoning to the tilapia for a little extra flavor. the directions dont mention the amount of time to bake the Tilapia so i just put it in for 20min at 350 degrees and it was perfect. i plated the fish on top of green beans tossed with basil garlic butter sauce. (instead of basil i would have rather used fresh chopped cilantro but didnt have any) The two dishes married together very well and was all around delicious and healthy!

This dish is absolutely fantastic. I used strips of yellow and red pepper and onion. I keep fresh frozen tilapia in the freezer as well as prepared onion and pepper strips. This dish comes together very quickly with the frozen peppers and onions. An excellent, low calorie dish on the table from freezer in less than 30 minutes. Healthy, fast and low calorie, this can't be beat!!!!

Wow!  Great tasting recipe that I had some initial doubts about.  Blue cheese and fish??? Yes, it works especially as a foil to the sweet peppers and the onion, not to mention the pairing with the balsamic vinegar. One addition I made was to sautee some sliced mushrooms after the onions and peppers cooked down a bit.  I did not add a full cup of blue cheese as I thought it would be too much.  Instead, I added about a scant quarter cup.  I served it over buttered orzo with pecorino romano, salt and pepper.  Husband thought it was company-worthy and a great dish that he raved about four separate times! Can't wait to make again over the mixed greens.

I added 1 Zucchini and a handful of broccoli. The fish was too bland-possibly because I didn't let the balsamic juices soak into the fish long enough before baking.

This is a great recipe- and I would imagine from my one experience very versatile.  I added mushrooms and garlic to the veggie mixture and baked it about 15 minutes at 350, topping with freshly grated parmesan.  Tilapia can be pretty boring- but this was fresh and tasty. It's a keeper.

Awesome. I followed the recipe exactly but used red, green, yellow and orange bell peppers with the onion, then Parmesan cheese because that's what I had. Baked for 15 minutes and turned out fabulous. Served with leftover mashed potatoes... YUM :)

Made this for dinner on Sunday for a big group. I know it was a hit because my brother, who is a gourmet cook even asked for the recipe.  I did as a few others suggested and swapped feta for the blue cheese.  Instead of just salt & pepper, I sprinkled lightly with Old Bay seafood seasoning but want to try a blackened or creole spice next.  I also did a balsamic reduction with about 1/2 c. vinegar. When the fish is finished from the oven and plated atop the greens - drizzle the thickened vinegar lightly over the top of fish and pepper/onion mixture. Looks and tastes wonderful!

Pretty much followed the recipe, only difference was I added some yellow squash to the onion & red pepper and served over rice.  It was DELICIOUS.  My hubby and 5-year-old son cleaned their plates.  Hubby actually said... "That was totally gnarly!"... HaHaHa! I'd say that's a stamp of approval...  Will definitely be making this again.

This received two thumbs up from everyone is our house. Used feta instead of blue cheese and added minced garlic to the veggies. Served over slightly wilted fresh spinach. Definite keeper.

I used feta instead of blue cheese (my boys don't like it, unfortunately) and it turned out very well.

Fabulous !! Stumbled upon this recipe and happy I did. Have made it a few times since. Left the cheese out, still great. I added baby portabella mushrooms last time.(very good). takes only a few minutes to put together and bake.

This was very easy to make and was super yummy. I impressed my guests with this one! I made half of the filets with the blue cheese and the other half without it, and although they were both excellent, the blue cheese just added a perfect pitch to the overall taste. I highly recommend this recipe.

Loved this! Made if with my Mom it looked and tasted like a gourmet meal. It was quick and easy. Cheese is not in my diet so we did not include the crumble blue cheese, it was excellent just the same.

I just made it for dinner and it was a GREAT dish. One adjustment: when I coated the fish with Olive Oil, i rubbed some curry powder to it for color purpose! Otherwise, it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

This was so simple and SO good! I followed the recipe  except I served with "Sarah's Rice Pilaf" (a recipe I found here at allrecipes.com) instead of salad greens. So tasty!

I had some tilapia in the freezer and didn't know what to do with it.  This was the first recipe I came across. I didn't have blue cheese nor salad greens so I served it with brown rice and sauteed spinach.  I had it on the table in less than an hour!  There are so many ways you can play with it, too!!!  This is perfect for a working Mom!!!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!!!  :)

This recipe was wonderful!  I used fresh grouper and chopped up an eggplant along with the peppers and onions.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic.  Everyone raved about how wonderful this was!  A keeper for sure.

This is fast, easy and pretty enough for company!  I forgot to buy red peppers and substituted chopped roma tomatoes.  I put the tomatoes in the balsamic vinegar while I cooked the onions and then combined them to put over the fish.  It was good too!

This dish has taken fish to a new level.  Rave Reviews!  Very tasty and easy to make.  While my 3 boys were a bit optimistic my husband said it was the best meal ever.  The greens are a nice compliment to this dish too.

Sauce was delicious - I reduced about 4 tablespoons of balsamic before adding it to the veggies at the end of their saute.  This was good with tilapia, but next time I'm going to try it with steak

Excellent combination of flavors with the sweet onions, the tart balsamic and the sharp blue cheese.  Love this recipe and so does my wife who is now a fish eater!
