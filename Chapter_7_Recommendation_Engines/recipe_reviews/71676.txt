this is such a good recipe. i used black beans instead of kidney, and my grocery store didn't have cayenne peppers so i used extra jalapeno. i also added chicken. another change i made was using jamaican jerk low-fat potato crisps from archer's farm instead of tortillas -- the chips have a light onion and garlic flavor goes really good with the dish.

This is a fantastic soup!! It makes a bunch and the leftovers get better and better! My boyfriend frowned at the idea of no meat so I made a quick rub for two chicken breasts and placed them on the George Foreman Grill while I was chopping up the veggies for the soup. I shredded the chicken as I read in some of the reviews and it was great. YUMMY!

This recipe is yummy!  I added chicken and used half pinto beans.  Also, cutting the tortillas before baking them made them very nice and crispy.  This one is defintely going in the book of favourites!

This was just the type of recipe I was looking forward to, quick, easy, and very tasty.  I made a few changes that worked well, 1 can of seasoned black beans instead of two kidney, cut the tortillas before baking ( watch it closely), and I used left over chicken. I'm making it a second time.  Yummy!

It isn't bad but doesn't have a lot of character. My wife and I agreed it is just so so.
