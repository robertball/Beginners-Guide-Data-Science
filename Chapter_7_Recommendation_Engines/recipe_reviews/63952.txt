Superb!! is all that I can say about this.  I added about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and about 1 tablespoon of cinnamon to this basic recipe and WOW!  The cinnamon is not overpowering but makes you think, HMMM! What is that?  Again, SUPER, SUPERB!!!  I will definetly keep this recipe on hand!

I made it with the refridgerator/freezer method because I don't have an ice cream maker.  It has great consistency, similar to store bought ice cream.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  With using the sweet & condensed milk, there is no graininess of undissolved sugar.  You can easily substitute the ingredients to make a less fat variety - which is what I did when making the first time.  I substituted whole milk for the 2 cups whipping cream to cut back on the fat, and it was still very flavorful!

This is a great recipe for ice cream football, a favorite family activity.  First, half the recipe.  Then put all the ingredients in a quart size ziploc bag (only half recipe will fit).  Double bag it so it stays secure.  Then fill a gallon size ziploc with ice and salt, nesting the bag of ice cream ingredients in the middle of all the ice.  Double bag the gallon bag so it stays secure.  Then wrap the whole package in several layers of newspaper and packing tape.  Take it outside and play a game of football or keep away or just toss it around for an hour.  When you unwrap the whole thing, you will have easy ice cream!

I made this several times using the freezer method and it was creamy and wonderful. The only thing I changed is I only used 1 tablespoon of vanilla. We have added chopped fruit to it and poured it in a chocolate graham cracker crust to make Ice Cream pie. Great!

I love this recipe!  So incredibly easy, so I was thinking it can't be that good.  But it is!  I love how it doesn't require eggs or cooking.  Just dump everything into a bowl, stir, and put it in your ice cream maker.  The flavor is so rich and delicious.  Upon first bite my husband proclaimed "We're never buying store-bought ice cream again!"  Next I want to try using whole milk instead of half and half, and adding fruits or other goodies.

I made it with the freezer method.  Taste is 10 stars but yhe directions weren't real clear so I gave it a 3. To Fold in the whipping cream means 2 cups whipping cream, whipped, which the directions aren't real clear about that..  I ended up pouring the mixture into my blender and whipping it until it was fluffier.  It was delicious.  I added 1/4 cup instant coffee and a 1/4 cup dark cocoa powder.  It was mocha ice cream.

Great recipe.  Quick, easy, and tastes great!  I followed the advice in one review and used whole milk instead of half and half.  I also added a mango puree mixture (fresh ripe mangoes with sugar) to the mixture after it started to freeze in the churner.  Yummy to the max!

Way to easy for something so absolutely delicious.  Company raved on the richness.   Next time I'll try some fruit mixed in.  This will be the only ice cream recipe I'll ever use and I'll just doctor it to the flavor that I want.  If I could give this higher than 5 stars I would.

This is a great quick and easy way to make Ice Cream.  I'm pregnant and trying to avoid the egg base recipies.  This was a great alternate.  I did add the flavored 1/2 & 1/2. Next time I will only use 1 c flavored and 1 c plain.  It was almost too sweet.  My husband was surprised that there was no sugar added.

Not bad. Not actually good either. It would be better if it had more fat in it, and that's the honest truth. Nothing wrong with the flavor, if you want more vanilla, add more vanilla. Taste the mixture before you freeze it to make sure it tastes vanilla enough. Really if you want to use this recipe and you want it to be creamy, use 2 cups half&half and 2 cups heavy cream or whipping cream (not whipped cream, not Cool Whip!) rather than 4 of half&half, it'll improve the texture. This ice cream is best enjoyed the day it's made -- after that it gets crystallized. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the easiest ice cream recipe I have tried. It's fast, uses only 3 ingredients and it's delicious. I really like how versatil it is. I've made coconut ice cream by blending a teaspoon of coconut flavoring and 1 cup of flaked coconut with the half and half in the blender for a few seconds, then proceeding as directed. I've also made cinnamon ice cream by adding cinnamon. I've added pineapple and macadamia nuts to the coconut as well to make a great caribbean treat! Next on my list will be mango, followed by egg nog ice cream by adding nutmeg, rum flavoring and cinnamon. This one is a true winner!

I was a bit disappointed by this easy recipe. I followed it exactly, but once frozen, the consistency was like ice milk not ice cream. It immediately melted in my mouth like milk. I'm all for easy, but not after I had another recipe that had 1 extra step but was oh so creamy and delicious. I used 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of 2% milk and beat it until the sugar was dissolved. Then I added just under a tablespoon of vanilla and 3 cups of heavy whipping cream and poured it in the ice cream maker. I put it in the freezer for a bit before serving. It was so incredibly creamy that my husband told me it was the best he's ever had. You get what you pay for....you want ice cream...use heavy cream. You can always add candy/cookies/fruit on the last 5 minutes. It's very versatile.

Initial flavor and texture was really good.  After freezing it, both the flavor and texture was undesirable for ice cream.  It was more like Ice Milk.

My daughter can't have sugar or milk (but she can have cream), so I substituted whipping cream for the half-and-half, and 1 cup of honey plus 1/8 tsp of salt for the Sweetened Condensed milk.  It turned out awesome!  I will definitely make it again, using a little less honey, and perhaps a few different flavor options.

Best and easiest recipe for ice cream.  This is good enough to be an all-purpose work around.  You want chocolate ice cream?  Just make this and add chocolate syrup. You want raspberry ice cream? Just add the berries here.  It really is an amazing!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! I was so surprised that you only need a few ingredients. BUT IT TURNED OUT SO GREAT!! I replaced vanilla extract with vanilla imitation, cause 2 tbsp of vanilla extract may be too strong. It came out great! Tasted just like the Breyers brand ice cream. I don't have an ice cream maker, but, what I did was first put the mixture in the fridge for half an hour, then I put it in the freezer and took out every half an hour. I scraped the edges and mixed it. I repeated this every half hour till it got its good frozen texture. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!

AWESOME recipe! My husband kept fussing at me saying that I couldn't have gotten the recipe right and I had to be missing stuff.  When it came out looking like dough, he fussed more saying I didn't get the recipe right.  When he took a bite of it, he greatly apologized and said how awesome it was.  It was just too easy.  That's the only recipe we use anymore, and it really does make enough for 12!  We had another container of it going at the same time thinking that it wouldn't be enough for our party of 14, but it made just enough, and we never touched the other container of it during the party and just froze it.   

***The BEST thing, is that it does NOT melt quickly!  Most recipes melt the instant it leaves the container, but I was able to eat ALL of my ice cream outside on a fairly warm night, and it didn't on me!   We're going to take our manual maker on our camping trip this weekend and see how it holds up to 85 degree weather.  ;)

Take away the half & half & use 1 pint of whip cream.  After whipping the cream, fold in with the condensed milk.  Very creamy. I made butter pecan by adding 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 teaspoon of maple flavor & pecans with the condensed milk.  After folding with whipped cream, I put in freezer for 6 hours.  Tasted just like butter pecan icecream.  I didn't get any of the ice crystals; maybe because I didn't use half & half.  I also made mint chocolate chips.

I've tried several different homemade ice cream recipes and this is by far the best one. I actually used only half a recipe to try it out and in my Kitchenaid stand mixer, ice cream maker attachment bowl, the mix tripled in volume. I wouldn't do the whole recipe as it wouldn't get as much air and might not be as light and creamy. I added pureed mangos as well as peaches sweetened with about 1/4 cup of splenda. I also added a tablespoon of triple sec to make sure it didn't get too hard in the freezer. It not only tastes amazing but has a smooth and creamy consistency. I am going to use this base for all sorts of different flavours.

Made exactly as indicated - strong condensed milk taste, which reminded me more of a frozen vanilla dessert vs. real ice cream.  Much prefer a custard based ice cream using an ice cream maker.  That said, in a pinch, this may be ok.  My husband and in laws thought it was fine alongside the Grandma Ople pie (which is amazing if you haven't already made it), but didn't rave about it, which is what usually happens with real homemade ice cream.

So easy and creamy delicous.  We did not wait for the ice cream freezer to stop, it had been going for over an hour.  Maybe I did not put enought salt from the git-go. Not sure, but when we did open it...  Wow, it was very good and creamy the adults didn't get much because the kids induldged.  They loved it..

I found this ice cream recipe to be very tasty.  However, I did change a few things.  Instead of using 4 cups of half/half, I used 2 cups of half/half, 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 1 cup whole milk.  I guess that's a lot of changes.

Used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 and 2 cups of whipping cream. Was so great! Tasted just like Breyers. I will use again and add something. Thanks for recipe.

I normally make a custard based ice cream and was looking for a quick recipe when I came across this one. Made it exactly as the recipe and it was GREAT!! Creamy and not too sweet. Tasted like soft serve from the local ice cream shop. Will make again.

A very easy and yummy recipe that doesn't require cooking with eggs and extra sugar. You can throw anything in with it like chopped frozen cherries and chocolate chips. I have a ice cream maker and it worked very well.

I loved that this was incredibly easy; just pour everything together. The sweetened condensed milk made it very smooth and not grainy like sugar can do. It tasted just like soft-serve ice cream you would get at McDonald's or Dairy Queen. That's not my favorite, but those in my family who love that thought this ice cream was the best! I like more of the Breyer's taste and texture that you can get with some other kinds of homemeade ice cream. I will definitely make this again, and try lower fat and add ins. The texture of this was great for that, I think. However, this recipe does not make a full ice cream maker of ice cream. Luckily, one serving was enough for me.

Yum! It really tastes like old fashioned home-made ice cream! My only hint for next time is that I will chill the mixture before I put it in my ice cream maker because it over-heated before it was completely frozen. It definitely could have been colder to start with, since the evaporated milk and vanilla were at room temp.

Used fat free creamer and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  Added an extra tablespoon of vanilla, a little cinnamon, and fresh (chopped) blueberries and raspberries.  YUM!  Awesome EASY recipe that I will continue to use throughout the summer!  Thanks!

Amazing and so easy! I like the fact that I don't have to use eggs or egg beaters. I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and 2 cups of 1% milk and it turned out perfect!

This is sooo simple and I love the flavor!  It has a nice richness and without the eggs.  With no cooking or cooling, you can have dessert in less than 30 minutes!  I added 1T of Caramel Baileys to keep it from freezing too hard.  YUM!!!

Worked perfectly in my old timey ice cream maker.  So easy and simple, I thougth it was too good to be true.  I have 6 kids and it was an instant hit!  I can't wait to use this as the base recipe for other variations.

It was very quick and easy, but came out overly sweet and a bit icy.  This wasn't worth the calories, in my opinion.

VERY easy!  I thought OMG this is gonna be too sweet or too much vanilla!  I made it and tasted throughout the process, and until it is frozen (not out of the machine, but frozen) it tasted Crazy to me.  But once I put it in the freezer and let it freeze.  WOW  Great ice cream!  Thank you for sharing this with us!  I will be using this one again!  and Didn't Change a thing about it (which is unusal)

This is delicious and really easy.  No cooking.  I mix up Eagle Brand and part of the milk in my blender before pouring into freezer.  A wonderful recipe.

While very good, this does not freeze up quickly and will need to finish off in the freezer with stirring every 30 minutes or so to keep it from settling and getting rock hard.  For that reason I rate it 4 stars.

This was pretty good. A little on the sweet side. I still think I prefer the Five Minute Ice Cream better. This one is a little like a Wendy's Frosty. I'm planning on using this to make cookie sandwiches with leftover Whole Jar of Peanut Butter Cookies.

I discovered one reason why this recipe might gets mixed reviews...I made the whipped cream version and it was amazing!  Light, fluffy, froze perfectly and totally delicious.  It was so good it prompted me to buy an ice cream maker. I have made it twice since, once with half and half the second time with cream.  Both times it came out soft and developed lots of ice crystals when frozen.  Next time I'm putting the gadgets away and sticking to the hand made version - wayyyyyy better!

Vanilla was too strong. Next time I would do just one tablespoon. Maybe it was too strong because I used real vanilla?

First time we made this we didn't have enough half and half so we used 2 cups heavy cream and 2 cups whole milk and the ice cream was very good. This is a very easy, no-cook recipe that enables you to have homemade ice cream is a fairly short amount of time.

First of all, I can't believe how incredibly easy this recipe is!  I used both fat free half/half and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  The consistency was great!  It is definitely sweet enough without any extra added sugar.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe.

Good flavor but texture was not smooth and creamy - more icy and grainy. I even used our White Mountain 6qt Ice Cream Freezer. Probably won't make this recipe again.

This was my 1st time making this,i never made hm. made ice cream b-4,my mother allways made it, but i watched, and i was really suprised to how it came out. I made the recipe to  T, someone commented that it was too eggy and had some egg reminints in the mixture, i knoticed that if your mixing it at the last, and find some egg yolk reminints, i find you can use a wisk beater, and stir real good, and it will began to be smooth, and yes if you cook it over med. heat and watch it, not to over boil, but just to the point of ready to boil, then it shouldnt get any crystals in it. After adding everything back into the pan while it was still hot, (while on the stove), i got a huge mixing bowl and poured the custard mix in it, then got a metal wisk blender and mixed it well, put that into the machines container, and set that container in the freezer for just a jiffy, i had to be somewhere fast, so i didnt have time for it  to cool dwn, so by the time i got to where i was going, pluged it in, and in about an hr. it was done, YUMMY! I was really proud of myself, and really out did my self this time, i was amazed and excited about my 1st time makeing it, that i told some others about it, my husband tried mine for the 1st time , and he thought it was really terrific!!!  It came out creamy, and firm, and when it was ready some, i added black berries to it, and it was a hit!  I racked my mind on the Internet trying to find a basic recipe, and so glad i found you guys, i think ill just keep

This recipe is awesome, I used it because it had the option to not use an ice cream maker. The only thing I changed was use a little less vanilla and also 2 cups of half and half not heavy cream. Its not icy at all its nice and creamy with a great flavor.

this is a wonderful recipe.  I was looking for an easy ice cream recipe to make for a church function and gave this one a try.  Everyone loved it, including me.  I've already had people asking me to make it again.

We just got a new Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker for Christmas and having never made home-made ice cream before I an trying out many recipes.  This tasted good, but after I made it I froze it overnight.  The resulting ice cream was very hard, and tasted more like diet ice cream.  I think it needs more fat, maybe 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy cream.  I also think that if it had been frozen for 3-4 hours, then eaten, the texture would have been much better.  I might experiment with this recipe as others have.  I would like it to work since it is so easy!

This was creamy and delicious. I followed the recipe and added a bit more vanilla, and used a machine! This was my first time making ice-cream and the reviews were good. I am glad I chose this recipe. I would highly recommend it to anyone making ice cream at home as it tastes just as good if not better than the store..good consistency as well!Bravo!

I am making this ice cream right now in a Cuisinart ice cream/yogurt maker that someone gave to me. I would not call this ice cream but ice milk since it is not the custard based ice cream and basically all you are using is milk and sugar.  I have to say, I am someone who craves sweets every day and this is way too sweet !  I would suggest somehow cutting amount of the sweetened condensed milk used in this recipe so that you use less, or maybe add other flavors to cut down on the sugar.  It is so very sweet, I ate maybe 1/4th cup of the ice cream when it was done and I feel physically, like I just ate a whole bowl of sugar, with milk on it, jittery and nauseated.  If I make this recipe again, I will just use 1/4th cup of sweetened condensed milk instead of the whole can and maybe add fruit for a sweet taste.  
As far as an ice cream taste, this tastes like ice milk.  Also the costs is far greater making this than if you just buy a carton of Breyers on sale.  Homemade is sometimes better in some recipes, but next time I will just buy Breyers or Edys.

This Vanilla Ice Cream was a huge success at our Churn-Off! in Charlotte, NC that I competed in. I won second out of 6 others. I work for my family's honey company called Cloister Honey and so I thought it'd be cool to do a "honey sundae" with this vanilla ice cream, our whipped cinnamon honey and walnuts! it was a huge success. Here are a few pictures from the event: http://cloisterhoney.myshopify.com/blogs/news/6146656-recipe-of-the-week-july-30-august-5-2012

Easiest homemade ice cream I've ever tried!  This also turned out to be delicious with a marvelous light and creamy texture.  I made vanilla but can't wait to try some other flavors. I made mine with my mixer and froze it in a covered container.

I know it's not fair to rate the recipe when you change the ingredients...But we tried this today using whole milk vs the cream and it is GREAT! I really don't like heavy cream for ice cream because it is like eating frozen whipped cream. 
This recipes has endless possibilities

I tried making it in my ice cream maker. I had put the bowl in freezer for over 24 hours and the ice cream wouldn't freeze when i poured everything in and ran it for 3 hrs. So i ended up putting the whole thing in the freezer. Still turned out pretty good. I used Lemon extract instead of vanilla. Yum

This was awesome and I got complements from everyone who tried it. I used the freezer method, and it was much better than ice cream that I've made using an ice cream maker. I made some cookie dough (from an eggless cookie dough truffle recipe on this site) and mixed that in too.

Super easy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe so it would work better in my 5 quart ice cream maker and I added 1/2 cup of cocoa, used half and half, and used fat free sweet and condensed milk.  It took my maker about one hour to finally stop turning and when I opened the lid it looked like the consistency of a Wendy's frosty.  My husband and I love it.  Will make it again!

It's OK in a pinch, but nothing is going to come close to going through the effort of making the custard with eggs and cream.  Don't be fooled by the 5* ratings that many users are giving this recipe--2.5* is reality here.  I might make this again, but knowing the difference of a custard based recipe, it'll have to be a last-minute type of scenario.  (used my kitchenaid ice cream maker attachment for this recipe).

Recipe was so easy.  I added a vanilla bean to the mix and only added 1 tsb of vanilla and it was really fantastic.  The only draw back was that it didn't freeze completely in my machine, after freezing it overnight - mine looked just like the picture.

I grew up going to the county fair every summer.  The big draw at the fair was the FFA's homemade ice cream.  This is identical!!!  It is so good, I cant believe how simple it is. You must try it, just as it is!

After trying this recipe, I would have to advise users to scale down the vanilla extract portion.  2 tblspns creates a stronger than desired vanilla taste.  Extract flavors in ice cream are bold and should be used with care.  I would use 1 to 1 1/4 tablspns for a lighter vanilla presence.

I was in a hurry this past weekend and didn't want to fiddle with the eggs and a custard etc.  I'll admit it, I made this with low expectations for the end product-I felt like I was cheating.  Surprise!  This was simply awesome!  It took two minutes prep time, I just poured all the ingredients into the cannister (though I did scrape a little bit of vanilla bean into the mix) and threw it into the bucket.  The ice and salt process was more complicated than the recipe itself! Homemade apple pie with this ice cream was sublime!  I'll be hard pressed to make the more complicated recipes again, you just can't go wrong with this one.

Absolutely the best ice cream I've ever had.  I made the peach version by reducing the half & half and adding a can of heavy syrup peaches, drained and chopped.  Just don't pay attention to the calorie count!

First time making homemade ice cream, and this recipe was GREAT.  I served it at a party and my guests were raving about how good the ice cream tasted.  They would have sworn it was Breyer's.  Easy to make and easy to increase the serving size.

Very good.  I used whole milk instead of the heavy whipping cream and it was still very good.  Nice flavor.  Fast.

this was way too rich and just tasted like frozen whipped cream. I would maybe use a combination of regular milk and half and half. I made this for one of my classes and nobody really liked it all that much, but maybe it was just us...

This recipe was good to get me on the right track and turned out GREAT after I altered it. I mixed 2 cans of Eagle Brand, 1 qt of Heavy Whipping Cream, 1 qt of Half & Half, 2 Tbs of vanilla and after pouring into a 4 Qt ice cream mixer I filled to the line with whole milk! This was the absolute best ice cream EVER!! I have made it several times and it turns out AMAZING every time. There will be no left overs I PROMISE!! I am sure you could add fruit, chocolate, or any flavor or half this recipe and it would turn out just as good.

Like many of the others, I found this very easy to make!  I have tried recipes that need to be cooked, etc. that taste gritty from the sugar.  With sweetened milk, it doesn't happen.  I made recipe as described and put in ice cream maker.  Worked perfectly!  As my family enjoyed it, we thought of many ways to add yummy things to it.  This time we added 6-single serve instant coffee packs diluted in a very small amount of warm water to the mixture.  (It did not dilute well in the milk mixture). It is in the freezing process now, but the mixture tastes divine!  May add mini-chips for added texture…I'll see how I feel when the final mixing comes around!

Me and my girlfriend used the basic recipe but like others, changed the half and half to whole milk.  Also, we gave it a mocha flavor by  adding  1/4 cup of cocao powder along with 1 rounded tsp of instant coffee and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  We used a Kitchen Aid ice cream freezer attachment and ran it for 25 minutes.  Delicioso!

This is a great, simple vanilla ice cream recipe.  A hit with my whole family.  We were looking for something that had less of that "coating" effect you get with heavy cream recipes.  This was creamy and delicious but not too much so.  Easy to make and great right out of the ice cream maker.

This recipe is wonderful! It is so easy to make and tastes great. I have used it several times at fund raisers for our high school band. Just pour everything in the ice cream freezer and plug it in. It's always a big hit!

Awesome! Now try 2 tablespoons of Maple extract and a handful or so of diced walnuts - Maple/Walnut Ice cream. Can include a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

This was a revelation!  Great taste and texture.  I've made three batches so far, to rave reviews.  Also, this works just as well with the no-fat condensed milk.  I'm going to branch out to some new flavor combinations...look out, world!

I did the refrigerator/freezer method and it tastes good but is extremely rich. I wouldn't have more then a scoop at a time with maybe some fruit or a cookie or piece of cake or pie with it.

I opted for this easy homemade recipe because I wanted foolproof results.  This recipe was so quick and easy to make.  It churned for 20 minutes, then I added chopped Butterfinger bars into the mixture for the last 10 minutes.  It tastes fabulous.  Put it in the freezer for a couple hours to let it harden. Makes a great summer dessert.

Yum!  SImple and delicious.  My first attempt at making ice cream with my Kitchen Aid attachment.  It came out greatI followed some of the suggestions from comments and used 1.5 c heavy cream.  Served it with fresh blueberries and raspberries.  Next time, I'll try adding coconut extract, coconut, almonds and chocolate pieces for Almond Joy ice cream....Thanks Eagle Brand!!

Very nice.  I only had half the amount of light cream called for, so I just halved the recipe.  Instead of vanilla extract, I used the seeds/whatever you scrape from a vanilla bean instead.  It had a lovely vanilla flavor that way.  Husband was complaining it was gritty, but I think that is bc he was eating it before placing it back in the freezer--ice cream making is a process for a reason!  Otherwise, he liked it.  He added in M&Ms apparently bc he could.  I tried it and thought it was good, but can't have much of it due to being lactose intolerant.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful base ice cream.  I've made it twice now, once adding almond extract, marzipan, and slivered almonds and once adding peanut butter.  Both times it came out amazing!  It's way easier than other ice cream recipes and comes out just as good.

It is easy, and if you don't want to pay for the expense of heavy cream, this is a passible recipe. It does crystalize after you deep freeze it but the flavor is very good and you can tweak it with all kinds of additions, if desired. I added cardamon to it and it was wonderful.

Very creamy and yummy.  Used 1 cup 1% milk, 2 cups Light cream, 1 cup half and half.  Nice consistency.  Also used fat free condensed milk (Borden).  I also added 1/4 cup of CoffeeMate vanilla caramel creamer....great smooth taste and nice original flavor.

VERY easy and my guests were impressed, but the flavor wasn't quite the traditional homemade ice cream flavor I was hoping for. This would be good with some fresh fruit added before mixing.

Oh. My. Goodness! Creamy, delicious and oh so easy. We have made home made ice cream for years and this is by far the easiest recipe ever. We won't be using any other recipe but this one from now on.

Good - not Great ... but what do you expect w/ 3 ingredients ?!  Doesn't get much easier than this - and the kids loved it after adding all their cookies and toppings.  We used an ice cream maker - but it never seemed to get 'real' frozen - very soft serve like.

My family enjoyed this recipe just as it is.  We made no changes at all.  It had wonderful flavor and was super easy.   Next time we'll try adding cocoa for chocolate flavor.  You cannot go wrong with this one.

Not sure what went wrong but this turned out way too icey.  I used 2 cups heavy cream and 2.5 cups half & half (it was too sweet).  I used about 12 ounces of the can of condensed milk to avoid overly sweet taste.  Added 1 tablespoon vanilla and 2 tablespoons of honey liqueur.  The mixture tasted good but the texture wasn't smooth or creamy at all.  I guess it pays to make the custard based version when you go homemade.

Woo hoo!  This is delish, and so easy.  This was the first recipe I used in my new icecream maker, and it worked beautifully.  I added 1/2 C Cocoa to make it chocolate.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be way too sweet for my tastes. Next time I will add at least a cup more of milk or half and half. I also will add a dash of salt to add to the flavor. It does have a really nice, smooth texture.

OK, I did what lots of us do...I changed things a bit. I used 2 C. half & half and 2 C. heavy cream and 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. vanilla paste and of course the Eagle Brand.   I froze it in my Cuisinart ice-cream maker (the 2 qt. model) and it came out VERY good!  No after taste and it froze beautifully. Was the vanilla flavor strong?  I don't think so.  IMHO if you are going to go to all the trouble of making something from scratch then don't skimp...I used really good vanilla and cream so maybe that's what this recipe is missing?  Anyway, bottom line?  I had really good results with this simple recipe and will add it to my forever cookbook.

This was all right for a quick dessert, but not nearly as good as other (traditional) ice cream recipes I've tried. There was definitely an odd aftertaste to it and the consistency was more like frozen yogurt than ice cream, so I don't think I'd serve this to company. I might try it again in the future with other flavorings added like pureed fruit or instant coffee, but I wouldn't make it again according to the original recipe.

I think this recipe is super-easy to prepare and the tastiest too! It has the perfect amount of sweetness, I'd compare it to the Breyer's vanilla - it's great on its own or will be a perfect vanilla base for creating your own rocky road mix. I wouldn't change a thing and rated this 5 stars.

I did the fridge freezer method, it was so fast to make, I added instant coffee powder and after letting it freeze for a few hours, added chocolate chunks! I let it freeze over night then had to let it sit at room temp for a few minutes. I want to do this again and add other add ins, I am thinking broken up chips ahoy cookies. Or strawberries cut up.

I doubled the recipe and made a few different kinds of icecream with the base recipe. Cookies and cream was a huge hit, I threw coffee grounds in another mix- that was pretty awesome. Melted peanut butter and mixed it into another little container, loved that one. Alternated chocolate and caramel (layers) in another container, another wise decision. You can get pretty creative.

I wanted ice cream. But didn’t want to cook. Found this recipe but no half and half and no can of condensed milk. But I did have in my refrigerator was whole milk and heavy whipping cream plus Caramelized condensed milk. Mixed 2cups milk and 2cups cream, caramel, vanilla plus pink salt. And YUMMY SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM.        I used oven method to make condensed milk caramel.

After reading a couple of other reviews and knowing that we would want to freeze leftovers for a couple of days, I made the following changes:  3 cups of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of half & half.  I needed to ensure that this remained creamy without ice milk crystals and this did the trick!  However, you could probably use 2 cups cream and 2 cups half & half with similar results.  I did not add any additional sugar as some recipes recommended.  It was quite sweet enough.  We did not use add-ins as this was our 1st time making it and we’d like a good base.  This will definitely work for us and we look forward to experimenting with fruits and flavors!

I will definitely make it again. I used an ice cream maker to freeze it but it was still pretty soft do we put it in the freezer overnight and the next day it was perfect. I had to double the recipe because this only makes half a gallon and i have a big family.

This was honestly as close as you can  get to "custard" ice cream, without the eggs and heating.  The sweetened condensed milk gives it a thick & creamy texture, with no added sugar needed.  This will be our new "go-to" recipe for homemade ice cream.

I have made this many times over the last few summers. I use 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 whole milk or light cream instead, don't need all that fat.  I use my ice cream maker and add chop up Oreo cookies, any variety of candy bar or even M&M's candies at the end, then place it all in a freezer container to firm it up overnight.  The kids all love it naturally but we know it's made with real milk and no by-products whatsoever.

Wow, what an easy home made ice cream base.  
I made it with the help of my 13 year old daughter. 
I added frozen strawberry s in liquid. We put the strawberry s in a processor to make the berries less chunky.  To our amazement it was awesome.  It's for our family 4th of July party we are having tomorrow.  During the party I'm going to make the Coco and Cinnamon receipt I read in one of the reviews.  This is  very inexpensive receipt to make. 
Have Fun!

Finally, I have an ice cream machine.  Had it a year already-- just too busy to use it. It's the 4th of July. What better time to try it?
So, this recipe seemed the easiest. That's true, but it ain't your Grandma's homemade ice cream. My results were good, it's very smooth and creamy, but first taste was disappointing. Tasted like sweetened condensed milk added to vanilla ice cream. We'll eat it, but no shortcut for me next time.

I made this new recipe and put it into my ice cream maker, usually my ice cream maker makes ice cream in 20 mins but almost an hour later it was still liquid so I put it into a container into the freezer and 4 hours later it isn't even close to freezing. I will go back to my old recipe.

It was okay, company liked it. It was a quick and easy recipe. I agree with other reviews, it was more like ice than a cream. Did the job for a quick batch when I didn't have time to make old fashion on the stove.

This ice cream is AMAZING!!!! I will defiantly make it again. My daughter did complain that it was too sweet so next time I will try adding more whipping cream to the mixture to help cut the sweetness (I used the refrigerator freezer method).  I however loved the texture and the taste plus it was super easy to make!

Made this using a Breville ice cream maker. The outcome exceeded my expectations.. Very good, rich vanilla taste and super easy to make..I followed the recipe exactly...I am thinking I will try with heavy cream next time plus will add a little coco.. I have been looking for a no egg no cook recipe... This one gets the job done!

Excellent base!  I added chopped up heath bars to mine.  It's very creamy.  Since I'm not used to such a creamy ice cream I probably would have done it with part milk and part half and half.  Turned out very good and big hit with the company.  I also made peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter cups.  Seconds and thirds were had of each!

Wow, this was good.   I tweeked it by using heavy whipping cream, but that was too rich.  

When we went to the store to buy the sweetened condensed milk, they had caramel flavored, so I bought  a couple. 

I doubled the recipe, but still only had the whipping cream since that was all I bought, and wanted to "tone" it down, so I added whole milk (3 cups) so it was still a little richer than the half and half.  WOW!  Caramel flavored ice cream - it was really good!  Now I'm going to try mocha flavored, and when I get more caramel flavored condensed milk, will try to make a caramel frappuchino flavored one.

I like that this recipe is so easy to make and my kids get to help without making a complete mess!

So easy!  My 8 year old niece and I made this. She was so proud and it tasted great.

We followed the directions (did not whip the cream first as another reviewer suggested) and it came out exactly as I like vanilla ice cream.

This is really good ice cream considering it only takes three ingredients and it is so easy to make. I just mixed everything in the ice cream freezer so I didn't have any cleanup. I'm looking forward to making this again and adding extras!

Tastes great but won't be making this again.  It took 24 hours to freeze to a almost solid state and then melts in less than 5 minutes once out of the freezer.

Absolutely loved the recipe.  I did change a little bit.  Instead of 4 cups of half and half I did 2 cups half and half and 2 cups heavy cream.  Made this in less than 2 hours.

I really liked it.  I made some changes otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  I mixed together all of the ingredients listed, except I used only 1 tablespoon pure vanilla, which was plenty.  I was hesitant at the creaminess and sweetness of the ice cream, partially because I use homemade sweetened condensed milk (also on allrecipes).  So I added 1 pint of heavy cream and 3/4 cup sugar.  I whipped all the ingredients together in a bowl for about 2 minutes then poured into ice cream freezer.  Make sure and ripen this ice cream before serving; otherwise it will start to melt in your bowl as you're eating it--an hour in the freezer does the trick.

This recipe is certainly quick and easy, and pretty good.  However, if you are looking for a richer ice cream, this may not be for you.  I will say, however, that the flavor rivaled Edy's vanilla bean!

So simple and delicious! I would change one thing, use maybe 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract instead of 2. It was really overpowering.

This was a last minute dessert. As I didn't have the full quantity of cream, I used half cream, half milk and substituted coffeee liquor for the vanilla. It was delicious.

I liked the taste from the condensed milk but this was not my favorite vanilla ice cream recipe.  I missed the richness that comes from recipes with whipping cream.

The first time I made this it was good. The second time it tasted really funny...like it was way too much vanilla. Funny thing is I measured the second time, not the first.

I only gave 4 stars because it tends to get a little icy and crumbly the longer it is in the freezer. That is the only thing holding this back from being 5 star. The first day is definitely the best. This is a good base recipe to add whatever you want. Play with extracts, too, if you want a different flavor altogether. Very easy, versatile, and tasty.

I did not care for this recipe. horrible texture - like a mouth full of foam. Suppose it's okay if you like hyped-up softserve but we don't.  Added mint extract and chocolate chips to give it some texture which helped, but won't be making this again.

SO easy and tastes so good that I made 4 batches in the same night and customised the flavours to make vanilla, rum raisin, cookies & cream and peppermint choc chip! This one is now going to be a regular feature in our house - even my 5yo can make it! :) We don't have an ice cream maker so I just froze the mixture in a tub with a lid and stirred it regularly to make sure it didn't crystallise.

I wanted something quick and easy. It is very creamy for sure, but it could definitely use more vanilla flavour to it. Like others I found this tasted a lot like sweetened cream. I am happy I only made half the recipe and will probably use it in milkshakes instead of just eating it as I originally intended.

WONDERFUL AND SIMPLE TO MAKE. I'VE ADDED FRESH FRUITS TO THE MIXTURE AS WELL AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.
