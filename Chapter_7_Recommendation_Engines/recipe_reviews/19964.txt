To die for!!!! Serve a wedge of this on a platter with a spreading knife. Garnish with a bit more smoked salmon and serve with crackers on the side. It would be outrageously rich as a plated appetizer, but as an hors d'oeuvre on a buffet it's perfect. Serves WAY more than 12 that way too. I prefer it with out any bell pepper. FYI- I use a hot smoked salmon vs. cold smoked such as lox. It has a flaky texture and more smoky flavor that I think works better for the recipe.

I follow the recipe exactly. I have made this several times and it has been a hit every time with many people asking for the recipe. I serve as an appetizer. This recipe makes a large cheesecake. Once I cut the cheesecake into 6 wedges and took 3 wedges to one party and 3 wedges to another party the next day. Arrange wedges on a thin bed of lettuce. Garnish with fresh dill and cherry tomatoes. Between the wedges place chopped onion, capers and lemon wedges. Serve with favorite crackers. The cheesecake can be made a day ahead of time and brought to room temperature before serving. I have not tried freezing it, but I think it would do well. This is a great recipe, but costly and time consuming. One time I added red food coloring to tint this pink for a baby shower and it came out beautiful and there was none left. I use the thin sliced smoked salmon in the vacuumm type packs as opposed to the steak type salmon, but I am sure that would work also. Will definately make again because....they BEG me to, so what else can I do?

Wonderful new recipe!  Family & friends loved it!
Living in Alaska I've tried fish about any way it can be made....Karen you gave us a new one, THANK YOU! 
For variety I also tried it w/halibut, green chiles and substituted pepper jack cheese....a nice spicy alternative to a tasty recipe!

This was amazing! I used mushrooms instead of peppers and pepper jack cheese instead of swiss. I also skipped the double pan with water and just cooked it less time. I'm telling everyone about this recipe! I can't believe how awesome, pretty, and simple it was!

I used Parmesan Regiano in the crust and in the cheesecake.  I used half reduced fat philly and half original philly and Gruyere cheeses in the cheesecake.  I didn't use the waterbath as my cheesecake pan doesn't fit in any larger dishes!  This made a very large cheesecake, and took forever to bake.  But it was amazing!  My friends were skeptical when I told them it was a savory cheesecake, but not after they tried it!

Made my own base using  200g Parmesan, 200g fresh breadcrumbs and 100g of melted butter. Also baked as normal cheesecake without water pan - much quicker! Made filling exactly as per recipe and it was utterly delicious. Took end result to a friend's party and nobody could believe it was  home made! Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  I smoke the salmon in a home smoker, and I brine the fish before cooking, so I used unsalted butter for sauting the onion and pepper. I used red bell pepper I had roasted instead of green, but I did not puree the roasted red pepper like the suggestion, I just chopped and sauted the red pepper with the onions, (just like the recipe says for green bell peppers.) The red color of the red bell was nice in the finished product.   Also, I used Asiago for the 3T parmesean in the cheesecake (I still used parmesean for the crust) and Gruyere instead of Swiss.  The cake started getting very brown midway through the cooking, so I shielded the top with foil.  I served each slice on a bed of lettuce, with fresh dill and capers, and got rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again!

I baked this in a glass pan and it baked fine, but tasted "egg"ier than I wanted it too. Maybe next time, less egg and more cheese ingredients. Definitely could have had more salmon, but was fine in this ratio.

This was pretty good, but it felt like it was missing something. I think I'll add more salmon the next time I make it, and see if that helps. Texture was great.

It was delicious and pretty easy to make.  I made this dish for my coworker and had everyone requesting the recipe!

Wasn't very fond of this, maybe it was just me. I do like smoked salmon and cream cheese on bagels, but blending them together like this, the texture wasn't very appealing to me. I would not recommend.

Outstanding!  The only modification I made was to sub in 1/2 a red and 1/2 a yellow bell pepper instead of using green.  I think green bell pepper overwhelms in a lot of dishes.  I served on a brunch buffet and it went faster than the homemade croissants!  It was absolutely wonderful with PNW hot smoked salmon instead of lox (cold smoked salmon).  I'll make this over and over again for sure.  A winner!

This is a great appetizer.  My brother raved over it.  Very popular the two times I have served it.  I just baked it like a regular cheesecake though for about an hour not in the water bath and it turned out fine.

I haven't tried this yet, but I can't wait to!  Question:  I'm planning a large party soon.  How would this work in small slices as part of a buffet of appetizer type foods?  Too heavy?  I suppose good judgement WOULD dictate giving it a try before the party.  I have a small springform -- I don't see a problem with making half the recipe -- 12 servings is a lot when you live alone!  thanks for sharing.
