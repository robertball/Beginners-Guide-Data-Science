I didn't like this cake, taste wise or the method...I think the pan needs to be greased. Mine came apart trying to get it out of the pan. The taste was a bit like a store-bought sponge cake. We put fresh pineapple, whipped cream, and cherries on it and it was better.

This recipe baked up sooooo light and fluffy, and I had no trouble taking it out of the pan. However, it was too sweet for my taste, and I can't quite taste the pineapple. It tasted like a sweet regular sponge cake. Next time I would use 1 cup of sugar, and added more pineapple juice. 5 star for texture and 4 stars for taste.

This turned out very good.  Nice and light.  I added crushed pineapple to the bottom of the pan before adding the batter.  This kept the cake from sticking to the top and made it easier to remove.

Lovely twist for a spong cake.   For those that had difficulty getting out of the pan here are a few tips:   make sure that pan is absolutely grease free and do not try to remove until cold.  Hope this works for you.

I folded about 1-1/3 cup of drained crushed pineapple from a can along with the eggwhites into the batter, used lemon extract  instead of the juice, and halved the amount of pineapple juice which was some of the juice from the can. Turned out exactly as a spongecake should. Don't be afraid of greasing the pan, if your pan isn't brand new chances are it might stick because the non-stick coating isn't intact. Garnished with a little double cream cheese frosting and maraschino cherries as suggested, made a lovely tea time cake.

I agree with first poster it does fall apart, it turns out very crumbly... not very presentable. Taste was indeed good...
