Really good flavor, mine didn’t stay round but it’s to be expected for some flattening to occur on a baking sheet. Fits better in a pita anyway.  I didn’t make the yogurt sauce because I had my own Tzatziki recipe. Judging by the measurements in this recipe, make more, you can never have enough yogurt sauce.
