4-stars for taste; 3-stars for presentation  This pie has very good flavor, but the next time I make it I will drain the liquid off the mango-strawberry mixture before putting it in the pie shell.  I waited to cut the pie until it had completely cooled and there was too much liquid which resulted in a soggy crust.  This made it very hard to lift out nice looking pieces.

Fantastic! Delicious! Recipe was easy to follow and true to amounts. I personally like a little more of the crumb mixture so I just made more and added it. I also added a bit of orange juice when simmering the mangoes and strawberries... it adds a nice thick sort of glaze to the fruit as it reduces. Just options.

This pie was good, but I wouldn't say amazing. I did alter the recipe according to what I had on hand, but I don't think it this had much impact on the final result.
I used lemon and lime juice instead of apple juice because that's all I had. I had an 8" pie crust so I ended up getting rid of all the excess liquid that was left with the cooked mango and strawberries. I also omitted the nutmeg. 
I thought there was way too much crumb mixture (even though I didn't use all of it). 
If I was to do this pie again, I would probably not do the crumb mixture and just use a regular pie crust on top.

Great recipe with some modifications. It's true the mango/strawberry filling is pretty thin in the pot, but just add a corn starch blend to thicken it up (I shake cornstarch with enough water to mix it well and then add to the pot).  If you pour off the liquid, you'll lose most of the mangos! A tablespoon of cinnamon and nutmeg?  I used a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Perfect.

Did not like at all! Fruit was rubbery and filling was very runny. Crust got mushy underneath. Nutmeg was very overpowering in crumble. One of the worst pies I have ever made.

This pie has been a hit every single time I've made it. I cut down the nutmeg and added more of the crumbly stuff on top. I also made homemade whipped cream with almond extract and a little lemon juice to dallop on top. SO GOOD. This recipe will definitely be used and abused.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this, because I feel like I made this just as the recipe said.  Although I took the nutmeg down to 1/2 T instead.  During the cooking of the strawberries and mango mixture, I thought it was delightful.  I now wish I had just stopped there and served it over ice cream instead.  Instead, the topping just ended up so overbearing in both proportion to the filling and in taste.  Not a fan.

AMAZING!  This is one of the best pies I've ever had.  The crumb topping goes wonderfully with the strawberry-mango mixture.  The only changes I made was  cut down the nutmeg, like everyone suggested.  Just so you know, margarine doesn't have less fat than  butter, it just has different kinds of fat than butter and may or may not have "trans" fat depending on the margarine you get. Butter has a lot of saturated fat. if you have to choose between margarine with trans fats and butter, butter's the way to go.  On the other hand, if you have non-trans margarine on hand, that's what's better for you...

I just made this and because other reviewers said it was too runny I added 2 TBL pf tapioca.  Just what it needed.  Slices into nice pieces.  Also, Maybe my mango's were to small so i didn't seem to have enough filling for my pan so after I'd already put it in the pie shell I stirred in about 1/2 cup of fresh blue berries.  Also used 1 tsp of nutmeg instead of 1 TBL in the topping.  Oh boy!  Delish!

I was wondering if someone knows if this pie filling could be canned

My mangoes were a little tart although very ripe and it reminded me of rhubarb strawberry pie.

This was a great recipe! I made this with fresh fruit and it tasted great. I've never had a pie that tasted anything like that, it was a great tropical flavor and wasn't too sweet or too sour. The only change I made was only adding a pinch of nutmeg instead of a full teaspoon. Thanks!

Pretty good--although I think it would have better without the nutmeg. I did not have any apple juice, so I substituted orange juice, and used a ready made graham crust.

I have made this twice and it has come out wonderful both times. The recipe is fool proof. The 1st time I made it in the mountains, 6000ft elevation, power kept going out, was in the oven for 1 1/2 hours and came out perfect. 2nd time was made at home just like the recipe says and it came out perfect. The only chance to the ingrediants was much less nutmeg(not a fan). Everyone raved, a new family favorite favorite.
