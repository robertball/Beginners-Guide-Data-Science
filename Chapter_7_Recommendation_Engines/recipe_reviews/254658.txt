We make this, as we refer to it is "Farm cheese"', on our ranch using our cows milk. It's wonderful. 
For the people having problems getting it to curd, the OP should have stated to use WHOLE MILK. You need the fat to help it curd. When I make this using store bought milk, rather than from our cows, I find the cheapest whole fat milk they have 
works the best. I've also found having the milk at room temp helps as well.

This is perfect for a low-sodium diet. Next time I'm going to try rice vinegar for a milder flavor.

All that happened here was I wasted a cup of milk.  This was my first attempt at homemade cheese and now I'm rather leery to try any others.

This was very simple and the result was excellent. I will definitely make it again. Although, I am going to make more than just one serving. I was glad to start off making only one serving to see how it would work, but I will definitely make more of it next time. Thank you!

This didn't work for me at all. I made 6 servings but only ended up with 1 serving when it was all said and done. It barely made curd. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what the problem was? One thing I will say is to bring the milk to a boil SLOWLY. It will scorch if you try to bring it to a boil like you would a pot of water. I would like to try this again to see if I can make it right but it's not worth the risk of wasting more milk. Sorry.

Made it using five cups of milk. Wanted more than one serving. Easy and tastes better than store bought.

This recipe did not make sense.  The milk should only be warmed to 120F then taken off the heat and vinegar stirred in.  Curds will form instantly.  Also, the nutrition data is wrong.  It is the data for the cup of milk, not the resulting cheese that does not convert all the protein in the milk to cheese.  Other data is likewise wrong.  I just made a big pot with 1/2 gal of milk and 1/2C of vinegar with corrected instructions.
