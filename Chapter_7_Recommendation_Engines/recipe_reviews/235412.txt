I cooked this for Christmas dinner. I added a tsp of Rosemary only because I know I used to use it for prime. Yum

This is a fantastic method to prepare prime rib!  I've cooked it  3 or 4 times now and it's my go to for preparing a roast.  I also like preparing it with a bone- in prime rib roast.  Regrettably I must leave out the garlic powder due to a severe allergy so can't speak to how that would enhance the flavour.  I also have a convection oven so cut down the cooking time accordingly.  With my oven I cooked it for just under two hours and it was cooked medium.

I made this for our Christmas dinner and it turned out delicious.  I had 21 people, so I bought two 5 pound roasts and just doubled the ingredients.  Heated to an internal temperature of 135 degrees and was able to satisfy our guests that liked medium rare to medium.  Have some leftovers and will make French Dip sandwiches.
