This is a great recipe, although I changed a few things.  I left out the salt, doubled the garlic, added a tablespoon of ginger, added 1/4 cup red wine, added 1/4 cup of honey, and threw in some carrots and broccoli.  It turned out GREAT.  I think adding the cooking wine and honey gave it an extra kick.

This recipe has become a part of my slow cooker repertoire.  I found this recipe about a year ago and it has become one of our favorites.  So easy and so good - my husband is a "meat and potatoes" man, so he loves this pepper steak teamed with mashed potatoes and a salad.

ok so i havent eaten it yet but i have picked at it and its DELICIOUS! i followed the recipe and my meat was VERY tender within 2 1/2 hours. and that was with my crock pot set to 8 hours on low. so i dont know why the recipe says 6 to 8 hours. so i will be leaving it on warm until dinner time as it is only 2:50 pm.but its a keeper and i would recommend it to anyone.

Maybe it's me. The reviews sounded great. My family found this bland. Every recipe sounds good, but all these slow cooker recipes seem bland in the end.
They smell great while cooking + when you walk in the door. Rival new oval cooker. Pork, ham, beef chicken all taste simular + everything falls apart.
Is this normal?

I doubled the recipe and used stewing beef, added worchestersire sauce, a bit of ginger, and some hot pepper sauce as we like our food spicy.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make again but I will likely use a little less soy sauce as it was a bit salty - even with the low sodium sauce and omitting the extra salt.

This is such a nice meal, I also add a bag of birds eye baby brocoli, cauliflower and endeme mix the last hour or two and I double the sauce atleast.  Serve over brown rice, have made this several times.

Tasty. Did not add extra salt, did add a good red wine and a few tblsp of balsalmic vinegar as well as some extra water before adding to initial meat mixture. I made sure to taste the sauce before adding to the meat mixture. The only reason for the 4 star rating is because of the changes made.Also added broccoli and carrots. Will make this again for sure.

This is a great and simple meal.  Tender, juicy, tasty.  Now a regular meal for my table.  Not sure how the bad reviewers screwed up this meal.  (overly salty being the exception)  If you don't usually salt your meals, definately leave out the extra salt.  But as a salt-a-holic myself, it was just salty enough.  Don't over cook the meat in the browning process and you'll do just fine.

Great, but I made a few changes.  Left out the salt because of the soy sauce and left out the sugar, switched the green peppers for red (which are sweeter than green).  Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious! Even my kids like it and they cant stand bell pepper. I want to say I followed the recipe exactly, but I made 2 mistakes: 1) I accidentally used worchershire sauce instead of soy sauce (the bottles look the same!) and I misread the amount of sirloin and only bought 1.5 lbs. It was still awesome! Ill make it correctly next time and expect it to be even better.

Although this was a good recipe for pepper steak and very easy to make, it had too many green peppers for my taste.  I think two green peppers would have been just right.  Either way it was pretty good...

This is a 5 star recipe with a few alterations. I really recommend adding some red wine before cooking as others have done - it adds a richness to the sauce. I used stew meat, because I had it on hand and it came out very tender. It took some time to get the sauce thickened. The flavor was great and prep is easy. Definitely worth a try!

I wish that half stars could be awarded, this would be three and a half.  I thought it a three, my husband thought it a four.  This dish is pretty bland, the sauce needs some tinkering.  I put a few drops of Frank's Buffalo sauce in it, but that didn't even really liven it up.  The meat is tender and it tastes fine, but nothing special.  I wouldn't serve it to company, but it does make the house smell delicious.  With some adjustments it could be a lot better.

My family liked this.  I will try it again, next time maybe enhancing the sauce with more flavors.  I did add ground ginger and that was good, but to make enough gravy/sauce I doubled the cornstarch mixture which made it a little more bland.  Definite potential.

I thought this was pretty good. I did add about a teaspoon of ginger. Next time I will add more. I marinated the meat in some soy sauce, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and garlic. Also mine took forever to thicken up so I would suggest using more of the cornstarch mixture. Thanks for the recipe.

This was good, but salty even though I cut the soy to 1/4 cup, and added a cup of beef broth (no water).  I too used tri color peppers and sliced onion it was a very "pretty" dish.  Thanks CBCBROWN!

This was GREAT!!!!!!!!!  I did tweek the recipe to add color and more flavor to it.  Instead of all green peppers, I used red, yellow, and the green to give it more color.  I also added onion powder, garlic powder, 1/2 cup red wine, honey and only put 1/2 of the recommended salt.  This dish had a very nice sweet flavor.  I served this over sticky white rice.  It was even better the second day!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I pretty much went with the changes Linda Mclean made. I used light soy sauce and reduced the amount, left out the sugar and salt, added in garlic powder and worcester sauce. I  used red and green peppers and made the cornflour mix with beef broth. The result was wonderful. Thanks Linda for the tips and thanks cbcbrown for the starting point.

This smells delicious while cooking.  We added the additional salt which made it un-edible!  The soy sauce adds plenty of sodium so no additional salt is necessary.  Otherwise, this dish is terrific.  Thanks for sharing.

It was ok, but nothing outstanding. Put brown gravy over the beef and rice, without it, it would have been dry. I will make again but will not add salt.

This was not good. It was so salty and dry and did not need to cook for 6-8 hours. I ended up  picking up KFC for dinner.

I used red and yellow peppers instead of green, just personal preference. Even my preschooler ate it, which is saying something!

This is a great recipe and turned out perfectly. If you like it less salty use lite soy and leave out 1 tsp of salt.  To add flavor used diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and cut all fat off meat to reduce grease.  I cooked for 6 hours in slow cooker and it was perfect.  I did double the sauce and served over rice.  My husband loved it.  Easy to make.

Pepper steak has been a favorite in my family for 2 generations.  I found this and it is so similar to my recipe but gave the extra flavor we have been looking for.  FANTASTIC.  Except I agree, too much salt.  Next time I will leave the salt out and it will be better than perfect.

Perfect dinner for the whole family.  I did add more LIGHT soy sauce and more water.  No salt!  Served mine over stir fried veggies, mostly broccoli, and served kids' over rice.  Think next time I'll serve over chow mein noodles. Everyone loved it!

I thought this recipe was very easy to prepare. I followed it to the "T" and it was perfect. Once you change the recipe all around, it is not fair to give it a bad rating. I poured it over brown rice and it was absolutely delicious!

Good base recipe, but it needed a little umpf. I used leftover london broil which didn't need searing; beef broth in lieu of water (and much more than stated), no sugar, no salt, cut back on the lite soy sauce, added a bit of worcestershire sauce and used red, green, yellow and orange peppers. Garlic and onion powders helped with the flavoring. All in all a good recipe that I served over orzo pasta. Thanks!

I found this to be OK but lacking in flavor. Nothing terrific that would make me want to make it again. Just so so. Definitely did not need the extra salt. There is enough with the soy sauce.

Did not add any salt, used low sodium soy sauce, one cup of beef broth in place of water.  I added the peppers in the beginning, should have waited until the last hour of cooking (as per recipe).  Served with brown rice in a bowl. The steak was so tender, we used a spoon. Yum.

This recipe is amazing! I left out the cornstarch bit because my husband does not like thick sauces and added one chopped jalapeno for a small kick and it was the perfect balance.

That was REALLY good. Now we were looking for a way to get rid of our yellow and orange bell peppers so we used these instead of green, and it came out absolutely delicious. I wouldn't change a thing, though I imagine if you want to use a cheaper priced roast meat that would likely work just as well, it's just that sirloin is leader. Gonna make this again.

This was really good. I added a tad bit more water, garlic powder to the browning meat, and a teaspoon of wostershire sauce. But those were the only differences. It came out awesome. I also cooked it on high for 4.5 hours to save some time. Still was very tasty!

This was a really simple recipe.  The only thing is, and i hope someone can help me with this, whenever it was done.  The broth was really greasy, and it didn't have as much flavor in it, as it did in the beginning.  I would really like to mastor this dish, Thank you for the Recipe!!

Tried this recipe as written but ended up doctoring it when it turned out a little to bland.  Added more garlic, red wine, worcestershire sauce, mushrooms, 2 onions.  Family loved it.

This was a disappointing recipe. I omitted the salt, but the meat was still unbelievably salty from the soy sauce (to the point of inedible). It also looked & tasted charred after cooking in the crock pot. I ended up putting everything in a sauce pan and cooked the peppers like a stir fry. My husband threw most of his out. Sorry, but I'll have to keep looking for a pepper steak recipe which doesn't use the crock pot.

Loved it! I accidentally used worcester instead of soy sauce at first, but I drained it and then added  the soy sauce - maybe this touch of worcester enhanced the flavor. Otherwise I followed it exactly (halved the recipe) and it was perfect. Might be salty for some, but not me.

I have made this many many times and it is a favorite in our home. The meat practically melts in your mouth.

I made this last night and it was excellant. I cooked it in my Presto Options Slow Cooker set on Warm for six hours. I omitted the salt and doubled the cornstarch and water and it was perfecto! (For an added taste, put in a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of Cinnamon)

I made this last night and it was pretty good.  I didn't add salt or sugar.  I think next time I make it I will add a little ginger to it.  That's what it may be missing

This was a great meal. It took a little more prep than I would like, but mostly it's just chopping the veggies.  I don't eat meat, and jsut ate the sauce over rice.  My husband put the steak, sauce and rice in a tortilla and ate it as a fajita.  I didn't add the extra salt like some of the reviews said, and I think it was plenty salty.
