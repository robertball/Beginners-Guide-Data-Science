These are so delicious!  I made the version with peanut butter, and was worried when I tasted the batter because they have an odd flavor.  But once they're baked - so good!  I did change three things because I didn't have regular wheat flour or walnuts on hand.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and used wheat pastry flour.  And I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. I'm not sure if the pastry flour or the peanut butter variation was the difference in timing, but these needed to bake 11-12 minutes for me.  Worth the wait!  They will not last long.  Note that they don't spread much either, so you can fit a lot of little cookies on a tray.  I made them on parchment and had no issue with the bottoms over browning as the recipe warns.  Great moist, dense texture without being too heavy.  Thank you for a winner!  I was going to take these to work, but I think they won't make it out of the house :)  The only thing I may try next time is a shot of cinnamon, which I love with oatmeal and banana.

These turned out tastier than I expected. I followed the recipe according to the other reviewers and made the peanut butter version. I made 1/2 recipe and it yielded 30 cookies, with a standard cookie scoop. For this amount of the recipe I used 1 large sliced frozen banana I defrosted in the microwave. It came to 1/3 of a cup. The footnotes mentioned adding extra banana as okay. These were actually chewy and I like how healthy they were with the banana, walnuts, oatmeal, wholewheat, etc. I liked how all of the different flavors could be tasted. Also, I didnt toast the nuts. Almost all come that way today and dont like the burnt like taste they can impart from double roasting. The cookies took 15 minutes to bake on a parchment lined sheet. My only issue is that they are chewy when first baked because of the melty chocolate. The next day they turn into more of a dense cake like cookie. I guess, similar to the boxed whole grain cookies. At least this is healthier.

I tried the peanut butter variation.  Used all white flour.  I find they cook better if you flatten them a bit before cooking.

I also used the peanut butter version of this recipe and decreased the salt to about 3/4 tsp.  This is a fluffier type cookie that doesn't spread out much.  Love the fact that it uses whole wheat flour and oats.  I also substituted fruit puree for the other half of the butter.  Healthier alternative to a traditional chocolate chip cookie.  Plan to try next time without the peanut butter for a totally different taste.  These are even better the second day. My teenagers loved them.


Just made these for the second time today. (9-12-14)  This time I used the original recipe (no peanut butter) because I am taking them to a youth volleyball tournament (food allergies). I threw in extra banana and a few extra chocolate chips since I am not using any nuts.  Still used the fat substitutions as listed above. This is a very forgiving recipe allowing for modifications. Had to try 1/2 of one before I take them tonight. Couldn't resist eating the other half! These are so soft and delicious. They do need to bake the full 12-13 min. and cool on the pan as per the recipe.  These will be a definite repeat!

These were absolutely amazing! I used regular salt and all white flour and I swapped out regular butter for peanut butter. These are probably the best cookie I have ever eaten. I used about 3 bananas. I will definitely be making these again. I used a 1 tablespoon scoop and I made 48 cookies. They were just the right size!

I chose this cookie recipe because it required less bake time than banana bread. It turned out to be a great alternative! 

It is definitely more of a bready cookie, but I enjoy that texture. I followed the recipe as shown and left out the walnuts. One and a half bananas ended up being about a half cup for me. 

The cookies turned out delicious!

Tasty! I made as directed but substituted quick oats for old fashioned oats (because of availability). I usually have these ingredients on hand. I will be making this again. I really loved using parchment paper for ease of work!

Really like the ingredients and taste. I had to add 1/2 cup flour extra because first batch came out too flat and sticky. I will cut back on some the sugar when I make these again.

I’m adding a star because my objection is not the recipe’s fault; it turns out that I don’t love a banana flavored cookie. I did make the peanut butter version, and it’s possible that I might like them better without that variation, but I doubt it.  I think it’s really the banana flavor I don’t like.  I do like that they’re not too sweet, and the texture is ok with me.  I did add extra oats (and a bit more liquid) and probably would have preferred even more.  They’re good enough to eat, but I doubt that I’ll make them again.

They taste great!  I followed most of the recipe, just used white flour, as I didn't have wheat. Also, added more banana because I wanted to use them up. Cooking time was increased to about 13 minutes total.

These were very good! I followed the recipe (peanut butter version) completely except for these changes: used 2 bananas, used some chocolate chips and some chocolate chunks that I had on hand, and 3/4 tsp salt as recommended by another review. I made 49 cookies from this one recipe, no adjustment to servings! Flattened cookies before baking as was recommended and baked each batch 11-12min. The cookies were well received by family, friends and coworkers. Next time I'll try the regular version without peanut butter. Very fun to make!

What a wonderful way to use up bananas - especially loved that the cookies were not too sweet, so we didn't feel too guilty when they were gone so quickly

the batter came out watery - i followed the recipes however it's too runny, so I added flour about 1/2 cup more to get it's concistency. I didn't have brown sugar that time so I changed to granulated sugar about 1 1/2 cup. it tasted good, my family likes it thank you

I'm a missionary in Thailand and it's banana season NOW!!!!  I made over 100 because my kids will sell them at the market to raise money for camp.  THE KIDS LOVE THE COOKIES!!!!  I wish I used more ripped bananas for the taste but the texture is perfect.  Will make many times I'm sure??????

I did make changes -- I had 2 small bananas that when mashed amounted to a heaping 1/2 cup, I used 1/2 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut instead of walnuts, 1 cup of oatmeal was not near enough for me or the texture I like in a cookie so I added 2 more for a total of 3.  They were perfect for me and they won't last very long!  Will be keeping this recipe and will make it next time with the peanut butter suggestion.

These are wonderful cookies.  My fiancée loves bananas & chocolate chips so it was obvious I needed to make these.  I replaced the white sugar w/honey & added Flax seed meal plus bumped up the wheat flour to thicken the batter as the honey made it a bit runny.  It is a bit denser than an average cookie but between the banana, brown sugar & honey there is just enough sweetness.  I certainly would make these again.

Great recipe! I left out the nuts since I know my kids won't eat them, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I think they would be even better with the nuts.

I used two mashed super ripe bananas and no nuts. It might have been a bit more liquidy than one review because they did spread quite a bit. Super yummy! Soft. Moist.

I made it as written, without the walnuts. Didn't hold up and spread out too much.  Don't like having to rotate while baking.  Too much trouble.

Great flavor, I freeze the bananas before hand to develop a syrup once thawed which helps increase the banana flavor. However, the texture is not that of a cookie- more cakey, but nonetheless tasty!

I omitted brown sugar, oats, and walnuts. Replaced with double ripe banana, millets and sunflower seeds, added 2 tbs creamy organic peanut butter. Also melted the Pure unsalted Irish butter. And a packet of flaxseed. The whole family and piano teacher love these!!

I used the peanut butter version mentioned at the bottom of the recipe and my kids loved it!  I did not use any nuts in my batch.
