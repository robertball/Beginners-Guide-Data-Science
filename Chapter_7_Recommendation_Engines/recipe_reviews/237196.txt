Made this today, so tasty and easy. Only change I made was using 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup plain yogurt. I also added about 2 TBSP ground flax seed. Overall perfect texture and flavor, yum

Absolutely love it!  I make waffles every Wednesday (Wednesday Waffles!) and this is definitely my new favorite.  I just use straight fresh stone ground flour (hard red wheat) and couldn't ask for better flavor.

First time I made this exact to the recipe and they were great (made 6 waffles).  Since then I've been asked constantly by the family for more....so each time, I do something a little different.  Like adding bacon chopped fine and sub brown sugar for the white sugar.   Variations include adding flax meal, hemp hearts...but always turn out nicely and make a nice crisp waffle.

I sometimes make these vegan by substituting almond milk and a flax egg (1T ground flax mixed with 2T hot water), or just add flax seeds. I up the vanilla a bit, add a small splash of almond extract, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. This is a great base recipe for a whole wheat coconut oil waffle that can be adjusted to taste. My toddler loves them!

My new favorite recipe for whole wheat waffles, the Belgian waffles turned out crisp on the outside and fluffy tender inside. I used unsweetened coconut milk, and subbed Swerve for the sugar.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Delicious! Made exactly as written and it came out very well.  It's also easy to make, which is a big plus.  Only bad thing - it doesn't make enough.  I'll likely double the recipe next time.

I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour on hand, so I tried it with regular whole wheat flour. They turned out a little flatter than they look in the picture; otherwise, they turned out great. The best part is that my kids loved them! I was looking for a good breakfast to eat on the go for my kids, and since they don't mind them dry, I think these waffles will be a great option.

Best waffles ever! I use the blend tec blender to grind the wheat berries into flour.  I also use honey instead of sugar. My whole family love them even my anti whole wheat kiddos.

I was not sure how these were going to taste but they are crazy good. I did substitute buttermilk for the regular milk and will be making these again.

Great recipe - thank you! This time I used the exact ingredients listed, but I will try it with raw sugar in the future. (The raw sugar will have to be mixed with the liquid ingredients instead of the dry ones.) Thanks again!!!

Excellent recipe.  All I had was pastry flour and these came out light and fluffy with a crunchy exterior.  I wouldn’t change a thing.  No, it didn’t make that many waffles but i’m guesing you can always double the recipe.

These are fabulous -- probably the best home made waffle I've ever had!! I followed the recipe except:  I increased vanilla to 1 tsp., and (as others have done) I substituted light brown sugar for the white sugar. These waffles have it all: dense, great aroma, and they are delicious! I'm always going to make these from now on! Thanks, JulieE!!

A very simple and basic recipe that you can twerk in many ways; I used butter milk and coconut oil and they came out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I also added a 1/4 tsp coconut extract along with the vanilla extract.  I might use brown sugar next time just to liven up the flavor, maybe use a bit less flour.  All in all, a great go to recipe for waffles.

1st time I made it exactly as stated and was perfect as written.  It's a heavier waffle than a Belgium waffle but that's to be expected with whole wheat flour. Flavors were great and the coconut oil brings a slight sweetness. 
I love to change flavors up the 2nd time around so I added 1 chopped banana and 2 T. ground flaxseed and was equally as delish but with the sweetness of the banana.

Great waffle recipe!  Definitely one of the simpler as well as healthier waffles out there.  Made no changes and they turned out delicious.  Not to mention it gives off that coconut scent and flavor too!  This made about three whole Belgian waffles.

I used regular all-purpose flour because I did not have wheat flour on hand. I also added some vanilla protein powder. These turned out very good - and my 5 year-old son really likes them too.

Because I am diabetic, I added Nopel (dried cactus)
anyone can use Nopal, It adds Fiber and it is tasteless and is good for you. Ordered off of internet. I put it in every recipe I make. No harm done.

Loved these, I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, sifted together with all dry ingredients, put egg in blender and blended until light and fluffy, added the rest of wet ingredients ( increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.) to blend together, then added in the dry and blended n lower spread until just combined and smooth.  Put about 3/4 c mixture in my waffle grill which makes 2 at a time and cooked about 6 minutes until the steam begins to stop coming out of the iron. I also out paper towels at the bottom of the plate I stacked them on and between them to keep them crispy until all where cooked and ready to serve.  This was my first try at waffles and a great success.

I was looking for a new waffle recipe to try. I didn't have the whole wheat flour, so just used all purpose. The waffles turned out light and crispy, with a lovely flavor. It made 4 Belgium sized waffles.

Really good. Also didn't have whole wheat pastry flour so I sifted regular whole wheat flour. Also added pecans. My husband and 5yr old also loved them.

Being the first to review I made the recipe exactly as it was written. Results: perfect texture & good flavor with a hint of coconut. This recipe is easy & quick to make.This would go great with a pineapple or coconut syrup but I had regular syrup & Irish butter and it was enjoyable. Wheat flour makes this waffle a little more filling than other recipes. Big fan of the coconut oil instead of butter or shortening.
