Trying to eat more ground turkey, so this recipe caught my eye.  I knew in looking at the ingredients that if I followed this recipe exactly, it would be too hot for us.  We like things spicy, but not "fiery" as the recipe author describes this chili.  I cut back the black pepper and the red pepper flakes, and it was still spicy good (and just about perfect for us).  Unless you really like it HOT, I'd suggest you start out modestly on the heat ingredients and then add more to suit your taste.  This is my first effort at turkey chili, and we enjoyed this recipe.  It will be made again.

I used a jar of spicy habanero salsa (which may be a bit too hot for most).  However, this gave the turkey fantastic flavor! This recipe has a nice mix of seasonings, beans, etc.  Chili  is one of my family's favorites, so I constantly try new recipes...this is a recipe that everyone raved about.  it's a keeper!!

Was looking for a base recipe for a chili and came across this. For the most part I stuck to the recipe but added some of my own stuff like a couple jalapenos, a splash of red wine, and only had 1lb turkey and 1lb spicy chorizo. Was looking for s spicy recipe and this delivered. All-in-all it's a good recipe. Made it more than a handful of times.
