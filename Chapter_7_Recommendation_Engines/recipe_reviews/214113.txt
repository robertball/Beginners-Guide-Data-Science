OK.... Here's taking it to the next level. worth it...
add 10 oz strawberries, halved.
add 1/8 cup toasted pine nuts
Add strawberries and rhubarb  and nuts in bottom of dish. dash of fresh pepper grind over. - trust me.
Tip- add extra flour on roll out surface- work fairly quickly the dough starts to "rise" quickly and makes roll up harder.
use a preheated cookie sheet under dish .- spills over.
Seems juicy but the dough soaks it up after it cools.
DELICIOUS--  Early Summertime cobbler  joy! Serve warm- top with vanilla ice cream of course.

This recipe is very forgiving. I had to substitute grape juice for cranberry juice because itâ€™s all I had. I added a handful of cranberries to the sugar-juice syrup. It was a nice addition. I also only had a larger glass dish and was not sure how to stretch the recipe. I just filled in the gaps with additional bisquick and milk dough mix. This worked great. My version was slightly dryer but when topped with ice cream it was perfect. Very forgiving. This is a keeper.
