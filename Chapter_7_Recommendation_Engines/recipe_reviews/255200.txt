I'm certainly not a cook so when I say that this was easy I mean it! And delicious too!! I added chicken and used parmesan cheese (because I didn't have the other kind). There is a technique to making the zucchini spaghetti so I'll have to work on that but it's well worth the effort! I will defiantly be making this again ??

I've had the spiralizer took for almost 2 years, and I can't believe how easy it was to use! Wish I would have tried it sooner-and this recipe was perfect. Next time I would use 2 zucchini as they really reduced as the moisture came out.  And to add protein next time I might add shredded chicken and maybe even some crumbled bacon on top. But it was delicious just the way it was-didn't change anything this time.

My family loved it! We had it as a side. My only comment is possibly should use a little less olive oil. I had a hard time with trying to cook it until it was dry. Flavor was awesome though!

This was awesome!! Absolutely loved it. I used parmesan cheese instead. I also drizzled with a chicken and alfredo sauce (to add protein and make it more filling).

I had other vegetables that were crying out to be used. Shredded baby carrots and snap peas. Used parmesan/Romano mix. Very colorful and delicious!

So delicious! I grew zucchini’s in the garden this year and wanted to try using them as noodles and this recipe didn’t disappoint!!! I used feta cheese though.
