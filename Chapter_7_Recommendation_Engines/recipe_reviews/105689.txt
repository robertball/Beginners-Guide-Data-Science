Great recipe! I added the recommended tablespoon of peanut butter and also added a tablespoon of my favorite habenero hot sauce,(Ebese Zozo) which is a curried hot sauce.

Next time I'll double the curry paste and add a bit more lime juice. It also seems my jumbo prawns finished quicker than the sea scallops so I'd start the scallops about 2 minutes before I throw in the prawns next time.

Very tasty if you like coconut curries, yum!

This was delightful.  I substituted regular for light coconut milk which made a very rich sauce and also added a little extra lime juice.  I served it with basmati rice and a hot pepper sauce on the side. Now my kitchen is my new favorite place to have curry for dinner!

Oh Yum! This is so good. I added more asparagus, shrimp and mushrooms. I also followed advice and added 1Tbsp of Peanut butter. I didn't have curry paste so I added a lot of curry powder. I will go find the paste but it was really good even with the curry powder. Everyone loved it. I served it over a mix of brown and wild rice. Thanks for sharing.

I made this as written and it was okay.  The flavor doesn't really stick to the seafood.  This is a good base for a curry dish but needs some tweaks.

Added peanut butter as others suggested.  Nice addition.  As is, "hotness" rating is about 3-4/10, which is right where I like it, not too hot-so add more or less curry paste to taste.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe has a delicious combination of flavors.  I read that curry pastes (red, green, yellow) are interchangeable.  My suggestion is to start with less curry, then add to taste.  Would definitely make this again.

This recipe was excellent! I added a little more brown sugar and about a tablespoon of peanut butter because we prefer a sweeter curry. I only had jumbo shrimp available for fresh seafood but I'm sure it would be great either way. I'm definitely adding this one to my 'favourites' list!

YUMMY!!  Love dishes with coconut milk and curry paste...we really enjoyed this.  I used green curry paste as that was all I had in my fridge and also added some red pepper strips and sliced mini bellas with the asparagus for some extra colour/nutrition.  Left out the cilantro as we don't care for it and served over white basmati rice.  Really flavourful, look forward to the leftovers!!

Used full-fat coconut milk, yellow curry paste, and extra veggies (carrot, zucchini, red pepper) allowing them to simmer in the curry sauce. DELICIOUS!!

Excellent recipe!  I doubled it and used a 4oz. can of Masaman curry paste. I served it over Japanese sweet rice. Husband thought it could have been more spicy so I may experiment with a different curry paste next time but we both loved the flavor.

This was a fabulous combination of seafood, asparagus and tastes! I had asparagus and access to fresh seafood. I made it to the exact quantities with a hot curry paste (more generous on the lime juice). Served wih basmati rice.

uugg..I really wanted to love this one, but the shrimp were just too shrimpy and the sauce wasn't curry enough to replace a restaurant quality version.  I added the peanut butter as suggested, but it didn't help.  I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Praises, praises!! Save me about a good $40 from feeding my family at our favorite Thai spot. Since my family and I enjoy curry I added the curry to taste and regular coconut milk for us-nothing light here. Will definitely make again.

This meal was so tasty and quick to prepare it will definitely be added to my favorites. I kept everything the same but added more curry paste and we were very satisfied.  It's nice to have "grown up" flavors when the kids are away!

Great Recipe! Made this last night exactly as directed served over boiled steamed fried noodles. The next time I make this, I will use twice as much curry paste.  We could only just barely detect it at 1 tablespoon and found ourselves wanting more. 

The shrimp and scallops required keep this dish a little on the pricey side. This recipe will work for me with just the shrimp.
 
Thank you for giving me another great recipe for my "use regularly" file.

I love this recipe.  I always order seafood curry at my local Thai restaurant and this tastes almost exactly like it.

Instead of asparagus, I used green and red peppers as my local restaurant does.

I also increased the lime juice by a tablespoon per 4 servings ( I made 8 servings) and added red pepper flakes and ginger paste in addition to the minced ginger root.

It was delicious and I will definitely be making it again and taking some other liberties with the curry sauce in the future.

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe....for company, used a seafood medley (what I had on hand), omitted 1 tbsp of lime juice (to suit my taste) and used hot curry paste.... oh yeah and the peanut butter recommendation is a must!! Thanks for a great recipe!

We eat and make curry dishes a lot and I thought I would try a new recipe.  I was disappointed with this curry.  I would describe this as an attempt at a Thai curry rather than Indian because of the coconut milk and lime.  I was expecting a more authentic curry and found the lime to be overpowering.  The flavour was OK, but nothing compared to other curry dishes we have tried.  The asparagus also needed to be on a bit longer than the seafood (ours was frozen shrimp and scallops).  I would suggest putting the asparagus in 3-5 minutes sooner than the seafood, especially if you like asparagus tender to the tooth with no crunch.

Yum! But I think I added too much hot curry paste which may have masked the other flavours - I'll try it milder next time.

This recipe is a regular in our house.   I usually omit the scallops and add more shrimp.   Other than that, follow the recipe.  I don't like spicy food, so use Patak's Original Concentrated Mild Curry Paste and it turns out tasty.

I make almost the same recipe but with fewer ingredients.  I use Taste of Thai red curry paste, which has become hard to find.  I use about 3/4 of the packet, which I add with the coconut milk.  If you like less spice, add less.  I also add cut up red pepper and some times snap peas.  I have never used lime or brown sugar since I want it spicy, not sweet and I serve over brown rice or whatever sounds good that day.  I make this all the time and my boyfriend loves it too!

We did not care for this at all - Looked promising but fell short.  Had to add more brown sugar and spices to cut the lime taste.  :(

Tasty but I'll be adjusting. Like others I doubled the curry paste - will triple next time. Definitely needs more lime so I added tbl of lime zest. I used a mix of asparagus, red peppers and mushrooms rather than all asparagus. Also added calamari rings in place of some shrimp. The calamari stood up to the curry really well! 

Hadn't tried the peanut butter yet - will next time.

This turned out delicious! Added extra red curry, instead of peanut butter I added 2 tbsp of peanut satay sauce I had in my pantry. Also added red and yellow bell peppers, scallops and fresh spinach (at the very end) instead of the asparagus (I had none)  overall great! Served over jasmine rice and Kids loved it!!

This was a really tasty dish.  I did make some changes which included using more veggies (sliced red pepper, haricot verts, sliced zucchini and thin sliced carrot), making a slurry of cornstarch and water at the end for some body and a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce for a bit of heat.  Served over basmati rice.

This recipe turned out great. It was very tasty . I left out the sugar as I'm trying to keep that out of my life and I don't believe it affected it at all. I also added more vegetables. I used lobster clams and shrimp  but I wouldn't use lobster again, it was overpowered by the spices. A good non flaky fish would have been better in this. I'd make this again with that one revision.

It was pretty good - made it with vermicelli - next time I will use basmati rice. It was not spicy enough so will add more heat to it again. I did add the peanut butter but may go without it next time. Not as good as the fish curry we had at mama's fish house buy good enough to make again.

Nobody in my family liked it.  You cannot enjoy seafood itself, since curry overpowers all the other ingredients.
Would not make it again.

We didn't have cilantro/lime juice/ asparagus... left them out and used mixed veggies instead.  SOOO YUMMY!!  and it was a very quick meal to prepare as well!  Healthy choice, had the kids coming back for seconds and thirds!!

I guess we just don't dig scallops in our curry; otherwise it would have been good

I didn't have curry paste so I used curry powder and I didn't have scallops so I used 2 lbs shrimp. I omitted the asparagus as I didn't have any and I substituted parsely for cilantro as I do not like it. This turned out very delicious!!!

My husband isn't a fan of curry, but this seemed to have disappeared from his plate.  I omitted the asparagus and added cooked and peeled potatoes and carrots instead.  Very delish.

this came out great! I added some extra shrimp and some mushrooms to the dish and served it over a curry-based coucous. Spicy and delicious!
