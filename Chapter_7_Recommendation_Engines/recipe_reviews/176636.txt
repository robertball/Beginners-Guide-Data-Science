When I saw that the center was still very wet after the alloted time, I turned the oven down 25 degrees and put tinfoil loosely over the top. Turned out beautifully. Next time, I'll try 45 min-1hr at 300 degrees.

Tasted fine but marking down because of misleading cooking time. I made this twice -- 35 minutes the first time (toothpick seemed dry); 45 minutes the second time. Both times I had to throw out the middle section of the cake because it was so wet.

Good, easy recipe,Ihad no sour cream so subbed with milk,doubled lemon peel but think more lemon flavouring would  be good. Baking time in a loaf pan took lot longer.

After reading the other reviews here, I used 1/3 rather than 1/2c sour cream (I actually substituted Greek yogurt because it's what I had in the fridge), and I cooked the dough in a 9x5" loaf pan for 40 minutes.  With these adjustments, I did not end up with any wetness in the center; in fact, the loaf turned out just a little dry.  I made a quick simple syrup flavored with the rest of the juice from the lemon and used it to moisten the loaf again as it cooled (I didn't use the powdered sugar glaze, because I was out of powdered sugar).  In the end, the loaf turned out to have a mild rather than a zesty lemon flavor.

I agree about the baking time.  I have another lemon pound cake recipe that starts out at 350 x 15 min, then the remaining half-hour or so is at 325.  Gonna try that next time.  Otherwise, good.

We love lemon loafs around here.  I'm always searching for the ultimate loaf.  This is a good recipe but not quite perfect. It needs a little more cooking time and extra peel (or a bit of extract) as other reviewers have noted.  I love the addition of the sour cream.

I made this recipe, and it came out perfect as far as the "recipe" goes. Meaning I followed the recipe to a T, the only thing that differed was the baking time. I have a new oven, and I still needed to cook it an additional 5 - 7 minutes. I was expecting more of pound cake or "loaf, when in actuality it is more of a lemon "bread." The flavor was minimal, but the glaze was amazing. Adding more lemon peel to the recipe would be one suggestion. Overall, I was not very pleased with the recipe.

It was very dry and not moist.  Did not change the receipt.  The glaze came out really good though.

The bake time is way understated.  I added an additional 25 minutes to get this to bake all the way.

I followed the recipe exactly, even the tiny details like room temp eggs and only mixing one in at a time. The cake turned out pretty dry for a pound cake, and even tho the frosting was awesome, the cake itself had little to no flavor at all. My kids liked it fine, but I won't be making this again. I was surprised, as I've loved every recipe from this website so far (that I've tried).

Needed to up the baking time by 5-10 minutes, but the toothpick test ensured that I didn't undercook it. Yummy cake!

Also found the baking time to be off, left in the oven for about 50 minutes.  POured sugar lemon glaze over the top when removed from the oven. PRetty good, but not enough lemon flavor for me.

this was a great lemon loaf. that being said I did double the amount of lemon in the loaf and cut the amount of icing sugar in the glaze in half.  it also took closer to 50 minutes to cook
