You can find digestive biscuits in the foreign foods aisle at your local grocery store. I see them every time I go to Wegmans. If you can't find them, graham crackers will suffice.

It was not as chocolaty as I had hoped. It was good but not as rich as anticipated so ended up dipping mine in bittersweet chocolate. that hit the spot

Wow, this recipe sounds great--but what exactly are "digestive biscuits"??
