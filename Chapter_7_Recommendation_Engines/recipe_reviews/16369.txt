Wonderful dip.  I reduced the mayo by half and added an avocado that I had put in the food processor.  It was wonderful and everyone wanted the recipe.

This was fabulous as far as I am concerned. I have never tasted the original green goddess dressing, but I loved this one. Made a simple salad of onions, tomatoes, green bell pepper and avocado and none was left:).
