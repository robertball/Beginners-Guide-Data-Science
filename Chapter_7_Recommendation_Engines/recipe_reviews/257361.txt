I am not vegan or vegetarian.. but my mind has been blown! This was amazing... I did used regular mayo, sliced green onion and chopped pickles instead of dill. But the flavor was tremendous and so much better for you than canned tuna!

I love this recipe. It is easy to make and has a unique delicious flavor. It is a great alternative to tuna fish and a great meal to make ahead and pack for lunch or even a picnic. I eat it in a sandwich or with crackers.

Altered ing a lot as it's easy to do for this. Husband loved tuna sandwiches before veganism. He dislikes chickpeas. Didn't pass for him. Even added his favorite B!tchin' sauce. I used vegan honey mustard for my portion. Delish!

I made it with gluten free bread and you would never know the difference! My guests thought it was the "real thing".
