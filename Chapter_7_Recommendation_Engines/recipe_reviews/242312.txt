I am a huge fan of chef John and love everything that he cooks.  Since he raved about this, and because I love curry I had very high expectations.  But, I found the snap peas didn't meld well with the curry, and the curry wasn't spicy enough (maybe I prefer red curry and coconut milk).  I decided that I would try a similar dish with the cod in a red curry next time.  This is the only Chef John recipe that I haven't given 5 stars.

We liked this a lot. We didn't bother to strain the sauce. It was fine, maybe because the blender we used was fancy. It had texture, but wasn't fibrous. We didn't have strawberries, but the mint really was a good match. I added steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini for some extra veggies.

Holy YUMMMMM!!! This was amazing. So I'll be that typical annoying post that says everything I changed, but honestly it is not intentional it's just what I had on hand. 1) My grocery store only had regular Cod filets (not sure that's a huge deal), so I used that, 2) I never cook with vegetable oil, so I used olive oil, and 3) I don't have a strainer - so my curry was chunky, but absolutely delicious. I wasn't sure how I'd like the strawberries in this, but I think that's the magic that tied it all together for me. A spoonful of everything together - so good! Thank you for an easy, healthy recipe Chef John!
