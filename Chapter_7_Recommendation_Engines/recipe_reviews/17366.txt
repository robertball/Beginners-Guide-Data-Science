The flavor is good, but the nougat part is way too soft and sticky.  Mine were a mess to get out of the pan.  I also used butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips.

These were pretty good-mine turned out a little softer than I was expecting-was hoping for something a little bit chewier.I drizzled some melted chocolate over the top and they tasted a little bit like a Snickers bar(minus the caramel).

This is very tasty--the nougat is better than many nut rolls that I have bought, so I gave it a 5. However, I did have many peanuts left in the bottom of the pan when I cut it. I gently patted some of the nuts into the cut sides to give it more crunch and it really does taste good!

These are great and very easy to make. We called them "Payday Bars" and I have been looking for the recipe. Thanks!
