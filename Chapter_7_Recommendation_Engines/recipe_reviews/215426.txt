These were so easy and tasty! My husband loved them to death, but we both agreed that they could use more green onions; however we are green onion lovers. (Even though I put in 3 of them).  I also used 1/2 the amount of BBQ sauce, because I always thought BBQ is overpowering. And they turned out great. I loved the orange taste too, I don't know what these other people are talking about. Mixing strange ingredients usually taste unique and unlike anything you have ever tasted. That sounds like a winner to me!

Yummy and fast. My family loved these!!! The orange juice concentrate is a great addition to the BBQ sauce. I'd make a double batch next time because they'd make a great lunch too.

I agree that the orange flavor was way too strong. My boyfriend didn't like mixing orange flavor with BBQ flavor either. I had a really hard time getting the crescent triangles to stay together, and the mixture kept leaking out. If I made these again, I wouldn't use the orange juice and I'd use regular dough to make Hot Pocket-type packets. This recipe isn't making my "let's have this again!" list.

Great concept, but the orange was too overpowering.  Will make it again sans the orange juice though.
