I made the recipe making no changes.  I guess I didn't use the sponsers flour.  I have to disagree with Noel, using the bread maker doesn't make this too much of an investment in time.  They turned out fluffy and wonderful.  I will be making this again and again and again.

Making rolls is always an investment in time, and I'd have to say these were totally worth it.

Soft, delicious, with just a hint of sweetness. 
these rolls were a breeze to make and the dough was so easy to work with. I kept all the ingredients the same, but I brushed the rolls with an egg wash and  baked on a parchment lined cookie sheet.

These are light and airy, and really, really good! I made two modifications to the recipe: I used White Lily AP flour instead of wheat, and fast acting yeast.  I don't know if it was the fast acting yeast, or what, but these were so light and fluffy! We had friends for dinner, and everyone raved about them. I formed them into 8 rolls, and they ended up huge like hamburger buns!  So easy to make too! I brushed mine with a beaten egg white before baking, which gave a nice finish. Thank you for the recipe!

So good! with bread machine dough cycle, super easy. Rave reviews from the family. Only change was used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour as I was short on wheat flour. I was a little nervous about the amount of sugar but used the 1/4 cup. Not overly sweet, just right. Buttered tops before baking too. Just yummy! Will save this one for sure!

Okay, I will premise my review by admitting that baking is a challenge for me. I hate the exactness of it, so I like recipes that are simple and donâ€™t involve a lot of steps. I made these rolls exactly as described, except that I used bread flour. The recipe was easy, the dough was heavenly to work with, and the rolls were over the moon!  You can make them a little smaller and easily get 22 or so nice-sized dinner rolls out of this if you are patient and give them a long time to rise. I made 4 batches and they all turned out great! I really could fool people into thinking that I could bake using this recipe!!!!

First time making rolls. Easy and fantastic! Only thing is, it doesn't say to butter the tops with melted butter. I didn't at first and baked them. They were pale. I melted 2 tsp butter and buttered the tops with a brush. baked 5 minutes more. They were a nice golden brown.

Grandkids loved them ! I  I wanted to make an egg wash with just the whites and 1tbsp milk, so I added the yolk in with the bread dough.  The bread was on the yellow side, but kids loved it that way!

Delicious dinner rolls. I used never-bleached all purpose flour and 2 1/4 tsp of bread machine yeast because that's what I had in the cupboard. They have a lovely flavour and texture, and I will definitely make these again. And again.

Thank you, for this recipe. These rolls are amazing. So easy to make, as for the machine doing all the work YAY, I hate kneading and this was the best.

I followed the recipe but used a different brand of flour.  My dough came out of the bread machine way too wet and sticky.  I  tried to knead in some more flour just so I could try to shape into buns.  Not sure if I will make again.
