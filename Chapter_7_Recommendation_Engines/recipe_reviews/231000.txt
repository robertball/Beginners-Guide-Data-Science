Excellent side dish! It's so simple, yet makes a great presentation. I used red skinned potatoes and garlic infused olive oil seasoning it with a bit of kosher salt and black pepper along with the other ingredients. I tossed them once during cooking. It took about 45-50 minutes. They came out crispy and delicious - a perfect accompaniment to any meal!

Fairly common method of preparing roasted potatoes but delicious nonetheless - and the directions work.  However, for best and even browning, turn half way through the cooking time.

I've made these twice now and love this. The first time I used rosemary and the second I used parsley. I also decided to microplane, or grate garlic, and whisk that with the olive oil. I grated the cheese separately and then combined them in one bowl with salt & pepper with the potatoes. That is the way to go with this recipe! If you use rosemary, toss the potatoes at the beginning with it. If you are using a more delicate herb, add the herb much later in the cooking process.

Very tasty and super easy.  I boiled the potatoes for about 10 minutes before baking them to accelerate cooking time.  Baked them for about 20 mins or unti golden.

Great potatoes! ... was a hit for a dinner last week! not to mention it smelled amazing while cooking. I used parchment paper to line my cookie sheet (aka potato pan)and I didn't experience any sticking at all. In fact, I use parchment paper for almost everything when baking, it makes it incredibly easy to clean up and to serve.

Very good, but spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray (a lot of the potatoes stuck to the foil without it) and time the cooking so that you can serve them right out of the oven.  If you have to cover them while waiting for something else to finish, they get soggy.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used parchment paper instead of foil.  The coating was browned and crisp, the potatoes tender and fluffy inside.  I will definitely make this again!

Hands down fast and easy! I used non stick aluminum foil to avoid the potatoes sticking to the cookie sheet. Now, I would suggest to lower the temperature to 405 or 400 degrees as I think 425 is a bit too hot which burns out the potatoes a bit. The first 20 minutes I cooked them at the stated temperature and started noticing that my potatoes were a bit burned so I lowered to 400F for the last 20 minutes of cooking and they were less burned. I also did not slice them that thick I went down to 1/2" medallions and it was great after 40 minutes no more no less!

I have made this before using whipped egg whites folded in using any number of seasonings but not rosemary,will try this tonight. I also use parchment paper and a little spray just for the added crunch the egg whites help with crunchiness too.

Delicious as is, but adding whole peeled Cippolini onions in the mix will push it up another notch. Try using 1 lb. of onions with the potatoes. You can also make this ahead of time ( as much as a day ), and reheat it for about 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees.

Delicious. The Rosemary has a great, powerful flavor that is not too much. I added a little more Parmesan after I stirred halfway through and I baked them for about five minutes over the recipe's time. Very good.

Yum!  I think I may have made these a long time ago, but since I didn't add a photo or review, perhaps I'm making that up.  However, this is incredibly easy and very tasty.  The potatoes stick a bit, even with the olive oil and the foil, but are relatively easy to get off the foil--except for stirring halfway through.  All that being said, though, they turn out very flavorful and crispy.  I love both, and the ease of cooking them.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit!
I doubled the amount of potatoes, used a lot of fresh rosemary, parmesan and olive oil. After I put sliced potatoes in pan,salted and added more parmesan on top. Did not flip during baking. Came out great.

These potatoes had a wonderful flavor!  I sped-up the cooking by first microwaving my potatoes till cooked, and then just crisped the coating on them cooking for only 15 minutes at 425.  My guys devoured them!!

Pretty easy meal. A very tasty meal with such a nice aroma. I let my potatoes crisp a little more in the oven to give a nice crunchy coating.

I love roasted potatoes, but I'd never combined these ingredients without others as well- nice, simple taste, not too much prep work so great weeknight dish!  Thanks for sharing :)

Great as-is, but you can hurry the baking along by first microwaving the whole potatoes early in the day for a few minutes, cooling them and slicing. They cook much faster at dinnertime, browning in about 15-20 min. Really great!

This was delicious.  I used peeled baking potatoes and they worked out great.  Used the convection feature of my oven so it didn't take as long to cook them.  -Susie

Loved it.  The second time I made it I mixed it in a plastic bag rather than a bowl, and it covered more evenly and easily.

I do about the same thing, I use red potatos and sweet potatos.  I usually leave the skin on and slice into rounds, keep the thickness  down to around 1/4 ".  Easier to bake.  You can use what ever seasoning you want, just complement the rest of the meal.  Don't  bother with a bowl, use a large
 zip-lock bag and just shake the coat.  I keep them on one side long enough to get it crispy then filp them over.  I usually  slice a bunch of potatoes up at once a bag them for the freezer, just pull out what you need.  I do most of my vegies that way, since there is only two of use it cuts down on spoilage.

I would suggest to use a glass baking dish over foil. Much cleaner and helps with the cheese melting!

Very good.  Very simple.  Add more rosemary.  Spray aluminum foil to avoid potatoes sticking.

This is an incredible side dish. It presents well and the taste is out of this world. The crunch on the outside combined with the piping hot inner flesh of the potato is a particularly pleasing sensation. I doubled the recipe and my son loved it. I did not make any changes. But since I expect this recipe to become a staple at my home, down the road I may consider adding a dash of red pepper or red pepper flakes. The recipe also has the benefit of being a low-fat choice, which is a nice bonus.

Have made a couple of times & taken others suggestion of adding garlic or microwaving potatoes first. I didn't have fresh rosemary so took 1/2 tsp & ground it up in my grinder.  You can bakes these or pan fry it is versatile.

My only changes were halving the recipe, adding garlic powder and using dried as opposed to fresh rosemary. These are the perfect accompaniment to my slow cooked balsamic pork roast. Delicious!

These were wonderful. Mine did stick to aluminum foil so removed foil halfway through. Did lose some of the potato skin but they still came out crisp and delicious. I will never make frozen fries again.

This was delicious.  I didn't make any changes to this scrumptious side dish, when I used red baby potatoes.  Maybe I should try the plastic bag suggestion featured in AR magazine.  I have enough for leftovers  and would make it again. Two thumbs up!

Made these and they are very tasty!  Be sure to spray the foil with Pam or something like that.  This is from experience. They stick really bad if you don’t.

These turned out to be so delicious! Fragrant, crispy on the outside, soft & puffy on the inside! I served them with nice filets, sautéed thyme-scented mushrooms, and of course a big red Zin! 

As others have suggested, here are the alterations I made: Line the baking sheet with parchment, not foil. I used white potatoes. For the 3 T of EVOO, I used 1/2 Garlic-scented oil, and 1/2 EVOO. I did use FRESH rosemary from my garden. I used good quality parmesan. And I flipped them 1/2 way through the roasting process. YUM!

This is a tremendous dish:  Easy ... delicious ... What more could you ask for?  I only had russet potatoes on hand, so I that's what I used - but I think the new potatoes would have been slightly better.  I used the good old-fashioned Kraft cheese-in-a-jar for the coating, then topped the potatoes with real fresh grated cheese for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The only other change I made was to sprinkle some granulated garlic over the potatoes when I turned them after 20 minutes. I can't help it - I'm a garlic fiend!

I used garlic and not rosemary, because I didn't have any. Turned out ok, except I think the cheese should be added about 10 minutes before done baking. Most the cheese ended up sticking to the foil.

Just made this for the 4th of July and doubled the recipe.  I cut the potatoes on the thin side and added extra rosemary and cheese.  Since I only wanted to use 2 pans in the oven, some of the potatoes were stacked on others. After baking them as directed & realizing some were not fully cooked, I put all of them in a casserole dish and baked at either 325 or 350 degrees for about 45 more minutes and they were a delicious and were enjoyed by everyone.

This is a baseline, standard, can't fail great way to fix quartered or sliced potatoes. New or Red potatoes work best in this kind of application. It doesn't work so well with a baking potato. Look up waxy vs mealy spuds to learn the difference.

Great potatoes! Won't bother with rosemary next time though. Will use Parmesan and some steak seasoning. Will make again!!

I used fresh basil, because I had some, and I went a little crazy with the Parmesan cheese, but these were terrific! I sliced the potatoes VERY thin, and they were wonderfully crispy. I will make this again very soon!
