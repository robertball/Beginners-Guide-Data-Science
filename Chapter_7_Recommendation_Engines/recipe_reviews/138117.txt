Of course I had to try this one - as my daughter submitted it!  Nice, easy family meal.  I did add about 1/2 cup of dry red wine.  Good recipe, honey.

This dish was fantastic! This was my first time having gnocchi. It is great! Not adding the sugar was my only change. Also, A little goes a long way. I looked at the little dish of gnocchi (1 lb) and thought "There's no way this is feeding 3 adults!". It did! - with leftovers! Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Huge hit at our house! I made homemade gnocchi for this and changed the sauce up slightly. I used a can of chopped tomatoes, a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato paste and also used ground sausage instead. I am sure my husband will be requesting this over and over again!

There’s nothing wrong with this recipe at all except that it needs to be personalized, as all recipes should be, to suit one’s own tastes.  In my case, the “personal touches” included using my own tomato sauce I put up from my garden and, only because fresh herbs are happily in my garden right now, using just a little (not too much!) fresh basil, parsley, and the slightest bit of oregano.  I needed no water and no sugar.  For a little more substantial dinner I sautéed multi-colored bell peppers and mushrooms in addition to the onion and garlic.  Oh…and as I always do when I cook, I sipped some wine – in this case an appropriate Montepulciano d’Abruzzo.  As I was simmering all the ingredients together (including the sausage), I mindlessly tossed in half of my glass of wine into the pot, which I promptly refilled.  As for the cheese, just as my grandmother and mother did, I used a blend of imported Pecorino-Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Hubs was out of town tonight so I got to make whatever I felt for and this hit the spot.

This was just okay.  I did NOT add the 1 Tblsp. of the italian seasoning, and we still thought the seasonings were too overpowering (just using the 1-1/2 tsp.)  I made homemade gnocchi, and after I had topped it with this sauce, I wished I had just taken some of my homemade tomato sauce out of the freezer and just used that with some fresh basil.  My husband is from Italy, and they don't use a lot of dried seasonings over there.  They try to keep things fresh and simple.  Sorry - but I probably won't be making this one again.

loved this recipe. I doubled the crushed tomatoes though.  Otherwise there would not have been much sauce.

Super easy recipe to throw together, and yummy!  My husband says it's the best Italian dish I've ever made (his Grandma was Italian, so I'm up against that!).  The only real change I made was using turkey sausage instead of regular.  I did think the dish was a bit salty, so I probably won't add salt to the sauce next time since the rest of the ingredients are high in sodium...

Magnificant!! Bravo! This is a rich and tongue tantalizing italian recipe that I will use again and again. I have made this several times since finding it and when I am in the mood for extra spice, I add only about 4, 1/4 inch slices of marinated jalapeno peppers and mix it up with pepperoni slices instead of italian sausage. Either way...if you are an italian food fan...you will love this!! I do! Thanks!

Cooked this dish with whole wheat potato Gnocchi. EXCELLENT! Drizzled extra virgin olive oil over the top. I dont recommend using fresh gnocchi as the consistency and texture are a little off to me.

I knew by looking at the ingredients that I would love this recipe, and boy was I right! As with all red sauces I make, I never measure.  I just throw some stuff, taste, repeat until good.  Red wine and red pepper flakes were two additions I made.  Since gnocchi is pretty bland as is, it can handle a zesty sauce.  I used turkey sausage and threw in some fresh spinach that needed to be used up.  Pure Italian comfort food.  Thanks for sharing, we really enjoyed it!

YUM!  Made this for dinner tonight and thankful to have leftovers.  I changed it up a bit and added chopped red peppers with the onions, used 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce and 1 small can tomato paste and brown sugar instead of the white.  This is a keeper!

This recipe was good overall! I will just take the advice of the reviews and not add the total amount of Italian seasoning. I thought the Italian seasoning was a little overwhelming. That would be my only change I would make and I will be making this again soon!

Let me tell you, this was a joy to make and it was very tasty...my husband loved it and kept walking in the kitchen with his nose in the air!  I added a  little splash of whistishire(spelled wrong) and finely chopped green pepper and splenda (1 pk) inplace of regular sugar and it had just enough zing to it was great...very much a keeper!

Really enjoyed this recipe. It was the first time I cooked nocci and it was really tasty! I used ground italian sausage and served it with cooked corn which went really well with it. I also added a fresh tomato diced. Wonderful recipe!

Turns out my gnocchi expired, so I had to use pasta instad. I'm basing this vote on the sauce, since basically that is the recipe. The hubby and kids loved it and they all had seconds.

I thought this was great, I can't wait to make it again. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and I'm glad I did, it was still pretty thick. I used mild Italian sausage to please my picky 5 year old but I think it would be great with spicy. Everything else in the recipe I did as planned and it was delicious!

I was going to serve some Italian turkey sausage with a side of gnocchi - both leftovers from last week.  I was looking for a recipe for the gnocchi when I found one for both.  I had everything on-hand except for the canned tomatoes, but I subbed tomato soup, and it turned out great!  This is an excellent recipe to use up last weeks groceries or for when you have a lot of company - it's so easy to make.

I used homemade turkey Italian sausage instead of the standard kind and it worked well. I wish there was a little more of the tomato sauce, next time I might make a little more of that.  Also, this made 3 pans dirty, next time I will cook the sausage in one pan, then cook the sauce right in that same pan with the sausage.  The gnocchi I would still cook separately of course.

I just made this for Sunday dinner and it was excellent.  My whole family, including a youngster, enjoyed it!  It made about 6 servings instead of the 4 listed.

This was good!  I used browned ground suasage instead of links.  I also had no crushed tomatoes so I added 2 - 14oz cans of diced Italian tomatoes.  I had more sauce than gnocchi.  It would have been perfect with 1 1/2 pounds of gnocchi!  I will make again!

The first dish I have cooked for my brother and his family and my family that everyone really liked!  Thank you!  I used and broke up sausage patties because I don't care for casings.  I used dried basil and orgeano because I was out of Italian Seasoning(but that's probably what's in there anyway right?) Can't wait for the leftovers :)

I have had a store-bought package of Gnocchi in my pantry for nearly a year, I got bored today and decided to look for a Gnocchi recipe online. This recipe was so simple that I wasn't expecting much more than edible and a good use of this stuff taking up my shelf space...but OH MY GOODNESS it was delicious. I paired it with an Italian salad and we loved it. The best part was that I already had every ingredient, Big Thanks to the Rossi's!!!

Good, easy meal.  Nothing out of this world, but very tasty!  We used turkey sausage because that is all we had - the italian sausage probably would have been better.  Other than that, followed the recipe and it came out great!  will make again.

This was delicious; so simple and sweet. I used sweet Italian sausage and it was fabulous. Also, having home made gnocchi before, it is quite time consuming. By using the pre-made packaged kind, you get all the deliciousness with a fraction of the work, I would absolutely recommend making this recipe.

Sorry, not a 5 star recipe.  The sauce had an aftertaste and was too thick.  I did use hot sausage which was a nice way to spice it up.

The gnocchi in this one kind of killed it for me - the sausage is enough by itself and the gnocchi kind of overpowers the dish.  I think if I make this again I will substitute penne for the gnocchi.

I made my own gnocchi to go with this and used hot italian sausage to kick it up a little bit.  Very good - thanks for sharing!

I really love this sauce.  The first time I made it with gnocchi and loved it.  2nd time I didn't have gnocchi and used pasta.   Also excellent!

This was nice. Unfortunately I can only get pre-made potato gnocchi where I am and I don't know how to make gnocchi myself, so had to use potato gnocchi for this recipe. I think it would have been better with the ricotta gnocchi as written in the recipe. Regardless it was still tasty and my whole family enjoyed it, including the 14mo. I did a combination of chorizo and Italian sausages to add a little heat and also eliminated the extra salt as the Italian seasoning has plenty. Has great potential to mix this up according to family tastes and create a 5 star dish. Will be making again.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this dish was.  I've had mediocre experiences with gnocchi in the past but I wanted to try it at home.  I used feta and spinach turkey sausage, and I threw some diced red pepper into the sauce.  Other than that I followed this recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  My whole family loved it and we'll definitely make it again.

This was amazing! I only had hot Italian sausage and it still tasted amazing if you like spicy, we like spicy. My husband said this was better than anything he's ever eaten at a restaurant, and I have to agree. The cold leftovers even tasted great the next day. Such a super easy recipe, with authentic pure flavor..

Absolutely loved this recipe! Make sure not to over-cook the gnocchi and definitely add the dry red wine.

I made this using smoked sausage (all I had) and my own frozen tomato sauce.  It was excellent.  I did add some tomato juice towards the end because the gnocchi sucked up a lot of sauce.

I just love this recipe--though I will warn everyone it is RICH.  But so good!   I follow this recipe exactly, and have made it 3 times now--and it never looks like the pic in the recipe, which would require a LOT more sauce! Hmmm....at any rate, it comes out just fine, though I can't figure out that pic

Excellent flavor! I did tweak it to reduce the sodium by using  no salt added tomato sauce rather than spaghetti sauce. I cooked 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 onion sliced, 1/2 green pepper sliced, then added Italian sausage and cooked till pink color gone; drained grease then added handful fresh spinach, 1 cup frozen peas from my garden, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp.dried basil, 1/2 tsp sugar; stirred, then added 3- 8oz. cans no salt added tomato sauce, the cooked gnocchi, and the cheese; simmered a few minutes, poured into baking dish, sprinkled rest of cheese and baked 20 minutes till cheese melted and golden. It was so yummy and good for my husband's reduced sodium diet.

This was very easy (I had precooked chicken & asiago cheese sausages from Sam's). But it wasn't exciting. It was just good. Probably not good enough for a normal menu rotation. I have 4 little kids and they all ate well. I doubled the recipe (there's 7 eaters if  you count Gramma). We had enough leftovers for 2 lunches hubby can take to work. I didn't quite put the full Tablespoon of italian seasoning in, after reading reviews. I'm glad I didn't. I probably used 1 2/3 (remember I doubled). It was too much. Probably because its a dry seasoning. If you're using fresh herbs, I think it'd be fine (using 1/3 of whats called for if you use fresh). The dry herbs just don't have enough time in 20 minutes to get tender.

Very tasty and quick. I used chicken sausage and added some sweet red pepper to the onion sauté. I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used one can diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato sauce and about two tbsp paste. I added the sausage after the sauce was done since it was already cooked. The fam gave this a hearty thumbs up!

I love this recipe!  I used 28 oz of crushed tomatoes instead 14 but only because I remembered the recipe wrong.  I didn't realize I bought the wrong size until I was about to add it.  Needless to say,  it was wonderful.  My daughter literally licked the bowl clean.  Thanks for a great recipe!  :-)

Loved this! The only changes I made were using brown sugar instead of white... And I did use more than one teaspoon because I love a sweet tomato sauce! Also, instead of Italian seasoning I used fresh basil and fresh oregano. This recipe was pretty easy and it's definitely going in my book of favorites. Thank you!

This was good but I wish I had made the gnocchi as well but it was pretty good. May try it one more time.
