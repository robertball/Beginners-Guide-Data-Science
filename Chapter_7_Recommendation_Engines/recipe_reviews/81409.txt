This was delicious and took almost no effort.  I used frozen chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.

Wonderful and easy! Loved this chicken! I actually slow cooked it all day, so it was falling off the bone tender and flavourful. During the last hour I added sliced apples and a sprinkle of brown sugar. Delicious! Me and guests loved it. I would try this recipie with pork as well. Thank you!

Can I rate this if I used pork?  It was great!  I seared the pork chops before baking and only had 1.5 lbs., so there was extra sauce to serve with rice.  The only thing I'd eliminate would be the salt.  I don't think it's needed with the mustard.  Otherwise, this is definitely a "keeper".  Maybe sometime I'll try it with chicken.

Great recipe and blending of flavors. I have tried this one a few times and experimented a few times. I agree that this one was intended for pork. I like this little add on I used - 2 T. good bourbon and 1 T finely minced pecans along with a pinch of high quality cayenne pepper. Also, I sub'd a T of honey for one of the T's of molasses. You can't go wrong with the original recipe and this one is fun to play with and find new possibilities.

Made this for dinner last night, it was very good and flavorful.  I just used boneless, skinless chicken breast and it turned out wonderful.  Husband loved it!

I made it with drumsticks because that's what I had...turned out well! I did make more of the sauce and eased up on the cinnamon...a hit at our house though!

Perfect chicken.  I ended up buying an already cut up whole chicken as it was the same price as the whole and it was about 5 lbs.  I roasted it like the recipe says for 30 minutes then I basted the chicken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.  You wouldn't believe the beautiful color, the moist chicken and it registered 180 on the dot after resting for five minutes!  This is a keeper!

Yum , yum and yum- I used bone in chicken breasts and threw it all in the crock pot. I removed the chicken skin first and rubbed on the dry rub then poured the wet stuff down over. Oh my gosh good ! Thanks for a quick and easy recipe

This is sort of a strange flavour. Yes the recipe was easy and the chicken turned out very tender, but we weren't big fans of the sweet taste. I added cayenne and cajun seasoning to spice it up but the cinnamon was overwhelming. Thanks for posting - always happy to try something unique even if it doesn't become a regular.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked in the crock pot for about 8 hours.  After 4 hours, I added 3 think sliced peeled apples and a sprinkling of chopped walnuts. As someone else mentioned, I added 1 extra T of molasses.   LOVED THE APPLES & NUTS in the sauce!  the sauce was great -but my chicken was a little dry...next time I'm going to try following the recipe and cooking it in the oven.

This was just so-so. Definitely easy, and the chicken was moist, but the flavors weren't a hit with out family. Won't be repeated.

The chicken cooked through but it really didn't taste very good.  I won't make again.  Very disappointing.

This was a real hit with everyone young and old, and easy to make.  I found the sauce great on potatoes.  I used olive oil to grease the baking dish, and boneless skinless chicken breast, so it was low in saturated fats.  I will definitely make this scaled up in portions for crowd next time we have family.

VERY GOOD! VERY EASY!! Was very surprised about the cinnamon flavor. I did add a little ginger to the spice mixture, and used drumsticks. My family loved it, I WILL make this again.

Wow.  This was really good.  Super juicy chicken!  I did however, use boneless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I also wanted to make this into a meal, so I added sliced potatoes and sliced apples to the dish and baked with the chicken.  I also made about twice as much sauce so that it covered all my chicken, apples, and potatoes.  A very yummy fall meal.

I doubled the ingredients except I only used 1/2 t. cinnamon as I didn't want it to taste too cinnamon-y and used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  It was good but did remind me of French Toast (I put molasses and cinnamon on my French Toast.)  It was better leftover.  I would give it 3 stars for taste and 5 stars for moistness of the chicken.

I made using chicken breasts and although the taste was interesting, I doubt I will make it again. Baked Chicken Teriyaki is much better.

This was so easy and a nice way to use up some molasses.  I thought the ratio of molasses to Dijon made the Dijon a bit too strong.  Ended up adding more Molasses and liked the end result.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe!!  We've literally been eating it one night a week for the last few months.  It's so easy and tasty and fits into our organic lifestyle because it doesn't require a bunch of super processed ingredients.

I prepared this recipe as written. I liked how the chicken looked when it was done baking--the sauce stayed on the chicken and coated it nicely. However, the main thing that we could taste was vinegar. My husband came in the house while it was cooking and could smell vinegar. Maybe this would be better using chicken broth instead of the vinegar?

I was looking for a new type of sauce for bake chicken. I checked Yummly and found my answer. The chicken came out great and my family loved it.

This was very good even though I didn't have any Dijon mustard and used regular. Next time I will add a bit more salt.  The photo for this recipe looks very dark. Mine was nice and brown, but nothing like this photo. I think this would also be good for the grill and a good mix to put over pork chops.

I made this chicken last night for dinner - my husband and thought it was fantastic!  I used 4 chicken thighs with the skin on.  I followed the recipe as written (but used grainy Dijon mustard) and when it was time to add the sauce, I used a turkey baster and slid some of the sauce under the skin of each thigh. Of course we didn't eat the skin but it really kept the chicken juicy and flavorful.

Following the advice of other reviews, I tried this on boneless pork chops first and it was really good.  The leftover sauce in the baking dish was excellent served with the sliced chops.  Even good cold the next day!

Too strong for us. My husband and kids took one bite, scraped off the topping, and only then ate the chicken.

I used extra firm tofu with this and it turned out pretty good. I cut the tofu into 1/4" thick slices & followed instructions except that I only baked the tofu for 30 minutes total.

We are still undecided about this recipe. The taste is good but the sauce around it has been staying soupy. It gets a nice crust only on the tip-top of the chicken. I will try it again and maybe give a quick broil at the end to make it a bit more crispy!!

This was very easy and tasty, produced an impressive brown glaze with an exotic flavour. I made it simpler by not cutting the whole chicken into pieces, just cutting it down the breastbone and flattening it out in my dish 'butterfly' style. I mixed all the ingredients to be added in a jar and poured them straight on, brushing the sauce over the chicken a couple of times whilst cooking. I also took the advice of another reviewer and exchanged 1 Tbsp of molasses for honey. Took only a few minutes to prepare and my family were very impressed with the appearance and taste!
