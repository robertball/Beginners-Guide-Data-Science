This recipe was really very good - it made for a great appetizer. The stuffing is a little too "cream-cheesy" (and we used light cream cheese, too). It might work better with a little less.

I used this recipe as an appetizer for my cafe and it was a huge success! Everyone ate them and raved about how delicious they were.  To help the mushrooms from becoming shriveled or dried out, I sauteed them first in butter, but you can also brush the sides with butter while they are baking.  Huge crowd pleaser, very easy to make and simply delicious!

This was a great recipe!  It was so easy to prepare, yet so tasty!  I did substitute a mozzarella cheese for the cheddar, but they turned out great!

This recipe was great. Everyone thought they tasted gourmet. I used a little extra crackers and less cream cheese to taste but they were wonderful!

EASY! I used bacon bits in place of the cracker crumbs to reduce carbs and low fat cream cheese.

We loved these. I made them as an appy for our Thanksgiving dinner. I did have to make a substitution out of necessity - I couldn't find bacon flavored crackers anywhere. I used herb crackers (Sociables) and added some diced bacon to get the bacon flavor. I made these the night before and refrigerated, then added the cheddar cheese right before putting them in the oven. They did take longer to bake, but I believe this is due to being refrigerated. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

My family LOVED these.  Since I too could not find bacon flavored crackers, I used low fat herb crakers and ground them up with bacon bits.  I also added jalepenos, fat free cream cheese, and some gound pepper and garlic seasoning.  We will be making these again.  I would suggest cooking these for about 15-20 minutes as I had some mix left over and baked it seperately and the result was much more solid....didn't fall apart.

I used 24-26 medium sized mushrooms.  I washed the mushrooms in water, removed the stems and set aside on tea towel to dry.  Chopped stems and sauteed with green onion.  Mixed stem mixture with 1 can of shrimp, about 2 tbsp of cream cheese, half a cup of Tex Mex shredded cheese and stuffed the mushrooms.  Then I chrushed about a 10-12 bacon crackers (Bacon Dippers by Christie) and sprinkled on top of each mushroom.  Baked as directed.  Delicious!!  My whole family were amazed by them (except the two who won't eat mushrooms)!

We couldn't find bacon cracks so substituted Asiago Cheese and Roasted Vegetable crackers.  I used little squares of cheddar cheese on top to keep it in place better instead of shredded.  These are wonderful

I used lobster meat and bacon bits instead of the flavored crackers. Regular Ritz makes it best!  So Yummy my family loves them!

This appetizer is pretty tasty! I used lite cream cheese, baby shrimp, mixed in bacon bits ( I couldnt find bacon flavored crackers anywhere!), and the cheddar cheese. I melted them a little bit in the microwave to make it creamy. I left out the stems, seemed kind of weird to have them in the mix. Good stuff!

I followed the directions and used fresh shrimp, bacon, bella mushrooms. My family tries everything I make them and they all voted this is the WORST recipe I have ever made.  Done with mushrooms for awhile.

WOW! This was perfect! It got "Little bites of Heaven!" reviews from the family and I have a feeling I will be making it more often. Like most I used what was on hand in my pantry, a couple of tablespoons less cream cheese and Hormel real bacon bits with Town House crackers, cut up full size shrimp.  I did not use the mushroom stems, instead I sliced off a thin slice of the open end of each mushroom and chopped the slices up to go in the mixture. The benefit was, a more tender  mushroom filling and it opened up the mushroom for more stuffing! Love it!

Initially, I thought the servings would be too great -- but it went over so well, there were only 8 left uneaten.   Needless to say it was a huge success!  I bought mushrooms already packed in a carton - so some were small; but it was easier than handpicking 45-48 individuals.  I will definitely be making this again!  Best of all it's soooo easy!

Followed the directions exactly except I didn't have bacon flavored crackers. I used 1 c. Ritz and real bacon pieces.  I used ginormous mushrooms, the mix filled 10, which I brushed with Olive oil first. I think there's too much cream cheese (and I even left out 2 T). The flavor of the shrimp didn't come through, so if I did make these again, I think I'd use chicken next time and maybe more bacon. ..but I'll probably just try other recipes.

Try swapping in Jalapano cream cheese for a nice little kick! It's a great paring with the shrimp and cheddar!

Delish favor! The Chicken in a Bisquit crackers seal the deal for me. Really can't make ahead of time though. They get all watery and deflate.
