(without alcohol)- kids love the sweet taste
(alcohol added) - adults liked it but thought it was a little too sweet.  Make sure everything is cold when it is prepared.  If anything is added that is warm, it makes the whole punch warm.  Chill rum before adding to punch.

This is excellent! I served this at a Halloween party tonight and everyone kept telling me how much they loved it. Not too sweet, not too much alcohol, just right! I will definitely make this again.

Nice change.  I served this at a St. Patty's Day luncheon. I was unsure of the sherbet/rum combination but turned out kinda sweet and sour. Very good.  Makes a lot. I would suggest making 1/2 of the recipe and making the other half if needed.

I made this as a non-alcoholic punch for a carry in and I think it really requires the rum.  It was so tart that not many people seemed to like it.  I will definitely make this again but WITH rum!

This is a great drink.  I made it for a Halloween party and it was a hit.  After reading others' reviews, I decided to double the rum, which was a really good idea because 750 mL isn't enough (at least for a bunch of college students)

A Super HIT with my guests.  Have already shared the recipe with 2 guests.  Would recommend to add 1 litre of Rum instead of just 750 ml.

I served this punch Halloween 2005.  I doubled the recipe and it still went extremely fast.  It's delicious and my guests are still talking about it and have demanded that I make it again for Halloween. Plus, it was real easy to make.

This was awesome.  The full batch would make 2 gallons (before alcohol).  I made this for our whole family and just added alcohol for the adults into their individual glasses.  I cut the amounts down to 1/4 (so 1/2 each lemonade/limeade container) and that made a 2qt container.  

Tangy and sweet, just the right flavor.  Coconut rum made this superb!

We loved this recipe.  We used Lemon Citron Vodka instead of the rum and it was a big hit.  For Thanksgiving, I changed the frozen limeade to 2 cans frozen Cranberry Juice.  Instead of the Lime Sherbet, I used Berry, Berry Sherbet and I also switched out the Lemon-Lime soda for 2 2-litter bottles of Squirt and finally, I used 2 bottles of Lemon Citron Vodka.  It is so great, everyone will love it....

This is very good but very sweet.  Cut recipe in 1/2 and it filled 2 pitchers.  Loved the tip to add Malibu Rum...the coconut and lime is a great combo.  The sherbert and zprite make it nice and frothy.  I added florescent green dye to add to the already potion like quality of this fun drink.  Kids loved it!  Will try again with just lemonade or maybe diet pop as it was a bit too sweet for my liking.

Pretty tasty. :) Served at a Halloween. Left the alcohol out so the kids could have some. The adults just added rum & vodka to their taste. Would recommend serving over ice, to keep it chilled and to water it down a little bit. The citrus flavor is pretty strong. I also added some green food coloring for effect. Made in 1/4 recipe batches

I've been making this for several years now for Halloween, calling it Ghoul-ade, and it always disappears. I typically use Ginger Ale instead of the soda to cut the sweetness and add a little vodka in addition to the rum.

For my party, I cut this recipe in half.  I was serving three other types of beverages.  Apparently, I should have tripled this recipe.  Absolutely delicious!!!

Very tasty! I made this for a Halloween party with coconut rum and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, it is VERY sweet and I got a stomach ache after one glass. Next time I might dilute it with some water. Still yummy though!

I have mixed feelings on this beverage.  I agree with what others wrote that it is super sweet, yet also a bit sour from the lemonade/limeade.  Over ice, it reminded me of a margarita a little bit.  But because it is so super sweet, I can't see most adults drinking more than one of these.  That said, leave the rum out of the punch and this would be perfect for little kids.  Thanks for sharing a cool drink recipe - especially for Halloween or St. Patrick's Day.

Very good, I left out the rum since there were kids there and it was still a big hit.  Make sure to use a citrus sherbert!  We were running out so asked some friends if they could pick up some more ingredients on their way but didn't specify flavors.  They brought raspberry sherbert and the second batch did not taste very good.

Fabulous! Used lemon sherbet instead since that's what I found at the store, but it was still frothy and halloween-y. I also substituted lemon-lime flavored seltzer water so I wouldn't be too sweet. Everyone loved it!

Easy & delicious.  We didn't make enough for our Halloween party and had to run out for more supplies.  The kids loved it and the adults added rhum or tequila for a delicious cocktail.  The frothy green look was also great for Halloween in the punch bowl.

This was the best drink I have ever had I will make this again for sure the only thing I did different was no alcohol in this (Because I have kids) I also added more 7 up so it was not so sour but I loved it so much Everyone at the house loved it so much I also put lemons in it to make it sour enough for it to have a sour and sweet taste.I love this I think it was the best summer drink I have ever had in my hole life.

Delicious! Will send you into a diabetic coma it is so sweet. Is more of a dessert drink b/c of all the sugar.  I reccomend using diet soda and sugar free juice. Substituting pineapple concentrate for lemonade is delicious. If you're big drinker, you'll need more rum...can't taste it at all.

I served this at a Halloween party in a black cauldron and everyone raved about it.  It's not too sweet, not too sour, and the alchol flavor is masked well.  It's very yummy. I also used fat free sherbet and diet 7up, so it was a little lighter than usual.  I will definitely make this one again!

This punch was absolutely delicious  I used lemon/lime Rum and refrigerated it along with the 7up.  The punch was the hit of the party.  Great for Christmas or anytime.

I made this stuff for my 21st birthday/Halloween party and, despite going through some improv alterations, it was sooo good! I halved the recipe and used pineapple sherbet in place of lime and lemon-lime seltzer water when I meant to grab soda, and someone added a bunch of coconut vodka in addition to the rum.  We made it in a big plastic cauldron with a hunk of dry ice, which turned it into a smoking slushy drink! Deliciously tangy, not too sweet or sour -- by far the best drink I've made.

pretty good stuff. I made half with rum and half without for my "green" new years party. Both were gone before midnight! I think the rum really added something to it. It's a bit sweet for drinking all the time, but great for parties!

This is a fantastic punch, it has a very nice sweet and sour combo going on.  I made this last night for halloween, but I divided the recipe in half and made one with rum and one without.  Both were completely gone by the end of the evening.  Be warned, the one with rum didn't really taste like it had any rum in it!

This was an excellent cocktail! We halved this recipe and it was a big hit! One person with us is pregnant and so couldn't have the rum, so we separated hers out from ours and she liked it as well. We did not measure the rum, we just started adding and stopped when we thought we had the proper amount. :) Also, we waited until St. Patrick's Day to go shopping, so there was no lime sherbet left by the time time we got there. We used rainbow sherbet and still loved this. It did turn a strange color, but I still went to bed feeling very happy! Affordable, easy, and delicious!

Made this for my halloween party and it was a total hit! I didn't have any lemon-lime carbonated beverage, but I did have some cranberry sierra mist so I used that instead. Ended up being pink, so people were really confused, but it still came out amazing and people drank it all up! I used Coconut Parrot Bay for the rum, it went great with the lime flavor! I can't wait to try this again, by sticking closer to the recipe. It's a keeper!

It was quite tasty. I definitely agree with the reviews that have you nearly double the amount of rum to cut the tartness. It almost reminded me of a margarita.

This was so easy to make and perfect for our annual Halloween party. I froze pink lemonade in a spider-shaped tray and served it in a witches cauldron with the pink spider in the green punch.  Delicious! I did use diet lemon-lime beverage and this did not detract from the flavor. Fair warning: the alcohol is not noticeable in this!

I made this last night for Bunko and it was a huge hit! I had a St. Patty's Day theme so I renamed it the "manky leprechaun!"  It is very dangerous so go slow. One thing I did change......I didn't have plain rum on hand so I used Coconut flavored rum and it was DELICIOUS!  Something about the lime and the coconut together, mmmmmm!  It's now one of my favorite drinks.  Not too sweet.

Holy cow! This was amazingly good. It was absolutely devoured (can you devour a beverage?) at my Halloween party. I made the recipe half at a time (as that was all that would fit into my punch bowl), but a big plus of this is that's very easy to halve. I added some lemoncello for an extra lemony kick and it was delicious. I wish I had more opportunities to make this!

This was good, but I couldn't handle more than a cup of it. Not because of the alcohol - because of the sugar. Yikes!

This was great for our Halloween party. We added some gummy worms to add to the creepy Halloween feel, and they tasted great in it too. We also put some dry ice in it and it stayed cold the whole evening, plus there was some nice fog creeping out of it in the beginning. We also doubled the rum as someone else suggested, it kept it from being too sweet.

Were doing a modified version of it for a birthday party this weekend, exchanging half the limeade for more lemonade and the lime sherbert for lemon, more of an alcoholic lemonade with the sherbert on top.

You really cant taste the alcohol in it, so keep that in mind.

Made this & liked it!  We made it for St. Patricks Day to add a "fun" green drink.  We made it in a punch bowl and served it on martini glasses.  It was cute....but could also see making this on a hot summer day!

Everyone at my party really seemed to like this.  I didn't add the rum as I had a number of guests who don't drink, but did have a bottle of Malibu rum available for those that wanted to add it.  It might have been better with the rum.  I found it tasted fine, but very sweet.  By the end of the bowl the flavours seemed to have intensified and were quite strong.

This punch is amazing. I made it for my 21st Birthday/ Halloween party and it was a huge success. I made the full batch in a cauldron and between 9 people, it lasted maybe an hour. It was so good people kept going back for more! Next time I'll know to bring enough supplies to make two batches. I deviated from the instructions by using a full liter of rum instead of 750mL, and I added about a hand full of fresh, sliced, squeezed limes (which if you ask me completely made the punch). I will surely use this recipe again!

I made this for a Halloween party in a plastic witches cauldron.  It looked wonderful and it tasted even better.  This is a dangerous drink though.  You couldn't taste the rum so the alcohol really snuck up on those of us drinking it.  Next Halloween it is coming out again.  This is too good not to make.

I LOVE sweet stuff but this was WAY too sweet.  I even added 1L or more of alcohol and it was still too sweet for some.  I'll add some sparkling water and real lemon/lime juice next time to cut some of the sweetness.  (maybe even take out one of the drink concentrates?) The flavor was excellent (I also used coconut rum and it was very good).  This recipe needs some tweaking in my opinion.

This was ok, but it was way too sweet. That is more of a personal preference than a problem with the recipe, I suppose, but I could only manage to have one drink and there was lots left over because my group of friends evidently had the same opinion.

Amazing it tastes so yummy. I could not find any lime sherbet so I use rainbow it tastes like ambrosia salad in a cup! I made half the recommend punch but used the full cans of lemon and limeade. It turned out awesome I will definitely make this again.

this was really good! the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because we regularly make the 'sangria, sangria!' recipe for all our parties (and we do host quite a few;) and it's just hard to beat. overall, take the advice of the other reviewers and add at least 1/2 more rum than noted in recipe. otherwise, this is great!

This was a hit at the office Halloween party. I made it without the rum but people could not get enough of it. The Sprite takes away some of the tartness so it's just the right amount of lime. I will definitely make it again.

mmmm this tasted amazing and it was lots of fun on St. Patricks Day! I think it needs slightly less sugar though. It tastes a bit too sweet for me. But be careful...these might not seem like they have much alcohol when your drinking them but you'd be suprised!

excellent punch recipe.  we made it without the rum and every drop was gone.  just the right bit of tangy to go with the sweet.  may want to cut down on the sherbet which will foam, but other than that, it was great!

My suggestion: try it without the lemonade added. And if you can find it, use Green River instead of Lemon Lime soda.

It was pretty tasty but you can really have about 2 glasses max because it's just so acidy.

This is an awesome halloween drink. I really wanted to try with the alcohol but had the party for children so I made the virgin variety and it was a huge hit!

Made for an office party, was easy and tasty if a bit weak.  Would make again, but will add more rum, perhaps some triple sec.  Can also see making it with teguila too.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I made this for a Halloween party and not only did it look awesome, it tasted great!  I used the entire bottle of rum and you couldn't tell it was in there.  I also made a iced hand to float in the bowl.

This was  huge hit at our Halloween party. We left the rum out as there were kids there, but had a bottle of rum around that the adults could add. I floated a red colored ice hand and added some gummy worms as well as placed the bowl of punch inside a bigger bowl with dry ice. It was a perfect witch's brew! The kids all thought it was yummy!

Wow, this was surely a HUGE hit at our Halloween Party!! Everyone loved the taste, they just couldn't taste the alcohol, which turned out to be even more fun...just watch it!  Would have loved to have had some dry ice for effect, but good as is!  Thanks!

Wonderful punch.  I put in over a liter of rum and you could barely taste the alcohol.  Very dangerous.

I just made this today for St. Patty's Day.  It was a hit.  Everyone told me to save this recipe for our next get together.  It definitly packs a punch without a strong taste from the rum.

I didn't chill my rum, and everything stayed cold.  I love how tangy this drink is!  I won't just be making this around Halloween - it's far too good.

My wife only took three drinks, but my son enjoyed it.  One needs to have a little bit of a sense of humor to serve a green drink.  It was fun for Halloween night.  It's a little tart, but I would definitely prepare it again.

This was good, I also made two versions -one with alcohol for adults and one without for kids and non drinkers, both were almost completely gone by the end of the night. I didn't LOVE it, but it was good and everyone seemed to like it.

I made this for my Halloween party and it was an absolute hit!  In fact, no one touch the wine and the punch needed to be refilled an hour into the party.  I did not use the sherbet for fear of the messy foam as one reviewer mentioned!  I may use it this summer; it reminds me of a twisted lemonade.

I enjoy sour beverages so I liked this quite a bit. If your planning on drinking it all night I would say you need something else to switch it up a bit. Yes... it is SOUR.

I made this punch for a summer party, since I thought the color of it would be very summery green.  It turned out great!  Everyone raved about it.

This drink was good, but too sweet.  If I make again I would use diet soda,diet concentrate, and possible half the sherbert or leave it out entirely because it left a "foam" on top of the bowl that was not appealing. I would also use a 1 ltr. bottle of rum instead of the 750 ml.

I had to change something about Green Grog while I was at the store.  Not liking carbonated drinks, I used ice-water instead.
Thought it tasted great once the sherbet started melting; cut the lemon/limeade citrus bite down considerably.
Two Thumbs Up.

Substituted vodka for rum. Also added vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) to make it glow in the dark! Perfect for Halloween party, especially under a blacklight.

Super easy and a huge hit at the party.  We went through about three batches!  The proportions don't need to be exact and any type of white soda works great.  It never turned the deep green as shown in some of the pix, but that was fine.

This was an easy and tasty drink for our Halloween party. Even my fiance, who is a tad picky about her booze and not a big drinker, had two or three glasses. Real good stuff. I used Bacardi rum

I made this for a Halloween party and would make it again.  Nonalcoholic, substituted 1L seltzer water for the rum.  Also added coconut water as others suggested.  Grocery store didn't have lime  sherbet but the rainbow sherbet gave a nice scary look to it also.  Very little left at the end and lots of good compliments.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used this recipe last year for a family Halloween party, everyone gave it rave reviews.  Of course, tried it without the alcohol.  Really looked neat in a large cauldron-very foamy and eerie!!!

This was a good punch.  I made it for my son's Halloween party so of course I left out the rum.  I found a sherbet at Baskin Robin's that was actually rum flavored lime and it worked perfectly.  I also added dry ice for the "witch's brew" effect.  I made a lot of it and there was enough left over to share with another class later.  The cool thing was that after some time the dry ice turned it into a slushy consistency, which made it even better.  Another reviewer said it was too sweet.  I didn't find this to be true, but I do think it has a strong tart flavor, and the slush seemed to tone it down a bit. Next time if I don't have dry ice, I may use regular ice and a blender to duplicate the effect.

UPDATE: October 2007
I made this again this year...I made both an alcoholic and non-alcoholic version and they both seemed a little too sweet - the one with alcohol was better, but the one without I couldn't drink.  I think they both needed to be cut with something - They are still quite good, but difinitely on the very sweet side.  I think that I may try to "cut" it with tonic water or something like that next year...with that said, the one with alcohol was almost gone by the end of the night so a lot of people still really liked it.


October 2006
This was very easy to make...we ran out before the end of the night; everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and I will make it again next year for our Halloween party.  One batch fills up a large (Martha Stewart type) glass container, and the green color is perfect for Halloween.  Next year I will make sure I have enough ingredient on hand for a second batch.

this was the BEST punch that i've had in a while. i served it a halloween party and it was a big hit! the only thing i did differently was that i used southern comfort instead of rum...it added just the right amount of sweetness to the tangy lemon-lime mixture. but i'm sure that it is tasty either way :)
