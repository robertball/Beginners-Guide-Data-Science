Huge hit even with the toddler.  :). Although he eats anything.  Steamed the kale in the microwave: rinse kale (don't dry) drop in a microwave safe bowl and cover with Saran wrap, lifting a corner to vent.  30 seconds or so.  Lovely taste and healthy too.

This is amaaazzzinnggg!!! The flavor combination in this is brilliant! Avocado and feta and the occasional cool bite of cucumber or spicy red onion; the dijon and lemon is phenomenal! SOOO mouth-watering! Even my kids (four and 1.5 yrs) devoured this. I made a double batch, we were nibbling on it still warm from the quinoa. 

I DID keep the kale raw, to retain nutrients. I massaged and kneaded the torn up leaves with a bit of salt; and put some of them in a large plastic bag and let my kids fling it around. This is soo soo soooo delicious!!

This was a great salad! Don't be scared of the kale. I made a half batch and sent it for lunch for my husband and myself. We both were pleasantly surprised by the great flavors in this dish. The dressing is a great complement to all of the ingredients. In the end, you barely even taste the kale, but you do reap all of the benefits of eating it!

This was an amazing and very healthy salad. Loved it! I have been asked for the recipe many times so it has been a hit with my company also. I have made it many times and have just done a couple of changes. I substitute chicken broth instead of the water to cook the quinoa in. I add cherry tomatoes cut in half to the salad and I add a little more lemon and 1 clove of garlic finely chopped to the dressing. Thank you for the recipe!

Nice to see this healthy recipe here - so good.  Really dislike seeing people rate a recipe even though they don't even like the main ingredient - and chose to make it even with that ingredient the lead in the title!  Really a head scratcher. . .

This was deservedly a real hit at the potluck dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put more avocado (the one I used was smallish, so I used a whole one). People wished I had more dressing, but all seemed to like it. I sure did! Specifically, I was complimented on how the avocado and the feta cheese added key flavors.

I tried this recipe and multiplied it times 5 for a group - I made a few changes and have just sent the recipe to everyone because they loved it!  Instead of the red pepper, I used chopped grape tomatoes - I have a food sensitivity to peppers.  Instead of serving the quinoa and veggies on top of the kale, I mixed the kale in with the quinoa and veggies (except the tomato and avocado)  and 1/2 of the dressing and refrigerated overnight so all the flavors would meld.  In the morning, I added the tomato and avocado and the remainder of the dressing - it was more like a cold pasta or potato salad type salad.  It was amazing!!!!

This was so delicious!  Thank you for sharing, Stephanie!  I made it last night for the first time.  I couldn't use a whole bunch of kale (it wouldn't fit in the pot), but it was more than enough for the two of us.  I also steamed the kale a big longer, but before it was mushy.  Also, since I don't like feta cheese, I substituted gorgonzola, which was still tasty.  Next time I'll use a whole avocado and add more of the bell pepper and cucumber.  Can't wait to make this recipe again!

Beautiful and tasty.  Great presentation.  The flavors all so good together, but if you are missing an ingredient - don't let it stop you from making it because it will still be delicious.  I was able to put my steamer right over the quinoa while it was cooking - saved a step!  I love it chilled as well.

One of my favorite vegetable recipes so far.   I didn't have avocado but it came out great without it.  Had mango on the side and it was a nice compliment.

Wow, this was soooo incredibly good! Meatless Mondays just got a bit more interesting in our house.  I decreased the sea salt to 1/2 tsp and added a couple shakes of onion/garlic powders, dried parsley, and freeze dried shallots to the vinaigrette. Also used canola oil due to preference, as well as a wee splash of seasoned rice wine vinegar. Used de-stemmed organic baby kale and a packet of organic roasted garlic quinoa. I plated each serving separately to individualize to DH and DD's tastes. DH wasn't a fan, however, 5 year-old DD loved it and made each bite so that it contained each ingredient.  For an extra boost of Omega 3, I topped each serving with a few toasted walnuts.  Loved the flavors in every bite. This will definitely be a repeat and I can already foresee cravings for this outlandishly delicious and healthy dish. Bravo!

LOVED this salad! Made it once last week and once this week already since I found it. We haven't had any lemon juice on hand either time, but I was able to use raspberry balsamic vinegar instead--didn't change any measurements--and it was to die for!!! The first time I made it, we really liked it, but wished it had more of the additional veggies so this time I made sure to add lots of avocado, cucumber, red bell pepper, onion, and feta. My husband, who is usually ready for a second dinner around 9pm was not hungry by then at all! This will become a regular part of menu for sure!

I am not fond of kale. Replaced it with fresh baby spinach. Still 4 supper foods, very good, and something I am comfortable eating. Next time I am thinking of adding some shredded grilled chicken or pork and maybe some rice as I am fond of one dish meals.

This was probably the best salad I have ever eaten! Very healthy and filling. Ate a large bowl for dinner and was more than enough. Made a few alterations based on other reviews: doubled the avocado, added cherry tomatoes, steamed kale over chicken broth, added 1 clove pressed garlic to the dressing and increased dressing by half. Will definitely be making this again!! :)

I completely changed this recipe but it was still really good. I used whole wheat couscous instead of quinoa, left out the kale, added fresh garlic, green onion instead of red, tomatoes instead of bell pepper, parmesan instead of feta, and cut the oil in half.

Fabulous!  I never rate recipies but I had to rate this one 5 stars. Next time I will use 1/2 tsp. kosher instead of 3/4.  Going to have this for lunch often. Thank you Stephanie!

This was amazing.  My first time at kale and I loved it.   It also looked so gorgeous on the plate I cannot wait to serve it to others.   The only change I made was a regular yellow onion in place of the red, because I had no red.   It was still awesome!   And so easy to make.   Served it with salmon grilled on cedar plank also on allrecipes, and also awesome.

Made this for dinner tonight. It is fabulous and I got rave reviews from hubby and vegetarian son. Didn't have lemon so used orange juice and orange zest and a bit of honey in the dressing. Added pine nuts to top it off. This salad is complex, flavorful and super healthy. I will be making it often! Thanks!

I forgot to add the avocado (!) but it was still excellent! It reminded me of tabooli a bit, since I also added a 1/2 cup of fresh parsley. Thanks for a great fresh salad!

the vegetable and quinoa mix was an excellent mix of flavors!!  the dressing as written was a bit too salty for my taste but that's easy enough to alter in the future.  i will definately make this again.  thanks so much for the recipe!!

One of our favorites! Very healthy and very good! For the first time this summer, we made it almost as a tossed salad, adding all of the ingredients into a bowl and tossing together (after the kale had cooled) instead of layering the kale then the quinoa.  We served it to a larger crowd and everyone liked it-young and old.

I've made a similar recipe. Very good flavor. You could really add cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives, and maybe a little garlic in the dressing for added flavor combos!

I didn't have kale on-hand, so I substituted fresh spinach and served this with grilled chicken, and my family (husband + 8 yr old) LOVED it! No leftovers is always a tell-tale sign of a good recipe. :-)

Love this salad! It's fresh tasting and healthy. I've made it multiple times. The avocado and feta add a lot of flavor. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! However, I liked it better with a lemon/shallot dressing instead of the mustard based dressing. A balsamic vinaigrette would probably be delicious also.

This was so delicious, I was eating it out of the pot! Steaming the kale was a really good idea, as the bitterness was gone but still retained the nutrients. My avocados weren't ripe so I had to substitute a few things in. I used cremini mushrooms, tomatoes, and Julienned carrots - all finely chopped. I also added lime juice as well. The flavours were very aromatic and the citrus juice definitely enhanced it! I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was delicious!  The steamed kale was easier to eat than raw.  The tart dressing was a perfect topping, though I did add 1 tsp honey.

A delicious summer meal. I pretty much followed the recipe, but added cherry tomato and mango to the mix. I also just mix everything all together, since kale is a bit stronger it keeps for a couple of days even with the dressing on it. This one is a keeper!

Delicious!!  I used baby kale, which I find to be a little less bitter.  I also cut the salt to 1/2 tsp instead of 3/4.  Will definitely make this again!

I've made this several times and love it!  The only thing is I don't add the kale, since I'm trying to eat a raw diet and this is kind of transitional with the cooked quinoa (perhaps I'll try a sprouted version), I can't see cooking kale, but it's probably still good that way.

This is the first time I actually came back to give a review. This recipe was amazing.  Thanks to KW for the tip about steaming the kale in the microwave.   I didn't want another pot to clean!  I am glad I tried this at the beginning of the summer season because I will be making this side many times this season.

I am new to eating both quinoa and kale. This recipe is absolutely delicious. I have made it several times in only the last couple of weeks. You can add whatever veggies you have handy; it doesn't really matter. A new staple in our house.

This is great!  Red onions are a little strong, so the salad probably needs some time in the fridge to meld and mellow out the bite.  I left out the bell peppers and added a little more cucumber and avocado.

Great! ! My daughter loved it.  Great salad, easy to make,  I used baby kale as that's what I had on hand.  I didn't bother steaming it, it softened when I blended  the warm quinoa into it.  Im hoping it is as delicious the next day.

I loved this salad. The only thing I changed was the kale. I bought baby kale and didn’t have to do any to it. Will definitely make it again. Very refreshing for the summer months.

Yum! I used some homemade fermented red onions in place of fresh cut and threw in some diced roast chicken. Let out pepper since I don't care for it. Served with some zucchini blueberry bread from this site. Very good!

Love this healthy recipe—thanks for sharing. My only “tweaks”: I substituted green onion for the red onion because it’s hard to get good red onions where I live...and I finely chopped the kale and all the veggies and mixed everything together. The Dijon, feta and lemon juice in this recipe give the salad just the right amount of flavorful zestiness.

So so good! All of the flavors go so well together. Lots of textures too. The first time I made this, I made it exactly as written. The second time, I used sun dried tomato oil (from a jar of sun dried tomatoes in oil) in the vinaigrette and WOW, took it to a whole new level for me. I literally use that dressing on a salad with romaine, grape tomatoes and kalamata olives on an almost daily basis, I can’t get enough.

Amazing! Here are my adaptations:

1/2 c. red quinoa and 1/2 c. white quinoa and
substituted chicken broth for water. I added
3-4 cloves chopped garlic, 
1/2 c. chopped kalamata olives, 1/2 c. sun dried tomatoes, 1/2 c. red onion, 1/2 c. green and red bell peppers. 

I sauteed the garlic in the pot with a tablespoon of olive oil, then added the broth and quinoa. I followed the instructions on the dressing and mixed all together. Fantastic! Don't skip the kale, it is much better than spinach and I tried it both ways. I steamed the kale for 45 seconds in the microwave, much faster, less mess.

Loved this!!! Everything about it was delicious.  Made it in stages over  a busy day: Cooked quinoa first and left to cool. Made dressing and prepared kale so all I needed to do was steam it.   Putting it together was a snap and so tasty.  We are taking left overs for lunch tomorrow.

6/15/19 - I made this again recently and loved it the second time around.  This most recent time preparing this salad  forgot to steam the kale.... After dinner, I poured the remainder of the dressing over the salad.  The next day I found that the kale had softened perfectly from the acid in the dressing.  I'm going to try this same technique intentionally and save myself the steaming stage.

Our daughter is allergic to sulfites so instead of the Dijon mustard I used 2 Tlb mustard powder.  This is an amazing salad. Love, love, love it!  Made a triple batch yesterday and it was ALL GONE with supper. Have a huge amount of kale in the garden so this was timed perfectly.

It's a really good recipe, but I dropped a star for the dressing. It's just too tangy and sour for me.  Next time, I'll add a little sugar to it. I did the quinoa in the rice cooker while I chopped the veggies and made the dressing. Steamed the kale in there too. Makes for a nice easy lunch with little mess.

I don't have a steamer so I stirfried the kale in a bit of chicken broth, with a lid on, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was simply delicious!!!! Definitely would make this one again... 

Two years later, I have yet to meet anyone who did not love this salad once they got past their aversion to trying quinoa.  I arrange the ingredients in layers on a roast platter, then evenly distribute the dressing... Never have leftovers! (-:

Didn't have Dijon mustard so substituted plain mustard (little less than 1 T). Also used less salt. But still felt the dressing was too salty.  Might have liked with a different dressing.

Fixed this for dinner tonight.. Avocados at market were hard as a rock, so I decided to substitute with strawberries.  Very nice.  I microwaved the kale for 1 minute to soften it up just a little bit; perfect! The only other thing I did was add sunflower seeds to add a little crunch.  Definitely a keeper!

This was was very tasty, though next time I would do a little less dijon, which seemed to overwhelm the salad for my tastes. Also, I just put the kale on top of the quinoa when it was almost done cooking, to steam in the same pot. Very easy and quick to make.

This recipe was so healthy and yummy! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the amount of olive oil. I have a little bit of heartburn after eating it. Next time I would cut the oil in half and see how that goes.

Thrilled with this recipe! To my delight, the guys who are generally not the biggest veggie lovers ate it up and went back for more. I will double this recipe in the future so I have more leftovers!

Instead of steaming the kale you can massage the dressing into the leaves to tenderize them. I also used about a 1/3 cup of the cooked quinoa and left out the feta cheese. AMAZING recipe! A spectrum of colors and nutritional elements. The flavors and texture are so complete and the salad holds up for easy leftovers the next day.

I followed the recipe with exception of adding a bit of chicken bouillon to the quinoa cooking water. I also followed another's recommendation to steam the kale in the microwave. This was a perfect lunch and fits within a low fat diet. For those of you afraid of kale, it is a must in this recipe. The texture of the kale compliments the soft texture of the quinoa. I prepared the night before and kept the ingredients separate. Perfect for next day lunch at work without hassle!

I used baby kale, and it has a milder, slightly saltier flavor than the mature leaves.  I also forgot to add the feta, so if you don't have any, you can still enjoy this salad.  These were my only departures from the recipe.  I'm not fully on the quinoa bandwagon yet, so I was not particularly impressed.  I was looking for a bit more zing in the dressing, so I will "tweak on"!

I made it without the kale only because I don't usually have this on hand. This recipe is AMAZING!!  Hubby loved it too. I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks. I also bought the tri color quinoa from trader joes, same nutritional value but i love the way it looks :)

Made several changes to suit my family's tastes, so not 5-stars.  We don't eat raw peppers, so those were out.  We're going more vegan, so omitted the feta.  Finally, we're watching sodium, so reduced salt to just a few shakes.  The result was delicious for us.  Thank you for sharing.

This is AWESOME!!! The only thing I did differently was used chicken broth to boil the quinoa (Trade Joe's organic quinoa) and added a sprinkle of sea salt to the kale (to taste). Steamed the kale a little longer. Just enough so it's still firm and not soggy. The dressing just kicks it up to A++ status. I hate avocados but they tasted so good in this. Don't leave any ingredient out the first time you make it. You will be surprised that you love all the veggies in this recipe!

Excellent! I didn't have quinoa, but did have a brown rice, rye, quinoa mix. Served the kale, rice, avocado/red peppers with the dressing over baked salmon. If we added a fruit, ok , some say avocado is a fruit, it would almost be complete! I disagree with the portions. I think it makes at least 4 servings. UMMY!

I doubled the dressing like one person suggested and it was a bit too much. The flavor was fantastic! My husband and I have just started a gluten-free diet, this was a great introduction to this amazing grain. Definitely a keeper.

This was great. I cooked the quinoa, cut up the veggies, and mixed the dressing several hours ahead of time. At dinner all I did was steam the kale (for several minutes) and then it was easy to just put it all together. I posted my picture, too.

Tasty but simple salad.  I didn’t add cheese because I’d cholesterol restrictions and it still tasted good.  This will make a nice summer meal with some crusty bread on the side.

I made this to the T.  My husband believe it or not is a salad fan, and he loved this one. He has been going on and on about the salad dressing.  I made a lot more of everything when I was chopping, so that we would have extra for lunches.  I would double the salad dressing next time just to have extra home made dressing in the fridge to use later.  I did chop and roast a small sweet potato to go with this.  It was just a little more added bliss.  Thanks so much for a great recipe we will use again and again!!

This was really good! Followed recipe exactly, measured everything! Ended up making 1.5 of dressing as worried it wasn’t enough, but did not even end up using it all. Did however use minute ready quinoa- just opened and added.

I didn't steam the kale and I loved it. Will certainly make it again as it was a hit with the guests.

I made it just as directed, except I added some cooked chicken. It was super good!  
I brought it to a potluck and even those afraid of kale went back for seconds!

Excellent flavour - rave reviews
Had to lower the amount of kale - perhaps a "bunch" of kale is larger in Canada.

It was nice and tasty.  I found the dressing a little to mustardy.  Would be good with an orangy type dressing too.

I substituted Farro for quinoa. Massaged kale w salt ahead of time. Added cherry tomatoes and added entire avocado just before serving. Served to guests and ate leftover 4 days later (stored in Mason jar). Still yummy.

Really light, fresh, easy and satisfying. I topped it with baked cod and drizzled the dressing over all of it.  A big hit with my family. I’ll definitely make it again.

I added tomatoes, mushrooms and broccoli to the salad.  I also made a bigger portion to feed more people, everyone agreed the dressing was the key to making the salad great.   (Side note didnt have a strainer to steam my kale so I used a crock pot and aluminum foil that u poked holes in)

I took the advice of another and micro the damp kale for 30 seconds, GREAT IDEA!.  I'm not a fan of raw peppers so I added roasted red pepper strips.  It was Delicious!  It will be a keeper.

I've made this a few times now and it's a hit at our house. I don't steam the kale. Instead I squeeze it a whole bunch and then put the hot quinoa right on top of it. Other than that I follow the recipe as it is. It is delicious!

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! I added finely chopped radishes and apples. I also added craisins and raw pumpkin seeds. I did not steam the kale at all. I just cut it in tiny pieces with kitchen shears. Due to time, I made dressing with a Good Seasons packet and added a little honey and lime juice. Delish!!

I’m working on building a plant based diet with foods that are as unprocessed as possible, but easy to prepare. This is a surprisingly tasty recipe. It’s filling and versatile, accommodating a variety of grains and veggies. I make it ahead on Sunday and have lunch ready to go the next morning.
Thank you for a great new addition to my recipe box!

Love this salad and make it as a side dish often. It pairs well with fish (grilled tuna anyone?)  I sometimes enhance the recipe by adding extra vegetables including sugar snap peas, red bell pepper .    The vinaigrette just gets better as it melds together.  A healthy and tasty dish even for those that don't like kale!

The dressing really makes this salad! 
The rest is up for interpretation. I accidentally ate the avocado waiting for the quinoa to cook. Threw in some pumpkin seeds, slivered carrots, and celery.

This was delicious! I made it last night for the first time for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Not only did it look great (this website won't let me upload my photo) but it tasted great - and tasted even better today. I didn't have Dijon so make it without that and it still was good.

Wow! This quinoa salad recipe looks so tasty and healthy that I must try it. But, I am going to replace kale with green and red spinach because they are local produce. I am Indian, so I love the kick of dijon but may give add a dash of roasted garam masala on top.

I usually make a recipe I find on here that looks delicious and it ends up alright and not how I expected it to taste. . This one was incredible and was beyond my expectations. I was nervous when I taste tested the dressing by itself, but once everything is mixed in together it is amazing. The dressing may seem salty, but I promise it balances out once mixed in with everything. Don't leave a single step out! I don't think I have ever left a review on Allrecipes and it is my favorite site. This was review-worthy. It is so easy to make too! I added more cucumbers, avocado and bell pepper. I also used tri color quinoa because it's all I had on hand but I doubt that made any difference whatsoever besides add contrast to the presentation. Delicious!!!

Yummy!  I didn't have feta (which would have made it BETTER) so I used some mozzarella.  I also can't eat peppers so I doubled the cucumber and added some dried cranberry for color.  Delish!

This is a delicious alternative to your everyday side dish.  My guest ate multiple helpings .  I followed the recipe fairly closely, but used the entire avocado.  I am very fond of feta cheese, so I also added more feta.  I will definitely make this again.

It was great. As my husband is on a low carb diet, I used corn instead of quinoa and stirred it into the veggies. I didn't have purple onion and used green onions. The steamed kale was a delicious discovery.  I liked it not being tough and the bright green bed was lovely.

Made recipe as written except my pepper was green that I used. I really liked the way everything came together except for the dressing.....just not to my liking, for me there was too much Dijon. I will definitely make again, however; I will do my own oil/lemon dressing or oil/vinegar dressing. Another option I will try is an Asian flavoured dressing. But all in all a great healthy meal! Thank you Stephanie.

Had to substitute a couple ingredients due to poor planning but even the kale tasted good and I normally don't like kale.  Maybe I know to steam kale now.

4 stars because I made a mistake. I did not cook the Kale. I massaged and marinated it for 4 hours in the vinegrette and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Very tasty.

I made this only changing how to steam the kale. I followed one of the suggestions of steaming the kale in the microwave (placed kale in a deep bowl for 15 seconds, flip kale over another 20 seconds). I liked this recipe, however my husband couldn’t stop expressing how delicious it was. That being said, I will be keeping it.

Very nice! I really liked the dressing and all of the other flavors and how they blended together. I found that there is now frozen kale which I used for this salad and it worked out great. Just follow the microwave directions. I cooled the hot ingredients in the refrigerator for about 30 min. before putting it all together.

Delicious even though I left out two ingredients! I didn't have avocado in the house which would have added a lot of extra flavor and I left out the feta cheese because I can not eat dairy.  I can't imagine how much better it would taste with these two ingredients because it was so good without them. My husband and two of my kids ate it too which was shocking! This is a super healthy lunch in so many ways and it tastes great too.

Loved it!  This is a really nice combination of flavors and textures.  I tripled the veggies, doubled the dressing ingredients (except for the oil) and left the quinoa amount as is. Also the kale doesn't need to be cooked - merely cook the quinoa in a larger pot than you need, and when the quinoa is cooked, put the raw kale on top and allow to sit covered but with the heat off for about 5 minutes.

Wow. I usually don't eat this but was on a whim to make something healthy for the week. When I cooked the quinoa I was dreading it. The quinoa and kale smelled so healthy and nasty—help! But then I mixed everything together according to the directions and wow! It tasted great! I would add a bit more cucumber for the neutral, refreshing crunch.

I stripped the leaves off the stems, chopped them, steamed in microwave for 1 min. Then spread on paper towel, and squeezed the extra water off the leaves. Swapped chopped celery for the cucumber, Used a combination of red, orange and yellow peppers, a bit more red onion. Tossed together and placed paper towel on top to absorb any extra moisture while storing. I add the dressing, avocado and cheese just before serving. This salad keeps very well in frig ... for days! I have made this a couple of times, shared with friends who also love it. What we call a 'do-over'.

Loved it.  The dressing was really tasty, but I will not be adding salt to the dressing next time.  I also had it with chard.   I  most definitely will make  it again and again.

Yummy!! :-)

Made it just like the recipe other than microwaving the kale for a minute as another reviewer suggested. Both the salad and dressing were delicious and kept several days in the frig for great lunches after initially serving as a beautiful side to flat iron steak. Great recipe!

Great salad.  Steaming the kale for a min makes a huge difference. Added a bit more lemon juice than recipe called for.  Will definitely make again

I had it with herb vinaigrette to cutdown the fat, which was also really good!

i absolutely loved this!  Brought it as a side to a BBQ for a healthy non-potato option.  I added some fresh sliced black olives, but otherwise kept it as is.  SOOOO good!!

Simply the best salad I’ve had.  I made this again with avocado dressing, it was ok but the original dressing is the best by far.

I was shocked at how delicious this was. I’ve made it several times, the first I left or the red pepper because I didn’t have any, the next I included it; delicious both ways. My fiancé was hungry about 30 minuted later, so it’s good for us as a side dish or if it’s just me having a smaller meal. Will defiantly make over and over again.

Love Kale, but for some reason did not like it in this  (tried steaming as recommended and also tried without steaming).  Really liked the remainder without the kale.  Possibly my kale torn into  "bite-size pieces" were too large.  Still good.

A meal that is very quick , easy -- and delicious! Since I am eating a plant-based diet, I modified the recipe a bit by excluding cheese and using a vegan Dijon dressing and it was still a hit with my household.

This was so good. I used a very large bunch of kale,and chopped it in my food processor, made it much easier. doubled the dressing and along with everything else added mushrooms, tomatoes, all the pepper and cucumber, dried cranberries, some walnuts. Lunch for four days!! Excellent

Such a delicious salad! I rip the kale into small pieces and massage the dressing into them raw. I do not use all the oil in the dressing, maybe a teaspoon only, to cut the fat. I like to use tricolored quinoa. I only cut half the avocado and save the other half in its skin with the pit, to preserve freshness for leftovers. I also use lemon juice, salt and pepper on the avocado before adding it to salad.

I cannot say enough about this salad!  I loved this!  I steamed the kale for 2-3 minutes so it was soft, but, still had a slight chew to it.   I layered the salad, but, then decided to just mix it all together like a pasta salad so the dressing was evenly distributed.   Great flavors and textures. The dressing is wonderful!

This is a great recipe, but even better if you massage the dressing into the raw kale until it's tender (about a minute or so), rather than steaming it.  The dressing is tasty, and the combination of kale, quinoa, avocado, and feta is very good!

Delicious and healthy salad!  I followed the recipe exactly except adding a little bit more feta.  This was the first time I steamed kale and really like it this way.  Hubby and teens enjoyed. Looking forward to making it again!

Yum! I had never tried Kale lightly steamed but it definately decreased the bitterness (and made it a brighter; more inviting green color) and without taking out too much crunch. I will definately make this again.

This was a delicious and healthy recipe. My husband and I made it one day for lunch. It was a hit with my father-in-law, too! We doubled the recipe and enjoyed some leftovers with a side of baked plantains for dinner. Still so good!! We went for seconds!! And thirds!!

Made this twice in one weekend. Instead of steaming the kale, I massaged it with a little of the dressing and it worked perfectly. I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and pickled the red onion. I also subbed halved grape tomatoes for the red pepper (personal preference). I combined everything and the flavors melded perfectly. This is excellent and healthy.

As is, the recipe makes a lovely salad, but I thought it needed more seasoning.  Next time I'll add fresh cilantro and add more in the way of heat -- some hot sauce or cayenne in the dressing.

This is now one of my favorite recipes now!  Sooo Tasty!   Very nice blend of flavors.  I kept the dressing separate and added the avocado right before serving so that I could take for lunch the next day.  Very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing it.

Excellent followed the recipe almost exactly and the kids loved it.  Steamed the kale for about 1 1/2 minutes and it was perfect.

Made it ! Loved it!  I will make it again.  I did not use cheese and added blanched asparagus. The dressing would go good on any salad

Fantastic! In the rotation now. Followed tips here to microwave washed, chopped kale for 30 secs and to put 1 clove garlic (minced) into the dressing. Added tomato; added more avocado; left out cucumbers (my son calls them "pukecumbers). Served with chicken. So delicious!

Very healthy, lots of bite with the feta. Also, "rubbed" the kale before blanching. Should make it every day

Loved this salad! I needed to use up some kale and avocado and wanted to incorporate quinoa. Great side dish for dinner or salad for lunch. I did add some garden fresh tomatoes to the leftover salad the following day and it was even better but not necessary as it's wonderful as is!

I did not have a cucumber but I had plenty of peppers so I just amped them up - and I did not have any feta either - however, I had this fabulous mango creamy goat cheese which I added.  Wow,  the slight sweetness of the mango cheese really racheted up all of the flavors in this dish. Sooo loved this and will make it again and again!!!  Well done!!!!

My husband and I both liked it, and I'll likely make it again.  It's hard to find recipes using kale that are tasty.  I used organic black kale, so it's not as tough.

Delicious!  I was a little suspicious of the dressing when I tried it on its own, but it complements the salad so well. Added extra onion and bell pepper for seasoning. Easy and yummy.

I added grilled chicken that I marinated for 2 hrs in lemon juice and dijon mustard. I also added sliced cherry tomatoes. I steamed the kale in 1/4 cup chicken broth for about 7 mins with the lid on.  Added a nice flavor to the kale. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers and made everything in advance so it had time to soak up the dressing. Excellent. Can't wait to make it again!

This was delicious!!! I think it is a very forgiving salad--you could add what you liked and it would still be amazing! I used green onions because I didn't have purple, left out the feta because I didn't have that either, and added chopped tomatoes because I had some I needed to use. I also added a bit of vegetable bouillon to the quinoa water because I like to cook it that way.

I made this recipe over Mother's Day.   It was fabulous.  I left out the Dijon mustard and cut back on the salt.  This was a family hit.   We have made this recipe almost every week since our discovery of it.   It serves as a great side with fish, steak, chicken or pork chops.

Yum, yum, yum!  Hubby and I both enjoyed this dish. It makes a lot so would be good for a crowd. There was a LOT of quinoa; I may cut that back next time.  The  flavors in this go so well together, thanks for sharing.

We made this the other night and all loved it! We didn't steam the kale because we wanted it crunchy and like the taste that way. Also  cut  the olive oil in half. We wanted to use up some green pepper and  chick peas so we added them too. Great recipe! Thank you.

I took this to an Easter potluck.  Everyone loved it.  The dressing is great and you could put it on lots of things.  I did not steam the kale.  I have fresh kale in my cold frame that lasted all winter and I've been looking for ways to use it.  We eat it raw in salads often.  If you let it sit a few hours with the dressing on it, it will wilt a little and be more tender.  I used the youngest leaves I had.  I actually made it again a few days later because we liked it so much and that time I left out the avocado and served it warm.  I like it better without the avocado because it just seems like too many mushy ingredients.

Better than what I expected. The flavors together are perfect and dressing gives it that extra push! Very filling. Sauteed quinoa in olive oil lightly before boiling; brought out a nutty flavor - yum! Steamed kale in microwave-less hassle. Doubled and made huge bowl; it kept 3 days. Kept avocado , feta cheese  and dressing seperate until ready to eat to prevent it from becoming soggy. Great meatless option while fasting. Will definitely eat even when not fasting!

I follows the directions but also used 1/2 kale and 1\2 romaine, green scallions instead of red onion and added 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic. It was awesome!

Awesome recipe...great  flavor and combination of super foods!  I followed the recipe with two additions:  added minced garlic to vinaigrette and halved grape tomatoes to salad.  To make the kale more tender and flavorful, I massaged it with a little vinaigrette and a sprinkle of salt after steaming.  I also mixed a little vinaigrette with quinoa after cooking,  layered the salad, then poured the remaining vinaigrette over salad.

Instead of steaming the kale I massage it for a couple of minutes with a small amount of olive oil.  Softens and takes out the bitterness.

I think this is a FANTASTIC recipe!   I don't know how it turns out tasting so sweet when there is no sugar.

Costco didn't have bags of Kale so I used their Power Greens--a mixture of Kale, Chard, and Spinach.  It comes pre-washed so I didn't steam the greens or anything and it worked perfectly.  My juice was from Meyer's lemons which maybe added to the sweet flavor.

This is going to be a regular dish in our house!

I read one of the comments about using baby spinach instead of the kale. I prepared mine in that way as I know late kale can be very tough and strong in taste. I used a whole avocado and slightly more red pepper. It had an amazing taste and everyone enjoyed it and asked me to make it again! 2 thumbs up all around the table at my place.

I made today for lunch with dwarf baby kale from the farmers market.  I didn't steam the kale, just tossed with the warm quinoa so it could wilt a bit.  It was very good and can't wait for the flavors to meld in the fridge and enjoy for lunch again tomorrow.

I prepared this salad with slight changes in the and it was really super yummy. I made even healthier version of it! by replacing red onion and bell peppers (I don't like them) with fresh chopped parsley and finely chopped almonds. As seasoning I used salt, garlic powder, fresh lemon juice and olive oil (without any mustard). Not only me but my husband who does not generally like quinoa, enjoyed this salad...

Overall a nice healthy salad.  I added tomato, and used more cucumber and pepper than called for.  Dressing is not exciting, and kale is just not exciting to me in general.  Would increase amount of quinoa next time.  For me, the quinoa took much less than 15 min (maybe 9 min before I smelled something burning on the bottom of the pan).

used baby spinach instead of kale.   It has a lot less chewing.  Added cherry tomatoes sliced in half and double the chopped red pepper.  Very nice. Gone in minutes!

Great recipe, although I did modify it a bit.  I used orzo instead of quinoa (which I didn't have on hand).The first time, I used sun-dried tomatoes and added some broccoli slaw and omitted cucumber. Hubby loved it! Second time around, I used cucumber as specified, but it didn't have as much flavor. I steamed the kale in the microwave as suggested, and it worked just fine. It holds up very well for a couple of days in the refrigerator.

The kale is still a bit bitter but still good considering the health benefits. The dressing is yummy. Didn't put onions because of hubby not liking them. Also added about 1 tsp of honey and used a sea salt mixed with dill and lemon. It was delish. I am sure the dressing would have been just as good without honey but I was in the mood for some sweetness.

Used red quinoa, vidalia onion and juice from a lime in place of lemon juice because that's what I had on hand, skipped cooking the kale and just relied on the residual heat from quinoa because I couldn't find my steamer, but added a tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro and topped with a drizzle of sriracha sauce mixed with honey (1:1) for a five-star salad

The first time I made this I made it with curly kale and I didn't like the texture of the kale. This time I substituted a bunch of spinach for the kale and it was just right. I love the lemon dijon flavor and all the healthy ingredients. I just left out the feta and red pepper for my own personal preference. Unfortunately, the rest of my was not as much of a fan, but that leaves more for me!

Very good! I doubled the kale, peppers, cucumbers, and avocado when I made this and added more feta than called for because I love feta. Everyone who tried it loved it.  I can see this working well with other non pasta type grains, such as couscous or maybe bulger or faro. A word of caution, the cucumbers can get a little soft as time goes on, so this doesn't preserve well for more than a couple days, but you could easily swap them out for another veggie.  I can see adding left over grilled chicken or shrimp to this to make it a solid summer meal.

This was a big hit at the potluck! I steamed the kale and then immediately put it in ice water and spun it dry. Quinoa was easy to cook in the rice cooker.

I have to agree with most everyone else.  This salad is so good packed with all kinds of healthy ingredients. I tweaked it a little adding tomatoes by mistake really and instead of the feta cheese that I did not have on hand, added shredded asiago cheese. It was yummy.  Thanks Stephanie for a great recipe!

Oh man, this is a good one!  Great flavors and really tasty!  I modified the ingredients a bit and prepped the kale differently.  Here's what I did: I doubled the dressing ingredients and poured over the kale, FIRST, then let it set aside while I prepped everything else.  The lemon will soften the kale.  Next, since I love veggies, I used 1 cup of onions, 1 cup of orange/red bell pepper, 1 cup of cucumber.  All other ingredients remain the same (quinoa, avocado, feta).  My secret ingredients that took the salad to the next level... fresh tarragon and basil!!!  I did not go too heavy with it, just enough to add a surprise with every bite.  Truly amazing!

Amazing!  Everyone loved it.  I used the kale salad from Costco, microwaved 30 seconds, threw some cherry tomatoes in the salad and added mixed garlic to the dressing (suggestions from other reviewers).  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was just ok for us, but I think it's just because we learned that we don't care for Kale.

This is a great recipe. I kicked it up a notch and added some fresh ginger & curry powder to the dressing.  I love avocado but it didn't bring anything to this recipe so omitted the second time around.

So delicious!  I did as one reviewer suggested and steamed the kale in the microwave for 30 seconds.  Tastes so flavorful and light.  I just love the freshness of the lemon vinaigrette and the crunch of the vegetables.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is my all time FAVORITE salad! I make a big batch on Sunday and eat on it all week. It's so versatile, I've made it several ways with whatever I need to use up in the fridge. The dressing knocks it out of the park! We have also added grilled chicken to it and it's fabulous!

This is delicious. I doubled it and it gave me 3 meals. I used a baby kale/baby spinach blend and it was really good. I cooked the quinoa (I chose the red quinoa) in the rice cooker with vegetable broth (far and away the best way to cook quinoa.  Use the white rice setting)  Because I was storing it for 3 meals I chopped the avocado and tossed with the dressing right before serving. Delicious. I've thought of adding some chickpeas for a little more substance but haven't tried that

Wonderful recipe.....it is a complete vegetarian meal.  I  did make a little change though. I didn't steam kale. Instead I chopped it in food processor, and added it to rest of the salad.  Second time I made it I had run out of quinoa and it was delicious even without it, but again I added chopped kale to it. To make up for quinoa's nuttiness, I added chopped walnuts and i had a very impressive, good looking gourmet salad with lots of super foods in it.

I'm picky so this review is really only for me. Too much lemon but steaming the kale is the trick for reducing the kale bitterness. I should also remember I don't like the mustard particularly.

I'm always looking for new ways to use quinoa and this recipe was a good find.  I did not have any kale on hand so I used baby spinach leaves and it was a great substitute.  The only thing I did not care for was the dressing, so I added a little honey to it and it was a huge improvement.

Even without meat, this is one fine main dish. Prefer fresh spinach to the kale because it cuts the chewing effort by at least 75%; both, however, are tasty. Update: Stripping out all kale stems of 1/8" and larger, then chopping into fairly small bits (1" max) before steaming make this a much easier chew. Have brought mustard up to 2 T & added 1 tsp garlic powder (plan to increase) in the vinaigrette. Have been topping w/ 2 - 3 T dry roasted sunflower seed for flavor & 1 T chia seed for added nutrition.

Wow! This salad is not only full of good things, but also to die for. I made it for tomorrow's dinner but there might not be any leftover after tonight! I added roasted butternut squash instead of yam, Gorgonzola cheese instead of feta cheese, and light raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Don't be afraid to add your favorite vegetables and protein.

My 14-year-old son thought the dressing was super tasty!  I didn't have feta (and I'm trying to be dairy and meat-free)or avocado (over ripe):0(

This is a really good salad. This is the second time I've made it and it tastes just as good this time too. Had to substitute wine vinegar for the lemon juice this time because it's all I had. Tastes good both ways. Thank you so much for the lovely delicious salad :)

Everybody that has tried this salad loves it. I followed the recipe except steaming the Kale (see review by LizzyMcGizzy or Google Search Kale massage). You don't need to steam the Kale because it is not tough or bitter after the massage. Sounds silly but it works. Thanks to Stephanie for the recipe and to Lizzy and the others that convinced me to massage instead of steaming.

This was my first time cooking kale and quinoa. I steamed the kale a bit longer than the recipe called for as I wanted it cooked well; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out quite good. We did not know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised. The dressing definitely makes this salad tasty. Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

It was delicious quite refreshing. I followed the recipe with the exception of the mustard. I used brown mustard because I was out of the Dijon mustard. I fixed four servings so that I can have it for lunch a couple of days.  I am in love with quinoa.

this was so good, it actually got better as we ate it which means it probably improves when it sits for a time before serving it. Instead of steaming the kale I put it in a sauté pan with a touch of olive oil and sautéed it very briefly until just starting to wilt. And since I don't care for red peppers I substituted with grape tomatoes.
This was my first time trying both kale and quinoa and I am so pleased with this recipe!

This recipe has it all.  It's quick, healthy, vegetarian and super filling.  Even my husband, who is a true meat and potatoes kind of guy, loved it.  I made it exactly as written, except I used a whole avocado because I don't believe there is such a thing as too much avocado.

This was one of the best things I've ever made. Superfood salad is an understatement! I added only 1/2 tsp of salt to the dressing per the previous reviews and added some honey. Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and steamed the kale 1 min over the pot of quinoa to save a step! Added red onion, red pepper, a whole avocado, and halved cherry tomatoes. No cucumber or feta. To make it a full meal for us omnivores, I grilled some chicken breasts (little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne). DELICIOUS! Lots of prep though.

So, I'm trying to eat kale and not make faces with a yuck expression.  To that end, this was tasty and I will make it a staple weekly -- If I was more kale friendly, I'd probably give this a 5.  I didn't realize that steaming kale ahead of time would make such a difference for the better.  I added sweet grape tomatos from the garden as I didn't have red pepper.  This recipe is also something you can make ahead and eat over two days because the kale won't wilt. Loving it and looking forward to taking to work :).

Did not steam the kale, just made it a day or two ahead and let the kale leaves soften.  Also, waited to add the avocado until just before serving and kicked the feta amount up to about 1/2 c (we love cheese).  Excellent salad.

Great recipe for a hearty salad. My family loves quinoa so it's great to find new ways to use it. I did make some modifications solely because of the ingredients I had. For the veggies I used lacinato kale, grated carrots, green onion and halved grape tomatoes and used the entire avocado. I added a touch of honey to the dressing. I also cooked the quinoa in broth instead of water. Tasted delicious. I have leftovers I'll eat for my lunch today. This is a keeper.

Loved this recipe! I served it with roasted chicken and my guests really enjoyed it.
I did add some almonds and dried cherries to make it more substantial for my vegetarian guest.
Great light meal or as a side! 
Will be part of my repertoire .

Really liked it. I added some grilled chicken for more protein. Only gave it 4 stars because it does involve a bit of chopping/ preparation. So not not your instant one-pot meal. But it's worth it when you can and you could even make some of the ingredients ahead. Great for hot summer evenings.

Delicious!  Used a bag of 'power greens' - Kale, swiss chard and spinach I believe, and we ate the entire bag of greens between the two of us.

Absolutely love this recipe and make it for company whenever I have people over to eat. It makes a great salad-lunch too. I use baby kale and just barely steam it. It doesn't keep in the refrigerator for long but it's rare I have leftovers.

Such a healthy and delicious salad. I made it exactly as written, but added more avocado (because I love avocado). Steaming the kale definitely took out the bitterness. Easy to add chicken to this to increase the protein.

Would have given it 5 stars, but too much salt in the dressing.  Otherwise I can't stop eating it.  I read the reviews and here are my changes. (No change to the quinoa).  I used the whole cucumber, avocado, and red pepper. I used 6 tablespoons of mild sweet chopped onion. 4 tablespoons feta.  I doubled the dressing ingredients EXCEPT FOR THE SALT. 3/4 teaspoon was not too much as long as you double the rest of the dressing ingredients.  I soaked the chopped leaves in hot tap water for about 10 minutes.  Then I drained them and followed others advice and massaged (kneaded really) the leaves with a few shakes of salt, then rinsed them. I also left out the pepper. It is a beautiful and delicious salad.  You could add chicken to make it a heartier meal.

Not a fan! Not sure why we didnt like it. The dressing had a very heavy Dijon taste, which I am not a fan of. I thought with the mix of lemon etc in there I would like it. I ended up adding honey to the dressing to combat the dijon, still not a fan. Its too bad, I was very excited about this recipe!

I was a little skeptical when I tasted the dressing before pouring it over the salad, it was really salty; so I did it in small increments. I ended up using almost all the dressing. It was very good! I shared it with my co-workers and they all really enjoyed it too. Thanks for an easy versatile recipe!

Delicious! Probably the best salad I've ever had. First time I cooked quinoa and it was much easier than I anticipated. *I used chicken broth instead of water.* I had it as a side with salmon but it was so filing it could be the main course. Great recipe- thank you!

Delicious. Didn't bother steaming the kale, just tossed it with the hot quinoa and that wilted it just enough. I used country style (whole grain) Dijon mustard. Used slightly less salt.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. My new favorite lunch!

This is great! I have never loved kale, but the flavor really didn't bother me because I the pieces I used were small and I really mixed it in. I used half the dressing initially and reserved the other half for drizzling over it when served. I also topped it with sliced avocado and tomatoes rather than mixing in with everything. I ate it over 3-4 days so this kept it fresh. I think next time I might puree some of the avocado and feta to change up the dressing. LOVE!

This is one of my favorite meals and it's so healthy. I leave out the feta to make it vegan.

Excellent! My husband was skeptical, but ate like 3 servings. We were out of avocado and I the cucumbers, so we deleted them.  Used red quinoa.  Flavor and texture was perfect. Paired with rack of lamb and gigantic beans.  Can't wait to try again with avocado!! Mixed together warm

You must be ok with dijon mustard to like this.

Delicious!!! There was a lot of chopping involved — but it was totally worth it. I threw in the whole avocado (it was small anyway—and I love avocado). Perfect. The feta/avocado balance out the red onion perfectly. I will be making this again.

Made a double batch last weekend and it was a big hit among my relatives, most of whom hadn't had kale or quinoa before. Made it for my SIL because she's a vegetarian and our main dish was meat.  Also made it for me because it sounded awesome. I followed the recipe except used spicy deli mustard because I didn't have any dijon, and I doubled up on the cucumbers and red bellpepper and added cherry/grape tomatoes. Can't have too many veggies. I did cool off the kale and quinoa before mixing in the rest of the veggies, feta cheese and dressing. I thought the dressing was going to be too mustardy, but it was perfect.  Definitely will make this one again and again. Thanks Stephanie!

Im a picky eater and was scared to try this. i made it for my husband to enjoy. however i tried it and I'm so happy i did! Because I'm such a picky eater I had to make a few adjustments. I did not add the pepper or onion and I did add some almonds. The salad was delicious!

I didn't happen to have feta cheese so I just cut up some jarlsberg cheese and put it in. I used baby kale which I just microwaved for 45 seconds. Also, I put in just a tablespoon of dijon mustard instead of 1 1/2.   The salad was delicious - my husband loved it and so did I.  I would definitely recommend it and make it again.

New to kale and quinoa, but I now am trying to find new recipes with them. This one has topped the other two quinoa recipes I've tried on here. Those are now 4-1/2 stars in comparison. :) I did serve with black beans on the side to garnish salad, as some of us don't like beans. It was great with or without them though.

Love this one. Only a few modifications based on what I had: added some spinach with the kale, used horseradish mustard, and cooked quinoa in chicken broth. Have enough for lunch tomorrow, too. Great!

Delicious!!  I substituted some of the veggies (I added cranberries and tomatoes since I didn't have pepper) and I don't eat cheese so I left that out.  For the dressing, I used less than 1 tbsp of olive oil and half the amount for the rest (lemon juice, etc.) otherwise that would make way too much dressing!!  This fed my boyfriend and I for dinner and we have leftovers!  Will be part of our lunch tomorrow too!  Very delicious, I'd definitely recommend it!!

This was out of the ball park delicious!  Made as is but added leftover edaname  and roasted garlic shrimp.  Just mixed everything together.  I did add fresh garlic to the dressing.  I forgot to add the avocado.  I doubled the recipe (there's only 2 of us) and I'm glad I did because I just had some for breakfast.  It will be gone by the end of the day.  As other reviewers mentioned, if you think that you don't like kale or quinoa it all just blends perfectly and is wonderful.  I also just added a lot more of the veggies.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, so yummy!  My husband is not a fan of avocado or cucumbers but he went back for 2nds with this one because the flavor combination was just that good.  Just as good, if not better, as a left over for lunch the next day.  Definitely going into the rotation in my household.

We loved this recipe.  I did add chopped tomato, but otherwise pretty much as written.  Loved it.

Although this recipe was good on its own, I added a Tbsp of honey to the dressing and cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. I think it added even more flavor.

So good even without quinoa. I have to mix the quinoa in for myself since the hubs doesn't like it.

i love anything with quinoa. this salad was good.
i found the avocado was a bit strange in this salad...i didn't think it went well w/the feta. i did not cook my kale, i just added it to the hot quinoa (it cooks it for you) 
the sauce; i was a bit scared with how much dijon mustard was required but it tasted quite good. 
thx for sharing this recipe.

I made this for my daughter's wedding shower.  She has many food sensitivities and this salad had all of the ingredients she could eat, except for the feta cheese, which we served on the side.  This salad is not only healthy, but it is delicious!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again. I did make a couple of alterations by adding fresh minced garlic and herbs de provence to the dressing and also tossed the kale in with the other ingredients instead of using it as a bed for the other ingredients. I will definitely be making this salad again!!

This is a superb salad! It is forgiving so if you are missing something you can add something else. I added chia seeds and garlic to the dressing as well as a touch of tahini, then tossed with fresh basil and mint.

I marinated the kale in lemon juice for a few hours instead of steaming it and added the quinoa warm to wilt it a little.  Also left the salt out of the dressing.  Excellent!

I love kale, but my husband is not a fan...until now that is. He says this is his favorite salad now. I changed up the recipe a bit.  I hate raw onions, so I left that out. Instead of cucumber I used jicama which gives it a nice refreshing crunch. I added in craisins. I didn't cook the kale; instead, I massaged it with some of the dressing. I changed some of  the amounts of the ingredients too, but that is just personal preference. Yummy and super easy to make.

Refreshing summer salad good by itself or served as a side.  Kept the kale raw and just massaged the dressing into the leaves before tossing with other ingredients.  Decreased oil by half and used the juice of whole lemon.  Also used a whole avocado, couscous instead of quinoa, sprinkled some goat cheese on top.  Thank you for delicious recipe.

This is a delicious salad! I increased everything except the dressing, to which I added a clove of garlic. I also added cherry tomatoes and green onion instead of red. Steamed the kale for about 20 seconds and it wasn't bitter at all. Super!

Delicious! I did not change any of the ingredients, just the amounts of the veggies since I did not want left-over cucumber or red pepper. I used the whole one.
Next time I will make the Quinoa a bit more ahead of time so it will have more time to cool (I put it in the fridge to cool but got impatient and mixed it in with the other ingredients while still warm. No harm done.) The dressing is awesome! Definitely a keeper.

This was great - perfect for my husband. I personally don't like mustard, so I'd like to find a way to make the mustard flavor less intense. I used a cup of quinoa and more pepper and avocado. It fed four adults including seconds.

I love this recipe. The flavor of the vinaigrette balances the kale perfectly. It is also easy to modify the recipe and just use whatever veggies I have around. It is always delicious no matter what I use. Super healthy and surprisingly filling as well. Thanks!

I am always looking for yummy ways to make kale and quinoa taste good and this was amazing! I am on my third batch in a week of this. My hubby hates "healthy" food such as kale, quinoa etc and even he loved this. I used less olive oil than it called for and it was still fabulous.

Delicious and healthy! I had to substitute chopped fresh spinach for the kale and still great. Vinaigrette is yummy!

I have never tried kale and thought I would dislike this recipe. I am so thankful that I decided to take a chance and make it! I was pleasantly surprised and loved it. I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!!! I didn't change a thing. I agree with LizzyMcGizzy that the flavor combo is brilliant!!!
