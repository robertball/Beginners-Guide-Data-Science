Based on other reviewers' comments that the original recipe is somewhat bland, I made three adjustments. 1) I marinated the chicken for 20 minutes in Greek salad dressing. 2) I saut√©ed onions with the mushrooms. 3) I sprinkled feta cheese on top when I served it. I followed the rest exactly, and it was DELICIOUS. This was a pretty easy and healthy one pot meal. I'll definitely make this again.

I omitted the chicken and used bone broth.  This tasted wonderful, and I will definitely be making it again.

I will try this again; however, I will make some changes because it is quite bland.  I will add more walnuts and basil and reduce the mushrooms.  I used plain couscous then added parmesan.  So maybe a little more parmesan and a pinch of salt?

This truly is a great base recipe to enhance. I didn't have arugula, but I added more chicken, a couple handfuls of frozen red bell pepper after the chicken had cooked a bit and added a dash of curry powder and some cayenne just before I added the couscous. It turned out wonderfully. I loved the walnuts in it! I will definitely make again. Perfect for a weeknight.

Decent meal, a little bland.
