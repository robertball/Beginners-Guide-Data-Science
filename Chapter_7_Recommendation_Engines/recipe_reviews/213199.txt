This tastes great but I don't like frying so I baked it. It was great. I used instant loaded baked potatoes and added shredded cheddar cheese to mix. Covered the baking pan with a thin layer of olive oil.  Placed coated chicken strips on pan  bake on 350 degrees for 10 min then turn chicken over bake another 10 min.  No frying and it was loved by the whole family.

Just tried these for the first time, they are possibly the best chicken tenders I have ever made.  I used "Idahoan Roasted Garlic" mashed potato mix which is better tasting than many of the others. I ended up having enough to cover two lbs of meat, but they are so good that was fine with me. Next time I will cut the salt back to 1 & 1/2 teaspoon, but other than that I love these! Thank you for posting. :-)
PS  I used a light olive oil, worked great.
**Update, just made for second time.  Added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder & 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the flakes.  They were even better.  After removing chicken, you can pour the left over milk in the frying pan, add flour & make gravy.  Yum.

These turned out FANTASTIC! Everyone in my house loved it. I actually didn't use garlic flavored. I just used buttery flavored instant mashed potato packets. It was good without all the garlic in my opinion. They were crunchy, juicy, and perfect!

I made this and it turned out great.  Also. my own little twist on 2nd batch--I deep fried and instead of potato flakes I used crushed corn flakes, also good.

I made this and it was delicious. I didn't have packaged mashed potatoes, so I used a cup of potato flakes and added a tablespoon of garlic and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. I also double breaded by dipping in flour before the milk mixture. I used just 1 cup of milk and while a lot was left over, it made the drenching easier. I might use a bit less next time, but not much.

This recipe interests me because of my diet. I don't combine grain products with meat. This means I never make crusted chicken bakes.  However, potato flakes are not grain! I'm looking forward to using this idea in more recipes.

Wish I could give this more stars.  It deserves at least ten because of how easy it is.  I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it.  Will be making this many times in the future.  Next time I think I will use only one cup of milk with the egg as I had a ton of milk left over.  Thanks for a really great recipe.  Mary Jane

This was delicious. No changes needed! Although I did forget to add the salt and pepper...
Update: Made this again tonight and it was just as good. I'm going to try this on flounder next.

This was great! I've made this twice now & the family LOVED it. I used only 1/2 package of flakes each time & it was more than enough. 1 1/2 c milk was also more than necessary if u don't want to waste milk. The second time I forgot to add the egg & it still came out good. Adding additional spices to the flake mix is also a possibility, depending on your taste, but by no means necessary. Thanks! We will continue to enjoy this recipe!

these were a BIG hit with my family.  I used butter flavored instant potatoes and it was great to have that hint of butter when you took a bite.  My family was shocked to find out that it was instant potatoes!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have used this recipe on chicken, venison, and fish and there are never any leftovers. I have always used Italian bread crumbs and flour, but not anymore. Now I pick up packets of instant potatoes every time I go shopping.

Great recipe and easily modified! There are a variety of ways to prepare this. But, the first thing I will note- cut the milk measurement down!! You'll end up with too much left over, just to be thrown out. I used 1 egg and only 3/4 cup of milk (plus or minus, as needed). I also added some additional seasonings/spices to the dry mix. A little bit of cayenne pepper can easily make this similar to buffalo style chicken strips! The spices for the dry mix just depend on your taste preference. I also have used flour instead of mashed potato mix (I think flour works better). If you are using mashed potato flakes- WATCH THE OIL TEMP! Too high, and they will burn before they are done cooking through. I prefer using the powdered garlic mashed potato mix, or 1 cup of flour- either one, I still add additional spices/seasonings for flavor. But as other reviewers have posted- DOUBLE DIP BEFORE FRYING!!! Start by coating the chicken in the dry mix. Transfer to liquid mix, dipping enough to coat it well in the liquid, then re-dip & coat it in the dry mix before placing it in the frying pan. This should ensure that all pieces are fully coated, less likely to burn and will remain 'crispy' instead of soggy or the coating falling off. 
This recipe also works well to cook pork, fish and even veggies! Great base recipe, easily adaptable! Thank you for sharing. :)

Excellent! Best breaded chicken ever! I wound up with extra potatoes and milk/egg, but it was just a great excuse to thaw a few more tenders. This is a must have!

These were down right delicious and super easy! If you have an electric fryer you can drop them in there making it even easier. The potato breading has so much more flavor than plain old flour. I see no excuse for fast food drive-in chicken mc nuggets which contain who knows what in them when there is such a recipe to be had. Give a try. You won't be disappointed.

Loved this.. Altho you do have to watch the temp of your grease on this one. I found that it more easily burned when using the potato flakes than with just flour

Although I don't require a gluten free diet, this is an awesome gluten free option that I will tell my sister about.  You'd never know it wasn't breadcrumbs--except that it tastes much better!  (Only change I made was to add garlic powder since I didn't have garlic potatoes, only butter flavor).

They were okay... needed more seasoning and were kinda soggy...could be chef error, though.

These were great! Got Kroger brand garlic mashed potatoes, added some rotisserie chicken spice and extra garlic - will definitely make these again.  I think I'll try baking them next time.

My family loved these, very tasty!!  Followed the recipe exactly (used Great Value Roasted Garlic instant mashed potatoes) but next time, as other reviewers, I will use only about 1 cup of milk and less salt.  And wish I knew a way to keep more of the breading on.  Other than that, they were still delicious and very easy!

These were my first attempt at chicken fingers and I just loved how they came out with the instant mashed potatoes.  I added some butter to the oil for frying.  I cut the milk down to 1 cup.  My box of instant potatoes was 6.6 ounces with 2 packs in it so I used both but that was unnecessary, one would have been enough.  I cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne to the mix and a 1/4 cup of grated parmesan.  I floured, egg/milk mixture then potato flake mixture and I did let the breaded fingers sit for 15 to 20 minutes before frying and had no problem keeping the coating on.

Delicious and gluten free! I followed the recipe using buttery Yukon potato flakes packet then added garlic powder and kosher salt. There were enough flakes to coat at least 10 chicken tenders. I am unable to have anything with gluten in it and finding new ways to fix old standbys aren't always easy. My entire family LOVED these, even better than the floured version. Thank you for the recipe!

Super easy, super quick, and super delicious. I've used this recipe twice now, and I intend to many more times. The second time I added ground cayenne and chili powder to give it some kick. Yum!

This was excellent!!! I changed it a bit by adding garlic powder and parmesan cheese to the flakes as suggested by another viewer. I dipped it in the egg mixture, dry mixture, egg and then dry again, then frying it. It was really tasty. My husband loves it that way. Thank you

My chicken frying technique needs some work, but this still turned out really good.  It went quickly and my husband wanted more when it was gone and he HATES instant mashed potatoes.  Now I can justify keeping them on hand! Thanks!

Excellent flavor and very easy to make.  I followed recipe exactly (w/ canned milk b/c I had some).  Next time I will save some flakes to make mashed potatoes b/c the amount of wet and dry ingredients is way more than enough for 1.5 lbs of chicken.

Loved this! The only changes I made were I added 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. I don’t particularly like to fry so I baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes each side, adding shredded cheese on top after flipping. Absolutely quick, easy, and amazing meal!!!

Good oil needs to be higher than medium for good crunch.

really good, very easy. I would use less milk, and cut back on the salt, though. I took the extra egg mix and potatoes, mixed them together, then threw them in 'plops' on the skillet for hush puppies.

This is really good.  Chef Ann Burrell  uses potato flakes for breading.  To the reviewer "luvtobake"  just fry in shallow oil to brown and then bake to cook the rest of the way through!

Loved the recipe! Giving it five stars because I know, if cooked properly, it would be delicious. I am not the greatest cook and I have a fear of pink chicken so I tend to overcook it, which on these I did. But even with the -tiny- burned flavor, they were delicious!!
As reviewer Paula H. recommended in her review, I added grated Parmesan cheese to the potatoes (which were sadly buttery herb because I am low on my emergency supply!) and it definitely accented the chicken very well.
I do believe that most of the issues with the burning on my tenders was because I double coated them and my heat was just a *wee* bit too high! This is definitely going to become a regular in my house because it's easy and tasty!

Next time I might try baking it just to see how it compares.

Wow was this good! So easy too. I used chicken tenders and added garlic powder and parmesan cheese along with the salt and pepper (just eyeballed it) to the potato flakes. I pan fried them in a mixture of canola oil and butter. My husband couldn't believe how good they were for something so simple. Served them with creamy pesto fettuccini. Leftovers tonight will be dan's favorite chicken sandwich from this site. Bacon, cheese, bbq sauce and ranch. Yum. I'll probably add lettuce and tomato too. Can't wait!

I tried this and read one review where it was baked (healthier) , so I tried that and the tenders never browned.  I had to "doctor" them up by putting them in a pan with some oil to make them pleasing to the eye,  They tasted ok, but wouldn't do that again.  I would do them again, but from the beginning fry them.

Not bad. Nice flavor. Way too much milk and potatoe mixture left over. Will probably try again but next time I will try double dipping. Found some of the batter did not stick too well.

This recipe is very good. I made some of chicken tenders with garlic potatoes and some with the buttery ones. My family loved both of them.  I also double dipped some of them which added a thicker coating. Definitely will make this again.

Love, love, love this chicken! I tried it with both chicken thigh strips and cut up chicken breast (thawed frozen Tyson chicken). I used butter & chives potato flakes and added garlic powder and battered with skim milk and egg whites.

My Mother has been making this chicken for over 35 years.  Not with garlic flavored potato flakes though. That saved a little more time then season myself.

My new go-to chicken tender recipe! I would have never thought of using potato flakes but it turned out to be crunchy and tasty and all three of my sons went crazy over them. Next time I’ll reduce the salt a bit because it was a little to much even for this salt lover but I’m not complaining. There was nothing left when we finished supper!

It was very moist and the coating didn't fall off!  Like some others, I used 1 cup plain potato flakes and added 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, garlic powder and pepper.  The family really like it and it was easy to make.

I added Parmesan cheese to the potato flake along with paprika, less salt, no pepper, and garlic powder. Used only 1/2 cup milk and one egg. Very very good. Used chicken thighs to keep it juicy.

Easy and quick, so good. I used plain dried potato flakes because it was what I had but mixed in garlic/Italian seasoning, etc. Came out tender and delicious. Cooked in olive oil with a little sesame oil.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is one of my husband's favorites. I follow the recipe exactly, using Idahoan Roasted Garlic potato mix. They always turn out so good!

My family really enjoyed these tenders. I didn't have any garlic flavored potatoes so I used four cheese flavor and added garlic. They turned out great. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

The only things I changed was loaded instant mashed potatoes and I used a Catalina dressing with brown sugar and soy sauce. It's was awesome.

Good recipe! The chicken is moist and flavorful. I only ended up using about the amount of milk/eggs and dry ingredients though. A little goes a long way.

These were FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC! Seriously, we couldn't stop talking about how we won't make breaded chicken any other way! I think we perfected this recipe with such minor changes-left out the salt since the instant potatoes are usually high in salt & double coated the chicken (egg batter, potato, egg batter, potato). This helped the coating stick really well and used up all the batter ingredients!  These had a nice crisp potato pancake-like coating, a thin layer of mashed potatoes and juicy chicken inside. Hands down a real keeper. In fact I'm going to make it again tonight with a different flavored potato package! And I think these would be perfect with a chicken gravy on top.

These were a hit with the family. I stuck with the recipe and directions. Oil temp is very crucial to the breading sticking to the tenders but yet not burning. This is something we will be making often as the kids enjoyed it so much and it is super simple to throw together last minute. Variations of flavors are also endless which is also nice.

Very tasty. I hammered out the chicken a little bit and cut in nugget size. I also left out the salt (the potato flakes have enough for me). The ones I ate were delicous. The rest went into the freezer.  I've been looking for a homemade nugget recipe and think I found it !

Think you for a really great recipe. Turner out moist and very light and crunchy.
I was making some Harvard beets at the time and used some of the sauce for dipping and that was nicely different, but really good,
Thanks, JC16
