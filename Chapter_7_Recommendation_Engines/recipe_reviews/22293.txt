Super.  Not for everyone howerver, Bu wasn't enthused.  This recipe has a scent of bitter flavor and may not be something that kids or picky adults would go for.  If you like walnuts then I'm sure you'll appreciate this.  I used the exact ingredients it called for and it came out great.

I'm into Toasted Orzo, so add the orzo just as onions and mushrooms are finishing, when orzo is lightly browned add the broth.  When the broth is absorbed add 1/4 cup grated parmesan and serve! Yummy!

I have made this a few times now, and keep tweaking it as I can't ever leave well enough alone.  If I can find it, I use a package of mixed mushrooms (porcini, bella, oyster, etc) that I found in my grocery store.  I also add some sauteed spinach, minced garlic and sherry to it, to give it some zip.

I made the recipe as written, and it made a ton. I will definitely cut the recipe in half next time.  I'll also omit the walnuts.  They did not compliment the dish at all and stood out oddly among the ingredients, texture and flavor-wise.
Also, I'll turn the heat down while cooking the onions and mushrooms.  The "medium-high" heat was a bit too hot and my dish ended up with a slightly scorched flavor because of it. With these adjustments, it will be a delicious side dish.

Evident that this would be flat in flavor if prepared exactly as written, I added white wine, minced garlic, and fresh thyme and parsley.  I also used a specialty orzo and substituted pecans for the walnuts.  All and all, this was an acceptable "supporting role" side dish.

Very good recipe -- easy and impressive to make. The texture and flavor turned out a lot like risotto without a lot of stirring.

I was extremely pleased with this recipe.  My entire family enjoyed--even my 7 and 2 year old who are really picky. I may add a little  bouillon next time to increase the flavor.

Thanks for the recipe...or atleast the guideline! Unfortunately I didn't have walnuts (they sounded like they would have been delicious in this recipe)...so I did some alterations to kick it up a bit!  Added a stalk of celery with the onion and mushrooms, as well as 2 cloves of garlic and a 1/4 red pepper for color.  When it was done, I found it a touch bland (wish I would have had those walnuts) so when I found some feta cheese in the fridge, decided to toss that in (about 1/4 cup)...that really did flavor it nicely!  All in all, a nice dish (even with my alterations).

Great texture, makes an ample amount...but very bland in taste.  It was very edible, but just not memorable or something that we will make again.

I made the recipe as directed and love it - it's flavourful enough and one ought not to be surprised from the ingredients list that it doesn't kick or pop or anything.  Makes a wonderful side dish or even an entree!

Now this was fun, and if there were a way to do 4 1/2 stars, that's what I'd give it. It does make a lot, but was well-received. Next time I make it, I think I will add some lemon zest. This would best be served with a spicy, full-flavored meat or other entree, since there is no one flavor that stands out in it.

Since my husband doesn't like walnuts, I substituted pine nuts and sauteed them with the onions. Very good and great with an italian chicken dish!

My first comment is that unless you are serving a really big group you should scale this recipe in half.  I scaled in half, served 6 and had plenty left over.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written accept I added the orzo to the onions and mushrooms after they had cooked a while so that the orzo could get a little toasted before adding the broth.  I also added some minced garlic at this point and reduced the amount of mushrooms.  Just before serving I stirred in about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan and topped with the walnuts.  With these changes it was pretty tasty.

Yum, that's all I can say.  I didn't find white mushrooms, so I used portabella.  Therefore the sauce was a little, shall we say, gray.  But the flavor was awesome!  It was a little too involved to cook on a regular basis, but I made it for our anniversary and we both enjoyed it.

Right before I added the chicken broth - I added the orzo to the mushroom/onion saute' (with a TBLS butter) and let brown/cook for a few minutes. Therefore, I had NO problems with the orzo cooking - it came out good. Our only problem - we just couldn't get past the walnuts! We like them in plenty of baked goods but we just picked them out in this. Thanks anyways!

This is a very flavorful dish that I served for New Years Eve.  Made it ahead of time, then warmed in oven.  I cooked it for 20 min. initially instead of 15, and all the liquid was absorbed.  Yum!

This is a great base recipe that can be customized to your own taste. To add a little more flavor, I added a little garlic, fresh sage, and crumbled blue cheese.

My husband and I LOVE this dish.  He is a vegetarian and I do add chopped fresh baby spinach and Feta cheese sprinkled on at the end.  I half the orzo/broth for the two of us and it is the perfect amount. Great texture and filling!

So delicious!!  I added 2 cloves garlic (simmered with the onion) and I think the flavor it added was key.  I also added 10 oz frozen (fresh) spinach leaves.  Be sure to toast your walnuts before using; a few minutes in a pan on the stovetop works just fine.

This was a nice change for a side dish.  I added celery to the veggie mixture.  I forgot to add the walnuts and I'm sure it would be better with them.

I have made this several times as a side for many different dishes.  It is always well received.  I sometimes omit the walnuts.  It is just as good without.

Enjoyed this dish.  Followed the recipe pretty closely except sautéed the mushrooms separately from the onions (added some minced garlic too).  I also added some chicken sausage that I baked first before adding it to the orzo in the last cople of minutes of cooking. Great dish, will make it again for sure!  Really would have made it a 4.5.

I am only giving this 4 stars because of how much I added to the recipe - I can't really comment on how it would be as directed. After reading other reviews, I added chicken sausage, garlic and kale. I also kept out the walnuts and I reduced the orzo to 1 cup. Here is what I did it and it  was a big hit ...  I caramelized the onions and garlic in a large stainless steal covered pan. I then added a 12 oz package of  spinach and garlic chicken sausage from my local grocery store until browned. In went the mushrooms (about 3/4 lb) and I also added a small amount of kale cut in small pieces. I added 1/2 cup cooking sherry and boiled all of that down until kale and mushrooms were tender.  I then added 2C broth and 1C orzo. I ended up needing about another 1/2 -3/4 cup broth to finish the orzo - but it might have been due to the heat being too high on the stove.   This was our main dish, served with some rustic bread - it was wonderful!

This orzo is excellent - easy yet elegant. It can be a tad bland though, so I was heavy-handed with the salt, and also added garlic powder and parsley. I over-toasted the walnuts by mistake (about 15 minutes) and they were actually wonderfully crunchy.

This was really easy to make and the result was delicious, as someone already mentioned, the texture is similar to risotto. I used zucchinis instead of mushrooms and it was still delicious. It makes a nice variation.

I replaced the walnuts with pine nuts, and it was scrumptious.  We had this with braised lamb shanks (also found on this site), and the combination was outstanding.

This dish is so good.  It has a light flavor to it that will compliment any meat.  I wasn't sure how the walnuts would taste but I was pleasantly surprised at the subtle flavor they gave and how well it worked in.  I did have to add in more chicken broth than stated though as the orzo was still hard after the liquid had absorbed..no biggie.  Will be making this again!

I substited rice for pasta and L O V E D it.  My very finicky 6 year old lked it also.  I had all the ingredients on hand, and the walnut sweetened only a little; enough to not want salt.  A   D E F I N I T E  must try *****

This was an excellent side dish!  I added celery in addition to the onion and mushrooms and it tasted great!  I also added some herbs and spices to kick it up a bit.

I made it just as-is and it was delicious. I couldn't stop eating it even when I was full from dinner. My husband, who has this thing about not liking orzo (i think it's the texture?), anyhow, he loved it and said this recipe was a keeper.

This was a hit in our house. Will use in the future. We substituted the oil for cocoanut oil. Next time we will add feta and spinach to it.

I read the other reviews, and agree this is basically a very nice recipie.  I added a good amount of salt (about 1 tsp) and pepper (about 1/4 tsp), as well as 1/4 cup grated parmesean with the walnuts.  Also added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke to bring out the walnuts and mushrooms.

I loved this recipe!  I used organic mushroom broth instead of chicken, organic wheat orzo, and shitake mushroom.  Would be a proud Accompaniment to a special dinner.

I LOVE orzo and this one was pretty good but not one that stood out (as i have made several orzo recipes from AR) Followed the recipe exactly. I sprinkled the top with walnuts instead of tossing together.

This is a real crowd pleaser, I took the advice of some other reviewers and added frozen chopped spinach and fresh garlic.  I took it to a family dinner, and there were no left overs and everyone asked for the recipe. I also made it with chopped artichokes and that was also delicious.  There are so many things you can do with this recipe.  I will definately make this again!

Yummy.  I always add chopped fresh herbs, a splash of sherry, chopped celery, roasted red pepper, grated parmesan, etc. (kind of whatever I have on hand.)  This most recent time I tried it with quinoa instead of orzo, and it still worked well (and it MUCH healthier!)  I will serve this to my clients with grilled chicken or salmon.  Thanks for the recipe and the ideas!

This recipe was fantastic! I did make a few changes, per my own tastes and the suggestions of others. I used portabella mushrooms, thinly sliced, garlic, basil and no-chicken broth for vegetarian reasons. I also toasted the orzo before setting it to simmer. Came out great, and was very flavorful. I will defiantly cook this again.

Wow!  This was incredibly delicious and a keeper!  Quick and easy to prepare. I prepared the walnuts and chopped onions and sliced mushrooms earlier in the day and then just prepared the dish 15 minutes before I was ready to eat. (I cut the recipe in half for just my husband and myself for Valentine's Day dinner).  I served it with a Greek salad with homemade dressing.

This was a nice tasty dish to compliment the chicken I made.  However it did take a lot longer for the orzo to absorb the liquid, about 40 minutes.

I thought I had everything I needed, came time to cook, I did not have orzo..
I substituted arborio rice, kept everything else the same.
It worked very well!
Easy to throw together with a surprizingly different flavor for the few ingredients!

I served with a steak that had a blue cheese sauce. good compliment of flavors!

I cut the recipe in half, maybe it was the rice, but it sure made a lot!!

I made this for a lunch for 40 people.  It doesn't look very tasty, but I thought it was pretty good.  A lot of people were not sure exactly what it was.  I served it with Anniversary Chicken and green beans.  Most of the adults ate all of it.  The children didn't eat as much.  I didn't think it was bland as others have said.  It is an understated side dish that compliments a richer main course.

Made this twice.  The first time I didn't roast the walnuts until they were aromatic and it was good but the 2nd time I forgot about the walnuts until I could smell them and I thought they were burned but... they were great! I also added spinach the 2nd time.. wow, made a great dish even better!

Really really good!! I halved the recipe and I thought it still seemed like a LOT of muchrooms but it was perfect. Like someone else, I added some spinach (fresh) and it was very pretty and tasty. My kids were not thrilled that it had mushroooms but one bite and they all happily ate it. By the way, I used whole wheat orzo, since it is healthier than normal orzo and it tasted great. There was no "you tried to make this healthy" regret! Thanks!!

I made this for company as a side dish and it was really good, but if I make it again, I would add garlic to the onions and mushrooms and definitely more walnuts.  The 1/3 cup did not make much of a difference because this recipe makes a large amount.  I would love to add chicken to this and make it a meal.

I didn't have any walnuts to add to this recipe, so to give it some more flavor I added a clove of fresh garlic, a 1/2 tsp of red hot pepper flakes, and added 1 pkg frozen chopped spinach at the very end. The recipe also calls for a lot of chicken broth, so instead, I used 1/2 broth and 1/2 water. With all the changes I made, the dish still came out very good as a side or a light main meal. Definetly a keeper.

My husband and I really liked this.  I only made half and had some leftover.  The best part is that you can add whatever you have to it.  A few minutes before it was done, I added fresh broccoli and closed the lid, so it would steam.  I also added some garlic to the onions and mushrooms.  Next time, I will probably add more mushrooms, since they really simmered down, and I love mushrooms.

My boyfriend and I made this for V-Day and it came out great.  We halved the recipe and served it as the main dish. I used porchini mushrooms, vegetable stock (to make it vegetarian), used toasted pine nuts, added some minced garlic, and added fresh parsley at the end.  The dish was awesome but not too heavy and I plan on making it again.

I made this recipe last night I cut the recipe in half and used baby bella mushrooms along with yellow onion.  After 15 minutes cooking time there was still a lot of fluid in the pot so I removed the cover and continued to cook for about 8 more minutes and then served. My husband and I found it to be mushy even with the nuts and rather bland. I have not cooked orzo before and this may be the correct consistency for this pasta dish, however I would not make this one again.

Moist and yummy but everyone was right about how much it makes.  I halved the recipe and it still almost filled my dutch oven.  Maybe half the recipe for 4-6 people.  The walnuts are definately neccessary, though, would not have been as good without them.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever got.  My husband first cooked this for me on Valentine's day, and I was so impressed.  Since then we've cooked this for our guests many times, and everyone raves about it.  It's always their "favorite dish tonight".  Just love the flavor of orzo, mushrooms, and toasted walnuts.  Definitely cook the orzo with smaller flame to soak up the chicken broth.

I Knew this would be mild going in and would need some help. I used red onions and lots of pepper and salt. Got some great ideas from reviews as how to turn up flavor. Some people screwed up recipe by using water and such. Of course it will be bland.  Overall dish came out with nice consistency and adequate tasste, but my next attempt will have some flavor tweaks

I could tell that this dish was going to be on the bland side as I was cooking and tasting it, so I began adding more flavoring.  I added a few dashes of lemon juice, and some poultry seasoning.  That helped a lot, but overall it was still not a terribly exciting or flavorful dish.

This was very, very good. I'd say it's more like 12 servings as a side dish. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and added a bit of garlic powder with the salt and pepper.

I made this dish as a main course and it was good but it definitely would benefit from a salad or something on the side to balance it out.  Overall I liked the flavor and will make it again, but probably more as a side dish.

I didn't have 1lb of mushrooms, so I used what I had. I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms in white wine before adding the broth. I used a low sodium broth, so initially my orzo didn't taste like much. I threw in 2 cloves of pressed garlic, a dash of garlic powder, and some freshly shredded parmesan cheese and it turned out GREAT! I will definitely make this again.

Very good! I personally felt the chicken broth flavor was too prominant--then again, I used a Chinese chicken broth, so its a bit different? Orzo is good--makes me want to find more recipes with orzo!

I forgot to add the walnuts.  This was still really good.  It would make a nice side for a dinner party.  I thought it would be too salty with the chicken broth, but it wasn't.  I think the walnuts would be good and make it even more gourmet, had I remembered them.

3.5 stars. My modifications: 1) I used just enough oil to coat the pan, a tablespoon or so. 2) I omitted walnuts since I wasn't sure how well it would match with the other ingredients. 3) I added half a bag of chopped spinach for more veggie content. It went well with seared tuna steaks, but it was a little rich for me. Next time I would use half broth and half water, and add pine nuts if I have them.

Yum! Everybody loved it!  And it's so easy to make.  I made some minor tweaks: used only one onion, substituted pinenuts for the walnuts and added  minced garlic.  Next time I'll add chopped parsley and truffle oil.

I added a cup of chopped spinach to increase the vegetables, which turned out really well.

I made this for V-day with the Champagne Chicken from this site. They were both great! I used one of the previous suggestions and substituted pine nuts for walnuts. We really enjoyed it - I just made WAY too much - oops!

I had never made Orzo before, but this was excellent. Served it with Champagne Chicken from this site and the two went well together.

This was very yummy. I halved the recipe and left out the walnuts, husband doesn't like nuts in entrees. After sauteeing the mushrooms and onions, I added the orzo, sauteed a bit and then added the stock. There was still liquid after 15 minutes, but simmered with lid off for about 5 minutes and came out wonderfully. I might add some fresh garlic next time. Really good as leftovers the next day. Nice change from rice or potato side dishes. Will make again.

Great recipe!  I reduced the oil to 1 Tbl. for lower fat.  I think I would use only 1 onion next time - was a bit too oniony for me.  Other than that, I would certainly recommend it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great side dish for a meal!  I did have to add some water to the orzo while cooking because it was still hard after it absorbed all of the chicken broth.
