I wish I could say I loved this, because I like everything that's in it! Five minutes made them too brown from an aesthetic point of view.  I also felt that the Kalamata olives overpowered the artichokes, and I would have preferred the other way around!  If you can master the proper cooking time and balance the flavor to your personal taste, I can see that these would be a nifty sandwich filler, or take the place of a starch on the plate.

I had the most success when I cooked the cakes in an extra tablespoon of oil and in a Teflon coated wok at a heat setting of medium high. Before doing this, the cakes did not hold their shape, stuck to the pan, and fell apart When time to remove them.  Very tasty veggies and I love the combination of flavors! This is one of the best veggie recipes that I have!

I'm a complete novice cook and I did these tonight they came out pretty good even if I do say so myself. Some nice sweetness with the outer crunch
