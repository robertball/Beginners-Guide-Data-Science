We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this pasta! I did make a major change though...I used fresh spinach in place of the kale, b/c we just do not care for kale, at all. We added some chipotle powder (and grated parm instead of the Mexican cheese blend) to the top at the table b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for my girls, and that worked fine. Everyone cleaned their plates, so that makes this simple, healthy dish a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

My partner and I really enjoyed this! I subbed the kale for spinach and reduced the chipotle powder to 1/4 tsp because my five-year-old has very little tolerance for anything spicy. I also used bowtie pasta made with veggies because I didn't have any rotini at hand. I didn't have any garlic salt either, so I used two tsp sea salt and subbed the regular olive oil for garlic olive oil.

It was fast and yummy and I will be making it again!

We really enjoyed this!   I added red, orange and yellow peppers and a few sun dried cherry tomatoes from my garden.  I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth.  Those of us who don't do dairy sprinkled a few pecans on top instead of cheese.

This pasta is filling and wonderful. I added sliced grape tomatoes, which made the dish colorful and complemented the kale and garlic.

I actually enjoyed this dish. I did add garlic and some other veggies I had in my fridge to bulk it up and give it more variety and I used Parmesan cheese instead of reg cheese. It's something you have to make to your liking but it's a great base recipe that you can add to and alter each time you make it. It was the first time I ever had wilted spinach/kale which made the first couple bites a little weird texture wise but after I got used to it I loved it.

There seemed to be something missing. It's not that it tasted bad, it just didn't have a whole of lot taste despite the ingredients. Like another cook, I substituted spinach for kale. I also used whole wheat rotini. Maybe more cheese if I make it again.

I made this and served it over quinoa instead of pasta. It did taste good but we weren't jumping for joy.

Even my picky 15 year old son gobbled this up! Next time I'll put in extra kale as it whittled down to nothing. I didn't have the chipotle so I used cayenne. Perfect! Will make regularly.

Yummy!  I mostly used the idea (used spinach, home canned navy beans, etc), but it was fabulous!

I thought it was very good! Easy to make.  Take note it is spicier than I would have thought.  Will make again.

I made this tonigt and added extra kale and I used chili powder and paprika in place of the chipotle spice listed bc I had those on hand. It turned out great, we loved it and I'm glad I have enough left over for tomorrow!

I was delightfully surprised at how much I liked this recipe. I will definitely make it again with only some slight changes. It was a bit spicy for me, so I would take the pepper down a notch. Also, I used kale and only wished that there had been more! I'll probably double the kale next time. Very good!
