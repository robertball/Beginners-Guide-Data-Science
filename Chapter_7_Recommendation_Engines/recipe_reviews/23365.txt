I made this dish for my VERY picky in-laws and they loved it.  I ended up modifying the recipe and I think that helped make it so good. I used italian bread crumbs instead of plain ones and I also mixed a 1/2 teaspoon of cyanne pepper with the breadcrums for a little more spice.  Also, I added 2 teaspoons of minced galic and I chopped up 2 red bell peppers to add another flavor. It was great and I was requested to make it again for Christmas dinner!

This dish went was gone before it hit the table. I did some changes though.
Did not skin the squash,added fresh chilies to boiling water ( instead of canned), and mixed the cheese into the dish, topped with bread crumbs. I did not quite feed six of my family but I think that's because it was so good. The best recipe gives you the basics to have fun with ;)

I was in an eggplant mood and wanted to do something different than the usual. I tried this recipe but I was disappointed. Cooks would have better luck substituting brocolli or spinach for the eggplant. The minute I read "boil" the eggplant, I had doubts. But that is just me; I love this quirky vegtable but it must be either panfried or oven baked at high temperature. This recipe is not a total failure, it smells good and looks inviting all brown and crunchy on top- I just prefer my eggplant anything but boiled. Thank you anyway.

I don't even like eggplant and I loved how this turned out! The boyf loved it too. I went with some of the reviewers and amended it a little: added cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs (not sure how much, just dumped a good bit in there), used zucchini instead of yellow squash (and didn't peel it), and instead of boiling the squash and eggplant I sauteed them with the onions and some garlic, along with pepper and some other seasonings. I only had one small eggplant so it didn't look like enough stuff - so I threw in one chopped raw red bell pepper, tossed it all up with the green chilis and put the crackers and cheese on top. Topped it off with a few sprinkles of paprika and baked it. The cayenne gave it a nice kick!

I was pleased with this recipe's ingredients, however found it to be bland.  I would maybe add flavored bread crumbs to the mixture, along with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  But, overall, enjoyed the dish!

I didn't have bread crumbs and chilies, so I used crushed melba toast and tomatoes, basil and oregano.

The end result was delicious..and I would not have ever thought of it without the base recipie!

I also use Italian bread crumbs, jalapenos instead of chilies and put in some roasted peppers along with Italian seasoning and chopped garlic. The reason I liked it was because it is like stuffing but better for you. I well make the again.

This is easily turned from nutrient-deficient into a healthy, hearty casserole!! Saute the eggplant, onion and squash in a couple tbsp of olive oil with fresh garlic, salt and pepper. Don't skin the squash, all the phytonutrients are in there! Bake topped with whole wheat panko mixed with fresh parmesan and parsley. Fantastic.

It was good, but not enough flavor even though I had added garlic and onion powder.  We had to add salt after baking.  Perhaps the veggies should be cooked in vegetable broth instead of water.

Initially I was a bit skeptical about this dish--eggplants?!, not a big fan--but I decided to give it a try since I already had the other ingredients on hand. What I did--took this idea from another poster-- was saute everything (eggplants, squash, onions, bell peppers, and garlic). I did NOT add chiles--can't eat spicy foods :(. I made sure to season everything after sauteing for about 10min. on low. Then I poured everything into a baking dish and added mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese on toped with bread crumbs. I used seasoned breadcrumbs; and baked for about 20mins. This dish is YUMMY and its healthy as well. Hubby approved; so its a winner in my book.

I'm sorry to give a bad review, but this really wasn't a good dish. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use crackers in the topping. The eggplant/squash/bread crumb mixture was bland and soggy. Sorry, this just wasn't very good.

This was a delicious combination and could be made using various veggies.  I Added a chopped red pepper that needing using and microwaved the veggies to tender crisp to keep in more vitamins. Was out of breadcrumbs so used half a bag of seasoned cornbread stuffing, and didn't use the crackers on top. Yummy!

This was an excellent recipe idea.  I sauteed my veggies - didn't have time to boil.  I used home made bread crumbs - made from croutons I had made previously...so my bread crumbs did have traces of olive oil in them.  I also used these on top instead of the crackers.  I added 1/3 cup water to the baking pan about halfway through (at the edge - not to mess up the topping).  This is a great recipe - because I can add whatever spices I want!!!!!  This was excellent!  Thanks a bunch!!!!!

I sauteed the eggplant (peeled), squash (unpeeled), & onion in olive oil. Added cayenne pepper to the mix. I used Panko bread crumbs and did not use the green chiles. I also substituted Parmesan for the Mozzarella.

Like the other reviews suggested, I amended the recipe. 
I sauted the veggies in a pan with butter, 1/2 a cube of chicken boulion, 3 cloves garlic, salt, italian seasoning, and 3 packets of crushed red peppers.

Then I poured the mix into the baking dish with Italian bread crumbs, and topped with crushed four cheese italian cheese-it crackers (didn't have any ritz or butter crackers) and topped with cheese...Not lacking in flavor anymore, and every one loved it :)

I sauted my eggplant and squash with the onions and added some seasonings then once I mixed everything up it looked pretty dry so I added a can of chedder cheese soup then topped with the crackers and chesse.  It was yummy. My husband's parents and grandparents were over for lunch and everyone enjoyed it, even my 2 nieces (8 & 6) and my daughter (5)!  Will def make again.

We made ours with fresh Hatch green chilies, crushed Vegetable flavored crackers, and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella sprinkled with French's Fried Onions on top.  Yummy!  My husband requested this dish on Thanksgiving instead of green bean casserole.
I gave it 4 stars because I changed alot of the ingredients and don't know what it's supposed to really taste like.

This was okay. I enjoyed it, but my boyfriend did not. Make sure to cook the eggplant the same day you buy it. I will try again and not use as much bread crumbs.

I went to the farmer's market yesterday and could not resisi picking up a couple of BEAUTIFUL eggplants that were there.  They had been picked that morning and just as pretty as they could be.  I got home and decided that I wanted to turn one of them into something new.  Something I had never made before.  Here it is, the perfect recipe!  I had also picked up some yellow squash and some unbelieveable zuchinni, well, because I just HAD to!  They were at their VERY best and you just DON'T walk away from stuff like that! :-)
When I read in this recipe that yellow squash was also an ingredient needed, I HAD to make this!
I was also making something else from this site which required me to roast my veggies in the oven, so I simply did the same to these beautiful ingredients.  The result from that alone was AMAZING, but once I put the rest of the dish together, it was INCREDIBLE.  The freshness of the eggplant and squash perfectly roasted was undeniable.  The rest of the ingredients brought the entire thing into a lovely dish that I am sure won't be around long enough for me to have to put away tonight.   It's ridiculious how good this really is :-) Nice job!  Thanks for sharing!

I was kind of skeptical about this dish because it called for boiling the veggies. It turned out great and I also think it could make a great Turkey stuffing.

I changed it a bit - I didn't peel the squash & used a 3oz can of chopped green chilis - used one cup of club crackers crumbs total - 3/4 in mix & 1/4 on top w/ cheese. Used 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and 2 tbs of parmesan on top w crackers crumbs. Loved it. k

I set this recipe for 6 servings. As I was mixing the ingredients, the mix seemed to be getting very dry so I left about 1/3 of the breadcrumbs out. It still came out dry. The flavor was quite good, but am not quite sure why it came out that way. I would try it again, maybe adding more vegetables or something for moisture.

Just average.  If you want to cover up the taste of your eggplant and squash with breadcrumbs and cheese, this dish is for you.

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could.  I thought it was just okay, a little lacking in the flavor department, but not a bad way to use up an eggplant and extra squash - almost like a variation on squash casserole.

Made this recipe following exact instructions and was very dry.  Would not make this again.  I should have known when many reviews referred to the recipe as a dry stuffing.

I used stuffing mix after seeing several other reviews.  I thought it was a good recipe.  Definitely a nice change from the typical eggplant recipes you see.  I will probably add other vegetables in the future.

I used Italian mix cheese and left out the chiles.  My husband loved it but I think using Italian bread crumbs and leaving off the cracker would have been much better.  Overall it was a success.

I used jalapenos instead of the chiles, chopped peppers and seasoned bread crumbs as suggested and my favorite spices.  My 19 year old son made a unsolicited compliment regarding this dish.  I would try it again, but I thought it was too much like stuffing.      Will try less breading to make it healthier.

I did not make any modifications--and--it really is pretty bland.  I don't think I'd make again.

OK...rating this recipe as described......doesn't taste like anything. If I was to use any more salt my husband would have to change his blood pressure medicine. I think that if I make it again I would add more cheese and definately mix it up with some spices so that it tasted like something other than boiled veggies.

We thought it was pretty bland, I usually read the reviews, but this time I didnt. The reviews are very helpful.

This was very good.....I "doctored" it a bit....seasoned crumbs are a must and I added a little parmesan cheese, cayenne and black pepper....a little drizzle of bunner over the top didn't hurt either.

I really liked this recipe - I took out the chiles, added red pepper and used zucchini instead.  I also sautued the veggies in EVVO with 3 cloves of garlic and some season salt. The concept stayed the same.  It was a little dry with the bread crumbs (I used italian), I think next time I will put a couple more pats of butter.

Good flavor. But needs spiced up a little. Very bland.

I made this recipe and I loved it. I did however make a few changes just because thats what I had in the pantry. I used Italian breadcrumbs and a soy cheese instead and the recipe reminded me of a healthier stuffing. Definently worth a try!

I agree with one previous reviewer, if you want smashed crackers and cheese on top of your delicious veggies, you'll love it. I don't quite get the cheese and cracker part and am not sure why I let the other reviewers convince me that it was a good idea. RUN!

This was so delicious, took it to Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit.   There wasn't any left for seconds.

Made this with homegrown eggplant from a friend and yellow squash from MY garden. Followed the recipe except substituted a cheese blend of grated jack and cheddar since I didn't have mozzarella.  Used crushed Ritz crackers.  90 yr old mom and I found it to be dry and tasteless.  Didn't want to waste 2/3 of the leftovers so served it next day with homemade Turkey gravy on top with sliced turkey breast.  That made all the difference and reminded us of our traditional Thanksgiving side of scalloped corn/broccoli casserole.  I probably will not make this dish again.

I added some sweet Italian sausage that I had browned on a skillet.  The taste wasn't bad, but it was very dry.  It definitely needs something to make it more moist.

Made this as a side dish using Panko bread crumbs and crushed Ritz crackers. It was a tad bland, but still very good. Will use more green chilis next time and maybe a little more cheese.

This was scrumptious! I altered it a little from reading some reviews. I sauteed all the ingredients and included mushrooms and Kielbasi sausage. It was difficult eating it at first because I didn't want to wait for it to cool down! I for sure will make it again.

This is a fantastic summer recipe for your garden goodies.  There were a few things I did differently.  I did not precook the squash or eggplant.   I used red pepper flakes instead of green chilies.  I also added two eggs and mixed in the cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  I baked the casserole for 45 minutes at 350.  Came out delicious!  Even my non-veggie lover husband liked it.

I found this recipe very disappointing. I followed all directions and it came out undercooked and tasteless.
