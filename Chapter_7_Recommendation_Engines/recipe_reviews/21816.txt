This is very easy and quick to throw together. My kids loved it. I also added chopped green olives. A great loaf to serve along with soup, or for when you have a house full of teenagers

Surprisingly bland considering the number of ingredients.  Would benefit from 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. salt added to dry ingredients to enhance flavors. Also would slightly increase amounts of pepperoni and mozzarella.
