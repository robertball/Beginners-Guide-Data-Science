Wow! this is so easy and so versatile. You could use many combinations of cheese and seasonings. I added a few cloves of minced garlic to the butter mixture and baked it about 30 minutes tightly covered. Thanks for sharing Tonja!

Keep cheese cheesy, don't overcook.

It was a fun dish for a football game.  I would tweak it the next time, using gruyere instead of swiss, and trying shallots instead of green onions, and I used garlic salt instead of celery salt. I skipped the poppy seeds because I didn't have any.  Also overcooked it...it did not need the time allowed in the recipe.  The bottom ended up over-done.  I didn't think it was going to be very popular but it was gone by the end of the game.

I took this to a New Years Eve party and it was a hit! I didn't have celery salt so I used garlic salt and it turned out delicious! I also used a combination of monterey jack, mozzarella, and swiss cheese. It only needed to warm in the oven for 30 minutes. Great, easy recipe.

This was super good!  I also liked that it was a little different from all of the other appetizers.  I made a few changes to go with what I had & what not: 1) couldn't find sourdough, so used an Italian loaf. 2) Added in some garlic powder to the butter mix 3) used a little less than 1 lb of cheese. A little of this for sure goes a long way, and I don't even want to know how many calories I consumed but it recieved good reviews at the Halloween party I made it for tonight.  THANKS FOR SHARING!  :)

great recipe but doesn't need 1 hour ... just 20 to 25 minutes in a preheated oven :-)

We've made something very similar to this for years.  The differences with our version: use a 1lb loaf of Hawaiian sweet bread, add 1 tsp garlic salt and a tsp lemon juice.  Our version also uses a whole cup of butter, but I always thought that it was too much.  I can tell you that this is wonderfully addictive!  I look forward to trying it with the sourdough for a change.

The  Swiss didn't  melt well. Maybe substitute some mozzarella? Also cut the bread as far through as possible so you don't have to fight to get it apart. You can probably reduce the poppy seeds some for the same effect.
