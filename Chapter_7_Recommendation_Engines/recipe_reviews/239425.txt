The recipe is missing an ingedient - it is a vinaigrette salad, but there is no vinegar in the recipe!  I added 1 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the dresing recipe.  I also added some sliced fresh strawberries, which gave it a nice contrast to the dijon mustard and the maple syrup.  Definitely a keeper, with the mods.

I also took a suggestion from the other comments and massaged the kale before adding the squash mixture.  Made it very tender.

My husband and I loved this salad.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions by decreasing the amount maple syrup and simply drizzling it over the squash (about 2 tbsp), doubling the dressing, and adding one tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the dressing.  I also used olive oil and increased the amount to equal the amount of maple syrup.  So yummy!

I did not like this recipe.  The butternut squash was too mushy, and the kale ended up being way to wilted for a good salad.  It also had too much red onion. The vinaigrette was delicious.

It was a favorite at our Thanksgiving table. I made some changes. I roasted the butternut squash with olive oil, salt, pepper and saut√©ed garlic. For the dressing I added fresh squeezed lemon, olive oil, & substituted maple syrup with honey, since I don't care for maple syrup. I finished it with salt and pepper to taste. I tossed the spinach and kale mix I had with the dressing first and once the butternut squash cooled a bit, I tossed it in with Feta instead of parmesan. Don't toss the sake til right before serving for best results.

Loved this recipe.  I left the maple syrup out, makes it low carb. Squash is sweet enough.

I have a confession to make...I have never had kale before making this recipe, and I loved it! We really enjoyed this salad. I did cut back the 1 cup of maple syrup down to just a drizzle (maybe 1-2 tablespoons at most). I can't help but think that the 1 cup is an error, as the squash would have been swimming in syrup had I used the full 1 cup. I ended up doubling the vinaigrette, because after making it as the recipe stated, it just didn't look like enough to coat the salad, and I'm glad I did. I would also slice the red onion a little thicker next time, as some of them burned before the squash was roasted. With these changes, this is a 5 star recipe, and one that I look forward to making again.

I love kale and this recipe is filled with healthy, delicious ingredients, but this just didn't do it for me or my husband.  I think maybe it was just too sweet.  The kale would have benefitted from a bit of massaging, too, I think.
