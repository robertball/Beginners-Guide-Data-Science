Excellent! A nice change of pace and I loved the addition of black pepper. Don't omit it! I have a pantry full of flavored balsamics, so I ended up using chocolate balsamic and it was perfect. Next time I will try it with espresso balsamic. A very simple dessert, but I can see how it would wow guests! Thanks for the great recipe Sunny!

First time I saw a similar recipe (it didn't have the chocolate) I thought there was no way it could be good.  Oh boy, was I wrong!  Now this one has chocolate added?  I'm in heaven!

I used high end balsamic vinegar, and shredded dark chocolate on top.  I made it in the morning.  Just before serving, I mixed the chocolate in.  Severed over brownies (made from this site) and ice cream.  Yummy!

I made this recipe because it sounded so strange that I had to try it.  I couldn't imagine this mix of ingredients could be edible, let alone good.  It's delicious!!!  I intend to make it for dessert for an upcoming holiday.  The pepper really makes it great, so don't hesitate to use it.

Yummy! I liked the tang of the the balsamic vinegar and its not too sweet. Complements the strawberries. Thanks for sharing.

I've made variations of this for years.  It's even more refreshing if you partially freeze the strawberries before you dress them.  It's really great on a hot afternoon by the pool.

Awesome dish!  I have made this for my granddaughters teacher luncheon and it was a tremendous hit!  I have to say, it is an odd combination but a combo that truly does go well together.
