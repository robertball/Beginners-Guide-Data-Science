We are not normally squash eaters. We ended up with some butternut squash from some family members and thought we would try it out. We have never cooked it before but we are adventurous. WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I have 5 kids and almost everyone had seconds! We did not even have to double the recipe for our family of 7; it was perfect. We did not have any farfalle pasta on hand, so we used Rotini instead. Everything else was as the recipe called, except I used extra garlic. I swear, if this recipe doesn't taste good to you it is because you didn't season it to your taste as it instructs you to do. Excellent recipe and we will use it again!

Maybe I didn't give this recipe a fair trial because I changed 2 ingredients - I did't have Barilla's Farfalle and I didn't have Percorino cheese. I used shell shaped noodles and Parmesan cheese and mozzarella. 

I followed all the rest of the recipe until it said to put the noodles in the sauce. What sauce?! There isn't a sauce that was made... So I added stewed tomatoes.

What I made tasted great.

I actually made this recipes exactly as printed.  I enjoyed the Pecorino but it was twice the cost of fresh Parmesan which was a shocker.  I believe it would be better with smaller pieces of the butternut squash.  I found most had not cooked long enough.  I would have liked more zucchini too.  When I had leftovers for lunch the next day I sprinkled more cheese on it.  It is a strong flavor so I was careful not to add too much. Also, I did not have fresh oregano but I felt the dried worked fine.

DELICIOUS!  I added sun dried tomatoes and used feta instead of pecorino.  I first orasted the squash with the onions.  I added this to the pan sauteed zucchini.  It was a light and delicious meal my whole family loved!

Delicious! I added some turkey sausage for more protein boost.  My husband loved it and the recipe made enough for leftovers the next day.

I tried this on friends last night and it was delish!  Small changes - I cooked the pasta in half-and-half water and chicken broth, added some red bell pepper, and substituted fresh Parmesan for the Pecorino.  As for the sauce that many find missing, it is formed by the starch and sugar from the squash blending with the olive oil as you saute it.  Try sauteing your vegetables in a wok to better concentrate the juices.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made the recipe as written and had some suggestions.  The amount of pasta should be halved or the rest of the ingredients should be doubled.  There is no sauce despite what the recipe says.  I added more pasta water and fat free half and half to try to sauce up the dish.  I also increased the grated cheese.   To keep it vegetarian, I browned and broke up Gimme Lean Sausage substitute (14 oz. bulk meat free sausage) in a separate pan with a wooden spoon and then added it the pasta.  It made it more of a one dish dinner but my family was not that enthused with this recipe.  Will probably not make it again.

This recipe was very bland. I added some cream,butter and Parmesan cheese just to give it flavor.

This was very good. A few other reviewers noted the lack of sauce. This is not supposed to be a "saucy" pasta. I made a few tweaks to mine: I used fresh sage instead of oregano, fried and then crumbled on top with the cheese at the end (I also used Parmesan); added the zucchini first so it would get softer; and added 1/4 cup of chicken broth once the squash were cooked, this helps add a little moisture.  I used frozen butternut squash pieces - much easier than trying to chop up a fresh one!

Bland. Would taste better if used more spices, or added stock or stewed tomatoes at the beginning. Half the recipe.

There was no 'sauce' created even tho I followed the recipe to the T. The butternut squash overpowered the zucchini to make it an overly sweet dish.

Very disappointed in this recipe as it doesn't have the "sauce" it mentions. I had to add lots more seasonings and cheese to get a better flavor.  Love the ingredients but that missing ingredient spoiled it for me.  I'm not that creative to improvise.  Boo!
