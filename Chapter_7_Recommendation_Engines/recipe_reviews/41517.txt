such a GREAT snack.  You can change up the spices.  I served this with spinach dip at Christmas, and everyone LOVED it!

Dipping the bread into the butter made it too greasy so next time I would just brush it on.

The finished product is delicious, but the bread kind of went crumbly on me when i tried to stir it. Fine by me since I used these for more like croutons, but if you want all of it to be chips... Half of mine turned out into half chips or herbed crumbs....still great flavor and diea though.
