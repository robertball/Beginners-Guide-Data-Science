Recipe Group Selection:  22, March 2014 ~ Loved it!  We liked everything about this salad.  I used mini rotini pasta and I had Roma tomatoes on hand, that was my only substitution. I mixed everything up and let the ingredients marry for about 30 minutes before serving.    The avocado adds a lot of flavor and texture to this salad, so don't be tempted to leave it out.  We thought a little onion would add additional flavor to this salad.  I served this with 'Biscuits with Blue Cheese' from AR and we had a delicious meal.  Thanks, Lane J for sharing your recipe, it is a keeper.

I found this pasta salad using the AR ingredient search tool. I had a chicken breast leftover from grilling to use up, so used that instead of rotisserie chicken. I do make my own Italian dressing and really loved the addition of mayo for a creamy tasty dressing and the amount was perfect for the ingredients. I only had six slices of bacon, but it was plenty for us, and the avocado was a nice addition also. I'm sure I'll make this one again since we all really liked it.

Recipe Group Selection for March 22, 2014 –   I’m always looking for a complete and satisfying one dish meal during the hot summer months that is not only appealing to the eye but to the taste buds as well.  This recipe is faultless.  The combination of flavors marries well without competing with each other and the different textures add to the complexity.  I’m delighted this was selected for the Recipe Group because I may not have noticed this recipe, thus missing a dish that will be a regular in my summer meal rotation.

Made for Recipe Group. Lovely main dish salad. The combo of mayo and Italian dressing made it taste like Ranch. Hubby got introduced to an avocado which he says he has never eaten before. Used some chunks of Monteray Jack cheese and tri-color rotini. Pretty and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

To my homemade Italian salad dressing, I added 1 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. cumin. To salad, I added 5 green onions, chopped, 1 bunch cilantro. Substituted sharp cheddar cheese for muenster. HUGE hit with 6 adults (4 of whom are my kids/girlfriends). Definite make-again! Thanks for a great way to use chicken!

Delicious and easy one dish meal! Loved it, I added some shredded romaine lettuce and maybe next time I would like to add some thinly sliced red onion oh and I used roma tomatoes and monterey cheese because that's what I had in the fridge. Thanks Lane J for sharing your recipe!

Recipe group pick that I made late but had to try. I halved this and we got almost four servings (2 dinner, 2 lunch). I had to mix it up a few hours ahead of time and didn't use all of the dressing because it looked like too much. The dressing pretty much disappeared into the pasta so I served the rest of it with the meal. Next time I would not dress it ahead of time just so that I could possibly use less. My only subs were homemade dressing, vegan mayo, and sharp cheddar. I think we would try this again as is and also as a lettuce salad instead of pasta.

Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED this salad! I used a 12oz. box of tri-color rotini, and omitted the celery. I used all of the other ingredients, but sort of eye-balled them to taste. The whole family gobbled this up...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used aged white oak farmhouse reserve cheddar and veggie spirals and cut down on the bacon. I omitted the celery since I didn't have any bit will most certainly try it with the celery next time! I added 2 chopped avocados since we love those. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe :)

I thought this had good overall flavor. It did remind me of a club sandwich. It is pretty salty though. Also, it is a bit more expensive and time consuming than I prefer for a pasta salad. I did like that it wasn't all watery like I have had trouble with some pasta salads that I have put in the fridge. My husband really seemed to like this pasta salad. I supposed because of all of the add ins. I had to sub mini mozzarella balls for the cheese, because my grocery store did not have block of the munster. I think the cheese in the recipe would have been better for added color to the salad alone. I used a tri-color rotini and think that was a good choice. It ended up as approximately 2 cups of dry pasta. I used a box of pre-cooked bacon, 1/2 cup of the celery, and 1/3 cup of green pepper, which was what I had. For the dressing I used regular mayo, which may have helped with the non watery issue, and Paul Newman's family Italian dressing. I added a pinch of sugar or two as the dressing was a bit more bitter than Kraft Italian. I think, 2 avocados would have been good to in this. ty

This was a big hit for a teachers' back to school dinner.  Did make some changes though.  I used Cardini's Cesaer dressing and eliminated celery, bell pepper and avocado.  Substituted frozen peas for the green color.  Going to try with tortellini the next time. It can be thrown together quickly and doubled, tripled and beyond easily.  Great find.

Excellent, I have made this several times and always get rave reviews!  I use different cheeses, whatever I happen to have on hand, also add chopped fresh spinach and onions.

Nice hearty salad. A meal on its own. For my taste, I would probably reduce the salad dressing by half next time -- it overwhelms the ingredients a bit.

I will definitely make this again! I just sliced the avocado as a topping, because it's not something that can make as left over, mixed into the pasta. It was a great use for store bought rotisserie chicken!

Loved this!!  I used Gouda cheese instead of Meunster.  My husband is NOT a salad man, so imagine my surprise when he said to me, "You were right, this salad is amazing! Wish I had more in my lunch to eat.  You need to make this again."

Love this pasta salad. I make it with or without the avacodo depending if I have it on hand. I always substitute the muenster cheese with half Monterey Jack and half sharp cheddar. It's always a hit and is my go to pasta salad.

My husband and I had to hold ourselves back from eating a second plate! This is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except didn't add the avocado since we didn't have any that were ripe. For the dressing, I used Ken's Steak  House Lite Caesar and whisked it with mayonnaise made with olive oil.  I think the avocado would be tasty and hope to add it next time.   This is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Yumm-o! I was looking for a summer salad to fit the ingredients I had on hand. I did not have Italian dressing so I subbed Ken's ranch and added about 1/2 T dried Italian seasoning. Family loved it!

This was a big hit with friends when I served it I only used six slices of bacon and it was definitely enough! I mixed all the ingredients with the exception of bacon, tomatoes and avocado the day before . I actually used my own dressing since my husband is not a fan of mayonnaise! only used enough dressing to hold the ingredients together. Everyone loved it and I will make it again!

Good recipe.  However, I think it's way too much dressing.  You can get away by making less of it.  Also, try adding red and yellow peppers

This was delicious and everyone loved it! I used about half of the dressing and next time I might try cheddar. I’m definitely making this again!

at first I thought I wouldn't like it but after I made it. I was surprised how good it was. I had to double the recipe...lot of people to feed. The dressing was nice, I used grated cheese instead....turned or very good.

A little rich with the cheese and dressing, but overall good. Great way to use up some vegetables in the refrigerator. Light summer meal

This is one of the best things I have made from Allrecipes.  The only thing I didn't add was the avocado, only because it did get ripe in time, but it would probably have been great as well.  I added a bit more bacon because, let's face it, how can you go wrong with more bacon?  This is great for a party, for dinner, for a snack.  It is really addictive.  It goes into my keeper file.

I made a 1/2 recipe because only my husband and son were going to eat it. My son didn't get any. My husband went back for seconds. He really liked it. The only change was that I did not have celery so I left it out. Otherwise - great recipe that uses basics I always have in the fridge.

Nice flavorful pasta salad that could even serve as a main meal! Great change from vinaigrette dressing pasta salads, which my Gluten Free pastas tend to absorb too much resulting in a dry salad. Since my bell pepper and avocado went bad, and I didn’t have any celery, I used cucumbers (chopped) and fresh broccoli (cut into florets, lightly steamed). I cooked the bacon in a separate pan. Reserved 1.5 tbsp bacon grease to cook 2 chicken breasts (cubed; seasoned with salt and pepper, garlic, onion, paprika, and parsley) on saute mode in my instant pot. Added 3 cups chicken broth + 12 oz Gluten Free Penne, manual for 4 minutes, but pasta wasn’t done so cooked for additional 2 minutes. Used cubed, Cabot brand LF/GF, cheddar cheese. Delicious salad that gets better the longer it sits! Next time I’ll make just a little extra dressing to add in. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!!  Made this as a side salad without the chicken, bacon and bell pepper.  Used cucumber in place of the bell pepper because of allergies.  It was fantastic!  I'm looking forward to making again with the chicken and bacon.

Great recipe!  The only thing I did different was fry diced chicken breasts in some of the bacon fat instead of using a rotisserie chicken.

I'm cooking for my daughter's wedding this July. I wanted something new but easy enough to make ahead. This recipe is just the ticket! The dressing is 2 basic ingredients that come together in under a minute. The store bought rotisserie chicken can be bought up to 3 days ahead, cleaned, cubed and ready to toss into the salad. The veggies take a little bit of time to prepare but those too can be cleaned and cut days ahead when stored properly. I think our guests will be surprised and love this recipe!

Outstanding! I didn't change anything but I did times and a half the recipe so it lasted a wee bit longer than I had thought. Everyone loved this, which I served with homemade garlic bread. I'd recommend it for potlucks, too, as it's quite rich and a small portion suffices. I'm making it again for 4th of July.

Left out Italian salad dressing; used dry Italian spices instead.  No avocado.  1 T onion.

Best pasta salad I've ever made.  Even 'picky eaters' loved it!

OH MY! This is so yummy! i just made it and haven't even let the flavors combine in the fridge yet. 
I meant yo make tge recipe as written but... I left out the bacon as my husband's preference. I substituted Monterrey jack as that is what I have on hand. I accidentally added 3/4 cup mayo instead of only 1/4 cup. A tasty mistake!
I think this would be great with the addition of some onions and more avocado.

Loved this recipe. Of course, I never have all the ingredients on hand so used cheddar for the cheese and had to do without the avocado since I didn’t have a ripe one, but it still tasted great. I agree that the dressing with the mayonnaise was key, and the salad kept for several days for lunch.

As written this was ok but pretty bland.  I found myself scrambling at the last minute trying to up the flavor factor before serving.  I threw in 1/2 cup of ranch dressing, 1 tsp ground black pepper, and 1/2 tsp dill.  After changes my family raved about what a keeper this was!

This is actually a very good dish to make but I had to search for a separate recipe for Italian Dressing myself because I personally try to avoid processed foods, including dressings.  I would have given this recipe a 4-5 Star ranking if Allrecipes included a homemade Italian Dressing in this particular recipe or a hyperlink to one from your own inventory of recipes.  BTW, I substituted crumbled Feta Cheese instead of Muenster.   

I am in favor of one-stop shop for main courses and side dishes. As a professional chef, I think many home cooks would agree with me and appreciate that feature on this website. Thank you.

I  really liked this.  I made one major change.  I do not like Italian dressing, so I subbed Poppy Seed dressing for it.  This added a good, sweet flavor.  My family truly enjoyed it.

The 30 minutes must assume you have everything pulled/prepped/chopped because the actual time was about 3x that. Was not flavorful, and leftovers had to be thrown out because the ingredients did not keep well (specifically avocado, bacon) overnight in the refrigerator.

One of the best chicken salads I have ever made.  The ingredients to make this salad are a little pricey buts it's worth it.

We made this 2 nights ago and finished it today. It's a good pasta salad for a base. I found it didn't have enough flavor, but that could be the Italian dressing we chose. We left out the ham since it's not something we are big on but everything else was in there. A good salad.

Absolutely delicious.  Didn't change a thing in this recipe and it was great.  Didn't have rotisserie chicken a couple times I have made it so just cooked up some chicken breast pieces, in a little seasoning, and it is great.   I do keep the avocado out and serve on the side so it doesn't brown the next day though.

Love it! I doubled the recipe except I used the same about of bell peppers, celery, and avocado. I cut them in very small pieces using my chopper and I used Zesty Italian dressing from Kraft. And I used cheddar monetary jack cheese. It's delicious even coming from someone that doesn't like celery and avocados!

Both my husband and I just loved this salad.  Made a great summer dinner.  I can see as a great addition to a pot luck.  I had Tuscan Italian salad dressing and I really think it worked better.

Open season Italian dressing powder mixed using 1/2 cup red wine or Apple cider vinegar 1/4 cup of olive oil & 1/4 cup water, chilled & shaken well is best. Also I'm not a fan of bacon so I use diced Turkey (ham) & diced sharp cheddar cheese instead. Refrigerate overnight. Perfect summer main dish (if u add cooked, shredded chicken breasts) or as a side item!

Tried this out as a good idea for hot summer nights as a cool dinner dish. My family LOVED it! I usually make a double batch as it tastes better as leftovers when the flavors really meld. I usually use leftover grilled or baked chicken (whatever I have) to make it and it comes out great. The only thing I change is leaving off the green pepper because we don't care so much for it, and I don't mix in avocado unless we want it. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Cooked my own chicken tenders and omitted the avocados because I was afraid they would turn brown with leftovers, but the salad is amazing.  Will definitely add it to my "potluck" folder.

This was great. A little pricey for pasta salad but I wanted a special recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except left out the avocado since I was serving it the next day. I wasn’t sure how the avocado would do overnight. If I was serving this at home, I would definitely add the avocado right before. I was also surprised how good the mayo/Italian dressing was. That may become my go to for pasta salad. Super easy. My Italian dressing said zesty.   Loved this.

Easy and delicious! I substituted the Muenster for Monterey Jack, the corkscrew pasta for bowtie, and left the bacon out. Would definitely make this again for a potluck or just to eat at home! The avocados add a great texture to this dish. You want to make sure the mayo and dressing are mixed really well because they look a bit weird and are prone to separating at first. Overall super happy with this recipe, thanks!

Very good. Took forever to chop bec I'm not a pro. Used newman's zesty Italian for obvious reasons and profits go to charity, gluten-free and needed a quick fix for a retail job. Added a little red pep for extra kick, some small diced ham and scallions. Full meal.

It’s good, I like the mayo and Italian dressing combo. You can basically throw in whatever you like. I added Italian seasoning. I have made a similar recipe with ranch dressing, this however has a nice kick! Will definitely make it again. Great way to use up left pasta. Ok

Awesome!  The prep work is worth it! Just the right ratio of all the ingredients. Feel free to use low fat mayo and Italian dressing. This is a good make-ahead recipe, although the avocado does turn brown after a while. Still tastes great.

The only thing I did differently is to omit the avocados. They deteriorate too quickly for only two of us. I would also recommend using a cheese other than muenster cheese as it really doesn't have much flavor. I will be making this again.

I have made this 3 times and each time it is wonderful. I used Orzo pasta, made my own italian dressing, used fresh motzarella, pancetta instead of bacon, two avocados, green onions and the rest of the ingredients. did not disappoint.

This was delicious! I did make minor tweaks to it. Since I didn't have any Italian style dressing, I made it with Hidden Valley salad dressing mix. I don't like celery and had no avocado on hand. So I doubled my Muenster cheese cubes to make up for it. I would love to make it again with actual salad dressing and avocado.

I left out peppers, celery and bacon (didn't have bacon handy). I added some ripe olives. It is basically a good salad,  but I would add more flavor next time such as onion powder and maybe some herbs

Excellent just by the recipe. The following day I did add a couple of tablespoons of Italian Dressing.  Even better....

This pasta salad was amazing!! I omitted the celery because I didn't have any. I also didn't use the exact measurements the recipe called for. Added parmesan cheese at the end. My picky five year old loved it too. Will definitely be making this regularly!

not my thing.  ended up bland (maybe too much chicken) and dry.  I'm still not an avocado fan apparently either.

Followed the recipe using tri-color pasta, Monterrey Jack cheese (suggested substitute) and Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing - all on hand.  I added the avocado just before serving as it made a lot of salad and I didn’t want avocado sitting in the refrigerated leftovers.  Great recipe - my husband loved it.  Unless I’m making it for a group I’ll halve the recipe next time.  Thanks for a lovely entree salad recipe!

I was looking for a newer update to the same old cold pasta side dish when I found this recipe.  I made my traditional pasta salad but used the italian dressing/mayo dressing from this recipe and it was AWESOME.  Perfect update for my tired salad (tri-color bow tie pasta, mushrooms, bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, red onions, hearts of palm, celery).  The little bit of mayo gave more substance to the traditional italian dressing without turning it into a mayo based salad.  I served it at a couples wedding shower and doubled my receipe.  Needless to say, it didn't last long at all!  Guess now I have to try the recipe it was written for!

Wonderful dish that received rave reviews at both parties I have made it for. The first time I made it as written and it is absolutely delicious. The second time I doubled everything but the “sauce” and bacon, omitted the celery and used sweet peppers in place of the green peppers. Again it was delicious. I mixed the pasta, chicken, peppers and cheese with the sauce hours before I planned to serve it, then added the avocado, bacon and tomatoes just before serving. (The key for me was waiting until the pasta was absolutely stone cold to add the sauce. Yes, I realize warm pasta will absorb the sauce and take on the flavor, but then it would have needed even more sauce and I was trying to watch calories in an already heavy , but delicious dish!). I will be making this again, especially for picnics, cookouts and neighborhood block parties!

I like this recipe. I made a few changes. Used green onions instead of celery and I cooked chicken with liquid smoke and next time I will not use mayo. It made it too sweet.

This was sooo awesome. I substituted chopped black olives for the avocado and instead of cherry tomatoes, I used rotel tomatoes with chilies. Scrumptious!

we were very disappointed with the results of the salad. we did not care for the dressing at all. I thought it would be a nice cool salad on a hot day. my husband thought the salad would be ok with a different dressing. I will probably try fixing it again leaving the mayo out.

I must say this recipe is Greatness!! The only change I made was to increase the Italian dressing and Mayo by a couple of tablespoons of each. Since I cooked a 12oz box of Rotini noodles and used a 1/2 of a rotessorie chicken. You cant go wrong with this one.

I didn't make any changes. I thought It was a good recipe. I will make it again, but  I wight experiment a little. It seemed a little dry the second day.( Might need a little more wet ingredient. ) Some lemon juice,maybe.  
   Overall ,I liked it.

This was amazing ! I cooked chicken instead of using rotisserie because I had it on hand and my avocados were bad so I skipped them but otherwise followed the recipe. This could easily be substituted as well. Pepperoni for the bacon, I used Colby jack instead of Monterey, and anything else you can think of. Definitely going to repeat making this !

Using ingredients on hand, I substituted regular tomatoes for the smaller ones and used Edam cheese.  This will become a regular favorite.

We loved this! I didn’t omit anything but I did add chopped red pepper, yellow cherry tomatoes and black olives. I used the Zesty Italian type dressing. We enjoyed this as a week-night meal. Makes a large amount...easily would serve 4-6.

I skipped the cheese and green pepper! Also, I added turkey bacon instead of bacon.

Great salad! All my family loved it. The only substitution I made was using egg noodles instead of spiral pasta as that’s what I had at home.

This was fantastic!  Made it last night for hubby and myself--left out the avocados, as neither one of us care for them--and it made a wonderful supper for a hot summer night.  Had some today, and it was even better after all the flavors had melded together!  This is going to be a favorite, for sure!

I have been wanting to make this recipe for awhile and finally did and it was so good!  It did take a bit of time to put together.  So making a big batch to eat over a couple of days is ideal.  I did add in some chopped onion, a dash of garlic powder, and some parsley.  For the dressing, I used half italian dressing and half of a bacon cheddar ranch dressing to make it creamier.  When I think of a chicken club, I like it to be nice and creamy.  So I did need to add in a little sour cream.  The recipe is delicious as written with the italian dressing.  But next time I will probably just add less than half of the italian dressing and add in more mayo/sour cream/ranch combo to get the creaminess that I am looking for, just my personal preference.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese since I didn't have any to cube up.  This was a delicious recipe as written and I will just make a couple of tweaks next time to make it perfect for us.  Thank you for the recipe!

I took out the bacon and green bell pepper and substituted with cucumbers and red onion. I also used Zesty Italian dressing and had the Munster cheese and avacodo as garnish. I love it! It's a hit.

I substituted ziti for the corkscrew noodles because it was what I had on hand. It was a good choice because all of the other noodle salads at the potluck used the other one. I also used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon and doubled the amount of green bell pepper for color and crunch. It was a hit!

I made this salad just like the recipe reads with the exception of adding  an avocado. There wasn't any ripe ones at the market .

 It's 90° out today and the salad is perfect for this weather it's also very appealing. I will be making this  salad often throughout the summer months. 

I may add some sliced red onion the next time. Yum.

I doubled the recipe for our weekly family dinner and it was a huge hit! I substituted green onion for celery, and used gluten-free pasta at my daughter's request. I'll definitely make this again and again throughout the summer.

I made a few changes. Didn't add the celery or green pepper because I had none. Used marble cheese instead of Munster. Also added leftover hotdogs to try and use them up. I just chopped them up really fine. Kids loved the salad!! Would make again!! Nice flavour!!

Very good dressing for the Pasta salad. Easy to make but if you make it too much ahead of time I find the pasta soaks up all the goodness.  Next time I will make 1 and a half times the recipe for when make it ahead of time :)

My family loved this recipe. Add what you like, omit what you don't. I don't like celery, so I used green onions. Huge hit at potlucks and family gatherings.

I made a few changes - made my own ranch dressing.  Used Mozz., not Munster.  Cellantani for the pasta.  Came out great - a keeper.

I liked this alot and so did everyone else. I have onion rather than celery fans here, however it was a little over powering. Will stick to the recipe and to hell with them. Lol. Good job on this one, is like a meal on its own.

This is being added to my summer salads!  Fresh and yummy, good mix of flavors and the small amount of mayo tones down the italian dressing and makes it stick to the pasta. Definitely a keeper!

Made this over Labor day Weekend.  It was a hit.  The only changes I made was using mini pasta bow ties and leaving out the bacon and cheese (one of my guests doesn't like cheese and I didn't have bacon)  I also added about 3/4 up of diced zucchini.  This would make a wonderful lunch all on its own.

I've always been leery of pasta salads either the dressing doesn't stick or they're just plain bland.  This was a great recipe that I can use over and over again.

I made this according to the recipe except I used medium cheddar and my family loved it!  My five-year old asked for seconds, and then he asked if he could have it for lunch the next day, then he asked when I would make more.  Recommended for kids and picky spouses

The whole family loved it! I was kinda bummed because I couldn't ripen my avocado in time and we only had four slices of bacon left. I did substitute the rotisserie chicken for boneless skinless chicken thighs. Since there has been a request for more I will be sure to plan ahead with the avocado and bacon. Can't wait to make it again!

Made as recipe states.  Husband loved it, giving it 5 stars and told me it is a keeper.  In my opinion, anything with bacon is a keeper.

I'm glad I didn't rate this two days ago when I first made it because I would have given it 4 stars.  I just tasted it again today and it is DELICIOUS.  Definitely make a day or two ahead.  I did make some minor changes based on what I had....  I mixed up some Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing, used red peppers instead of green, added carrots and omitted the avocadoes because someone doesn't like them.  I also used sharp cheddar and Swiss for the cheeses.  (BWT my boyfriend loved it on day 1, so I can't wait for him to try it tonight.)

This was pretty good.  A main factor on how good it is depends on how good your Italian dressing is.  Next time, I will use my own Italian dressing.

I made enough to have for my lunches next week.  I try to do a big cook every Sunday for this reason.  It turned out excellent !  Didn't deviate much from orig recipe posting.  Used can chicken to skip the clean up of a carcass.  And since this needs to last me all week, I skipped the avocado and added zucchini.. It has an interesting texture and I love it's taste.  Added a few pieces of red onion...  used orange pepper in stead of green.  My cat tried stealing the bacon I had cooling, but I caught her in the nick of time.  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow :)

This was delicious!!  I baked a few chicken breasts that I had seasoned with just salt, pepper and the "Rotisserie Chicken" spice blend.  I didn't have the celery, but otherwise it was amazing!  For the dressing, I used a creamy-ish Italian dressing (Olive Garden House Dressing) and the mayo, and it was great...not too oily.  This is going in the SAVE file!

Really easy...made it for some co workers and one is allergic to eggs, so I used the olive oil no egg alternative and it turned out great!  Very easy to make.  I bought carving board chicken instead of rotisserie, no one was the wiser.  NOTE:  avocado stays green in the salad...it doesn't oxidize...yay!

Delicious! I forgot to put the cheese in the salad, but really didn't miss it. I used chicken breasts that I cut into bite sized pieces. Tossed them in olive oil, crushed garlic, salt, & pepper. Then I sautéed them. I will definitely make this salad again.

Pretty tasty little pasta salad! Used salad macaroni – the little guys – for the pasta. Used Olive Garden Italian dressing in – added cucumber and red Bell pepper. Bacon was a nice touch~All all week long! Will most likely make it again. :-)

It was really good; even better a day or more later. I used tomatoes from the garden, which was great. And, while I liked the dressing in the recipe--made it exactly as it said--it was a little sweeter than I expected. I liked a lot, but I think for me it would only be a five-star with another dressing, something tangier. I think you could use just about any dressing you liked on it, tho', and get a positive result.

Delicious.  I'll be making this again for sure.  After frying the bacon, I tipped out some of the bacon grease, then briefly heated the cut up chicken in the pan to get as much of the bacon flavour as possible.  Some reviewers have suggested cutting the dressing but I highly recommend that you make up the full amount.  Pasta soaks up all moisture and if the salad is not eaten immediately, you could end up with dry salad.  Thank you to the recipe poster.

I always try to stick to the recipe the first time I make something.  I am glad that I did.  It was a big hit with my family, so i took so to a co-worker.  He LOVED it.

Excellent.  I chopped the bacon and fried it then fried diced boneless chicken thighs in the bacon fat. Instead of cooling the chicken and pasta, I mixed it warm with the other ingredients and dressing.  Left out the avocado. Turned out great.

I love this as analtenative to my usual pasta salad. Its perfect for a party for adults and kids. And super easy to make, I bought pre-made shredded rotisserie chicken and pre-cooked bacon, and the rest was so easy, I made it all in less than 30 min!

I made it for a picnic and it was great.  I tried it with Orzo instead of pasta as none of us like pasta and used light Ranch dressing instead of the Italian and it was amazing.  Also added a few chopped up boiled egg to the top for a little decoration and it was pretty and tasty!!  Does need a little extra flavor so I added a good dash of pepper and some chopped basil...The possibilities are truly endless...would be great with Shrimp too!!!

A nice summer salad. I used Farfalle instead of "corkscrew" pasta and an aged cheddar. Served on red lettuce with sliced fruit and Chardonnay. Dessert was Madeleine Cookies. A perfect supper for my wife after a long day of work in the desert communities (it was 113 degrees today).

I made this last night and it was amaaaaaazing!!!! I substituted the avocado for Kale which was finely chopped. Avocado has a tendency to brown once the air hits it and I didn't want to take a chance on that happening. I am definitely going to make this again. No more boring macaroni salad for me but I can also see myself making this year round and not just in the summertime. Yummo!!!

I made it and love it. I made a couple of changes, I had to use yellow & green peppers to make the required amount.  Because the Italian dressing I had on hand had well-expired,  I had to make it from scratch. It was so good. I also used pepper-jack  cheese and left out the avocado.  Will make it again.

Used banana peppers instead of bell peppers, chopped up a garden tomato, and I added a combination of a few black and green olives. It was wonderful on a hot summer night over a bed of home grown lettuce. Great recipe, easy to follow and change if you want.

My sister and I loved it!. I used homemade Italian dressing from this site, added to the mayo as suggested , and I found my avocado was too soft to chunk up so I smashed it and added into the dressing! Lovely, will do it again!

I had some leftover chicken I wanted to use and this fit the bill perfectly for a hot summer night. I used the whole pound of bacon and probably about a cup more chicken than was called for. I also didn't have muenster, so I used colby jack instead. The whole family liked it, and I'll save this to make again. I also thought this would be a perfect salad to take to a potluck.

Our family has this dish on a regular basis and loves it every time. I pan-fry frozen, diced chicken breast to make the preparation fast and easy. I've made it with and without adding oregano, and both ways it's delicious.

This was delicious.  The only thing I changed was to use an orange bell pepper because I think they're sweeter.  My husband loved this. . . It worked the next day very well also.

I lightened this recipe by using veggie pasta, lite salad dressing and lite mayo.  I used mild cheddar, as I had some on hand.  I thought this salad was good.  It would make a nice addition to a pot luck.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Lane J!
