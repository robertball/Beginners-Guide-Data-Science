Very good! A nice combination of tangy and sweet. The whole family enjoyed it. Make sure to eat it up - as it does not keep.

My husband is very particular and I was so happy when he really loved this recipe. First I made it exactly as it is, then later I made it again but changed the whip cream to Cool Whip. He didn't like it anymore after that. So I will stick to this original recipe from now on.

I didn't put the banana in this salad. At first I forgot to add the whipping cream and it tasted good not great. The next day I added whipping cream to the rest and it was great!! The fresh cranberries add a great zip and contrast to the sugar.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were when I put the cranberries in the food processor I added 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream, I also added 1/2 cup more of sugar. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is very good. I had gotten tired of cranberry sauce-it is generally too sweet, so I was leary of this recipe, but I love cranberries so I tried it and I am glad I did. The amount of the ingred. is just right. It is tart, but not "pucker your mouth" tart. Thanks for a new favorite at our table.

This is one of my families favorites -- my grandchildren call it "Pink Salad" and request it over and over again.  I don't use the bananas and I have been known to use Cool Whip....  They fight over who gets to take home the leftovers!

Tasted great, but I did have a lot left over. Nice twist on traditional cranberry salad.

This was a great hit but I made a double batch for our Thanksgiving gathering and with everything else there was way too much.   The only thing I would change is using 1 cup or less of sugar. Two cups is way too much.

I have made this salad for more than 30 years.  Banana?  No...Chop berries and 1 cup of sugar, and pineapple (drained) the night before you plan to eat it.  Let meld in the fridge.  In the morning, drain off excess juice (this will make a stiffer salad) and add marshmallows, 1 cup chopped walnuts, and whipped cream (extra stiff).  Mix well and keep in the fridge until serving.  Will keep up to 1 week if prepared this way.

Always a bright, cheery addition to the holiday table. I go between this cranberry salad and a green lime cucumber with horseradish salad as family favorites. I need to branch out!

Family loved it for Thanksgiving!  It is a bit sweet--next time I will cut back on sugar quite a bit. Also, cranberries come in 12 oz bags around here, not 1 # anymore. I used 1 bag and it was fine, but I really like cranberries and next time may use the 16 oz, especially considering you always discard a few. Still think 1 1/2 C or less of sugar is plenty.

A bit runny. Followed directions as directed.
