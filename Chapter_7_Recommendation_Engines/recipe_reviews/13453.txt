My two sons and I made this dessert together tonight. Because I'm low on white sugar, we used half white and half brown sugars. We made no other changes. This pie took almost double what the instructions stated to bake! Our pie was REALLY full, which I'm sure was part of it, it was a very good tasting pumpkin pie. I think the spices could have been increased. A nice pumpkin pie--very easy. Just be aware that if you make this yourself, this might take longer than you think to bake. EDITED: The filling for this pie is so light and fluffy. One of the best I've had.

I used all brown sugar. I removed allspice as I don't care for that spice. I also cut ginger and cloves to 1/4 teaspoon each. I like the pumpkin flavor to shine. Cloves has sharpness to it. It can take away from the pumpkins delicate flavor.

Fabulous recipe, so easy with same measurement for all spices. Got amazing comments on it when served. People who did not expect to like it that much were bowled over and asked for the recipe. I used fresh pumpkin (after scraping insides & microwaving in 2 inches of water in covered casserole for 30 minutes, then scraping the cooked pumpkin off the skin & blending to create a puree - then put in coffee filter to drain off the liquid)so I don't know if that made a difference or not but it sure was worth the effort! Will make again, and again, and again!

Its a good pie. Easy to make.  I in no way felt that it was too spicy in any way.  In fact it could be more for me and my family. 

Followed recipe exactly and no chamges needed for a good pumpkin pie.

This will be my pumpkin pie recipe for life.  Instead of the separate spices I just used 2 tsps pumpkin pie spice.  Everyone agreed this was the best pumpkin pie to date.  Thanks Marlene!

Great pie! This is not a normal, boring pumpkin pie! The spices really stand out and even people who don't really like pie will enjoy this! No need to change anything (I baked it maybe 4 minutes longer than stated, but your oven may vary)

Used this recipe to make my first pumpkin pie.  It needed 10-15 mins extra oven time.  The taste is spot-on.  Turned out perfect with the extra oven time.  Will make again.

I made this with sweetened condensed milk and a graham cracker crust, omitted the allspice and used 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead.  My boyfriend raved about this for days!! =D

I was unhappy with my last pumpkin pie & was looking for a new recipe.  Made this for Christmas dinner & it was the best tasting pumpkin pie I've ever tasted! This is now going to be my standard recipe.  No need to look further for a delicious recipe!

really enjoyed this - even though I messed up and forgot to add the sugar :( until it had been in the oven 11 minutes - took it out and stir in the sugar and it tasted fine -  very smooth and creamy.  I did fine that it was baked 12 minutes under the recommended time and was very firm.  I will definitely make again.

This was a great recipe! I followed it exactly and put it in a deep dish pie plate. I found that it took at least 25 mins more to cook. I made it twice this Christmas and both times it took longer to cook. Very yummy, not too sweet and the spice was just right. THANKS

This was a great recipe! I followed it exactly and put it in a deep dish pie plate. I found that it took at least 25 mins more to cook. I made it twice this Christmas and both times it took longer to cook. Very yummy, not too sweet and the spice was just right. THANKS

I made this pumpkin pie a few years ago for Thanksgiving. Ever since that day I have been voluntold (volunteered/told) to make pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving AND Christmas dinners. this recipe is easy to make and has a WONDERFUL taste. I look forward to Thanksgiving even more now. Family, football, great food and GREAT pie.

Made exactly as stated.  Turned out perfect.  This is a somewhat spicy (not bland and watery like some other recipes)pie with a nice, rich color.  Everybody loved it.  Day after Thanksgiving several of them wanted to know if there was "any of that pumpkin pie left".

LOVE this recipe!! I've made it over 10+ times, and it always turns out well. Much more flavorful than store-bought pie or the recipe on the back of the pumpkin can. Sometimes I make this as a fudge-bottom pie, by putting a 1/2" layer of chocolate ganache onto the crust before pouring in the pumpkin mix. I always make extras for friends & family during Thanksgiving.

Wow!! There were no leftovers!! My husband, who is not a big fan of pumpkin pie, loved it. I couldn't fit all of the pumpkin filling in to the pie crust though. I dont know if this is because I used a 9" rather than 10".
