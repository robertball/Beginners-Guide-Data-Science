I cut the recipe in half and made the whole shebang in one morning. I had to use actual oats that I pulsed in the food processor until they were the consistancy of oat flour. I made these into cinnamon cakes by adding a couple heaping teaspoons of cinnamon. These were thick, fluffy and delicious. I served them with butter and homemade Absolute Best Pancake Syrup. The whole family loved them. A half batch was enough for one large breakfast for four plus enough for a couple to have a couple warmed for tomorrow.

So, I am a bit of an idiot :) Apparently I wasn't on the full site, I was still in the mobile site. FYI for anyone else, there are no footnotes on the mobile site, nor the app. You have to get onto the full site to find cooks notes. And for anyone else wondering:  1 1/2c mix, 1c water and one egg, don't overmix

My kids don't get breakfast at Breakfast, they are off to work way too early! I have always loved making it for them for dinner even when they were in school. So I did it for them again and dug through the pantry. While I was gathering P-cake ingreds. I found the pumpkin puree and Knew I had sliced peaches in the freezer! TA DA!! I added some pumpkin spice & sugar along with a can each of evaporated milk and water. These were to DIE FOR!!! Please forgive me Tamara for the 4 stars, I belong to Tweakers R US!! LOL Plus I saw your variations and went crazy;) Your recipe is a solid 10 stars! Thank you for a twist on an old favorite dinner time tradition!

This is a fabulous recipe!  They are so quick and delicious.  The amount is perfect for a school morning and so healthy.  I never use any other pancake mix now!  I only added a couple Tbsp of sugar to the mix, but everything else is perfection. Also great with add-ins... sweet potato puree, or pumpkin or applesauce and spices.

Love this!! I no longer buy ready to use pancake batter.... I make this and store every time. I will alter sometimes by adding a little wheat germ or ground flax, in place of the flour. About a half cup total. Never have had a problem.

This is so good. I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted 1/2c flaxseed meal and 1/2c King Arthurs high fiber flour blend. I also used 1/2c coconut flour for 1/2 c wheat flour because I had it. I did add 1/4c coconut sugar and 1/4c egg white powder. I didn't taste the coconut nor was it sweet. The flaxseed gave it a nutty flavor. You didn't need butter either. The taste alone was very satisfying. I used 1 1/2c mixture, 2T o√Øl and water to pancake consistency. Thank you Tamara!

Brigitte, read the cook's notes in the footnotes.
