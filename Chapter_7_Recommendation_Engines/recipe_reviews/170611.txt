I really liked this dish!  I made it for workday lunches and it was very satisfying.  I did not have mint or coriander so omitted them and it still tasted great.  The mint would have been a nice addition of color to the dish.  Perhaps I'll think of of good veggie to add into it to make it a complete meal.  I took a picture...will post soon.

I love using Quinoa and this was a nice variation. In particular the sweet of cranberries and raisins with the earthy flavors of the beans/quinoa was nice. I increased salt and pepper, and used basil instead of mint. Nice flavors.

This is a very good introduction to quinoa, although novices should be told you need to rinse quinoa first to avoid a bitter taste.  I didn't have any fresh mint, but people loved the mint so much I attempted to substitute peppermint extract (halving the recipe I used 1/2 tsp of extract) and the results were not great. It was way too minty. Next time I'll get fresh mint or leave it out completely. I also left out coriander because I didn't have any. I will make this again.

Made recipe exactly as written and overall thought the salad was good.  The spices could use some tweaking and it definitely needed more oil.  But the flavors paired quite well to create a good earthy flavor.

I find this to be a very satisfying dish!  I've made it several times now and I think it's a nice marriage of flavors and textures.  I have been using fresh cilantro rather than corriander powder which brightens it a bit.  However, if it's all you have available, it's still excellent.

Great.  Made this exactly as written for a school potluck.  All our Celiac people loved it and thanked me over and over again for it.  Others liked it too!

Really enjoyed this. To make it nutless I left out the almonds. Also I used dried mint because that was what I had in the house. Served it to company and it was a big success. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a yummy recipe for quinoa, and healthy too.  I have made it twice and never had mint, so I just left it out and it was still good.  I agree it needs a little more oil, maybe 2 Tbsp, and chopped leftover chicken or turkey is excellent too.  Definitely add salt and pepper to taste.  It makes just enough, to serve with salad as the main dish or as a side for four, and still with enough for lunch leftovers.  This is one of my go-to quinoa recipes!

I found this salad to be quite bland...  I could barely taste the spices.   I added goat feta and approx. 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar to try rescue the dish, along with more salt/ pepper.

This was very good! Great flavor and different than all the other quinoa salads. Only thing I did was use regular raisens, added some chopped dates and toasted pine nuts, no olive oil needed! This is a great low fat, vegan dish! I used extra mint too. Yum!

This turned out great!  I used a bit more oil because it seemed a bit dry - added lemon flavored olive oil.  Didn't have raisins, so I added some green pepper.  This all gave it a great flavor combination.  I'm going to add chicken next time for additional protein.

My picky bf ate almost all of this in one sitting because he thought it was so good. The cranberries, raisins, and mint were awesome in the mix. I added 3 tbsp of olive oil (instead of 1) and a bit more cumin than the recipe called for. Also, it's actually much more tasty at or slightly above room temp, so cooling it was kind of unnecessary.

I keep this salad on hand at all times. I became a vegan a few weeks ago and I have researched many quinoa recipes because quinoa is a complete protein. So far, this is my favorite salad. The spices are perfect. The only tweaks I have made is that I add the fresh juice of one lime and I leave out the cranberries (my husband hates them) and I replace with more golden raisins. I also add a little more EVOO than the recipe calls for. This salad is perfect for a meal or for grabbing a few spoonfulls when hunger attacks. I adore this recipe!

I made this dish as written, but then decided that it needed "something" so I added about a cup of pomegranate arils and that helped with the dryness of it and added a bit more sweetness (which I usually want no matter what I'm making!). I'm fairly new at using Quinoa I'm not sure how a dish like this is supposed to taste. My husband decided it needed a bit of pineapple juice and agave syrup, so what do we know? I wanted something healthy for us to eat and I got that.

I made this delicious salad exactly as directed, and the combination of flavors and textures is wonderful. Next time I might add some celery to give it even more crunch. Perfect meal for lunch at work.

This was very good. I added an extra tablespoon of olive oil, and it was still a little too dry for me. Next time I would add more liquid of some type. But the flavors are so yummy - wonderful combination of flavors - this is a keeper, thank you

Love, love, love this recipe. Healthy and simple; I add chicken to mine when I want a little more protein. I especially like that it keeps for a few days and it's great for picnics!

This was a hit at the potluck I attended the other day. I substituted unsalted roasted sunflower seeds for the almonds and had only 7.5 oz can of garbanzo beans. Very good. Very easy.
