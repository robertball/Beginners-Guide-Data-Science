Dear people- read the reviews.  My first taste I almost launched the pot down the sink.  Then as it simmered I read more reviews. Unsure how to rate it since it's not that good as written but what are recipes anyway but good ideas to add to, right?!?! Ok agree with me later.  This soup is EXCELLENT when you add a palmful of brown sugar.  AND add extra pumpkin pie spices.  AND a sprinkle or 2 of cayenne pepper.  I used half-n-half and I ran outta onions, but did mince up some garlic.  I really love how it turned out. Taste as you go and for the love of G-d do NOT over-salt it.

Great soup on a cold day! I made it lowfat by using Pam instead of butter, and using skim milk thickened with corn starch instead of whipping cream. Also, instead of croutons, I just floated some sliced scallions on the top to make it pretty. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I made a double batch to take to a party and everyone loved it. I accidentally forgot to add the cream and it was still delicious; BUT I thought it was just a tad too salty, and will halve the salt next time (i'm sure the kind of broth you use affects the saltiness, too). I doubled the ginger and cinnamon, and added a pinch of nutmeg. I think I will follow other reviewers' advice and add about 1/4c brown sugar (or maybe maple syrup?!) next time, and maybe try topping with toasted pumpkin seeds?? The croutons were definitely a great touch to this recipe. I only had a loaf of french bread, so sliced that into 1/2 inch rounds and toppped that with the cinnamon sugar mixture and it was still great (although I think the wheat would've been better). VERY EASY TO MAKE! THANKS.

This is an excellent base for either a savory or sweet cream of pumpkin soup. When I made it yesterday, I wanted a savory version for our family. I DOUBLED the recipe as given with the following adjustments:
(1) Did NOT make the croutons
(2) Used unsalted homemade chicken broth
(3) Used total of 3 cans of pumpkin puree
(4) Used total of 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
(5) Used 3 teaspoons salt for total recipe
(6) Added 1/2 tsp. Penzey's Chipotle ground red pepper
(7) Added 1/2 tsp. Penzey's Ancho Chili pepper ground
(8) Added 2 extra good shakes of cinnamon
(9) Added fresh ground nutmeg (approx 1/4 tsp.)
(10) Used an immersion blender right in the pan rather than pouring into a blender. 

This was a rich and delicious savory soup. It actually tastes even better the next day.

I would suggest you start with only 1/4 tsp. of the Chipotle and Ancho ground peppers and taste and adjust according to your preferences.

Love the soup -- it's now a staple for us.  I also add more spices as other reviewers have said, we like to eat the soup with pumpkin ravioli floating in it -- yum!  Now, I am a verrry amatuer cook, so I didn't know this -- let the onions and broth cool down before putting it in the blender!  Otherwise it explodes on you!

The whole family loved this soup.  We used whole milk instead of cream (and we loved the consistency, though it may not have been thick enough for others), added 1/4 c brown sugar, another 1/2 t cinnamon, and about 1/4 t cayenne.  The cayenne really brought out the flavor of the pumpkin and the sweetness.  The only other change was that I always use homemade chicken stock instead of storebought chicken broth.  Very, very good soup!

I made this soup as the main course for a Fall luncheon and it was a HUGE hit!  Sweet, but not too much so...the chicken broth helps to take away from the richness of the cream and pumpkin so you can eat a hearty serving and not get tired of it!  I haven't had soup this good in a long time...it would be perfect for a first course at the holidays, and it was so easy to make!

OUTSTANDING!  I served this soup as the first course in an autumn harvest dinner with cornish hens, roasted root vegetables, etc. BIG hit with my guests.  I went easy on the onion after other reviews, and it was perfect (although I can see how it could easily be too oniony).  To lower the fat, I substituted the cream with 1/2 cup half-and-half and 1/2 cup 1% milk, and it was plenty rich (could probably get away with all 1% milk next time).   I didn't have time to try the croutons, but the soup was just fine on its own (especially as a first course).  This is GREAT and easy recipe - THANK YOU!

It is an excellant soup.  I have never made the croutons but always dip plenty of crusty bread into this soup.  I think it is even better second or third day.  Easy, delicious, I have never needed to change a thing.  I have used this recipe many times

This turned out great but I added more brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit and give it some life.  My husband was always bugging me to try to make it for him, and he loved it.  We served it as first course with Thanksgiving dinner.

I love this soup.  After reading some of the reviews, I decreased the onion to 1/2 cup and salt to 1/4 teaspoon, added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/8 cayenne pepper, doubled the ginger and cinnamon.  (Also used Swanson's low sodium chicken broth).  To make the dish less fattening I used a combination of fat-free half-and-half & 2% milk.  Turned out wonderful.

Five stars for what an amazing soup this can be, maybe four stars as written. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe needs a good 1/4 c. or so of brown sugar, and as usual I doubled the spices. I also added a bit of cayenne, which makes the soup both sweet and spicy, a lovely combination. My mother in law wasn't too enthused about the idea of this soup, but when she tasted it, she asked for three copies of the recipe - for her and her sisters! The homemade croutons couldn't be simpler and are a special touch. A few notes: I used veg broth because I'm vegetarian, and I think it imparted a sort of sourness that was easily remedied with the brown sugar. I also used half-and-half rather than whipping cream to "lighten up" the dish (if you call half-and-half light!!) and it was still plenty rich and creamy. This soup was a very nice addition to our Thanksgiving dinner, and I've already been enlisted to make it at next year's feast!

great with some tweeks!  I took the advice of other reviewers and beefed up the spices.  I used about a teaspoon each of cinnamon and ginger and a few grates of nutmeg.  I substituted a cup of unfiltered apple cider for a cup of the stock. I also substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream.  Turned out great and lower in fat without the cream!

I got many many great comments when I made this for my cook's meeting. Personally, I thought it was a little bland, and a few others thought the same, but had I doubled the seasonings like others had this soup would have been wonderful. Warm and rich and smooth, and very versatile. You can take this dish in a lot of different directions.

I was completely in mourning after a chain bread/soup company discontinued their fabulous pumpkin soup, but this recipe is a dead ringer for my fall favorite. This soup is great, whether you make it savory or sweet. I've tried it both ways, but prefer it on the savory side. I use a heaping HALF cup of onions and only salt it to taste. I use extra pumpkin pie spices in addition to the spices specified, and I add a splash of buttermilk. The croutons are worth the effort, in my opinion. [Just be careful not to burn them.] I alternate serving it with the croutons, or with a dollop of sour cream and topped with fresh parsley or chives. This is a fantastic soup....don't miss this one!

This was perfect for a chilly November day. My husband -who had never had pumpkin soup before- absolutely loved it and asked for seconds! Following the advice of others, I added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and cayenne pepper as well as a palm-full of brown sugar. Also, I omitted the croutons and added toasted pumpkin seeds and a swirl of sour cream on top for garnish. YUMMMMMMY!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, except I sauteed chopped garlic with the onions. I used an immersion blender instead of pouring it in and out of the pot. I also doubled the seasonings, added freshly grated ginger, 1/4c. of brown sugar, 1/4c. maple syrup, 1/4 c. sour cream, couple dashes cayenne pepper and doubled the pumpkin puree until it was the consistency I preferred. It is such an easy recipe to throw together - and easy to spice it up if you want more flavors!

Yes, this makes a very rich, creamy soup. It was quite filling and, with croutons and some bread, was a very satisfying meal. 

I also used Half and Half to lower the fat content and found it quite suitable. In fact, the pumpkin puree is so smooth and rich, I feel even a low fat 2% milk or even water would suffice. I have yet to experiment! 

I found it difficult to cut and cube the sweet pumpkin raw, so I seeded it and cut it in half, drizzled it with oil and baked it in the oven with the other vegetables with the skin on. After 40 minutes or so the skin just fell off and I could continue baking the pumpkin until nice and soft.

I am also going to try adding a few cloves of garlic to the roasted vegetables to give it some added zing next time! 

One last word of caution...watch the nutmeg. It gives the soup a real nice flavor, but too much can be overpowering. 

I really recommend giving this soup a try...it is rich and flavor-some and quite easy to prepare.

Sorry to be so negative but this was waaaaaay too salty and had absolutely no pumpkin flavor.  I followed the directions exactly except for subbing not fat half & half for the cream.

there are not enough stars for this one!! i loved it!!! soo easy to whip up. i used my hand held emersion tool and didn't even have to take it out of the pot. the flavors are so warm and cozy. i did ease up on the whipping cream to save some calories. i think one could even get away with a non fat creamer in lieu of the cream and not sacrifice taste. loved it!!

Very disappointed. The soup is very watery - broth-like and tasted more like cream with pumpkin than pumpkin with cream.

Wow, is this good!! I love good, hearty soups and this hit the spot. I did things a little different. I combined about 3/4 of a stick of butter with cinnamon, nutmeg, honey and brown sugar. I buttered both sides of the bread and cooked it on one side for about 10 minutes, flipped them, turned off the oven and let them sit in there while I made the soup. (I only did a thin layer of this butter mixture on the bread; I have a lot leftover for toast!) I sauteed the onions with just a fistful of brown sugar (maybe a loose 1/4 cup or less) with the one cup of broth (I used vegetable). It gave the onions a very light but flavorful sweetness. After blending it, I returned it to the deep pan I used, and added about 15-17 ounces of canned pumpkin, 2 more cups of broth, generous shakings of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, pinch of salt, few  shakes of pepper, another ~1/4 cup of brown sugar, some drizzles of maple syrup and let that cook accordingly. Then I swirled in maybe 1/3 cup of cream, because it was already really thick. It turned out great! The croutons are

this was excellent! I made it exactly Except I used butter instead of margarine-and then added a dash of tumeric and a dash of white pepper at the end to give a little more bite. I took it to a progressive dinner and it was the only one that was ALL GONE at the end. Thanks! I'll make this again and again.

This was really great if you add some of the additions stated by other reviewers. I added a handful of brown sugar to the soup, a little nutmeg, a little cayanne pepper, and double the amount of ginger and cinnamon. I loved the croutons, great addition. Thanks!

We wanted a savory soup, so we made a few changes. First of all, I pureed my onion before cooking (so that I didn't need to transfer the hot mixture in my processor later) and added 1 carrot and 1 red bell pepper to it. Also, I used -eyeballing- the following spices: curry powder, sweet paprika and cayenne pepper. It was delicious, and the cinnamon croutons were phenomenal.

I make pumpkin soup a lot this time of year and have tried many recipes.  This is a very good recipe but I made some alterations.  I peeled and added an apple instead of the brown sugar--that gave it the sweetness but also more autumn flavor and went well with the spices.  I added double or triple the ginger (I just threw some in without measuring) but I would have preferred to use some fresh ginger.  I used fresh pumpkin (only because I had from Halloween) and I used a can of evaporated milk instead of cream to reduce calories but still tastes great.  It turned out great, even our little kids like it. Oh and I didn't even add salt, usually the chicken broth has plenty for flavor.

My mom and I loved this wonderful soup!  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the spices, especially the ginger.  This made for a wonderfully spicy soup, and the addition of the cinnamon croutons made it divine!!  Also substituted fat free half and half instead of heavy whipping cream.  All the goodness of a creamy pumpkin soup without all the guilt!!

I made my own pumpkin puree from leftover Halloween pumpkins. Since I made fresh pumpkin puree, I added about 2 T of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of water to thicken the soup. All I can say is WOW! The croutons made the soup taste like a pumpkin pie and the heavy whipping cream made a rich soup base. Who would have guessed pumpkin soup could taste so good!

This soup was perfect for a winter day and had just the right amount of bite to it. Great taste and so easy to make. I do recommend fresh pumpkin over canned if you have a little time to spare. Just peel it, steam it (don't boil it) and either puree it in the blender or mash with a potato masher.

Once I was done this recipe tasted like the pumpkin bisque that I had a couple of times and really liked it. I did follow the advice of the other reviewers, though. I used about half of the onion. I added more cinnamon--two to three teaspoons. I also added a little nutmeg. I added about four tablespoons of brown sugar. I have a bad cold and my tastebuds aren't that good right now. But this sure did hit the spot for someone who has a cold. Oh, the croutons worked out well and were pretty easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Read other reviews and doubled the spices except for salt.  I used low sodium/no msg chicken broth and only added 1/2 tsp salt to the recipe. Also, added 2 TB brown sugar with other spices. This will surely be a staple at our house!

Amazing recipe!  I made it for a fall themed baby shower and I had none left over to bring home!  I am glad I read the reviews and I used alot of the advice.  I did have to double the recipe but that did not really affect it too much.  I went lighter on the onions, used the fat free less sodium chicken broth, added a handful of brown sugar and added twice the seasonings of cinnamon and ginger.  For extra flare I added nutmeg and used cayenne pepper which really did bring out the flavor of the whole soup.  Instead of heavy cream I used light cream and instead of cinnamon croutons I used ginger snaps!  Someone at the party also said pumpernickel bread was amazing in the soup as well!  Enjoy!

This soup had very good flavor, but was very salty.  Next time I will use either low-sodium chicken broth or 1/2 the salt.  Otherwise, I loved the flavor of the soup and the croutons together!

Awesome recipe!!!!  I made the soup & the croutons for our weekly work luncheon & everyone raved about it.  The croutons gave the soup the finishing taste.  I made the soup the night before & thought it was much better the next day.  It thickened it up just enough.  I, like everyone else, added 1/3c more brown sugar than what the recipe called for & it was perfect. Since I'm not an onion eater,I thought about ommitting the onions but so glad that I decided against it. After blending the broth & onions, you dont even know their there.
I will definatley make this recipe again & everyone is asking me for the recipe!
Thanks so much......

Yummy! Just what I was looking for! I didn't make the croutons and had to sub half-and-half for the whipping cream as I didn't have any, but kept everything else the same. Delicious! Ate with a piece of roasted garlic bread (roasted garlic cloves baked into the bread)...so good!

This has been a staple recipe for the last several years.  Come October, friends are always requesting it.  I used tips from other reviews regarding additional spices and brown sugar.  Play with cream amount depending on your mood!

I liked this, but guests did not rave (which is the criteria for five stars!) Also, I think I prefer a nice Pumpkin-Carrot soup instead. It has a sweeter flavor. The cream overpowered the pumpkin flavor just a bit. But still, this was good. I'd make it again for myself but not for company.

This was alright as a base recipe, but if I were to make it again I would definitely be sure to use low sodium broth. My husband and I are big salt lovers but this was just a bit too much since we didn't use low sodium. I also would have liked to be able to taste the pumpkin flavor a little more so I might have only added 1/2 cup of cream. I might add a little more ginger to it as well.

Awesome :)  The texture was wonderful, and the pumpkin taste was perfect.  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you don't overdo it with the onions.. use exactly the amount in the recipe :)

Delicious...added a dash of cloves and used half cream, half 1% milk.  Used my crock pot - on low for about 3 hours, added the cream/milk at the very end. Will definitely make again.

This was really, really good. I made a broth with veg bullion and used fresh pumpkin instead of the canned stuff, and I omitted the croutons (not my style). My husband, who for some reason hates leftovers of any kind, said he'll be happy to eat many bowls of this. Me, too!

Also, I used a hand blender right in the sauce pan after adding the pumpkin, just to get everything pureed and mixed really well. No transferring to a blender necessary.

This soup was awful.  I cut the onion amount in half and cut out about a 1/4 of the chicken broth, and it still had a very strong onion taste.  I ended up adding a cup of sugar and some marshmallow cream just to salvage it, along with extra cinnamon.  I would ommitt the onion all together and cut out about half the broth if I were to make it again.

this soup is really good, but like with most recipes, you have to season it to your own particular taste.  i put less onion and add half of a banana.  the soup is "bland-ish" because... well... pumpkin by itself is bland.  if you like spicier, add more cinammon and ginger.  i also added cloves, nutmeg, and allspice.  also, garnish with cayenne pepper... it makes the soup perfect.

This soup has become a new family tradition.  Even my brother, who readily claims to "detest" pumpkin, loves this soup and has made it an annual request.  I use maple leaf shaped cookie cutters for the croutons for an added touch of autumn.  It is equally good without the croutons, and just a few snips of fresh chives floated on the soup just before service.

This is a good basic recipe to get you started on a pumpkin soup. However, I found it needed other ingredients to provide flavor. I used a vegetable broth and 1% milk, as well as reduced the onions by half. I added finely grated squash and zuchinni pieces for additional flavor and texture. I also squeezed the liquid from roasted red and green peppers, and garlic. In addition to the recipe spices I seasoned to taste with fresh black pepper and sage.
I simmered the soup for much longer than the recipe required, perhaps 45 minutes to an 1 hour total,  and  let sit in the refrigerator overnight before eating. It tasted even better after two days in the refrigerator. 

I enjoyed this soup very much. Thank you for the recipe.

I used skimmed evaporated milk in place of cream and the soup was still thick and creamy without the extra fat and calories. My Dad, the pumpkin pie fan, absolutely loved it! My sick friend loved it too. So for taste, comfort, or paired with a salad as an elegant luncheon you can't beat this hearty yet delicate soup! And don't forget the croutons!!

This is a very tasty soup, but I also altered it a bit.  I used fresh ground ginger (1 tsp) instead of dried--yum.  I used half & half.  I cut the amount of chicken broth (by 1 c) to make it thicker.  I did not puree the onions.  I used store-bought croutons.  These steps sped up the prep time, but it still tasted delicious.

I'm not much of a pumpkin fan, but the harvest was huge this year and I'm trying every recipe I can find that's not bread or pie.  Seeing all the rave reviews for this recipe helped me get over my 'squash-o-phobia' enough to cook up a batch.  One word- YUM!
I still can't get my kids to try any soup that's not red (tomato) or full of chunks of things, but this recipe gives me hope!

Delicious! I used fat free half & half, left out
the croutons and garnished with chopped roasted pecans.

I tried this recipe for dinner the other night, and my whole family loved it! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and left out the croutons and added 1% milk instead of cream, and it tasted great! I'm *definitely* an amateur at cooking, but I was able to cook this soup up with ease. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice Autumn dinner idea.

My picky husband loved this soup.  I made it with fresh pumpkin.  Everything else was the same.  It turned out delicious.

Used 1/2 cup yellow onion, half and half instead of cream, added 1/4 cup brown sugar and doubled the spices. Also added a little cayenne pepper for a little spice like other reviewers suggested. Even with these changes, the soup was only pretty good. Next time I will add more pumpkin (there wasn't enough pumpkin flavor for me) and use less broth.

I  converted this to a lighter, heart healthy version and I liked ita lot. I made double the recipe. I used a real pumpkin that I cooked and pureed. I used canola oil instead of butter for sauteeing the onion, and I used a can of light coconut milk instead of cream to bring the calories down and contribute to heart health. I also used more spice  than the recipe called for and I added some alspice. Instead of croutons, I roasted the pumpkin seeds with paprika and sprinkled them on top. I will definitely make this again.

Tastes Excellent, is easy and can be made early with the cream added 10 minutes before serving.  Added a touch more nutmeg and brown sugar to taste...really brought out the pumpkin flavors. Sprinkled a touch of paprika once in the serving bowl for color.  Gorgeous! Made a couple of batches, once as a double batch.  If you do this, do the onions in the processor all at once and only add as much broth as necessary to allow the processor to operate productively.  ....no mess and very fine chop.

Savory, sweet, spicy...it hit all the right notes. Beautiful color and texture.  My changes= 1/5x the canned pumpkin (made the pumpkin pop), 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper (the smoky spicy addition complemented the sweet squash well), 3/4 the amount of heavy cream (so I could feel like it was healthier), and 1/4c. brown sugar added slowly to taste (added just a bit of sweetness that played up the pumpkin and dulled the heavy oniony flavor). I think next time I will whip up the remaining heavy cream with some powdered sugar and vanilla and add a dollop to the top of the soup just for fun. Awesome!

It was good but I did change a few things. I served it in a bread bowl that I had added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough so I left out the croutons. Also I added more seasonings and added a handful of brown sugar in with the seasonings. Other than that I didnt change anything and my boyfriend who swore he was gonna hate it actually enjoyed it.

This soup is pretty tastey, and very festive in the autumn with all the fall flavors. I added 1/8 t. red pepper flakes for some addditional flavor and also threw in some lentils to thicken it up a bit and make it more hardy. Tastey!

Very good.  Simple ingredients that can all be found at home.  I have lots of fresh pumpkin puree that needs using up.  This is a great way to do it! Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again.

I made this soup as directed before making any additions and it was not sweet enough for us. I added a little brown sugar and pure maple syrup which helped a lot.  I was looking for a way to thicken it a bit for my youngest and added some applesuace to her bowl!  Too good!  So I poured a little in the pot and it was the missing ingredient to make it just right.  In the future I guess I will look for a sweeter or more fruity recipe.

Wonderful soup!  I just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow and doubled the recipe and omitted the croutons for time's sake.  I read the reviews and (keep in mind everything was doubled) in addition to the written recipe I added about a cup of dark brown sugar, used white ground pepper instead of black, added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2 dashes of ground cayenne pepper and I couldn't believe how delicious it is!  I also was amazed at how easy making a homemade soup was.  This tastes like Fall and is perfect for Thanksgiving!  Thanks for posting -- excellent recipe!

This was a really great base soup and turned out really fantastic with the modifications I made.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added extra pumpkin spices as well as brown sugar.  Then I substituted the heavy cream with coconut milk and added yellow curry to taste.  So yummy!

I used fresh pumpkin and the soup turned out good, but WAY TOO SALTY.  i would leave out the salt all together.  (i boiled the pumpkin chunks, drained and reserved the liquid,  pureed the pumpkin and added chicken bouillon to the reserved liquid.)

This soup wasn't great the first time I tried it, but I thought it was because I used milk instead of cream.  So, the second time I made it, I used 2 small REAL pumpkins and not the canned stuff.  I also cut out the cream/milk altogether and the homemade bread croutons and just added the spices directly to the soup.  It was much better.  However, my kids still didn't like it.  I tried this exact soup with butternut squash and it was a hit...I'm thinking that my kids simply don't like pumpkin.

Overall this is a nice recipe, however, I ended up adding some brown sugar to help round out the flavor.  It was ok before the brown sugar, and significantly better with it.  This was simple to make and I am looking forward to taking the leftovers as a lunch tomorrow.

A delicious, light for a cream-based soup with the best kind of ingredients: Simple.  I made this soup just yesterday for a competition at my work.  I'm proud to say that this basic recipe beat out 9 other entries, some of which were just a tad too fancy!

Omit salt, add extra cinnamon and pumpkin.  Add 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Forget croutons.  Definitely use fresh pumpkin, it creates a great texture.  I am now required by my wife to serve this for guests this weekend.

Great on a cold fall night. I agree with adding about a palmful of brown sugar and about double the pumpkin pie spices. Yummy and comforting!

Yummy! And the kids ate it! I was in a hurry.  Did not make the croutons.  And needed to soften the onions more so they would puree smoothly.  Did what other readers suggested and added some brown sugar, and used pumpkin pie spice and doubled the amt in recipe.  Will make again.

I read as many of the reviews as I could and I did add brown sugar and doubled the spices and added nutmeg. I also used half n half instead of the heavy whipping cream. This recipe was just OK...I was hoping it would be GREAT. It does need something...just don't know what it is! But I would make it again and just try to play with the ingredients a little. If you're interested, I would still say you try this recipe. It's good and is unique for a chilly fall evening!

This was an awesome soup!  I added a handful of brown sugar as others recommended, and used half 2% milk and half cream.  Even better on day 2!  Thanks for sharing!!

Upon reading other reviews I altered the soup recipe. These are my changes:  only 1 can of low sodium chicken broth, 1 c half and half instead of cream, 3 tbsp margerine, 1 tsp cinnamon, almost a whole tsp of ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cayanne pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 c light brown sugar, do not add salt until you try the soup, salt and black pepper to taste.  Instructions:  melt margerine in sauce pan, sautee onion until clear, add garlic, cayanne and other spices, add chicken broth, add pumpkin, add cream and sprinkle in brown sugar.  Simmer down to desired thickness.  I didn't puree the onions, although I think it would be better if I did; I didn't have my blender available due to a kitchen remodel. I also didn't make the crutons, due to a limited kitchen. This recipe was VERY easy, tastey and filling.

Soup was good. Definately needs the croutons or some crusty french bread. I just prefer cream soups with great bread. My 6, 4, and 2 year old loved it.

I thought this was a decent base recipe. It needed a lot of stuff added to it. Too bland as is. I doubled the spices, added curry & crushed peppers. I finished off with a dollop of light sour cream.

Like others said, this recipe provided the basis for the soup, but it needed the addition of some extra spices. I halved the recipe and made several changes: I melted 2 tbs. Smart Balance along with 1 tbs. brown sugar and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon in a pan and dipped both sides of each slice of bread in the mixture. I minced 1 clove garlic and an entire onion and sauteed that in 1 tbs. Smart Balance until almost carmelized. I added only 1 cup vegetable broth, and I did process it, which made it nice and creamy. With the pumpkin, I added 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. fresh minced ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. paprika, and a dash of salt and pepper. I also subsituted light ceam. The croutons were a nice addition.

I was given the task of adding a soup course to Thanksgiving this year...what a daunting task.  This recipe ROCKED!  Even my father who shies away from anything fruit or vegetable loved it.  I followed other reviewer's advice and doubled the spices, added a handful of brown sugar and a healthy dash of cayenne pepper.  The hot pepper gave an extra depth with a nice little finish, nothing hot, just  a hmmm type of flavor. I made it the day before and gently heated it with no problems.  Excellent!

My rating is just on an as-is basis.  I agree with the other reviewers that state this is a good base.  It was good, but a little plain.  I did more spices and about 1/2 C of Brown Sugar, which helped.

oh my goodness!! super!! I have made this many times now and I much prefer 2% milk with corn starch to the heavy whipping cream. also, it is a bit too salty, as many other reports have indicated... use 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of a whole and add extra at the table if needed. EXCELLENT!!

I love this soup.  I make no changes to it, and it is always wonderful.  My husband was skeptical the first time I made it, but now he requests it.  I have never tried the croutons before, so I think I will this time.  I have made sausage and sage cornbread before to go with it, and it was awesome. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe! Since I can't get pumpkin in a can where I live I had to use fresh pumpkin. No problem either, I just had to cut in in cubes and then add to the soup and cooked it.  Mashed it up later.  Was wonderful. Especially the croutons where a hit with the kids.  I will definately make it again. Thanks for this recipe!

Everyone loved this soup! I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and added a few more dashes of ground ginger and cinnamon.  I didn't make the croutons, so we topped the soup with saltine crackers instead.  YUM!

Update: 10/12/14
I made this for a dinner party last night and it was such a hit! I've made this recipe years ago, but now that I'm a more seasoned cook, I put my own little touches to make it even better by giving the flavor more depth.

I added celery to the onions while they sautéed. Then after 7-10 min I added diced potatoes (2 small potatoes) and let them cook for another 10 min. I added the 1 can of chicken broth and let simmer as directed. I used an immersion blender to hand blend everything in the pot. 

I then added only 1/2 cup of the other chicken broth, pumpkin purée, and all the spices listed in ingredients but a little more cinnamon. And as other reviewers suggested, I added some freshly ground nutmeg, a handful of brown sugar, and a dash of cayenne pepper.

In the end I mixed in only 3/4 c of heavy cream, then used the rest to drizzle for presentation onto each bowl. I added candied pumpkin seeds for the final touch. It was absolutely delicious and everyone at the table raved about it. Can't wait to make this again!

Yum.  I reduced the chicken broth a tad, sauteed the onion until it was sweetly mellow and used the cream generously to thicken at the end.  The croutons were inspired.  Thank you!

I tried this soup and it was very salty so I added more pumpkin.  The extra pumpkin did not help.  My husband and I both disliked the soup and we ended up throwing it away instead of eating it.

I thought the recipe as is was pretty bland, so I made several changes and it turned out much better.  I cut the amount of broth in half because I wanted a thicker soup.  I used about 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of spices listed as well as an additional tsp cinnamon.  I added about 3 TBS of brown sugar to make it sweeter and used whole milk instead of cream.  The extra spice and sugar gave it more flavor.

fantastic!  I very loosly followed this recipe; used vegetable broth, 1/4 of the cream, no croutons...but it was really good!  And I used fresh pumpkin puree from a medium sugar pumpkin.  THANKS!

Made this for 16 for the family Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone loved it and demanded it become tradition, and even my cousin (a chef in a top resturant) thought it was a wonderful soup.  I did not have a food processor or blender, so the soup was not smooth, but but the onions had a good texture so I do not think I will puree it in the future. For me, I thought it could have used more kick, and next time I think I'll be testing out fresh ginger and pepper and perhaps a stronger cinnamon.  The croutons were perfect, and I also added slightly less cream and whipped some for people to add on top.  Overall, a great recipe...but basic enough to play with it and make it your own.

Had a great taste!  I took a lot of short cuts and just threw all the ingredients (even the onions) into my slow cooker and cooked on low for about 4 hours.  I used half and half instead of whipping cream and added a can of coconut milk and deleted the ginger.   Served with salad and a dense, hearty wheat bread to make a great meal.

Our family/friends loved it!  Its become a  family tradition for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I use 1% milk to cut down on calories and its still nice and creamy.  I also put some peanut butter in for a nice kick.

Great soup!!!  The croutons were awesome, too!  I followed some other recommendations and used fat-free half and half instead of the whipping cream, and I used 1/2 cup onions only.   We experimented with the flavors a bit, and we found some great ways to make the soup more interesting.  We discovered that if you want a soup with a little more kick (really good!), just add some:  extra pepper, cumin, paprika, and a dash of cayenne.  If you want a sweeter soup, add:  more cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and a little sugar.  Overall, a wonderful and easy recipe for anyone who wants a satisfying and tasty soup!

This was a quick, easy soup to make and delicious! I made it for a Halloween party and it was well received. The homemade croutons made it extra special.

This is a great soup. I use evaporated low fat or skim milk as a substitute for the heavy cream to make it with less fat. It is great for the cold weather.

I was looking for a recipe similiar to a pumpkin soup I had at a very expensive restaurant in Rhode Island, but this turned out not to be the one. However, I was plesantly surprised. It was wonderful and every bit as good as the soup I had in the expensive restaurant. Smooth, tasty, and creamy without being too rich. Delicious!

This was a nice light tasty soup.  (I used half and half)  It is not hearty enough to be a main dish, but is lovely as a side.  The cinnamon croutons are yummy and are not that much of a pain, so try them (and they actually taste better plain as a snack than in the soup!).  I used vegetable broth.  And I also put in less onion, maybe half a cup, since I read the complaints about it being too oniony.  I didn't bother to puree the soup in the blender. Overall, a very nice recipe!

We doubled spices and added a small amount of brown sugar to taste.   1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper.

The croutons make this awesome. 

Don' t puree the onion / soup while it is HOT it will EXPLODE. wait for it to cool down. 

 we added a can of pureed Campbell's hearty chicken soup after we lost half our onions & chicken soup in the explosion.   LOL..

I've noticed that many of the higher rating reviews made changes to the recipe. That's deceiving to people who follow the recipe as stated. As written, its bland and overly salty if low-sodium chicken broth is not used. That being said, it is a good basic recipe to experiment with. However, I wish people would review the recipe given instead of the one they made with 4 or 5 changes to the original. Even better, people, post your own recipe with all the excellent changes you made!

Yes, I made adjustments; but had I not read this great recipe, I could not have modified it!  I omitted the croutons.  Cooked the chopped onion in butter, added the chicken broth, pureed with an immersion blender, added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp creole seasoning and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Added two 15 oz cans of pumpkin puree, blended with immersion blender and heated through; added 1 cup heavy whipping cream, blended with immersion blender. Top with sliced green onions and crumbled bacon. (Hint:  Store cooked bacon in a baggie in freezer - handy to pull out a couple of strips at a time, crumble, heat in microwave and sprinkle on top of yummy pumpkin soup with sliced green onions.)

Awesome Recipe. Will make again. I used one can of pumpkin and then one of sweet potato puree b/c that's what I had. It was still great. Found pumpkin ravioli to put on top vs croutons. Brought it to a Thanksgiving Pot Luck at work and people loved it- some who tried it just to be nice even fell it love!

Amazing.   Even my 2 and 4 year old ate it and asked for more... That's a major win!  I didn't have bread to make the croutons and they still loved it!! Didn't change a thing other than adding some brown sugar.

I made this soup for a Christmas gift exchange party and everyone loved it.  I especially like that it does not use garlic because one of my friends can't eat it.  I added a little cornstarch mixture at the end to thicken it up a bit.

I reduced the onion by half, did not add salt either. I added 2 tablespoons brown sugar, increased the ginger and cinnamon, and added 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice. My daughter ate 3 bowls. She hates soup.

This was wonderful! The croutons were an fantastic addition, so please don't skip them! Easy to do while you're simmering the soup. I always use low-sodium broth, so maybe that's why mine didn't seem salty? The flavor was perfectly good as written in the recipe (I might use just a touch less ginger next time but that's a personal preference). I did add just a little brown sugar (less than 1/8c) for just a little sweetness. Looking forward to the next batch!

WE LOVE THIS SOUP. This is the first pumpkin soup recipe I've tried and it is truly a winner!  Since Thanksgiving is coming soon, I tried another recipe just to make sure I have the best for our Holiday dinner. This is by FAR the best. I normally use light cream instead of heavy cream and it turns out great.  The cinnamon croutons really finish it off nicely.  If you are thinking about skipping them, think again!  Not that much time and so worth the effort!  Thank you very much for the recipe.  It will be a perfect start to a wonderful Thanksgiving!

Very good soup! If you have real homemade pureed pumpkin on hand, it is WAY better than using the stuff from the can. I go to the pumpkin patch and get 'em fresh, roast them, then puree them up and bag/freeze it to use. I made a few changes, based on reviews:
Added about 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
Only used half the salt
Added 25% more cinnamon and ginger
Added cayenne pepper
Used half cream, half 2% milk. This was so creamy I may just do all milk next time, to cut down drastically on calories.
Only used half the butter recommended
YUM!

This soup is great!  Much more filling than expected.  I followed advise of other reviews and add spices to taste.  nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger,  cayenne pepper and a bit more brown sugar.  Do let it cook a bit and then add spices to taste.  One thing I do different is use unsweetened coconut milk (organic, canned).  This is great for LACTOSE intollerant or dairy avoiders.    I have made this recipe 3-4 times of the last couple years and love this time of year for the reminder of ..OH YEA pumpkin soup!!!

Made this for my fiancee who asked for it. I didnt plan on eating it because I've never liked any pumpkin or squash soup, ever. But I absolutely love this soup! I don't think it needs that much cream...leave it out and it would still be rich. Next time I will use 1/4 cup instead.  Also, I added a dash of cayenne pepper and used a clove of garlic with the onion in the beginning. This soup is a winner!

This is a wonderful soup. Very simple and fast to make. You can adjust it to your taste easily. I did not bother with the croutons. I pureed my onions first instead of transfering and blending boiling liquid. This made the process faster and, in my case, safer. I used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream. I served this soup at a party last week and it was a hit. I was asked for the recipe several times.

This was a great soup. I did add some paprika and garic powder to it and used regualar croutons. 
Also, instead of simmering it all together after using my food processor I put it in my crockpot for three hours until we were ready to eat!

This is phenomenal. I wouldn't make a "light" version, the heavy cream makes it taste amazing and if this is going to hasten my death from high cholesterol, it's worth it.

Great soup! (with alterations). Added celery and red pepper in addition to the onion. Substituted 2% milk for the cream. Doubled the spices in recipe and added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tbs ancho chili powder and few sprinkles of chicken bouillon. Topped with chopped scallions. AMAZING version. Beefy and sweet at the same time, with a mellow spice kick.

I made this without the croutons and it was still delicious!  I didn't follow exactly, adding sauteed carrots and bell peppers for some extra vitamins, but used all of the main ingredients.  I also used a real pumpkin instead of the canned as here in Germany they don't can pumpkin.  Just baked it in the oven until soft, removed the skin and mashed.  I will used this recipe again and again!

This is an awesome soup... instead of pumpkin out of the can I used fresh pumpkin.  I agree with the comments regarding it being a little flat... try adding 1/4 cup of Vermont Amber Maple Syrup... it will blow your socks off!!!!

Great recipe, I added extra of the spices to taste.  I did not make the croutons because I didn't feel like it, but I did add brown sugar to the soup.  I also used whole milk in place of the heavy cream and thought it was plenty rich and thick.  I almost think the heavy cream would have been too much.

this came out bland. I followed directions exactly as written. I definitley will  more spices next time (maybe double the ones called for) and I will NOT use the whole cup of cream. It came out almost white and not a creamy orange color I was looking for. Maybe just thicken it w/ corn starch and forget the cream. I will experiment next time.....there will definitley be a next time!!

Loved this soup! I just used less onion and milk instead of cream. Don't forget to read "Pumpkin Soup" to your kids before you make it. They got a kick out of making and eating it because they love the book (and the soup now too).

I use fresh pumpkin by cooking it with the chicken broth and onions,  I remove the onions prior to puree and add a packet of Crocks Spicy Soup Mix. Fabulous flavor and no cream needed.

I agree with the other reviews, I amped up the spices, added brown sugar and doubled the pumpkin and it was divine.  I also used evaporated milk in place of the cream to cut fat and calories.

I wish I had read the other reviews BEFORE I made this soup. Since it had a high rating, I assumed it was delicious as is. I doubled the recipe and used vegetable broth instead of chicken in order to make it vegetarian. It was not as thick as I imagined a cream of pumpkin soup to be and not as flavorful either. Definitely recommend adding additional spices, etc. in order to make this soup better! I did love the addition of the cinnamon toast croutons for this though and will use that to add to a different pumpkin soup recipe in the future.

I made this soup and took it to a party--it was a hit!  There wasn't a drop left and people are still calling to ask for the recipe.  I read the reviews and decided to add 1/2 cup brown sugar when I added the pumpkin.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more, you'll have to use your taste buds on this one...).  This soup is definitely going in my cookbook!

It's October, so I was able to get a "pie pumpkin" at the grocery. I poked it with a knife, put it on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 for 1hr, then cut it open, scooped out the seeds, and scooped out the "meat" into the blender. Added all other ingredients to blender with following adjustments: 1/2 onion, 1/2 c. whole milk (no cream), added 1/4c brown sugar, 4oz cream cheese, and pumpkin spice to taste. Blended, heated, served. Excellent, and very few dishes. Will use every fall.

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was an enormous hit. Everyone loved it including kids.  I used fresh pumpkin though.  Just slice a pumpkin in half, put it sliced side down on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 45 min - an hour.  Let sit for 20 minutes to cool.  It's easily scooped out of the skin and pureed in a food processor.

This soup was great!  We took the advice of another reviewer and added celery and carrots to the sauteed onions. However, we didn't blend the vegetables...we wanted a little bit of "chunkiness" in our soup. It was delicious like that!  We also added some fresh sage to the soup (we had used fresh sage in a butternut squash soup in the past), which was great! We did not add more sugar, as we wanted it more savory than sweet.  Great recipe!

It's not fantastic.  Everyone in my family tried it, but I'm sure we won't make it again.  I even tried some of the suggestions in the reviews.  Maybe we just don't like pumpkin enough.   It was fun to try a new recipe, though!

I liked the idea, it sounded different and looked good in the picture, but it wasn't my family's favorite soup.  I followed the recipe, it just seemed a little bland or like it was missing something.

I second what others wrote about adding a bit of cayenne...not too much, just a sprinkle or two.  It beautifully enhances the other flavors.  I didn't make the croutons because I knew I liked the soup purely savory...so I also didn't add brown sugar like others suggested.  Used fresh pumpkin instead of canned because that's what I had available...so easy, just cut pumpkin into large pieces (halves or quarters, depending on the size) and microwave for 15-20 minutes, or until fairly soft.  Then throw it in the blender with the onion and chicken stock.  Really, really yummy soup.

Excellent easy to make soup.  The bread is great even left as whole pieces and dunked for a more casual dinner.  Very nice alternative to the traditional pumpkin soup flavours.

This was yummy with suggested changes.  I added lots of brown sugar.  At least a handful.  I used half the onion.  And 1% milk with corn starch.  Came out yummy, everyone loved it.

Yumm! After reading some reviews I made some changes; First I dont eat meat so I used veggie broth, I Added extra brown sugar, some pumpkin pie seasoning and cayenne pepper. I also used nonfat half and half to cut down on the calories.- when I was done cooking I thought it looked a bit thin so I boiled up a potato then strained it and added to the soup. I think the potato really made it amazing-  I think bacon would mae a good addition for you meat eaters, especially with the potato addition.

Very good!  I did salt to taste, but did most of the recipe as it asks.  I used boullion cubes instead of broth, and milk instead of cream, but I like a thinner consistency better anyway.  A very sweet soup, hence the 4 stars.  I may prefer a savory pumpkin soup.  I served it with the YUMMY croutons, some avocado and a little chedder cheese, which made it a tad more savory.  Try the recipe and make it yours!

I've never had pumpkin soup before so I don't really have anything to compare it to.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added cayanne pepper.  It had a lot of levels of flavor, when I first tasted it, it was like pumpkin pie, then the heat of the pepper added a savory flavor to it.  Also, I used 1% milk with just a splash of heavy cream to lighten it a little.  For the croutons, I used a whole wheat, day old, bakery loaf and used olive oil, parmesan cheese and a little s&p.  i thought the cinnamon croutons would be too much with the salty/peppery flavors.  I really enjoyed it.  It's not a soup I would eat everyday but it's very tasty and super comforting on a cold autumn day!

I would give this 5 stars but it needs brown sugar (about 2tbs) to sweeten it just a bit.  Also I cut the salt in half but that could have been my chicken stock that made it saltier.  With these small changes, an excellent recipe!

This ia an awsome soup.  I did make a couple of small changes.  I doubled all of the spices except for the salt, added 1/4 tsp. Cayanne pepper and two tablespoons brown sugar.  I also used 2% evap rather than heavy cream.  So good.  I didn't make the croutons.

Made this soup for Teacher Appreciation Day. They LOVED it. The croutons were great. One person thought it was missing something but could not figure out what. Maybe smokey liquid? Remember, it's cream of pumpkin soup. With that in mind, this recipe hits the mark. Would make it again.......

The soup was very flavorful and was a nice addition to fall recipes. I ended up using a can of pumpkin pie filling instead and will probably go with the unsweetened pumpkin next time. I also made this recipe before and included onion but ended up with chunks of onion instead. This time I used onion powder to give it the flavor without the chunks and it was still very good.

This soup is really wonderful.  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I sauted the onion, then added the cubed pumpkin and chicken broth and let it simmer until the pumpkin was tender.  I added the cinnamon, ginger, 1/2 tsp of salt, fresh ground pepper and about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  I pureed and added about a half of a cup of whole milk.  Good stuff!

I followed Dee's review and made it a bit spicy/savory.  I also added about 1/8 cup brown sugar.  In addition, you can save a bit of time by beginning the broth/pumpkin mixture while the onions are simmering.  I served this as the starter course for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit.  Thanks!

I served this soup for our Thanksgiving celebration with my husband's family.  Many of our guests, including myself, had not ever had pumpkin soup before.  It was phenomenal!  Everyone raved about it and many have asked for the recipe.  I used real pumpkin instead of canned, and didn't use as much ginger.  The croutons really added the perfect finishing touch.  I highly recommend this recipe - thanks for sharing it!!

I'm giving this five stars, but its not a solid five as I JUST took it off the stove and won't be eating it until tomorrow.  I also increased the spices and added 3 heaping teaspoons of brown sugar to the soup.  Instead of whipping cream, I put in a quarter package of reduced fat cream cheese and let it melt in the soup, and maybe 1/2 cup of skim milk since that's all I have. I couldn't stop sampling it when I took it off the stove, so I know it'll be good.  As someone suggested, I also used cinnamon bread, but I cut that into cubes, tossed them in melted butter, put them in a baking dish, sprinkled apple pie spices over them and baked them into croutons.  I keep eating those too, so I think its going to be a good meal!

This was great! Comfort food at its best! I did add brown sugar, nutmeg, a bit of white wine, and didn't bother with pureeing (just chopped onion really fine). It was really good, and my kids liked it too!

It was good, but I only give it 4 stars because I think the cream makes it unbelievably thick and rich.  I used 1/4 cream and the rest skim milk and it was still quite thick.  Yummy as is, otherwise.  I didn't add more brown sugar like other reviews mentioned - I was afraid it would taste too much like dessert or pumpkin pie filling.

This is the first time I have tried pumpkin soup and to my honest surprise, I liked it! I love the texture...nice and thick and creamy. I omitted the crutons just because I was trying to cut calories where I could for the needs of a family member. I don't think this is a good 'main course' dish, but it serves well as an appetizer or side dish. It's not too 'pumpkin-y' in flavor, but it is slightly rich. Next time I am all over those crutons though!

Two of my favorite things are pumpkin and soup.  The idea of putting them together sounded like a dream come true.  However, this recipe just didn't fall together like I'd hoped.  I followed the advice of several reviewers by cutting back the amount of salt, adding a little spice, and garlic, but the soup still tasted like it was missing something.  Not sure what that something is, but I was disappointed.  Not so that I won't try this recipe again.  Maybe I was just off my game today!

Like others, I made the soup much tastier by adding brown sugar, peanut butter, and cayenne.  I've also found that people often like fresh grated parmesan, too.  With these changes, I give the recipe four stars at least.

I liked this recipe.  I did make it without the croutons and I do think that would have been a nice touch; it definitely needs something else to go with it.  I made the pumpkin puree from scratch the day before and then adjusted the recipe to how much puree I had.  I ended up making a lot of soup and freezing it.  When you first start making this soup and it's just the onions and the chicken broth...wow.  That looks disgusting.  Luckily, it gets better.  I added a generous helping of brown sugar, doubled the amount of cinnamon and ginger, added a few good shakes of nutmeg, a small shake of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt.  Other reviewers recommonded pumpkin pie spices; I didn't have that, would have loved to have added that too!  The soup really doesn't begin to look super appealing until you add the cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic.  Made it for recipe club and it was a big hit.  I followed others advice and used a little cayenne and some brown sugar in the soup.  Also, I used fat free half and half instead of cream and it worked very well.

Excellent with some changes...  I can never make a recipe without changing it. :)  I used low sodium chicken broth and evaporated milk.  I upped the spices a lot, and added cayenne pepper and cloves.  It would be bland as written, but delicious when you spice it more to your tastes.  The croutons are a definite must!

I made this dairy-free, using olive oil instead of butter, and rice milk instead of cream.  I added two carrots, doubled the pumpkin, halved the onion, doubled the spices, and added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar.  It was quite good!  I am sure it would be awesome with croutons, but we are avoiding wheat...I think next time I'll toast some pecans to sprinkle on top.  I also think almond milk would have been a richer choice for replacing the cream, but we all loved it the way I made it.

I am not going to give this a to bad of a rating due to the fact that it could have just ben something did. I was on a liquid diet and was looking for recipes.I came across this and thought well I like pumpkin pie so maybe I will like this. Well NO it was bad. Just my opinion, like I said it could have just been me.

I made the recipe minus the croutons and it  was delicious.  The cinnamon and ginger add a natural sweetness and tartness to it.  I even had this soup cold and it is delicious!

I love this recipe! It is the perfect rainy day lunch or starter for an autumn  dinner! The spices and onion blend beautifully with the pumpkin flavor! 
Instead of the heavy whipping cream, I substitute 1/2 cup light cream cheese. I also add a pinch more ginger than was called for. It is great!

Great flavor! I used evaporated milk instead of cream, and added about 1/2 of a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. I wouldn't want to add sugar or syrup--this is supposed to be savory, not sweet!

Wow I loved this! I never had pumpkin soup before and really enjoyed this. To decrease the fat and calories, I replaced the cream with nonfat evaporated milk and cornstarch. I added a little less than 1/4 cup brown sugar and a pinch of nutmeg as others had suggested. With the croutons, this was so delicious.

I did not make the cinnamon croutons. Before adding the cream to the soup, I was worried it had too much spice, however, after I added the cream, it was perfect!

i'm sorry, this just wasn't for me. It turned out very salty. When you first tasted it, it was way too salty, then it was sort of spicy from the black pepper, and then the aftertaste was like diluted pumpkin pie... yech. It was easy to make, which is nice, and could have had potential if I would have bought low sodium chicken broth, or maybe just made my own with some boiled chicken and veggies.. but overall this was just no good. Sorry.

Excellent soup with a few changes:
-Use 2 cans of 33% less sodium broth
-Double the cinnamon and ginger (atleast)
-add 1/4+ tsp. nutmeg
-add 2 Tbsp brown sugar
-used half and half
-I did add 2 pinches of salt (would rather add it when needed than start with too much)
-garnish with a dash of cayenne pepper

I made this for a Pumpkin themed birthday party, and it was a hit! It did turn out a bit thick side, so I might use more stock, or half and half instead of heavy cream next time - but it was still fantastic. Also I added some fresh ground nutmeg since I felt like it was missing a little something, and it was the perfect touch. The cinnamon croutons were the perfect touch, and was a snack hit on their own! Thanks for the recipe :)

This dish was delicious, but I felt like it needed a little more flavor.  I used a low-sodium chicken broth (my friend made this and said it came out too salty with regular chicken broth) and  I added 1 tbsp of cinnamon (instead of 1/4 tsp) and 1/2 tsp of ground ginger (instead of 1/8 tsp).  It gave it a more savory flavor.  The cinnamon croutons were a perfect touch as well.  I wasn't going to make them, but was so glad I did!

SOOO good!  Took it to a potluck and got rave reviews. I made the croutons but didn't feel they accented the soup because the soup was way more savory than sweet.  I would add ALOT more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg if I was using the croutons.  Even without the croutons it was the best!!

My family loved this soup. We first tried it without the cream and then added it at the end.  Both ways tasted so different, but delish.  I used vegetable broth for a vegetarian alternative.  I would recommend this recipe.  So would my kids.  They licked their bowls clean.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I only used 1/2 cup of onion and subbed half-and half for the heavy cream(didn't have it), and it came out wonderfully.  Even my ten month old baby loves it!  This is a welcome addition to my recipe book.  Thanks Thomas!

Fantastic, easy, tastey recipe. I doubled the spices (not the salt) and it was perfect. I also added 2 tsp of green curry powder which turned out to be a nice addition.

This soup was an interesting addition to our Thanksgiving meal. I substituted the cream with nondairy creamer. Based on the other reviews and my personal taste, I added some red pepper and LOTS more of the spices (not the salt) to this soup. My family thought it was the perfect mix of sweetness with saltiness.

This is delicious-and I even have a cold right now!! It tastes more like an onion/chicken soup with a thicker broth.  I had something very similar to this out in Vermont-there they sprinkled it with sunflower seeds prior to serving, very good!! Have  a Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

This recipie was just okay.  I decided to make my own Pumpkin Soup after tasting the one at Au Bon Pain. Unfortunately, this recipie didn't have the "umph" I was looking for. I think that 2 cans of chicken broth was too much - It wade the soup super watery.  Also, I added triple the amount of cinnamon salt & ginger for flavor.  I dont think I will be making this again.  I did however, taste better thicken dramatically the next day.  If I were to make this soup again, I would add double the amount of pumpkin puree as well.

The consistency of this soup is excellent.  Slightly thick and very creamy.  I would somewhat compare the taste to that of tomato soup, except with a pumpkin flavor.  I added twice the amount of cinnamon and ginger and felt that it turned out well.  Next time I will probably add sugar and curry to make it sweeter and more flavorful.  Also, the onion was a bit strong.  I might use less next time, but haven't yet decided.

It was OK. I was trying to recreate the pumpkin soup at Au Bon Pain, but this was a little less sweet, more salty.  I did like the cinnamon croutons though, they are a keeper, but I think I'll keep looking for another pumpkin soup recipe.

I made this recipe for my picky boyfriend and served it in a sourdough bread bowl and he absolutly loved it! In fact I am making it again tonight.  I did make a few modifications that I would recommend.  I only added 1/2 cup of onion and only 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream.  I took other's advice and did not use a blender.  I am not a great cook by any means and found this recipe to be easy and delicious!

Good but needed a little 'umph'.  I added a pureed yam, some thyme,a T. of curry.  Also, half of the wheat croutons I pureed into soup.  For those that like a kick, a dash of cayene at the end.

Easy and yummy! I skipped the croutons, and added a few gratings of nutmeg. I've also made it with and without the addition of about 1/16 t. of cayenne. It's good either way. My kids weren't crazy about it, but I think that's because it smells like pumpkin pie as it's cooking, so that's what they were expecting. If you can steer your kids' expectations right, it'd be a great way to get in their Vitamin A!

I made this for some friends last night and it was pretty good. I had to add more spices to it.  I ended up with about 1tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, and about 1/8 tsp. all spice.  I think that next time I will only use 1/2 cup heavy cream, I thought that 1 cup was a little over powering of the pumpkin flavor.  Def. going to make again though!

Wish I could jump on the bandwaggon of rave reviews but I found this to be quite bland.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using half and half as others suggested.  After trying it and being disappointed, I added 1/2 tsp. curry powder and 1/2 tsp coriander.  Helped immensely.  I would make it again with those changes.

This was a VERY pleasant soup to eat, especially with the croutons. Definitely will make this again and again. I did do one little tweak to it...I didn't have heavy cream, instead I used half & half (fat free, too!) Still came out real creamy. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a double batch without really measuring any ingredients, just using enough to give me the consistency and taste that I wanted. I ended up with a thick, creamy, flavoursome soup. Unfortunately I forgot to refrigerate the leftovers, and ended up with a potful of stinky soup which went down the sink. I will definately make this again though.

Can't buy canned pumpkin here, so I made this with fresh pumpkin.(just cook and puree)
Everyone LOVED this creamy soup and wanted more!
People couldn't figure out what it was (they thought there was corn in it!)
Nice colour, lovely croutons.....

I love pumpkin soup!  This is a great soup.  I however, do like mine thincker and sweet.  I doubled the amount of pumpkin and spices, added allspice and brown sugar.  YUM!!!  The croutons are quick and easy if you use a toaster oven and well worth the extra effort.

This recipe was great!  I made it for 3 very picky Spanards who gobbled it up.  They were very concerned with the idea of eating pumpkin but each asked for the recipe afterwards.  I couldn't find ginger in Spain, so I omitted that and the croutons becuase I just didn't have time and it was perfect.  They told me afterwards that they couldn't wait to tell their friends and family that Americans do cook other things besides hamburgers and hotdogs.

This recipe is outstanding!!!  I made it from scratch with pumpkin, and the flavor was exceptional! My boyfriend is Austrian, and pumpkin soup is a specialty in Austria, and he was even blown away, saying that we must replace the other typical recipes(which are also wonderful)!!!!

Great recipe.  I used 2% milk, made homemad regular croutons; and,
garnished each serving with a dollop of plain non-fat yogurt, the croutons,
and finely slivered green stems from scallions (about 1 1/2" long).
Very pretty presentation and I thought folks were going to lick
their bowls.

Great tasting cream of pumpkin soup! I have tried a recipe something like this before, but this one has ginger ~ WONDERFUL! LOVED IT! I also tried this with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" zero-calorie spray and 1% milk (I am on Weight Watchers) IT STILL WAS ABSOLUTLY WONDERFUL! I am makeing this for our family Thanksgiving dinner.

I had been looking for many years for a good Cream of Pumpkin Soup recipe after having some in New Orleans at an April in Paris dinner.  This is a fabulous recipe.  I've made this recipe at least 6 times and love it more every time. This will permanently stay in my recipe box.  Merci Beaucoup Thomas.

Delicious! My whole family gobbled it up.   I added 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg as I saw suggested in many of the reviews.  Instead of heavy whipping cream I used evaporated milk and 1% milk to equal 1 cup.  I also just did a whole onion.  My daughter had just gotten a couple teeth pulled, so I did not try the croutons this time, as she needed soft food.  Will definitely be making this again!

It was delicious however, eliminate the salt or use low sodium chicken broth. If you use both (I did) it will be a bit salty. To combat I added a little brown sugar.

Like other reviewers, I modified this recipe by adding in a small amount of nutmeg and several tablespoons of brown sugar.  From there, I adjusted other spices to taste (not very scientific!)  I chose to make it more sweet than savory and I thought it was delicious.  I was going to skip the croutons but decided at the last minute to go ahead and make them and I'm so glad I did, they really added to the soup!  I will be making this again.

This soup was delicious with such a wonderful flavor! I didn’t make any changes except I did use fresh pumpkin purée just because I happen to have it. I’m sure it would be just as good with canned pumpkin. I will definitely be making this again!!

Used Pumpkin Pie Filling (with all the spices already in it), and eliminated the onions due to an allergy. Still was awesome.

We love this recipe! I don’t always purée the onions-sometimes I leave them chunky for a heartier soup.

I doubled the recipe so  in not following the ingredients to a "T" as I never do I added more ginger and pepper, using white pepper instead and more cinnamon to my taste.   I'm not a salt user and forgot to use it. I really loved it before I even put in the Cream. used crotons with a buter and garlic flavor as I was too lazy to make my own.

Giving this a 5 start rating although I did modify slightly based on reviews.  I am not a soup person and generally don't like anything sweet, but the combination here is spot on.  I added a shake of nutmeg, about 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and a 1/2 tbl of brown sugar.  Also to note I used homemade pumpkin puree.  This is definitely a keeper.

I didn't use the croutons as I am doing low carb.  I made some changes based on other's suggestions.  I used a bit less salt and added a bit more brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and cayenne pepper.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  An immersion blender was easier for me than using a blender if you own one.  I will make this again.

Have made this many time and is a favorite!  To cut back on the dairy, used coconut milk (can) which had the same consistency as cream and was DELICIOUS.

I don't add the ginger, but use the recipe as is otherwise.  I like to use a stick blender instead of transferring to a food processor or blender so I'm keeping it all in one pot.  This is a Thanksgiving favorite!

I make this every year in November. I use the "pumpkin pie puree" instead. This cuts out all the added ingredients and it tastes delicious.  I also don't blend the soup as the onions give it a nice texture.

Followed the recommendations and added 1/4C brown sugar, doubled the ginger and cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg. After the prep on the stove I put it in the crock pot for 2hr on low while my main dish cooked. My husband LOVED the soup. We will be making this again!

I thought it was wonderful. A real keeper! I took the advice of one of the other cooks and added a quarter teaspoon more of cinnamon and  1/4 cup brown sugar.  She also suggested adding 1/4 tsp. cayenne which I didn't have, so I  substituted paprika.  This  worked well since I don't like things too "hot".   I did not do the croutons because I thought it would be a little too sweet, but instead added some chopped chives on the top.

My favorite soup!!! My family loves this soup even though some of them don't like pumpkin recipes in general. I only rate this recipe 5 stars with the following additions: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and additional 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Croutons were hard to make and not necessary. Serve with pumpernickel bread.

This is good recipe but it def needs the 1/4 cup brown sugar to make it great. I also frequently substitute sweet potato for the pumpkin as that's what I tend to have on hand and use a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg as well.

I was disappointed in this soup--thinner than expected, and generally flavorless!  I had to add a lot of spice (more salt, more cinnamon, and some clove) to have it presentable for a dinner party with some friends.

Very good soup! I also used less nutmeg (3/4tsp) and 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic seasoning and 2 vegetable bouillon cubes. I cooked the onion and carrots in the pot with oil until tender and then added the water, cubed pumpkin and potatoes and cooked until done. Added seasonings and simmered for 1 hr. 
I used Greek yogurt instead of the cream before serving and it tasted yummy!

I made it exactly to the recipe except I used fresh pumpkin hoping that would only add to the flavor.  I love pumpkin, and cinnamon so I'm not sure what is wrong...it doesn't have a lot of flavor, I tried adding more ginger and cinnamon, but still pretty bland and weird.  Bummed.

I made this soup for a party, and it was gone within the first hour. To make a larger batch, I added cream of butternut squash soup. It tasted quite different from what I expected (more savory) but it's incredible. I served it with croutons, which work if you don't have time to make the topping.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it tasted like a watered down version of chicken broth. Very salty. No pumpkin taste at all.

I did what others suggested and it was so good! Half the salt, twice the ginger, twice the cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added a few shakes of pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and cayenne pepper. You can't eat this if you are in a hurry- you need time to sit down and enjoy it!

This soup definitely needed some brown sugar and more seasonings. I guess canned pumpkin can not substitute for roasted butternut squash, that was my first mistake.

Made this the day after Thanksgiving and added all our leftover vegetables; mushrooms, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts (chopped onto smaller chunks). Used a generous spoonful of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and ginger. Turkey broth instead of chicken. Didn't blend it, just left it chunky.  Even my picky-eater father-in-law finished every bite. Great taste and good way to use up leftovers.

I added a cup of cooked split peas to the blender and used 2% milk instead of cream. As others suggested, I used pumpkin pie spice and added a little brown sugar. Word to the wise: it's probably not a good idea to put hot broth in your blender or food processor. Let it cool first or melt a few ice cubes in it. 
Also, I felt the croutons were too big when cut into 8 pieces, but maybe that's just my personal preference.

Easier than butternut squash soup.  After simmering 1/2 an onion and broth, I added 1/2 the second can of broth to cool it a bit then used the hand blender in the pot.  Added the rest of the broth, and as others suggested, added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp cayenne and cut salt down to just a pinch since I used regular chicken broth.  Could still use more spices.  Changed cream to 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup half and half.  Will make again.

The first time I made this, I was disappointed. It didn't turn out AT ALL the way I had hoped; I had imagined a sweeter soup rather than a more vegetable, autumnal-style one. This is, of course, not the recipe writer's fault. It just wasn't what I had wanted. However, I added 1 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batch, and lo and behold, I had my sweet pumpkin soup! It was wonderful! I served the variation at Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!

Made this for Christmas.  Skipped the croutons.  I used canned low fat/low salt Chicken Broth so mine was not too salty as others had experienced.  I added a small dollop of creme fraiche sprinkled with pinch of sesame seeds and marjoram - it was a wonderful add for the holiday meal.  We served a small cup to all our guests with the main meal.

Should have read the reviews, way to salty. Probably due to the already salted broth. I added apples and a sweet potatoe. It was nice.

Fantastic soup! Came out rich and creamy! I never tried a pumpkin soup before I made this so I can't tell you how it compares to others. All I can say this was very tasty and that I'll definitely make this again.

I would use light cream instead of heavy cream.  The cream overpowered the pumpkin and it tasted more like cream of onion soup.  So I added more pumpkin to compensate the threw in a sprig of fresh thyme for a little more flavor.  I gave it five stars based on my modifications but if I were to rate it on the original recipe, would have rated it at four stars.

SUPER yummy, cream, autumnal soup-- perfect with smoked turkey sandwiches. Important thing to note: If you used the amount of salt the recipe calls for, this dish would almost certainly be inedible.  I used regular chicken broth and maybe 1/4 tsp. additional salt.  Even that was almost too salty.  So go easy on the salt!  I also added additional cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and I did not make the croutons.  This will definitely be a "go-to" fall staple in our house!  Although I may cut back on the fat next time...it's extremely rich with all the cream and butter (I went exactly by the recipe on those amounts).

I finally got around to making this soup and totally regret not making it sooner! What an amazing fall soup to add to my collection! Of course, I followed the suggestions of others and added a pinch more of spice here and there and even added nutmeg and the glob of brown sugar everyone suggested. I cut back to 1/2 cup of onion (I always cut back my onions). It was awesome! I must say, if you enjoy pumpkin then I really don't see why you wouldn't completely love this recipe!

I just finished making this.  I used my own homemade pumpkin puree and added some extra cinnamon, pumpkin spice and nutmeg and an 1/8 cup of brown sugar.  I'm not sure of the quantities as I "eyeball" spices.  I added a dollop of sour cream too.  I did taste it before I added anything extra.  It was good but changed it to suit my tastes.

I rate 5 stars but I did do it quite differently...

I didn't use butter--boiled the onion in water mixed with salted chicken broth and two chopped potatoes. Once cooked, I blended this (in portions) and returned it to the pot.
 
Next, I  blended the pumpkin with 2% milk and added it to the pot with the blended onion/potatoes. Added cinnamon,  ginger, ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and a few shakes of cloves & nutmeg...and salt to taste. (I didn't need to add salt because it was in the chicken broth)

Delicious. :)

too rich.  the flavor is good, and i guess it lives up to the claims because it basically tastes like liquid pumpkin pie.  but it was too heavy for any of my guests to enjoy.  two bites and then it was overwhelming. on the plus side, it's great as a sauce on ricotta cheese or ice cream.

I love this soup.  I also made it using butternut squash instead of the pumpkin.  I added a few packets of sweet and low (to my liking) and fat free half and half instead of heavy whipping cream.  Amazing!  Everyone loved it!  Such a nice sweet and warm soup for Fall.  Can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving!

Made this several times from Halloween through Christmas.  I took it to family gatherings where some people were a bit skeptical.  Everyone loved it!  Even non-pumpkin lovers.

This will be a new favorite soup for me- it is delicious! I didn't bother with the bread, halved the recipe, sauteed the onions until they carmelized, added a tablespoon of maple syrup, didn't bother to blend it, and used evaporated milk in place of the whipping cream. This was mellow, creamy, and nicely balanced in flavors and I can't wait to have some more tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great soup!  I did take the reviewers suggestions and added 2 more cans of pumpkin, doubled (or maybe even) trippled the spices.  I did add cayanne for that kick because it seemed like something was missing.  Plus added 1/4 C of Brown sugar.  If I made it like the recipe said, it would be very very bland.

This soup is amazing! I made plenty of pumpkin puree and plan to make this a few more times before the end of the year! Highly recommended and easy. The cinnamon crutons were such a nice addition!

I really enjoyed this soup.  It makes the house smell wonderful and tastes great.  I was not a fan of the crutons as the sugar on top burned.  I will make it again without the crutons though because it's great without them.  Used evaporated milk instead of cream for health and threw in extra brown sugar and a dash of cayenne as reviews recommended.

I don't think it had enough pumpkin and or too much cream. Made recipe as written. Tasted then I went to the reviews and mixed and match until I got the recipe to suit my taste.

This soup was incredible. I followed the other recommendations and added extra brown sugar. Next time I'll carmelize the onions to see if that adds some sweetness. I used low-salt chicken broth and 2% milk plus a bit of half and half. I think it was perfect that way and wouldn't bother with the heavy cream. This is a keeper but I want to figure out a way to sweeten it up without so much sugar.

Very tastey.  I added extra ginger and it made it spicey.  I also used whole milk instead of cream to cut the fat down.

I thought it was pretty good. Not the best soup i have ever made as i think it is a little rich and cannot imagine eating it more than one or two times, but did hit the spot. I just used the recipe as a guide. I melted about 1 tablespoon butter and about 1/4 cup brown sugar. Added 2 cans veg. broth. 2 cans water. 1 huge can pumpkin puree. Added cinnemon. Let cook for about 10 min. Then, added 2 cups cream. Pretty yummy. My kids ate it and are pretty picky usually, so that was a plus. super easy and tasted like fall!

Really good! I added a chicken bouillon cube to the onion simmer as well to increase flavor a bit.   I would have liked it to be a tad bit thicker, but it still tastes wonderful!

After reading a few reviews, I made the following changes which resulted in a tasty bowl of soup: Added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 pinches of nutmeg, a shake of pumpkin pie spice and a shake of cayenne, used 1 cup of skim milk instead of the cream and served the toast cut into triangles on the side. I had the soup the following day and it tasted better!

I highly advise making the cinnamon croutons yourself. That is what made this recipe. It was a bit tedious to make, but it was really good! If you are serving several, double the recipe. Thanks!

Good way to use up leftover pumpkin puree during the holiday season. Sadly, the flavor wasn't great - I played around with a few spices and brown sugar to improve it, but never really loved the result. Maybe I'm just not a savory pumpkin person. My boyfriend liked it, though.

My first attempt at creamy-squash-type soup, and it was great! It was kind of an impromptu thing, basically I had leftover pumpkin after baking a "Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake" from this site, and looked up a soup for fun. I didn't have a lot of ingredients (no onions or heavy cream), but added minced garlic and just used milk instead, and it was nice and simple. Followed other comments to add brown sugar too, and it turned out really good. Personally, I might like it a little thicker, probably where the heavy cream comes in.

I truely enjoy this recipe with a few modifications.  I always double the cinnamon and ginger and add 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  I also add 1/3 cup of bown sugar [I suppose I could use 1/4 cup, but I like my soup a little sweeter than some. ;)] I only use a pinch of black pepper and I add 1/16 to 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper (depending on my eaters' tolerace for spice).  I skip the salt and throw in a few salted roasted pumpkin seeds for added texture. Garnish with leftover seeds and a sprinkle of nutmeg. Yum! Family favorite.

Th e first time we had pumpkin soup was on a cruise.Thought ,how weird, we tried it & loved it. so on halloween 09, i decided to try & make it. It turned out GREAT. I probably added less onions, more pumpkin,brown sugar,nutmeg. I will make this again.It is not the type of soup you would make a whole meal of, but very yummy & impressive.

this is the very first time i have heard of pumpkin soup! I was interested. i followed in others suggestions of adding more brown sugar along with sprinkling cayenne pepper and basil to taste. The soup turned out great, maybe a little too sweet, but i will make it again! I also topped my bowl off with a scoop of sour cream, that set it off well!

YUM! But with a few changes.  I added about 2 tbsp brown sugar to the recipe and added a little extra cinnamon and some all spice.  I blended it lightly so it was still a little "chunky".  The cinnamon croutons were a great touch!  Perfect fall dinner!

Delicious after I made the changes suggested by others on here. Added a little more cream for a richer soup. Loved it!

Best Pumpkin Soup I've ever made...and I've made a lot. I also doubled the spices and added nutmeg and then paprika to give it a little kick. I've always added root vegetables to my pumpkin soups, normally parsnip and carrot but I only had carrot so I added it to the first stage and boiled until tender. I also added about a cup of corn. I puree until theres still some particles because I like the texture. The corn and carrot ingredients made it naturally sweet and so i lastly drizzled about 1/8 cup of maple syrup in. I did not add any salt as the broth had enough in it. This was delicious and I may have to make  a second batch because for my guests because it's all I want to eat tonight hehe. I suggest tasting and tasting and tasting all the way through adding any extra ingredients. This would be nice to garnish with a little heavy cream swirled in or some maple syrup.

I made this recipe as is and my husband and I found it very bland and that is the reason for the 3 star rating.  Instead of tossing it I just did a bit of tweaking and now it is one of my fav soups of all time!  I added twice the amount of ginger and cinnamon called for making it 1/2 tsp of each.  Added 3 TBS of brown sugar and just a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.  Sensational!  With the changes I'd give it 5 stars!

Seriously delicious - even for pumpkin haters - i.e. my boyfriend.  :)  I even got paid to make a batch for a friend's Halloween party at work. This recipe is a keeper and one to make each year.

I'm not really liking it! like pp said - I too almost dumped the whole pot in the sink, as it really doens't taste like pumpkin soup I used to have in Germany. I taste too much like pumpkin pie for me at first, BUT if you are patient with it and let it simmer for a while and add other spices to it, it's edible. My husband and I didn't like it that much but it's edible.

I used this as a baseline because it seemed to be the most popluar but it was bland.Not wanting to throw it out I sauteed 3 shallottes in butter, omitted the ginger in hopes of a more savory taste and added sea salt,cracked pepper and some smokey habanero sauce.Served with warm crusty bread and honey butter,it was something.

Great soup, I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar but that was too sweet.  Definitely will make it again but with less brown sugar.

I made this for my family and they love it!!! The BEST pumpkin soups Ever! So creamy are good! The one thing thought I have to say is it was a little bland at first so to add a little more salt, and to add a little bit of sugar!

A great starter soup, not sure if I could just sit and eat a large bowl for a meal but very tasty! I didn't try the toast but will next time. I doubled the cinn. and ginger, also added a pinch of nutmeg, 2T of brown sugar and 1/8t of garlic pwder. This was very quick and a great fall soup

This is an excellent soup.  I love the croutons; they add so much!  I've made this a number of times, and the only thing I change is the type(s) of pumpkin I use.  I usually steam my own, either baking pumpkins or kabocha.  Also, depending upon how much I want to health it up, I change the cream to half&half or milk, or a combination of the two.

I did this as the recipe stated but had to add ingredients at the end. It needed more flavoring for me. I added brown sugar and more spices.

This was good!  The reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is b/c the "croutons" got super soggy in the soup and turned to mush and that was unappetizing.  I ended up fishing them out and then just dipping the whole bread in it...which was a lot better!  Soup had great flavor and crouton bread was delicious!!!

3 1/2 stars - Right ingredients, but not in the right quantities.  I added extra pumpkin puree, about 1.5x the amount of spices in the recipe, nutmeg, and .25x the salt.  Instead of whipping cream, I used whole milk.  I didn't want it to be too thick.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice now. The only thing I changed was adding white sugar to it. For some reason I have always associated pumpkin with a sweet taste. It was excellent. I also recommend doubling the sugar spread for the toast because it seemed hard to spread over as many slices as the recipe calls for. This is perfect for a crisp fall day.

Awesome!  I followed all reviewer suggestions.  Next time I will go ahead and use the heavy whipping cream instead of half & half to make it creamier.  Hubby said it was not "thick" enough.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

After the 1st time making it, the 2nd time I made a bunch of changes & it came out soooo yummy - reminded me of Thai food!  For the soup base: omitted the onion & broth, simmered the pumpkin with 1/2 cup of brown sugar, dbl all the spices plus adding 1/4 tsp of cayenne & nutmeg.  Tasted as I spiced it up & lastly added whipping cream & then stored in fridge for 2 days.  Day of serving: softened 3 very small onions, then added broth, chopped 1/2 red bell pepper & 1 small yam covered until cooked, then cooked chicken tenders & chopped after cooked thru.  Once everything was cooked through I added the pumpkin base.  Delicious over rice too.

Really lovely spice to this pumpkin soup. I used butternut pumpkin which did't have as much colour as I couldn't get puree and added a little more pepper and less cinnamon. Tasted great!

I was pleasantly suprised by this. It's a rich & flavorful bisque-like soup. I served it for halloween dinner with a green salad. I taste tested it before serving and decided to add a tablespoon of brown sugar and some more cinnamon. I didn't really want it to be sweet, but felt it needed just a touch.  My only complaint is about the croutons. I baked the bread for about 15 minutes and when I added it they just ended up being soggy pieces of bread in the soup. I liked the cinnamon bread idea though, so I think next time I'll just serve it on the side.

I like this recipe.  It is amazingly sweet for a dish that has no sugar in it.  I didn't like the "croutons" with it, and even without them, the soup still is on the sweeter side, so I think putting brown sugar in, as other suggested, would be way too sweet for my taste.  I do think a little more pepper would be a good idea, though.

This was an interesting recipe, but much too salty for my taste. It was also a bit bland. But I bet it would be great without the salt and with some cinnamon and/or nutmeg added to it!

This soup was very versitile. I found that it worked well on both the sweet and savory side with just a few additions either way.  My family loved it.

Good! Especially after I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added in some brown sugar & maple syrup. I might leave out the croutons next time. They weren't very popular, although the soup itself was.

Amazing! I used vegetarian chicken stock (double dose) and substituted a tsp of allspice and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for the other spices. Very spicy and yummy!

This was a great soup but I think the recipe itself comes out a little bland. Like other reviewers, I added more and different spices and half the salt. Next time I will add less cream because I thought it tasted before the cream. I also added shredded carrots for a little texture. I did not make the croutons.

Okay. This was my family's first introduction to pumpkin soup and it was okay, not our family fav by no means,  but not that bad either. The texture was great, but the taste is an acquired one. I will note I did add 1tsp of pumpkin spice to the recipe to add a bit more flavor.

Only gave it 4 stars because as it was it was a bit bland. I followed others suggestions and omitted the salt and reduced the onion to 1/2 cup, which I am glad I did. It was a bit salty and you could taste the onions but it still seemed like it was missing something. I added brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice to taste to make it more flavorful. I'm making this for a cooking club get together. Hopefully my husband likes this because if he does it will be a staple for holiday get togethers. It's delicious!

This was really great and the crouton's added the finishing touch!..Only feedback would be a bit too much onion as recipe called for.. so I added a few more shakes of ground cinnamon (3-4)to subdue the "too-sour" taste before I added the cream. Was a hit!

Okay, I think my problem was that when I eat pumpkin, I want it to taste like pumpkin pie. This was my first venture away from pumpkin in a dessert... and I didn't like it at all.  It was like baby food with way too much onion, and I only used half an onion.  I can understand how some might like it.. but it's not for me.

Fantastic!  I only had 1/2 a can of pumpkin so I added one sweet potato and one carrot.  Added extra cinnamon and ginger but will half the salt next time.  Also added a little bit of nutmeg and maybe 2-3 Tablespoons brown sugar.  This one's definitely a keeper - excellent for fall!

I had been looking for a recipe like this for a while and my family loved it!  I did follow a few of the changes that some of the reviewers made: doubling the spices (I almost always do that in baking) and adding the brown sugar.  I found some pumpkin cranberry wheat ciabatta bread to go with it too!

My roommates and I made this for a dinner party we had with our friends. At first we were wary, none of us had ever tried pumpkin soup before. Everyone at our party loved this soup. The croutons were especially a hit, everyone asked for more. I highly recommend this recipe.

The soup is quite good, but it has a very strong, almost overpowering onion flavor.  I added extra spices to help mask/balance out the onion.  Next time I may try using the half the onion and substituting yams, potatoes, or even some fresh squash.  I also used evaporated milk in place of the cream to cut down (a bit) on the calorie/fat content.

This turned out wonderful, though I changed it a bit. I boiled celery, onions, and carrots in the chicken broth until soft and then blended them in a blender. Then transferred the creamy base back to the pot and added the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice and curry.

I usually don't make the croutons but this soup has been a hit with my family for several years.  It has  become a holiday tradition in my household.

This was really easy to make and very tasty! I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of cayenne. I also left off the croutons, but served it with breadsticks for dipping. Yum!

This recipe was disappointing and did not nearly have the flavor I hoped for.  Next time, I'll use less onion and cream, more cinnamon and add ground cloves.

This is a great recipe! Very easy to prepare. If your food processor isn't very large then add in the onion/broth mixture a little at a time - otherwise the liquid will flow over.

I made this soup for Thanksgiving dinner and my whole family loved it.  Before I added the cream it was very salty, but the cream took care of that problem, I would make it again.

I made this for my wife's birthday dinner on Oct. 31  It was so good she asked me to make it for our Thanksgiving Dinner.

It has the right mix of spices to give it a little "tang" without being overpowering or bland.  

The croutons - well, these were less than desirable and the soup holds up on its own without them.

I've now made this soup several times following the recipe. I've also modified the ingredients, such as using 2% milk in place of the cream in order to lower the fat contect and using some cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick. It is wonderful all three ways! This is now in my "repeat frequently" recipe file.

Nothing more comforting on a very chilly N.J. fall evening than this satisfying soup. I skipped the salt, used a "healty" canned broth and subbed the heavy cream with fat free half and half. Nothing was missed. I did, however, sprinkle in a bit of cayenne for a bit of a kick and only because I had leftover homemade applesauce, I threw that in too. Delicious Thomas and thanks so much!

I thought this recipe was a little to savory for me. I wanted it a little sweet, so I added white and brown sugar to taste. Next time I will only use a little onion.I only used 1/4 of a yellow onion, and the onion flavor was little strong for what I wanted. It was pretty good after adding the sugar though.

I made this for Halloween.  Excellent!  I only added butternut squash to thicken it and add a different flavor.  The croutons make this the best!  Even my VERY picky father-in-law loved this!  Thanks and I will be making this again and again!

This soup is always such a hit at our annual jack-o-lantern carving party!  The croutons are a great touch, and add that little hint of sweetness that intensifies the pumpkin spice flavor...My husband is a vegetarian and we used a "not-chicken" broth, and it was still wonderful.  We also added a smaller amount of cream, but had a small pot of it on the serving table so people could add it to taste.

My first attempt was too salty and not pumpkin-y enough. So I tried to add more pumpkin, but that just threw off the consistency, making it lumpy and bland. (That was probably my fault though.)I did really like the cinnamon croutons.

I love this soup. I make it exactly per the recipe for company or with milk (when it's just for me). I've made it dozens of times and you can't get a better, simpler soup. 

I tried the croutons long ago, but have stopped making them as no one here really liked them.

Yuck!  I did not care for this recipe at all. I think it was the combination of onion and pumpkin (and I only used half of a small onion). I even added extra spices and brown sugar with not much of an improvement.

This recipe was fantastic!  I like my squashy dishes a little sweet, so the croutons were a lovely touch.  However, I used fresh pumpkin from a whole pumkin.  I purchased a few smaller pumpkins and carved them out and made them into soup bowls.  They looked adorable, I didn't want to wreck it by consuming it. :)

I thought the soup had excellent flavor but my family didn't like it.  I did not make the croutons because that would have tasted so weird with pumpkin soup.  I'll try making 1/2 batch just for ME!

The more I make this soup, the more I crave it!  Perfect texture & flavor.  I leave out the croutons though, I don't feel they improve the soup & it makes it so much easier!

I used half and half just because I had it and it still turned out great.  Really smooth and creamy.  The bread croutons are a nice touch.

Wonderful recipe.  I even got my dad to try it and he's a really picky eater.  I doubled this recipe to compensate for all the guests, but I only used one small brown onion just for a hint of flavor.  But this was truly delicious.

I thought this recipe sounded odd, but we tried it since it got so many good reviews and because my husband loves pumpkin. We didn't even eat more than a few bites before we threw it out. It smells delicious- like pumpkin pie- but it tastes mostly like onions. We would not recommend this to anyone.

This soup tasted best when served right after making it.  I used nondairy creamer, for those lactose intolerant in the family.  I topped the soup with freshly grated romano cheese, for a little nutty flavor. (I skipped the croutons)

This is going to be the recipe I use every fall when the pumpkins are ripe.  Everyone in the family enjoys it and the croutons are a great idea in themselves.

I loved it!  Even my picky 6-year old said it was good and the canned pumpkin makes it soooo easy.  I didn't do the croutons and added a little cumin. I will use this on Thanksgiving.

Thank you Thomas for a fabulous soup. I made it Christmas Eve and it was a big hit with the adults. I could not get the teens to try it, but some day they will. It is better than the Pumpkin soup I had at the Radisson in Nassau recently.

I found this soup to be a bit too rich, though the flavor was good.  I recommend reducing the amount of cream and adding a bit of milk instead.

My, Oh, My......made this at work for Soup Day - we take turns making a big ol' pot o' soupy goodness for everybody once a week - and it went FAST and got many compliments...but best of all, my oh my, I found it positively scrumpdely-icious. Left out the whole crouton process to simplify and made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, to accomodate our veggie workmates - IT WAS STILL STUPENDOUS. Thanks for the recipe, thanks for the memories...true creamy goodness.

I liked this soup.  It tasted better after being in the fridge for a few days.  My family did not like the croutons.  I thought they were just okay.

This was fantastic!!! My 9 year old daughter and I made it together to try out before putting it on our Thanksgiving menu. She loved it and it was very easy! I did not try the croutons, but the soup was outstanding!
