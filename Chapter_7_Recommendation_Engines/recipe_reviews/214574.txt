This is pretty darn good.  So easy to prepare for a quick throw together week night dinner that resembles the flavors of thanksgiving!  I would serve it with sweet potato fries and green beans next time

Incredibly quick and easy! Personally i thought this was going to fail on the taste scale. This was way better than I imagined! the second time i used a mix of frosted flakes and corn flakes. I also didnt use whole berries, just sauce and it was still just as good, if not better!

5 stars for ease of preparation and  surprisingly good taste.  I liked it much better than I thought I would.  Definitely will make again!
