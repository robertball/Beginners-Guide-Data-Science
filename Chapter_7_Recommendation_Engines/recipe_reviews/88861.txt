I make this all the time. I use a 16 oz. jar of dry roasted unsalted peanuts, 1 Tbsp. canola oil and 1/2 c. Splenda. You can use any type of nut you like. The more oily the nut, the less oil you will need to add and vice versa. I've used cashews, almonds, walnuts and pecans. Sometimes I use a combination of all of them. That's when it tastes really good!!  Update - lately I've been adding 1/2 to 1 tsp. of hazelnut flavoring to my peanut butter. It's very good!

I live in Japan, and we cannot buy crunchy penut butter here. There are only skippy kinds of peanut butter. (very creamy and  very sweet ones) They are OK, but they are too sweet for me. I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted natual and  not sweet at all. Perhaps I could add one more tbs of honey. A good thing about this recipe is you can make the peanut butter in any way you like. :D

This is a great recipe!  I used my blender to process the peanuts, and it worked great!  My 2 year old loves it, so it must be a hit!  thanks!

I will never buy a jar of peanut butter again! This was so Easy and Delicious!!! We like crunchy pb, so I chopped some in the food processor first, then added them to the finished product. Mmm...sooo GOOD! Thanks for this Amazing recipe! Update: Made this again using unsalted peanuts that I drizzled honey over, then added about a half tsp of salt to and baked on a cookie sheet covered in tinfoil and sprayed with pam at 350 for 15 min. I let them cool then threw in the food processor, mmm even better!

After having store bought peanut butter my whole life.  I'm a little sad that I missed out on such great taste.  Also, I made mine with Olive Oil to try to health it up a bit.   I will say this is absolutely the best peanut butter i've ever had.

It never occured to me to make my own!  Loved it!  Used canola oil though.  I had unsalted nuts, so I added in a pinch or two of salt.  A new keeper that I will use often.  My son loves PB and J!  Thanks for sharring it!

Yum! I never knew that peanut butter could be made at home. I didn't really measure the ingredients, just threw them together and this turned out yummy! Will definitely make again with other nuts as some other reviewers suggested. Will make again and again.

The taste is really good although I had trouble trying to process it till it's fine. Perhaps I used the wrong type of food processor/ blade. Thanks for the recipe, Amber!

This is a very easy, delicious, healthy and inexpensive alternative to grocery store peanut butter. I just threw the peanuts in the blender, added enough oil for the desired consistency and then sweetened it up with some honey. Voila!

Great to know what's in your peanut butter.  I gave 4 stars because it didn't need all the oil.  I suppose how much oil you'll need depends on your peanuts.  I used less than 3 Tbsp to 3 cups of peanuts.  So I recommend you add it slowly as you need it.  I also have a small processor, so it took much longer to get creamy.  I did it in 3 batches.    Mine also didn't come out truly creamy, but perhaps that's due to the power of my processor.  That's fine though, cause I like it with texture, anyway.  Very tasty, and economic, too!

I followed the recipe exactly and expected a creamy, though slightly chunky peanut butter, but after it sat ten minutes it turned dry and crumbly, though I added the stated oil amount?  Maybe I did something wrong cuz everyone raved how great it was, no one else mentioned crumbly.  Anyway, it really tasted good, like the inside of a Reese cup, so I may make somekinda dessert w/it, but I can't spread it on bread.  Sorry.

Yummy! The kids love it and think I should continue to make peanut butter at home. The directions say to store it in the refrigerator but that didn't work. It was as hard as a rock and crumbled apart instead of being spreadable. Keeping it in the cupboard works fine; we just have to stir in a little before using it.

This was tasty. I had a jar of roasted unsalted peanuts leftover from another recipe and found this. I could not believe how much of a rich peanut flavor this had over regular store bought peanut butter in a jar. I also liked that I had the option to not add the honey and I didn't. With the amout of oil suggested the peanut butter had some peanut bits in it. I added a little more vegetable oil and it became more smoother. Although, I think I preferred the coarser texture a little more. It fit well in a container I have with a twist on lid for easy fridge storage. TY

I am usually a huge fan of crunchy peanut butter, but this is unbelievably delicious! I used 5 tablespoons olive oil and 3 tablespoons honey for 3 cups of salted, roasted peanuts and thought it was perfect.

Noor-if it's crumbly then you just need to add more oil until you get the consistency that you like.  I've been making Pb this way for years, but never add sweetener(or salt).  It's great with just the peanuts and oil.

Loved the recipe. Made it as stated on the recipe. My husband said it tastes like reese's peanut butter. It is very thin, but it thickens when refrigerated. Having tried it with salted roasted nuts, next time I will make it with unsalted roasted peanuts and adjust the salt to taste. Also, I will reduce the oil to 3 TBSP as it was a bit too thin for my taste. But overall we liked it and will make again with some adjustments.

This is the second time I've made peanut butter - I really haven't swayed from the recipe but I do not measure - just go with the taste & texture. 
Someone mentioned splenda in a review...I think next time I will try some stevia - maybe half stevia - half honey!? I do use Olive Oil though!
Thanks for the recipe!!

Edit of my original review:

So I tried this recipe again. This time, instead of dry roasted peanuts, I used fried peanuts (these are easily obtainable at the market in the country where I live). I also think that the peanuts were better quality. They were fatter and better tasting before I even used them (I know this because I still had some peanuts left from the last batch and compared them). The mixture balled up, just like the recipe said it would. I think overall this was a much better outcome. I also threw a handful in at the end and only pulsed a couple times to get a crunchy version. I really think that it all comes down to the QUALITY of the peanuts! I did change my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.

Original review:

This was an easy recipe to follow, but even after several minutes of processing, the peanut 'meal' was not producing any oil or balling up as the recipe said it would. I ended up adding the peanut oil to help it become liquid or saucy. The consistency of the peanut butter ended up 'sandy' and more oily rather than a buttery consistency but the taste was good. Even though the peanuts were pre-salted, I still added a little sea salt. I didn't add the honey as I am trying to stay away from the extra carbs. I will try it again with different peanuts. Maybe that was the problem?

I used 3 cups of organic roasted, unsalted peanuts, Himalayan pink salt, olive oil and a squirt of honey.  I didn't measure anything but the peanuts, I just went by taste.  Threw everything into my Cuisinart and done.  So easy, and really, really good.  I'll have to label it so my husband doesn't feed it to the dog.  I bake my own bread and make my own jam and preserves, so this was the perfect thing to make.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe! I never knew making peanut butter could be so easy. I wanted to start making my own peanut butter because I am trying to minimize the amount of palm oil I consume. Therefore I made this with coconut oil and it turned out great! I also don't have a food processor so I just used a blender, and it worked fine!

I made this tonight and am very pleased. I used olive oil and local honey. The real test will be when I have it on my toast.
