WOW! I can't believe this cake has as few calories as it does. Who needs all that fat when you have recipes like this! It's one of the best cakes I've ever had especially if you love coconut like I do! What a keeper!

This recipe is as rich and delicious as the Coconut Mounds Cake. Hard to believe its a light version. Since I LOVE coconut, I doubled the coconut topping so that I could use it as a filling between two nine inch round cakes. Also doubled the frosting to ensure I would have enough to frost the whole cake. Yummy!

This is THE BEST recipe.  I made it in 2 round cake pans and put the coconut topping in between the layers and covered it with the icing.  It was so moist and not too rich--coming from a chocolate lover!

This was absolutely great!  Very moist and it certainly doesn't taste light! It went over very well at a family gathering. I'm looking forward to making it again and again.

I was very disappointed with this cake. I wanted something different that the chocolate sheath cake I've been making for years.  The coconut topping sounded fantastic.  It was, but the base of the cake is really just boxed cake, and the chocolate icing was not nearly as good.  Next time I will simply add the coconut/marshmallow topping to my sheath cake recipe.

I am a coconut FIEND and I loved this cake.  I will be making this again soon since I ate almost all of it myself.   All I can say is thank goodness it is a light recipe!  I added food coloring to the coconut layer to match our home team and brought it to a football get together.

Great cake! I just baked the cake according to box directions. I make 3 - 8" layers with lots of coconut filling in between and then heat a store bought fudge icing slightly and pour on (hard to spread with coconut oozing out between the layers. I pack extra coconut in the frosting on the sides of the cake. Using Mounds brand sweetened coconut flakes makes all the difference. YUM!

I just thought this was alright. 

It was a little dry. I won't make again.

YAWN! This was simply plain chocolate cake with a tasty coconut topping. I was looking for "fabulous" and this fell short for me (sorry). The coconut topping was delicious (5 stars for the coconut topping) and I'll use it for other recipes, and perhaps on ice cream. The chocolate frosting was mediocre - nothing special. I followed the cake box directions instead of the recipe and that probably made it better. I also used half-n-half for the milk portions, which also helped. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, because 3 doesn't seem good enough, and 4 is too good. Thanks anyway! I'm sorry I didn't like it as well as those who've preceeded me in their opinions! I'll keep looking!

The coconut and chocolate toppings were wonderful, but the cake was VERY dry and obviously a low fat version.  Thankfully the moisture from the coconut/marshmallow layer did soak into the cake layer a bit, so it wasn't quite so dry after a day or two.  Also rather than trying to spread the chocolate layer over the coconut, I drizzled it all over for a very pretty end result.  This recipe would have been wonderful using a wacky cake for the cake layer.
