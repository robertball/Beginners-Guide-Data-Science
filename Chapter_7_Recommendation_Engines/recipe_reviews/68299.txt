Very nice recipe! It is good to have another flavor to combine with venison besides italian dressing. I'm not a big fan of frying food so next time I will lessen the oil called for and just saute until done. Really a good flavor even if you don't have enough time to marinate for the full 4 hours. I will definitely make again. Thank you!

This is such a simple recipe and so good. I don't eat venison, but I cook it alot, and this recipe stands out as simple, requested often and no-fail. I would make sure not to use a really thick teriyaki sauce, nor one that is too sweet. But if you have a good teriyaki marinade, and a nice flavorful cajun/creole spice blend this is a wonderful way to have a little sweet, a little spicy...I think that it would also be good on goose or other dark game meat.

Excellent!! I'm not a huge fan of heat, so I made my own Creole seasoning using paprika, salt, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, ginger, onion powder, and black pepper. Other than that I made it to the recipe and it was AMAZING!! Will definitely make again!! Thank you!

This was SO delicious! My husband took his first bite and said, "this is good". On his second bite, he exclaimed "this is REALLY good! Where'd you get the recipe?!" Go and make this tonight, you will not be dissapointed. I do reccomend to go light on the spices if you dont like spicy things. We could deffinately tell there was some kick to it! Will make this again, and again!

Good even if you don't marinate it very long.  You can probably experiment with the spices a bit to alter the flavor some.

Overall, a tasty venison dish

I have eaten venison all my life and although I really liked the combination of the teriyaki and garlic with the seasoning, when I cooked up my venison it was a little tough. Next time I think I will for go the flour and just marinate it overnight and then put it in the crockpot to cook during the day. Venison in the crockpot always comes out so tender. I served mine over rice and stir fry veggies which was very good.
