Great sandwich.  Only problem is that it is a little difficult to eat - it is difficult to hold as it tends to slip and slide and fall apart.  I think it might be better to make it in a round loaf of bread and cut it into triangle sections for easier handling.  Next time I'll only use 2 tomatoes - 3 was too many. Great olive tapenade!!

This was delicious.  I used turkey instead of salami to make it a little less salty.  I also weighed the sandwich down with two cast iron skillets to flatten it a little bit.

This is a great sandwich that's perfect for the men in your life. Nice and hearty. I made this the night before, wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap, put it on a plate and weighted it down. The following day the flavors had come together and it was much easier to take to the beach and eat. Thanks!

Tasty!  For the olive mix I added some roasted red peppers.  Probably not necessary because it really toned down the yummy olive flavor.  I would suggest no adding the olive oil in step 1 since the olives have plenty of juice (this will keep your bread a bit drier).  All in all a tasty filling sandwich that you can make the night before and just grab it for lunch when you leave the house.

GREAT sandwich!  I made this the night before, cut it into portions for the kids and husband, wrapped it in plastic wrap.  The next morning, everyone just had to grab their portion, some fruit, and a snack and their lunch was ready to go.  My husband's co-workers could smell it while he was having lunch and wanted some.  The kids' friends at school could smell it and wanted one as well, one friend even had a taste of the tapenade and tried to jokingly steal the sandwich from my daughter.  The kids and husband all came home raving about how good it was for lunch.  I look forward to making this for our trips to the beach with extended family this summer.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Great presentation! Too heavy on the olive taste for us. Will try again with a less strong olive base.

Love it!  I left out the red onion.  My husband ate one before I got home and he sent me a text that said, "Yummy sandwich!"  :)

These sandwiches were the star of the party (of 12 guests)! The tempanade was what really made the sandwich great! I could not find pitted kalamata olives but refused to comprimise so that was a time consuming part of the preparation. I used two giant round loaves of a 7grain type bread and hollowed out a good few inches of the center and it was still a tall sandwich. Best to make ahead and let sit several hours in the fridge. We served it with N.Orleans Gumbo and it was super Yummy!

I made this sandwich, didn't change a thing, and everyone enjoyed I! I didn't have a food processor so I diced the olives very small. Still tasted pretty good.

This was great to take to a potluck lunch, because I could make it the day before and it didn't have to be heated. I used a jarred olive bruschetta, instead of making the olive mixture from scratch. I soaked the sliced onion in ice water for a couple of hours, to remove any bitterness. And I drizzled olive oil on the inside tops of the bread.  People said the sandwich was delicious. I can't eat meat, but I sure wanted to eat this. If I could have eaten it I probably would have rated it a 5. (I weighted it down, as other reviewers suggested. An important step.)

Didn't add some of the ingredients due to not liking it to begin with however it turned out good. I wanted something for Fat Tuesday and thought this would be something we could enjoy. Pretty Good.

No real changes, I’d call them tweaks,  no secrets here.... great sandwich. Super savory.
