I got confused with the directions. The cream cheese layer and the blueberry layer mixed together when I out it on top of the gelatin layer. Is it missing in the directions that you need to chill before layer 2 and 3. This takes much longer to be ready than the 1 hour, 30 minutes stated at the top. Also, are you suppose to put cool whip on top? The directions are not very clear.

I have made this several times and it is delicious!  I have used both fat-free cream cheese and regular.  The fat-free mix came out a little lumpy but tasted just the same altogether.  I would definately recommend this salad! ~Elise

Yum! Everyone at a family gathering loved this recipe. I was a little worried at first with the half and half/unflavored gelatin mixture really chunky..but it all worked out in the end!

Great recipe, always make it for the 4th of July. You do need to chill between every layer and it does take longer than the time alloted.

I used to make this for 4th of July parties, but used both raspberry and blue raspberry Jell-O (rather than blueberry pie filling), and used lemon Jell-O mixed with Cool Whip for the middle "cheesecake" layer. It was a great combination of flavors- I highly recommend trying this variation!!

This sounds delicious but I need to know what "3 (6 ounce) packages raspberry flavored gelatin mix " means.  Is that 6 ounces total or are there 6 ounce boxes sold?  Hubby brought me 2 .3 ounce boxes and swears that's all they had.  Any help?  Thanks, Lynn

I brought this to a 4th of July party and it was a huge hit!  Everyone asked me to make it again for future parties!  Great summer dish!  Definitely chill between layers. Next time I will look for a blue colored gelatin to make the blue layer more blue. Delish!

UPDATE:  I have made this 3 times.  Tried it with blue raspberry jello for the blue layer and it didn't turn out very blue- better to stick with the red raspberry.  I also tried using the low-fat/Neuschaftel cream cheese and it doesn't work well- very lumpy and not a good choice!  
Also- use cool whip for the top layer and decorate with blueberries & strawberries.  You can make a star pattern if you don't want to make a flag.

Yummy!  I used the ingredients just as they were but made sure the cream cheese mixture was cooled and the jello was firm before adding the cream chesse mixture.  Also made sure the cream cheese mixture was firm before adding the blueberry jello mixture.  Served this at a party where a pastry chef friend was and she went back for seconds.  I took that as a great compliment.  Others also told me how pretty and good this recipe is.  Yes, this is a keeper.

This turned out PERFECT! Not only was it pretty but it was tasty too. Be sure to chill after each layer so the layers don't run together. I saw in another review that someone had that problem.

To be fair, I tried making this a "healthier" dessert by using sugar free jello, fat free half-and-half, fat free cream cheese, and fresh blueberries instead of the pie filling.  I still liked it but my friends said it was really "jello-y" and one also said it might taste less "curdy" if I had used regular cream cheese.  It's just that the jello v. cream cheese consistency didn't really work for most.  Probably right, although I do think it's a decent "healthier" dessert.  Gave it 3 stars instead of 2 since it's my fault I changed the recipe so much.

Was good light and filling. Make sure to let each layer completely chill or harden before putting on the next one. I also got a little confused with the picture because it doesn't say to put cool whip on or the berries but i did and boy did it add a lot. Next time i will be sure to make the gelatin before hand so it is much easier to serve.

My sister-in-law made this for Independence Day one year and I had to have the recipe.  It has become a "must have" for a Fourth of July celebration.  Thanks Sandy for posting the recipe and stating 6 oz. boxes of Jello in the ingredient list and I was stymied by that when I was reading my sister-in-law's recipe from 25 years ago :-)

I made this and I thought it was ok. It had a stronger "canned pie filling" taste than what I was expecting.  But several members of my family loved it!  I will definitely be making it again. It was  big hit with them.

confused about the picture for this recipe. The top layer is blue with the blueberries.and I have to agree it was confusing weather to chill the cream cheese layer because mine mixed with a blueberry as well.

I have made this a couple of times and have substituted the Blueberry Pie Filling with FRESH Blueberries!  Turns out fab and everybody loves it!
