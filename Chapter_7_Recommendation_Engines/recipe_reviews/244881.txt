I bought coconut sugar and almond butter for this recipe  (never had either before) and, honestly,  didn't care for the taste of the almond butter (most likely a personal taste preference) and couldn't taste the coconut sugar.  If you don't have the coconut sugar on hand, don't worry about that, as it's just not a dominant layer of flavor in this.  The oatmeal mixture very thick, so I added some milk to reach the consistency I prefer, added some chopped strawberries and a sprig of mint.  This was OK, but if I were to make again, I'd probably try good, old-fashioned peanut butter instead of almond butter.  I'll use the coconut sugar on other things, but, unfortunately, that small jar of almond butter will be heading to the curb this week.

This was OK, but pretty bland tasting. Also, I needed another 1/4 c water to get the consistency I like.

I made mine with honey instead of sugar.  Sometimes I use a cinnamon honey.  Yummy!

It lacked something - maybe sweetener or vanilla?

didn't use the almond butter and skipped the sugar and used stevia instead.
