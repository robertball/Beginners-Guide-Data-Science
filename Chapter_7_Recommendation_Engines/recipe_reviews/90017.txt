We all enjoy Kahlua, so I was very excited to try this for Christmas dinner. The Kahlua killed it and was not at all complementary in taste with the sweet potatoes. The flavors simply did not blend well together at all. This may have tasted better with less Kahlua used as an accent flavor to the sweet potatoes, but the recipe as written creates a clash of flavors each attempting to claim the dish. If making this recipe, I would suggest adding the Kahlua in small doses a little at a time until a nice flavor has been reached. This was the only dish that everyone turned down when it was time to pack left-overs and send them home with my guests. Sorry......but this recipe should state to add the Kahlua until the desired taste is achieved.

Oh yum!  This is a great side dish.  I followed the recipe exactly and it is delicious!  Be sure to use real unsalted butter, to get a great caramel flavor.  I used a yellowish sweet potato, as opposed to a yam.  I simmered the sauce a little after adding the kahlua, to cook off some of the alcohol.  The kahlua added a great unexpected flavor.  Sweet potatoes are so nutritious, you should eat them often, not just for Thanksgiving.  And use this recipe!

Made the recipe for 3 servings instead of 6. Called for 1/4 cup butter - used 3 tsps Butter Buds to cut fat and calories, 2 tsps water and 1 Tbsp butter. Next time I will use just Butter Buds and water. Called for 1/3 cup brown sugar - used only 2 Tbsp. It was more than sweet enough for me. To cut calories I will use only 1 Tbsp. next time. I liked the addition of Kahlua. Very tasty and would make again. My changes are only because I prefer to try and cut calories for myself. Didn't add raisins or pecans. Boyfriend also liked.

You don't need to add much liqueur, too much would certainly over-do it.  I made this with 4 very large sweet potatoes, 1 stick of salted butter, all the brown sugar called for and a little more than 3 tablespoons of Kahlua.  Very rich, very easy and very good.

My family and I found this recipe a little to Kahlua-e.  If I make it again, I will adjust the amount of Kahlua I use.  Thanks for sharing.

Very Good, I thought that the Kahlua taste may have been slightly overwhelming (even though i love kahlua), but no one else did. I made these for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner and they were a huge hit!

I found a very similar recipe without raisins and pecan. I made it this year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's a fantastic recipe. We love Kahlua so I double the amount of Kahlua and it was great.

Delicious! I took others advice and added kahlua slowly so I didn't use as much as the recipe called for. I also didn't have nuts, so I made it without and it was still very good.

I screwed up... this is my first time making candied veggies and I didn't read close enough.  So I put the sugar, etc. in while the potatoes were still in the pan.    Since they didn't candy, I just mashed them.  They were still a big hit.  I do agree that the next time I'll cut down on the amount of kahlua.  It was good, but 1/2 to 2/3 as much should work out fine for our tastes.

I used regular coffee instead of kahlua.  I also doubled the nuts and raisins because I didn't think there were enough.
