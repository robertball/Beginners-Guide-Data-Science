I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used regular milk.  Turned out perfect!

The recipe was great. Delicious for dinner that night and cold the next day for lunch. I cooked mine in the deep fryer.

This recipe's nutritional value cannot be anywhere near correct...it states that there is 8 chicken legs in the recipe and that there is 8 servings at over 500 calories per  serving...and over 3800mg of sodium per serving...something is really wrong with these numbers, one chicken leg could not possibly have this many calories and sodium...

Family enjoyed the chicken, I did 6 mins per side and it was perfect with the oil at 310 degrees F

First time I attempted fried chicken and my family was floored (they love to cook).  So crunchy and crispy that they demanded it a second night in a row.  Definitely, easy and one to add to the permanent repertoire!
