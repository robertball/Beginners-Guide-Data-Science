This was my first attempt at chili and it won first place in my office chili cook off!! (It won by a land slide, by the way.) I made a few highly recommended substitutions: pork chorizo instead of ground pork, a pound of bacon instead of the bacon bits, and fire roasted diced tomatoes. It was fantastic and I already have requests to make it again!!

Good recipe, but I used black beans instead of chili beans and doubled the cumin.  Added 2 tbls apple cider vinegar.
Was really good!

I made this dish according to the recipe.  The chili had undertones of smoke with a nice spicy taste.  Not too spicy as even my daughter who doesn't like anything spicy loved it..  Note, the recipe needs a large slow cooker.  The ingredients were more than my 4 quart one could hold!

I have never made chili before and made this the other night for 10 people and everyone loved it. There was none leftover. People said its award winning.

This Chili is the BOMB!!! With only 3 of us in the house I should have made a smaller batch, but this chili is as good the 2nd or 3rd time! We finished it off! Followed the recipe with the exception that I used taco sauce rather than chili sauce (couldn't find it). Just enough spice! Caught my wife twice sneaking a bowl in the middle of the day. But like someone else said, you need a big crock pot! Would give this 6 stars if I could. Great recipe!!

Loved this! So good. I cannot believe that tiny can of Chipotle gives so much amazing flavor!  I used spicy chili beans (from Kroger) and I think I may not use spicy ones next time as this was just a touch too spicy.  I like spicy foods but this one had me a bit flushed and sweaty!  

Will make again outstanding recipe and I'm really looking forward to leftovers this week.

Super yummy chili, I have made this recipe twice! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time I used black beans and garbanzo beans, since that is what I had. I also roasted a sheet pan of veggies in the oven, mishrooms, celery, carrots, peppers, zucchini, red and yellow onions, then added to the crock pot. Super yummy.

OMG this is the best chili my man and I have ever tasted and I'd say the best thing I've ever made! I love the amount it made. We've eaten it three nights in a row and still have enough for two more...and we're not sick of it. I didn't really change anything except I didn't put the "Frank's RedHot" in because I forgot to buy it. But it didn't need it at all! This chili will be in my regular rotation. Two thumbs up!

Fabulous chili! I also won my chili cookoff at work with this recipe. Everyone loved the smoky flavor of the peppers with the sausage. Thank you!
This does make a large quantity, I cut everything in half, but used all the ingredients listed.

Make the changes say in the comments. Bacon instead of bacon bits and chorizo. AWESOME.  It could be a bit spicy for some this way. Definitely a go too recipe from now on. Would be awesome for a chili cook off. Better the next day even after being in the slow cooker all day.

Awesome! It had a kick to it which was great but too spicy for my young daughter. I would probably skip the Rotel if I was making this for the kiddos but otherwise would keep it as is.

Not spicy enough. Needed more flavor,  cilantro and/or scallions would be a great addition.

This is the best chili I have ever had!  Everybody loves it- unless I make it too hot for them. :) I use turkey sausage and ground turkey.  Always fabulous! 

This is my number one go to recipe from the internet. period.

I omitted the beef and used kidney and garbanzo beans. I added extra cumin and adobo and omitted chili sauce and hot sauce. Too many ingredients. These changes made it easier and tasty.

This is what chili is supposed to taste like! Everyone I've made this for absolutely raves about it. It doesn't hurt that it's actually pretty simple to make.

This had a good flavor. Thick chili. Only thing I added was 1/8 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. Also I cut this recipe in half.

This is my go to, absolute favorite, chili recipe! I cut back on some of the ingredients as it's simply too much for my amateur crock pot. Today I'm giving it a healthy twist using ground turkey and spicy turkey sausage. Deliciously good!

We really liked this chili.  I did use just 1 can of Rotel and another chili ready can of tomatoes (he doesn't care for too spicy).  Makes a ton, I didn't scale down.  We will have it as chili mac tonight.  Tasty!

I used chorizo instead of Italian sausage. I also added a quart of canned caribou meat chunks I had in the pantry.  It turned out great.  If I make it again when my wife is home I would tone down the chipotle a bit.

I use sriracha instead of chili sauce and hot sauce - by far my favorite chili recipe. Nearly overflows the full size crockpot. Made it on the stovetop in my Dutch oven last time and it turned out great.

This recipe with the following modifications took 1st place in a chili cook off. It is now a regular request for large get togethers. 
Replace bacon bits with 1 lb of cooked and chopped bacon. Not too crispy. 
Add a few grilled jalapenos. 
Add one bottle of a good micro brew beer. 
2-3 tbs of Worcestershire sauce.
After the batch is made I add more chipotle to taste.

Very tasty!  I had to do this on the stove because my slow cooker and instant pot were too small. I used a poblano instead of the green pepper and used 3 cans of Rotel tomatoes (2 fire roasted and 1 habanero) for the diced tomatoes. Will definitely make again.

Very good, BUT watch the chipotle peppers if you don’t like fairly +  hot.  Maybe start with 1\3 the can. 
Thanks for posting.

I really like this chilli. But I use double chipotle peppers and hot sauce and chilli sauce. I'm still sweating! And the sausage makes interesting swing to the southwestern flavor.

Tasty! I made some changes - I used chorizo instead of Italian sausage and used real bacon. I also used most of the can of adobo and added cayenne. Def going to make again.

I love this recipe.  I've made it for football tailgate parties.  I add extra celery, a seeded jalepeno, I crisp 1/2 lb of bacon instead of bacon bits.  Everyone always LOVES it.  I serve with Fritos, cilantro, green onion, cheese, sour cream, jalepeno slices and most recently made some corn bread.  Huge hit.

This chili has the perfect amount of smoky heat and chunkinrss. I couldn’t find chipotle peppers canned in my local store and had no time to search the Hispanic store so I used the chipotle chili powder I had and it worked just fine. I also used a lb of chorizo with a lb of beef for added spice. Topping with fresh tomato and plain yogurt today!

I don’t really like chili. However, I loved this. My mom thought it was spicy, however, she’s 87 & not a spice fan. If I hadn’t been cooking for her, I would’ve upped the spice, I added sriracha to my portions. I did substitute ground pork & chunk pork with very little ground beef, but that’s mostly because I’m not a fan of ground beef. Very flavorful & it froze well to have some later. For people with bland palates, add sour cream.

I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and un-rinsed spicy chili beans. I was nervous it would be too spicy for my fiancé so bought sour cream for a topping, but it wasn't too spicy for him! I put a 7 qt. Crock Pot on our wedding registry because my 3-1/2 qt was full after just the meat and bell peppers, lol. Mixed everything up in a giant bowl and cooked two pots' worth. Excellent recipe, and I love leftovers!
UPDATE: Our first wedding gift was a new CrockPot! I made another batch yesterday and added a photo of it pre-cooked. It's more colorful that way. :)

Not too bad, but a little bit of a let down, considering the rave reviews. I made it for a family Chili Throwdown, and it came in 5th out of 6. I didn’t have chili sauce so I subbed ketchup, and, except for the can of chili beans in spicy sauce, I used dried beans (after soaking overnight) because we like them much better than canned. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It filled my lg crockpot to the brim, making stirring a bit tricky. Every time I stirred during the first couple of hours I removed the liquid that accumulated on the top before I stirred it. Probably took a cup of liquid out altogether.  The flavors of  the very small amounts of several ingredients were lost in this relatively large batch. If I make it again I would increase the amount of chili powder and increase the amount of bacon or leave it out (we could not taste it). A tbs of chili sauce would be undetectable in this recipe, so I would omit that or increase it as well. I loved the addition of chipotle peppers in adobo, and half the can was plenty. But somehow, for me, something was missing from this recipe. Maybe some black pepper, red pepper flakes, a tiny bit of cinnamon.

I wish I could tell you how it tastes, but I’m allergic to tomatoes. The husband loved it, though. I used liquid stevia instead of brown sugar. I used low sodium products where I could find them. All in all, a good chili! Thanks for the recipe.

I’ve made a lot of chili and this is certainly one of the best I’ve tried. Certainly the best slow cooker recipe. Like others, I changed a couple of things but basically stayed true to the recipe. I used a pound of real bacon rather than bacon bits, subbed chorizo for the Italian sausage, I doubled the cumin and I omitted the celery and green pepper and the hot sauce. It has good heat without the hot sauce and people can add it if they wish.

This was much better the second day. My first bowl was so overwhelming and heavy in flavor, I had a hard time finishing. I made the full batch with the intention of freezing most of it for later, however, I ended up giving most of it away to four different neighbors. If I ever make this again, I will cut the ingredients in half and omit the sausage and the chili beans. I think the ground beef is enough and I will just stick with kidney beans. (I've never used chili beans before and I wasn't crazy about the additional flavor.) I also used real bacon but couldn't even taste this due to the strong flavors, so next time, I will omit as well. I'm giving this four stars as it took me 1 hour and 15 minutes to prep.

This is a great chili-nice flavor.  I cut the chili powder in half and didn't add hot sauce because I have family members who are sensitive to hot stuff.  I used steak strips/tips instead of ground hamburg. It was a hit!

Diced hot Italian sausage instead of bulk sausage, and no bacon bits.

I will definitely make again.  It was delicious.  It went so fast I didn't get to take a picture. :-(  But I'm sure I will make it many more times.  Thanks for the recipe.

Some of the best chili I've ever made. Has all the good elements of a great chili: lots of beans, lots of good meat, and spices galore. I made a few mods: left out the celery and cumin (only because I realized I didn't have any after getting home from the store), added habaneros, and used some hot ground sausage with the Italian ground sausage.

Delicious! My new favorite chili recipe! Only problem was that it was too much for my crock pot. I had to cook half one day, then the rest the next. Froze a bunch of it. It is really awesome!

I made this for a chili pot-luck.  Everyone there raved and said how great it was.  Needless to say, I came home with an empty crock-pot!
