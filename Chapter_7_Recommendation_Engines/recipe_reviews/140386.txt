I keep thinking to myself, What a Blessing to be able to use what God has givin us and make something new! I already make my own bread and now  I can take 1 more thing off the grocery list, Breadcrumbs!!THIS RECIPE IS GREAT & VERY EASY!! I baked mine until they felt crisp and then let them cool, about 5 min, then put them in the Blender and WA-LA we had Fresh Breadcrumbs!! I didn't have to worry about what exactly was in them or what that company did to "make them better" because I was even the one who made the bread. Praise God from Whom ALL Blessings Flow. God Bless the rest of your day!

I put the toast in a big plastic freezer bag and rolled the rolling pin over it to crush the bread into crumbs. Easy and quick, love it!

Turned out perfect! A little more labor intensive than I thought however. 

I baked mine for half and hour and they were a little soft in the middle. Next time I'll bake for 35-40 minutes to ensure that they are baked through.

Works great everytime! Used the end slices (which nobody wants)and leftover rolls - whole wheat, sourdough, pumpernickle, and onion etc..! Baked for 20 minutes each side, cooled, put through food processor. Pour into zip bag and store in the freezer to keep fresh.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I found a full loaf of bread that we had ignored and I didn't want to waste it.  Once again, Allrecipes does not disappoint.  Found this recipe and it is great.  The only difference in technique is that I placed the bread on a cookie sheet rather than directly on the rack.  The timing was perfect.  Made a great meatloaft with oat nut breadcrumbs the next day.

Great way to use up that slightly stale bread, end pieces or other "undesirables"! ;)  Sometimes I do whoel wheat, sometimes a mix of whatever we have on hand.  If I'm not usingthem right away, I store them in a big ziploc bag in the freezer.  I prefer to leave them plain and season as I use them, but my favorite seasoning includes oregano, basil, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and grated parmesan cheese.

These turned out great!  The best breadcrumbs I've ever made.  After they were browned and cooled, I broke them into pieces and ran them through the food processor 3 slices at a time along with 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning.  It was fragrant and fresh and WONDERFUL!

This is a great way to use up older bread. I put the toast in a baggie and used a rolling pin to crush into crumbs. I don't know why I never thought of this before. I guess for Italian crumbs you could just add some Italian seasoning or other herbs. Thanks I will be giving this a lot of use.

This recipe works great for making breadcrumbs. When I get done processing them, I add salt, pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder, basil, oregano, and parsley to make Italian breadcrumbs. I never buy crumbs from the store anymore, and have been making these for about a year. Use these to bread anything, but my favorite is chicken parmesan!!

This came out amazing! Quick question though, if anyone knows: If I made a large batch of this and kept it in a container how long would it last? I didn't know if anyone made it in bulk and kept it. THANKS!

I put my bread slices under the broiler of my oven and the browning time is quick. I just watch it closely and turn the slices over when the top is the shade of brown that I want. You can put the slices in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin or crush with your hands, use the blender or food processor.

Such a simple thing to do, and it saves money! Probably healthier too. I added a few spices I had in the house: salt, pepper, basil, rosemary, and parsley. I use it on casseroles all the time now.

I never realized how easy it is to make breadcrumbs when you take the time to do it. How I regret all the bread I've thrown away over the years! I baked the slices on a cookie sheet instead of directly on the oven rack. I am going to add Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese to make Italian-style breadcrumbs; my favourite! I plan on storing it in the freezer because of the cheese and to ensure it stays fresh. Thank you for opening my eyes to something so simple... And the money I will be saving by not dishing out for a container of store-bought.

So easy and fresh! Used whole wheat bread and a lone whole wheat english muffin that was just about ready to be thrown out. Toasted and dried up nice in the oven....think it was a lil longer than 1/2 hr....but no worries. I pulsed the toasted breads in the food processor. Addded a lil sea salt, pepper, and dried parsley and used these crumbs to dredge and coat my eggplant slices. Great breadcrumb coating. Thanks!

Great and easy...just had to go 45 minutes, not the 30 minutes listed. To *crumb* I put bread in a gallon bag and used the blunt end of a meat tenderizer mallet.

I like that recipe, but I noticed that if you toast your bread in the toaster, grind it in the food processor, then bake it for around 10 minuted (or until golden brown) and grind it again in the food processor that the breadcrumbs turn out better cooked and finer ground. Also, this is a great way to use that old stale bread at the back of your refrigerator.

Great starter recipe. I was trying to find the ratio of crumbs to seasonings, but couldn't find it so I checked this recipe. I also use a jelly roll pan and flip them every so often. I crumble them on the pan and use a rolling pin to get the crumbs.

Pretty pleased that homemade bread crumbs are so easy to make! I used bread that either would have became toast or bird food so great way to use up older bread. I made some brown butter and tossed in a clove of garlic when I took of it off the burner to infuse some mild garlic flavor. I brushed the mixture evenly on both sides of the slices before placing them directly on the rack. I have to admit that I forgot about these guys and left them in the oven for a little over an hour but they were absolutely perfect! Can be labor intensive if you break the bread down with your hands but as another reviewer suggested, a plastic bag and rolling pin would work great and what I'll be using from now on to save time and cramped fingers. I'm sure these would be fantastic without the browned butter, but I'm making fried chicken with the crumbs so I'm not counting calories for this dish. Perfect for those who like controlling what goes into their food. Couldn't recommend enough!

I butter my bread and put a bit of crushed garlic on it. . . then i just take out when it's all as hard as a rock and use processor or blender--work BEAUTIFULLY in my sweet sour meat balls.
I also add a 1-2 TBlsp dry ranch mix (available at Costco in a BIG plastic jar) if I'm making meatloaf. Or if I'm making ham loaf (now about twice a year) with a glaze, I have actually added brown sugar to the breadcrumbs to deliver the base taste of the glaze evenly throughout.
.And like another poster pointed out--add some Italian herb if making meatballs for Italian dishes or as Italian toppings.  It's cooking--try to create something uniquely your own--even if it's the lowly breadcrumb.  Store these in glass jars to help keep them from landfills or oceans.  Commercial ovens get Breadcrumbs very dry--we can't so store short term in fridge or long term in freezer.

Good quick recipe when you’re in a pinch for some breadcrumbs. Super easy to do. I kept mine in the oven for 45 minutes to give it the toasted-ness needed to easily crumble into breadcrumbs.

I can’t believe I’m writing a review for making my own breadcrumbs, but this recipe was perfect when I had only Italian crumbs on hand and needed plain.

Turned out amazing! Store the leftovers in the freezer in a ziplock. Never wasting money on store-bought bread crumbs ever again. Thanks!!!

I haven't bought breadcrumbs in years because I learned to make them myself on Allrecipes. I'm sure this method works fine, but I change mine a bit because I mainly use bread crusts that I cut off the kids' bread. I keep a paper bag in my refrigerator during the week and place all the crusts in the bag. Then I lay all the crusts out on a baking pan. They only take about 10-15 minutes, because they are usually already mostly dried out.

Simple and works. Put into a plastics bag to break up into crumbs, and roll with rolling pin. Keeps the mess down

Can't believe I haven't done this earlier on. This is a great thing to do with all the left ends of the loaf. Thanks for the recipe!

Lovely results! Added a lot of Italian seasoning to a large batch. Its BETTER than store bought, prevents wasting stale bread, and when you make it from scratch, you are 100% sure of what is in your food!!

Great starting base for breadcrumbs. Add your favorite seasonings and voila! I did, however, have to cook it longer than stated.

Thanks so much for this base recipe! I sprayed mine with some olive oil spray, added garlic salt, and ground up italian seasoning herbs and sprinkled it on top of both sides. Baked at 250 for about 40-45 mins (used homemade bread - Grandma VanDoren's recipe on here). Perfection!

Great recipe. I used drying hamburger buns. Wheat and white.  After toasting I added salt, pepper, dried parsley, dried basil and grated Parmesian cheese. Used food processor to make mixture fine. Added crumbled bacon and put on top of au gratin potatoe recipe. Yums!!!

Worked perfectly.  Very simple.  I did place mine on a baking sheet and because of that it did take longer, but the method is foolproof!

I did something like this years ago, but forgot how.  Thanks, now I have this filed in my AR recipe box and I won't forget again.  I also like to be able to use whole grain bread crumbs.

This works, Folks!!  Also, do you like croutons on your salad or soup?  Do you like bread pudding?
The moral here is: NEVER THROW OUT STALE BREAD!!!  If you don't want to se it right away, it keeps wrapped in paper towels inside a plastic bag really well until you are ready.
