I thought this cake was awesome. The only problem I had was with the frosting. When I brought it to a boil (the butter, milk and cocoa) it turned gritty and separated so that it looked like an oily, gritty mess. I threw that batch out and tried again, only to have the same thing happen. The third time I tried it, I did not bring the mixture to a boil, I just melted everything down and got it smooth then added the powdered sugar and went on with the rest of the recipe. Other than that, it's a great cake. It was very moist with a nice flavor, it was neat to serve and even transporting it was easy as the frosting didn't stick to the saran wrap once it set. I will definately keep this recipe and use it again.

I've made this recipe for years, and it's by far, one of my favorites.  I use buttermilk in place of the milk.  Makes it even richer, and you have no idea that it's buttermilk when you eat it.  So don't worry if you don't like buttermilk.  Ya can't even tell!  I promise it's worth the change!

My Aunt Tinie, a lifelong Okie, passed away a couple years ago, and no one in the family has been able to give me her chocolate sheet cake recipe (though I  DID inherit her sewing machine). I remember well going down to visit her and Uncle Homer... She almost always made a cake like this. I remembered hers having a slight tinge of cinnamon, so I added about 3/4 of a teaspoon to the recipe. It tastes almost spot-on. It baked perfectly in my oven and is so rich and moist... I brought a piece to work with me this morning for breakfast! (Last night, while it was still warm, I served it up with a scoop of coffee flavored ice cream.) Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I couldn't be more pleased. Thanks for submitting this, Sister!

WOW   what an incredible recipe.  I thought I had messed it up somehow because it didn't rise, but it was the moistest, had the most wonderful flavor, everyone at work loved it and asks me to make it often.   Thank you so much Sister Pemberton

This cake is great. It's not super deep-dark chocolate in flavor, so if thats what you're looking for, this isn't the recipe for you. This is very moist, and almost creamy tasting. I halved it and used an 8x8x2 pan (baked for 25 minutes) and it came out perfect. I didn't have any issues with the icing, as other reviewers had, and I followed the recipe instructions to put the icing on while the cake is still really warm.This is actually better the next day (I think it gets even moister from sitting overnight with the frosting on top).

Couldn't find the recipe I've used for years for a texas sheet cake - I'm glad cause this is waaaay better than the one I had! Very moist (the sour cream?) and I thought a great texture. Used new dark chocolate cocoa and instant coffee crystals in hot water - easy, easy, easy. Took to a big pot luck; lot of chocolate things and this was the only one that disappeared, despite being the largest pan. Try it - you'll like it!

this was very good. The cake is very light, not an overpowering chocolate, so even with the fudge icing it is not too much chocolate. You do have to watch the icing though, I agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned removing from heat when it is smooth and not quite boiling. If you let it boil the texture becomes grainy. I added the pecans on top of the warm icing so I could leave half of the cake without nuts for those who prefer it that way.

SO good!  I make this in a 9x13 when I'm not feeding a crowd, I just bake a few minutes longer.  Texas Sheet Cake was always my favorite cake growing up, and this recipe makes an even better cake than I remember.  Thanks!

I think there's a very big palate difference between the states and Israel, for there is not other way to explain why this is rated 5 stars and I thought it was awful. The frosting is gritty and feels artificial, and the cake itself tastes like imitation chocolate cake. Will not make this again.

This was very good, and I received lots of compliments on it.  I was looking for a little more of the coffee/mocha taste, so I think next time I will use much STRONGER coffee (I used just plain brewed regular for drinking).  I didn't work fast enough with the frosting and it started to set up a little before I got it spread good (kinda tore up the cake a little too)... so next time I think I will stir in the conf sugar right on the stove top and use a hand held mixer in the pan (I used my stand mixer this time, probably got too cool).  I think I may add a little instant coffee to the frosting too?  maybe?  not sure...   Over all a good recipe!!  Thanks for sharing!

My cake turn out very good and moist.  This is one of the best cakes I've made and my kids loved it.  If your cake don't turn out moist you didn't follow the directions.  Keeper in my box.

Fantastic recipe!  I've made Texas Sheet Cake for years, but decided last night to try out this recipe - I'm throwing out my old one!  Everyone at the church dinner raved about this.  Thank you!

Wonderful!  

The only thing I was nervous about was, I had a 12x17 pan.  It worked fine.  My girlfriend had always talked about making a Texas Sheet Cake.  I looked up the recipe.  She asked me if I wanted her's, I declined the offer and made this recipe, instead.  

Wow.  That's the only word that comes to mind.

This is the same recipe I've used for years, except I use buttermilk in place of the milk and a pinch of salt in the frosting.  They help to cut the sweetness a bit.  

I also add 1 tsp of cinnamon along with the dry ingredients for the cake.

I slowly simmered both the frosting and cocoa/coffee till a gentle boil.  Then immediatly removed from the burner.  Both the cake and frosting were perfect and the best chocolate cake I've made to date.  The frosting is especially good as was the cake.  I halved this recipe, to sample it, but will double it next time!

Wow, this was good.  I used a pan slightly larger than 13 x 9 and it worked well.  One comment on the icing.  I had to add quite a bit more milk for the right consistency.  I put in the 6 Tbsp. and then ended up pouring more in from the container.  I would guess it was at least another 6 Tbsp.  I recommend just adding the milk in, stirring, until you get a nice spreadable consistency.  I left the pecans out until after I spread the icing over the cake.  Then just sprinkled pecans over half so my son who doesn't like nuts could enjoy it that way.  LOVED IT!!!

This cake has a couple of different ingredients than I remember.  The coffee adds a little something.  As the youngest of five kids, this was a frequent birthday cake and potluck cake.  It always went fast!  I make it now because it's so easy.  Highly recommend and will definitely make again!

This cake got rave reviews from our dinner group, one of whom is a native Texan.  The reviews that cautioned about boiling the frosting were on target; recommend incorporating the confectioners sugar and vanilla (and cinnamon--I used about 1/2 teaspoon) using an electric mixer as soon as the chocolate and butter are smooth and fully blended.  Pour the frosting on the cake while both are still hot.  Perfect!  
I used a 9x13 pan, so it had to bake for about 42 minutes.  Texture was perfect.
Thanks for sharing, Paula.  I'll make this again and again!

Easy to make and a big hit at the BBQ. Took the previous advice of not boiling the frosting, and it came out just fine. No other changes.

I loved this recipe! It was exactly the one I was searching for. A friend from a former job always made it and I never got the recipe from her. She did not want to give it out. So, I found this one and it sounded similar - all I had to go on was Texas Sheet Cake with coffee in the recipe. I loved it! It was a tad time consuming to make but worth it! Will make it again!

I made this recipe for a party and it was loved by all.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, and 1 tsp to the frosting.   It turned out perfectly, and tasted great - just like the rich and chocolately sheet cake I ate as a kid.   I did measure my pan before I started and I went through a few pans to find one with the correct measurements because in life size does matter....cake pans, wedding rings, etc......

Amazing cake, but listen to the review that tells you not to boil the frosting.  The first time I made this, I thought to myself, "Oh, I'm a good cook, that person must have done something wrong, I'm going to follow the recipe" and then I ended up with a nasty pot of ruined oily chunky frosting.  Heat and stir the frosting till everything just melts together and gets smooth, and then remove it from the heat and stir in the sugar.  It's delicious!

This is a delicious recipe and I love the frosting.  I baked this in a 9 x 13 inch pan and had to cook it about 20 minutes longer.  This cake is very moist and I love the fudgy frosting.  I added a dash of salt to the frosting and used about 3.5 cups of powdered sugar in all.

Hmm..I'm confused! The recipe is exactly the one I was looking for - the only difference being I do not use the nuts, I make my coffee *strong*, I do add 1 tsp of cinnamon to frosting and sometimes to the cake, and I poke holes in the cake with the end of a wooden spoon before pouring the frosting.

My friends frequently ask for this cake. They call it my "crack" cake because they say it is so addicting. Hazelnut or French Vanilla coffee work really well and give the cake a very nice flavor and the sour cream gives it a nice, moist texture.

This cake is absolutely good. I have made this several times, everyone loves it. The key word is MOIST. At first I thought it would be hard to make, but it was just the opposite.

This was the first "homemade" cake I've ever made. For me, the frosting was a tad bit tricky-but that was more my lack of stovetop frosting skills rather than the recipe. I scorched the frosting and had to make a second batch. Once I got the frosting down--the cake was absolutely fantastic! What a great recipe..Thanks so much for posting it! Makes the perfect cake to send into the office for birthdays!

This was a fabulous cake that I took to a 4th of July bbq.  It was incredibly simple.  Very moist and rich without being sickly sweet.  Two ladies stopped me at the door and asked me to bring 2 cakes next time!

This was my first time making a Texas sheet cake.  I used a jelly roll pan and it baked up beautifully.  I followed the direction about putting the frosting on while the cake was still warm- and it ran everywhere- the countertop, the floor.... next time I will wait until I can spread it on, when the cake is cooler.  But the taste was fabulous!  Thanks for posting this!

Cake baked beautifully in a half-sheet pan. Next time I would add to the frosting for a pan of this size; as written, it was a bit skimpy. Overall, the cake was great!

Texas sheet cake is a favorite at our house, so I make it a lot. This is the best recipe for it. I especially like that it's the perfect amount of frosting for the cake. If you find your frosting is too gritty, it's because you aren't beating it long enough. I usually start my frosting 5 minutes after the cake goes into the oven. Mine turns out great if I beat the frosting after adding one cup of powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of milk to the mixture. Keep adding and beating until it's really smooth. Great recipe!

I made this for Christmas dessert, following the recipe. I covered half with toasted pecans and left the other side nut free. It was a big hit. If you store in the refrigerator, be sure to serve at room temperature to achieve maximum flavor.

This is so easy to make! Like other posters, I had issues with my frosting clumping up when it was wild. I went ahead and used it anyway, once it got mixed in or beat in with the sugar, it was nice and smooth and perfect.

Let me start by saying I'm not the best baker. However, this cake came out perfect. One of the most moist cakes I've ever eaten, with a really wonderful flavor. I did take the tips from RAZMOM4 who suggested using buttermilk and a pinch of salt in the frosting. It was not gritty at all as some other reviewers mentioned having a problem with. I also halved it so it wouldn't overwhelm the cake and it turned out to be the perfect amount to be just enough to cover it in it's entirety. Have already saved it and can definitely see myself making this again whenever the need to bake comes up!

I haven't made a cake in years, much less one from scratch.  I accidentally used a 9X12 pan and the baking time increased for about 20 minutes.  This was incredibly easy to make a reminds me of my home state, even though I'm a proud Tennesseean.  Used almonds instead of the correct and traditional walnuts/pecan.

This recipe is good. I could taste the
coffee and did not feel it belonged.
I also tried the reviewer's suggestion of
cinnamon, maybe 1/2 tsp. would be better than 1 tsp.
Over all, people liked it.

This is a lovely cake, very moist and chocolatey. However, I made it in a slightly smaller tin and added 2 extra tablespoons of cocoa. I also took note of what other reviews said with regards to the frosting separating when boiled, so I just heated until melted and it came out fine, everyone who tried it loved it.This will be a regular cake for my family now. Thank you for the recipe. :-)

My daughter made this and it turned a little dry, I think it cooked just a little too long and the icing needed to be doubled as there wasn't enough but it was very good!  We think it might need a little more coffee in it too as we didn't taste that at all.

This was a great addition to our Thanksgiving Day spread!  I used a 9"x13" pan to make it a bit thicker.  I used dark cocoa powder and also added a teaspoon of esspresso powder to the frosting to make it even richer.  I will definitely make this again!

This was so fabulous, brought it to a coffee hour and everyone said they loved it. I read the reviews and the grainy frosting comes from the granulated sugar---you must read the instructions and ingredient list. The frosting turned out wonderful. I will be making this again and again. I would give it 10 stars if I could...thanks for the recipe

No changes although next time I would not bring the icing ingredients to a boil. . .heated through works fine.   Made it for a BBQ along with cherry hand pies and both desserts were enjoyed.  The cake is tasty, moist and very easy to pull together with pantry ingredients. . .and a leftover slice made a rare yummy breakfast for me!

Delicious!  Not too sweet, which makes it very popular for the ones that don’t have a super sweet tooth like I do.;)

This is the best recipe for a Texas sheet cake. Adding 1/2 t. of cinnamon really sets it off!

I noticed that some people said they found this frosting gritty. I've been making this for over 40 years. Here's the secret. Always sift your 10X sugar into the frosting. Tiny lumps can form if you don't. If you forget to sift the sugar, there is a work around if you have a hand-held mixer. Just put in the hand-held mixer and let it do it's work for a while. Depending on how lumpy your 10X sugar was, it might take a while, but it does work.

This is SO good!!! I used a cup of hot chocolate instead of coffee, and sprinkled some chocolate chips on top of the batter before cooking it. It was a HUGE hit! So moist!!

Could not believe how fast and easy this was. Mine cooked in about 15 minutes. My frosting did separate at first, i thought uh-oh this is really gross... but i got out my hand mixer and it was smooth in no time. Great, fast, feed a crowd recipe when my daughter brings the whole team home. Thanks for sharing!

This is the Best chocolate cake I've ever made! I followed the recipe directions, but added 3/4 tsp cinnamon as suggested in other comments. I also ran out of cocoa powder, so I substituted 2oz. of unsweetened bakers chocolate for the frosting and it turned out beautifully. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was a great cake to make for a crowd.  So delicious!  The sour cream adds  perfectly to this recipe.  The coffee is understated but brings out the chocolate wonderfully.  I used 'special dark' cocoa powder and walnuts instead of pecans (since I had lots of them in my pantry).  Great moist cake!

A great easy cake to make in a short time frame since you pour the frosting onto a hot cake. I use espresso powder in the cake and in the frosting and used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also top 2/3 of the unbaked cake with nuts, and then when I'm frosting, I do the same thing.  So 1/3 is classic Texas sheet cake, rich and gooey and the other 2/3 red is nutty all the way through.

Added 1 tsp cinnamon as suggested in reviews - liked that addition.

This recipe took a little more effort than usual one-bowl cake recipes due to heating Cocoa, etc for both cake and icing.  Result was rich and flavorful.

My 11-year-old daughter made this all by herself. Her first cake from scratch, for the Super Bowl, which was in Texas. It was the perfect Texas sheet cake I remember, a cross between cake and brownie. For the person who thought the frosting was gritty, did she not know what confectioner's sugar was? My daughter also made that mistake, but once she started over and used powdered sugar, it was delightful. But you must love chocolate!

Very good cake. I added two tablespoons of cocoa in the mixture for the cake because I'm a chocoholic and wanted to counter act the two cups of sugar.  It was perfect!  (Kept the measurement of cocoa in icing the same.). Keeper and looking forward to making it again!

Be sure not to over bake it.     Test after 20 minutes.  I used a 10 by15 pan.  It turned out great although I did bake it too long.     Don't add too much of sugar as it sets up pretty quickly.      Very good recipe

Just like my Mammy used to make for my birthday every year (except she would add mini marshmallows to the batter and they would cook on top of the cake and make a yummy moist top for the icing to go onto. I did not do that with this.)   This is heaven!!!   Absolutely the BEST.  Thank you so much for sharing.  It brought back wonderful memories of my sweet Mammy, and now I can make this for my family!

I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon but otherwise followed directions as noted on the recipe.  Easily one of the best chocolate sheet cakes ever!  Both husband and son raved about it.  It reminded me of my grandmother's and mother-in-law's old school delicious sheet cake!

I used to make this cake all the time when my boys were growing up. They are now 35&32. I made this for dessert for dinner tonight with my step daughter, SIL and identical twin grandsons. My darling hubby loves chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.... today is the 3rd anniversary of his Mom's passing, and she would make a cake similar to this for my hubby. And I'm make Ricotta Gnocchi with a quick marinara sauce for dinner that I recently saw on The Kitchen (Food Network 1/31 2015). BUT I LOVE THIS CAKE... My boys called "Texas Cake".
