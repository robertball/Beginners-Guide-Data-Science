If I could have, I would have given this ten stars on the quickness rating. Start to finish, this recipe takes no more than 15 minutes, and it's really easy and delicious. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the dressing, as it was quite sour. That really rounded it off well.

WOW!!! This was great and so easy to prepare.  I included a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil for a little more Asian flavor and doubled the fresh ginger, as I can never get enough.  An instant favorite!!!!  Thanks!

I'm rating this recipe even though I actually made so many changes that it's not really the same recipe at all. I made the dressing first.  I mixed the rice wine vinegar and the soy sauce and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  We're very calorie conscious, so instead of adding the oil to the dressing, I grilled some diced tofu in one tablespoon of sesame oil.  After the tofu was basically grilled, I added some diced onions and added the mushrooms (I used button mushrooms, which were good, but next time I'll try to use shitakes).  I grilled all of this together and then added the whole mixture to the dressing marinade and let the tofu and mushrooms soak up the flavor of the dressing.  I then boiled up the pasta and added some bell peppers at the very end of the boiling time.  After draining, I mixed the pasta in with the dressing mixture, and mixed it all up and let it sit for about 10 minutes for the flavors to absorb into the pasta.  MMMMMMMMM...it was so good!  So, as you can see, I didn't actually follow the recipe that much, but what I made turned out really good.

I used 1/2 Tbsp each sesame and chili oils instead of vegetable oil which gave the dressing some zing.  I just couldn't see boiling the cremini mushrooms, so I  sauteed the mushrooms and red pepper strips.  Also, garnished with sliced green onions instead of parsley (chopped peanuts would be yummy, too).  I do think that this needs more veggies (any kind that suits you) because 8-oz of capellini is a lot of pasta.  The warm pasta was like a sponge and soaked up ALL of the dressing.  The chilled leftover salad will need to have a little dressing added, otherwise, it's going to be too dry.  Good noodle salad, but I really can't say that there's anything to distinguish it from others that I've had.  And that's not to say that we didn't enjoy it.

Easy and my husband, who is on a low-fat, low-sugar diet said we could have it again.  I took the leftovers for lunch and it reheated nicely.  Added mushrooms & green onion

4 1/2 stars, if that was possible. An easy, attractive, and fairly tasty side dish or coupd be a vegetarian main course with the addition of more vegetables (I'm thinking snow peas, maybe a yellow pepper or yellow zucchini, and maybe some diced tofu). Might try sesame oil instead of vegetable oil next time. Thanks!

This recipe wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular. There wasn't much that was unique about it--I've had other Asian pasta dishes that were similar but better. It was very easy to prepare, though. I modified it somewhat: I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and I marinated the mushrooms and peppers in the dressing and had them raw instead of boiled. I also added some soaked arame to make it a little more interesting. I don't plan on keeping this one.

this is good recipe and I will cook again. I did not like the parsey in it. I added carrots and green onions. It is all on person preference. It is one you can play with. Overall, very good!

This is a wonderful recipe and very quick and easy to prepare. Shiitake mushrooms weren't available, so I used Cremini mushrooms as suggested. I made this for an event and received rave reviews. I will definitely make this again when I can get the Shiitake mushrooms.

Great recipe, except of course, made a few changes and additions.  I added diced chicken breasts, broccoli and peas, along with 1/4 c. of light brown sugar to the dressing.  I used thin spaghetti since I had it on hand.....Didn't even have to go to the store....had everything in the pantry and frig!  Thanks

I had everything on hand for a tasty noodle salad.  I am going to play with the sauce to give it some more flavor.  Very quick and easy.

This was pretty standard and low on the flavor side for us the first time we had it--I followed the recipe exactly using shitake mushrooms. The second time I used sesame seed oil, red pepper flakes, shredded baby green spinach, and  used low-sodium soy sauce in greater quantity and let everything  marinate for a couple of hours before adding to pasta, then let it marinate another hour.  Served with sliced grilled Spicy Asian chicken it was a good, but not great meal.

Loved this recipe. I did use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and didn't use as much.  I made it warm and was going to add a bit of sugar to the dressing as it is quite vinegary as other reviewers have said, but then I added the teriyaki chicken I made (also from this site) and the sweet added wonderfully to the sour! If I were to make it on its own, I would add a bit of honey or brown sugar to cut the sour.

I had a different kind of pasta - thicker Thai rice noodles.  They needed longer to cook than I gave them.  I also added matchstick carrots and cucumber, and sliced green onion. It was OK, but not anything like the dish I had and was trying to copy.  It was  far more flavorful. This was pretty and tasty, but not spectacular, and all the matchsticking took a while to do.

This was bitter and bland to me. I will add other veggies next time...broccoli would be great. I used it as a side dish to my spicy chicken and it turned out much better.

My husband said it was a keeper.  I made a few changes.  I added some fresh asparagus, cut into 1/2” pieces and some very small, peeled and deveined, shrimp.  Instead of adding the vegetables to the water, I sautéed them separately and then tossed them with the dressing and put over pasta.  Used the leftover as a side dish the next day.

I made a few changes.  Added 1 TBLS of brown sugar to the sauce and more ginger.  Thought it needed more veggies or less noodles.  I might make it again with more veggies and more spice.

It was great! The only change I made was to use fettuccine pasta because I couldn't fine capellini at the store. I already had the aforementioned pasta on hand.

Not super good, but could add things to make it better. I wanted it cold, so the noodles soaked up all the dressing sitting in the fridge, so made another round of dressing. Better.  Maybe add toasted almonds for crunch?  Bump up the ginger for sure.

Fast, flavorful and filling. The perfect thing for those times when you are too tired to make a big meal.  I had sesame oil in the pantry, so I used that instead of vegetable oil. I also added a little brown sugar to the dressing.  Garnished with green onions, it looked and tasted scrumptious.
