This recipe was surprisingly good.  I did make the following changes however:  used frozen catfish fillets instead of the Gordon's ones, omitted the tomatoes & olives, added chopped mushrooms.  I used this recipe as a way to get rid of some leftover groceries & my fiance went back for seconds!

I tried this with lemon pepper fish fillets and the lemon pepper was all i could taste.  I think it would be better with just plain fish fillets, but there wasnt much flavour to it.  Bf liked it though.
