Excellent recipe which we made on Thanksgiving and everyone loved! We made half of the batch with Dijon mustard and the other half with hot German mustard, which was also great!

Yum! Very distinct dijon flavor, so you'd better really like it. This would pair well with a muted chicken dish.

So easy and soooo good. The water chestnuts and walnuts really gave it some great texture. The dijon gives in an intersting spiciness that is just mouthwatering and makes you want more and more!

Excellent! except next time I would reduce the bread crumbs by 1/2 cup - 1 cup and add at least twice the amount of water chestnuts. I would also increase the walnuts, but of course that's personal taste. Also, since I dislike celery, I substituted with leeks, tasted great.

Probably the best stuffing we've ever had. We made it with extra cracked pepper and some cayenne since we like spicy stuff. Gonna make it again this week, and probably for Thanksgiving too.

This was great!  My husband normally hates bread stuffing/dressing recipes, but he loved this one.  I followed the recipe as written (except used slivered almonds in place of walnuts) and it turned out wonderfully.  The dijon adds a nice tangy flavor but is not overpowering.  Also, the addition of water chestnuts adds a nice crunch.  You will not be sorry for trying this recipe, it is wonderful!

Thanks for a great recipe!
