Great flavor profile!!! Loved this vegetarian dish and will use again.  I made a quick sauce with sour cream, cilantro and ground cumin.  I also serve this dish with some naan, which was a helpful way to eat all the beans.

The flavors in the chickpea sauce were outstanding! I combined a few steps for ease. The potato cakes definitely need some salt. which I will add next time. Rather than mixing the water and tomato paste separately, I just stirred them right into the chickpea mixture. Also, I this was a pretty dry sauce, and I wanted it to be a little "saucier", so it wouldn't just lie on the tomato patties in a lump. I added 2 t paste instead of 1, and eventually added about 1/2 cup of water, stirring it in gradually to get the consistency right. It was definitely spicy, so I cut back on the cayenne a bit so my son would eat it. It was full of delicious Indian flavors and I will be making this again! A great vegan dinner.

Loved this!  I love roasting the spices at first.  I also add a tap of mustard seed to infuse into the oil.  I reduce to half tsp of cayenne and I like a little gravy so doubled the tomatoe paste mixture and added half a cup of water.  I will make again for sure.

My boyfriend agreed his is definitely an authentic Indian recipe. I liked the tikki, but chole tasted just like spiced chickpeas to me, there was hardly any gravy. Also, who eats one tikki as a serving?! We ate two each. Too much time and effort for two servings, in my opinion; I wish I had doubled the recipe.

Loved it! So flavorful. Pretty easy once you get out all the ingredients. Even with 3/4 tsp cayenne, it was pretty spicy! Will definitely make again.

this was really good, but I made the following changes:
 
only used about 1/3 tsp of cayenne and one dried chili, and it was plenty hot enough for my husband and me - even with this lower heat level it was too hot for my kids.

doubled the tomato paste/water mixture and added a small can of tomato sauce. also added about 1/4 cup of water to the chickpea mixture - this gave it more of a gravy. I'm guessing the chickpeas would've been pretty dry without these changes

I just returned to a vegetarian lifestyle, and this was my first attempt at an Indian dish. It was delicious! Next time I will add a little more salt to the potato mixture but that is my only (tiny) tweak to this fantastic recipe.

SO good, easy and inexpensive to make.  Opted for an egg instead of the cornstarch for extra protein making this dish a wonderful, flavorful dinner.

Wow, this recipe did not disappoint. It was deliciously spicy and satisfying. I added some tang by drizzling the potato cakes with coriander chutney, and garnished with thinly sliced red onion and fresh coriander leaves. Sooo yummy.

Really liked this. It was easy to pull together, had dinner on the table within 40 mins. The potato cake is super spicy but you could reduce the amount of cayenne if you don't like hot. I also will add another tomato or two next time. And maybe add a side of green veg....
