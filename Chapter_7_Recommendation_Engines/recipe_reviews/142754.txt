Well, I love pine nuts, apples, spinach and garlic, so I knew I wasn't taking any chances trying this recipe.  I was right, it's fantastic!  A great combination of flavors.  The only thing I changed was the cooking method.  I cooked the pine nuts in the oil on medium-high heat until they started to brown, then turned the heat down to low and added the apples and garlic.  This insured that the pine nuts were toasted (which is important to enjoy their flavor fully) and the garlic didn't get too brown (which can make it bitter).

I think toasting pine nuts before adding olive oil would be better.  Also make sure to cook the apples on low or they become very mushy.  Very good with pork chops:)

Yummy.  Per other reviewers, I used a green apple, added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the saute and feta cheese at the end.  Very good!

This would be good to make as a simple yet impressive looking side dish.  I was surprised that the apples ang garlic went so well together.  I toasted the pine nuts to bring out the flavor, I think that helped a lot.  Pine nuts aren't my favorite, so I might experiment with other nuts next time...perhaps toasted almonds.

Added 8 oz sliced mushrroms, roasted brussels sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, sliced almonds (not pine nuts), and garlic. Make sure you use like a tsp of nutmeg, since there is spinach.

Very good & I love that it is a simple, tasty way to eat healthy foods.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wish I would have gone with my gut to toast the pine nuts first.  Oh well, next time!  Thank you for sharing!  :)

I toasted the pine nuts before adding the oil, like others recommended.  To prevent the apples from turning mushy, I cooked the garlic for a minute prior to adding the apples.  This is a very easy and tasty dish!

Not too amazing of a side dish, but it was decent. I'd recommend toasting the nuts before adding them to the pan, they don't really get a chance to brown too well with the other things. Thanks for sharing.

What a great combination of flavors, and a great way to eat some nutritional foods.  I found the salt and pepper to be necessary to bring out all of the other flavors.  I toasted the pine nuts, as recommended by other reviewers.  I will make this again.

Very simple and very tasty.  I would suggest toasting the pine nuts first on a higher temp and then lower heat.  I would also suggest a firm, crisp apple.

I made this the other night and my husband, Rick & I liked it. I didn’t have the pine nuts. The store I was at didn’t have them! I will use them the next time. I did add a bit more garlic than called for.
Thanks, it is always fun to try new recipes.

Wouldn't try it again. Used pecans instead of pine nuts. Was rather tasteless.

Made a very nice compliment with the AR recipe:  Maple Salmon.  Very light on flavor...but, we really liked the combination of this with the salmon.

Although this was a delicious combonation of ingredients, I have to agree with most other people, that the pine nuts should have been toasted first.  Regardless I ate every bite :)

Delicious. I added an apple because I love cooked fruit and I had too many green apples to get rid of. Forgot the garlic. Will make it more often.
