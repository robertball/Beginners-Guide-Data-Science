I have been looking for this type of streusel topping for quite a while.  My grand-mother used to make the best topping and this is as close as I am going to get.  She taught me how to make many recipes, but for some reason, the streusel was not one of them.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This is meant to be a lightly flavored crumb topping.  It is intended for use on various things where you may not want a strong, overpowering cinnamon flavor.  I don't necessarily want that on a blueberry muffin as I would a spice cake or coffee cake topping.  The "OR TO TASTE" means you can add more if you like or skip it altogether.  You can use powdered vanilla extract as well.  That's really good on a chocolate muffin! You can add more cinnamon for a streusel in a coffee cake. This is a recipe to make a large quantity so you have the ease of switching it up from recipe to recipe.  It saves time having it on hand and can customize to your recipes.

I used two TABLESPOONS of cinnamon.  I also added a teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg, allspice, and cloves. 

The only reason that it didn't get 5 stars was the white sugar.  All brown sugar would have been better, and I will make it that way next time.

My kitchen was very warm and I was afraid that if I froze it at that point it would be one solid lump. A couple of hours in the refrigerator for the butter to harden again let me use a pastry cutter to make it into proper crumbs. It's in the freezer now ready and waiting.

I've tried this on top of a yellow cake for the seniors on my job and it was great! It had just the right amount of sweetness.

I was a little overwhelmed by the quantity of this at first but froze it as suggested. It really has been a tasty, convenient, and versatile addition to many of my baked goods. Awesome!

So simple and delicious.  Jan, I love your recipes.  They are so easy to put together, have ingredients I usually always have on hand, and we've loved every recipe of yours that we have tried - personal and published.  I scaled this way back and used on a store bought coffee cake.  The topping was better than the cake!  I just made your personal recipe 'Jan's Maple Coffee Cake' and realized the topping is very similar, minus the white sugar, so I know it will be a hit.  I like the idea that you can make up a big batch of this and keep it handy in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing!

Such a fantastic crumb topping! I used it on small (pot pie size) cherry pies. Huge hit! Love the idea of keeping it in the freezer until needed.

love this recipe. I top all my muffins with it. I've even used it on apple pie instead of a top crust and it was excellent.

Perfect I used for the top of my peach/blueberry pie I omitted 1/2 c of flour and substituted 1/2 c of granola.

This is pretty good and fairly simple to whip up. I had to use gluten free flour, so I added some buckwheat flakes to give it some structure. I used a bit to top a fresh berry compote. I put the rest in the freezer. Thank you for the recipe.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I usually keep a bag of strusel in my freezer for those times when things need a special touch, but after making an international move this year, I lost track of my original.
This fit the bill.  If I change anything next time, I might take another baker’s suggestion and use all brown sugar.  That’s it, thanks for a terrific, much-needed recipe!

Delicious I topped three banana blueberry breads and still have left over for at least three more. I topped it a little too late in the process but that's what happens when you have a toddler and an infant but that's why it will be nice to have it in hand next time.

I like having topping on hand to just pull out. This kind of topping is preferred in my family to a top of pie crust. My only beef with this recipe is that the crumbs are too fine. I find a lumper topping looks more attractive than a fine, flat layer. I will not mix it as well next time.

We have two apple trees so I make a LOT of apple muffins, breads and pies.  I made a batch of this recipe and divided it into thirds.  One third I used on top of my apple pies as is, no changes.  Was perfect in place of a top crust.  I covered with foil half way through to stop over browning. Another third I added ground walnuts to and put over top of my apple quick bread.  I may have added too much of the nuts as it sunk in a little but still really good.  The last third I added more cinnamon and nutmeg (and a dash of cayenne for warmer spice) to top the muffins with. Will make another batch, divide again with my additions and freeze for the next bushel of apples.
