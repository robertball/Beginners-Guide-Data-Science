This was very good - didn't have the fresh ginger on hand, so substituted 1 tablespoon dried. Rhubarb mixture seemed a bit dry, so added 1/4 cup orange juice - it really added to the custard's flavor. Will def. make this again.

This is really good. I used two 8x8 pans instead and gave one to my sister. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

An outstanding recipe! The combination of rhubarb and fresh ginger was a hit at my church's picnic. I garnished with strips of fresh ginger, so it looked as good as it tasted.

Yumm! This recipe is so much more interesting that the plain old rhubarb crisp recipe. I added the 1/4 cup of OJ as another reviewer suggested-Good add in!

this is a fabulous recipe .. though i substituted grapefruit zest for the orange zest and it made this recipe "out of this world" .... next time i think i will decrease the sugar a wee bit ... found it just a little too sweet :-)

This recipe was so good! It took maybe 10 minutes to prepare and my husband said it was the best crisp he had ever had! Definitely a keeper.

I am making this for the second time today. It was such a hit last week.  I'm not changing a thing, except the number it serves.  I halved it the first time it barely served 6.  I served it with vanilla yogurt.  Delish!

This recipe is a keeper! I lost my favorite rhubarb recipe and needed a new one. This recipe is just as good as my lost favorite, if not better. I used slightly more than 1-1/2 lbs of rhubarb and cut it up without measuring to see if it was 8 cups.  I took someone's comment that it was too thin when baked in a 9" X 13" pan, so I used a deep dish 9" X 9" pan--it fit perfectly and wasn't too thin. I adjusted the topping, based on personal taste: I left out the flour, reduced the dark brown sugar to 1 cup and the butter to 1/4 cup. The topping worked out beautifully. Thanks, beetgreens, for a great recipe!

This was outstanding! I didn't have nearly enough rhubarb on hand so had to add pear and strawberries.  Another reviewer suggested grapefruit zest instead of orange. Coupled with the fresh ginger,  the rhubarb's tartness easily came through.  I  also cut the sugar in the topping by 25% and didn't miss it.  

This recipe comes highly recommended.

Didn't have any oranges so used lemon for zest. This was a wonderful recipe and disappeared very quickly. Definitely would make it again.

My family raved about this dessert!  The ginger really takes the center stage in this recipe, as it is the dominant flavor.  One person said that this is worthy of being sold at a 5 star restaurant among other gourmet desserts.  Even my husband who doesn't care for rhubarb loved this dessert!  It's worth the extra effort to grate the rhubarb and zest the orange when you get results like this!

Very good rhubarb crisp.  I made exactly as directed, but did add a sprinkling of cinnamon over the rhubarb custard layer, and used ground ginger rather than fresh. The only thing I'd do differently next time is decrease the amount of sugar - it's just a little too cloying sweet for my taste.

I gave it 4 stars but my husband would have given it 5. The filling is on the tart side for me but this is exactly how he likes his rhubarb. Otherwise a pretty good recipe. Ginger and orange zest add some interesting flavors. Will probably make this again.

This recipe turned out wonderful.  I liked the twist of ginger, so the second time I made it I added another tablespoon, which made it extra spicy. Yum.

Just finished making this and it is delicious. Very easy, quick and tasty. I always make it as the recipe states for the first time. Thinking I just might use an 8 x 8 pan next time as it is a bit thin. Ginger makes a wonderful change from plain rhubarb. Rates 5 stars in my opinion. Hubby went back for seconds!

Ginger and rhubarb was an unexpected but exciting pairing. I halved the recipe and still used almost a tablespoon of dried ginger. I also sprinkled in some cinnamon! The crisp was quickly devoured. I will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe as directed several times and it is always well received.  I was going to make it the other night but I was a little short of rhubarb so  I added an apple to the recipe .  It was still wonderful tasting.

Love this custardy bit of delish!  It was easy to make, however, I had to use ground ginger (I thought I had fresh-but nope!). I added some orange zest, just to use up an orange.  It was even better the next day...I brought it to work and had to share the recipe 3 times.  Thanks, beetgreens!  One of my favs!

I did add the review suggested 1/4 cup of orange juice. I used almond flour to make the recipe gluten free and I used 1/2 cup less brown sugar to reduce sweetness. Yes, I will make it again.

Love this!!!and I didn't even have the orange to put in it  the first time. I'm making it again today with ALL of the ingredients.
Changes: quinoa flour instead of regular flour. No one would have known if I hadn't said sthg. I also added ground flax to the topping and chia seeds to both the topping and rhubarb parts.

This was super tasty! Followed the recipe exactly, it took a bit longer to cook than expected. Definitely recommend some French vanilla ice cream to go with it. Also, do not leave out the orange zest, pretty sure that made this recipe so awesome! The only reason for four instead of five was prep and cook time.

Made this to share at a party and it got great reviews. Served it with a choice of vanilla bean ice cream or whipped topping (or both).  I will make this recipe again.

Loved the subtle ginger taste.  I did not have an orange so used a tablespoon of orange marmalade.
I really liked how the eggs made the rhubarb part a bit custardy and smooth tasting.  The topping is pretty sweet so next time I might cut back the brown sugar but isn't that what crisps are all about!

I left out the ginger, I don't like it, it's divine! Wish I had more rhubarb!

Delicious and much tastier as it cools.
I suggest using frozen butter cut in small cubes and mix the topping well in a large bowl before placing in a blender - probably best to use a pastry cutter to the ingredients and stir the rolled oats in last.

I made as the recipe directed, and love it. But the second time I may add the juice and see how that turns out.

Delicious! Served at a grad party and many people who have never had rhubarb tried it and loved it. I cut waaaaay back on the sugar though. Both in the filling and especially in the topping, two cups of brown sugar is ridiculous! Loved the fresh ginger in it though.

This is a great way to use rhubarb. Since it is taking over one of my raised beds, I figured I'd better try making something with it.  This dessert has a lot of flavor, and I took the advice of one reviewer and added a little orange juice, and I also added walnuts to the topping.  I cut the recipe in half since there are only three of us.  Next time I make it I will cut down on the amount of fresh ginger. It added a good flavor, but was slightly too strong for my taste.

We all loved it, not too sweet.  It could have had less topping or more rhubarb for a better balance of flavours.

I made this and we thought it was wonderful.  I did add the orange juice ¼ C. and the Brown Sugar I cut back to 1½ C. Plan to take this to a family pot luck.

This recipe is wonderful with or without the ginger!  I only had half the amount of Ruhbarb, but had already added all the ingredients for the base for the full amount.  I decided to still go with it and put it in a 8 x 8 with the ingredients for the top halved.  After 30 minutes, it was perfectly cooked and amazing!  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

It was quite sweet and I didn't taste much rhubarb. In the plus side I used plenty of it up!

Crowd favorite! The ginger definitely makes the difference. I got by with using some orange extract and a sprinkle more of flour/corn starch.
