Mmmmmmmmm.... give these carrots to someone who says they don’t like cooked carrots and it’ll change their mind for sure. The sauce is really good and I like to use it on other roasted veggies!

I switched the cider to freshly juiced Apple and used turnip instead of parsnips due to availability.  Everyone enjoyed them!

These made for some delicious, flavored veggies! The apple cider made them caramelized in the oven. First time I've liked parsnips.

sounds great and will make it as soon as the parsnips have had a frost to sweeten them.We never dig parsnips until a good frost.

I used rainbow carrots and skipped parsnips because that was what I had.  It was on the sweet side which worked well with our savory Thanksgiving meal and added great color to the plate.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed them even the three and six year old.

While this wasn't a complete standout, we liked it- including my five and three year-olds.   I think it will be a part of our regular rotation.  I followed the recipe with one minor change:  I had apple juice but not cider.  Maybe that was why the parsnips stayed the tiniest bit bitter.  Prep was super easy, and I roasted it right alongside a small chicken.

Excellent side dish. I made it exactly according to the recipe. The cider, mustard and honey blended to make a delicious sauce. It cooked perfectly in the time expected.

I would use less liquid next time. The veggies are more boiled with the extra liquid in the baking sheet.
