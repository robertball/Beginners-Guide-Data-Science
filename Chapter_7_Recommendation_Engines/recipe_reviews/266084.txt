7.20.17 So glad I tried this recipe because we really enjoyed it. You get just a little bit of sweetness from the mango and then the subtle fresh ginger kicks in. Very nice side dish that will go well with so many entrees. I might try substituting chicken stock for the water the next time. laughingmagpie thanks for sharing your recipe
