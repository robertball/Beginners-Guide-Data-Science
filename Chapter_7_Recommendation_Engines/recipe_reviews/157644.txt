The chicken was dry and while the flavor was initially tasty, it leaves a bitter-tangy aftertaste that I just didn't like.  The reduction is like a sweet marsala sauce.  The recipe would probably be better with a different wine.  Not likely to make again.

I substituted sherry for the muscat wine, and it turned out very well.  The only negative thing I can find to say at all is that I found my chicken got a little dry and tough from being in the pan so long after it was finished cooking, to give the sauce time to cook.  Still, my husband and I just had it for Valentine's dinner with some green beans amandine and roasted herbed potatoes, and it was delicious!  Thanks!

I didn't have any orange muscat but I did have Marsala, also a sweet wine, so I used that. I cut the chicken breasts into strips because they were quite large and I wanted to speed up the process. The dish turned out really well, my husband liked it so we will probably have it again.
