I'm and experienced baker, and made this cake for a chocolate-loving friend's birhtday, and he loved it. This cake is chocolatey, and not overly sweet. For anyone having trouble with this cake, here's what I did: 1. always grease and flour your baking pans, then place parchment paper in them, and grease and flour (use cocoa for a chocolate cake) the paper. My cakes never stick when I do this. 2. The butter to sugar ratio in this recipe is low, it just won't cream. This is no big deal, the cake will still turn out well. Just go ahead and add one egg and then begin creaming. 3. Beat the butter/sugar/egg mixture at least two minutes, then add another egg, beat two more minutes, add the third egg, beat at least two more minutes. 4. This recipe will fill 3 9-in. cake pans if each one is filled slightly less than halfway. This makes an impressive looking cake when ganache and frosting is spread between each layer. 5. To make the ganache, boil the cream over medium heat, then add the chocolate chips, lower the heat, and whisk briskly until smooth. 6. This recipe's buttercream frosting is good, but unnecessarily complicated. Just cream the butter, mix the cream, vanilla and chocolate together,alternately add it and the confectioner's sugar to the creamed butter, then the cream cheese. I found the frosting too thick, so I added 3 tbs. milk. I left out the egg yolk completely. 7. Cake assembly-pour the ganache in the center of each layer, then carefully spread it just to the edge.

As someone who has never baked with ganache before, it would have been helpful to know that I should have refrigerated or whipped it before trying to spread it on the cake.  It was a colossal disaster.  The worst baking experience I have ever had.  Ganache spilling everywhere.

WOW!! I had never made a cake from scratch but wanted to try. I was a little leary and VERY scared. I pretty much followed this recipe exact with the exception that I used semisweet choc chips for the ganache. This cake was VERY time consuming - im sure that might have something to do with my inexperience. I did refridgerate the ganache (overnight, actually since it became very late) In the morning I whipped it with a hand mixer and it was perfect. I didn't think the batter was too thin and it fit fine in 2 pans. I also did firmly pack the brown sugar as I think someone else had suggested. Ok so I twisted things a little by frosting the entire cake with the ganache and using the buttercream frosting to garnish on top and the bottom - I also shaved some chocolate for decor. (im going to see if I can figure out how to load a pic).. Here's the best part - I take this absolutely beautiful cake to work with me tonight and had it in a crystal disply case (I work in a restaurant) I added it as a dessert special and of course because of the beauty of it was ordered by the very first table of the night. I was mortified because even with its looks I was so afraid that with the first cut it would collapse or explode or worse, I was afraid it would taste disgusting all put together. HOLY MOLY, it was a hit!! We sold almost the whole cake and people went on about it being the best cake they ever had and how moist it was, etc. I was beaming and LOVED taking credit for it!! Thank U!!!

I usually don't trust recipes I find on the internet.  However, this recipe looked so good that I tried it out on a family gathering.  It was really great.  

An option that I really enjoyed was for the ganache:  I made it first, then let it set for about 3 hours while I made the rest of the cake, stirring it every once in a while.  The chocolate I used for it was the Ghiradelli's 60% Cacao chocolate chips (also comes in a bar form).  That chocolate is amazing and made the ganache to die for!!!!

Also it says to grease and flour the pans and that is a good idea.  I used pam and flour and that works amazing-perhaps better than butter or crisco.  

And do watch out for the changes in vanilla.  The cake says 1 1/5 tablespoons vanilla, yet in the directions it says 1 1/5 teaspoons...I opted for the teaspoons and it turned out great.

I had some fresh raspberries that I sprinkled on top and around the bottom of the cake.

This cake is amazing and will be a favorite of mine!!

Have NO idead what went wrong with this recipe - but my own experience with this one is pure disaster.  Prior to adding the boiling water to the batter, the batter looked terrific.  I added the 1 cup of boiling water to the batter, and the batter became very thin (as the recipe says it will become).  However, the recipe says it makes TWO 9 inch layers - but instead, it filled THREE 9 inch layers.  (Now here's the worst part...)  When baking in the oven, all three layers overflowed - badly - and the cake seemingly refused to bake(?).  The recipe says 35-40 minutes to bake, and, after an hour & 15 minutes, I finally just took the pans out of the oven.  The cakes were lopsided - and sunken in.  When taking the layers out of the pan, ALL cake layers stuck badly to the pans.  One of the layers came out like a DOUGHNUT(?!?) - about 3" diameter staying inside the pan!  This is for a birthday party, tomorrow night, so I iced the cake anyway - but this cake is, without doubt, one of the ugliest, lopsided cakes I've ever made - and I'm actually afraid to see what it tastes like.  Luckily, I have ice cream to go with it - so I'll most likely stop at the store & get stuff to make ice cream sundaes, just in case the first bite of cake tells me not to serve it to anyone else...  Very, very odd.

This cake is fantastic! It got rav reviews from friends and family alike. I have a friend who asks me if I made it again almost everytime I see her! Personal Preference - I make the ganache and the frosting FIRST. Then the cake. By the time the cake is cooled the ganache and frosting are perfect spreading consistencies. And sometimes I use semi-sweet chocolate for the ganache - it depends what is in the cupboard. It's the perfect chocolate cake!

Great cake! Made this for a dinner for 5 birthday celebrants, & they all loved it ~ couldn't stop talking about it! The waiter &  the table next to us also tried it & raved about it. Now I did do something unusual to personalize it for the celebrants who were all from New Mexico, a state that loves its chiles so much that chiles are the official State Vegetable! I added NM hot green chile jam to the cake batter (1/3 cup jam per 9" layer) & NM red chile powder to the ganache. A total & memorable success! The addition of jam to the cake batter of course affected the texture, but it was still terrific: moist & rather dense. I will make it again without those changes & update my review later.  ~~ I chose another frosting (butter cream which I also spiked with red chile powder) - because I did not want the raw yolk of this recipe's frosting. ~~ The bottom layer was frosted, chilled in fridge to firm, then the thick fluid of ganache was poured & spread over that. For a very easy decorating method, I put some ganache into a squirt bottle. Alternatively, liquid ganache can be poured over each layer. Note: for easy & perfect removal from pans, line pan bottom with wax paper trimmed to fit it. Grease it & the sides,  then dust it all with a mixture of flour & cocoa powder. Adding cocoa powder prevents the appearance of a film of white flour contrasting against the dark chocolate ~ an old baker's trick. Allow pans to cool on racks for 10 mins. before turning out.

This is a great recipe....but a little advice on the ganache and buttercream. The professional trick to a ganache cake is to ice it in buttercream first, then chill for about an hour. Make the ganache and pour it over the whole cake. You will get a very smooth effect that looks awesome. With as much ganache as this recipe makes, you could do two pours, resting about 5 minutes between each, and get a really good coating.

This is an excellent Chocolate cake to make. The cake part is so moist and almost brownie like that you could eat it just like that with no frosting at all. I ended up adding some sugar to the ganache filling cause I thought it was a tad too bitter for me. I also used Parchment paper to line my pans and they almost fell out it was so easy to remove from the pans. The frosting is a little thick and heavy and was kinda hard to spread over the Ganache filling. All in all I would make this again. I am having a dinner party tonight and will let you know what others think about it...This is a very very chocolate cake with a nice frosting.

TO DIE FOR!  That's all I have to say about this cake.  I made it for a BBQ for my family and EVERYONE loved it.  3 people requested where I got the recipe from.  It is an involved recipe, but it's not difficult and most ingredients are in your pantry.  I love to bake so doing all the steps was fun for me.  I mixed part unsweetened chocolate and semi-sweet and it was delicious.  I have never added boiling water to a cake mix and was a little alarmed when it was bubbly, but it was totally fine.  I would maybe suggest using wax paper on the bottom of the pan to help with removal from the pans.  That was my only slight mishap.  Awesome cake!  THANKS for SHARING your concoction!

This was OK. Just watch the amount of vanilla listed in the ingredients versus what it says in the recipe itself.

This cake is a big project, that's for sure; however, it's worth it. I gave it 4 stars only because I felt the cake part was a bit too dry. When I make this next time, I will add 1/4 c of oil to the cake part. I used parchment paper to make the cake come out of the pan more easily and it worked like a charm.

WOW!!! So much better than a mix and canned icing. The chocolate flavor is to die for. Sweet, but not too sweet. Very rich! This recipe easily makes TWICE the icing that you need for a two layer cake. Next time I plan to make four layers, but I think that it's still too much. Leave our the egg yolk, and don't bother beating the butter for 10 minutes. The icing recipe is unneccesarily difficult. You can really dump everything together and mix it that way.  Either way, very very very yummy. I made it for my husband for valentines day, but i can't WAIT to make it for company next time!!  Had to come back and add - even BETTER the second time!!! And try adding a cup of hot coffee to the mix instead of water. It enhances the chocolate flavor.  I did four layers instead of two - it makes for a HUGE cake. Ganache between each layer. Added shaved white chocolate to the top. The birthday girl RAVED and now everyone wants me to make this cake for their birthday!

I made this cake for a coworkers birthday party. He suggested that I make a simple box cake, but where's the fun in that? After everyone had tried it they said it was the best chocolate cake they had ever had! I doubled the recipe and made a 4 layer cake. The first batch I added regular water instead of boiling because the ingredients didn't specify temperature. It turned out fine, maybe a little denser. And there is a flaw with the vanilla; the ingredients say 1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla and the directions say 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons and it turned out great. Thanks for this recipe!

I think that this recipe made a restaurant quality cake!  I loved the ganache in the middle. Yum! Be advised that this cake takes a long time to put together, and makes a HUGE cake!  I served it to 11 chocolate lovers, and we still had half of a cake left!  Next time I will half the recipe, and then split the one layer horizontally, to make a smaller, rich cake.

Great...I made this cake for father's day..what a hit. I did have trouble getting it out of the pan, but it was nothing the frosting couldn't hide. I also did a few variations:  I put a litte coffee liquor into my ganache and i whipped it so it'd be spreadable..I then covered the whole cake with it and let it set before putting on the delicious frosting...I will make this again.

I made this cake for my husband for valentines day this year.  It is an excellent tasting cake...we really liked the cream cheese buttercream frosting and it absolutely cures that after dinner chocolate craving.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it was VERY time consuming.  The steps and ingredients were very basic, it just took a long time to prepare.  I would suggest making only half of the ganache this recipe calls for and it will be plenty.  Overall a very good recipe - definitely something to make for a special occasion.

This cake recipe was FANTASTIC!!!! I had no problems with the actual cake itself. The ganache went well. I made sure to chill it after spreading the ganache over the first layer, and the buttercream spread well on top. I think next time I will try to have more ganache between the two layers. But it was delicious! I added a garnish of sweetened whipped cream on top of each piece to counteract the bitterness of the ganache. It was delicious, and everyone raved about it! I will definitely be making this again!

I was asked to make a dark chocolate cake for a friends birthday party last weekend. Although I am an above average cook I hate to bake. Since I couldn't say no I came looking for a recipe. This one was PERFECT!! I used 71% chocolate in the cake. Made a ghiradelli semi sweet mousse for the center and covered it in 1/2 dark, 1/2 semi sweet ganache.
We served it with vanilla ice cream with hazelnut espresso vodka drizzled over both. I have never gotten so many compliments on anything. The presentation was stunning and the taste amazing.
 The cake did fit perfectly in 2 - 9 in. pans. It did look spongy still when I took it out but I took it out at the correct time anyway to avoid dryness. The tops of both cakes did sink in slightly but had no effect on the decoration of the cake. This will probably be the only chocolate cake I will ever make. At least when I am looking for a dark chocolate cake.
 I did not make the frosting so I cannot evaluate that

The perfect special occasion chocolate cake.  I thought the frosting was a little too thin, so I added 3 more cups confectioner's sugar.  Also, I didn't have cream, so I used 2% milk every time it was called for.  It turned out even better than when I used cream the second time I made it!  The normal milk made the ganache runny, so it soaked into the cake layer then hardened overnight.  Crazy delicious!  And, this cake weighs 10 lbs at least.  Enough to feed 12 for sure.

This cake is outrageously delicious!!! It was a big hit at our office birthday party. Everyone loved it! Please note that it made 3 9-inch layers, not two. I also added about 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar to the ganache to thicken and sweeten just a little. The cake was moist and dark-the perfect chocolate cake. I didn't use the frosting recipe because the raw egg yolk sounded gross but the chocolate cream cheese frosting on another recipe on this site was a great substitute. Thanks!

This has got to be one of the best cakes I have ever made.  I am not a baker; I cook a great deal more than I bake, but I did not have any real trouble with the recipe.

I even cheated on melting the chocolate and used the microwave.  If you don't have a double boiler, simply put about 2/3 of the chocolate in a microwavable bowl and set in the microwave for about 45 seconds or until it is just melted.  Then simply add the rest of the chocolate and stir until it is smooth.  Works just as well as the double boiler but much faster and for me much easier.  

Anyway, my boyfriend's 12-year-old couldn't stop sneaking bites of the cake, and he's a terribly picky eater.  Once you factor in the cooling time for the cake and the actual decoration (I'm terrible at it) it did take me about two hours.  Also the ganache between the layers took a bit longer to set, closer to 30 min, but just be patient, it will firm up!!  Don't ice too early, though, you'll squish the ganache everywhere and have a chocolatey mess.

Not for the impatient or amateur baker, but if you have the time and ability, this cake is FANTASTIC.

I don't know why anyone had a problem with this cake! I made this cake for the second year in a row for my fiance's birthday, and it came out perfectly.  It fit 2 9 inch cake pans as stated, not sure how people had trouble with it overflowing and whatnot.  In fact, it fit PERFECTLY into the pans.  The ganache takes a bit to set, so plan accordingly, but still, this is a perfect recipe.  Do NOT refrigerate the icing or you won't be able to spread it...unless you nuke it very briefly or add a tiny bit of hot water.  The cake itself is not super chocolate-y, but if it was, the flavor of the ganache and icing mixed with it would overpower the cake.  This is a great cake, and I must say...if you don't have a clue in the kitchen, stay away from this one!  I have no idea what you're doing wrong, but don't blame the recipe!

This cake was excellent! Only thing I will change next time is to make the ganache before the frosting and let it set in the refridgerator to "set up" a little better before putting on the cake.

4 stars overall, but 10 stars for the icing! YUM. The ganache was too bitter, and the cake did not save well in the fridge overnight. I would only make this again the same day as eating.

This recipe is just perfect! Although the cake part isn't very sweet, the frosting IS. Together they're a perfect match.
I made this once for my classmates at school and they've been begging me to make it ever since (I've probably made it at least 10 times). However i prefer making it in cupcake form which means that it only has to bake for about 10-15 mins instead of what the recipe calls for. This recipe is REALLY worth making.

This was a fabulous cake!  I would call it a 'mud cake'. Very dense rich and amazing!!!!! yum, I got rave reviews about this.  I made it chocolate/orange flavored for my husbands birthday party.  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I had to use the substitute recommended on AR (cocoa and oil).  It turned out great, but I would love to try it with the actual chocolate.  Oh, and I used mostly natural yogurt instead of sour cream.  Beautiful, thanks so much ElizabethBH!!

Excellent!  Definitely takes a little experience if you've not baked much. I followed the advice of some other posters to ensure success. I almost forgot to add the boiling water which would have been tragic!  I had no problems with the batter.  I did have  to cut the "hump" off of the top of my bottom layer.  Definitely need to let the ganache harden a little for easier use. Seemed to make a ton of ganache, and I had to discard the rest. The buttercream frosting is to die for! I had to add additional cream though because my mixer couldn't handle the thickness. Also, for the middle, put the buttercream frosting on first, then the ganache, because the buttercream won't spread over ganache. I also used piping to decorate. I had to keep adding cream to the frosting for piping consistency.  I also have so much buttercream frosting left- not sure where the original baker used it all.  Takes about 3 hours to make, but well worth the time.  Sinfully delicious!!

I've been making this cake for a while now, it is always the request of my friends for their birthdays. Very rich, very chocolately. It is almost required to eat it with vanilla ice cream. I serve it chilled as well to keep it fudgy.

This was a very good tasting cake, I have made it several times and even won 3rd place in a local cook-off with it.  It is however, time consuming to make and does require refrigeration which I found to slightly dry the cake out.

GREAT cake recipe.  I used a Godiva Chocolate buttercream recipe for the icing instead of the one listed (1 C butter, 2 C powdered sugar, 1/3 C Godiva Liquor) as I was hesistant about the egg in this icing recipe.
The cake and ganach were one of the best combinations ever!  The cake was moist and rich.

I've never given a review before, but this came out so wonderful I just had to let you know. I took it to our Wed. night meeting at church for a birthday.  
    I got raves from everyone, except 2 of our 13, who don't care for chocolate.
   I pretty much went exactly by the recipie, but took advice from one review and instead of hot water added a cup of strong hot coffee. Also I didn't have enough bittersweet chocolate, so I used 1 C of milk chocolate for the ganache, but it was perfect. I  don't usually make layered cakes, sooo.. I put the top layer the wrong side up, but not to worry, I pretty much covered that up w/frosting. I used one container of rasberries, and I definitely recommend that. I put them around the bottom and on top. I also took another recommendation an prepared some sweetened whipped cream. Most of us tried that but felt it didn't add anything, rather it distracted from the cake taste. I still have a little left in a Tupperware cake taker in the fridge, had no trouble with it drying out. 
   Elizabethbh, thank you so much. I wish I'd taken a picture but I wasn't expecting it to be that good. Now it DID take longer than 1 hour, but I think I could do a lot better than that with practice. Also now allowance must be considered for cooling of things.

We really liked this cake.  The only changes I made was to sub the sour cream with soy cream cheese and coffee for the water.  I used 3 -8 inch pans and it was just right.  I frosted with a different recipe.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This cake is moist, chocolaty and has a gorgeous dark colour!   It will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on.  Made it as written and it was perfect :)  Didn't even notice that it had fat-free sour cream in it as it was all I had.

This cake is amazing! The sour cream adds such a moistness to the cake - it turned out perfectly - I didn't have to add any time or change anything. As another person mentioned, I would recommend making the icing and Ganache before making the cake. This allows the Ganache to cool to a thicker consistency and makes it VERY easy to work with! I will be using this recipe again and again - the icing is incredible! It tastes and looks like something out of a fancy bakery! 2 thumbs up!

this is the most fantastic cake ever!! I actually made it twice once i took to a friend as a trial and they fought over the last piece then i took one to work and there was also nothing left over.  I do agree that this is a very time consuming cake to make but if you follow the instructions it comes out perfect.  I defiently will make this cake again

I'm a chocolate lover but I found this to be a bit overwhelming and too rich.  My guests raved about it, but I can't be sure that they weren't being polite.

This cake is outstanding. It is fun to make, and tastes like heaven. It is a very gourmet dessert, but worth the extra effort. I gave this recipe to a friend of mine a couple of years ago, and since then, people have actually paid her to make this cake for them. It's great to find such an amazing recipe - and even better to share!

I used just the cake recipe for a raspberry chocolate cake I made the other day and this cake is just amazing. It's so moist and perfectly fudgey, this is definitely going to be my chocolate cake recipe for any occasion.

This recipe confused me.
1) 2 1/2 C br suger to 1/2 C butter?  When I creamed it in the Kitchen Aide, it just clumped up.  I added an additional 1/2 C butter.  Too much sugar or not enough butter? 

2) I mixed the melted chocolate (I used melted semi-sweet chocolate chips) with the water and sour cream - I could not see any purpose is not doing so before adding to the batter.

3) This made a 3 layer cake that fell in the center.

4) The batter was not as thin as the receipe indicated it would be.

I made this cake because of all the wonderful reviews.  But no one mentioned the sugar/butter issue or the volumn of batter. Just me, or a problem with the receipe?

Excellent. I made this in a sheet pan, poured the ganache on top and when that had set I iced the cake with chocolate cream cheese icing using the recipe found with the chocolate italian cream cake found on this website.

This was a big hit!  I followed the recipe exactly as the instructions state and it turned out great.  Note: I am also at a higher altitude.  I used spring pans, greased and floured, and I did not have any issues with the cake sticking.  I cooked three 9" round pans for 35 minutes, but I probably could have pulled them out at about 30 minutes for a more moist cake.

The cake did turn out and the ganache was good. I omitted the frosting. I think the cake might taste good if I didn't add the cup of hot water.  It tastes diluted. I would prefer a rich basic cake. Also add a teaspoon of glucose to your ganache for a glossy wet smooth look.

This is a wonderful chocolate cake! I made this cake for a special meal I was making for a friend. She loved it! I made it the next week for my family. They really enjoyed it. I made it a third time a week later for my grandmother's birthday. It was once again a hit. My one tip is to be aware that the package of bittersweet chocolate chips no longer come in 12 ounce packages, so they are no longer 2 cups of chips. This is even better the second day if it lasts that long.

This is both my hubby and my favourite cake. My only change is 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of tablespoons in the icing and no egg yolk, I add a tablespoon and a bit of cream to make up for the liquid loss. Also, I don't know if my oven is running hot but but I only bake it in two pans and cook it for 28 minutes. Have used semi-sweet chocolate on occasion also.

I have made this cake a few times now and it normally doesn't last long before it's completely gone. Some of the changes I made is using milk chocolate for the ganache and small amount of almond extract with the butter cream frosting. Defiantly let cool while assembling and enjoy.

I made this cake a while back and I will say it's probably the best chocolate cake I  had. For an inexperienced bake with very little and cheep equipment it was a major hassle but worth all 6 hours. This time around I'm marketing two of them. One for my wife and one for the lady who gave me her $600 kitchen aid mixer.  I've had a little more exp. with baking and I invested in some decent tools so I was able to make both in a little over the specified time.  I did use half semi sweet and half bittersweet chocolate for the ganache. Bottom line it my go to cake for when I want to impress people and if u make it twice it's easy to make after. It will cost about 20 bux for all the stuff.

Worth EVERY CALORIE.  A delicious, moist, deeply chocolate cake... the kind one craves with a glass (or several glasses) of milk.  Tip:  One of those big 1lb (?) chocolate bars from Trader Joe's--the darkest one, is just enough chocolate for this cake.  And it's just $5 bucks; amazing deal for Belgian chocolate.  It is 72% cacao if I recall and has just a touch of sweetness, so I adjusted the sugar in the recipe down just a bit--like 1/2 cup.  Anyway, THANK YOU ELIZABETH, for your extremely good Extreme Chocolate Lover's Cake!

Great flavor and I did not use the kind of chocolate called for in the recipe, I used dark chocolate I had on hand.  Very rich cake that baked up better than I thought considering the batter consistency.

Made this today for a birthday. It was all good and then i went to bake it. Nothing went TOO wrong but the center of the cake wasn't completely done and I left it in for 15+ more minutes. I didn't want the edges, which had baked perfectly, to burn so I shut off my oven and let it sit in there for a little while longer till it was mostly done. Still, the center is a little under-done. Whatever, that's fine. I did add in some cocoa powder because I thought it was weird none was used. Then, for the frosting, it came out PERFECT. I reduced sugar to 3 C. because 4 c. seemed like too much. I used chocolate chips and 3 TBS of cocoa powder + a little bit of water (eyeballed it, as needed) and stuck it in the microwave for 1 1/2 mins. Didn't make the ganache, I can live without it ;) Overall, really good recipe, probably will use again, at least the frosting recipe!

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had! I've made it 3 times and the first time it was perfect. One layer has fallen the last 2 times, but I just filled in the hole with ganache and everyone loved it. I made it for a group of 8 last night and we only ate 1/3 because it's so rich. However, we're meeting again tonight and dessert is already made! The proportions of cake to ganache to frosting are perfect for those of us who like lots of frosting.

loved this recipe!!! My husband is a serious chocolate LOVER so this sounded just perfect for me to make for his birthday cake this year. It turned out amazing, it was moist and just delicious. One thing i did is i dug into the cake a little to make a small bowl shape that i poured my ganache into and chilled it made it perfect. I recomend this to all my friends when they ask for a good cake recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out wonderfully. My only addition was that I garnished it was chocolate shavings on the top and raspberries around the bottom (also helps hide flaws). It was extremely time consuming but well worth it and everyone commented how professional it looked. I made the buttercream frosting the night before and took it out of the fridge a few hours before the cake was done to let it get back to room temperature and re-whipped it in the mixer to soften it a bit. Like others suggested I made the ganache before the cake and put it in the fridge for a bit once it cooled. The cake itself was not very sweet so it was complemented very well but the rich, chocolatelyness of the ganache and buttercream frosting. I will definitely make this again for special occasions.

This is soooo good. It reminds me of the double chocolate cake at buca di beppo. The only changes that I would make would be to not use the frosting and just go with the ganache and maybe add some fresh strawberries. The cake and the ganche are so good on their own and the frosting is delicious also but when added to the cake and ganche it is too much fat and sugar for me.  I used gheridelli bittersweet chocolate for the ganache and omg, it was heavenly.

Easy to follow recipe. Had no problem with any part of it. The icing was much better than others I've tried to make. Everyone loved this cake. My only change was to put fresh raspberries (two small cartons) in with the ganache. The raspberries cut the richness of the chocolate and add another level of flavor. I'd never done ganache before and used this website to understand it better.

I made this cake for my sweetie on Valentines Day and it is by far the Best cake I have ever made from scratch!  If you want to save some time making it with out sacrificing quality I recommend Nestle Choco Bake - Pre-melted unsweetened Chocolate.  You just knead the 1 oz packages and they turn to the exact consistency you need for this recipe.

I'm not a baker and I had no problem making this cake! First I did not need 3 cake pans but I think it would have been better with the amount of ganache it makes, also I did not put frosting over the ganache so it also makes alot(it did need a little extra milk it was too thick to spred). The cake is so good and moist, I used light sour cream and a mix of unsweetened & semi-sweet chocolate since that is what I had on hand! It is so awesome!

Awesome cake.  It took longer than anticipated but well worth it.  I dipped strawberries in granache and covered top of cake. Sent it over the top for chocolate lovers luncheon.  Definately will make again next time will use the suggestion of hot coffee maybe even an espresso.

The cake does come out a little dry, but I noticed that the ganache on the bottom layer sealed the cake and kept it moist. I couldn't taste it on the cake, however my mom says she did the 2nd day. She loves ganache and would have been happy w/just ganache and not the butter cream icing - which I loved. 

There is too much icing over all, but next time I think I'll slice each cake in 1/2 so that I have 4 layers to ice. 

It's a lot of work but it's worth it. I made it for mother's day/my mom's birthday and she loved it! Give it try!

I'm a pretty good cook, but kind of a hit or miss baker, so I was a bit scared after reading some reviews. This was my first time making a cake and frosting from scratch but the cake came out perfect. I'm usually not one for chocolate cake or frosting  but I do LOVE rich, dark chocolates and this cake totally satisfied my chocolate tooth. It was decadent! I used mostly 70% cocoa for all the chocolate, and made the frosting and ganache first. I did have to reheat the ganache a little bit to get it to spread but then let it chill before adding the frosting. The cake alone is absolutely delicious even without the toppings, I will definitely make it again!

I was a little nervous to try this recipe because of what people said about it being too watery. As I was making it, I realized the recipe didn't say "packed" for the brown sugar amount. That could be the problem for those with a too watery recipe. My batter seemed a little thin, but not excessive, and it's in the oven now, cooking up nicely. We'll eat it tonight and I'll let you know!

It is chocolatey but wasn't as moist as I think it should be. I also like the previous reviewer was unable to cream the butter with the sugar, it seemed like the butter was not enough?

This recipe was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!! Although I did not make the frosting recipe because I ran out of chocolate, It tasted just as well with the store bought icing I thankfully had stored on my shelves. I can not imagine a bad review on this recipe, It turns out perfectly. I debated over even putting the frosting on the cake because it was so rich and moist. Tasted like a browne, even better! I recommend this to chocolate lovers!

The only thing that I changed in this recipe was the type of chocolate used - I used a mix of bittersweet and dark in the cake and frosting and used milk chocolate for the ganache.  The cake was absolutely delicious though next time I think that I would use the milk chocolate ganache as the allover frosting as well.

it was a nice cake BUT the cake came out a little dry and the frosting was too thick to put through an icing bag so had to spread it on the cake rather then make a nice pattern. also the cake had to stay in the fridge constantly otherwise the frosting and the ganache kept melting it was a tad irritating

I love the recipe but added half a cup of bitter chocolate powder as I wanted just a little more chocolate "umph". AWESOME RESULTS!  Another thing I like about this recipe is that you can divide it and the time has already been calculated. Each portion rises just right for a layer and saves you having to cut it to add the filling. It's moist and fluffy. Wonderful cake!

This cake was great but it didn’t cook like a normal cake.  It was super soft when it came out of the oven and wasn’t firm enough to frost until it was chilled completely.  I cooked it in a cheesecake tin, which helped with the sticking problem others mentioned but make sure you grease and flour or you’ll never get it out of the pan.  Makes two large cheesecake tins (taller than standard pan) but needed to cook longer if only making two pans or three medium sized tins of cake.  Sets up nicely but you need to be patient.  It is super rich and fudge like once cooled.  I made the frosting and ganache once the cakes had fully been refrigerated and it was much easier to frost that way.  It’s kind of a pain but worth it if you love very rich, dense chocolate cake.

I made this cake. I used cocoa instead of the 6 ounces of unsweetened chocolate. The cake was moist. The ganache was not the right consistency. I used another chocolate cream cheese frosting. I would recommend the cake. I made chocolate curls to the cake.

I only use the cake recipe so my review is for the cake.   My family and neighbors love it and I am requested to make this all the time.  For extra chocolate I hand sprinkle chips or chunk of chocolate right before baking.  Hands down FAVE!!!

This cake is not particularly hard to make, but I did find a few things that I will do differently if/when I make it again.

1) I will make the cake first and let it cool for about 2 hours. 
2) I will refrigerate the icing before using it.
3) I will make at least 3 layers.

I found the icing was particularly sensitive to temperature.  Not just the temperature of the cake, but the temperature in the room.  Living in the south, even the ambient temp and humidity indoors can be tricky for icing.   Also, I think it will need to be stored in the refrigerator to avoid melting  the icing. 

All that said, the cake was tasty and dense.  My husband (the chocolate lover) loved it.

I made this cake, (different frosting though).  It was fabulous.  I made it as a trial run cake in preparation for a friends birthday.  It was definitely a hit.  In fact, another friend had some for breakfast.  Breakfast of champions I guess.  I made it with a fudgy frosting.

This is really hard to make, but it's well worth the effort!  My boyfriend and I use this recipe to make cupcakes (that go well with vanilla cream cheese frosting and a blackberry on top!).  It yields about 30 cupcakes :-)

It turned out quite well! The quantity of the ganache was a bit much for the actual cake, but overall, it was a great recipe.

Very; very rich and decadent.  Not for the faint of heart.  But if you are looking for an ultimate chocolate experience this is the cake for you.

I can not honestly rate the whole recipe, because I only made the Frosting so far.  So this review is only on the frosting part.  It is amazing!  The best chocolate frosting by far!  It was so rich and full of flavor!  It was a little thinner consistency once done mixing, not too thin, just thinner than a consistency to pipe with.  Once put in the fridge for about an hour  while my cake was cooling, it really thickened up and made a very thick pipe-able frosting.  Love it!  It complimented the cake I made so well with it!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Love this cake. I've been making it for years on special occasions. It does take a long time. I follow the directions exactly, but usually only need to bake it for 30 minutes. Also, I assemble it a little different. I cut the two cakes in half and make 4 layers, alternating the frosting and ganache between layers rather than putting them together. Then, I use the frosting around the sides, pour the ganache on top and let it run over the edges, and put some chocolate shavings on. Worth the time, rich but not overly sweet. Awesome, and always a hit.

I loved this cake! To be fair, I am only rating on the cake, as I use a buttercream frosting which is nothing like this one, and I build the cake differently. The cake comes out moist and although the cakes rise in the center far more than a usual recipe, that leaves extra trimmings to be snacked while compiling the cake! I also add a little semi sweet in lieu of some of the unsweet chocolate, usually 2oz. As one of the other reviews noted, due to the excessive rise in these, I make 3 pans (not two) in either 8" or 9" size and then have 3 tiers to the cake. As a decadence, I also add a raspberry compote to the middle and on the top of the cake (2 pints fresh raspberries, 2T lemon juice, 1/2 c sugar, 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch; in sm saucepan over low heat, stir occasionally until berries fall apart and sauce thickens, about 30 mins). 

Those having trouble with building the cake - the trick is to freeze your creation between EVERY STEP when adding layers of ganache, frosting, compote, etc. for at least five minutes each time. I never cool ganache or buttercream beyond room temp, it becomes too hard to handle. If the kitchen is too hot to work the layers, take them to a cooler room to assemble!

I also use leaves from bushes outside to make chocolate decorations on the top of the cake (3 oz semi sweet + 1/2 c shortening in dbl boiler; paint several layers on back of stiff leaves, 10 mins between each layer to cool; peel leaves off before using decoration). The heat from your fingers

A+. I added only 3ozs unsw choc and was fine. I didn't cream anything, just stirred until incorporated. Turned out like cakey fudgy brownies. Yum.

Absolutely delish!  Took to work for a birthday party, raves and nothing but crumbs left.  Followed the recipe to a tee except added 1 teaspoon of instant coffe granule to the ganache. Make was fluffy and the buttercream icing was worth the trouble.

This is a great recipe, but the first time I made it, the two cake pans overflowed in the oven, so the next time I used 3 cake pans. 
Does she really mean egg YOLK? in the frosting? I used egg white. 

Marvelous birthday cake for a marvelous friend.

This is an amazing cake! It is extremely rich and decadent. It is a little finnicky and takes longer than the recipe says (for me at least), but I get nothing but compliments when I make this. The extreme chocoholics of my family approve!

This cake tasted delicious.  I made it for my adult daughter's birthday.  The cake is so moist and the ganache and buttercream just the right amount of sweetness.  I could only find semi-sweet chocolate chips, so maybe the ganache was sweeter than it was suppose to be, but still tasted amazing.  Make sure to soften the cream cheese or it lumps and makes the decorating very impossible.  It was the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  My daughter loved it too!  As did my chocolate loving family.  :)

This is one of my favorite cakes ever!! I am an extreme chocolate lover and this definitely hits the spot.  I'm not a fan of the chocolate cream cheese icing, I usually substitute with a chocolate fudge icing instead.  And the ganache is my fav!!  Just heat up heavy cream in sauce pan (do not let boil) and pour over chopped up chocolate, stir until smooth, easiest way to make ganache!

Great Recipe!  I used 60% semi-sweet chocolate bars and milk chocolate chips, because I already had those in my cupboard.  It worked out fine.  Also I did not have enough ingrediants on hand to go to the store so I doubled the ganache and used it as frosting.  Absolutely delicious!  I will try the original frosting though next time I make this because it sounds wonderful!  BTW I made the cake and ganache the night before and frosted it in the morning.  I was afraid that the ganache might be too hard, sitting in the fridge all night, but in the morning it was perfect frosting consistency.

Great flavor, but the cake sunk - even if I baked it with the right temperature and time. Way too crumbly, sugary. Won't make it again.

Use Frymamas tips.. made the 3 layer version. Just enough frosting for 3 layers. Only change was to use 1 cup boiling coffee instead of water. (coffee intensifies choclate flavor)Great look... great taste. Great recipe!!

I started making this cake 3 years ago when I was 9 months pregnant and starving and waiting around to give birth. I make it every year now for my dad's birthday. I top it with homemade truffles or shaved coconut. I use dark chocolate to help cut the sweetness plus my family hates milk. Every time I make it I change something a little here or there but this is by far the best chocolate cake I've ever made

If you love chocolate, this is the cake for you.  I've always thought that I had the ability to handle alot of chocolate, but this cake proved otherwise.  It was delicious, but I had to eat very small slices at a time because it was so rich!  Works better for your waistline that way, though.  Great recipe and fairly easy to make!

I only made the cake and I followed the directions exactly.  It was rich, moist, and dense.  I would definitely make it again.  If you want a perfect looking cake just make sure there is no extra flour in the pans when you put the batter in (the batter absorbed the excess flour and the edges came out crumbly), but it was still a delicious birthday dessert!

I am not sure what happened...I didn't think the cake itself was very chocolatey at all!  I also had a hard time getting the cake out of the pan.  All the layers split or stuck in the pan.  I must remember next time to use baking paper to line the pans.  
Sorry!  I hope everyone else has better luck.

This was amazing and so delicious. It took the entire afternoon to make though. I also think that you could get away with making half the amount of ganache. I agree with the other reviewers that the icing is hard to spread. Overall though, this was absolutely delicious and worth the time!

This cake was wonderful! I made it for my husbands birthday, and it was a big hit. The best part was the frosting!
