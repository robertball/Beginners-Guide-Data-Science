My Greek boyfriend raved about this to his mother.  Except he said I used the wrong noodles - his mother uses penne pasta instead.

I found this recipe to be a bit bland. I will add some nutmeg next time. I will also increase the amount of bechamel as I like my pastitsio very creamy.

We made this for the neighbors and served with a salad. Thought it was going to end up dry but really was not as you would think. Maybe could up the bechamel a little if you wanted an obvious sauce but proabably would not be as authentic. Good to esemble ahead of time and bake later

I read reviews on this before starting so I did double the sauce. I used 2.5 tbsp of both butter and flour, then added 2 cups of milk. Then added it to 2 egg yolks. DO NOT throw out the whites, you can whisk it and then add it to the sauce it makes if lighter. I didn't add parmesan to sauce either I put it on top with  a bit of nutmeg. 
I have to say I will use less pasta next time and more tomatoes this was dry and it needs more herbs as well. Neither my husband were really fussy on this and we both love greek food. Maybe with a few changes this might be a 5 star in our house.

Made this today, very carefully, and I'd have to say it's a failure:  two dry pasta layers, a not-very-flavorful beef layer, and a bland bechamel layer.  I'd recommend trying one of the other pastitsio recipes.  A properly made bechamel sauce (requires patience and lots of stirring) and some nutmeg are important; look for a recipe with those features.

This was pretty good.  It had a very nice flavor with all the Parmesan cheese.  Next time, I do plan to use a little less macaroni, but overall it was good.

I'm giving this recipe a four because I think it would have been much better if I had followed the recipe more closely...I used crushed tomatoes (because that's what I had on hand) instead of diced tomatoes and I think that was a problem.  As another reviewer mentioned, I also would reduce the amount of pasta if I make this again.  The sauce over the top was great!  (I might even consider increasing the sauce.)

Used penne instead, 2 cans of stewed tomatoes chopped & drained, b/c it is what I had on hand. Also at least doubled the cream sauce and voila, my family loved this!!!!! My husband just keeps saying "YUM!" over and over........

This recipe was very easy to make.  Taste was OK, nothing special.  Not sure which part makes this dish 'Greek', flavors were no different than other tomato-pasta bakes I have done in the past.

This is amazing.  The only changes I make: I add a diced green pepper, a little bit more cheese than what is called for here, and just a little bit of hot sauce in the meat and tomato layer to give it a kick.

Very tast. I spiced it up a little by addeing  some chilli flakes and a dash of tomato chilli sauce to the meat while browning. I cooked the meat in the tomato juice till about half done before baking it. Also I think it would be better with more white sauce topping.. So next time I am going to thicken 2 cups of milk. A pinch of salt and pepper in the white sauce in also needed. I added the whole egg... (hate wasting the egg white).

After putting this all together I didnâ€™t have high hopes.  It looked like it was going to be super dry but I followed the recipe and I was surprised how good it was.  If I make it again I will probably either double the sauce or use less noodles.  But as is, it was pretty good.  I did mix it together on my plate to distribute the flavors a little betters day added a little garlic salt...cuz everything is better with more garlic!

The tomato sauce was very bland. I had to double the cheese sauce and it still didn't cover the top completely. This recipe made a thin, but cheesy coating that didn't even cover the pasta. It's also missing the delicate spices that make this dish so appealing.

My hubby loved this. I didn't have the right noodles and if I had it would have been perfect. Great flavor! Added a little red pepper flake as we like heat and a little more chopped garlic. Found this on a whim, tried it on my hubby (culinary test subject) and he loved it.

Read the reviews and doubled the tomatoes and sauce - turned out great!  Didn't taste very Greek to me - comments about adding nutmeg probably would have helped.  All the same we really enjoyed it and will make again!

My hubby requested this dish and he LOVED this version!  My picky kids even had seconds!  I did double the sauce recipe and it was the perfect amount.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was really good.  I used leftover Trader Joe's mac n cheese (the kind from a box) in place of the noodles, and added a frozen pesto cube (ice-cube sized) to the sauce.  Yum!  My daughter asked if we could  make it again tommorrow.
