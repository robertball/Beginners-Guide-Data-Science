First off, (and I mean this in a polite way) for those of you saying there's no sense in doing this in a crock pot when you have the do the work either way with the apples, you are missing the point of having a crock pot in the first place.  It frees up your time so that you do not have to keep such a watchful eye on it.  My husband had to go work this morning, on a Sunday, and so he just switched on my crock pot for me when he left the house.  Everything was already in there...and when I woke up, I had fresh apple crisp, already cooked and just waiting to be eaten.  Moving on...this turned out perfectly!  I left my apples in slices since they were small apples.  I also adjusted this recipe to be gluten free and free of refined sugars.  I actually mixed the walnuts in with the apples rather than the topping.  And I used xylitol in place of sugar, adding some molasses to the crumb topping to add the richness of brown sugar.  I don't care for ginger in my desserts, so I just used cinnamon and nutmeg for the spices.  I also used a lot less sweeteners...only about 1/4 cup of xylitol in the apples and 1/3 cup in the crumb topping, with about 1/4 cup of the molasses.  I also omitted the cornstarch and just used a few Tbsp. of GF baking mix.  I used Earth Balance in place of butter, and it works great.  I can tell you the taste is the same, even with my changes.  I've made apple crisps the way as printed before going GF.  They are both great.

I don't have a slow cooker so I did this in the oven, and I have to say I can't see why you would bother doing it any other way. Preparing the apples took the most time and you have to do it either way.  I used half Granny Smith and half Macs and I added oatmeal to the topping, and baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes. The spice balance was excellent.

Very good and easy. I think next time I will add a little oatmeal to the crumb mixture. Otherwise it was great with a side of ice cream. We camp alot and I like to bring things to make in the crockpot, this was nice because it is done in 2 hours without heating up the house/camper. Thanks SDROSIE. I will make this again. Good flavors. UPDATE: Just as good the next day cold. Loved this and will make again.

Fabulous recipe designed for the slow cooker! I love apple crisp and usually end up doing this in the oven. I had my doubts, but this really proved to be a great alternative! I subbed 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg for the ginger and added a couple of tsp. of vanilla to the apples that I sliced thin vs. chopping. I wanted the apples to be recognizable and not to get mushy or "lost" during cooking. Like others, I added 1 cup of rolled oats to the topping. I cooked it for 2 hours on high, tuned it down to low and then left the lid off for one hour. I do think next time I would add more apples because I ended up with more "topping" or "crisp" than apples when all was said and done. Overall, it was awesome with vanilla ice cream on top!

Delicious!  I addeda large handful of oatmeal to the crisp topping, as suggested by other reviewers.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours, then turned the lid crooked so each end of the oval cooker was exposed and cooked one hour, the topping was quite crisp.

we loved it. Used all Granny Smith apples and added 1 pack instant Oatmeal (Cinnamon and Apple) and cooked it for 4 hours on low, took off the lid and cooked another hour on high. Came out crunchy, but not too crunchy.  Will make this over and over again.

This recipe is great for my office pot lucks.  I prep everything the night before using the lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.  I put everything in seperate bags (apples, cornstarch mixture, and topping) and put it all together when I get in.  Everyone enjoys this perfectly cooked, hot dessert when it's pot luck time.    I don't like nuts so I substitue 1c of quick cooking oatmeal and leave the lid off for an hour before it's time to eat (which makes the office smell fantastic).

I used 3 Granny Smith apples, 3 Gala, and 3 Jonagold. My sliced apples filled a 3 quart bowl, which worked perfectly in my 4 quart slow cooker and cooked to just over 1/2 that amount but my apples were quite large to start with. One variety turned to mush and I am sure it wasn't the Granny Smith. Some held their shape well and were actually cooked perfectly. The flavor was very good and had just the right amount of sweetness. However, it never hardened on top. For this reason alone, I don't think I will be making it in the slow cooker again - I will stick to using my oven.

Wouldn't have believed you could make apple crisp in a crock pot, but this recipe proves it to be true.

My hints/tips: I sliced a 3 lb. of Ida Red apples, put in a large ziploc bag along with 1/2 cup br. sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1 tblsp. cornstarch. Close bag and shake to coat apples well. I took contents of the bag and put in an even layer in crock pot. 

I made my own topping using 1 1/4 cup rolled oats(not instant), 3/4 cup br. sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Cut in 1/2 cup of room temp. butter and knead with fingers until crumbly. Spread evenly over apples and  baked according to instructions. Leaving the lid off really does make the "crisp" yummy! Served it with french vanilla ice cream. Happy for seconds!

Why make this in the crock pot when you can stick it in the oven? hours of AROMATHERAPY! Wow!  Also wonderful flavors.  I always double the cinnamon for the same reason.  Really good.  I'm an apple crisp officianado and wanted to try a slow cooker version.  I'm glad I did.  Also, you free up space in your oven for your main dish.  Dessert is no fuss!  Thanks for posting Rosie!

I added one cup of oats to the topping, and cooked on high for two hours. I thought the top was crisp, and I didn't need to turn the top sideways. I should have cooked it a little longer, sothe apples would have been softer in the middle, but no one in the house could wait!

THIS IS GREAT WITH THESE 2 SMALL CHANGES. FIRST CUT YOUR APPLES INTO LARGE CHUNKS, AND USE GRANNY SMITH.  AND 2ND, STIR 1 CUP QUICK COOKING OATS INTO THE CRUMB TOPPING.  I COOKED MINE 2 HOURS ON HIGH, THEN PARTIALLY UNCOVERED THE COOKER AND COOKED ABOUT 1/2 HOUR LONGER TO CRISP UP.

The hubby and I loved it!  Definitely follow the advice to turn the lid of the slow cooker for the last hour if you can, it crisps up the topping and the whole house smells amazing!  I added oatmeal to the topping, cut sugar in half and used less butter.  I also used whole wheat flour in one batch and we couldn't tell the difference.

Added 1 c. oatmeal; it was a hit! Because it was for a potluck after work, I cooked the apple mixture on "warm" all day, when I got home from work I added the topping mix I had made that morning and cooked it on high for 2 hours.  Nummmy!

This came out very good. The taste was great. I was a little disappointed in the topping. I would have liked it to be crispier. My kids enjoyed it and said it tasted like an apple pie without the crust. I will try this again but in the oven next time. I used paula red  apples and they cooked down quite a bit. I think depending on the type of apples you use, you should adjust your cooking time.

I haven't had much success lately with apples for some reason. I had also been wanting to try a dessert in the crock pot pot. This fit the bill for both. I did not have any success with this either and wasted a lot of ingredients. First of all it only made 6 servings so I had to double it to have enough. I have one of the new larger slow cookers so it was no problem. I used all granny smith apples. Followed directions to the letter. I left it in the slow cooker for a couple of hours on low and then uncovered it for the last hour. Finally to keep it warm for dinner, I kept it on the "keep warm" setting". I should have turned it off b/c it burned in the left end very badly, although it did not smell burned. One of my daughters liked it - no one else cared for it. Most of it stayed in the 'fridge for the rest of the week and no one warmed any up to eat again. I agree with rae on the Apple Mush. It was very sweet. I give this a thumbs down. Even with the lid off the topping never got remotely crisp. The white ceramic bowl in my cooker is stained and I still need some good apple recipes. This makes the third one I have tried. When I told my daughter what I was cooking,she said, "Oh, no! Mom you always have trouble with apples!" and I did. . . . perhaps it was me but I have to give this only 3 stars at best b/c I doubled it that could have been the problem.

I was really excited to try this one because I am a huge fan of the slow cooker but have never made any desserts in it before This was excellent...I used cortland apples from the farm, eliminated the nuts because my girls dont care for them, and doubled the cinnamon in both the cornstarch and flour mixture. Just the best and so easy to throw together and forget in the slow cooker for a few hours. Smells amazing while cooking. I also sliced my apples instead of chopping them and that was the most time consuming part...but well worth it. I also was impressed how the cornstarch mixture made a nice thick apple-y sauce .....these apples were not dry, they lended enough juice while cooking to make a nice thick yummy sauce. Thanks...love it!

My husband loved this! I did triple it. Did one crock pot for home and the double batch for a Halloween Pot Luck. Everyone really liked at work too! I did Sub 1 cup oats instead of the walnuts, and that is way too much. Cause it swelled up and made to much crust. then i made the apples too thinly sliced, and it totally turned in to apple sauce. I think next time I'll stick to the walnuts and BIG apple slices. Other than what i did wrong it was wonderful!

5 star - Best ever!!!  We had an outdoor block party on a very cool October day on the shores of Lake Ontario.  To say the least this hot tasty desert was a big hit.  I doubled the recipe and used a 7qt pot.  I used toffee chips for a topping instead of walnuts. I also sprayed the pot with cooking spray before I began. Very crispy, very tasty.

I have done this on the stovetop and in the oven, but never in the slowcooker, but this sounds doable in all three.  I love this, I am heavy on the cinammon and also add a little vanilla just for aroma. It can be made with cranraisins, plain raisins, oatmeal or anything else you want to try in there that works. This we serve with icecream.  It's to die for!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I used Splenda brown and white sugars in place of regular sugar and I merely filled my crock pot with apples, tossed with the white sugar and spice mixture.  Then, I put the topping on!  I will definitely make it again and soon!

Wow! This was incredible apple crisp. I did make a few changes. I added 3 more apples, along with a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also added 1 cup of rolled oats to topping. Cooked on low for 4 hours, removed lid last half hour. Will definitely take to a outing. :)

I have to admit I made so many mistakes in this recipe. I accidentally added the brown sugar to the apple mixture and was then out of brown sugar for the topping. I used white sugar for the topping. also left out the nuts and added rolled oats instead. This was fantastic, I was so surprised how well it came out in the crockpot.

I had a bag of apples I wanted to use up.  I had seen this recipe and thought it would be a good one to prepare while my grandson napped.  I doubled the amount of apples (Gala).  I generally don't like things too sweet, so I added a little less sugar and upped the cinnamon.  I also added a bit more walnuts, just because I love nuts.  The topping didn't look crisp enough, so I took the lid off for the last half hour of cooking.  It was delicious, and I will definitely make it again, trying the suggestion of adding oats.

Taste was excellent. Made to the recipe, once you get the components of the recipe together, this is very easy. Only cooked on high for 1 1/2 hours, then the hour for the top to harden. The cooking time for my apples from our backyard tree was still too long, they were more than done. The top never did 'harden' up, I don't see how it could get crispy in the crockpot. Oatmeal added to the top mixture would probably help. Still, it had a yummy flavor and this would be good done in the oven at far less time than the crockpot. The crockpot method has its place under certain circumstances I would think, but I will not make again this way, I will do in the oven, with this recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

We had a bunch of ripe apples we needed to use and our oven was out, so I used this recipe.  It was truly DELICIOUS; and even better than the oven version in my opinion.  I didn't measure the apples exactly but used eight medium size apples and proportions worked just great.  I also accidentally cooked it for an hour on low with the top off because I didn't read the instructions properly and the result was a nice, thick and crunchy top.  I made this again today for a company party and everyone else's dishes needed to microwaved while mine was aromatic, piping hot and delicious.  A HUGE HIT ALL AROUND!!!

Wow, loved this. Served it to 7 ladies for a book club and they gobbled it up. Ice Cream is the best match for this! I used 12 Granny Smith apples. Cooked for 1 hour on high, 2 hours on low. Covered top of crisp with oats, maybe 1/4 inch deep, then turned the lid on my crockpot and cooked for 1.5 hours. The top was perfectly crispy!

If there's one thing a slow cooker is not designed for, it's a recipe with the word "Crisp" in the title. A slow cooker is designed to keep all the moisture in the recipe, letting none escape, plus it almost always manufactures more and more moisture throughout the cooking time. Especially with moisture-laden ingredients like apples. Thus, this apple "crisp" recipe came out for me like applesauce, or applemush, with the apple pieces swimming in more than a cup of liquid in the bottom of the crockpot by the end of the even reduced cooking time I used. And way too sweet. I'll stick with baking my Apple Crisp the oven.

This is always a hit wherever it goes!  I had always baked apple pies, now I fix this, and you can prepare it the night before, to cook the next day.  This is a staple in my house.

I have made this twice in the crock pot, and it turned out spendidly both times. I actually doubled the recipe because I was feeding a crowd, and it worked fine. Everyone wanted the recipe. Excellent dish. Thank you so much. Oh, and don't forget the vanilla ice cream on top. So good.

Great recipe!  I made a double batch for potluck today.   The spice ratio was spot on!  I substituted old fashioned oats for the walnuts (allergy safe.)  And added some oats to the apples as well.  Everyone loved it, they scraped the crockpot clean!!
Thanks for the great recipe, I will definately make again.

This is a definte keeper for our family!  I doubled the nutmeg and cinammon which was perfect for us!  I cooked on high for two hours and then turned lid sideways for another hour on high.  The topping crisped nicely and it tasted GREAT!  I used a crock pot liner which made cleanup a snap.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, SDROSIE!

I used "baking" apples and followed the length of time suggested and I ended up with much.  I omitted the nuts as we have a nut allergy in the house.  I would make this again, but cut down on the cook time

This is so good!  Can't imagine a negative review!
Followed directions except added 1/3 c. oatmeal to topping,only used cinnamon for spice, used no white sugar in topping- only used brown sugar.
Family loved it!
Just use this recipe and change it up only if you choose to.  It's delish!

This was delicious!  Made as directed but added about a cup of oatmeal as other suggested.  Next time I think I will leave out the ground ginger because I really didn't care for the taste it added.  That will make it 5 star in my book.  It makes a lot of topping even in a large 6 quart slow cooker.  Two hours on high and an hour on low with the lid crossways made a nice crispy topping.  Can't wait to make again!

This was easy to make which is just my speed!

I did not use the ginger because I didn't have any.  I added 1 cup oatmeal to the topping and left the apples as slices rather then chopped.

Served warm with Vanilla ice cream.  SO delicious!!

I just have to say that this recipe is scrumpdidleyuptious!  My husband also thought it was fantastic!  Frees you up to do other things.  I also do not peel the apples, this helps to hold them together better.  At the end I let the lid off so the crust gets crispier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

AH-MAZING! I was skeptical that this would be anything special, but I was sooo wrong. It was so terrific that I'm going to make it again and again! I didn't have ginger and ran short on cinnamon so I added a tsp of vanilla. I also took the other advice and added 1cup of oatmeal to the topping. Definitely use a FULL 6 cups of apples because they cook down so much. YUM!

This was excellent!  And absolutely fool proof - trust me.  I'd mistakenly left it on warm for almost 6 hrs before I realized it wasn't on low.  So I put it on high for 2 hrs & cracked the lid for abt an hour after that.  Super yummy!!  I did the same as other reviewers & added abt a cup of quick cook oats to the topping (I'll add a lil less next time).  Pair with plain vanilla ice cream for a fabulous treat!

This turned out great and was so easy to do.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I found it a little too sweet.  I'll definitely make it again but I'll cut back on the sugar and will probably use granny smith apples (I used fuji since that is what I had on hand).  My husband and my in-laws love it.  It tasted fabulous with vanilla ice cream.

Awesome easy recipe.  Had to use up leftover apples from Thanksgiving pies and this was perfect.  Did oven rather than slow cooker as recommended in other reviews and was perfect with some ice cream on the side.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

YUM! I made this recipe today, as a way of using up leftover Granny Smith apple slices from a fruit tray. The apples were not peeled, and were just sliced thinly. I left them like that, and otherwise followed the recipe precisely. Using the slow cooker allowed the apple peels to cook down and become unnoticeable in the dish. This is so good, and was so easy! Thank you!

It was a little sugary for me and I even omitted the white sugar in the topping. I used Earth Balance instead of butter and whole wheat flour in place of the white flour, both substitutions worked really nicely. Next time I'll cut the sugar even more. It was delish, though!! We had fresh granny smith apples from visiting an orchard last weekend, so this was a great way too use them!

This is heaven in your mouth. Seriously. I prepared this, went to the kids' soccer practice and came back to this deliciousness. Don't chop up the apples too small though or you will have more mush than substance.Unless you prefer that of course! I used Earth Balance soy margarine instead of butter to make it vegan and a bit healthier.  Yum!

This was delicious! This was the first recipe I tried in my new slowcooker and I'm glad I did. It turned out close to perfect. I followed the recipe exactly after some consideration of taking the walnuts out, seeing as I'm not a fan of nuts in my desserts. But I kept them in and am so happy with that decision to do so. The only problem I had was that the top didn't get quite as hard as I had expected. But regardless, it was still delicious served with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream.

Easy and so good!  I'm thinking about making this for Thanksgiving dessert since I always have problems juggling dishes that go in the oven.  I omitted the nuts and think I will try adding oats next time.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and it gave a nice nutty flavor.

Such a hit!  Wonderful.  Used 1/2 tsp salt in topping and it was perfect.  Also do not like nuts, so added a cup of butterscotch chips instead for the topping.  Only used 1/4 tsp ginger per personal taste.

Mmmmm, this is good with vanilla ice cream! I made as stated except I sliced my apples. I found it quicker to slice than chop. Will do this again, thanks!

My husband only had one serving of this because I ate the rest before he had a chance.  I used 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 Fiji.  I didn't have any ginger on hand so went without.  I only had dark brown sugar and it was fine.  I will make again.

Too sweet.  My husband really liked it but I felt it was too sweet -- even when topped with ice cream.  I have many other cobbler recipes that are much better than this one.

Great for serving a hot dessert to company.  Added about 1/2 cup of quick oatmeal to topping. Make sure slow cooker has been greased on the inside.

I subsituted butter for shortening since i didn't have any on hand...i didnt have lemon juice so just used water & didn't have walnuts so i used a handful of old fashions oats as some reviews had suggested. i cooked on low for 4 hours yet still managed to have some very slightly burned spots & very chewy sides. I would suggest not using the ginger AT ALL. If you're familiar with the flavor and use it in other meals you know a litle bit goes a long way with ginger. I used less than what was in this recipe i still can single it out & it just doesnt mix well with sweetness to me. (I use ginger for meats/veggies mostly). I'm eating this now, fresh from the cooker and the crumbly topping is extremely sweet. I feel as if im chewing on rubbery sugar, honestly. The apples themselves taste great minus the lingering ginger taste. I'm giving this 3 stars. I won't be making it again, just wasn't what i was hoping for. Im actually kinda sad i wasted a scoop of ice cream on it :/

Made this this wekend on our annual Halloween camping trip.  I was delicious!  I prepped everything before we left on Friday, and threw it in the crockpot after dinner on Saturday, a couple hours later, after the kids were done trick-or-treating, we all sat down to a hot delicious dessert.  The only changes I made were the same ones most reviewers have been suggesting, I added oatmeal to the topping, and traded out the ginger for nutmeg.  Highly recommended!!

Great recipe! I make this when I have extra apples around but found that I like adding "honeycrisp" apples with an equal amount of ganny smith apples. I also add the oatmeal to the topping.  My family and friends love it and I get asked to make it all the time.

I am smelling this cooking as we prepare for our holiday potluck. So easy to make and from my taste testing, a bit on the sweet side but if we add ice cream it will balance the sweetness. What a wonderful addition to my Crockpot list of things to make!

I made this in the oven because I didn't want to wait on the slow cooker this time but I like that it is an option. I added a cup of oats to the topping like others. My husband liked this but I thought it was too sweet. The proportion of topping to apples was off. Next time I will make less topping and cut back on the sugar.

I had my doubts about this but DH says it is awesome!  I used Cameo apples which are tart sweet.  I didn't bother peeling them.  I added about 1 cup of quick cooking oatmeal to the topping.  My biggest problem with this recipe is how to store the leftovers.  I guess I'll have to put the whole crock in the frig.

I have NEVER rated a recipe until now and I've been using this website for YEARS!!   This is a wonderful, easy recipe.    The only 2 things I changed was to add more cinnamon to the apples and to the crumb topping because I love cinnamon.     Also added oatmeal to the crumb topping.   

Try this recipe, you won't regret it.

My only complaint...and I mean my only was the peeling. I prefer the peeling on (more fiber) but the peels in the slow cooker were still a little firmer than i would normally like, but other than that it was great! I even cut up another stick of butter to put on top before I let the crust brown on top.  I omitted the nutmeg (I was out), but other than that I made it true to recipe.  I did double it and put what didn't fit in my slow cooker into a 8x8 casserole dish.  It wasnt nearly as good as the slow cooker one, but still good.  Great great recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I made a ton of revisions - and I loved it!  the base was basically the same (but i doubled/tripled the amount of apples).  
For the topping I used almond meal, and 2/3 cups total of sugars,  i only used cinnamon, and to taste.  Used real butter so there were no artificial ingredients.  I cooked on low for @6 hours since I used a apple corer/wedger and the pieces were kinda large.  OH - also added @3/4 cup oats.

This was amazing! Rich, gooey...a great recipe!  The flavor is perfect. I recommend using Granny Smith apples.   However, there is no "crisp" part of the apple crisp that you get with oven baking. However, if you don't mind that and just slather it with vanilla ice cream like I do, the lack of "crisp" is negligible!  I topped with cinnamon & spice oatmeal in the crock pot, which was a great addition.   Slow cookers vary in their abilities to seal in the moisture, too. So, if you have a history of having crock recipes turn out a little dry or overdone, you may need to add a little liquid to the mix, somehow. For example, a 1/4 cup of water added to the slow cooker before anything else might be helpful.   Problems were negligible. I'd make it again if I needed to do so. I definitely prefer the oven-baked version of apple crisp, but, during holiday mealtime when your one oven is overworked, taking away one of the bake-ables and putting it in the crock pot is really a great help.

I made this for Christmas.  I did use Splenda white sugar and brown sugar.  Also I did bake it instead of making it in a crockpot.  Everyone loved it.  I served it with ice-cream. I doubled the recipe.

This was fantastic! My first time cooking it in a slow cooker. I substituted oats for the walnuts. After I made the topping I had so much that I took 1/3 of it and mixed it in with the apples, making sure they were all covered. Then put the rest of the topping on top. Cooked it for 2 1/2 hours (half hour for warming up), tipped the lid for an hour. It came out goey, I wished I had vanilla ice cream, luckily I did have some cool whip. Fantastic Recipe! Will use again!

Great Recipe! Easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!  I took some of the other reviewers' advice. Put it in a 9 x 13 in pan. Baked in oven covered with foil on 350 for 20 minutes. For the last 25 minutes I took of the foil. baked for a total of 45 minutes. Added instant oatmeal (maple syrup flavor) in the walnut crumb topping. Came out crispy & perfect. Next time I might cut down on the sugar, in the cornstarch mixture & apple mixture. It was still good a few days later. I forgot to put in the lemon juice & couldn't tell the difference.

Good.  don't overcook or you'll have apple sauce.  Be sure to remove the lid so the topping gets crunchy.  I would make again.  I substituted some of the flour for oatmeal in the topping.

This was soooo good.. I didn't have any ginger so I skipped that and we don't eat walnuts so skipped that.
After the first initial mess w/ getting the apples ready ( I hate coring apples lol ) it was a smooth, easy to follow recipe and once it is in you can go on with your day till its done.  Made my house smell so good. :)
I will be making this over and over again.  I added more cinnamon because we love it.
Thanks

My kids loved it. But I think that's just because they haven't had an apple crisp before!  I used the cornstarch, yet it turned out pretty watery.  Looking back at the picture now, maybe it was meant to be that way (?).  I loved the making a dessert in the crock pot, but we won't make this one again.  Watery, and not "crisp".  Not a disaster by any means, but there are so many other better apple crisp recipes out there.

Used this recipe while camping.  Niece/Nephew came for dinner & were amazed @ how good it was!  They've NEVER had apple crisp before (shame on their mother!) and had 3 helpings!  It was a delicious recipe and one that I'll make again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I'm not a big apple fan but this was really good. Like many others, I added about a cup of oats to the topping mixture. Can't imagine eating it without the oats. Used Smart Balance butter and fat free vanilla yogurt to try to make it healthier. I will make this again when fall comes.

Taste is wonderful, but I think there was too much topping with this one...I prefer a lighter covering of the streusel topping and this was just too thick for our taste.

The apple mixture is delicious, however I didn't have any luck with the crumble on top.  Would highly recommend for the apple portion, try a different crumble and it would be outstanding!  Thank you for sharing.

I used Granny Smith apples and it turned out very mushy. The flavor was good, but I prefer a firmer apple in my crisp.

I just tried this receipe last night, I have never made dessert in a crockpot before and thought that I would give it a try for me & my fiancee's anniversary dinner and we both loved it. The only thing that I altered was adding Old Fashioned Oatmeal to the recipe (probably about 1-2 cups) and I used half Granny Smith and half Sweettango apples. I cooked it for 3 hours on High and let it sit with the lid open for 1 hour and it came out perfectly. I will definately be making this again.

so easy to make! that's what I loved about it. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, instant oatmeal, and left out the walnuts (only because I didn't have any). I didn't bother to peel either - I just used my apple slicer and threw them in the slow cooker. Because I have so many cortland apples from apple picking this weekend - that is what i used.

WOW so ez BUT SOOOO good was the hit of the dinner----used brown sugar and no white and they ask for seconds. 
Did cut back on sugar amount because of sweetness of fruit (used asian pear and apple combo)
Served with whipped cream

Came out wonderful even though I used old apples that were past their prime. Didn't need to cook quite as long as it says, but it depends on your slow cooker.

I cooked this in the oven on 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  It came out fantastic with a golden crispy crust!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg and ginger.  I only used 4 big Gala apples, and  I also added one bag (2 cups) of frozen sweet pitted cherries.  I didn't need the lemon juice at all.  I followed the other reviews and added oatmeal to the topping.  My whole family loved it, and my husband, being a professional chef, doesn't usually like anything I cook.

this was fabulous! I tried it with rhubarb and just added extra sugar since rhubarb is so tart. It was perfect for a day that was in the 90's when we didn't want to heat up the oven. There does seem to be more crust than fruit, but that could be either good or bad depending on your taste.

Perfect! 
I used some soft gala apples and added a handful of oats to the topping mixture.
I set the slow cooker to high for 2 hours, however I read the reviews and ended up taking the top off after an hour and 20 minutes. The topping was perfectly crumbly and crispy.
Thank you for the submission. It's a keeper!

Tried this recipe yesterday...YUM.  Used 6 Granny Smith, finely sliced apples.  The only spice I added was cinnamon.  Cooked on high for 2 hours, uncovered for 1 hour to crisp top.  Did not add oatmeal to the topping as others suggested but didn't need to.  Topping was perfect.  Family and grandchildren loved it.

To follow on with Trish, second off, and I mean this in a polite way as well, using a crock pot also really cuts the heat in your kitchen during these hot summer months.  This is a good recipe.

Recipe is delicious. Measured all dry ingredients, separating Crisp from Apple Mix, and put each in separate labeled fold-over sandwich bags. Combined as directed the next morning. After chopping 2 large and 2 small Gala apples, there were too many to fit in my 1.5 quart cooker so I chopped them again into smaller pieces. With apples still in glass mixing bowl, I added and thoroughly stirred in lemon juice to keep apples from browning then covered bowl with plastic wrap and put in frig overnight. Halved the rest of the ingredients, using Allrecipes calculator. I subbed white sugar with Apriva and having no walnuts, used 1/2 cup quick-cooking oatmeal. With apple mix filling cooker 3/4 full, I spooned mixture of Crisp ingredients over it. Good thing, because I had to leave out 1 cup. I slow cooked 3 hours, then 1 hour without the lid. The topping did not harden as directed. Disappointed, I decided to make apple turnovers so opened a package of canned jumbo flaked biscuits, rolled each biscuit flat into a 5-inch circle then added 2 teaspoonfuls apples, folded and crimped edges to made turnovers. I’ll be the first to admit, next time I’ll use pastry dough. The apple filling tastes better by itself. Though the recipe did not turn out as it should have, I enjoyed making it. Next time I'll use Red Delicious apples; first time using Gala.

What a wonderful addition to a family Uno game night!  Served warm and our four teenage boys said "wow" alot...especially after topping with vanilla ice cream!  Followed recipe without walnuts and cooked in oven as others suggested.

MMmmmm. If I had it to do over in my tall (but not oval) crock, I would put in the fruit followed by layer of crisp mix, then fruit & top w/crisp mix. The middle layer might not get crisp but the ratio would be better for flavor. I don't find the that mix gets that crispy anyway. I did add 1/2 c oatmeal to crisp mix. I used more peaches than apples (as that's what we had plenty of), & I added vanilla extract to startch mix. Very tastey.

I used 12 granny smith apples and sliced them fairly thin and left them in the fridge over night in the slow cooker vessel covered in sugar. Pulled it out the next morning and in 2.5 hours... yummy. I tried a couple of different slow cookers and I think I have it dialed in now. If your willing to trial and error the texture a little its worth the fuss if you have some different slow cookers.  My first batch was mushy BUT TASTEY!  Second better and on the third try with a different slow cooker it was perfect.

What a simple recipe!  I never thought of using my crockpot to make a dessert.  To this recipe I added a pint of my canned pears (drained).  I substituted the nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice but only because I am not a huge fan of nutmeg.  I did add some extra dashes of cinnamon because we like a strong cinnamon taste in desserts. I did remove the lid for an additional 1/2 hr for the crumb topping to firm up but it really didn't harden at all.  All in all, the apple crisp was simply delicious!!  I definitely will be making this again.  I've already promised the kids that I will make it for our big Thanksgiving dinner.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe but my kids liked it. I like my apple crisp with a little bit crispier top than this one makes. It seems a little soft. I did use three different kinds of apples since they were not specified in the recipe. I used 3 Granny Smith, 3 Fuji, and 1 Red Delicious (because I was short an apple and that is what I had on hand). I also added an extra Tbs of cornstarch because I knew the Red apple would go to mush.  The Granny Smith apples did not soften up, they stayed crunchy after 3 hours on high, I think my cuts were to big on the Granny Smith apples. The fuji were cooked perfectly though. For the topping I added a cup of oats in to the mix. I will probably throw the leftovers in the oven to crisp up the topping. Served with vanilla ice cream on top.

I tried this recipe  before I had a student make it. It was very easy to make and my family really loved it. The only thing I might have changed was an apple that held up a little better during cooking.  THIS is a must try!!!

Delicious!  I wanted a big batch so cut up 9 cups of apples, reduced the sugar, and left it on slow for 3 hours and 1 hour for crisping.  Will definitely be my go to for company dinners.  So easy.

I've made this 3 times sans the walnuts as I have an allergy.  This recipe is PHENOMENAL!  The crock pot is the BEST!  I would recommend using apples that are more tart, like granny smith or some Jazz apples which I just discovered today.  The dish is already a bit sweet, and the Gala apples I used the first 2 times are also sweet.  I enjoyed the contrast between the tart and sweet.  This is my go-to dessert!

This turned out great! It was quite a hit and I had left overs despite 6 adults having some for dessert. We did serve with ice cream as its very sweet. I dont think you could eat this one on its own as a stand alone. Worked great in the crock pot. I did not have ginger so a added a little bit of clove for some additional fall flavor.

This was so very easy to make.  The hardest part was cutting and peeling the apples.  If you have a apple peeler/slicer, it will take no time at all.  I made this for a large group party and by the time I went to go try it, it was all gone.  In fact, they were still using the spoon to scrape off anything that was left in the slow cooker.  Needless to say, it was the big hit of the party.

Pretty good! I may alter the crumble a little next time, it didn't quite do what I wanted it to for "crispness". Though how crispy is it going to get in a slow cooker really? 

For a slow-cooker apple crisp, this is totally doable. I'll make it again. Made my Yule dinner a success.

Yummy!  Doubled the recipe but used 1 1/2 c of quick oats in place of nuts.  12 guests had a reasonable size serving each (w/vanilla ice cream) but a few of the youngsters were asking for seconds...none to be found!

Um. MORE PLEASE! Holy smokes this was easy and delicious and my family loved it! We ended up using pears because that's what we had in the fridge and using 12 cups of super ripe pears and just overflowed all the ingredients measurements. It was OUTSTANDING! Will be making this quite a bit through the fall with multiple types of fruits. Yay! Thank you :)

Loved this!!  I kept the skins on the apples and used sweet apples.  Went over great at a family gathering.

Great! Added 1 cup oats to topping as another reviewer suggested.  Got rave reviews and lots of guests had seconds.

This was soo good. I followed the recipe to the letter. Even though the top didn't get hard (as I knew it wouldn't), I was still very pleased and surprised with this from the slow cooker.

This was quick & easy to throw together, thickened & crisped beautifully. I used half apples & half pears that needed to be eaten and used quick oats in place of the nuts. I cooked on high(#4) in my oblong slow cooker for 2 hrs & pulled the lid for an hour. Perfect! The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is that the apple concoction is waaaaay too sweet for me. I probably should've tasted my fruit prior to sugaring, to get an idea of what I needed...or possibly just use brown sugar instead of the white would give it the right flavor/sweetness. Regardless, I'll be making this again!

Doubled this and cooked in a 6 qt on high for 2-3 hours, then moved to low for another hour. Served it alone for dessert. AMAZING! Very yummy. The top didn't crisp because I didn't take the lid off, but tasted amazing anyway. Will for sure make this again. If you aren't much for sweet, skimp on the sugar. I made it with *almost* all the sugar, and it was sweet but not overly so.

The crock pot recipe was great! I made it as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving and this way it didn't take up oven space and we got to eat it warm with ice cream! The balance of spices was perfect. I also added oats to the crumble topping.

I followed this recipe exactly with an addition of about 1/2 c. oatmeal added to the topping. FANTASTIC!! Left it in slow cooker and removed top at end for an hour while still on low. Absolutely wonderful!! House smelled amazing and I didn't have to make w rush of dinner. Did it hours before and then was ready after dinner. Didn't have ice cream so just put some cool whip on it and it was great. Hubby laughed bc I kept making yummy noises while eating. Kept it on low for several more hours and was nowhere as good as when the recipe said was ready. So don't leave it cooking much longer than recipe calls for. It's absolutely delicious. What a great slow cooker dessert recipe. Warm and gooey and topping not very hard but was so good didn't matter.

I didn't have walnuts or ginger, but it was still okay. I added a cup of oatmeal to the topping. I'll probably try it with different fruits and less topping.

This tastes awesome! I didn't have nutmeg, so I substituted allspice. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla before the lemon juice. I didn't have any walnuts, so I left them out. I only wish that I had read the other reviews first. I would have added oatmeal to the crisp topping. I will definitely do that next time! Without it, the topping is kind of doughy.

I loved the idea of making apple crisp in the crock pot, however, the topping didn't get very hard. It also was a little too sweet for me. I will try making it again...but next time I will cut back on the sugar & bake it in the oven. Thanks for the recipe.

I used Golden Delicious apples...or maybe they were granny smiths...I can't even remember now. I also added the 1 cup of oats to the topping mixture. The textures and everything were really good, but I felt something was lacking in the flavor department. Once I added vanilla bean ice cream, it was very tasty, and not jus 'okay'.

This is the easiest apple crisp I've ever made and it tasted delicious!  I went with this one because I needed something I could take to work and still serve warm.  I cut it all up the night before and kept it in my fridge.  When I got to work the next day, I sat the crock pot on my desk and turned it on.  By lunch time, everyone was asking about the wonderful smell.

After reading all of the reviews stating that the topping was not crunchy I didn't expect it to be. So with that understanding it was pretty good. Kind of mushy but good with whipped cream or even better with ice cream. The next day it was even better (at least 4 stars) once I put it in the oven to reheat. Thanks for sharing!

I thought that this was good and it tasted like apple pie. But I do prefer a crunchier top made with oats. It was very easy to make and tasted great with vanilla ice cream.

This is possibly my favorite dessert cooked in the oven - I appreciate a slow cooker version! For all those commenting that they added oatmeal to the topping, I was thrilled that this recipe did not call for oatmeal. For three generations my family has made apple crisp with a flour/sugar/butter topping and that is what I like best. Oatmeal interferes with the wonderful texture you get with just those three ingredients. Try the recipe as written, without the oatmeal!

I read all the reviews. Great comments! 
Changes: I cut down the sugar to a total of a 1/2 cup using brown sugar only....1/4 cup for each, apples and topping.  6 cups of sliced apples called Opal. 1 cup rolled oats.

The MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE that makes the biggest difference is to cover the  crock pot with a clean dish towel and then put the lid on. Bake it like that till the time is up without peeking. The dish towel absorbs the condensation. The apple crisp comes out more baked. I live in the south and if I can keep the heat of the oven from running our central ac unit I feel very happy saving the cost of electricity.
Low for 4 hrs seems better than high for 2hrs.

Used all ingredients, replaced white sugar with Splenda.  It tasted great and family loved it, especially my 1 year old great grandson.  He usually would not come to me, let his taste it and he followed me around the house.

This was a awesome recipe, I for one loved it!
I did make a couple of changes, I left out the nutmeg and doubled up on the cinnamon, and instead of adding nuts, I added a cup of oatmeal.

I substituted oatmeal for walnuts due to nut allergy of guest.
I was confused by last sentence of directions. "Partially uncover the slow cooker to allow the topping to harden, about 1 hour."  We debated as to whether this meant the last hour of cooking or sitting 1 hour after cooking was complete.

This was really good. I followed the recipe as written with one exception: I doubled the amount of cinnamon because we all love cinnamon. I only cooked it for three hours on low to get the apples soft enough to suit us before I popped the lid off for the last hour. It was really popular here and I will definitely be making it again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it just turned into a mushy mess that tasted worse than it looked. Not sure what went wrong (maybe the apples weren't good for it - I used ambrosia), but I won't be following this recipe again.

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe stated.  I used 1/2 Gala apples, and 1/2 Granny Smith apples.  I served this for a ladies brunch with an egg casserole and pigs in a blanket.  It was a hit, and they ate ALL of it!

Total mush. Tasty mush, but it lost all integrity. Will try again, only because my husband really likes apple crisp, and I like the idea of a slow cooker option.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the topping, although delicious, never gets hard even after 80 minutes of cooking uncovered. I think the key to not getting applesauce is to slice the apples in big chunks and use a mix of apples. I used Braeburn, Golden Delicious and Jonagold. It was a perfect mix.

I made it for my coworkers and they loved it.  I didn't have any ground ginger so I substituted ground cloves instead.  I also added a few pears with the apples to use them up.  Last change was to substitute skor bits for the walnuts.....just because I am not a walnut fan.  Will definitely make this again!

Very, very good!   Great for a crisp fall day.  I too add some quick cooking oats to the topping.  Also drizzled butterscotch ice cream topping over the apples before the topping.   As someone else suggested, made on low for 3 hours then put the lid sideways across so ends were open for another hour.  Topping was nice and crunchy.

This was a good apple crisp but even though I love my slow cooker and use it regularly in the fall and winter I still like the topping to be crisp. However even when I make it in the oven the crisp is never crisp enough for me until I found this tip.
Mix up your topping and put it on a baking sheet at 375 for about ten minutes stirring a couple of times. Then put the topping on the crisp and bake. Turns out great especially if you like lots of topping.

Loved it! Im a labor and delivery nurse and my daughter was having a baby at the hospital where I work. I put this in the slow cooker and when ut was done turned it down to warm and the staff was able to enjoy it for quite a while.... Warm with ice cream! The crock pot is the way to go as it stays nuce and warm for a longer time and with liners clean up is a breeze! I wouldn't want to do the cleanup with the oven method.

I made a couple changes had no cornstarch so just used more flour, used dairy free spread and lime juice instead of lemon. No nuts also. It came out fantastic, absolutely delicious. So addicting, everyone loved it the flavor was great.

I adjusted this for 3 servings and made it in a 4 qt slow cooker. I replaced half the flour with oatmeal and used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had.  Like another reviewer I cooked 3 hours on low and then rotated the lid 90 degrees to leave both ends of the oval cooker uncovered.  As my dad would have said, it was "larrupping"!

This is very good but I will probably try with half the sugar next time.  Every time someone in my house would eat it I would just imagine the mound of sugar that laid before me that they were blissfully unaware of.

Also for those like me that worried if the apples would burn in the slow cooker and not melt into a liquid-y goo, it does melt so don't worry about that.

This is great.  I love it to take to pot lucks at work.  It goes great with vanilla ice cream and it is always piping hot, just how everyone loves it.  It doesn't get that crunchy top like it would in the oven, but you can't transport the oven version and serve it hot like you can this.  I've made it several times and it is always a winner.

The only dessert to completely disappear at my pot luck today! I used more apples (around 8 cups), a mix of Granny Smith and Yellow delicious than the original recipe called for. Doubling  the cinnamon, and leaving out the ginger and nutmeg made it more like some of my other favorite recipes. I also followed the suggestion of others and added 1/2 cup of Old fashioned Oats to the recipe. Next time, I might even add 3/4 cup. I would also consider cutting back on the sugar in the topping part. This "baked" ( 2 hours on high with the lid on, 1 hour on high with the lid about 1/4 off) during the meeting portion of our event, and by the time we started the potluck, everyone was drooling. It really smelled and tasted very good!

Loved the idea of making this in a crockpot. I made with the optional high setting as given and it was dry in some places and apples got a little spongy (I used Macintosh). The lemon flavor was also a little strong for me...I will use apple juice next time and I will also try the low setting.

It is a favorite with my wife and me. I have added raisins to the recipe, as well. In Sweden, where I live, vanilla sauce is poured on top, for a special topping in the bowl, but I like to add a little milk in mine.

Sorry to say this didn't work for us. I found the topping to be too much and it didn't crisp up. If there was a next time I would use 2 or so more cups of apples and still cut the topping down. The house smelled great though! thx SDROSIE

This is great!  Prepped the night before and took crock pot to work.  It was a hit!  Everyone wanted the recipe and made the office smell delightful.  My co worker made it with half the topping, and said it was still just as good, so I may try that next time; it made quite a large amount of topping for one recipe.

Best cooked apple dessert I've ever had!! And I don't really care for apple pie or cobblers. I used Honeycrisp apples, weighing in at about a pound each! So I only had to use 3 of my 40#bbox supply. I also used raw sugar, rather than the white. But I did use the recipe amounts. I used 2 packets brown sugar instant oatmeal + 2 packets of plain for topping, omitting nuts. Cook time was a little less because of the  apple type, I suspect. Soooo good! Nice warm treat for Thanksgiving late night. Wish I'd hhad the ice cream maker ready, but I will get some tomorrow for the left overs.

I liked that I could fix & forget but I was disappointed with the topping.  Next time I will bake in the oven to achieve the "crisp" that I missed with the slow cooker.  Thank you for a simple recipe.

Tried this today with some apples that my husband brought home from someone he works with and wasn't sure what kind they were but they were on the crisp side so they were perfect for this recipe. i following the recipe except I did add oatmeal to the topping. It was great to know that after dinner warm apple crisp ready to eat! Very tasty!

I used Granny Smith, it worked great. The spice mix was perfect. A bit too much crust for the apples, though; next time I'll use 8-9 cups apple.

I love this recipe,  My co workers loved it so much they requested I make it a second day in a row.  I did use a cup of oatmeal in the topping, didn't use the ginger or nutmeg because I didn't have it and it was still wonderful.  Funny but when I put the topping on top of the apples I thought it was too much dry ingredients to get moist.  It wasn't....  Lol. It turned out perfect.  We removed the top the last hour and it made our office smell so good!  Perfect, easy, make it and forget it dish.  Perfect for an office carry in for sure.

I doubled this recipe.  Put it in the crock pot without the topping.  Then put the apples in a 9.5x11 pan and covered with topping; then cooked at 425 for 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it and there was none left.

This recipe was great - but next time I think I'll add a handful of old fashioned oats.  That was missing for me.  But I love the idea of throwing it all in the crockpot, running out to get errands done and coming home to an awesome smelling house!  Delicious with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream.

Not the best apple crisp we've ever had, but very good!  We stayed true to the recipe except for not adding walnuts  (didn't have any, and wasn't feeling the love for the idea anyway), and adding two packets of instant oatmeal to the topping.  There was something a little funky tasting that I can't quite put my finger on ... I'm guessing it was the ginger?  So I might skip that next time, and also add less sugar.  I also wanted to mention that we did not have the too-juicy problem; in fact, almost the opposite.  I can only guess that it is the type of apples used that creates too much juice or not enough.  We used mostly Honey Crisp and a couple of small Golden Delicious.  We will make this again ... my thanks to the submitter for the recipe!

This recipe is a winner.  I made it this afternoon.  I followed the recipe but added a couple of packets of the new Ocean Spray Cranberry Instant Oatmeal to the topping ingredients.  The freeze dried cranberries add a really nice flavor and aroma, the oatmeal adds a really nice texture.  I used fresh Fall Granny Smith baking apples and cooked it 2 hrs on high.  The Granny Smith apples held up in the slow cooker, they didn't all turn to mush and had a nice tart apple taste, not to sweet.  You won't believe how good this makes your house smell while cooking!!  Nice recipe!

The flavor is good.  I would definitely use this recipe again, but would likely bake it in the oven.  The texture of the topping was mushy and it's not very pretty.

The only thing I didn't use was the walnuts because I am not a big fan of walnuts with desserts but it is so good. It is way better using these ingredients than just pie filling and cake mix. So soft, the perfect tart taste and the perfect sweet taste. I used all golden apples.

Excellent! Served warm with vanilla ice cream. I've made this twice to rave reviews. My only comment is that I think it only serves 6-8. Maybe 6 for my bigger eaters.

Don't use Mitsu apples. They become applesauce. I did add oats to the topping but other than that I did no other changes. I will try this recipe again but with a different apple. My oven died which is why I decided to try slow cooker recipes I wouldn't normally try. I will have to play around with more recipes.

Delicious and easy.  Only issue is that it was a bit too juicy.  May mix some flour into the sugar that I toss with the apples next time.  Still hot here so we're  not using our oven making this a perfect dessert for our family.

Easy and awesome!
I didn’t have Cornstarch so I had to substitute 3x the amount with flour. Put in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hours and then warm for a while. Turned out really well.

I like the idea of this but it just didn’t work for me.  The apples got very soft and the topping didn’t crisp up for me.  The taste was good but it just wasn’t apple crisp.

Great recipe! I added 1cup of oats to the topping and it was just right. Cooked on high for 2 hours and then moved the top to crisp up the topping for another hour. I used 7 grannsy smith apples instead of 6 and I almost wish I had used 8 because they really cook down. However the flavor was still amazing! Add some vanilla ice cream and holy wow!

For those of you dreading the apple prep, I used the victorio apple slice/corer/peeler. Whole prep took me 15 minutes.

I usually bake the apple crisp in the oven. Now that I've used the slow cooker with this recipe, it was delicious! I used most of the ingredients except for the ginger. My family loved it, I will definitely make this again.

Made it, loved it.  I added oatmeal to the topping and used more cinnamon in both the topping and the filling.  I love the  flavor and smell of cinnamon.  I will definitely save in my  favorites  and make again.

I was out of cinnamon and none of us like nutmeg, but we all loved this (fighting over the leftovers)!  I made it with gluten-free flour and kept all else the same.  So yummy and easy to change things up.  I can see oatmeal, pecans and berries being added for other variations.

I gave it a two star because it tasted great!  Apples came out perfectly cooked.  But I wanted a crisp topping and it was not.  It was soft and gooey.  I will not be making this again.

It was amazing that the topping really did get crispy, just by leaving off the top the last 1/2 hour. Delicious and it kept the house cooler by using the crock pot.

This is really good! I substituted a cup of oats for the walnuts as some of my diners won’t eat anything nutlike. This made a wonderful, warm apple dessert without heating up the kitchen in the summer!

I really love this Recipe.  I would give it a 5 star rating if I didn't tweak it a bit.

I don't have Nutmeg so I just use more Cinnamon (I love Cinnamon) and I also don't use Walnuts but use Oats instead!

This is excellent. My only real suggestion is to cook in the oven if you want the crusty top.

A great slow cooker recipe for apple crisp. I did use Earth balance butter to make sure it was vegan totally   I did not use walnuts in this batch and it still came out great.  I used slightly more of the spices to give it s but more tang or punch.

Followed the recipe as written. Super easy. Cooked on high for 2 hrs then 1 hr with lid turned sideways.  It came out great. My husband and I thought it was a little to sweet, hence the 4 stars. Maybe it it was the huge portions and vanilla ice cream we piled on top. :) I will definitely make again. Oh, it’s even better the next day. The flavors really set up.

I wasn't sure how small to chop the apples, so I cut them in about 1-inch chunks; I used a Crispin variety and cooked them on high for about 2-3 hours, last hour setting the lid crosswise to crisp up....it was perfect! Served with vanilla ice cream, no caramel sauce. My bookclub friends loved it!!!

Boy it makes too much.  I've eaten it all week and still haver another container full.
I don't care for the after taste of the Stevia I used.  I think I'd switch to real sugar.  I only had Gala apples to use.  Not sure that Grannie's would have made a huge difference.

I just read Skunkee's review (most helpful critical) and I must say it certainly is not fair to the provider of this recipe to give a poor review when the  the poor reviewer did not read the recipe properly.  The recipe plainly states.....cook on High for 2 hours or Low for 4 hours.  She reversed them and then wondered why it didn't turn out ???  My star review of 1 is not for the recipe, but for this Reviewer Skunkee.

Turned out very well (I've made any a crisp the normal way). I turned the lid halfway after 2 hours, and it crunched up the top well. I did add oatmeal, as others suggested, and I trimmed the amount of butter as much as possible. Oh and added a ton more cinnamon, as others recommended

Got rave reviews for this.  I ran out of time, so I put it in a casserole dish and baked it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes.

I made this for a potluck at work.  Everyone raved about it.  I didn't have any ginger, so I substituted cardamom.  It was wonderful.  This is going to be my new go-to dessert recipe.  Since my gala apples were small I just sliced them with my apple corer/slicer, and I went through the 3 pounds of apples in no time.  I prepared my apples the night before, and left them soaking in a lemon juice water mixture in the refrigerator.  I also combined the dry ingredients the night before.  Then when I got up in the morning all I had to do was dump everything in the crock pot and go to work.  I may cut down on the sugar next time because it was quite sweet, but that's what everybody seemed to like.

I cut the apples in thick slices and left the skin on. No reason in wasting the good skin. I also think next time I'll use a little less sugar and maybe oatmeal in the topping too. Other than that I think it's wonderful.     Thank you for a great recipe.  I will definitly be making it again.

I made this for a family gathering and it was a super hit. I used frozen apples from my Apple trees, thawed and drained them...it worked perfectly!  Made my second batch 3 days later since there were no leftovers.

I am a very very busy person so I absolutely LOVE slow cooker recipes- this was fantastic.  Little too sweet for my liking so the second time I made it I cut the sugar in half.   I highly recommend this!

I almost gave this 5 stars but it is so sweet. My daughter and I both had stomach aches after 1 scoop. I used red an green apples. It tastes amazing but I will cut back on the sugar next time. This is a must try!

I made this tonight to bring out to my sister's campsite to share. I left out the nuts since the kids don't like them. Also,  i subbed 1/2 cup of the white sugar for 12 packeta of stevia to reduce sugar a little. I also added 1/3 cup oats to the topping since i left out the nuts. It was so yummy! Thanks for the recipe. And very easy to make it gluten free.

This is super sweet. GOOD...but not GREAT. I used a combo of apples...green & red and served it with vanilla frozen yogurt & Carmel sauce. I will make this again and hopefully it will turn out a little better.

Once again this turned out a hot mess.  I've made the recipe 3 times hoping somehow it would improve - I give up.  It has a definite raw flour taste and I left the lid ajar and then removed completely for almost 2 hours on high.

YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!! This was excellent, and got rave reviews at a party I had. Only thing it really needed was a tiny bit more sugar in the crust, but truly delectable without changing it at all.

This was Ok. I realize that the slow cooker is more convenient, but I found that the top got sort of gummy (even with taking the top of the crock pot off for an hour). It was soggy and a bit bland. I think I will stick with baking my apple crisp in the oven.

Pretty good.  I like the flavor, but I like a crispier crust.  I let it cook uncovered for awhile (even started to smell like the apples were burning a little), but the center of the crust was still pretty mushy.

not bad, I didn't have enough apples, so i used a can of peaches.  Would have been better in the oven.
