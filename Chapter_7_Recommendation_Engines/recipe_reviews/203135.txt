Mmmm! I love zucchini and tomatoes but roasted in the oven like this is my absolute favorite way to eat them. I've already left out the onions and just use onion powder which works well for me, but I'm not a big fan of onion to begin with. The moisture from the veggies and the olive oil combine with the seasonings to make the most amazing thick juice on the bottom of the pan, which is why I am now a oevn-roasted veggie convert: I love to dip my bread in it. Some have commented they'd prefer using a smaller pan, but I feel the 13x9 allows this amount of veggies optimum room to roast separately in the oven and not just be a baked veggie casserole. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, while I may change the seasonings or even the veggies themselves I feel the proportions and cook time/temp are perfect!

Yummy.  I halved the recipe and did a few substitutions.  I used one zucchini, about 10 grape tomatoes halved, omitted the onions and 3 teaspoons of chopped garlic from the jar.  We love garlic.  I added the parmesan cheese before baking and mixed that in as well.  And for an extra kick I added about a half tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  I think that really made it.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used a couple of the frozen basil cubes from Trader Joe's and threw them in before I put this in the oven and mixed it all together.  I baked at 450 for 10 minutes and it came out perfect.

Pretty awesome, I made it for my roommates and they really appreciated it since I normally cook alot more meat heavy dishes. It was also one of the first times I've cooked an all veggie dinner, and it came out splendideliciously. The red pepper makes it slightly spicy, and it works as a great side. If I were making it again I'd probably double everything since it only filled out half of the pan.

I liked the idea of this,  but after reading the recipe through, I knew right away the oven temperature and cooking time were excessive.  I cut my zucchini in larger chunks than the recipe called for and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes; then broiled for a minute or two to get some nice color.  The zucchini was perfectly cooked, although my tomatoes and onions were still over-cooked.  Part of the problem was that I had to use grape tomatoes (no fault of the recipe)  since we cannot get a decent tomato in Ohio this time of year.  The remedies that come to mind are to add tomatoes and onions later in the cooking process, maybe last five minutes.  Or use full size tomatoes and quarter them as indicted in the recipe and cut onion into larger pieces.  All in all this is a good recipe that just needs a little more tweaking.

Delicious!  There wasn't much left over, but I put what was left in the food processor the next day, and added it to some spaghetti sauce.  The left over veggies chopped in the food processor would also make an amazing spread for crackers or pita.

I traditionally make zucchini this way but on the stovetop rather than the oven and it was nice not to have to watch and stir it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't crazy about using the tomatoes with this method, since they seemed to cook too quickly and become kind of mushy.  As for the zucchini, it cooked through before it became the golden brown the submitter spoke of.  The fresh basil was a nice choice to finish this off but it still couldn't elevate this above average.

This was an excellent side dish for a cookout.  I made a double batch and used them to make an italian vegatable soup the next day and it was excellent.  This is so versatile I may try it over pasta next time with some shrimp.

DELICIOUS!  I follow the Zone diet, and this is a perfect way to get low-glycemic carbs and healthy fat (EVOO) into the meal.  I served over steamed cauliflower (gives it more substance for a meal) -- it was so good, I'm adding cauliflower to the recipe next time.  Tastes great when reheated; tried reheating with some crumbled feta cheese and that was delicious as well.

Excellent! Coming here to post a pic, I realized I left out the parm & basil. It's still delish without it! I love Roasted Veggies & the Red Pepper Flakes gives it a subtle kick that I love! Thanks for the recipe!

The nice thing about this recipe is you can add or delete your favorite veggies to this Italian leaning side dish.  We love adding red and green peppers with our zucchini, onion, garlic, and tomato mix and roasting the veggies tends to make them sweeter.  Also, garlic can be roasted in its skins and squeezed out after roasting and just stirred into the veggies.  This is awesome by itself or with pasta.  Great as a side or main course.

Made as directed and it was WONDERFUL! Have made it again since and added fresh mushrooms and corn. I also cut back on the oil, use less pine nuts so I could count it as less points on Weight Watchers. What a wonderful way to have a fresh healthy dinner.

Good idea for veggies!  We didn't care much for the red pepper, and I think I'll cut back on the olive oil ... a little too greasy for my tastes.  Also, I only used a sprinkling of shredded parmesan.  I can't imagine using a whole 1/2 cup of the grated stuff, yuck!  Fresh basil is a must.  Thanks!

This was the best zucchini we have ever eaten! My husband said he could become a vegetarian if all vegetables tasted this good and he is a big meat eater.

I made this last night and it was beyond delicious!!!  The roasting of vegetables together with a good EVOO is simply heaven on earth!  Truly the flavor is far greater than simply the sum of its parts.  So simple yet so elegant and flavorful - a side dish OR main dish that is pretty enough and tasty enough to please even the most discriminating husband or guest!!  I changed only slightly - using 2 large ripe tomatoes from my garden (not sure of the measurement but close to 2 cups - maybe more, 1 whole sweeter onion, 4 cloves garlic, added a good sprinkling of MSG and Fines Herbes (delicious herb).  I added the veggies to a sprayed 10x14" glass baking dish and liberally sprinkled the herbs/seasonings over top and gently tossed.  Eyeballed the EVOO but used more than 1/4 cup and tossed again.  Also salted generously and maybe more than 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  I let it sit "accidentally" for an hour so there was some juice from the tomatoes that I worried about in roasting (thought it too much liquid).  Let it roast for at least 30 minutes and it was perfect!  Sprinkled a couple handsful of Parmeson cheese on top after taking it out and chopped basil (about 4-5 leaves) and it was to die for!  The tiny bit of extra liquid (and there wasn't much) is perfect for dipping a corner of bread in - my Greek husband thinks that's the "dessert" so the extra liquid will now be an on-purpose strategy!  You have to try this!!  Thank you SweetBasil!!!

This was delicious!!  My husband and I loved it.  I used grape tomatoes and quartered them because I don't like big chunks of tomatoes.  Great flavor with a little kick from the crushed red pepper.

Roasted Garlic Zucchini Tomatoes Haiku: "Nope, no complaints here. These veggies turned out just fine, followed recipe." Great as written; however, I think the tomatoes need to be reduced, or the zucchini increased b/c the tomatoes kind of globbed their way throughout everything a little mushier than I would've liked. But the taste was great, and I think this would compliment just about any main dish as a colorful, healthy side.

I wish I would have added more zuchinni, and less olive oil. I also sliced my onion instead of minced, so I would be able to pick it up with my fork.

Really nice dish, I did make it in the oven but it could also easily be made on the stovetop. Great dish to use up summer veggies and you can cut back on the oil and skip the cheese if you want to make it even healthier. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! What a great way to enjoy zucchini. I even left out the parmesan cheese at the end (accidentally) and it was still fantastic. I probably used double the garlic but that's just because I'm a garlic-a-holic. I also used a mix of yellow and red tomatoes, and added oregano. Would definitely make this again!

Incredible! Didn't change a thing just scaled down to 2 servings but wish I hadn't. Pairs beautifully with Heather's Grilled Salmon (also 5 stars) for a hearty, light and healthy dinner/lunch. We always have these vegetables on hand but sometimes they get tossed if I buy too many, not anymore!

We used the vegetables on hand: zucchini, mushroom, bell pepper, carrot, eggplant onion and broccoli, and added seasoned chicken. Meanwhile we mixed olive oil, minced garlic, basil, sage, and lemon juice to coat the entire dish with. Sprinkled top of dish with red pepper flakes for a little spiciness. Took about 20-25 mins to cook, and served with toasted baguette. Delicious and beautiful! The zucchini stood out to me as the best-tasting vegetable cooked this way (very tender and tasty), although the eggplant and broccoli were also good. Probably will not make with the chicken next time (was a little dry and rushed...could have marinated longer), but we had some defrosted breasts to use so we threw them in.
All in all, a great summer recipe. I will make with tomatoes next time, as I think they would be wonderful roasted with the zucchini!

I found this recipe today in the daily favorite photos--just in time to make something different!  I used summer squash instead of zuchinni because that is all I had on hand.  I used extra garlic, but will probably even use more next time.  I cooked the squash for about 15 minutes before adding tomatoes, garlic and onions just so they wouldn't burn.  I can't wait to try this with zuchinni...thanks!

I love zucchini and tomatoes so I was really excited to try this as a healthy side dish for supper.  Unfortunately, for some reason, it just came out bland.  I doubled the garlic (DH and I are garlic fans) and the red pepper flakes, but the dish still came out just so-so.

This was pretty good but not great.  I followed the recipe verbatim and probably should have tweaked it a bit to better satisfy my personal taste: less onion and more garlic.  I'll def make this again with a couple of changes...thanks! :)

Wonderful!! I wanted to try something different with zucchini and decided to try this recipe. Excluded the red pepper flakes but followed the rest exactly. I put mine in the small roaster oven which worked perfectly. My husband is the final decision maker and he gave it a thumbs up; and he is not thrilled with veggies! Thank you for this great recipe!

yum really good.  I also added yellow pepper and instead of tossing in chicken, I cooked beef strips and tossed them in with the veggies before serving.  I cooked up a small amount of penne pasta to add in and voila - dinner was ready in 15 minutes!

Like a simpler version of ratatouille, this dish is quicker yet delicious. The roasting seems to brown better in a ceramic or stone dish.

Sorry, I tried this dish exactly, except I added some yellow squash to the mix. There was ZERO flavor!! Very sad. I will have to keep looking for a veggie recipe.

Nice recipe, thanks! I definitely enjoyed the taste of the roasted veggies. Switched out the tomatoes for 10 grape tomatoes (could have added more), halved and added about 5 mins before the end of the roasting time. Also added in 8 oz. mushrooms with the zucchini.

Very tasty, I chopped up the garlic and used sea salt, loved the pepper flakes! After the ten minutes in the oven I did five under the broiler. Served with a hunk of mozzarella cheese sprinkled with parsley and a sprinkle of evoo that I had browned in the high heat oven until it the sides were browning and sizzling.

LOVE IT!! tweaked the recipe a little, (used halved grape tomatoes) cooked it at 350 for about 40 mins for a much softer zucchini and broiled for about 5 at the end with the parm cheeseand basil on for a nice color. I added sliced celery for texture. The tomatoes did shrivel but had MUCH flavor. I also added leftover sliced bratwurst and green pepper, and tossed with al dente bow tie pasta, It was a hit!!

This is fabulous.  My entire family loved it.  I added about 2 cups of parboiled yukon gold potatos and used more fresh basil, like a  1/3 of a  cup.  I've also used flavored olive oils as well.  My new favorite recipe!!

Liked it! Not amazing/special, but the heat from the red pepper paired nicely with the flavors of the basil and parmesan. I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed it. It seemed very similar to some other recipes I've tried though. The tomatoes did seem to get a bit mushy.

I used leftover yellow squash skins and seeds after making baby food, can of tomatoes, partially cooked baby carrots, and some fresh spinach with minced onion, garlic powder, and no salt.  Put it in the oven with pork cops at 375 just to warm it up for maybe 10 min.  Forgot the parm cheese and basil, still great!

I enjoyed this recipe. I added a little big more red pepper, very little chopped onion, and baked it at 450 for 10 min and then 500 for 3 min. I also only drizzled the veggies in the olive oil, so I definitely used less than directed. Came out pretty good. Also used dried basil which tastes just as good. A nice healthy, quick, veggie dish that has a lot of flavor!

Tasted great!  Next time I think I'll decrease the red pepper a bit but overall it was a winner.  Will make again soon, especially with summer coming.

I made this last night using my last Jersey tomato.  It was "fall on your knees" good.  Followed recipe, didn't add or leave anything out. Freshly grated parm on top. YUM! Served it with pasta, but its good on its own.  Definitely a staple in my house.

This recipe was sooo good!! I did have to cook it for longer and added 5 garlic cloves instead of just 3 but otherwise did it just as it stated. I will be cooking my grape tomatoes and zucchini this way from now on...and even buying these veggies more often due to this recipe!!

Nothing special.  Lacks flavor.  Was good but needs more.  Maybe more spices or a more flavorful cheese.

I used the basic recipe, same oven temp & time, a mixture of fresh corn, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, little slices of green beans, garlic powder, salt & pepper, avacado oil, baked it then topped with fresh mozzarella to melt in oven another 5 min, then topped with fresh basil( all fresh from the garden except for the corn, I bought)  delicious!

This was so good!  I used 3 Tablespoons of olive oil and left out the Parmesan cheese to make it more Weight Watcher friendly.  My family loved it!  I am going to use the leftovers as a topping for a Boboli pizza.  I can't wait!

I added green peppers too since I love them.  One comment though- 2 zucchini could be 4 cups or 8 cups depending upon the zucchini at the Farmer's Market.  Better to list in cups.

It was simple and tasty. I added asparagus and I think the next time I make it I'll skip the tomatoes though. I'm not a fan of soft tomatoes.

yummm,,,,GREAT!!!!!!!!    I tryed  this tonight with "gifted" yellow cherry tomatoes, Zukes and summer Squash!  The only change I made was ; I switching from red pepper flakes to a Mix of Black Pepper and Red Pepper called " Hot Shot " by McCormick.
  I will certainly make this recipe again!  Easy and Healthy!

Made this for supper dinner last night. Used grape tomatoes, no red pepper flakes(I forgot), sprayed dish with PAM, roasted zucchini first then added sweet onions, garlic and tomatoes. Forgot the cheese and not fresh basil had died. Did drizzle a little olive oil over everything. Over cooked so some was really browned but this stuff was still really good even if I screwed the recipe up. Slightly carmilized veges were fantastic. Served with fresh macaroni salad and deli chicken.

Nice change with the red pepper flakes & fresh basil. Baking this during the summer when we have fresh zucchini just doesn't seem right, but that's what air conditioning is for. May try adding mushroom or some red peppers next time. Could use as a veggie main dish also.

Fantastic, easy recipe that works great as a substitute to boring old salad. I put it in the oven with 18 mins. left on my chicken or fish and dinner is all ready at the same time. Making it right now for the second time this week :)

This recipe is simple and delicious, not to mention very aesthetically pleasing! My veggies looked just like pretty restaurant veggies. I followed the original recipe almost exactly - I just skipped the tomatoes and used zucchini, squash, asparagus, and green beans. I didn't have basil so I just used Italian seasoning. We didn't have any parm, and I'm looking forward to using it the next time we make this, I think it will be so tasty! I also adjusted the cook time to suit the fish we were having - I cooked the veggies on 425 for about 20 minutes and they were perfect. Everything was so good! This will be the only way I cook zucchini (or veggies in general) from now on. It is wonderful to get so much flavor in a bite of zucchini or squash. I would think that even the veggie hater would enjoy this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I would probably give this four stars on flavor, but I gave it the extra star because it's healthy and you feel good after eating it. I may try what another reviewer suggested and sprinkle it with garlic salt. I'm eating some for lunch right now, but I'm finding it a little bland. I do like this recipe a lot because it's simple and healthy. I think if you're a person who prefers stronger flavor, this recipe has a lot of potential.

Excellent, spicy and tasty. Very easy to prepare. Baking temp is flexible. I baked it at 500 degrees since another part of the meal required this higher temperature. I cut back on the total time by a couple of minutes and it turned out fine.

This was wonderful!!  Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the red pepper flakes.  After roasting the vegetables I tossed fresh chopped basil in and tossed before serving, Did't even need cheese on top.

I made this dish exactly like the recipe was written. We both enjoyed the combination of veggie flavors and would definitely make it again.

Very good over pasta. I added a sliced yellow pepper and Italian blend of cheese before serving.
For me, its a keeper

I thought this was really good though I didn't add the parmesan cheese. I also used one zucchini and one yellow summer squash along with a few snow peas because I had them.

We enjoyed this and the simplicity of a side dish.  Baked for 5 more minutes and never "browned".  I guess if it bothers you put it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes.

Use a metal pan, not glass.  Cook longer if you want the zucchini to brown a little.   My tomatoes added a little too much liquid.  Maybe squish out some of the juice from them before you mix them with the zucchini.

Delicious. I would reduce the pepper flakes to a pinch, as a little strong. Make sure that you have fresh Parmesan and garlic.

This is delicious!   I also made with yellow summer squash and was also yummy.  I used halved grape tomatoes cause that's what I had on hand and I added freeze dried basil with all other ingredients to rehydrate while cooking (again because that's all I had).  Will definitely be making this again.  Great way to use up some of those summer squashes.

I made this with summer squash, zucchini, several thick asparagus stalks cut into thirds, thick sliced onions,  sweet potato In one-inch chunk, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. 

Cooked everything but potato and mushrooms for 45 minutes, adding potato and mushroom for last 15 minutes, at 350 degrees. Very nice summer dish will make again!

My college made a dish similar to this. This is the closest I found to the original. I think feta cheese works better than parmesan, but that's just my opinion. I also feel that it works better if everything is diced

I added more seasoning and fresh mushrooms.  The time needed to cook wasn't enough and it lacked flavor even with the added Italian spices.  I left in for 10 more min and added a light coat of balsamic salad dressing.   It made all the difference in the world and we will now have this again!!

Made this dish. Enjoyed it.  However, the veggies produced a lot of water which too away from the dish a bit.

My daughter made this from fresh vegetables from her garden and brought it to dinner with us. I was so impressed how beautiful it is and so very tasty. She actually forgot to add the cheese and fresh basil, but it was so delicious, I didn't know better. Next time, that will be a bonus.

Really liked this recipe, I cooked cubed chicken in olive oil first, took it out and added minced jar garlic, fresh tomatoes and zucchini, onion flakes, cuz I didn't feel like cutting fresh, then let cook for a while, then added fresh basil and the chicken with a pinch of ground red pepper, 1/4 cup of white wine and parm cheese...it was nice.

Delicious and easy. I used bigger slices of the onions and let them roast as well. Didnt have big tomatoes but threw in a couple yellow squash. And made mistake of putting cheese on with oil and it turned out great! Might even do it like that next time! But I will use less oil next time. Kids loved it! First time they would eat squash!

picked more zucchini and tomatoes  out of my garden and was wondering what to fix with the over abundant zucchini that I have had this year.  
Saw this recipe and decided to give  it a try, glad I did as it was really good!
My husband just asked me to fix it again, real soon.
  thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper.

I like this recipe, have made my own for years.  However this one was a bit oiler than mine-and I use the stove top to cook.  I also wait until the end of the cooking cycle to add tomatoes, they don't turn mushy that way.  My husband also puts this on the grill

This recipe is very good and I even used dry basil because I didn't have fresh on hand.  I added a lot more salt and red pepper flakes after I baked it because I like spicy and salty.

This is truly a delicious way to cook vegetables.  Best thing is if you cook a lot and have left overs they are great room temperature or cold.
PS: Don't use cherry tomatoes there is not enough juice. Use larger, sweet ones like Caspari.

The ingredients are great, but I found this all a bit of a "smush" when it came out of the oven. A good excuse to taste garlic, though!

I used roma tomatoes (not over ripe/quite firm) and cut them a little smaller than quartered as they were large.  I also put the basil in at the start so the flavour could roast with the rest.  I decided that instead of a side alone I would add it to pasta and use the whole as a side to steak.  When I mixed it with the pasta I added the parmesan.  My 12 year old son loved it as did I. I have printed this to add to my favourites book and will use it again.  THANKS FOR THE IDEA!!!

Pretty good, and the red pepper gives it a nice kick! I forgot the parmesan and basil the first time I served it, but remembered with the leftovers, and that definitely adds to the yumminess.

These were pretty good. There was WAY too much red pepper for us though, next time I will reduce it drastically. There wasn't enough garlic even though I doubled it.

Perfect!  I LOVE roasted vegetables and this did it for me!  Left off the red pepper flakes though :(  Daughter doesn't do spicy.  We love garlic so I used a ton!  Addition of the fresh basil is what makes this!  Thanks so much!

Omitted the basil and substituted some Italian herb mix for seasoning. I added baby bellas and a bit more garlic (because I love garlic) than the recipe called for. Otherwise, this recipe worked very well with the right amount of zip coming from those red pepper flakes!

I would've given this five stars, but I thought initially the flavor was a little bland. I added garlic salt and some balsamic vinaigrette. After those ingredients were added, it turned out great!

Pretty good recipe.  Next time I will cut the onions bigger, I like onions and they were just too small compared to the tomatoes and zucchini.  Definite keeper.

AMAZING recipe - loved it!  I altered it a bit to work with what ingredients I did have... I chopped rather than minced the onions and added about 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup (because I love onions, lol).  I sprinkled semi-creamy goat cheese over it instead of the Parmesan and then added green(basil) pesto instead of fresh basil.  I also made two helpings for myself and on the second helping I added plain yoghurt. Both helpings were absolutely delicious!!  YUM!!!
