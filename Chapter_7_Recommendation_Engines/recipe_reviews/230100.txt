Loved this recipe! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and put a couple cloves of garlic in the mixture and blended it all together in the food processor.  SO good! It was so tasty that I kept sampling the stuffing mixture and by the time dinner was ready I didn't have an appetite anymore Haha!

I made this dish exactly to the recipe.  It turned out great!  Flavorful and very filling!  The filling that you stuff the shells with makes quite a bit - I stuffed a whole box of 14 shells ( mind you they were not the large shells) to the brim and I still had about 3 cups of the filling left over.  I made a lasagna with the left over and froze it for another meal so not too bad of a problem after all :) !  My suggestion would be to scale down the filling ingredients or make sure to have more shells on hand and buy the larger shells.  Perfect recipe for company or a larger group!

Very good dish! It made a lot of filling- I had enough for all 12 manicotti and probably could have filled 3 more.  I froze half of them, since it was only 2 of us eating that night.  These are very creamy and flavorful. Only change I made was to add about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the meat. Will make this one again!

Used whole milk ricotta rather than cottage cheese. Blended the ingredients along with two cloves of roasted garlic in the processor.  Stuffed 14 noodles and had 1/2 of the stuffing left. Used it the next day for Lasagna. I'll be sure to find large noodles next time.  Most common review from the family was Wow!  Served with a California Cabernet Sauvignon.

Tasty and easy recipe! I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese as suggested by others. Big hit in my house.

Made this last night, thought it was good except for the fact that it was too wet.  Really feel that a jar and a half of the sauce would be better. The only thing different that I did was add some garlic and a small amount of cayenne  to the sausage during browning to add a little zing.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding about a tablespoon of minced fresh garlic. As others have stated it makes about double the amount of filling, which I spread over the top of the shells and covered with the sauce.  It was good right out of the oven but much better reheated the next day.

I guess I should have paid attention to the reviews. This makes a heck of a lot more filling than you need

I got everything for this dish at the store, except the Manicotti noodles. They were out of them. So I used Giant Shells. This worked out just fine.  Next time I will cut everything in Half for us.

This was kinda bland.  It needs something else.  I even added onions and fresh parm but it was still lacking.

The family loved this recipe!  I did substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese, and put some minced garlic in it also.  It was wonderful.
