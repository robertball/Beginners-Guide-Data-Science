I thought it was interesting.  The first batch came out soggy but the second batch came out crunchy and I liked that one better.  I would like a less sweet/sour sauce with it.

alot of quick recipes are not great, but this one was quick and delicious!  As for the oyster sauce - use enough to coat the filets on one side.  Great!

I used catfish nuggets and they were great.  It's a nicely textured white fish with a mild, take on the flavor of a sauce nature to it. Don't tell anyone I said so, but I like them cold, from the fridge as leftovers. The oyster sauce was a nice break from the bottled cajun sauce I usually use.  It's too easy to saute them after marinading if desired.

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I use more spices--1/2 teas salt and pepper, 1/2 teas hungarian (hot) paprika for a lovely golden color and a little kick, and 1/2 teas of ginger.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. i have also used this with steelhead trout filets. My guests raved!  Brilliant in its simplicity and flavor.

Very tasty. I had never considered coating catfish fillets with oyster sauce until this recipe. My dip coating was McCormick Cracker Meal Seafood Fry Mix as I had insufficient flour. Really, really, REALLY tasty. Thanks.

Sooo easy! I know some people commented about it being bland, but I didn't skimp on salt, pepper and especially the oyster sauce. It's still going to be a light tasting fish but the oyster sauce really added a unique flavor. I have to say my husband really enjoyed this, but after he knew there was oyster sauce on them he said he was glad I hadn't told him because he would have made up his mind to not like them.
The only thing I ended up doing different is not covering them after adding the sauce. I did do this with the first batch, and the steam turned them soggy. So for the next batch I just left it uncovered for the additional few minutes and they were perfect! Crispy and golden brown. Served with a quick wild rice and vegetable. Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious and simple though may be bland for some so either add some seasoning or serve it with something spicy like a home-made salsa, rice or veggie dish.

Extremely bland and boring.  I ended up with lots of lemon juice and more salt and pepper on it.
