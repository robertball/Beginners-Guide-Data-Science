One of my very favorite recipes on this site.  I love okra, and this is one of the best ways to prepare it that I've found.  No hints or modifications needed- this recipe works perfectly as written.  I've made it dozens of times to rave reviews.  It's best with fresh ingredients, but frozen or canned substitutions will work OK.  I serve it with rice.

I liked this very much, though I did replace part of the bell pepper with some pablano and anaheim peppers as well as a small yellow tabasco pepper. Gave it a nice bite! The small amount of flour gave the liquid just the right texture.

The okra was too mushy, sticky and sweet.  I'm not sure where I went wrong, but I think if I made it a second time, I wouldn't boil the okra.  I would just stir fry it.

Very easy. Not quite like my grandmother's, so don't forget the Tabasco!

Wonderful! I used can stewed tomatoes instead of fresh (didn't have any on hand at the time.) Also, I used frozen okra. This is one of my favorite dishes!

Good stuff! I didn't boil my okra that long, it was already pretty tender out of the garden. I didn't add the sugar, hubby is a diabetic. I also added a lot of garlic, just because we love it. Cooked smoked sausage with the other veggies, hubby doesn't think it's a meal w/o meat. Thanks!!

This recipe is nice. I didn't have a green pepper so I didn't include it. I always put garlic in my okra recipes so I added two cloves of garlic in with the onion. It is usually a good idea to put a little bit of sugar in with tomatoes to cut the acidity but I found this was a little too sweet. I would cut the sugar down by half next time. Also I used canned tomatoes and it worked fine. I served it over cous cous!

It was so easy and everyone loved it. I did add chicken and sausage which made it a complete meal. I will be making it again!

This was a favorite of the guys at the firestation!  Didn't boil the okra but sauted first.

This recipe is great.  I have made it twice now, my neighbors have a garden, and they shared some of their bounty with us.  I doubled the recipe, I did use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I also diced up some beef kielbasa sausage, I added that in with the peppers and onions.   I served with white rice and homemade biscuits.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was great, thanks! It was the first time I'd cooked with okra and I was really happy with the outcome. I added a clove of garlic and a red chilli (with seeds) but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I will slice the okra a bit thicker.
