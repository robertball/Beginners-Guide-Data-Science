Amazing!  I followed the recipe except substituting black beans for the kidney beans.  One of my favorite new recipes.

Im certainly no whiz in the kitchen but these fajitas were easy and full of flavor!  I used a carrot, zucchini, squash, corn, and green beans mixture with black beans.  I didn't have any cumin or oregano but this was a delicious dinner just the same.

Delicious!! We had a couple of people over the first time I made this. Everyone loved it - and I love finding creative uses for canned vegetables! Inexpensive, easy to make, healthy and super tasty. Thank you for a fabulous recipe.

We loved these! My husband, myself, 5 kiddos and a guest. I used fresh and frozen vegetables instead of canned but followed the recipe and they were a hit!

This recipe has a lot of stuff in it that I don't think need to be in fajitas as well as a lot of canned veggies (mushrooms, asparagus, green beans).  

However, the first 10 ingredients (from oil to beans) make a great marinated bean/corn mixture for a veggie fajita base, and would highly recommend it! I've made that part of the recipe often and am delighted with it. I usually use black beans instead of kidney and frozen corn kernels instead of canned.
