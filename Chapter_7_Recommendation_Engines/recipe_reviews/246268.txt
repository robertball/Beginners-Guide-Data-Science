3.8.16   At 77 calories, it's hard to complain too much, but I just wished that the strawberries played a bigger role, as it was a bit on the bland side.  Maybe a little bit of vanilla or almond extract would help.   I used almond soy milk, garnished with some blueberries, and definitely would add more berries the next time.  It still was good and creamy, and I love how this one breaks down nutritionally.
