Followed the recipe to the letter, and it was perfectly cooked at 50 minutes.  Only thing I did differently was bake it in a 10" springform pan, rather than a 10" tube  pan.  This turned out very moist, light, and the cream cheese filling gives you a hint of cheesecake (IMO).  Next time, I'll double the amount of cinnamon in the topping, as I'd like to taste more of it.  Makes a big coffee cake, and a good one, too.

Our family has an apple orchard, so I'm always searching out new recipes to try.  And I always make it a rule to read the reviews of previous posters.  This is a great recipe when incorporating some of the tweaks.  I did add cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture (@1/2tsp) and a large heaping spoonful of sour cream to help make it more spreadable.  I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/8tsp of salt to the batter.  It turns out perfect.  I do like making mine in a springform pan as someone earlier suggested.  Pretty presentation.

I used 250g regular (not low-fat) cream cheese which is more than the recipe stated (just so I didn't have a teeny bit left lurking in the fridge).  I also used natural unsweetened yoghurt instead of sour cream because I had no sour cream left.  The cake is super soft and moist - I'd make the recipe again just for the cake texture.  I was tempted to add lemon to the apples and may do so next time.  The last change I'd make is to add some butter to the streusel topping to help hold it on the cake.

This was delicious! Served it warm with vanilla icecream :D I also added a little bit of cinnamon to the cream cheese filling, to amp up the flavour. Thanks for sharing! :)

I rated it 4 stars because it needs a bit of tweaking, but has a good base to start. The only change I made before baking it was to add cinnamon to both the cream cheese and the batter itself, glad I did or it would have been very bland, and substituted white sugar for the icing sugar. Also, since I was using a bundt pan I put the chopped nuts, along with some oatmeal on the bottom, and then put the batter on top. Turned out good, next time I'll put more.

The cake is very sweet, so I will make it with a little less sugar next time.  I foung the cream cheese filling a bit heavy, next time I will add a bit of sour cream to it to thin it out. 

Everyone here at work liked it, the cake is very moist, I will definitely make it again with those changes and update my review.

Made it for work with the changes some folks recommended. Everyone loved it.  I would pour 2/3 of the batter in, and then the cream cheese mixture.  It sinks almost to the bottom.  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 t salt in the batter.  I loosened up the cream cheese mixture with some milk and sour cream.  I would have been more difficult to spread without it.  I made it in a spring form pan and baked around 70 minutes.  I also added 2T butter to the crumb mixture, but that was too much.  One T would have been better.  All in all, I would make again, if I needed a large coffee cake for an event.  Oh, I was concerned about burning the top, so I covered it loosely with foil the last 20 min.

Fantastic!   I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of minor details:  I doubled the cinnamon as recommended by lutzflcat and I baked in four individual pint Corningware baking dishes.  I reduced baking time by about 10 or 15 minutes for these portions.  Oh, and I skipped the nuts for personal preference.   One huge eater, would eat one dish, or two big eaters eat the same, but one of those in about 4 is about right for most people, so I would say this entire recipe serves 12-16 normal portions.   I made a couple of rookie mistakes when making these, but didn't seem to affect the outcome.   Also when making it, I thought it was pretty skimpy on the cream cheese filling, but I restrained myself and followed the recipe.   I'm glad I did as it was just the right amount.  Thank you for a great recipe.

It was really good. The only things I did different was that I added about a 1/4  teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/8 of a teaspoon each of ginger and nutmeg. I also cut too many apples so I copped them up and added them to the topping of which also added cinnamon and butter to. Also I was taking this to a neighbours house and wasn't sure if they liked nuts so I actually did half with raisins instead of nuts and I actually liked that side better. It was a big hit and everyone loved it I would definitely make this again.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! My only change was using vanilla yogurt for sour cream because I didn't have any in the house. (Used almonds instead of walnuts because of allergy.) Bake time is PERFECT.  Loved this recipe! Thanks!

Made this as written for a ladies Bible study luncheon (except I used full fat cream cheese) and it was wonderful! All of the ladies raved about it, and one lady said  she felt as though she just HAD to have the recipe. I will definitely make it again.

I added cinnamon to bake the cake batter and topping mixture.
I added oatmeal to the bottom of the pan to keep it from sticking.
I added a small amobut of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture but will not do that again.
I used a 9" round pan.
When I tested the cake, the toothpick came out clean but the center of the cake dropped after I took it out of the oven.
Next time I leave it in the oven for at least 5 minutes after it tests done.

Made this exactly as written, except I replaced the cinnamon with nutmeg, and it came out perfectly.  Used a 10 in spring form pan with the tube in the center, and took it out of the oven just as it seemed barely done.  Let it sit in the pan for a half hour to let it keep cooking a little more, and voila!  No 'goop' in the center!  Also, it tastes even better the next day.

This was good I just feel like it was missing something than I realized there is no salt in the recipe. I would of added 1tsp salt.
