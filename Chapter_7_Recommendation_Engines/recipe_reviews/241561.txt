This is a luscious sauce that deserves to be paraded alongside a good meat or fish. It certainly deserved more than my measly hot dog, but it primped it like nobody's business. So, for taste it is a 5-star treat. However, I have a different definition of easy. I had to toss out the my first attempt because I got scrambled eggs. I tried using a double boiler and that helpd keep the eggs from cooking. Reminder: Low and Slow. I used a hand ground mustard which is a bit less potent than the typical Coleman's.
