This was okay.  We love ham with pineapple, but the combination of it with lima beans over rice wasn't my family's favorite - the textures didn't work well together and even though I doubled the sauce, the flavor was lost in the rice.  I'd use the syrup/juice glaze on ham by itself, but wouldn't add the beans or put it over rice again.

This was very yummy.  I doubled the syrup/juice/cornstarch as I like more "sauce" on my rice.  I also don't like lima beans so I partially steamed fresh broccoli and mixed it in.  Very good.  I will make this again.
