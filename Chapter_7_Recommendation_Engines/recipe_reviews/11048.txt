These macaroons are amazing!  The only change I made was to make the 1/2 cup of shortening into 3/4 cup of margarine.  They taste so good my husband can't stay away from them.  I will definitely make these again!

The first time I made these macaroons,they were incredibly dry but had an awesome taste. Making these the second time, I followed other reviewers advice and substituted butter for shortening (using 3/4 cup), added 1 cup of coconut and only boiling mixture for 1 minute. These turned ot great!

I made a bachelorette's version for the single gal or anyone really with ingredients found more typically in the average kitchen but still needs a quick fix of sugar.  I used 3/4 c margaine instead of shortening, quick-cooking oatmeal instead of rolled oats, nestle hot cocoa mix w/ marshmallows instead of unsweetened cocoa, and then subseqeuently reduced sugar (which was just ultra fine, not white) to 1 1/4 c.  Turned out great!  Oh I also ran out of oatmeal so I threw in Cheerios so it wouldn't be so runny and didn't have any coconut so I didn't use any.  :o)  

Moral:  The basic recipe is very good and can be innovated to fit your needs/wants.

I used 1 cup of coconut and also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as this is what my mom did when I was a child. They are so gooey good. All those people saying they won't stay together are boiling for too long! Cut back on boiling time and you will LOVE these.

Delicious!  I used 3/4 cup margarine instead of shortening and 1/2 cup evap. milk instead of milk.  This gave them an extra burst of fudge flavour and were a big hit at work!  Thanks.

Overall, the recipe I had been looking for. I increased the margarine/butter though as this recipe does make dry cookies. Increasing the butter/margarine make ooey-gooey good cookies!

These were great! I read the previous reviews and substituted butter for the shortening. Apparently I did not read enough of the reviews to learn that boiling longer would produce dry cookies - I boiled about 3 minutes and they are a little bit dry. So - BIG POINTER for the next person who makes them - only boil them for 1 minute as previous reviewers have recommended! :)

I followed others' recommendations in exchanging shortening for butter and adding 1/4 cup and doubling the coconut.  I started eating it right out of the pan while it was still warm!  Talk about delicious.

I just made these today, and they are delicious! They totally satisfy chocolate cravings. I used 3/4 butter rather than shortening and boiled for 1 1/2 mins. This makes them really fudgey :) mmm.

Just like when I was a kid and my Grandma would make them.  I too substituted 3/4cup margarine for the 1/2cup shortening. I also used 1cup coconut. These are absolutely perfect! Soft and chewy and oh so good!

I replaced the shortening in this recipe with butter, and added 1/4 cup of shortening.  Also used 1 cup of coconut.  They were rich and creamy, didn't last long in this house.

These are very good! Quick and easy to make, too. I added extra coconut, used evaporated milk, and included some vanilla as others suggested. My oatmeal was oldfashioned style, not quick oats, and was a bit crunchy, but no one complained. I will make these again.

I am not a huge fan of macaroons but my husband just loved these (and he is not a chocolate fan) Plus they won me 3rd place (out of about 40 entries) in a baking contest.  Great cookie, easy to make!

I needed a no bake cookie recipe that didn't use peanut butter and am so glad that I found this one!  I used butter instead of shortening and doubled the coconut.  These are yummy and oh so quick and easy.

Excellent rendition of a classic!  I took some of the reviewers suggestions and added my own twist... replaced shortening with butter, added 1/4 c shortening, used TWO cups coconut!  Also, would add almonds next time for a true "almond joy" experience!  YUM!

This recipe has been a family favorite for over 30 years.  We do use butter instead of shortening, and 1 cup of coconut, and boil for 1 minute.  They have always turned out great and I make them for all of the office gatherings.

Very good cookies! I left out the coconut and added about an extra 1/2 cup of oats. Almost exactly like the cookies I had growing up. Instead of making the normal cookies, I made a giant bunny face that people could break off cookie chunks.

SO GOOD!!  I love these!  I used a half cup butter and a half cup butter flavored crisco and they set up perfectly.  I also used quick cooking oats and they worked great, and I increased the coconut to one full cup.  Give theses a try, they are delicious!

I've been purchasing these at a gourmet cafe every couple of months, and paying $3 a pop! Who knew they were so EASY to make at home? As some of the others suggested, I added another 1/2 cup of coconut, as well as another 1/2 cup of butter. I was sure to only them boil for two minutes, and they worked like a charm. Thanks!

THESE WERE GOOOOOOOODDD!!!
I took the advice of others and substituted 3/4 cup of butter.  I also added 3/4 cup of coconut as I am a big fan.  In addition I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and used the splenda-sugar mix. (which did leave a slight aftertaste, but not bad)

I will DEFINATELY make these again.  They are moist and chewy and chocolatey..YUM...Next time I will get almonds and try them......Great Recipe..Thanks!

These look like cookies but they taste like candy. They were very easy to make and turned out pretty good. After reading the previous reviews I decided to replace the 1/2-cup shortening with 3/4-cup butter. I also added walnuts which were really good.

These are great!  I too substituted the shortening with 3/4 cup margarine.  My kids are allergic to peanut butter, which so many non-bake cookies have, so I am happy to have this recipe.  Yummy and easy!

Best Macaroons ever. Creamy and chocolaty. I substituted the cocoa powder with chocolate  squares as I didn't have the powder at the time but I wasn't disappointed.

Make sure to boil the sugar, milk and butter mixture until it achieves the softball stage (when you drop some of the liquid into a cup of cold water and it holds a round shape).  Then the final product will hold together well.

Substituted 3/4 margarine for the shortening, used 1 cup of coconut and added a dash of vanilla. Boiled for 1 minute as suggested. Should have boiled them longer because of the high humidity level, they didn't set up right. But they taste good.

WAY too much cocoa powder for me. These were too sweet. Also, I used butter as suggested but 3/4 cup was too much. Overall, not my favorite.

AMAZING!!!  Just like the ones we made as kids.  Mmmmmm... Boil only 1 min, use 3/4 c butter, more coconut.  Little less cocoa (it's a bit rich).
PERFECTION: whole raw milk, 2 1/2 c coconut, 1 c ground oats, boil 1 minute, dash vanilla.

They came out pretty good. I added twice the coconut, I used butter, and used only 3/4 of the sugar. I still found them just a tad too sweet so I think next time I'll just use half the sugar.

Three of my favorite things: Chocolate, coconut and EASY!  Yummy and simple.  I used soy milk and soy margarine because I have a dairy allergy.  Oh...and I accidentally used 1/4 c of margarine instead of 1/2 and it was perfect!

Used 3/4 cup butter in place of shortening.  Boiled 1 1/2 minutes.  Used 2/3 cup of coconut.  Used old fashioned oats.  Great recipe! They turned out great!  Very quick to make!!  This is an 'ol family favorite, so will be nice to have this recipe on hand! thank you!

These were very delicious. Exactly what I had in mind when I went hunting for this recipe. I didn't want to use coconut so I just did an extra 1/2 cup of oats in exchange for the coconut, but I think for doing this, they turned out very crumbly and fall apart easily.

Like others, I used butter instead of shortening and added more coconut, and they were excellent. At least five people at work asked for the recipe. Incredibly simple and quick to make.

The first time I made these they came out great. PERFECT. The second time they wouldn't mix properly and all I got was chocolate granola. I believe I boiled the sugar/milk mixture too much. So be careful not to over do it!! My mother tells me to bring it to a boil three times, so I think I'll do that next time.

These macaroons have good potential.  Definitely needed to reheat the mixture with a little more milk in order to make them stick together better. If I use this recipe again I will be adding more than 3/4 cup of butter.

When I decided I was going to make these a few days ago, I read the reviews and was going to adjust like some said, but today I forgot. Still yummy, but I should have use 1 c coconut as I really like coconut and I am making them for a Hawaiian themed pot luck. They have been in the fridge 30 mins and I am wondering if they will be too sticky to bring with me. I hope not! (but honestly if they are, oh well, they taste so good they won't last too long here.) I didn't have enough cookies sheets to make them all at once, so I cleared off the bottom shelf of the fridge and used a board covered with parchment paper.

Quick and easy recipe. I substituted Splenda for the sugar as that's what I bake with and the end result was okay. I think I was expecting something more after reading the reviews. Nice one to have to make in a hurry.

I found this recipe to make very dry cookies.  Even while dropping them onto the waxed paper, they had a great tendancy to fall apart.  The flavor was good, but very very dry.
