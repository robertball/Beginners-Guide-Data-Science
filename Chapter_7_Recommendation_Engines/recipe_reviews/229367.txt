Delicious! A big hit with the entire family. I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted Greek yogurt and it was still wonderful!

Came out really tasty. I put the roast in at a higher temperature for the first 20 minutes to sear the outside and skipped the savory.

This was very good. I did not have ground savory, so I substituted 1/2 tsp marjoram. The meat was very tender. I only made 1/2 the amount of horseradish sauce because I knew my children would not like it, and I added a little extra horseradish because my husband & I both love it. Very simple to make.

The meat was very juicy. I used what ingredients I had on hand for the rub- no savory. Also had fresh thyme and rosemary available so placed those in the cast iron skillet. Last added 45 minutes to the time, must be mt oven, and had carrots, celery and onion on hand so placed them in the last 45 minutes.I didn't have the sour cream etc so served without, It was a hit with my husband and as leftovers was even better, I did cover it with foil while baking too!!

Terrific flavors combined to make this meal a tasty hit.  Forgot to add olive oil, but that didn't affect the overall flavor one bit.  Will make this again for sure.  Served with wilted kale and whole wheat bread for a well-rounded meal.

Used more rosemary and less pepper, but only because I like rosemary.  This is the second time I've rated and reviewed this, I think, and it is very flavorful and doesn't take 6 hours to get tender.  Very yummy!

This was okay...nothing extraordinary.  I wrapped it in foil, and wish I would've removed the foil for the last 15 minutes so the rub would've crisped.  I subbed sage for the savory & white pepper for the black (a little less, because I think white pepper is stronger).  Other than that, everything else was the same...the horseradish sauce was the best part...

I loved this roast. Mine came out rare, but I am fine with that. I didn't have savory, so I used thyme, and I thought I had mustard and I didn't, so I used cumin. Smelled good, tasted good, the horseradish sauce was AMAZING. Roommates were so jealous.

I made this tonight, and it was sooo tasty! I did add some salt to the herb rub but otherwise followed the recipe. I cooked it in the cast iron skillet with a lid. When I took it out, I thought it was going to be tough, but after letting it sit and cutting it, it was great! I wouldn’t say juicy, but not tough like I thought it might be. Flavors are excellent! Added a bit of gravy to it, had it with German potato dumplings and sautéed kale. Forgot to do the horseradish sauce this time. I’ll have to remember to make it for the leftovers.

My husband made this last night and it was great!  He had never made a chuck roast before - so we were a little nervous, but no problems.  He followed the recipe exactly and surrounded the roast with root vegetables - he made a little extra of the bread crumbs to sprinkle over the veggies.  Excellent!

Very good recipe. I made it with panko  bread crumbs , didn’t have savory but used rosemary and other Italian herbs.
The person who wrapped it in foil a and was  disappointed essentially made a pot roast, so that’s a different recipe altogether

Unless you like beef medium well, I’d reduce cooking time.  A 3.8 lb roast, surrounded by vegetables, with beef broth and foil cover, was very well done after 1 1/2 hours.

I did not have simple Savory, so I used an Italian spice blend that included it an Rosemary. Very good. I will use the lemon horseradish sauce for many things.
