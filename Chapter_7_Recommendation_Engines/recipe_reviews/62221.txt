I had to really work with this.  If prepared as the recipe stands it has a few problems, at least for me, but they were easily remedied. First, three serrano peppers is a LOT of peppers, particular if they happen to be really hot (mine were) - so I significantly cut back on them so that they acted more as seasoning, and I filled the gap with green bell pepper. Vegetable oil didn't appeal to me, nor did the ratio of vinegar to oil.  I used olive oil and white wine vinegar in a ratio of 3:1 instead. Finally, salt alone was not enough to season this, but again, it was easy enough to add some cumin and garlic powder. Kind of blah and too tangy as written, excellent (five stars in my view!) with a little tinkering.

This was great!  I have to say I didn't have serrano peppers, but I used chipotle instead and it was delicious.  I also added a green chile pepper, for color.  Thanks Lindalu!

So easy and delicious!  I didnâ€™t have fresh tomatoes so used one can Rotel and one can no salt diced tomatoes, both drained.  I served it with avocado slices and a spoonful of sour cream on top!  We are limiting meat so this was a great main dish along with a green salad, and the second night I served it on top of the greens.  Thanks for sharing!

The husband and I love this dish. We make all the time. The flavors are fresh and tangy. You can make it super hot for the spicy lovers or you can tone it down for the tender tongues. I top the salad with cilantro.

I make a salad very similar to this, only it includes corn kernels, green onions and cilantro also. It is also lower fat as it only has lemon or lime juice, no oil.

loved this exactly as written. made it to take to my mother-in-law's house and had to fight the urge to eat half of it before leaving. the kids weren't wild about it, obviously, but the grownups literally cleaned out the bowl with hunks of bread.

I really love this recipe - my husband's grandma makes something just like it and I keep forgetting to ask for her recipe.  I like the plain oil and vinegar a little more than the prepared salad dressing on some of the other recipes.

The ingredients in this salad were a really wonderful blend with the EXCEPTION of the vinegar...the vinegar was so overpowering that it was borderline impossible to enjoy the dish overall!

I love this salad.  It is fresh tasting and healthy and makes a great side dish.  It's a unique way of using beans if you're not in the mood for baked beans, etc.  I like the tanginess of the tomato and vinegar.

I added some habeneros for a bit more kick and substituted a splash of sesame oil for one of the vegetable oil Tbsp. Tasted fresh and full.

Perfect salad for a really hot day. We hit 93 today ( Washington State) and we're not used to heat. Perfect combo with the vinegar and chili. Went fantastically with a side of fresh crab and Penn Cove Mussels. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellent.  The 3 serrano peppers were just fine for my taste.  Used red wine vinegar because I was out of white wine vinegar and it still came out delicious.

I made not quite half a recipe (used only 1 can of beans) and we did not care for this.  The vinegar didn't seem to work with the spicy peppers.  Oh well, thanks for the recipe anyway.
