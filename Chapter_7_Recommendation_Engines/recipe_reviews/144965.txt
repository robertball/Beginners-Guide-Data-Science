Didn't seem thick enough to torte so I double the shortcake batter and baked two 9" cakes. I trimmed the tops so the strawberries/juices could soak into the cake faster! Delicious!

This was a big hit! The shortcake is easy and delcious and there is no need to double the recipe. Instead of boxed pudding I used the Creamy Vanilla Pudding off this site and it was gorgeous and delcious!

Fantastic.  So much better than regular shortcake.  I used the Jiffy all purpose baking mix.  It is a satisfying dessert yet you dont have to feel as guilty.  I will also try with peaches.Thanks for the great recipe.  This has already become a regular.

Turned out BEAUTIFUL and tasted delicious.  I don't understand why everyone is saying it's to thing to split??  Mine baked up rather tall.  I used Cool Whip Lite and Bisquick baking mix.  Will make again and again and I will try it with different fruits.

I give this 5 stars on taste.  But 3 or 4 stars on presentation.  It may have been my fault but the whole thing fell apart and looked a mess.  But, it still tasted wonderful.

I made this recipe as stated, except that I used an 8" cake pan instead of 9", since others said the shortcake was too thin to split into layers.  I baked it at 400 for 15-17 minutes until golden.  It was very easy to split.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was the shortcake itself -- I liked it on its own, but when mixed with the fruit and cream, it seemed stale and ... salty?  It just didn't do anything for me, and seemed kind of out of place.  My 2 brothers agreed, and we all pushed the cake to the side and gobbled up the strawberries and cream on their own.  My mom was the only one who thought it was perfect, though she admits that she hates other shortcakes made with sponge or angel food cake.  Either way, I certainly would not double the shortcake recipe!  It doesn't seem like much, but there really was plenty.

Would be much better with something besides instant pudding. ALL FLAVORS of instant pudding taste so artificial.

I’m no master in the kitchen and usually massacre anything and everything I try out… This was easy and came out perfect! Everyone loved it and I can’t wait to make it again.

I agree with the other person.  This was a little too crumbly and I had to make two batches. One was just not enough.  And I followed the recipe exactly. 
The overall taste was good, so I have to give it 4 stars.

The pudding layer and strawberries are the best part of this recipe.  I would not use the baking powder mix for the cake layer.  I made this recipe exactly as stated, using Jiffy Baking mix for the all-purpose mix.  It was salty and thick.  I will try a cake mix instead next time.

It was good, but I guess I was expecing more.  The "cake" part was a little over-powering, and it just had a "blah" taste to it.  Probably will not make again, but thanks for posting.
