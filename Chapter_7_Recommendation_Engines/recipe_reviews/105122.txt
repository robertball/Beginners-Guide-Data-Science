This was good.  I couldn't find frozen lime drink mix, so I used 1/3 of a cup of limeade beverage and added one fresh squeezed lemon.  The poaching liquid makes a nice sauce over vegetables served with the mahi mahi.

This was the recipe I had been searching for!  Just follow the recipe, don't overcook the fish and it comes out wonderful!  I made it with the garlic asparagus and a box of garlic white and wild rice, delicious! Family loved it, will make again and again!

I didn't have frozen used liquid mix. I also used cajun spice instead of just cayenne pepper. And to accent the lime, when I covered the dish to poach I added a few slices of lime to the dish. It turned out excellent.

This recipe is very tasty, although, I found Mahi Mahi is a bit overpowering for the delicate flavor of the sauce. Tilapia works MUCH better. I give this 4 stars since it is intended it to be for Mahi, but I've done it with Tilapia and it is EXCELLENT. Also, to make it even more flavorful, I used Mrs. Dash Southwestern Chipotle seasoning in place of cayenne.

Fantastic & simple recipe.  Comes out very moist.  If cooking, be sure you factor in the lengthy cooking time of the brown rice.  The cayenne gives it a good amount of kick w/ that heat, so rub-to-taste when starting out.

Delicious! Only used half the cayenne, and added a bit of cumin and cilantro.

This was good! I felt the lime flavor was a nice "light" flavor for such a heavy fish. We used crushed red pepper in absene of cayenne - my husband wanted more pepper and more sauce! I also topped with lime slices and cherry halves to add color.

Just made this tonite, and it was very good!  I liked the little kick the cayenne gave with the tangyness of the lime.  I fried up whole trout instead of mahi mahi. Thank you for a nice change.

The lime sauce is so good over the rice. My husband is picky about seafood and he said this was great. I will make this over and over.

Very easy.  My husband loved it.  Will "cool" it a bit with the cayenne pepper, a little too hot for him.  But it was easy and so good!
