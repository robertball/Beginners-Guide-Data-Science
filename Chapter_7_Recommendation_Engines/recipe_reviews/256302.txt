This is comfort food. I don't know in which cuisine but somewhere this is just all those right flavors that hug you and make you feel at home. We added red bell peppers, bean sprouts, and a handful of fresh hot peppers. It cooks up exactly as written. The sauce is thick and rich with the tomato popping out and stealing the show. I was able to feed a family of five with this by simply adding extra noodles. The sauce is enough for five as written. Thank you for the recipe.

This dish was very tasty and my boyfriend raved about it. The only changes I made were cutting the soy sauce to 1/3 cup, the sugar to 1/4 cup (I used raw sugar), and leaving out the tomatoes and green onions. I still only used half of the entire sauce in my pan. I will save the other half to make it again. This one's a keeper!

Substituted beef which is what I had on hand.  The family says, do this again which is how I rate my recipes.

This ended up tasting pretty awful.   The diced tomatoes don't really mix and it really didn't go at all with the recipie.    I'm not sure exactly what to change here, but this didn't work, or my palette doesnt agree with it. 

We ate it because I didn't want to make anything else... otherwise I would have tossed it.

This was very good but too salty, even using low sodium soy sauce.  I will add water next time.

The sauce steals the dinner, but makes a lot! Next time, Iâ€™ll use less say sauce and honey (which I substituted for brown sugar). We lessened the bok choy and doubled the noodles. Pretty good dinner.

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the tomatoes worked in this dish.  I did cut the sugar by half, reduced the soy sauce a bit, and omitted the garlic, and this was still good!

Did not have any brown sugar so just used regular and It was delicious, it also has an attractive presentation. I will make again. This was the first time I used rice noodles and lived the light taste and that it was a healthy meal.

This recipe is fantastic! It made more sauce than needed for 8oz of rice noodles, so next time I'll either add more veggies or cut back on the soy sauce a bit. Delicious!

This dish was delicious! I added bean sprouts, yellow bell pepper, and cilantro. I omitted the tomatoes, but did add extra red pepper flakes & ginger. I will definitely make this again.
