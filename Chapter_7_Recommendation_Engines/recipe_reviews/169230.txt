I did a few things differently, but this was a very refreshing recipe.  I also added the mint sauce to my rice, it was excellent!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I wasn't sure how to use up some extra figs I had on hand, and was nervous to try and make a sauce with them on my own without any directions. I didn't have mint on hand, or time to marinade ahead of time, and it still came out great. I also cooked it all on the stove. I will make this again. Thanks!

Delicious and easy. I grilled the pork in a pan since I don't have a BBQ and it still came out great.

Tasty way to cook pork with a fresh sauce.  I added  2 T balsamic vinegar to the marinade as well to help tenderize the meat.  I also cooked the meat in the oven for 35 minutes since I don't have a grill.  Best part of this recipe is the fig-mint sauce.

Tried it this evening and it was a smash! Used a pork tenderloin sliced into medallions, worked like a dream.
