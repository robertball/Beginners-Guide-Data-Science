Overall, these did not rise as high as another recipe I use and they were a bit leaden. The other recipe I use of consists of the same ingredients and amounts, but, the pan is preheated in a 450 oven, then the batter is added, then they are baked for 15-20 minutes at 450, lower the temp to 375, then bake for 15-20 minutes more.  You won't believe the difference, they are super super high, light, crispy yet fluffy.

This was a great recipie.  I did not have a popover pan so just used a muffin tin.. it worked great.  I did preheat the pan, as that is what mamma used to do when she made popovers.  They turned out great so I took a photo of them.  Everyone liked them too.

wonderful popover recipe! a few minor modifications: melted a dime-sized amount of butter in each popover cup in 450 degree oven for 2 min prior to pouring batter into cups (watch close and don't let it burn!). also baked for 15 min at 450 degrees then 375 for 15 minutes per another review's suggestion. also important: do NOT open the oven while baking! turn on the oven light if you must but do NOT open the oven door!!these turned out crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside! can't wait to make them again!

After making a lot of hockey pucks, I finally got this down. Let your all of your ingredients get to room temp first. Place oven rack on top shelf, place green olive size chunks of butter in bottom of muffin tins then preheat the tin in the oven to allow the butter to melt. After 20 minutes, reduce heat and cook only 5-10 minutes longer.

This is my family's traditional recipe - and I use 100 year old pans.  The recipe is very dependent on the oven. The expansion is based on quickly cooking the top, which captures the steam.  With a quickly heating oven, a cool pan and oven work well - the top seals while the pan is still cool.  If the oven is slow to heat, the pan and the oven will need to be preheated, and they might not pop quite as high.

These are the most delicioius, wonderful, fabulous, great, magnificen, yummy, excellent, cool, extraordinary popevers I have ever tasted. They have become a great tradition in our family and we have them instead of birthday cake for all the children's birthdays! They taste excellent with frosting and are my little Danny's favorite.

The taste was ok but somewhat "eggy". I was excited when I first looked into the oven and saw how high the dough had risen but by the time I looked again they had deflated and stayed that way :(

These get rave reviews every time I make them. I've even had them described to me as "heavenly". And the recipe is so simple even I can recall it without having to constantly check the computer screen.

Very delicious. They were quickly made, and our mom really liked them! They did turn out slightly crunchy, but on the inside they were very soft. Probably a mistake on our end. Nice work!

I made mine sweet like an after dinner popover....I thought the  batter was absolutely runny.I followed steps to a  tee , saying that i added a half a cup of flour couple dashes of cinnamon and some vanilla extract ....tasted it and it still needed something so i added about a cup of brown sugar  they turned out so delicious moist and light and sweet (not too sweet) . ill definitely use my spin off on this,  delicious  popper!!!!!!

These are great!!  I love the light eggy flavor to them.  I just did a mini-batch to try them for the first time and a neighbor happen to be over borrowing a tool of my husband's when I took them out of the oven and he at two and said they were great.  I only rank the recipe 4-stars because I followed the advise of one of the other reviewers and preheated the oven to 450 as well as the pan.  The cooking time was then a little less about 15 minutes at 450 then another 10 at 350...but I was using a muffin pan, not a popover pan.  Thanks for sharing.

These were just alright.  I did preheat the pan with a little butter.  They didn't rise like my mom's popovers.  She's gone so I cannot ask her advice.  I will, however, try again and this time bring the milk and eggs to room temperature first.  Maybe that will help.

Loved these-accidentally made easier! Mix batter, spray cold muffin tin with pam, put pat of butter in each of 8-9 cups, then pour batter right over butter to half full. Bake at 450 for 15 mins, then 375 for 10 to 15 or until as browned as u like. The butter melts and rises to surface as it bakes, just like when you melt it first.  These were just right, brown and a bit crisp on outside, soft and tender on inside.

This is the Best recipe I have used. I tried lisa910 recipe with pre heating the pans and lowering the temp after 20min and they didn't rise as high as this recipe.  This is a 5 star recipe to me!! Love it  I Wouldn't Change A Thing!!

I baked them in a preheated oven 450 degrees , I used Potato flour and tapioca flour, and this wasn't quite perfect. I am going to try again with a different blend. They raised perfectly and had the hollow center, very good appearance!

I made these twice. First time with just a muffin time...good flavor but very little puff. So..I bought a popover pan and success! Tall beautiful popovers. I’m in love!
Not too eggy, just right!

Great recipe! I stirred in some oregano to make ours herb-flavored. Tasty!
