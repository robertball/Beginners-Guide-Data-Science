I'm the person who submitted this recipe.  A bad habit that I picked up from my mom is that I never measure anything when I'm cooking.  So having never measured anything, I had to estimate ingredient quantities.  Well this New Years I decided to make the recipe as submitted.  It seems I drastically under estimated the quantity of apple cider that's in the sauerkraut mixture.  It should be 1/2 to 3/4 cups of cider.  And even with that amount I had to add more halfway through baking.

i halved the recipe due  to the size of the roast. i forgot the brown sugar and didn't have thai seasonings. i discovered i had no apple cider, so after asking on the buzz i got an excellent sub--apple sauce. it cooked @ 2 1/2 hours. it didn't look pretty but it sure did taste good!

What a great way to start the New Year!  I omitted the Thai seasoning from the rub and the brown sugar from the sauerkraut, but followed everything else.  Delicious!  My only regret is you don't get any gravy.  But the meat is tender and very flavorful.  I'll have to get up early and make rye bread for roast pork sandwiches.  Thank you, Kehl Berry.

I made this according to the recipe w/o changes and it turned out well. I did cut it in half, the only change I made. Like other reviewers I didn't have any Thai seasoning but I found a couple of recipes online for Thai seasoning so I made some . The Thai seasoning does add to the dish but it wasn't spicy hot. 
A good pork roast with apples and kraut, what is not to like. Cheers.

I am making this again for dinner tonight.  It came out so delicious the first time, I saved it to my recipe box. Didn't use the Thai seasoning, just seasoned salt.  I also didn't have Apple Cider so I watered down some Apple cider vinegar.  It was perfect!

This was one of the worst recipes I have ever used for cooking pork with sauerkraut.  The roast was not very tender and my family did not like the flavor.  I will not make this again.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of cutting it by half due to the amount of portions wanted. The dish was easy to put to put together. The only problem I had was that I needed to add more liquid about half way through cooking cycle to keep it from drying out. I added more apple cider as needed. The end result was a delicious meal. I will definitely make this again.

Due to a lack of Thai Seasonings I substituted a garam marsala mixture with coriander I had lying around.  This was incredible.  Everything pulls together well and obviously very versatile.  Definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I was a little bit leary,  because it seems I have tried other recipes in the past and sometimes the pork is not done or overdone. In this case it was just perfect.  I followed the recipe except for maybe changing some of the seasonings, and the family was very happy.

Very good recipe.  Unless pork loin is on sale, use boneless country style ribs which are essentially just a pork shoulder/ pork butt sliced.  Bone-in works just fine. You can also use a slow cooker or braise on top of the stove in a dutch oven.  The aromas you will experience will make your mouth water.

Did not have apple cider so I used apple juice.  The only other change was adding carrots.  It was very tasty and I was happy to freeze the leftover for another meal.  Good recipe.

Very delicious!  I used less sauerkraut and added more cider as needed.  I served it with mashed potatoes, and the left overs were even tastier!

I made this for dinner and it was delicious.  I didnâ€™t have apple cider so I substituted a 1/4 cp of cider vinegar to 3/4  cp water   Which worked well.  And instead of cooking it in my oven I cooked it on my outdoor grill using indirect heat.  My husband loved it

I made it by the recipe.  The meat was very tender but the sides with it were too strong for my tastebuds.  My husband enjoyed it. I feel it would have been more palatable with a fattier portion of pork. The kraut was too strong cooked.

Love the sweet and sour kraut. Kept adding apple cider during cooking if the kraut was drying out. Whip up some redskin mashed and youâ€™re in heaven!

This was very good.  The vinegar and brown sugar truly added a special taste.  However I feel it was a bit dry and added some water to moisten and create more juice.

Great recipe, I used pork chops and threw in some high end hot dogs for the kids. Slow cooked it all day in the oven and served over mashed potatoes with crunchie Italuan bread while binging on football. Perfect for New Years Day! Add liquid if it dries out...left overs are excellent too!!

Very very good.   The butt pork roast is the best cut for tenderness and sauerkraut.   Our friends also enjoyed it.

Exceptional dish. Thai seasoning, whatever that is, not found in my area. I used a mix of cumin, paprika and Sazon, a Hispanic spice mix common in Florida. Otherwise followed exactly. This is, I think,one of the best main dishes Iâ€™ve ever made and it will appear on my table again. Great company dinner.

Followed recipe except for quantity of sauerkraut.  Used 48 ounces instead of (3) 32 oz. containers.  That was plenty.

It turned out great.  I used my Ninja all in one instead of putting it in the oven.  Very tender but not as flavorful as I had hoped.

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have the thai spice or the caraway seeds so I used fajita seasoning to rub the meat in. Definitely stick with granny smith apples since they're not too sweet. Doing mashed potatoes and applesauce as sides makes it a great German meal!

I halved the recipe because my tenderloin was only 2 1/2 lbs.  I used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, eliminated the Caraway seeds because my mom has diverticulitis and made my own Thai seasoning. This was very good. My husband dug in for seconds.

This was delicious!  Will definitely make it again.  I also had trouble finding Thai seasoning so I left it out.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  The whole family loved it.  I served it with potato latkes, apple sauce, and roasted brussel sprouts.

Did it exactly as directed and my whole family wants it again.  It was so good.  We love the sauerkraut with the apples and will make it that way with other things too.

It was fabulous, especially after the flavors were allowed to chill for a few days in the fridge! I'm diabetic, so I prefer my saurkraut a little less sweet and a little more pickly. For that reason, I replaced the apple cider with the saurkraut juices. I didn't have caraway seeds so used about 8 whole cloves, which also helped to replace the missing cider flavor. Also, the ham was the spiral sliced honey-baked ham leftover from Easter, so it was fully cooked and ready to go. I put all ingredients in a large pot, brought it to a boil, turned the heat down to medium-low and let it simmer for about 45 minutes. I served it with garlic and herb mashed potatoes and seasoned carrots. Fabulous! Thank you for sharing!

Like most, I changed it a bit.  Not a fan of Thai seasoning so I bought a pork loin with applewood bacon on it.  Great combo!

The flavors in this dish were the bomb! I tried to stick as close to the recipe as possible. Unfortunately you can't find Thai spice in El Paso Texas. So I bought the ingredients separately.I blended the lemon grass and the other ingredients found in the Thai spice recipe. Then I marinated the pork loin in the juice  for 2 days. In the future I will reduce the amount of sauerkraut.  I placed the marinade ingredients on the bottom of the pan and then placed the pork loin on the marinade. Then I added the sauerkraut and the rest of the ingredients. And cooked for three hours without basting. Wow!!! The flavors were exotic  and the meat so tender and full of flavor.  I also made a sauce. With brown sugar, brown mustard, Worcestershire, and two drops of hot chili oil. Then I drizzled that on the meat.  In the mashed potato's I made a sauce from sour cream, butter,brown sugar, and a splash of milk. Then I blended that into the potato's. In the apple sauce I mixed a can of fruit cocktail,chocolate oven roasted almonds, and ground organic flax seed. Then I chilled it in the fridge. It was the perfect compliment to the hot dishes.

I did this in a crock pot and I thoroughly enjoyed it. didn't use Thai seasoning either. this is definitely good but the best pork loin recipe is a recipe called honey pork loin. type this in and you will find it. pork loin is delicious and very versatile.

I'm not german, and have never had this dish before so I have no baseline for what a great pork and sauerkraut should taste like. This was tasty but not mind blowing. I'd make it again for tradition's sake, but I wouldn't make it throughout the year. I don't know how I should rate it.

If there were more stars available, I would certainly light them up as well!
I made this for a church group.  Within the last week, I have had 3 people ask for the recipe.  It smelled so good, i bought another [or roast for my own family for this weekeend.

So good! Fennel seeds instead of caraway seeds added just the right addition of spice

I didn't submit this recipe but I think the Thai Seasoning is from World Market.  It's amazing and I use it for many things.  I'll try to post a picture of it.

It turned out great, I had to downsize by half as I am living alone working out of state. Half of everything was more than enough. Had to be creative and make my own version of Thai seasoning and found plenty of recipes just for it on-line, thus avoiding ordering the Thai seasoning directly.

Very good! I used sliced pork loin and decrease cooking time to 1/2 hour. I did not have the caraway seeds or the Ti seasoning so I used Sesame garlic sauce. Pork was very juicy and favorable. The sour kraut was. very start so I might use less apple cider vinegar. Overall very tasty. Husband had thirds!

I had a recipe most similar to this from years ago, minus the Thai seasoning.  It is delicious and smells superb when it's baking.
