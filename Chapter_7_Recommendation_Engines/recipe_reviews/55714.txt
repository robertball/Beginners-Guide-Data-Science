This is a very simple and healthy Asian style eggdrop chicken soup.  It was suprisingly flavorful and yummy!  I doubled the chicken to 2 chicken breasts and added 2 more cups of chicken broth to balance out the tofu.  One package of tofu makes many, many 1/2 inch cubes!  Also, my picky husband does not like tofu, but he actually enjoyed this dish AND asked for more!

One word - delicious! And so easy to make.  My picky four year old lapped it up.  My baby daughter was slurping the soup and drinking it up.

This is a very flavorful soup, especially for cold winter days.  It is filling for a soup which is a plus.  I personally like the proportion of tofu to chicken (I like tofu).  I will definitely keep this recipe.

A lot of preparation goes into this dish of soup but it is really hearty.  My husband loved it, my baby loved it, and I loved it.  It was worth the prep time.

Very tasty.  Kind of a cross between egg drop soup and chicken soup.  Doesn't freeze well.

My husband keeps asking me to make this again. It wasn't hard to do. Simple recipe comes out good.
