I made no changes to the recipe and everyone liked it!  It was a little sweet for me so I may cut the sugar back just a bit otherwise I will be making it again!

We will definitely make it again! My son and husband who aren t big salad eaters both took seconds. We put it over spinach bacon and hard boiled eggs. Delicious

I had some fresh dandelion that I was going to make with hot bacon dressing.. then discovered I had no bacon... I made the recipe as is.. it is delicious... never missed the bacon.

Just made this and it was amazing!!! I have extra and I’m going to add some cayenne pepper and garlic powder to it, with a tad more lemon juice and use it to marinate the pork chops we’re grilling this evening.

This dressing is amaazzinnnggg. I used dijon mustard and 1/4 cup of sugar so this is a little less sweet and vegan. Highly recommend!
