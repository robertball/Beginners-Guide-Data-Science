Excellent!  Better than I've had in restaurants.  Hubby LOVED it.  My only slight changes:  I added a little more garlic; I used a little less parsley; I didn't use any extra salt; I added a little squirt of lemon juice and some black pepper and red pepper flakes for a little kick.  It was awesome!

I used this recipe as a base and created my own dish (as others did).  I used 1/2 stick butter and a drizzle of olive oil, threw in 6 cloves of minced garlic & let it saute a few, added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and let that toast a minute (next time I will add even more), next the wine & let that reduce a minute or two before adding the clam juice and then the juice of half a lemon.  The other changes I made: I cooked the pasta a minute or two short and finished cooking it in the clam broth and didn't add the parsley (less than called for) til the last minute.  I served it with french bread with butter and a delicious riesling.  So good I'm gonna go have my second serving right now!

I made this recipe for my mother for Mother's Day and she loved it. She said it was better than any she has had at any restaurant. I did take others suggestions and used 4 cloves of garlic, 2/3 cup of white wine, half of a lemon (squeezed), pepper and red pepper. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I eat this all the time, the only thing I do differently is in a saucepan I melt half a stick of butter and place the garlic on that cooking on low. And due to this variation I cut back on the olive oil just using a drizzle. Perfect everytime---

Very easy to make and delicious.  Just to take the bite out of the clam (which can be a little fishy) I squeezed 1/2 of a lemon into the sauce after letting it simmer for 10 minutes.  I actually made this 3 times already and I have gotten raves. 
A good recipe to have when you want to make a quick, light dinner.

To make this recipe more authentic add more fresh sliced garlic.  Also, more white wine another can of clams.  Do not cook the clams....just add into the turned off broth.  Just before draining the pasta (al dente, please!), reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. Just before serving,add the pasta water little by little in order to get the right consistency.  This dish should not be dry.  Sprinkle with parsley and a good grated cheese.  Now you have a good dish!!

This has always been favorite dish at Italian restaurants so I wanted to try to make it at home. After browsing the various recipies, I realize the dish I order is probably loaded with butter and not very healthy. :(  So I tried this recipie instead without very high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised at how close it comes to restaurant quality.  I would definitely make it again, as I probably will not be ordering the full-fat kind very often anymore.

Very flavorful and light, perfect for a summer dinner.  My 2 year old gobbled it up too!  I added a touch of white wine to the sauteeing garlic and butter/oil and juice from half a lemon.  Yum!

My family of 6 raved over this recipe (even the 3 year old!).  I used 4 cloves of garlic, a pinch of red pepper and a squirt of lemon juice.  Leftovers were great too.  Thank you very much!

This is a really good, fast and economical recipe. Like others I added fresh lemon juice and crushed red pepper flakes for more kick and I added fresh spinach to make it a one pot meal. Yum!

This was such an easy dish to make and it was delicious.  I've made it twice so far and both times everyone loved this dish.  I added a little more white wine and 4-6oz. cans of clams in place of the 3-8oz in the recipe.

Economical, healthy, and tasty. Oh, and so quick / easy! I upped the white wine to about half a cup, added a liberal amount of lemon juice, and some powdered onion. Simple and good. I think next time, I'll grate a little lemon peel into the wine reduction to give it more of a standout lemony flavor. (I love lemon in seafood.) Served with garlic bread and the rest of the wine I bought for the recipe. It'd be a shame to let it go to waste. ;) Thank you for sharing!

Husband said this was restaurant quality.  Only thing I did differently was to add a handfull of chopped mushrooms, an onion, and a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil.  Great.

My hubby and I made this last night and it was soooooooo good!  It is my new favorite meal.  I did double the garlic.  It probably wouldn't bother me to triple it.  This a KEEPER!  Thanks Karena for a GREAT recipe!

I had to add some corn starch/milk mixture to thicken up the sauce...and I used too much garlic!! (I used 3 cloves). But, WHEN I make it again, I'll go a bit easier on the garlic...no big deal! *Even my 2 year old enjoyed it!!

Good 'guini! I've been making my own version for years, but thought I'd try a different version such as this. And as with another reviewer, I tempered it a bit with 1/2 the juice of a lemon to tone down some of the clam juice as well as use 6 cloves of garlic. Thanks for sharing Karena!

I have to say that this was fantastic. I had 10 real clams that I used, and I added a cup of white dry wine also to it. The dish came out phenomenal, as if I were in my favorite park slope italian restaurant! What a dish. my husband raved. Will definitely do again!

Pretty good and easy to make, next time I will try it with the lemon juice as suggested by other reviewers. Update: I have made this again with the lemon and it makes all the difference in this dish.  Fresh is always better but I have used bottled lemon in a pinch as well.

This recipe was a bit bland as is.  But we added some pesto sauce and coarse ground black pepper to jazz it up.  The pesto sauce did not overpower the delicate flavors.  It was a hit with our family.

Lackluster... this dish actually sounds a lot better than it tastes.  It needs some added flavor.  I introduced a bit of lemon grass and fresh dill, along with a splash of fresh lemon juice, but it was still lacking.  This recipe is for those who prefer their cuisine on the bland side.

Delicious!  However, to make it work with a full 12-16 oz package of linguine, I would make more sauce next time. But the sauce recipe itself is perfect for our tastes!  We just like a little more sauce on pasta.  I also used 2 (6.5 oz) cans minced clams and 2 (6.5 oz) cans chopped clams because the grocery store only had two cans of minced left.  I thought it was a nice mix.  I can't wait to make this again!

Perfect! The only thing I changed is I used 3 cans of chopped clams instead of minced and I added 4 tbsp of butter. My 11 yr. olds both had seconds which never happens.

this was so light and delicious.. i scaled it down to what would have been the equivalent for 2.5 servings and used what i had on hand.. which was 6 oz angel hair pasta, two 6.5 oz cans minced clams w/juice, 2 T of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of the jarred garlic, a little more than 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro, 1 T white wine, 1/2 t of dried basil, and 1/4 t of salt.. added 5 oz of slice white mushrooms, a shake or two of crushed red pepper and a tiny bit of lime juice (would have used lemon if i had it).. cooked the mushrooms and garlic in olive oil until soft and then deglazed the pan with the wine.. after that, added all the other components.. this dish totally worked for us.. we enjoyed with some buttered french bread.. ty so much for the recipe

I made the mistake of following the recipe exactly and the dish came out too salty.  I guess it was my fault for blindly following the original recipe.  I will try it again in the future with no added salt.

My father is a 'linguini with white clam sauce' connoisseur and though this was great.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and we served it with a few fresh clams for looks.

Excellent!  This recipe claims to make 5 servings, but if this is accurate, they are 5 HUGE servings.  I have to point out that while this recipe is certainly not low fat, it's about half of the fat of other Clam Linguine recipes....and tastes amazing.

As suggested, I also added 2 more cloves of garlic and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon............  All I can say is FANTASTIC!  Definitely better than most restaurants-will make on a regular basis because it is also soooooo eeeeasy!

This was delicious and so easy to make.  Very light and loved that no butter was involved.  I added red pepper flakes for a kick, but otherwise followed exactly.

Drank all the wine a couple nights ago, so used some American Lager instead. Used 6 cloves garlic cause I love garlic! I also added some very large seared scallops as a topping to the mound of pasta on my plate! AWESOME!

Delicious.  Simple.  I added more garlic, 3 cloves, and put it on tortellini, but have no doubt it would still be good with less garlic and of course any pasta you want to use.  I served it at a pasta party and everyone loved it.  It has become a family favorite that I make often, and when I don't have fresh parsley on hand I use dried - still great.

I've had this recipe saved for a while and finally made it today. I cut the servings back to 2 , used butter instead of oil and used two cloves of garlic, we love garlic!  I cooked the pasta for 8 minutes and then scooped it into the skillet to finish cooking, this allows the pasta to absorb the flavour of the clams. After tasting I thought that it needed some acid so I added some freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Overall a good recipe and one that I will make again.

I made this recipe for a visiting friend who makes a wonderful clam sauce linguini herself. She raved over it, and we both thought it was delicious. This was the first time I had ever tried a linguini with clam sauce recipe, and I followed the instructions exactly, except that I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Since there were only 2 of us, I used only half a package of linguini noodles, which was exactly the right amount. I also used Bar Harbor Sea Clams, which are larger and more tender than some other minced clam brands. **Tip from my friend: after you add the garlic to the heated oil, let it simmer for a minute or two, then turn the stovetop setting down to 1 and you can leave the garlic and oil for up to half an hour to have a pre-dinner glass of wine or tend to guests before adding in the clam juice and other ingredients.** Thank you Karena for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Next time will add a little crushed red pepper to give a little kick.  Otherwise, delicious and EASY!

Used just under 1/3 c olive oil to cook the garlic. Added 2 bottles clam juice and 2 packages frozen mussels. 4 T white wine.

I mostly followed the recipe but added a few items at other reviewer's suggestions.  I sauteed about 1/2 C chopped onion along with 6 cloves garlic.  After sauteeing, I added to the sauce mixture 2/3 C white wine, 1 TBL lemon juice, ~1/2 tsp lemon pepper,  and 1/3 tsp red pepper flakes in addition to the original recipe's ingredients.  I also saved 1 C of the pasta water to add to the pasta/sauce mix, if needed.  I made a full recipe of the sauce and used 8 oz. linguine noodles.  We both loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.  We served it with fresh french bread and mixed salad greens.

I added 2 cans of chopped clams, 1 cup of clam juice, and pecorino romano cheese sprinkled on top. I left out the wine.

This recipe is easy and delicious!  I added more white wine - because , why not?  I also put in a bit more garlic and   I used 1 can of minced clams and 1 can of chopped clams.  I also used butter and a smidge of olive oil to sauté.  Like another reviewer, I added all the pasta to the sauce for the last 2 minutes to absorb some of the sauce into the noodles.  It’s excellent!!

A good, easy clam sauce receipe. I would recommend doubling the garlic and adding some lemon.

This was easy to make and delicious! Can't say I have had any better in a restaurant. I made slight variations such as more butter, less olive oil, more wine and addition of lemon juice. I feel that this recipe is a great base to work with and can make adjustments to taste. Will be making this a lot more.

Bland.  Next time, will up the garlic, add some red pepper with a pinch of basil and oregano.  Other than that, it was an OK recipe.

Fantastic!  I added a heaping tablespoon garlic, about a half cup of wine, and skipped the dried basil. Thought it would be too dry, but not at all. Plenty of juice in the clam cans. Fast, easy, delicious!

I added more garlic and also red pepper flakes. And since I didn't have fresh parsley, I used dried, about 3 tablespoons.

I made this with the changes of the 4th review. I added butter and red pepper flakes and it turned out amazing! Of coarse it's the basic sauce but you can always add whatever you want. Everyone loved it and will always make this

I really liked this, as it was easy to make and my family liked it as well. I love that there are lots of clams in this! I added a little pepper and about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

I loved it!  Better than a restaurant. No real changes. I used jar of baby clams from a local italian grocery store to avoid the tin can taste.

Like others, used 4 cloves of garlic, juice of half a lemon when adding clams.  Also added  a half stick of unsalted butter and used 4 6.5 oz. cans.  Cooked sauce about 12 minutes to reduce the extra liquid before adding clams.  Next time I'll cut back on the salt because my wife and I both thought it a bit on the salty side.

I made this for dinner tonight and i loved the simplicity of the recipe.  I was pressed for time but was able to finish making  the meal within 25 min.  I don't cook often and if took me 25 min, then I'm sure those who are more familiar with cooking will take less time.  The guests enjoyed the meal and I really liked the video that came along with the recipe!

It is pasta tossed in a white clam sauce that is made with garlic, clams, parsley, white wine, basil, and seasonings. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is to add a diced tomato and a handful of baby spinach. Sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top for garnish.

This is the original italian clam sauce recipe.  Anything else are adaptations to this recipe.  Guys and Girls, when you make this one, you are in Italy.  That is all I can say.

My family loved it! They said it's a "keeper." I doubled the garlic, and used a bit more clams, as I was trying to use up a large 32-oz can we had purchased by mistake when we thought we were buying clam juice.

Fabulous! I cut back on the oil some & used quite a bit more wine...I just reduced it down by half. I didn't add all of the pasta either...there wouldn't have been enough sauce, I don't think. I also added the juice from half a lemon when I added the clams & topped the dish w/ some romano cheese. Served it w/ Seafood Stuffed Avocado (from this site) as an appetizer.
