Followed the recipe!  Turned out great!   I put in 3 onions because that's what the recipe called for but when I added the chicken bullion, I wondered if there should have been another onion, and I think that would have worked well.  Maybe they were smaller onions!    It's a hit; definitely make it again!

FABULOUS!  ALTHOUGH, I  must say that I didn't have white wine, only Red, so I used red and it was a. very hearty soup
with a dark color and went supremely well with the melted gruyere and the toasted rounds in the soup.  oooh la la

A delicious and elegant soup!  Our daughter even took pictures and put it on face book.  It's not an "every day" soup like chicken noodle or tomato... it's special.
