This was delicious! I made it per the recipe with no changes except I didn't garnish with cilantro. So many flavors! This is a keeper :-)

Make something very similar to this, however I add a cup of sweet corn and one avocado mixed in at the end.

I used canned chilies instead of jalapenos because that's what I had and I'm scared of jalapenos anyway.  I had to leave out the garlic because I live with a vampire.  This is good.  I will probably make it again, but I don't think I'll necessarily add it to the "regular rotation".

Great recipe that received lots of comments when we brought it over to a potluck dinner-definitely no leftovers! The only change we made was to use a yellow bell pepper instead of green just due to personal preference. Will be making again!

I overlooked the food processor instructions and just mixed it.  The flavors are awesome.  And it's just nice to look at!  I garnished it with a few slices of lime.  Good hot or warm.

Yummy.  I used scallions instead of red onion, a red bell pepper instead of green, and roasted one ear's worth of fresh corn kernels with the sweet potatoes.  So pretty - orange, yellow, red, green and black.  Added a sprinkle of ground coriander seed to the roasting process.  I love cilantro, but didn't have any, and it was still outstanding.

This was tasty!  I served it as the main dish for dinner, along with a kale salad.  It definitely benefits from the lime, and I might have even liked it with the juice of 3 limes!  It would be helpful if recipes gave weight or number of cups of an item in the recipe, rather than "4 sweet potatoes" as these vary so much in size.  I used 2 sweet potato/yams, that weighed about 25 ounces total and that was plenty.  I used 1 large jalapeno, and did not use cilantro.   I also added about 1/2 cup of thawed, frozen corn.  We will definitely have this again.

This recipe is delicious. I used sweet onions instead of red and it’s great warm or cold to me. It was easy to make too. I went by the amounts for 6 servings and this lasted a whole week for lunch and sometimes dinner. Just enough spice from the jalapeño sauce too.

This is really good and I've made it many times. I find that a splash of rice vinegar improves the flavour (white wine vinegar would work too), and I usually add a chopped avocado and mix in cooked rice to make a heartier side dish. Great with peri peri or chipotle chicken.

Have made several bean salads similar to this recipe.  Love the added sweet potatoes.  Made exactly as recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  The changes I made were only to use what I had on hand.  I added a little cilantro paste since I didn't have fresh cilantro.  I also used bottled lime juice. I made a little extra & used as a salad dressing.  So good! I used Red pepper (which I prefer to green). I brought this salad to a picnic.  Loved it!

Added yellow bell pepper and more cilantro. Was delicious. Even better the next day. Will make it again. Saving this recipe. I'll probably try it without peeling the potatoes next time.

This is an awesome dish.  Holds up well too.  I doubled the recipe but did not double the jalapeno pepper (I don't like things too spicy).  Prepared it on Sunday and had leftovers for  lunch the next two  day.  I shared with co-workers who loved it too.  Definitely can make the night before and have ready to go the next day.

I didn't use the blender but finely chopped the jalapenos and garlic with a knife. These ingredients work perfectly together.
No need to change ingredients or proportions.

I made it with two variations.  I added cilantro into the dressing in the food processor, then garnished the finished dish with a few sprigs.  I used red, yellow and green bell pepper.  I took it to a potluck and received compliments and requests for the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again.  Leftovers are great slightly warmed.

The flavored are right on. We all loved it. My husband was raving about it. Had all items in my pantry. Very easy to make. Will definitely make it again!

This is delicious, but my jalapeño was REALLY a hot one.  I cut the recipe down since there would only be two of us enjoying the salad.  The flavors blended really well together.  I realized after we had eaten the salad that I forget to add the chopped cilantro before serving.  I made this up in the morning and we had it for dinner the same evening.  Something different, and we love trying new recipes.  Served this with corn-on-the-cob and 'Bunwiches' from AR.  Thanks bfr610, for sharing your recipe.  I looking forward to trying some of your other recipes.
