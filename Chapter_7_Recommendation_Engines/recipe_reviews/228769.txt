Bam! Winner, winner! Christoph, you are a genius! This is easy, quick AND delicious. It's the perfect side. The only slight deviation I made was to sauté the tomatoes first, then add the spinach, since spinach only takes under a minute to wilt down and cook.  I added the seasonings in with the spinach, instead of after the spinach was cooked. Since spinach wilts down so much, I consider this more 1 serving instead of 2. Tip of the night: Make lots!!! You'll regret it if you don't! This one's a keeper. Thanks Amy for sharing your hubby's recipe!

Loved it! Used Parmesan cheese instead of feta! Will try feta next time!

My daughter and I liked this and it was very easy. My husband didn't like it, but he's a very picky eater!

I really really loved this recipe! The only change I made was that I soaked my (dried) sundried tomatoes in the oilve oil for a few hours  beforehand to soften them up.
These flavours blend into such a delicious and savoury dish!
I served mine as a side to a pork chop and it was perfect.
Thanks Christophe :)

Delicious!  I also cooked the sun-dried tomatoes first.  I opted to add shrimp to the tomatoes then the spinach and seasonings.  We served over couscous.  Definitely double recipe!!! You’ll be sad if don’t!

This was easy and delicious!  I used it as a topping for baked flounder and we loved it.  We'll be making this again for a quick and tasty dinner.  I served it with brown rice.
