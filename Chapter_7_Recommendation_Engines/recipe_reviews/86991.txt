First of all, we live in Marina del Rey and have eaten at Killer Shrimp at least 50 times.  The title of this recipe is mislabeled in that this recipe is called a "soup," where in fact it is a recipe for a dipping "broth." The restaurant serves shell-on shrimp in the broth along with french bread for dipping.  The shrimp is eaten with your fingers like peel-and-eat shrimp.  No spoons involved nor carrots, celery, onions or mushrooms.  This is not a soup! That being said, if you add red pepper flakes to this recipe and reduce the tomato paste, this is a tasty and very close version of Killer's "broth."

I too am a big fan of the original Killer Shrimp and have achieved a nearly identical flavor through years of experimentation. This recipe as given has several points that will cause it to deviate from the real KS taste. (1) Too much butter. It should be 1 stick (1/2 cup) at the most and some people may find they would rather use less. (2) The shrimp MUST have the whole skin on. The flavor that the shrimp peels adds to the mix is essential, yet indefinable. (3) Double the amount of clam juice to 16 oz (4) reduce the rosemary by 1/3 and double the amount of fennel, add 1 tsp dried thyme (5) reduce the tomato paste to 3 TBSP (6) add salt, preferably sea salt (7) add 1 tsp of red pepper flakes (or to taste) (8) add hot sauce to taste. Finally, there is a secret ingredient involved, which I am not prepared to divulge. But the above will get you close.

Another reader stated she made this without fennel---without fennel it is not killer shrimp---it's just soup.

I have visited the original Killer Shrimp Restuarant many times, and the staff had told me they used beer instead of wine...something to think about !

An important step that is not spelled out in the recipe is to put a COVER the simmering broth.  This will ensure the same consistency as the restaurant.

Crushed pepper flakes or Frank's Red Hot will add the heat.  

This recipe is a great find-- The only think missing is service by a tattooed waitress!

I stayed pretty true to this recipe w/ the exception of cutting the butter in half (it had plenty w/ just half a cup) & subbing a bit of celery salt & a rib of chopped celery for the celery seed. The only changes I will make next time is to cut the tails off the shrimp. It's seems kind of silly to serve tail-on shrimp in a soup. Oh, I also added some crushed red pepper. About a tsp...maybe two. The broth is awesome...really, really flavorful. I served this w/ Mama D's Italian bread (from this site), which was the perfect bread for dipping in the broth, Bagna cauda (from this site) w/ veggies & for dessert, strawberries w/ zabaglione (also from this site). Very enjoyable dinner!

My husband and I are BIG fans of this restaurant. We no longer live in the area so I was thrilled to find this recipe! It was wonderful, but I made a few changes after reading previous reviews. I used 1/4 cup butter and think I still could've gone less. Added red pepper flakes and old bay seasoning. Didn't have fennel or celery seed, but added chopped celery. Fresh rosemary. I used medium shrimp but really missed the big ones that the restaurant served. Overall, a very good version. thanks for posting!

Tweak it a bit for a rich and flavorful soup that is different. I used 1/2 cup butter and think that is plenty. I added 1 stalk diced celery, a bay leaf, Old Bay Seasoning (a must), and a dash of Worcestire sauce and Franks Red Hot Sauce. Sautee the veggies and spices in a bit of olive oil before you add the broth. Add spinach or parsley right before serving for looks and health. Really good!

Outstanding!!!!! Restaurant Quality!!!! I reduced the recipe in half, and this still made plenty. I followed others suggestions and reduced the amount of butter and added some red pepper flakes; otherwise I followed the recipe. I did pinch the tails off of the shrimp before adding into the broth.  This really impressed hubby. Thanks for a keeper recipe!!! Highly recommend!! I just also wanted to add that this had a rather salty taste despite using low sodium chicken broth. I will use unsalted butter next time. I will search for the lowest sodium broth in the future. Still delicious - just don't add any salt! :)

I'm giving 2 stars mainly because it's a distance away from the original flavor. It's not a 1 star because NewMexicoMama provides a good foundation!    Dierdre58's modifications DO come MUCH closer (although it sucks that s/he won't divulge the "secret ingredient involved") LOL jk    I just got through making it about 30-min ago (with Dierdre58's modifications). After reading the other 5-pgs of comments last night I tried finding that secret element(s) myself by adding the following to Dierdre58's:     **first sauteed the minced garlic with the stick of butter    ADDED the following:    1 teaspoon thyme  1 teaspoon Worchestire sauce  1 tablespoon of Tobasco sauce  1/2 of a lemon (added to the 3 hour simmering)   1 can (12oz) Budweiser beer (instead of white wine)    I probably can't open my own chain of restaurants but the bowl I have in front of me is 98% there!!     *Maybe I just need a rockabilly waitress serving me, an arm full of tattoos, and a jar of Arnold Palmer to feel the other 2%    Again, bravo to Dierdre58! (now give YOUR ingredient) :)

I've been to the Killer Shrimp in Studio City California (several times)and recently moved out of state.  I was thrilled to find this recipe online.  It's the next best thing to the restaraunt itself.  Thank you!!!

This is great. I have made twice and everyone loves it. I substitute 1/2 the chicken broth with Clamato juice and it tastes wonderful. My only suggestion is that one loaf of bread is not enough. And the crustier bread is way better than soft bread.

Close to the real thing.  From what I remembered though, when the bowl was in front of you it would steam out amazing odors.  I didn't get that when I made this so I modified it to my own liking.  Here's what I did differently: First I used Diedre's recommendations for everything she mentions, like reducing the tomato paste (i actually used a couple tablespoons of Snap-E-Tom instead if you've never tried it do, you will love it in place of v8 spicy), adding more clam broth, etc.  At the end I added more butter (only using a little at first) and then some lemon juice, maybe a tablespoon or 2 so that the broth will separate.  I remembered this murky separation in the KS from when I was a teenager loving this restaurant.  I also splashed cream in at the very end to give it that creamier consistency, the soup should break at the oil level and underneath it should be a milky broth with a pile of spices at the bottom.  In no order, I added a dash of onion powder, garlic powder, worchesteshire, coriander, and Paul Prudhomme's seasoning (poultry or seafood is fine).  I also removed the shells from the shrimps, threw them in and stewed the shells in the broth while I deveined the shrimps.  Then I scooped all of the extra spices and shells out with a strainer before cooking the shrimps for the final 3 minutes.  I think it came out "killer"!!  Will keep trying to get it even closer!!

I used to eat at Killer Shrimp quite a bit.  The thing that is great about this recipe is that it's a great base to something that I thought would always remain a mystery.  Everyone has a different memory of what Killer Shrimp tasted like, so I'll tell you how I did the recipe.  I added a lot more garlic than was called for.  I just kept tasting and adding.  Next time, I would half the tomato paste - I ended up adding more beer (another change I did) because I thought the tomato flavor was too strong.  I also added thyme because I thought I remembered little sprigs of it floating around, and I think it added to the dish.  I put in a few more dashes of the celery seed, added a little more butter (mostly to cut the tomato taste) and also used a little cayenne pepper because that kick was missing for me.  I do not think that Worchestershire sauce was in the original - I added a litte, but could tell it was going to be overpowering.  Just my opinion.  All in all, this is a great, decadent dish.  Thank you for posting it!  And, apologies to the purists out there for modifying.  The basics of this recipe are great - season to taste!!

Followed recipe with some changes suggested by other users here: doubled fennel to 1t total, added 1t thyme, 1t crushed red pepper, sauteed garlic and all herbs with 1/2 stick of butter, then added broth, 16 oz clam juice and 3 T tomato paste. Then, at the end, added a stick of butter and the juice of one lemon when I added the shrimp, so I got that nice buttery stratification that I loved at the original KS. So so so awesome! I have tried subbing budweiser for the wine, but I prefer a dry white wine to the beer, personally, even if its not quite the same flavor.

Great recipe! In addition, I added 2 tsp. dried rosemary instead of 2 tbls. fresh, 2 tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp. garlic salt.  I crushed the spices up a little and I only added 1 stick of butter and it was plenty.  This is not suppose to be eaten with a spoon! Have plenty of bread on hand to soak up the yummy broth.

I've had a yen for Killer Shrimp and the lesser known (and now defunct) Bourbon Street Shrimp on Melrose.  This recipe was a great place to start.  I peeled the shells and tails from the shrimp.  I "sweated" about a cup of minced celery (including leaves) and minced onion until transluscent and then a few cloves of minced garlic and sauteed for a few minutes.  I added the shells and tails, chicken broth, wine, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, lots of rosemary and fennel, salt and pepper, a good tablespoon or two of Tabasco and a bay leaf and simmered all day.  I poured everything through a mesh sieve discarded solids and whisked in 3 tablespoons of butter at the end before adding the shrimp.  I am delighted with the result and cannot wait to tweak it again in the very near future or whenever Henry's puts these huge shrimp on sale again! Thanks for the recipe!

Killer shrimp is reopening in the summer 2010...:) Also, there is a can of budweiser used not wine...and yes ONE whole stick of butter was used in each bowl...my friend worked there for many years at the studio city location...also, this recipe is very close...I put a bottle and a half of budweiser beer...noticed there was something still missing...I added 4 large chicken cubes(knorr), 4 oz tomato paste, and milk...yes, milk...and it tasted more like the original..the original had a somewhat creamy texture and cloudy appearance...I went there for 13yrs practically 2-3X a month...anywho...it's still not the same..and I didn't rate it based on my version..I made it according to the recipe first...and my own version I rate it 4 stars...but 5 stars is only for the original!! I just can't believe nobody has still been able to get the exact recipe from someone ..lol =(

Yum!  Very easy and good.  I didn't include the celery seed or fennel (didn't want to buy it just for this recipe)  I reduced the butter to 5 TBSP and sauted the garlic and 2 stalks of celery (since I didn't use the seed.) Then cooked as directed.  I also used tailless shrimp as I didn't want to serve soup you had to peel.  I served in sourdough bowls and will make again.

This recipe is delicious, with a capital D!  Most reviewers say it's too much rosemary, but keep in mind the original may have meant FRESH rosemary, thereby you'd only use half or less dried.  I use one tablespoon of dried.  I have also added a cup of orzo and a couple cups of frozen spinach, and it got rave reviews.

This was superb! I had some crab broth so I used it instead of chicken broth and used beer as suggested in another review. Next time I might try a dash of worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved this. I have a similar recipe which is called cajun shrimp, I'll post soon.

Being a former Californian with VERY fond memories of Killer Shrimp, I couldn't wait to try this one. Like others I thought the amount of tomato paste was excessive so I cut it in half, and used beer (Corona) instead of white wine. The broth lacked the heat of the original that I remembered so fondly so I added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes which seemed to do the trick.  I also chose to strain the broth before adding the shrimp; biting into spent herbs after all that time simmering was a little unpleasant. Overall, a winner.

I worked for years in El Segundo,, just south of LAX. and Killer shrimp on Venice Blvd was a hit we made 2- 3 times a month for lunch.  This recipe is almost there but I remember Killer Shrimp had a bite to it.  I modified this recipe using half the tomato and adding the bite with chile powder and crushed red pepper to taste.  My daughter loves her's over rice,  a variant at KS also, and mine in the broth with plenty of french bread;

this wasnt quite "it"  I too miss killer shrimp.   melt the stick of butter in the cooking pot, chop 1/2 of a small white onion, mince the 5 cloves of garlic and sautee in the butter until fragrant.  Add all spices in this recipe adding 1 tsp thyme 2 tbsp kosher salt (i used low sodim broth and it was not salty) and 1 tbsp red pepper flakes to the sautee. add all other ingredients but  substitute 3 oz of tomato paste not 6 like this recipe implies , 16 oz of clam juice and add 1/2 a lemon sliced in half and put it in broth whole.  One hour is all it takes.  I crockpotted mine on high for 2 hours and it was like iI was back in the K.S. in redondo beach all over again

Amazing blend of flavors! I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. The soup was so delicious that we could have eaten it without the shrimp! The herb combination is just perfect. Thanks for sharing this!

One thing I did do differently which I highly reccomend was to buy Shrimp with the heads still on.  I pulled the heads and added them to the broth for the last two hours of simmering. It was the difference between chicken broth made from a whole chicken vs. boneless/skinless chicken breast. The Richness it added was absolutely key!!!!  You can pull them out if you just can't stand the sight of them. I of course enjoy sucking them like you would a crawfish. Either way this is darned close! Still missing a mystery ingredient that I just can't put my finger on but it is just plain YUMMY!

This soup is crazy good!!!!  I've had it saved in my recipe box forever, and have just now got around to making it.  I just cannot stress enough how insanely delicious this is.  I did add red pepper flakes per other reviews, but otherwise followed recipe.  If you are worried about the simmering time, let me tell you it is soooo worth it!  I am smiling right now just writing this.  Please make it as soon as possible!!

My brother and I used to go to the Santa Monica Killer Shrimp...I was so psyched to see this recipe! It turned out well, but here's my asterisk: I couldn't imagine using a pound of butter in this. Heaven knows there's no substitute for butter, but still...! I ended up sauteeing the garlic (and a chopped shallot, since I had some) in one stick of butter plus a tablespoon of olive oil, and even that was probably twice the fat I needed. I also agree with another reviewer that the heat could be turned up with red pepper flakes or a minced chile, but that's personal preference. Dang good shrimp.

Delicious! There used to be 3 of these in the SoCal area--they first closed the Redondo Beach location, then the Studio City, and finally the Marina del Rey. If it weren't for this recipe, I would've had to rely on my memories!

Yum! This soup reminds me of my favorite dish at a local restaurant. I followed the recipe except I added some sauteed onion and some crushed red pepper. I also marinated the shrimp for an hour in wine, minced garlic, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper. I served with lots of french bread for dipping. Will make again soon!

Delicious!  Similar to a dish served at Bubba Gump's Restaurant at Pier 39 in San Francisco.  Tastes even better the next day after the flavors blended even more! Don't leave out the wine!  I added some quick cooking brown rice before the shrimp for extra nutrition and it was wonderful!

WOW!!!! Best soup I ever had! Forget the bread, just drink it from the bowl. If the recipie size is too big, don't be afraid to half it. It worked great. No clam juice? Use more broth. AWESOME!!!!

I've never had the original "Killer Shrimp" so I can't compare. And honestly, does anything you make at home ever really compare to the stuff they serve at your favorite restaurant? Not in my experience. Anyway, I cut back on the broth, and added more tomato paste. I also omitted the celery seed because I didn't have any. Though I used less rosemary than called for, I would cut back on it further if I were to make this again - I found it a little overpowering. This turned out great though - and I definitely recommend some nice bread for dipping in the sauce/broth. Thanks!

Exactly like I remember it!  The only thing I add is crushed red pepper.  I made this for a couple of friends and now they ask for it every time they come for dinner.  So easy to make since all the time is just letting it simmer.  LOVE THIS SOUP!!

I thought this was terrible.  Perhaps the 2 tablespoons of Rosewary made it completely overpowering. Thank Goodness I wasn't serving it and tried the first bowl myself. I am going to remove the shrimp and try eating just those over rice and the rest is going dwon the drain.  I have triple checked the recipe against what I put in and it was the same. How could anyone like this?

I made this for a dinner party and most of the people there had been to the restaurant Killer Shrimp.  They thought it tasted very similar.  I agree with a previous poster that it was a little too buttery, and I added 2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes for a little more kick, and it worked well (I saw the variation on another killer shrimp recipe).

I love the use of spices.  Some modifications:  used vegetable broth, added worcestershire sauce and fish sauce at end and put some chopped cilantro and vegetables:  thin sliced carrots, celery tops, and peppers to hot soup.  Also, I cooked shrimp in microwave to avoid overcooking and added them and their juice to broth after cooking.  Instead of french bread, I used some big low oil croutons (lots) not too toasted, which just soaked up the juice.  delicious!

I thought this was awesome, but I added 1/2 a bulb of fennel with yellow onion. I cooked it for and hour and put it in the fridge for two days. Then pulled it out for sweet hart day and had a fabulous dinner with my wife.

I tried to stay as true to the recipe as I could, the only thing I added was a little Johnny's seasoning salt and old bay seasoning.   I also marinated the shrimp in some olive oil and old bay seasoning before adding it to the broth.  My husband really, really liked it and told me to add it to the make again pile.  I did serve with soft french bread, but think I would have been happier with crusty bread.  It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but I would certainly make again.  I was hoping for something similar to Ruth's Chris shrimp appetizer.  All in all, a very good recipe and it went together very easily.

I moved to NYC and just about died when I heard that Killer Shrimp was closed! My husband never believed me about the awesomeness of this broth until I made it.  Now he's a devotee and we make this at least once a year for Oscar night.  The broth is even great with chicken.  Always remember to save some to use later!

We are Killer shrimp & Jacks Shrimp fans. So thankful for all the comment tips, I added way more garlic, doubled the the clam juice & added alot  of crushed chili, Next time I am going to use less tomato and maybe use beer instead of wine, thanks everyone for your suggestions. Overall pretty close and still good!!!!!!

Great recipe.  Added diced tomatos.  Put cubed avocado in bowl before pouring soup and topped with cilantro.  The avocado was a great compliment to the tomato and garlic.

I had to omit some of the ingredients because I didn't have them in my pantry, but even without them, this recipe was delicious.  I had to omit the celery seed, fennel seed, and clam juice.  I added red pepper flakes and some cayenne pepper for a little more of a kick.  Besides that I went pretty much by the recipe, just keeping an eye on it for time (ended up just simmering for a couple of hours instead of 3).  Ate it with a piece of garlic bread - incredible!  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Killer is right.  Based on other reviews...I used beer.  I peeled the shrimp then simmered the shrimp shells in the broth and strained before adding shrimp.  Fresh rosemary and a few sprigs of fresh thyme as well and more garlic and fennel. I never had the original but I'm glad to have this recipe.

Well I tried this with suggestions from others to reduce the butter used and go with no salt/low sodium. Bad idea. This dish needs the butter. I went with low sodium broth and unsalted butter but ended up with a saltless flavor. Taking advise from tree hugging people might not be a good idea. I love fattie foods and will use salted butter and not reduce it down to only 1 stick. The tomato paste was way too strong of a taste compared to the restruant and only 2 maybe 3 leveled tablespoons is needed. Other than that, this could be very very close to the original Killer Shrimp.

Made this for the first time last night. It is the closest I've had to KS. I would recommend taking it easy on the tomato paste. I had to put more butter in because I remember KS had this nice buttery richness to it.Also I would use beer instead of wine I think it would give it more of a full body and, I would up the red pepper amount. Mine had a kick  but not like KS. Outside of that it was delicious.

Didn't like recipe.  I cut the butter in half and used red pepper flakes.  Maybe I did something wrong cause it has  a lot of good reviews.  We did eat it but, I don't think I will make again.

I cut the recipe in half and still used all of the shrimp.  My roommates loved it and I did reduce the butter.  I served it with chopped cilantro for garnish and it was gobbled up with a loaf of French bread and some latkas -- NOTHING left!  My roommate suggested I put in green Chayote squash next time.

Smelled and tasted like Killer Shrimp (the restaurant). Use fresh rosemary (2-3tablespoons, chopped)and do add 2 tsp of red pepper if you like it spicy. My husband thought the shrimp did not absorb enough of the flavor (since it spent only 3 minutes with the rich broth). Maybe we will try to marinate the shrimp first. Yum!

Loved this soup.  Used only 1 tbsp of rosemary and 1/2 c. butter - it's the best shrimp soup I've ever had.

This was really good and great on a cold night. I did not have celery seed or fennel seed so I just added the ends of my celery stalk which has all the flavor. I also used 1/2 cup of UNSALTED butter instead of the full cup of salted butter and it turned out great. I like to add hot chili sauce to my individual serving as I like it spicier than my husband does. I also took the tails off the shrimp.
Next time I would add chopped celery and sliced mushrooms. You can add pretty much anything to this yummy broth soup! Thanks for the recipe.

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. I think it would be o.k. as a starter course, in small bowls but I doubt I will even use it for that. In all fairness, my husband and my daughter did like it enough to get seconds. No rave reviews here.

Maybe I did something wrong.  The flavor was too strong.  The herbs made it overpowering and the butter made it too greasy.  I was too embarassed to serve it for dinner.

This recipe was close to the Killer Shrimp restaurant, however the sauce wasn't spicy enough. I will try adding crushed pepper next time to raise the heat level. This recipe was really good!

Not quite the Killer Shrimp I remember but it comes pretty close. I have made this recipe several times and only use just 1 stick of butter, fresh rosemary and thyme. For spice I prefer serrano peppers. I haven't tried it with the beer but I will for my next batch.

I really miss Killer Shrimp!  This is very close to their recipe.  I discovered if you add about 1 tsp. of Worchestire to the broth it is a bit closer to the "secret" recipe.  There is one more ingredient missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.

WE LOVED IT!!! It was a huge hit. KS restaurant was a favorite place for us & I was very sorry when I heard it closed. I was craving that soupy goodness and came across this recipe which I will forever use & treasure. I made a few minor adjustments to make it my own, but all in all this is a 5 star recipe!

I went into this recipe with the attitude that I have never had the original, so I may even enjoy it more than others, not having a preconceived idea of what it should taste like.  I started off following the recipe as it was (minus the entire portion of butter), and once I sampled it, was so turned off I tried to tweak it here and there, which helped, but I still ended up pulling out the shrimp.  My husband, who will eat ANYTHING, couldn't even eat it.  Sorry.

I have made this twice now and still not completely satisfied...I had eaten at the KS in Studio City since about 1996 and I am still looking for that "UMPH" in this recipe.  I added to much tomato paste the 1st time and to much fennel the 1st time.  I see that people say the recipe calls for to much butter, yet I think that may be the key for the "creaminess" th KS recipe had. The 2nd time I made it I added no fennel at all, lots more rosemary, crushed red pepper and less butter.  I found the enitre recipe WAY TO SALTY and that killed it for me (no Pun) and I could not figure out to fix it.  Sodium free broth I suppose.  So my point is, it is not perfect - almost there but still missing something.  I am going to keep on trying and I think next time no celery seed either.  Anybody have any hints?

I couldn't tell if I liked it or hated it. I think if you like V8 juice, you will probably like this recipe.  I'm not a big fan of V8.  I thought it had an ok flavor, but I don' think I would make it again.  Perhaps, it's because I ate it on a hot, 92 degrees day!

FANTASTIC! I was so impressed with how good this shrimp dish turned out and how easy it was. My whole family, including 2 and 4 y.o. gave it 5 stars. I did get started a little late in the day so only simmered 1 1/2 hrs after adding wine. Just as great. Also sauteed the shrimp with a little hot sauce, garlic and italian spices to give it some flavor. Only need 1/2 c. butter. It turned out perfect. Not to spicy for the little ones. We served this with french bread for dipping and a side salad. I will be keeping this one for sure!

Loved this soup!! Before I added the shrimp, I used my submersion blender to whizz it and make it homogeneous. Which really made it creamy, no oil floating on top. I used 3/4c up butter, and might use less next time. I used shell-on shrimp which definitely adds flavor but just made it messy to eat. Next time I will use peeled shrimp.

I only added 1/2 cup of butter, i sauteed the shrimp the night before in white wine and tonnes of spices, then used the broth from it in the soup. I also added some potatoes, celery and onion...it was AMAZING!! Simmer with th lid on, and let the time pass completely...dont rush this soup!! Also, take the tails off the shrimp ...eat with fresh bakes french bread...OMG YUM!! Enjoy everyone!! Excellent recipe.

I've been to Killer Shrimp they're in studio city too, but somethign that help with the flavor to develop is to cook it two hours then let it sit overnight and cook 2 hours before serving. lots of time, but it really helps the flavors to meld. Also this is great with rice or pasta with frech bread of course!

The broth is the key; I make it a little more hearty by adding sweet sausage(1lb), leeks(3) and orzo pasta(half a box).

I get so mad when people rate recipes and change them, but that's what I did this time. (But, at least I didn't change the recipe and give it a low rating - not fair!) I'm giving this 5 stars  because it gave me such a GREAT base to work with! I don't care for rosemary, so I omitted it and I added carrots, celery (instead of the seed) and onions. I didn't have any clam juice, but boiled the shrimp shells in the broth to give it more seafood flavor and I only used half the butter. Not exactly as written I know, but that's what's so great about this site, it lets those creative juices flow to suit each individual taste!

Extremely good - but very time consuming.  Save the leftover broth for another day and all you'll need to do is simmer it and add shrimp... and you have another meal :)

Lose most of the butter and it is fantastic!  There is a need for butter for the richness of the soup but 2-3 tablespoons is plenty

An interesting flavor.  I enjoyed this one.  I made a couple of slight modifications:  1) Strained the soup before I added the shrimp.  I don't like the consistency of rosemary, so the strainer removed it, 2) Cut off the tail of the shrimp and sliced the meat into bite-sized pieces.  This is easy to prepare, but does take a long time to cook.  Tasty.

This soup was really good, especially with french bread to dip in it.  It has a  "high sodium" taste but the bread balanced it wonderfully.

this soup was awesome! and it wasn't difficult to make, just a bit time consuming. it was definitely worth the 3 hour wait though. i actually used margarine and half of what the recipe called for. it still came out wonderful. definitely, get the bread for sopping up all that yummy juice! goes great with a salad and a glass of chilled white wine.

I found this dish was a "killer."  There was way too much butter.  The soup left my mouth and throat coated with butter fat.  It was hard to taste anything else.  There was no "kick" and it was expensive to make.  Maybe by cutting the butter in half and adding more clam juice, this dish might work.  But I think I'll pass on trying again.

I have never had this dish so I really didn't have much to go on but my own taste and some of the reviews. I upped the amount of fennel and reduced the rosemary. Also added half of a lemon, a few dashes of Worcestershire, pepper flakes are a must in this house and a tsp of cumin in the simmering. I also chose beer over the wine.

I live in La Paz Mexico, Baja California Sur.  I remember eating at the MDR Restaurant several times years ago & thought I´d give this a whirl.... Due to certain items unavailable, I made the following substitutions:  No clam juice to be had, so I also omitted the tomato paste and substituted 2 cups of Clamato .  The first step in this recipe mod was to reduce the clamato to one cup, then using suggested substitutions  posted elsewhere.  My fish monger had fresh colossal shrimp (no head) approx. 50 grams each ($11 per pound here in Baja) so used 3 per  dish and gave them 5 minutes in the broth to simmer (due to size). .. I also subbed beer for wine.

Something I have not heard anyone talk about in these reviews is to CLEAN the shrimp.  Using Kitchen shears, cut the shell down the center of the shrimp, leaving the shell attached to the body (A MUST)), then using a small knife , scrape the intestinal track from the shrimp and wash & rinse 3 times... it makes them super easy to peel & still preserves the great ¨shell on¨ flavor. 

Can´t honestly compare to the original, because it has been too many years..... maybe it was the shrimp... maybe the ambiance, maybe it was the Clamato... but it was the best bowl of KILLER Shrimp I ever remember... better than the restaurant....Thank you to everyone for helping bringing this classic recipe !

I made the soup in two parts. Boiled the shells on shrimp 3 hr low heat just as the recipe asked. next morning sau·té the shrimp with the butter. First time I use butter in the dish at this point. Seems to have did the trick and thicken the soup as I remember having it. thanks!

I read many of the reviews, discounting those that admittedly had never visited the restaurant.  I too gave this recipe a solid 4 stars because it gave me a good starting point.  I will give Deirdre the 5th star for the additional tweaks. Being that I have eaten at the old MDR strip mall upstairs many times, on cold and foggy days or those warm summer nights, studying the remnant spices in my bowl like reading tea leaves hoping it would reveal its secret recipe for its shrimpy, spicy goodness.  So here are my tweaks in my attempt to bring Killer Shrimp to the Arizona desert: 2 tsp red Chile flakes, 2 tsp fennel seed, 2 tsp rosemary, 2 tsp black pepper,  1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp kosher salt, 5 cloves minced garlic, 12 oz beer (I used XX lager) plus more to drink while it simmers, 3 tbsp tomato paste, 16 oz clam juice, 1 c butter, 4 cans chicken broth, 3 lbs med shrimp w shell and tail, 2 loaves French baguettes. **I used my Instapot on sauté option.  I sautéed all spices, garlic and tomato paste with butter then added one 8 oz bottle of clam juice.  Brought to a boil then added in the 2nd bottle, brought to a boil.  Added in 4 cans of chicken broth, drank a beer while it cane back to a boil and poured another bottle into the mixture, bringing it to a boil again.  Last, I added in the shrimp and set the Instapot on soup/broth for 5 minutes. There were plenty of leftovers after my family of 5 ate.  Great call for those that suggested extra bread!

I thought the broth was great, but the shrimp lacked flavor - I did use beer instead of wine and added more pepper flakes. I had leftovers of shrimp which I never do in my family.  Saved half the  broth to freeze before adding shrimp since I didn’t need that much and only used 1/2 Lb shrimp. I  will make again using the frozen broth but try marinating the shrimp in some of of the broth before cooking it next time.

I've made it, with my own twists, a half dozen times. Never had the original. Love it.

Reason for review: Try is sous vide, 1hr @ 135*. 

My suggestions: Cut tomato paste in half, sub dark beer for wine. Add red pepper flakes, and a bit of citrus.

I've got my own recipe for this, but try it sous vide, shell on.

First the changes:  I used olive oil, not butter and omitted the white wine (it had disappeared).  Added oregano to the spice list and used about twice the designated amount of tomato sauce instead of tomato paste.  And it didn't get to simmer for more than 10 minutes.
First taste:  Very blank.  Added salt, more black pepper, and a blast of chicken bouillon paste.  It tasted very good then.  I added a little hot sauce at the table, my wife didn't.  Crusty bread apparently had gone away with the jug of white wine, so I used a spoon.

I use my "Instant Pot" and modified to 30 minute for the first cool and 15 minutes using beer rather than wine with the second. I added "slap your mama", a little red pepper and some "Old Bay" with one stick of butter and added some some of the clams with the shrimp at the end.  Served with crusty rustic bread.  Very tasty.

Superfun to make, addictive to eat, can't wait to unleash this on friends, with fresh-baked ciabatta rolls.  I used Sapporo Beer rather than wine, fresh celery instead of seeds, considered the 2tsp. thyme most versions counsel but held off cause thyme bores me lately, and decided to use saffron as the secret ingredient. Of course that works--saffron with seafood? Uh, yeah--but next time got to try something more clever. And I think I'll give it thyme.

I did not use chicken broth. I used a 64oz can of clam broth and peeled the shrimp and simmered the shrimp shells in the broth for 45 minutes and strained it. Now I have shrimp broth. Sautéed onions in butter. Added tomatoe paste, minced garlic, and all of the aromatics until the paste turned a dark rich red and added a cup of sherry wine and let it reduce. Then I added the shrimp broth. Let it simmer for an hour.  Now is the time to season with salt. If you do it prior, the broth will reduce and get way too salty. The big secret that everyone thinks is beer,  it's not. The broth itself needs body. A thickener. Something that cohesively brings all of the flavors together. So I added a cup of heavy cream. And that Folks, is how it's done!  Simmer until  it reduces just a bit and you can see the tiny droplets of melted butter on top. Add the peeled shrimp, simmer for about 8 minutes, you do not want to over cook the shrimp which the actual KS restaurant is famous for serving over cooked, rubbery shrimp. Say "grace" and serve.  Bon appetite!

The flavor for this broth is fantastic! I was surprised by the small amount it made, and now understand after reading more comments, it is a broth NOT a soup. This makes more sense. I was not a fan of the rosemary since I love the flavor but do not like to chew it. I think this recipe calls for too much & next time I make it I will put in fresh sprigs that I can get the flavor from & then remove. We made fresh Irish soda bread & the crust and density of it was awesome with this.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I used 1 pound of medium shrimp and one pound of head-on shrimp. Next time I think I'll use all head-on they just taste so sweet and delicious. I will definitely make this time and time again. It was gone so fast I couldn't get a picture. Five stars all the way!!!

Thought this was an awesome recipe.  I had made some shrimp stock (simmered with some Old Bay Seasoning) and used that in place of chicken stock.  Added crushed and powdered cayenne pepper, and cut the butter in half but followed the rest of the recipe.  Just terrific.  The broth by itself is fantastic.

This has become a family favorite. I added Worcestershire Sauce (1 tablespoon), Old Bay seasoning (1 tablespoon), some Franks Hot Sauce and crushed red pepper. Two jars of clam juice instead of one and two packages of Swanson Seafood Flavor Boost. I then strain the broth just before adding shrimp. Everyone agreed the changes were made the broth wonderful.

Maybe I just don't get it.  I love seafood.  I love bread soaked in broth.  I also love fennel and garlic.  What I don't love is rosemary in my teeth.  I also think clam juice and rosemary together makes for a very weird flavor.  I'm not sure what is so appetizing about this, but obviously it is quite popular.  I would love to go check it out at the restaurant to see what all the fuss is about.  But, until then, I won't be trying this again.

Terrific! Followed the recipe exactly as stated and we loved it!  Ok, so maybe I added 1.5 cups of wine rather than one cup. :)

So easy to make and so delicious. I've served it as a side for special occasions or just as a weekly dinner. This soup is one of many reasons I look forward to cold weather!

I made this for the first time tonight.  It was scrumptious!! I followed recipe but used only 1/2cp butter as someone else as suggested- I used a crock pot on low for 6 hours adding wine the last 2hr and frz.tail on shrimp and baby spinach the last 1/2hr. It was excellent. My husband suggested and I agreed= the next time I will add diced potates, scallops and fish. and will probably try to find some dry, ground rosemary! This is yummy

This was really good. I used less butter as others recommended and I added a bit of red pepper flakes to add some spice. My family loved it. My only regret is not buying 2 french bread loafs instead of one. The bread ran out fast. I will be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing.

An awesome recipe.  I use less butter and its still very very good.  Otherwise, don't mess with this great broth recipe!  I also use this as a soup base for cioppino and gumbo which let me add more "ingredients" for a more complete meal.

I didn't care much for this recipe.  Once it was done, I added several different items so we could eat it.  I was true to the receipe but it just didn't meet my tastes.

fantastic broth, I added two cans of clams for a little extra meat. Sopped it up with lots of warm french bread.

Great recipe.  Way too much butter.  1/4 to 1/2 cup unsalted butter is best.  Add 1 tbsp of crushed red peppers to it or one crushed habeneroto add heat.

I used fresh basil because I couldn't find rosemary in the  grocery stores this time of year, and it turned out killer good! I also sauted celery, onions, garlic before adding the broth. Thanks for the recipe, will be making it again.
