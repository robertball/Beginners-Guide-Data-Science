I love this!!!! It’s so easy and so tasty!!! I’ve actually made this recipe before but it was so yummy that it disappeared before I could take a picture! I made the recipe as is but once I pieces apart the pork I put it back in the instant pot, turned it to sauté and let it go for another 10 minutes. That way the meat could soak up more flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  My husband thought the sauce was just a smidgen bitter so I would add a little sugar the next time.  However, it was easy to put together and very tasty.  My family has already requested to have it again.
