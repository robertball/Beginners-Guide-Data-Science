What a great recipe! I added chopped chives and grated Parmesan cheese right before serving.  Great alternative to mashed potatoes.

I made this last night for dinner to accompany a pork tenderloin, I wanted to try something different. I followed the recipe exactly as written and...my husband hated it and I tolerated it.  The celery flavor was just too strong, even with the sour cream and dill. I think it would taste better mixed with a potato or another root vegetable to cut the very strong celery flavor.  If you love the flavor of celery you would probably enjoy these.
After doing some more searching online, there are tons of recipes out there that offer alternative ways to serve this nutrient rich vegetable.

This was the first time I have tried celery root, also known as celeriac.  It has a mild flavor somewhere between potatoes and cauliflower.  This was a delicious recipe.  I did end up adding a little extra dill and a little bit of garlic powder.  My husband sprinkled a little shredded cheddar cheese on top of his serving and he liked it too.

I love this recipe!  I recieved 3 large celeriac from my CSA and had no idea what to do with them.  This was a fantastic alternative to mashed potatoes.  It tasted almost exactly like mashed potatoes with a slightly more fresh flavor.  The dill weed complements the natural flavor of the celeriac very well.  After reading the other review for this recipe, next time I will add chives and a pat of butter upon serving.

I followed the recipe with no modifications.  It was easy and delicious; lighter than mashed potatoes, and a much more complex flavor.  Wasnâ€™t quite as good reheated as leftovers the next night.

I used the recommended amount of fat in the form of coconut cream rather than dairy cream.  Being a low starch vegetable it could have used a bit more cream. I also and way more dill that the recipe called for and once plated I topped each serving with nutritional yeast for a bit of a cheesy flavour and added nutrient value.  I'd make this recipe again.

Interesting. Think, celery flavored cauliflower. The consistency is slightly less starchy than a potato, so make sure you drain it well or it will remain soupy. I think a sprinkle of cheddar may have been due. :-) Thank you for the recipe.
