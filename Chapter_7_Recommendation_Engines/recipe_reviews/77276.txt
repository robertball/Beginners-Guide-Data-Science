Tasty. I like cube steaks but there doesn’t seem to be many ways to fix them. I’d give this 5 stars for concept and flavor and I’ll probably make it again. But I gave it only 4 stars for ingredient amounts and method. The flour and the cracker mixtures were very skimpy amounts to bread 4 steaks. I also hate it when canned goods are called for in uneven can amounts. Instead I used a whole 15 oz. can to avoid having leftover tomato sauce and adjusted my spices. I’ve found that even though cube steaks are tenderized at the market they are still a fairly chewy piece of meat. I followed the baking method in this recipe as stated. Next time I will bake the browned cube steaks longer with the sauce poured over them and covered with foil so they “stew” a bit for added tenderizing. Then melt the cheeses on top.

Can I say Yum.  I did change a few things, didn't have crackers, so breaded it flour/garlic salt combo, egg and then italian seasoned bread crumbs which works well with the recipe anyways.  As per another reviewer, when baking the already fried steaks, I put them in a baking dish sprayed with pam, and poured store bought spaghetti sauce over the top, covered with foil and baked for 20 minutes.  Placed thick slices of mozzarella on top of the sauce and baked for 10 minutes longer, served on top of spaghettini...very good and fairly easy.

OH MY WORD!  I have used this recipe several times.  I have a catering business on the side and even my customers liked it.  My husband and I use the breading recipe (first 9 ingredients) for chicken, pork chops etc., brown them in some olive oil and serve with your favorite dipping sauce or gravy.  Definately a keeper!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband really liked it.  I would have only given it 3 stars.  I will make it again, but I will change a few things.

For starters, I didn't think the cubed steak got tender enough, so it needs to be cooked longer.  I will probably brown it the same way, pour the sauce on, cover and cook for an hour or more.

Secondly, I would use a marinara sauce or pasta sauce instead of plain tomoato sauce.  There wasn't enough flavor for me in the tomato sauce, even with the basil & sugar.

My husband works for a tomato company, so I'm pretty used to spicy, flavorful sauce and this didn't do it.  Even my dh complained about that a little and thought it would be better with a jarred spaghetti sauce.

However, it smells fabulous and with a few alterations, I can see this being a 7 star recipe!

P.S.  I also didn't like the cheese on the top, but that is just me.  My 3 year old daughter loved it.

This is a good dish. I did change some things though. I used bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning since I didn't have any crackers and I used store bought sauce. Overall, this was a really easy & good meal. I'm just so excited that there's another way to cook cube steak. Being from the south, all I've ever done is fried it. Thanks for the recipe!

I am trying to use up what I have in the freezer, and I had some boneless, skinless chicken breasts that had been run through a tenderizer.  They had the same bumpily appearance as a cube steak, so I used them.  The browning process cooked them through so I didn't have to bake them.  I used panko instead of saltine crackers for the breading, and an eight ounce can of tomato sauce with a can of diced tomatoes for the sauce.  These came out great.  I'll try it with beef cube steaks when I'm allowed to buy new meat.

This was good but a little bland.  I will use spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce next time.  Also, it seemed like something was missing.....should be recommended to be served with spaghetti, such as with chicken or veal parmesan.

Very good blend of flavors.  Nothing was overpowering like some Italian dishes.  Very easy to prepare and visual appeal was great!  I used shredded mozzarella instead of the slices and it was fine.

Absolutely wonderful dish. My husband and I eat cube steak quite often, but only know two ways to cook it, so when I came across this recipe I had to try it. I used Italian breadcrumbs and placed Ragu sauce over the cube steaks with aluminum foil and cooked for 1 hour. They came out so tender, didn't even need a knife to cut. Will definitely continue to cook this!

Delicious recipe and very easy!  A few substitutes to make it easier... italian bread crumbs to subsitute for crackers and spaghetti sauce to substitute for tomato sauce.  I used a little more flour, at least 4 Tbsp.  Eyeballed the salt and pepper.  Be sure your cube steaks are tenderized or it will be too chewy, bouncy.    I heated spaghetti sauce in pan and after 25 minutes I spooned the sauce over the cube steak (not too much) and sprinkled shredded mozarella cheese (nice amount) over the sauce and let it sit in the oven for about 5-7 minutes.  I didn't use the garlic powder but used oregano.  Doesn't require that many spices if you are going to used seasoned bread crumbs.  Easy and delicious!

ok so ive only had a few bites of this so far, and i have got to say.... my mouth is VERY happy right now. did a few things different but not enough to really change it from the original recipe. just used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs (easier, same result) put a little more oregano and garlic in the sauce along with some basil and simmered it while the steaks were baking in the oven (5 minutes of heat up time isnt enough to get the flavors out and blended). shredded parm on top along with shredded mozzarella. served over a bed of linguine. so so so so so so so SO good. very easy to make and the outcome is incredible.

This was Italian restaurant style DELICIOUS! My cube steaks always come out so tough-basically a waste of money. These were so-oo flavorful and tender. My whole family gives this 5 stars, and wants more, soon. Gladly! Thank you for submitting a definite winner.

I always pound out my cube steaks thin which is key! (tip: pound meat inside a zip lock bag to avoid the mess).  I have also used bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  I serve this with lemon butter parsley red potatoes on the side.  Yummy!

This recipe was good, however, I tried it a different time and used italian bread crumbs which were very tasty.  If you are looking for a healthy meal, change it to your liking to make it more 'figure friendly'.

Very good, quick and easy.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and spaghetti sauce.  Baked for 15 min after browning and then 30 min with sauce and covered.  Very tender.

Yummy! Even my picky hubs liked this!!! My mom served fried cube steaks often growing up because they were cheap, easy to prepare & my dad loved them. I hated cube steak Monday's SOOO much, I vowed to NEVER eat them as an adult. I've had a hankering for veal Parmesan lately, but am "trying" to maintain a budget (vacation & the holidays are just around the corner). Cube steaks are cheap, so I decided to give this a try. I am happy to say, I was not disappointed in the least. :) As with any new recipe I try, I made a few changes. Since my grocer only sells 2 cube steaks per pkg. (~ 1 lb. worth of meat), I made 2 steaks instead of 4. I also subbed a jar of Prego marinara sauce because I already had it on hand. I doubled the seasoned flour & cracker mixtures and am glad I did.... There really wasn't any need to double the flour mixture, but I definitely would have run out of the cracker crumb coating had I not doubled it. Instead of baking my browned cube steaks uncovered (without sauce), I topped them with my jarred sauce, covered with foil & baked for DOUBLE the amount of time called for. I was afraid I'd end up with tough meat otherwise (cube steaks are a pretty tough cut of meat even AFTER being tenderized). After my steaks were cooked thru, I added the mozzarella / Parm cheeses & oregano, baked another 5 min. and then tossed under the broiler for a few min. to brown. Served with spaghetti, a salad & garlic bread, this was a really good meal. Thanks for sharing, SMR012! :-)

This is an ok, work day recipe. Meant for when you want something quickly. For what it is, it's good. The herbs for the tomato sauce are sparse. I would substitute Italian seasoning instead, even up to a tablespoon. Someone down rated the recipe for toughness when she used a round steak. Round steak must be braised to get it tenderized (and pounding it helps, too). Braise the round steak in the sauce for about 2 hours, maybe an hour and a half. I usually just braise round steak in my electric skillet, not in the oven, but the oven is fine. Also, some say they don't like cubed steak. Make with hamburger instead, but use the best hamburger, not some ground fatty something.
I would omit the sugar. Mom always said to add a spoonful of sugar to whatever you cook. Mom was wrong. We are over sugared and over salted today.

My mother-in-law made this one night when we were over for dinner.  She gave me the recipe and I have made it once.  It is sooo good.  If you like a little more sauce I recommend doubleing it.  YUMMM

This recipe was a definite hit!!!  The only thing I changed were the cracker crumbs.  Instead of those I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I have made this using both tomato sauce and using Ragu 7-herb spaghetti sauce.  We prefer the Ragu to the tomato sauce.  This goes well on a bed of linguine mixed with butter and grated parmesan cheese.

This turned out great. My husband loves this. I usually make this with chicken breasts, but my hubby didn't like that as much. He is more a meat man. Great recipe. Thank you.

So...really was skeptical about this..I happily stand dismayed at the awesome tenderness of this dish!  Modified the coating to panko and Parmesan...put the basil and oregano in the flour with the s and p.  I was pressed for time after making spritz cookies all day with my mom and daughter so I cheated and used jarred sauce.  Still an amazing dish...I will now search out the dreaded cube steak just for this recipe!  Thanks SMR012!

This a great recipe. I doubled the flour, salt and pepper.  I baked the cubed steak with the sauce mixture and put tin foil over the dish.  The last 5 minutes I took the tin foil off.  Used shredded mozzarella(that is what I had) instead of slices.

Great new way to make cube steak.  I served it over spaghetti.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers.  You need more than 3T flour as the recipe called for.  I only made three cube steaks and barely had enough to coat them.  If you use 4 steaks as the recipe calls for, you will definitely need more.  I also used jarred spaghetti sauce and poured it over the steaks before putting in the oven. I baked them about 40 mins in a covered casserole dish and then added the mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese and baked another 10 mins.   I turned on the broiler for a few mins just to brown the cheese a little. Steaks stayed moist and provided sauce for the spaghetti.  A hit with my whole family.

VERY good!  I didn't make it exactly as the recipe called... used canned sauce and bread crumbs for the coating, but the concept was fantastic.  I was able to use up some cubed steaks we would have never eaten otherwise. And the cheese on top was a PERFECT addition.  My husband raved about that part for sure.    I was hesitant to put the sauce on top before baking b/c I thought it would make it soggy, but I was wrong.  I'll do the same thing with my chicken parma in the future... it soaked in the flavor and was really yummy!

Excellent recipe!  I fried sliced zuchinni and onions in the fry pan after removing the cube steaks and added the sauce to simmer.  Then I put all of it over the cube steaks and put on the cheese.  Tasty!

I love this dish! Always wondered what I could do with cube steak. I use a few short cuts though... seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crushed saltine crackers and basil.(still add the parmesan). Store bought pasta sauce (just pour it on). I cook for a family of five and this dish is easy, pleasing and innexpensive.

I followed advice left by others and substituted spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce and related seasonings, and Italian bread crumbs for the saltines. The result was excellent. The cooking instructions resulted in tender pieces of meat, not tough at all. Delicious served on top of spaghetti. I had tried making something like this a few years ago with a different recipe, and my wife didn't like it. This version was a big improvement.

I used 1/2 jar or traditional ragu, and baked almost an hour to tenderize steak.  The family members who didn't appreciate it still had spaghetti with marinara.  I would try this one again.

I had this recipe bookmarked for a long time. My husband is an avid hunter so I was thrilled to try a new venison recipe. This could very well be a 5 star rating but I gave it 4 only because I thought it needed more salt. That is the only thing I think I would change. The meat was very tender and when it came out of the oven it was picture perfect. Thanks for sharing, the whole family really enjoyed.

Easy, delicious, and mild flavored. I used ground round instead of cube steak and panko bread crumbs. The sauce was good with this and it was mild tasting. I really liked it for a plain and simple sauce. I simmered mine on the stove while the meat baked the 25 minutes so the flavors could blend. Fantastic recipe! This was a fabulous meal with a tossed green salad and some ravioli on the side. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe. I usually double the cracker/cheese mixture and the egg in it and I omit the sugar in the sauce. I usually serve with pasta and it is one of my family's favorites!

This was a good way to change up both cube steak and spaghetti. I used jar sauce and made it gluten free with GF bread crumbs. I cooked it almost an hour and it was tender. I gave it a 4 because I took other's advice and cooked it longer and used jar sauce. I liked that it was very quick and easy to pull together.

I made this tonight using some inexpensive "manager's special" ribeye and it was fantastic!  I used Ritz crackers because that was all I had and doubled the salt, pepper, basil and oregano to make it extra flavorful.  I also added a little minced onion to the sauce.  I will definitely be putting this in dinner rotation!  Served with spaghetti squash it is a wonderful, tasty, EASY dinner!

There is not too much to this recipe.  I used my own marinara sauce which I always have on hand.  The recipe is relatively simple and straight forward.  I'm not a big fan of cube steaks, but wanted to try them anyway.  I'll stick to chicken or eggplant.  Basically, this is the same as a chicken or eggplant parmesan recipe.

Notice how most everyone who did not rate this 5 stars changed the recipe in some way. I did it exactly how it says and it turned outwonderful. I did notice the same thing another reviewer did and that was that the flour and cracker mixtures were a little skimpy. But I made it work and didn't waste any of it so that was good. Basically my family loved it, I will make it many more times, and it is a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

OK, I read all the reviews first and followed their advice! I made the following changes and this came out great. I doubled the breading mix (except I still used 2 eggs). I used Italian seasoning and prepared breadcrumbs instead of the saltines because that is what I had on hand. After browning the meat I poured a jar of spaghetti sauce over the top baked it in the oven for 45 mins covered with aluminum foil. I then sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese over the top and baked uncovered until the cheese melted. Served over egg noodles this was a keeper!

Used the recipe for the steak coating, but used our own homemade sauce. Really yummy, and a pleasant change from the usual chicken parm.

okay like most people I made a few changes.  I added some italian seasoned breadcrumbs to the saltines and parmasan.  The other change I made was in the sauce.  I took one 15 oz can of tomato sauce then stirred in one small can of italian seasoned tomato paste.  Then I seasoned it with 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, basil, thyme and garlic powder.  Let it simmer while you cook the steaks and then prepare like normal.  I used the left over and tossed it with some pasta on the side.    This was wonderful with venison steaks.

A  great way to use cube steak; I used my own homemade spaghetti/marinara sauce in place of the plain tomato sauce.  Very, very good recipe.  Served with big green salad and crusty french bread and fruit for dessert.  Yum!

Used spaghetti sauce that I already had on hand instead of making it by the recipe and I used a round steak instead of cube steak.  I just cut it up in squares.  The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that the steak was not as tender as I hoped for.  I will be making this recipe again.

This recipe was the best thing I have made in a while. I did a few substitutions, rather than saltines I used the Garlic and Parmesan Club crackers, and added some italian flavored breadcrumbs to the crust mix. The only thing I would do different is make a little more sauce to blend with the angel hair pasta it was served with....

I don't care for cube steaks too much, but I was in the mood for something different so I tried this recipe. I must say these were the tastiest cube steaks I've ever had. Mine came out a little bit dry but that's because I cooked them longer since my steaks were really thick. Like others, I used prepared speghetti sause but I added in some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, basil & parsley. They had lots of flavor! I think this would be really good on boneless, skinless chicken breast's or egg plant slices fried w/ the cracker-parmesam cheese mixture. Thanks for sharing.

We really enjoyed this!  I did what a lot of other folks did, and used jarred spaghetti sauce.  I think it needs a little bit more than just 5 minutes after putting the cheese on - next time will bake the meat 15 minutes, add the cheese and bake another 15 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

I was searching for a recipe like this! No more mushy cube steak in brown gravy! My family loved this. I used jarred spaghetti sauce (Newman's with red wine) and it was just delicious.. The cracker crumbs with parm cheese made a nice brown crunchy coating.I will make this over and over..Thanks so much for submitting this winner!

I made this for my husband last night and we both really enjoyed it.  I used someone's suggestion of serving it with buttered pasta topped with parmesan, which I sprinkled with parsley flakes to add color.  I would probably steam some veggies for a side dish next time I make it.  Delicious!!

I made this last night and it is great! I ground my cracker crumbs coarse and I think I liked it better this way. I served it with angel hair pasta tossed with butter and parmesan cheese.

We had some cube steak in the freezer and didn't want to make country fried steak (ok, my wife didn't want that) and we stumbled upon this recipe.  The steak was amazing - we both had very low expectations but we absolutely loved this dish.  I was nervous about the sauce (based on other reviews) but it was a very nice red sauce (we also doubled the flour mixture).  Very quick, very good meal!

This recipe was good!  I used italian bread crumbs instead of the saltine crackers, I felt like it gave the recipe more flavor.  I also used homemade tomato sauce a friend of mine had given me.  Those were the only changes I made and we really enjoyed it.  I served it over spaghetti with garlic bread. We'll be making this again!

This was so good!!! I read some of the other reviews and made some adjustments myself. My cube steaks wasn't tough they was so tender. The secret in cooking this type of meat it how long you cook it for. The harder you fry it the tougher it gets. So I just cook it for a 1min or 2 on both side until it was a nice brown crust. Then I put it in the pan. I did the bread crumbs to nice touch. The only reasons why I rate it 4 stars because it wasn't enough sauce for me. I like sauce so for leftovers I add some more spaghetti a sauce.

Very very good!  Usually I am looking for a way to use up the cube steaks when we get beef processed.  After trying this recipe we might just run out of it first!!  The only changes I made were shortcuts: used a jar of my fav spag sauce in place of making all tomato "stuff", and used purchased italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  Everyone liked it LOTS!!

I made this tonight and my family loved it! I marinated the meat in Italian dressing last night and all day today and then followed the recipe only substituting bread crumbs for the crackers. I also used jar sauce, covered it with the sauce after frying, covered it with foil and baked it for 25 minutes. After adding the cheese and letting it melt under the broiler I served it up and my family raved about it! The meat was so tender and you could cut it with a fork, I mean really melt in your mouth tender. The Italian dressing I felt just added to the flavor of it and would recommend marinating it before frying!

Very good!  I added a little garlic and onion powder to the flour mixture, and used my own homemade breadcrumbs and sauce and a combination of provolone and mozzarella cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

Tried twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and turn out very good.  Second time I tried to cut back the Parmesan but turn out only average.  Don't try making it healthier.

My family enjoyed this very much. I had to triple the amounts to feed a family of seven which includes two teenage boys.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of making the sauce as directed.  After coating and frying the last thing I wanted to do was cook an extra "thing."  We served it over whole grain spaghetti.  We also served it with caesar salad II which is on this site.  I'm excited to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Delish - although instead of all of the sauce ingredients I did 'cheat' and use pasta sauce (shhhh). The flour/saltine/parmesan cracker mix wasn't enough. I only made 2 cube steaks and it only covered that. For anyone that uses this recpie - please double the amount of flour and saltines/parmesan mixtures. Thanks for posting a delish recipe!

I love the idea of this recipe but the cube steaks were quite tough.  I think they were overcooked. Maybe if you just fried the steaks and put them in the oven with some sauce just long enough to melt the cheese.  I seasoned the steaks before I battered them, used seasoned bread crumbs and a jarred marinara.  They would've been great if the meat wasn't so tough.  I made some homemade spaghetti noodles with the marinara as the side.

My family did not care for this meal. The cube steak was chewy and the breading came off while I was frying it in oil. But now we have a craving for chicken parmesan!

I used Ritz crackers, eliminated the excess salt and I made my own marinara sauce. I did have to make more breading as there wasn't quite enough to cover the cube steaks I had. This was easy, but bland. It could have been better. NOTE: And I'm aware that adding the excess salt wouldn't help with the blandness, but there could have been more flavor added besides saltiness.

I haven't tried with beef...however it was excellent with venison. I'm giving it 4 stars because my kids didn't care for it, but it was probably the venison and not the recipe. I will definitely try this with beef, though. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very easy and taste recipe. I tried it and have sent it to a couple of friends. The only change I made was that I used jar spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce because I was putting it over noodles and wanted a bit more sauce, not to mention I was feeling lazy and the jar of spaghetti sauces was out on the counter already.

This was a decent recipe. I think the next time I will not add Parmesan Cheese with the Mozzarella cheese. I think it was a little overpowering. The possibilities are endless for this recipe. You could use chicken instead of beef. Spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I used shredded Mozzarella from this dish. Will make again, maybe being alittle more creative.

This is perfect.  A couple of weeks ago I was searching for just such a recipe and I found this.  Made it and it was wonderful.  Then today I find it in my inbox for the day's recipe that they send!  We all loved it and didn't change a thing.

I prepare chicken parm a lot, so I thought I'd change it up and try this.  Unexpectedly, my husband and kids really liked it!  Like other reviewers, I too used bread crumbs and spaghetti sauce.  Great way to use this type of meat!

It was a hit. I didn't have bread crumbs so I tossed Monterey and Parmesan cheese with Italian seasonings and fried it that way. I also used Spaghetti sauce to give more flavor and served over noodles.

A very tasty recipe. I'm not a fan of cube steak in general, so I really liked how this dressed up the meat. The flavors all mixed well without one over powering the other. I want to try it with chicken breasts next.

I have been making this recipe for several years now. My family LOVES IT. I always have to double the cracker mixture to have enough. This recipe has a ton of flavor. We always have green beans and mashed potatoes with the steak. Awesome recipe dont change a thing!

This was a delicious way to serve a tough cut of meat. I'd only had cube steak as "country fried steak" before and was looking for something different. So glad I found this! I gave it an extra pound with my toothed meat hammer before breading it, and I also covered it with foil, lowered the temp about 10 degrees, and cooked a little longer to give it a chance to tenderize.

It was 6pm, I had 6 cube steaks thawed, and had no idea what to make for dinner.  I used this recipe.  Since it was on a whim, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made due.  It was delicious!!  Family loved it!  Instead of saltines, I used one roll of smashed up Ritz veggie crackers. I didn't have any Parmesan or Mozzarella, so I used 1c Fontinella cheese for the breading, and the rest of the 8oz package I use as topping.  I've never had this kind of cheese before, but I got in a gift basket from Di Gregorio Foods, and thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't have any basil, so used some bread dipping spices that I also got in my gift basket.  Instead of the tomato sauce concoction, I used spaghetti sauce.  A great alternative to the 'same ol' same ol' fried steaks!

Thank you for such a delicious recipe! I seasoned my steaks first and used a jar of Ragu and added more seasonings. I served it on top of whole wheat spaghetti noodles. The finished product came out extremely tasty!  This is a winner and a new addition to my recipe stash!

This was amazing! I too used bread crumbs and a jar of spaghetti sauce. And I didn't have any mozzarella so I sprinkled with shredded mild cheddar. It was very easy to prepare and tasted great!! I served an angel hair pasta dish on the side. Bread would have completed the meal but I ran out of time. This is definitely a recipe I recommend you try.

I didn't know what to expect! But it was very good. I didn't have mozzarella so I used provolone and still very good! The only bad part was that I only made two and didn't make more!

OMG - this is the only way to make cubed steaks. I've never had a good cube steak before and these were delicious. We used about yr old frozen venison and it came out wonderful. The key is to only brown the steaks in the pan for 1-2 minutes on each side and to allow most of the cooking to take place in the oven. I baked 1/2 w/sauce (as per another reviewer) & 1/2 the way the recipe stated. They both came out great. Another idea: Omit the tomato sauce and make sandwiches using this recipe. Top w/your favorite cheese or sauce.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to use rosemary flavored cocktail/canape crackers instead of saltines and I used canned & diced tomatoes ss I was out of tomato sauce. I pounded the cube steak and followed the rest of the recipe accordingly. The result was tender cube steak and a great sauce that I will make again.  It was light and fresh tasting = perfectly complimentary to the cube steak. I served it over spaghetti with a side of steamed spinach with garlic and almonds. We preferred to serve this with an amber lager beer.  Wonderful tastes and textures.  I will definitely make this again.  I have no difficulty giving this recipe 5 stars.

This recipe was wonderful!  Usually my cube steaks would turn out chewy - this was tender - easily cut - you would never guess it was cube steak!  I did change a few things - I only had asiago instead of parmesan (and used less), I used oat bran instead of the breadcrumbs and and used pizza sauce instead of the tomato sauce mixture.  I forgot to put the steaks in *before* putting on the sauce, so I put foil over the *pizza sauce* covered steaks for the first 25 minutes - then removed the foil, sprinkled a little asiago cheese on top and baked for another 25 minutes.  They went fast - the kids loved them - they were SO good!
Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this for a quick Sunday meal and it was eaten, without ANY coaxing, but our 4 year old and 2 year old.  That equals five stars.  Substituted bread crumbs for crackers, but that was the only change.  Thanks for a new recipe for our family file!

This was good.  We're getting local beef and I didn't quite know what to do with all the cube steaks we got, so I was glad to find this.  I also substituted spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce & spices.  I'll make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I recommend using your own favorite sauce (bottled or homemade) because then the taste is just the way you want it. I used my homemade chunky tomato sauce - and I love my sauce so I knew I would love the dish! FANTASTIC!

I will give this 2 1/2 stars.  It was alright, but not great.  It smelled great, but was not all that tasty.

Very good - but I admit, I modified it a bit. I didn't use jarred sauce (there IS such a thing???) but used diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, and I completely skipped the sugar part. Also used Italian bread crumbs instead of Saltines. Otherwise, pretty much followed the directions (spicing to my family's tastes of course) only baking the cheese a bit longer than called for (my group loves their cheese all browned and bubbly.)
Result - great taste, simple and easy meal. A nice new twist on cube steak. And the steak came out surprisingly tender and juicy. The ultimate test? When both munchkins decided it was a "do-again" type meal.

This was a different way to make cube steaks, but I think it still needed something.  Other reviewer said to use prepared sauce, but I chose to follow the recipe.  Next time I may take their advice.

I'm always looking for recipes using cube steak.  I finally found it.  Using other suggestions, I substituted bread crumbs for the saltines and spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce.  Very good!

Everyone liked this recipe.  The breading is very yummy and I think I'll follow the other reviewer's lead and use it for other dishes.  The sauce is simple but good.  I came close to giving this five stars but it barely missed that TDF (to die for) quality that I reserve my best rating for.

Really good, though I used crushed ritz instead of saltines, and I think it may be better that way. I had a little over a pound of cube steak, so I used a full can of tomato sauce and upped the spices a bit, as well as adding some Italian seasoning and rosemary. I didn't have sliced mozzarella cheese, but shreds worked just fine. For this being my first "breaded" meal I have ever made, it was actually pretty easy to throw together.

I've made Steak Parmesan for years. Always comes out fabulous. As a matter of fact, if I want to impress a woman by having her over for dinner, I make this dish. Always a hit! The differences I make with this dish is that after I fry up the cube steak in Italian bread crumbs I layer the steak in a Pyrex bread baking dish with the cheese and sauce alternating layers and baking @ 350 for 30 minutes. Served with Angel Hair Pasta, (girls like that), fresh garlic bread and a nice salad, a red wine, and some nice fresh desert.

I gave 4 stars since it needed some adjustments to make it more flavorful.I breaded with Italian breadcrumbs instead of crackers, then for the sauce I sauteed fresh onions and garlic in the pan that I used to brown the steaks, then added a bit of red wine and tomato sauce with some fresh basil and a bit of oregano. Then I mixed in my favorite jarred Marinara sauce. I sprinkled fresh grated romano cheese over the steaks and a spoon of sauce and cooked them for the 25 minutes, then added mozzarella and more romano cheese for another five minutes.  I served it with spinach fettuccine and the remaining marinara sauce.  A fresh green salad with a simple vinaigrette rounds out the meal.  Kids, everyone gobbled it down. Definitely a keeper recipe for cube steak.

Doubled Up All Ingredients And It Turned Out Fantastic. I Used Milk Instead Of Water And Whole Grain Crackers Instead Of Plain. Served With A Bottle Of Wine, Chilled, And It Made For A Wonderful Meal. The Key Was To Double Up Everything Unless You Cook Only 1 Steak.

I love this recipe,though I tweaked it to my own style of cooking..i used ritz crackers instead of saltines, added red wine to sauce, and topped the steak with fried eggplant then doubled the sauce and covered with the cheeses....it was awesome..Donna, Louisiana.

Inexpensive, tasty and easy...my kind of dinner.  I didn't have any flour so had to skip that.  No big deal.  Didn't have tomato sauce so just used some jarred spaghetti sauce instead of most of step 3.  and I Subbed provolone for mozzarella.  Still turned out great!  Will definitely make this one again.

My husband and I loved this recipe! Didn't have saltine crackers so i used seasoned bread crumbs instead, turned out great. Only downside to recipe to me is not enough sauce. My husband likes alot of sauce. I will double the sauce part next time. Definitely a keeper! I definitely will be making this again!

Not a lot of flavor, and a bite chewy. Frying the cube steak longer might help.

I really like this recipe. It's relatively easy and delicious. I cubed my meat which really stretched it out so I only needed one big steak. I also cooked it longer than the directions which really helped with the chewiness of the meat. It almsot tasted like veal parm.  I also didn't use sugar in my sauce and I added fresh basil on the top before baking. Served with egg noodles and a salad it makes for a perfect meal. Yummm thank you for the idea!

Very ho hum in my opinion. I used a mallet to pound out the meat so that it would be tender. The steak looked great when it came out of the saute pan, very crisp and brown. However after putting the sauce on it, the crust became mushy and in some instances slid off. After cooking, the meat was not as tender as I would have liked and overall it just wasn't outstanding. Not a dish I would make again.

This turned out very good. I used homemade marinara and breaded with panko instead of the crackers. Next time I will use veal to have a more appropriate texture and flavor.

OMG We LOOOOOOOVED this. Best. Use. of Cube Steak. Ever!  Served it over angel hair with extra sauce (used mushroom garlic - jarred, because it was really late at night and I was making this for lunches for the week).  It really was so delicious and had no problems with toughness.  Baked it for another probably 7 minutes with sauce and cheese on.  In a pinch, I've used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs and it's just as good. It saves time and effort on the cracker crushing.

This recipe was OK.  I think my main issue was that I'm not a big fan of cube steak. The steak itself was very chewy and tough. I think next time I'll use the same recipe but instead of using cube steak I'll use very thin cut chicken breast.

This was amazing, but it needed a little bit more flavor.  I would season the meat with salt and pepper and put more oregano in the tomato sauce.

I usually make this steak with gravy but wanted something different.  This was a great and easy receipt to make.  My 10 year old son loved it also.

This was very good. I have tried several different recipes for cube steak and this was by far the best. We are cheese lovers so we used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4 slices. We also added spaghetti sauce since the recipe didn't call for enough tomato sauce. But this is a very good recipe!!!!

Sometimes walking two blocks to the store to make sure that you have everything is too much of an effort on a weeknight. I used a crumb mixture from day-old corn bread, a can of tomato sauce and a can of seasoned diced tomatoes, and topped with Provolone. Everything was liberally spiced as I went.

Who knew cube steak could taste this good? Thank you for the recipe.

4.5 Stars: We were actually surprised by how good this was and what a great new way to use cube steak!  I did cheat and use jarred spaghetti sauce.  Some meat was a little tougher than others, but I think that's just in the cut.  All a all, definitely a keeper for cube steak.

Made these at my firehouse a few days ago. Instant hit and are now in our regular dinner rotation. The basic recipe is a little bland, so use Italian bread crumbs and homemade,  bottled,  or canned sauce for a better flavor.

I wish there was a way to do half a star.  I would have made it 2.5.  I did not like the way it fried.  I have had better as I have fried steak my whole life, but I decided to give this a try.  No one finished it.

I made this for my family last night and I must say it was AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  My wife is still talking about this recipe.  If your looking for a different way to prepare Cube Steak this is surely the one.  I'll be using this recipe on a regular basis. PERFECT!!

Pure deliciousness! Though I did follow the reccomendations of baking in sauce and I used bread (I was out of crackers) and I made my own version of sauce. But it's really hard to find different ways of serving min steak and this was great! Will deffinetly do it again!

I loved this alternative to regular cube steak!  Perfect blend of seasonings!  I was ready for a variation and this was perfect.  My husband loved it too!! I made it exactly as the recipe said, minus the mozzarella because I didn't have any on hand.  I'll definitely make it again.

Good way to brighten up boring cube steak.  I used store bought sauce and also substitued panko for the crushed crackers (didn't have any saltines).  Pretty easy to prepare.

This recipe was great. I used round steak that I pounded thin. Used panco bread crumbs I had in the freezer. After I browned the meat I baked them in the oven for abot 30 min to make them tender. I will  make this dish again.

Made this last night and my hubby and 4yr old loved it!  I used pizza sauce and a little bit of tomato sauce.  Added my own spices to it to jazz it up.  Put it over low carb elbow noodles!  This is definitely one I'll remake!

After reading all the 5 Star reviews I decided to try it.  Apparently most of your reviewers were able to get more tender cuts of Cube steak.  I followed the recipe using 4 cube steaks but substituted jarred pasta sauce.  The meat was extremely tough. I will use the last two cooked pieces by scraping off the cheese and  grinding them up for a pot of chili tomorrow.

This was easy to make and tasted delicious.  My only complaint was that the cracker breading got mushy when the sauce was added.  If anyone has tips on how to keep it crunchy that would be great.  Followed directions exactly.  One note, where it said to grease the baking dish, I used softened butter to grease the pan.

This was very good.   I used italian bread crumbs and after browning, covered the meat in marinara sauce, as per some of the previous suggestions. Covered the dish with foil and baked at 300f for an hour. Covered with mozzarella cheese then placed under the broiler for 5 minutes. Served this with some chilli spaghetti pasta and broccoli...easy meal with a lot of flavor, was well enjoyed by everyone.

I used this recipe and thought it was great. I never follow recipes to the tee, I use recipes as an idea. I always add a little bit of my flavor to it, theres nothing you can spice up. The tomatoe sauce is bland sure..if you leave it bland, you can always add some extra oregano, parsley, garlic salt, basil, allspice, and anything else you think would go right with it,which is what I done. My sauce came out awsome both me and my husband loved it. I used some angel hair pasta and added a little extra virgin olive oil and parsley just for added flavor..I also didnt add my mozerella untill I baked the steaks a little with the sauce.

Nothing wrong with the recipe, but apparently I still hate cube steak. This did not provide the magic necessary to make cube steak not a strangely textured meat. With that said, I too used jarred sauce but did everything else according to the recipe. To people who used the pre-shredded mozzarella--oh you're missing out. The kind you buy in a brick and cut yourself is about 5 billion times tastier and, in all likelihood, makes this recipe 5 stars (if you like cube steak anyways.) My husband ate both our steaks so nothing was wrong with the recipe...we'll try it again with chicken and see if that suits me better :)

This was very good. Just like chicken parmesan except with beef. I used panko  and italian bread crumbs instead of crackers. I used a jarred red pasta sauce for the sauce. It was very flavorful. Will definitly make again.

This was a great recipe. Usually I make cube steaks with gravy and mushrooms but this was a fresh tasting change. I confess to using the recipe as inspiration rather than following it step by step, but I really wouldn't have had the idea without this. Like a couple of other reviewers, I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs to bread the steaks, and prepared spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce directions (red wine and herb variety, which was perfect with the beef.)  However, other than that, I followed the recipe pretty directly. I don't think covering the steaks and sauce with foil would be a good idea because the breading would get mushy/soggy. I needed a little more time in the oven with the sauce and cheese to heat things through and get the cheese to bubble a bit -- roughly 10 mins or so. We served this with rigatoni and some more of the jarred sauce and a veggie. I need to up my iron in food and usually like chicken best, and this made beef very tasty and appealing to me. Thanks for the great idea.

This was so good! It tastes very much like veal parm, but I don't eat veal, well I haven't for many many years.I did use italian style breadcrumbs,instead of saltines and fried in olive oil instead of vege oil.Also used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce,I wanted to keep them somewhat "crispy" poured around steaks after 1/2 hour. Topped them with the 5 cheese shredded italian cheese blend.SERIOUSLY a great recipe on the cheap$$! I will make this again and again.Thanks!!

I marinated my meat in vinegar/water for hours before I cooked this and it was still so incredibly tough that we couldn't even enjoy it.  Won't try this again.

This is an excellent recipe, I made it tonight and everyone loved it, there are no leftovers. I do agree with one of the other ratings of having leftover tomato sauce, it would have been fine with just a cup instead of 1 1/4.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had no mozz. cheese on hand so I used colby/jack and it was very good.  I will be using the breading portion of recipe for other things, it worked great, did not stick to the pan, just to the food! Thanks.

Husband liked better than me--he said it was a definte keeper! But I did think it was good.  May try italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines next time.  Needed more saltines.  Like sauce flavor, if want enough to serve over noodles, double it.

If you and your family enjoys cube steak this is delicious.  I loved it and gave it 5 stars.  Unfortunately my husband and daughter do not like cube steak. It was a waste of time fixing it for them. Of course, there was more for me!

I tweeked this recipe a little bit..... I used italian style bread crumbs, and my favorite jarred sauce. That is the only thing I changed. 
This is a delicious change of pace for dinner. I always wondered what to do w/ cube steak :) I will make it again for sure

My family loved it, even my 4 year old said "Yummy Mommy".  My husband is not a fan of tomato sauce, so I left it off his piece of cube steak and he said it wasn't dry at all.  Definately one of our favorites.

This was not a hit at our house tonight.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and baked, covered with foil, for an hour, but the meat was still not tender and the flavor was not great.  I was asked not to make this again.

What a wonderful way to use such an inexpensive piece of meat! I now use this often (I cook for 5, and am requested to bake this often) Thanks!

I have never had Cube Steak this way and all I have to say is Yumo!! My whole family loved it. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers and served it with  whole wheat spaghetti. I will be making this again.

Yummy!  I used store bought sauce to speed up the process.  Great recipe for a meat that sometimes can be not so great!

This was good and different. The cube steaks became very tender which was nice. My son pointed out halfway through dinner "this tastes strangely like a meatball hoagie", and he was right! In a good way though. I used jarred spaghetti sauce and served with a side of pasta.

This was a good and simple idea for a different spin on cube steak.  I'm not a cube steak fan, and it didn't miraculously turn me into a fan, but it was better than I've had it other ways.  I did like how the steaks were cooked first and then the sauce spooned on after they were mostly done.

I was searching for some unique way of cooking cube steaks that I got on sale and stumbled upon this recipe.  It's okay; I enjoyed the chicken fried steak recipe that I got off this site much better.

Wow!  Great dish that even my daughter (who does not like anything to do with tomatoes) loved.  I would suggest being ready to use more breading ingredients than called for, especially if you have almost 2 lbs. of steaks like I did!  Jarred marinara worked just fine, and I also followed others' advice, baking for 15 minutes first, then another 20 after adding the sauce and cheese.  We'll be trying this again soon using chicken breasts.  Thanks!

Very good!  I did change one thing.  I used fancy spaghetti sauce that was premade to put over the meat instead of mixing up the tomato sauce and spices.  Easier and very good.

The steaks had a great flavor and my family loved the change from the normal cube steaks.  I used the spaghetti sauce from a jar as suggested from other reviewers.

We loved this at my house.  The only way I knew how to fix Cube Steak was to fry it and make gravy.  This was easy to follow and a great basic recipe so it's easy to make changes to fit your family.  But now I have a new problem what do you serve it with?  LOL  :)

I use cube steaks to make my moms rouladen and happen to have a package leftover in the freezer. I was so happy to find this recipe because I don't have very many recipes that call for cube steaks. Other than adding more seasonings to the cracker mixture, I didn't change a thing. And yes, using the steaks really are the point. They can readily be found packaged in your local grocery store. Thanks so much for a great dish!

This is an easy, quick and tasty meal.  To cut down on time, I used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  Also used shredded cheese instead of slices, because that's what I had in the fridge.  I've tried this recipe with the cracker crumbs and I've also done it replacing the cracker crumbs w/ bread crumbs and I like it both ways.  Served it with corn, rotini pasta and garlic bread.

My husband loved this.  I used my air fryer to brown the steaks instead of frying in a pan. I lightly sprayed each breaded steak on both sides with olive oil and air fried them 4 minutes on each side @ 360º F.  I did the rest of the cooking as described in recipe.

This was more trouble than it was worth as far as being part of the regular rotation.  It was good though and I'll make it again some day.  I did have to omit the garlic due to an allergy and next time I'll up the spices (cayenne?  paprika?) to compensate.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste.  Turned out so yummy!

Made this with venison. As I often do, more tomato sauce and more mozzarella is always good. Steaks were wonderfully tender.  This was served over a bed of angel hair pasta for mighty fine looking presentation.

As usual, I made a couple of small tweaks (red pepper flakes and diced roma tomatoes).  Served over veggie rotini (buttered with garlic powder, onion powder, basil, oregano, and parmesan).  Very tasty.

I really am not a fan of chicken fried steak, but we have TONS of venison steaks in the freezer that I had to use up. Also, we're in the process of moving, so I was looking for something pretty quick and easy, filling, that would use up ingredients I had in the fridge. To save time, I used the opened jar of our favorite spaghetti sauce that was in the fridge and Ritz crackers instead of saltines. It was still really yummy! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great idea!

I made it exactly as outlined in the instructions.  My husband said that it was very good.  So it is a keeper.  I found it tasty myself.  Nice alternative to chicken which my husband is not crazy about.

Excellent way to prepare cube steak! I only coated it in egg and crumbs fried it, then baked it for 15 min by itself and another 20 in sauce. Then a few minutes with cheese. Very good!

KEEPER ... Love this recipe, thank you. Everyone asked me to make it again. Since I like my cube steak tender I used a few suggestions from other reviewers,  After pan frying I left the steaks in the pan and poured the tomato sauce mixture over the cube steaks, covered the pan and turned the heat to low, simmered them for 25 minutes. My changes to the sauce were as follows, 16 ounces tomato sauce, 1 TBSP ssugar, 1/4 cup water (for tenderizing the meat) and 1/2 teaspoon Tuscun style Italian seasoning , McCormier Gourmet Collection (from Costco). I omitted the oregano and did not top the cheese with oregano either. I will try topping the cheese with 1/4 teaspoon next time to see how I like that.  Served over penne pasta spooning extra sauce and Ceasar salad on the side.

Very First Review!  
"Please make this again" is what I heard after making this recipe!  I had been "very concerned" before trying this recipe, because a friend (restaurant chef), had made cube steak two nights earlier with less than favorable results, utilizing a different recipe.  My only adjustment was to use panko breading in place of saltines. What an Outstanding result!  Definitely going into my Favorites...& also to my "cheffy" friend!  Give it a try, you'll LOVE it!

This was EXCELLENT!  My husband and kids gobbled it up.  Instead of making the tomato sauce, I used part of a jar of organic marinara sauce to spoon on the steaks.  The leftover marinara was served with spaghetti squash I made to accompany the meat.

I like trying new recipes with the freezer full of venison I have each fall.  This recipe looked good enough to gamble making a double recipe...and it was delicious!  I'm giving it five stars even though, like many other reviewers, I think using the tomato sauce originally recommended is too bland and flavorless (I tried the sauce before putting on the cutlets).  Either make your own marinara or use a store bought sauce and you'll have a restaurant worthy dish.  I used a combination of italian breadcrumbs and panko for breading.  I like that this dish would be good with whatever sauce you have on hand as well as whatever breading and cheese you have on hand.  
I did cook a bit longer than specified; 30 minutes and 10 minutes and the cutlets were fork tender perfect.

This came out so tender and juicy, my husband was asking me to make it again the next night!

I regularly make this, and if I'm in a pinch, I used premade sauce to top the steaks.

I used this recipe for the first time and my family loved it: even my 16 year old son, who is a picky eater! I did change a few things as well: I didn't use any type of crumbs, and I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. It turned out great and was easy to cook as well! I will definitely be cooking this again!

This was good and different. The only thing I thought was that the steak was little dry, but my bf didn't, he thought it was tough, which I disagreed with. I love the concept, but not sure I would make it again.

I agree with other posters--this is a really good recipe, but very poorly thought out.  I tried covering the dish with foil, as other posters suggested, but my meat was still chewy.  I would double if not triple the cracker mixture to get a better coating for the meat.

This was delicious! My husband AND my 2 year old were raving about how good this was and wished for more! The only thing I will change next time is using more of the cracker/Parmesan mixture. It was barely enough to cover 4 steaks as stated by previous reviewers. Other than that this recipe is awesome!

So easy, yummy & affordable!  Was gonna be lazy and use pre-made sauce, glad I didn't.  This sauce is easy to make. Followed exactly except doubled the breading amount.  Will cook this again!  THX!

This was super freaky gooood! It tastes like a dish served in a restaurant. The only tweaking I did was at the end I added shredded parmesan after spooning sauce on top instead of grated parmesan. I served it with Pasta e Olio, salad and garlic toast. Perfect meal!

Making this recipe tonight.  I used Vinta herb and garlic crackers, instead of saltines.  Through in some crushed tomatoes in the crock pot and then added the browned meat with garlic and topped with more parmesan.  Smells great!!  I love to use Epicure spices to all my meals.  Thanks for posting!

A great alternative to normal baked steak with gravy.  The steak was tender enough that only a fork was needed.  Everyone who tried it liked it.

Instead of using saltine crackers for the breading, I used crushed garlic croutons for the coating.

This was really good.  I did make my own speg. sauce as my family really loves my sauce.  I floured, breaded (italian breadcumbs/pram cheese) and fried for a very short time.  I put mine in an large cass. dish poured the sauce on top and baked for 25 mins.  I did us sliced motz. cheese but think I will us shredded cheese next time so it is easier to cut.  my whole family liked this and will for sure make again.

Oh my goodness what a delicious recipe.  I was looking for something different and decided to try this recipe.  I cook for two extemely critical men.  My husband and my grandson.  They both kept raving about how deeeeeeelicious this recipe was.  It is one of their all time favorites.  I will be making it a lot, for home and pot lucks at church.  Thanks for making me a winner, once again.

Excellent recipe, very tasty.  Instead of using the tomato sauce concoction, I bought a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce to use instead.  I also put it over noodles.  It was a big hit with the family, my daugther told me I could make it again...

A hit with the entire family.  Everyone insists that I  make it again soon!  Only modification I made was using jarred pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce and herbs.

Made this for dinner last night and the  family loved it. I did change it up just a little bit; added some salt, pepper, garlic salt, & seasoning salt to the sauce for flavor and served it over spaghetti noodles. Thanks for a great recipe...definitely a keeper!

I will definitely make this again!  For the sake of time, I used what I had on hand.  I did as others suggested and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the cracker mixture and substituted jarred spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce mixture.  The end result was very tasty and a good alternative recipe for cube steak!

This tasted delicious!  However, it was a little tough.  I'd like to try it again, slow cooking the steaks in the tomato sauce and in a covered dish--or on the stove top.

Great way to use that meat in the freezer. Used crutons in place of the crackers. Places over a whole wheat pasta with a great cabernet sauvignon from Chile. We will do this one again. Enjoy

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I have made this a few times, and the only thing I changed was the serving size to 8 and I used pre-made spaghetti sauce to save time.  The key to this recipe is to buy good cubed steak, it makes all the difference in the world!!  A definite keeper in our house!

This was a great idea and a great way to use cubed steaks. Instead of the saltines, I used Italian style breadcrumbs and my favorite store bought sauce... It came out really good :)

This really good but a simple bypass is to just use jarred spaghetti sauce instead of seasoning the tomato sauce.  I also cook some egg noodles and serve the steak on top of it.

I gave this four stars because I think that the recipe sounds tasty. However, we didn't like the homemade sauce to go on it. My husband wouldn't even eat it without almost gagging. I thought it was bitter or something but could hadle it better than him. I think next time I will try it with a jar of spaghetti sauce.

Excellent! My family loved these. When grandma comes to town, they all wait for cube steak and mashed potatoes. I think this equally as enticing, if not more so!   I didn't have saltines, so I used spiced bread crumbs. And I used Ragu sauce instead of preparing my own. Easy and yummy!

Ok recipe for cube steak.  I will make again, but with chicken.  We just don't really like cube steaks, but the breading was delicious.   I did also use sauce from a jar, and that was very good.

I was looking for a different way to cook cube steak and one of the girls on the exchange suggested this one. It was very tasty. My husband and I both really enjoyed it. I didn't change a thing!

I had sirlion and wanted to make something.  I thought this recipe sounded interesting. It was definatley different, I am a chick parm girl and I think my mind said I was chewing chicken, buit my mouth was just chewing and chewing.  It came out medium well, We like medium rear, so it was just okay for us.  I will probably stick to my chicken on the future, but again it was "different".

I hate cube steaks (too tough) but I keep ending up with them as my husband's relatives have cows on their farm and they give us lots of meat. Every cube steak recipe I've tried is terrible but I'm going to try this one tonight. I'll update after my husband's verdict.  UPDATE: It was ok. still a little bland (husband said it didn't really have any flavor, I agree) but better than other cube steak recipes. I did what another reviewer recommended and baked them with the sauce on so the juices could penetrate and hopefully make less chewy. Didn't really work. Also, you need about double of the flour and cracker mixtures to cover four steaks. Unless you have tiny steaks, but mine were pretty big.

I've never been able to find a way to cook cube steak that was tender!  This is a keeper, and everyone in the family adored it, which NEVER happens.

This was delicious. I didn't think saltines sounded good, so replaced those with Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs. Even before we ate, it smelled awesome. We also just used a jar of spaghetti sauce and used sprinkled mozzarella instead of sliced. We served over whole wheat angel hair pasta - easy, cheap and actually fairly healthy!

I've only made cube steak a couple of times and felt the results were "ho-hum" at best. Recently, as things have grown more expensive, I thought I'd give this cheap cut of meat another try. I have made this twice since then. This has to be the most tender, and most delicious recipe for cube steak I have ever had. The only thing I changed was to use italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than the saltines and season the meat itself rather than seasoning the flour. Delicious!! Thanx!!

This was really good.  I was looking for something different to do with cube steaks and this is it!  I used seasoned flour/egg/breadcrumbs, and marinara sauce w/thick slices of mozzarella cheese.  I will be making these more often.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Good taste. Steaks should have been thicker that what I had.  I did cook the meat about an hour.  Would make again with thicker cube steaks.

was actually a lot better than i thought it would be since cube steak is normally tougher. I did cook it a bit longer and added more cheese but other than that I stuck with the recipe exactly. We will be making this again.

I decided to sprinkle salt, garlic/onion powder onto meat and let sit.  then i used egg/milk to dip into italian bread crumbs.  I baked as directed - but next time I will put in a casserole dish and have red sauce surrounding item to let it be a bit more flavorful.  For the most part happy w/recipe and would use again.  Very different change from the ordinary.

I have never used cube steak and for my first time I used this recipe.  The only adaptation I made was using a jar of spaghetti sauce and I added more mozzarella because we love it.  The dish turned out beautiful and delicious.  I served it over egg noodles with a tossed salad.  It was a great meal!

Really liked this recipe. The measurements on the flour and the crackers where a little bit off though. I had to add more of both. Overall this was very filling. I also severed it on a bed of seasoned white rice. Oh, and I also used 2 slices of mozzarella on each steak. Will make this again.

Also I knew my boyfriend would miss this meal so I under baked some of the meat and re baked it the next day just add some more cheese on the top and alittle more sauce taste just as good(I know I try a bite)..THIS is a MAKE again meal. Thank you for this one

This turned out very tough...I don't knwo if it's the cut of meat or the cooking method, but my kids did not like it.  I also was extremely salty.  I may use the coating for another recipe because it was fairly good and the reason I am rating this 3 stars and not less.

This was a good recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm not a huge fan of cube steak.  It's a little tough, and I think next time I might try a little different cut of meat.  The recipe was great, and it smelled really good when cooking.  Thanks for the idea.

I too used jarred sauce. This was GREAT. Very easy and very good. My one suggestion is that if you use thick steaks, to make sure they are cooked through. Some mine needed some additional time.

Cubed steak is cubed steak. It's cheap for a reason. This recipe does a good job of hiding that fact.

I had trouble with the frying part. The parmesan cheese stuck to the pan, and pulled off most of the "breading". This was more of a cooking error on my part, however.

Overall, very tasty...but a bit of work for just cubed steak.

Very easy to make and enjoyable! I did a little tweaking as I didn't have parmesan or mozzarella cheese on hand, I used a blend of Mexican cheeses I had and substituted Italian breadcrumbs for saltine crackers, was still very DELICIOUS!

I think Chicken Parmesan would have been better.  But, If you only have cube steak and want something different it's not bad.

This dinner turned out absolutely delicious!I improvised a little and used Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers and pasta sauce for the tomato sauce and it was still great.The cube steaks were so thick and juicy.

This recipe was so good!  I served it over angel hair pasta.  I just used store-bought spaghetti sauce instead of making my own and used Italian bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very easy and my hubby loves it!  My kids (who can be a little picky) liked it as well.  As other reviews have said, I did use a store bought sauce,it turned out nicely. My husband did say it could use a little more cheese, so next time I think I will add a bit more.  Thanks, it was yummy!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I tweaked it a bit to make it better. I used whole wheat bread crumbs (made in the food processor) instead of saltines and jarred marinara (not spaghetti sauce) to give it a richer taste. It turned out great; not as good as chicken parmesan, but a close second. It's a great way to use up some of the cube steak I have in the freezer.

Terrific recipe, a keeper. Substituted panko bread crumbs for the cracker crumbs. Next time I will add a bit more sauce to serve with thin spaghetti noodles. Everyone was salivating at the aroma emitting from the kitchen, and family loved it. Thanks for this homey, comforting recipe.

Made this with 'choice chuck round eye steak' or something like that but assembled mostly as directed with the exception of jarred spaghetti sauce and Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  Added sauce and swiss cheese (that's the kind I had around) after about 20 minutes in the oven and then baked 10 more.  Turned out kind of tough, certainly could have baked a bit less/browned in skillet for not so long but I think it was mostly due to the meat more then anything else.  Served over spaghetti and a side of mixed veggies.  Amount of flour mixture was perfect but 1 egg  (instead of 2)with a bit of water would have been more then enough, would also cut back a bit on the amounts for bread crumb (cracker crumb) mixture as there was a lot left over.  Great flavor overall and was very easy, will defiantly try again.  Might try as one reviewer suggested baking with sauce over it for  the whole time or most of the time at least.

This was a total hit in my house, super tender and easy too.  My husband isn't a big cube steak fan but I had some in the freezer to use up so I didn't tell him what it was at first, but by the end of the meal we both agreed this is a keeper.  I made a few changes: a) used light/wheat bread crumbs instead of crackers and mixed in a bit of ground flaxseed b) used olive oil instead and a healthy garlic/chunk tomato sauce so didn't need oregano or sugar c)slightly banged meat with tenderizer first. I got the oil hot to really crisp the outside first and had to bake for closer to 10 minutes to get the cheese really melted (I think the few extra minutes helped with tenderness)  You'd never know this was a "healthier" version!  Served over spaghetti squash.

I haven't ever cooked with cubed steak, but I started a nannying gig and had to cook them dinner with VERY limited ingredients in the house, this came up as one of my few choices through ingredient search (though I was forced to make a very modified version, same idea though).  I thought it was just OK but the family was blown away by the "restaurant quality."

I rated this simply because my husband loved it.  I used jarred sauce as well.  I do not really care for cube steak, but this was MUCH more tender than any other way I have prepared it.  Overall, I will keep this one around!

A great way to use tenderized round steak! I did have to double the amount of cracker/parmesan mixture. I also used fresh ground parmesan/romano mix.

I thought this dish was a very good use of cube steak!  I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce and on the steaks used equal parts saltines and italian breadcrumbs but I'm sure it would be just as good as is.

My wife made this last night.  She subbed in grated cheese instead of slices, Italian bread crumbs and jar sauce.  I'm really looking forward to the next time we have it!

Simple and delicious!!  I did not have saltine crackers, but I did have some Cheese Nip crackers.  They did very well and I also used shredded cheese instead of slices.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Everyone really enjoyed this one. Didn't change anything, but may use a little more sauce next time.

The first time I made this recipe, I couldn't find cube steak and used sirloin cut into strips instead... And I didn't like it at all - the breading was SO nasty and greasy, and it sank into the tomato sauce. I did, however, top the dish off with left-over cracker crumbs mixed with cheese, and I really liked that. Then I found cube steaks and made it again. I really can't say it made much difference - I just really dislike the texture and oiliness of the breading. Ah well. Thanks anyway!

Cheap and easy to make.  My family and friends loved it.  I will try seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the saltine crackers for more flavor next time.

I have 3 little boys and a picky husband and they LOVED this recipe. We had garlic bread,salad and corn.  The boys cleaned their plates and my husband gave me a compliment on dinner.

This recipe is so-so.  I chose to prepare it with chicken instead.  It would be good served over some spahgetti.

This was a terrific, tasty way to serve the dozen or so cube steaks we got with our 1/4 cow purchase last summer!

This was great.  I used a tin of crushed tomatoes, so there was extra texture, everything else was the same as the recipe.  Very good.

Wow!  This tasted great (my kids loved it!) and is a much more affordable option to veal parm.  I used Ragu instead of making my own sauce and it was just great too.  Thanks!!!!

This is good.  My daughter liked hers without the tomatoe sauce. Very good dish , would be great to place the steak ontop of some pasta.

Made this last night & it is a keeper.  Next time I would double the cracker mixture.  I didn't have any mozzarella cheese & used sliced swiss cheese & it was fine.
