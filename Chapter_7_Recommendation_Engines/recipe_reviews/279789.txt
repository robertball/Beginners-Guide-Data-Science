As the author of this recipe, it takes me back to my time living in Florida. I’m surprised the one complaint was about the beans, perhaps not all people know beans are a source of protein, in addition to the tuna.

Loved it, so simple with standard pantry staples.  I'd add capers, maybe next time.

Needs waaay more tuna.  Also why add beans, since this dish already contains a lot of carbs.

So delicious! Very fresh and easy to make. I actually used a whole can of beans and 15 oz of tuna.

This is delicious! I used a whole can of beans and I added olives. Next time I am going to use more beans and chopped tomatoes.

I didn’t have tuna in oil - so it turned out mushy, not flaky. We liked it and it was easy. Next time we will use grilled salmon and see if that is better.
