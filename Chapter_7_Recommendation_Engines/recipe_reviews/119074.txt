These burgers were well liked by adults and kiddos alike.  I did need to adjust the amount of ingredients to match the amount of ground turkey I had on hand.  I used ground turkey breast (white meat only) and fresh ground ginger.  I gave this recipe 4 stars as I think the fresh ginger enhanced the taste as well as kept the burgers from being too dry.  I also only rated this 4 stars as it is very misleading stating the burgers are 45 cents a piece.  Ground turkey is a lot more pricey than that!  A definite 'keeper' recipe, thank you!

We have made this recipe several times and it is really good, has a great flavor. I usually make the patties, then freeze them. Then they can be easily cooked on the George Foreman Grill for lunches, ect...

My family and I all loved these burgers!  I did have fresh ginger on hand so I used that instead of the ground.  I also added very small diced red bell pepper and red onion to the mixture (about 1/4 cup each).  I grilled them on the BBQ and they turned out great.  I did read somewhere that when grilling turkey burgers, you have to let them sit a while longer than beef, otherwise they tend to fall apart.  Thanks to that tip, mine didn't!  My 5 year old son even ate the leftovers reheated the next day!  Thanks for the recipe....it's going into our regulars!

Great,easy recipe.Lends itself to additional ingredients.The only change I made was to combine the egg white and soy sauce..and add it to the rest of the mixture. Combining the bread crumbs and soy sauce, makes a thick ,gloppy paste that does not mix  evenly. Try it!!

this is just like the burgers I grew up eating and have continously made the last several years for myself, friends and families. I use 1T of Aloha Shoyu, a thumb size fresh ginger, grated, squeeze the juice in as well, and 1 clove of garlic, minced. I only use 1 stalk of green onions, finely chopped. I add one whole agg and bread crumbs and gently mix. I spray the grill with PAM, never use butter. I let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes before I shape into patties. I usually get about 5 to 6 good size patties. Tonight I served this with rice (brown rice for me) and "Japanese-style sesame green beans," from this website!

I sort of doubled the recipe because I had a 20 oz package of turkey.

I used chopped green onions and fresh grated ginger. Also added a big more soy sauce.  I made 5 big patties. Maybe too big because they tasted mushy in the center and my one kid said it tasted like meatloaf.

Otherwise, this was good, not greasy like regular beef burgers. Will make thinner patties next time, though.

I used crushed french fried onions instead of the onion and bread crumbs and a whole egg.  They were moist, flavorful, and really good.  My husband said they reminded him more of mini meatloaves instead of burgers but I thought they were great.

I'm disappointed. These burgers are too heavy on bread crumbs, aren't juicy and are lacking in flavor.

These were excellent.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed up wheat-flavored Toasteds crackers.  Also I added some cayenne pepper, basil and cilantro, and I used one whole egg instead of just the white.  Turned out delicious.  Easy to make them more or less spicy according to individual taste.  Made them last night and I have leftovers which I'm eagerly looking forward to.

absolutely delicious, even the kids loved them.  Next time I may add a fresh slice of grilled pineapple as a garnish or topper for the burger.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe.

My kids liked these! My kids liked these! Yeah! My husband and I like garlic, so I doubled that. I did the preparation and he grilled them to perfection. He commented that they really stayed together well, which doesn't always happen with turkey burgers. We topped them with a pineapple ring which a favorite restaurant does. I'll be making these again.

If these were served in a restaurant, I would be excited to go back & order them again.  I made them into sliders instead of full size burgers.  They were so moist & the flavors were perfect.  My husband just told me "Those are so good, I could keep eating those till I lost count."  Thanks for helping me get such high praise!!

I enjoyed these burgers. I doubled the garlic and ginger and reduced the soy sauce. I also added sesame oil, chinese 5 spice powder and green onions. I cooked them on my grill pan and they had a smoky flavor. I served them will an asian slaw and hosin sauce. I will be making these again.

A decent turkey burger, but nothing incredible.  I did like the asian idea though, and will probably muck about with it myself until I find just the right solution.

Hot grill is the key - wonderful & moist!  Great with a touch of extra soy sauce on top after cooking.  Only modification I made was to add about 1 t. of dark sesame oil.  Added a nice depth to the already great ingredients.

These were great! I wondered if they would be good with traditional condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo) and they are. Different and really good.

Kind of unfair to rate since I didn't use bread crumbs or egg (dietary restrictions). Pretty decent, but I find that there are better turkey burgers on this site!

this was perfect for me and my sweet heart! always looking for something different with spice! I added curry and ground cumin and pan fried these suckers in sesame seed oil (highly recommend) which really kicked it up a notch and made them mouth watering! I look forward to having these again real soon!

DELICIOUS! We chopped up about a 1/2 C of peanuts and diced half a very small jalapeno pepper and added to the mix. The jalapeno was just enough to add flavor without the spice (we can't do the spicy stuff) and this recipe is outstandingly delicious. Serve on a baked ciabatta bun with a dash of mayo... yum!

We rarely eat ground beef now and needed a good turkey burger recipe.  We fell in love with this one since I first made it.  We follow the recipe exactly and they come out great each time.  Fresh ginger is a must and I can tell a difference between regular soy sauce and light (the regular gives more flavor).  I was skeptical of pan frying turkey burgers but they come out nice and tasty.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

These were awesome! I used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and just a bit more bread crumbs and they were very Asian-y tasting. I also separated the mixture and added red pepper flakes to half and it was more of a spicy Thai flavor. Those were my favorites! We put them on buns with spring mix, Sriracha & light mayo, avocado slices, tomato, and onion - waaaaaay better than any restaurant!

these were good. Next time I think I would add dry mustard and some teriyaki sauce in the turkey meat for some more flavor. thanks for the recipe!

Just tried the recipe for the first time, one change, didn't have onion so I used onion powder. Loved it.
First turkey burger i liked since trying turkey instead of beef.

I thought these were DEEE-LISH! The flavor was awesome and the texture was great! A warning to non-garlic fans, though: The garlic stands out. I loooove garlic so that was good. But my husband only likes garlic, and he was a little put off by how garlicky they were. But for me, it was perfect! :)

Actually used ground chicken for this--very very tasty, juicy and flavorful.  Even yummier on the reheat!  :)

These were surprisingly good! My picky teenagers and husband liked them also. We goofed and used a whole egg, but they were still great.

These burgers had a wonderful flavor and were a hit with my family.  I hate to waste so I just used the whole egg and the entire 16 oz pkg of ground turkey breast.  Grilled them instead of cooking in the skillet.  Definitely will make these again.

These patties held together very well, but the texture was on the mushy side and they were very bland.  Definitely need something "more."

LOVED IT!  I mixed everything together the night before and then cooked the burger the next day; it was so flavorful.  If you are expecting this recipe to coverup the taste of a ground turkey, you will be disappointed.  This recipe truly enhances the taste of the turkey and is delicious!

Great recipe. I am making meatballs (assuming turkey is meat) and combining with noodles and fresh veggies.  Love the "outside the box? idea to just simply apply different ethnic flavors.

I made a few changes.  I hate to cut up an onion for only 1 TBSP so I used 1 tsp onion powder. I used fresh ginger- and a whole egg.  I also added a TBSP of wheat germ and cooked them on the grill- they held up great! Different twist on old turkey burgers!  I took the advice of another poster and sauced up the burgers with SWEET CHILI THAI SAUCE- Really Good!  Used Belles Hamburger Buns too.

Followed the recipe except I sauteed the onions and garlic and used the whole egg.  They were okay, but they didn't have as much flavor as I thought they would... will up the amount if I make again.  Not bad for a burger, not great.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made them once for my husband, Mr. Beef, and he loves them so much he wants them for our Valentine's Day dinner tonight.  Very moist, flavorful and great without the roll.  I also used ground ginger and light soy sauce (I doubled the amount).

I am giving this four stars because I added alot more ingredients.  With the exception of the egg whites and bread crumbs, I doubled the amount of spices/herbs.  I also used 16 oz. of ground turkey instead of 12.  Additionally, I added 2 tsp. of Chineese 5 spice and 2 T. of chopped scallions. I also tripled ths soy sauce and used a premium brand...Tamari. It's a little more expensive then say Kikkoman's but it has more depth in it's flavor and therefore well worth it.

I added 1/4 tsp. of red curry paste to my husbands burger as he likes really spicy flavors.

I will definitely use this recipe, with my additions, again!

I tried this recipe on today and it came out great.  I even added carrots to the mixture and it was even tastier. I used my little chopper to mince my carrots, red onion and garlic.  I will be making these turkey burgers again!!! I cooked them on my Hamilton Beach grill and they turned out really moist!!!

Unanimous vote....This recipe is 5 stars!!!  I doubled the recipe as I wanted more than four burgers.  The turkey burgers are very flavorful, moist and juicy!  My son said "Forget the ketchup!"  :)  I do not eat fried foods often, but wanted to fry these burgers that way.  Excellent.  I served w/red beans and rice, salad and cornbread.

This is a definite winner in my home.

These are very tasty. I usually double the recipe and freeze them in individual patties. One thing I do is mix it and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before making patties. The flavors blend nicely and I find it easier to handle

I'm guessing Jeanette posted this probably in 2006 because turkey prices in 2012, especially here in small town Ontario, Canada, have shot through the roof over the past few years. Our barely over one pound packages of ground turkey retails for $4.50/lb. which makes enough for four not very large patties -- so roughly, each burger costs me $1.12 before adding any other ingredients. I no longer eat any cereal grain nor flour (nor bread) and I keep my intake of natural-only sugar to the barest possible minimum. I substituted with grated zucchini, gluten-free tamari sauce, chopped fresh parsley, and more garlic and onions.

I made these a week ago and they were delicious! My whole family loved them. I used green onion because I thought it fit better in keeping with the asian theme. I made 12 patties in all, cooked 6 and froze the rest. My husband was impressed even though they were turkey and not beef. Quite good!

These came out very nicely, followed the recipe exactly and I will make again just the same way.  I served on Focaccia bread with an assortment of typical burger dressings for a build your own experience.    Thanks for sharing.

It was good, just missing something. Maybe adding teriyaki sauce or something will heighten the Asian flavor. But still good. I used green onions and garlic powder and had them on english muffins with fat free cheese slices and lettuce.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight.  Follwed the recipe fairly closely, though I changed just a couple of things. Instead of an egg, I added a bit of peanut butter.  Salt and appropriate seasoning is necessary for ground turkey as it is very bland otherwise.  Added salt, onion powder, onion flakes and garlic powder. For a nice crunch, I added chopped water chestnuts (YUM!). Even though soy sauce is salty, these burgers would have been bland without more salt.  I used the George Foreman for the burgers and we loved them!  I used very lean ground turkey so the burgers did not shrink much and they were very healthy.  We topped our burgers with a bit of mayo-fresh green leaf lettuce and a bit of hot sauce.  Perfect! Next time I'm going to try a sweeter topping - perhaps mango, pineapple salsa.

This didn't change the taste of the turkey.  I am trying to get my family to like turkey burger as they don't like that after taste.  If you don't like the taste of turkey burger...this one isn't for you.  However, my son liked it.

These were okay.  Not sure if I would make again.  Nothing exciting about them.
