This is also the same recipe as Signature Pumpkin Pie which is also on this site. My youngest son and I made this pie together. Because I'm low on time and energy, I used a refrigerated pie crust. We mixed the pie filling in my Kitchen Aid mixer, it was less than five minutes to make it. We followed the recipe exact. This pie was done baking at five minutes before the fourty minutes was up. Gorgeous pie, VERY VERY good. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: For those of you who want a pie that tastes like pumpkin that's lightly sweetened, this one is for you.

I made this as a crustless pumpkin pie....just put the filling in a casserole dish and baked it.  Topped it with whipped cream while still warm....quick, easy and tasty!

SUPER EASY!!! Try with vanilla and cinnamon to taste if you don't have pumpkin pie spice. "Or don't want to spend the $4 it cost"

Made this pie twice now- once for a party and again for roommates by request. It is super easy and by far the most delicious. I'm a terrible baker and you know when I don't screw it up, it's easy!

This was super easy to make and when it was completed and I took the first bite. Wow!!!
It is not overpowering like other recipes that taste too much like pumpkin. Topped the pie with homemade whipcream. Devine!!
I love this recipe and it is saved!!

I have made this many times now and will again many times more, thank you!
The only change I sometimes make is to add one extra egg to make it easier to serve as a crustless pie. I have made it with both canned and fresh pumpkin and it is great every time!

I had all the ingredients but only had 12oz of sweet milk and 15oz pumpkin AND couldn't find my pie dish so I had to use a springform pan. But it actually turned out fine!!!

My aunt loves to bake and suggested that we make pumpkin pie with my 5 year old grandson. We needed a simplified version so we turned to Allrecipes. The pie was delicious and it was nice spending time in the kitchen with family.

I made this as my first pumpkin pie ever. It turned out fantastic!! If you like more spice, use more....this is just so easy it's foolproof AND DELICIOUS! Go ahead & use a premade crust to increase convenience to maximum.

This was really "so simple" couldn't believe it!  Made it for Thanksgiving was a hit.  Then made it for Christmas Eve BUT used two cups of butternut squash.  It was delicious too.  Why buy a frozen pie when this is "so simple".

My family loves homemade pumpkin pie and this one was delicious.  Also, very easy to make.

Very simple pie to make. Not terribly sweet. I sprinkled a couple of tablespoons of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top for a change. This would be a quick and easy dessert when you don't have much time.

I added a little more pumpkin pie spice when I made it for Thanksgiving (first time baking for the in-laws!). It was easy and came out great and was almost completely gone by Friday.  It stood up well in comparison to the store-bought pumpkin pies others brought.

This is so super easy.  I even forgot to put the eggs in this recipe and my family still loved it.  Next time maybe I will add the eggs for additional protein but not sure I will bother.  The only thing I might do is add more pumpkin pie spice next time but that's certainly not necessary.

I had to add lots of extra time. 15 at 425 degrees and 50 at 350 degrees. Just took my first bite with a little whip cream and yummy!!! Thanks! Keeping this one in the books!

My family doesn't like the traditional pie crust, so I always use a prepared graham cracker crust.

The cooking time was a few minutes longer (about 10) but the reward is well worth the wait. Delicious!

I found this recipe a year ago after trying out several on this website - this is by the far the best.  It is simple and quick to make.  My advice though is to buy a deep dish 9" pie crust as you will have leftover if you use a regular one.  Beware too - there will be no leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

Such a simple yet delicious pumpkin pie! This was my first time making a pumpkin pie and I went in having some doubts since it seemed too easy. Personally, I found that the flavor was much better the day after I made it than a few hours after (tasted too much of pumpkin at first). Will absolutely be making this again!
