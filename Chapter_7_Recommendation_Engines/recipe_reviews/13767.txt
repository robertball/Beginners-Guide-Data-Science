These need to be baked for about 1/2 the time.  They were delicious but a little overbaked.  Next time I will make sure to bake them for just 15 minutes.

These Bites are sooo yummy but very addictive. Not too healthy either. They are so good they should be made year round. Very easy.

My husband really liked these but the kids didn't like it and I tried to like it but couldn't. They weren't bad but they were extremely rich and maybe I am not a pecan person. Because they are so rich, I can't imagine eating more than a couple at a time.

I loved this recipe. I added 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and sprinkled cinnamon into the bowl. I also only cooked it for 18 min.

These are awesome and easy to make.  Four cups was about a pound for me. I made half a batch with regular sugar and half a batch with Equal Spoonful.  The Equal half wasn't sweet enough.  Made it with margarine and it tasted great - I can't wait to try it with butter!  I am making more tonight.  I tried this on the quick release aluminum foil but it didn't work so well - the butter needs to cook and dry up and it only does that on the regular aluminum foil.  Also, don't skip the roasting - the pecans are 'juicier' than almonds and need the extra time to crisp up - I made that mistake this Christmas! (2013)

I have been making these for the last 4 years.  Anyone who likes pecans LOVES this recipe!  These are good as a snack or added to salads.  I have had lots of friends and family members over the years ask me to bring these to get togethers.  This will continue to be a staple for me over the holidays.

Yummy!!! I've been making these for three years for my family and friends. Everyone that has had them becomes addicted to them, to the point that they request them repeatedly.  I highly recommend them.

Perfect, easy pecan recipe. This would be great for gift giving... but watch out that you don't eat them all while packaging them up, they are extremely addictive!  I love them!

I had a tray half filled with the pecans, and half filled with plain cashews.  The cashews went untouched, and these were gobbled up.  My father in law told me they are "Sinfully delicious".

this was a great tasting recipe. i used the pecans to top an eggnog cheesecake and they worked great. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is that it is very messy and a lot of elbow grease was needed to clean my pan afterward. i will still make these again and they are quite tasty to eat alone while u are cooking the rest of dinner!

Wsa trying to replicate some vanilla coated pecans I had at a ZestFest this past weekend so I added vanilla extract. I lined my baking sheet w/ parchment paper before melting the butter & clean-up was a breeze. These were good but not quite what I was looking for. My hubby loves them though & I know my father will enjoy them....thanks!

I have made this every Thanksgiving for the past few years and my family LOVES it!  I serve it with the appetizers, while everyone is waiting for the Turkey.  It is always gone before the day is over!  I thoroughly recommend this recipe – the nuts are highly addictive.

I've made these for the past two years at Christmas.  I give them as gifts to the people who already have "everything".  I put them in a mason jar and decorate the lid with material and ribbon...and I make extra for my husband and I to snack on..very yummy!

Truly wonderful!! I found this recipe on the website last year and make them year round.  Even those who don't like nuts are hooked once they try them!

This was great!  Everybody loved it.  I have a feeling I'll be making this throughout the year, not just for Thanksgiving!

UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS!!  I made them for company and had to hide them from my husband;  now I need someone to hide them from me also!  They are delicious to have on hand during the holidays and will make an excellent food gift.

These didn't turn out well at all for me.  I cooked them for the time specified and they ended up crispy and burnt tasting (although they smelled great while they were baking!).

THESE ARE SO GOOD!  Last year I made these and took them to a Christmas party for a Chinese Christmas present thing we did...They were fought over and kept on getting stolen.  I just made them again for this Christmas and I need to go buy more pecans they are so stinking good!
Also I cooked them exactly as stated (except I roasted mine at a higher temp accidentally) and mine didn't burn at all. Every time I have made them they haven't burnt, you do have to make sure you give them a good stir every 10 minutes.  I have also used 2 totally different ovens (I got a new one in April) and yet never had a problem.

I just made the "FROSTED PECAN RECIPE" and I think that I may have a soulution to making sure that the recipe doesnt burn when your trying to bake it in the oven, you can always try soaking the pecans in water before going ahead with the origanal recipe. Or if you find anouther liqid like water, with taste and do the same then you may be able to add a little bit of flavor to your recipe as well
