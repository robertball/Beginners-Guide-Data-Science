This was absolutely delicious and SO easy to make! I did leave out the ginger because of a good friend's allergy, but all of my friends (at three different parties!) loved this dip! I served it with Snyder's Honey Wheat Sticks (shorter, thicker, and less "glossy" than regular pretzels), which were great since they were maybe a little better at picking up the dip, and tasted great with it. I think this would also be great as a spread on a turkey sandwich, or even as a side at thanksgiving. The kids liked it the same as they like applesauce!

This is for the sophisticated palate. Sweet and savory and a great companion to pretzels. My family loves it. I would serve this at a party or wine tasting but not at a backyard bbq. It is easy and inexpensive.

Tasted like cranberry sauce...wouldn't necessarily call it a dip.

I didn't really like the recipe as is. I had to add more sugar!!! It tasted soo much better! Not really sure I would use this as a pretzel dip though! Maybe more like a spread or something!

I had clipped this recipe from the newspaper several years ago and finally got around to trying it.  It came out a beautiful red color, but the taste wasn't anything to rave about.  My guests barely touched it, so I won't be making this again.

I have been making this for years!  It’s always a hit at any holiday get together.  I’m asked for the recipe all the time.

This is one of my favorite foods, and it can be virtually calorie free if you make the cranberry sauce with something like stevia as I do.  Since this dish is not as popular with the masses as it is with both me myself and a few of those close to me, I have learned to freeze it in small batches so that I can bring small'sh portions of it to any gathering where I need to watch calories while others are not as inclined to do so.  I make the cranberry sauce in a saucepan, add the rest of the ingredients and blend it with a blender wand rather than straining out the skins and etc.  Couldn't be simpler.  It is also especially good with celery and turnips (ah, there it is, you can tell that I don't have a typical taste for food as compared to *most* other Oklahomans.... *cheshire grin*).  Anyway, try this!  If you like it, it might be one of your favorite foods as well.  I'm certainly not the only one who eats this when I serve it, though my husband prefers cranberry salsa (ah, yes, the chips thing...., he does love his tortilla chips.......).  I have thought that this might be appreciated more widely if it was served as a layer dip with sweetened, low-fat/no-fat cream cheese (perhaps with orange juice concentrate or perhaps some dried orange rind), topped with some nuts.  It might be well received that way with some triscuits or shortbread type cookies and apple slices?  I'll try that sometime and try to remember to let you know how that went!

I used this recipe for sausage balls that I made using Jimmy Dean sausage (you know, with cheese,Jiffy baking mix, etc.) It was exactly what the sausage balls needed..that sweet component. I used whole berry cranberry sauce which worked just fine. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Excellent! I wouldn't ever make the sausage balls without this sauce again!
