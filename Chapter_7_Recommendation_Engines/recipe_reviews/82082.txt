Interesting flavor with the fennel seeds and soy sauce, very non-traditional.  I ran short of BBQ sauce for a slow cooker pulled pork recipe today, so I made this easy sauce, and used about 1/2 cup to top off off the pork.  I think this would be outstanding on ribs or even grilled pork chops.

I made this for my family and they loved the sauce. The only thing I did different is I added extra brown sugar.
