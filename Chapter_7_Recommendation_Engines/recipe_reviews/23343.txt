Have been using this recipe for years and decided it was time I thank David for publishing and sharing.  David, I'm a professional chef/caterer, and there's no better authentic pastitsio than this recipe, right down to the red wine vinegar.  It's perfect the way it is written.  For those of you who change it until it's unrecognizable, and then review it, shame on you.  Prepare it the way it's written, and if you want to change it drastically ---- publish your own recipe, don't review this one.

Delicious!  My husband loved this recipe.  I used extra lean hamburger and skim milk in the white sauce and it didn't taste like I'd used anything low calorie.  Very good!!!

My husband and I loved this!  I have made many pastitsio recipes before, but this one is my favorite.  I loved the taste of the fresh tomatoes in it.  At first I was leary about even trying this recipe.  First because I thought it was going to be a hassle to peel and seed the tomatoes, but that was easy.  Secondly because of the chili powder.  I just thought how greek does that sound?  But I made it exactly per the recipe and am so glad I did.  seriously, this is good.  Thank you!

It was delicious!  My kids loved it - I would probably make extra white sauce though.

This comes pretty close to the pastitsio I used to get at a neighborhood restaurant that closed.  I make more sauce than the recipe calls for, but the flavor is very good.

This dish turned out to be very tasty! We had Cat Cora's Pastitsio at her place in Disney World but the recipes I had found were all for too large a number of servings for my family. This looked interesting and I had most ingredients on hand so we gave it a try. Turned out very good. Changes I made due to my pantry were: I used a shredded combo of mozzarella and parmesian for the cheese, canned diced tomatoes, chicken broth instead of stock, and I was careful with the spices. I did not use chili powder- just salt and black pepper- and I started with half the amounts of allspice and cinnamon. Basically spiced to taste until I got it where I liked it. I will make this again!

This is definitely a keeper. I added the spices to taste, and it ended up being about half of each of what the recipe calls for.

I thought the entire dish was good except the white sauce was very bland.  This recipe is good enough to keep, but I won't make it with the white sauce again.

Due to reviews, I decided to make this in two stages: by cooking the meat and the pasta ahead of time and then assembling the next day for dinner. Even with trying very hard to consolidate dishes/utensils, this still generated quite a bit of dishes and clean up. Was it worth it? Yes... but.... just for "occasionally". This has a very unique flavor from the cinnnamon, allspice, and the two different sauces. Hubby and I enjoyed it very much:our teen not-so-much. We have had Pastitisio before, and don't recall it having cinnamon in it. Although very good, I think I would prefer to substitute oregano and nutmeg instead for the cinnnamon and allspice.

Absolutely great! Plus, by using fresh ingredients, the calories are about 1/2 of the other pastitsio recipies. But, just because it's lower-cal, doesn't mean it sacrifices -anything- on taste. This pastitsio is incredible... even my picky 5 year old liked it.

My husband and I had been looking for a good Greek restaurant to no avail, so i decided to cook this instead! Husband loved it, I thought it was way too much cinnamon and allspice. There is a lot of clean up, but the way I cook every night, it was no different than any other dish I make that doesn't come from a box!

Don't skip the cinnamon - they have discovered that cinnamon in the diet is excellent for lowering cholesterol.  I specifically went looking for a recipe with the cinnamon, as it is more authentic with this ingredient.

Fabulous! I no longer have to go to a Greek restaurant for my favorite dish! Only changes were based on what I had on hand, since I made this on a whim -- canned diced tomatoes and cider vinegar instead of red wine. Oh, and added about a half teaspoon of oregano to the meat, and just a bit of nutmeg to the white sauce. I might make more white sauce next time -- not because there's anything wrong with the proportions as-is, but because I really have a "thing" for custards. :) Absolutely fantastic!

This dish is aromatic and flavorful. Romas didn't look that good so I substituted a large can of petite diced tomato instead.  I also doubled the recipe and froze half to be baked later.

Very good!  I made as written with the addition of 1/2 tsp. salt in each the meat and cream sauce.  I will increase the salt a bit more in the cream sauce next time (just to make it perfect! :-).  This was a dry run before committing to making this for a party.  Will check back in afterward with guest comments.

This was a hit at our Christmas feast & much appreciated because I was able to make a day ahead of time & just pop in the oven on fest day.  Probably better this way as always the flavors melded together

First, let me list my omissions, additions and substitutions, because I took the lazy route with this dish.  I substituted regate penne for elbow macaroni to make it more authenic; I omitted the roma tomatoes, onions and garlic and used a 14.5 oz canned of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic instead; I omitted the chicken stock and red wine vinegar and used a quarter cup of Boulder brewery Mojo IPA (although there are lots of other beers anyone use); I added 1/2 teaspoon each unsweetened cocoa powder and garlic salt to the spices and I used butter instead of margarine. I had to boil the meat sauce down for twenty minutes or so, but that's O.K., I didn't have to heat up the oven because my 8x8 square glass pan fits in the toaster oven.  I rely heavily on my toaster oven in the summer to bake casseroles when I don't want to heat up the kitchen with my regular oven, and the main reason I chose this recipe over the others is because it yielded a smaller amount. Anyway, this was really easy, it turned out delicious, my husband loved it (much cheaper than going to the local Greek restaurant!) and I will definitely make it again.  The only thing I might do differently is use an ounce or so less pasta so it all fits a bit more comfortably in the pan.

Very good!  We all enjoyed it, but I don't know if it'll be a regular dish around here.  It is a fairly complex and time consuming recipe. A little heavy on the cinnamon/allspice.    Edited to add:  This was Horrible the next day!  The topping was actually disgusting.  Does not fare well for leftovers, so we will not be making it again.

Great stuff!  It was a huge effort, but my family liked it so it worked out.  They want to have it again, though it told them they'd have to make it themselves next time!  My biggest problem making this was getting the meat sauce to thicken - I cooked it for 40 minutes and it was still watery.  I ended up baking it a half hour longer which got rid of the extra water, which was three hours of cooking!

Excellent. I followed the recipe as written. Very flavorful. BF said it was much more flavorful than what he had at the restaurant. Thanks for the keeper. Ps- I thought it would be too much for the 8x8  square pan but it was perfect.

Authentic pastitsio uses ziti noodles, and I've never heard of some of these ingredients being in the pastitsio recipes I've made. It still tastes pretty good though to be honest, just not what I had hoped!

Very good!  I didn't have the fresh tomatoes, so I subbed a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes (1lb) and it turned out wonderful!  This is delicious!

The flavor of this was really wonderful!  I've never had pastitsio before so it was a treat to make this.  Had to sub penne as that's what I had, and canned diced tomatoes (I know...) but it was good.  This used a ton of dishes to make, but worth it.  I was a little leery when putting it together, but glad we tried this one.  My only real complaint is how the recipe was written...  Calls for salt in the directions and no salt listed in the ingredients.  Does not say to bake covered or uncovered (chose uncovered).  Also added a touch of salt to the white sauce, as my parm was not very salty and I used unsalted butter.  Will definitely make again, tho.

I've never had nor made pastitsio before, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I made this is exactly as stated (in a 9x9 dish).  Funny thing is I had most of the ingredients on hand already.  This turned out great! The leftovers were even good.  Time consuming to make, but I think it's worth it.

i have always wanted to try pastitsio and this was a great introduction! my favorite part is that it is a smaller amount than most other recipes i've seen. everything is delightfully seasoned and the white sauce on top had the perfect amount of creaminess!

Very good recipe for Greek Lasagna. If you want a change from the usual Italian lasagna, try this. Don't be afraid to use the extra cinnamon this recipe suggests to top with, either. 
I was out of milk, so I improvised with cream and water... 1 cup cream to half a cup water. Still came out beautifully. Also, used a can of well drained diced tomatoes rather than fresh. 
This dish has a much milder taste than traditional lasagna as well, so keep that in mind. It is still certainly worth experiencing :)

I used this recipe as a 'base' and made some changes that resulted in my Greek friends SMILING and asking for this to be added to the dinner rotation!!!!!!!!

I used Perciatelli instead of elbow macaroni.  I omited the plum tomatoes, red wine vinegar, chili powder and chicken stock.  I used 8 oz of pre-made marinara sauce.  I added 3 TBS of beer and cooked it until the alcohol was evaporated (didn't take long). 

With the white sauce I added 2 TBS of cream cheese and an additional 1/4 cup parmesean cheese. 

The results were CRAZYYYYYY good! ENJOY!

Mixed reviews at our house on this. I liked this a lot. It was something really different from our usual. I have never had patitsio before, so I cannot say whether this is really good for a patitsio dish, but I can say it is good whatever it is and I enjoyed it very much. My son and husband preferred I make this without the cinnamon and allspice. I didn't have roma tomatoes, so I simply used a large regular tomato, diced. I skipped peeling the skin. I'd like to make this one again. Thanks for sharing this so we could try it David.

Sorry, this wasn't for me. Those that are a fan of the traditional Greek dish may not like that I am only giving 2 stars. After all, I should have known it would have a different taste by the spices. But I had to give it a try.

The kids liked it, my picky 6 year old had 4 servings. 

It takes too much work though. You can read the recipe, but until you've actually made it you don't realize how much work goes into what seems to be a simple dish.

I thought to myself, after eating it...that I could make it real good by changing the spices and then adding some cheese on top. But why? There are so many other recipes out there to try. I think I'll just chalk this one up to experience. Thanks for the recipe, but it doesn't suit my tastes.

This was good considering that I did not know what to expect (never had pastitsio before). I used a basil pasta sauce because I did not have plain tomato sauce and a drained can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh.  Instead of broth, I swirled 1/4 cup of water in the tomato sauce jar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  It took me 1 1/2 hours to get this into the oven and completely destroyed the kitchen.  Was it worth it?  Eh...it was good, but not extraordinary.  I doubt I would do this again unless someone wanted me to.  If I did, I would double the sauce as others suggested and maybe swirl it around instead of just having it sit on the top layer.  Thanks anyway.

Delicious - This smelled fantastic while it was cooking (from the cinnamon) and tasted even better. I left out the allspice because I just don't care for it (who knows - maybe I'll try it with the allspice sometime and see what I'm missing), but I was still left with a dish that was to die for. I'll be keeping this recipe for a long time!

My friends claimed to like it, but I found it very bland.  I made it with ground turkey instead of beef, but that was not what caused the problem.  It needs more spices, but I am not a good enough cook to know what is needed.

Tasted just like what we get at  the annual Yiasou Greek Festival in Charlotte, NC.  I used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and no tomatoes as that is what I had on hand.

This is my favorite kind of comfort food!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the recipe mentions salt, but it's not in the ingredient list.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon to the sauce, and another 1/2 teaspoon to the milk custard.  Other than that, no other changes.  I nearly bought canned plum tomatoes in order to avoid the blanching, peeling, and chopping of fresh tomatoes, but I'm glad I stuck to recipe and used fresh.  This is a keeper!

I am vegetarian. I used mixed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, peppers) and soy protein instead of meat. And I used can of pasta sauce instead of stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce since this is such a time consuming recipe and I only have 45 min after returning from work to prepare dinner for my family. I have made it multiple times and it turns out great. I don't know how it compares to the traditional version. I am going to have my Greek friend taste it.

I've made it a few times with ground beef, and just now with ground turkey.  The turkey is still pretty good, but I think you need to add a bit more salt  and spices to make the turkey more flavorful.

This was a big hit at the potluck I took it to.  I loved the unique spices.  I doubled it and baked it in a 10x15 casserole.  The amounts were just right.  However, it dirtied just about every dish in my kitchen!  Worth it, but will keep that in mind.  The only thing I changed was I put all of the noodles in, then the meat sauce, then the white sauce - all the pictures showed it that way, and that is how I remember eating it in Cyprus.

Followed exactly and it was very good. Very similar to what my Yaiyia made when I was young. I only gave it 4 stars because it needs more bechamel sauce. Thnk you for posting, will def make again!

Was looking for something different well I found it. Really liked it and will do it again. As the one person commented about changing the recipe and then rating it I took that to heart so I have to say I did change it because of what I had in the house. Canned tomatoes is one thing I changed plus added onion to the white sauce. Think I would like to try a different noodle as another person added. Try it you will like it!!!

My family thought this was very bland the night I made it. I had some left overs the next day for lunch and it was even more boring. The only change I made was to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh which I know would have added a little bit more flavor. Because of the canned tomatoes though it wasn't as much work as I expected but I don't think I'll try it again.

I found that this was a little bland--I really like strong flavours--and would have added more of the spices. My husband and son liked it very much though.

I liked it, very tasty. but very involving. Definitely a meal to make when you have free time on your hands.

I'd give it a 3.5 if I could, as the sauce tasted quite good.  I made one change that didn't work well - I increased the amount of noodles, and it ended up quite dry and not saucy enough and the bechemel was too thin.  I also used a 9x13" pan (recipe didn't say what size square pan to use), and I a smaller casserole dish would have resulted in a more moist Pastitsio.

I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner with a Greek theme - it was a HIT!  I  had few leftovers from the two pans I made of it.  Even my 8 year old liked it.

Very good recipe. I did not have roma tomatoes so I substituted a can of petite diced tmoatoes w/ jalapenos' and it worked out fine and gave it just a little bit of a kick to it. I'll try it again with the right ingreidients.

DH loved this; I liked it quite a bit.  I didn't find it as complicated or as messy as others did.  I used 15 oz can of diced tomatoes, saving that step.  I did the white sauce in the microwave, which is always much easier (and less messy).  Subbed butter for margarine.  Next time, would add some salt to the white sauce.

Very very tasty.....but you better have your dish washer empty b/c it dirties a lot of dishes and it turns your kitchen into a disaster. If I had kids, I'm sure they would love this meal...it's really really good. It makes good leftovers too.

I would give this a 3, my husband a 5, so 4 is the average.  I thought this tasted like jazzed up baked ziti, nothing special.  I was also disappointed by the lack of cheese flavor (I used fresh grated parm, and 2x the recommended amount).  I have to admit I cut the red pepper to 1/4 tsp because I can't handle spicy foods.

I used ground lamb instead of ground beef in this, and other than that, I followed this recipe to a "T".  It was great.  I can't wait to make it again, although I think I will increase the amount of meat in it.  It could have used just a little bit more for my taste, just because it tasted so good.

This is "soul food".  The spices make it interesting, and even my fussy son enjoyed it. It was still great as leftovers!  If you are in a pinch you can substitute the fresh tomatoes with well drained canned.

Very different but in the best way.  I had never had pastitsio before but I love it!  The only modification that I made was I doubled the white sauce, but I only used 3/4 of it.  (I am very much a sauce lover)  However, I don't think the dish would've been any less wonderful if I had just left it alone.
