I loved the flavor and the dressing (s) for this salad - 5 stars! The construction of it is a little fussy and bizarre. I was making it, wondering to myself WHY I am making *thick* apple slices, and *thin* celery slices and trying to *stack* stuff?. I think it would be much easier to eat if you just make everything bite-size and toss it together, but what do I know?  I used cran-apple juice for my reduction because I didn't have actual apple cider and it was still lovely. Also, I bought chives to put on this and then forgot to use them. Duh. Otherwise I made this as written, using Stevia and Parmigiano Reggiano. Overall, wonderful salad - next time I'll chop my veggies my way. :)
