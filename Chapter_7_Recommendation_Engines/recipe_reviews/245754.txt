Very good and the family really enjoyed it! To us, it was more 'spicy' than 'buffalo-y', if that makes any sense. The flavor is good, though. Please watch while cooking this. I had it in for the first bake and checked it @ 10 minutes and it was getting pretty dark on top, so I took it out, mixed it and put it back in for another 10 minutes This was fine, but I think I could've baked it even a little less, but I'll keep a better eye on it next time.  . I guess it really depends on your oven, just a heads up.  Other than that, it was liked by all and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The flavor is great but needs to be cooked less. I had to pick out the burned pieces of the wheat Chex.

I have made this for many years I leave out the peanuts I don't like them and I bake at 225 for an hour mixing every 15 minutes.  This is very addicting.

very good mix. Baked at 250 for one hour, mixing every 15 minutes, and it dried out perfectly. it does seem to lose some of the Buffalo flavor in the baking though, but still spicy. I also used Hidden Valley spicy ranch mix.

Baked in the oven until crispy. I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce.  It still needs something....

I agree with the longer period at a lower temp suggested in the comments. Dries the mix out very well without burning it. I also recommend waiting a day or two to consume it. The flavors really gel together if you wait.
