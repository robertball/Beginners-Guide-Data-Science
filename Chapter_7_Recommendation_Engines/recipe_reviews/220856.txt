As the submitter suggested I made this in an Instant Pot® and the 50 minutes was spot on. I used the entire can of broth instead of adding the water. I couldn't wrap my head around the chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom. The only other suggestion I can make is maybe add more garlic. Nonetheless this is outstanding and it will go into my TNT folder.

only thing i did  different was add sauteed  mushrooms
the   recipe itself was good as written,  i dont use products from acan  but i followed the  recipe   and used them.  i like the full cut top round,  thats  what brought me here.  if you use a good marinade you wont have to tenderize the meat.   buy choice meat though,  look for marbling  not fat  but marble.

My whole family loved it and I will definitely make this again. I didn't change anything and cooked it in my Instant Pot and it was delicious! If anything I'd throw in some mushrooms next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Didn't care for it.  The seasoning the meat was browned in didn't seem to add any flavor.  The gravy was very watery.

I used convection oven on bake, so I overcooked it a little. Recommend 90 mins cook time.

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.   I browned the meat in a cast iron skillet.   Sautéed onions in drippings.   Added everything  else to the skillet to bring to a boil.  Then added everything to my power cooker for 45 minutes.   It was absolutely delicious

The Round Steak was tender and juicy and the gravy was delicious! Wish I had taken a picture of it so I could have posted it!

It was okay. The gravy wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be and next time I will substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken soup for some extra flavor.
