Very tasty, easy to make and allows each guest to have a nibble of cheesecake without the guilt of a full slice.  I used a no-stick flexipan and did not use the non-stick spray, but I had trouble removing the cakes from the pan.  Next time I'll use the spray.  I'll make them again.

I used the spray and it was removed without any trouble.  Very easy to make and delicious.
