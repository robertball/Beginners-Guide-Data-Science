This is my favorite Mexican night drink. I do have a bottle of chipotle tequila marinating right now though. I'm thinking chipotle margaritas?

I took a quick taste of this before I popped it in the fridge. Boy is it going to be good in Bloody Marys. Next time I'm going to try the raisins as noted in the Cook's Note on this recipe. I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
