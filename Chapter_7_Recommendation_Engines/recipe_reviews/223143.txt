Crisp and delicious!  I added a banana to keep them together more, which made a rounder, fuller cookie, instead of ones that spread a bit thinner like the photo.  I also did 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 white chocolate.  I used all 12 oz, although I agree with Joey Joan (previous reviewer) that you don't need all 12 oz.

Pretty good cookie. I substituted the flax seed for wheat bran and cut the butter to 1/2 cup with 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and the sugar to 1/3 of a cup. Still very sweet. Mine didn't melt though and I ended up flatening them with a fork.

A nice crisp cookie with a very good flavor. I only used about half the amount of butterscotch chips I think 12 oz would have been way to many.

I made these cookies but made two minor changes as I hate it when people rate a recipe based on their changes.  But the only changes was to sub out the sugar due to the fact that I have to carefully watch my sugar - so I substituted the butterscotch chips for dark chocolate and changed the regular sugar for Stevia.    Even with these changes I do not believe I changed the overall taste and the cookies were really, really good and since I love cookies - to be able to find one that I can eat that actually tastes good - I am in cookie heaven!!  I am making them again and adding in raisins, walnuts and unsweetened coconut to make them more of  a breakfast cookie.  Yum for me.

We substituted the vanilla for mapline flavoring, and used peanut butter chips instead of the butterscotch. We added 2 tbsp molasses since we used cane sugar and added about 1/4 cup water to help with moisture.

I LOVED these! They were rich, wholesome and filled with health! Did some changes though.. I did not have so much flax seeds so I added lightly roasted sesame seeds - grounded, reduced the quantity of sugar to just one packed cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of White, added some white chocolate chips and also a banana as I felt that the dough extremely dry. This moistened it and added a little extra flavour! The results were awesome! 36 cookies just vanished into thin air within a matter of minutes!  Thank you so very much!!  - TRUPTEE

Worked beautifully.  

I placed a pecan on top of each before baking, too.

Will make again.

Love 'em! ~ 1/2 c butter + 3 tbsp. applesauce and 1 tbsp. oil ~ 3/4 c brown sugar only plus 1/3 banana ~ 3 tbsp. ground chia seed for the flax, which I did not have. 
~ Try double/triple the chia next time ~  Robin Hood Nutri* flour blend ~
