Had to add a little sugar, but the fresh lime juice hits the spot on a summer night!

This recipe made a large pitcher of margaritas, but they were too tart to drink. I had added about 1/4 cup of sugar already, but it was still way too tart. I made a simple syrup with about a cup of sugar, added that to the finished pitcher, and that made this recipe very tasty. There is nothing better than margaritas made with fresh squeezed lime juice.

This is not a blended margarita. It's just a margarita with ice.

Skipped the "extra sugar" recommendations, and went with the recipe as is.  Triple Sec left it plenty sweet for our taste.
Served over the ice, instead of using cocktail shaker, which kept it cold for sipping on the deck.

I reduced the lime juice to 1/2 cup and it was alright, not great, but, alright.
