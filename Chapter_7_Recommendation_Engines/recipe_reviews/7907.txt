These muffins were not the best ones I have ever made, but they were surprizingly good for what little amount of time was required to make them, and for so few ingredients. I added a few of my own touches to it- applesauce instead of oil, 4 tbs. jam(strawberry) IN the batter, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract in the batter as well. It is important to let the muffins sit for about 2 min in the pan before taking them out so the jam will not spill out the bottom.
I drizzled a mixture of honey, vanilla, and red food coloring on the top of my muffins right after they came out. It really dressed them up.
I will make these again!

My mom used to make jam-filled muffins.  I hadn't thought about it for a long time, then I found this recipe today.  I halved the recipe so I could make 6 muffins in the toaster oven and not heat up the whole kitchen by using the big oven.  (It's August!)  I used half white wheat flour, Splenda instead of sugar, red currant and black currant preserves, and chopped hazelnuts on top.  When assembling the muffins, put a bit of batter in the bottom of the muffin cup, then add a dab of jam (not too much), then top with more batter.  Try to "seal" in the jam with the batter so it doesn't boil out.  Don't put in too much jam or it will boil over and burn and stick in the pan.

These were really good!  It's not an overly sweet, caky muffin, but a more traditional muffin that's slightly sweet.  (Like how scones are supposed to be only slightly sweet, not the icky cake-cookie concoctions at Starbuck's--too sweet!)  The real sweetness comes from the jam inside, all hot and melty.

Let the muffins cool a minute or two before you bite into it...keep the kids away for a bit, you know they're going to grab 'em right away.  The jam inside is HOT and you don't want to burn your mouth.

YUMMY breakfast muffin and super easy, with ingredients you have on hand.  It's a keeper!

everyone complained this recipe was bland.  I found the quick and easy solution was a small amount of chocolate chips. It was perfect!I used raspberry jam.  They were delicious and with 10 seconds in the microwave it was like they were fresh out of the oven.

I put the jam in the middle rather than just at the top. Next time, I would kind of lightly mix the more jam into the bottom half as this part of the muffin remains somewhat bland. I put sweetened flaked coconut on a couple of the muffins then put them all in at 350 for about 22-24 minutes.(These ones were the best!) I made them  medium sized by filling up only 7 muffins.  I would double this recipe and cut the oil down with some applesauce next time. Good basic recipe though-takes like 10 minutes to make!

Excellent recipe for a good breakfast muffin. While not extravagant, these muffins take little time to put together for fantastic results. I took the advice of Eminee and put the jam in the middle of the muffin instead of on the top. While the recipe is great as is, I'm now in the habit of adding 1/4 c more white sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to suit my personal preferences.

Excellent. Had to do them twice because i put the jam on top the first time and burnt it. Second time i put a spoon of batter in the bottom then the jam then the rest of the batter. Beautiful light and not too sweet. Im not particularly an experienced cook and this was an ideal easy recipe for me. Thanks

I loved this recipe! I am not a cook, but I know you have to make this your own.  It is a great basic recipe that you can have fun with.  I also mixed the jam into the better, next time I will add even more.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Jam melts off the top and gets stuck to 
the pan and on to the bottom of the over. 
Hard to get rid of and takes forever to 
scrub. That's the only problem with this
otherwise fabulous recipe!

I just whipped this recipe up in about an hour and a half, with all clean up and such. Here's the recipe I followed (from various readers input and what I had in my kitchen):      * 2 cups all-purpose flour     * 1/4 cup white sugar     * 1/4 cup brown sugar (plus some extra for topping)     * 3 teaspoons baking powder     * 1/2 teaspoon salt     * 3/4 cup milk     * 1 tsp. vanilla     * 1/3 cup applesauce     * 1 egg     * 2 tablespoons any flavor fruit jam  I also put the jam in the middle (as some suggested) and it was delicious. I think the best way to do it is to mix it in a tiny bit (marble it) with a fork. That way it doesn't bubble up as much. Before baking, I also sprinkled a teaspoon or so of brown sugar on the tops. Just plain brown sugar. It hardened and blended in during the baking, BUT it tastes delicious. Gives it an extra kick with a little crunch and some sweetness, to balance the batter (since the jam resided mostly in the bottom on mine).  These were very easy to make, and I had all the ingredients in the house, which makes it better. A little bit of jam bubbled up on the outside of my pan, but I just rinsed it under hot water, and scrubbed it right after I took the muffins out. It took maybe three minutes to clean, and wasn't that hard. Overall, this recipe is a solid 4. Tasty, but not amazingly outstanding. But I will probably make it again- it's easy and the men of the house seem to like it. =)  Thanks for sharing!

I forgot to add the sugar! Duh! That's why my muffins tasted so blah. Not the recipe's fault. I ended up with scones with the jam built in! I also added 1/3 cup dessicated coconut to the dry ingredients for extra oomph! Ah well, better luck next time.

We enjoyed these muffins. Because I have small children and I didn't feel like having a jam mess, I mixed the jam into the muffin batter right before putting in the muffin tin. You could taste it throughout the muffin, yum! Next time I will add 4 tbs of jam. I also subbed applesauce for the oil, because I was out of oil. I would have given these muffins 4 stars, but my picky kids enjoyed them so much that it deserves a 5!

Tasty and easy to make, the only thing I changed was that I added 1 tsp of vanilla essence to the wet ingredients to give the muffins a boost.  They cooked really easily and were a real hit with my friends

So good and not overly sweet like so many muffins. Make sure to put the jam in the centre of the muffin or it spills on the tin and it is difficult to clean up.

Perfect!! Just made these and the whole family loves them. They are soft & moist inside, with a slight crunch on the outside. Just great! Three little changes:  Added 1 tsp vanilla with the wet ingredients, swirled the jam into each muffin a little then put a little more batter on top, and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Made 12 smallish muffins. I will make them again a lot!

Jam overflowed and made a mess in the oven.  I plan to try another recipe next time that calls for putting the jam in the middle of the muffin as opposed to the top.

My sons helped make these for breakfast this morning.  Quick and easy, and they came out delicious!  I used rice milk, coconut oil, and strawberry jam.  Be sure to press the jam into the muffin as the recipe states, or layer each muffin with batter, then the jam, then more batter on top.  I forgot the nuts, but will definitely add them next time.

Nice muffins. I used pineapple jam and I had some pineapple essence which I added to the mixture to give that real pineapple kick. I will continue to play around with this recipe.

These were delicious! They were a little less sweet than my liking (but I love sweet everything) so I added a tad more sugar as well as cinnamon and put the jam in the middle of the muffins, that way the jam didn't completley come off the top and burn onto the pan (which it will). I also sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on top and it tasted great! Almost like a scone!

This recipe was ok. But the muffin itself without the jam was bland. I would recomend adding some vanilla for more flavor.

Very good and easy basic muffin recipe. For added flavor I add 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract, (so far I always topped with my homemade pear jam); otherwise as written, and my whole family approves.

I actually really loved these muffins, but I think they were made better with a few changes. I added 1 tsp Vanilla and the Zest from one lemon- this really made for a great flavor! Also, I topped 6 of 12 with turbinado sugar. I stuffed the jam deep inside the batter, and topped with a bit more batter before baking. SO good!

Good, basic muffins.  You'll definitely want to use a measuring teaspoon for the jelly, not a regular spoon, and make sure to follow the directions about pushing down the jelly into the muffin batter.

I put the muffins in baking cups and pushed in the jam so no mess.  I added two chocolate chips as eyes at the end (they only took 15 min for me) so they looked like a silly face - made for a fun breakfast.  Will have to try the jam further down suggestion.

These were really great. My husband and kids loved them and they were very easy to make. The jam will make a mess, though if it is not pressed into the muffin batter before making. Thanks for the recipe!!

Yum, these muffins are pretty good. I followed EMINEE's advice and put jam halfway through, then topped with chopped walnuts.

Not the best muffins in the world. You definitely need to bury the jam in there or else it just sits at the top. Next time I will try some of the other comment recommendations because they were a bit bland (but that might just be because my jam was only at the top of the muffin...). That being said, they were still pretty good. A few adjustments and they'll be great next time!

made a HUGE mess in my oven! I followed other reviewers' recommendations and put the jam in the center vs on top and they still bubbled out all in my oven, what a mess! I even used cupcake liners.  They may taste great, however right now, I've got a sticky mess to deal with :(

great muffins! Perfect texture, moist & soft on the inside...I did the same as some others recommended, filled the trays to half way, added a drop of jam, then poured the rest of the mixture on top. This sealed in the jam nicely so it wasn't bubbling out. I also added a teaspoon of Vanilla Essence to the mix, which I think is needed for a little more sweetness. Overall, super quick, easy, delicious muffins!

These were ok. The batter tasted like it was missing something-possible more sugar or maybe some brown sugar? Wouldn't make this particular recipe again.

really these are a 3.5 for me. they are better if you think of them as scones as they are kind of heavy. i listened to other reviewers and added vanilla and cinnamon to the wet ingredients and i put the jam in the middle of the muffins. also on half of them i sprinkled a little brown sugar to the top and i think that is a nice touch.   they are easy and use basic staple ingredients so i will probably make them again with scones in mind :o)

I made this recipe and I was NOT happy with it. I made it just as directed which I try to always do this the first time. I found them to be very heavy and not light in the least. I might make these again because we always have the ingredients on hand. Next time I will follow the other reviewers suggestions and put the jam in the middle. I don't know what I did wrong for them to end up so dense and heavy though... too bad that I didn't like these. I really wanted to!

These are great. I listened to other reviewers and cut down the amount of jam I used. I will not do that next time. I think I'll try adding a whole teaspoon for a more delicious jam taste in ever muffin. I am going to make these again with all the different jam flavors!

These are a very good breakfast treat. It tastes much better if you fill half the batter in the muffin tins, place the jelly in the middle, and fill will the rest of the batter so the jelly doesn't get hard and burnt. I also added some vanilla for a little p'zaz!

I thought that adding the jam to the muffins was a great idea.  I used apricot jam and added a tiny amount of almond flavoring to the batter.  I tested the muffins at 16 minutes and they were already overbaked! So as a result, they were dry, but the taste was very good.  I'm going to try them again, but either cut the oven temp down some or be more careful with my timing.

I made a few changes for a healthier muffin, used splenda instead of sugar, subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of all purpose white flour, squeezed in juice from 1 orange, added 1/2 a tsp of almond extract for flavor and added a few cut up strawberries to the batter.  Tasted great, easy to make.

A wonderful recipes but I did tweak it a bit...I added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to batter. I also used a raspberry jam and put a blackberry in the center of muffin before sealing it in with more batter then added a cinnamon streusel topping. Delicious!!

Make this in a spring form pan with homemade jam which is much sweeter than store bought, add a crumb topping to it and it is good, you can tell by the extra baking powder and lack of sugar that this recipe depends on the jam to sweeten it, it was fast , easy and very good as a breakfast cake, experiment with it , I added fresh blackberries from the garden and used a brown sugar crumb topping, as well as cinnamon, this is a basic recipe so it is good for people who like to add their own touches to it

These came out perfect and tasted like a muffin crossed with a scone!!  Oh, they were beautiful.  I had to make some changes to the recipe because I'm at a higher altitude. I found the changes from a lady that doesn't live at high altitude but used one of the tips:  PREHEAT the oven to 400 degrees and when you put your muffins in, bring down the temp to 350 (what eminee suggested-or to whatever the recipe you're using calls for).  They had perfect domes, I made 12, just great!  I have been looking for a recipe like this for years-my cousin made them when I was prob 8 years old and I never had them since, but always wanted to.

They came out beautiful.  I did some with the jam on top and some in the middle. I think if you tried to use 2 Tablespoons of jam, it would make a huge mess.  I used 2 teaspoons which was more than enough. They all came out nice.  I made this a gluten free recipe. I used 1 .5 cups rice flour and .5 cup of corn starch.  I also added more sugar. 1 Tablespoon of baking powder?  No way.  I used 1.5 teaspoon.  I cannot imagine using so much baking powder.   I will make these again.

Just made these and finished eating one of them. YUM!! I took some peoples advice.  I used applesauce in place of the oil.  Added 1/4 cup extra sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla extract.  Put the jam in the middle of the muffin. They were plenty sweet without being too sweet.  I was afraid of using too much jam and they definitely could have used more.  I put walnuts on top of every other one.  I liked those the best. I will be making these again and again!!

It is a very simple recipe. I used applesauce instead of an egg since I didn't have any eggs in my refrigerator. Also, next time I will fill my muffins 1/2 way then add the jam and then add more muffin mix.

These muffins remind me of some that I had in a fancy B&B in Taos, NM. They had some with jam, and some with fresh fruit with coarse sugar sprinkled on the top. They come out perfect for me every time. Be careful not to use too much jam and press your chunk of jam in a little. I mix the nuts into the batter. These are best when they are fresh out of the oven. Not as good cold. I have also put raisins or craisins,  into the batter. This recipe is basic and  I think you can be creative and the results will be good.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I made it for a class and it was really amazing. I used strawberry jam since i could not get the fruit itself, but it was worth it. Soft, and just right. It tasted really good!

Great basic recipe.  The better the jam the better these will turn out.

These go up against a family recipe that hides the jam at the bottom of the muffin which is strict competition.  I will need to add the recipe here.

I tried reviewer Cassandra's adjustments, which included brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and applesauce instead of oil.  I would say this is a solid recipe, but pretty bland and messy.  I don't know that I would make this again.

they were easy to do, but not too much flavor... Sprinkled some icing sugar on top made it okay. Reminded me more of a tea biscuit.

Pretty good muffins! I, too, put the jam in the middle of the muffin rather than the top. I added just a touch of cinnamon & nutmeg to the batter. I also added some crumb topping made from 1tbsp softened butter, 1tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tbsp flour.

Excellent! Didn't modify these at all and loved them. A great way to use precious home-made jams so that they're really appreciated. I agree with a previous reviewer that they're a bit scone-like, only with the jam built in.

I am usually a cuppycake maker but muffins seemed good tonight! I used Smuckers Sugar-free Blueberry preserves for the jam. I also added about 1/4 cinnamon and 1/4 c vanilla to the mix. However, I calculated the recipe for 36 servings. The dough is thick and burnt out my little electric mixer motor (oops) but they smell wonderful and look like they'll be done baking after 12 minutes at 375. The batter tastes great with some additional ingredients. Thanks for this recipe! Super fast and easy!

These muffins were lacking some serious flavor and the jam more acted like a glazed on the top rather than a filling. They were okay, but I probably won't try them again.

Good, but the muffin itself needs a bit more flavor. We added 1/2 tsp vanilla, (next time we might add 1 tsp). We also increased sugar to 2/3 cup (next time we might try part brown sugar.)

I really liked these.  Not too sweet, great texture -- tasted like scones but a lot easier.  I tried a few different jams in the first batch -- strawberry,orange marmalade,and a vanilla/lemon marmalade.  The vanilla/lemon were the best.

These muffins were amazing!!!
I added a little bit more sugar(around 1/4 cup) I found a lot of people were saying these were bland and dry, but I didn't have that problem at all. They were cooked perfectly by 15 min and they weren't golden once cooked. It's a must try!

Every Sunday, I make muffins and bring them to church for the missionaries. I made these this morning, and they were so good, I wanted to keep them for myself! 
I had read other reviews where the jam burned. I didn't want this to happen, so I put a batter in each cup, put the jam on top and then placed the rest of the batter on top of the jam. I then took a spatula and spread the batter so that I couldn't see any jam. Some of the jam did bubble up out of the batter, but it didn't burn. It left kind of sugary crust where it had bubbled up.
The muffin batter itself is a good base and I'm excited about what I can do next Sunday with it.

These muffins were delicious and moist. If I hadn't have followed another users advice and not added axtra jam to the mixture they would have been bland. They weren't the best muffins, but still delicious! They went down well with everyone!

I really enjoyed these muffins, I made them with strawberry jam and because I had no muffin cases at the time I put the mixture in a deep heart-shaped tray which made several large muffins. I especially liked the way they were crispy on the outside and nice and spongy and sweet on the inside. I only had to open my cupboards and I immediatly had all the ingredients and the instructions were easy to follow. Next time I will perhaps add glazed cherries or chocolate chips to the mixture to liven up the middle of the muffins.

This was a great, easy recipe for breakfast.  My kids loved them, and I loved how easy they were to make.  I blended the strawberry jam in with the wet ingredients.  Next time I am also going to add chopped strawberries.  Not a sweet muffin but it is a recipe that can be altered quite easily.

I thought this recipe was great. The muffins rose deliciously as I never seen them rise! very cakey, soft and nice.  I added 1 sachet of vanilla sugar, put the jam in the middle and glazed them with a mixture of honey, strawberry essence and honey, which gave them a slightly crunchy top. Thanks!

These were quick and easy but only tasted ok. I followed the suggestions of others and put the jam in the middle with more dough on top and that worked well. I used raspberry jam and since I had fresh raspberries on hand I did put in fresh raspberries in the dough. I liked them but as my husband did not I will not make them again.

It was a very quick and easy recipe! I added jam to the batter. I do not have a muffin maker, so I just used a regular cake form. It turned out great! Not too sweet, just the way I like it. I will definetly make that often.

I added allspice, vanilla extract and apple sauce to the batter for a bit more taste. My children also pressed raspberry flavoured chocolate chips into their muffin cups before spooning on the jam. The result was delicious. 
A great versatile basic recipe that is easy to personalise.

Straightforward recipe yields nice moist muffins.  I like sweet muffins, so I mixed up a glaze of powdered sugar, milk & vanilla, and drizzled over the top while the muffins were warm.  As others recommended--putting the dollop of jam in the center seems to work real well.  With the glaze they are gooey as heck, but they go real well with black tea or coffee.

Well, I liked these muffins, but no one else seemed to.  The dough was a bit too thick and salty, more like scones than muffins.  Next time, I'll have to modify a little more.

These were really really good. I've made these before but they were called "Top Hats" I believe. I used some of my Gramma's home made raspberry jam with these.

tasty, though a little bland.  I sprinkled sugar on top and put the jam inside the muffins.
