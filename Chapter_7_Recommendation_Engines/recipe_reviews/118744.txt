We liked it.  It was difficult to flip over without tearing the dough.  I added an onion and green pepper.  Looks and tastes great.

This was awesome! I used an additional egg mixed in with the sausage and it was delicious!  I will make this all the time now.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a hit on Thanksgiving morning.  I used polish sausage so I omited the garlic and onion salt.  I took the casing off and cooked the polish sausage like a bulk sausage.  Next time I may try a frozen pizza dough.
