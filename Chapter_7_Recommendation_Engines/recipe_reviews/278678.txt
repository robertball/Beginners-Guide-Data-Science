I cut the dough into squares instead of using a biscuit cutter and they still worked and I could use them to make breakfast biscuit sandwiches

These were amazing! Light & fluffy and delicious. I worried the maple wash might be too sweet but, for all of us, it was just right. Will make a double recipe next time!

This was delicious- my only suggestion is double the recipe and make sure you have lovely jam to go with it!!
