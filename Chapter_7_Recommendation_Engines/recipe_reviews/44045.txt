I served this with my traditional irish desserts.  I also used Kahlua instead of the Irish cream and it was a big hit.  Perfect for a chilly night! Enjoyed by all, especially the grandparents!

This is such a perfect winter after-dinner drink.  It works well in hot chocolate, too.

I felt wicked drinking this on a Sunday afternoon but it went great as an after-dinner drink after a large sunday lunch w/ family. If you sprinkle the nutmeg just so over the whip cream, it looks really pretty and it goes down really well!

A favorite winter drink in our house!  We enjoy these in a thermos while walking near the water on Naples Island in Long Beach watching the boat parade.  Keeps you nice and toasty.  We also enjoy these on Christmas morning along with mimosas and Breakfast Casserole (recipe on this site).  This is a great drink, but be careful cause they are STRONG!

I made this in clear, Irish coffee mugs and skipped the nutmeg. This was too strong, with a dominating taste of whiskey. The coffee almost seemed an afterthought. Reducing the amounts of whiskey and Bailey's by half would really improve this.

This drink was way too strong. My mom and husband thought the same thing. Next time I will try leaving out the whiskey and just adding Irish cream, which still has alcohol.

Traditional Irish Coffee utilizes only the Irish whiskey and a little brown sugar to sweeten, but using Irish Cream liqueur is a nice touch! It's like a midway between an Irish Coffee and a B52, which uses 1/3 shot each of Khalua, Grand Marnier, and Irish Cream. Very tasty.

Great around the campfire......or anywhere......add a little cinnamon for a different taste. 
You can also use creme de cocoa...and for a sweeter taste......add amoretto  or almond extract for an Italian taste.

Oh YES!  This is how I make my Irish coffees too and they are fabulous.  The nutmeg is a nice idea.  I will add that next time I make mine.  Way to go, Jason!

MMMâ€¦ The Beverage of March, still chilly out so this will warm you up. This drink has good balance, not to strong of any taste ex. whiskey, coffee, or cream. The dash of nutmeg is a must I sipped on it remembered the nutmeg added a dash then decided to write a review. Make sure to use vary hot coffee because one you add the other ingredients it cools down.

I made this drink from the Allrecipes UK site. It is the same submitter and recipe picture to. My review from this month: I thought the alcohol on this was rather strong. I cut the amount of whisky in half, but I could still taste it. I think I just prefer the Irish cream, just to taste, and as a flavoring like one would add flavored coffee cream. The whipped cream and chocolate or nutmeg on top were a nice touch. Next time, I will just do the Irish Cream as I have before. Thank you, anyway.

Irish whiskey overpowered all other ingredients. I think 1/2 oz. whiskey with all other ingredients would be much better.  The the whiskey is very expensive and coffee with just Irish Cream added is wondeful in itself.

Oh wow...THIS is how you spend a cold winter day at home, man! :) I LOVE whisky (or whiskey, whatever you prefer), so the alcohol mix in this recipe is PERFECT for me! Thank you for providing a reminder of a simple classic that is so delicious, you forget how easy it is to make!

I just made like 8 of these and ran out of whiskey so I had to use rum after my 3rd or 4th cup and that was pretty good. And then I ran out of coffee and had just rum and that was even better.

The best Irish cream for this is Carolans. It has a good honey vanilla flavor to it. And I use Rebecca's Creek Texas whiskey because the strong, smooth flavor works well with the coffee. This drink will warm you to the core on a bitter cold morning and tickle your taste buds as well!

This is a nice variation on the classic Irish coffee which calls for brown sugar and Irish whiskey. I think it's important to use a dark enough roast coffee to stand up to the alcohol. I did and mine was not too strongly alcohol tasting. I left out the nutmeg, but will probably give that a try next time I make some.
