I love avacados but two seemed a little much for only four eggs, therefore, I only used one. They turned out great and everyone loved them!

This is a very good alternative to regular deviled eggs BUT the guacamole turned very dark when I put it in the eggs the night before I was going to serve them so next time I will wait until the last minute to add it to the eggs.  Very tasty though.

These were great.  My family LOVES avocados so I followed the recipe as is.  Once my mom tasted one she just kept stuffing them into her mouth and told everyone else that they didn't taste good. This is a great recipe if you want a change from a basic deviled egg.

It was very good, however it's mostly like guacamole in eggs.  If you like that you'll like these.  I garnished with a dab of sourcream and an olive slice.  They were pretty that way.

While these were good, they need a few changes to be delicious. Next time I prepare these, I'll add some finely minced garlic and extra jalapeno and cilantro.

Made 9 eggs-worth of these along with 9 eggs-worth of bacon and cheese deviled eggs for a "do" here in the canyon tonight. They were the hit if the party! Everybody loved them. Add the lime juice to the avocado as you are mashing it and before adding the other stuff and you should have no problem with browning. I topped them off with a little sprinkle of Pico de Gallo. I used 9 eggs and double the recipe for the guacamole, and even though I really loaded each egg half with the goop, there was plenty left over for some tortilla chip dipping tomorrow. Thanks, Lisa Linthicum for a great recipe!

I thought this was great and unusual.  However, my wedding was on July 4th and they do turn brown.  If anybody comes up with any ideas to keep this from happening, let us know.

I think you need to be a real avocado lover for this one.  While the taste was okay, everyone tried it...I think I'll stick to regular ole deviled eggs.  I was looking for ways to incorporate avocados into our diet, they are a natural source of Omega-3 (EFA)...and "good" fat.  If you like avocados, I believe you'll enjoy these - I guess it just wasn't our taste.  and hey, check out the avocado pie on this site - outta this world good!!!!!

This variation was pretty good tasting, but it makes too much filling for so few eggs.  If you like your eggs saltier or hot-tasting, you will need to increase those ingredients.  I tripled the recipe but only used 5 avocados, and it was still too much filling.  Thanks.

These did not go over very well with the guys, I on the other hand, thought that they were pretty good, and a nice way to change up the original.  I used 1/2 an avocado and more jalapeno.  I'll try these with the girls at my next girl party.  Thanks Lisa!

If you are having problems with the guacamole turning brown, there are two ways to get around it.. One is to prepare the guacamole just before serving, and the other is to add more lime juice! Excellent way to have deviled eggs!

I used guacamole that I had made a couple nights before, but I added the dijon-style mustard and egg yolks to it. I didn't add the w. sauce and I only had 3 eggs. They turned out pretty good, I think they could use some sour cream. Made a nice lil snack, might make these again if I need to use up guacamole. Thanks for the unique recipe.

Ok, so first I should mention that I LOVE avocado.  I mean LOOOOOOOOOOVE avocado, and am always looking for ways to add it into recipes, etc... In deviled eggs, it just doesn't work.  I think the problem is that while I love avocado, I also love deviled eggs, and this certainly was nothing even close to a deviled egg.  The mustard kick is lacking terribly, and the avocado (even with all the added ingredients) is simply too plain with a boiled egg white.   Still planning on making it?  Well here are my tips...cut the avocado amount in half and cut the lime amount in half...and even then, watch out. Luckily I only made half a dozen so I was able to save the last half and make regular deviled eggs.  WAYYYYY better!

TIP:  To keep guacamole from turning brown so quickly, sprinkle "Fruit Fresh" fruit preservative in and stir. You'll find it in the canning section of the market. Your avacado will turn brown eventually but this will help extend the green for 12 - 24 hours.

This is weird, but Okay.  To prevent them from turning brown in the refrigerator, put seran wrap over the top and make sure no air gets to the guac.  Oxygen is what turns them brown.

Interesting Idea.
I just used some of the left over guacamole instead of following the recipe. I am giving it four stars because I think although mine had a pretty good flavor but was missing something and looking over the recipe I think it would be much better if I had followed the recipe. 
Will try again, but I think old school deviled eggs won't be replaced.

This was a nice change. I left out all the hot stuff since I don't like spicy food. It still had a nice flavor. I think maybe next time I will add some guacamole seasoning to give it more flavor.

I also used only 1 avocado, even though I love it. To the problem of turning brown: try Fruit Fresh in the mixture. For this amount I would use about 2 tsps. Also, before (or even during presentation) try to keep covered with plastic wrap.

I realize that there are many good reviews here and so I had high hopes for these eggs but they just did not meet my expectations.  Personally, I spit out the eggs and my husband did not like them and we ended up throwing them in the garbage disposal after a while.  We are not picky eaters, we have never done this before with any recipe on here.  There was just an unusual taste about these which we did not care for.  We followed the directions but left out the worcest. sauce.  From now on I will stick to traditional or the spinach deviled eggs on this site.

Interesting idea! and tasty! I just feel that egg yolks are disappeared into the guacamole, though. They are still very good!

Well, one of my avocados was bad, so I only had one to work with. It also hindered much of the avocado taste. Not the recipe's fault, I know. I'll have to give this one another go. Thanks!

I made guacamole deviled eggs for the first time tonight and what I ended up with was pretty darn good, despite all my modifications and the avocado not being very ripe!  I used only one and modified the seasonings to suit our tastes, even omitting some.  I ended up having to add a little mayo for creaminess because of the avocado not being ripe. I will make these again, with a RIPE avocado. I am sharing my photo of them.

These were AMAZING! Whenever we bring them as an appetizer to a party, they are gone in SECONDS! Amazing.

We loved these (we also love both guacamole and deviled eggs) - but I ended up with way too much filling (pretty good with chips). Next time I'll try one avocado (small) or less. The ratio was actually very good, but I think I'd like more egg flavor too. Things I changed: lots of green Tabasco (2 tsp at least), one full jalapeno, 1/4 red pepper finely chopped and a couple extra dashes of Worcestershire and mustard (might not need more with one less avocado).

I loved this recipe!  However, I had leftover filling after I filled up the egg whites. So I used the remaining filing as a spread over toast the next morning! I loved it on my toast and its become an optional way to eat my morning egg and avocado.

Yummy a definite make again although is time consuming in the preparation . Plenty of extra filling to save and use as a sandwich spread.
