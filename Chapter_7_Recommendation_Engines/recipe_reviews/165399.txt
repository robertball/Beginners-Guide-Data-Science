The chicken was very good and the kids even at it-amazing! But there was way too many lentils for 4 servings. Next time I will cut the lentils in half. But very yummy! Also, I think it would be good with smaller pieces of chicken, like drumsticks and wings, or maybe just chunks of chicken.

I was looking for a recipe for chicken breasts with bones in (hard to fine these days), and I found this one. I was delighted with the way it turned out. It got raves from my family. The chicken was unusually tender, savory, and piquant. I didn't have seasoning salt on hand, so I improvised with salt, garlic, parsley, paprika, and pepper. Also, I cooked the lentils for twice as long (approx. 40 minutes) as the recipe called for. There were a LOT of lentils, but we'll eat them as a side dish after all the chicken is gone. Thanks for this great, delicious recipe!

This recipe has been updated with a correction from the submitter. The recipe now calls for a package of steamed lentils, not uncooked lentils.

Excellent flavor.  My kids are not crazy about lentils.  I also felt it could use a few less lentils.

Some people think they need a lot of crazy thing for a good recipe. I think this one kind of goes down that road. There are too many Lentils for this dish. I feel overwhelmed by the protein and fiber. This one needs more carbs!! Maybe some potatoes or noodles... Nah Not noodles. I think that this idea is sound but I don't like using white Balsamic vinegar. It has a harsh flavor and makes me think this recipe was just thrown together instead of thought out. I do like the use of fine chopped carrots though. Most people forget how carrots can lend a light sweetness to a dish that is not overwhelming and makes for a good addition for some easy veggies.   Lentils are great but this one just has too many. Also think about how this could be cooked in a casserole dish instead of a skillet. I don't own a skillet big enough to accommodate this much food.

Really enjoyed this recipe,  The kids both ate it all up.  I did not add the pimento since I had none.  Will make again.

Everyone loved this.  I used some extra homemade chicken stock and everyone had a bowl of soup as a side dish!

This dish was very flavorful.  My son even ate it up!  I used regular balsamic vinegar as I had no white balsamic on hand.  I used regular chicken breast without the bone and that is the only change I would make for next time.  I would definitely use the bone-in.  Otherwise this was fantastic and I will make again!
