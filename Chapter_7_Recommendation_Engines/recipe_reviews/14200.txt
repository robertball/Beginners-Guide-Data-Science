"Honey, I don't know what you did to this tuna sandwich, but I devoured it." This, from my husband who hates cottage cheese. I didn't tell him what was in his sandwich, but he came home and asked for the same sandwich tomorrow! This is my new tuna sandwich recipe. Absolutely a keeper!

Lets see, I eat an english muffin with cottage cheese & diced tomatoes almost every single morning (with my 3 cups of coffee - a bit extreme, I know), I love tuna salad, AND I love egg salad so why the heck not mix em' all up?  This is AWESOME!  I did infact eat this on a toasted english muffin, and added about 2 tsp. of hot giardinera relish (sounds gross, but I love it with tuna)for a zip.  I will probably use this recipe as a regular.  Thanks a bunch Teresa!

What a nice way to extend a can of tuna!  The cottage cheese does make it creamy and with the eggs it is a nice high protein lunch we served with sliced tomatoes.  I omitted lemon pepper which we don't care for, forgot celery salt, and used red onion, and it was tasty.  I used Miracle Whip for a little extra zip!

I was skeptical of eggs and cottage cheese in tuna, but my family loved it on homemade bread. This tuna salad could also be served on a bed of red leaf lettuce with a few pimientos added for some color. Great for a ladies luncheon. Thanks for sharing Teresa.

Um, wow! No, really......wow! Cottage cheese as a base in tuna salad? Never would have thought of that. I did run my cottage cheese through my tiny food processor before adding it to the mix only because I knew it wouldn't have made it past my husband if I hadn't. I made it a little more "us" with some garlic powder/onion powder/dried dill weed/fresh ground pepper and a dash or two of Frank's hot sauce as well as a couple of garlic dills that I chopped. Because I do not have celery salt on it's own, I used Beau Monde seasoning. Very, very good. We all thought this was just mighty tasty AND it was great for using up half of a container of cottage cheese. NOTE: I did use "trim" cottage cheese and reduced fat mayonnaise.

Excellent Tuna Salad Recipie!  I eat this with some Triskets and it makes a perfect lunch.  One thing I did was leave out the green onion and added big chunks of sweet pickle!  Yummy.  Also I served this next to some large tomato slices for a luncheon with ladies.  It was a hit.

wow. this was really tasty. i did omit the celery salt and found that to be helpful, but another option may be using low sodium tuna. i thought about using this for a pot luck or even when having friends over, but will definitely make it with albacore. It was excellent!

Cross between tuna salad and egg salad.  Good flavor, although not really tuna-y. Maybe adding an extra can of tuna and a little extra mayo.

I tried this today and just loved it. I like the creamy texture and the flavor is great. Taste like there is a piece of cheese on your tuna sandwich.

This is really bad. Worst recipe I have tried on this site. Put the cottege cheese on the side, along with chopped egg and make old time tuna salad. That way, you get individule flavors-not mush!

Hubby tried this dish and made a debonaire attempt at eating it with saltine crackers but gave up after a few bites.  It really did sound delishous to me, but had no flavor and the strangest consitency.  The lemon pepper was a bit overpowering and it could definetely use some pickles or relish.  I'm happy for those of you who liked it and will make it a regular, but I will not be one of those.  I think I'll stick with my good ol' trusted tuna recipe or try elsewhere.  Thanks for sharing just the same.

You know, this stunk. You couldn't even taste the tuna. I hated wasting a can of tuna on this recipe. If you want something called tuna salad but doesn't taste anything like tuna or doesn't taste good at all then this is the recipe for you.

Not bad.  I really like the lemony taste!  That plus the cottage cheese and egg give a nice twist on tuna salad.  I used regular onions because I didn't have any green ones.

Didn't have any lemon juice on hand so didn't use it.  I really liked this tuna salad (I normally HATE tuna salad).  It tasted like it was missing something, but I have no idea what I could add.  Definitely will make again though, thanks!!!!

Nice combination of flavours.  Good change from the usual tuna salad or egg salad.  I added 1 T of horseradish because I love it.  Thanks for the recipe, Teresa.

Great way to make a small can of tuna go a long way.  I don't think this will be my go to recipe for tuna salad but definitely a nice change from regular old tuna.  I substituted garlic salt for celery salt.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now.  I hate eggs so I leave them out and I don't keep cottage cheese in the frig so that is almost always left out.  I love the lemon taste so I usually boost the juice and lemon pepper up a bit.  I don't eat any seafood other than this recipe.  Hubby really likes it too!

I liked this but would never make this for anyone else but me because it is a little weird in texture. Plus, it is a little bland the way it is, so i added pickle relish and that helped.  i agree with the last reviewer that the egg should be left on the side. its too weird mixed in with the salad. oh by the way, i made this only because i did a search for a recipe with the ingredients i had on hand.  i need to use up the last of that cottage cheese and green onions!

Mine came out way too salty for some reason.  I really liked the cottage cheese added though.  It had a nice texture, and made the can of tuna go alot further.  I always appreciate that since I have 3 kids.  Next time, I think I will add the celery salt last, and just a little at a time until its right.

We thought the cottage cheese was a great addition to tuna salad.  I also added a little paprika.  This made a lot more than I expected because I got more than 4 servings.

This is surprisingly tasty!  I didnt have any lemon items to add, and its great without them!  I just added a little seafood seasoning instead.  Ive never tasted a tuna salad so delicious!  I will make it this way from now on for sure.  Much better than my dry lazy mayo and mustard version.

This recipe was wonderful!!!!!!!!I am constantly looking for healthy low fat recipes. For this I used low fat mayo and low fat cottage cheese. I left out the eggs and added more celery. less than 2 grams of fat per serving!!!!!! This is definitely going into regular rotation around here!

This was wonderful!  Cottage cheese is a great way to stretch a can of tuna, and I don't even care for cottage cheese (you can't taste it!).  I doubled the tuna and celery, used 1/2 tsp. dried dill instead of lemon pepper and celery salt.  I also added 1 Tbl. pickle relish and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  Awesome on rye bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved the taste and the texture of this tuna salad made with cottage cheese.  It worked great as leftovers, as the salad did not become watery.

We really love this recipe and make it often.  Sometimes we substitute hummous for the mayonnaise, which is very different, but still good.

Very yummy, my boyfriend and I both really liked it! I eat tuna with cottage cheese all the time, but I really enjoyed all the other ingredients for some extra taste and crunch.

I usually do not like tuna salad, but I loved this recipe.  It was really, really tasty.  I didn't have eggs so I left them out and halved the cottage cheese.  I added some dried dill and paprika, and a bit of extra lemon and lemon pepper, and I found it to be fantastic!  I am going to make this again and double it because it was perfect for lunch.  I may add some capers.  I rolled it up in a flat-out wrap with some romaine.  So good!  A great way to get your "brain food" in and full of protein, too.

I left out the lemon pepper because it didn't appeal to me for this dish but I really liked this recipe otherwise!

Too much cottage cheese.  I even used a 12 oz can of tuna, and it was still too much cottage cheese.  I will try again using 1/4 the amount and if that is good, I will keep the recipe.  If not...back to my old favorite.
