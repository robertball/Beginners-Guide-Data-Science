I made this recipe (x4) for my niece’s bridal shower this past Sunday.  We served these with croissants and got many compliments.  We even had people asking to take the leftovers home.  I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the curry powder, which I did not have and was not willing to purchase.  I looked up a recipe for curry powder online and used what I had on hand for the ingredients, which were garlic powder, ground ginger, chili seasoning, salt, pepper, and dry mustard.  Prior to the shower I made a sample batch, ½ with Miracle Whip and ½ with Hellman’s Mayonnaise.  I preferred the mayo and used that for the shower.  The cranberries, green onion and celery gave this salad a real festive look.  My mom and dad had leftovers for lunch for two days now as well as myself.  My cousin and sister also took some home for their families!!  Great hit!!  I will definitely make again. Updated 1/7/09: I tried this again using store bought rotisserie chicken.  The result was not as good as boiling your own chicken.

We used this chicken salad on crossaint and served it at our church activity.  Everyone loved it!  It is so easy to make and tastes so good.  When you boil the chicken, add some salt to the water to enhance the flavor of the chicken.  Another suggestion, almonds or cashews will be a great alternatives to pecans.  Thanks for the great recipe.  We love the presentation of green and craisins.

I wish I could rate this with 10 STARS! This is THE BEST chicken salad ever. I served it on little Pepperidge Farm rolls and my guests loved them. I probably added more curry than the recipe because I like the flavor so test it as you are mixing it and put in your desired amount. If you are in a hurry, buy a cooked chicken from the grocery store and shred it for a fast/easy way to make this.

Great recipe!  Instead of bread, I wrapped this salad in flat leaf lettuce, then skewered it with a toothpick and topped it with a seedless grape.  Everyone that tried these "roll-ups" enjoyed them.  I will be making this recipe again!

SO tasty! I cut back on the mayo by almost 1/2, and it was perfect. I also doubled the curry, added grapes, and left out the lime juice. This is by FAR the best chicken salad I have had! I can't stop eating it :)

Really tasty!  I made these on slices of baguette and used a fresh spinach leaf instead of lettuce.  I would probably use fewer cranberries next time.

I found this recipe on another site and my friends all raved about it so I had to look it up so that I could send them the recipe.  We used it for a baby shower tea.  I then used the leftovers at a football game party and they loved it too!
5 stars all around.

I tasted this right after mixing all the chicken salad ingredients together and thought it was rather dry but pretty tasty. However, after letting the mixture sit overnight and then tasting it again, I can now see why people love this stuff! It's very flavorful so the bread and lettuce is definitely needed, IMO, to balance the flavor out. Needless to say, I'll be making these again but DEFINITELY make it a day ahead of when I'm going to need it.

Best chicken salad ever!  I left out the curry, because my family doesn't like it.  I got rave reviews from everyone about how wonderful this recipe is.  Fantastic, thanks for sharing!

I made this for a light lunch I hosted today.  I added a bit more curry powder and skipped the cranberries and pecans.  Instead of regular Mayo, I used Kraft light made with olive oil and squeezed a fresh lime for the lime juice.  This salad was served along with a cracker and cheese plate.  It made a lovely light lunch and is now awaiting the return of the children from school.  I made it in the past with dried cranberries and chopped walnuts.  In all this is a very versatile and tasty chicken salad.  Thanks for posting!  I will definitely use it again!

Awesome!!!!  Served this for a Bridal Shower Tea and it was the hit of the party.  I made the sandwiches on a rich cinnamon bread (Greenlees Brand).  Everyone couldn't stop eating these they were so good and everyone wanted the recipe.  I did make it with two slices of bread, just because it would be easier to put out because we had a big group.  I did double the curry as I don't like subtle flavors.

Quick and delicious, either on some type of bread or as a salad.  Adjust the currry to your taste, but I thought the amount was fine as written.  Pretty, too!

I made this last night so that it would have time to meld. I tasted while preparing.....very good! Cant wait to eat it. I purchased pita bread to use with it. I was a little leary cause I dont normally make chicken salad with friut and nuts but they made a great addition. One last thing....I added more curry like so many others

Served this at a Valentine Tea Party yesterday with fear and trepidation pounding in my little heart...not everybody thinks they like curry! Made mine with Miracle Whip Salad Dressing, and and a rotisserie chicken, and served it in individual servings mounded on those little white spoons they give you in Chinese restaurants for eating miso soup.  I bought some green leaf lettuce, opened the head up to the smallest, tenderest leaves on the inside and lined each spoon with a lettuce leaf, first.

It was a huge hit!  Don't be afraid of the curry; it adds life to this chicken salad.  Each bite goes in tasting one way and changes to two or three other flavors while it's in your mouth.  The curry adds first a spicy kick, and then a sweet finish.  Amazing!  So glad I made more than we needed for the tea!  Is it lunchtime, yet???

I made an account just to review this - THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS. I left out the celery and used semi-cooked carrots instead. TO DIE FOR! My boyfriend ate it until he felt sick. I was jealous that he had more than me.

Really good. I used all of the called for Jamaican curry and a bit more lime. Of course I added a pinch of salt. I served it in a spinach wrap to mom and dad and the kids and I ate it on sweet rye bread. Skye and Shiner liked. Bliss not so much.

I made this for an English Tea yesterday.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I left out the cranberries (didn't have any) and used almonds instead of pecans.  It was awesome!  I'll definitely make again.  (If you use it in tiny tea sandwiches, be sure to cut the chicken cubes smaller than usual.)

I made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, and it got raves when I took it to a ladies' tea!  I served it on mini croissants, with baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce.

This is a true crowd pleaser; perfect for your next company potluck or holiday party.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I accidently added 2 tablespoons of lime juice, instead of 2 teaspoons.  It was just fine.  Depending on your taste the amount of curry powder can be increased slightly.  I have served it on Hawaiian sweet bread as a sandwich, but it is great on any type of bread or cracker or by itself.

Maybe I shouldn't rate this recipe, as mine would have been called Curried TUNA Tea Sandwiches because I was in a hurry and didn't want to cook a chicken. In any case, it was delicious! Instead of mayo, I used a little mayo and mostly plain yogurt and used more curry. If I hadn't had curry, salt and a good dose of cracked pepper would also have worked well. Next time I will use chicken, but I think canned tuna is a great way to get more Omega-3s.

This didn't work for us. I made it for a party, exactly as written, and although it was tried by some, it was not eaten. We found the apple to have a very strange texture in this. I actually liked the curry dressing before it was added to the chicken. Will not be making again. Thanks all the same!

Very good.  Would be good to salt and pepper chicken before cooking.  Needs more curry powder.  Try almonds instead of pecans.

I use this as pita pocket filling for lunches ... I make it a bit chunkier/don't dice things up as much, since it's just going into the pita .. but I buy a rotisserie chicken, and shred it. I then use 1/2C. mayo, and I usually just use lemon juice... I have used craisins, grapes, or a handful of golden raisins... all work well, I just go with what I have on hand.

It was good but a little too sweet. I would do it again, but cut down on the cranberries and apples next time.

I needed a recipe for a bridal shower and came across this one. I'm glad I did...I just whipped this together and it is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten. Can't wait to taste how the flavors blend overnight and can't wait to serve it on mini croissants tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this numerous times as is (ok - a little extra curry for my taste) and it is a new favorite!  I love the chicken salad in a 1/2 pita for the perfect lunch.  I can't seem to get enough.

This was delicious! Such a nice texture. I served the chicken with Breton wheat crackers to save time on set up (and used Costco canned chicken). Everyone at the tea party loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I was sad when the leftovers were gone.

I made this for my daughter's bridal shower. It was served on a bed of lettuce and was the best I've ever had. I got so many compliments on this and requests for the recipe. I added Craisins and golden raisins along with the other ingredients. It was eye appealing and delicious.

personally, this recipe was not to my liking - the apples and curry together with the cranberry was odd. However, it still gets four stars because all my friends loved it and I was asked for the recipe several times - maybe it's just my weird taste!

Yummy recipe. I stuff the chicken salad in a toasted pita. I line the pita pockets with shredded lettuce first. I also use mostly n/f yogurt and just a T of mayo.

My sister and I used this, the Cucumber Sandwiches and Jen's Heavenly Egg Salad recipes (all from this site) for a tea party and our family and friends were blown away! I took a small portion for my mother in-law prior to adding the curry and she looooves this version and is asking me for the recipe! Definitely a keeper and will make again -- very soon!

Pretty good, but that little bit of curry powder does not seem to enhance the flavor of the salad. It'll be just as good without curry powder.

These were scrumptious and easy to make. I used a variety of different breads and then large cookie cutters to make shapes.  I opted to make closed sandwiches, rather than open since we were going to be outside. I also used low-fat mayo.

I made these for a baby shower tea party and loved them!  I would add more curry powder next time around.  I did omit the lettuce.  I covered them with bread instead of open-face to keep them fresher longer at the party.  Delicious!

I made this for a meeting in which I had to bring the snacks.  I served it in the mini filo cups and everyone loved them.  I cut the celery and apple very small to make sure there was some in every cup.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I also made a shrimp version by substituting the chicken for canned shrimp, using 1/4 teaspoon curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning.  That was also a hit.  Thanks for a great recipe

I'm not a big fan of curry but these were delicious. I made the recipe exactly as directed except I left out the cranberries. I also chopped everything very fine. I made these for a baby shower and there were none left at the end of the party. I cut the bread with a flower shaped cookie cutter and the lettuce looked like a little leaf to the dainty flower, so cute.I also recommend the Punch IX from this website if your having a party or get-together, so tasty!

Used about half the mayo.  Had a turkey so made this a turkey salad rather than chicken.  Delicious, it was gone in no time!

I could not taste the curry powder, even when I tripled the amount called for (maybe I have extremely old curry powder?!). Good texture and mix of ingredients, just not as flavorful as I would like. I'll keep it in the rotation and just keep playing with the seasoning to see if I can get more out of this recipe.

This was very good. I left out the celery and added extra green onion and substituted lemon juice for the lime juice and cashews for the pecans.

Made these for  lunch when my daughter and I attended a glass bead making class.  I used all white meat, light mayo then put the filling in pitas.  Wonderful bag lunch.  Will be making this again!

Made as is and it is great. You could probably add a bit more curry powder depending on taste and maybe some salt and pepper to taste but as written it works and is easy too and fairly inexpensive to make.

Oh my!  This is great chicken salad!  I used left-over seasoned chicken in it, trying not to throw it out or waste it.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I subbed lemon juice for the lime and a little regular onion for the green.  I also used Hellman's Light Mayo.  I let it set for several hours after making it.  Definitely better.  I ate just the salad and multi-grain club crackers.  This is now my go-to chicken salad recipe. ***Used 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup light mayo the 2nd time I made this and it was still good.

Made this tonight for three hungry men - two of them in their 30's and one aged 9 - and it was devoured.  I served it with potato chips and carrot sticks (can you tell I just threw this meal together?), and I even cut off the crusts and sliced them into triangles, all fancy and whatnot.  I think I added a bit more curry - and a bit of ground pepper - but this is WONDERFUL as is.  Bravo!

Excellent! Served this for a baby shower on mini croissants. Everybody loved it!  For those concerned about the curry, I followed the recipe exactly, and thought the curry flavor was subtle, and just enough; not overpowering at all.

Amazing! I made this into a wrap with high-fiber tortillas so they'd be easy to take on a picnic. Phenomenal! The curry added a nice bite to it. I sauteed my chicken in olive oil, salt and black pepper before putting them in the marinade.

I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls. I sliced them into thin pieces and pushed the center down, so when they baked they would be flat to better support the mixture. I then placed a spoonful of the mixture on top of the crescent slices after they were baked.  I stuck a toothpick in the center of the slices to assist people in picking them up. I also used whole wheat bread squares that I found at the grocery store for appetizers.

Robin, Robin, Robin! This is a fantastic recipe.  I thought that I had all the ingredints but found that I had purchased fresh cranberries instead of dried.  I just chopped them up and used them anyway.  I think I ate about 1/3 of the curried chicken before I got around to making the sandwiches.  I took them to a baby shower and the attendees raved about them.  I'll be making these again this week for a going away party.  You really hit it out of the park with this one!  Many thanks

Super delicious!  The curry is not strong, so if you love curry, you can definitely add more.  I made a nice presentation by buttering one side of the triangle of a completed sandwich and than dipping it in toasted sesame seeds. The seeds added a nice flavor and texture.

Not enough flavor. I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and more curry. It calls for too much mayo too.

The chicken salad was easy to make and turned out delicious.  I made it for a party along with a lot of other tea sandwiches and hors d'oevres and this was a guest favorite.  I left out the nuts due to some friends with nut allergies and it was great anyway.  The chicken salad tastes great up to 5 days after it's first made (that's when I finally finished eating the leftovers), and sandwiches made with a dense cinnamon-raisin bread were great the next day - not soggy.  It tasted great on several different types of bread, but the cinnamon-raisin was my favorite.

I followed recipe to a tee.  Took it to a church reception for our choir director.  Everyone loved it.  Had a bit of the mixture leftover due to running out of bread slices (I scaled the recipe for serving 60).  All sandwich quarters went in an instant, bowl of mixture went quickly as well.  The hostesses were nibbling on it while we were setting up.  All remarked how exquisite it was.  All asked for the recipe as well.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe for all of us here on the web.

As written I only gave this 3 stars.  It was rather bland and a bit dry, even after making it a day ahead as suggested by other reviewers.  Once I toasted the pecans, doubled the curry and added 1/2 tsp salt it was fantastic and worthy of 5 stars.

I changed a few things to make this Vegan friendly and it turned out great! I substituted Trader Joe's brand vegan "chicken", Veganaisse, and red curry paste...didn't have onions or pecans so i omitted those, but me and my 3 yr old both loved it! Thanks :)

Absolutely delicious!  I've never written a review before but this was so good I had to take the time!  When I first read it I wasn;t sure how the curry would combine with the apple and cranberries but wow was it good!!!!!!!  I don;t think I will ever make another chicken salad!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made the chicken salad part of the recipe for my best friends bridal shower - everyone LOVED it! I doubled the lime juice and left out the pecans (nut allergies) and apple (plain forgot). I served it so that guest could put it on wheat bread, but most everyone ended up eating it on tortilla chips which turned out to be delicious!

I think this is a GREAT recipe, however, the mayo was a little heavy for me. I cut the mayo in half and added a little extra curry (it's my fave). I also added grapes (cause I had them). Served wrapped in whole-wheat tortillas, but this would be delicious on croissants, or any fancy bread. I will certainly make this again in the future! P.S. EVEN BETTER the second day!!

OMG! This was a great way to make chicken sandwiches. I have been trying to find a good recipe for cooked chicken for a long time. (I make a huge pot of chicken stock regularly and am always stuck on how to use the cooked chicken). I didn't add the cranberries and I'm surprised I even added apples as I normally don't add fruit to these types of dishes but I must say the apple enhanced the flavour. Yummy!

Made this yesterday for a co-worker baby shower and it turned out fabulous!  I tried adding a little Miracle Whip with the Mayo and decided it would be better left out next time, but other than that it was a hit!  Many compliments came from full mouths. :)

I made this recipe for my friend's baby shower along with some other finger sandwiches, and everybody loved it!  Since I love curry, I added a little extra curry.  Even one of the guests who said she didn't like curry ate it up!!!  Easy to make and store for tomorrow's lunch!

Loved this recipe.  I have been making a version of this for years and loved some of the new additions like the apples.  I used three chicken breasts, so I upped the curry to 1tsp and did 1/2c light mayo and 1/2c light miracle whip.

This recipe is fantastic!  I just served it at my sister's baby shower and at a picnic lunch the following day.  I do not use the lettuce leaf, AND I always serve it on croissants which make it that much better.  I was asked repeatedly for this recipe---everybody at the shower raved about it.  This is definitely one of my go to recipes.

Try a vegetarian version of this recipe in whole wheat pita pockets.  I used Quorn “Naked Chik’n cutlets”, defrosting them by cooking in Imagine Foods “no-chicken broth” for a few minutes.  I also boiled some frozen chicken breasts in the broth for my non-vegetarian family members.  The broth added flavor and I reused it after cooking to moisten my dog’s dry food.

I made this exactly as the ingredients were listed.  I also added some pineapple, simply because someone just gave me some fresh pineapple.  I also thought it needed a little salt to bring out the flavors.  This certainly is a terrific salad and would be great for a party

The flavor of the chicken was very unique. It was just ok for me, but my husband LOVED it! I made it a day ahead to let the flavors blend nicely and served open faced on mini-tea-sandwich bread.

Excellent Recipe for a quick meal! Just tried it few minutes ago. I am not a big fan of vegetables, but loved this recipe.  We had to omit some ingredients like dried cranberries, and used a green apple instead of a red apple. But still, it tasted great.

This is very good. I'm hispanic and our family get-togethers don't usually include things like german potato salad or waldorf salad,  but instead things like ceviche, so I didn't know how this would go over. Especially because I HATE german potato salad with a passion - it just has some strange seasoning, so I thought this might be similar. NOT AT ALL! This was very very good, and everyone agreed it tasted like thanksgiving turkey dinner all rolled into one serving! Excellent!

Great recipe for tea sandwiches!  I individually chopped each ingredient in a food processor to give it a more spreadable consistancy.  I made these for the first time at a Christmas tea and they looked very festive with the red from the cranberry and green from the green onion.  Everyone loved them!  I sent the left overs with my husband to his fire dept and the guys loved it as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Thanks for this recipe!  I made this for bridal shower, and it was the one item on the table of food that people asked to take home as leftovers!  Everyone loved it.  I did make the tiniest changes in the recipe. I subbed in baby spinach leaves for the lettuce since I had some leftover in the fridge.  I left out the green onions because I don't like onions.  Also, I cut the bread into heart shapes.

I made this as a regular sandwich filling. I omitted the cranberries as I don't like them, and used a combination of Gala and Granny Smith apples. Very good. The flavors work well together. Thanks!

I made this recipe before for a tea, but needed to make it for about 100 people.  I scaled it for that many people and it turned out delicious.  Was a great hit with the ladies.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I add 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of vinegar to give the mayo a coleslaw dressing vibe.  Been making this one for years, and it is ALWAYS a hit with family and friends.  Fantastic in a wrap with shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

This was very good!  I added a bit more curry than the recipe required.  As with most salads like this, it got even better as it sat.  So, I would suggest making this a day or two ahead.  You won't be disappointed!

I made this a day in advance and I think it did help bring out the flavors. I didn't use celery, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Delicious salad, although I thought it could have used some salt. The lime juice was a GREAT component, that really impressed me!

This is the best chicken salad I've ever tasted.  As far as mayo... I've found I prefer light mayo over regular or Miracle Whip.

This is quick to and easy! I boiled some chicken strips for about ten mins. I followed the recipe and next time will add a bit more curry. I use living lettuce; its healthy and oh so yummy. This is almost too simple to be good but is definitely a keeper for me!

Made this for a girls' bunco night and served with toast points.  Everyone loved it!  My hubby is a bit pickier and although he thought it was fine, he didn't rave quite as much.  Thinking about making again today for a potluck.

I made these for a tea party bridal shower that I hosted.  They were all eaten so I can't say they were bad, but for me they tasted like they were missing something.  I even used extra curry powder, but they tasted a little bland.

This recipe was great! I made this for a bridal shower and it was a hit.  The only thing I would change in the future is I'd cut back on the spring onions -- the curry powder adds enough of a kick.

My husband chose this recipe for our Church's Mother/Daughter Annual Tea party.  Everyone loves these sandwiches, so we always make extra for seconds and thirds.  We refer everyone to All Recipes to get the recipe for themselves to use.  This is an easy, but very delicious recipe.  I have it as a must keep for my recipe box.  :)

So easy and delicious.  I used pre cooked chicken strips from Costco and then I chopped them.  I had to leave out the nuts because of allergies, but I am know it would be delicious with almonds.  This is a keeper.

I love this!  I served it on mini crossaunts to my best friend and her two daughters during a girly get-together afternoon and all loved it.  I also added a little more cumin, might even add more next time.

WOW, crunchy, sweet...always the first salad to disappear.  The only thing I changed was that I did not used cubbed chicken but rather rotisserie chicken and pulled the white meat.  Oh, so yummy and fast to make.  I prefer to chop the apples into tiny tiny cubes.  Just made the salad without the bread and lettuce.

I was really excited to make this recipe because I love everything curry, but I was really disappointed at how it turned out.  I spent $26 on the items because I didn't have any of them, then I made the dish and it was bland.  Extremely bland.  The only thing I could taste were the cranberries. And because I don't throw anything away, I saved the left overs (this recipe makes a lot of mix) until the next day.  Sometimes foods are better after sitting for a while...I took it out of the fridge and tried some but found out that it had already spoiled.  In 1 day!  Pretty much $26 gone.

This was really good.  If you don't like curry, you probably won't like them, but you might.  If you do like curry, you will definately like these. Light, a nice crunch, flavorful.  YUM

This turned out very well, despite the fact that I didn't have a few of the ingredients. I added just a few sprinkles of curry because I was wary of how it would taste, but it was so scrumptious! The curry is a wonderful touch. Thanks!

Absolutely loved this recipe!! Truly deserving of the 5 stars. I used almonds because I didn't have pecans or walnuts and it still turned out great. I also didn't have the curry spice. So I subsituted with an all-spice, garlic powder and extra salt/pepper. It still turned out great and with the curry spice I bet it'd be even better. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.

I served this recipe at a wedding reception and everyone loved it! We had made the recipe as a curried chicken salad with rolls on the side. Everyone wanted the recipe! I used pink lady apples and dried cherry cranberries with mayonnaise instead of salad dressing. We topped the salad with cranberries and pecans. Wonderful recipe!

I made this today from leftover chicken that I roasted for dinner last might.  I roasted it with this recipe in mind!  It was fabulous.  I love the combination of soft chicken, crunchy celery and nuts, sweet apples and chewy cranberries.  I will make this as often as I roast a chicken!  Perfect anytime of year.  Thanks! 
 I've been using this recently as a pasta salad.  I just up the dressing a little and toss it with mini penne.  It's been really popular with my family.

Very good!  Great flavors.  I used extra pecans and about half the mayo mix.  Will definitely make again for the next party.

I used this recipe for an Afternoon Tea party and it was a big hit!  I did cut back on the dried cranberries to 1/2 cup and increased the curry powder to 2 tsp. since I wanted more of a curry taste, yet it was still very subtle. Else, it's such an easy and very delicious recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Used a lot more curry powder than in the recipe - and I put it in philo dough cups, it was the hit of the party - so much so that people were making note that I was the guy who made the "curry things".

I just made these to try them out for an upcoming party.  I did not have any cranberries, but used strawberries instead.  They were delicious.  Next time I will add more pecans and more curry.

I was in charge of the tea sandwiches at my friends baby-shower, and because of the wonderful reviews I decided to give it a try. Everyone LOVED it!! I had made tons and it was all gone within minutes! I left out a little bit of the apple and celery and completely omitted the onion and it tasted even better! This one a sure to please!!!!!!!

Excellent chicken salad.  The longer this sat, the better it tasted...4 days it was the best!  The only changes I made where adjustments to the dressing because I didn't have enough mayo.  So I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 salad dressing  & some sour cream along with the lime juice and curry.

I was missing the apples and green onions when I started making this recipe, but I could have sworn I had curry powder.  Apparently I don't have it, so I substituted paprika and turmeric, which I know aren't the same.  But it was good anyway.  I like the cranberries and pecans and I think the apples would add another nice crunch.  So maybe when I actually have the ingredients called for I'll try it again!

I made this recipe for my sister's baby shower.  I didn't add the pecans because I knew that someone was allergic to nuts, and for ease of eating, I just rolled it in wraps.  Let me tell you, EVERYONE RAVED about this recipe!  They even asked what caterer I used! (Which is probably the greatest compliment a home cook can get) Thanks!

This was a pretty good sandwich. My husband (who is very picky) ate it, but was not overly impressed with it.  I thought it was a nice change to ordinary sandwiches, but probably will not make again due to my husbands preferences.
