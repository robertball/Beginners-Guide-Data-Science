Really good, although I couldn't find any tamarind extract.  Used a little cumin instead and it still turned out good.

Make this chutney last night for Indian dinner party to serve with pakora recipe that I also found on this site.  I didnÂ´t have tamarind so I used cumin and garam masala to season.  It made quite a bit for what I needed (as a dipping sauce) so next time I will half the recipe.

We love indian food. I was so happy to find this recipe,as we love chutneys at our favorite Indian restaurants. This is so good and easy to prepare.
