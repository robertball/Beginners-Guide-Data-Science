Let me tell you how I did my Beer Cake.  First, I did not have a yellow cake mix but I had a Butter cake mix and I used that.  I did not have vanilla pudding but  I had Lemon pudding and used that.  For adding the beer I used a cup like it said but used the regular directions off the cake mix box.  Mixed it all up and baked it like the recipe said to. Then after it was baked I left it in the Tube pan while I made a glaze for it.  What I did was use the rest of the beer about 4oz then added about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of butter and a 1 1/3 cup of sugar put it all in a sauce pan and brought it to a boil to make it like a syrup.  I poured some over the top of the cake let it soak in then I took cake flipped it on to a plate and drizzled more on the top.  Let me tell you that was the most moist cake I had ever had.  I had so many comments on it everyone thought it was AWESOME!!!!

I made this cake as an alternative for those who do not eat ice-cream cake that I served at my daughters 8th birthday party.  It was a very big hit among all the adults and several of the kids enjoyed it too.  I made the cake using Pillsbury yellow cake mix and French Vanilla instant pudding mix and a bottle of Budwiser Beer.  I also used exra large eggs.  The batter was extremely easy and you need to beat it on high for a couple of minutes.  It will become thick and smooth.  The cake is very light and fluffy, probably due to the beer.  I sprinkled the cake with powdered sugar and it gave it just the right amount of sweetness - is was just perfect.  A great way to make a boxed cake just a notch better.

While I was searching for a cake recipe (on the best on-line recipe finder site), I "stumbled" across this Beer Cake and am I glad I did!! All the ingredients were even on hand!! My hubby said QUOTE "Don't lose that recipe, it's the best cake you've ever made" Kinda hurt my feelings since I bake alot and always try making cakes with all the "fancy" ingredients...We even made Strawberry Shortcake the next day and it was better than using a pound cake for that!!

I first tried this recipe about four years ago, and it's become a favorite request in our house. If you have issues with tasting the beer, try using diet cream soda. For a friend who doesn't approve of alcohol, I made this recipe using diet vanilla cream soda. It turned out great and prevented the usual slight banana flavor I get when using a light beer. The cream soda is especially good with white cake mix and white chocolate pudding.

The best thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. Thanks for a great recipe!

Now now, be nice "Aragona" - this is a fantastic recipe - esspecially for people like me who are too busy to make every dessert they serve from scratch. No one could tell it wasn't entirely homemade!! This cake gets even better the next day and has become a favorite with my boyfriend (who piggishly ate half himself throughout the day!!:)) I'm keeping this great recipe!! Thanks Val for sharing it!!!

This is how I like my cake!!  The MOST moist cake I've ever made.  I used 5% alcohol apple cider instead of beer, and it's got a hint of apple flavor to it.  Wonder recipe!!!

wonderful cake!  I made two 9" rounds and baked for 25-30 minutes at 350.  I added the zest and juice of one lemon and 1 teaspoon lemon extract to make a lemon cake.  Turned out very moist and delicious.  Iced with Special Buttercream Frosting.  Guests loved it.

This cake is a winner!!  I made it on Mother's Day and everybody loved it.  I used an English imported beer called Newcastle Brown Ale.  It was great in the cake and I enjoyed drinking the other bottles too!   I used a cream cheese frosting I found on this website too.  I am going to buy another fancier bundt cake pan just for this recipe.  Thanks Val for sharing this - you're a sweetheart!!!

The beer and cake was a bad mix. I couldn't get past the smell and the taste of beer was very strong. It was kind of dry as well. I will not make again.

Sadly, my review is based on the taste of small bits that stuck to my poorly greased bundt pan, as I made this for a benefit bake sale.  I baked the cake according to directions, though I didn't measure the beer, just guesstimated, using a bottle of Molson Canadian.  For a glaze, I used the rec of other reviewers and combined Sam Adams Octoberfest beer (maybe 6oz), 1 1/3 C sugar, and 2 tbls butter in a saucepan on high.  I boiled for 5 minutes, then let it cool a little and drizzled it over the cake.  It was VERY thick (perhaps because I cooked too long?), so if you do this do NOT let it totally cool or it won't be drizzle-able!  I then sprinkled the glazed cake w/crushed pretzel pieces. While I wasn't able to taste it all together, the bites of cake and licks of the glaze spoon tasted awesome!  I tried to convince my SMIL to sell it by the piece, as opposed to a whole cake, just so i could try a slice!  TY for a nice different cake recipe!

I can't believe this cake is SO easy and SO good! I used a yellow cake mix and Coors light. I couldn't find my bundt pan so I used a 10 inch pyrex glass rectangle (still followed baking time and temp.). There are so many things you could top this cake with like cool whip, ice cream, fresh fruit, cream cheese icing... but it is the best just plain!  It baked up so moist and fluffy, it has been so hard not to scarf the whole thing up!! The smell alone is delicious, the taste is heavenly! This is my new go-to cake recipe, hands down!!!!

This was fantastic!  I took some other's suggestions: I used yellow cake mix, lemon pudding, and Blue Moon wheat beer in the batter.  The better the quality of beer, the better the taste.  I took another reviewer's recipe for glaze (remaining 4 oz beer, 2 T. butter, 1 1/2 c. sugar and added the juice of half a lemon).  When the cake came out, I poked holes with a skewer and poured half the hot glaze mixture over it.  I let it rest 15 minutes, turned it out, and poured the remaining glaze over the top.  Delicious!

I made this with dark choc cake mix, choc pudding mix, and a chocolate stout (beer).  The batter was really thick, but it baked up really light. Yummy.

I made this with a white cake mix as a trial run and it was amazing. I made one with a yellow cake mix for the guy next door and it also turned out really well... a very light fluffy cake if you don't put in the pudding... i had cake mix with pudding in it already and didn't want it to be too solid if i would have added more. I also made the glaze another member suggested and it was amazing on top...4 oz beer (1/2 cup) 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and sugar i put in a little more sugar though 2/3 cups because it was too thin otherwise.... thanks to the member that suggested the glaze and gave the ingredients!

I have been making cake this way for a few years, except I add a can of ginger ale.  You can use ginger ale for any flavor cake..carrot, white, chocolate...and it it crazy moist.  Almost like a torte.  Also add a scoop or two of sour cream to the batter, makes the cake so rich.  Note:  you will have to increase the baking time if you add an entire can of soda!

I've been making this cake for a few years now, it's GREAT!!! Coming up with new variations is part of the fun.  I've done white cake, pistachio pudding and Monster Energy Drink, very yummy.  Also yellow cake with cheesecake pudding and Strawberry Bacquardi, delicish!!  The options are endless.

We do a cookoff/Iron Chef with friends, this cake won our cooking with Beer Competition!!!

My husband and his friends loved this cake. We used Sam Adams beer and it worked great. The beer made the cake light, fluffy, and moist.  NOTE: this cake tasted much better on the second day, after the beer flavor had settled in and became less overpowering.

Excellent. I only had a 1.5oz. box of vanilla pudding, but it still turned out beautifully! I topped it with caramel icecream topping, toffee, and a bit of homemade streusel. Delicious. I shall make this one again!

A friend of mine left some Coors Light at my house.  I don't drink beer so thought I would make this for Father's Day.  Very good and easy to make, especially for someone who doesn't like baking.  We couldn't taste the beer at all.

I make this all the time.  I like it without any frosting and cheap beer that doesn't have much flavor works better than wasting my microbrews on it.  I've made a chocolate variation using chocolate mixes but I like the original the best.

Used a stout beer because we really like the beer flavor. Cake was nice and light and flavorful. Used a whipped cream and powdered sugar frosting and sprinkled it with crunch up pretzels. Yuuummmm!

This cake is yummy, though like other reviewers I found it tastes just like a very nice basic yellow cake. Even though I used a dark beer (Shiner Black) and even added some cinnamon the flavor just didn't come through. I will make this again, though I'll try with a Guinness, a coffee porter, or a chocolate stout to see if using a heavier and more flavorful beer will help. I may also try making a glaze or frosting of some sort for the cake using the beer.

I am in college and made this cake for a bunch of boys, they ate it ALL in one sitting! My roommate who is a chef told me I HAD to make it again because it was so great! I was surprised, haha.  I did it a little differently than the recipe, and I made a Kahlua frosting that I DEFINITELY recommend, it was a perfect pairing with this cake! I made the cake according to the directions on the box, adding to the mixture french vanilla pudding mix and a cup of beer. While the cake was out of the oven and cooling I blended about 3 cups of powdered sugar with 1/3 cup of butter and maybe half a cup of Kahlua. I also added a few tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, it made the frosting fluffier! Then I just layered it on the cake thick. TRY THIS im serious it was so good and such a success

I made 2 of these using 2 kinds of beer and served them at a party for 20 people last week.  One was a spice cake with regular American beer and the other was chocolate cake with a stout beer. There was not a crumb left and I was asked a dozen times for the recipe. At least 4 people told me they really don't enjoy cake much but this changed their mind.   Guess us country folk enjoy this type of cake more then some others do. But I know I will make it again and again.

Wonderful cake.   Very easy and moist.  Will definitely make again.  My kids loved it.  
Made Cake again 2/7/12 - Changed a few things. Added 2 Tablespoons sour cream and about 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  Used a Yuengling Lager..Delicious.

A very delicious and moist (lemon) cake. I used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, added instant lemon pudding mix and the juice of half a lemon to the batter. For beer, I used a Sierra Nevada Torpedo, an IPA that goes well with lemon. The cake did not taste at all like beer, but was very light and moist. I made a glaze using the juice of a whole lemon, and about 1/4 cup of sugar, microwaved it until hot, and poured it on top of the cake after it cooled. The only slight complaint I had was that it was fairly sweet due to the pudding and cake mix - but overall, still yummy.

I made this cake for the first time yesterday and it was amazing.  I was worried it would taste to beery but the cake was eaten quickly.  I did use the syrup described in one of the other reviews and poured it on the cake before removing it from the pan.  I also heated up and poured Pilsberry cream cheese frosting on top.  Very good and I will make it again.

The cake turned out really moist....  The only thing I did different was followed the instructions on the box, with the filling, and using Guiness Beer instead of water.  Easy to make and really good!

This cake was delicious.  My family and I really enjoyed it.  I will make it again real soon.  I could not detect the beer in it at all.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract but other than that, I followed the recipe completely.  Thanks Val.

I was surprised with how moist this was! I used non stick cooking spray and floured the pan but the cake still stuck a little bit. I topped it with the Vanilla Glaze    that I found on this website. Perfect!

I love this recipe, so yummy & easy.  I took this cake to work for a tailgate party (what’s a tailgate party without beer,lol) and it was gobbled up.  I used butterscotch pudding that I had on hand and took REGINA73 suggestion of making the glaze, 1 1/3 cups sugar, rest of beer &  2 tbs butter then boil, when cake came out of oven let rest about 5 min then poked holes and poured glaze over cake, let it sit in pan for about 15 min, then turned it out, let it cool and drizzled a glaze (powered sugar and milk) over the cake, very moist & good.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. It filled the bundt pan to the top. The cake is more like a chiffon texture.
Topped simply with powdered sugar, it makes a simple light dessert.

I noticed that many folks were unsure as to what kind of beer to choose. I selected a flavored beer Blue Moon's Pumkin ale. The cake turned out with a pumkin spice flavor. I have thought of useing lemon pudding and a summer shandy ale, which is a lemonade beer. happy cake making

I have made this cake about 20 times, using variations on the theme (using chocolate cake, lemon, nuts...), and I have never had any left over.  It's so moist and delicious, and it tastes EXCELLENT with coffee.

I had a bottle of Corona in the fridge for past several months and decided to try this.  I used a classic white Pillsbury mix and white chocolate instant pudding (only combo I had on hand I thought would work).  It beats up nicely, a very thick batter.  I was concerned because I licked the beater and it left a tart burning sensation in my mouth for about 3 hours.  The few crumbs I tasted did leave a bit of that same aftertaste but by today the flavors had mellowed.  I had leftover "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting" from this site(really super!) so frosted the bundt cake with that and made a white confectioner's glaze with sherry to drizzle.  Looked very pretty and the glaze added a nice touch.  Everyone raved.  Ease of preparation, super moist, and very sturdy cake to remove from bundt pan give this a '4'.  Also a conversation piece dessert.  Folks got a kick out of the beer as an ingredient.  I would definitely make again if I had an extra bottle of beer.

The cake does turn out extremely moist; however it tastes just like a cake mix cake.  Probably would not make again just because we don't keep beer in the house.

I made this cake last night, FINALLY, and it is a really good basic cake.  It does need
a little something to make it special though like strawberries and whipped cream,
or a cream cheese glaze, or whatever else you can think of.  A really good cake with a nice
light flavor.  Definately not too sweet.  Just make sure the beer you use isn't beer...see the recommendations
for types of beer that I posted earlier.

This turned out well. I added a chocolate stout as the beer and it added a rich flavor. To top it I made a glaze of sugar, combined with beer and drizzled it over the top. Once it hardened it created a nice texture and was a hit with my beer brewing-uncle whom I made it for.

It's a nice moist yellow cake.  I made add Lemon in it next time as another reviewer did.  I used Yuengling Lager light.  You do not taste the beer at all.  If your tasting it then you have probably added the can not a cup.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this cake turned out to be. I made a glaze out of beer, powdered sugar and a bit of butter and it was delicious poured over the cake. Also, this cake gets better as it sits. Yesterday I made another, this time with chocolate fudge cake mix and chocolate fudge pudding with almost as good results.

This recipe is sooo versatile!   I made it with pumpkin spice pudding and cranberry lambic beer, both of which are in season right now in New Hampshire.  I also tossed in a cup of chopped frozen cranberries.  Delicious!

This is better (my personal opinion) with devils food cake, dark chocolate pudding and guinness extra stout.  That bumps it up to 5 stars for me.

My kids and husband liked it, but I didn't. I followed the recipe exactly. If I do make it again, I will need to make a few changes.

It was okay. My husband liked it. You should specify what type of Beer you used. We live in Germany so I used a German beer. Not sure if that was why I didn't like it. I'm not a beer fan to begin with.

Pretty good!  I used 2 (1.34 oz) boxes of sugar-free french vanilla instant pudding, bud light & added 3 Tbsp lemon juice (which I couldn't taste at all) and dusted it with powdered sugar.  It had a wonderful texture but did not rise very much.  My husband and the kids loved it!  UPDATE: I made with 3 (1oz) boxes sugar-free pudding (2 lemon & 1 vanilla).  I also added 1 Tbsp lemon extract to the batter which resulted in only a slight lemon flavor.  The cake is very moist & soft & the crumb turns out different from a plain boxed cake.  I always ONLY BAKE 45 MINUTES.  I think it would be dry if I baked any longer.  It's an easy way to put a little twist on a box cake mix!  Next time I'll try chocolate!

I did not care for this recipe.  i thought the beer taste would have mixed in, but it was like drinking a beer and eating cake at the same time.

Good cake.  The kids loved it. For our cake we used french vanilla cake mix, sugar free white chocolate pudding and miller light.
I also sprinkled chocolate chips on the cake batter before baking- they form a "crust" on the bottom when you flip the cake over.  Thanks for the recipe!
Oh- I only had 3 eggs and it turned out fine.

This cake is amazing  soooo moist & delicious!  My husband loves it (he said it is better than his mom's pound cake...shhh, don't tell!).  If you don't like the taste of beer, then use a light beer (Coors, etc.)

This cake was good but not great, it was moist and for some reason there was a beer aftertaste, I wasn't sure what beer to use. I used Yuengling beer, would it been better if it was some other brand or kind?  Overall, a good tasting cake with coffee.

I used an angel food cake pan also and had no problem of overflow.  This cake was okay for a function, but I would not make it for my family.  I used left over flat beer.  There was no adverse taste.  I took it to work and noone detected the beer.

I made this for my mothers birthday.  I used a cream cheese frosting and yellow cake mix.  Everyone loved it, the entire thing was gone by the end of the night.  I will be making this again!!  I also made this for a co-workers birthday, but used chocolate cake instead, I didn't like it as well as the yellow cake.  It was still good with the chocolate, but I just prefer it with yellow cake mix.

This cake was moist and had a good texture, but I found the beer taste sort of odd and unpleasant. My husband said he couldn't taste the beer, and had asked me if the cake had rum in it before I told him the "secret" ingredient.

I took this cake to work with me and it was gone in minutes. I did think that it was funny that my version had a sort of bannana tast to it. I quess that may have come from my choice of beer. Heiniken!

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our house! My husband begs for more.  You cannot taste the beer in it. The nice thing is the easy ingredients.  The first time I made it I was just searching for a cake recipe in which I had all the ingredients in the house and this was the one. I am sure you can easily vary this recipe with chocolate cake and chocolate pudding or any combination you like. Enjoy!

This cake is very easy to make and is exceedingly moist, but guess what you can taste/smell the beer. I used french vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, 2 tsp of vanilla extract, and I covered the cake in confectioner's glaze and I could still taste the beer. (This isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is evident)

Made this for a block party.  i used a Butter yellow cake mix, French Vanilla pudding and Woodchuck Amber beer (nice subtle apple taste!) Got great reviews from everyone!  Made a glaze as suggested by others, with about 1/2 cup of the beer and some butter and powdered sugar and let it soak into the cake...then sprinkled w a little powdered sugar when i served it.  Tasted great!  Keeper!

This cake turned out GREAT! And was a big hit! But I did decide to take it up a notch and rather than using regular beer I used a Cherry Wheat Beer. I also made a glaze with the same beer. It was fantastic! Very moist and the glaze was just the beer and powdered sugar. I think if I use the same beer again I will put in maraschino cherries. But I plan to experiment with the stouts and maybe some chocolate chips

Holy Guacamole! This cake was awesome! I cooked according to recipe, but used Stout beer. I also added the glaze as suggested in earler reviews. The result was a moist, beery, and totally awesome cake. I will add this to my collection, for sure. There are lots of great ways to change & vary this recipe. It's a keeper!

This recipe is great. The beer does give a slight banana-like taste, but it's great. I used 2 nine inch round pans and put it in for about 35 minutes. Be careful not to overfill the pans as it tends to get soggy in the middle if you do. I used a dark chocolate buttercream which was amazing with the flavors.

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe.  I thought it tasted like a yellow cake with a little zip.  It was not that moist and no one would eat it.

I used this receipe but I used root beer soda instead of the beer! It was a great hit and I made a glaze with rootbeer and confectioners sugar.

Try using New Belgium 1554 which has a chocolaty flavor to it. You can also make a glaze with it to drizzle if you want more of the beers rich, flavor. Sunshine Wheat with grated orange zest is also another option.

This recipe is a hit! I took Golden Beer (very mild German Beer) and it was fantasticly fluffy! I made muffins in the microwave for 1 1/2 mins. at 850 watts and it turned out wonderful. The main batter was in the oven and similar tasteful but not that quick ;)

I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and substituted sparkling apple cider in place of beer for a bit more flavor.  This was a huge success and everyone raved about it.  Topped with some vanilla icing, the cake turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful.    ALTITUDE NOTE: We live at 6,000 ft so I increased the amount of cider by 2 tbsp., which was the perfect amount for our dry, thin air.

I made this cake for the first time on Sunday. It was wonderful! I made it for a bunch of guys at a car dealership (so I'm not sure if they loved just just because it had beer in it, or if it was truly delicious), but it was very moist.   I threw a hand-full of dark chocolate and white chocolate chips into the batter. I also iced it all over, not just a drizzle - that way when I sliced it, every piece had a good amount of icing on it.

This was awesome.  Very easy to make and super moist.   When I told my daughter I made a beer cake... she was hesitant, but when she tried it, she kept picking on it all day long.

I tried this recipe using a devil's food cake mix, didn't add the pudding (I didn't have any) and used Guinness Stout Beer. I iced it with a chocolate buttercream frosting from this site. I brought it to a Bday BBQ, and everyone liked this cake more than the one they bought for the birthday. There wasn't any left to bring home! Next time I will try it with the pudding mix.

My grandaughter requested a yellow cake with chocolate frosting so I tried this one and she gave it a thumbs up, so I know I will be making this one again. It is a nice moist cake.

I used DOS EQUIS beer.  It's very moist.  I didn't really detect the beer flavor in it...maybe only slightly.  It baked in only 45 minutes so check your cake early.  Dump it out of the bundt pan while the pan is still warm.  Use shortening, not margarine or oil, to grease pans, as margarine and oil absorb more readily into the batter causing it to stick.

I made this for a fried's bachelor party that i was helping my husband host.  I figured it kinda fit their theme of Beer!  My husband asked me only 2 hours before the party if i could make a cake and some snacks for them.  I got on here and found that recipe and cooked it up quickly!  Everyone loved it.  I made 2 pans of it and the 11 people at the party ate every last bite within an hour!  The soon to be married even told me i had to give his soon to be wife the recipe!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a gathering and usually I 'wow' the croud with what I make.  This didn't impress a soul.  I made it because all the men I know love beer and would get a kick out of eating BEER cake but I should have made something else.  Sorry, I won't make this again.

No.  I followed exactly, and I did not care for the flavor of this recipe.  I agree with others that the beer left a "bannana-ey" flavor.  It was very moist, I'll give it that, and easy...but none of that mattters if no one will eat it!

I regularly make beer pancakes, so I was looking forward to this cake recipe. I was very disappointed... it was too done (and I even adjusted the time to meet my oven's uniqueness) and it tasted too much like beer (maybe with an "off" banana taste. I tried it for several days, thinking it might get better with age, but I was wrong. Too bad, because I was really looking forward to it.

First, I have to say that I followed the recipe to a tee.  However...  I kept checking the cake and knew that bunt pans can cause the exterior to get brown while the inside is still getting done.  I kept telling myself that with this one.  I finally took it out at only 46 mins (not 55) and it was BLACK!!!  I double checked oven temp, and reread the recipe.  It seemed I had done everything right.  Ended up baking a mix cake right afterwards (was preparing for hubby's suprise party) and it went right by the time on the box.  Not sure what happened, but be very careful on how long you cook this one!  The inside tasted great! ; (

I made this cake with several changes.  My son was over last weekend and opened a bottle of a dark beer with heavy coffee overtones. He wanted to throw it out so I refrigerated it to use it in this cake with devil's food cake mix, chocolate pudding as well as a cup of  chocolate chips.  Iced with a cream cheese/whipped cream frosting...this cake was absolutely delicious.  Divided into two 9" pans and froze one.

Made this cake for years and then lost the recipe. So glad I found it here! My whole family loves this. Every time I make it, there is nothing left but crumbs. No wait, I ate the crumbs.

It's good but the outside of the cake is drier than I'd like. The insides are very fluffy. I did modify it from the original: I used an Imperial cherrywood smoked stout, German chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding mix. I made a chocolate ganache for topping, basically just melted chocolate and more stout. That was amazing on top. Good recipe probably will make again but try to modify so it's not so hard on the outside.

I was skeptical about this cake because I don't like beer, but I know alcohol doesn't taste the same when you cook with it, and I was curious since I've never tried anything like this before, so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did--it's great. Didn't have yellow cake mix, so I used vanilla and added a little lemon extract to give it extra zing. I also made the syrup as listed by Regina73. The perfect finishing touch, in my opinion. Makes it more moist and adds an extra hit of sweetness. This one's a keeper. Added to the saved file and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this for the first time as a trial run before my fiance's birthday and it turned out amazing, even better than I thought.  And I don't even drink beer but if it tasted like this cake, I totally would. I took somebody else's advice and used the rest of the beer as a glaze and it made it even better. I'm sure after this, my fiance is going to want this cake for ever birthday.

This is really nice!  Wanted something a bit different and this was!  I finished the cake with a beer and lime glaze (as per the most helpful positive review, I just added lime juice) and I just made the cake with the mix, beer, four eggs and oil.  I didn't have vanilla pudding mix and it didn't affect it at all.  Really good!

Wow! this cake rocked!I will be making it again and again. I tried the glaze like others had suggested, um..... no thanks. I instead made a beer buttercream. A little on the runny side, but it took the cake over the top. Thank you!

I really like this easy recipe. I threw it together tonight because I needed an easy dessert for my husband and his friend with stuff I already had in my pantry. I baked it in an 8x8 pan (because I don't have a bundt pan) for about 35 minutes at 350. I had to cover the top with foil after about 20 minutes to keep it from getting too browned. I served it warm with fresh cut up strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. My hubby and his friend each ate 2 pieces! Definite winner and will try it again. Oh and the beer flavor was very mild and tasty! I used coors light.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  This is absolutely the moistest cake I have ever ever made.  UNBELIEVABLE.  I can't figure out how the beer does this but you need to try this to see how incredibly moist and delicious it is.

I literally made this less than two hours ago, took it to my husband's work to try on people, and he MADE me bring it back. Only because he loved it and everyone else, so it is already almost gone. I followed the recipe like Regina73 suggested. Good, but I'm gonna try to find some sort of not-as-sweet icing that's a little thicker over the top of the cake. The cake was too sweet for me, so I could only handle a little of it. Still I bought a whole 6-pack of beer just to make this again (hopefully will help satiate my husband's sweet tooth!)

The beer ingredient sounded strange, but I wanted a quick recipe for dessert and happened to have a can of beer in the fridge.  Am I glad I found this recipe!  I used a white cake mix.  And because my 4 eggs were extra large, I added about 1/3 cup of flour and a bit of extra beer to the whole mix.  Sprinkled the cooled cake with some powdered sugar -- what a wonderful and light treat.  So moist!!  This is a keeper.

I made this for my son's 20th Birthday! It was a big hit and he is not a real cake fan! I used Yuengling beer & a cream cheese frosting also on this site drizzeled on top. It would be good without any frosting. Will make this again.

I tried out this recipe for my friend's birthday, and there were absolutely no scraps left! It was delicious!! I made it exactly as written, only I used "Butter Recipe Yellow cake mix, and added lemon and orange peel shavings. I opted for good old fashion Budweiser for the beer and it turned out great. Oh, and Pilsbury's WHIPPED Cream Cheese frosting was my finishing touch! enjoy..

This was a very easy recipe, very moist and sweet cake, although I didn't exactly follow the directions.  Instead of using just 1 cup of beer, I found it easier to just use the whole bottle (Bud light).  I only had white cake and pumpkin spice pudding, so that was the combination I used.  The pumpkin spice was really quite subtle, so the cake just tasted very sweet, and there was no hint of beer flavor at all.  I also only had 3 eggs, but the cake turned out fine.  Very moist, almost sticky, but quite good.  Next time I would recommend just using a cake mix that already has pudding in it, b/c adding the pudding mix seems to double the sweetness - the sweetness from the cake mix AND the pudding mix.  It's a little much, I think, but still delicious... just nothing to rave about.

I made this because I had all the ingredients in the house already and I wanted to try something different than beer bread. It's moist and flavorful- I love how beer can give dessert a certain depth of flavor! I will definitely make this often!

I have made this cake several times and everyone always loves it.  I like to drizzle a dark chocolate glaze on it.  I usually use cheap beer and it doesn't have a strong aftertaste it actually tastes more like bananas.  It makes a good birthday cake for adults.  Thanks for the recipe!

this cake is so exceptional for such an easy recipe.  I've made it everytime for birthdays and always get rave reviews.  too bad it's not my own recipe!!  I usually use Newcastle for the beer,  it has a really great flavor unlike coors or budlight.

I agree with all the comments about this being a very moist cake....it was.  But I couldn't get passed the "off" taste it seemed to have from the beer.  However, My husband didn't seem to notice and he liked the cake, which was good, since I didn't like it he had to eat it all. Sorry, but I won't make it again.

My family is crazy about chocolate so they were a little skeptical. It was a hit! Very moist. I didn't alter the original recipe at all.

This cake didn't turn out right for me. It certainly wasn't moist. Don't plan on making it again.

What fun!  The kids and I just made this for my husband as a surprise and he is going to love it!  A little piece fell off (my fault because I didn't grease it well enough) and I HAD to eat ot and it is YUMMY!  I used a lemon cake mix with the vanilla pudding and frosted it with the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting recipe found on AllRecipes.  YUM!

This was a great cake and I plan to make it again and again. But, we don't like it alone. I think it needs a glaze or something with it. We had strawberries on top of each piece and loved it that way.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my husband's homecoming from Australia. Many other wives baked cupcakes, but mine were the only ones that ran out! Everybody loved them! No one could taste the beer, but everyone marveled at how light, tender, and moist the cupcakes were. This is a great recipe, and I will definatly use it again!

This has got to be the only cake recipe you'll ever need. The simplicity of the ingredients lend themselves to variation. Our favorite, White cake w/white chocolate pudding. It makes a nice high,light cake.
