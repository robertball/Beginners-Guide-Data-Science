I enjoyed making this dish.  Next time I need to use more Swiss Chard because the bunch I got had a lot of leaves that looked like they were starting to spoil.  I also put more lemon in for the fish, but that is just a personal preference.  I will be making this again!

Tried cooking this meal tonight.  It was actually very tasty, and is a very nutritious meal.  The Quinoa is labeled a "super food" and Swiss Chard is one of the most nutritious vegetables.  Add the benefits of Salmon and garlic, and you have a winner.  It also tastes very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the presentation.  It doesn't really look very attractive, but it's worth it for the taste and quality of the meal.

Well this is just fabulous!  I did grill my salmon with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Otherwise made as written and it is so, so good!

Absolutely my family's favorite recipe from this website. Didn't need to change a thing, although made it once with kale due to what the store had and that was great too.

Very bland.  Felt like it was a waste of such nutritous ingredients.

Loved this dish. Used powdered vegetable stock which packs a punch in terms of flavour. Served with a beautiful crisp Chardonnay it makes a perfect meal. Will definitely  add this to my favourites list.

This was just "okay".  It was missing some flavors.  The left overs I put in a "quick quiche" recipe from this site and that was great!

I totally misread the recipe.  I had pre-marinated salmon fillets and was looking for a swiss chard recipe when I picked this one.  So, I grilled the salmon and made the rest as a side dish and it was very good!  The lemon juice really added just the right flavor.  I'll be making this again!

Healthy and tasty nothing stood out to me in flavors, but knowing I got everything recommended in my pregnancy food list was great!

It was ok.  I toasted the quinoa for the first time, and it took away the "dirt" flavor - definitely recommend doing this.

This was delicious, easy, and reasonably quick to make....and so darn healthy. This is a keeper recipe. I made one small addition of a bay leaf to the wine broth and that was it.
