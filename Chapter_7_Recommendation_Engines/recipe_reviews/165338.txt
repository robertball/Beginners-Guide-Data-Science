I used powdered sugar for a creamier version and a double recipe frosted my layer cake.  So so good.  I also don't like overly sweet frostings.  On a dense chocolate cake it was awesome.  And if you don't have a food processor buy one.  It made this soooo easy.  I dumped the ingredients in, turned it on and just frosted the cake for a very quick and easy frosting.  Did I mention I love this recipe?  Yum.  Oh and I just used my blade attachment.

I was looking for a frosting for a very rich chocolate cake with a very rich filling.  I wanted a frosting that was not too heavy or too sweet.  This was perfect!  It was so easy to make and tasted great.  Everyone raved about the entire cake.  
I don't have a whipping attachment for my food processor, so I made it with my mixer and it was still very easy. 
I followed the recipe exactly.  Don't change a thing!

This is a GREAT change!  We're from the U.S.A. but my husband is teaching at a university in China and the students love to try western food.  The girls LOVE sweet, but most of the boys do not.  Getting ready to frost a birthday cake for one of the boys, I was looking for a new recipe and by mistake clicked twice on the "sort by rating" and the description "too sweet for me" caught my eye.  Everyone, even the girls, loved it!  My husband really liked it!  Since I do not have a food processor, I just whipped it with the mixer.  Thanks for a nummy alternative to rich frosting!

We thought this was incredible.  Has an almost chocolate ice-cream flavor to it with the fluffy cream and the cocoa.  We assumed this needed to be refrigerated (recipe may have said it, don't remember), but that added to the "ice cream cake" sort of feel.  First chocolate cake we were all fighting to polish off in a long time! Thanks for the simple, wonderful recipe.

I used this on Italian Love Cake (also found on this site) instead of the cool whip and pudding frosting...I try to avoid one molecule away from plastic, non-dairy whipped topping at all costs.  It was perfect with that cake!  This frosting is also excellent on angel food cake!  I add a packet of whipped cream stabilizer.  The cream never gets "weepy" so my cake never gets soggy, even a few days later.

I've always been a fan of sugary frosting, but wow! this stuff rocks! I made this in the Magic Bullet blender and it turned out perfectly. I was able to frost an entire birthday cake and then eat some on its own! Will definately make this a staple of my cake making.

CURL YOUR TOES, FINGERS AND CROSS YOUR EYES GOOD! N'uff said? LOL....but really, I made a "stabilized" version of this which only adds gelatin so the whipped cream won't fall apart but other then that followed to the letter and WOWZER-DOWZER it's yummy!  I bake smaller cakes and freeze them for later use since we are only 2 people here and this went on a freezer cake for dessert tonight!  THANK A GA-ZALLION times for sharing this puppy.

Delicious! It was so YUMMY! I absolutely DESPISE sugary frostings and dry cakes.  I did this frosting as a peace offering to my BF who loves SUGARY frosting but would have to settle for light whipped frosting instead since I never frost cakes. Both he and my Mom enjoyed it!!! I made a 2 layer round chocolate cake (my ALL TIME FAV that never needs icing from Hershey's - HERSHEY'S "PERFECTLY CHOCOLATE" Chocolate Cake)  and this barely made enough to go between the layers and around the cake once assembled. I will be sure to double next time! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I made this frosting in an electric mixer. It is great. I used it to ice the white layer cake I found on this site. It was such a great combination of flavor. This icing is some of the best I have ever had. I would highly recommend it! I had to mix up some more icing for the layer cake because I needed a lot more icing than I realized this recipe prepared.

WOW! SOOOOOOO Amazing! and not to mention simple!  I modified it just a bit, it was a bit too strong dark chocolate for me so I added about 4 tablespoons of confectioners sugar and 1/4 cup more cream. can't wait for the reviews of the co-workers!

this was perfect!  I added some Whip It so that it wouldn't get runny after sitting for awhile.  I tried dark chocolate powder, which made for a very ugly, yet tasty topping for my vanilla cupcakes.  My BF strongly dislikes sugary sweet frostings, but he LOVED this, he actually fought me to lick the bowl :) Definately a keeper!

this was awesome.  i didn't have a whip attachment for the food processor, but the regular puree attachment worked great.  it's not all light and airy, but the consistency is really nice and firm.  it tasted almost like chocolate mousse and not too sweet either.

I love the subtley sweet and more prominent cocoa flavor.  Made mine with a hand mixer, just takes a few minutes.  Went great with my already pretty sweet cupcakes.  Keep in mind, this frosting is best chilled.  Can sit at room temperature, but will soften quite a bit.  Thanks!

This whipped cream turned out great - I had many compliments.  I doubled the recipe and used it to make ice box cake (you can find the recipe on the side of the Nabisco Famous chocolate wafers box - if you are lucky enough to find them).  I have made the cake many times before with plain whipped cream, but chocolate made it even better!

So easy and delicious.  I don't use a food processor so I just made it with a hand mixer. Put it on "Chocolate Oil Cake" for my husband's bday--SO GOOD!

I used this recipe but substituted 3 tablespoons powdered sugar for the regular sugar and used double chocolate cookie crumbs for the cocoa powder ...  about 1/3rd of a cup of crumbs and it tastes delicious.I know it's simple, but it's a winner all around.  It even keeps in the refrigerator for 2 days without falling apart.

This was really great! We substituted powdered sugar for the coco powder to make a vanilla frosting. I was surprised at how easy it was to make with my stand mixer! We loved it and will definitely make this over and over again!

Made it exactly as written, but doubled. It's the perfect frosting for my chocolate raspberry cake. The family loved it. I especially loved how quick and easy it is to put together. I recommend that you chill the cake, along with the mixing bowl and beaters.

It makes wonderful light frosting for any cake and I use it as an easy to make mousse to put on pudding, fruit, or just by itself it is delicious! It's not too sweet or too heavy. The recipe ratio is perfect for a two layer 9" cake.

Doubled this recipe for a layer cake and used my KitchenAid with paddle blade.  Super quick, easy and delicious!  My new go-to light frosting.  It was a bit on the chocolately side for me so I added about a 1/4 c. of powdered sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  Next time I'll probably just leave out some cocoa.

Very simple and tasty.  I used mixer with whip attachments and it took only couple minutes of whipping.  It's not very rich, but was excellent on  vanilla cup cakes.

I used this as a filling for my son's birthday cake, it was light, not too sweet, and perfect with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting, also from this site. What a combo! It was the best cake I've ever had.

I don't like store-bought icings or icings that are too sweet.  I thought this icing was fantastic!  Nice cocoa flavor and subtly sweet.

Exactly what I was looking for in a chocolate whipped cream frosting. I used dutch process cocoa, and it ended up with great depth of flavor.

You need to add unflavored gelatin to the whipped cream, so it isn't runny. There's a recipe for stabilized whipped cream frosting on here, use that recipe and add some cocoa.

So, this frosting turned out well.....on my SECOND TRY.... this recipe should come with a warning to be very careful not to OVER whip...... as SOON as it starts getting a whip cream type texture you must quit messing with it and just use it. I apparently whipped it for too long and it went from a whipped cream type texture to this chunky stuff with liquid in the bottom that wouldn't mix up....basically.... i made butter. I had to throw it out and try again.... after being careful not to overwhip this second time, the frosting was fantastic...just what i needed. Light, not too rich, easy to spread, etc. Very tasty, just proceed with close attention!! Also, after spreading it on the cake it stayed put. I was worried it would kind of "melt" off the cake but i even left an extra piece sitting out and after about an hour and a half the frosting was still sitting on it just fine. I also have a piece i put in the fridge. I've determined it would have been fine to make the cake and frost it ahead of time and store in the fridge for at least a day before the party.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a frosting that isn't too sugary. I did it exactly as the recipe called for. I didn't switch to powdered sugar or anything. I didn't have a whip attachment for the food processor so I just used the regular attachment. The frosting turned out perfectly. It took maybe a minute to fluff up. The texture was nice and smooth. It was not overly sweet. It tasted very chocolaty and creamy. I used the frosting for a heart shaped cake I had made my boyfriend for valentines day. I think this would be a good pick for someone who likes dark chocolate more than milk chocolate.

Made this last night for something a little different on a coconut cream pie. It was delicious! I let my daughters each test a spoonful after i mixed it with my electric mixer. I could tell by their faces that it would become a regularly used recipe in our home. My husband loved the pie as did the kids.

Love this frosting! I'm the same way, I don't like really sweet frostings! Tonight, I made a really dense chocolate cake from scratch (none of that boxed stuff at our house!??) and I wanted a very light peanut butter frosting to go on it. (Just a craving, I guess haha) Then I found this recipe! I doubled it and added about a half a cup of peanut butter...other than that I followed the mixer directions to a t and it turned out beautifully! Light and fluffy; the perfect amount of sweetness. So yummy. The perfect topping to my cake! Thanks for sharing! I will use this recipe many many times in the future!

Delicious and easy, not too sweet. We aren't fans of too much sugar.

Iced my cake which was two 9" pieces that I layered together. Icing was enough to cover the whole cake and the middle layer. 

Great recipe will make again!

This was delicious and so easy to make. I made it with "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" off of this site also. I double the recipe and was able to frost between, top and sides of two 9" cakes.

Very light and not overly sweet. Perfect for our family! Just one comment, though! If you are frosting a 13x9 cake with this recipe, it just barely covers the top with a very thin layer. Either 1 1/2 times the recipe or double the recipe would have been much better.

I dont know why but I expected this to be a little bit more "frosting-like" than it turned out to be. It is really just chocolate whipped cream. Very tasty but not exactly what I had in mind.

So fast and super easy to make!  I added Whip It as I was nervous that the whip cream would start to lose it's consistency and it was perfect!  And the food processor made it so fast and easy.  I did a double batch for a layered cake.

It made enough to generously ice the middle of two layer cake. Double recipe to do whole cake - double layer. Used gelatin to stabilize.

I was looking for a chocolate whipped cream recipe, and this was perfect :)

I don't get why some reviewers said things like "I expected this to be frosting, this is just whipped cream!" and "OMG, why didn't this recipe remind u to not over-whip?" or "I got weird liquid in my whipped cream." Look at the ingredients! It's just cream, sugar, vanilla, and cocoa powder! If you know anything about frosting, you should know that frosting needs butter of some sort. In addition, anyone who makes whipped cream should know not to over-whip your cream! If it starts to turn grainy, add more cream and re-whip.
