This was a very good recipe! I did make a couple of changes, adding some shredded yellow squash with the zucchini and carrots to make 2 1/2 cups. I also used half whole wheat and half white flour, and instead of the loaves I made two dozen muffins, baking for 20 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Amazingly moist with a nice crumb, even though there's no added fat!

Sorry, but I actually threw these away. I think it could be adjusted because the flavor was okay. The texture was pretty horrible though. That may be due to the applesauce and could be fixed with adding oil. That, of course, would raise the calories and defeat the purpose.
