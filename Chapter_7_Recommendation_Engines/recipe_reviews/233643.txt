Used 8" tortillas for the tostadas and followed this recipe to the letter.  The only criticism that I have is that the beef filling was a little dry and needed a kick of heat (at least for our taste).  I put a bottle of hot sauce on the table, so that took care of the spiciness.  I used "medium" salsa, so using "hot" may have resolved the "heat" issue.  In the future, I'll add more salsa, probably a chopped jalape√±o to the filling or a healthy shake of hot sauce, and a poached egg instead of fried.  My hubby said he'd definitely like to have this again.  Thanks LEMarr for our nice breakfast today.
