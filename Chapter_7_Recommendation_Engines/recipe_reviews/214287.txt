These were good but a little dry even with the glaze on it.  I agree with the other reviewer who said you only need to make half the glaze recipe. That was plenty for all the cookies.

1/2 Of the whipped topping is enough i had a lot of extra when using the whole tub. Therefore use  half of the baking chocolate for the glaze also.  Use blue bonnet light for a lighter calorie option.
