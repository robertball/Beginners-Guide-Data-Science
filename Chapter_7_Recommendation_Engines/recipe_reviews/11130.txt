This receipe is the REAL THING. It asks for baker's ammonia and it tells you to let the shaped cookie stay outside for 24h. If you try this receipe for the first time, don't be discouraged by the strong an unusual smell of the ammonia. It makes the cookies puff up during the baking process. That's where its name comes from. Translated it means "little jumper". Ammonia is a must for those cookies, otherwise you will have Anise cookies. The smell will disapear over time and the strong flavor of anise will rise. Enjoy.

This is the same recipe that I received from my great grandmother some 50 years ago.  I've had problems finding the ammonium carbonate but my local drugstore was able to get some for me.  My favorite way of "softening" them up, is to dunk them in a good cup of hot tea when I am eating them.

Substitute 1 teaspoon baking powder plus 1 teaspoon baking soda for 1 teaspoon baking ammonia.

I thought Springerles would be only a childhood Christmas memory for me until I found this recipe - they taste EXACTLY as I knew them, and they are surprisingly easy to make! I found that the dough could be chilled for longer periods with consistent results for busy cooks. I used a cat cookie cutter as I do not have any molds; the cut cookies "rested" overnight on parchment paper for easy removal. Also, I used a spray mister to quickly wet the backs before placing on a greased and seeded sheet. My friends wholeheartedly shared in my enthusiasm by exclaiming how exceptional the "puffy cats" were, which caused the need for multiple double batches! Will get online to purchase down molds for next year. It was the highlight of my Christmas, thank you very very much!

These are perfect.  Easy to mold and bake.  I followed the recipe (got my bakers ammonia on Amazon) and used my new springerle cookie molds.  I have found the new resin ones are much easier to work with than the older wood or clay ones.  Only thing I did differently- do not brush the flour off of your cookies until after they bake.  Its too easy to lose detail in your design if you brush them before they bake and the flour on them won't cause any problems.   It brushes right off after the cookies cool.

This is similar to a recipe that has been passed down through my family.  We always poured a small amount of boiling water over the Anise seeds and let it bring out their essence while beating the eggs.

This is the recipe to use for traditional Springerle - no need to change a thing!   I got the recipe from a wonderful German Lutheran friend who made them for our bridge group, and for the church's Cookie Bazaar every Christmas.   These days she's spends Christmas with the angels, leaving it to me to make these cookies  in her memory!

 Store these in airtight containers for the very best flavor!   Great dunking cookies!

One technique suggestion -  After rolling a batch of dough out with a rolling pin, I trim it to the width of my Springerle mold (mine is the rolling pin kind)  and sprinkle the anise seed on my work surface (under the dough) so that it sticks to the bottom of the dough as I press the design into the cookies.   This eliminates the need to spray the cookies with water to get the seeds to stick at baking time!

Wonderful! Made these for Christmas. I have individual Springerle molds, not a rolling pin (and they're fairly big--about 4x3 ) so I only got 16 cookies.

These are delicious!  I've made them 2 times.  The second time I only had wheat flour and they turned out just as good (just a little more difficult to work with).

This is the closest I could find to what I remembered of my grandmother's recipe.  It's also my first time making cookies that didn't come out of a tube.  The dough was so sticky it was near impossible to work with.  I'm going to try again increasing the flour and sugar  to see if that helps.  I also might try chilling the dough in the refrigerator before trying to roll it out.  I'll check back in a couple of weeks :)

My first time to make springerle.  Couldn't wait to use my new rolling pin and mold set.  These taste just like I remember them from many years ago.  I did not change the recipe at all.  I got the baking ammonia from a baking supply store.  They are still good after being in a cookie tin for four weeks.  Thank you for the recipe Jenny.
