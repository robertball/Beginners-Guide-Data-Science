So, so good. I served it more as a soup. Just delicious and creamy with a rich flavor that keeps you wanting more. Don't change a thing! Thank you for the recipe.

I have to admit, I did not have much time, so I just substituted lentils for all the beans so I could avoid the soaking and the pressure cooker.  The end result was delicious!  Thanks for this recipe, will make it many times.  The butter adds such a richness to the flavour.

With all these spices, how could you go wrong with this recipe? This rich, hearty soup is delicious. The butter adds a smooth texture to the beans and tomatoes. Also, I love the excuse to use my pressure cooker.

I covered the legumes with ~2.5 inches of water for 8 hours.  Prior to transferring to the pressure cooker, I added about 1 cup to make 1.5 inches of water.  These came out with perfectly cooked legumes and with a thicker consistency.  One comment said this recipe was bland.  I hope they meant 'needed salt'; I had to add salt at the dinner table; and the flavor was just as I expected.  This was absolutely delicious!  My wife also loved it.

I love the flavors but wonder if I got the right consistency.  There wasn’t a quantity of water specified.  Mine came out like a soup, but “lentils” in the name had me expecting something thicker.  I will make again but with lass water in the pressure cooker.  Thanks—I love the spices combination!

My first thought was maybe I should cut back on the spices cuz it seemed so much, but I am certainly glad I did not!  Followed recipe & since I eat dairy free diet, used vegan butter & left out yogurt & this recipe is amazing!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could ... just that awesome!!

Delicious! I've made this twice now and plan to make it again. It's even better the following day! I didn't add any other beans, just the lentils.
