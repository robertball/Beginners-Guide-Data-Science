I prefer apple crisp without oats and I also liked that this wasn't overloaded with cinnamon.  However, as this recipe's first reviewer, I regret that after preparing this recipe I have to say it did not impress me.  Ultimately this was very good, but only after a whole lot of monkeying around with it.  As the submitter suggested, I made this in individual sized portions. First, I had to add more flour to the "crisp" to get it to crumble nicely. The proportions of butter/brown sugar/flour are off (too much brown sugar I think?)  and made it kind of pasty rather than crumbly. Second, there weren't nearly enough apples for all that topping so I had to increase that too - which now meant I had to play around with the initial sugar/cinnamon mixture as well.  I baked this in individual shallow ramekins, about 30 minutes at 350 degrees and while it ended up being delicious I'll move on to another recipe where the measurements of ingredients are more accurate and reliable.

Delicious, easy, no oats required!! **If you are storing left overs, do not cover it otherwise the topping gets soft.

Yay! No oats! Very tasty, very easy. I did increase the apples to about seven cups. Also added a tsp of vanilla to the topping, and a pinch of nutmeg, because I like it. For variety next time I will add dried cranberries. A great starting point if you don't want the oats. Just tweek it to make it your own!

Sadly this wasn't the crisp I was looking for. VERY sweet and stayed crisp for about five minutes then a soggy crust after that. Just not our taste I guess.

The recipe was dead on, exactly what I grew up with as a kid. It last about the same amount of time... Seconds. I would not change perfection.

Definitely more “apple mush” than “apple crisp”, but still tastes good.

It was good and tasty. But I was disappointed that the topping wasn’t of a crunchy texture. Maybe my fault in that respect.

Made according to the directions, this is sickeningly sweet goop, with the apples utterly drowned in sugar. It might be barely salvageable as an ice cream topping, but it is nearly inedible straight. A sad waste of good apples.

I loved the topping...I did not mix it, but blended the butter as I would for Dutch apple pie.  I would put more cinnamon in with the apples, next time.

Too sweet. I think they mixed up the ratio of flour to sugar.

I doubled it and fit  it into a 13X9 pan. I used 10 small/medium apples because I didn't want to do the work of pealing so I just used an apple slicer/corer to make it SUPER EASY and fast. 
I cooked it for 1 hour. It was crunchy and stayed crunchy the next day but I understand what others say about it being mushy. The kids and everyone still loved it.  I will for sure do it again because the family loved it and it was fast and easy.

Don't use more then the suggested amount of apples like I did. They created too much juice and I fell it eliminated some of the crunchy crisp. Plus the juice burned around the edges. Live and learn, but this is a definite keeper recipe.

I have made this many times now and it is not very crispy but I do have to say it is my husband's favorite dish for me to make besides cinnamon rolls. If I ask him what he wants he asks me to make the apple thing. Lol. I love it topped with vanilla ice cream.

I made this with my last bag of apples from last year's harvest  (frozen) and it came out wonderfully, though the recipe calls for way too much sugar for my taste. I cut a 1/2 cup out of the recipe and probably could have taken out a little bit more. Still, it was quick and yummy.

I have tried a no oats apple crisp recipe before and loved it but have had trouble finding that exact recipe again - this one seemed similar so I gave it a go. It tasted good and very sweet but did not crisp properly and was more of an apple mush.

I used just 1 cup of brown sugar and probably more apples.  I cut them pretty thick so they wouldn't get mushy and piled them into a 10 inch pie plate.  I baked it one hour so it got nice and crunchy.  Really good the next day too!  Best with ice cream!   Very easy. I blended the cold butter and the flour/br sugar mixture with my fingers because I didn't have any kitchen tools!

Tasted okay but the crumble part was not crumbley. Turnes out more like apple slop but mixed with ice cream or whipped cream, It was good.
