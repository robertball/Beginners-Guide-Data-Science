YUM!  This crust is amazing.  I couldn't find corn flour, so I used threw some corn meal in the blender to make it more fine, and used that.  The dough (as other reviewers have said) was extremely sticky, almost more like a batter than a dough at first.  I added 1/2 cup more each of all purpose and wheat flours, and then added more flour as necessary while kneading to make it smooth.  My husband just has sauce and cheese on his half, while I topped mine with sauce, thin sliced roma tomatoes, broccoli, and mozzarella cheese.  It was fantastico! :)

The dough was sticky and hard to work with but the final product was delicious.  It was my first success with pizza dough.

This is one of the best home made pizza crust recipes that I've ever made.  My husband just loved it, he just holds his breath when I make home made pizza because I can never seem to get a good crust.  This one was excellent.  A little spicy for my taste buds with the quantity of pepper in it so next time I'll half it.

The flavor and texture of this crust was really good but I found it very difficult to work with because it was really sticky. We made breadsticks for the kids (age 9 and 2) out of the dough and they liked it.

I,too, was compelled to add 1 cup more of flour while the mixture was in the bowl. I added small dustings of flour during the kneading process. As for flavor, this recipe is clearly a five star. I made a thin crust pizza and the crust was crunchy yet easy to bite. Because my sauce has all the herbs in this recipe, I did not add them. Instead, I added Spanish Cracked Anise. (Penzy's.com) After making the pizza crust, I had more than half the recipe remaining. Because of the quantity yeast, I let it rise in a breadpan and baked it as a loaf of bread.(30 min @ 350 degrees.) It turned out a beautiful loaf that is light to eat and very flavorful. Made great toast with butter. I intend to use it for Garlic bread, Bruchetta and croutons.

Great! I feel like a real pizza chef. Found myself wanting to throw it up into the air and spin. I'll eventually succeed because this will become my only pizza crust recipe I'll ever use.

I made this over the past weekend, and the only reason I'm giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because, to me at least, the rosemary tended to overpower the other flavors.  I will definitely make this again, only I will cut back on that particular spice.  Thanks.

I thought the tomato in the crust competed with the toppings and was acidic tasting. It was also sticky and hard to work with. I prefer a regular olive oil crust with a tablespoon or so of Italian seasoning.

Having read the other reviewer's comments, I resorted to using 1 heaping T. tomato paste instead of the more liquid tomato "sauce" listed; even then, the dough was quite wet. That is not the reason I rated this a three,  however. I used a preheated pizza stone and just was not impressed with the lack of airy-ness...crispiness in the final product. My SIL and DH both liked it, however, as it was. This is not going to be my "go to" recipe, but by reducing the liquid, it might be yours.

I love this recipe.  I usually add another 1/4 cup whole wheat flour so it's not too sticky to handle.

I didn't have all the different flours on hand, so I made it with 3.5 Cups of all-purpose flour and the result was a wonderful crust, not sticky at all.  I also added 1 teaspoon of onion and 2 teaspoons of garlic (can't get enough garlic, in spite of an allergy).  Finally I dusted my pizza pans with cornmeal just for effect.  Maybe it was the change in flour, but it needed 3 or so extra minutes baking.  Wonderful pizza crust, thanks for sharing!

Great,tasty crust!   It was quite sticky to work with, I wound up adding a cup of flour while mixing it, and then maybe another 1/4 while kneading to keep it from gluing itself to my fingers.  
Whatever you do, don't forget the tomato sauce- it will taste very, very floury (but very easy to work with!)
Next time I will try cutting the tomato sauce a bit and not adding extra flour and see what happens.

This one was great. We added another cup of flour. Couldn't find the corn flour either, so just used more of the others. The dough was super sticky even with the extra flour, but when all was said and done, we know we'll be using this one again.

One of my favourite dough recipes ever. It can be difficult to work with, but the taste is worth the effort. I use about half the rosemary.

Tried it today.  Very hard to work with and messy, but was very tastey.  Needs to cook about 1 or 2 minuets longer for the crust.  Didn't have wheat flour subsituted rye.

Very soft crust, okay taste. I had to add more flour as dough was over-sticky. I think I prefer more crusty, chewy, unflavored crusts. But this was interesting to try! :)

It was great once I added the extra flour that other reviews have mentioned. I made it for my parents and if you don't have a pizza stone you need to cook it at 375 for about 20 minutes

This is a followup to say the crust was the best I've ever made.  I stand by my decision to add 3 cups of extra flour.  It has excellent texture and flavor, and was easy to roll out.

The flavor was amazing! My husband and I both noticed that it is a filling slice of pizza with this crust.  I did have to add quite a bit of flour while kneading it as the dough was too sticky to work otherwise.  I substituted 3 TBS of Italian seasoning instead of the rosemary, oregano, and basil, because I did not have them separately. I also added garlic to the crust mix (we like garlic at our house!) I was skeptical of the tomato sauce at first, but it was delicious!

I can't truly review this because I used whole wheet flour and corn meal for the recipe.  I also had to keep adding more flour to it.  With all that though, it still turned out the best whole wheat crust that I've made so far.  It was really good.

I can only give this 2 stars because as written it simply is not dough.  It was way too wet.  It's got great ingredients and on paper it was a stand out from the rest. Due to how sticky it was, I threw it out and started over making modifications.  Modified, if interested, I used about 1 cup of water, 1/4 cup tomato sauce, 1/2 cup corn flour and 2 cloves roasted garlic, only 1/2 tsp italian seasoning blend b/c I was making it into mexican pizza....hardly the original recipe.  I rolled it thin and heated my stone to 500 instead of 450...we don't like crust too chewy.

This is the best homemade pizza crust that my husband and I have ever had.  I think the secret is the tomato sauce and herbs in the crust along with different kinds of flours.  Highly recommend as is.

Certainly one of the best doughs I have tried to make to date!  I skipped alot of the seasonings, though.  Also, I didn't find it that hard to work with as others have said.  Great dough!  Thanks!

Very good pizza crust, but needed a little tweaking. I added more wheat flour, used wheat germ instead of corn flour and reduced the pepper.  But the pizzas turned out great, the crust is flavorful but not overpowering. Also excellent when spread with pesto instead of a tomato-based sauce.

I'm in pizza coma right now.. Deeeeeelicious! The only change I did was to use Italian seasoning instead of the 3 herbs. Used flour as needed and 'm in pizza heaven. Ty! Ty! Ty!!

This crust is amazing! I cut the amount of tomato sauce in half to make it less sticky, followed some previous reviewers on using Italian seasoning, but I still added the basil and oregano, and I used all whole wheat flour (3 1/4 cup)...and I let it rise all day under a damp towel...my family loooved this recipe! We will definitely be making it a permanent fixture!

Yummy! I had to add quite a bit more flour, and the dough was real sticky but it turned out delicious! Also, I increased the bake time to 20 minutes to get the desired doneness.

This was an extremely simple recipe, and very tasty. My DH and I have very different diets, so I made 6 small pizza rounds that we could top per our tastes/dietary restrictions. The 3 that weren't used are waiting for the next pizza night in the freezer(pre-baked, of course!)

Super fantastisco!  I read all the reviews and then made my dough in the bread machine.  (Cheater, I know.)  I did add extra flour as needed and then let rise.  Bake as normal.  Can't say enough about what a great crust this is.  The search is over for a great pizza crust!

the taste of this crust was pretty good....but when I put it in the bowl to let it rise it didn't rise enough because the dough is too wet and sticky and then the directions said to put the raw crust and put the sauce and toppings on it and cook it...i have never heard of that before and cooking it that way was a flop!!

Thia was an alright recipe, but it didn't have hardly enough flour to go in it, so I added about 1 and MAYBE a half cups through the kneeding prosess, but it was still really gooy.

It's ok, I guess, but I certainly wouldn't call it "fantastico."  I think I prefer the normal dough.

This is the perfect pizza crust texture, and placing the dough on a preheated pan really makes a difference! But perhaps I am a purist when it comes to pizza crust - the tomato sauce and spices were a little overpowering for me. I tried this recipe again, omitting the tomato sauce and all spices except oregano, and made it into one cookie sheet size pizza, and it was absolutely the best deep dish crust! Definately 5 star with the adjustments.

This crust turned out just right.  I didn't hav any problems with it being sticky, but I do dust my hands with flour before working with it.  The flavor is great and the texture was perfect.

Easy to make, even for a guy who doesn't know how to cook... sticky though. Made it as a BBQ chicken pizza and the guys and I demo'd it fast...
