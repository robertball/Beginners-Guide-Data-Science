I needed to try this recipe before serving it to 28 guests this Thanksgiving. 1st, I made this recipe exactly as specified. I did see the words.. "simmer until cranberries pop" and decided to use "frying screen" over the pot. Thank goodness! LOL The recipe is marvelous as it is. Then I made it a 2nd time, using 1 bag cranberries, 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup of white sugar, 2/3 cup OJ and 1/4 cup of water. I couldn't justify boiling down Gran Manier, so I added 2 Tablespoons AFTER the berry mixture was done heating.  LUCIOUS!!!!  Remember to use a spatter screen and let the sauce set for at least 4 hours. Perfect consistancy and texture as well as flavors. YUM!

This was wonderful sauce.  I made it especially for my Dad as he loves cranberry sauce with his turkey.  Both him and my grandmother raved at how awesome it was. I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: I used half white & half brown sugar, half water & half orange juice.  I also put just a touch (probably less than 1/8 tsp) of cinnamon.  Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipe - it made a wonderful addition to my family's Thanksgiving dinner!

I just made this minutes ago and it is wonderful! I did do some changes as suggested by previous reviews. I did 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup water. I also let it simmer longer than 10 minutes..about 20 and mashed the cranberries. It is the perfect constancy. Can't wait to serve this tommorrow.

I could not stand cranberry sauce before this.  All I had ever tasted was the kind straight out of the can.  But, my family loves to have it for their turkey, and I can't deny them that.  However, I figured I could make it from scratch and see if they liked that even better.  Boy, did they.  My hubby and 11 yr. old nephew were eating it by the spoonfuls!  I decided to give it a little taste since everyone was going on so much about it.  OMG!!!  It was awesome!  I couldn't believe the difference in having fresh cranberry sauce.  I will definitely have a little something at every holiday now to dress up my sliced turkey!  And I will never disgrace my family with the canned stuff again.  I took a few suggestions and used half white sugar, half brown, and added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon.  AMAZING!!!

This reminds me of my grandmother's sauce. I also did half white, half brown sugar and added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp of grated orange zest. It is easy to make and delicious.

I don't eat cranberries, but everyone in my family thinks this is fantastic.  They can't believe how easy it is to make!  I hollowed out a large orange to serve it in, and used cinnamon sticks for garnish, which made a great presentation and enhanced the flavor.

The sugar and the orange juice offset the tartness of the cranberries to provide a nice blend of flavors.  I altered this recipe just a little by bringing the entire cranberry mixture to a boil, and then letting it gently boil for about 10-12 minutes.  Then I turned the stove off and just let it sit on the hot burner for awhile.  The consistency turned out perfect...not too runny.  We all loved this recipe!

OUTSTANDING!  I used a hand mixer to puree the completed sauce before cooling.  Even those who don't like other cranberry sauce loved this.  Even easier than opening the canned stuff, and a billion times better!

OOOOH do I love cranberry sauce.  This is a very tasty version of my love.  I am pretty much the only one who eats it in my immediate family, but I can't wait to share at Moms for Thanksgiving!  Thanks Toni!!

While we were eating this with our southwest seasoned turkey dinner (Southwestern Cinnamon Steak Rub from this site)my husband commented that this would also taste great as a Cranberry Crumble, so I tried it and it turned out great. I used 3 cups flour, 2 cups quick oats, 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 cups soft butter. Mix together to form crumble and spread 1/2 of it into a lightly greased 13" by 9" pan. Pat it gently down and spread cranberry sauce over evenly and sprinkle the remaining crumble on top patting down gently when done. Bake at 350 degrees for aprox. 45 minutes. Makes great squares for any occasion!

Easy and excellent. Make sure you give them enough time to all pop open, to fully foam, and then simmer for a while. Don't be too quick, or consistency will suffer. It also helps to make them well in advance. They will thicken up considerably upon cooling/refrigeration. These are excellent and VERY easy.

Absolutely no one of the 16 people I prepared dinner for likes whole cranberry sauce!  However, EVERYONE tried it and EVERYONE liked it!  Grandson asked to take leftovers home.  I never realized how easy it is to make it and have already been told to make it again.   Thanks a million.  Just wish I wasn't 66 yrs old before finding this recipe.

I'm a huge cranberry sauce fan and this is excellent. I used half orange juice and half water (since my orange juice came straight from an orange). Used 1/2 white sugar and half brown. I didnt read the directions and dumped everyhing in the pot and started to cook it. I let it cook about 30 so i could thicken and all the cranberries could pop.

I have tried this recipe two different ways, the original as written, and my way...which is half orange juice and half water.  I find the orange flavor a bit overwhelming to the tart cranberries when you follow the recipe as written, however it is still very good!  I adjusted mine by simply doing half orange juice and half water.  This chilled overnight and was perfect for the next day.  And here is just a hint that I learned...I have picky eaters who don't necessarily like biting into whole cranberries, so I use a potato masher on about half of the mixture to break up the cranberries and smooth it out.  This seems to really help pacify the kids and adults who would prefer the cranberry sauce out of the can with the lines! :)  Great recipe as is, but I think better with my revisions ;)  Thanks!

WOW!!!!!! Yummy! I love cranberry sauce, but never made it myself. This recipe is not only delicious, but easy! I added walnuts that I crushed in my hand (to make small pieces). I ate the whole thing all by myself within 24 hours of making it. Thank you for sharing!

This is a tasty sauce, and how much easier can it get? I think orange goes great with cranberry. I added the zest of an orange along with the juice. Mine wasn't a stiff sauce like canned cranberry sauce is, but it didn't run all over your plate when you dished it up either. I made two batches of this sauce, one I boiled only until the berries stopped popping, it tasted bright and fresh and orangey. The second batch I boiled five minutes past the berries all popping, the flavor of that batch was much less fresh.

I tried a practice run with Frozen Cranberries and it was runny and the cranberries didnt burst.  Last night I used fresh cranberries and it was PERFECT.  I followed the suggestion of 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, 3/4 cup OJ and 1/4 cup Water.  I added the cranberries after the sugars had dissolved on the stove; added a pinch of cinnamin and some orange zest.  I brought it to a boil reduced heat to low and stirred it often until the cranberries had burst (about 12 min).  I turned off the heat and let it set on the hot burner for 45 min.  I put it in the fridge and this morning it was still the perfect consistancy.  Cant wait for Thanksgiving!!

I have always hated canned cranberry sauce so I really wanted to try fresh.  I'm so glad that I did!  I made the recipe just as it is except when it was done I blended the whole thing to make it smooth.  It's so yummy!  Mine didn't seem to tighten up as much as I would have liked but that's okay.  Also, as a heads up, if you put a lid on your pot while making to prevent splatter, keep an eye on it!  I didn't and it overflowed.

This was my first time ever making cranberry sauce and it came out absolutely delicious! I did cook them a little longer too (about 10 minutes or so) and I also mashed the cranberries a little bit as I was mixing them and they came out perfect! I personally never really liked cranberry sauce before, but this I couldn't get enough of!!

Have made several times and just never got around to rating.  Have made recipe as listed and adjusted to 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water.  My family likes the 1/2 and 1/2 best.  I simmer with a cinnamon stick and a little orange zest.

I have made this two years in a row for Thanksgiving.  It is the best recipe. I now double it so we have leftovers.    The actual cook time is closer to 20 minutes.  I make it a day ahead so it jells better together in the refrigerator overnight.

Awesome Recipe! I too used 1/2 regular sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I also threw in a handful of dried cranberries about 5 minutes after putting the fresh cranberries in. DELISH! :)

This was good, not the best cranberry sauce I've tried, but surely the best I've made.  Very tart, with a subtle orange flavor.  The only tip I have is allow more cooking time.  My sauce was still too runny at 10-minutes (the cooking time the recipe states).  I actually let it simmer for almost 30-minutes.  Like most sauces, the longer it simmers, the thicker it gets.  This recipe is a keeper.

Really an exceptional recipe.  Despite the ease of preparation, the taste is pretty complex.  It is hard to believe it is made with only three ingredients.  I'm thinking of making it in large batches and giving it as gifts this Christmas.

I decided I'd better try making real cranberry sauce at least once.  This recipe is so good.  I followed some of the other suggestions and used half white and half brown sugar.  Also, I did 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup orange juice.  I decided to use a potato masher and got rid of most of the chunks.  This cranberry sauce tastes wonderful and will be a staple at holidays from now on!

Very good - my only suggestion would be to add a bit of grated orange peel, and to use fresh OJ. I followed other reviewers and placed this in half a hollowed out orange for presentation. Place autumn colored leaves on a plate, place the orange over that. Save a few cranberries to place on the plate too. Looks so pretty!

Excellent cranberry sauce. Certainly worth the minimal effort required to get over that tinned jelly-like substance.

Oh my yumminess!  I will NEVER buy canned, packaged or prepared cranberry sauce again.  This was fantastic.  I had no idea making cranberry sauce was this easy.  The orange juice is the perfect compliment to the cranberries.  (I've noticed many recipes calling for orange zest rather than orange juice.)  Excellent.

This was such an easy recipe. I couldn't believe we've been eatin cranberry sauce out of a can this long when its this easy to make it fresh and delicious. I substituted half the sugar for brown sugar as suggested and could tell the difference it made. Came out delicious, will definitely become a staple for us on turkey day! Thank you! 
fyi: I was worried when I removed from the stove top as it was still runny, but it sets very quickly after pouring into a bowl.

Good basic recipe.  I used apple cider instead of orange juice and added some peeled, chopped apple.

Definitely a keeper! I still can't believe how SUPER EASY (and QUICK) this is to make. I usually make this about 3 days in advance and it's perfect the day of our holiday dinner.

This stuff stinks when cooking but tastes great! Don't worry about the smell as it cooks! It kind of smells like rotten fruit cooking in OJ. It is a real funky smell but like I said it tastes super sweet and delicious! I used 1 bag of Oceanspray cranberries, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 cup OJ. I think a full cup of OJ would have been too strong tasting on the orange side. 1/2 cup was the perfect blend of sweet and tart! I also let it cook for 20 minutes. Any less and the cranberries were not even popped all the way through. The sauce gets thicker the longer it simmers on the stove. It turns a deeper color red too the longer you cook it! Mahalo for the perfect Thanksgiving recipe!

I loved this recipe with the following alterations: 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup of FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE, 1/2 cup of water.  The correct simmer time is closer to 30 minutes.  Thanks for getting me started and for sharing this with me!

Yum!  Use half splenda and half sugar.  Came out great.  Wish I would have doubled the batch.  Used the left overs one whole wheat pancakes with whip cream!  My husband and kids could not stop eating it.  Worth making and using in recipes such as cheesecake. Thanks.  Simple is always good.

No one in our family was a cranberry fan until my sister in law made this recipe.  It's delish!  She adds a bit of orange zest and cinnamon after it's done too.  I needed to make it in a hurry so I used the suggestion to use a potato masher. Next time will make it a day in advance to allow time for it to cool.  Kids LOVE it!

This recipe is awesome!! SUPER simple, and this is coming from someone who never previously attempted making cranberry sauce nor ever even watched it being done. So I had no idea what it was like and it still came out fabulously. It's so good I will make it year round!  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. The addition of the brown sugar gives it a yummy taste. I also put it in the blender for a smoother texture.  It's not too sweet, not too tart. Just perfectly in the middle.

I just finished making this version and love it!  Even warm! -- -- Little variation .  .  .  I used 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar with a very light sprinkle of cinnamon as others recommended.  -- -- I used the stick blender to break the berries up a bit (because I don't think my family will like it too chunky).  --   I was surprised to see it setting so quickly as it cooled.  The key to it setting up properly is not to overcook it. --  Watch out the berries POP as they're cooking and splatter a bit.  Wipe it up so it doesn't stain.

I read the massive reviews and agree with one reviewer...try the provided recipe first before making any adjustments. I added 1/8 tsp cinnamon this time around (as some reviewers had suggested) and actually prefer it without. The recipe as it stands is excellent and deserves 5 stars. So if it is your first time making it, I agree with others that try the original recipe first! My sauce was all gobbled up and everybody raved!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  I have never made cranberry sauce before, and this was so easy, and the best ever.  The only difference I did was to let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  I would not change a single thing about this.  Thanks so much!!

I used Stevia instead of sugar, and made my own orange juice with a florida navel orange or two in the blender.. this was fantastic cranberry sauce. Truly decadent.

Easy, Quick, Affordable and Tasty! I pulsed the ingredients in my blender twice for a chutney/sauce consistency. I prepared ingredients as directed but when I did a taste test I thought I might have to tweak it a bit but after letting the sauce sit in the fridge to cool for several hours I tasted it again and it was perfect!  Thank you for sharing your recipe :-)

I would add a little orange zest to this recipe, brown sugar and 1 qt. cranberry juice so as not to use so much sugar, plus a cinnamon stick and sliced ginger. Cook over medium heat until cranberries are well cooked and a little musky; you can adjust the sugar with stevia also.

Any recipe that can get me to eat something I previously despised deserves 10 stars! I followed the suggestions to use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Also 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water. And I added a touch of cinnamon. Fabulous!

Nice, easy recipe.  I add the juice of two oranges and the zest as well.  Two cinnamon stickes, a wee pinch of allspice and nutmeg.  Added a wee bit of water to make up for some of the juice and cooked them about 20 minutes.  GREAT reicpe!

This recipe changed my mind about cranberry sauce forever.  I now insist upon making it for all appropriate gatherings, because I know if I make this cranberry sauce it will be good and not a gelatinous blob in the shape of a can that gets sliced into unsavory looking red disks. Thank you for opening my eyes to the glory of cranberries!!  On a side note.  I love that it pops.  Adds to the fun of making it.

I have ever made my own cranberry sauce before because everyone likes the canned jellied stuff.  This was a big hit! It was so easy too!  As recommended by others, I did half water, half orange juice, half white sugar & half brown sugar.  I let it sit on the counter for about an hour and cooled in the fridge.  It did thicken nicely.  Super delicious!

In my family, cranberry sauce is the last thing anyone wants from the Thanskgiving table.  I love cranberries & vowed to make everyone else love them, too.  This recipe is my base but I add one teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice while the berries are cooking.  As it cools, I add 1/2 cup Grand Marnier and mix it in thoroughly.  Don't wait until it cools completely or it'll be too strong for kids.  But you also don't want to add it while it's hot or it'll just vaporize.  Tinker with the amount & timing according to the guests at your table.  You'll make cranberry sauce fans out of everyone, too!

I doubled this recipe to make PLENTY, and I did one package of cranberries, one package of strawberries instead of 2 packages cranberries. I also threw in a jalapeno. Everyone is going crazy over it!

This is a wonderful basic version of cranberry sauce.  Another option is to use Cran-Raspberry juice instead of the oj.  Squeeze some fresh orange into it.  And a splash of Blackberry brandy never hurts.  Enjoy.

Ilove this easy, yummy recipe! I have made this recipe for the last couple of years for the holidays and it is so much better than store bought cranberry sauce. You do need to give it plenty of time to set though and it will still be a little syrupy but its fantastic! I make it exactly as the directons say too and wouldn't change a thing. I never liked cranberry sauce until tasting this version.

I followed the recipe exactly and my sauce came out a little runny.  I think I'll try some of the other reviewer suggestions and boil it longer and add some brown sugar and cinnamon next time.

Having never touched cranberry sauce because I grew up with a family who plopped it out of a tin, I almost wasn't going to make any for my first time cooking for my fiance's family.  But, I knew I had to and when I found this recipe and saw how easy it was, gave it a try.  So glad I did!  I found out I love cranberry sauce!  It got rave reviews from all and it was the easiest thing I made!  I used 3/4 cup OJ and 1/4 cup water (will do half and half next time because it was just a tad too tart still) and added a splash of brown sugar as well, and let it cook for 30 mins to thicken and pop all the cranberries.  I never have to look at the plop from a tin again!

This will be my seventh year making this super simple cranberry sauce. I've made it every single year as is and it's been one of the only things to totally disappear from the Thanksgiving table. The length of time to prepare and the steps involved, as well as the ingredients, couldn't be any simpler! My only advice would be to use a screen over top of the pan - otherwise you'll have a little bit of a mess to clean up around the stove after. Don't ever buy the canned stuff again!

I've been using this recipes for years, and it is sooo much better than the canned stuff as is, but if you add some chopped pecans or walnuts (1/4-1/2 cup depending on your taste) it is awesome!

This is how I prepare my cranberry sauce with one exception - I add about a 1/2 tsp. (more or less) of cinnamon. The little addition of spice is very nice! I sometimes reduce the sugar depending on what else I'm serving but, normally, this is it!

This is really great cranberry sauce.  The first time I made it, it had way too much orange juice flavor so I scaled it down to 1/4 cup oranage juice and 3/4 cup water.  Much better!

I made this for our Thanksgiving meal and my family *loved* it.

Just an FYI, I happened to make the recipe as written because that was my choice, and not because the recipe review gestapo said to... to those of you have made changes and they worked, my hat is off... and for you of us who didn't because you didn't have time to think of something else or felt it was *really important* to do it exactly as directed, I hope all turned out as well for you as it did for me.

ok, so this recipe is superb only after following the many tips in the review section- and here's another one- use the amount of white sugar in the recipe plus some sprinkles of brown sugar to taste(it is still way too bitter if you don't but this is a preference), 1/2 o.j. &1/2 water and add a generous amount of pineapple juice to further sweeten the tartness...some cinnamon afterwards finishes this off perfectly!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  My mother makes a cranberry sauce that is much sweeter than this one.  She uses 3 cups of sugar and 1/4 cup water with her 12 oz. cranberries!!!  This is just perfect with the one cup of sugar and the OJ.  Very tasty.  Not too sweet!  I just cooked mine longer than 10 minutes because not all of the berries had burst yet.  They are sooo tart when whole.  Very tasty and very easy to make!

This was great and so easy!  I followed suggestions and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, threw in some cinnamon and also added one small can of mandarin oranges, drained.  I also mashed up the sauce so that there were less whole cranberries.  Thanks!

I found this recipe here a few years ago and having been adding it to our holiday meals since then.  My family loves it.  I do chop the cranberries in a food processor before cooking them.  I also add some chopped pecans (about one cup) to give it a little different texture.  This has got to be the easiest cranberry sauce ever.

This is excellent. I like my cranberry sauce a little thicker so I skim off some of the liquid,and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. I'm asked for this again and again.

Five stars for ease and flavor. I use fresh squeezed orange juice and some zest from the rind.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner (the first one since moving to England) and rather liked it. It didn't get the ooh-ings and aah-ings I had expected based on other reviews, but it was good. I made it with fresh-squeezed oj because I had run out of store-bought, used half brown sugar and half white, and added some cinnamon. It looked gorgeous in a cut-glass bowl-the color is beautiful.  Next time I would cook it a bit longer until all of the berries pop, or mash it with a potato masher. I might try the suggestion of adding a splash of Grand Marnier next time too. The flavor went VERY well with the turkey.

This was so easy and so tasty.  I changed it just a bit.....1/2 C water 1/2 C orange juice, 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar...also added cinnamon, clove, allspice, chopped small crisp Granny Smith apple, and topped with chopped pecans. My husband hates cranberry sauce but he ejoyed this ...alot.  This will be our new holiday cranberry dish.

Delicious!!!  I've never had cranberry sauce, this was my first time making and tasting any type of cranberry sauce.  It was wonderful!  I sliced a block of cream cheese in halve and put some cranberry sauce over one of the halves on a plate with some crackers.  It disappeared. This one is a keeper, Thanks!

I made this several times during the holidays last year.  It was a huge hit.  My family has asked me to make Thanksgiving dinner throughout the year just for this sauce.  It will be a tradition for now on.  Thank you!
**Made again this year and took a few of the suggestions and added one.  1/2 c of brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 3-4 tbls orange zest.  I also used orange mango juice.  My husband picked up the wrong juice at the store.  All the changes and it was still fantastic!

Very good sauce.  I liked the flavor, but just a bit too tart. Maybe next time, I'll add a dab more sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice since I found the recipe. First time I didn't cook the cranberries long enough and it was kinda chunky.  The second time I cooked the sauce for a full 10 minutes and it came out perfect!

Great sauce!  I love the orange juice flavor.  It looks beautiful too, very professional looking.  And to top it off, it was almost easier than opening a can of store-bought cranberry sauce!  I made it the day before Thanksgiving and it got nice and thick in the fridge.

So so so easy to make and so delicious!  Got RAVES at early thanksgiving day dinner!  I used no pulp juice and added just a little more sugar than what is called for.  The cooks at the dinner table all wanted to know what the difference was between their regular recipe (water based) and mine...just the juice makes all the difference!

I've never made my own cranberry sauce before. I've always used the canned stuff. I thought I would give this a try since I like to know exactly what I'm eating (I don't trust labels!!). This recipe was perfect - exactly what I expected. Perfect combination between sweet and tart. And SOOOO easy to make!!! This will be my 'forever recipe' for cranberry sauce!

Umm, I feel kind of guilty.  Do you know why I feel kind of guilty?  Because I ate this with a SPOON and the turkey was long gone!  This was delicious!  I did tweak it slightly by using 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup orange juice - I was afraid it might be too tart otherwise, but it was heavenly. It smelled so good as it cooked!  I also sprinkled in a dash of cinnamon, and I let it chill/thicken in the fridge for 2 days.  The others are right... I'll never buy the canned stuff again.  This was so easy and fun!

DO NOT ADD THE SUGAR FIRST.  Wait for the cranberries to 'pop' first .... then add the sugar.  The sugar will make the skins too tough if you add it first.  Boil the berries in the juice and make sure the skins are open then add the sugar.

I add a little cinnamon, clove, ginger and a dash of nutmeg to mine as well.

This is a great base recipe.  My family has made this for years. We always add some of the orange pulp, also drop 4 whole cloves in for the cooking and remove when done.  Also add about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  We always double this recipe too.  A single batch just isn't enough.

LOVED these cranberries.  I am usually not a lover of cranberry sauce as it is typically served from a can in our families but I decided to make them fresh and they were wonderful! I did add the Gran Marnier like another review said to and it pushed it from a 4 to a 5 star receipe. Thanks for posting!

Very good!  I prefer to use 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of sugar the recipe suggests.  It's so easy and cheap to make you will never use the canned stuff again!!

I thought making cranberry sauce would be difficult. This was so easy and delicious! I added 2 cinnamon sticks while it was cooking, and did 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but definatley a keeper recipe!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was way to tart for my taste and the orange juice over powered it. Will try a different recipe next time....

I will never purchase cranberry sauce again!  I squeezed fresh oranges for the juice and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  We used the small amount of leftover cranberry sauce as a spread on homemade yeast rolls.  It was delicious!

I made this with a half cup of orange marmelade instead of the sugar.  Could add more for added sweetness, I like it tart.  So easy and good. Compliments the orange juice.

Good simple recipe, my family loved it. I continued to cook it for a few minutes after all of the berries popped and a good portion of the liquid evaporated in the pan. Then I  cooled it in the fridge for an hour to let it set. When it was time to serve, I pulled it out and gave it a god stir for a more fluid consistency (it became jelly as it sat in the the fridge) .

this was probably my favorite thing that i made for thanksgiving this year! it was amazing, so easy to make and so much better than the canned cranberry.  i mixed 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. following the reviews that i read. and i let it cool in the fridge before serving.

I love it  cranberry sauce is ready to go. I made a small change. My family is too used to the can version that I put it in the food processor to make it in to a pure then cook it to fudge temp and molded it looks and taste superb. oh I also used fresh squeezed orange/tangerine juice.

Used this recipe for the first time today, even had my granddaughter make it for me. We tasted it after it cooled a bit and everyone liked it. Ive never made cranberry sauce with orange juice, and we even put a bit of orange zest in as it was cooking. Came out really good.

Make this recipe every year.  I do half and half water & orange juice.  I also zest an orange and add a few cloves to give it a little holiday flavor.

Excellent recipe!  Delicious and so easy to make. I squeezed the juice from one orange and added water to make one cup of liquid. I zested the orange and added after the sauce was removed from heat. (I recommend using an organic orange if you are going to use the zest.)

Switched 1/2 brown sugar for the white sugar.  It makes a nice, basic cranberry sauce.

Cranberries have never tasted so good. Like some of the reviews said, I did half white and half brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon. My daughter couldn't get enough of them.She's going to a TG party next week and is bringing cranberries! Five+ in my book!

We made this again this year, and it helps to reduce the sugar and cut a little of the OJ with water. 
My boys love stirring the cranberries and watching them POP! It's a boy thing.
*This is definitely a FUN WAY for Moms and their sons to spend time together in the kitchen!!!!

I do not like cranberries, but decided to treat those who do by making them fresh instead of buying the canned ones.  Well, this cranberry sauce was a hit!  I even ate it with my turkey because it was so good! The only thing I have to say is that it takes a little while for the cranberries to pop, so don't worry that you are doing something wrong when you are stirring and stirring and nothing seems to be happening - it will. I did also add more sugar, but that was because I thought the sauce seemed thin while I was cooking it. This sauce is even better the next day.  I will use this recipe each year from now on as everyone loved it!

My college age son is in love with the jellied can stuff, so I tryed this after he headed back to school.WOW! An explosion of flavor!!  My husband gives it a 10 ( I told him 5 is tops).
As usual, I read reviews before making and did afew adjustments.  I used fresh squeezed Valencia Oranges and no water.  both White and Brown sugar 2/3's white to 1/3 Brown.  Added the zest from the oranges and a cinnamon stick while cooking.  Mashing the berries alittle after popping to make sure they were good and soft.  EXTREMELY WONDERFUL recipe!
Will make again and again,,,,maybe even when our son is home from college next time!

I made this following the recipe and it was a bit tart for my liking. I think next time I'll try adding 1/2 c orange juice 1/2 cup water 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as some others have suggested. It is really good though even with a bit of tartness. I also used a potato masher to break up the cranberries. Hopefully it's a hit tomorrow!

Sounds good...but this is BETTER... and far easier

2 bags fresh cranberries
1-1/2 - 2 cups sugar
1/4 cup brandy
 
Rinse cranberries, spread in single layer in a large jelly roll pan and sprinkle with completely with sugar.  Seal pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 20 - 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Unseal carefully and pour cranberries into a glass bowl and mix thoroughly with brandy.  Cover and refrigerate.

I made this cranberry sauce, but I use 1 cup of Splenda after the berries pop.  It's delicious and save you the 1 cup of sugar calories.

Unbelievably easy and delicious just as written, even for a novice.  I later modified it to add mandarin orange segments and used the juice as part of my liquid.  It was also excellent as modified.

I made this for thanksgiving a couple of years ago, now it's requested every year. When I tell people how easy it is to make they are shocked. I have never liked cranberry sauce until I made this one, now I love it! Try this recipe you won't be sorry.

This is the best!  My daughter made this for Thanksgiving 3 years ago.  It became a "must have" every year.  She added walnuts which made it fantastic.  This year I saw the recipe and couldn't believe how simple it was to make.  It compliments many meals and we don't have to wait for Thanksgiving any more.  She always told me it was easy.  Many thanks for sharing!

This is perfect as is with adding only about 1/2 tsp of orange zest. Other than that it's great. I do like to play around with it to make it my own. Try using pineapple juice instead of orange juice. Yum. But the recipe as written is wonderful.

This is a bit tart for my taste, although I did like it better after it chilled in the fridge. It tasted much sweeter when it was cold for some reason. I'll finish off the batch, but I probably won't make cranberry sauce again.

This is an awesome recipe as is. Raves from the first bite. I recently put a new twist on it, to my families delight. Instead of the Orange juice, I used Pomegranate-Mango juice and used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/4-1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg. Cooking according to directions. Mm-Mm. Or as my 5 year old Grandson says "Yummy in my Tummy". Just the right balance of sweet-tart.

The recipe "as-is" makes a wonderful traditional cranberry sauce as I have made it this way before.  But this year I decided to try something different and went with the suggestions of many reviewers.  I used half a cup of orange juice and half a cup of water, half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar and two dashes of cinnamon.  Excellent!  The cranberry sauce was a huge hit and was gone in no time!  I would suggest at least trying this recipe first as is, but if you are looking for something a little different after trying the recipe, definitely make the suggested changes or any of your own to put a twist on it.

I make this every year and my family loves it. The only change I usually make is to add orange zest. I may try doing half brown sugar at xmas and maybe nuts too! Great basic recipe.

This is my first time making cranberry sauce, in fact, my first time making a thanksgiving dinner... although I like the end result of this, I had to cut the sugar in half, as it was way too sweet for my taste, otherwise, it was great.

I doubled the recipe and simmered it for about 20 minutes and then pureed it with a food blender.  I also threw in a few cinnamon sticks while simmering.  This is much better than the canned stuff.  Can't wait to see what the guests think of it!

Great!  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  YUM.  Followed what others did with water, brown sugar and cinnamon.

I just made this recipe & it was really good! I used only orange juice instead of water, added some orange zest & a sprinking of cinnamon, and I used about 1/2 a cup of both white & brown sugar... I cooked it on medium, but I helped out the popping of the cranberries by smashing them with my spatula. (I didn't want any of them whole) There was no spattering at all, so I'm not sure what others were talking about with using a screen. (maybe because I was "helping" them out?) Anyway, it thickened up nicely since I cooked it until the thickness I wanted it. I sampled it- delicious! So the 4 stars was just because I changed it a bit. My sauce is actually a 5!

I am a young woman and this year was the first year that I cooked thanksgiving dinner on my own. It was really important to me that I do as much of the meal "from scratch" as possible. I had a guest list of about 10 people and all eyes were on me. I am happy to say that the meal turned out FABULOUSLY.. and this cranberry sauce was no exception. Everyone was *amazed* that I made it from scratch. Of course, I didnt tell just just how easy it was. This is *the* perfect cranberry sauce recipe.. very few ingredients, super simple to do, quick to cook, and so *so* tasty. I will definitely be using this one again and again! Thanks!!

I thought this was really good.  I needed to make a double batch and so one batch I used 1 cup of orange juice and the next I used 1 orange juice and half water.  I liked the all orange juice one better.  I did not find the orange flavor over powering at all.  I thought it was subtle yet pleasant.

I always hated the look and taste the can shape of cranberry sauce, so when I finally hosted Thanksgiving dinner I decided to make it fresh. While I still do not love the taste, I found it to be much more pleasant and received rave reviews from the fam.  I would recommend putting a paper towel over the top of the pot to prevent cranberry splatter. I had it everywhere!

It was very easy although a little tart. I mashed the berries after it had cooked and this helped.  Be sure to make this a few days in advance to give it some time to set up or it is too soupy.

This recipe was so simple, I was skeptical.  But wow, it was great!  What a hit at Thanksgiving!  This will be a permanent addition to our menu.  Make it exactly as the recipe calls for, you'll love it.

Exactly right.  This is what cranberry sauce should be.  Nice texture (saucy but still chunky) and nice taste (neither too sweet nor too tart). So easy.  I initially thought it was too orangey but it mellowed as it set.  I altered the recipe slightly (but probably not significantly): simmered for at least 15 minutes (not 10), and substituted two tablespoons of Grand Marnier (orange liquor) and two tablespoons of water for four of the tablespoons of orange juice.

I have never liked canned cranberry sauce or jello salad but it was my job this Thanksgiving to bring the cranberry salad so I brought this one.  It was wonderful and so easy to make.  My 2 yr old loved it!  I will never serve anything but this homemade sauce from now on.  I did follow one other reviews suggestions of 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 oj and 1/2 water.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Toni.

so easy. 1st time making my own cranberry sauce. so easy, that there really is NO excuse for buying canned ever egain. I also, at the advice of other reviews substituted the 1 cup of OJ for 1/2 C. of OJ and 1/2 Cup of Water. Another variation that i did was to add a small can of crushed pineapple...delish!

Fantastic and simple!!! I let it simmer a little longer and I mashed up the cranberries after they started popping and it thickened right up when I put it in the fridge for about 6 hours. Love the mix of orange and cranberry!

The cranberry sauce was a nice red color.  I substituted about 1/8 cup OJ for water and left the sugar the same.  It wasn't as soupy as others indicated it would be after it cooled.  Cooked it for about 20 minutes.  I did a full boil for a few minutes, and it turned out great :).  I will probably try it again, but with less sugar (I like it tart).

Easy and tasty!  I've experimented with this recipe and now use 1/2 cup cranberry juice, 1/2 cup orange juice (or 1 cup cranberry/tangerine juice), and 1 small can of mandarin oranges, drained. I slice the mandarin orange sections in half and add them to the mixture. They dissolve while cooking. I usually double the recipe because it goes fast in my house!  Everyone loves it, even grandkids!

This is great!  I was making the sauce with water until I found this recipe. I have used this recipe for 3 years now. If you want just plain cranberry sauce with a taste of orange and no other "stuff" then this is for you!

Very good basic recipe.  I also passed this along to a bachelor buddy of my husband's who needed to bring something to a holiday work get-together.  (Had to walk him through it on the phone, as he had never put anything like this togeter from "scratch.")  His comments, "It did just what you said it would and tasted great!"  :-)  Thanks!

Even my "cranberry sauce hating" husband enjoys this.  The only change I make is to add some orange zest -- freshly grated is preferable, but dried works just as well.

I tried this with and without the extra sugar.  They were both great but I think I prefer the recipe the way it is!!!  It's very good.

I had never made cranberry sauce before this. I couldn't believe how easy it was. I ended up adding a bit more sugar, and leting it simmer for a couple minutes, and the texture was perfect!! It got even better after chilling overnight. I will never buy cranberry sauce again!! Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

Very good and easy to make!  I added a splash of Grand Marnier and some fresh lemon zest for a little extra kick.  Everyone loved it!

This cranberry sauce is so good!  Based on other reviewers, I added 1/2 cup more sugar to make it a bit sweeter, and cooked the sauce about 15 minutes.  Also added 2 TB of orange marmalade. Left it in the fridge overnight, and next morning it was jelled perfectly.  Wonderful recipe, THANKS!

I just wanted to say that I have never made homemade cranberry sauce,  I usually use the canned variety.  I made this and it turned out excellent.  I can't believe what I have been missing for so long with homemade.  It was easy to make and the flavor was fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just loved this recipe!!!! Since many reviewers had said that this recipe was very runny, I let it simmer (slow boil) for 20 minutes instead of 10. I made this a day ahead. It was the perfect consistency for me. If you really like it jelled, I would suggest using less water and cooking even longer. I thought it was great!!! It is not sweet, so if you like sweet cranberry sauce, add more sugar. That might help thicken it up too. For me, just lengthening the cooking time produced a perfect dish.

I had never made real cranberry sauce before and this turned out great in the end, but I did have to make some modifications. Like others, I found this runny and tart. Some changes I made to help it solidfy and be sweeter: after it cools a bit, cover it and stick it in the fridge for a while (times can vary, check on it every once and a while to see how it's coming). To sweeten, I added sugar to taste instead of following the recipe. I would also suggest making this early on, so you can leave it in the fridge while you make/heat up other things. All in all, it's simple and the modifications were few, so I'll definetly make it again.

LOVE THIS RECIPIE!
I went through so much effort on my turkey this year but the one thing that had everyone talking was my cranberry sauce.  I added a bit of orange marmalade to it as well for an extra orange zing.

A little too tart and not thick enough.  I followed the recipe and stopped cooking it when the berries started popping.  I even let it go a little longer just to make sure.  It turned out a little too soupy.  I think it would be better if you let it cook a little longer to burn off some of the water and thicken it up.

I loved this cranberry sauce, thought it was ten times better than the canned stuff.  Not too sweet.  My family doesn't like cranberry sauce, except for my mother, and she ONLY eats the jellied canned Ocean Spray kind.  I say she doesn't know what she's missing.  Definitely keeping this recipe for next thanksgiving.

Great recipe!  I utilized other reviewers modifications:  1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup of white sugar, 2/3 cup OJ and 1/4 cup of water; I let the mixture cool 5-10 minutes and used a potato masher to mash up the cranberries.  This was delicious and I will definitely make again..

I made a few changes to this and it came out delish.  Like suggested I did 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white, 2/3 c OJ, 1/3 water.   I also added vanilla bean paste and fireball (for a slight cinnamon flavor).  2 thumbs up!

Fantastic recipe, making this for last years, with a few changes!  Cause of the Dietary restriction, reduce the white sugar to 3/4 of a cup, no brown sugar & once most of the cranberries have popped, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.
For the ones who have the cranberries popped all over their stove, use a deep pot and leave the lid on half way & you will still have an awesome sauce and a clean stove!  

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner with friends & everyone loved it, especially my husband, who was very disappointed to learn that the small leftover amount stayed with our hostess.  People are so impressed with homemade cranberry sauce & it's so easy! As suggested by other reviewers, I did use half brown & half white sugar & also half water & half orange juice.  I also added a touch of cinnamon as well.  Will definitely make this again.

I gave this recipes five stars but with the adjustments that other reviewers suggested.  I agree it needed more than 10 minutes on the stove.  But that extra 10 minutes really did the trick.  It thickened beautifully, was a vibrant color and tasted perfect.  As others have said, no more canned.

This turns out perfect every time and puts canned cranberry sauce to shame. I took the suggestions to use half white sugar and half brown sugar, with a sprinkle of cinnamon. For a good thick sauce, I suggest you cook until just about ALL the cranberries have popped - sauce will already have begun to thicken at that point. I put the finished sauce in several small containers in the freezer so I always have some on hand. Great for making sweet and sour meatballs as well! Right now I am scraping the bottom of the saucepan to put the sauce on American cheese on top of wheat crackers. Heavenly!

Perfect as written, but I added a little Grand Marnier just for fun. Mmmmm...I'll be topping a wheel of brie with this and warming it in the oven until gooey for a potluck treat! Might also throw a few pecans on top.

First batch I made exactly as directed. It was runny and a little too tart tasting (but still very good). For the second batch, I took the suggestion of only using a half cup of OJ and it turned out absolutely delicious but it gelled a little too much. Now I'm working on batch number 3. I used a little more than 1/2 cup but not quite 3/4 cup orange juice and I'm hoping it'll be just right.
Also, definitely use fresh squeezed orange juice to get that super fresh taste. Concentrated OJ makes it too sweet and kind of "preserved" tasting.

Never Have Been a crandberry lover...then my mother found a recipe that was perfect. She made it and I ate it!!!  Well that was so many years ago...she died and I never got the recipe from her. BUT I remember one ingredeint and that was the orange juice.  Guess what this one calls for?  That's right orange juice.  I made it and it was a big hit (more so than the turkey)!  I will be of course making it for this Thanskgiving and here on end. (the only problem is that the three stores we went to were all out of fresh cranberries.  Could it be the public has discovered the seacred??? LOL.   There is one tip I need to pass on... make it two days ahead of time so the orange juice can mix with the cranberries...a match made in heaven.

Perfect recipe! I read the other reviews and decided to add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I'm not big on nutmeg so I went with half of what everybody else said. I don't like cranberries so my daughter (a high school culinary student) reviewed the end results. She said: "The cinnamon stands out but not over-kill. Its tart, tangy, and not too sweet, but I like sweet stuff. The cranberries gives it a great texture instead of the can version that just mushes in your mouth. There is a great after taste too. All the flavors came together in perfect harmony."

This recipe was GREAT! Not to sweet or too tart. I took another reviewers advice and did 3/4 cup OJ, 1/4 cup water and did 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and I highly recommend that too. Delicious and easy!

Perfect! This cranberry sauce is bright, fresh, not too tart and not too sweet. Loved using orange juice instead of water. I added a little of the orange's zest for extra zing. My new favorite!

This is the best cranberry sauce recipe I have ever used. I have always used plain water in the past but the orange juice adds that little something to the flavor.

I made this at Thanksgiving, and it was fantastic, but I made a few changes.  I'm not a fan of cranberries, so I substituted blueberries.  Then, I thought the orange might overpower them, so I used water, and just a couple of squeezes of lemon juice.  I changed the sugar to 1/2c white, 1/4c dark brown, 1/4c light brown.  Then, I added 3 whole cloves while it simmered and removed them after finished.   Since blueberry sauce doesn't really go with a bite of turkey so well, I decided to cool the mixture and used it to top a vanilla ice cream pie - spread softened vanilla ice cream into a graham cracker crust, then top with this recipe (with modifications) and freeze.  Outstanding!

SO easy! My DH saw me making this and he asked "How do you get it to jelly??" I told him that canned cranberry sauce was like canned tuna compared to this! I have converted him to REAL cranberry sauce. I love how quick and simple this recipe is, and it tastes delicious!!

This cranberry sauce was a hit at my Thanksgiving table. Everyone was impressed and couldn't believe how good it was. It looks fancy, but couldn't be easier to make!  I did find that the sauce needed to be refrigerated in order to thicken. Less orange juice is also an option. Personally, I like this proportion of sugar to cranberries. I don't suggest adding more sugar, but use less if you want to bring out more of the tartness of the cranberries.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I only gave it 5 stars because I changed it as per others suggestions.  I used Half orange juice, half water.  I also cut the white sugar down to 3/4 cup.  For me, and everyone who tried it, that was more than sweet enough.

I did the 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar as per reviewers suggestions. The orange taste was quite strong in this and it never thickened up as much as I would have liked. I'm going to give this another go at Christmas and try some of the other reviewers tips and see if I have any better luck. As always thanx for sharing.

I don't usually like cranberry sauce but I couldn't help putting this on everything this year.  Yum!  Followed as directed and it came out fabulous.

I have been making standard cranberry sauce for years. A package of cranberries, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. This is good. BUT take the advice of the other reviewers and use brown sugar and adjust the oj to your liking. The brown sugar and oj adds much depth to the flavor. I will ALWAYS use brown sugar and oj from now one. Fabulous.

I made this for Thanksgiving for a crowd that is happy with the canned cranberries.  Everyone loved it so much and it was very easy...this has become a staple for Thanksgiving!  Never again will we use the canned cranberries.  I made no adjustment to the recipe.

The perfect holiday side. I did take the advice of others and use half brown and half white sugar, half water and half orange juice, and a little bit of cinnamon.

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it.  I did add a couple of pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg, but other than that, did it the same.  The only complaint my husband had was that the cranberry skins seemed kind of tough.  From what I can tell, the skins are just part of homemade cranberry sauce.  Perhaps cooking it just a big longer at a lower heat might help tenderize the skins?  Anyway, we enjoyed it as did our guests.

This is the first time I have ever made homemade cranberry sauce. but this by far is better than canned sauce. However once the sauce has cooled some pop some of the berries to give it a thicker sauce. Excellent!

I have used a recipe like this for a few years and it is quite tasty. You can also add a splash of red wine to this to give an extra zip. The alcohal cooks off, and gives a great flavor.

I'm really not a cranberry person and this was almost too tart for me. However it was pretty good. I decided last minute for Thanksgiving to add Cheese-Cake flavored pudding, it was super yummy for me after that. It helped calm the tart taste down and it was like a Cranberry Cheese Cake.

This is the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted. Be warned, it needs to sit for quite a while before serving to solidify - I'd say at least half an hour after removing from heat.

I love this simple but elegant recipe. The sauce was so perfert that I made another batch and put in decorative jars to give as gifts. I recommend using slightly less orange juice if you want the sauce thicker. But not to worry, surprise of all surprises, I mixed up a vodka martini using some of the extra juice from this sauce. Delicious!

Easy classic recipe!  Worth the effort.  You know that unmistakable sound the canned stuff makes as it slithers out of can?  No more!  FYI...this is the same recipe as Cranberry Sauce.

I thought this needed an extra 2T of sugar, then it was delicious.  I quadrupled the recipe and we had plenty for a party of 50 people.

This was awsome and easy to recover the measurement mistakes I made.  I thought that one and a half cups was 12 ounces as cranberrys but I needed more like three cups.  So i started it, and it was too thin.  This didnt cause any probs, just added more crans and a bit more sugar.  Everyone really liked it Especailly me.  Thanks, this is a new favorite and made me very HAPPY

Yummy!  Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as suggested.  Also used 1/2 OJ 1/2 water.  Couldn't have been better.

Best tasting cranberry sauce ever. I followed the recipe exactly and this came out perfectly. I served it on Thanksgiving and my guests LOVED it. I'll never buy that canned stuff again!

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever tasted, and I'm normally not a fan of cranberry sauce!  Definitely make sure your cranberries have "popped"/split open so the inside of the berry absorbs the sweet juice.  If you don't wait long enough, your cranberries will be extremely tart!

It was okay.  A little too runny.  I would have liked it thicker.  I refrigerated it for 8 hours, but still soupy.  My guests didn't say much about it.

I followed the recipe as written. I will now make changes. This just wasn't what I was hoping for. It didn't thicken that much....was still very tart....and I saw most of my guests scraping it off their plate. I was disappointed.

Very good!  Even my mother-in-law agreed that it was better than the same recipe that she uses (with water instead of O.J.)  My father-in-law really liked it as well.  I normally don't like cranberries because of their tartness.  I decided to make this recipe because I thought the O.J. would make it sweeter and tone down the tartness of the cranberries.  It did and I was able to enjoy them!

I grew up with homemade whole-berry cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving, but my Mom always made it the traditional way with just cranberries, water and sugar.  Replacing the water with orange juice makes a world of difference.  It's tart and sweet all at the same time and is a great compliment to roast turkey and all the necessary accoutrements.  I also added a little bit of orange zest, and I think that gave it a little more orange flavor.

Very easy to prepare.  I added a touch of cinnamon as suggested by others, which gave it an extra dimension of flavor.  This doesn't even compare to the canned stuff, which I never liked.  This was delicious!

Very nice traditional cranberry sauce.  I will make again as it for Christmas, as the orange flavor makes me think of Christmas, but at other times I think I'll try half water, half orange juice to tone down the background flavor.  Quick, easy and delicious, this one was a winner at our house.

Awesome. Made it today. Very traditional and nice texture. Since this sauce is more on the tart side I made a pecan glaze and kept come of the sauce by itself and then mixed some with the glaze, really yummy sweet/sour combo.

I love this recipe - fast and easy. The only thing I change is that I use Baker's Sugar instead of regular granulated. 

A great recipe for beginners.

This cranberry relish is simple to make and tastes great. I made it exactly as described then put it in the freezer for about half an hour to cool as it made it right before dinner. It was great with pork and I will be making this on Thanksgiving as well.

I made the recipe just as stated.  I was unclear on how long to cook the sauce once the cranberries started popping but ended up cooking it until all berries were popped and quite soft and the sauce was beginning to thicken.  After pouring it in a bowl and letting it cool for a couple of hours, it was the perfect consistency.  It did seem a little tart, so next time I will follow some other suggestions and put 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup water to see if that helps.  It is definately easy, very tasty, and impressed my family at our Thanksgiving Dinner.

I've been making this for a few years now and I've tweaked the recipe as others suggested, also added different juice (only because it's what me and my family prefer).  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of pineapple orange juice, and 1/2 cup of water, with a couple dashes of cinnamon.  I grew up hating cranberry sauce especially because it was the kind out of a can, but once I found this recipe, I never turned back!  I absolutely love it & bring it to holiday dinners, which so far no one even thinks about making fresh cranberry sauce!

I made this for Thanksgiving. My dad loves cranberry sauce, and he gave this recipe his approval. He loved it. He said that it reminded him of the cranberry sauce his mom used to make. I, myself never liked cranberry sauce, but this one I found very tasty! I would definitely make this again. Thanks!

It is a solid recipe if you like your cranberry sauce on the tart side. I usually only add ¾ cup sugar (1 cup can be overwhelming if you don’t like your sauces too sweet). Also, I juice a fresh orange for the 1 cup juice and use the orange zest as well.

Yum yum yum! I followed the recommendation to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Came out perfect! Though cook time ended up taking more like 30 minutes.

I had no idea how easy making your own cranberry sauce could be, the only change to the recipe was I used Splenda in place of sugar. Served for thanksgiving and everyone was impressed.

This recipe is very good.  I have been making cranberry sauce from the directions on the bag after watching my mother-in-law do it. My family always just bought the can stuff, which I would not eat.  So this year I used two cups of orange juice, 2 bags of cranberries, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar with just a touch of cinnamon and a touch of vanilla.  Awesome stuff.  None left to bring home.

I received great compliments on this dish, which debuted on our Thanksgiving table.  I followed recipe exactly this time, but I did read reviews about 1/2 water and 1/2 OJ.  I think I will do that next time.  The sauce was very good, but VERY sweet.

Have made this 5 times. It is better when it is 1/2 brown sugar.  Have added cinamon, but this makes it taste less like cranberrys

This was really amazing! I thought I loved the canned cranberries, but no more! I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers: I added about a tsp orange zest, about 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier, and I also cooked them for about 20 minutes. I can't wait for my cranberry-hating husband to try them because I know he will be a convert! Thank you Toni!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. Super easy to make. I couldn't wait to try it and it was really good. I'd been looking for a good Orange Cranberry Sauce recipe for a while and I found it. I'll definitely be making this next year. Thanks for posting it.

Orange and cranberry are great together.  I however add grated nutmeg, some orange zest and a little cinnamon to this one.  I use 1/2 water and 1/2 OJ.  This recipe however beats the canned stuff.

I made this yesterday to serve for Thanksgiving but I had to try it, just to make sure it was good....YUMMY!!!  I boiled it a little past when the berries started popping to ensure a thick consistency and it is perfect!  I cannot wait to serve it!  I used 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup water after reading other reviews!  So much better than the canned stuff!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out wonderful! I used organic cranberries and Wegman's orange juice. I added a few dashes of cinnimon and I don't think it could get any better than this.  I will never buy cranberry sauce again!

I also followed the modifications suggested by reviewers...so it was 3/4 oj, 1/2 h2o and 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar...I made this because my sister wanted cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving...the rest of the fam is not fond of it.  I just tried it and I know it will be a hit!

I was a little dissappointed with this recipe at first.  I expected it to be more like a relish, not a sauce (my own mistake).  It was very easy, though, and I actually think I prefered it to the second, uncooked recipe I made the same day!

Loved this recipe!   It's a bit more fun to make then the boring old sugar-water-cranberry recipe.  It's easy and comes out very spicy and good.  I took the suggestions of others and did 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar thing. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp orange zest to the orange juice before adding the cranberries.  I cooked the concoction for a full 10 minutes after it came to a boil.  I poured it into a nice white serving dish.  It set up immediately upon cooling.  I can't wait to serve it for Thanksgiving.  Thanks, Toni!

It's a definite keeper. I ended up making this ahead of time because I've NEVER made cran. sauce before and I didn't want to end up with a disaster.

My roommates ate some of the oranges I was going to use, lol (I used fresh juice), so I only had 1/4 c. orange juice. To make up the difference, I added in 3/4 c. of a sugar-free cranberry-raspberry sparkling water we had in the fridge.

Also used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white.

Followed directions: dissolved sugar in orange juice/water mixture and tossed in the cranberries.

They started to pop almost immediately. I tasted it, then added in a sprinkle of cinammon and a splash of vanilla.

I think it'd be beneficial to mention that the cranberries were popping and splashing me with hot juice, so I started smooshing them up right then.

I probably won't strain the mixture (as some people suggested) but I'll probably give it a few pulses in the food processor, just to get rid of the bigger clumps. I kinda like a lumpier sauce, anyway. :)

Anyhoo, thanks for a great recipe--I know I tweaked it a bit, but it's a great base, if anything else.

Just made this as a make-ahead dish for Thanksgiving.  It turned out AWESOME!!!!  It is still cooling and thickening as we speak, but tastes so tart and luscious as it is right now.  Made a couple changes based on other reviews and ingredients I had around the house.  I used 3/4 cup Organic pure sugar in lieu of white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar Splenda blend.  I added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (no cinnamon on hand), 1 tsp pure vanilla, and added 2 shots of grand marnier at the end.  Thanks for the recipe Toni.  I know I made some minor changes!

I just made this cranberry sauce and it is wonderful! I took the suggestion of using half and half on the brown and white sugar, half and half on the water and orange juice, cooked to the consistency I thought I might want, and roughly an 1/8t of cinnamon. I love it and will be proud to serve it on Thanksgiving this year. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I gave it 5 stars because although I opted to take the tips offered by others, I have the feeling it would be equally as awesome if I would have followed the recipe to the letter :)

This has been used for the last two years and is a hit.  I was a bit worried, but it turned out wonderfully.  I upped the OJ a bit and added some fresh orange zest right after I pulled it from the heat.  Relatives begged to take some home.  The running joke is that I only made some of the best crandberry sauce (easy to do too) but I created an amazing topping for vanilla ice cream.  Thank you for making me a hit.

First time making and having cranberry sauce, it is now a staple for every turkey dinner! I took the recommendation from other reviews about using half brown sugar and I think it definitely made a difference. A must-have!

I'm another person who doesn't *love* cranberries/cranberry sauce.  But, I'll usually have a bite or two, and hosting my first Thanksgiving last year I thought it necessary to make some. 
I followed the recipe exactly as above (except I found it took a bit longer to make the berries "pop"), and it turned out DELICIOUS.  The sauce was gobbled up with no leftovers.  I found myself buying   more cranberries throughout the season to make this.  It refrigerates well and makes a nice breakfast for the whole week!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was excellent! I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar, added orange zest and a little cinnamon. My 3 year old kept asking for "more yummy sauce." I'll never have canned again.

I tweaked this just a bit.  I tasted it ahead of time and it was too tart for me.  I simply added another cup of granulated sugar and simmered for 20-25 minutes.  Delicious!

My family loves cranberry sauce, and my grandmother- a domestic queen- made some of the best.  My mother said this was better! I included the three ingredients the recipe provides, and also added most of a small bottle (the "airplane-sized" ones you can get at the liquor store)of Grand Marnier. That really added some depth to the orange flavor- I'd recommend trying that! Will certainly be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and got raves from everyone.  I never ate cranberries, but it looked so easy I decided to try it, and even I liked it.  I did take suggestions from other reviews and slit the orange juice with water, added some cinnamin, cooked down about 30 minutes and sat in the fridge overnight.  Came out perfect.

We thought this was good, but no one raved about it at Thanksgiving. In fact no one commented on it at all. I made a sweet potato casserole that everyone raved about. This recipe was a bit too tart for my taste - maybe I'll try it again with some brown sugar added. I like the idea of serving the leftovers with cream cheese to give it a balance of flavors. It did look beautiful in the serving dish and had a great color. I'll try it again with some modifications.

I took the advice of others and used 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water, used part brown sugar. This turned out wonderful.  I also cooked it for about 15 minutes and it was perfect.  Not too tart, but not too sweet either.  The hint of orange was a nice touch. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe!  My parents are huge fans of Cranberry Sauce, but my brother and I aren't very big fans of it.  We have always had the can cranberry sauce.  The sauce is too tart for my parents, so I put in some crushed pineapples in it to make it a little bit sweeter.  My brother who has never been a fan of cranberry sauce loves this and eats it as dessert!

This was so easy to make which was a big plus, however, no one raved about it at the T-giving meal today, which was a disappointment after all the rave reviews this recipe has received.  My brother actually said to stick with the canned cranberry sauce. However, my father  and husband liked it ok, but, again, not a rave review as expected.

I think the orange juice was over-powering.  The sauce tasted more like oranges than cranberries.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving, and mixed it with a stick blender after it cooled to make it smoother and more "jelly"-like. It was perfect! I will never buy the canned stuff again! My brother-in-law always teases me about the can-shaped sauce - well not anymore!!

Great flavor -- my family loved it!  I thought the sauce could use a little thickening, though, and will use some corn starch next time.  Definitely a keeper and so simple.

so incredibly easy! and very good!  the consistency is more liquidy than a gel though.  that may change the longer it's in the fridge though...it was a last minute decision to make this so it only sat in the fridge a few hours.  very good!

I never made cranberry sauce before but this was so easy and good.  Only problem is it makes a lot.  Unless you are making it for a large group, cut it in half.(You can freeze the extra cranberries.)

I made this last night for a trial run for Thanksgiving........that and some of the reviews say after a couple days in the fridge it tastes the best.  I tasted it this morning and it was great.  Lots of fun to watch the cranberries pop too!  The orange flavor definitely comes through, so if you are not a fan of oranges, you might want to sub water in place of the O.J. I will edit this review after Thanksgiving and see how others took to the sauce!
11/25/05 - This was not as much a hit as I expected - after a day and a half in the fridge, it was still pretty tart - good though.  It needs something to mellow it out a bit.  I would like to try one of the cranberry chutney recipes on this site next.

This is a wonderful recipe I have been making for years-especially if you use fresh orange juice. I make mine in the microwave- easy! Just put it in a glass heat resistant bowl, and heat on high until cranberries pop. (Stir once or twice.) It's easier than watching it on the stove. Try it!

I made this as a test run before Thanksgiving, and I now know what all the hype is about. This is way too easy to ever buy canned again. Per my tastes, I added about another 1/8 cup of sugar and blended until smooth, since I'm more of a jellied type person. I served it warm over angel food cake with a bit of whipped topping and it was delish!

I regret not following this recipe for tg dinner.  I followed another, 'kicked up' with lemon and orange zest.  I was careful to not grate the pith but from the taste of it, it was a 5 star bomb, so bitterly gross, I had to throw it away.  Less is more.  I will make this recipe next time.

It doesn't get any easier or any better than this...why would anyone want the canned stuff?  It looks so pretty on the table too.  I had to cook mine a little longer than the recipe stated in order for the cranberries to break up a little.  Put it in the fridge overnight and served the next day.  Looks and tastes expensive.

Took it to thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews.  Little did everyone know how little time I spent on it.  Some changes I made to the original recipe: I added 1 and 1/4 cups of suger even though I don't think the extra forth was necessary.  I also cooked for about 15 minutes on medium heat.  After I made it I was running short on time so I stuck it in the frezzer to cool for about an hour and then transfered it to the refrigerator.  Great recipe

I cooked the cranberry sauce the night before and just let it sit in the refrigerator until I was ready to serve it. It was superb!

Very tasty recipe - tastes exactly like it should!  I first cooked mine about 15 minutes - until the cranberries popped.  After about 8 hours it still had not thickened like it should have.  I decided to cook it up some more (figured what did I have to lose!) and after another 10-15 minutes of cooking it came out great!  Tasted wonderful with our thanksgiving turkey!

Those who like cranberry sauce really enjoyed this recipe. I am not a fan of cranberry sauce, but I made it for those who do...I cannot believe how incredibly easy this was to make. The best part is that you can make it at least a day ahead in order to save yourself some time.

Awesome!!! I don't even like canberry juice mixed with orange juice.  It definitely needed to be made the night before because at first I thought it was too bitter, but by the next day it was perfect!!

Excellent sauce.  I made it two days ahead of time and the texture turned out perfect!  Next time, I will reduce the quantity of sugar as I really like the tart taste of the cranberries. It was a little too sweet for my taste.  Nevertheless, it was quite good!

Umm ... cranberry sauce??  If the recipe meant for the end result to be runny and soup-like then sure, it deserves 5 stars.  But, I don't think it was meant for that.  The sauce hardly thickened after cooling and the orange juice kind of washes out the cranberry flavor.  The end result is something like a cranberry liquid, similar to the strawberry kind you find draped over a slice of cheesecake.  For your sake, find a better recipe or buy Oceanspray Cranberry Sauce in the can.

This was another great recipe!
My 6 year old son made it!  It was great!  I normally do not like homemade cranberry sauce because of the orange peel.The Orange juice did the job perfect!   Move over Ocean Spray!.
Well this is now our favorite cranberry sauce.  My son asked if he could make it again for Christmas!

Real easy to make. A nice alternative to store bought canned gelatin sauce. I thickened my sauce up with some watered down corn starch. I'm not a big fan but always like to have this at the holidays.

I  have made this twice and my family raves about it.  So much better than canned - though its not Thanksgiving without the ridges from the can on the sauce for some.  

I do use some squeezed orange juice in addition to the juice from the carton.  I also add zest to the top when serving. Nice presentation

Far too sweet, I normally follow a compromise of several recipes.  Decided today to find a simple, basic recipe.  (I always add a little and/or brandy or rum.  I doubled  the recipe to have some left for Christmas.     It was way too SWEET.    I should have read the reviews.  Anyway, added some brandy and rum, still  overly sweet, then added fresh squeezed lemon juice.   Had my very critical husband taste the final effort, (he also has a sweet tooth) but liked the lemon juice addition  better.   I would reduce the sugar by at least 25%.

This is so delicious! Be sure you check the weight of the package of cranberries you are using or you won’t get the thickness you want in your sauce.  My bag was only 8 ounces, not 12 ounces and so I just cut the recipe down 1/3. I used 1/3 cup orange juice and 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar. I simmered it down to a consistency I liked (about 12 minutes) and added 2 T. Grand Mariner. It gave an extra richness to the flavor but also made it too tart. I had some simple syrup in the cupboard so I added a splash and it tastes wonderful. Even my husband, a notorious cranberry hater, had it admit, “That’s pretty darned good!”

I used a fresh squeezed orange and added enough water to make one cup.  I did mash the cranberries while cooking as it was still very clumpy.  It looks and tastes great!

I make this every year, and the only ingredient that I vary is I use mango orange juice. As for getting it to set up, I cook it until they STOP popping, not when they start, then stir continuously until the color and texture change to thick and red. Then, I cool it in the pot if I'm chilling it, or serve it right up hot.

Love it! I’ve made it numerous times and everyone in my family loves it for holidays. I do 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and I add a little cinnamon. You can’t go wrong with this recipe. I have the leftovers with geek yogurt and granola. So good!

I love this recipe. Super easy and the family loves it at Thanksgiving dinner, which we host. Make sure that you allow enough time for it to gel in the fridge, preferably overnight. It freezes really well, so make a double batch. That way you only have to make it every other year.

Very easy and quick to make.  I cut the sugar in half as we like things tart.  Turned out great.  Made it the night before our feast and it was the perfect consistency.

I always make a fresh cranberry sauce, and I’ve tried a few different recipes. I decided to try this recipe, but I used 1/2 a cup of sugar, 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. I really enjoyed the flavor, as did the rest of my family!

As suggest by others - 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white. Also two tbsp of gran marnier.  I'm not crazy about cranberry sauce to begin with but for those that are ... it was a hit!

Taste great and so easy to make!  Usually make it the day before, but decided to make it two days ahead to help with the setup.  Shame we only make it during the holidays,  need to break that bad habit - delicious.

Just made this and I asked my husband for his opinion. He stated it was "perfect".  Can't ask for anymore than that.  I followed the directions as written except the cranberries were an 8 oz bag so I adjusted the recipe to reflect the changes in ounces.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added a tablespoonful of orange zest to the recipe. If you cook all but 1/4 cup of cranberries as listed, then add them near the end you get a more tart dish. I've cooked both ways and we've enjoyed the cranberries either way. If you rather have less sweetness use water instead of juice and increase the zest. I used lemon zest once, forgot to get oranges, and it was nearly as good. Thank you for this basic recipe.

I like this a lot!  I just had some on a turkey burger with arugula, green apple and Brie.  I reduced the sugar by half, I also diluted the orange juice slightly (I remembered at the last minute to try that!).  It seemed much better with less sugar.   We made it with all the sugar a month ago and it was so sweet we didn't even eat it all and threw a lot out.   I would recommend but, reduce the sugar!

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I did add some orange zest and the juice from one orange (with water to make 1 cup). We ate it all!

This was simple and tasty.  It was the first time I had used fresh cranberries in a sauce and it  tasted great!  I also watched the video for this recipe and it was helpful in showing how the orange juice and sugar needed to come to a simmer before adding the cranberries.

I love this recipe. I use 1/2 cup of OJ and 1/2 cup of water and 3/4 cup of sugar because we like ours a little more tart.  I suggest starting with 1/2 cup sugar and add more as you taste it .  I also add a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cinnamon.  I also cook it down more for a thicker consistency.  Medium simmer  for about 15 minutes will give a thicker sauce.

Good!   Did what others suggested and used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar; and orange juice and water.  Also  added 2 tsp. of fresh grated orange peel and 1/8 tsp. cinnamon.  Next time I will try strips or orange peel and will add 1/2 tsp. of baking soda to cut the acidity.  This would help the sauce lay easier on my stomach without upset.

This is exactly the simple recipe I was looking for. In 10 min. all was cooked,  BUT I put the cranberries through a strainer & mashed the berries with the back of a spoon and scraped the outside of the strainer. It made jelled sauce.  It is so simple and so delicious.
Thanks Toni

I've never liked canned cranberry sauce so I was on a mission to find a recipe.   This was the basic recipe I went with.   I wonder if the orange juice is intended to be fresh squeezed but I opted instead to use a low sugar oj and I ended up trying what others recommended in using half brown sugar / half white sugar.   I cooked until most of the cranberries were easily mashable, maybe 15 minutes.  If you prefer more tart than sweet, just cut back on the sugar or dilute the oj with water.   It gelled beautifully -- turned out perfect!!!      My holiday guests and I thank you!!!

This was very good; my wife loved it.  i made it with brown sugar and it tasted fine, though maybe a bit sweet.  The second time i made it i used less sugar and orange juice, and added cointreau.  You loose a bit of the cranberryness that the sauce should have, but it was good.

This recipe is perfect and so easy! I did half white half brown sugar, and half orange juice half water, like some reviewers suggested. I also made this in two batches - the first one I cooked for a little longer (about 18 minutes), breaking down the cranberries a bit more. The second batch I made as directed. Mixing the two together resulted in a nice mix of textures: a slightly smoother sauce with some structurally intact cranberries throughout. Came out great for Thanksgiving; got a few compliments and one request for the recipe. This one's a keeper.

I loved the tartness of this sauce.  I made one change to this recipe by replacing the white sugar with 1 cup of splenda.  However, next time, I think I will reduce the amount of splenda to 1/2 - 3/4 cup.  I also allowed the berries to boil for approximately 10 mins after they had popped.  Very good!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious that I don't know why anyone would want to use the stuff that slides out from the can.  I used to think I didn't like cranberry sauce because I didn't like the bitter flavor from the jellied stuff in the can.  But then I found this and never went back.  Easy, delicious, and truly impressive.  Yum!

Made recipe today, used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar. I had one orange used zest and squeezed juice. Also added some unsweetened pineapple and a little of the juice. A dash of cinnamon. Delicious. I like my  cranberry tart, not sweet. Easy to make. I'll freeze whatever is left.

This is my first time ever making cranberry sauce. I usually buy the junk in the can for my dad and husband. OMG! This is awesome. It's sweet and tart. So delish! I did cover it while cooking, as another reviewer mentioned it. It does splatter. I did have a little over spill. Oops! My own fault for walking away. Quick and easy recipe.

Love the simplicity of this recipe. I like to add fresh mint to mine. I simmer 4-5 diced leaves with the sugar and orange juice before adding the cranberries. Delicious and easy!

Used this recipe as it's written for three years now - everyone loves it.  This year, I just tried using a little less OJ and subbed brown sugar for white and added a dash of cinnamon.  It's even more excellent!  Really impressed with how easy this is and you can make it ahead a few days.  You can also sprinkle in some orange zest while cooking or on top.

Yum!  I'm never buying canned cranberry sauce again!  This is my first time making cranberry sauce of any kind and I'll return to this recipe next year.  I would maybe add slightly less sugar next time just for my tastes, but this was SO easy and it's SO delicious!

I absolutely LOVE this super easy recipe. Taking ideas from other reviews changing the recipe a bit was super helpful!! 
Used 1/2c OJ
1/2c brown sugar
1/2white sugar
And cooked for 20min instead of 10!! 
Perfect amount of sweet!

I had made this recipe before but i halved it with white and dark brown sugar that was commented on here by some others with 1/8 tsp of cinnamon for kick. 

It took about 5 minutes for the cranberry to break so watch your stoves people!

Get ready for some Thanksgiving Greatness!

OMG!!! I made this yesterday for Friendsgiving. All I have to say is YUM! I love cranberry but hate the junk in the can. My friends always rave about my cooking and it's all because of  allrecipes. Made exactly as written just stirred a drop of grand Marnier in once it was room temp. Please make this, you will not be disappointed.  Thank you for sharing a simple but amazing recipe

I have made this cranberry sauce for quite a few years now. It turns out great Everytime. Once it has cooled, I add crushed pineapple, mandarin oranges, crushed walnuts & a handful of flaked coconut. My family loves it & any leftover goes great on low-fat vanilla yogurt for breakfast.

I added a pinch of cloves and it was perfect. 
I've used both North American and Wild Russian cranberries (frozen, from a Russian deli). If you can find the Russian cranberries they are sweeter and juicier - both types are good though!

I made this recipe again this year and loved it. I did make some changes. I added 1/2t. cinnamon, 1/4t. orange extract, 1tsp. grated orange rind. I also added a tsp. more sugar besides the cup of sugar,because it seemed a bit more tart for my taste.

This cranberry sauce is amazing!  I don't normally eat cranberry sauce but this is truly delicious.  My daughter loves it and says it should be a topping on a cheesecake! I did make a few changes as suggested by previous reviews.  I did 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Can't wait to make it again!

Wonderful recipe. I tried it, but it was too sour (probably the cranberries and the OJ were sour at the first place). So I add a wee bit if sugar and it was perfect. Thank you for this wonderful EASY recipe!

Doubled the recipe. Added 1/2 brown sugar. Added cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg as OJ and sugar mix boiled. Added cranberries, cooked for 1/2 hr. Added 1 cup orange marmalade and pine nuts. Garnished with orange zest. I plan on serving this for Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you for the great recipe. I love allrecipes.

This has become my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving. The sauce is the right amount of tart and sweet. I substitute Splenda for sugar and it works fine. Might be a little sweet for some so perhaps a little less Splenda if you go that route.

I saw one other poster puts in Grand Marnier and I do as well. I put about two tablespoons in just before serving and after refrigerating (I make the night ahead). I also put in some chopped walnuts - a small handful or so - just before serving to give some crunch to the sauce. Purely for presentation, I grate orange zest over the top. 

I have gotten many complements on this very simple but delicious recipe. It's now a family tradition.

Outstanding!  I used Truvia instead of sugar and it was so delightful and delicious.  Yum!

I wanted to try a fresh cranberry sauce this year and I was not dissapointed!  I made the suggested changes: 1/2 C sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar, 1/2 C OJ, 1/2 C water, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It was so simple and easy, and my kids who normally won't touch cranberry sauce couldn't stop eating it!

This is awesome warm, probably cold too. The cranberries exploded in my mouth. Perfect! I like this better than the kind where you grind up the berries & orange. Used freshly squeezed OJ.

So easy to make, and possibly the best cranberry sauce I've ever had. My Thanksgiving guests said the same thing) After the berries started to pop, I think I kept cooking it for another 5 minutes. Total cooking time was about 9 minutes for me.

I did a taste test. I made cranberry sauce with the recipe on the package which is really quite good and the way I usually make it. Then I made another batch with this recipe - The whole family agrees this is by far the winner. Awesome! Thanks for making me look good :)

Very easy to make.  I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of white and added 1 cinnamon stick.  Cooked until all the cranberries popped and sauce thickened.  I use this recipe every year for thanksgiving!

Awesome except I used half orange juice/ half water and I used half  brown/half white sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  When it was done cooking, I mashed it with a potato masher and cooked a couple more minutes.  It was fantastic. Yum. It was my first time making cranberry sauce. I will never used canned again. I made it two days ahead of time.

Perfect!  Easy!  I followed the directions precisely the first time, and it turned out wonderful.
Second time, added some frozen raspberries.  That was a fantastic addition.

Oh my goodness.  This was the most delicious cranberry sauce recipe ever!  I almost platzed!  The one change that my gorgeous daughter and I made to the recipe was to use a bit, just a little bit, of apple cider.  Sweet, yet tangy.  So delicious, so fantastic.  We will make it again and again.

Super easy and super tasty!  I made some changes based on other reviews- I used 1/2 c water, 1/2 c orange juice, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar and tossed in a cinnamon stick.  I think next time I'll throw some crystalized ginger in too.

I made this right before Thanksgiving. I figured I try this and see if everyone noticed the difference. It was perfect! I did the suggestions and used 1/2 cup of brown and white sugar, fresh squeezed orange juice, 1 tsp of cinnamon. But added 1/4 cup of Cherry Port. It came out so good I'm using this for gifts this year.

Made this last night, first time to try homemade cranberry. After reading through the reviews, I did the 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular sugar.  Came out awesome!  Hubby wants me to make a cranberry pie with this.  Will definitely make this again for thanksgiving!  Thank you!

This recipe is good as is but next time I will cook the cranberries a little longer and then run the whole mixture through a food mill to get a nice smooth sauce without any chunks.

This recipe has become a staple for holidays.  We always served the canned cranberry sauce, but never again.  So easy to make and is so good!  I add a cinnamon stick to it as well.

I have never been a fan of Cranberry sauce nor ever attempted to make it. However, this recipe was very easy and I wil never buy a can of cranberry sauce again for my guests. This was simple and delicious according to my guests. They took home the leftovers!

This is a good start for cranberry sauce. Add some orange zest and jelliton to make it even better. Replace sugar with sweetener substitute to reduce calories.

First of all, when you being cooking it, the smell is divine.  I took the other reviewers advice and added cinnamon and brown sugar and it was wonderful. Made it for Thanksgiving instead of buying the canned cranberry sauce and it was really easy to make and tasted so much better. Won't do canned again !

everyone liked these okay, but I thought that the sauce would have been thicker. maybe I should have left more of them pop?

I tried this recipe this Thanksgiving, and I absolutely loved it! This is a very quick and easy recipe, and I was impressed at the results, since I'm a novice at making cranbery sauce. The combination of tart and sweetness was right on point for me. The cook time was very quick, although I did cook a little longer than 10mins, but not by much. Afterwards, I put the cooked sauce in a bowl and let it cool down just a tad before placing in the fridge. I made this maybe 3-4 hours before dinner, and the consistency was great when I pulled it out of the fridge. Must try!

I've never made cranberry sauce before and was surprised at how easy this recipe was.  Definitely a new favorite!  My whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- I added a handfull of frozen raspberries so it had a mild cran-raspberry taste.

The easiest, best canberry sauce hands down. I always have to give out the recipe when ever I make it, and no one believes how easy it is to make. A keeper for sure.

If I knew cooking cranberry sauce was this easy I would have never bought any from the store. It turned out great. Thanks for all the other ideas. I will have to try some of the other ideas next time.

I am always thrilled and eager to try a recipe thats straight to the point!! 3 ingredients, YES!!! When I read the recipe I was hoping for a similar sauce to the honey baked ham company's orange walnut cranberry sauce, so i added a cup of chopped walnuts(keep them big, not too small) and it was pretty much a dead ringer from what I remember!! Super easy recipe, very delicious, I had no issues with the "gelling", I read one review about someone using a potato masher, not necessary. I used the plastic spoon(one safe for cooking with) that I was using to stir the ingredients with,I just took the back of the spoon and mashed it up, but not entirely, its nice to have some chunky cranberries in there, but you could easily mash it all if desired!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! Next time I will try using half brown sugar half white like another reviewer suggested, and maybe the grand marnier, but this recipe rocks as is.  Also I used a no pulp OJ, not sure if anyone has tried it with pulp.

Made this for the first time today. It smelled sooo good while cooking, couldn't wait to try it! It tastes good, but mine turned out a little too tart. Maybe my cranberries were not ripe enough. Added a little more sugar, hopefully it will be ok for tomorrows turkey. I love cranberries, so I will try this recipe again, but I'll prpbably half the orange juice for water.

I've used this recipe for years and I believe the recipe as is makes this a genuine basic cranberry sauce recipe.  There's no need to change anything, the straight forward flavor of the cranberries compliment the savory sides of Thanksgiving.  If you are compelled to change it, there are better recipes if you're looking for one that is sweet.

I made this once before and followed the directions exactly. The result was good enough that I decided to use the recipe again with a couple of alterations. The base recipe is certainly worthy of 4 stars, but with the changes, it's easily 5.  The second time around I used half brown sugar and half white, reduced the liquid to 3/4 cup (1/2 cup OJ and 1/4 cup water), added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and simmered for 15 minutes.  This sauce is great as a sandwich spread, too.  Take a couple slices of sourdough, spread both sides with the sauce, top with some leftover turkey breast, a couple slices of bacon and a slice of swiss. Grill the sandwich until golden and cheese is melted. This makes an awesome turkey melt! Will certainly be using this recipe every holiday.

I won't be buying the canned cranberry sauce again - I had no idea homemade cranberry sauce could be so easy.  Taking the advice of other cooks, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; and used 1/2 cup OJ with 1/2 cup water.  Very impressive - thanks!

Very easy recipe but to make the sauce more thicker and tart, I substituted the cup of orange juice to a half cup and I added sliced apricots to give it more texture.

I am blown away by the high ratings for this.  Put simply, if you have NEVER made cranberry sauce in your life, and have only ever had canned jellied sauce, this would be MAGIC.  If you are looking for a new yummy sauce that your guests haven't had, THIS is NOT it. This is a basic sauce that you would use as the BASE to then play with and create something wonderful.

I've never been a fan on cranberry sauce (or so I thought), until I tried this a few years back.  It's AMAZING.

This couldn't have been any easier. Made with 1/2 OJ, 1/2 water, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white. It was nice and thick after chilling in the fridge overnight. I will never, ever buy the can again!

Fantastic! Don't be afraid of the portion size, I halved the recipe since I'm cooking for two and I worry it's not enough! Only change I made is using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.

My absolute favorite cranberry sauce. This sauce converted many of my family who were "cranberry jelly with the can molded look" lovers into cranberry sauce fans.

I gave this a test run tonight and it was beautiful. The texture and color was wonderful! I've never had cooked cranberry sauce before...maybe its a southern thing. I only gave it four starts because it was way too sweet and orange-y for me, maybe next time I'll substitute water or white grape juice for the orange juice.

This recipe is very good, it has a nice sweet and bitter taste to it that makes it very yummy! Though I do tend to like very sweet cranberry sauce so I added two cups instead of one.

This is a great recipe and has lots of room to play and experiment.  I have made this a number of times using half OJ and half water for a more cranberry, less orange-y taste.  When I use the OJ in full force I often add some orange peel zest which is a nice touch.  Even better is some Grand Marnier if you have it.  It is also fun to play with the sugar.  I enjoy doing 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I think it gives the cranberry sauce a more sophisticated taste.  Enjoy this great recipe and have fun making it your own!

This was simple and tasty!  I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are other recipes out there that really wow the taste buds but they are more work and more ingredients.  This is the simple KISS recipe.  :-)

Really good. I gave it four stars because I found it too sweet. The orange juice really made it. I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves - awesome. The base itself is great though!

I have never like Cranberry Sauce myself but my family loves it.  they raved about how wonderful homemake sauce was. it was.  I was pleased.  It is so simple to make - I had no idea - why would one buy a can when i could just scale this one back to size porportions.  Thanks

I made this for Thanksgiving, so delicious! I added two cinnamon sticks to the sauce while it was simmering which added a wonderful subtle flavor. I also zested some of the orange peel into the sauce, mmm. My family insisted on making this a holiday dinner must.

Great recipe!  I read through the previous reviews and did the 1/2 cup brown 1/2 cup white sugar as well as 1/2 cup OJ and 1/2 cup H2O.  I also added the zest of an orange.  Delicious!  Couldn't get enough!

This was such a great recipe - easy and unbelievably tasty!  I did use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, along with a bit of Grand Marnier mixed in before serving.  Everyone though it was delicious!

It was ok.  I made one batch per this recipes, exactly. If you want a no-brainer that you can whip up every year by memory, by all means you can't go wrong with this one.  But I made a second batch following some poster's suggestions, and it was far supperior. I'm going to post that recipe myself, because I don't think people should rate this one five stars when they're making something very different.

Very easy and delicious. I will never use store bought cranberry sauce again. I used less sugar and 1/2 cup OJ and the rest water. Next time I may try POM juice instead of the orange.

I bit too tangy for a few people, but I liked it.  Next time only half the o.j.  I also altered the recipe by doing half brown and half white sugar. After cooking finished, I added a tbs of orange liquer.

Good, basic cranberry sauce. All of my Thanksgiving guests really enjoyed it and were impressed that I served real cranberry instead of the canned stuff! This was so simple to make...almost as easy as opening a can!

This was very easy and very yummy!  The cranberries I bought were a little sour so I added an additional 1/3c orange juice and 1/3c sugar.

My favorite! Quick tip: cranberrys freeze very well. Buy them in season and save them for later. To add a little zing, grate in some fresh ginger.  About 1T per lb of cranberries. Dried ginger probably works too - just haven't tried it.

This was my first time I've made cranberry sauce. Not only was this recipe easy, but everyone loved it. Even my mother in law loved it! I'm usually don't eat cranberry sauce with my turkey, but with this recipe I will.

This is absolutely delicious!  I have never made cranberry sauce before and was hesitant...but now I am going to make it several times again this holiday season!   I split the recipe in half because I only had half a bag. Real quick and easy to make! Thickens up real nicely in the fridge. Thanks Toni for sharing this!

I made 3 bowls for sister and moms table went to the doller store brought a plastic crystal look alike container to put sauce in. this really dressed up table it was very inpressive. cranberries are a sign for harvest. this will be an family Thanksgiving trandition for now on. Never again will I buy canned sauce. NEVER!

Made this for Thanksgiving Dinner. . . Now, my fiance is telling everyone she's only marrying me for my cooking. . .  I especially like the way the orange juice tames the tartness of the cranberries. . .  I did add some cinnamon and my sugar was 1/2 white and 1/2 brown. . . .  It was a hit. . . Thank you very much. . . .

I added some (less then a 1/4 cup) raspberries for a little something different.  I did find it very sweet. But SO flavourful! Next time I'll cut down the sugar, there seems to be plenty in the orange juice!

Ok...I'm a novice...made these and they came out a bit crunchy. Mom took them home and cooked them longer. She couldn't stop raving about them. I changed nothing in the recipe.

Great recipe! I have played around with it as others have suggested... substituting some brown sugar for the white, adding some cinnamon, etc.  It's been good every time.  Perfect addition to the Thanksgiving table!

I loved it.  Sweet an fresh.  I took it to thanksgiving last year.  It wasn't a big hit with the family, they like the canned stuff.  Their complaint was that it was too sweet, so using less sugar could be good for those who like canned cranberry sauce

I don't eat cranberry sauce, but I was asked to bring it to Christmas dinner at a friend's house.  They loved it!  I did add cinnamon and used 1/2 water, 1/2 orange juice.  Everyone said it was a great addition to the Christmas meal!

Very good flavors (with 50/50 OJ and water and 50/50 white and brown sugar), but the consistency was still a bit runny after cooling thoroughly.  I cooked it around 15 minutes.  Will try cooking longer and smashing the berries more next time.

Have made this twice now. First time, made it according to recipe and had a ton of extra liquid even after refrigerating overnight. I had to pour out probably over a cup. The second time, used half white sugar, and half brown sugar like some suggested, cut oj down to 1/3 cup. The sugar draws out the juices when the cranberries are boiling anyway so you don't need to add much liquid. I also added chopped orange rind, and apple hunks. To add some extra tartness, use granny smith, but fuji works too

This was a huge hit! I am planning on making it at Christmas as well. I did do 1/2 cup water and 1/2 orange juice as stated by others. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla, just a dash!! I also thought it was much better the next day so I am making it on Christmas Eve this time! I might try the 1/2 brown and 1/2 white although it was so good with just the white sugar. Might make a batch of both and see which tastes better!

Delicious! I've made it 2 more times since Thanksgiving. I added orange zest the last time. This sauce has many different uses- not only a side for turkey! I mix it with hot water to make a delicious (and healthy) hot drink.
Thanks for the recipe. WIll NEVER buy the canned cranberry sauce EVER in my life.

I'll never buy can cranberry sauce again. I followed the recipe exactly and my only problem was that I used a smaller pot and it did boil over a little and I quickly transfered to a bigger pot.

Because of all the good ratings I made this for Thanksgiving with no alterations. It was too sweet and  too tart at the same time. My 10 guests and I did not care for this recipe!

With only a couple of hours until Thanksgiving dinner I realized I had forgotten something.  The stores were out of cranberry sauce and so I scrambled to find an easy and foo, proof recipe.  I found this one and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it and raved and raved.  They all said we are never eating canned sauce again!  Thank you for the recipe.

Tried a twist on this recipe that went over GREAT at thanksgiving. Added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to get a slight tingle on the tongue without the heat. I've already made a second batch to can.

I will NEVER buy the canned stuff again!!! This was so easy and had an unbelievabley fresh taste. And it took 10 minutes to make. Once you try this, you'll never go back to Ocean Spray.

I will never eat canned cranberries again!  These were great.  The only thing I think I would change though is using water instead of OJ.  To me the OJ added to the cranberries tartness making a conflicting taste of overly tart yet sweet.

This is exceptional cranberry sauce. I was never a fan of whole cranberry sauce either. I have made it several times, but the last time I played around with it a bit. I changed the one cup of sugar to 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and I added a few cinnamon sticks to the pot while it was boiling. Superb!

I made this exactly as written and I, personally, didn't care for it at all.  I thought it had too much orange juice and was kind of bitter.  My husband, however, took it to his office Thanksgiving feast and said everyone loved it.  For our Thanksgiving, I made it with 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and just a tablespoon of orange juice.  I liked it much better this way, but it might have been a tad too sweet.

After making this recipe several times, I simply don't understand why anyone wouldn't make their own sauce.  So easy to make and so much better than store bought.  I have made it exactly like the recipe which is great and I've modified the percentages of orange juice/water and brown/white sugar which gives it a little different flavors.  I've also added a pinch of cinnamon and orange zest.  Whatever I've tried has come out delicious.  Give it a try.

A delightfully delicious recipe! My first time making cranberry sauce, and this recipe was a hit! It was so easy that the sauce pretty much made itself! All I had to do was turn on the heat and throw everything in the pot!

I loved this. I followed some of the suggestions and used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 orange juice. I also added a smidge of cinnamon. I made this right after I popped the Turkey in, let it set up in the fridge, and it was the perfect consistancy in 4 hours.

I never liked the canned stuff so I thought I'd try making it home made this year. This is awesome! I cooked it for a little longer than 10 minutes to be sure that all the berries popped. It thickened up nicely and everyone loved it.

This recipe was so good. I took it to a friend's house where we celebrated Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. (I "somehow" forgot to mention to them how very easy it was to make) I didn't cook it long enough at first. The cranberries were popping, but I think I got nervous and took it off the stove too soon. After sitting a while it was watery and the cranberries didn't looked like they were cooked enough. So, I put it back on the stove and cooked it longer. The cranberries then got really soft and the sauce was red and vibrant, just how I had envisioned it! It was delicious!! This recipe will be a new Tanksgiving tradition!

This recipe was great just the way it is, so simple, everyone raved about it, I did let it simmer a little longer than suggested and left it on the stove to cool down, I have an electric stove, I think it made it a little thicker, as the cranberries were soft, and broken down, the way I like them. Recommended highly.

I usually stay away from cranberry sauce. But I made this for my in laws, and it was a big hit! I even loved! What didnt get eaten with the turkey, the kids decided would be a great topping on vanilla ice cream! This is definately a keeper! I follwed the recipe as directed, but next time I think I will try putting in a cinnamon stick as suggested below.

I made this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving this year, and we just finished our early dinner and it was a hit.  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar, a pinch of cinnamon and the o.j and water.  Delicious.  I will never buy from the can again.

Thanks

So simple but delicious. My 5 year old "made" the craberry sauce with my help this year for Thanksgiving using this recipe. This is the best recipe, and so basic it would be easy to dress it up how ever you'd want. We added 1/4 tsp cinnamon as well. This sauce is also delicious cold used as a jelly on toast.

I took the advice of several of the reviewers and used half white & half brown sugar, half water & half orange juice, and put in a cinnamon stick while it was cooking. I had the same response as so many of you.  My boss and her sister both said they hated cranberry sauce but LOVED this version of it.  I had to work on Christmas that day so we had a potluck sort of dinner.  This was the only dish that was completely gone, and I was cooking for 30!!

Maybe I just don't like cranberries, maybe my fresh cranberries weren't quite ripe enough...but this was just an unsuccessful venture for me.  I was really disappointed considering the rating from others.  But, I definitely will not try this one again.

I had to use fresh-squeezed orange juice as that was all I had; also added some orange zest (maybe 1/2 tsp) and it was good...I hate to admit though I like canned cranberry sauce better as a "fixin" but this is delicious to eat by itself!

A simple and great alternative to the recipe on the back of the bag. I think some of the elaborate cranberry recipes taste better, but this was still very good. Followed recipe exactly and made the day before.

Wonderful!  No reason to ever buy canned cranberry sauce again.  Even some who don't like cranberry sauce ate it.  I did add a dash of cinnamon, half brown and half white sugar, and half orange juice half water.  I let it simmer for 10 minutes or so.  I thought I may want to puree it in the food processor but I'm glad I didn't.  It was perfect how it was.

I really liked the consistency.  A little bit too tart for my taste buds.  Next time I will probably add another 1/4 cup of sugar and maybe some chopped walnuts.

I made this for our early Christmas family dinner and it was great.  The juice I used was a Cranberry, Orange and Rasberry mixture. So much better than the usual cup of water that the recipe on the package usually calls for.

For Thanksgiving, I made this cranberry sauce along with a fancier one in order to satisfy the traditionalists in my family.  This one was so good, I may forget the fancier one in the future!  Sometimes simpler really is better.  Excellent as-is.

Excellent! My guests loved this homemade version. I went with the half & half suggestion on the sugar (brown & white) and orange juice (juice & water) and added a generous sprinkle of cinnamon.

I loved this recipe!  Our daughter is diabetic, so i used all splenda, we didn't have oj, so I put 2 oranges in a food processer to liquify.  It was wonderful.  A little tart, but, we liked that.

I made this for thanksgiving, and it was marvelous.  I'm diabetic, so I used half Splenda, and it still tasted wonderful.  The only change I made was I added some cinnamon.  It was so tangy and wonderful, we all loved it. :)

Ridiculously easy, pretty, and tasty! Will never buy the canned stuff again. Am going to use the leftover as a topping to the Eggnog Cheesecake recipe found here. Very good!

This got RAVE reviews at my Thanksgiving table.  Actually, everyone commented on this more than ANYTHING else I prepared.  I hate cranberry sauce but, of course, I had to try it.  I could barely get it down but it was better than any I had ever tasted!

I made this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving mainly for my boyfriend. He is not a huge fan of cranberry sauce and I refused to try it over the years. However I made this yesterday and it was fabulous! The recipe was quick and simple, which is something I needed for our first Thanksgiving together and when he tried it he just raved how wonderful it was so I had to test it. Fabulous! I will continue to use this recipe, thank you.

I followed the suggestion to use 1/2 c water, 1/2 c o.j., 1/2 c white sugar, and 1/2 c brown sugar.  My husband really liked this as did myself.  He ate his with turkey but I just ate mine by itself.  Plus it was simple!

This was amazing!  I made it along with my turkey feast yesterday and my husband and I LOVED it!  My cousin and his wife stopped by for a plate and they raved over it!  Later on that night, my husband put it over vanilla ice cream and it was incredible!  I followed the others' advice and halved the water and o.j. and the brown sugar and the white as well as added a dash of cinnamon and it was perfect!!!  I will make this again!

I made some of the suggested changes made by other reviewers (1/2 c water 1/2 c oj and 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar), but this was a bit too sweet. I will probably make this again, but will lessen the amount of sugar next time.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is SO EASY.  You just can't beat the simplicity.  The orange juice is a nice twist.  I was going to use the recipe on the bag that called for water and it seemed so boring.  I opened allrecipes, and this was the first  recipe I saw.  It's still just as easy as the recipe on the bag, but the OJ is an awesome touch.    I decided to get a bit creative and added the zest of 1/2 an orange, a splash of rum and a tbsp of brown sugar.  Make it your own, or stick to the bones of this recipe... it would be really hard to go wrong either way!

MMMMMMM smells and looks delicious!!  My sauce is cooling right now and I can already tell it will be a hit!!  I used 3/4 orange juice because I wanted more of that orange taste with 1/4 cup water, half white half brown sugar, and 1/8 tsp cinammon as others have suggested.  I think this is going to be a hit tomorrow!!  I used a potato masher as my sauce was cooking to get all the berries popped and mashed a little, and I like that some are more whole than others.  There was no splattering at all!!  And ten minutes was about the perfect cooking time.  SO EASY!

I do this same thing, but by adding the frozen orange juice concentrate equivalent to the recipe on the cranberry bag. This is soooo good! The orange flavor really compliments the cranberries. I make it every year.

I basically followed the directions.  I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon and about 1 tsp. of minute tapioca to help thicken it.  After it cooled, I did add aliitle orange zest.  Due to the lack of time, I made this two days before Thanksgiving.  I can hardly wait to serve it for Thanksgiving.  I thought it turned out GREAT

2 yrs ago, I was given the mission to bring some homemade dishes for Thanksgiving, and this was one of them.  No one had really tried homemade cranberry sauce, and I really made it for the family since I don't like it myself either.  However, once I made this recipe, I fell in love.  Now I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving ever since then, and everyone loves it!  I never thought cranberry sauce could taste so good!

I read the other reviews and followed their ideas regarding brown sugar and water.  I decreased the oj by 1/4 and white sugar by 1/2 and added 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. water.  It was delicious.  I prepared it X-mas.  I also added madarin oranges and walnuts.  It's an attractive and wonderful tasting dish.  I will not eat can cranberry sauce again.

This was really easy and tasted great!  We've always used the canned stuff which is fine, but this tastes so much better.  Very easy too.  We added some chopped mandarin oranges, but did everything else the same.

Easy to make, tasty, and the deep color was gorgeous. Can be a tad bit tangy, I'd use a bit more sugar--maybe som brown sugar too. I added Orange zest & a touch of Grand Marnier, defintely gave it a bit more orang-y depth. Great  recipe!

I won't buy the canned ever again!  Can't believe how easy this is.  I used all white sugar and the "light" OJ, if I didn't have this version I would certainly dilute it as others did. Mashed them all together with a potato masher while they were still hot...yum!! I can't wait to serve the leftovers on cream cheese as an appetizer - that's a great idea...wish I had read that reveiw before turkey day!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was perfect.  My Mom usually gets the jellied cranberry sauce in the can because she says fresh is too tart, but now she says I have to make the cranberry sauce every year.  She really liked it, and I think the orange juice balances out the tartness of the cranberry.  It's so simple, you should try it.

Very easy to make I really liked it my dad thought the OJ overpowered the cranberries. I think next time I will only use half juice half water.

This is the first time I have made Cranberry Sauce and this was really easy and a nice accompiniment to our Thanksgiving dinner.  I let mine simmer on the stove top for about 30 min and mashed some of the cranberries and it was a nice texture/consistency.

This is such an easy recipe that I thought it must not be as good as a more complicated and ingredient laden recipe but I was wrong!  I made 2 different sauces and this was our family's favorite.  I did add the zest of 1 orange and added the cranberries at the same time as the sugar and juice.  I also made this a couple of days ahead of time (we ate it all before Thanksgiving and I had to make another batch!) and it set up nicely.  Definitely a keeper.

For something as ridiculously easy to make as this is, it sure turned out great.

The tart cranberries break open during cooking allowing the sugar infused OJ to marry with them perfectly.

I made a double batch of this stuff today and will be surprising the fam with it on T-Day tomorrow!

Mmmmm this is the best cranberry sauce!  I LOVE it, so simple, so good!  I just made it (a couple days early) for Thanksgiving and kept having little tastes and it is wonderful!  Last year I made the Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire from this site and I like this so much better, plus it's a lot easier to prepare.  It's just perfect!  I hope it sets up okay in the fridge although I like it more of a sauce consistancy like it is right now.  This is the best, I won't try another cranberry sauce recipe again, maybe tweak this one with a little cinnamon or brown sugar but really, it's great just the way it's written.

Yum!  I generally make cranberry chutney but this year I thought I would try something different and simple.  This is super!  I used orange juice with "lots of pulp" and added approx 1/2t cinnamon. Great!

I used to spend hours making a fresh cranberry-orange relish.  This is even better, and so easy, quick, and delicious!

I personally have never tried the canned cranberry sauce or homemade, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. I thought it was alright but could not see eatin it with my turkey. But everyone else loved it so I assume it was better than the can considering the people in my family always have tons of that left over after thanksgiving.

This turned out awesome!  As suggested by other reviewers I cooked the berries longer (until the mixture was the right consistency) and I also used 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup OJ as well as a mix of white and brown sugar (1 1/2 cups sugar total).  It was a huge hit, even for famile members who do not typically like cranberry sauce.

Excellent Sauce! I did add more sugar (about 1/2 cup) as per other reviews and let it simmer longer too.  I have never made cranberry sauce and didn't know what the consistency should be, so I mashed it w/ my potato masher after it had cooled and thickened a bit and it turned out beautiful!

Yum! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good.  We've always had the canned jelly kind of cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving and no one ever touched it.  But this one went faster than the sweet potato pie! I'll definitely make it again.

This turned out very well.  First time I had tried to make my own.  I used 12 oz. Orange Juice, 1 3/4 cups sugar and 12 oz. bag cranberries.  I brought it to a full boil and stirred it for a full 10 minutes then turned it to low to simmer.  Turned out perfect.  Never knew cranberry sauce could be so easy.

We loved this recipe and how easy it is.  I reduced sugar to only 3 Tablespoon, let it cool alot and then added Equal substitute to our likeness.  This is definitely going to be on our table every year.  Quite tastey!

Everyone loved this at Christmas dinner.  They were so impressed that it was freshly made.  I didn't tell them that it only took 10 minutes to make.  It was so easy and delicious!  Thanks!
