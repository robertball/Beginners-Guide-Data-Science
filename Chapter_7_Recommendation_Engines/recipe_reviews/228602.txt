Meatloaf is a classic dish that's perfect for a hearty weeknight meal.  And, while this was a very simple  version which saves on time and effort in the kitchen due to the pre-made sauce it definitely falls short of expectations in taste.  I followed the recipe exactly, but found the meat mixture to be way too soft to form.  I ended up adding additional panko bread crumbs along with some garlic, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese.  I formed these into four mini meat loaves vs. trying to stuff into muffin pans which worked out better for me.  Due to the size I baked this at 400 for 30-35 minutes in a glass baking dish. I topped with the sauce vs. adding later.  I also spinkled with some  additional grated Parmesan cheese over top and served it with garlic mashed potatoes and peas. Overall, not bad for an Italian-style version of meatloaf but without some tweaking I don't think I would make this again....

Actually thought this was pretty darn good.  I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some of the meatloaf, and instead of muffin tins I did two things:  made 3 mini loaves of meatloaf to freeze, and made some sliders for my son and me to eat tonight.  I loved the flavor that the roasted tomato cooking sauce gave the meatloaf.  I have always used ketchup when mixing meatloaf, so I was really pleased to see this variation.  I used white onion vice green onion.  And, both with the mini meat loaves and the sliders, I put string cheese in the middle - fantastic surprise!  Lastly, I added some additional seasoning to the mix, and instead of mixing the panko crumbs and sauce separately, I just mixed it all together in the same mixing bowl.  Pretty awesome!!

I originally rated these a 3, but after tasting them again, I had to change it to a 2 and change my review...These were ok, but most likely not something I would make again... I also felt that they could use more seasoning, as another reviewer suggested. I used regular onion b/c that's what I had...these smelled wonderful while baking, but just fell short in the flavor/overall taste department, and I felt that all I could taste was the seasonings in the sauce, which I'm not crazy about. They were very moist, so I will say that! I actually liked these better before adding the extra sauce over top. Unfortunately, I think I'm just not a fan of the sauce, period...Sorry, but Thanks for sharing. :)

First off, I must say it could have used a lot more seasoning (we added some more salt, pepper and garlic after first tasting it which greatly improved the overall dish.) My two boys scarfed theirs down (always a good sign.) Might try another cheese next time (this one ended up too hard for my liking) but overall, not too bad.

I made these little meatloves and served them over pasta since I had no potatoes tonight.  I did add more salt & pepper, as well as some basil & oregano.  They were good-I added some crushed tomatoes to the remaining can of recipe starter, seasoned it up a bit and served the sauce over the pasta too.  The sauce was mild right out of the can-a little too mundane for our tastes-additional seasoning was needed.

However, I was unable to find a few of the ingredients, as I think they may be new to our area, but I was able to improvise. I used just the regular Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs instead of the Crispy Panko style and also substituted Ketchup for the Progresso Recipe Starters Tomato Cooking sauce. (for the ketchup, I mixed approximately 1/2 of a cup in the meat and just topped each loaf with ketchup when I served it. The family still loved it and requested an encore presentation!

Let me start by saying this:  my picky 7 year old loved this recipe!  She got a kick out of the individual sized loaves and loved the cheese in the middle.  My husband and I also liked the recipe but thought it was too bland.  Next time I make this (and there will be a next time...I promised my daughter) I'll add more seasoning to the meat and will experiment with different types of cheese to see which flavor works best.

I did not have the specific Progresso cooking sauce BUT I did have a different brand's fire roasted spaghetti sauce. I used that instead. I did throw in a little more italian seasoning and onion/garlic powder into the meat loaf mixture for a little more oomph. The family liked it okay but we all thought this could use more cheese in the middle. This was easy and fed the family very well on a fixed food budget.

This recipe was a huge hit in our home!  My kids loved these mini meat loaves!  It was super easy to make and could be done on a busy evening.  The Progresso Recipe Starters was a great way to add a lot of flavor in no time at all.  This is definitely going in the repeat box!

These were just ok.  After reading all of the reviews and tasting the sauce, I decided to use a half packet of McCormick's Meatloaf seasoning (the whole packet was meant for 2#s of beef), 2/3 cup of diced onion and 1/2 cup of green onions to the mix.  I also chose to use fresh mozzarella in place of the cheese sticks (due to the reviews), 3/4 cup of panko crumbs and 1/4 cup of the progresso sauce with the egg.  It was more than moist.  I then baked it according to the directions.  Like I said, it was ok.  I did enjoy the cheese in the middle, but, really, other than that I found it to be average.  I think ketchup would have been a suitable substitute for the sauce as it was very bland on it's own and required a lot of extra additions.  I won't be making this particular recipe again.

I used this recipe as a base and tweaked it. I add finely chopped green pepper, onion, and garlic to the meat, along with other spices like salt, pepper, oregano. I use 1/2 pasta sauce and 1/2 ketchup, 2 eggs and 2 pounds of beef. It yields about 20 mini-loafs. I freeze what we don't eat and then it is super easy to thaw and re-heat them individually when you are looking for something quick. They always turn out very moist and flavorful!!

I loved the idea of having your own personal lil loaves (we all fight over the ends) but after making it this way I don't like that it cooks in its own grease, I will go back to baking on a rack. As far as flavor, I don't the the progresso starters, it taste like watered down tomatoe sauce and left my lil loaves smooshy. Once you change things up and add more seasonings and omit certain things it just goes back to being your own meatloaf recipe :(

These mini meat loaves are kid friendly.  I served these to my friend's kids and they loved them.  I, on the other hand, thought they were just okay.  The string cheese in the middle doesn't  melt but stays gummy.

I did it exactly how the recipe read and ... it was just ok.  Definately needs more seasoning.  Definately needs less sauce added to the meat mixture before cooking...it was mushy.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce so maybe some other tomato sauce would be better.  I did like the cheese idea though.  Would maybe make again but next time would do things differently.

This was pretty good. I made a couple of substitutions: I used regular bread crumbs, and ground chicken (I don't eat much beef) so I know that changed the end result. I did not have a muffin pan, so formed the loaves into servings and baked on a cookie sheet lined with foil. It was easy to make (I love meat loaf), so I'll make it again, using the panko crumbs and perhaps ground turkey. A nice weeknight meal.

Not bad, but not great. Sauce was a little metallic tasting, but this was a super easy meal. I added some garlic and parmesan, and used lean ground turkey instead of beef.

First let me say...These came out good. It was easy to throw together, very little prep time and dinner was on the table quick! I used cracker crumbs instead of the panko crumbs. I used only half of the sauce in the meat mixture. The Progresso Recipe Starter had a great flavor. I would use this again. I plan to make this again only using more ground beef as the 1lb. called for barely made 10 mini loaves and they were on the small side. I believe that if you upped the ground beef to 2lb. the recipe would work great and the meat wouldn't be so wet and hard to work with! Thank you Progresso for trying to make my life easier!

This recipe made as is doesn't make 12 muffin sized meatloafs as 16ounces of meat won't fill 12 tins full, that's only 1.2 ounces per "cup".. and since we usually do a meat mixture with pork, beef and veal, we made 3 lbs and was able to have 24 decent sized meatloafs (we froze the leftovers for another night, maybe meatball subs?). I was disappointed with the thinness of the sauce, I was expecting sometning thicker like tomato sauce, but the Progresso sauce was more watery with chunks of roasted tomato. I added additional Italian seasoning to the panko crumbs, garlic powder, a bit more pepper than the recipe asked for and omitted the salt to the meat mix. To the sauce to serve over, I added pepper, a dash of Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. We used colby jack and mozzarella cheese in the middle. Husband liked it, the kids were "okay" with it (they're not big meatloaf fans it seems, only like ground meat in burger form I guess!).. I thought it turned out okay after adding all the additional "stuff".

I used more ground beef than called for because I could not figure out how you could fill 12 muffin cups if you only used 1 pound (16 oz.) of meat. I used just over 2 pounds of meat and ended up with 14 which was perfect for us. Based on all the other helpful reviews, I decided to add about a teaspoon of garlic pepper and I used fresh mozzarella instead of the sticks. Unfortunately, even with the additional spice, we felt it was bland. Young kids might enjoy it but my 17 and 19 year old thought it was just okay.

I really wanted to like this recipe because I loved the idea of cooking it in the muffin tin and the "cheese surprise" in the middle.   The flavor fell really short though for my family.   The only flavor that we could taste in the meatloaf was the roasted tomato cooking sauce and it had an acidic taste that was not palate pleasing.  In addition to the flavor the texture was not appealing at all.  It was mushy.  I think the ratio of liquid to meat is off.

OK, but nothing I would rave about or most likely make again.  After mixing all of the ingredients for the meat loaves, it still was way too wet, so I added more panko crumbs.  If I were to make this again, I'd probably use 1/2 cup each cooking sauce and bread crumbs.  While the meat loaves were baking, I cooked down the reserved tomato cooking sauce.  This is the 5th Progresso recipe starter sauce that I've used, and I'm finding that each one is way too thin.  I used a large muffin scoop, inserted a piece of cheese in the center and rolled like a meat ball making 8 meat loves.  Had leftovers, and I'm thinking they'll make good sliders.

I followed the recipe as written, but left in the fridge for a few hours before baking.  These turned out really well for what they are.  I didn't have any issue with the cheese being hard or being mushy.  I would make these again since the kids asked for them.

First of all I subbed yellow onion for the green onion because that is what I had on hand.  Other than that followed the recipe.  These tasted OK but a little more bland than I was expecting since the "recipe starter" had such a stong smell.  Not a bad smell just stong.  I don't think the cheese is really needed here.  In our opinion it did little to nothing to add any flavor.  Pretty much just adds more fat and calories.  Maybe another type of cheese might work well the imparts a stronger flavor to the meatloaves.  The first night we had these we added the extra sauce but the next night we left it off as it just didn't appeal to us.  I won't make these again.  I might make mini meatloaves in a muffin tin though as my five year old enjoyed having his own little loaf.  Also, a recipe using a "recipe starter", I would think would appeal more for a quick, use what's on hand dinner.  I think most cooks using this product probably won't have green onion around as it's usually something one buys occasionally for a certain recipe.  I would recommend changing the ingredient list to a more versatile onion that one is more likely to have on hand and has a stronger flavor.

OH MY GOODNESS I made as written except I topped my meat cakes with a little sauce as they baked. I served with Eggplant Parm topped with progeresso roasted tomato sauce and Broccoli steamed in butter. I am still licking my lips

Made half of recipe with string cheese, remaining with a smoked cheddar. Family loved both! Served with extra sauce on the side. A definite keeper.

My family all really liked this recipe. I didn't have string cheese, and after reading reviews about it not melting, I used cheddar. I also added a little extra s&p and garlic. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef to make 12 mini meat loaves. They needed an extra 15 minutes in the ovento get done to my liking. I thought the fire roasted tomato sauce had good flavor.

I did not have the Progresso sauce either so I used salsa to add some flavor to the beef mixture.  I topped it with thinned out tomato paste.  I will have to try this again because for me, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I thought the cheese would melt, but it just stayed hard in the middle. The fam liked it, but it needs some tweeking.

Very good recipe. I didn't have the roasted tomato sauce, I guess it hasn't reached our stores yet. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for future meals. Instead of the roasted tomato sauce, I used tomato soup and added a packet of sloppy joe mix to a 50/50 mix of ground beef and sausage. My kids gobbled this up, and it will make it into our monthly rotation.

Awesome!  I've made these a couple of times.  I usually use cracker crumbs in place of the bread crumbs.
I also don't use the red sauce for topping.  I mix about 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tbsp mustard and 1 tbsp brown sugar and brush it on top of the loaves before baking.

I'm torn on this recipe. My family really liked but I wasn't a fan. They are definitely moist. I added some garlic, onion powder and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture. And instead of string cheese I diced up some mozzarella cheese and used that. I preferred them without the additional sauce on top. Even with the additional seasoning they weren't quite right. I just didn't really like the flavor of the sauce which really came through. But my guys really liked it.

These were a solid 4-5 with slight modifications. Mr. LTH really enjoyed these.  I thought they were good, but prefer the meatloaf muffin I typically make to these.  I added dried minced onion in place of the green onion, a few shakes of Italian seasoning, and used a mixture of fresh mozzarella with a little shredded cheddar for my cheese.  The mixture was VERY wet (and then very moist).  I halved the recipe for 4 muffins.

With my seasoning alterations a very decent dish!  minced 1/3 white onion with 5 cloves garlic.  Added seasoned salt and extra pepper.  Divided the onion mixture into a 2:1 ratio.  2 parts into the meat, 1 part into the remaining sauce.  Let the sauce simmer while I finished the meatballs.  I read about the goopy mess from the string cheese, so subbed shredded mozzarella and left enough meat mixture along the top to seal over the cheese.  Baked as directed.  Served with herbed rice.  I was shocked how much the kids truly enjoyed this dish.  This may be come part of our rotation!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I didn't have the fire roasted cooking sauce so I just used basil and tomato pasta sauce instead.  Also, I didn't have the sticks of string cheese so I used shredded mozzarella.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat mixture and it had great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good enough that we satisfied with our meal. May or may not make again. I did add some spices to the meat mixture to liven things up.
