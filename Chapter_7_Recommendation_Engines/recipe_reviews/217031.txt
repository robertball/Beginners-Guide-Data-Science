Nutritious and scrumptious! A hearty yet healthy approach to red meat with a hint of oriental flavoring that will satisfy the whole family.

added chopped onions and panko bread crumbs, would be even better if you added some fresh garlic and more soy sauce or even ketchup to the sauce

Delicious! Both my 5 & 2 year olds ate small patties on hamburger buns. I recommend mashing the tofu rather than cutting it into 1/2" blocks if you want even distribution throughout the burger. I used chopped garlic and more of it. I also used only 1/2 # of ground beef and 3/4 of a block of firm tofu. This made 4 med sized and 2 small patties. I sliced the rest of the tofu and let the slices saute in the savory and sweet sauce at the bottom of the skillet for 5 minutes over med heat before flipping. Need to like tofu for that last part though. Thanks, Mariko.

Nice change from the ordinary. I like the combo of beef and tofu...I left out the mushrooms though because it seemed like it would be a bit too heavy for my tastes. I made it with fried noodles and mixed veg with Edamames:) Very good all in all.

I made this last weekend, alongside some asparagus and butter-sauteed radishes as sides.  I had a couple patties that didn't want to stay together, but the recipe came out fantastic.  I would definitely make this again.  Next time I want to include some things like bean sprouts, and other veggies to spice things up.

This was very salty.  The soy sauce over powered any hint of ginger or garlic.

This recipe is great! I served the burgers with a side of white rice and some extra shiitake mushrooms. However, next time I will cut the shiitake mushrooms smaller because if they are too big and not well incorporated into the meat mixture they will fall off when frying the patties.
