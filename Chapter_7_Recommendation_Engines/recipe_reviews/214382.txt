These were really good and easy to prepare.  I used canned chicken breast to make it even easier, and they were still excellent.  I used two big cans of chicken breast, 1 standard-sized container light chive and onion cream cheese (didn't have garlic at my grocery), about 2/3 cup Frank's RedHot, with the 2 T vinegar and salt/pepper to taste.  It filled 15 sheets of phyllo and 5 taco-sized corn tortillas (about 2 T filling in each).  I was making these for a small party, and one of the people there is on a gluten-free diet, which is why I used corn tortillas for some.  I just brushed the outside of the corn tortillas with olive oil, rolled them up, and baked them at the same time and temp as the phyllo-wrapped ones.  They were excellent too - had the texture of a taquito or flauta.  The recipe as-is is very good, but here is one piece of advice if you've never worked with phyllo:  1 T olive oil is not enough!  Pour some olive oil in a bowl and very lightly coat the surface of the phyllo with a pastry brush after you've folded it lengthwise.  I think I used about 1/4 cup total for what I described above.  In the future, I will also add some blue cheese crumbles to the filling.  Also, I made these ahead of time and froze before baking, and they turned out great.

This turned out really well for me. I had a snafu with the phyllo crust and ended up making the second batch as a wrap with lettuce and shredded carrots and added celery and it was good.

These were a huge hit with my family, even the picky eaters. We're all big buffalo chicken fans so, as per my usual recipe, I added butter to the buffalo sauce. Also, instead of adding the cream cheese, I sprinkled pepper jack and colby cheeses inside the wraps, and that turned out to be a really good touch. I am definately going to make this next time I cook for friends.

Once you start, you just can't stop! We used 1/8 less cream cheese than called for, and we used regular chive and onion. We added extra hot sauce and half the vinegar and it was perfect! (We had  the buffalo style Frank's sauce). Made two nights in a row! It was sooo good!

This recipe also works if you want to make as finger size appetizers.  Cut the phyllo into small squares(use at least 2-3 sheets)and line the inside cups of a tart pan.  The one I use has 24 cups and are a little larger than a small Recee cup.  Great for parties and dangerous to eat alone.  You will find you have gobbled up more than you realize when finger size....lol

This is a great way to eat Buffalo chicken with out the mess. I did make a few changes though,I doubled the recipe, added a container of crumbled blue cheese, added 1/2 C chopped celery, used Aloette brand herb cheese, sliced the chicken befor marinating and pre cooking in a skillet. used 2 T vinegar.   I am going to make this again cuing crescent rools as a top and bottom crust pot pie style.

I thought they were a great idea, but wasn't happy with the end result. I did really enjoy the filling and will probably use it on a regular pizza crust next time.

The phyllo sheets were so thin, you mostly tasted the filling.  It was like eating a dip, okay for an appetizer, but not for an entree.   The filling tasted good, I baked some in refrigerated crescent rolls to make a more substantial meal.

My first time cooking with Phyllo! I have to say it was challenging for me but with practice I think I could really make some cool dishes with this dough. Overall this meal was AMAZING. I served my boyfriend and his room-mate and they both absolutely loved how much flavor it had and the Franks wing sauce was just wonderful.  Definitely will make this unique recipe again. If you're tired of the same ol same ol recipes, this one will definitely satiate your craving for something new!!!

These were amazing! They were super easy to make and they were gone very quickly! I forgot to put in the vinegar, but I don't think the taste suffered. I let the chicken marinate a bit extra so I didn't add more than 1/4 cup of hot sauce when making the filling, which was a perfect level of spice for us. I also used 2 phyllo sheets for each so that there was no chance of the filling falling out. I am a little lazy so I just used cooking spray instead of brushing with oil; same result! I will definitely make this again!

These were wonderful - will definitely save this and make them again!  This is my first attempt at working with fyllo/phyllo dough, so that part turned out just OK, but I will hopefully get better with experience.  We like things moderately hot but not fiery hot, so I put only 2 T of hot sauce in the chicken mixture, and it turned out perfect for us.  I also used the chive & onion sour cream because our grocery store didn't have the garlic version.

Yum!! I made a double batch of these for a party thinking that I would have some left over, but they flew off the plate!  These wraps are crunchy, spicy and tangy, and people didn't even seem to need the blue cheese dressing I set out for them.  A real winner - I'll be making these again.

Fairly simple compared to many phyllo recipes.  Used homemade hot pepper sauce and reheated some leftover turkey breast that had already been cooked with the same pepper sauce. Will be making this again and again!

I couldn't find garlic-flavored cream cheese, so I added garlic powder to regular cream cheese and it tasted fine. I had issues with my phyllo dough - it must have been old, because it was all broken when I unrolled it and it stuck to the towel - ugh! (not the fault of the recipe maker, but I thought I'd mention it). As a result, my wraps weren't near as pretty as the ones in the picture (far from it, LOL!!), but the wraps were tasty and my kids loved them. Hopefully next time my phyllo dough will be a little more cooperating.

These are super easy to make and are very inexpensive. They taste delicious. I made them once about two months ago and am making them again for dinner tonight. I go a little easy on the hot sauce and add and extra sheet of phyllo dough per wrap. Makes them perfect!!

If done correctly, these would be GREAT.  I'm an idiot and thought phyllo dough and puff pastry were the same thing, so mine turned out oily and HUGE.  I added blue cheese crumbles and bacon.  Next time I make these (properly) I don't think I'll use the cream cheese and just use blue cheese crumbles.  The two combined were just too rich.

I will try almost any Buffalo Chicken recipe, and I am so glad I made this one.  I could not find garlic flavored cream cheese, so I roasted a clove of garlic and made my own, these were great at this years SuperBowl party.

These were not to my liking.  Love using phyllo dough, but this filling was mushy and didn't taste enough like the hot sauce.  Also, I realize that if you want crispy flaky phyllo you need butter, olive oil doesn't do it.  I had made a double batch to bring to a party but was too embarrassed to bring them.  Now I'm stuck eating these for days.  what a waste of good chicken

These were yummy! I read over the "marinate your chicken in hot sauce" part and it was still good! I added chopped green onions and garlic, and used regular cream cheese. I also folded them more like spanikopitas. Great as an appetizer.

I made these as an appetizer.  I used cooked, canned chicken, then followed the steps starting with after the chicken is cooked.  I subbed jack cheese & blue cheese crumbles for the cream cheese.  Since these were to be appetizers, I used half sheets of phyllo dough, but still folded them in half lengthwise and wrapped according to recipe.  As an appetizer, they were still far from bite size.  We thought these were best still warm and gooey from the oven, but once cooled more, we cut them into bite size pieces.  I will probably make these again, but they won't be at the top of my go-to recipes.

Always my default for hosting a sport event watch party! Super easy to prep the chicken/cream cheese mix in advance, make them in the toaster oven so as not to hear up the house in summer, and forget the phyllo - wonton wrappers (the ones approx. 4" x 4") are so much easier to use, and have a very similar texture! I wrap them up like little cigarillos, perfect for dipping. These are always a hit!
