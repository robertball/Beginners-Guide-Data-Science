I make this all the time using canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  If you go to an international food store, you can get african red pepper. Use a couple of tablespoons if you like it hot.  Also tastes good with chunks of fried beef roast and tripe.

I made this dish a day before I actually served it to my family. All the flavors were able to settle in and really come together. At first I was considering not adding the salt to season with the smoked turkey legs however I added it and I feel it was just the kick the stew needed. My family loved it. My son got seconds my husband took some to work for lunch. I only put in two peppers as I had a three year old to consider and she enjoyed it just fine. Next time I think instead of turkey I will use grilled chicken and shrimp as I don't want to get into the habit of serving a meat that is so  salty.Once you puree everything it smells like a great salsa that you just want to chill and dip chips in however once you heat it up it takes on a different smell. Any meat probably could go with it. You don't need the entire one cup of oil. You could certainly get away with half a cup.  Yummy dish!!! Will make this again. Thanks for posting this great recipe.

I guess i was expecting more from the dish. I made it according to the recipe next time I make this dish I'll have to find ways to modify it to my households liking. Will try it again

Amazing recipe!!!  Made it last night.  The thing I did different was use cut up chicken breast and spicy turkey sausage, and added cilantro to my Jasmin rice.  The sauce stayed the same and It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I shared at work (those who can handle it) loved it too.  Thanx :-)
