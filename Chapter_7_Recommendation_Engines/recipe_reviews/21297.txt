The first time I cooked this recipe, I found it decent but a little bland. On second time I substituted a pound of fresh salmon, poached, for the canned and threw 2 tsps "Old Bay Seasoning" (available in most grocery stores) in the mixture, and found that this worked wonders!

I found the original recipe a little bland and dry, but the ideas this recipe spawned lead me to this.

I substituted fresh salmon that I pulsed in the food processor; (to form small chunks) used fresh bread crumbs along with a couple of tsps of Old Bay.
The cakes I made were thin,(like 6 oz hamburger patties) so the salmon would cook before they browned too much.
I cooked them using half butter and oil.
It imparts a little better flavor then oil alone.
They were extremely moist!!!

I've used two sauces: first, I tried a dill flavored Hollandaise.
Quite nice.
Next, I made a Brown Butter and found the nutty flavor worked great.

These will 'set up' nicely if they are refrigerated for an hour before cooking. A wonderful way to use that bit of left-over barbecued salmon after your fishing trip! Our family of 'picky' seafood eaters...love this one!

OOPs I left out the lemon juice, but it was really GOOD. I will use this recipe from now on, I will try the lemon juice next time. The only other thing I changed is I cooked it in olive oil cooking spray. Not the Great buttery flavor, but a small sacrifice for low calorie/fat. Thank You for sharing. rhkatz3

Had to increase to 12 servings for my large family but went over VERY well.  I had to limit the children or all else would have been forgotten save the salmon cakes!  I fried in Olive oil and the flavor was great.  I also mixed it all in the processor and saved another dirty dish, adding salmon at the very last and pulsing only a bit.  Definitely a new family standard.

Ok running through this recipe it's a very delicate balance between dry and liquid ingredients that can be thrown off by a number of things.  They type of salmon, the size of eggs, butter vs margerine, dry herbs vs fresh herbs, fresh bread crumbs vs dry bread crumbs, even the size of bread crumbs and chopped herbs. Here's what I did.  Using 3 small cans of boneless, skinless sockeye salmon undrained, adding all 2 cups of dry bread crumbs(didn't bread them), 2 large eggs, 1 tsp dried dillweed, 1tbl dried parsley, 1tbl dried onion powder, 1tbl lemon juice, 3 tbl margerine. Really work these into a patty. I browned them in a frying pan. When you drop it in the pan push it around alot so they don't stick even with oil in the pan.  I finished them off in the oven on parchment paper for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  My 2.5 yr old ate these and enjoyed it. Next time I will try some sort of dill sauce for them for the adults.

Excellent recipe.  I only used half the dill as others suggested and it's good advice.  You taste the dill but it's not overpowering.  Makes a light, healthy, and satisfying meal.

I just made this recipe and found the mix DRY, DRY, DRY (even with 1 cup bread crumbs instead of 1-1/2 cup -- from my cooking experience, I was suspicious of more crumbs than salmon!). I added a half cup of water to try to moisten it, but still couldn't get the cakes to stick together enough to bread them -- had to skip that step and fry them as is. They tasted great, but they weren't really cakes. I notice the recipe calls for "fresh bread crumbs" -- what are these exactly? If I try to crumble a fresh piece of bread (i.e., rub it between my fingers), I get dough, not crumbs. I had used dry bread crumbs, is this the problem?

This recipe is better suited as an appetizer rather than a main dish.  I found that even though I used room temperature butter (called for 2 tablespoons) it did not mix well throughout.  Coupled with a creamy dill sauce this recipe can be a great prelude to your favorite dish.

This is a good, basic salmon cake. You can use crushed saltine crackers or chips for the fresh breadcrumbs. If you use dry dill, (which isn't a sin, by the way) make sure you half the amount. Dried herbs are about twice as strong as fresh herbs. I like to add some lemon zest and some minced, fresh garlic and onion to my salmon mixture. The green onions are a great idea! If your cakes aren't coming together nicely, add mayonnaise - low fat, of course! That is really delicious in a salmon cake! Please refrigerate your patties for one hour before cooking. Otherwise you will be prone to having your cakes crumble in the skillet.  These things are just delicious, especially served with ketchup, vegetables, and brown rice!

I made this dish yesterday and it came out tasting great! However, I did not bake it... I cooked them in a pan with some vegetable oil until they were browned on each side.

This recipe was great and easy!  I didnt have green onion so I used white and leftover blackened salmon instead of canned.  I believe that added a lot to the flavor!  They were gone in seconds!  Great served with mayo/mustard and thyme or whatever seasonings you like!

I love this recipe! The flavor was subtle (but good), and it definitely benefits from a sauce or dressing (I used a curried yogurt, and some lemon-basil dressing.)  I found that the non-salmon ingredients got all clumped up before mixing the salmon in, so next time I'll mix the dry ingredients, then add the salmon and eggs last so it gets distributed better.  Also, I added a lot more oil to the butter for frying it.

A really nice way to use leftover salmon. The salmon we get to bbq is always too much for us to eat, so this is a perfect way to eat those great leftovers.

Great served with a sauce made up of 1 tsp. melted butter, 1 c sour cream, 1 cuc, seeded and sliced thin, 1/4 drained capers-mix 'till heated through, then dill stirred in to taste (1 T dried).  Make these in mini muffin tins for a easy and unusual appetizer.

These patties were very crumbly and wouldn't stay put together while cooking them. Also, I would use oil in the pan instead of butter. I found a different recipe for salmon cakes and will use it instead of this one the next time I make them.

Doubled the recipe for two cans and then doubled the hot sauce for more zing -- it wasn't. I thought it was a little bland, but DH and my 9yo son liked them.

Great recipe.  I do substitute fresh salmon and serve with a spicy masago sauce.  Always a favorite.  It is a great recipe for leftover salmon that can be mixed with canned salmon.

Pretty good - not too dry. A little too much bread taste for me. I would add a couple of fresh ingredients next time - like finely cut celery.

Very tasty... Used crushed saltine crackers in place of bread crumbs. My advice: Use as much egg as you need to moisten them up and be gentle in turning them to avoid breakage.

It turned out more like Salmon Hash than cakes, but it was still very good. Maybe more salmon to balance out the bread crumb mixture.

I used this recipe tonight for dinner (for two), and it was delish!! I used some fresh cooked salmon I had left from dinner the other night, which worked perfectly.
I will definitely make this one again!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight

I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular

When it came to getting the salmon cakes ready to go in the pan, I used a 3rd egg, beat it then dipped the cakes in the egg and then coated them with breadcrumbs on both sides

They came out super crispy and very moist

I served with a generous dollop of mayonnaise and about a quarter cup of salsa - these helped pump up the flavour!!

I would like to attach a photo but I'm not allowing Google to access my photos - these were delicious and I will definitely make them again!!!!!

I agree that the basic recipe is dry, but if you don't drain the can of salmon it holds together really nicely and the measurements don't have to be altered. I added sharp cheddar cheese to my mix for some additional flavor and the cheese browns really nicely in the pan.

I think the changes I made messed me up! Too many dry ingredients to wet ingredients= crumbly dry salmon cakes! They still taste ok, but next time I will stick to the recipe. I also didn't have a 14.75 oz can of salmon, but I had two 6 oz cans, so there was a problem from the start. But the taste is good and I would try them again.

I doubled this recipe for the family and they all loved it. I didn't change a thing, but I did add a small dollop of Cream Dill Sauce, which is also on this site.

If you fry them in oil, they stay moist and don't really need the sauce at all.

Used leftover baked salmon.  It Very tasty but too dry to form cakes that retained their form.  We ended up having "salmon cake scramble".  Next time we try it I'll try four eggs instead of two.

I tried this recipe for dinner tonite; while mixing, I found it a little bland. I added garlic powder, seasoned salt and a dash of cayenne. It was a little dry while making the patties, so next time I will add a little mayo and the juice form the salmon to help bind it while frying. After all of that, they were delicious!

No angry faces, please.  Yeah, I changed; but wanna keep this (GH) recipe, meaning the one following, as a reference: Salmon; 3 slices bread, almost minced; 3eggs, 1/2t salt; 1/4t pepper; 1/4t dill.Next time, will add green onions, more dill (increase to 1/2t), one less piece bread, maybe one less egg, too (meaning using 2).  It's a decent fast dinner - especially if that's all there is.  Gonna try with tuna sometime. 2/13 12oz tuna, 1/4t + 1/8t dill, 2eggs, green onions, 3 endpieces bread (thin).  Too much dill for tuna.  Even with less, think I'll pass.  Almost liked it with salmon.  :/  :)

This is a good classic recipe. Great as is, or substitute Panko (fine breadcrumbs.)  With a single batch, I tried both frying and baking, sprayed  with Pam, and my family could not tell the difference.  I'll bake them next time.

The taste was moderately good (didn't knock my socks off but okay). But the patties were extremely dry. In fact, I had a hard time holding them together just going from the plate of bread crumbs to the frying pan. Also, needed more oil/butter than called for - they really soaked it up. 

I think this recipe could benefit from adding a little milk to the mixure. Two eggs and a little lemon juice are not enough moisture for this much dry ingredients. Also didn't need so many bread crumbs in the plate for coating, I threw half of it away. 

Needs work.

These weren't great.  I had to add 4 eggs just to get it to stick together and then it just tasted way too bready.  My husband really liked them, though.

I really enjoyed these.  They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  An easy way to eat fish without it tasting really fishy.GREAT!!

Easy to prepare and delicious, but they definitely need a dressing/sauce of some kind. I think I will look up the tartare sauce others have mentioned. Oh, I used dried parsley and dill, and they were fine. This is a great recipe when canned salmon is going cheap at the store!

This is a good base recipe to incorporate your own personal preferences into. First I used all 2 C of fresh breadcrumbs to mix in, then omitted onion and other spices listed and used an  Italian blend of dried green herbs, salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste, drained and flaked canned salmon, 2 med. eggs, 1/4 C mayo with a tsp. of yellow mustard added in, a pinch of sugar, and also used the tsp. of lemon juice as suggested. It all mixed and held together well. Next I shaped the patties and coated the outside with Italian style breadcrumbs. After that, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes to become firm. Lastly they went into the frying pan in vegetable oil at medium temperature for 3 minutes on each side. I prefer tartar sauce by the way and made some up quickly to serve with this dish. The salmon cakes were well received.

Followed recipe as written..maybe I don't get it, but the taste was extremely bland, and cakes were very bready.  I used Progresso very fine granuled bread crumbs...that may have the mistake; may come out better using a larger crumb.

This recipe is great.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to add some cayenne pepper to spice them up a bit.  Also, when all ingredients were mixed it seemed a bit dry so I added 1 more egg and they turned out perfectly!!

Bf wanted salmon cakes and told me he originally found a salmon cake on here, so I went looking for him.  We had to go through a few recipes before he said he thought this was the one.  He said he'd always used Saltines, though, so I'm not convinced it's the same.  Regardless, he used half Saltines and half bread crumbs.  These were a bit dry and needed another egg.  He doesn't use onions, so he left them out.  I'm sure he'll make these again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not the greatest, but they were good.  I didn't have any lemon juice so I used milk, and after reading some feedback I leftout some breadcrumbs, but it was still a little dry.  Cooked in oil instead of butter, and they browned alot better then the first two I cooked in butter.

It was a good starting place for me. But it was horribly dry, had to add 2 more eggs just to get the mixture to hold together. Will try it again and just start with 1/2 cup bread crumbs and see how that goes

Made this with fresh salmon scraps and cut way back on the crumbs to make it Atkins friendly......looked very goopy but could form a ball.crumbed outside with panko. Fried in cast iron pan with 1/2 butter and olive oil ....came out so crispy and delicious.It made 6 very thick cakes. less really is more.I used to put too much in my cakes...these were simple and delicious.

I did not enjoy this recipe. I only used a half cup of breadcrumbs and it was still bland. I added old bay as suggested, but maybe not enough. I've made salmon burgers with 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs and you can still taste the salmon. Here, the flavor was hidden. However, I wasn't pleased with the overall flavor, so I wouldn't make it again.

I love the fresh herbs and lemon juice in these.  I think that the contributor probably meant the recipe to be made with fresh, not dried, bread crumbs so I used those.  That way they were not too dry and held together.    Later I went completely off the reservation and made them eliminating  all the seasonings except onions, and added a Tbsp. of dill pickle relish and a generous pinch of yellow mustard powder, and it was good that way, too.

Easy is right.  The suggestion to cool the patties in the fridge for an hour was a good idea - helped the patties hold together well.  I used some leftover salmon, and the only change was to add a bit of cayenne pepper, and I didn't bother placing the patties in more bread crumbs prior to frying. Will make again

We just had it for dinner.  I had to use sweet onion chopped finely and cooked it in microwave for 30 seconds; also dipped the patties in panko bread crumbs.  Otherwise, went by the rest of the directions.

5 stars for deliciousness.  I feel the batch needs to dry out a bit and one may need a burger molder to get the patty into shape.   Also, coconut oil is great for sauteing, frying and cooking.  I used that instead of butter, which i had.   I added pink himalayan salt and a nice little bit of garlic powder to the mix. Lastly, I did 2/3rds bread crumbs and 1/3rd quinoa to mix in some extra healthiness.

I will definitely make this again.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and rolled the salmon cake in panko breadcrumbs before frying.  Turned out great.

I made this as described but when I saw  the amount bread crumbs that would be set aside for the coating, I didn't think they'd be enough. I used regular boxed dry crumbs instead. This worked out great. I added butter to olive oil to fry them.  The recipe did not call for salt but after tasting them, 
I'd recommend it.  My son's said they were "okay" but I thought they were delicious.  Oh yes, and I used fresh salmon instead of canned.

This was really good. The only thing I added was sea salt. It was a bit bland like most reviewers said so when I added the salt, it turned out fantastic!

This is simple, quick, easy, tasty, and good cold, too. I made it from left over barbequed salmon.

This was just okay. The Dill sauce on this site from Lisa helped...but i'd catagorize this under cheap and fast, and edible.

Excellent recipe.  Flavor and texture are great.  My husband raved about them and wanted to finish the whole batch in one sitting!  I did cut the dill to 1 tsp. as suggested by other reviewers.  Many thanks.
