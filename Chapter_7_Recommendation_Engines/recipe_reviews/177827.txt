The first time I made this, I followed the instructions and it was OKAY. The second time, instead of baking the salmon with the olive oil and using the citrus/balsamic mixture as a sauce I used it as a marinade and then baked the salmon and it was DELICIOUS :) Note- if using the sauce as marinade, omit the cornstarch, and use equal amounts OJ, brown sugar and balsamic vinegar. All in all for the original recipe I think... Ingredients: good! Instructions: bad!

I have made this recipe once and my boyfriend has also made it! It's a delicious mix of citrus and balsamic, and was the perfect topping for our salmon. We served the salmon with jasmine rice and the sauce was delicious on the rice as well!

We prefer our salmon pan seared so I am reviewing the sauce portion only. We loved it!! So very fresh and flavourful. I made no changes and I can't think of a single thing that would improve it. This would also be great on chicken or duck.

Served with brown rice and broccoli.  Very good!  No changes.
