I used vegetable oil instead of canola. It was good to me, but my son said it should have been sweeter. Maybe next time I add 1/4 cup of extra sugar.

I followed some of the reviews and did 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa, and another 1/2 cup of sugar.  The icing was thin for me so added another cup of confectioners sugar and a pinch of salt.  My daughter wanted chocolate flakes on top, so that’s what we did and yum!!

I followed the cake to the T.. However I switched up the cream cheese frosting a tad.. I used 1/2 cup butter, 2 bars cream cheese, 2 cups confectionery sugar, 1  1/2 tsp vanilla and half cup heavy cream.. Made the frosting fluffy yet not overwhelming sweet!!!

This one turns out every time. My husbands traditional birthday cake.
I do use a red velvet suspension for the flavoring and color though.

Good, but I wouldn't say exceptional.  I used close to 1/4 cup cocoa given another reviewer's remarks that some flavor seemed to be missing, and a pinch of salt.  Still seemed to be missing something that would make it a great recipe.

I made a wedding cake and it came out good enough that 2 people who don't eat cake ate a whole slice...this is what I changed. I swapped the buttermilk for sour cream (equal parts) I colored the cocoa powder red prior to mixing it into the batter to ensure proper color was reached. Finally I added the vinegar and baking soda at the very end then pour into pan (s) and let sit for 5 min before baking

I only used two 8 inch pans and it was perfect. It was wonderful, moist and very pretty for the Christmas luncheon I made it for.

I made this for my husband's birthday.... The recipe is so odd. The cake has almost no flavor and the icing is insanely sweet. It definitely looks impressive but flavour wise is a big miss.

Something is missing, and/or something needs to be reduced. It tastes like oil to me.

Made this for a friend's birthday....and it turned out wonderfully.  I used 3 8" pans....and doubled the frosting (because I always find I run out too quickly).  The frosting was not super sweet....had a nice cream cheese taste.  I did use Wilton red cake colors...instead of the food coloring.  Gave it a beautiful red color.  Definitely making this again!

I made this for my niece’s birthday.  I used two 9” pans (bake an extra 10 minutes) and cut it into a total of four layers.  FREEZE the cake over night in order to cut layers. Also, DOUBLE the icing recipe, which is the best part! I took another reviewer’s advice and added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, and it turned out perfect! I will use this recipe again.

This is a delicious recipe!  Not too sweet, not too rich!  That is a definite turn off for me.  Every one at Christmas dinner raved about it!

Icing was amazing! The cake was good, but like other reviewers, something was missing.  Cake was not quite sweet enough.  Next time I'll add more sugar and try cake flour instead of all purpose.  I'll probably add more vanilla as well.

I made this for my son's birthday. What we loved about it was the moist cake and the icing which was not too sweet. I saw other reviews that did not think it was sweet enough, but we do not like icky sweet and this fit the bill.

My husband said that he thinks this is the best cake he has ever had. That is saying a lot!

Me and my daughter made this recipe today and it was okay. It taste like its missing something. The icing is delicious but the cake recipe isn't all the way right. But it's close.
