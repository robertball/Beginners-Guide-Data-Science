I loved it!!!  It was easy to prepare from ingredients I already had on hand.  I added a little extra spice since I added some black beans to it.  Sprinkle some mexican cheese on top when served...yummy!!!!

Great in its simplicity, just as it is! Any cut of cubed, browned pork works well, and with a little queso fresco on top of your bowl of soup and a slice of warm cornbread (our not so mexican contribution!) this is a good cold weather meal.

Excellent!!  I used pork chops instead of ribs, that was what I had on hand.  Still excellent!!  I served with Queso Fresco, lemon wedges, sour cream, chopped cilantro, chopped green onions and tortillas.  Great meal just like in Mexico!!

Wow!  Was this soup good!  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband likes a lot of veggies, so he added peas and Lima beans to his.  But I absolutely loved this soup as is.  Best the second day, but after that the tastes are a little too mingled.

This recipe is awesome, but instead of using beef broth I used two cans of diced tomatoes and used two buillon chicken cubes. I also used two cans of pinto beans.

I wasn't completely sold on this after it got done cooking, so I did have to doctor it after the fact. But I think most people would find this amount of spice agreeable -- we just like a lot more spices. I did use cubed boneless pork chops in place of the spareribs (and was able to skip the chilling & fat-skimming steps because of that) but I don't think spare ribs would have added to my enjoyment, since I don't like them anyway. I really liked cooking the cilantro in the soup -- I probably used more than 1/4 cup but whatever I did, it really permeated the broth, which was nice. Thank you for sharing your recipe, I'm pretty sure I'll use this again. (This made 9.5 cups of soup for me.)

We had about 4 pounds of spareribs to use up.  I followed the recipe all the way up to the cilantro because I didn't have any around.  We still simmered the mixture for the full 90 minutes despite that our spareribs were already cooked.  I added the beans later instead of cooking them for 60 minutes, then cooking the rest of the mixture for another 90 minutes.  We added the beans with another 30 minutes to go on the mixture and it tasted fine.  We topped everything with homemade cornbread, salsa, queso fresco and sour cream.

I used ham and a lot more cilantro than the recipe called for but only due to personal preference. This was a very satisfying soup but I do think toppers are a must to bring out all of the flavors. I might even try some lime next time.

Yum! I love experimenting with new recipes, and this is one of the best ever. I used pork chops, which I browned and boned, then added to soup. We topped our soup bowls with sour cream, diced tomatoes, grated cheese, and cilantro. Wonderfully satisfying!

FABULOUS soup!   The only change was using  Pork Loin Back Ribs instead of spareribs.

The picture associated with this recipe is very misleading!! There’s nothing red in this soup! The only green is the 1/4 teaspoon of cilantro! The cilantro gets added into the cooking of the soup so there’s no green showing either. However, the soup is delicious! Just not pretty! If I made it again I’d added more veggies and probably use a pork roast or similar meat, picking off the ribs is very time consuming. I gave it four stars mainly because of eye appeal!

This was very yummy. I doubled the recipe but did everything else as written, only added a bit more salt. Very enjoyable, thanks!
