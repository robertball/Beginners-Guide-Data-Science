I used sugar free strawberry extract without any berries to make this dip.  It was really easy to make and I served it as a fruit dip for apples, grapes, strawberries, and cherries.  Everyone loved it and no one realized how few carbs it had until I told them it was made with Splenda.

This was a good fruit dip, and very easy to make.  You may want to taste before putting in the fridge to be sure the raspberry flavor is prominent enough.  I  added just a little more to deepen that flavor.  I also added a little red food coloring to make it more eye appealing.

I made this last night as part of my appetizer spread for Valentine's Day. It was so simple to make and delicious. It was like a dessert in itself. I served it with strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and apples. I will definitely be making this again.
