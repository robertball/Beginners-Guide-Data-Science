These turned out really crispy and quite nice. The carrots were fun but be aware that they do not crisp up. They get a nice brown on them but all of the sugar in them keeps them soggy. The taste reminded me a lot of sweet potato fries but you just don't get that texture. I'll definitely make these again but I probably wouldn't hassle with the carrots again.
