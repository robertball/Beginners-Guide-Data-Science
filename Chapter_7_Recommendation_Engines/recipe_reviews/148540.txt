This was GREAT! I doubled the spices, since we like things hot, and used brown rice. Served with some toasted rye croutons and a tiny wedge of chili-lime gouda for garnish. Raves from my guests!

This soup is incredible! Fresh, healthy, tasty ingredients...what else could you ask for?!? This reminds me of a soup I used to be able to get at a small sandwich cafe in DC...but they stopped offering it. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Also, I don't understand why anyone would complain about this soup being too "hot," when it clearly states that it is a spicy soup. Things that make you go, "Hmmm." YUM YUM YUM!!!

Very good! I was a little skeptical about using rice as a thickener, but it worked beautifully. This is also a great recipe for using up any extra veggies that are hanging around the fridge. I garnished this with shrimp and peppers, very pretty. Thanks!

I followed this recipe because I had 2 pounds of small red and yellow peppers that I needed to use. This recipe came out great. I also used 4 carrots and skipped the celery.  I also added about 12 ounces of mushrooms. I did not puree the soup. This was an excellent soup to serve on a hot summer afternoon.

I really enjoyed making this soup!  Pretty alright as-is, nice flavors, but it's missing something (I don't know what! But I've been trying to figure it out all day.).  Helpful additions were: lime and lemon juice, extra garlic powder, and dried basil - t hese additions made it a lot better for me.  But it's still missing something I can't quite put my finger on.  I think some shredded chicken, corn, or beans might help the flavor.  Thanks for the  recipe, it's nice to find one using fresh bell pepper.

Ok I did alter the final dish, but made the recipe as is, for a wonderful base. I turned this in to a seafood soup. At the end I added shrimp, scallops & crab. It just seemed natural! So good! The flavors were restaurant quality.

I chose this recipe over some other pepper soup recipes because it didn't use a cream base.  For those who are watching their weight, this recipe delivers the flavor without the fat and calories.  Very good and a great way to use that summer bounty of peppers.  This is also a convenient recipe for not requiring roasting the peppers.

Delicious! Great soup recipe, and fantastically easy! It blends up really nice and is nice and spicy. I will give it five stars, but I did have to alter it slightly to fit the ingredients I had. First, I halved the recipe, which still made lots of soup. I also used two (small) red peppers and two (small) yellow peppers. Next time I will make sure to make it with only red peppers, though the yellow peppers taste nice, the soup turns out mostly yellow. I also didn’t have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder in their stead. I also substituted chilli powder for the cayenne pepper, and it doesn’t overpower the soup either. Thanks!

Great soup.  I was a little disappointed that more of the sweet red bell pepper flavor did not come through, but this was partly my fault.  The soup tasted strongly of thyme, which is not bad, but it overwhelmed the other flavors.  The mistake made (I think): I had no fresh thyme in my garden and in trying to be cost-effective, I used ground thyme.  Seeing as dried spices are usually much stronger, I probably should have halved this.  I liked the soup enough that I will try it again and modify.  And to temper the heat, I used just a dash of cayenne and red pepper flakes.  It was still hot, but enjoyably so.  Other modifications: I used some oregano and celery salt to round out the flavor a little after I discovered it tasted so strongly of thyme.

This soup is called "spicy" in the title, and several reviewers complained that it was too spicy. I made this recipe per the instructions...and was underwhelmed. There was no heat, to my taste buds, which meant that to my husband's taste buds, it was going to taste like I was serving him a big bowl of "Bland Stuff I Hate Soup". So I added pre-cooked plain chicken, shredded (because I had planned to anyway), and many generous spoonfuls of Sriracha (Asian-style hot sauce). It was still missing something, so I added lemon juice until it seemed...bright. (No, I can't really explain "bright taste" any better.) I pureed this soup with my immersion blender, because my husband-who-loves-things-spicy is also a guy-who-hates-cooked-vegetable-textures. Overall, we ate it, and will finish the pot over the next day or so, but I probably wouldn't make this again unless I had a lot of bell peppers to use up! Thanks for the recipe though, I really enjoyed making this one :) (P.S. If you want to use brown rice, just bring the soup to a boil after you add it, then turn it down to low and cook for the amount of time specified on your brand of rice's package--or about 15 minutes less if you're going to puree the soup.)

I was in a hurry so I used the food processor and chopped each vegetable.  When I got to the point of cooling the soup in order to blend it, we were all starved so we ate it as-is.  It was fantastic.  I loved the flavor combination.  I will definitely save this as a recipe for when we have guests!

This soup tasted good, but I had to make a couple of deviations from the recipe: I didn't have rice, so I used orzo; I didn't have celery, so I left it out.  I would make it again, following the recipe but possibly using bacon drippings instead of just EVOO for more flavor.

I felt this soup was lacking some flavor.  Added more salt, but that wasn't it exactly.  Definitely spicy, but we enjoyed the heat.  I don't think i'd make this again.

This was extremely spicy & hot. I like a little spice but this blew out my mouth even though I cut the spice in 1/2. Make at your own risk.

This soup is quite good as is, but it does need a little something to round out the flavor. I added a tiny bit of sugar, and that helped a little. Next time I will try adding extra carrot or perhaps throwing in some tomato. The level of heat was just right for me, but I can see how some people might find it too spicy. I always substitute vegetable broth for chicken, by the way.

So Good!!!! Used leftover brown rice so I didn't have to cook as long.  Served with Kentucky biscuits and a green salad, made for a nice light dinner.

Yum! I used leftover quinoa instead of rice and blended it all in a food processor. I'm going to serve it with cooked shrimp and topped with fresh avocado and make up some corn tortilla quesadillas for along side.

YUM! I had bell peppers to use up and I did not use all red ones.  (I had extra yellow and green, just what I had left) The soup wasn't that pretty red as the pic, but It tasted FABULOUS!  I also kicked up the spices because I love HOT stuff.  mmmm, Will definately make this healthy soup again.

Good - I would make it again. Loved the fact that the rice gave it a creamy texture. I added dried thyme as it was cooking and a small amount of fresh thyme right before serving.

I have made this several times now. Full disclosure: I have altered the recipe based on a review that felt it lacked something; it was good, but flat. Looking at the ingredients, I felt it probably needed a little sour/acid what with all the sweet going on, so I added a lemon slice with the broth (removing it prior to blending!) and reasoned that if the peppers were fresh, why not add a fresh hot pepper, serrano, instead of the cayenne and red pepper flakes. Additionally,  because I didn't have any fresh or dried thyme, I added some mint.  I am really liking this soup, you should try it!

i have to say, i followed this recipe pretty closely.  i did not have fresh thyme, so just added dried.  i used the indian chili powder i have on hand instead of the red pepper flakes.  this came out very, very good.  full bodied due to the rice (used brown), and nice and spicy.  served with some crumbled feta. other reviewers have stated there is something missing, i too have had that problem.  i simmered this all for a good 45 mins or more after sweating the veggies.  maybe that helped?  or it could be the peppers themselves.  cooking is one big experiment, that's why it is so fun!  either way, enjoy!  and thanks for the post QUIRKYIQ!

This was pretty good. I love the flavor of the peppers and the hint of spice, but it was missing something. The consistency was perfect- very creamy. I recommend topping with crusty, garlic croutons or serving with a warm roll for dipping.

The soup as prepared by recipe was very good--worth the five stars.   I had some cooked ham to use up, and after the soup was done, I added nearly a pound of chopped ham and let it all simmer for a while.  It was awfully good that way, as well, and I expect it to be even better tomorrow. I recommend about double the cayenne, and a bit more garlic---powder is alright. I also added about 1/2 cup of condensed milk, because I really like the creamy color that it adds. I do that frequently. Keeper recipe!  Lotsa fun.

I am always looking for recipes that use healthy alternatives.  Using rice to thicken the soup worked perfectly and I will be using this trick in other recipes as well.  I used brown rice and beef stock instead of chicken.  Also I served it with a dollop of plain yogurt and it added a great cool flavor against the spicy flavor.  I will make this again.

This is a delicious, light soup before blending and is great with a variety of veggies. When I opt for the blended version, I sub one can of chicken broth for low-sodium tomato soup. It makes for a creamy soup that warms the heart! It freezes well too.

I halved the recipe and it turned out really good.  My husband rated it 5 stars.  We sprinkled some garlic croutons in the soup. I added a knorr chicken bullion cube for more flavor, but everything else I followed the recipe.  It had a nice spice but didn't blow your taste buds.  An easy and tasty healthy meal.

What a great use of red peppers. I grow peppers in my garden and get more than I can use and I didn't know of anything other than stuffed peppers to do with the overabundance of the harvest. I love soups and decided to give this a try. I prepared it as per the directions, but since I chopped the peppers into very fine pieces, I did not see a need to blend the soups as the texture was perfect.. I plan to make more and freeze it for winter  enjoyment

Great soup!  Not overly spicy.  I halved the amt of thyme cause I was using dried and used fresh ground pepper - didn't measure it.  I might reduce the cayenne pepper by half next time when I serve my hubby. We like spicy food but aren't used to the flavor of cayenne.  Will definitely be making it again!

Very tasty.  I omitted the rice so my soup was more like broth-y.  I added a jalapeño as well.  Will make again.

Wasn't very good. Taste was quite bland. I added more garlic, more spices, a lot of salt and still seemed like it was missing something. Added feta cheese to make it more tasty. Added chicken as well.

My husband and I really enjoyed it.   I added a jalapeno because we had some to use up.  We thought it was hot but not too hot.  It was a great way to use up the bountiful pepper harvest we have this year.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I gave it four stars, because , like many of the others that have reviewed this soup, I had to slightly tweek it. I substituted quinoa for the white rice. After simmering for the directed 25 minutes, I added a dash of cumin and chili powder based on how it smelled. Before blending, I also added a few teaspoons on lemon juice as recommended by several other reviews. I do not like celery, so that was cut. Overall, the spice was perfect and the consistency was surprisingly creamy (given there is no dairy). I think this would actually be great with a grilled cheese instead of tomato soup.

We like things hot and this was very good.  I even snuck in a couple jalapeno peppers to heat it up.  At first I thought it was too thin, but the rice did a good job of thickening it up.

We love this soup, l have made it several times with yellow, red ,and orange peppers as variations. We prefer yellow, as it gives it a sweeter touch, and add more of the spices to create a nice fusion. 
Have used both vegetable, and chicken broth. Prefer chicken as the recipe calls for, but vegetable works great as well. So it's easy to convert it to a vegetarian soup.

I love this recipe for its simplicity and exceptional taste!!  I have been making this recipe for quite some time now. Usually twice a month during the winter.  I never count out my veggies exactly. I often dont use fresh thyme.  I use what is starting to wilt in my crisper and go from there.  Its a hearty soup.  Costco sells Wisp parmesan crisps.  I add them on top of the soup.  wait till they melt a bit and enjoy. The crisps make it heartier. I have never given a review before...this recipe is worth trying. Perfect for my lunch once school starts again.

I feel my 3 star rating is very generous because of everything i kept having to do in order to make it taste right to me.. i cut the recipe in half.. i already knew i wasn't a big fan of thyme so i used basil instead.. and no i don't think it would have came out tasting 5 stars if i actually had used the thyme.. instead of all the cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and black pepper i just used one serrano pepper.. i added about 1/2 lb of chicken breast that i sauteed in a pan with some season salt.. i should have stopped there.. but ended up adding in 1/4 c of yogurt.. it still tastes pretty decent.. but i think it tasted better before the yogurt.. can't say i didn't try

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first (...bell pepper soup...?)but I thought I'd try it since I had an abundance of peppers (red, yellow, orange) to use up. I loved it. I'll definitely make it again and pass the recipe on to others. I didn't have 6 peppers so I just eye-balled the recipe, used all of the ingredients, and it turned out just great! Very tasty!
