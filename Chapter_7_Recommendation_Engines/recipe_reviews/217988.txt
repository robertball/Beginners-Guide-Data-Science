This was SO fast and easy! I cheated and used a bag (750g) of mediterannian veggies that were already chopped and ready to go only taking the time to add an onion (as everything else was already in the mix). I also added a few more spices for personal preference, and used less chicken broth (I like the sauce thicker). I also didnt have bread crumbs so I crushed crutons in a ziplock bag and used that instead. The only thing I would change is to possibly add garlic to the roasted veggies. I can totally see this being made at my house often. **UPDATE** I used garlic in the veggies and it was PERFECT!

Very creamy, rich and extremely delicious.  We didn't change anything, and it came out great!

I'd do 3.5 stars if I could b/c this is somewhere between good and pretty good. The eggplant turned my alfredo sauce an institutional beige color. More importantly, I really don't like mushy noodles (for example, I never eat soup containing pasta b/c it's always water-logged). By pre-cooking the pasta as the recipe instructs, the pasta was mushy. I think this recipe is flexible on what veggies you use--I did the eggplant and squash, but added green pepper, a few baby carrots and a chopped tomato. I only had half the cheese amount and it was plenty cheesy, but then again, I used "four cheese" alfredo sauce by Classico. Another downside is it requires a ton of dishes to be dirtied and it took quite a while between roasting the veggies and getting the casserole assembled. I think casseroles should be chuck it all in and pop it in the oven--easy, one dish.

I made some changes based on what I had at home.  I used a vegetable spaghetti sauce and spaghetti noodles.  It turned out great and my little kids ate it up!

I made this recipe as is and it came out pretty good. How ever here are the changes I made which i think made it better.
i just soaked the noodles in hot water but didnt cook them. This way when i drained and added the chicken and veggies and cheese and tossed it in the oven, the noodles didnt come out too mushy like another reviewer complained. I also didnt add any broth because i'd liked it to be creamer. I added mushrooms cuz i had them and added some garlic salt to the veggies when roasting. I also freeze any extra for up to 3 months and toss it back into the oven when i need dinner quick.

It was a good recipe, my husband and really enjoyed it! There are a lot of pots at the end, but I like to stick to the recipe first time around when trying it out. Overall nice crispy top layer with the breadcrumbs and cheese and creamy inside = yummy! Only thing I did was cut back on the cooking time. Roasted veggies as directed, but cooked pasta when just about to become tender and strained and put in casserole dish with rest of vegetables for 20 mins, so didn't have mushy noodles when done!

Tasty.  I used bagged stir-fry mix plus some eggplant from my garden.  Husband raved about it being a good way to get his veggies, but he can handle a heavy meal like this without changing pants sizes.  Will save in my "once a year" file for when all our garden veggies are ready next year.

Tried as written and was very good if you like alfredo sauce.  When remade I substituted the alfredo sauce for a home made cheese sauce, hmm I should post it, it's so good.  With this change it is 5 stars for our tastes but obviously as written it all works perfectly too.   Worth the effort in the end.

I did make a few changes and spruced up a few things. It required too many cooking pots I used one big pot to boil the pasta and mix everything together. 

I boiled the pasta for 5 mins let it sit in the water. 

When I roasted the vegetables I added mushrooms and instead of cutting the onion and peppers. I found a mixed bag of those pepppers in the frozen aisle. I added garlic and herb seasoning to the vegetables with the salt and pepper.

While that was roasting I mixed the chicken broth with two jars of Alfredo sauce. (Using two different kinds) added half a bag of Mexican cheese and a generous amount of parmesan. 

Bringing it to a boil then adding the vegetables poured it in the baking dish added more parmesan and Mexican cheese on top.

Oven was on 400 degrees 

Covered dish with aluminum foil baked for 10 mins uncovered added three cheese bread crumbs cooked for an additional 4 mins and voila .

Hope that helps and makes sense lol I like one pot dinners and clean up was a breeze.

not much taste.  i had to add a bunch of italian seasoning, salt, pepper and red pepper.
