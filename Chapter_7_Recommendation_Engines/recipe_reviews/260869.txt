Actually had organic microwave popcorn to use, so I just melted chocolate almond bark in the microwave, once melted per instructions, threw in some chopped pecans, spooned it over the popcorn, gently stirred and then spread out over parchment paper until cooled. I too, had made some almond bark pretzels the other day and popcorn just sounded better.
