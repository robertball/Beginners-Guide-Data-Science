I am not one for putting a lot of stuff on my meat, but because of the Worcestershire and the liquid smoke this intrigued me.  This preparation rocks pork! It adds a great, smoky flavor and the other spices blend well to enhance the flavor of the pork without overpowering it.  One suggestion: I mixed the Worcestershire and the liquid smoke, rubbed it on the pork and then mixed the dry ingredients and used them as a rub.  In my opinion, to have mixed the wet and dry ingredients would have led to a pasty mess, which would have been difficult to spread evenly on the meat.  This is definitely in my file of "do agains."

I followed this recipe exactly.  I did not separate the liquid and dry ingredients like others suggested.  I mixed it all and it was perfect to rub onto the pork chops. When rubbed onto the chops i was worried that this mixture wouldnt stay but much to my surprise it was absorbed and none of it fell off.  THis was my first time using liquid smoke, it adds an awesome flavor and my entire family gobbled this up.  I doubled the batch for my husband and myself and our 5 kids and everyone just loved it! Awesome recipe, I have printed this recipe and added it to my book and WILL be making this regularly for my family! THANK YOU!!

Very good tonight for dinner. Couldn't find the paprika, so substituted cumin. We are in a fire ban, so  I baked these in a 350 oven for 55-60 min, turning once. Loved the flavor; thought it would be overwhelming but they weren't. Recipe made a pasted that was just enough for 4 chops, and it was easy and fun to make.

Wow! Thanks for the great reviews everyone. I'm so glad most of you enjoy this recipe. I created it about 20 yrs ago after a lot of trial and error. My family and friends think it's the best rub for pork chops and I'm so happy to see that many of you agree! Thanks again!

Edit: For those who are having trouble with the mixture staying on the meat, you are supposed to massage the mixture into the meat with your hands to ensure that it adheres well. Do not just sprinkle it on the meat like you do with some seasonings. It's basically a rub that has liquid in it. It is more like a thin paste rather than a marinade or a dry rub.

Edit April 2014: I see some reviews saying this rub is too wet and does not work as a rub. Guys! Follow the directions! Rinse your chops but do not pat dry. Mix the ingredients as listed. Do NOT change the recipe then say it doesn't work. If you follow the instructions, you will find a very good rub for pork chops, chicken and beef steaks. Really, you will!

12/13/14: I am so happy that so many people love this rub. It truly makes me feel very good. I understand that some find it too salty...but then, that is is their issue and they can adjust it for salt per their preference. What I do not get are those who are not following the directions, then saying it's not working for them. They are not following the directions then. This recipe is a wet rub...not a dry one. From the many, many positive reviews, it's clear most folks are getting it.

Delicious, without a lot of time or effort! These chops definitely have a wonderful "smoky" flavor and the rub definitely compliments the Worcestershire and liquid smoke combination. I used the "wet" ingredients on the pork first, then rubbed the dry ingredients on which worked out very well.  This is a great recipe especially when you don't have time to marinate but still want a great deal of flavor!

Easy to make with pantry staples and most importantly, easy to scale down for 2 people without waste!  These turned out delicious.  Will definitely make these again.

These were easy and unbelievably flavorful. They also have no oil.  I used a little less liquid smoke and added some soy sauce. I am Portuguese and the flavor reminded me of Portuguese chorizo.

My better half and I have been trying grilled pork chop recipes lately and those that we've tried have all been absolutely delicious but this is our current fave. Juicy, smoky, and tender.  We seared them before continuing with the recipe and I certainly recommend that step. Adds another layer of flavor to an already flavorful recipe. :o)

The flavor of these is really good.  We made into a marinade because the rub was a gritty gloppy texture after we added the liquid.  Also, 12 min per side was way too long and the became too dry and tough.  Will try again and adjust the cooking time

I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but I made these tonight for my family and they were delicious.  My family loved them.  Great flavor.  Served these with a salad and grilled corn.  Wonderful Sunday meal.

These pork chops were very good.  I did as one reviewer suggested and mixed the worchestershire cause and the liquid smoke together, dipped the chops in the liquid and then rubbed in the dry spices.  I think the next time I will cook them for only 10 minutes per side, the 12 minutes per side seems to be a tad bit too much.  Of course, this would depend on the level of heat from your grill.  Try these, you won't be sorry!

Flavor was good, but the salt was too much for our taste. Next round I'll cut the season salt to 2 teaspoons (maybe even 1.5). Followed what others said and did the wet and dry separate. javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')

This was excellent!  Used steak instead of pork chops.  Made exactly as stated.  The mixture turned into a paste that went onto the meat just fine.

Great seasoning rub!  At first it seems like it isn't enough for all the pork chops, but it is once you rub it in good on both sides will use again somple ingredients

My husband really enjoyed these pork chops. I was nervous that I would over cook them and they would turn out dry (I'm not the best at out door grilling), but they were perfect. After finishing his 1st pork chop, husband said, "I'm going to have to have another one of those". Although after eating the 2nd one he said he thought they were a touch too spicy. I told him I would cut back on the black pepper and he agreed. I did use boneless center cut pork chops and made sure they were at room temp before preparing and grilling. I thought the rub was a bit difficult to get to stick to the meat. Seemed it was a lot easier once the rub sat for awhile on the wet chops and it turned into more of a paste. This was the most time consuming part of the prep. May mix in a touch of water next time before rubbing onto the chops.

I tried this recipe last weekend. It is fantastic. Everyone said it was the best pork chops they had ever eaten. I did not tinker with the recipe at all. There were no left overs for later. This one is a keeper just the way it is.

I have made this twice, the first time with the chops and then with chicken breasts.  As far as a grilled pork chop, I have never made one better than with this recipe!  The chicken was pretty awesome too, although I should have used thinner chicken breasts.  Whenever I grill chops, this will always be my go to recipe, I love it and so does everyone who tastes it!  Thanks very much for this one!

Delicious!  I used fresh garlic and added some canola oil to the marinade to stretch it (I had six large pork chops).  I will definitely use this again.

These were really delicious! We followed the recipe with two exceptions: we cut the recipe in half because we were only cooking 2 chops; and we used granulated onion instead of onion powder. The end result was really delicious chops - even though my hubs over cooked them!

Amazing! Delicious! Will make these chops again! With one left over the next day, I cut it up into small chunks, tossed it into a Caesar salad and that was amazing as well. Cook once, eat twice!! Mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This has become my new favorite pork chop rub! I may try it on steaks too! Unlike other posters, I mixed the wet and dry ingredients together as the recipe suggests and I found the paste to be easy to spread on the chops. I had 8 huge chops completely seasoned in about 5 minutes and the seasonings absorbed very quickly. I grilled on my stovetop cast iron grill pan and my husband loved them. These have been added to the regular rotation!

Reviewer Spunky Buddy is right; mixing the wet and dry ingredients together results in a paste that does not adhere to the pork chops. It would have worked much better to splash the wet ingredients on the pork, then use the spices like a rub. I added a little olive oil to the "paste" and it helped a little, but most of the mixture fell off. That noted, enough of the   mixture stayed on the meat to provide a great flavor. It was excellent, but could have been even better, had the mixture adhered to the meat better.

This received thumbs up from everyone in my family, including the 2-1/2 yo grandkid who ate her entire serving!  I had five chops so I doubled the rub, knowing I would have more than enough.  Turns out there would have been enough for 5 without doubling.  The rub only needs to be a thin coat - try not to leave thicker "globs" of rub on your chops.  The taste was fantastic and complimented the pork well.  Thanks so much for this "keeper"!!

so WOW, especially given how easy it is.  I didn't see anyone else mention using a grill pan so I was scared to do it (our grill is broken) but I did it and it might have even been better because I put a bit of oil on the pan like you should for the grill and it created this smoky CRUST.  Amazingly good & easy, won't change a thing about the ingredients I suspect I will be making this often :)

There is definitely love in this rub!  A new favorite grilled pork chop recipe, for sure.  Made the rub/paste exactly as written, perfect for four good sized center pork loin chops.  Rubbed them in the morning, and just refrigerated until grilling about 12 hours later.  This rub would be great on baby backs, too, can't wait to try that. Thanks to Molly for recommending this and thanks, CookinLovin, for sharing your recipe with AR!

What a flavorful rub!!  I forgot to make a note on my grocery list to get thick, bone-in pork chops, but it didn't matter.  The taste is a little salty for me, so I might cut back to 1/2 Tbl on the Lawry's, but otherwise, it was wonderful.  My husband LOVED it.  I served it with the pesto mashed potatoes from this site, and they went great together!

I have never reviewed a recipe on here but wow I had to for these chops!  Yum even my super picky 21 year old loved them.  I actually had to use soy sauce instead of worsesterchire sauce as my hubby put the empty bottle back in the cupboard surprise surprise.  Love this recipe!

I have used this site for years, but with all the great recipes I have tried, this is the first time I wanted to review a recipe.  This is absolutely fantastic! The flavor is so intense and smoky! My husband and I are both trying to watch what we eat and this is a fantastic low calorie meal! What a delicious treat!  Great job!!!!

Yum!  Eyeballed the amounts of dry ingredients and added twice as much w. sauce & liquid smoke.  Threw it all in a plastic bag massaged the meat and marinated for 6 hours.  This is a keeper!

I have looked through hundreds of pork chop recipes...and this is the best!! I love pork chops, but usually people use BBQ sauce...I don't like it. I love this recipe!  I will make it just for myself, as my husband likes the BBQ sauce.  Why do opposites always live together! Don't ever get rid of this web-site, I've have told so many people about how you can adjust the recipes.  Thank you!!  (PS I have written one cookbook and had it published and I'm done with the second one.........so recipes are important to me and to those who will trust me to give them the best)

Perfection!  I am not a big pork chop lover but I will eat these anytime.  Made it exactly as described and they were moist and tasty and had a wonderful smoky flavor to them - you would have thought they came out of a smoker.  Love it!

I was out of Worcestershire so I didn't use that. I don't like paprika so I used about 1/2 tbs of creole seasoning instead.

It turned out amazing!

prepared exactly as written and they turned out pretty decent. the difference from 4 stars to 5 would be the salt amount. 1 tbsp = too much since pork is already salty. i would cut that in half. other than that it had a really good flavor.

I enjoyed the flavor, but may try baking them, as another reviewer suggested.  I thought they were delicious, but my other half felt they were a little too spicy.

Also, I used the measurements given, and followed the instructions listed and had NO trouble with the consistancy of the rub or any issues with it sticking to the chops.

We loved this pork chop.  I halved the recipe as I had 2 - 3/4" boneless chops.  I mixed up the rub in the morning and put it on the chops to marinate all day and to help get supper on the table in a timely matter after school tonight.  The flavoring is fabulous!  The only sub I had was to use Hot & Spicy Paprika instead of regular paprika. Served this with 'Parmesan Tomatoes' and 'Grilled Sweet Potatoes' both AR recipe.  The chops stole the show - thanks, CookinLovin for sharing your recipe.

This recipes is great, but I agree with the other reviews who suggest marinading the chops in the liquid mixture first, then rub on the dry ingredients. Don't combine the wet with the dry! 

Great smokey flavor in an easy grilling. Company quality for sure!

This is an excellent rub for thick cut porkchops on the grill. Just remember to keep your fingers wet, and the rub spreads evenly. The flavor is a nice blend of smokey/spicy, not overpowering of either.

Not terrible, not great. Couldn't exactly pinpoint the reason. Too salty and rather bland otherwise.

This was amazing!  I mixed the wet and dry ingredients just as the recipe called for, it was very easy, stayed on the chops and added more flavor than you can imagine.  I did decrease the amount of liquid smoke by about half of what the recipe called for since I'm not a big fan of liquid smoke and would probably go ahead and increase the amount back to the original measure next time.  It was not overpowering as I would have thought.  My chops were about 1/2 inch thick and only grilled them about 7 minutes per side.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Quick prep is nice plus to this recipe.  No marinating time.  Loved the flavor the spice rub added to grilled pork chops.  This was a hit with the family.  I used smoked paprika I think it adds to the flavor.

This was wonderful! I used low sodium seasoning, hickory smoke and cut this in half. I used thin pork chops. Nice and easy, and since hubby does the grilling, I didn't even have to cook. I didn't care much for the smoke flavor, but that is personal not a reflection of the recipe.

These were delicious! Like others, I dipped my chops in the Worcestershire and liquid smoke first then rubbed the dry seasonings.  My chops were almost an inch thick, so I let them rest at room temp with the seasonings for about an hours before putting them on the grill.  I cooked for about 9 minutes on each side and then let rest covered for 10 minutes and they were perfect!

I have not cooked with liquid smoke (thought it was too strong and am not a fan of that flavour), but this recipe is awesome.  The spices go well together

If I could give this 10 stars I would!! I am not a big rub fan and definitely do not like liquid smoke. My husband is always in search of a good rub so I thought I would try it. I was also looking for a different way to make pork chops. I followed the recipe exactly and OMG this is the best pork chops I have had in a long time. I was a little worried that it may be a little to salty but they were perfect. My husband and kids absolutely loved them. I want to try the rub on chicken as well. I can not say enough good things about this recipe. I will definitely make it again. Try it you won't be disappointed.

sorry i have to disagree with everyone but these chops were way too salty for me, and spunky was right, mixing everything together made a paste that was hard to work with. the chops had a smokey flavor but everything else was overbaring

I made this awhile ago and we really liked it.  The liquid smoke was a great addition - I broiled it and it tasted as if it came from a grill.  Thanks submitter.

My husband and I both enjoyed this very much. I followed the recipe to a T. I’m not sure what other people’s problem was with the wet rub technique but I loved it and will definitely be using it again. I was worried about the amount of liquid smoke because too much can ruin a meal, but the proportions on all the ingredients were perfect. Next time I will do this the same way, but I think I will add some brown sugar. I like my pork to have just a little sweetness. Overall this was fantastic.

I followed this recipe exactly and the pork chops turned out delicious!! The only thing j would change next time is reducing the amount of grilling time, I think 10min each side would suffice.

This one is a keeper! When rinsing this pork chops, do not shake the excess water off but instead allow it to help you spread/massage the rub. This moisture helps it adhere to the meat. Our pork chops were on the thin side so we cooked for about 6-7 minutes a side.  Otherwise did not change a thing and will make again.

This was one of those nights where you don't have much time to get dinner made so you buy meat you can grill quickly. The store had some pork chops for sale but I wasn't sure what to do with them and turned to my favorite, all recipes. These were literally the best pork chops I have ever made, and I think the best I have ever eaten. I LOVED them! It was quick and easy, I had all the ingredients on hand and followed the recipe as written. We will make these again!

Delicious!  Massaging the well mixed paste onto wet meat as directed is the key....my husband says it was the best pork chop he's ever had - of course the locally raised half hog we bought this year helped too.  Served with scalloped potatoes and roasted garlic lemon broccoli. Can't wait to try it on other proteins....thanks!

These are absolutely YuMMyliCiOUs!!!  My man said they were the best Pork Chops he has ever had...and I have to agree!  I followed the directions as written and would not change a thing!  Make sure you buy bone in, thick pork chops...it makes a difference.

Great Flavor!! Tried it as is on grilled pork chops! I have also altered it a bit by adding about 1 tbs olive oil and using it as a rub/paste on pork roast and tri tip. I'm going to try the paste on a "flat Chicken" where you remove the back bone and lay it flat to cook. I also ran out of season salt one time when making this, but had some cayenne seasoned salt I got as a bonus when I ordered spices on line. That was really good, we like heat!! I love the fact that you don't have to use oil as long as the meat you put it on is wet! It stops the grill from "flaming up" I know I said I added some oil but that is when I bake larger pieces of meat, helps it brown in the oven.

Excellent recipe!  Nice smoky flavor.  Choose nice pork chops for grilling.  Thicker chops tend to stay juicier on the grill.

This is the yummiest ever! Be sure to dry the meat really really good before adding the spice mixture and then wipe it again because if you dont it will be more challenging to rub the rub on... Took me about 25 minutes to rub this on 3 pork chops and 1 big steak and I kept on telling myself this better be worth all this rubbing! OOOOH and it sure was! Be patient and just keep rubbing til you are satisfied it's so worth it!!! For you wondering which was the yummies steak or pork chop with this rub, they both were equally amazing! My family couldn't decide which was there favorite in the taste test! I'm so making this again!

I substituted the salt for smoked salt and used smoked paprika..instead of the liquid smoke.  Healthier I think as liquid smoke usually has chemicals, and the smoked salt/paprika gave it that smokey flavor.

8/14 great.  i marinated for 2 days, that was prob. why they were so good.  in glass dish put 2 tsp worsteshire sauce and 1 tsp soy sauce, lots of steak seasoning and some kosher salt, rinse and pat dry with paper towels the chops then add to the mix in the dish, coat both sides well.  sear chops and then move to indirect heat until done.

Oh, yummy!   Only change I made was using soy sauce instead of Worcestershire, only because I discovered at the last minute I was out.  (These two things, while similar in appearance, are NOT interchangeable, and I'll definitely use the Worcestershire next time!)  I rubbed the paste in well on both sides, let set for about 10 minutes, and then rubbed it in again and let set for 10 more minutes.   Before grilling, I did gently wipe off some "clumps" with my fingers, as I wasn't sure what a heavy glob of that paste might taste like.   My chops were only about 1/2 inch thick, and we cooked about 7 minutes on each side on a medium gas grill, and they were done perfectly.   Hubby and I both loved these, and will definitely make them again soon!

These simple ingredients pack in a lot of taste, however we did find the spices overpowering to the pork. Next time, I think I'll use less of the rub on each chop. We used 3/4" thick boneless pork loin chops instead of bone in. Also, I'll not mix the wet and dry rub ingredients. It turned into a messy paste that was difficult to massage onto the pork.

This was a fabulous rub for pork! We used three pork shoulder steaks with bone in and I followed the recipe exactly. I had no trouble spreading the spices mixed with worchestershire sauce and liquid smoke. I dumped it on each steak and then used a brush to spread it evenly, then massaged it into the meat. I come from beef country (AAA Alberta Beef), and I must say, I enjoyed this pork more than beef! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe, very moist and tender.  Note to those that are questioning the recipe, these are grilled on indirect heat that is why it lists the time per side at 12 minutes but of course that would depend on the thickness of your chops so jt watch them and go by temperature instead of time.  Also you really do not "sprinkle" the rub on you glob it on and smear it in with your hands.  We really enjoyed these and even the leftovers warmed up very well.

We love this recipe! I mixed the wet and dry ingrediants in a zip lock bag then added the chops and rubbed the mix all over the chops. I let them marinade for an hour or more and the results are juicy, tender chops!

I made this exactly as directed and it was just ok for us.  I used thick pork chops as recommended.  The paste was a little awkward to spread and to keep on.  The photo makes the chops appear moist with the promise of a deep smoky flavored piece of meat which did not deliver as promised.  It was still good but did not live up to what I thought.

OMG!  These are awesome pork chops.  This is how I'll be preparing pork chops from now on.  The only change I made was the cooking time - 3 1/2 - 4 minutes per side is plenty.  Otherwise they'll be too dry.

I used this on a pork tenderloin, and then grilled it.  It was so moist and flavorful, the only change I made was I only used a dash of liquid smoke, that can be overpowering.

The best pork chop recipe I have had.  I marinate the pork chops for a couple of hours in the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke and then use the dry ingredients as a rub.  This recipe will make a big package of 9 pork chops easily.  I usually still have dry ingredients left that I just save till the next time we make it.  For our family of four I freeze the leftovers and they are just as juicy and yummy when I am short on time but want something easy for dinner.

I've used many pork chop recipes from this website and me and my husband love this one by far!! I didn't have liquid smoke flavoring, so I left it out. I also baked it at 375º for 50 minutes and it came out AMAZING.

I added a couple dashes of Mesquite seasoning. I also did not have any paprika. But this came out great!!
I paired it with some instant potatoes that I added garlic to. Great dinner!!

my family and I LOVED this!!! Soo much flavour.  Next time (which will be very soon) I will not use as much of the spice mixture on each pork chop, it was just a tad bit much, but either way they were sooo tasty.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I did not have seasoning salt on hand, so instead I used coarse sea salt (decreased amount to 1/2 TBS).  I decreased the amount of the other seasons to 1/2 TBS as well, which was just the right amount for the pack of chops.

I also could not find liquid smoke flavoring in our local grocery store, but my husband used some hickory chips on the grill, which added extra flavor.  Overall the pork chops were delicious!  I bought thin chops and they cooked FAST (about 2 mins per side).  The flavor was really good though.  The only change I'll make next time is to buy thick chops and use less salt.

Love this recipe.  I have also used it on pork roast.  But the rub is difficult until it finally turns to paste.  Next time I will do as others suggest and do the liquids separately

I've made this several times and it's a winner in my house. I leave the chops a bit wet from rinsing, it helps for rubbing in the spices. Also, my chops are never remotely close to 145 degrees after 24 minutes. I usually have to let them go longer, and sometimes finish them over direct heat. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were phenomenal, I did happen to get a good buy on double cut pork chops and I must say they were the best I've ever made. Since I did not have Worcestershire sauce I used Peter Luger sauce. I seared both sides and grilled with just a touch of pink left (approximately 145 degrees) Juicy and full of flavor. ITis a keeper for me! Let them rest before eating!!

This is a great rub!  I cooked the pork in the oven instead of the grill (400 for 20 mins) and it was fantastic.  I am going to try the rub on chicken and turkey as well.

We didn't have liquid smoke and we ran short on garlic powder by about 1/2, but this was delicious! We will definitely make these again and we will come prepared with all the
 ingredients next time. How nice to be able to throw the rub on and get to cooking right away. The results did not disappoint.

Excellent taste.  Love this rub. However, we grilled them for 6 minutes each side and that was too much (a little dry). We'll try 4.5 minutes per side next time.

I didn’t have the powdered onion, or the the liquid smoke, but I had bought enough smoked pork chops, and the paprika I used was a Smokey Paprika, so they tasted ver smoky. However, they were a bit salty, so I will cut down on the seasoned salt next time. My husband loves them, he usually doesn’t like pork chops all that much, so I will make them again.

This  rub is fantastic.  The cooking time is pretty long though.  I only cooked the chops about six minutes per side and they were perfect.  I'm afraid they'd have been inedible, if I had followed the instructions.  That's why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.

Love the rub.   Great taste and the pork chops were very juicy and flavorful.   Used 1" pork rib-eye chops.   Once change would be to oil the  grill first.   I seared them for a couple minutes each side at 500 degrees and then reduced heat to medium and put chops on grill shelf over indirect heat.   Yummy.

One for the books! I have made these twice, and the second time I made a few adjustments. The second time, I used some nice extra thick boneless loin chops. I hit them all over with a jacquard and added about 1-2T of water- the texture as it is makes it just kind of slide around the meat, with the water you end up with a much more workable paste. I recommend grilling these over medium heat to avoid scorching the seasonings. There are never any leftovers. This one is getting written down and put in the recipe book!

This is a great marinade, although I did add McCormick garlic/herb and Montreal chicken spices (my preference). The pork is good but found I like this much better on chicken.  Thanks for posting.

I made these exactly according to the recipe with one exception -- I used smoked paprika in place of regular paprika.  I doubled the recipe and had enough to cover 10 bone-in chops.  When you make them, I recommend rinsing the chops and not drying them.  I think that's where some people may be having a problem.  You will need that little bit of water on the chops to help spread the paste.  I let them sit for closer to 15 or 20 minutes while I prepared some side-dishes, then re-rubbed them to spread the paste out evenly before I put them on the grill.  Wow!  So delicious.  And in under an hour!  I'm used to marinating pork chops over night and they're still not this good.  My husband and son both raved about how good they were.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Easy and good.  Always looking for different ways to cook pork chops and since I was in a grilling mood, figured I would give it a try.  I love smoky food and this fit the bill perfectly, nice and moist and great flavor.

Made for dinner tonight. Didn't have paprika so I just omitted it. Hubby grilled on charcoal. Everyone agreed this is now going to be on our "usual" dinner menu. Juicy, smoky and tender. Served with a salad and grilled onions and potatoes.

Smoky Grilled Pork Chops Haiku: "Messy, gloppy paste. Could not 'sprinkle' nor 'rub' it. Burned off on the grill." So my grill's a glue-ey mess from having made this "rub/marinade hybrid." I followed the recipe exactly as written, no substitutions nor changes to the directions, and the rub was like paste that all I could do was press onto the surface of the pork chops, which resulted in it just falling off entirely onto the grill grates when I flipped the chops. Now the meat itself was moist and tender, but 75% of the flavor from this recipe was lost entirely, so it was a bust. Oh well, the weather's nice and I'll take any excuse to stand outside by the grill w/ a cold beer, so glad that I had a chance to make a new recipe while I was at it!

AWESOME!  Even with an unplanned minor substitution--I discovered too late that I was out of liquid smoke.  Based on other reviews, I substituted 1 tsp low sodium soy sauce and 1 tsp kitchen bouquet browning sauce.  Otherwise, followed as written.  Very flavorful, tender, and easy to make.

Used this recipe as described with the exception of the seasoned salt..didn't have any use kosher salt instead.  Let me tell you this was by far the best pork chops I have ever made.  Family loved them.  The consistency of the rub is weird at first mixing the liquids and the dry.  But once you work it into the meat it creates a great rub.  Will definately use again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Outstanding.   I did add olive oil and then browned in a cast iron skillet 3 min per side and then cooked in a 400 oven until internal temp 160, let rest 5 min. Everyone loved it.

I made this recipe similar to what it was called far however I changed a few things. I didn't have the liquid smoke, but the recipe was great without it. Also I used a pre-mixed blend of garlic and onion powder that also had celery salt, and white and black pepper.

This is so wonderful and worth every 5 star  I just gave it! I only changed two things, I wrapped my center cut chops in bacon (Oscar Meyer thick cut), and I did as others suggested by mixing the two liquids separate from the rub. I dipped chops in liquid mix (without wetting with water), and then massaged the rub into the pork chops, then wrapped sides with bacon (used toothpicks to keep bacon on).. Try these out, you will love them!

This was delicious! Best pork chop recipe I've tasted.  I didnt have liquid smoke flavoring so I used a combination of smoked paprika and cajun spices.  Served it with a parmesan cheese potatoes and "garlic and cashew butter broccoli" recipe from AR.  Perfect, thank you!

These turned out great. Instead of using liquid smoke though I grilled over charcoal and used pecan wood for the Smokey flavor. Also, I added more Worcestershire to the mix to make it a little more liquid, also used minced onion and garlic instead of powder and let it all marinate for 30 minutes instead of 10. This worked out great and added a little extra flavor.

Fantastic! I followed the directions exactly and these were some tasty chops. My family loved them and this is the only way I will prepare them in the future. This is the first recipe that I liked enough to wrote a review about. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Just made these this evening. Didn't change a thing. They were delicious! I mixed the liquid and dry ingredients together which made a paste. I then rubbed it all over each pork chop. I used boneless pork chops. Grilled for 10 minutes each side as the chops were a little on the thin side. Perfect!

Some how this barely had any taste and as I mixed the wet and dry ingredients it turned into a paste.

We really enjoyed this.  The 2nd time I made it I put wet on and used the spice as a dry rub. Both good 2nd had more flavour.  I did add extra smoke. Thank you.

I didn't have liquid smoke or a grill. The seasoning we used was a chipotle garlic blend. I pan frying on each side (with coconut oil) for 10 minutes with the cover on.

Great recipe; did not make any changes or substitutions.  My kids ate it quickly and asked for more.  As a bonus, my son didn't slather his meat in barbeque sauce which is rare.

I made this at the last minute for Mothers Day yesterday. My family wanted Pork chops on the grill but didn't know how to fix them. My mother wanted me to make them at home but no no did not feel like it. So I got on All Recipes to see what they had for grill pork chops. Came across this and ran with it. However I did not do any measurements that they asked for. Only the paprika, everything else I just free styled and placed it all in a ziplock bag. I had 8 chops,rub it on the chops with my fingers, then placed them all in the bag with the remaining seasonings and shook it all together. They were grilld to perfection, my family loved it!!

This is FANTASTIC!   I super enjoyed these chops.  
Next time I will marinate them a bit longer, but certainly not necessary.   I was a bit short on liquid smoke, but made up for it by adding some smoked paprika.  Served this with some baked beans and hash browns.  Delish!  Thanks for this.

This is a keeper. For those who shied away from mixing the dry and wet ingredients, the paste it makes, is easy to spread and rub in. The recipe shouldn't say sprinkle on both sides. I just used the spoon I mixed it with and spooned some on each chop.

It was way too salty for me! If I try this again, I'll decrease the amount of Lowry's (or not add any at all) and perhaps add a little more liquid to make the paste spread easier.

Made these for Sunday supper and they were sooo good and tender. I let them set in the liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce for a couple of hours and rubbed with the seasonings. Excellent!!! Thank you for a great recipe!

Just made this tonight. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this. We followed the recipe exactly except for washing the chops. For those people who complained about the rub being a gloppy mess, they are correct. However, I found that after rubbing the meat for about 20-30 minutes, the rub stayed on the meat. It just takes time. Be patient and it'll form a nice crust. Now...a word of caution...make sure when you go to grill, don't place the meat directly over the coals. I completely forgot about the rub having brown sugar and when I left the chops for all of a few minutes, I returned to most of them being charred.

This rub makes meat so flavourful! I've also used it on chicken breast and steak, tastes fantastic! Love the use of liquid smoke. So simple and easy to make and it doesn't need much time for the meat to soak up the flavour. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it was my summer grilling staple!

I modified this recipe by adding a bottle of garlic & Herb marinade and soaked the chops for three hours, but the results were spectacular.  Also, make sure that you brush the chops with the marinade while grilling them in order to prevent them from drying out on the grill.

Being that pork is one of my favorite foods, I found this to be way too spicy.  It was more like a Cajun type of pork. For those who love spicy you'll probably like this,  If you want to taste to the flavor of pork I recommend trying "Best Grilled Pork Chops" which is on this site.

I made this last night and they were awesome! I don't like liquid smoke so I just coated my pork chops with  the  Worcestershire sauce and used smoked paprika in my rub instead of regular paprika. Very good, can't wait to make them again.

The whole family loves this recipe.  Most of us do not usually care for pork chops but this tastes awesome!  Corn on the cob and french bread go well.  At first I was worried that it would be too much salt and seasonings but it was perfect!

I made this exactly as directed:  As some other reviewers said..my rub didn't stay on the meat.  I massaged into one side, turned over and did the other side and when I turned them back over or picked them up to put on the grill, the rub was staying on the bottom of the dish.  The thick loin chops were still good & moist but didn't have seasoned flavor I thought it would have with that much garlic, paprika, etc.  Next time I'll try marinating in the wet ingredients for a long time then sprinkle on the dry ingredients to see if that helps.  I don't want to give up on this.

Very flavorful.  I baked 5 pork chops for 50 minutes - too long.  Next time I'll try a half hour.

So Tasty!  My husband loved it and asked that I not loose this recipe!  I used 1 pound of pork loin chops.  I trimmed the extra fat from the meat. I doubled everything else to make sure I had enough.  I listened to other reviewers and mixed the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke together in one bowel and the spices in another.  Coated the meat well in the wet mixture, then coated every inch of the meat in the dry.  Hubby grilled the chops and then...HEAVEN!    Thank you CookinLovin for sharing!

Very good, and very easy!  Everyone had seconds.  Baked uncovered at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes instead of grilling (used instant-read thermometer to check doneness).  Could have used a little less seasoned salt, and next time I will take other reviewers' advice and separate the wet and dry seasonings, as the "paste" formed by combining them was difficult to get onto the meat.  I will make this again.

Perfectly smoky, campfire-type flavor pork chops (I used an ordinary grocery butcher's 4 pack of boneless THICK pork chops) tastes wonderful to offset smoky dried chile and avocado salsa, tortilla, and a side of pintos with Cotija cheese.  I do not like Liquid Smoke in any other recipe but combining it with the Worcestershire sauce is beautiful.  However, I used a dry rub with the first few ingredients and then drizzled on the wet 2 ingredients before, during and after the grilling.  Another way to do it would be to put on the dry rubs and then marinate in a bag.  I know the recipe calls to make a paste but I get really weirded out smearing paste on meat.  

In looking at the negatives for this, I saw a common theme of "too salty" but that could be the cuts of pork used.  I think thinner ones will taste saltier. You might do well to pare down using less salt if you have thinner cuts.  Normally if a review has a lot of typos in it, I pretty much discount it.

Made the recipe as written this past summer and my family all loved them. Was trying to come up with something different for pork the other night and decided I would try baking these. I marinated the pork in the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke for a few minutes then dipped in the dry ingredients. Baked in pan with foil over them for 30 minutes removed foil and finished baking until temp reached. They were great!

The kids loved it!  It was super easy to make on short notice since I didn't have to let it sit in a marinade for 3 to 5 hours like many of the other recipes called for.  I used the broiler setting on the toaster oven since it's about 28 degrees outside and I didn't feel like grilling.  Everything worked wonderfully!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a terrific recipe, but I deducted a star because I and my guests all felt it was a bit too salty---and I am a major salt lover. The second time I made it I cut the salt in half, and it was great. There is no need to do the liquids and the spices separately. Just follow the instructions and it turns out absolutely perfect and rubs easily into the meat without being too pasty or sticky. A really delicious way to make pork chops.

I mixed the wet and dry and it was great and stayed on the pork.  I let it sit on the chops for half an hour or more.  I don't like the smoke flavor so I made 1/4 of the mix without it for me.  Everyone else loved the recipe exactly as it is and I loved it without the liquid smoke!

My family loved these pork chops! The seasoning reminded my husband of jerky (which he loves!) and we couldn't get enough of it! My in-laws even ate the pork chops as leftovers the next day! 
Definitely a go to recipe for grilled pork chops. Wonderful, smoky flavor without all of the extra salt! Will definitely make these again and again!

Defintely a "do again" recipe. I didn't have liquid smoke flavoring so I made the recipe without but they still turned out amazing and I will do this again.

I will agree with the other reviewers, the paste consistency is a little difficult to work with... but SO worth it. The mixture seemed a bit heavy and thick, but it didn't fall off like I had anticipated while grilling. I let mine sit for about 2 hours, covered in the fridge. The husband loves all things BBQ; these were on point for him, and with just the right amount of heat for my sensitive taste-buds!

This was a good recipe, the only difference was I added a little olive oil as I am not found of dry rubs. Brushed on to the chops and left in the fridge for a couple of hours to marinade.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing.

We really liked this but I did change some things. I left  out the salt added 1/2 t blackened seasoning .Didn't have onion powder so left that out also, everything else kept as written. I did make the paste and it worked well. The chops tender and juicy with a lot of flavor.Thanks for the recipe

This was great! It is definitely somewhat unique and adds a new spin on chops. I tweaked it a little. I rubbed the Worcestershire sauce on before and then added the dry ingredients. I added a tad bit of white wine to the baking dish (to keep moist) and allowed these to soak overnight in the fridge. I left off the liquid smoke because my husband has a smoker, so we used that instead! It only took about 1 hour to smoke them and they were  delicious! The spices stayed on just fine! This is a keeper :)

This is the best rub for chops or pork loin ever.  I was a little afraid of the liquid smoke and I really don't like worcestershire sauce. Still I prepared this exactly per the recipe and it was fabulous.  Have since used on several pork loin roasts and like it even better. Oh and it makes the kitchen smell devine. Your mouth will water the entire cooking time.  Thanks for a lovely recipe.

I used boneless loin chops that were probably 2" thick. I marinated overnight and the flavor was great.  The only complaint was the some had some "gritty" pieces from the rub. I did not personally have this problem. Great flavor.

Nothing against other reviewers, but I felt it was just an average recipe.  Not sure what makes this recipe unique from others where you put a rub on meat and grill?  Whether thick cut or not, I would 1) brine the chops; 2) remove from brine, dry, and let the rub penetrate longer than a few minutes (this would intensify flavors...might not be what you want with liquid smoke); and 3) use real smoke flavor from chips via indirect cooking.  IF that's not an option, using smoked paprika or other smokey flavors might help compensate.

Great. My family loved these. We use home grown pork which has way more flavour than store bought. I used 8 pork chops as mine were thinner than the recipe called for. So good. But should be avoided by those who have a low sodium diet.

My 7 yr old took them to school for lunch 2 days in a row. Thanks for sharing.

I made 6 chops so I made 1 1/2 times recipe for rub, had way too much.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  I made rub as directed & had no problem rubbing on to chops, while they were still wet from rinsing them.  I turned them often on the BBQ even though they were done over indirect heat. Chops were moist & juicy. Loved the recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I was excited to try this new recipe after reading raving reviews! Overall, it was delicious! Even my picky husband loved it, and he normally does not eat pork chops. The only complaint I had was the chops were a little spicy so next time I will not put the rub on so thick. I recommend scraping the extra rub off the pork chops before cooking. Ours were also a little dry, but that was our fault for cooking them too long. I will DEFINITELY be making this recipe again though, great flavor overall!!

My family proclaimed these chops to be the best they've ever eaten!  I used a thinner chop because that's what I had on hand and just cooked for a smaller amount of time.  Juicy and and very flavorful!  Thanks for the recipe.

After reading through all the good reviews here i noticed not one of them is negative about this recipe. As i am always looking at various ways to cook with chops and i have some Liquid smoke that ive been wondering what to do with, this fits the bill perfectly. I'll be making this and will be back to comment on how it went.

Followed recipe - really good - everyone loved them.  If you rub with wet ingredients, make sure you get the excess off the chops.  A little spicy for my little ones.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!!!!

Like many of the reviews, this is a great rub for grilled chops.  I made it as the recipe called for but added more Worcestershire to make the paste easier to apply to the meat and let sit in the fridge for an hour to solidify prior to putting on the grill.  Had a great taste, especially with a glass of Noir or Merlot.

It was ok.  I doubled it and it made a dark braising on the meat with a solid mix of flavors.  A hint too salty, but it was ok.   I'd do it again.

I tried this recipe!  Didn’t have liquid smoke, but followed all other ingredients.  Grilled them the allotted amount of time on medium high with lid down on grill.  Excellent!  Very moist and tasty.  I added this recipe to my favorites and will definitely make them again!

These turned out great, even having to use substitutes.  I did not have liquid smoke or seasoned salt so I used adobo instead of the seasoned salt. I did let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and made it in the oven.  Regardless the fam loved them.  Will make again.

Very good flavor but too salty.  It might simply be the amount of salt in the Morton Season All I used.  

Following the guidance in another review, I wet the chops (boneless) with the liquid mixture and then sprinkled on the rub.  I had quite a bit of rub leftover so I may reduce the quantities a bit on my next attempt.

I did mix the leftover rub with some sour cream and light mayo to make a sandwich spread.  I lightly grilled some kaiser rolls and put some of the spread on the with slices of the pork chop.  Very good.

Very very good.  I did as others said, and rubbed in the wet ingredients, and then followed with the dry rub.

In any case, very tasty, and even my picky daughter asked for seconds.

Very Good.  I made modifications:  Added 1 T. Smoked Paprika in addition to the 1 T. Sweet Paprika.  Added 3/4- 1 tsp. brown sugar.  Added Cayenne to taste. Added Kosher salt to taste. Deleted Liquid smoke.  Rubbed the chops with the spice.  Put the chops in ziplock and refrigerated for 1 hour.  Let them sit for 20 min at room temperature, then grilled.  12 min is a little too long per side - would cook less next time.  Moist & great taste.

Maybe I shouldn't have cut the seasonings in half because I had four small chops.  A bit bland.  But I will try again because it's a simple rub with all the right ingredients.

Very good.  I didn't have trouble with the rub sticking to the meat.  For Variety, I've also add a little siracha sauce for but of heat. Perfect on the George foreman grill. Thanks for the recipe

I honestly don’t get why this has so many reviews and so many good ones. It was meh. If I was going to make it again I would add a teaspoon of sugar to the spice rub and would not mix the liquid in. But I won’t make it again. I’ve had much better pork chops.

turned out pretty good but I cooked mine on the traeger and it did not turn out like the photo.  The marinade seemed to be to watery and the meat did not glaze up and have the grill marks.  Tasted great though.

I grilled pork chops with this paste and I believe it’s the best I’ve ever used. Tonight I did chicken breasts and I added about one tablespoon balsamic vinegar to it. Either way is wonderful.

These were great! We look forward to making them again in the near future. We don't fry food anymore, so these are a great alternative. I recommend these to anyone who wants to eat a reasonably healthy meal.

This was very easy to prepare, and it has a lot of flavor. My wife thinks that I should put it on a pork roast next time, and I think I will. You have to get your hands messy when rubbing it in, but spend some time rubbing it on. The water on the meat from the washing step really helps in spreading the rub, so don’t skip that step. Good  Rub Recipe.

The first time I made them, I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so substituted with soy sauce and I used boneless pork loin chops. It was amazing!!!
Tonight I made them exactly as written, besides letting them "marinate" in the fridge for a few hours, and they were a little spicier than I'm a fan of, but still very good. I think I might have put too much rub on the chops. It was cooker error and not the recipe. I will continue to use this rub. I'm curious to see how it would taste on chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fast and easy to make. My husband and I loved it! Followed the directions with the exception of using granulated garlic & onion instead of powder. It was great and I’ll likely stick with the granulated.

This is an excellent recipe. It is definitely a keeper. I followed it exactly except that I used hot Hungarian paprika and, not having the patience to grill the chops over indirect heat, I grilled them over low heat. I also wrapped some Vidalia onions with butter in foil and grilled them. It was an excellent pairing.

We really loved the simplicity of this recipe. The flavor was great and not too smokey or salty at all....and I am particularly sensitive to salty foods. Out of necessity, I used a bit of smoked paprika to round out my Tablespoon of paprika as I ran out at the last second (about 2/3 Tbs regular paprika and 1/3 Tbs smoked paprika) and it was not too "smokey" at all. 
I rinsed and patted dry my 6 (on-bone) pork chops and then massaged in the rub as directed. It was not paste-y or sticky as other described.  I let it sit for the 10 minutes indicated and everything remained intact....nothing fell off and nothing got glue-y or sticky on the bbq grates. Delicious! A keeper for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Used this on a pork tenderloin -- marinated in the liquid while preparing the dry mix.  Rubbed on and let sit before roasting in a hot oven.  Cut down on the salt to reduce sodium and this was still a winner!

Mine turned out a bit dry.  I will make it again, but pay more attention to the size of the chops and remove them earlier if needed.  Otherwise, the rub is indeed easy to make and quite tasty.

Easy prep.  Cooked on charcoal.  Subbed smoked paprika for liquid smoke and they were great.  Def use bone in and at least 1/2" thick.

I made these chops as written, we liked them but thought they were too salty. I will probably try this again but use less of the seasoning salt.

Delicious! I was worried it was going to be too salty but it was not. I used this on both boneless and bone in chops, then just cooked them in a skillet. A side note just about chops in general I’d be careful not to over cook. They will get done sooner than you think.

The rub gives the meat amazing flavor, but the indirect heating method didn't work for us. Several of chops ended up undercooked, so we had to finish them up by grilling them directly.

DIVINE!! So I added (accidentally) 1 1/2 TBS extra of the Worcestershire. Anyway, also added a bit of olive oil to the mixture and grilled on a foil pan. Amazing!!

These pork chops were fair. There was too much seasoned salt. I stirred the seasonings with the Worcestershire sauce and it became crumbly. I didn't use the liquid smoke. I baked mine in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. They had enough time in the oven. I think next time, I'll skip the seasoned salt altogether and keep the dry and wet ingredients separate.

My husband and I thought this turned out deliciously. Instead of grilling, I added some olive oil to a pan and cooked the chops on the stove top. The olive oil and seasonings created what I would call a marinade so the chops really soaked up the flavors while cooking.

This was an easy and very simple prep for pork chops. took no time at all. I used the thinner chops that were on sale, and I did not have the liquid smoke on hand and they still came out delicious. 
I let the chops sit out for about 15 minutes to ensure the rub sat on them and my boys LOVED them.

I made these last night and loved the professional tasting spice mix.  I did separate the wet and dry spices for easier application.  I think I'll also brine the pork chops prior to adding the spices next time to give them a juicier texture.  Will use this again and again.

Good stuff. If the chops aren’t super thick, I suggest cooking a min or 2 less per side so they don’t dry out.

I can't wait to try this.  It is a very similar recipe to one that I have been making for smoked brisket (in the oven)  for over 40 years and everybody LOVES it!  And I already KNOW how well the wet rub works!

There is something wrong with this recipe.  

The ingredients listed make a very thick, dry paste, that would have to be spread on the meat.

There must be a liquid ingredient missing because you can't possibly "sprinkle" this as it is.

My family did not care for this at all. Followed the recipe exactly and it was overwhelmingly salty.  unfortunately even my teenage son who eats all the leftovers wouldn't touch it. He's NOT picky either. Not sure why this has such high reviews, but I definitely won't make this again.

It has a pretty strong flavor to it. The first time I made it I not only rubbed it on but also brushed it on while cooking. That makes it far too potent. Overall it's got great flavor and it's pretty easy to execute.

Please by all means, follow this recipe exactly!  Yes, it's a gritty paste. It's supposed to be. Do not substitute any ingredients!  If you do then you are missing out. This is now my go to rub for chicken, pork, and beef. It is absolutely perfect!

I made this exactly as written. It was soooooo good!! Yes, leave the pork wet, and massage in well. The only thing I changed (yes I know I said I made it exact) was that the amount seemed a bit much for 4 chops so we rubbed it into 8. Not too salty at all. Complimented the pork beautifully, can hardly wait to try it on chicken

I made this with thin (1/4 inch thick) pork chops.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of adjusting the cooking time due to the thickness of the meat.  I grilled on high for 3 minutes per side and they came out perfect.  The picky eater of the family actually had seconds.  It's a keeper!

This was amazing! I realized as I was preparing the spice rub that I didn't have seasoning salt on hand. Turns out it's made of basically the same ingredients as those in the spice rub (onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, garlic, salt, and red pepper). So, I slightly increased the amounts of each of the seasonings that the recipe already called for, then added some sea salt and cayenne pepper (I didn't have red in my cabinet, either).  I also used boneless chops and grilled over direct heat. This will definitely be on the menu again!

The flavor of the chops was awesome. Everybody in my family loved these, and I was happy that it's something I could throw together without having to wait hours on a marinade.

I used smoked paprika because I couldn't find my regular paprika (how am I out of paprika?!), and it just added to the smokiness.  I probably used too much garlic and onion powder for the liquid because my rub was very thick (there's a story behind this) and didn't spread very well. I also should have doubled the recipe because I only had enough to cover one side of five sirloin chops I used.

Despite my ingredient foibles, it's earned a spot on the recipe clipboard where I keep all of our favorite recipes.

Super easy and very flavorful.  I made it exactly as written, though I had to add a little water (about 1T) to get the right consistency.  I let the mixture sit on the chops about 15 mins while I got the rest of the meal together.  I do have to say that 12 mins per side is way too long.  I had them on the grill about 18 mins total and they would have been a little more moist if I had gotten them off 1 min earlier.  I'll definitely be making these a lot this summer!

This recipe is great but I think next time I won't use as much pepper. Maybe a bit too salty and cut the pepper in half for sure, it was way too spicy for my daughter. Other than that the flavor was great. I followed the recipe and grilled the pork chops.

I have to make extra from now on because my husband and 2 children fought over the last pork chop the first time I made it! I added a little bit more liquid smoke, and didn't have any paprika, but it came out perfectly on the grill!!! I also used this rub on chicken breasts on the grill, and I nearly fell out of my chair at how delicious it came out!! Next time, I'm going to use the rub on chicken and throw it in the oven, see how it turns out.

I loved the taste but would recommend sprinkling the pork chops with the liquid smoke and worchestershire sauce then sprinkling with the mixture of dry ingredients.  When done like the recipe calls for, the mixture becomes a globby mess.

Pretty good seasoning mix, and the chops were wonderfully-flavored.  Spices were lumpy, which made them hard to spread.  I ended up adding lemon juice and olive oil to make it wetter--and then had to rub them all over again.  So that was not much fun, and it took a long time.  End product was excellent!  We did grill only 5 minutes per side since ours were thin and boneless.  Our experience with pork is that it definitely needs less time than you think.

This is so easy and delicious! I love it so much I actually made this dry rub in bulk so I can just shake a bit of it into a bowl and add my warchester and liquid smoke... Definitely a meal my entire family loves! It's very juicy and tender great with baked potatoes and a salad!!! ??

Like some of the others, I dipped the chops in the mixture first then sprinkled in the spices. My husband who doesn't like thick chops said it was the best pork chops he has ever had. Definitely will make them again.

Liked this a lot!  Made a paste out of the wet and dry ingredients.  Used four medium-thick bone-in chops.  Ran out of propane and couldn't grill them outside so cooked them inside on the Foreman for 8 minutes.  Very good!  Would make again.

I would recommend a tablespoon of water to the mixture if you want to make the paste less pastey. Th flavor is amazing though and definitely going to be my default for pork chops from now on.

I am not a big pork chop fan, but these were some of the best I have ever had. The paste is a bit tricky to keep on the chop though, maybe adding some oliive oil might help. I also used smoked paprika. DELICIOUS

Great Flavor!  I added some olive oil to the mix so it would spread easier.  I was trying to calculate the mix for 8 medium sized chops and next time i will just double the whole recipe because the more marinade, the better.  Excellent flavor and i hardly ever use liquid smoke and in this recipe it works to perfection. I cut down on the pepper from other posters suggestions and other than that i followed recipe exactly and adjusted grilling time according to the thickness of my chops.    Additional review April 2018-  due to weather I baked indoors and I didn't find the same result.  Maybe I should've covered and baked slower and longer but meat was a little tough and not as moist as on grill.  Probably with some adjustments they would turn out better indoors.

I made this recipe as stated except that I didn't grill them (sheer laziness lol!) but I did pan fry them and then finish them off in the oven. This rub is very tasty. It will be something that I will make again.

Great marinade. Used garlic purée instead of powder, and cut ingredients in half as I was just making two. Otherwise followed directions. Turned out fantastic.

I put this on Iowa chops (really thick, bone-in, center cut chops) and modified the grilling time by shifting them to indirect heat. Fantastic flavor.

making now, I used A.1. dry rub instead of lowerys but other than that followed exactly and the rub itself smelled delish! just checked them omg they look and smell like steak!!  I did buy chops at our local meat market, not Wal-Mart or homeland, which I think will make a big difference. not sure what was meant by "indirect heat" so I've got my grill on low. serving Mac and cheese, black eye peas and rolls. just flipped them omg can't wait they smell so good. I've never actually grilled pork chops before, only fried or baked. I don't have a meat thermometer either so just going to have to eyeball it lol. I will say even if the don't taste good they certainly look pretty on a serving plate. oh my God!!!! these are the best pork chops I've ever eaten in my life! tender moist, they taste just like steak! Will never eat pork chops any other way again.

We replaced the seasoned salt with Mrs. Dash Original.  All other ingredients as listed.  I had no trouble with the small amount of liquid in the dry ingredients.  Made it just moist enough to rub in nicely.  Cooking time was too long.  Some of the rub burned.  Lower heat and less time next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

LauraLee6's review said it all for me. Was my first time using liquid smoke and I thought maybe I did something wrong when the rub was more of a paste but I really loved it. I actually like the rub that way not dry. I used thick chops like recipe said and grilled them , though only 8 min b/c my grill is old and not perfect in temp.   Very good rub. Have saved it for future dinners. Thanks!!

Made this as a quick week day dinner. Didn't have liquid smoke but it is pretty flavorful without it. I would let the chops sit in the Worcestershire first and hen apply the rub. It doesn't seem like the flavor comes out as much as it could because it just ends up clumping the mixture. Also the cook time is WAY too long. I had my grill at medium heat (about 350) and I even only cooked them 9 minutes on each side and they got fairly dried out. The flavor is good but would definitely do 5 minutes each side if your grill is nice and hot.

I saw the reviews about separating the liquid and dry ingredients but I decided to follow the original recipe.  I rinsed the chops off but the rub still didn't stick well, when I turned them over it stuck to the plate, so they only had rub (in spots) on one side.   That said, these were still delicious.  We kind of scraped (the pieces or chunks) of the rub off and these still had great flavor.  My husband used the leftovers to make a pork sandwich the next day for lunch and he said they were even better.  It's nice to have a different grilled pork chop recipe!  Next time I will try dipping in liquid mixture then sprinkling with spices and see if we like that way anymore.

This was awesome. The rub was perfect. I did mix the wet and dry ingredients and it was  the perfect consistency. I have a large family so I doubled the recipe. I also added the tip of  grilling on aluminum foil. The last 5 minutes I removed the chops from the aluminum foil and cooked them directly on the grill.  My picky family loved it.

I started with brining my pork chops for 2 hours. When ready to grill I mixed the liquid smoke and worcestershire and rubbed on pork chops. Followed by mixing all dry ingredients in a shaker jar cutting salt back to 1 tsp due to brining and just sprinkled the seasonings on both sides of the pork chops. Grilled indirect about 5 minutes on each side. Pork chops were reading between 160-170 degrees and I was afraid they were over cooked but they were perfect - I think they would have been dry at that temp had I not brined them first. Excellent flavor! Will make again.

I did find it challenging to rub the damp spices into the pork chops, as the seasoning on the bottom side of the chop kept transferring to the cutting board.  Light bulb - I held a chop straight up and down between my hands and rubbed the seasoning in circles.  For all that work, unfortunately I wasn't pleased with the results.  The seasoning was so strong it detracted from the taste of the pork, and had an artificial flavor, at least to my tastebuds.  At least my husband liked it!

This was very good.  It was somewhat on the salty side (and we used Lawry's), so next time I will reduce it by 1 tsp to see if that works.  Also did as another reviewer suggested, and dipped the pork chops in the liquid (w. sauce and liquid smoke) mixture, and then rubbed on the dry mixture.  Used boneless 3/4" pork chops and grilled for about 15 min.

cooked for less time than suggested.HINT, you need to wet them as mentioned so the rub will penetrate and work easily with you as it is a dry rub~

Used 'Spike' seasoning instead of the 'LAWRY'S'. Used garlic salt instead of garlic powder (less than a tbsp) and did not use the 'smoke flavor' as I cooked the pork chops on a charcoal Weber grill.  Plenty of smoke flavor already.  The indirect method is definitely the way to go.  They were moist and tasted great!

Very good grilled pork chop recipe.  Quick and easy!
One change I will make next time is to add a little more Worcestershire sauce.  The mixture was too 'pasty' and was had to spread across the chops.  It needs to be more liquid to spread better, even with the wet chops.

We absolutely loved these! I changed it a little bit and used boneless pork chops and added a small amount of BBQ sauce to the mix to make it a little easier to spread it on. We've had them twice and will be making them again tomorrow.

I needed to find a BBQ recipe for Bone-in Pork Chops because of a power failure. Found this recipe. I let the chops 'sit' in the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke while hubby got the BBQ out and ready and I mixed up the dry ingredients. Used Sea Salt instead of Seasoned salt and used Smoked Paprika since that's what I have in the house. Otherwise kept the measurements and all else the same. Rubbed the dry onto the chops, let them sit 10 minutes then put them on the grill. Grilled less than time stated because the chops weren't thick. These were by far the BEST pork chops I have ever made. Hubby was still raving about them the next day. They were moist and oh, so flavorful. Used Centre Cut bone-in chops. You can be sure I'll be making them again. Will try in the oven to see how they turn out that way. Many thanks for a great recipe!

I'm rating this a 4 but my husband would give it a 5---so we are in between on this one.  It was easy, using ingredients I always have on hand with the exception of the liquid smoke (which I never have on hand because I don't like the fake taste of it).  While we did lose some of the rub into the grill, we still had plenty left to get the full flavor of it.  I followed the directions on how to use the wet rub, and it did work.  Thanks for a nice dinner tonight!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY as written - delicious and can't wait to make again.  I didn't have time to let it set in and marinade - just threw them on the grill after massaging spices in and they were still delicious.  Can't wait to try again and let it sit for a bit before grilling

This recipe turned out delicious and flavorful even though I only let the chops marinade for 1 hour. I found that adding a few teaspoons of ground mustard really helped the flavor pop!   Will make again without a doubt.

Loved this, and made as directed. Next time will probably add just a little brown sugar to give it a bit of sweetness. Very good and will definitely make again.

I made this for the 4th of July and it was great! The only affordable/decent looking meat I could find at the market was a package of 7 large pork chops (I waited too long to go shopping and what's up with the price of meat these days) and at first I wasn't too excited about grilling pork chops for the 4th but when I looked up recipes and saw this one it sounded good and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard.  Boy, what a treat!  I made it exactly as specified (doubled as I had twice the meat) and didn't have any trouble with the rub.  Everyone loved them and I will make this again.  My husband's only question was if he was supposed to put the lid on the grill or cook them without it.  He did end up using the lid on the grill.

Since this isn't a dry rub, it was very difficult to spread on the chops, or to get it to stick properly.  The taste was alright, but not my favorite.

Followed the recipe exactly.

I liked the over all flavor of the recipe but I thought it was just a bit too salty. Will reduce the salt the next time I make this!

Absolutely delicious, my entire family loves this rub on pork steaks, chops, or ribs. Perfect for the grill and sure to satisfy everyone. I enjoy using it on farm fresh pork with a homemade Lawry's substitute consisting of sea salt, turmeric, and paprika I found on-line for a completely additive free meal. I'd rate this A++!

Good flavor, liquid smoke added nice flavor just be careful it is a strong flavor for our taste, we also added cayenne for our  taste. Overall we will continue make.

UPDATE: We remade & added cayenne & this time Adobe powder , for our taste which is spicy it really made for a good flavor,  we also had to make them in  the oven I know the site says to cook @ 350 for 55min but I feel they'll be to well done cause we cooked 7 chops for 25min @ 375 & they were done a little much for me, so check your oven & chops if you cook using this method as all oven's aren't the same, some are faster. Also we cut down on liquid smoke a bit. As I put last time we will continue to make chops (costco) using this recipe.

I subsiuted 1/2 paprika and 1/2 smoked paprika.  Also, I only cooked them 7-8 min per side.  They were delicious.

These were great pork chops. I followed the recipe without any changes, although I did forget to rinse the chops before applying the rub; they still come out nicely. I will make this again!

Good flavor but a bit dry. I made a quick sauce of BBQ sauce and paprika to help it out. Would not cook it again. IeEven undercooked the time and temp. But it was a nice flavor.

First of I have to say that I baked and not grilled the chops at 350 degrees for 15 min per side.  The taste was good and I followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless pork chops.  What lacked was the appearance. Looks absolutly nothing like the photo. It looked like the meat had been rolled around in the sand. I get the grill marks but how do you get the glaze?  Any suggestions?  I will try again on the grill next time.

These were really great! Like others though the marinade was a little gritty. I added olive oil and a bit of water to make it more of a sauce and the pork chops turned out great. I might recommend marinating for a bit longer than 10 minutes, so that the meat was a little more flavorful rather than it being like a coating only on the outside.

Had to use up some pork chops.  Not exactly my favorite food.  Found this in my search for an easy prep and something the hubby could do on the grill.  Prepared exactly as written.  We both loved them.  Will be making again for sure.

Really good rub. Hubby wants to try on ribs & pork roast also.  Quick & easy, but I thought to salty for us b/c of health so will try 1 tsp seasoned salt next time.  Keeper.

A nice flavor in the rub, but the flavor didn't penetrate the meat.  I will try it again in the future, giving the rub hours rather than minutes to do its magic.  It may be a 5 star recipe with just that one simple adjustment.

This is a great recipe we loved the flavor and it is so easy to prepare. I cannot wait to make it again. I did not have Worcester sauce so I used balsamic vinegar and it worked great.  But next time I will use the original recipe to decide which way we like it.  Thanks for the recipe

Very good and easy to make....I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.....next time I make it though I will definitely cut down on the Season Salt.  We found it to be very salty.  Still enjoyed it, will just be gulping the water tonight ;-)  Thanks for the recipe!  Will def make again!

The only thing I would suggest is to start the cook direct for a short period of time. Turning once to sear both sides and then move to indirect.I also use fruit wood to smoke. No need to soak.Double thicks are fun to try also. Apples, onion and all sorts of other things can be inserted in a small cut through the side of the chop. I definitely like bone in for the extra flavor.Great recipe!

Wow, I really wanted this to work in re/ to the great reviews.  It was a tad salty but the biggest issue was putting it on the meat which was not easy. It was such a glob and 1/2 of it remained on my hands!   Flavors were great ... I baked mine .... perfectly executed.  I think I would develop it into a marinade. I can see where it would be good on chicken and steak.

I made this last night. It was a Huge hit. I did a little modification. I used 2 table spoons of  Worchester Sauce and 2  tablespoons of the liquid smoke. It made a moist  paste. I wet the chops and lavished 4 butterflied chops with the mixture. I let them sit for an hour and a half in the frig. My husband grilled them for 12 minutes on each side. They were so moist and the flavor was incredible .   I highly recommend this recipe!

Followed the directions and patted the smoky spice rub into the chops, let them sit for 10 minutes and my husband grilled them --- delicious!  Not a bit dry and so, so easy!  We'll make these again.

Great flavor! OP is dead on with indirect cooking time as well. Very moist and tender. Awesome recipe!

** Update ** this same rub is fantastic on a "beer can chicken" as well.  Try it!

Liquid Smoke?  Really?   
It was over cooked at 12 min per side.

I'd actually give it 4 1/2 if I could, but it was really good.  Pork is usually dry and tasteless and this was pretty darn good!  My boys liked it too.  (16 and 19 y/o)  I followed the recipe exactly.

This was an okay recipe for me.  I did not use the liquid smoke but otherwise followed the recipe to a T and it was so salty. My boyfriend said it was good, but for me, someone who doesn't use a lot of salt and pepper normally, this is very salty. A good concept though.

BANGIN!!!!!!!!! Excellent flavor!!!!!!! so easy, very tasty. Was also worried about the paste, but if you just rub it in, the flavor stays on all sides of chop. Used boneless chops, Temp is the way to know if your meat is done.

Way to strong.  I use liquid smoke in a lot of things but this paste was just to strong.  Maybe if used sparingly.

Well I tried this recipe today and I must say that yes it was very spicy. I really think there is enough spice rub for about 12 pork chops.I like the flavor and chops were very juicy.The cooking time was why to long, about 7 minutes a side would be better. I may try this again with a lot of changes. I really am surprised at how many people gave this recipe 5 stars.

Taste was good but I agree with others that it was difficult to apply. And yes, I massaged it into the chops for a long time.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I liked it a lot only it was just a bit too salty for my liking.  I am not salt sensitive nor do I watch it for health reasons.  It was just salty on the tongue.  I will definitely make it again and either cut back on seasoned salt or substitute kosher salt.

I used pork steaks, I applied the wet and dry ingredients seperate because I season my meat according to its thickness, and I seared on a stovetop griddle and finished in 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Rating just the flavor, it was excellent! The combination is perfect and I cannot wait to put it on EVERYTHING that I grill! Seasoned salt is a tricky beast so use it according to taste.

I was surprised, this was really good.  I didn't have liquid smoke so I made it without.  Like others, I put the Worcestershire sauce on the chops then sprinkled the seasoning on and rubbed it in.  Not sure how long I grilled them, I just checked them to be sure they were done.  Lot more flavor than I expected, I'm usually one to marinate meat but this will be a regular in my rotation.  Thanks!

It's really the best recipe. I had out of town guests who loved the chops. I rubbed the Worcestershire and liquid smoke first and then rubbed the dry mixture on the chops.  I ended up with more mixture than I could use even though I didn't have the salt seasoning. So there was some wastage. Next time I'd probably make less rub.

Minus the liquid smoke it was great. Decided to just let my Traeger do it's job and add the smoky flavor for me. Big hit,! Can't say if I added exact measurements. I didn't take the time it get out teaspoons and tablespoons - just eye balled it. And went on to rubbing the meat down. Sure the texture lacked liquid and was griddy and dry but I wasn't looking for a marinade I warned something that would stay while the pork smoked. Will use this again with my minor alteration - perhaps an addition if I have a brilliant idea between now and then :)

we did enjoy the chops but found them to be too salty.. wish i would have seen those comments warning of this.. not just the positive ones at the top of the reviews.. added water to make it a bit more of a marinade.. i'd just reduce the seasoned salt next time.. ty for the recipe

great recipe! Substituted smoked paprika for the regular paprika, and didn't add liquid smoke.

This is a great way to make flavorful pork chops!  I made it exactly as written, except I didn't rinse the chops first, lately "they" are saying that rinsing meat just spreads bacteria in your sink/counters, and anything on the outside of the meat is easily burned off.  We grilled asparagus and french bread to serve with it.  Nice dinner!

Need to try it without mixing the wet/dry rub but, overall, fantastic! Think 12 minutes is way too long. I went 2 min/side sear and then 7 minutes indirect medium.

My wife, who hates pork, devoured her serving. Crazy!

Made these tonight and they were scrumptious! I used 4 boneless loin chops, and did the wet separate from the dry. They took approximately 16 minutes over medium heat on a gas grill. I'll definitely be making these again!

I seasoned this according to the recipe but reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp.  I used my cast iron grill pan to sear the chops 3 or 4 minutes per side and then finished them in the oven at 375 degrees for approximately 15 minutes until they reached 145 degrees.  They were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.

This has become a staple repeat in our household. It's amazing on pork chops but we have also used it on chicken as well. It's not spicy and the liquid smoke makes it taste so good. We didn't use Lawrys because I didn't have it but I substituted this with the original Goya Adobo and we actually like it better. It has a great combo of sweet smokiness with salty flavor.

Delicious. I've been wanting to try using liquid smoke, and I was delighted with the way this turned out.  I followed the directions as written and combined the liquid and dry ingredients. It ended up being a paste. I did double up on the ingredients for the coating because it seems like I never have enough coating.  I realized after doing it that I didn't need to in this case.  If you rub it in good the pork chop will only hold so much.  It's winter and there's snow on the grill, so I fried these in just a little vegetable oil.  They turned out really good. I would make this again, for sure.

Great taste. I followed the recipe exactly and had trouble spreading the spices after adding the wet ingredients. Next time I will dampen the chops with the wet ingredients then rub with the dry.

Awesome!!! I have made this twice now and it was so easy, quick and delicious. I rinsed the chops and then covered with the rub. I combined the liquid and dry ingredients and they clung to the meat perfectly. It could be because I rinsed the meat though. I pan fried two to eat then and baked the others for leftovers! So good!

I cut the ingredients down to grill one pork chop and it was wonderful!! I'm thinking about mixing up the dry ingredients and storing in a jar so that I need only add the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke when I'm ready for the rub.

Totally agree that grilling (gas) time is WAY too Long - 5 min. per side is plenty for 1" thick chops. Let them rest 8-10" and they will be fully cooked, juicy and delicious!

Very good. I love the combination of flavors mixed with the smoky taste. So yummy! Very easy to make and scale to the amount of people to serve. Mine came out a bit dry, but I think because I overcooked them a bit, whoops. Definitely will keep for future use!

This recipe was awesome, and so easy. I made the paste like the recipe called for and just massaged it into the chops. The only change I made was that I used smoked paprika.

We really liked the flavor and color of the chops made with this rub; however, the end result was much too salty for our liking.  I double checked - used garlic powder. Liked the rest though, so will try halving the seasoning salt and increasing the onion and garlic powder to make up for the volume.

Excellent recipe that needs very little tweaking.  I did cut down on the salt (personal preference) and I also dipped the pork in the wet ingredients first per others suggestions.  I may cut down the pepper a bit as my husband thought it was a tad spicy.

I did use boneless on the this side pork chops and adjusted cooking times accordingly.

We prepped the pork chops ahead of time and took them up to our neighborhood pool to grill. My husband loved them. I'm not as huge a fan of pork chops in general, but I liked the smoky flavor here and thought they were a nice change from the usual hamburger and hot dog routine.

We made this last night, wanting something a bit "different." We were NOT disappointed at all :o)  Very tasty - the chops needing nothing else and they were the star of the dinner.  My husband did add just a bit of butter to the meat as he grilled it, but that was only because they were very lean boneless chops and he didn't want they to dry out.  We'll definitely be having this again.

I made the mistake of not checking to see if I had all the ingredients before starting. I could have sworn I had liquid smoke on hand. I added a teaspoon of hickory salt and a little soy sauce. I spread it evenly on the pork. This was excellent. Will definitely make it again, next time using liquid smoke.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was just ok. The kids said it was too strong and my husband said it was too salty.  All in all I think the flavor was ok, but it was just too strong.  Less of a flavor enhancer and more of the main event.

Fantastic! Another winner for weeknight meal-in-a-hurry! A recipe with things I've always got in my pantry and that I can throw together in no time. I took others advice and used the wet ingredients as a base for the dry rub and then threw my 1-inch thick chops under the broiler (since it's February and about 40 outside) for about 5-6 minutes on each side. Perfect! Combined with some mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and a salad and even my 3-year old was asking for seconds!

We made these pork cops yesterday and they were so delicious. I did not have the bone in thick porck chops and mine were a little dry because I did not reduce the cook time but this is a new favorite in this household.

These were great and really quick to make, just very salty. Next time I'm gonna use only 1/2 tbsp of seasoning salt.

Very good! I'll probably use half the salt and fresh garlic next time, but this has nice flavor as written.

A little salty for my tastes, but my family absolutely loved it. It was very easy and quick to make, which is a plus. I didn't have onion powder, but they still liked it.

Very easy and super tasty.  I thought it was really salty though, so next time a lot less season salt and more of the others spices.

Made the recipe pretty much as is, and found this was quick and easy to make, as well as tasty!  I didn't measure the ingredients and substituted seasoned salt with kosher salt. I didn't have bone in chops, but used boneless chops and/ eyeballed the ingredients, sprinkled the dry seasoning on both sides of the meat and rubbed on both sides.  For the dry seasonings, I used just about the same measurements as what the recipe calls for the pepper, garlic, onion, and paprika.  I used approximately 1/2 tsp kosher salt total for all 3 chops and omitted the worcestershire sauce only because I ran out of it the other day.  I used 2-3 drops of liquid smoke p/chop, dashed on one side of the chop only and rubbed in.  I'll just have to go with mixing all the ingredients next time and spreading it on both sides.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I actually didn't have Worcestershire sauce but I used Teryaki sauce and followed the rest of the recipe to a T and it came out awesome. Hubby loved it! Will definitely be using this again!

KEEPER!!  I didn't change anything!  I just used my hands to coat my chops with this wet rub.  It stayed on and the taste is incredible.  Using this all the time for chops!!

My family's favorite Pork Chops. I was asked to keep this recipe handy by my wife. So that made it a home run.
