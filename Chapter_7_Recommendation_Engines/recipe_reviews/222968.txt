I was short on time, so I wasn't able to simmer for 2 hours, but it was fantastic.   It had some kick, probably just enough.   This recipe could be easily adapted for many tastes.   You could add in bacon or broccoli or mushrooms, as some have suggested and this would be just elevated to a new level.   Topping with cheese is essential.

This was a fantastic dinner and we all loved it. I followed everything, including a two hour simmering with the sauce, but did throw in some slice mushrooms that had to be used or they were heading to the compost. They were a very nice addition. My shrimp was fresh so I just tossed it in the sauce the last few minutes until it pinked up. I'm keeping this one on a rotation for our household. Thanks Foodie.

My husband & I loved this!  Only changes were, simmered for 30 minutes, only had one can chopped tomatoes so added one ripe tomato plus one can tomato sauce.   Used whole wheat pasta. Pretty spicy like we like. If you have concerns, cut back half on the red pepper flakes.

I really liked this, but my husband found it too spicy for his taste.  Next time I make this, I will cut back on the crushed red pepper.

Fantastic recipe!  Instead of using diced tomatoes I used stewed ones.

This turned out great. I used dry parsley and Italian seasoning which was a good substitute for the fresh. I also added a small can of tomato sauce  to round out the flavors.

Not much flavor for such a long cooking time, and I even doubled the basil and oregano.  I probably won't make this one again.

I used Jalape√±o Diced Tomatoes, added mushrooms and some sugar in the raw-was a little tart for me. Used Vegetable Penne pasta.

Yum. Just enough heat, plenty of flavor.  Used several veggies and herbs from the garden so it was extra special.  Next time I plan to spiralize zucchini rather than using pasta.

This was a great dish. Spicy and refreshingly delicious. I made this for date night and both my husband and I enjoyed it. The two changes I made are using an orange pepper instead of a green one because that's what was in our fridge and adding 4oz of Clamato. I was unable to simmer for two hours so I boiled it a bit more aggressively and needed to add some liquid.

I loved this even more than I expected so I had to write a review.  I didn't have any wine on hand so I used 1 cup of Ginger Ale instead (since I was adding Broccoli, I thought  a little extra liquid would be good ). Worked great ! Also steamed some fresh broccoli and put that in the pot the last 10 minutes along with the "uncooked" shrimp. After shrimp cooked through , I threw in the pasta.  Was delish ! Restaurant quality. Followed everything else . Already called my sister and told her about it!     Thanks!
