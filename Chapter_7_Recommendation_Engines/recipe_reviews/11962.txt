My kids loved this recipe.  That is quite an accomplishment for both of them to rate something 5 stars.  After converting the macaroni from ounces to cups, 1/2 of a cup did not seem like a lot.  I decided to add 1 cup of macaroni instead.  I also added fresh garlic and Italian seasoning.  My youngest son actually licked his plate clean.  (They did not know that mayo was in the sauce which they have stated they hate.)  I did add only a half an onion (another deal breaker with the kids.)  Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty meal!!

Added extra macaroni and spices. Used a mexican cheese blend that I had on hand. My kids (2 & 4) are picky eaters and I heard "a-licious" and "this is yummy" from them.

My husband loved this! He is my picky eater. I added a few things...pepper, italian seasoning, garlic garlic (tastefully simple brand), and about a half of a jar of pacante sauce.  I also used large elbow macaroni. My husband said he wants it twice a week!

It's good.  I think i'll try using Sour Cream instead of mayo just to try something new.  If I do that, i'll also use the mexican cheese suggestion made by others.

Very good and quick recipe. I cut back on the amount of sauce and used tomato and basil sauce and used ground turkey instead of beef. I left out the onion and used onion powder and Italian seasoning instead. Once everything was cooked I mixed it altogether and stirred in the shredded cheese. Wonderful! And plenty for left-overs!

I rarely post a review, but this recipe was so disgusting I had to say something. The mayo is a VERY strong flavor in this, and I enjoy the taste of mayo. It was also very much unnecessary. I doubled the macaroni and added cheese on top, and thank goodness I did or I don't think I would have been able to choke this down.  I will never make this again. Simply changing the mayo to low fat sour cream would have improved this recipe immensely.

Good, basic meal.  My son and his friend had seconds - always a good sign.  I doubled the amount of pasta and added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to taste, as suggested by other reviewers.  Will definitely make again.

I was struggling to make something for dinner with next to no ingredients in the house before grocery shopping day, this meal was perfect. The only thing I changed was instead of mayo (which sounded just a little too odd for me to get over), I used sour cream  some others had suggested. I don't know what it tastes like with mayo, but the sour cream was extremely good and I am more than critical of my own cooking.

I had high hopes for this easy ground beef dish, but none of my kids would eat it, and they're not picky.  I wasted a perfectly good pound of organic beef.

This was a really fast and easy meal!  Just what I was looking for to use up the last of my ground beef.  Was really tasty!  I doubled the recipe and I did add some extra seasoning as suggested: onion powder, garlic salt and italian seasoning.  The taste of the mayo was delish!  Family loved it!

This is a simple recipe.  I used less mayo since I had bought an off brand.  I think if your gonna use the mayo you need to buy the good stuff because you can definitely taste it.  Plus im on a diet so the calories of adding it weren't necessary.  Overall not bad.  Something to do if you have kids and are in a hurry.

This was delicious! I have to admit that the picture which is showed with this recipe doesn't do it any justice, and I almost passed it by, but after reading the ingredient list, I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! I didn't tweak the recipe other than adding a little extra cheese and a sprinkle of Italian seasoning while browning the ground beef, though I do believe I should have increased the macaroni to almost twice as much as called for. Either way, Its a keeper!

Hearty dish for the guys building the pole barn! Added some crushed garlic and oregano to add a little spice, and I will probably use a bit less mayo next time. Otherwise, it is a keeper!

This recipe is good, but more for kids. I wouldn't say it is much different from normal goulash. I used veggie crumbles and it still worked fine.

This was so good, don't let the mayo throw you off. It really is the key ingredient. I used Hellman's LF mayo and my 4 yr. old ate 2 helpings. Will make again! I used a little more mayo and macaroni than it called for.

The mayonaisse was not good in this at all...The taste really was not good.  Do not use mayo and do not use real garlic! I honestly wouldnt have made it if I knew it tasted this way! I'm not usually this harsh.  Thumbs waaaay down on this one! My husband said it was the worst thing I have EVER made!

A great comfort food for a cold, winter day and easy to make when you're tired from work. The men loved this because of the meat and heartiness of it. I thought 1/2 cup of mayonaisse was a little too much. I recommend 3/4 cup and I didn't use all the spaghetti sauce either.

It was an "ok" recipe.  The pasta sauce and mayo combo made the dish taste like creamy tomato soup, but thicker and with an hint of italian flavors.  Although my kids liked the dish I didn't care for it.

This recipe was right up my alley!  Quick and easy to make plus my family LOVED it!!!!  My husband and daughter are very picky eaters and they both gobbled this up.  I followed the recipe as it was but took advice of others and added garlic salt and italian seasoning.  We ate ours with garlic bread, yum!

I will for sure make this one again and again!!!!

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and put in some fresh minced garlic and Italian seasoning.  This is a simple, fast meal that anyone would like.  The shredded cheese on top isn't mandatory, but is a nice touch if you want it.

If you like "beefy mac-n-cheese" then you'll like this recipe.  Sorry, but I didn't like this combination and the mayo is just extra fat/calories not needed in this recipe.

Pretty tasty! I used mushroom spaghetti sauce. I think it should have just a touch more macaroni, maybe 1/4 cup. I think kids would go crazy over this and its an easy weeknight dinner.
