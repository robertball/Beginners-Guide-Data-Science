I'm sorry, but we did not care for this recipe. It was bitter and sour. Mahi Mahi is one of my families favorite seafood dish and we all left half the fish on our plates - not a good sign.

I also found it bitter and sour.  There is no BODY to this recipe.  I saved my fillets by sauteing the onions in a little butter.  Then tossing in the fillets when onions are soft.
Sprinkled little McCormick's Garlic Salt on top.  Sauted for 1-2 minutes.  Topped with graded parmesan cheese.  YUMMY.  now..NO LEFTOVERS.

A beautiful presentation with the lemons on the fish and sprinkled with the oregano.  

I served the fish with rice and a spinach/strawberry salad.

Nice flavor on the fish, next time I will marinade longer.  I marinaded about 2 hours, but the flavors could have been stronger.

I have to agree, it was quite sour. The rum overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the fish. It was not well liked by the family. Sorry!

After reading slot of the reviews I saw what the major problems and was able to fix them:
First the very bitter taste. The best way to balance the bitter is to add sugar I added about a table spoon of sugar sprinkeld over the fish.
Second the bland flavor: I added crushed pepper and Parmesan cheese.
Lastly one big mastake I saw people make was letting it sit in the marnade for way to long. Lemon juce will cook the fish and that will make it dry after u cook it. I only let it sit for an hour and it still had the lemon and rum flavor. 

After all that it ended up tasting awesome and flavorful.

I thought this was a fabulous recipe! I marinated the fish for only two hours and it was well flavored. My husband loved it! Definitely a keeper for our house.

I tried it and was not impressed.  Not sure how "authentic" it is, but it's not as good as the Ginger Glazed recipe that appears here also.

I didn't care for the blandly-sour flavor that the marinade produced, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.  It was nice having something other than our standard, oven-baked fish.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good Recipe for first-time cooking Mahi Mahi.  Adding Meyer's Dark rum and lime juice worked well for us, as those are two primary ingredients we use for our Mai Tais (recommended beverage)

Used lemon-herb mix for topping after marinating.  Our kids (10/7) loved this fish!

I have this same exact recipe but not sure where I got it.   Mine is slightly different with measurements and we loved it.   Maybe next time you decide to make it use my changes instead.   I used 2 large mahi mahi steaks, 1/4 cup of dark rum and 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice and no lemon slices.

I saw this recipe and wanted to try it but after reading several of the reviews I decided to try some key lime/mango juice I had rather than lime juice alone.  I marinated for 2 hours and it was very good.  The mango took the edge off the citrus.  Next time I will put a dash of salt on each filet though and marinate maybe 3 hours.

Ok. So i didn't take the time to marinade the fish. But it was really good. Even my picky 3 year old loved it.  I only used 1/4 cup of rum and added some garlic.  I put the fish in the pan, added fresh shrimp and just dumped all the ingredients on top. Baked it for about 25 minutes and everything came out great. We served it over rice.

This was OK with some changes.  First, I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and mixed it with the lime juice and marinated the fish for 8 hours.  The spices from the rum cut through some of the tangy flavor from the lime juice.  I also dressed the fish in oregano and pepper before topping it with lemon and butter so the sauce and seasonings would be more flavorful.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes-it was pretty good.

I put this to marinade at 11 and cooked it at 4.  "No Taste" as my husband said.  I found it palatable when I pressed the fish into the lemon slice and then dipped it in tartar sauce - which I only had for the kids' fish sticks.  Admittedly, I did use white rum, since it was all I had on hand, and, perhaps, it would have made a difference; I don't know.  I will not be making this again.  It was VERY easy, but without taste, it's just not worth it.

I made what I believe to be a critical error when preparing this recipe.  Without the error, it's quite possible I may have been able to rate it five stars.  As it is, I'm being generous in giving it three stars.  As a fair compromise, I'm giving this dish four stars.  My mistake was forgetting the butter as I prepared the fish for the oven.  The butter would have given the fish a richer, fuller flavor - no doubt.  As it was, the marinade, spices, lemon and onion provided a decent flavor, but I have a feeling the butter would have put it over the top.  Next time I won't argue with my wife until I'm DONE cooking!

Sorry, too bitter for our taste. I felt bad for wasting this otherwise wonderful fish.
On the up-side, this was very easy to prepare.

This was a really good and flavorful recipe, but the timing or temp is definitely off.  I would suggest putting the oven to at least 350 and be prepared to leave it in the oven for a longer period of time.  Try it with frozen veggies cooked in a little bit of olive oil!

Either the cooking time or oven temp are off on this recipe.  After 10 min in a 325
oven the butter on top of the fish had just started to melt and the fish had barly 
started to cook.  The onions slices are a bit confusing too... sliced thin or thick?
The ingredients call for thin sliced and the directions call for a thick slice.

Adding the small red potatos to the dish sounded very good.

I didn't like this at all. My husband thought it was so-so. It was flavorless yet had an odd twang, we think it was the oregano. It was easy to make and it did smell very good, other than that not a keeper for me.

Not very good. After marinating overnight it came out extremely bland with almost no taste to it. I thought this would better but it just was not, sad since hubby and I love fish so much.

Very good.  We don't drink, so we never have rum around.  Instead, I diluted molasses with pineapple juice (about 50/50).  Also, I forgot to put the butter on the fish.  It was still great, and lower fat, too.  I bet this sauce mixture would be great on chicken, too.

Yum!  All gone! I even over-cooked it a bit, and the top was a tad dry (I lost track of the time... a rummy issue..), but inside it was moist and flavorful even with the measly 1/2 hour I gave it to marinade.

This was a huge hit!  Make sure you turn the fish at least once while it's marinating.  Cook at 350 (not 325) if you have a thick fillet.

My husband and I baked small red potatoes with the fish (we substituted tilapia for the mahi mahi). The rum and lime juices really soaked in and made everything so tasty. A yummy meal!

This was a wonderful recipe that I had the opportunity to try through someone else.  As a result, I am now a member of myrecipe.com.  I have served this to friends along with a lightly buttered and seasoned pasta and broccoli side dish and garden salad.  There were no left overs.

I loved having an alternative way to prepare mahi mahi other than the standard "grill" method.  I served it with long grain rice and salad!  And there weren't any left-overs!

The presentation was nice but the flavor was just "ok" to me.  Also, my husband made the mistake of squeezing the lemon on the fish before he tasted it and overwhelmed the fish. Mahi mahi is a mild fish, therefore, the baked lemon flavor was all it needed.  I may try again and play with different spices and herbs.

If you leave the full amount of liquid and add salt and Marinate it over night it is good.

I loved it, DH said it was OK (but he's not a fish eater by choice)  The flavor is simple, but it goes great with rice pilaf.  We grilled ours on the bbq and basted the marinade as we cooked (we have a cage thing for the bbq)  I'm looking forward to this again this summer.

Well, I don't think I will make this a second time.  The marinade didn't give much flavor to the fish.  I will admit that the rum I used was white, not dark...since that was what I had on hand.  Perhaps the dark rum would have made this a winner?  I'm skeptical.  Thanks anyway...

My rating is based on how it turned out with a few modifications.  For the marinade I used about a cup of orange juice instead of lime juice and 1 oz of Captain Morgan vanilla dark rum. Then I placed the fish on a hickory grilling plank that had been soaked in pineapple/mango juice for two hours and brushed on some melted butter; sprinkled some oregano, crushed red pepper, fresh ground black pepper, raw sugar, and some Himalayan sea salt. And finally I topped it off with a few onion slices and garnished with lime slices. Place on the charcoal grill away from the heat for about 30 mins. Turned out AMAZING!

Maybe it's the rum I use (capt morgan spiced), but every time I have used this recipe the fish has come out tasting like candy. I also use sweet yellow or vidalia onions. I have even used this concoction on blue fish, which not many like at all. It came out great and everyone loved it.

I found this recipe to be bland.  I marinated for 2 hours and used tilapia instead of mahi, but I don't think changing either thing would have mattered.  Not worth the wait in my opinion but very easy.
