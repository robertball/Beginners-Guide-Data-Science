Wow! Easy and by far the best homemade tomato soup I have ever had. I did use garden tomatoes though. I used 3lbs of fresh tomatoes, cored, peeled and then I let them run in the food processor on high for 4 minutes. I used that instead of juice. It had a few seeds that didn't get pulverized but it certainly didn't hurt the soup at all. Also, I added about 1/4 cup of fresh basil chopped up at the point I added the tomato and I let that cook in with it and I used a pinch of baking soda and a tablespoon of sugar to help reduce the acid in the soup. I didn't do it this time but you can also substitute whipping cream for the milk to make it a little more rich. All I can say is awesome Julie! A frozen pizza darn near takes longer to cook than this.

Who needs canned soup!!!  This is delicious and easy to make.  I add the milk after I make the roux and then add a 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice.  It makes the soup much heartier and leaves nice little tomato bits.  I've made this 3x and shared the recipe once...I won't buy canned tomato soup again when this is so easy and good.

My wife suggested cream of tomato soup and this was my first experience making it. I added a carrot, a clove of garlic, and a stalk of celery to the onion sautee and pureed it along with some of the milk and tomato juice before adding it to the roux. Made the roux with the flour and a little corn meal(masarepa) to make it thicker. Also substituted some light cream for some of the milk, and served it topped with fresh, chopped basil and fresh black pepper. No extra salt was required because the tomato juice was salted.

Excellent, thick and creamy. Great on a cold, damp day with roasted potato wedges, crusty bread, and green beans.

There's almost always more than one way to skin a cat, and I kind of took this basic recipe and ran with it.  I have a tomato garden in the back yard, so I blanched, pureed and strained the seeds out to make my own tomato juice.  However, I'm sure it would taste fine with store bought.

I pureed the onion too, to achieve a smoother textured soup.  I used a bit more butter than called for, and I used 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 whole milk for a creamier flavor.  I also added a shot of tabasco, some garlic powder, chicken broth granules instead of salt, and plenty of fresh cracked pepper.
I got to thinking - you could do up a big batch of this without the milk, freeze it in 2 cup sized leftover containers, then reconstitute with milk later.  No more Cambells!  The soup tastes very good.

This soup was fabulous!!  I substituted V-8 Juice for the tomato juice for a little extra spice and it turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

This was a really good cream of tomato soup recipe! I added the milk, and allowed it to cook with the tomato mixture before taking it off of the stove, since I didn't want it to get cold.  I think the next time I make this, I will add the milk first, so it can cook with the roux, then add the tomato.

This is the same recipe I learned in grade 7 home-ec 30 years ago.  I still made it from the original recipe card.  Easy to make changes depending on your mood...garlic, fresh tomato, etc.

All I can say is why would anyone eat canned soup with this easy recipe.  Although I did change it a little it was still very easy and tasty and every one loved it.  Okay for the changes, I used V8 juice (42oz bottle, smallest I could find), so I increased butter and flour to 3T.  I sauted the onion and then added the flour and 1 can (14oz) condensed milk (not sweetened).  Then I added the juice and brought to a light boil. Then I added 1/2 package (8oz) of cream cheese and wisked till smooth. The soup was great.  My husband, who doesn't like tomato soup, said it was "munchable", which is a good thing. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe. I will be making again.

I have a very picky little boy.  He was born a vegetarian and I have trouble finding things he will eat with the rest of the family.  But this soup worked like a charm!  He loves it and so does my daughter.  Jessie Davidian

This was pretty easy and tasty!  However, because of the 10 minutes of cooling time plus the addition of milk, the soup wasn't warm when served.

This is a great starter recipe. However, I do make some changes. First I don't use onion. I add quite a few spices according to taste. Cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, basil, a bay leaf, and a few more depending on my mood. I let it simmer for about 15 or 20 minutes. After that I remove it from the heat and put in about 1/2 tsp or so of baking SODA (to get rid of acidity and to prevent milk from curdling). It gets really bubbly and orange. I stir it around until it settles down(about 2 minutes) Then I put in warmed milk. So much better than canned.

This was a very good base for an excellent soup.  I added a dash of garlic powder, sugar, and tarragon for flavor.  It was superb with some Italian croutons thrown in.  Here is a great tip I've learned too:  whenever a recipe calls for tomato juice, I always use plain canned tomato sauce instead and add some water.  It is really the same thing---just much, much cheaper---and I don't have to worry about it going to waste!

4 stars because of extra ingredients I had to add.  I always have better results taking other reviewers changes and I did use a a few on this one.  I pureed onions and one garlic clove and warmed/sauted, added flour and butter. I pureed two cans of petite diced tomatoes and wisked into previous mixture. Warmed milk and added. I felt there was a lack of tomato flavor so I added 1 6oz tomato paste.  I added a pinch of baking soda and teaspoons of sugar to my liking. I added 4oz of cream cheese as someone else suggested. Added sweet basil, salt and pepper to liking. I had to really play with this to get that classic "Campbell's" like flavor. I made my own tomato soup to evade high fructose corn soup which is one of the 1st ingredients of Campbells. It taste pretty darn good now. Now, gotta make the grilled cheeses of course..yum! Thanks to recipe originator for the recipe.

I did not care for this at all! I was surprised at how many rated this so high. I did not like the chopped onions in it and I am an onion lover! I followed the recipe exactly as stated- did not substitute anything so was very dissapointed.  Campbell's is better!

Don't ask me why, but I was craving cream of tomato soup when I woke up this morning. Granted, it is the heart of summer in Washington DC, almost 100 degrees outside and MUGGY MUGGY MUGGY. Doesn't everyone crave soup in these conditions? Well I must say this hit the spot. I caramelized a giant red onion as others suggested (place onions in the butter, turn heat to low, and cook onions until they begin to stick together, about 20 minutes), added a can of 'stewed tomatoes with celery and bell pepper' when the onions were done, then followed the recipe exactly. I used Campbells Tomato Juice and I used whole milk for a very creamy flavor. My craving for soup in the midst of July was satisfied! This is delicious! (I wish I had some bread and cheese... grilled cheese would be the perfect accompaniment).

This was great but I was looking for the recipe a deli owner had given to me years ago.  It was made with the simplest pasta sauce.  Make the roux with 2 tbs butter, 2 tbs. flour and 2 1/2 c milk.  Once thickened add 1 jar of pasta sauce (plain no meat or vegs) and stir til hot and serve.  It is great.  Thanks for helping me "remember".

Absolutely delicious! Pureed the onions, flour, and a little of the tomato juice in food processor then returned to the pot. (I knew my kids wouldn't even try it if they saw the onions.)Added a little basil and garlic powder. Husband has never liked tomato soup but ate 3 helpings! We topped it with cheese and croutons.

Really easy, creamy, good texture.  As another reviewer pointed out, you will wonder why you would buy canned when this is so easy to make.  One of my 4 year old daughters did not care for the bits of onion, but a second in the blender cured that.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Although this soup is incredibly easy to make, unfortunately the end product tastes like warmed up tomato juice and minced onions and salt.  Even adding the milk to the blend, there was absolutely no flavor.  Won't make this again.

I made this soup this evening and it is not what I was hoping for.  Very bland, tastes like warmed up tomato juice.  I used half and half for a creamier soup and it still didn't help.  Do not recommend this reciepe.

I also made this recipe in the 7th grade cooking class - it has been a family favorite ever since....almost 50 years now! I lost the recipe for awhile and was so happy to find it.   Anyway - if you have someone who doesn't like the onion bits, just strain it.  (We were taught to add the tomato part to the milk part - keeps it from curdling).  You don't want to let it boil, either.  Same reason.  The only difference in the recipe I have, is that it uses 2 C of tomato juice and 2 C milk.  So tasty!

I did not care for this at all.  The tomato juice taste was overpowering, and it needed reheating after adding the milk.  I used whole milk and even that wasn't enough to save this Campbell's imposter.

Simple and elegant. Although it's tempting - and probably makes for a slightly better recipe - to use garden tomatoes or crushed tomatoes or add other items, this recipe doesn't need changing to be good. It's so easy as it is, most changes would simply add to the effort of making it! Yum!

I loved it, but my kids' review was mixed. Of course, who can compete with Campbells? Maybe if I add a little corn syrup?

This satisfied my craving.  I decided to make this in a crock pot.  I used V-8 in place of the tomato juice, and then added the milk before the V-8, as some other reviewers suggested.  Added some basil and a bit of garlic.  Next time I would use some cream to make it thicker, but this is a great, easy basic recipe.

This is a very good soup recipe.  I added about a tablespoon of sugar to knock off the sour edge of the soup and it was great.  In order to keep the milk from cooling the soup down, I microwaved it until warm before adding it to the soup.  I also carmalized my onions in the butter on low heat before adding the flour.  This also helped give the soup a little bit more sweetness and the flour didn't taste raw.  Great with a grilled cheese sandwich, and garnish the soup with a sprig of basil.

WOW, easy and GOOD!  I have made many soups, but not tomato, because I thought the Campbell's soup was just about the way a tomato soup should taste.  THIS recipe is GOOD, better than the canned (duh!)  YUM!  My young daughter even raved about it!  A pinch of dried basil added really completed the taste! Thanks!

Very basic easy recipe. I used fresh tomato juice that I prepared from my garden tomatos. I also chopped my onions very small and only used a small onion. After adding tomato juice I whisked in a tbsp of baking soda for reducing acidity.

This was pretty good.  I followed the exactly and found it lacking just a tad....so I added about a 2 tsp of sugar just to take the edge off.  I still think it needs something else but not sure what.

Wow!! This is the first time I've ever made tomato soup from scratch and this was sooo yummy! I did add a stalk of celery to the onions and put them in the food processor to get the pieces nice and small. Instead of 2 C milk I used a can of evaporated milk (12 oz) and 1/2 cup of regular milk. Added the milk before the tomato juice and used chicken stock granules for the salt. This is one soup I'll make again and again.

WOW!! Easy and impressed 5 hungry 13 year old boys.  Took reviewers advice and added milk to roux and then added 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  Subbed onion powder for onion. And it appears that I will be making this again (and again and again).  Good bye, Campbell's Soup!!!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is a good base recipe  I added sugar to sweeten it for that good Campbell's taste.  Some might want to add garlic and herbs to make it more savory.

I too used a can of whole tomatoes and pureed them, 2 cups of milk and 8 oz. of half and half, it was delicious. I will keep canned tomatoes on hand from now on and make my own tomato soup, it's much better.

My husband and I really enjoyed this! I loved the onions which added a bit of crunch and I also made brown rice and added a dollop to each bowl before putting in the soup. Topped with a little grated parmesan cheese. I will definitely make this again.

My soup was not creamy, more like tomato juice with onions. Can't figure out if the mistake was using fresh tomatoes pureed or how I cooked it on the stove. Maybe I'll attempt it again, maybe not.

I had a couple things to change but the recipe worked as a charm. I only had 1 cup of milk, so that's all I used. Instead of tomato juice, I had Spicy V-8 so that's what I used. As a result, I didn't add salt to this recipe (as that stuff is quite salty enough). I also took the suggestion of a previous reviewer by adding my milk to the roux before I added the tomato juice. It made good sense to me, as that's how gravy begins and the flour exists only to thicken the soup. I'd probably cook my onions a bit longer next time, but that's just our taste. I think I'll cook the leftovers again with golden potatoes and serve with bacon on top...EDIT 11/12/09: In remembering this soup, I am taking away 1 star. It just didn't taste 5 star to me, although it was satisfying the 2 nights we finished it off. A good recipe if you have juice but not tomatoes, I think.

We have lots of garden tomatoes in our freezer and my husband likes to make them into juice.  This is a wonderful, fast, simple recipe for soup.  Beats the canned variety by far.  I did add some Italian seasoning just before the milk but not necessary.  I waited only a few seconds, then stirred well while adding the milk.  It did not curdle.  Delicious!

This is my recipe, and I use home canned tomatoes from my garden. I was on weight watchers when I added this, otherwise I would have added heavy cream instead of milk. This soup is great with a grilled cheese sandwich or grated hard cheese and home made croutons on top.  It is also a great base to jazz up with your favs.

My husband called this the best tomato soup he's ever tasted, and I agreed.  I added some celery and made sure the onions were nice and brown before making the roux.  I also used half & half and a generous amount of Penzey's pasta sprinkle (oregano, thyme, basil & garlic).  YUM!

If you like a little chunkier soup, add a regular can of diced tomatoes w/ onion & basil...a nice addition....and put some grated parmesean cheese on just before serving.

I made this with homemade tomato juice.  Very good.  I did substitute corn starch for the flour which shouldn't have affected the flavor.  I also used almond milk, just one cup and added some cheddar cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Not so good.  You end up with a onion-chunck fill soup tht doesn't taste any better than Campbell's canned when made with milk.  Won't do this one again.  Even after I strained out the onion, not good.

The key here is EASY. I used fat-free evaporated milk  and added it in with the tomato juice. After tasting, I decided to puree the soup to make it smooth with no onion bits in it and added garlic powder and a little Splenda as well.

This is a great recipe! I needed cream of tomato soup to make a pasta salad and this soup fit the bill.  I substituted the tomato juice for some fresh tomatoes which I pureed in the blender because I didn't have any tomato juice. My dish was a hit! Thanks for a lot for this great recipe!

I have made this recipe many times and it is really delicious! This isn't a thick soup, but it's tasty and creamy and pairs perfectly with a grilled cheese sandwich! The one change I make is straining out the chopped onions- you are left with the onion taste but no lumps in your soup. Yum!

Great base recipe.  I didn't have tomato juice so I pureed some fresh tomatoes along with the onion.  Added some oregano, basil and 1-2 tbsp Cheese Wiz.  Topped with shredded Asiago cheese. :)

Wow! I made this recipe with vegan margarine and rice milk. Also used whole wheat flour because I'd run out of all-purpose flour. Added some raw spinach and parsley to fill it out and prettify. It tastes fantastic! Now it's compassionate and cholesterol-free, as well as quick, easy, delicious, and nutritious. Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

Instead of  tomato juice--which I never have on hand.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 2 T of tomato paste and enough water to make the liquid total for 4 servings.   Than I took only the tomatoes and added them after the flour was added  and cooked them for about 3 mins.  Then I added the remaining liquid simmered until boiling--blended with my stick blender.  I added the milk and some basil and parmesan cheese too it was delish!  Thanks

I made this exactly as directed and was a little disappointed.  I found the tomato juice taste very strong.  And I am an onion lover but not in my cream soup.  I think next time I will add onion salt and leave out the onions and salt.  And I think leaving it to cool for 10 minutes then adding milk makes for a cool soup, instead of a hot 1.  We had to heat it back up.  Will make again, but with mild changes.  Sorry if I offended the submitter.

We did not like this. The onions were overpowering (even with a lot of cooking beforehand) and the soup just wasn't creamy enough. I'd rather put in the extra work to make a good creamy soup or just eat the canned stuff.

This has definitely become a staple in my kitchen. I substituted green onions and added 1 cup of peas and 1 tbsp of cumin and 3 tbsp of curry. Sounds unorthodox but my friend recommended it and it was absolutely sensational! Cheap and yummy, great for this college student :)

Very good, comforting soup.  I substitute 1/2 cup sour cream for 1/2 cup of the milk.  Add some fresh basil and use an immersion mixer to puree it all.  Freezes very well.

Extremely easy, but delicious soup! I followed the recipe except when I added the flour, I whisked in half to 1 cup of milk first instead of tomato juice. Once it got creamy consistency, I added tomato juice and then the rest of the milk. I served it with basil and black pepper. No additional salt was necessary because the juice was already salty enough. Will definitely make this again!

Very good.  I didn't know what to do with the tomato juice my husband bought but did not drink and this was the perfect solution.  Perfect at written.

Okay, this tomato soup is the most delicious thing ever!  I didn't even use a spoon, just drank two cups straight!  If you like the kind of tomato soup that doesn't have tomato bits and is perfectly smooth like the ones at a restaurant then DO NOT sub the tomato juice! The fact that there are no tomato bits is the whole point of this soup.  All I can suggest is to make sure you add salt!

Im only giving this 3 stars after reading what other reviewers posted. I think if you looked through the reviews and did what others did, this recipe might turn out yummy. Mine was just icky-not creamy or even close to thick as canned tomato soup. I will try again tho-using others' suggestions

This recipe is great!  I have a very picky 5 year old, and she loved it.  She actually ate two large bowls for lunch today!  For those of you who have kids who love Campbell's I made a few changes that make it hard to tell the difference!  The first thing I did different was use V8 (although I don't know if that made a difference).  I also used an emulsifier to smoothe out the onions.  I suppose that you could put it in the blender.  I also added about two tablespoons of sugar to it.  Finally I used a whole cup of heavy cream.  Not too healthy, but it's a lot more than you get in a can of Campbell's.  Sweet and salty, just the way she likes it.  It is perfeclty delicious for those picky eaters!

This recipe was so easy! I made a few changes... I added a diced red pepper in with the onion, I made the roux with the milk and added the tomato juice afterwards. I added basil, 1/2 cube parsley & garlic buillion, 1/2 cube veggie buillion, pepper and a healthy dash of cream at the end. Really great recipe on those time/energy challenged nights when you still want something healthy. Thanks alot!!

This tasted really good.  However it does not have the look of your traditional Tomato Soup.  I don't have a wisk so maybe that had something to do with it.  I could see the butter in the soup.  I guess I am picky on how my food looks when eating it.  I think the next time I make it I will let it slow cook in a slow cooker and see how the results turn out.  It really is very good and very flavorful.  Thanks for a quick, easy and good soup Julie.

Simplicity at its best!  Caramelized chopped red onion in butter; added a nice sweetness--nice compliment to tomato base.  Will add chopped celery next time.  Used V8 juice.  Warmed milk in a separate pot, then added to hot soup base.  Next time I'll cut back on the milk (to 1.25 or 1.5 cups), because it was too 'milky' in flavour for me:  I just prefer more tomato taste which was a bit lost due to 2C of milk.  Thanks for the Quick-N-EZ recipe!

Delicious!  The only thing I would do differently next time is not use the chopped onion.  My kids are used to tomato soup without the "pieces" in it.

Good recipe. I used 2 pints tomatoes I'd canned last summer. Blended the tomatoes with tsp of Basil. Also, added 2 Tbsp of sugar. Warmed the milk before adding to the tomato mixture so the soup was warmer.

Made this as posted. It tasted like watery tomato juice with onions. I then added everything under the sun to it to try to add some flavor, and it was still awful. Campbell’s made with whole milk is way better.

I loved it. And it was super easy, but I wonder why you wait 10 minutes the stir in cold milk...the wait alone makes the soup lukewarm and then when you add the cold milk it makes the soup cold..After a reheat we loved it.

Used 4 cans stewed tomatoes, onion powder, garlic powder, blended all with a handheld blender. Once it was done I added 2 1/2 cups of milk. It was AWESOME! Great for the cold afternoons and it took less time and tasted better then the canned variety. Thank you for having this when I needed it.

I didn't think that this soup was going to be very nice.  And my first impressions were not positive.  However my family of 6 said that it was the best tomato soup I'd ever made.  It's very quick and very easy to make, using ingrediants that are always available.  I added a couple of vegetable stock cubes to add a bit more flavour.  Really delicious!

thank you! I bought some tomato soup on clearance, and needed a soup recipe for it. this is perfect! easy, delicious and ready in a flash! the only change is that i changed the recipe to 9 servings to accommodate my large can of juice, and added some garlic and some red pepper. Then, before adding the milk i used my hand blender to make sure everything is smooth. 
DELISH!!!

I felt it would be bland but had tomato juice and a lot of milk I wanted to use. I always like to make a recipe as printed, taste and make a decision if I need to adjust.  this recipe as printed is so BLAND - I have added: 2 tsp chicken boullion, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1 tbsp dill, 1 tsp. parsley can of rotel and can of ranch beans and it still is not good! I am letting it all sit and will taste in a few hours to see if any flavors have had a chance to blend better.  I will post later with end results.

This is the only tomato soup I will eat. It's not acidic at all. It's rich, creamy, sweet and robust. I like to add a little cream cheese to mine.

If you are gluten intolerant and lactose intolerant and miss good old Campbell's cream of tomato soup....leave out the onions and add 2 TBL of sugar and you'll have an awesome knock off!  Had a  grilled cheese sandwich with it and was in heaven!!!!

If you're looking for a creamy tomato soup this is NOT it.  It just tasted like canned tomatoes.

I added basil, pepper and sugar to make it more palatable and will thicken it up later to see if I can salvage it.

I made it just as written and it was very good. Next time I make it I will do a bit of adjustment by adding a tad bit of sugar and whole milk and maybe some extra seasoning (perhaps a veggie boullion).

Souper...er, umm, Super! This was so yum. I used some celery with the finely minced onions at the outset, used olive oil for the sauteing base, threw in a bay leaf, and used half & half for the milk. Only two of us here, so on subsequent night with leftover soup, added boiled & seasoned potato chunks, asparagus, and crumbled bacon for a new "Potato Tomato Soup"...also yum. Oh! used a basic crouton recipe from this site for toppings both nights. Made me feel like a cook, after all.

This was a big hit! I made it as written, with 1% milk. Next time I'll use low fat half & half to make it richer, but it was good as is. 9 year old son and 84 year old mother-in-law both loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have any tomato juice, so I mixed tomato paste with water until it was the right consistency.  It did the trick.  I the soup great as it was, but I also like my food with garlic, so I added minced garlic, and decided to throw in some leftover chorizo as well.  One of the reasons I like cream of tomato soup to begin with is because it makes a great base for improvised soups.

Ehhhhh....this was OK. Maybe it's because I used red onions, but the flavor was a little...not what I wanted.   I'm definitely going to try it again with different onions.  I'm not sure why you want to let it cool and then put the milk in.  Who wants cold soup?  I had to heat it up after the milk was added.     Updated the next day:  I just had some leftovers for lunch.  It's definitely the onions that are ruining it for me.  Maybe I'll try onion powder next time - I'm not enjoying the onion texture in my cream of tomato soup.  Otherwise, it's pretty good.

Awesome recipe! Very versatile. I have made this multiple times and can't get enough. It is great the way it is written but also good wtih changes. I have added diced celery, carrots and green peppers to the onions and softened those. Once because I ran out of milk I used a can of evaporated milk instead - that made for a creamier soup. I have also added finely diced jalapenos for a hit of heat and also added diced tomatos (both fresh and canned) to change things up. Everytime it comes out great and I get so many compliments. This freezes well and I keep a quart or two frozen.

This is so easy to make, I didn't have have any tomato juice so I used a combination or tomato sauce and cut tomatoes. I also added a little celery and simmered altogether for about 10 minutes before pureeing. Fresh ground pepper on top and you have a meal! My son who only likes tomato soup loved it,

Looks like people have made many changes to this recipe. I'm not sure what to do. I scaled it for 2 & it was thin, milky & oniony. I added garlic & fresh pepper & it still didn't have very much taste. Next time I will puree the onion in the food processor & use less milk (or cream).

I needed a last minute tomato soup recipe and only had dry chopped onion in the pantry.  Using ~3/4 cup of chopped onion, a dash of garlic powder, and a dash of basil, this turned out to be an excellent and very easy to prepare meal!  I would have given the soup we had a "4", because I opted to strain out some of the onion pieces mid-meal, so I'm assuming that with fresh onions as the recipe calls for it would be a "5" as I noted here.

Great way to use up some tomato juice that might be sitting in your fridge. I used skim milk to cut down on some calories, and added some mini-stars pasta for some interest.

I didn't think this tasted any better than the canned variety.  Sorry.

I originally posted this review 7/4/07.  I made it again a few days ago, not realizing I had made it 10 years ago and gave it only 2 stars.  After making it again so many years later, I stand by my original rating.  As another reviewer commented, I found the chopped onion off putting.  The  chopped onion wouldn't be as noticeable if the soup itself was chunky (i.e., diced tomatoes) but the soup is creamy.  Consequently,  the onion texture was the main thing I noticed with each bite.

This is a lovely basic soup recipe; one of those kinds that can take you right back to your childhood. I didn't change a thing with the recipe, but served it with a dash of garlic powder, basil and cheese over the top. I will definitely make this again as I appreciated how very quick and easy it was to make!

This recipe was super easy!  I did make a few changes - I didn't have any onion on hand so I used minced garlic (about 1 TB or more). Also, I added the milk (only 1 1/2 cups as other reviewers suggested) to the roux first and heated it till it thickened, then I added the tomato juice. It tastes very good and was definately worth the effort. The perfect addition to a grilled cheese!

There must be something in the air...I, too, like the previous poster woke up today with a craving for creamy tomato soup, and here I am in NC with scorching summer heat and 105 degree temperatures outside! Anyway, this was great, quick & easy but I had to make a couple of changes...Didn't have onions on hand so I just melted the butter with some dried basil, then whisked in the flour. Next the tomato juice, and finally, instead of 2 cups milk, I substituted 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of milk. This made it extra rich & creamy! Thanks for the quick & satisfying recipe.
