YUM! This pie was just what I was looking for. The only changes I made was using only 1 1/2 Tbsp. lemon juice, using a chocolate oreo cookie crust, and topping with mini chocolate chips. I will definately make this again! Thanks for posting :)

This pie is awesome, but if you want to add a twist to it, instead of using sweetened condensed milk, use chocolate sweetened condensed milk.  It will even out some of the strong peanut butter flavor.

I'm not sure why more people have not tried this or why it hasn't gotten 5 stars all around...this pie is Delicious.  I have tried peanut butter pie at restaurants but they always seem so pretentious.  This is the perfect, simple peanut butter pie.

Very yummy.  I made this at the last minute for a picnic and stuck it in the freezer for a 1/2 hour.  It turned out perfect.  I made a graham crust, but added crushed pretzels, which adds a 'nutty' flavor.  I also sprinkled peanuts on the top. Everyone loved this pie!  Thanks, Karen.

It was nice but overly sweet. My family couldn't handle more than one piece.

This pie was a last minute idea. I made a gluten-free crust of dry crushed gf double chocolate cookies from T-day, and made up the pie. I used Redi Whip since it was all I had on hand, worked beautifully, froze for 30minutes and then to the fridge for another 30. It was ready for dessert on time and a simple but sweet treat to end the Christmas day. Great with a cup of coffee!

I can't believe I'm saying this, but this pie is too rich! I have the biggest sweet tooth and usually tolerate rich foods all right, but wow! If you make it, be prepared for a RICH taste, but almost sickening-sweet. My whole family could only eat one piece and that's it. I love peanut butter pies, have had them before... and I think what makes this recipe too rich is the cream cheese and the sweetened condensed milk. I think if it were lighter and fluffier and didn't have those ingredients it would be much better suited for my tastes. Thanks for posting either way, I was pumped to try it!

The flavor of this pie is very good, but it did not turn out as thick as I would like.  Maybe more cool whip next time.  Also, as one reviewer suggested, a larger pie crust would be better as I had some filling left over (but I didn't mind licking the spoon :)).

Wonderfully easy!    I did do a few things different, first off i hate Cool Whip when the real thing is so easy to make so i used 3/4th cup of cream and whipped it and add that as i would have the whipped topping. I piped a small amount on the top of the pie also to make it look pretty.  I also used to Chocolate graham cracker crust.  Next time i plan on getting a bigger pie  crust because the 9 inch was either too small or the guessing game i had with the amount of whipped cream made my pie a bit too big.  i also topped with home made Chocolate Syrup that can be found on this site.  The taste reminds me a Reese's.  I will plan to make again.

Just made this pie and it's way easier than I thought it would be. It tastes great too! I have one question; is the one cup of whipped topping actually one cup, or like an 8oz tub of cool whip?  I will definately be making this again. Yum.

This is really good.  I don't like chocolate syrup so i used an Oreo crust instead.  It turned out beautifully and it was delicious.  I will add that it's very rich and would go well with a cup of coffee.  This is definitely something I will make again.

I've used this recipe for a very long time, nothing added, nothing changed. IF i didn't want a peanut butter pie that was peanut butter; I just wouldn't make one. This pie is very sweet, very peanut butter and EXACTLY what someone expects when making it. This is not a chocolate with peanut butter tidbits-it's a full on peanut butter lover's dream. Some have said they could only eat one piece...again, why would you need any more if you were satisfied by that one? I love it and so does everyone at my family reunion. This is one of the desserts that never gets brought home and is always asked about the recipe for.

Yum.  Love this pie.  I sometimes use heavy whipping cream and make my own.  Also use the store brand non-dairy.  Both work when I'm broke, lol.  Crowd favorite, have had requests for this pie. For the chocolate on top, I use the magic shell ice cream topper.
