This was awesome!  I couldn't find Halloumi cheese so used cojita - couldn't fry it so i just added it in at the end.  Also I love chili jam but didn't have any.  Ate it as a soup but it would be good over rice.  Very filling.

Very quick dish to make.  The hardest part was chopping up the sweet potato.  Would definitely make this again.

I used light coconut milk and Sriracha instead of chili jam but otherwise followed this to a T. It was great over rice noodles and also with naan!

We loved it! I had to substitute a few things, but it didn't change the great flavors. I used chutney for the jelly since I forgot that I gave it to a friend and also used Asiago cheese that I just added in one inch squares to the pot. I used the crock pot. Tonight for leftovers I added saute' mushroom and garlic and it was even better. Served with organic rice from Aldis and peas. I will definitely make it again and maybe add some meat. If you don't have coconut milk, make it anyway since we couldn't even taste it.

I made this and it was so delicious . I substituted a teaspoon of Harissa and a teaspoon of apricot jam in place of the chili jam. Heavenly!
