I used "trim" cottage cheese and reduced fat crea cheese. The kids and I enjoyed this spread on toasted Bagel Thins. Nice quick spread. Next time, I think I might try this with Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of white sugar.

This is a pretty tasty spread.  I used regular cream cheese.  Next time I will use large curd cottage cheese - the country curd got kind of dry after processing it.  I also might use superfine sugar, you can kind of feel the granular sugar in this.  I love it though.

This is a great spread for bagels.  I used small curd cotttage cheese and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  My sugar disolved just fine.  You just need to make sure you process it long enough and then refrigerate for at least a couple hours because it's not very thick at first.  It does thicken up nicely in the fridge and is a delicious little spread!

Great idea, but it didn't quite provide the taste I thought it would. The mixture of cottage cheese with the sugar seemed a bit off. It just needs some slight adjustments somewhere.

This was a nice change to regular cream cheese.  Just not our favourite.

This turned out pretty tasty. I didn't have enough cottage cheese, so I halved the cream cheese and cottage cheese. I kept the 1 tsp cinnamon and used a total of 3 tsp of BROWN sugar. I blended this up in my Vitamixer. There wasn't any sugar crystals at all. I'm not sure if it was just the difference in sugar or the power of my blender. Anyhow, it was runny at first. When I refrigerated it, it turned into a more spreadable mixture. Next time I might use the full cup of cream cheese and use 1/2 cup cottage cheese. That might help the consistency and make it more like a cream cheese spread. I didn't mix any raisins in (per my picky 11 year old) but I'm sure it would be tasty. I used this with Bagels I recipe on this site. Thanks for the great recipe!

First time I made this I had no cream cheese, it tasted AMAZING even without it. This a quick-simple spread to serve anytime at any party, family snack, etc! 5 stars!!!

This is a great cream- cheesy spread! It was nicely cinnamon and raisin flavored and was also creamier than I expected. This is probably because I used regular cream cheese and a little less than a cup of low fat cottage cheese. I also upped the cinnamon to two teaspoons, we liked it on toast and bagels. Next time I will definitely try fat- free cream cheese to see what the consistency is like and to make it a little healthier. Thanks for the nice spread!

This is a new favorite breakfast! I used fat free cottage cheese too and just dumped everything in the food processor, including the raisins. I spread it on toasted Bagel Thins.
