This was good.  I will say that the recipe makes very large portions and I felt that the ratio of broth to rice was off.  I've made other risotto recipes before and it seemed fishy to me right off the bat.  Usually you have several times more liquid than rice, whereas here it's only 2 to 1.  My broth got sucked up so fast and my rice was so crunchy that I had to start adding hot water about halfway through.  It still came out well, though.  To summarize, I would suggest cutting down on the rice and pumping up the broth (at least a 3 to 1 ratio).

I will rate this a 5 with the following revisions:

-2Tbsp olive oil for the rice and 2Tbsp for the leek mixture
-Def. needs more veggie broth, 6-8C depending on your rice
-More like 1 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper
-1/2 tsp fresh ground salt at the end
-1/2 lemon squeezed over risotto at the end and then blended just before serving. I love a hint of lemon whenever I cook with shrimp...

This is a keeper risotto recipe!

This dish is a great base to add to your recipe box that can take on many variations.  Risotto is such a comfort food if made correctly.  Pair it, as this does, with a protein (shellfish) and lots of veggies, including the fiber rich, spinach, and you’ve got a great, warm & filling meal.  Suggestions for base: 1.	Use a good quality broth for the rice to absorb.  Generally, the darker the broth, the greater the concentration of pure stock to other ingredients, typically added water and/or salt.  I like Kitchen Basics chicken broth.  It won’t break the bank and offers a darker stock than its competitor. 2.	I used a little over a 4:1 ratio of stock to rice as others have suggested, this works out to just over a full box of the stock.  The key is to stop adding broth only when the rice won’t absorb any more.  When you start to feel like the rice won’t absorb any more, decrease each “test” addition so you don’t end up with soup.  This should give you a nice, creamy texture. 3.	I preferred cooking the shrimp & scallops in a sauté pan separate from the veggies to get a nice, caramelized sear.  This will also prevent them from getting overcooked and loosing their moisture by sitting in the same pan with the veggies waiting to get done.  Saute until just opaque in color and then transfer and mix with the veggies.  Heat through.  Suggested Variations: 1.	I added 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to the risotto for added depth. 2.	Try adding a couple big handfuls of parmesan or ramano ch

Great recipe for an inexperienced cook. Lots of Fresh grated Parmesan cheese made this meal over the top. As per other reviews I used 1 cup of rice and 4 cups of broth and it turned out perfect, enough for 4 people. Took me about 45 min to make as a first time risotto maker.

I use chicken broth in this recipe and all other risotto recipes because of flavor.
I only did shrimp , no spinach and lots of garlic , it's always good !
I like to add shallots fresh parsley and basil at the end.
I add the raw shrimp at the very end once the heat is turned off so the shrimp don't overcook  .

This was my first time making Risotto, but by far not my first time eating it. My rating is a 3 because the rice to broth ratio should be 3:1 or slightly more, but here it is a little off.  I used 5 cups broth to 1 and a half cups rice and it was almost just enough. Adding a little extra wine (Sauvignon Blanc) and water gave the rice just what it needed.  To save money I excluded scallops and went with a half pound of shrimp (We are not big meatheads).  I cooked through most everything accordingly, except previously noted, and it turned out delicious.  I did not combine the veggies and rice, but did plate the rice with the veggies on top (allowing the diner to eat as many veggies as they wanted.  
This meal was excellent and is coupled well with a homemade dry bread. The rich buttery flavor from the rice couples well with the leek and shrimp for a good finish to a good night.

We did not add shrimp to this because of preference. This was very good, but it needs more vegetable broth. We had to add water to it. Will make again! Thanx!

First time for me making risotto.  As others have noted, the recipe calls for not enough broth.  Luckily, I realized this halfway through when all of my broth was gone, and I was reading tips on how to make risotto in my "New Basics Cookbook".  In addition to the poor risotto ratios, I felt that the spinach detracted from the dish, rather than adding to it.  Two stars, because I believe the overall idea of the shrimp/scallop risotto is solid, but really, the recipe needs substantial work.

I'd never made risotto before and thankfully read the other reviews about needing extra liquid.  I downsized the recipe to 1 cup of rice and a full 32oz carton of broth would be just about perfect.  I only used about 3-3.5.   I also started the leeks and garlic on heat earlier than the shrimp and scallops because I despise overcooked seafood and wanted to prevent that.  A little lemon at the end and some fresh chopped herbs over top for color would be about my only other suggestions.  Personally I loved the dish, big time.  The next time I make it I'll be sure to use a 4:1 ration for rice/broth, finish with some lemon and fresh herbs and I think it will be even better.

This just ended up tasting very strongly of leeks and spinach and not much else. I had precooked shrimp that I added right at the end and they didn't pick up much flavor. Raw shrimp that could cook longer might be better in this.

It's hard to review this one fairly.  To make as written would not work properly because of the incorrect proportions of Arborio to water.  However, the flavor profile was perfect and if altered for a successful risotto the flavor is wonderful.  I can't list all the alterations for this because it would seem like a new recipe but I did use this one as my base and I only added white wine and 2 tbsp butter as ingredient changes.....so I can't really claim a new recipe.   My advice, use your own risotto knowledge w/ these ingredients and you'll love the finished product!  If you don't "know" risotto....start w/ another recipe and then return here when you get the "feel" for it!

I love this dish. I used this as the base for my first attempt at risotto. It's delish! I did add portobella mushrooms and extra parmesan cheese to mine and I used chicken broth and white wine as the liquid... but otherwise I followed the remaining ingredients as listed (although I only had shrip on hand...no scallops.)
 I reduced the rice to 1 cup, so my ratio was about 3-4 parts liquid to 1 part rice. I added fresh chopped spinach to the cooked risotto at the very end and it was perfect. (I did not cook the spinach with the other ingredients). This was very easy to make and I will make it again! Lovely dish!

It was really good. I just didn't add the red bell pepper and I added a lot more liquid (vegetable broth). I grated some parmesan cheese on top before serving.

Very nice recipe. I liked the way the veges were still crunchy. I used wholegrain rice and lots more leeks, but that is just my taste preference.

As written, this recipe doesn't cut it. In order to end up with more than a bowl full of savory Rice Krispies, you need about a 4:1 ratio of liquid to rice. And adding the liquid in thirds doesn't produce that silky, creamy goodness that makes risotto risotto. You've gotta ladle it in 1/2 to 3/4 cup at a time which, of course, adds a good 10 or more minutes to the cooking time. I just don't understand why folks make all kinds of changes & then give a recipe a 4 or 5 star rating. Why not just post a customized version? I mean, your suggestions are EXCELLENT & more than necessary for this recipe to be successful! Anyhoot, with more liquid, a touch more oil for sauteing, & some butter stirred in at the end for the creaminess factor, this would have rated 4 stars - but that's a different recipe then, isn't it? ;)

Very good recipe.  I agree that the risotto preparation must be modified.  It requires almost a 4:1 ratio of stock to rice, and it takes a lot of attention and at least 30- 45 minutes to cook. There's just no shortcut to making a good risotto... In addition, I prefer to prepare the scallops and shrimp separately.  I use large scallops and like to prepare them over high heat so they caramelize- yum!  And preparing the shrimp separately simply prevents them from over-cooking.  Last, I suggest you scale down the recipe.  Based on other reviews, I reduced the recipe from 4 to 2, yet we had enough for 5 adults!!

This was my first time making risotto and it was a success! I didn't have any leek but would like to add it next time, I just used minced onion. I used 4 cups broth to one cup rice and I used the suggestion of boiling the shrimp shells for 30 min with some water and a cup of chicken broth. I also had some swiss chard which I threw in there. Didn't have the pepper so I just put in some red pepper flakes. Very good!

Want to take it up a notch?  Buy fresh shimp, peel them, and use the shells to make your own shrimp stock.  Just add water, onion, celery, carrot, and a few aromatics.  Simmer slowly for about an hour, strain, and use as directed.  In a hurry?  Add the shells to an existing veggie or chicken stock and simmer 20-30 minutes, strain and use.  Makes a world of difference!

Wonderful recipe and has become a family weekend favorite.  Risotto is just a bit time consuming for me.  I've made this recipe quit a few times now and play around with the ingredients depending on what I have available especially the scallops.  (My husband loves them and I'm not a big fan so I never mind if their missing).  I do always add more broth than what is asked for because it doesn't come out right with just 4 cups. I think a 3 to 1 ratio works better.  You must give this recipe a try! Its really good!

Fantastic recipe, but like the others I used 1 cup rice and 4 cups of vegetable broth. I still had to add a bit more water after using up the broth. Didn't have red chili peppers, so we used chili paste instead.   I will definitely make this again, but with all the ingredients including the scallions. Thanks for sharing !

This recipe is sooooo good you have to try it!  I used orzo instead of arborio rice as its about 5 dollars less pound!  I also added a about 1/2 a cup of heavy cream to thicken up the sauce.  I don't like scallops too much, but i love lobster and it made the dish tasting amazing!

I really liked this but my husband wasn't as thrilled (that's why I only gave it three stars). Didn't change anything except used chili paste instead of a fresh one.

Awesome recipe. Adjusted it from 2 cups broth for every 1 cup of rice, to 3 cups broth, perfect, being Spanish, I added a little cilantro or recao, and added some basil towards the end, and drizzled a little lime juice over it before serving it, to kick up the sea food a little. Instant family favorite.

This is a great starter recipe for risotto. I did change it by adding a extra 1 tsp. of garlic and using chicken stock instead of vegetable stock. It does make enough for 6 people with a salad and crusty bread. You do need to double on the liquid though. That is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. Also you can substitute red pepper flakes for the fresh hot pepper. I started with a 1/2 tsp. but would maybe add a whole tsp. next time. My family likes more spice. Still a great idea

Excellent recipe. I double the amount of scallops and used green onions instead of leeks.  I also added one extra cup of warm water with two cube of buillon.

This was good.  I took the recommendation of some other reviewers and increased the vegetable broth to 6 cups, which worked well.  I also added it in over 20+ minutes, which I think it needed to fully cook the rice.

I was a little worried that this dish would be bland, since pepper is the only spice added to it, but it wasn't.  It was just right as far as flavor.

It was a beautiful dish as far as presentation.  I wish I had taken a picture... it was quite colorful!

Loved it. My first time making risotto. Definitely a learning curve. Followed other reviewers advice regarding increasing broth. Mine was soft but a little sticky. More broth next time. I’m on weight watchers so doubled all the veggies and seafood for a great relatively low points meal! Have added it to the meal rotation.

My sister called this "restaurant -worthy".  I served it with plain rice, so needed more of a sauce.  I seared the scallops first, removed them and added the leeks. I wanted a more mild pepper taste so I used red pepper flakes instead of a hot red pepper.  When softened, I deglazed with 1/2c white wine (you could use broth/lemon juice), added garlic, shrimp, and scallops, spinach, and peppers. Added a generous tablespoon of butter and  some heavy cream and simmered til shrimp cooked and spinach wilted. Seasoned with salt.

Made this tonight for first time and we both loved it! Added juice of 1/2 lemon at the end just before  serving, which really added a little extra zing and made it a 5 star recipe. Also substituted 1/8 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes for fresh red peppers.

This is a very good risotto.  I substituted a banana pepper for the chili pepper because that's what I had, did not add scallops, but added grated Romano cheese at the end because I enjoy a cheesy risotto.  It cooked up perfectly, creamy and delicious.

I switched it up a little since I didn't have all the ingredients or like them.  Used 1 cup of rice and TWO cans of chix broth.  Added garlic to the chix broth.  Omitted the leeks & chile pepper.  Added mushrooms and more garlic and cooked with the spinach.  Stirred in a 2 handfuls of Romano at the end.  Was delish!

Double up on the broth, my rice absorbed it fast and was too dry.  Risotto is supposed to be creamy.  I've had better recipes.

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and modified the rice/liquid ratio.  I cut the rice in half and left all the other ingredients the same.  However, there was WAY too much leek in the recipe that way!  I would suggest halving the rice and the leek, and leaving everything else the same, as the other proportions seemed just right.  The taste was great though, and even though I was skeptical about the lack of salt in the recipe, it was not needed (due to the broth, I'm sure).  I will definitely make this one again!

actually i made quite a lot of changes, but that will not affect the taste of the risotto. i added squid and mushroom and didnt put red pepper. It turned out fine, the texture of rice was good but i used a ratio of 4 to 1 after reading others review. For some reason it turned out quite salty but i think it was the broth i was using. Other than that, my first risotto was a success =)

Followed the advice of other posters and used 3 c of broth for each cup of rice. Substituted diced chicken thigh for the scallops and served with parmesan cheese and lemon. Just right for 4 servings.

It was good but seems to still to be missing something. Would try some herbs next time.

Nice recipe. As others advised, I used 4 cups of broth for 1 cup of rice and it came out at perfectly.

I also cut up some lemon wedges which I put in while cooking. Once done I removed them. It gave a nice hint of lemon to the dish.

This was the first recipe that I used from this site that both my husband and I agreed was wonderful.  Like others I used 1 cup of rice and 3 cups of stock.  I also used frozen peas instead of spinach and since we had no chillies I cheated and used chili flakes which worked just fine.

This was a perfect recipe to add to my dinner menu! After making a few variations such as substituting red onion instead of the leeks and using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, my family found this recipe one that is worthy for seconds.
