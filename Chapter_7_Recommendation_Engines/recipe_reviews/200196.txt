This was delicious! I used Mexican zucchini and quinoa. Instead of boiling the zucchini, which I think would kill the flavor, I sauteed it on medium-high while the quinoa was cooking, and then I turned it up to high for the last few minutes to brown it. I used Greek yogurt for the sauce, so it was nice and tangy; it mixed perfectly with the caramelized zucchini. I thought a cup of dill might be a bit strong, but it was just right. A definite keeper--and so easy!

I can't describe how delicious this recipe is.  My teenage daughter said "I didn't think I'd like it but I did!--this is my favorite meal!"  I served it with pan-seared sea bass and it was a perfect refreshing healthy summer meal.  I confess I didn't have fresh dill so used 1/2 amount of dried dillweed and it was outstanding.  I found that in a skillet the small amount of rice with water doesn't really boil so the zucchini really did saute in the olive oil and I had to cover the pan in order for the rice to get tender.  Ingredients already in kitchen, minimal prep time, fabulous blend of flavors....I put it in my "Family Loved It" file!

Very tasty.  I used dried dill at half the reccomended amount.  Fresh would be the bomb.  The sauce really takes this dish to the stars.  Served with toasted French bread on the side.  A simple yet elegant recipe.

This was extremely simple and delicious!  Great for a cool summer evening.  I used cucumber as I didn't have zucchini on hand and it turned out surprisingly well.  The dill smells so good while cooking and the garlic-yogurt sauce is the perfect complement.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Delicious!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  He didn't really use the sauce as he isn't a huge fan of any yogurt sauce, but I used it and saved the left over sauce to dip fresh veggies in.  My husband took the left over zucchini in his lunch and said that it reheated great!  We will definitely have as a side dish on a regular basis!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good and fresh tasting.  Complimented the Shish Tawook Marinated Chicken well.  I cut back just a bit on the dill as my children are iffy on it.

We all really liked this.  It's such a light dish, but very flavorful.  I didn't have quite enough fresh dill, so I added a bit of dried as well.  I did have some trouble getting my rice to cook.  I cooked as instructed for almost 20min., but my rice was still hard, so I added a bit more water, turned the heat back up, then *covered and simmered for 10 more minutes.  My zucchini still weren't over cooked, and it turned out perfectly.  Next time, I'll just add some extra water, and cover the dish half way through the 20 minutes.  I served this with a Tzatziki sauce (this sauce, plus some lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and pepper) and the Shish Tawook Chicken recipe from allrecipes - all shoved into pita pockets.  A wonderfully-different meal.

This was fantastic!  I made this as a side dish when my parents came over for dinner, and they absolutely loved it.  Will definitely make this again!

Great side dish if you want to cut down the amount of carbs.  

This is soooo good.  I thought at first that this is maybe too much dill but it's perfect.

I don’t know how much zucchini 4 is supposed to be, so I used about 4 cups of chopped zucchini, doubled the rice and liquid (sub’d chix broth); left the lid on for 20 minutes and then off for 5. I also tweaked the yogurt sauce,made it more of a tzatziki with lemon juice and olive oil, and didn’t make as much as called for. Made this with Shish Tawook grilled chicken, as some other reviewers suggested, the flavors really complemented each other. Everyone took seconds. I love dill!! Also, don't let the onion and zucchini get too done before adding the liquid, they will get plenty done while the rice is cooking.

EXCELLENT! I used yellow squash since my husband isn't crazy about zucchini, and it was YUMMY! I also stirred the yogurt sauce into the squash. We just slopped it up! Didn't have any leftovers even though I made enough for 2 meals. Highly recommend this recipe for something different. Going in the "keeper" folder. Thanks for sharing it!

I made this with yellow squash. Unfortunately, I didn't have plain yogurt, so I left that out and just mixed the garlic and salt with the other ingredients. It was still good, but probably would have been great with the yogurt. I'll have to try it again sometime when I have some.

This was very interesting and I did like it. The zucchini does get quite soft which I wasn't expecting. However, all the flavors go well once complimented with the garlic yogurt. I used 3 tsp of dried dill in place of the fresh and used two medium/large zucchini for the amount suggested. I kept all other ingredient amounts the same. It went well with red meat that I had made and was a nice change to potatoes. ty

I thought it would be better with double the rice and half the yogurt. Hubby didn't like it much at all, so I probably won't try again.
