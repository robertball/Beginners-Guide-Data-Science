I made the recipe as written except I used unsweetened coconut.  I ended up having to throw the whole pan out.  The crust is very very thin and almost like damp sand when placed in the pan. (and I even sift my flour always).  I would suggest if you are making these, to melt the chocolate first and then spread instead of that extra minute in the oven.  The crust was a very dark brown by the time they were done and tasted like pie crust.  I would also suggest you not use unsweetened coconut.  the topping barely covered the top, and was too chewy.  I've gone over this recipe to make sure I didn't mis-measure but the topping was very dry, the chocolate hardens, and the crust is very thin and not sweet at all.

These are very good and sweet. I made two changes though. I spread a layer of raspberry preserves on the crust. Then melted the morsels in the microwave just enough to be able to spread them over the raspberry layer. I used the preserves because I wanted to finish up the jar and I do love chocolate and rasberries together.

Scumptious!! The butter brown sugar crust is crispy and then the chocolate and toasted coconut. MMmm!
It don't know if it will help, but I had a tinsey bit of evaporated milk left in the frig and mixed it with the chocolate before melting it. I was wondering too, if I could just melt the chocolate chips in the microwave and then spread them on the crust? But yes! I can see these being very dangerous to have close at hand!!!!!

OH. MY. GOODNESS. These are divine! Rich, chewy, just the right amount of coconut. Definitely cut them into small pieces, as they are quite decadent! I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan. I was a little worried while making these because the topping was watery, difficult to spread over the chocolate, and it didn't seem like there'd be enough to cover the whole thing. But it baked up nice, with a few peaks of chocolate here and there. I also added a pinch of sugar to the topping as my coconut was unsweetened. Oh, and I used dark chocolate chips and I would definitely recommend using them! Thanks for the recipe! (Also the chocolate does harden once they are cool. I wouldn't keep them in the fridge or you might lose a tooth! I'm wondering if adding a little cream to the chocolate would keep it a little softer? Still delicious though!)
