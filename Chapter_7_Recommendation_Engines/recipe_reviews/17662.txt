Kneaded the dough in the KitchenAid stand mixer, then made spaghetti with the pasta maker attachment.  It was delicious!  (I did add 1 tsp. dry basil and 1 tsp. dry oregano for a little kick!)

This is an excellent basic pasta recipe.  The semolina makes all the difference.  I have made fresh pasta off and on for years, and this would make a great first-time pasta.  It works well when I am feeling wild and crazy and add fresh herbs, spinach, chili powder, or whatever tickles my fancy.  I added some cracked pepper to the pasta and topped it off with alfredo sauce.  What a spicy treat!

I don't know what the previous reviewer did wrong, but this pasta had just the right amount of liquid to dry ingredients.  The key for me was to do the mixing in a KitchenAid stand mixer.  Then I removed the dough and did the kneading on the counter.  Couldn't have been easier.  My one comment is that the dough needed more salt.  Also, I hand rolled my ravioli sheets, which probably meant I made them thicker than I would have if I owned a pasta roller.  My picky sons and husband both ate these up without complaining!

This recipe was perfect. I have tried many recipes in the past and this is by far the best. I agree with others on this site that using extra large eggs would probably be better, but as I am experienced in dough making, I added a little bit more olive oil and a splash of water to get the moisture content correct. I kneaded by hand for eight minutes and set it in a zip lock freezer bag and when It came out it was satin smooth and went through my pasta roller and cutter without a hitch. I made 40 palm sized (using a tart cutter) super raviolis with this recipe and had enough left over for a quick bowl of basil and butter spaghetti (with roasted and chopped pine nuts) This recipe rocks!

Oh My Gosh - This is sooooo easy and delicious. I basically threw everything into my Kitchen Aid, let it do its thing until the dough was soft and pliable.  I don't think I'll ever use another pasta dough recipe again except for this one.

Excellant end result.  The dough was too sticky after letting it set for the first 30 min & it wouldn't go through the pasta maker very well.  So we let it set for another 30 minutes wrapped in plastic and that made all the difference.  It was perfect to work with then!

This was my first time making pasta and this recipe gets top marks with me! At first I was concerned the pasta would be too dry, but after the appropriate amount of kneading, it turned out just perfect! Thank goodness for my KitchenAid, I don't think I would've tried this without it's help.

The pasta came out really good.  I started out making it on the counter by hand and it was too messy so I ended up dumping everything in my Kitchenaid.  I will definately make this again, but only in my Kitchenaid.

I haven't made good pasta before, but this receipe worked really well. I found rolling with a rolling pin was fairly easy if I used short quick strokes but the kneading was strenuous - next time I'll try kneading it in the bread machine.

I have read a great number of the reviews for this recipe as well as number of other pasta recipes on this site. I am a virtual novice at cooking and have the patience of a kid (I’m 50). I can cook, a little, so I’m not the worst out there but not far from it. I tried this because I bought my wife a new kitchenAid along with the pasta attachments. Being a gadget kind of guy I had to try these new machines out. So off I went, on a mission to make pasta. 

I was a little concern I was about to make a complete flop. I got the right flour (went all over town trying to find Semolina flour, found it at whole foods), the right eggs (read to use x-large eggs), and olive oil. Mixed and kneaded it up in the kitchenAid then kneaded the dough by hand for a few minutes. Let it rest about 30 mins (read that too) and then got out the pasta attachments and rolled out perfect dough, cut it into linguini and was thoroughly impressed with how well things came together. 

I made a total of three batches, two of which My wife and I made raviolis. She is the cook and made a spinach, regatta cheese filling and we ate wonderfully all weekend. Now I have a lot of ravioli in the freezer and ready to try again. I did add some herbs to the last batch and found it harder to work with so I think I will mill the dried herbs to a finer texture before I do that again but it tasted wonderful. 

Good luck. If can do it anyone can.

this recipe had too much flour for the amount of eggs. if you want to try to knead it for ten minutes only to have it flake apart and not work, use this recipe.

Just tried this last night.  Wanted to use the pasta/roller/cutter that hubby bought me.  I didn't have any semolina flour so just used all purpose flour.  Wanted to cut down calories, so used egg whites instead of whole eggs. 

I've never had a lighter pasta, wonderful texture absolutely divine.  Can't wait to make it for guests.  Thanks Jen for the recipe.  

PS  by using egg whites instead of eggs you cut the calories in half

forgot to mention that when kneading in flour I did not incorporate all the flour or the dough would have been too dry.  Important to trust your feel.  When dough was a little too dry I wetted my hands slightly and countinued kneading.

The only reason I didn't use 5 stars is because the motor for my mixer burned out and I had to hand roll.  I used another reviewers tip and added dry oregano and basil and replaced the salt with garlic salt.  This is my new "go to" recipe!

Loved this recipe. I agree - I think the semolina makes all the difference! I used the Kitchen Aid mixer to blend everything into a ball, then kneaded by hand for about 10 minutes. The dough was very hard and I was quite concerned but after letting it rest for 30-60 minutes, it was softer and beautiful to roll out and use in the pasta maker.  I did also add some dried basil and some black pepper to the dough while mixing.

Made half the recipe for 4 servings. Mixed the ingredients in my Cuisinart food processor and let it rest inside the bowl; knead on a floured counter until a clean dough ball forms; rolled half a batch at a time with a rolling pin very thinly; dust generously with more flour; fold loosely onto itself twice and then cut with a sharp knife into strips. Used fine semolina flour. No pasta maker needed and the dough sheets held up nicely without any breakage.

This was the easiest recipe ever.  I have NEVER made pasta before and I just followed the recommendations of other reviewers.  Used my kitchen aide whisk attachment to sift the dry ingredients; made a well in the middle and added eggs and oil.  Changed to the dough hook and just let it all come together.  The only other thing I would suggest for anyone who has never used a pasta maker before is to diligently flour the pasta maker and the pasta as it comes out of the machine -- otherwise it'll stick together and make clumpy pasta.  Overall easy and delicious! My husband couldn't stop raving!

This is my first time making pasta! I'm so jazzed!!! It's awesome!! I mixed the ingredients in my KA stand mixer, then kneaded by hand.  It was a bit dry so I added a few drops of water.    After it rested in plastic wrap, it was definitely pliable and smooth!!! Running the pasta through my rollers were amazing!  I was having so much fun!!!  The pasta tasted so awesome! I love it!!! I made the red sauce that I use for pizza, which is also on this site.  OH MY GOODNESS!!! I added ground turkey and sliced mushrooms.  It was amazing!  I'm definitely loving this recipe and will use it many times over!!! It's so easy to make! Oh...don't forget to put on Andrea Bocelli and have a glass of wine while you're making this!!!

This recipe is one of the best. I am a 13 year old male and love to cook. It, I would have to say, is the best tasting and easily made recipe. I would make the noodles and my parents would make the topper. We enjoy the pasta for a special occasion and also just for a meal. The pasta is so easily made I would make it for lunch and just add some ramen noodles seasoning ( I recommend the chicken). I would also recommend before serving to a large group try the recipe and see if you like it. If not adjust the recipe to your liking. Have fun and enjoy.

The was an easy & fun pasta to make.
I had enough for two meals so I dried the extra noodles slightly and froze them. Like the reviews befor me I also used my Kitchen Aid mixer. I did kneed a little by hand at the end to get a feel for the dough.
I also used 7 LG eggs and it seemed to work fine. I will make this again!

This is an excellent recipe! I've never made pasta before and I don't have a pasta maker, but this still turned out really well! I threw together some thawed frozen spinach, garlic, mozarella cheese, and a couple of egg yolks and stuffed the pasta with this mixture. My ravioli was a HIT!

Made this tonight on the spur of the moment and it was fabulous! Since we are only a family of 3, I halved the recipe, but wish now I'd made the whole thing!  My dough was a little on the dry side (maybe my eggs weren't quite big enough?) but to remedy that I just kneaded in a touch of olive oil until the dough was smooth. (This was after the 30 minutes of resting.)  Then floured it up and cranked it through my pasta roller. My pasta-loving daughter said it looked professional and was the best pasta she's had in her whole life.  For my husband and me, I made a yummy brown butter sage sauce. It was divine!  They both want me to make this again tomorrow night! I tried making homemade pasta years ago, when I was first given the pasta roller as a gift and I don't remember it being this easy, or this tasty!  Homemade pasta has a more toothsome feel and seems to grab hold of the sauce better. I rolled out the sheets to a thickness of 5 with the pasta roller, then sent them through the spaghetti cutting blade. The result was almost like angel hair, but with a heartier texture. This is a keeper!

I wanted to experiment with my new pasta machine and couldn't pass up this recipe as I LOVE products with semolina.  In retrospect, I should have rolled the dough thinner as my pasta came out too thick for my taste, and I'll do just that with the remaining pasta dough that I wrapped up and put in the refrigerator.  Warning: this recipe is messy, time-consuming & FUN!  There's nothing like making pasta from scratch!  Thanks, Gino, on an excellent recipe!

This recipe was perfect. My only suggestion would be to make sure you use XL eggs; the first batch I made was a tiny bit dry, I think large eggs are just a spot on the small side for the amount of flour. And don't skimp on your kneading!

I have this recipe over and over. at first i used the hand mixing method, and it is dry i added an extra bit of EVOO, and the longer you need it the softer it got and the semolina granuals get smooth.   I used my bosch mixer through the flour in garlic paste, basiléoregano paste. evoo, and then my eggs (i double my batch) and just let my mixer work its magic, turned on high to kneed it with the dough hook and in 14 min later i had a perfect kneeded smooth beautiful pasta dough.

Really good but it was a bit too dry to knead. I don't have a stand mixer so I used the method that was given in the recipe, it didn't work, lol. I just did what I could kneading by hand and it turned out good. I'm sure it would be better with a better technique. As well it makes enough to feed an army.  I had enough to feed me and my husband 2 dinners and 4 lunches as well as freezing 1/3 of the unused dough

My husband and I made homemade pasta for the first time this evening, using our new KitchenAid 3-piece pasta roller & cutter set.  After some extensive research we decided on this recipe.  It came out great!  The pasta had great flavor and texture (despite other reviewers comments to the contrary).  We will definately use this recipe in the future, however may try some of the suggestions for adding herbs etc.

This is the 3rd recipe I have tried inorder to make my own pasta and it's the 1st that has come out well for me. I half the amount just cause it makes enough for my family to have dinner. I also added black pepper and spinach to it and made sheets for "World's Best Lasagna" on this site. This is now my go to pasta recipe. Ty Jenn!

I made noodles from this recipe using whole wheat flour instead of all purpose white flour and they turn out really great. The dough was really easy to work with.

I really loved this recipe.
The first time i made it, i didn't have any semolina in the house so i used plain flour and swapped 1/3 c for ground almonds.
It turned out super.
Made it in to cheese and parsley ravioli with a tomato sauce.
2nd time i followed recipe and made little shapes with a pizza cutter. (I have no machine.)
Also turned out really nice.
Made it for a friends shower party. Got lots of compliments.

I made this today using my kitchen aid mixer.  It came out excellent.   The machine kneaded it for approximately 5 minutes until the dough formed sort of a ball.  Then I let it rest.    I cut it into 3rds.   Rolled it out until it was thin enough to get into the pasta machine.  It looked dry and a bit crumbly but it was perfect.  I think next time I will halve the recipe.  We had more than enough noodles for everyone.

I made this recipe a few days ago, adding fresh herbs and roasted garlic. I first tried it im my pasta machines to see how it would go through with the diffrent shapes. I finally used it making a large batch of ravioli. It's the best pasta dough I have ever used and my husband loved the ravioli. I made a filling using fresh ground chicken breast, onions, roasted garlic, artichokes, four cheeses and half way through I even added spinach. I have a ravioli maker but I had decided I would make this ravioli recipe, using it by hand rolling for the first time. I wanted to see how this dough would roll. It took a little more time but it was well worth it. My husband usually doesn't like pasta recipes if the pasta is thick and heavy. This dough roller nicely in fact I will be using this recipe from now on when making pasta. When my husband came in from work tonight he asked if I had made any extra, he wanted it again. I told him I had only cook enough for that meal but I had made a double batch  and had plenty in the freezer. So he asked if I would make them for tomorrow. They were a big hit with him and tomorrow our granddaughter is coming for the night and she loves when I make homemade pasta. I would recommend anyone who makes homemade pasta to try this recipe, it's a keeper. I have tried many pasta dough and they usually don't work well in the pasta maker. What good is having a pasta maker if I can't use it. The next time I will use the pasta maker, they hold shapes nicely when I

I have made this recipe several times now and love it. My family has commented on how tender the noodles are and the great flavor. I use my Kitchenaid mixer and attachments to press and cut the dough. I tend to add a bit more flour to help the dough not be so sticky. I come from a big Italian family and everyone loves the pasta from this recipe, it taste is very similar to my great grandma's homemade pasta unfortunately I can't decipher her recipe book since it is all in Italian abbreviations.

Very easy to make, even for a first time user. This can be easily modified to add herbs or spices to the pasta before cooking. Although the dough doesn't look like much at first, it is. Pasta needs to be thin, you'll find this makes quite a lot. I used it to make ravioli(so I used a rolling pin). But I would invest in a pasta machine for spaghetti, etc.

I toss all the ingredients in a bread machine and let it do much of the work. The dough comes out exactly as it should. 

As you learn to work with pasta dough, you will "get the feel" for how moist or dry it should be. It should not be sticky. This recipe comes out just about perfect. If there is very low humidity, you may want to add a tablespoon or two of water.

It is VERY important to let the dough rest. 

This recipe is identical to my Grandmothers recipe. She was an Italian immigrant who came to the US in the 1930's and a GREAT cook, of course. She'd tell you, only use Extra Virgin olive oil, too.

Super easy when thrown together in a food processor--I measure the 4 cups of flour and pulse to blend.  In a separate bowl I beat the eggs with the olive oil, pour over the blended flours and pulse till it comes together then I knead by hand for 8 minutes or so.  This pasta dough rolls out like a dream and reminds me of fine parchment paper.  It holds up way better than other pasta doughs I've used and even stands up to repeated trips through the pasta machine, which other doughs don't tolerate as well.  Makes awesome ravioli and noodles.  This is an absolute keeper!

I have been making my own pasta for two years now and this recipe has the ingredients I've been looking for. I did change the following; 2 cups of the semolina and two cups of the OO Flour and more salt. I also kneaded it, pounded it on the table a few times, like your beating on it.  This makes the dough more pliable.  Let it rest for a good 15 minutes or so.  Then I used my pasta machine, first on 6, then 4, then 1.  Made Linguine with a sausage, pepper and onion sauce.  Also this recipe gives you enough to cook and to dry out for a later date.  Great recipe, hope my tips help.  I found both the semolina and Triple OO Flour on the internet, little expensive but so worth it.

I agree with many other commentators.  This was a great recipe.  No concerns with the recipe itself, but if you don't have a pasta machine, the preparation time from rolling out the dough and beyond is imense.  It took my husband and I 1 hour to roll out all of the dough and make ravioli (with all other ingredients prepped).  The thicker the pasta, the longer it takes to cook.  I ended up making basic noodles after my pound of ground turkey was gone.

I've been making pasta for years but this was my first with semolina. Yes, the dough starts off very very dry and crumbly but as you keep kneading it will eventually soften and get more elastic. I did end up adding a splash of water to help it along though (my eggs were a little small). When the dough is rested it's quite easy to work with. Once cooked the pasta is tougher and chewier then the recipes I normally use (more like a less gritty whole wheat pasta). If I were going to make this again I would make the pasta sheets very thin and perhaps use the spaghetti setting instead of fettuccine like I did. But, I personally was a little disappointed and for all that work will not use this recipe again. My favorite off this website is still "Basic Pasta" by Pat.

Wow!  I followed the advice of everyone else and used the Kitchenaid with a dough hook. So easy!  The pasta was incredible. It's been ages since I tried to make fresh pasta, but I see no reason to try another recipe. Can't wait to try a lasagna next.

LOVE this recipe. I wanted lasagna tonight and can't handle store bought premade noodles. I usually make my own, but started looking around for a good recipe. most pastas are easy to make this was no different, but the difference was the ease of working with it after it was ready. I usually have alot of issues when using my pasta roller (I have a hand crank one), with this one it was perfection. I did up a lasagna and then cut the rest into fettucini, it was YUMM! first time I have worked with semolina too! this recipe will be my go to pasta recipe for sure!

Amazing!!! I use to make pasta with an electric machine. I recently bought a manual one. Less clean up, more hands on. Yours was the recipe I tried. It was absolutly perfect. The only change I made was I halved it. Wish I ddn't. I want more! Follow this and you will not be disappointed. Thank you!!!

I don't like giving bad reviews, but I felt that my experience with this recipe was worth sharing.  With all the great reviews, I had really high hopes for this recipe, but it just didn't work out for me.  The dough was extremely crumbly as written and I ended up having to add quite a bit of water (about 2 Tbs) as well as an additional egg to get it anywhere near kneading consistency.  My Kitchen Aid Pro 600 even had trouble kneading this.  After I finally got the dough soft enough to manage, I ran a small amount of it through my pasta roller so I could make 8 test raviolis.  I was very disappointed with the end result and ended up not using the rest of the dough.  The flavor was "okay", but the pasta was tough, even after boiling for almost 15 minutes.  I suspect that had something to do with the fact that there's egg in the dough.  Most pasta (except egg noodles) doesn't usually have egg in it.  I'm sorry, but I think I'll keep looking for an egg-less semolina pasta recipe.

Great and easy to make!  This recipe makes a ton for just two of us.  We made half and froze the other half.

This was my first time making pasta by hand, and I was surprised at how tasty it came out! I wouldn't necessarily say "easy" but it was simpler than I thought.   I did the well-method as instructed but put it in a large mixing bowl. This was much easier and less messy than doing it on the counter. I don't have any fancy kitchen equipment so I did the kneading by hand and rolled the dough out myself. It takes patience and some effort to get the dough rolled thin enough. And in the end, I should have gone thinner because my noodles turned out thicker than expected. I had added some dried basil to the mix, and the end result was some pretty tasty pasta noodles all by itself!  I think for the future I will look into a pasta roller, just to speed up the process a bit.

I live at 4600 ft above sealevel and had to add water to make the dough pliable before putting through my pasta machine. Great flavor . Reminds me of handmade pasta served at a favorite childhood resturant.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. My husband and I made a veggie-bechamel lasagna and the pasta was so light it almost melted in your mouth. Goodbye boxed pasta.

I mixed the dough in my KitchenAid mixer then finished by hand.  I added garlic powder, parsley and black pepper to my dough.  I used some high maize flour to up the fiber of the pasta. I had no issues with the flour/egg ratio. I also used egg beaters to cut the cholesterol. Delicious! ***UPDATE** In an effort to minimize my use of Egg substitute products, I tried using all organic egg whites.  I still used some high maize flour and a bit of inulin (natural fiber) powder, to up the health factor.   I skipped the oil making these fat free as well.  No fat, high fiber and sodium free as I skipped that as well.  I have learned to roll my dough sheets out and then let them dry for about 30 minutes before running through the machine.  The noodles cooked up beautifully!  Everyone enjoyed them.

I have found my pasta recipe!  I have been making pasta for a couple of years and couldn't find the right consistency.  The semolina always made the pasta grainy.  This recipe has the perfect texture.

This recipe is in an Italian cook book that I have used for years. I personally don't use that much of the regular flour(maybe half), so it is stickier when I roll it in my pasta machine. Also I wrap it in wet paper towels, inside a plastic bag, and let it rest for at least an hour. It helps to keep it moist. Only using what I need while the rest is moistened by the wet paper towels. I hope this can help others.

This was my first homemade pasta.  Everyone greedily ate my pasta up with only a clam/butter/garlic sauce on it.  It definitely is harder than regular pasta, but so worth the work.

This was my first correct pasta... what a difference the semolina makes! Just don't stop the motor of your food process until you added the oil... it will not restart. :(
I had 2 extra egg whites leftover from pastry cream I had made the hour before; it made it a bit too wet but this is easily fixed with the pasta machine, you just add a bit more flour and roll a few time at 2 or 3. I made spaghettini with a ragu sauce... now I know what it's suppose to taste like!

I like this recipe, although I did add 1 extra teaspoon of oil.  The important step is to let the dough rest at least 30 mins as indicated in the instructions.  That really helps the dough come together so that it becomes a nice consistency.

Excellent, but difficult to do without a stand mixer.   I used a '7' on the pasta machine and that or a '6' would be the best size.

I had never made pasta with adding flour. Did use the KitchenAid mixer to mix and knead the dough. Alas I don't have the pasta attatchment but do have a crank pasta maker. One of the things that survived a house fire a number of years ago. LOL. This is a great easy recipe. Next time I may add some basil and garlic.

Excellent, we just got our first pasta machine, and this was a HUGE hit with everyone. My Husband has even decided he wants to try it, and my toddler loves helping with this. One word of advice, if your using a mixer, just use it to get the ingredients to come together, than do the kneading yourself, mine is a kitchen aid and after 20 min. it still hadn't made any progress.

This turned out in the end and was delicious, but took me about an hour to finish kneading... I made a half recipe and it was so dry that I worked very long and hard to try to add liquid tsp by tsp.  I probably had to add an extra T of liquid in all. I've made noodles before, so I knew the 'soft, supple' texture needed.  I live in ND where it is dry and had already added 1tsp water to the eggs to start.  All these good reviews - shoot.

This pasta is the BEST recipe I've tried and now I'm done looking.  You'll not find a better recipe.  The consistency is perfect for the ATLAS pasta maker.  The color - a beautiful golden. The linguine was superbe.  The homemade lasagna noodles I made with this recipe were perfectly slightly chewy - no need to pre-boil them.  Wow. Thank you so much!

This turned out really great!  A suggestion for those working with your hands: make sure you roll these out thin (THIN!  If you *think* you rolled it out thin enough, it probably isn't.  Lol.  I made that mistake!).  They will plump up when you are ready to cook and wont cook properly in the center.  Flour your surface well when you are rolling it out and be sure to flour both sides of the pasta so that it doesn't stick.  ...Good luck!  :).

I'm not buying store pasta anymore, that's for sure. This was sooooo easy to make and shamelessly delicious. I made ravioli and tortellini all filled with ricotta and pesto. It was hard to stop myself from  eating it.

Used my new Kitchenaid mixer and pasta roller.  Great recipe.  Needed a touch (tablespoon?) of water to be able to work the dough other than that did not need to change a thing.

Made great Fetticine and Lasagna dough!

Will use this recipe again for sure!!

Doubled the recipe for ravioli for Thanksgiving.  This recipe is excellent!  My husband mixed and kneaded -- it took him considerable strength to knead until smooth.  We added two additional eggs (ours were labeled "large" but they weren't at all), plus another tablespoon of olive oil and a bit of water.  Beautiful dough once done.  The final ravioli were amazing as well, filled with ricotta, eggs, sun dried tomato, fresh parsley, asiago, parmesan, and romano.  Still have a lot of dough leftover, too -- we've frozen it and will use around Christmas.

Flour can very in protein content- and that affects how water and HOW much water absorbs... which could be why some had problems with flour being too much or too little. The more protein the more it absorbs water...so if it's too dry you may have had some high protein flours. You adjust with a little bit of water until you get it to the right consistency.

Tried this tonight.  It came out fantastic!  I live at altitude and the climate is quite dry so I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of water.  Can't wait to make this again.

I am sooo glad I found this recipe! I have been looking for a good recipe to work with my pasta maker forever, none of the other one works, but this one rocks!  I now can make fresh pasta even on a work day, with in an hour!!  I followed the recipe as is, but used my stand up mixer for the kneading, it looks real dry but I resisted adding anything to it, and I am glad I didn't!  The dough soften up nicely after the rest.  Thank you so much!  Our family of 4 ate up the entire batch in one go!

This is exactly how I make my pasta. The semolina makes all the difference in the world. I find that when using a pasta machine and the noodles stick together in the cutter, that means the dough is too wet. Add a little more flour.

Very easy to work with!!!  Semolina flour can be hard to find in the grocery store, I heard;however, I found mine right by the regular flour.

Really good, tasted awesome!  I did do as others said and added an extra pinch of salt.  

It was also to dry for my KA roller (Wouldn't go through), so I had to add more oil and then some water to get it to go through. 

I read that many things can effect the way a dough recipe turns out, like the humidity, sea level, and size of eggs, my 'large' eggs didn't look very large to me, so that may have been my initial problem.  

This was my first time, and after reading more on pasta dough, I learned that when 'resting' the dough, it relaxes the glutens/proteins making it more pliable.  

Also, stick your finger in the dough ball after kneading it, and it should fill back in, and look almost as if you never stuck your finger in it. That is how you know you're done kneading.  I wouldn't recommend letting the KA do most of the kneading, hand is best to build the gluten.

Just bought a pasta machine at the thrift store and made fresh pasta for the very first time. Turned out great ( well I over cooked it but that is my bust ). Can anyone tell me the best way to store the unused pasta? How long can I store it? I WILL be using this recipe again and again...

This is a good starting point. If you think it is too dry, add another egg or a little olive oil, too wet, add some flour. Eggs are not all the same size, so a little variation can impact the dough, but don't worry, just adjust! You can add herbs, lemon, pepper, and even spinach! for the spinach, blanch a cup or so and blend with eggs and adjust to a little more flour. In the end, the consistency should be play-dough your kids left out for 2-3 hours, not the mummies you find in their pockets when you do the wash.

I got an Atlas 150 pasta machine for Christmas. I used this recipe for my first homemade pasta. I started it in my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer with the paddle, then the dough hook. The bowl kept bounced off the holder, so I took the dough out and kneaded it by hand for 10 minutes. It came out perfect. I made 75 raviolis with a good amount of dough left over. Excellent recipe.

I liked the taste of this pasta, but it was DRY!!  I have made fresh pasta before, so I don't think the dryness was due to inexperience or poor measuring, etc.  Needed at least one more egg, more olive oil, and water to make is pliable.  It was a bear to get through our pasta machine because it was so dry.  I am trying it again today, with additional liquid to see if that helps.

This is very good. I took the advice of another reviewer, and used extra large eggs. The dough was perfect. It made a delicious, tender pasta. This will be my “go to” recipe!

The only reason I didnt give it 4 stars is because this is the only recipie Ive used for pasta. The taste was awesome! It mixed up great. I made fettucini and lasagna noodles. They both turned out great. Will make many more times.

The recipe was pretty great.  I read some of the other reviews that said it might be light on salt, so I put in an extra heavy pinch.  In my opinion, it still wasn't enough.  Next time, I'll just add in a little bit more salt and it should be perfect.

This made good spaghetti noodles.  I accidentally refrigerated the dough, so it wasn't as pliable.  I'll use this recipe again.  The flavor was good.

It was my first experience of making pasta!!! I read a lot and decided to try the one using semolina flour. The dough was a little hard and I had to add some more oil and some water, but anyway the result was great!!!! I think now I can't eat regular pasta from a store....

I love this one.
I add some herbs to the dough, and it makes the best fettuccine ever.

Good recipe, added olive oil while rolling it out to get the additional moisture I needed.  The oil seemed to work better than water.  Next time I will try some fresh herbs as suggested by others.

Uhhh. I messed this one up. I could not find semolina flour in the store so I bought Hodgens Mill 50/50 white/wheat flour, since I read online that semolina is actually a wheat flour. Bad move! The dough was extremely hard to roll out (I was doing this all by hand) and it took like 15 minutes to cook to a texture that was edible. I made ravioli's with the dough. My family said they liked it but I think they were just being nice. I will definitely try this again using semolina flour. I like the idea of making my own pasta and want to get the pasta attachment for my stand mixer.

I've tried a number of different noodle recipes and this is by far the best I've ever made!  Only made 1/2 recipe and it still made a ton of noodles.  Did add about 1 tsp of water but our climate is very dry (in the desert) so I often need to add a little extra moisture.  They cooked up beautifully and still held their shape.  I will difinitely make these again!  The use of a Kitchen Aid and a pasta maker made this very easy!

Loved it once I adjusted the dough with some cold water and additional oil...actually doubled the oil and slowly added cold water until I could work the dough.  I also found that cutting the dough into four pieces made the kneading easier.  I used  my grandmother's trick to knead....rolled the dough with my hand, then upended, pushed down and rolled the other way.   It helped to smooth it all out.  
Ended up being the best home made pasta I ever s recipe is huge, so I wrapped, bagged, and froze the leftover noodles.

Absolutely perfect every single time, and I've made this countless times! I put the dry ingredients in my Cuisinart bread machine, beat the eggs and stir the olive oil into them, then add that on top. Use the pasta dough setting and it's ready in less than 15 minutes. Take it out, wrap it and let it sit for a while before cutting. If I don't use it all, I wrap it well and keep it in the refrigerator. I tried numerous recipes before I found this one and this was exactly what I had been looking for. No looking back! Perfect for ravioli, spaghetti, ziti... you name it! Kudos, Jenn!

Kitchenaid users, make only one batch at a time.  I doubled it today and my 6 qt couldn't keep up.  Some flour is drier than others, and organic eggs might run small, so don't be afraid to add WATER as needed.  It's that simple!   This is the best egg pasta recipe ever.  I'm using it again today to make 2400 ravioli.

When I first made this I didn't have a pasta machine, but this still came out wonderfully with my low tech rolling pin and pizza cutter.  Now that I have a pasta machine, it comes out perfect.

Great pasta.  Easy to make.  One recipe made enough for a 9x13 pan of lasagna and about 18 cheese ravioli.

This recipe is flawless.  I make it every week now that I have a kitchen aid mixer.  Spaghetti, Fettucine, bowtie pasta, hand cut, lasagna... this recipe never fails.

I was using Giada' s pasta recipe until tonight when I tried this one. This was way better! Had a nice dense texture. We like some bite to our posts. This will be the only recipe we use from now on. Made it exactly as the recipe says. Used my Kitchenaid. Came out perfect!

To be clear, every nationality makes their pasta a bit different. No 'county' has the title of pasta king.  That being said, being a Norske, we learned early....just past toddlerdom, how to make pasta.  I am about 4 generations into the same recipe...making hundreds of people cooking alike!  

Olive oil was not something we put into pasta. If necessary, a teaspoon of water or judge your egg/flour ratio. 

I finally bought a pasta maker (for my husband so I could have it) but found I can make my pasta by hand much faster than any old mixer or machine.  It is a sin to make homemade soup and put boughten noodles/pasta into it. 30 lashes. 

Thus, I volunteer my expert pasta making for Ash Wednesday each year to our church supper. I cook for approximately 200 guests/volunteers. I start the day before in the pasta, learned to do a parboil and quick cool down with spritz of oil in each batch in fridge.  We serve soups and sandwiches, and I make homemade turkey noodle soup. From cooking the turkey, cutting it up, having the perfect blend of spices/herbs (13 different ones tossed into the bullet as one) and people know I cook that day, they get their tickets ahead of time. When it is gone, it is gone. 

Making pasta by hand is an art that all should try. My children/grandchildren were at the table by age 3 doing this. Start with 1 egg, you feel as you go how much flour you need. The less the better. Like making pie crust, the less you mess with it, the better it is.

For those having trouble with this, too dry or wet, just adjust with more flour or more water. After 3 or 4 times you will get to know what the dough should feel like. Do not skip the rest period! Give it at least 30 minutes at room temp. Do not give up! Once you have it down, it is a snap and you will laugh that you had trouble with it. The best thing to do is go to YouTube and type in "making pasta" for many different demonstrations on how to make it by hand, mixer or as I do, in the Cuisinart which is a snap and does it in 30 sec. Also it is not really necessary to knead it when it comes out of the machine as the pasta rollers will do it for you; just run through the first setting a few times until it is smooth and silky feeling and you are good to go.
Semolina can be bought at Walmart and most other grocery stores. It comes in 24oz bags and is next to the regular flours in the specialty flour section which is why it is hard to find. Also on Amazon. Just type in semolina. Bobs Red Mill is the same as the one in Walmart and comes in 4pks at $12.88 and if you order 2 pks it will be $25.76 qualifying for free shipping and no sales tax.
Hope this helps!   Mike

Have made this numerous times.  As someone who had been making pasta by hand for decades, when I began using my Kitchenaid mixer it was like an epiphany. This is a great basic recipe that I just throw into my mixer.  I do add a little more salt than a pinch.  I still roll out the dough using a hand crank pasta machine.  Another 'ah-ha' moment came when I saw a video of someone using a machine like mine.  They put the dough through the rollers for the first pass and for the second pass after feeding the dough into the rollers they crimp the two ends together (to form a circle of dough)then continue to crank the dough through the machine.  It creates something that looks like a fan belt going through the rollers, adjusting the thickness settings after each cycle through the machine.  This cuts the rolling time by about 1/2 (no feeding it through each pass).  It just shows that an old dog CAN learn new tricks.

THe best pasta I have ever had.  Simple, easy, a little extra salt.  I have made lasagna noodles, ravioli, fettachini and spagetti all with excellent results.  Just let it rest 30 minutes.  Roll it out to thickness and if cutting noodles let rest 5-10 minutes before cutting and perfect!  Never made pasta from scratch before and this is all I eat now!

This was my second attempt at fresh pasta, the first being two years ago and a disaster.  I believe the semolina made all the difference and was worth a trip to the bulk food store.  I was making ravioli without the aid of any machines.  The dough was very supple to work with after following the chilling and resting tips.  Thanks for helping me become a pasta maker!

This was ny first attempt at making pasta with my pasta maker.  I did watch a video online to see how to use the pasta machine. The pasta was very good and easy to prepare. I used this with an alfredo sauce. All in all, it is a good, basic recipe I will use again and again.  I cut the recipe in half to make four servings and for us, it was enough to serve 5-6 persons with a  salad and garlic bread. I enjoyed making my own pasta and even think this is something I can do with my grandkids.

First try with the pasta machine.. the noodles turned out perfectly as if I'd been doing this all my life.  The consistency of the noodles was great making the process a breeze.  This being my first time, I expected this to be much more difficult of a process.  I did not change anything in the recipe this time - I may try adding some herbs next time though.

this was the first time I made pasta and I must say that it was so simple and delicious I will never buy pasta again. I used my Kitchenaid mixer which made the work easier so maybe if I was hand kneading and what not I might not be so enthused. With that said, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!

O.K. this dough was too easy!!  This was the first time I made pasta.  I've been wanting to make pasta but was always too intimidated.  My mother-in-law bought us a kitchenaid stand mixer with all the bells and whistle.  I made lasagna and had enough dough to make several rounds of fettuccini noodles.  Drying the noodles was a little more challenging then I originally thought, but now I know how they get the ripple effect of store bought lasagna noodles.  This was tasty!  I'll be making this again!! So, I just made it again and I was able to make one 9x13x2 pan of lasagna, two 10x8x3 tins of lasagna and a meatloaf pan of lasagna and it came out perfect!  yah!  we're set for the month!!

Good reason to dust off my pasta machine!  Easy to work with; added spinach.  Its a good idea to double chop your spinach, nice and fine, so that it is easier to cut your pasta. Thinner is better with home made pasta!

I followed the directions carefully. The pasta  was too dry to run through the machine and then it occurred to me that eggs can be different sizes so I just added more egg until the pasta was pliable. It came out wonderfully tasted delicious.

I made this pasta dough today and it is by far the best recipe I have made. The only issue I had was the dough was a bit dry so what I did was dampen my hands in water until it reached the correct texture as I was kneading. Made fettuccini for dinner tonight and the only thing wrong was I didn't cook enough, this is my go to receipe from now on.

Excellent basic recipe. For the critics-you just need more experience handling dough and adjust accordingly. Weather,humidity,size of eggs and flour will always change consistency. Have fun!

2nd time made was easier. Before making again, watch videos on how to use kitchen aide  when making pasta to refresh.  Use paddle to start  and switch to dough hook. Will have to finish this by hand though...motor won't handle it. This recipe makes a lot so plan to freeze. Next time add dry oregano and basil and replace salt with garlic salt

This is my first attempt making pasta with seminole flour and it came out fantastic.   I loved both the flavor and the texture. I did probably have the dough a little too moist the initial couple of cuts, but it quickly dried down and was perfect.   I used my kitchenaid bowl to knead.   I used the paddle for about a minute and the dough hook for several minutes.   I let rest on the counter with a bowl covering it for about 30 minutes.   I will definitely make this again.

The recipe is well-balanced, the result is amazing. The pasta turns out out very plastical. You can make it very thin, nearly transparent - looks great in your chicken broth, or thicker - for a side dish.

I made this WITHOUT a kitchenaid! I made a 1/2 because I just wanted to try it out; so 1 c semolina, 1 c white/wheat (house blend), 2 eggs and some olive oil. Lots of kneading later, and a few drops of water as it dried, I cranked it through my pasta roller & cutter. This will be my new go-to recipe for pasta!

If anyone really wants to have fresh home-made pasta, get a good pasta machine and this recipe. The work is definitely worth it.

Loved it!! I used my Kitchen Aide to knead the dough and the pasta attachment to roll it out. It was fairly easy to make and the cooked pasta is delicious. I did have to add an a tablespoon of water to make it come together but  my eggs may have been a bit small.  Great recipe, thanks.

Love the pasta, worked great.   Have substituted wheat for the Semolina to make it a little healthier and it worked well.  Negative reviews must of done it wrong.

This is a very durable pasta.  I too experienced the recipe being a little too dry to make a dough ball.  However, I do have a couple of things that probably accounted for that.  First, I have my own chickens and therefore my eggs are not uniform in size.  So it's likely that what the recipe is calling "large eggs" might be larger than my eggs.  Second, we are having "Santa Ana" conditions here, which means that there is very little humidity in the air.  As a result, the dough would be dryer than usual.  I just added an extra egg and about two tablespoons of water (you don't have to use water.  You can use broth or tomato paste or pureed pumpkin or basically anything else that's liquid or pureed.  Realize, however, that it will really only color the pasta and not really add any flavor to it).  
I took one star off because it is a lot more work than my traditional recipe (which doesn't use semolina or olive oil so it comes out quite different).  Many other commenters talked about using their Kitchen Aid mixer, which I did too.  However, it wasn't that easy.  I equipped it with the dough hook and mixed it using the hook.  It was during this stage that I saw there were little balls of dough, but it wasn't coming together in a ball.  That's when I added the additional egg.  The dough balls were bigger, but still not one big ball.  That's when I added the two tablespoons of water and the dough came together perfectly.  Once I got the consistency right I let the Kitchen Aid run wit

I wanted to use my new pasta machine and thought I would use this for my first try.  It's a good recipe.  I used my KitchenAid to mix and ran it through my machine, after resting.  It was just the consistency and my pasta was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be using regularly.  I'd love to find similar ones to add spinach, etc. to the dough.

This was my first pasta experience and it was great! I didn't have any issues following this recipe exactly. We halved the amounts and used the kitchenaid - as recommended by many reviewers. The kitchenaid started jumping when the dough came together, so we finished the kneading by hand for another 4-5 min.  No issues with dryness or flaking. Easy to roll after a 30 minute rest and kept the remaining dough in the fridge overnight  (cling wrapped tightly). No problems rolling the next morning either. 
Don't forget to keep the pasta separated to dry on a dryer rack or on a tray dusted with flour, else it will stick and all the rolling and cutting will be wasted :(

Great recipe. I wanted to know how to make the pasta in the picture. After finding instructions online, we used a pencil (lightly floured), cut the pasta sheet into 2"x3" strips, and starting from the corner, rolled the pasta and slid the pencil out. The instructions said to wait about fifteen minutes making pasta sheets, but that made some of the sheets dry. I say wait maybe five minutes before rolling your sheets. We used kitchen aide attachment set at 4. Next time I would do 5, as when rolled 4 was a little thick. Hope that helps!

I made it two nights ago - it turned out nice and golden and eggy. We made spaghetti, and it cooked in about three minutes. Strands held together like store bought, but the pasta feels and tastes much better in the mouth. I froze some, and tonight took some from the freezer and dropped it directly into boiling salted water. Delicious. 

For those who had trouble with the consistency of the dough, I highly recommend weighing the ingredients rather than going by volume. It's the best way I've found to get consistent results. 

Oh, and I can't say enough good things about using a stand mixer to knead the dough, then rolling it out with a hand-operated machine. Results are very consistently of a high quality.

Great recipe.  Made it just as the instructions said, and as the dough came together was worried that there was too much flour. Kept kneading and eventually it was absorbed. After resting, quartered the dough and rolled out with a pin, turning dough regularly and dusting with fine semolina. Then cut  into strips. This made enough for two dinners for two.  I let the finished pasta sit on the counter for a few minutes, then put into containers like those in which I had seen fresh pasta sold, and refrigerated.  If you want more egg, just add an egg, don't worry about buying jumbo eggs. Can't wait to serve this with a ragout.

Really a great recipe!  I got the Kitchenaid pasta attachment a couple years ago and have messed around with pasta recipes a few times, but was looking for just "the right" combination of semolina and AP flour.  I think this is it!  Not to sticky, not too dry.  Couldn't stop eating it!

Awesome recipe!  My daughter and I made pasta for the the first time yesterday and used this recipe.  It was super easy to make and tasted great.  I did have to add a little bit of extra oil and water to make the dough stick together but otherwise, it was perfect as is.  Can't wait to experiment with other herbs and veggies.  Thanks!

This makes a perfect lasagna noodle. I had to add a teaspoon of water at the end of the mixing portion of the ingredients (in Kitcheniad mixer) to provide a little moisture. It will be less dry once it sits in plastic for 30 minutes. The resulting lasagna noodles were, without exaggerating, "melt in your mouth" once cooked.

I halved this recipe, and it was the first time I tried homemade pasta. I borrowed my friend's Italian Marcato Atlas 150 and made both ravioli and spaghetti. I used a stand mixer to mix, but as stated the texture was too dry. I started adding heavy cream, chicken broth and then a bit more oil to get the dough to the "not sticky not dry" consistency. Next time I will eliminate about 1/2 c of flour and try the recipe as is, adding more flour if needed. 

That said, the dough behaved very well and I could go up to 7 for my ravioli sheets, very thin without tearing. I wouldn't try this without a stand mixer though!

An easy recipe to remember and I cut the recipe in half.  I love the use of the semolina which is higher in protein. I wrapped and let it sit for about 30 minutes in refrigerator before using. I cut my portions and dipped and dusted with flour before using my pasta maker.  Here is a neat tip: use your coat hangers to catch the pasta spaghetti as it comes out if you want to dry them.

I received a pasta roller and cutter set for Christmas so I made this pasta today. My son made a ragu to go with it.  It was delicious. There were no leftovers -- it was flavorful and hearty with a nice chew.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was the perfect amount of salt. 
The video was very helpful.

The ratios are way off.  I wish I'd listened to the other reviewers.  It came out so dry and crumbly.  I ended up adding another egg and another TB of olive oil and I think I may have saved it but haven't cooked it yet.  I couldn't make this in my stand mixer it just fell apart.  Hopefully this isn't a lot of time and food wasted.

the dough was easy to work with , I did cheat and used my machines for the tough stuff. I made a full large sheet pan of ravioli and had more than enough dough left for a healthy batch of rigatoni.

Amazing!!  Used it in a fairly dry bolognese-style meat sauce lasagna.  Only change was that it didn't need the olive oil.

Didn't sift the flours - just dumped 2 cups each of all purpose and semolina, and pinch of salt into bowl of Kitchen Aid mixer, fitted with dough  hook.  Turned on mixer and dropped eggs, one at a time, scraping sides of bowl until the hook gathered the flours into a ball; then, let it knead for 4 to 5 minutes.  Into a plastic bag for 30 minutes; and then rolled out, and laid flat on parchment.

Cut the sheets to length.

Now, learn from my experience - I assembled the lasagna without first boiling the pasta.  Bad idea - pasta turned into disgusting mush.

Second attempt - boiled pasta for 15 secs or so, then plunged into ice water.  

BINGO!!! - pasta layers held form and had nice toothsome bite.

Hope this helps.

Mine was very dry. I followed the recipe pretty exactly.
Perhaps I need to sift the flour (and thereby use less)?
I ended up adding an extra egg, then some more oil and water until it was the desired consistency.
Turned out pretty delicious anyway!

this is awesome!! I made lasagna with this recipe and it's incredible!

so people need to realize that not all "all purpose flour" is the same. my all purpose flour isn't bleached and it has more hard wheat(bread flour) then soft wheat(cake flour) so what happened was it didn't have enough moisture. so I had the issue just like another reviewer had with crumbly texture. so even though all pasta recipes tell you to make a "well" and put the wet ingredients in I'm going to incorporate the flour until dough consistency is reached. I make bread and I should have done this but I figured it would be different. 

I ended up having to add more oil and water to get it to the perfect dough. but this isn't the recipes fault. it's the different all purpose flour from different companies.

It was very hard mixing and kneading by hand. It was very flakey and dry.  There was flour that could not be absorbed into the dough anymore. I did it exactly in the video and the dough did not come out as shown at all.

Not sure what I did, but made this exactly as written. I got a bunch of crumbly flour that was nowhere near a dough. I added some olive oil, still crumbly, then a tbsp of water, still crumbly. I added a bit more water but was concerned I was going to end up with leaden noodles but nothing I was doing was coming near a dough. I finally doused it with some water knowing I was probably already giving up. Then I had glue, so I threw the wad in the trash. I'm not used to failing in the kitchen, so I'm sort of at a loss on this one.

I've tried this recipe 3 times now.  And it's great if you don't follow the recipe.  The proportions are so far off its ridiculous. I would not recommend this recipe.  In order to make it work,  you have top change it all together.  Also,  I've been scratch cooking for 40 years.  Not my first rodeo.  Find a better one.  They're out there

Others say there was way too much flour but I have no idea what they are talking about. I couldn't get it through the machine with it being so wet! The last recipe I followed used TWO eggs to that much flour and I found much better success.

Don't know if it is because I live at 9000 ft above sea level but I had to keep adding water to the dough to get it soft, it crumbled terrible. Once I got that fixed it was easy and fun to work with. I added a pinch of oregano to the dough (looks like a lot but it was just a pinch) and for the filling a ricotta cheese with no egg and lots of lemon basil - wow what a combo. Made a homemade vodka red sauce and it was delish. Next time I will tweak it a bit more but all in all a good basic recipe.

a waste of an hour, six eggs and four cups of flour. 

Absolutely no way to form consistent noodles out of this dry/mealy/tough dough.  would not go through my atlas machine at "1" width.

I add 2 TBLS water and use 1 tsp salt instead of a pinch... could do even more salt.  I frequently add herbs or spice for extra flavor..  1/2 cup of finely chopped parsley does well.  I mix in a stand mixer.  After mixing done...leave in bowl, place very damp towel over the whole thing and let sit 30 minutes before working it.   (semolina available in bulk bins... not in bags... for "organic food" national chains... also available in bags in many ethnic grocery stores.. I get mine from an "India" grocery store locally)

This was so easy and it made a ton of pasta.  I can get several meals out of this.  I've tried several recipes that worked out well but this is the first one that felt like a real pasta rather than just doughy noodles.  I will definitely be making this again.

Easy to make and came out exactly as it should have. I also used my kitchenAid mixer to make it. Used the flat paddle to blend it and as soon as it came together, I used the dough hook for about 5 mins.  Dough came out nice and smooth and easy to roll. Will definitely keep this recipe.

Changes I made are just a preference to my taste:

Instead of all-purpose flour I used Tipo "00" (you can buy it on Amazon)

1/2 tsp of Kosher salt instead of 1 pinch of salt.

8 eggs instead of 6 eggs

I found pasta flour at the grocery so it was premixed. Cut the recipe in half cuz there's only 2 of us. I added about a teaspoon of  Italian seasoning this was an awesome recipe.  I will try my food processor next time to mix it.

Alright: so i discovered half a bag of semolina in my fridge early today and decided to make fresh ravioli for dinner. I found this recipe, and after realizing how big it was, i decided to halve it. Now, I'm not afraid of a little kneading, so i didn't bother breaking out the kitchenaid for this. I used Large eggs, and am going to have to agree with the reviewer who said that there's too much flour in this recipe for the amount of liquid involved. 

My dough was TOUGH. After resting a bit, it was more pliable, but it was still far too tough, and i found myself wishing i could add some egg afterward, but it wouldn't have incorporated correctly. We all know that tough dough means tough pasta. So my end result was chewy. I also agree with the person who said the recipe could do with a little more than a "pinch" of salt, as well. That said. Its an OK recipe. Not great. But its OK.

I'm an Executive Sous Chef and I used this recipe the other day. I, like most of you used a large stand mixer to mix ingredients then kneaded it by hand. It is a very simple and easy recipe to use at home and in the Professional setting. I highly recommend it!

A great recipe.  Halved the quantity and mixed it by hand. Took about 5 minutes of hand kneading for it to come together and I let it rest for 20 minutes before putting it through my machine. My usually non discerning boyfriend even noticed the difference in the quality between this and the boxed pasta I normally make.

The taste was lovely but in the pasta machine it broke to short pieces, so next time another recipe.

I just made this recipe with my boyfriend for dinner and it was amazing! I was a little worried at first that the dough would be too dry but as it kneaded it softened and smoothed out. I used my kitchenaid stand mixer to knead and then the pasta roller and cutter attachments for it to roll it out. It made great linguini! The leftover pasta is hanging over a broomstick and 2 chairs drying out right now. When it is still kind of damp but not sticky I will scrunch it up into little nests for storage and then let it dry out completely.

This recipe calls for too little liquid; the result is a crumbly, flaky, and unworkable dough. Frustrating. Another tablespoon of olive oil made it barely workable. Next time I'll add another egg, more olive oil, and maybe water, too. I find that it's easier to correct a dough that's a little too wet, by kneading in more flour, than it is to moisten a dry and crumbly one.

Maybe this is due to variations in semolina available in the US. I use very coarse milled, gritty semolina.

I added 3 tablespoons of water.  We live in the desert and have to adjust many recipes because of the low humidity.

This was the first recipe I have tried for fresh pasta and it was a hit with our whole family. It makes a ton of pasta! We kneaded the dough in the kitchen aid stand mixer with the dough hook and that really made the dough perfect. I would definitely get a rack next time to let the dough dry a bit before cooking. It kind of got a little clumpy, but that was probably user error. Overall it worked out great for us!

This turns out ok but it's so dry at first and it's quite difficult to work with. I'm going to find a new recipe for my pastas.
