Moist and delicious, even without the glaze.  Like cranberry-studded gingerbread.  I hydrated the cranberries in boiling water, drained and soaked them with 1-2 tbsp. of rum before adding them.

Scrumptious! I did add some more spices (including ginger and nutmeg) and some pecans. And I substituted dried cherries for the cranberries. Very moist and easy. A definite keeper!

I think soaking the cranberries in rum would eliminate the dry texture of the cake.  The glaze is super good but almost needed to be doubled.  It wasn't bad right out of the oven, but the next day, it was super dry.  I think the cranberries sucked all the moisture right out.

Rum, cinnamon, craisins, applesauce, caramel - toooo many competing flavors.  Cake was moist, but I did not care for the glaze at all. It did not go well with the cake, and it was thin and sugary.  I would have preferered a traditional sugar and rum syrup brushed onto the cake.

Just tried this yesterday and thought it was a little on the dry and bland side.  It definitely needs a glaze.  In addition, I would increase the amount of spices if I make it again.

Take heart, fellow non bakers!  I made this exactly as specified by the recipe, and it was moist, flavorful, and quite special.

This rating is for the cake only...no icing.  It was good, a little dry though. The Applesauce Cake in Fannie Farmer is still the best I've ever had.

Great combo of flavors, but I made a few changes: I substituted pumpkin puree for the applesauce, added nutmeg, ginger and raisins.  Also, I used fresh instead of dried cranberries, but would recommend using the dried since the fresh are incredibly tart.  Overall great texture and flavor (can really taste the rum in the glaze).  I will make this again but without the fresh cranberries.  Thanks!

Cake ended up having same texture and taste of  a fruit cake.   Did like the cranberries. As on reviewer noted was dry next day, so hydrating the cranberries in water or rum would likely have helped.   The glaze tasted good although it seemed to fall off quite easily when cutting slices. Overall ok.

Perfect cake! I skipped the glaze and, instead of applesause, added two ground Granny Smith apples.  It stayed covered overnight and next morning was nicely moist. Will bake it again and again, and maybe will add walnuts next time. Perfect combination of rum, tart cranberries, and sweetness. Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this cake many times. It always turns out well for me. I use the exact ingredients listed. I usually omit the sauce.
