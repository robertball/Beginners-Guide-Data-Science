This was awesome!!! I made a few modifications as some other reviewers suggest: added red pepper, a little more creole seasoning, and halfed the butter content. It was plenty rich and there is no need for that extra butter. Will make again!

Wow!  These were delicious.  The only thing I would change next time is to add a little more creole seasoning.  I used the recipe for 4 servings with 1 1/2 lb shrimp for extra sauce to dip hush puppies in.  I will definately make this again.

I only gave it 4 stars because it was soooo rich.  Yummy, yummy but I would add more cajun seasoning too. I made half the recipe for Valentines day and we couldn't finish our servings it was so rich.  I will serve it again, but as a side dish to a meal or appetizer.

These were yummy.  I took it to a Superbowl party and they were a hit.  Just make sure you use ready to eat shrimp.  I grabbed peel and eat by accident and the flavor did not go through to the shrimp as well. Thanks!

This was great.  I did follow other reviews and didn't use as much butter, and used more creole seasoning.  My boyfriend loved it.  I paired it with garlic mashed potatoes, and steamed asparagus.  Yummy.

This was so good!  I made this last week while in the US for my daughter's best friend and she just loved it.  I sauteed all veggies/spices/butter in my cast iron skillet then threw in the shrimp and baked.  I served with homemade mashed pototoes and french bread to sop up the sauce. Very easy and quick and yummy.

Thank you!!!  These are awesome!  I have had bbq shrimp at restaurants my whole life but never tried them myself, YUMMY! Oh, and to the people that insist that it is too much butter, obviously you have never had realy bbq shrimp before!  they are supposed to be SUBMERGED for cooking to get the full flavor.  These are not sauteed shrimp, no self respecting creole would cook them that way.  And the one who said too salty?  What?  the recipe calls for NO salt, you must have done something wrong.

I followed the recipe except, I reduced the Worcestershire to 2 teaspoons. We really do not like the taste of salt, seasonings yes, salt NO!.   Also, I only used 1 1/2lbs of butter. I used the Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site.  Everyone enjoyed young and old.

Delicious! I searched for this recipe after watching the Man vs. Food episode for New Orleans, and wanted to try the recipe. I did end up cooking the shrimp without their shells on, only because I didn't want to get so messy having to take them off after cooking them in butter. They were still amazing, and with the help of a spoon, we still got tons of flavor!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times in the past few months. However, after reviewing a few other recipes, I do add granulated garlic, cayenne pepper, thyme and basil. This is the only way we eat shrimp now.  I serve over Jasmine Rice along with French Bread for dipping.

Sorry, but I found this to be sooooo salty we could not eat it.

My husband said IF we try it again to only use a teaspoon or two of Worchestershire.

This recipe was sooooooo salty it was a waste of $36.00 in seafood,

This was awesome! It was seriously sooooooo good! My husband couldn't wait to eat because it smelled so good! I paired it with mashed potatoes as another reviewer suggested! Next time I will use more creole seasoning and about a stick less butter! (I cut the recipe in half for our family)
Update: we made the most AWESOME white pizza with the leftover
Shrimp. It was the best ever!

I have several recipes for BBQ shrimp and this is a very popular one.  I marinate the shrimp for several hours.  Messy with the shells on---but that's fun part of the dish!  You can either lick your fingers, or I have damp wash cloths for everyone.  And crusty bread is a must.  Along with corn on the cob & rice, it makes a great fun meal.

Amazing!! I made this for my boyfriend and his friends last night. I don't eat shrimp, but was tempted to try it after seeing their reactions! My bf said it was sooo good and that the flavor was like nothing he's tasted before. Really simple to make.. scaled recipe down only using 1 lb shrimp... did increase the creole seasoning for more flavor. Thanks for a great post ;o)

I have a friend who lives in New Orleans and she came to visit for a while, bringing this recipe back with her. I fell in love just like she said I would. Tastes great with jasmine rice and garlic bread (lots of carbs but well worth it). I didn't get a chance to ask her for the recipe before she left and this one turned out exactly the same. Delicious!!

I made enough for 12 oz of shrimp.  I followed the recipe, but I used less butter and much less rosemary. I  added a teaspoon of both  smoked paprika and onion powder.  It was wonderful!

I made this recipe but varied it by using 6 lbs. of peeled, deveined shrimp and reducing the butter to only 2 sticks plus 1/4 cup of olive oil.    Wonderful flavor and much less fat.  Serves about 10 people.

Wonderful! I eat this out everywhere but never made it! This was GREAT! The Creole seasoning is salty but is wonderful! I like it spicey! I added a little more butter to chill out the salt! Everyone loved it! I will make it again!

Very easy to make....next time, I will not use quite as much butter. One stick of butter was plenty. It smells pretty good, would prefer a spicier, bolder taste - maybe the butter took away from that some. It was good, I would have given it a 5 if had a bolder taste.
Thanks for sharing.
Have fun cooking.

I made half a recipe and I cut  as the other reviewers said and added in more of the creole seasoning and less of the worchestshire sauce and it was way too salty for me! 
I loved everything but all the salt! The shrimp cooked beautifully and I loved the onions, celery and I served mine over rice and with crusty bread but I felt like I was licking a cow’s salt lick! UCK!
 seriously!

Made for my cousin's 50th bday party and everyone loved it and making it again for another party for her. Next time I'm not going to use as much better.

Excellent.  Didn't have celery and parsley, but didn't feel like it was missing anything.  Had BBQ shrimp in the French Quarter 3 weeks ago and this was just as amazing!  So easy to make.  Thank you, I will be using this recipe many times.

Absolutely delicious. We halved the recipe, and based on others reviews used even less butter than that, and also cut down a teenie bit on the worcestershire. It was still decadent and buttery and delicious. I probably will only make it once a year on Fat Tuesday because I feel my arteries clogging as I type, but this was fantastic. Served it over rice and used hot sauce for an extra zing.

Extraordinary flavor.   It was delicious.  I did make one modification.   Instead of 2 tbsp of Creole I used one and added 1tbsp of Swamp Fire seafood boil.  This added a little heat and burst of flavor.
