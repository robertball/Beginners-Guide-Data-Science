This was wonderful! I omitted the onion and mushrooms due to personal preferance, and added thinly sliced red bell pepper and crumbled blue cheese.  The blue cheese melded very well with the dressing.  Also, I chose to use the Catalina "Light Done Right" dressing, as well as turkey bacon to save on fat and calories, and could not tell a difference.  Excellent!

Yummy, I have used both a warm bacon dressing and a honey garlic dressing.  I am just not a catalina fan.  But there is nothing like fresh spinach salad.  I love it.

Very good, you can buy pre-packaged pre-washed spinach in most any grocery store these days, this makes the prep of this even easier!

I made this for lunch today for Robert (son #1) & I, and we both enjoyed it.  Of course I cheated & used, "real" bacon bits, and I also used a french type dressing, "Grandma's French Dressing" (from this site) as I didn't have any catalina at the time.  Good salad, Thanks K-R-A-F-T!!

Very well received by my dinner guests. I omitted the egg and added mandarin oranges and julienned carrots. Served the catalina as well as poppy seed dressings on the side.

I used baby spinach and another Kraft dressing similar to Catalina except it also has poppy seeds. I don't care for hard boiled eggs, so I added clementine slices instead(cut in half)because I had them on hand. Mandarin oranges would also work. My family loved this- my daughter tasted it before dinner and asked me to double the quantity. She was right- it disappeared.

I made this salad tonite to accompany my leftovers and it was delish. I think the dressing is perfect with the spinach and wouldn't change a thing.

I used to make salads for a cafe. If you want to have this salad as an entree I would suggest you make the spinach your base add julliene raw carrots and purple cabbage (sometimes sold prepared in baggie at grocery),then some cherry tomatoes, next topped with grilled chicken breast marinated in poppyseed dressing, then finally topped with the bacon, chopped pecans, blue cheese and place the thinly sliced red onion rings around the salad.

I think this would be excellent as it is but because I have one of the world's pickiest eaters for a son,I made some changes.  First, I had to leave out the mushrooms and onions. I used a package of Oscar Meyer bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon and used Dorothy Lynch Homestyle Dressing instead of Catalina.  I also added croutons. My son ate 3 servings!
