We loved it!  I didn't have sesame oil so I just used a bit of olive oil and some sesame seeds.  I also added a lot more rice vinegar, maybe about 1/4 cup, and water , 1/4 cup, to the mix so that the cucumbers were slightly swimming.  I put them in the fridge for an hour or so.  Very yummy and my guests loved them as well.

These are delish.  We frequent a Korean Mandu joint here in DC where they serve a cucumber kimchi dish that tastes just like this.  Thanks for the recipe.  Love it!

2-17-2017  ~My mission was to find a cucumber salad that was something different from the same old cucumbers with sour cream or tomato-cucumber salad.  What a happy, delicious find this was!  I made a few minor tweaks, but nothing that really changed the recipe.  For instance, because of Hubs’ sensitive innards, I had to take the heat level down to “coward” level by eliminating the chili oil altogether (and replacing it with an equal measure of vegetable oil) and using just a wee pinch of the crushed red pepper flakes.  Hubs said he didn’t even notice the red pepper flakes were in there, so I guess I’ll “kick it up a notch” next time!  Other than that I stuck with the recipe exactly as directed – and would only change one thing.  It was a little salty for us.  Next time I’ll either reduce the salt by maybe half, or rinse the salted cucumbers, contrary to the recipe’s instructions.  For the sugar, I used a sugar substitute which, if nothing else, simply made me feel good.  I think some toasted sesame seeds, or black sesame seeds, would have been a worthy addition, tho’ this was pretty much flawless as is.  As with some other 5-star recipes I’ve tried, the biggest error I made was in not making more than I did.  We scarfed up every last bit.

I absolutely love the sauce.  I have made this many times now, sometimes it's with cucumbers and sometimes with shredded tofu skin.  Both of which is very delicious.  I did find that if I were to follow the recipe, it would be too salty for me, so I basically only put in half of the called for salt.  I also found that it is not a good idea to soak the cucumbers in the dressing over night, as they get very soggy and the whole thing gets very watery.  I don't sprinkle salt on the cucumbers either, as I found that makes them give off water even more, causing them to become soggy.  When I make it with cucumbers I basically dip the cucumbers in the dressing or I pour the dressing over them right before I eat them.

This was the best recipe for this I've seen for this salad. Instead of sugar, chili oil, and garlic, I used 1 tbsp of asian chili garlic sauce. It was PERFECT!

Loved this recipe!!! I love cool and spicy flavors so I tweaked my recipe a bit. I didn't have Hot Chili Oil so I substituted Garlic Chili Paste at 1 1/2 teaspoons (for the extra heat!). I also substituted the Toasted Sesame Oil for Pure Sesame Oil at 1 teaspoon. Turned out fabulous and I can't wait to make this for a dinner party!

8 8 17 ...  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228067/spicy-asian-cucumbers/ ... First impression, sweet; second, salty; third, spicy; fourth on, salty.  Sometimes I think I know what I'm doing so eventhough the recipe said to not rinse the cucs, I did & it's still salty - soy sauce.  I like soy sauce & I'll finish these, but I'm disappointed.

Ok recipe but I think it is lacking, perhaps since it is only cucumbers. The dressing is good, so I might use it for other salads.

3.9.17  Used low-sodium soy sauce, but I know the sodium is still high, otherwise, this recipe breaks down pretty well nutritionally.   I may have had a tough-skinned cuke, but in the future, I will peel the cucumbers, the skin was just too chewy.   This had a nice fresh taste and a good balance of heat.   Do allow time for this to chill, as the flavor definitely improves.  Other than the two comments above, wouldn't change a thing, we enjoyed these cucumbers as written.

We have a ton of cucumbers from the garden so I am always on the lookout for recipes.  This is the very best yet.  I made no changes and the salad was perfect, even picky teenagers ate it up!

This is really good and so easy!  Very simple to adjust the heatness to your liking.
