This is very good. Does have a little heat but not too much. Did not have the chili-garlic sauce. I used garlic and chili powder and threw in some parm chese along with the other dry spices, left out the mustard, and made it a dry rub that I sprinkeled on after rolling in  the catalina dressing.

First off this was awesome! Now my grill is out of order so I thought I can adapt this to the oven. Also I didn't have Catalina dressing, but I did have Dorothy Lynch which I think is similar. So I used just a shade less than 1/2 C of Dorothy Lynch instead of Catalina. I didn't have white pepper so I put in just 1/4 tsp of black pepper total, for fear that it might be too much. Other than that I kept the ingredients the same. I smeared the sauce on the fillets and then baked them uncovered in a baking dish for 20 minutes at 425 degrees. I cooked 2 fillets, but the recipe made enough for 3 or 4. It is a little spicy but I like spice, and I love Sriracha so it worked for me. I was worried that the 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder would be too much, but it was perfect. I think next time I might cut the temp back to 400 or cover the dish because some of the sauce ran off the fillet into the dish and did start to burn a little. Thanks for submitting the recipe.

To begin with we love Swai fish fillets. When following a recipe, I always try my best to follow the directions exactly before commenting on a dish on this website. However, with this dish we had to make our own Catalina dressing as we didn't have any on hand. I don't like white pepper so I left that out as well. The fish turned out perfectly. It took 12 minutes to cook them and the sauce was great. We have never had Swai cooked like that so it was a nice change. I made some refried rice to go with the fish and together it was as good as any oriental restaurant has to offer. The only thing I can add is the next time we make this dish together it will include the normal Catalina dressing and not our own concoction. Definitely a keeper!

This was my first time trying Swai and I am so glad this is the recipe I chose. I was very hesitant because Catalina dressing is a little too sweet for me on a salad but pair it with the other goodies in this recipe and slap it on fish and you have yourself a winner. It is rather spicy though so if you are sensitive to that you might want to leave out the crushed pepper flakes or cut back on the Sriracha. Can't wait to try this one on catfish this summer!

This was a very good recipe. The fish was not the typical flavor and that was good. We have made this twice. The second time we subbed out the mustard for Curry Powder and it gave the fish a really interesting zing.

Made this in the oven. I added Catalina to the dry ingredients and brushed it on the Swai. Sided it with asparagus that I cooked next to the Swai and a chopped salad. Would recommend it to anyone!

Very good! I've never tried this kind of fish before and I will definitely buy again! I didn't use Catalina dressing, but I did use French. And used only black pepper and not white! Very delicious!

I just made this. (Blue dish) pretty yummy! I guess I just like my spicy too much, so I added more sriracha. Yummy yummy in my tummy.

I eliminated then Catalina dressing and cooked it in the oven instead of a grill.  It turned out really good, my girlfriend and I both loved it.  Nice spicy flavor, but not too much.
