I made this with a few changes -- use about 1 heaping Tablespoon  of ketchup instead of stewed tomatoes and  about  1/4 c. of juice from pineapple -- very  good over rice ....

Delicious and came together very quickly. I used both leftover kielbasa and about 3 beef brats which I sauteed in olive oil with the onions, eventually adding thawed frozen multi-colored peppers. I added additional apple cider vinegar and also honey, adjusting the flavor to my preference. In place of the tomatoes, I added a few tblsps of ketchup. My pineapple was fresh, but I didn't add anything close to two cups. A little garlic powder and cayanne can't hurt either. Will be good for today's game....GO PATS!!!

This is an unusual combination of flavors, but the salty-sweet-tangy dish came together pretty quickly.  It's a different take on smoked sausage, and I can't honestly say I'll do it again, since we love more savory dishes prepared with smoked sausage.  This works great with pantry items, so for a quick turn-around, it's worth the effort.  I do think the sausage should be sliced thinner, though.

We substituted duck sauce (yep, the little packets from take-out) for the preserves and omitted the vinegar, plus added a little bit of honey. DELICIOUS over brown rice.
