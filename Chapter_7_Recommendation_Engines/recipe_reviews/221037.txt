This was pretty good and very easy to make.  I think that next time I may add a little spice to liven it up a little bit.  Thanks for posting the recipe

Used about 6 oz of ham and a little more sweet onion. Also used sweet pickle relish for the capers.  Very tasty, indeed.

try adding maple syrup and omitting the capers.. I added more mustard and chopped sweet pickles for a little kick as well.  I have been making a similar recipe with cream cheese for years. I am always asked for the recipe.
