I loved this recipe - the only reason I did not give it five stars was the inconsistency with the ingredient list.  The list names chili oil, but not sesame oil.  The directions include the use of sesame oil, but do not specify how much.  This dish could turn bad if you add too much.  However, overall very east and fast for a weeknight dinner.  It is just as delicious using a different flavor of ramen noodles also.

My boyfriend loves this soup, and it's so easy to make!  I usually double this recipe and add some mushrooms.  It's very tasty!

I made this to share with my husband for lunch yesterday. I'm quite sick and have literally no appetite (you don't want to eat what you can't smell) but this was very simple for me to prepare and very comforting. I could taste it a little and thought it was quite good. My husband ate his portion, then turned right around and made it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and think it is a great base recipe for alteration for your individual tastes.  

What I did do to make it a bit healthier was to use fresh, finely chopped celery and carrots and frozen organic peas in stead of dehydrated vegetables and I cut the sodium-loaded flavour packet out altogether.  I also did a direct exchange for the soy sauce and used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead.  This is a really great product that tastes just like soy sauce but has less sodium.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe, Dakota!

I thought this recipe was wonderful! The ingredients didn't list sesame oil but at the end the cooking instructions say to garnish with green onion and sesame oil. Also, what's chili oil? I just added some crushed red peppers to sesame oil.

I've been augmenting Ramen Noodle Soup for years. Try poaching eggs on top--just til the whites are set-- for extra protein and a full meal dish.

Good soup! I used chicken broth for a richer flavor. I also added minced garlic and half of pack of sezchuan seasoning mix for a little extra kick.

I had a huge box of ramen noodle soup I bought at one of those warehouse stores.  My daughter swore she loved ramen noodles at the store, but after we got home she never wanted any.  This recipe is what I have been looking for.  This soup is absolutely delicious, quick, and easy!

The ideal soup to make on the shoe string budget, really easy and can be carried around too! I could live off of this alone, with the addition that I sometimes add leftover Chinese BBQ pork. Thanks for sharing Verona!

I used spicy sesame and chilli oil, and too much, so it was too hot - but still so tasty! I tried chow mein noodles because I had them on hand, but the milder taste of ramen would have been better. I'll definitely make it again, but obey the ingredient list next time! Otherwise a very delicious soup, great for busy vegetarians! Edit: I forgot to mention - I added a can of mixed Chinese vegetables, like water chestnuts, baby corns, and bean sprouts, and slivered a portobello mushroom as well. Savoury!

I thought this soup ended up tasting really good and it was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and made a few changes. I used 3 cans of vegetable broth and 2 packages of ramen noodles (omitting the seasoning packets). I couldn't find chili oil, but I did find a chili sesame oil blend, so I used 1 tsp. of that. I used ginger paste instead of minced ginger. I didn't use any green onions, but I did use sliced mushrooms and a frozen stir fry mix with sugar snap peas, green beans, red peppers, celery, broccoli, onions, and water chestnuts. I also used dehydrated garlic slices while the broth and noodles were boiling, and added some more when I added the veggies. I put some Sriracha chili sauce on the table so everyone could add as much as they wanted to their individual bowls. The flavor was good without the hot sauce, but I thought it added a nice heat to the soup!

This was REALLY good and tastes even better than the packaged stuff!  I added tiny diced carrots, celery, onions and red bell pepper, garlic and ginger and simmered about 10-15 min then added the soy sauce, 1 raw egg, thinly sliced shitake mushrooms and the noodles for 4 minutes.  I didn't have the chili or sesame oils and it was still great.  Will make again!!!!

This is a really great Ramen Recipe. I used Beef Broth instead of Vegetable Broth, and used plain Ramen (Top Ramen). I added about a cup of cabbage and onions to the sauce pan with some sesame oil and cooked htose before adding the broth and noodles. I will deffinately make this again, maybe with some barbequed pork or beef and some mushrooms too.

Delish! And cheap! I boiled the veggie stock, then threw in red bell pepper, and green onion.  I then threw in the soy sauce, chili oil, and ginger.  Mixed it.  Then I threw in the ramen noodles, and cracked an egg (keeping it whole) into the boiling water.  Be careful.  The ramen noodles cook quick (3 minutes for mine).   Very yummy, and more complete with a poached egg.

I was looking for a broth recipe to replace the seasoning packets that come with ramen (to aviod the MSG) but this wasn't good at all.  The flavor wasn't great and the chile oil added too much heat.  No broth with a little sesame oil and teriyaki is much better.

Excellent starter soup.  I have always stayed away from store-bought ramen broths.  Now I can eat all the ramen I want... without fear of horrible ingredients in the broth packets!

Like others, I added more vegetables (in my case, I added 1/4 cup each of thinly sliced carrots, green onions, celery, cabbage and red pepper) and I enhanced the broth with 1 tsp each of fresh minced ginger and garlic.  Yum!  My teen kids were over the moon.

I loved this recipe, I threw out the seasoning packet that comes with Ramen noodles (it has beef/chicken fat in it and im a vegetarian) i used chili powder instead of oil and added some Cayne pepper for a kick, and i didnt use the GingerRoot either. also used a 1/2 can of mushrooms and left out the dried veggies and it was really good, i make this all the time now!! 

Another cheap way to make this is to buy Lo Mein Noodles instead of ramen (i had these on hand one night and no ramen) and followed the same recipe it was pretty good also

Wow!  I had never  thought to add all this goodness to Ramen.  Used fresh veggies I had on hand.  I also put fresh spinach in the bottom of my bowl before adding to soup.  This is such a fast easy meal.  perfect when you are in a time crunch but still needing to eat.

My housemate and I love this soup. I've used rice noodles, cappelini, etc. in lieu of the ramen noodles. I also add garlic (1/2 tsp), mushrooms, spinach and tofu to mine to make it a healthier meal. Delicious!

I grew up in a culture that eats LOTS of ramen. After becoming a vegetarian, I wanted to come up with a way to make a veggie ramen, and this does not fail! This was amazing; the flavor was rich and I definitely don't miss any meat. Thank you for your recipe!

This soup was good. I like that I can make Top Ramen (which I love) with veggie broth. I didn't have chili oil so I used chili sauce and it worked great. Very tasty and easy.

This one was so hard to rate due to the incredibly high salt content. I bought Ramen noodles without that nasty salt packet and used my own seasonings. A really good base recipe that you can easily make your own. Thanks Verona!

If you use their seasoning packet I don't think you'll need any more soy sauce.  You can add any vegetable you like, some ideas are: Chinese cabbage (don't cook it too long), regular cabbage, bok choy etc., for meat: left over chicken...

This had an off taste to me for some reason. Could have been because I didn't have the chili paste so I added the chili flavored seasnoning packet.

This is a great recipe.  I must say it was a bit hot for my taste but i will deffinately make this one again.  next time i will  only use a splash of chili oil.  you can always add more.  when i looked at the ingredients i didn't see green onions so unfortunately didn't pick any up at the store.  next time i will be sure to add the green onions i think i will add some carrots also.

A great recipe but there is some discrepancy between the ingredient list and the instructions, namely the mentioning of sesame oil when it is not on the list

This soup is HEAVENLY!  The flavoring is exellent.  I added some garlic and mushrooms, and didn't add the chili oil because I didn't have any.  So easy to put together, too.  The only reason I gave it four stars is the high sodium content.  Great soup!

This recipe was pretty good. Definitly better than using the prepackaged flavoring. But the recipe was a little confusing with the sesame/chili mix up.

I liked the ease and simplicity of this recipe.  Like others, I tossed the packet that comes with the ramen noodles as it is loaded with salt.  I also figured that the reason there was no amount to the sesame oil, is that you can drizzle it into each serving to personal taste, and your own preference to spicy sesame oil or regular. Very simple and good.

This soup was good. I did make some changes, I added stir fry vegetables as someone suggested. I added garlic chili sauce instead of chili oil. I doubled the soy sauce because I had sodium lite stock. I add leftover chicken and added it at the end just to heat up.Used one fourth teaspoon sesame oil{srong flavor} adjust to taste. My son liked it but asked not to add sesame oil next time. Easy to make. Will use for busy days

Very easy and tasty recipe. Add as many vegetables as you like. Do remember to serve the soup fresh and hot, else the noodles will soak-in and become soft and soggy.

Delicious. Added bok choy, carrot, mushrooms and peas. 
Add the bok choy stems and carrots as it starts boiling. After 5 minutes add the bok choy leaves , mushrooms and peas. 
This was a huge hit, and I'll definitely be making it again.

Five stars for a really great starter Asian noodle soup...I made mine with zucchini and carrots cut into 1 1/2 in. sticks...threw in some mushrooms, fresh garlic, ginger and green onions. I was able to get some fresh noodles too and with the vegetable broth, soy sauce and a splash of sesame oil and sriracha sauce...YUM, just what I as was looking for...delish!

good recipe. i added mushrooms to mine and doubled the amount of soup. i also added about 2 teaspoons of sesame oil in place of the chili oil since i have a family member who can't have spicy food. plus, it had a nuttier flavor that i just love.

This recipe is good !
I tried it without the chilli oil and varied the method of cooking to my liking.


1. I fried the ginger and some fresh veg. in sesame oil (mixed with olive); I set this aside.

2. I cooked the ramen separately, drain it and soak it in cold water to get more "springy" noodles. Thereafter, I drain the cold water away.

3. I combine the other ingredients (seasoning, dried vegetables, ginger and fresh vegetables) with the ramen; pour in some hot water and bring the whole thing to a gentle boil before removing it from the heat.

4. Serve with chopped spring onions and dash of sesame oil.

Hope you like this !
Xx

I increased the soy, added sesame oil instead of chili and increased ginger spice. It was good but mild, like an appetizer before an Asian meal. Glad I added a lot of mushrooms and spinach, for color and taste. 2nd time I also added chopped egg, carrots and fresh snap peas.

This was a wonderful, easy recipe. I love making this when I have no time to cook. My version is slightly different though! I add 1/2 a chopped yellow onion and let it simmer with the soup. I use chili powder instead of chili oil. I also add garlic and cayenne pepper. I never add the packet that comes with the Ramen.

Made this and couldn't believe how delish this was. I made a couple of changes. One- be careful how long you boil the noodles. They cook FAST! the first batch I made was too soft. Two- I boiled the ginger with the broth. It gave it a great ginger taste. This is the first time I ever used ginger. Three- I doubled the Chili oil for flavor. I don't think it would have been as good without. The spice was perfect with a full teaspoon.

This soup is so simple yet tasty! I added chopped red bell pepper and a dash of red pepper because I like it hot! I also used 1/4 teaspoon of seasame oil and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Once I tried this receipe, I will never go back to using those powder flavor packets again...

Delish! This is a dish that you can change to your liking. Ironically, I am a spice girl (not the band) and I love to mix it up. My husband loved this recipe. It's quick to make with very few ingredients. I used Hot chili oil and hot chili sauce which you can find a your local grocery store in the ethic section. By the way, they need to expand that section big time. Use any veggies you want. It's a great starting recipe to build from and we enjoy it greatly. Blessings

Super fast, cheap & tasty recipe.  Ramen  noodles were on sale 6 packs for $1.  I added frozen edamame and sriracha hot chili sauce (instead of chili oil) for texture and spice.

I think this is a great basic recipe and my boyfriend can't get enough.  I usually start it out the way the package asks.  Two cups of water, throw in the flavor packet and the noodles.  I'll then get it up to boiling, adding in the seasonings, meat (hot dogs, shrimp, chicken, beef) and some veggies (fresh and frozen) and leave it there for the 10 minutes until most of the liquid is gone.  The boyfriend doesn't like liquid in his noodles.  Take it off the heat, mix in 1/2t sesame oil and then add whatever else is wanted.  Eggs, mushrooms, and other veggies that I feel would be better going in after.  I've found that I prefer it better with the flavor packet as it soaks into the noodles better and it's a little less that I have to go out and purchase later.

This is a great basic recipe that you can really experiment with. It's very good as is, but I sometimes like to use shrimp-flavored ramen, and add a tsp of Thai tom yum soup paste. Also, chicken ramen with some shredded chicken is great too. Thanks, Verona!

Great beginnings - From others I added garlic, thin sliced carrot, water chestnuts,  1 baby bok choy, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, thin green onion to put on top with a poached egg.  Dash of soy sauce & sweet & spicy chili sauce.  Would have added ginger but not on hubby's top ten list.  If leftover chicken or anything in fridge that might go with it.  Use any kind of broth.  Oh ya ....  made enough for leftovers.

Tasty! The recipe lost one star because 10 minutes is too long for most ramen to cook; the noodles ended up mushy. But otherwise it's a nice improvement on the spice packet.

Delicious and so easy for a quick lunch.
I used some meat from last night's baked chicken and tossed in some carrots, peas, and red pepper strips that I had on hand. I also used sesame oil in place of the chili oil. This was ready in just 10 minutes.

Good and quick.  Not great, tho.  The noodles became overcooked ... next time I'd either add them at the end, or not cook them so much, or something.  Oh, I added egg to make it egg-drop-ish.  That was good but I probably wouldn't add egg the next time because it pretty much disappeared within the noodles.

Added some tofu and a couple dashes of fish sauce.  Really yummy!  Although a touch of chili oil would be good, I used sesame and threw in a few red pepper flakes.

Great base! You can change it to your taste and add ingredients like mushrooms, spinach, carrots, boiled egg, bamboo shoots, snap peas, etc. This time around I cut 5 slices of ginger (too lazy to chop small), used red chili flakes, and boiled everything together with veggies for a few minutes before adding frozen pork dumplings and the ramen last. If you're going for leftovers, separate the ramen so it doesn't get too mushy!

I highly recommend this! If you're not feeling well or fighting a cold, this would especially be a good soup to have. I did use 1/2 packet of the chicken seasoning packet that came with the soup, as well as 1 tsp of no-sodium chicken granules (afraid of the high sodium content with the soy sauce). I didn't have chile oil so subbed with Siracha sauce, and also used powdered ginger, garlic and onion powder, and some chopped canned mushrooms. The longer cooking time gives the noodles a different (better) texture than when normally prepared. I forgot I was having ramen noodles because it tasted like something from a restaurant! Thanks dakota for a great recipe that I'm sure to use again!

Great recipe concept! I used 3 packs of ramen noodles (chicken flavored), one 12 oz bag of frozen mixed vegetables and 2 hot dogs cut up into finger nail size pieces. I put on a pot of cold water and when it boiled I added the noodles and let the pot reboil. While that was going I put the the frozen vegetables in a sauce pan with 1/4 cup of water and 1tbs butter heated on medium heat covered, after 5-6minutes drain liquid from vegetables and added to the pot with noodles and also add chicken flavor packets that came with ramen noodles let stimmer (low heat) for a few minutes while cutting up the hotdogs into little bites. Take 1/4 cup of the noodles/vegetable broth and add to the same sauce pan with the hot dog pieces cover with lid, stir a few times so it doesn't burn approx 5 min then add to pot, stir and enjoy

Not much you can do to make ramen noodles into a fantastic meal. But this was pretty good.  I used a chicken picante ramen so it added a bit more heat to it.

This soup was DELICIOUS.  I didn't use sesame oil or chilies because I had neither, and it was still great.  I took others' advice and used garlic and chopped carrots and celery, along with some frozen peas and onions.  I used 1 can chicken broth plus 1 1/2 cups of water because that's all I had, and it was YUMMMMY.  I will try other variations with different veggies in the future, for sure.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Fast, easy, and very tasty. I used 1/4 teaspoon of sesame seed oil (since the exact amount to use wasn't in the ingredient list) and topped each bowl with 1/2 hard-boiled egg. Yum! It turned out great.

What a nice change to my usual bowl of ramen! The only think I didn't like was the color. Perhaps its my veggie boullion it made the color kind of murky. Nice flavor, will make again.
