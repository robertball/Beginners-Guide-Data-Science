The blend of spices makes sweet and sour in a bad way.

My partner and I both love this recipe, perfect for lunches the next day. I add more black beans than it calls for usually and itâ€™s nice with fresh tomatoes in the summer. Easy and tasty :)

I mixed all the vegetables first, and put on the dressing. When I tasted it, I thought, "This is very much like Cowboy Caviar, and the bow tie pasta won't add anything!" So I took it to the potluck as Cowboy Caviar, and it disappeared.

My husband loves cold salads in the summer, but my issue is that most of them just are not hearty enough.  The black beans in this is just the trick.  I've experienced in the past that the chili tomatoes are too spicy for our liking, so I just used 1/4 of the can.  I also added some zucchini from the garden.  I hope other users suggest different spices to use for this dish.  I was not sure what I could use that wouldn't be too spicy.

Added a bit of purple cabbage and garbanzo beans. Too spicy. Will add only 1 tsp garlic powder and no Cayenne next time.

Great recipe! Great blend of spices and flavors. It's not too spicy but definitely has a lot of flavor. It's also very easy. I didn't chill the pasta in the fridge, just ran it under cold water, added it to the spice mixture and served it immediately. You can add whatever you want to this pasta - I omitted the chiles and onions and added black olives.
