This recipe was easy and tasty but missing some zing, so I added 2 tbsp. lime juice, 1/2 diced red pepper, 1 jalapeno pepper - seeded and diced, salt and pepper to taste.  It tasted wonderful over my grilled salmon.  I have already made it twice, it is so fast to make.  It would probably taste good over grilled chicken breasts too.

Very very good.  I served this at a get together for my mother's birthday.  I used salmon filets instead of steaks, and baked them at 375, after lightly brazing them in a pan with salt, pepper, and olive oil.  They were a hit!  The salsa was incredible, and not too spicy for my 81 year old grandmother.  Very colorful, and pleasing to the eye as well as the pallette.  My family raved.  Thanks.

I made this recipe in 15 mintues flat.  It was fast, tasty and good over green salad with a little bit extra red wine vinegar

I love salmon and mango together, but this was just okay. My tomato didn't have much flavor, so that may have something to do with it. I prefer my own recipe of salmon with mango puree: salmon fillet breaded in a mix of ground toasted almonds and sesame seeds, then pan fried in olive/sesame oils; topped with a puree of mango, sauteed garlic and red pepper, rice wine vinegar, and a bit of sugar. It's great, if you wish to try it. This one's just a little boring.

The salmon needs to be seasoned with S&P before placing into the broiler, but otherwise it's really easy and delicious.  The skin comes out crunchy and crispy.  Very nice.

It's true that the salmon did go very well with the mango, but I wished that the mango flavor was a bit sweeter - it could be that mine wasn't 100% ripe. Next time, I may add a tablespoon or something of sugar over the mango, but that's just personal taste. Overall, very tasty.

Delicious recipe!  I like it with a little more spice, so I added Cajun seasoning to the salmon and then sauteed the salmon in a pan.  You can also use a combo of garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper to give it some flavor.  The spices compliment the sweet salsa taste.

I used less onion, more garlic and less tomatoes.  And, I pureed the whole salsa which was a hit that way!  I also added a bit of red chili flakes.

Made this twice. Good the first time but lacked flavor and spice. Second time I seasoned my salmon with olive oil, Emeril's "Essence" and lime juice. Marinated one our them smoked in the Weber (about 30 min) with Cherry wood. to the salsa I added a pinch of red pepper flake and finished with a good squeeze of lime juice. Awesome! Recipe version still gets four stars as it is a great starting point.

My husband and I loved this the most.  I will have to use the chutney mix for other things!  The kids didn't like the red onion and mango combination.

I enjoyed this recipe as is and then of course made changes the second time around. First of all I feel like this recipe is all about the salsa and very little about the salmon. I started by brushing olive oil over the salmon and then sprinkling it with lemon pepper and dill. Next I made a mango sauce by adding the diced fruit of one mango into a small sauce pan and adding 1/2 c. cream and 1 Tbsp. lime juice. (Be careful not to curdle your cream.) When this was hot, I used my hand blender (a normal blender would work too) to blend this into a creamy sauce. I spooned this sauce over my grilled salmon and around on the plate and then scooped the salsa on top of that. For the salsa I reduced the amount of onion and garlic because these things tend to overpower the recipe for me. I also added a sliced avocado and the juice of half a lime. WOW what a great flavor. I know that I made a lot of changes, but I liked the recipe as is and I love it when I read a recipe that gets me thinking about how I can creatively make it even better. Thanks for the great recipe KASIAN.

This recipe was really blend and there is no flavour to it. I had to fix it up.

Salmon:

Marinate salmon for an hour with basil, paprika spice, garlic powder, oil, a little bit of lime juice and salt and pepper. 

Bake it for 45 mins or you can bbq wrapped in a foil.

 

Mango Salsa:

Dice up the mangoes, green onion, tomatoes and cilantro.

Add a little bit of lime juice, a little bit of olive oil and the chilli flakes.

Serve over salmon.

This was so amazing!

The mango salsa with the salmon was excellent! The only thing I will add next time is a little salt. I added an extra heap of cilantro to the salsa along with the mangos after it was done cooking. I also put it on top of the salmon and put it back into the broiler for 2 more minutes. Served with quinoa it was great!

the recipe by itself is lacking. there is no salt and/or pepper anywhere in the recipe so i added some salt and pepper to the fish and some salt to the salsa. also added some lime juice and jalapenos to give it more authentic salsa flavors.  one other thing, the amount of salsa is way too much. i'd suggest cutting the amount in half

Delicious! I did not sauteed the onion/garlic, I just prefer fresh and I think it goes better this way. I squeezed a lime in the salsa for more flavor. Also, my husband grilled the salmon, it does give a nicer flavor.

The salsa is excellent.. I only gave it 4 star because the actual salmon is in my opinion not well seasoned.  I used the grilled salmon recipe for the marianate and marianated it over night and added the salsa to it and it was a huge hit at my dinner party!  I will be using the salsa recipe over and over again with other kinds of fish too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Full, robust flavor.  One of the bast salmon dishes I have ever had. I made it according to the recipe, except I used yellow onions as I did not have red.  Next time I might try adding pineapple.  I will be making this again.

Like others, I used a salmon filet...  braised it in garlic and olive oil on a cast iron skillet, which I then put into a 350 oven for 10-15 minutes..  Likewise, I jazzed up the mango salsa with red pepper flakes, extra garlic, several Tablespoons of cilantro, a dash of cumen and turmeric, and shallot.    OMG, can hardly wait to make it again.  Thanks for this winning recipe!!!

Didn't have the cilantro.  This recipe was okay...I think I also had the problem of the flavor of the tomatoes, but otherwise was satisfied.

I just seasoned to salmon to my liking and prepared the rest as per the recipe. It's the mango salsa that makes this dish and combining it with salmon results in a unique but fabulous flavour. It is just as good re-heated the next day. Even my picky partner loved it and he doesn't usually like to combine his food groups!

This was delicious, it is an awesome summertime meal. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was a hit with the entire family. We eat salmon 2X per week and are always looking for new recipes. This is keeper in our household!

This was yummy and oh so easy.  Next time though I will cut down the amount of onion.  I actually used it on the Firecracker Salmon.  Made a very nice meal.

Tasty  and simple recipe, but don't use canned mangoes. We had a left over can in the pantry, and it was a bad choice-- although it still tasted ok, I imagine it must be much better with the fresh fruit.

This recipe was good.  Great in itself.  I'm a bit used to salmon that has a bit more flavour.  We usually brush ours with a paste made out of 1/2 brown sugar and a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce.   I think that if you brushed that sauce on this salmon and served it with this salsa it would be even better!  But it's good on it's own.  Hubby rated it 5 stars...I was the 4 star.

I have never made salmon before so I was a little apprehensive but it turned out great!  I made it for New Year's Day and my husband raved over the salsa.  It was so easy and didn't take long.

I decided to cook for a friend a few months back after she was returning from a long trip so she could relax and not have to worry about food prep upon her return.  I went to Harris Teeter and salmon steaks as well as mangos were on sale.  I found this recipe and thought, "Why not?"  As a quick side, I prepped some boxed Spanish rice and had some fresh avocado.   The meal was easy to prep and cook.  It turned out to be a great extemporaneous meal!  I would recommend this recipe anytime!  Check out the picture in the pics section!  -Marty

This recipe was alright, nothing special.  I liked the sweetness of the mangos but it was kind of plain and didn't have enough of a kick.

Beautiful and delicious!  I am not a fan of fish, but this was yummy!  I even forgot to sauté the veggies.  I just cut everything up into small I/4" cubes and served it fresh.  It was perfect.  I did salt and pepper the fish before baking and added some chopped jalapeño slices into the salsa.  I look forward to having this again!

I tried this mango salsa recipe with some swordfish steaks I threw on the grill (just coat with olive oil, cook for about 5 minutes each side for 1-inch thick steaks).  Fabulous!  The meal was a big hit with me and my guests.  It was easy to make, but looked beautiful and impressive on the plate.

I will be using this recipe all summer!

We loved the Mango Salsa but would add just a little more cilantro to the recipe.  We paired it with the Oven Fries recipe and they were wonderful together.

I would give this recipe 5 starts, except that I used the salsa recipe with bone-in pork chops instead of salmon.  I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and cumin, then broiled 2" from heat for 6 minutes per side.
For the salsa I used a vidalia onion instead of red onion and added 1 seeded and chopped jalepeno pepper.  Otherwise I followed the directions as written.  This was delicious!  We enjoyed our chops with some sauteed spinach with onion and garlic.  We ate up the rest of the salsa with some organic blue corn chips.  This is a keeper!

This is a simple, delicious, and healthy meal.  I felt the recipe was a touch bland and needed a punch, a bit of heat.  So next time, I will add some diced jalapenos to give it more of that "salsa" taste.

I gave it four stars because I love the idea, but found the recipe too time-consuming to follow.  I started gathering ingredients and thought-- gee, this sounds like mild Ro-tel.  So I aborted the mission and settled for Rotel and mango in the blender instead, then followed the rest of the recipe.  Really delicious, especially after you have let the salsa sit for a day.  Serve mangoed salmon on steamed spinach.

Excellent stuff!!! made it a bit more chinese by baking the salmon with sesame oil and teriyaki sauce. Added some teriyaki sauce into the salsa as well. Instead of lime juice, you can use worchester sauce. Also, to make it a bit more saucy, add Marks and Spencer's fresh mango and orange juice. A winner!

I made it as listed and it was great, next time I think a bit of heat to go with the sweet. Maybe a bit of habanero with the onions/garlic?

This recipe was so scrumptious !  My husband loved it, my 8 eight year loved it, and I was so impressed!  The cilantro with the mango dressing was divine.  I did change one thing to the recipe, I put a few pads of butter and a little brown sugar on the salmon before broiling.  The tenderness of the salmon was unbelievable.  I will be saving this one!

This tasted great, although in the end, I did not follow much of the recipe, as I didn't have it with me. We added an avocado and the juice of the lemon to the salsa, omitted the garlic and olive oil, and kept it cold. On the salmon, I added some ground chili flakes, salt and pepper.

These were good and a nice change from the usual.  I normally prefer a nice sauce with my salmon though.  Or at least some kind of marinade before cooking it.

I can actually get my parents to eat healthily with this recipe!  They love it, and they don't even notice it's good for them.

My husband absolutely LOVED it.  Next time I will put some salt on the salmon before I broil. This was an easy recipe that tastes great!

Nice and light dish!  Also great for a weeknight dinner because it is quick and easy.
