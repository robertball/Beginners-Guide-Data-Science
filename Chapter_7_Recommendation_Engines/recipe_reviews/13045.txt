For years, I wished that I could duplicate the broccoli and cheese at Chili's, where I worked in college. But since it wasn't made at the restaurant, I couldn't.  Now, THIS recipe is as good, if not better than Chili's and every other restaurant B & C I've tried.  On the advice of others, I doubled the cheese and the broccoli, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and I cut the cheese into small cubes for quick melting.  It was incredible, and I will absolutely be making this soup often.  For family or for guests, watch out--this will knock your socks off!  Word of caution: after cheese has melted, turn stove heat down to low or the cheese will stick to the bottom of pot.

With some "alterations" this soup is awesome and deserves a very high rating!

I used 6 Tablespoons of Butter (1/2 cup is just too much)... I added 2-3 cloves minced garlic to the onion… once the onion was tender/translucent I sauteed several chicken bouillon cubes and then added 2+ pounds of fresh broccoli to the onion/bouillon mixture and added 6-7 cups of water.  I used heavy cream instead of milk.  I still used the garlic powder to taste and added freshly ground black pepper too.  I only used ½ cup of cornstarch and blended it with the soup broth instead of water.  Lastly I used medium cheddar cheese and added it at the very end.    

If you’re unsure about deviating from the recipe, at least use fresh broccoli and cream or half/half and make sure to add the cheese at the end!  It will make a delicious difference!

Mmmm, mmmm GOOD!!! I read all the reviews before making it and did a few "tweaks" to the recipe and I am blissfully happy with the results. Keeper recipe!

Here are the "tweaks" that I made:

I covered the broccoli with THREE cans of chicken broth instead of four. 

I used TWO bags (14 oz) of broccoli florets 

I used TWO lbs of Velveeta (actually I used the generic grocery brand, it was cheaper) 

Instead of mixing cornstarch with water, I mixed it with the FOURTH can of chicken broth.

I like this soup.  I have made it twice.  The last time I made it I did not add the corn starch at the end but instead I pureed the hot soup right in the pot with my hand mixer/immersion blender (love this for soups).  I left more of the broccoli stalk pieces in and this thickened the soup more healthfully.  I also added two vine ripened tomatos I had roasted/mesquite smoked on the grill (Before pureeing).  Also don't be afraid to use real cheddar in place of part of the cheese food.  Much better for you!

I disagree with the 'Tweakers' make this just as it is, it's wonderful! Just imo, changing every ingredient of a recipe isn't a tweak, its a new recipe, just put that one up if you like it!

This is a great recipe!  My 4 year old liked it even after she found out it had broccoli!
I decided to cut the recipe in half and to make it in the crock pot.  Here's how I altered the recipe - I used 2 lbs velveeta, 1/4 onion, 1/4 cup green pepper, 1/4 cup butter, 8 oz frozen brocolli, 1 can chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk and 1 tsp. minced Garlic.  I didn't need the cornstarch or extra water since I used the crock pot.  
I cubed the velveeta and put it in the crock pot on low.  I sauted the onions, green pepper, and garlic in butter, then added the brcocolli and covered in the chicken broth and milk.  After boiling off some of the liquid in the pan, I added this to the crock pot.  I stirred it together, and let it cook for about 3 to 4 hours on low, stirring at least once an hour.
It was delicious and my whole family loved it. They are already asking me to make it again.
Remember, if you use the cornstarch to thicken the soup, mix it with the cold milk first then you have to bring it to a boil with the rest of the soup.

I have been making broccoli cheese soup for years but this version is MUCH easier!! I took the submitter's advice and added 1/3 cup of white wine while sauting the onions and used flour instead of cornstarch.  I also used more broccoli than called for and next time I may added some shredded carrots for color but overall, this was excellent!! And this version will replace my old one! Thanks Karin!!

I kind of combined this and tons of reviews from this and Broc Soup III for my soup.  I only used 3 tbls butter to saute the onion (about 1 1/2 C pre-diced-will actually use more next time).  I used a bag of frozen and a fresh crown of chopped broccoli.  I put all 4 cans of chicken broth in w/the brocolli.  I used a pound of 2% Velveeta and a handful of 2% shredded jack cheese.  I added a little less than a tbsp garlic powder (and next time I will skip this and saute fresh minced garlic in w/my onions), just under a tbsp worchestershire sauce and a dash of dry mustard.  Before I added the cheeses, I strained about 1/2 the brocolli mix and pureed before returning to the pot-next time I will puree almost the entire mix (I like more creamy than chunky).  I thickened w/BC 4 cheese instant mashed potatoes. Oh, and I used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular (though after adding I noticed the expiration date was 09/06....I don't reccomend that!).  Served a/a diced tomato garnish and crusty bread.  Thanks for a great recipe (and lots of great modifications along the way from reviewers!).

Wonderful soup. But should mention to really cut up the cheese into really SMALL cubes or premelt the cheese in a separate bowl before adding to the pot. I didn't cut the cheese up too well and when I added it in the pot, the cheese stuck to the broccoli. Not a good combination - especially since I was cooking for the in-laws, and when they ate it, they asked if I had put some ground beef in it. >_

It's still snowing here in Utah so soup was on the menu tonight.  This was great.  I read the reviews about some having a hard time thickening the soup.  The thing is, there's already butter in the recipe, so why not make a roux by adding flour?  I tried it and it was fabulous.  This is a much better way to thicken a cream soup than by using cornstarch.  You just add 1/2 cup of flour (or equal amount to the butter if you're doubling) to your pan after sauteeing onions and butter.  Stir and cook for a few minutes to get rid of the flour taste, then whisk chicken stock in little by litte so you don't get clumps.  Once all of the stock is in, add broccoli and proceed as recipe instructs.  No need for cornstarch if you do it this way.  I also added an extra pkg (16 oz) of broccoli.  I like small bits as well as larger bits in my soup, so one package I pureed in my food processor and added it at the end.

I'm always intimidated by new recipes but you will not be disappointed!  Like the rest of you, I read the reviews before making it.  I only used 3 Tbsp. of butter-1 whole stick would be WAY too much for sauteeing 1 onion.  Instead of using garlic powder, I minced 2 cloves of garlic and shredded 1 carrot and cooked together with onion.  I used 1.5 lbs of fresh broccoli crowns, mostly the florets.  Actually, I used 1 (32 oz) carton of stock, and 2 (14 oz) cans for a total of 60 oz.  This was good because I used more broccoli.  Like the others, I used most of the broth to cook the broccoli and mixed the corn starch with the last can.  When the broccoli was done, I pureed 1/2 of the broccoli in my blender and returned it to the pot.  As soon as I added the cornstarch mixture, it thickened right up.  I also used light cream (8oz) instead of the 2 cups of milk.  I probably didn't need it because it thickened it even further, which i don't mind but I may try 1 cup of milk next time to thin it just a tad.  For the one that said it was too thin, not sure what she did wrong because it was thick!!  Last but not least, I used the REAL cheese!  2- 8 oz bags of shredded cheddar and 1/2 of another bag I already had opened and added it at the end with the heat turned off.  If you don't like big pieces of broccoli, I would puree the whole mixture but I love the florets I can see!!  I never write a review but I was really impressed by this recipe!

The soup turned out really thin for me. Next time I'll add more cheese and cornstarch.  It tasted more like the chicken broth than the cheese.

My wife loves the broccoli cheese soup at Chili's and this recipe is wonderful.  Followed the advice of other reviews (more broccoli and cheese and no water).  Also the broccoli florets were too big so i chopped them up after thawing in a food processor.  Next time i think i will try the crock-pot method and fresh broccoli and maybe 1lb cheddar and 1lb cheese food. 

Highly recommended if you want to duplicate/improve upon chili's or any restaurants broccoli cheese soup!

I love broccoli and I love soup. Cream of Broccoli .... Is just one of my favorites!

I found a very good recipe and after moving I could not find it .... so, based on all the reviews .... I tried this one.

I made some changes ... in the end this is AWESOME!

I doubled the broccoli, added two minced garlic cloves, 1/2 tablespoon of fresh ground pepper, and substituted 1 lb processed cheese for 1/2 lb low fat cheddar and 1/2 extra sharp chedder; and cut the cornstarch down to 1/3rd cup. Finally, I subsituted 1/2 the milk for heavy cream.

If you love broccoli and cream soup ... this is definately a keeper!

Ok, the first time I made this I was not impressed, but the second time was a winner.  Here's what I did different...  I halved the recipe except for the cheese and broccoli.  This was the perfect amount for my family.  They eat every bit with just enough left over for me to have with a sandwich tomorrow!

Excellent! Used half the cheese, added canned diced potatoes, forgot the milk but still so good. Added 1/2 & 1/2 when reheating the next night & a pinch of red pepper flakes. Grown son stopped by. He hates broccoli but used a spatula to get every last bit of this soup!

I've made this a few times now. I followed other reviewer's advice and I doubled the cheese and broccoli. This is my boyfriend's favorite soup now! When I first made this soup I couldn't find a block of "process cheese food" so I ended up buying some sliced american cheese and pealing all those slices for the soup. Get the block of cheese, it was a lot of work to unwrap all those!

I think this recipie is awesome, but following other reviewers advice would make it a 5 star recipie.  I doubled the broccoli and cheese, and because I like a very thick soup, I eliminated the water and mixed the cornstarch in chicken  broth (adding the last 4th cup last).  My parents used to run a deli/catering service, and they said they would have made this soup the daily special all the time.  They are really proud and hardly ever deem anything catering quality, so I was very flattered!

Third times a charm. First two times I made this were good and each time I tweaked it based on reviews but NOW I got it! 

1.I used fresh broccoli and used about 1.5lbs. I used about 20oz of velvetta instead of 16.
2.Added some salt and pepper and would have used some fresh garlic had I had it.
3. Reserved some of the chicken broth for the cornstarch slurry. 
4. I used half and half for extra richness.
5. At the end I stirred in about 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar. 

REALLY good and on the thick side which I personally like. It reheats well and I freeze some in baggies for quick lunches. It makes A LOT! And I have a family of 5! I think there is nothing wrong with this recipe it is just personal tastes that make people unhappy with it. Technically this is written correctly in the order of steps and ingredients. I just like mine a little cheesier. I used frozen broccoli the first time and that was fine to so if you don't have fresh don't stress about it.

Excellent soup. I also added 2-3 cloves of minced garlic in with the sauteed onion.  I used 2 big heads of fresh broccoli.  I also put in 1 cup of carrots, julienned in the broth with the broccoli.  I used 1 pound of extra old cheddar cheese and I grated it in at the end and it melted in just seconds.  I didn't put in the garlic powder as I had already added the minced garlic in the beginning.   Like others suggest I too used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk....very creamy!  This is now a family favourite!

This soup looked and tasted good before I added the cornstarch.  The cornstarch made it way too thick and ruined it for me.  I will use very little to no cornstarch if I make this again.

My kids loved this soup; however, I changed it just a little.  I added 1 cup of milk  and 1 cup of cream, used 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 real cheddar cheese, and topped with shredded colby jack when served in a bowl.  Absolutely delicious!

This soup couldn't be easier or tastier.  It does make a lot though.  I made the mistake of making a whole batch.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would change is to decrease the garlic powder by about half.  I felt it was a little strong.  Recipe does reheat very well.

This soup was delicious!! I added 1-1/2 pounds of processed cheese... we looooovveee a cheesy soup! The only other thing I would change next time is reducing the onion to 1/2. My husband hates onions, and adding a whole onion was a bit too much for him. Awell, just means more leftovers for me! Bring it on!

With the amount of changes necessary to make this soup I really don't think it deserved 5 stars because if made the way the recipe reads it would probably be way too thin.  I read the reviews beforehand and made the following changes- 1) more broccoli!  I used two frozen packages instead of one 2) three cans of chicken broth instead of four and fresh garlic instead of the powder.  I would suggest pepper as well, it was a bit bland.  But overall it was good and easy hence the four stars.

I made several changes to this recipe based on the reviews I read by others.  Here is my list...2 packages of broccoli instead of 1.  3 cans of broth instead of 4.  I used heavy cream in place of milk.  Added 1/2 pound of sharp cheddar cheese to the pound of velveeta.  Also a teaspoon of pepper.  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  Flavorful and creamy.  I'm thinking next time I will add another package of broccoli.  This is a great recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic when modified using raters suggestions!  The soup was just as good as TGI Friday's soup which is my favorite.  I gave it four stars only because I did not use the recipe as is (so many people had great suggestions).  I cut the recipe in half (only one of me), used fresh broccoli, fresh garlic, and substituted half and half for the milk.  I doubled the cheese and almost doubled the broccoli but did not have enough for double.  I had some extra chicken broth that I needed to use up so I used that instead of water with the corn starch.  Something to keep in mind.  It seems like a lot of broccoli when you cut it up but the broccoli got smaller while it cooked.

This is a great soup.  I halved the recipe, but kept the broccoli and cheese the same, other than that followed it to the letter. Thickened up absolutely beautifully.  I did find it a little bland, but salt and pepper did the trick.  While I was enjoying this it kept popping in my mind that it was missing something and then it dawned on me.  NUTMEG!  I added 1/8 tsp. to the soup pan (NOT the bowl) and it was absolutely perfection.  This really kicks it up to being fabulous.  BTW, Panera Bread adds nutmeg to theirs, that's why it is so good.

Very nice flavor. Due to WW diet I only added half the cheese amount and served with a bit of gated cheddar on top. I ran it through my food proccessor since we prefer it without the big chunks. I also added a bag of the mixed cabbage slaw, only because it needed to be used up. Mine was not very thick but I did't want to add more points for starch so left as it was. GOOD! Only 4 points on WW. Will be making again. Thanks!  Made it once with canned nacho cheese. It was great! Processed is processed lol

This is, without a doubt, a keeper! Nothing better on a cold night, than a bowl of yummy soup like this one. I made some changes, as others suggested, (doubled the broccoli and cheese portions, substituted half and half for the milk and replaced the water with chicken broth) and was SO pleased with the results. This recipe tasted better than many restaurant versions that I've tried. 5 stars and thank you so much for sharing it!

My husband, a chef, walked into the kitchen when I was almost finished making this soup.  We enjoyed it, but he had a few comments that I will share.  Add the milk BEFORE the Velveeta; this will help the Velveeta not to curdle because it needs fat to bind to in order to make a smooth sauce.  The cheese should ALWAYS be added LAST & don't boil after the cheese is added!  Reduce the liquid (2-3 cans of broth) and use cream in place of half or all of the milk!  We also like more broccoli (3 lbs. fresh) and 1.5 lbs. of Velveeta.  Would be great with cheese-flavored french fried onions on top!!! FANTASTIC recipe!!!

This recipe calls for way too much garlic. The garlic takes away from the broccoli and cheese flavor. I love garlic and will continue to use it in Italian dishes, but not in broccoli cheese soup.

This was delicious!  I used 2/3 cup flour instead of cornstarch to thicken.  I added it to the butter and sauteed onions after the onions had cooked long enough to become translucent.  I also added potatoes for thickening and spiced it up with a little garlic.  I used 8oz shredded cheddar/ monterey jack instead of processed cheese.  It was delicious!

OMG- this was the best soup I've eaten in a very long time, and I love me some soup!. Had friends in from out of town- made a big pot and it's all gone. They said it tasted better than Panera's. Made a few changes after reading reviews... (I usually make new recipes exact, but....) doubled the velveeta, used fresh broccoli (about 1 3/4 lbs., and used a 1/4 cup flour with  1 1/2 cups more chicken broth- 2/3 cup cornstarch sounded like too much...... just the right consistency. Very glad I read the reviews first. Oh, I forgot- threw in a couple of handfuls of Monterey Jack cuz I had it in the fridge. This soup will be come a staple in my house this winter.

Delicious flavor, but too thin.  I ended up adding another 1lb bag of broccoli and 8 oz of cream cheese.  Sprinkled crumbled fried onions from the can on top.

Wow! This was wonderful! I used 1 bag frozen broccoli minus stalks and 2 bunches fresh crowns with about 10 fowers and cut large ones in 4's.It gave it a wonderful texture and it holds up nice. Used 1/2 sweet onion chopped fine(picky eaters) but feel it adds to flavor. Used 1 pint half n half and only 3/4 cup water to cornstarch. For those who like the cheddar flavor, add it to the top of each bowl before serving this way it doesn't curdle. Thanks Karin for this most excellent soup!!!

Very good soup! I found it very nessesary though to replace processed cheese w/ REAL cheese. I also used fresh broccoli and fresh garlic. I added white rice for thickness and fresh basil. Great soup, just use real and fresh ingredients.

Great recipe for a base start. Used about 24oz of fresh broccoli, used four cloves fresh garlic, one pound of velveeta, no water, subed milk for heavy cream. I will for sure next time use real cheddar. I don't what possessed me not to sub that out. That--I will rectify next time along with more broccoli, and will add carrots. Enjoy with crusty bread!

DELICIOUS!!  I took some of the advice from other posters and tweaked the recipe.  I also used a little bit of flour and chicken stock to thicken it and then my secret (for more thickening w/o using all that flour)...slowly stirred in instant mashed potatoe flakes....PERFECT!!!

This recipe is TO DIE FOR! This is the third time I've made it and let me tell you, it is delicious! After reading a couple other reviews, I did tweak the recipe a little. 
1.) I used 6 tablespoons butter, instead of 1/2 cup (a little less calories couldn't hurt)
2.) I used 1/2 an onion instead of 1 full onion. To much onion takes away from the broccoli. 
3.) I 2x the broccoli and the Velveeta
4.) Like the user before me, I cut out the water, waited to use the last cup of broth until the end, and added 1 cup of cornstarch to that, then proceeded to mix that with everything else. 

Those are the only things I changed. This is BY FAR the best soup EVER! My compliments to the original chef!

BEST EVER!!! I tried this and my family LOVES this!!! A tip for tis is DO NOT stray from Velveta cheese...makes all the differance in the world!!! I had to add more of the corn starch mixture though because I like mine a little thicker and I used fresh steamed broccoli not frozen...definitly a keeper!!

OK...I read a lot of reviews and did a lot of changing...but it is definitely the BEST broccoli cheese soup i've ever made. It really tastes like Panera Bread's!
Here goes:
In stockpot, melt 3 Tbsp. butter over medium heat. Cook 1 onion and 1 Tbsp. minced garlic in butter until softened. Add 7 ckn bouillon cubes and sautee with onion and garlic. Add 1 pound of frozen broccoli, 6 cups of water, and 1 cup shredded carrots. Boil for 10-15 minutes. 
Melt 1 pound velveeta (chopped up) in microwave. Reduce heat and stir cheese in until melted. Mix in 1 can evaporated milk and 2 tsp. garlic powder. Sprinkle some black pepper. 
In small bowl, stir 2/3 cup flour into 1 cup water until smooth. Stir into soup. Cook until thick.

As is, this recipe has pretty good flavor.  I give it 4 stars because the processed cheese is really bad for you.  I tried this recipe again the next day with the following mods and LOVED IT!  fresh broccoli, fresh garlic, 1 box of organic chicken broth (no MSG), shredded cheddar cheese, and flour (instead of cornstarch) with milk  (instead of water)

Great soup!! I changed it up a bit by doubling the broccoli (also used frozen florets, which broke down in the broth when they cooked), omitted garlic powder and added 1 heaping tsp minced garlic and 1/4 c. white wine to the butter while onion cooked. I also, added 8 oz. sharp cheddar cheese in addition to the loaf of processed cheese. Saved 1 c. of chicken broth and used that with the cornstarch to thicken. So easy, and turned out GREAT!! My picky 3 year old devoured it!

The milk curdled.  As soon as I added the milk it curdled on me.  So I did some research and found out that milk will curdle when added to something hot.  Not sure why no one else had this problem.  I followed the recipe to the T.  The whole soup was ruined.

Ahhhhh!!!!  Just the perfect soup for winter time!  Yum!  I did everything just as the recipe said except for I used three cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder (we love garlic) and I added mild sharp cheese in addition to the velveeta cheese.  Very good!  I think next time I will try it with half and half or even heavy whipping cream.

This soup was very good and easy to prepare.  My husband quickly gave it 5 stars.  I also would like it a bit thicker next time.  I used fresh broccoli and it was wonderful.  Thanks Karin for the recipe.

This has got to be the best broccoli and cheese soup I have ever tasted!!!!  I have already fixed it twice and have given some away.  My In-Laws say that it taste better than the soup from one of our favorite restaurants!!!!  I will definitely fix this again and again.

Delicious!! This will be my go to recipe for broccoli soup. I half the recipe since there is only two people eating the soup. Also I used two pints of my homecanned chicken broth instead of the canned broth and upped the cornstarch to a half of a cup. It was perfect.

I usually don't take the time to review recipes, but this was amazing!  Made it exactly as written but garnished with freshly grated cheddar cheese.  Seriously restaurant quality (or better).  I've been craving this soup every night since I last made it.  Upon first taste I turned to my husband and asked if he liked it.  He laughed and said, "Clearly you do!  Your eyes got huge with the first bite." Haha

I followed the instructions of the first and second top rated reviews - doubled broccoli, doubled cheese, didn't use water, used 3 of the 4 cans of broth to soften the broccoli and then added the corn starch to the 4th can.  I also added shredded carrots that I'd cut down smaller to the onions while cooking.  The consistency was good, the amount of broccoli was good but the cheese taste was off.  I am used to broccoli cheese tasting like cheddar, not velveeta so next time I will make it with real cheddar cheese.

Absolutely the best Broccoli soup!!  I did make some changes according to other reviews.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, doubled the broccoli, and used 2 bags of sharp cheddar, and 2 bags of mild cheddar/colby jack mix instead of processed cheese food (8 oz bags).  I also added a little salt and pepper.  It was excellent!  I would like to mention that it is best to read the a lot of the other reviews 1st before making any recipe.  There are some great add ons and ideas listed!

Quite average I must say. It lacks some vegetables in my mind. Like carrots and celery. But that's mostly a matter of taste. It was easy to make, quite fast too. I'll keep this as a base to fill with peoples own tastes. Thank you.

This was my first try at this type of soup.  It turned out fairly good.  I used less butter and fresh brocoli. Seemed like it was missing a little something.  Will add black pepper and carrots. next time.

A really simple soup. Per some of the reviews I sauted four cloves of garlic in the butter with the onions in place of garlic powder. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, real cheddar instead of "cheese food" and I used half and half in place of milk. I also added Worcester sauce.  I also added generous amounts of salt and pepper. This soup was really yummy but very rich, it kept me full for hours. Next time I think I am going to add sliced mushrooms and white wine.   I saw some reviews thougth the soup turned out too thin. My soup was too thick if anything, they must not have used the proper amount of cornstarch.

I wish I had followed the directions... I doubled the cheese as many suggested, and it was really salty and had a strong processed cheese flavor.  I'm glad I doubled the broccoli, but next time I will use only 1lb. of the cheese.

Excellent soup! Made it for dinner last night and my husband and I both loved it. I took the advice of some reviewers and added an extra cup of cheese, (I used sharp cheddar in addition to the Velveeta). I also used a very large bunch of fresh broccoli, florets and stalks, all chopped up. When the soup was done, I pureed it in batches in my food processor. Just a matter of personal preference; if you like it smooth then you should puree it. However, if you prefer it a bit chunky, then leave it as is. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe with the rest of us!

I modified this based on reading everyone's suggestions and came up with a PERFECT soup:
Use 2 pkg frozen broccoli florets,
2 diced carrots  and 1 tsp garlic clove(saute with the onion and butter)
48oz box of low sodium chicken broth plus one 14 oz can,I have a hand blender that I used for pureeing the mixture, it gave the soup a great consistency!
1 lb velveeta and 1 lb low fat velveeta;
melt with 1 Cup skim milk in microwave, then add to the broccoli mixture.
I used 1 tsp or so corn starch mixed in 1/4 C cold water, then added to the soup mixture to thicken. sprinkle with fresh cracked pepper. Do NOT add any salt.
Serve with crusty rolls.
Very satisfying and filling, superior flavor!!

I've made this soup several times and it's a hit, with a few alterations: I added cauliflower and celery and would have added carrots had I not been out of them as I prefer a vegetable cream soup rather than broc. alone. As someone who has to watch the intake of salt, I substituted the processed cheese for the real thing-that stuff has more than twice the sodium of real cheddar. This time I had shredded co-jack on hand and it tastes just fine. I also like a richer tasting soup without all the fat so I substituted 1 1/2 cups of the milk with non-fat evaporated milk. I also reduced fat by sauteeing the onions and celery in 2 tbsp. olive oil. Good stuff!

Oh my! I have been a member of Allrecipes since the beginning but have never left a review...this soup is still on the stove while my bread is warming and I simply cannot stop 'sampling' it! DELICIOUS! I too increased the broccoli and velveeta by a half, and also decreased the amount of cornstarch and mixed it with broth, otherwise no tinkering!
Thanks Karin for sharing.

OK. I used 1 cup milk, 1 cup cream, 1 lb. Velveeta and 1/2 cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese. Served with croutons. However, I am NOT a fan of Velveeta cheese so it could have been that taste.

Oh WOW! I have been looking for a recipe that was similar to the one that a resturant I worked for made. This is it.. I love it. The only thing I would do for next time is add another bag of broccoli and omit the garlic. Other than that it was fantastic. Its great when the weather is starting to get cold outside. It is also very quick and simple! Terrific

Like other reviewers, I had issues with the thinness of the soup.  I quadrupled the recipe for a large church function, used only a little more than half of the called-for broth, half of the milk, and added another 50% of cheese.  I also used fresh broccoli.  Everyone asked for the recipe, but due to the significant changes that needed to be made, as well as the soup still being a little on the thin side, I'm only giving it four stars.

This is the perfect broccoli cheese soup recipe!  I too used half and half instead of milk, added 2 garlic cloves, pepper, and added carrots with the broccoli to equal 2#.  I used 1# of processed cheese and about 1/2# of bacon flavored cheddar slices.  Delicious!

A very tasty soup.  My only issue w/ it would be the thickness, but I'm not sure I could thicken it much w/ out making the calorie count go up a lot.
Adjustments per suggestions: 6T butter, most of 1 28oz bag broccoli, 1.5lbs fresh cheddar cheese none of that processed loaf .  Additionally used the mushrooms & wine w/ the onions along w/ 4 cloves garlic.
Pureed w/ the immersion blender prior to adding the broccoli.

This is the greatest indulgence. It's sooo bad for you, but wow it's insanely good. I doubled the broccoli, added fresh garlic and one cup real cheddar/monterey jack shredded cheese, cut out the 1 cup of water, and used a cup of the broth to mix the cornstarch.  Lastly, I added paprika to taste.  MY family just loved this.. & I mean they reallllly LOVED this. In fact my son's friends ask me to make it when they come over!! It's now a tradition in my house.

I LOVE this soup! I have made this soup several times now. I have made it as written and it's wonderful! I have also lightened it up to make it healthier since I was dieting and it was still awesome! To lighten, I used half light butter (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter is my fave) and the other half 
EVOO to sautée the onions. I used half extra sharp cheddar and half velveeta for the cheese called for. I've used garlic powder, and fresh garlic....both work great. Finally, I used skim milk rather than whole. So, that being said, even after making these minor changes and lightening it up a bit, it was JUST as yummy and satisfying with less guilt while dieting (although I think I eat more of it when I think there are fewer calories...defeating the purpose of lightening the recipe to begin with maybe? lol) I 
highly recommend this recipe, lightened or not! 
Super easy and my whole family loves it.

This was really good, my first attempt at any kind of homemade soup and it was great!! I tweaked it a little based on what i had in my kitchen, I used 4 cans sodium free chicken broth, mixed one with the corn starch... I used 2 lbs of broccoli,  and nearly two lbs of cheese, I used 15 oz cheddar,5 oz monteray jack, and 4 oz peppar jack, I also added a tablespoon of celery powder, and after I pureed it.... so my kids wouldn't know it's broccoli...:) I added 1/4 cup of flour to help thicken.... Turned out perfect!!!

Very good.  I followed advice of others and made these alterations: mixed cornstarch with more chicken broth instead of water, melted in regular cheddar cheese at the end, used half and half instead of milk.

This was great, with a few changes. I used 2 bags of 14oz broccoli florets, and 1lb of Velveeta as well as 1lb of medium cheddar cheese, freshly grated. I added enough chicken broth to cover the broccoli once in the pot(about 4 cups)... I also out about a tablespoon of minced garlic with the onion and butter... I also added the corn starch to another cup of chicken brother...  I guess all told I used about 6 cups of broth plus the 2 cups of milk... You don't need half and half if you use the corn starch and cook it to the consistency you want it. I actually you no fat milk...I also used a hand potato masher to mash up the broccoli a bit once it was cooked.....

I halved the recipe but used the whole onion and the whole 12 oz bag of frozen broccoli, and I liked those changes. I also fried real garlic with the onions rather than the garlic powder and liked that too. In fact this was well-received, but not loved, because we prefer a Cheddar-y flavor in our broccoli & cheese soups. This was certainly easy & quick enough to whip up anytime with ingredients many people have on hand; thank you for sharing!

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!  I followed other reviewers suggestions to add one more bag of broccoli and 2lbs of cheese instead of one. I cubed mine small and had no problems melting. You just need to be patient for this part:) I also omitted the water and just saved 1/2 can chicken broth to use with the corn starch. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  This was the most creamy and richest broccoli cheese soup I've ever had! Very smooth--even with the broccoli pieces. Probably because of the extra cheese.   Highly recommend!

I gave this 3 stars because it was runny but the flavor was great would've been 4 stars worthy if it had be thicker.  The few changes I made: I added fresh garlic to the onion instead of the garlic powder. I mixed the corn starch with the 4th can of chicken broth and omitted the 1 cup of water. I then used a hand blender to break up all the large chunks of broccoli.  Next time I make this I'll cut at least 1 can chicken broth out and double the broccoli.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fabulous! I have been looking for a Broccoli Cheese Soup recipe that tasted like the soup from Panera. This was SO close it's scary! I too made a few changes to the recipe. First I added fresh broccoli and shredded carrots. I also added about 1lb of velveeta and 8oz of shredded cheddar. And lastly I used 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of water to the corn starch. I can't wait to make this again, it was delicious!

Very good. Fresh broccoli is much better. I always use shredded cheese that you buy in bags, melts evenly every time.

Has good flavor. I used 1 1/2 packages of the cheese as well as fresh broccoli and garlic. I left my pieces of broccoli fairly big and I used an immersion blender to chop it after it was cooked and I chopped it too much so I didn't have the chunks of broccoli that I would have liked. Next time I will only blend about 1/2 the broccoli and then have some smaller cut pieces to keep some chinks in the soup.

First - I reduced the amounts of ingredients because I only had one can of chicken stock.  I have made a lot of Broccoli soup recipes from this site and this is by far the BEST!!  I used left over Broccoli from last nights dinner (and baby carrots too) and that made the cooking time shorter which was OK with me because I was hungry!!  I followed the directions exactly by adding the ingredients as they are written.  I'm very happy with the results - Absolutely DELICIOUS!!  I  can stop looking for the PERFECT Broccoli soup recipe because I've found it!!  Thank you Karin for sharing your WONDERFUL soup!!

After having Broccoli cheese soup at Mimi's a few times...I knew I had to find a recipe and make it at home! This recipe is wonderful! I read some of the reviews and followed some of the advice.... I used 2 pounds of Velveeta cheese loaf and used cooked fresh broccoli rather than frozen. I noticed after adding the cornstarch the soup was a bit lumpy and the cornstarch wasn't mixing in very well. I used a hand wand-type blender... worked very well! I will definitely make this recipe again! YUM!!!

Excellent, and even better a couple of days later! I pureed the whole lot with my immersion hand-held blender. Also doubled the cheese and it still wasn't overly cheesy. Hubby would have liked more cheese and less puree, but that didn't stop him from cleaning out his bowl! Served it with herb garlic bread from my breadmaker.

I save 5 star ratings for recipes that truly deserve it & this was one of those recipes. At the recommendation of other reviewers I used fresh broccoli (2 large heads & then a bag of frozen broccoli because it still didn't seem like enough), doubled cheese, added garlic, left out the cup of water & added the cornstarch with the milk. This was salty enough on it's own so I wouldn't recommend adding any salt.

This recipe is both superior in flavor and gets an A+ for ease of preparation!  Be careful not to add too much chicken broth or you'll be over the edge on saltiness.  We added more florets, like the reviewer before us.  Threw in cauliflower and carrots, too!  DELICIOUS!  Thank you!!  A real KEEPER!

I love this recipe.  I've made it lots of times and here is what works best (for me).  I sautee a cup of shredded carrots with the onion.  I cut broth down to 5 cups (I usually make my broth from bullion cubes), use the 2 cups of milk as directed (whole milk) and at the end, I mix the cornstarch with 1/2 cup of water (instead of a whole cup).  The rest of the recipe I follow except subbing fresh garlic for the powder.  This soup is better than a restaurant version!

I had made this soup the first time following the recipe exactly. It wasn't thick enough and did not have enough broccoli in it. I made it again today with a few changes. I started out cutting the recipe in half. Then, I added about a cup more of broccoli. Instead of using water to mix with the cornstarch, I just used some of the chicken broth from one of the cans. It turned out awesome! My husband and I both agree it is hard to tell this soup apart from the kind at the restaurant.

Delicious soup!  We made this with fresh broccoli, some shredded carrot, half and half, and cut back on the garlic- personal preference.  We thought it was the best we have had anywhere!  I look forward to trying this with other ingredients- ham or chicken, potatoes, etc!  THANKS!!

This was excellent, better than Panera's. I did make some modifications already listed regarding cutting the water, milk, cornstarch down and more broccoli and a lot of cheese. Truly good, I have a Type I diabetic rugrat and he loves this - good for him, not a lot of carbs.

This was very tasty and everyone at my dinner party loved it!  I did make the following small adjustments:  1)I doubled the broccoli, 2)used extra-sharp cheddar and some american cheese instead of the processed cheese, 3)replaced milk with heavy cream, 4)used real minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and 5)added 1/2 tsp. white pepper.  I'll be making this soup again really soon!!!

So delicious as is and requires no modification. I just used fresh instead of the frozen broccoli, and replaced 1 cup of milk with cream.

Reading some of the reviews before cooking this soup,I, like some others, tailored this recipe.  I used at least 20 oz. of frozen tender baby broccoli, used  only 32 oz. chicken broth, used 2 lbs. Velveeta Light cheese, omitted garlic powder, replaced cornstarch with flour, added 2-3 c. cubed cooked potatoes, at 1/2-1 c. diced cooked carrots, and ample amount of pepper. Cooking it with these ingredients, it was creamy and so delicious we wanted to lick the bowls!

Very tasty recipe!  I made just a HALF batch (due to supplies on hand) with a few adjustments: 2T Smart Balance to saute onions, 1 large head of fresh broccoli, 1 can of broth +1 can of water, 1 cup of Velveeta Light, 1 cup of fat free milk to which the cornstarch & garlic powder was added.  Omitting the water made the soup nice and thick.  I also added a few dashes of nutmeg and some ground white pepper and salt.  Very YUM!

I had an all day workshop at a community center and needed to serve lunch.  I chose this recipe because of the high ratings and was not disappointed!  Everyone loved it!  I used some of the ideas from others, using 2 packages of broccoli, 1 pint of half and half, 8 oz of velvetta and 8 oz of shredded cheddar cheese.  I mixed it up the night before, refrigerated it and put it in the crock pot the next morning.  I started in on high, and reduced to medium, stirring occassionally.  It was ready in time for lunch and a perfect consistancy.  I served it with quiche and breadsticks. I highly recommend this soup!

This was pretty good. I was a bit leery about using processed cheese, but it turned out alright. I added more cheddar cheese. I used frozen broccoli, but wish i had used fresh; the broccoli becomes very soft. A very good recipe that I will use again.

Very good!  Doing low carb, so used cream instead of milk.  Also used more cheese than recipe called for, and added shredded cheddar at end.  Used fresh broccoli because I didn't have frozen. Left out the cornstarch and water also (too many carbs!). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My husband loved this (served in Italian Bread Bowls) but I thought it tasted like processed imitation cheese food.  If I make this again, it will be with real cheese, that would make it taste much better.

Very good comfort food!  I used a little more Velvetta and I think it could use a little more broccoli, but overall it was an excellent recipe!

Pretty darn good!  I used 2 blocks of Velveeta, and skipped the garlic.  I also added a full cup of cornstarch instead of 2/3, because I wanted to ensure a stocky soup.  I'm a big onion fan, so I added two pinches (literally) of Lipton Onion soup mix.  I think it gave it a little kick.  My husband added canned tomatoes and chilies...and had 3 bowls.  Thanks for this recipe!

I love good soups and this is a very good soup. I did add extra cheese and I substituted a cup of chicken boullion for a cup of the broth. It was very tasty and satisfying. Thanks to Karin

This soup is phenomenal! I do have to admit I was a little skeptical about using processed cheese, since I'm not a huge fan of it, but I figured I would give it a try.  Like many others, I used half the butter, used minced garlic, added another bag of broccoli and added some shredded sharp cheddar at the end.  I made this with the Italian Bread Bowl recipe (also on Allrecipes.com) and the whole dish was fantastic!! My only regret is that I didn't make a double batch! Seriously, everyone has to try this.

I was looking for a good broccoli cheese soup recipe to make for my mom who was not feeling well.  Broccoli cheese soup is her favorite, but I had never made it before.  Boy did I stumble upon the perfect recipe!  This soup was so rich and flavorful and best of all, easy to make. I did follow others recommendations.  I used half and half instead of milk, double the amount of cheese, I omitted the water, added the corn starch into the cream, and put the cheese in last. I doubled the batch, kept half, and sent the other half to my parents. It got rave reviews from everyone, including my picky 6 year old!  This will go into regular rotation at our house!

This recipe is a good start. Like others, I made some modifications. 

I used 2 Tbsp olive oil and 2 Tbsp butter to sautee the onions. Threw in some minced garlic to sautee, as well. Then I added a scant 1/4c flour and whisked in the broth. This eliminated the need for cornstarch.  Pureed it all in the pot with a stick blender. Used 1/2# grated sharp cheddar, as I just can't do Velveeta.

Good soup base, I cooked a veggie mix ahead of time and then added in. This would remedy the problem of too thin a soup. Lastly, I used cream as well.

5 stars with the alterations done after reading various reviews.  The recipe as shown is a good base recipe.  I followed the advice of another reviewer as I wanted to make an impression on my family and have this taste like the soup that my daughter likes when she orders this when we go out.  My husband has never had it and wasn't sure about it at all.  I doubled the brocolli and the cheese and used one can of broth to mix with the cornstarch at the end. And I used half and half instead of the milk  The soup turned out AMAZING!  Amazing.  It makes a big pot. I was able to freeze some of it in mason jars for later.  Big hit with everyone, including the husband who requested more the following week.  This is a keeper.

With a few alterations like others have mentioned this soup can be a five star recipe. I have used this base recipe quite a few times now and have it pretty well perfected according to my family and friends. What I did was doubled the amount of cheese and broccoli. For cheese I use Velveeta 2%. Instead of milk I use half and half. This makes the soup nice and creamy. I removed the cup of water and instead used one of the cans of chicken broth with the corn starch. That made the soup nice and thick. Finally, this is personal preference, I added a tbsp of black pepper and a half tbsp of cayenne pepper when I add the garlic powder. The flavor is awesome and gets better every time you reheat it. Another thing to try is cutting up a pound of chicken breast and frying it up in a tbsp of oil, spices too if you like, and add to the soup when you add the broccoli. Just another wonderful way to make this soup.

This is an incredible recipe that I have made a few time now.  Today's version I followed a suggestion to use cheddar cheese in place of the Velveeta. I love cheddar, so I went for it.  Should you be inclined, only use the cheddar as garnish.  Using the cheddar in the recipe does not dissolve and the more you heat the more it clumps!  The original recipe is awesome and I will stick with it from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe.

In the 4 years that I have been using this site, I have never given a review for a recipe. This recipe made me feel that I had to change that. This soup is phenomenal!! The only changes I made was to use half & half instead of the milk (on the advice of other reviewers), I used 2 packages of fresh broccoli, added an extra lb of cheese, and added 4 cloves of garlic to the onion when sauteing (I am a HUGE garlic lover). This is one of the best brocolli cheese soups ever. Thank you for sharing with us!!!

Very good restaurant quality soup that was easy to make.  I also added sauted onions, carrots, and chopped garlic.  One time I made this and added 1 can of dark ale or dark beer. I substituted the beer for one  can of the chicken broth.  This is very good whichever way you make it.

This was delicious!! I only changed it by using half & half instead of milk.. It was a huge hit!! Be careful not to add the milk or halfnhalf when the broth mixture is too hot. It should not be boiling when you add it or it will curdle!

The easiest soup recipe by far.  I followed all the instructions except for two changes.
Used the white wine to cook with the onions and I did 8oz velveta cheese, 8 oz mixed shredded cheddar cheese.  I can't stop sampling the soup!

Loved it! I have made it a couple times now, and I have adopted some of the ideas from other reviewers: adding shredded carrots and using heavy whipping cream instead of milk. This last time I used a red onion too. Very good and it will definitely be on rotate in this house!

This was delicious! However, let me just say that it's not for newbies. I am recently married, and I have very minimal cooking experience. Be sure that you watch this like a hawk if you put it in the crockpot. Also, DO NOT LEAVE THE CROCKPOT ON ALL NIGHT. It will scorch, burn, turn brown, etc. Be sure to follow directions to a 'T'. The second time I made it was much better! Delicious! Be patient when adding the thickening agent, because it will take a few minutes for the mixture to thicken.

This recipe was just OK to me. It did have great flavor though. I followed the advice of many and doubled the cheese and broccoli as well as used half and half instead of milk, but it still turned out watery. The cornstarch didnt thicken it and i almost used more than the recipe called for. Im glad i didnt though because as i was eating it i realized i could already taste the cornstarch (kind of gritty). I do not know what else you would use to thicken it up. Based off reviews from other people i was expecting this to be comparable to Chili's broccoli cheddar soup (my absolute favorite soup in the world), but was disappointed :(

I love this recipe. Instead of using frozen broccoli, I steamed 4 fresh heads of broccoli, and it turned out really good. I also used 2 lbs of Velveeta cheese instead of 1. Very flavorful and creamy. Great hit with kids. If you have trouble getting your children to eat broccoli, this is a great way to change their minds about it.

Made this on a cold snowy day in Cleveland and it was perfect! It reminds me of the broccoli cheddar soup at Panera. The only thing I would change is maybe put a little bit more cheese in.

I just fixed this for lunch. I used shredded cheddar because I don't like processed cheeses. It got rave reviews from my whole family! Delicious. I will make this again. I think it tastes better then restaurant soup.

I made this EXACTLY as written above.  Despite the other reviews I thought it was mediocre at best.  Now in context... I'm a Wisconsin Girl.  WHERE IS THE CHEESE?!!!  Thankfully this was fixable.  Add 1 pound bag of sharp cheddar cheese.  1 extra pound of broccoli.  Add a TON on minced garlic and some black pepper.  Whip with an electric whipper.  Made this version for thanksgiving and it was ALL GONE!!!!!!

This is a great Broccoli Cheese soup. I modified the recipe because I wanted to put in in the crockpot.  Here is what I did: Put 4 cups broccoli (doubled the origingal amount) in crockpot with one diced onion, 3 pressed garlic cloves and 8 cups of chicken broth and a dash or two of pepper.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Added 2 cups sharp cheddar to crockpot and 1 pound of Velveeta which I melted first (not so sure that step was necessary).  Mixed in 2 cups half and half (reserved about 1/4 cup to mix about 4 tbs of cornstarch in to use in thickening).  Stir into soup until thickened to your desired consistancy and enjoy!

I would give it more stars if I could. I did make a few changes. I added more cornstrach to thicken it up, and turned the heat up after I initially added the cornstarch. The heat helps in thickening. It was wonderful! My mom even said it was better than O'Charley's!!! What a compliment! My only tip... do NOT make enough to save. We tried eating leftovers the next morning and it was clumpy and did not taste as good. This is a soup to make and enjoy that night without leftovers to keep, so just make enough for everyone present.

This was delicious.  I followed a few other suggestions which included:  Use fresh broccoli and double the amount, used 1 lb. Velveeta and 2 cups sharp cheddar, 2 cloves fresh garlic and mixed cornstarch with last can of chicken broth.  Definite keeper!

Great soup, full of great flavors. Just like others i used the real cheese (healthier). I  used more cheese and broccoli also added little bit of half and half to make it more creamy. I blended half amount of soup to make it thicker (i did not used corn starch). It's a keeper in my recipe book, I will sure make it again !!!

Like many others have recommended I use a mix of processed cheese and then some good quality shredded cheddar cheese.  I also use fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  This stuff is great in a bread bowl or just served with some on the side.

This was good but needed tweaking. First, I added carrots and celery, which really made the soup delicious.  Just brocc and cheese is often not used at restaurants (Panera uses carrots and celery), so I'm glad I added that. In the future I'll use a pound of regular cheese and not Velvetta or "cheese food" because that made it taste pretty artificial, in my opinion. Good otherwise! Kind of thin, so maybe add more cornstarch or start by adding flour to the butter for a base.

Wonderfully yummy!  Thanks for the recipe. I also, as others, doubled the cheese, used fresh broccoli, some minced garlic, pepper, and used 1/2 cup reserved chicken broth to add to the cornstarch. I threw in a diced potato for good measure. Really enjoyed this one.

I did not like this recipe at all!  It tastes too much like fake, processed cheese.  Mine came out very runny.  I was trying it out to match the taste of Panera Bread's brocolli cheddar soup.  After trying this, I am sure they use real cheese instead of processed cheese.  I won't try this again.  If you like an authentic, homemade taste, you probably won't like this one.

Turned out great! I added a head of chopped fresh broccoli along with the frozen broccoli. I took the advice of others and only used 3 cans of broth at first, then used the 4th can of broth in place of the water to mix with the cornstarch.  I also added some pepper, used half & half instead of milk, and towards the end mixed in a package of shredded cheddar cheese.

The taste of this soup is great, but it doesn't look all that appetizing.  I find that I need to add a little milk to it when I reheat it.  I've added extra veggies - the version I made tonight had broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and potatoes in it.  I also used shredded cheese instead of the "cheese food".  Nice to know that I could make it gluten free for my hubby too!

I used a 32 oz carton of chicken broth (quite a bit less than the recipe calls for). However, when it came time to add the broccoli and broth, I only poured enough broth to cover the broccoli. I saved the remaining broth to mix with the cornstarch instead of using water. I used just a bit less cornstarch and added black pepper as well. It turned out fantastic and tasted even better the next day! Everyone here loved it. :)

Great! In an effort to make it healthier I substituted a 16 oz bag of shredded mild cheddar cheese (regular, can't be low-fat because it won't melt) for the Velveeta. At first I got worried because it wasn't melting and just turning into clumps of cheese. After adding the cornstarch and turning up the heat it melted perfectly and the soup thickened so well! I only had a 32 oz box of chicken broth so it made it thicker for that reason as well.  Love it!

This soup was fantastic! I'm a hesitant cook, and have always thought that soups were beyond me-- but not so!   I did make a few changes--I sort of compbined this soup with another broccoli cheese soup that also included potatoes. I doubled the cheese (so glad I did!) added an extra can of broth (or the equivalent, I used better than boullion vegetable base added to water) threw in as much broccoli as I could (about three pounds) and put maybe half of the soup, before adding the cheese, into the blender. I also used flour instead of cornstarch.   what this tells me is that this type of soup is incredibly forgiving, and easy to make! so go nuts!! I'm freezing a lot of my extra soup and saving this recipie to use again!

Apparently I had reviewed this before, but didn't remember, so I made it again, and this is now a very different review.  The consistency of this soup is superb. Not too thick, not too thin.  The flavor is lacking and really needs something, but I don't know what. Wine?  Beer?  Don't know, but something to make it taste like something other than just cheese and broccoli.

Super Yummy! I used Half n Half instead of milk, added more seasoning, added green onions(my fav part), and topped off with Cheddar and Cayenne Pepper. I think we have a new favorite!

Super Good!!  I sort of made it into a 1 pot meal - as I'm always looking to make things easier and less messy!!  So, I made my own chicken broth w/ boulion cubes -- brought that to a boil and then added chopped onion and broccoli and let that boil for a few minutes and then added the cheese.  I totally skipped the butter and milk -- and it turned out creamy and delicious!!  Also, I cut the cornstach in half.  VERY VERY GOOD!!  WILL MAKE AGAIN!!!

I love broccoli cheese soup, and this one was delicious, I can't wait to make it again!  Next time I'll listen to the other reviews and reserve one can of broth for the corn startch, it was a tad too watery for me, I prefer thicker soup.

I also followed the advice to double the Velveeta and broccoli. When the broccoli had softened in the chicken broth, I used an immersion blender to puree much (but not all) of the broccoli. At the end (after the soup had thickened), I added 8 oz of sharp, shredded cheddar. Usually I get impatient with folks who change everything about the recipe, but these tips did yield a great result. This soup is fantastic!

Yummy.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the broccoli and the cheese; omitted the cornstarch and my hubby and I loved it...it does make quiet a bit though.  Next time I might do like GinnyAnn1 and add some cauliflower and carrots that sounds yummy

Yummy and easy. This is a cinch if you pre-cook your broccoli and onions in the microwave and then finish up the simmering in the crockpot on High. Stir often though or thickener will settle on the bottom. You can even melt the cheese in the mike if you really want to speed this up more. I used a half recipe using a little extra cheese, butter and milk and an extra handful of shredded Mexican blend cheese I had. This gave it restaurant style flavor twist instead of ALL Velveeta. I did add some salt to this too. It would have been sinfully great with half and half! Tip: Velveeta slices and cubes better, without being as sticky, if at room temperature. (Aside: My dad, an avid cheese, and Velveeta connoisseur, always claimed the flavor was fuller at room temp too. He never refrigerated his Velveeta.) Reserved broth works or you can also dissolve the cornstarch in your cold milk to cut the water out. The intro mentions it is made with broccoli florets but the recipe calls for chopped broccoli. For those who may never have noticed, there are differences in broccoli. All frozen bagged versions are technically chopped up (not whole) but most stores carry 2 types: “Broccoli Florets” only and “Chopped Broccoli” (or maybe called” Cut Broccoli” or “Broccoli Cuts”). The Chopped, or Cut, is a little cheaper but includes the chunkier, less tender, stems. The Florets, in most circles, are considered the more flavorful, tender and desirable part of the broccoli. Incidentally, fresh broccoli

Yummy!  Everyone loved this soup.  My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy so he was a little bummed that I was making this rather than a stew.  That all changed with the first bite!  I used fat free half and half and added some cheddar and jack blend with the processed cheese.  I also used fresh garlic rather than the powder.  Thank you!  Planning on making this for our family on Christmas Eve!!!

This soup was great! I made a few changes....I used half & half instead of milk, I doubled the broccoli and cheese, and instead of mixing the cornstarch into a cup of water, I mixed it into one of the four cans of chicken broth. With all of these changes, my husband said this soup was better than his mom's!!!

This was a great basic recipe and exactly what I was looking for. I will say I did make a few sight changes more because of what I had instead of for taste. I did just the recipe said until the adding the cheese. Before I added it I strained out some of the broccoli and onions and pureed them in the blender. Leaving a few of the broccoli whole. When adding the cheese I added an extra cup and a half of cheddar. The rest was all the same. Oh and instead of garlic powder I added garlic to my onions.

This was my first attempt at broccoli cheese soup, and I loved it.   The consistency was perfect.   I cut the recipe in half, and there was enough for I'd say three people.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used fresh minced garlic and I melted my Velveeta (2% kind--lower fat) with the milk in the microwave and mixed 'til smooth BEFORE adding it to the soup.  I used 50% more Velveeta and half the butter for sauteing the onion & garlic.  I used fresh broccoli chopped up pretty small.  Oh, and I reserved some of the chicken stock to mix with the corn starch to keep the soup a little thicker.  I'll be making this again.  Mmmmmmm.

I do not like to buy processed cheese food. The words just make it sound gross. But, for this recipe  I thought I would try it because cheddar cheese would have melted all clumpy. I am glad I did because this soup was excellent. I will definitely be making this one again. TFP.

This recipe is a keeper in our house! I made a few changes, added 2 cloves of garlic, and finely chopped chicken and sauted that with the onion and butter.  I omited the water and milk, and instead used 2 cups only of half and half, and ,mixed the cornstarch in that, and added that into the broth. I then added the velveta, and a few handfulls of sharp cheddar cheese.  It melted beautifully, and the soup had a very nice creamy tecture.  Thanx for the recipe!

I made this last night for dinner, it was yummy.  The only thing I did different was to not add the milk.  Someone mentioned mixing the cornstarch with the broth instead of the added water, I did that and it looked thick enough and tasted great.  I guess I was afraid the milk would make it too thin.

I think I found one other person who did not care for this soup, thank god! With nearly 500 5 star reviews, I'm thinking it's me.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a thin, no flavor kind of broccoli water. The cheese sank to the bottom of the pot despite constant stirring, this was dreadful. Sorry.

Great soup after a few minor changes.  I increased the broccoli to about 20 ounces, used 3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4, halved the garlic powder, and added some sharp cheddar cheese.  Tasted even better the next day.  Even my broccoli hating boyfriend loved this soup!  I think next time I'll try adding cauliflower and some shredded carrot.

I do not usualy leave reviews unless the recipe was just absolutly fantastic.  THIS WAS SOOO YUMMY!  I always get broccli and cheese soup at restraunts some are good and some are not.  This was the BEST I have ever tasted. 
This recipe sat in my recipe box for some time because I am not a big fan of Velveta.  But with two hungry (picky) little boys this seemed easy enough for luch.  I followed the recipe to the "T" they both gobbled it up.  My nine month old could hardly hold his eyes open he was so full and content. (and it does not have the velvta taste to it, just cheesy) When my daughter comes home from school today she is going to be thrilled.  (also her favorite soup) THANK YOU!  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!

DON'T PASS THIS RECIPE UP!! I am SOOOO glad I tried this recipe again!!  The first time I made it, I tried it in the crock pot, and I did something terribly wrong...it was awful!  But, tonight I did it on the stove and it came out FABULOUS...I did adjust the quanities though...3 medium heads of fresh broccoli, 2 lbs. of velveeta, and 6 medium potatoes, cubed.  Everything else the same...it didn't need more broth or corn starch...this was AWESOME soup and this will be the only recipe I ever need...thick, rich, yummy and filling!!

One word covers it, YUMMY!!!!!!!
This soup was very rich & cheesy & had wonderful flavor.  I did use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, & I also added potatoes & cut the amount of garlic powder in 1/2.  Homemade bread for dipping is the perfect partner with this soup.

I added a lot of extra broccoli and omited the garlic - it was excellent! I will make this again using potatos, as someone else suggested.

This soup was wonderful!  My husband wanted to make sure I had written down EXACTLY how I prepared it for the NEXT time!  I doubled the broccoli and the processeed cheese, added some sharp cheddar, sauted garlic with the onions and since we LOVE a little creole flavoring with everything, I added Tony Chachera's  seasoning.  I'll make this fantastic soup again this week for a luncheon.  GREAT RECIPE!

This was very good.  I doubled the broccoli and cheese, and it was too cheesy for me (but my husband loved it). I would recommend doubling the broccoli, but only use 1½ lbs of the cheese.  It makes a LOT of soup, so unless you're feeding an army, have some freezer containers handy for a quick mid-week dinner.

Good recipe!  It was the first broccoli cheese soup I had ever made and I thought it was pretty darn good.  It didn't thicken very quickly and I had to take it to a dinner, so plan on some time for the thickening.  Also, my husband seems to remember his grandma's being a lot better (of course he was 10, but oh well).

Thanks, Karin!

An excellent soup!  It was perfect for a drizzly, chilly Saturday!  After reading other reviews, I decided to omit the water, and used the milk to dissolve the cornstarch.  I also added sliced mushrooms and fresh minced garlic to the onion in the first step.  This recipe was great in the Italian Bread Bowls also found on this site.

Mmmm...wonderful soup, perfect for a cold day!  Next time (and will be soon!)...will cut down on the garlic powder (maybe onion too), and be very careful when simmering broccoli (and do not bring to a full boil)...will make broccoli mushy.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Sadly it has taken me this long to actually write a review for this but I must say this recipe ROCKS!!!  I made it for my mother's 50th bday party and everyone there complemented me for the soup and they loved it.  It was very easy to make and soooooooo tasty.  Better than the broccoli and cheese soups you get in restaurants.

I cut the recipe in half, and it came out great!  It was simple, and just the right consistency for us, however we prefer it slightly thin.  We left it to simmer all day, and it thickened, and was just as great.  For those of you who like it thick and REALLY cheesy, I would suggest adding more cheese, but it was fine that way it was! Great recipe.

I was disappointed with the results of this recipe. I will try to make it one more time. I will do somethings differently. I plan on omitting the onion and adding more cheese and reducing the chicken broth. It was too thin for my liking.

This has great flavor, but it was a little too thin.  Next time I will use 3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4.  I added more cornstarch to thicken it up & added cooked,cut up chicken for my meat eaters.  We loved it and will make again!!

I did not rate this as high as most because I had to make a lot of changes to the original.  I started out following the recipe and then had to had more broc., more milk and then more cornstarch to get rid of the velveeta flavor.  I also added quite a bit of cheddar cheese and a lot of pepper.  My end result was good though so it was not a total loss. Next time I would put about 1/2 lb velveeta and about 1/2 lb cheddar to start with and go from there-and more broc.  I used fresh.

This soup was excellent.  I added a little more cornstarch to make it really creamy.  I think next time I may add diced chicken and potatoes to it. It was really filling.  I also served it with  a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top. Will fix again.

This was amazing! I threw everything in my slow cooker in the morning and by dinner time it was ready. Even my super picky husband, who has only had the canned version of this soup and was nervous about trying it was blown away by this homemade version. We both loved it, it was perfect during one of our many New England snow storms this winter!!

5 Stars made as directed.  The next time I made it, I adjusted according to my family's preference.  I doubled the broccoli and the Velveeta cheese.  I didn't have the 4 cans of broth, but I always have Knorr's concentrated stock in the small tubs.  Diluted 2 tubs in 7 c. water = better than canned broth.  Pleased with the full TBLS. of garlic powder and the cornstarch mixture (no lumps as you may have using flour). I always use a big butt onion for wonderful flavor when making soups. Once it's sautéed in the butter and cooked in the broth, you don't even know it's in there.  For a variation, I can see possibly adding a few cubed potatoes of which I would probably leave out the cornstarch.  I can also see serving crumbled bacon on the side.  I personally like to top my bowl of soup with ground pepper.  This is a good recipe and open to adding personal touches.  It's a keeper as is.

More like 24 servings. There's soooo much soup! Doubling the broccoli was a must. But that velvetta for me was a mistake. I won't be using that next time. Personally I don't like the flavor of the velvetta. I'll be using mild cheddar cheese next time.

Wonderful! Great taste, and texture.  Used all fresh ingredients: broccoli and garlic. For a cheesier taste used evaporated milk (3/4 c with 1/4 water)and cream cheese (Philadelphia).

One of the best soups I've made from my all recipes collection. As other reviewers suggested, I used an entire 2lb loaf of velveeta and it was perfect. I'll be making this again and again!

This is by far the best broccoli cheese soup! I modified the recipe just a little but it still turns out great! I only use 4Tbs of butter instead of a 1/2 cup and I sauté fresh garlic with the onions instead of the powder. I also use 1/2c of the broth from the soup instead of mixing the corn starch with water. We have also used fresh broccoli. I believe this recipe is almost fool proof and be prepared to eat a great bowl of soup!!!

I loved this soup!  I like to make recipes as stated the first go around, but I did take other reviewers suggestion of eliminating the water and instead using the chicken broth to mix cornstarch.  I also added a little extra cheese to suit my tastes, but I didnt double it as some suggested.  I think it depends on how cheesy you prefer it.  I also subbed half and half for the milk to make it richer, but again, this is just personal preference.  I'm sure its good with milk too.  Overall it was very good and just like you would get at a restaurant.  My kids even loved it.

LOVED IT!  I tried to stay as close to the recipe as possible using what I had on hand.  I used 2% milk and because I did, I added another ounce of cheese.  I only had bouillon, so I replaced the chicken broth with 7 cups of water and 7 teaspoons of bouillon.  I thought the garlic may be a little too strong for us so I cut it to 1/2 teaspoon after reading some reviews.  I did keep the butter amount the same as I felt it was for flavor as well as sautéing the onion.  This is an absolutely wonderful recipe and I will be making it again.  I'm going to use fresh broccoli next time as my frozen broccoli was chopped more than I would have liked.  Thank you Karin Christian for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I added 1 medium sized onion and it was way too much! I should have put half as much as I did. I felt like that was all I could taste and it ruined the texture. I used 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour to thicken it instead of corn starch and it worked well. Wish it had been more cheesy though

This was great! I only used about 3 tbsps of butter instead of a whole stick. Use 2 9oz boxes of frozen broccoli spears.  Cooked them in the microwave and then pureed them.  Also added a small head of fresh broccoli. We don't use fake cheese in my house so I used 1 block of sharp cheddar shredded and a bag of shredded cheddar.  Mine was a little thick so I added a little extra milk and it was creamy and cheesy!

I feel very bad saying this, but my husband and I did not like this. I doubled the cheese and broccoli, and even halved the liquid.  I really think the garlic powder was WAY too much and I love garlic.

I had been craving broccoli cheese soup for days, and decided I wanted to try to make it. Of course, I'm thinking I want a thick, rich soup. I was a little let down by this one, while the flavors were good, the soup was far too runny. I may attempt to alter the leftovers (there are a ton!) by adding more cheese and/or cornstarch to thicken it up. Didn't get the soup I was looking for with this one.

I hate to be such a downer, but this did not float my boat at all. :( I consider myself a broccoli soup "snob" (I think I've had broccoli soup at nearly every restaurant within a 50 mile radius of my house lol!) and this one just didn't cut it. Not only did this lack the cheese flavor I was expecting, it was SUPER bland to boot. I must admit, I wasn't sure I was going to like this from the start. I've never considered processed cheese "REAL" food and was a tad apprehensive about cooking with it. I should have trusted my gut on this one.... A GOOD quality (SHARP) cheddar cheese would have been a MUCH better choice for this soup. This simple substitution (and a few "minor" tweaks) would have made all the difference, IMHO. Having said this, I agree with the many reviews on here suggesting the need for MORE cheese AND broccoli. Doubling both is an absolute MUST (and advice I wish I would have taken to heart). All in all, I'm glad to have given your recipe a try, but I think I'll defer to Jessie's cream of broccoli soup or stop by my local Panera when the craving strikes. Thanks anyways, Karin. :)

This was Awesome!  I did not use all the butter, and I just made a roux with  3 Tbs. of flour , I didn't have frozen broccoli, so I used fresh.  And used homemade chicken broth instead of canned.  Yum!

Followed the recipe practically to a T and I agree with all the others, it is the BEST broccoli cheese soup I've ever had!!!

The only thing I changed was add 3 cans of broth at first, then mix the cornstarch with the 4th can at the end.

I was not a fan of this, but my 4 year old and my husband loved it.  I must say it did taste as I expected, so it gets 4 stars for being as advertised.  I'm just more of a cheese purist and don't care for processed cheese food.   It was an easy dish to prepare and I most likely will make it again since everyone liked it so much.

Excellent!  This was my first attempt to make broccoli & cheese soup.  I used 2 heads of fresh steamed brocolli & used 4 boullion cubes disolved in 4 cups water.  I also added a tad more cornstarch & used half & half instead of milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was so easy and the best broccoli cheese soup recipe I have made yet.  I have a very picky family and they all ate this one.  Highly recommend!

This is wonderful.  We used 2 bouillon cubes, which were sautéed per Serena's advice, after onion and garlic were softened, adding 6 cups water after  the broccoli was put into the pot (minus one cup, which was saved and mixed with 1/2 cup cornstarch to add when called for).  Used 6 tblsp butter instead of 1/2 cup.  Used 3 12 ounce pkgs frozen broccoli and could have used a 4th, but it was good.  Used 1 cup evaporated skim milk and 1 cup fat free half and half.  Shredded 1 pound of medium cheddar into the soup when all was cooked.  This is very easy and elegant.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this last night for my family, everyone really liked it, my DH had two big bowls of it with his sandwich.  I just cut the garlic in half and added a little Tabasco for zing.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing. Ennisgem

I thought this was fantastic. I did make a few changes. I cooked onion and a a clove of garlic instead of using garlic powder. I also used 3 cans chicken broth and 1 can cream of broccoli soup, the package of frozen broccoli as well as a head of fresh broccoli and a chopped zucchini  (we like chunky soup). I also didn't use a full cup of water, just enough to dissolve the cornstarch (maybe 1/3 cup). This was so good my grandmother, the best cook I know, asked for the recipe!!! I will be making this again and again!

I have a few notes...this may be really obvious to most of you, but DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE REAL CHEESE FOR THIS RECIPE.  I hate the idea of using processed "cheese" food so I tried it with cheddar, which lumped and promptly burned to the bottom of my pot, even at a simmer.  The one thing I would do differently were I to make this soup again the right way is to make a rue first, with butter, onions and flour or cornstarch right at the beginning.  It is a lot easier than trying to add the thickener later.

This is really good.  Giving it five stars despite the changes I made as the ingredients are the same, just the amounts are different.  I only added two cans of chicken broth.  When I melted the cheese after the broccoli was cooked, it was the consistency I wanted, so I only added 1/2 cup milk, and no water or cornstarch.  Made it a little richer, but the flavor is excellent!

This was a great recipe. I tried it and my family loved it. It was the first time I have made this soup and it turned out awesome. The only thing I tweaked was to mix flour and chicken broth at the end...otherwise perfect as is.

This soup is amazing.. I don't know why I'd ever buy Broc Cheese at Panera ever again.. I used huge sourdough loaves and put the soup inside.. it was fantastic.. my toddler loved it as well.. I used a little more cornstarch and water because I like a thicker soup but everyone should easily be able to adjust that to their own liking by adding it slowly until its as thick as you want... definitely will be making this all winter long and saving tons of money from going to panera everyday... I think the soup was even better the following few days but I love leftovers...

LOVE THIS SOUP!!!!  I just started making it about a month ago.  The first time I had left over cooked bacon so I chopped some up and put it in there.  YUM!  I also added a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic.  I have also made it w/o bacon.  Both were fantastic.

Very good soup.  I added chopped carrots with the onions, used diced garlic instead of powdered, used fresh broccoli, and beer instead of the water.  Maybe that's another recipe somewhere else, but my wife loves it, and the flavor is out of this world.

This soup is delicious!  I used fresh broccoli and whatever cheeses I had on hand (in this case jarlsberg, mozzarella and cheddar).  I used 1/2 c cream instead of milk.  Also used 2 fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.  My husband and I gobbled it up and the little bit remaining was served with a fried egg for lunch the next day.

Good recipe. I have tried making it without a recipe and it never worked. My husband though I bought it from the store. I added chopped garlic, 1 celery stick and 1 carrot stick in with the onion. Also a little cyanne or red pepper.

I was looking forward to having a hot bowl of soup on a cold December night and have to say that I did not care for this.  So bad that we gave up tossed it out without even forcing it on the family.  I would give it negative stars if I could.

Very good soup but I did make a few changes.  I substituted  about 1/4 of a cup of olive oil in place  of butter and I used the hand blender to puree the whole thing once the broccoli was soft and I added soy milk instead of milk. I used shredded cheese and added that at the end like someone suggested.  I didn't add any garlic powder but I think next time I will just use fresh garlic. It was delicious with bread rolls.

Really simple to make but tastes like you spent hours on it! Before adding the cheese I scooped out 3/4 of the broccoli, pureed it and poured it back in. I used a combination of REAL cheddar cheese slices and Muenster cheese slices(real cheese always tastes better than processed!) and used half and half instead of milk and I am surprised at how delicious this came out!

Needed some real cheddar cheese for more flavor.  Added about 3-4 cups of shredded cheese to make it truly delicious.

I've made this twice in two weeks and there are only two of us.  I didn't freeze any of it because I couldn't stop eating it!  I made two changes.  I used 2 bags of broccoli and 1 pound of Velveeta but also 1/2 pound of Monterey Jack Velveeta.  Amazing!!!!

Great recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly the way it was written, turned out delicious! I made it again, but this time followed some of the other reviews and added more of the cheese and used heavy whipping cream for a thicker, cheesier soup....it was just a great as well :)

This is a very forgiving recipe and it tastes delicious. You can substitute with whatever you have on hand, it seems, and it will still turn out fine. I used a little more onion than it called for and fresh broccoli. Next time I'll be sure to chop the broccoli finer instead of just using the prewashed florets straight from the bag I also used shredded cheese (Mexican 4 cheese) instead of cheese food/Velveeta. Next time I'll use cheddar just to give a little bit more color to the soup, as kids say, "cheese is supposed to be yellow!" I also used heavy whipping cream (had to clean out my fridge). As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted the last cup of water with chicken broth for mixing with the cornstarch.

Excellent taste.  Used suggestion of wine and final cup chicken broth with cornstarch instead of water.  Used half velveeta and half cheddar.  Thick, rich.  Next time I will double broccoli as someone suggested.

Really good however, this is not a soup that you can eat really more than one bowl...very rich (I added alittle more milk too) and thick.

This was absolutely delicious!!!! I used more broccoli and added 3 cloves of garlic. I listened to another reviewer since the first time It was too thin. I covered the broccoli with THREE cans of chicken broth instead of four. Instead of mixing cornstarch with water, I mixed it with the FOURTH can of chicken broth.

Really, really good and very rich. My husband loved it. Next time I will half the recipe since it is just the two of us. It is great for a large group if you are making the full recipe. It is a filling, flavorful soup. I made it exactly as written and can't think of a thing to change.

I modified the recipe and it was barely 4 stars. I only gave it 4 because I know there is room for improvement which will make it a 5 star recipe. Here's what I did: Used 4 tbsp butter, used 2 packages of broccoli, used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and added lots of fresh ground black pepper. I also added a package of instant potatoes at the very end to give it a creaminess.  It was extremely salty. Way too salty for my tastes although my husband loved it. The only thing I can think of is that it came from the chicken broth and velveeta because I didn't add any salt to it. It also had a very unappealing layer of butter floating on the top. Not a very pretty presentation. Next time I will cut the butter down to 2 tbsp, use real cheese, and use 2 cups milk, 2 cups chicken broth, and 2 cups water like I do with my potato soup.

I used two packages of broccoli and 1 1/2 pounds of cheese. This recipe freezes surprisingly well, once thawed it seemed like it had separated a bit, but once reheated it looked and tasted as good as it did when fresh.

This was delicious...even better the next day!  I followed other recommendations and doubled the cheese and broccoli, as well as used part milk and part 1/2 and 1/2. Used real garlic vs. the powder.  I did add mushrooms, too.  Think it would have been better without them as the kids are not fans.  Great recipe.  Makes a lot!  Will definitely make again.

What a great recipe!  My 3 year old loves this recipe and it has changed my mind about broccoli cheese soup, too.  I use low sodium fat free chicken stock and add fresh pressed garlic to the onions when they are done cooking.  This is a definite go-to soup recipe for the whole family and sooo easy.

My husband and I severely disliked this item.  The cheese was just disgusting and I think it's a preference thing as we must not be huge fans of "processed cheese food".  It had promise but the sickly sweet taste of the cheese ruined it for us.

Excellent with my changes: I halved the recipe. used fresh broccoli and real shredded cheddar cheese. 1.5x the cheese. I also used 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic sauteed in with the onions and no garlic powder. I also used about a T less butter and 3.5 cups of chicken broth. DELICIOUS!

Fresh garlic with the onion instead of powdered.  Added a handful of mild cheddar and a handful of sharp cheddar. Mom loves Panera's and said this soup was "the best ever"!

Made this exactly as written, because I don't believe you can review when you deviate from the original recipe.  Anyhow, did not like it.  Will try again taking into consideration some reviews.  Thanks for sharing though!

Mmm! This was really good but I did follow other reviewers advice and made a few alterations.

I used 1.5 lbs of processed cheese and a bag of shredded cheddar & pepper jack cheese

2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder

half and half instead of milk

double the broccoli

left out the water and mixed the corn starch with a half can of chicken broth

it was delicious.  my boyfriend ate it for lunch and dinner and his family ate the rest.  he says it's better than the broccoli cheese soup we always get at Panera Bread!  I will definitely make this again

I did do some alterations and everyone loved this recipe.  I downsized the processed cheese food and I used fresh broccoli that I boiled and then threw in the food processor instead of the frozen stuff. I also used less butter (about 1/2) of what the original recipe suggest.

It was easy to prepare as I smashed up the broccoli after simmering it, negating the use of a blender.  I used half cheddar cheese (all I had), and cream cheese because I had some I needed to use it.  It came out thick and tasted great. To the person whose soup did not thicken, make sure all cornstarch and water are combined with no lumps and I stirred for about five minutes slowly till consistent to my own desired thickness.

WOW! This soup was amazing. Hubby proclaimed it both "awesome" and "outstanding". I made it as directed except I used fresh broccoli. It was thick and delicious. I know it will be in regular rotation. NOTE to those who are adding condensed soup, yuk! It doesn't need it for taste, and it's not necessary. It thickens beautifully and tastes great.
Obviously IMO. Thanks.

Good - The 2/3 cup of corn starch made it really thick and I had to add milk to thin it out. Added sea salt as well.  Will not use so much corn starch next time -

My son likes anything with CHEESE and  I like that I can sneak in a great veggie like broccoli all in one pot! This soup is great. I did take others advice and doubled the broccoli and added a bag of shredd mild chedder to pump up the cheese favor. I had no problems with the soup thickening up for me. I did add a little white wine for some nice flavor along with a little hot sause. Yum Yum!

What a fantastic soup! By far the best recipe I have come across. I used fresh broccoli and added a little more because I like lots of it in my soup. I will only be making this recipe for now on. Thank you for sharing.

I added more broccoli to this recipe.  Also, I wish I had blended the broccoli to avoid too many chunks-I like smooth soup.  Other than that, very yummy!

I did make several changes, but the soup turned out great.  I can't have any broths right now, so instead of the broth and garlic powder, I threw fresh garlic in towards the end of cooking the onions and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  Processed cheese is on the list of things I can't have right now too, so I used cheddar.  I was also out of corn starch, so instead I added potato flakes.

This is a great recipe if you're looking for a quick, easy, and delicious soup to make! I went ahead and added a block of cream cheese and a few dashes of cayenne pepper, and it paired beautifully with this recipe! Give it a try if you want to kick up your broccoli cheese soup!

Made this with the recommendations from others-doubled the broccoli and cheese, used half & half instead of milk. The end result was just right consistency (not too thick or too thin), tasted good and was easy to prepare.

Basically, proves the theory that any broccoli cheese soup that includes processed cheese spread (velveeta) as an ingredient is going to be good!  Very tasty -- I used 1/2 turkey stock to replace 1/2 the chicken broth (trying to use it up), and added some white wine to the onions (though couldn't really appreciate that in the final product).  Otherwise, made exactly as written.  Great!

Great tasting soup. I used mild shredded cheddar, fresh broccoli and garlic, and 1/2 & 1/2 as suggested by other reviewers. I had a problem with the cheddar not completely melting which made it a little chunky, but still turned out well.

I chopped celery, garlic and carrots and sauted with the onions.  I agree the soup wasn't as thick as I like so I throw in a few dehydrated potato flakes until it is the consistency I like.  Serve in bread bowls.... YUM!

This is beyond all doubts awesome! I used olive oil, chicken cube and water, store brand processed cheese and skim milk. The soup thickened up beautifully and tasted amazing. I might add more broccoli in the future. Thanks for sharing this. Will definitely make again and again.

My husband let on that he enjoyed this soup. Perhaps he was just being nice, as I did not like how it turned out. The chicken broth and the cheese did not mix well and the soup appeared to have little "floaters" all over the place. It didn't taste horrible, but it was definitely not a success either. I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted and even tried some of the "tweaks" other members suggested. I guess I'll have to try a different one next time!

Giving this basic recipe an Indian spin is in order. Add some cumin, paprika, curry powder or any combination, plus some red pepper flakes. But someone left out the GARLIC! Any soup worth it's salt (or garlic!) deserves this. Live a little!!!

Just awesome.  Had a bunch of extra broccoli from the garden and used it up.  Ended up using the immersion blender to thin it out a bit before adding the cheese.  Turned out supper awesome.

Great soup but definately better the next day! I didn't have any velveeta on hand but I used about 4 cups of grated cheddar and it was wonderful.  I also didn't cut up the broccoli too small and the family enjoyed the texture.  I think I will try to processed cheese next time just to see the difference.  I will definately make this again.....and again...and again.

This was pretty good, but needed some additions to make it really good. I added about a tbsp of minced garlic to the onion (and didn't use the powder to the end product). After tasting the soup in the end stages I added about 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp smoked paprika, and 1/2 tsp garlic salt. This also needed more cheese flavor so I added a cup of extra sharp cheddar. With these additions this soup was wonderfu. Served in bread bowls (Italian bread bowls on this site).

OMG!!  That is all I can say about this soup!  The best I have ever had anywhere, just like the resturant style cheese and broccoli soups!  I hate it when people change the recipe but I did according to so many of the reviews...I doubled the cheese and broccoli, I used half and half rather than milk, and I used more chicken stock with the cornstarch rather than water......amazing!!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe and all the great tips in the reviews!!!!

This is soup is the creamiest & richest broccoli soup ever! I love it.  I'm only giving it four stars because after reading everyone's comments I did change a few things. You really need to double the amount of broccoli and cheese. I used fresh chopped garlic cooked with my onions and I used cream instead of milk. I also dissolved my cornstarch in the cream instead of adding the water. Yum :) My husband who was appalled at the thought of a broccoli soup ate 3 bowls of it. Give it a try.

This was an easy and awesome recipe- my first time for this kind of soup- as per others I doubled the velveeta, and used some left over heavy cream to thicken up the 2% in the fridge- my twist was adding a second bag of broccoli/cauliflower mix, and a small handful of frozen peas---- then i saw a bag of diced ham and thought why not?  In hindsight I'd make the ham chunks larger than the prepackaged ones, and maybe even ANOTHER 3rd bag of broccoli/cauliflower mix. It seemed like you couldnt add enough stuff to this and change the basic excellent flavor of the main sauce.  Also- excellent next day over rice, or maybe baked potato. On day one we bought some fresh italian bread and just dipped-- definitely playing with this recipe again thanks!

I add fresh broccoli and add 1 cup of red wine and a cup of portobella mushrooms and roasted garlic.  I've made this for years and it's the best soup ever!

Takes better than Panera!  Very good soup!  I used fresh broccoli (2x amt shown), half & half rather than milk, and minced garlic rather than powder.  Huge hit at our house.  Made a big batch & froze in individual servings to enjoy later.  Not exactly healthy, but so delicious.  :)

This is a great soup.  I prefer to use 'real' ingredients so I made a few changes after reading reviews.  I used fresh broccoli, grated cheddar cheese and fresh garlic.  As suggested by other reviewers I also chose to add extra broccoli and only used 1/4 corn starch to add some thickness.  A great soup to freeze and reheat, yum!

Another Excellent soup.  Due to a wisdom tooth pulled, had to make modifications.  I cooked the broth and frozen plus fresh broccoli in one pot.  In the other I cooked diced onion in white wine and added black peper and crushed garlic the last few minutes.  I then added a tablespoon of flour to the onion to serve as my thichening agent.  Then added the broth and broccoli mix, boil slightly to thicken then pureed with my immersable blender.  Added some processed cheese and sharp cheddar, fat free milk.  It turned out fabulous.  The broccoli flavor very pronounced.  My BF ate just about the whole pot.  No left overs here.  This is a keeper!

This soup is delicious! I used the processor to finely dice the onions and the broccoli before cooking in butter and broth...I used dental floss to cut the cheese into cubes.

I was honestly surprised that this soup turned out so well, because I had concerns about the amounts of the ingredients. I did use less butter, though. Otherwise, I basically stuck with the original recipe. You really do need to use the amount of cornstarch (it seemed a lot at first) indicated in order for the soup to turn out thick. I may add more broccoli next time. I also used less garlic powder than indicated, but this is just personal preference. My husband and son really enjoyed the soup, and each had seconds. I will definitely make this again!

This was an excellent soup, quick and easy with wonderful flavor.  I did use Velveeta 2% and the first time the cheese seperated as I had the heat too high but this time was perfect since I used lower heat.  Also I did use fat free half and half instead of milk and my husband commented on how creamy the soup the looked and tasted.  Will be making again soon.

The soup is awesome! A few suggestions though…reduce the butter by half and double to broccoli. My husband and I love broccoli and the first time I made it there just wasn’t enough for us so I added 2 bags of broccoli the next time. Turned out great, just the way we like it.

This was FANTASTIC!  My kids loved this soup.  I did make some minor changes to fit my family’s taste.  First off I used two large heads of FRESH broccoli…it’s cheap right now at my farmers market. I chopped and placed in my large pot and added a little water and turned to high and put a lid on it for about 10 min. to cook. I also used fresh garlic instead of the powder stuff.   I halved the recipe and only used 4 TBS of corn starch mixed in with 1 cup of broth instead of water….it called for 5 TBS corn starch + 1tsp ( 1/3 cup cornstarch broken down into TBS)  It just looked like it was too much and I always have bad luck with recipes calling for cornstarch and it coming out way too thick.  This amount was perfect.  I served this with French bread with butter, garlic powder and Italian seasonings.  I will for sure make this one again!

Ok - my broccoli cheese soup changed from a 4-star recipe to a 5-star recipe overnight.  Good rule of thumb:  Do not review your soups until the next day.  Soups aren't at their best until the flavors have blended in.  Overnight, it thickened up even a bit more, and it tastes great.  The only thing I did differently was double the broccoli and the cheese.  I used 1 pound of Velveeta and 1 pound of real medium cheddar.  Before starting the soup, I would recommend putting your broccoli in a food processor after thawing a little (if you're using frozen) - just 2 or 3 pulses will do the trick. I much prefer my broccoli in finer bits over huge chunks.

Very good (and rich).  I used fresh broccoli so I pureed it once it was cooked (with the broth/onion mixture).  I also used half & half.  Makes a huge pot of soup.

OMG This recipe is fabulous. I can honestly say I have never had such a delicious broccoli cheese soup. It was easy to prepare, the only changes I made was to use 1 cup milk & 1 cup heavy cream, and added about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I will make this often, Thank you so much for such a great recipe.

Excellent recipe! I made only a couple of changes and let me tell you, it went FAST! I omitted the onion and sauteed fresh broccoli in the butter (didn't use frozen). I also doubled the cheese (used a 32oz. loaf). Then I made a triple batch and it fed 21 people total (just my family and the teen friends) with only 5 servings left over (which frreze BEAUTIFULLY btw!). We paired the soup with sandwiches for some, garlic bread for others, and just crackers for the rest of the group. This recipe satisfied people 6yrs to 53yrs old! I have a large family (many kids) and easy and satisfying meals such as this are such a blessing! Thank you so much for sharing... I see this one in my family for many years to come!

Easy and delicious!  I will say to be patient getting it to thicken.  It took me at least 20 minutes on medium heat and quite a bit of stirring, but it did come out thick and rich.  Great recipe!

My kids loved this soup! I did change it a little because I wanted to make it in the crock pot. I only used 2 cans of broth and then used my handheld blender once it was cooked. I served it in bread bowls with salad and it was a hit!

This soup is amazing. It's the first soup I have ever made and it was very easy. Going by other reviews, I doubled the broccoli and cheese. I also added about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the onion while they were cooking. It took a lot longer for me to make this than the time on the recipe gives. I had trouble getting it to thicken so I let it sit on low for about an hour. All in all, this is a great recipe and I will be making this again!

This was soooo good. I too modified the recipe a little by adding 1 small can of green chiles and 1 diced tomato. Also some pepper and a little garlic salt with parsley. As i was making the soup i realized i didn't have chicken broth, i always do and was hesitant, but decided to use chicken boulin cubes instead of going out to the store. It Tasted great and i even skipped the garlic powder since the boulin had lots of added flavors. It all worked out and this was by far the best tasting cheese soup!!! I Will be making it for family and guests!  Thanks All Recipe!

Wonderful recipe!!  I put the onions and broccoli in the food processor for my family that has trouble with "seeing vegtables" - it did the trick, they loved the soup plus it cut a little of the cook time.

I made this with white wine and white cheddar cheese. I also used the hand blender to puree the veggies before the cheese went in. 

I agree that it does get a bit salty from the chicken stock and cheese. Not sure what can reasonably be done about that.

I also see the concerns about the consistency not being cheesy enough. I suggest you wait for the soup to cool just a little before adding more cheese as it does thicken up as it cools. Otherwise, you end up with fondue - which isn't all bad either!

Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

This was a great base recipe, kudos!  I did change a few items just because I didn't have them on hand.  I did take the advice to add a cup of white wine to the simmering onions.  i only uses 6- 8oz cups of chicken broth, added 1 cup of condensed cream of mushroom soup.  Used 2o oz of broccoli, and used all purpose flour instead of cornstarch.  This came out fantastic and it was sooooo easy.  Will use this again and again!

Awesome.  I took some other reviewers advice by using heavy cream instead of milk and slightly reducing the cornstarch to 1/2 cup and mixing it with chicken broth instead of water and lastly, I used medium cheddar instead of cheese food.  I still gave 5 stars because it would taste good as posted.

Excellent soup. I doubled the broccoli and cheese and added some minced garlic. Also topped with some cheddar cheese before serving.

Took the advice of others and decreased the butter to 6 tablespoons, added 3 minced garlic cloves to the onion mixture, used 2lbs fresh broccoli (chopped in my cusinart), used half and half instead of milk, and doubled the velveeta...it was good but WAY, WAY, WAY to rich.  Next time I'll do everything I did except doubling the cheese....it's way too much cheese!

I honestly felt that this is way too rich to be a soup. The amount of processed cheese and butter makes this soup very heavy. My boyfriend said the flavors were great, but he ended up eating it as a dip with chips!

I was looking for something that could come close to Subway's Broccoli & Cheese soup, but this recipe was far superior and beat all of my expectations. Cut down the serving size for our small family of 3, and followed instructions to the letter. Awesome recipe - thank you!

Very good! This is my husband's favorite soup. I usually follow the directions pretty precisely but this last time I didn't have Velveeta so I used mild shredded cheddar instead and it was just as good. I also add some fresh garlic to the butter/onion and use three times the broccolli. Delicious!

Delicious! I read the recipe and thought their were too many liquid ingredients for the amounts of broccoli and cheese, so I modified the recipe as follows:  I boiled the broccoli florets in salted water until tender, then drained.  In a 2 quart soup pot, sauteed one small, chopped yellow onion in approx. 3 heaping Tablespoons margarine until translucent. Added the broccoli and 2 cans of chicken broth to the pot. Brought the ingredients to a slow boil, then turned to low heat and added the pound of cubed Velveeta, stirring until melted. Sprinkled with granulated garlic to taste. Mixed 3 heaping Tablespoons cornstarch with one cup milk, and added to the soup to thicken.  This was more than enough for my family of four.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!

My tweaks: I used Goya brand Adobo seasoning instead of garlic powder (the one that includes pepper), and it came out especially yummy! I love the Panera version of this soup, and read on the ingredients that they included tumeric, which Adobo has in it, so I figured what the heck. Came out great!

I also, as others did, replaced the milk with half an half. 

Loved it! A new family favorite!

I only gave this 4 stars because I tweeked it a little.  I added some celery and garlic to the onions to add some more flavor.  I also added 1 diced red pepper to the broccoli.  I then used sharp cheddar and velveeta together. I was very happy with the outcome and will make it this way again.

This soup is excellent! I found that using Velveeta is key. The off brand stuff is NOT the same, IMO. I made this soup for my picky 92 year old grandma and she must have said 3 times how much she loved it. Now I make batches and bring her a big container because it is easy for her to eat if run the immersion blender through it. The only change I made was adding fresh minced garlic with the chopped onion. I used skim milk and it still tastes very rich. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I love Broccoli Cheese soup but had never made it before. I was very pleasantly surprised that this recipe turned out amazing! I also made the following changes to the recipe: added 2 bags of broccoli and 2 boxes of velvetta, covered the broccoli in 3 cans of broth and mixed the cornstarch in the 4th can (omitted water). It came out perfect!!! I will definitely be making this again.

I made this soup last night and followed the recipe to the letter. Though it was extremely good..it lacked the cheesyness that my family was hoping for.  I would definitly up the quantity of cheese next time I make it. Other than that...a really good recipe!

I absoutley love this recipe. I have made it several times. I also, mix my cornstarch with the 4th can of broth, I always add extra cheese, and we even sprinkle sherdded cheese on the soup in our bowls. This soup is also great when warmed up. My only advice: when you add the cheese make sure you turn down the heat and cook it slowly or else the cheese does burn on the bottom!!

Very tasty soup.  I took some of the suggestions here, used 1.5 lbs fresh  broccoli and a little over 1 lb of Velveeta.  Instead of sauteing onion in butter, I cooked the broccoli and onion in 2quarts minus one cup of chicken broth seasoned with the garlic powder.  Then, I used one 12 ounce can of evaporated milk and mixed the cornstarch with the remaining cup of broth.  I used my immersion blender to break up any big pieces of broccoli.

Unfortunately, the garlic powder was WAY too overpowering for this soup.  I only put in 2 tsp and was still overwhelmed by the taste/smell of the garlic powder.  I had a couple of friends taste it, and they agreed with me.

This is a great recipe!  I made it for my family, in particular my brother visiting from out of town.  He's not the biggest broccoli cheese soup fan.. I wanted to change his mind!  I made several changes, but basically stuck to the recipe.  I used fresh broccoli, and more than called for.  Instead of chicken broth I used veggie broth.  I couldn't find the "light" version of the processed cheese, so I only used about half of the block.  Also, as some other reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 and 1/2, but only one cup.  I also didn't add the cornstarch.  I topped it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese (my fave!).  With my modifications it wasn't as thick and creamy as the kind you might find in a restaurant, but it wasn't lacking in flavor whatsoever, and everyone, big bro included, really enjoyed it! :)

I like this soup, however, i had to make some changes.  I used plain flour instead of corn starch, real cheddar cheese instead of that fake stuff, and sometimes i use leeks instead of onions (or in addition to).

Despite the overwhelming postive feedback, as an experienced cook, I thought this recipe was nothing to rave about. It was not creamy and the cheese did not seem to dislove properly. It did not resemble or taste anything like Panera's version. I will not make again.

I used a combination of Velveeta and shredded cheddar cheese.  As I did not have enough Velveeta, but I really don't like the overpowering taste of it anyhow.
This recipe is delish, would make again.

I have tried a few Broccoli Cheese Recipes and so to try another seemed redundant.  Boy am I happy I tried this one!  It was thick and did not seperate like a few of the other recipes I have tried.  I did use fresh broccoli so what I did was boil the fresh Broccoli in only about a 1 1/2 c. of water and THAT water was what I used for the recipe, minus whatever was over the 1/2 cup called for.  I just mashed the broccoli with a potato masher and than continued to follow the recipe.  Kids,who are the Broccoli Cheese Soup lovers liked that the next day, the leftovers were just as thick and delicious as the first time around.

Absolutely delish! I have been making this forever. I made this for my little brother when he came to visit a few summers ago. He called me a few months later craving it and wanting the recipe. lol I usually always make this a one dish meal by frying chicken breast in olive oil and seasoning (Adobo among others). I will sear the outside of the chicken (on high) until it is golden and carmelized, then chunk it and add it to the soup partially uncooked. This way the chicken will soak up some of the flavors. I make this an all day affair by boiling the chicken broth, broccoli and chicken together and then adding other ingredients. I have done it in the crock pot too. Oh the possibilities! Also it's great to serve with bread of some kind to sop up the juices. PS. I only use real cheddar.

This was the best! Even better than Panera Bread & that one is hard to beat. The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of half & half & 1 cup of milk, instead of 2 cups of milk. Great recipe. Thanks Karin. Anne B.

Very tasty.  I used fresh broccoli, and added sharp cheddar with the velveeta.  I also added potatoes.  Very filling and yummy.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought that it needed more broccoli and it was not thick enough.  It tasted alright.  Just not what I was looking for.

My family has never been into soup, and I have never made any kind.  I had purchased alot of fresh broccoli when it was sale and wanted something to do with it. I found this recipe and took a shot at making it. Everyone LOVED it! I added extra Cheddar, just because we are cheese freaks. It was so easy and looked and smelled great. Will definitely make again!

I followed others suggestions and added more broccoli(fresh)and a little cheddar cheese. I also added 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic instead of the garlic powder and used half and half instead of milk. It was good but the processed cheese makes it very rich.  I will definitely make it again but next time I will add more cheddar and less processed cheese.

this may be the best soup i ever had!  i used a 24 oz bag of frozen chopped brocolli and upped the cornstarch to a whole cup.  next time i will only use 1/2 STICK of butter instead of the whole thing because it kind of pooled on top.  regardless, the soup was delish!

This is the best!  I did make quite a few changes to the quantities that were listed on the original recipe based on previous reviews:  

I used 32 oz of fresh broccoli instead of 16 oz of frozen.

3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4.

2 cups of half and half instead of milk.

1 tsp of garlic powder.

1/2 cup of cornstarch.  

I also added 1 tsp of mustard and 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Prior to stirring in the cubed cheese, I took about half the broccoli/broth mixture out and blended it until smooth.  Then I returned it to the pot and added the rest of the ingredients.  Where it calls for 1 cup of water, I used a fourth can of broth instead.

I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream b/c I needed to use it up.  I also added a a few big "glops" of diced hot green chilis to add some 'kick'.  It was delicious! Update:  adding the 1 cup of white wine with the onions really makes this a fancy soup!  I always make it with the wine now!

This soup was very good, but just didn't live up to my expectations after all the rave reviews.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the broccoli and cheese and cut back on the broth.  I also made a roux with flour instead of cornstarch after I sauteed the onions.  Maybe the cornstarch is the key, because the soup didn't thicken up as I would have liked.  Also, although I was very careful not to boil the soup once I added the cheese, it had some little curdles of cheese- maybe the velveeta didn't melt all the way?  I did use the reduced fat velveeta, which might have been the problem too.  We really did like the soup in spite of these few problems, but we just weren't completely in love with it like everyone else.  I might try this again without making any changes at all, to see if it makes a difference.

One of my favorite recipes! I have made this soup many times and received rave reviews. I use a 2lb loaf of velveeta cheese, 2 heads of fresh broccoli, an extra onion, and since I like to make a ton of it to freeze for leftovers I tend to use more chicken broth (or use boullion cubes w/ extra water). I also throw in some sliced potatoes sometimes. I use a food processor to finely dice (almost puree) the broccoli stems and one head and the 2nd head I tear into very small florets. I always serve it with "cheddar toast" and top it with bacon bits. This is my husband's favorite soup of all time.

So easy and so good!!  Super fast - it took me less than 30 minutes.  Makes a ton, so if you don't have a lot of people to feed, cut the recipe in half.  I followed the advice of others and used less liquid to make a thicker soup (3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4).  I am definately going to make this again!

I think my expectations were a little high after reading the rave reviews.  This was just okay.  If I make it again I'll use flour instead of corn starch and mix in with the butter and onions in the beginning to make a roux.  (This was a bit too much corn starch and we don't like the taste.)  It needs salt and cracked pepper.  I used twice the amount of cheese and a little more broccoli.  I may make this again, but will change it up a bit.

I've served this three times -- two large gatherings and one small family meal, for which I scaled down to half.  It was a massive hit all three times and I didn't change a thing.  This is quick, easy, and delicious.

This was just what I was looking for.  I followed the directions pretty much the same as posted, only I used one large (50oz) can of Swanson's Chicken stock instead of 4 cans (available at Sam's Club), and I throw some small pieces of diced ham (leftovers from Christmas dinner) in.

It looks like a LOT of broccoli, but don't be alarmed. I was a bit conservative, but after adding the last ingredient, I was chopping up more broccoli.

This soup is delicious! This is one of my favorite soups... however I have made several of the changes others have suggested.  I like adding extra sharp cheddar cheese as well as fresh garlic with the sauteing onions.  Also I half the soups as I do with many recipes since I am usually feeding one or two.  Also I like to grate in a few fresh carrots near the end to give some color and a little more nutrients.  Overall awesome recipe a must try for all~!

HOOOOLLLLYYYYY Good soup....Love love love it!!! Made this recipe for my family lastnight and it's already gone.  I did put a wee bit more cheese (we love cheese) and a little less garlic...but kept everything else the same and it was OUTSTANDING!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful, with a few changes I read from others.  I did it in the crock pot.  2lbs cheese, 2 bags broccoli and only 2 cans broth. Perfect to us.  I did thicken at the end using liquid right from the pot.   YUMMY

I really liked this soup with the recommended tweeks from everyone else.  I also used the full block of Velveeta and it was almost too cheesy, but still really good.  I also doubled the brocoli.  Thanks for the great soup!!!

This soup was a hit with my family. We love the broccoli cheese soup that is served at Ruby Tuesday's and Callahan's in Kalamazoo Michigan. Now I can duplicate the taste and texture with this recipe. thanks!

I also had problems getting this to thicken for some reason.  So, I made lots of changes to this recipe and it came out awesome.  I included cream of chicken soup, cream of broccoli soup, and 3 different kinds of cheeses!!  It was incredible.

I made this for the second time today, and my whole family loved it.  I use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and I used american slices instead of cubed cheese.  I serve it with sliced french bread.  I think it is super easy and fast to make.

This soup had a wonderful taste, but I made the mistake of using Light Velveeta and it turned out curdly.  The consistency of the soup looked awful, but it still tasted wonderful.

My husband loved this soup!  I'll definitely make it again, but I might use a little less garlic powder.  Very tasty, but perhaps a little strong.  VERY easy to make, and quick.

This was fabulous!  So thick and cheesey and best of all - EASY TO MAKE! It tasted like from a restaurant!! Be careful to keep the heat LOW when adding the cheese and milk - velveeta started sticking to the bottom of my pot and got a little brown in some spots...

I substituted the suggested cheese for American sliced cheese, blue cheese and cream cheese since that is what I currently had at home. I also cooked some chicken breasts in the chicken broth before starting and than added the torn pieces of chicken when I included the broccoli to the recipe. It turned out wonderful and I plan on making it more often.

Tasted too much like Velveeta. I think next time I will try it with mostly Cheddar and a little Velveeta for the smoothness.

Tried this after I read all the reviews and just loved it!  It was a hit with hubby, who loves this kind of soup at restaurants, and with my picky three year old.  Served it with warm crescent rolls and it made a nice hot, hearty meal the day we picked out our christmas tree.  I did omit some of the garlic and used more cheese (2 lb brick velveeta), as well as using half and half instead of milk.

This recipe was very good.  My kids LOVE it!!! Keep in mind it makes a HUGE pot of soup!  I have made it several times now, and even got a few of my "picky eater" relatives to eat some and they wanted the recipe right away. I use Chicken broth from a box (Swanson) and just cover the broccoli with enough broth to simmer and it came out just fine.

This was a really great recipe.  I did make the modifications suggested in the most helpful review.  I also added some pre-shredded sharp cheddar because we're a cheese loving family.  A great soup for a winter day.

I had never made soup before finding this recipe. I work in commercial kitchens and it fell on me to make a broccoli and cheese soup. While the first batch was a little thicker then what was desired I followed the recipe again and used less cornstarch. I also added in different seasonings (ground black pepper, onion powder, Italian seasonings) and used half and half the bases of this recipe is a homerun and everyone loves it. So happy I found this recipe. I will be using it in the future and feel more confident about making soups.

This soup was absolutely superb! My mother made one evening, and we fell in love. She used fresh broccoli instead of the frozen broccoli, which increased the  cooking time a bit. We love extra sharp cheddar cheese, so she used the shredded kind. She also added a little more half-and-half in the recipe. This soup was perfect during the most brutal of winter nights. It was by far phenomenal!

Absolutely awful. The cheese didn't melt for me, and I didn't have corn starch so I tried flour. I then blended it but it was horrible. Won't attempt again

I added a box of mushrooms (pureed), 4 cloves of garlic, only four of the smaller Pacific chicken broths, and would add more broccoli next time.  I would also consider using vegetable broth next time. Delicious!

Very good soup. I suggest heavy cream or half and half in place of milk. Unless you prefer your soup thinner. Then, milk is fine. If you're a cheese lover, like myself, add some extra cheese. You won't regret it. I use chicken broth instead of water for a little extra flavor boost. I have this twice a week (leftovers the second time), as it is just as good heated up. Some times I add potatoes  (Russetts or Yukon Gold).

We all loved and devoured it! I diced one whole onion, and three cloves of garlic and added that to saute with the butter. Instead of frozen broccoli, I used two large heads of fresh broccoli. After the broccoli was done simmering, I threw about half of it and the liquid in the blender with three TSP's of flax seed ( in lieu of the corn starch). Then We added that back to the pot along with fresh cheddar cheese - 5 cups shredded. Instead of milk I used 1/2 C. half and half and the rest heavy whipping cream. I served it in bread bowls and it was absolutely fabulous!!!!

Easy and very good.  I ended up using 2 lbs of frozen broccoli because we love broccoli and that's what I had in the freezer. I used an emersion blender and blended in the first pound after it softened then added the second pound and let it soften in the soup.  When it was done I served it with shredded cheese on top.  This is the best broccoli cheddar soup I have ever had.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Amazing !!!  I made it exactly as recipe stated and it was perfect and thick and rich. The flavor is amazing. It makes a big batch. The only thing I did extra was use a hand blender on it at the stage just before adding the velveeta. Perfect !!!

Too much liquid. I halved the liquid and there is still too little broccoli in proportion.  I used cheddar cheese but it was still lacking flavor. It needs parmesan or some other highly flavored cheese. I ended up putting grated cheese on top of each cup of soup and adding a pat of butter.  The onions should be more than wilted and somewhat carmelized for more flavor.  I now have a giant pot of soup with not enough flavor. Find a different recipe!!

VERY good. I added a little more broccoli but otherwise followed the recipe.  The only thing - I feel like it's missing something. Not sure what just yet. Other than that, it turned out perfectly and will definitely make this again!

Really Really good! It was a bit of work but worth the effort. I did double the broccoli. Wish someone would figure out the nutritional info. I won't be eating it (making it for a friend) because I'm doing weight watchers. Thinking of making some adjustments to lower the 'points'.  I'm sure it's high! but oh so good.

Sauté fresh chopped garlic with yellow onion in butter or 1 Tbsp evoo. Add salt and pepper to taste. When the onion is caramelized, add the cornstarch water mixture and thicken into a rue. Add broccoli now. Gradually (slowly!) add chicken stock and milk so that it is creamy soup texture. Heat until broccoli is tender and add 1 lb shredded cheddar Jack. The cheese will melt evenly into your soup, then serve! For another kicked up veggie version, add shredded carrot and celery with your onions, and fresh corn with your broccoli.

I LOVE the Broccoli Cheese Soup at Uno's.  This is very close or better. I made it as directed EXCEPT for the frozen broccoli. I didn't have it. So I used fresh (about 1 good sized stalk chopped.) Then I cooked it with the onions in the butter. Easy and fast!

Simply delicious! Broccoli breaks up if you whisk it but I thought it helped to distribute broccoli flavor more evenly through soup since the mbroccoli does tend to sink. Keep stirring it'll thicken but be patient it does take some time. I made this with the italian bread bowls. Wonderful!

5 stars after a few changes, but a great starter recipe!! 

Most of my changes were only because of what I had on hand.  I had a bunch of homemade turkey broth after Thanksgiving so instead of the cans of chicken broth I used my turkey broth.  I did not have cornstarch or even normal flour so I used a whole wheat flour.  And I mixed up reading the water and milk and added one cup of milk and no water but without the cornstarch I think that it was fine.

After the soup was done, I thought it still lacked flavor so I added some pre-cooked bacon strips cut into little pieces and some smoked provolone cheese and a handful of regular cheddar.  And salt.  After these changes it was perfect.  The kids ate it right up, they loved it.  

I think if I would have used canned broth the soup would have been more flavorful than my homemade turkey broth, so that was probably part of it. But being a cheese lover I think in the future I will experiment with some other cheeses as well.  I think the smoked provolone and bacon really added a good flavor to this soup.

Flavor is good but it definitely is too thin for my tastes.  I stuck to the recipe except for when I had to deviate.  I used fresh broccoli (what I had) and used 2 stalks chopped which equaled 4 cups.  Next time, I would add more.  I also only used 1/3 cup of corn starch because that was all I had.  I tried to make up for this by not diluting in water.  So some of the thinness is due to that.  I will cut down on the chicken broth next time to see if that helps and maybe do half processed and half cheddar combination.  Still, good flavor and now I can adjust to my tastes.

First time I've ever made broccoli and cheese soup..Very good! Ended up using the white wine with butter to saute the onion in so I used one less can of chicken broth, doubled the broccoli, added 8 oz cream cheese as someone else suggested, left the water out and dissolved a tablespoon of cornstarch in 1/3 of the cup of milk. End result it wasn't crazy thick (didn't want it to be) and was perfect. I did not double the cheese, but with the cream cheese it was plenty cheesy. This makes a huge pot. Freezing half for an easy meal this weekend. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

The recipe was great but the one thing I think I would change differently is the cheese. For all the cheese it said to use I did 1/2 of the cheese sharp cheddar, 1/4 mild cheddar, and 1/4 Colby jack. I also recommend you melt the cheese separately and then add the melted cheese to the soup (I didn't and all of the cheese stuck together when I didn't melt it first). Besides that I loved the recipe and will definitely make this again soon.

We absolutely loved this! The only thing I did different was to blend the soup at the last minute. Leaving it a tad chunky. Don't change a thing with the ingredients! The cornstarch is a perfect.

Excellent! Full respect for the recipe as written. I had no idea how to start making a great broccoli cheese soup that I so wanted to. I used some others's little tweaks (thank you) out of necessity or personal preferences, but the basics are all here. Love it!

This was simply perfect. We enjoyed every bite. We did make a few changes. We used 3 cloves of freshly chopped garlic instead of the garlic powder, used a bit extra cheese, and instead of water with the cornstarch we used chicken broth. We also added in shredded chicken from a leftover roast. We topped it off with bacon bits. We put the leftovers in containers and put them in the freezer for an easy meal in the future.

Great recipe, turned out perfect.  I made it as is, with whole milk!, and puréed the broccoli in a blender. Tweaking is fine to suit your individual tastes but not necessary.

4.5 stars -- a really great soup, once you double the broccoli (or even triple, if you really like broccoli) and nearly double the cheese. As other reviewers suggested, using fresh broccoli also makes a huge difference in texture, flavor and color.

I only change a few things, 1 extra bag of Broccoli that I 
chopped up in my food processor & added near the end.I also used chicken
bouillon powder ( 7 cups) & 1 cup of water for the chicken stock.
to thicken I just added a 1/2 cup of flour to the butter & onions and made a 
rue then whisked in the chicken stock slowly. Worked great.(Tip)... cut cheese into 1/4 inch cubes so it will melt quicker and stir because the cheese wants to stick to the bottom of the pan. Great flavor!

Used the hand blender for broccoli, should use it on the onions as well.  Use a pot to saute onions, because you need to add the milk and cheese.

Spectacular!  Mom said it's the best she ever ate.  The only changes I made based on reading reviews was I doubled the broccoli, used 1.5lbs of Velveta and sautéed my chopped onion in butter and white wine and added crumbled bacon.  This soup is rich and creamy.  Definitely restaurant quality and at the top of my list!

I lost my old recipe for broccoli cheese soup, so I thought I would try this. I followed it pretty closely except I didnt use as much butter. I also added 1/2 cup to the 2 cups of milk, little bit more than a pound of the velveeta, and sprinkled only a bit of garlic powder into the milk. It turned out amazing. It was so thick. I will definitely be making this more often, and freezing the leftovers. My boyfriend usually waits forever to eat his dinner, and today he practically slurped the broccoli cheese soup, along with seconds.

I made this soup on a whim and was very pleased!  My neighbor shared her broccoli cheese soup recipe, but it called for too many ingredients, so I gave this one a try.  I also substituted all-purpose flour for the cornstarch and it worked fine.  So yummy on a chilly day!

Everyone who tried it loved this soup!  I normally wouldn't rate a recipe after making it with changes, but I really think this soup would have been wonderful as written...my family just loves chunkier soup and extra cheese!  I sautéed fresh garlic with the onion, and omitted the cup of water and just reserved a cup of the broth until the end.  I also used a total of 32 ounces of cheese...3/4 of a large block of velveeta and some sharp cheddar to make up the difference! Used half and half instead of milk just because I had it on hand.  Great base recipe and wonderful taste, thank you Karin!

Very good taste but very thin and runny. It may have been my error of using shredded cheese and not a loaf of processed cheese. It may be a little thicker if you use 3 cans of broth instead of 4. It did taste very good but was more like a drink instead of a soup.

I added a little more broccoli, but other then that stuck to it. It was very yummy. Was missing something, so I added shred sharp to it.

I made a fantastic broccoli cheese soup last year and couldn't find the recipe so I tried this one because I happen to have some Velveeta in the fridge.  I followed the directions almost exactly except that I added garlic and white wine in with the onions.  I am not a huge fan of cornstarch to thicken soups and wish I had made a roux during the onions cooking phase with flour.  The cornstarch gives it a weird consistency.  I thought the final flavor of the soup was almost too sweet due to the Velveeta and I hated the consistency.  But, it was super easy and my husband kind of liked it. Probably wouldn't make it again without several modifications.

It's so delicious. My kids and I love it. Every time I make it, they offer to help and I let them. I've made it (as is) about five times already this past year and always wonder why it takes me a good long while before making it again. The only thing I add is a little bit more broccoli, but nothing else. Even reheated tastes so good. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Oh my gosh this was so good.  I followed suggestions and doubled the cheese and broccoli, using fresh broccoli.  I used 1 lb of processed cheese food and 1 lb of shredded cheddar jack, and substituted half and half for the milk.  We love soups and this has become our new favorite.  Thank you Karen.

Have made several broccoli cheese recipes and finally found one that all 6 six of us liked!  I left out the water and mixed the cornstarch with the last can of broth as suggested and I added some cheddar cheese.  Yum!

OMG!!!! This soup is restaurant quality, very good!!!!.  I had to force myself to stop eating it.  My daughter love it as well.  I did not have the amount of broccoli as the recipe called for, but it was still delicious.  I will make this soup again and again, but I will make sure I have more broccoli on hand.  BTW, I didn't change a thing.

This was very good!  I used fresh, slightly steamed broccoli and subbed in shredded cheddar for half of the cheese.  Did not add quite all the cornstarch, and it turned out thick and yummy!  I think it was restaurant quality.

Awesome recipe! How i cooked it though is eye balling most of the ingredients.  I did not add the water, and I used flour instead of cornstarch.  next time I will cook the onions in white wine and probably add a few mushrooms and carrots.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I will make it for years to come!

Very easy and good. I did cut down on the chicken broth to around 45 oz. and also made a roux with the butter and flour like one of the other reviewers said. I added about a cup of shredded chicken (had on hand) but this would be just as good without.

I doubled the recipe and substituted fresh broccoli for frozen.  It took a bit longer to cook, but it was well worth it.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  Even my 3 year old daughter ate three little kid bowls of it.  I will definitely make this again!

Just made this soup. It is really easy and very good. I did end up adding a little salt and cheddar cheese in my individual bowl but was good without it. I would recommend any that likes broccoli and cheese (and who doesn't?) to try this soup.

Fantastic ! I did a few minor adjustments. I added more cheese, I use heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and I also added shredded chicken and extrra broccoli for a fuller more meal like dish....

Way too thin for me.  I agree with previous review that it tasted like chicken broth.  Probably won't use again but if I did, would cut way down on chicken broth.  Also, I pureed broccoli with my stick mixer a little to cut down on size of broccoli chunks.  Definitely needs a little more cheese too.

I followed this recipe and made two changes: I only added one cup of milk (not two), and added black pepper.  It was DELICIOUS!  My family loved it and my husband said it was the best broccoli cheese soup he's ever had.  I will definitely make this again.

Just made this recipe and loved it! It took hardly anytime at all and was extremely easy! The taste is amzing! I added 1/3 of shredded carrots when I put in the broccoli and  it made it look and taste just like the soup you can get at Panera Bread! Love this recipe and will definetly be making it again soon!

This is delicious and so comforting! I followed the directions except  instead of mixing the cornstarch into a cup of water, I mixed it in with the milk. I couldn't see adding extra liquid when trying to get it to thicken up. Worked out perfect. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is super-easy and oh so delicious. Don't have Velveeta? Don't worry, shredded cheddar works fine, too. Make a double batch and freeze it because it freezes well :-)

This was my first time making homemade broccoli cheese soup.  This was really, really, good!  I used some suggested changes, like using half and half instead of milk, adding a few cloves of chopped garlic and reserving 1 cup of broth for the cornstarch instead of water.  After broccoli simmered in the broth, I took it out in batches and processed and put back into the broth before I added the half and half and cheese.  This is a great recipe. Thanks!

This was a good base recipe for broccoli cheese soup. I wanted something similar to the broccoli cheese soup at Panera, so I used 3 crowns of fresh broccoli, and added some shredded carrots. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and added a pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a kick. Also, per the suggestions in some of the reviews I read, I used part milk and part half and half, and about 3/4 lb of processed cheese, and about a cup of sharp cheddar. It tasted very good. It came out a little thin, but that's mostly my fault because I misread the amount of broth needed. I definitely recommend using fresh broccoli, and chopping it into very small pieces.

Excellent recipe!  I did cut it down to 4 servings and used homemade chicken broth.  I also used 1 crown of fresh broccoli, chopped up.  I also used my immersion blender when the broccoli was tender and then added the cheese, etc.   I'd make this again for sure.

This was absolutely delicious soup. I followed the recipe exactly except that I only had about 1/4 lb of processed cheese so I used sharp cheddar. I dont usually like to make changes and then rate the recipe but I really dont  think that it made that much difference and I wanted to be sure to let everyone know that if you like brocolli cheese soup this is a must try. This is a soup that will go onto my rotation for sure. I've tried many brocolli cheese soups and this is by far the best. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a variety of real cheeses instead of velveeta, it was fantastic! I also like that this uses milk instead of cream like most recipes. VERY good!! This is a keeper!

I've made broccoli cheese soup many times, but not always with great results.  I love this recipe.  I added some white wine to the onions while they were cooking as the author suggests. I took out some of the broccoli and put it in the blender and then put it back to the pot. Also, I used 1/2 cheese food (cut into small pieces) and then the other 1/2 medium cheddar and sharp cheddar shredded.  I added the cheese food to the broth/broccoli mix and once it was melted, I added the milk and when the milk was hot enough, I added the shredded cheeses.  The end result was a creamy, cheesy base.

Wow! Yum! I halved the recipe since it was only for 2 people. I had my 9 yo daughter doing a happy dance as she was eating it! I doubled the broccoli and cheese like others suggested, added half a cup of white wine, and 2 cloves of garlic. I also used half and half instead of milk, and a dash of cayenne at the end to give it a little kick. I used the food processor to blend it up because I wanted it smoother. A definite winner!

On of my favorite soups.  This recipe was easy, quick and wonderful! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the broccoli and brick cheese.  I used a lb of the traditional brick and a lb of the new White Queso brick the second time, I will definitely look for the White Queso the next time I make it.  Also makes a lot!  Started to half the second time, but got carried away :-) Will half the next time even though my daughter finished off the extra and licked the bowl!

OK, I didn't make it with the exact ingredients. 

Not wanting to add cornstarch, I added 1 small can of condensed milk and enough powdered potato flakes to thicken it, and none of the milk or water called for.  The recipe seemed mighty liquid-y in relation to the solids of chopped leftover broccoli & asparagus that I used. 

I used just a little chicken fat instead of butter to saute the onion.  And used more 2% fat Velveeta than it called for, plus some pepper Jack cheese at the end.  Also added tiny bits of cooked chicken.

Turned out delicious!  Thanks for the basic recipe.

This is one of my husbands new favorite meals... and I'm not complaining because I love it too!  I used fresh everything since I can't get processed where we live overseas.  It freezes fine as well so we make a huge batch once a month and have it about once a week.  Yummmm

Best soup EVER! The only problem I ever have is I normally shred in marble or cheddar cheese and depending on the temperature of the soup it goes stringy instead of melting in. Make sure it's HOT. SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!

3 stars because it could have been my mistake but if it weren't, I would give it 2 stars. The corn starch gave it a gritty texture. Ruined the whole soup.

Very good soup! I made a roux in the beginning with 1/2 c. flour (instead of adding corn starch at the end) and used 2 c. chicken broth and 2 "cans" of milk to make it a little creamier. It turned out wonderful!

This was delish!  I made it exactly as stated, except I subbed chicken base (Das Dutchman Essenhaus brand) for the broth.  I just didn't have enough canned broth.  But, this worked great as I was able to adjust the water as needed.  Everything else, I did as written.  The kiddos even liked it!  Many thanks!

I have attempted numerous times to make Brocolli soup & it always turned out too watery & not as tasty as I've had in restaurants.  This recipe works for me.  Didn't alter one thing but I did add ham cubes.  Great combination!

Super good and super easy. Suggestion: add 1-2 t. white pepper for just a little "kick". I made a half batch and added 2 chicken breasts to make it heartier. Oven roasted them with EVOO, salt and pepper only. Cut in small cubes & added after the cheese melted. We'll defintely have this one often. Already shared this one with family members!

Very good homemade version of broccoli cheese though I will agree with the other reviews that it is much too salty with four cans of chicken broth. I also followed the reviews and doubled the broccoli and cheese.

This was excellent!  Could not get over the flavor since it is such a simple recipe.  Used flour instead of cornstarch (ran out) but still awesome.  Followed recipe and was great.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover mashed potatoes and broccoli so I used this.  So I substituted my leftovers and a handful of baby carrots that I shredded in the food processor for the bag of broccoli. I used my emulsion blender to make it smooth, mixed cornstarch with a cup of the soup rather than water.  It was excellent, the best soup I ever made!!!!

Hello. My first review. Pretty good soup. I added a few things. 1st- I added green peppers chopped fine to add crunch to the mush broccoli (which is fine). I added a Veg. Cube of Bullion to add to the veggie flavor. About 1/4 cup of Sauerkraut to add consistency, and lots of chopped bacon for color. Also added 1/4 cubed pepper jack cheese for extra flavor. Wife loved it! Oh, and used WAY less cornstarch,3 tbls.

I sort of improvised by what I had on hand. I didn't have a lot of broccoli so I added some carrot and potato. I only had half a thing of Velveeta so i added some of that jar cheese with the salsa it. Turned out awesome!

This was my first try at making Broccoli Cheese soup, and I liked this recipe. I agree with the other reviewers that you need to at least double the broccoli.  I did think the soup was pretty thin, but instead of doubling the cheese, as many people recommended, I think it just needs one less can of chicken broth. I did as another reviewer said and added 1/2 cup of cornstarch to half a can of the chicken broth at the end. I also used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk, 2% Velveeta, about 1 1/2 lbs (3/4 of the 'loaf'), and low sodium chicken broth. My daughter is a huge fan of Panera's broccoli cheese soup and she thought this was pretty close. I will try this again.

It's impossible to find an easier soup recipe that tastes this good. Sure it's fattening and processed. But once in a while that's ok - especially when you're busy and have a potluck to attend. Great soup!

Burn your mouth worthy!! YUM! I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and added some extra sharp Wisconsin cheddar to give it some nice flavor. Also, salt and pepper, of course. Otherwise, don't change anything! :)

Delicious!  I used fresh broccoli and grated cheddar, instead, and I added a dash of cayenne pepper for just a bit of spice.  A perfect hot lunch for a winter day, or a little supper.

L-O-V-E-D it !!  Even better the kids loved it.

I tend to like my soups a little thick so I added instant potatoes to thicken this recipe up.

We also served it in bread bowls and it was a hit !!

So quick and easy.  Thank you, Karen for sharing it.

This soup is nothing short of amazing! The only change I made was to add an extra package of broccoli and I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half and half(only because I didn't have enough milk). Thanks for the yummy recipe!!

I realized that I needed 2 make dinner quickly and took what I had on hand, which was basically everything in this recipe. I used fresh garlic & sauteed with the onion. Came out perfect. If yours comes out too liquidy, add more corn starch and you will be fine. Also, I had American Cheese slices- so I used that. It tasted similar to the broccoli cheddar soup fr Panera Bread. Im happy I accidentally found this and from now on this is the recipe I will use.

my husband is a broccoli cheese soup snob.. and he loved this recipe. I did use half and half instead of milk and I used a cup of milk instead of water to mix with the cornstarch. after adding half and half and before cornstarch, I did put in 4 cut up cooked potatos to make it a little more filling for the men in the family

Wonderful-my kids and family loved it. I had a bunch of extra broccoli so I steamed it and pureed it with some broth and added as a thickener instead of any cornstarch-delicious!

This soup is AMAZING!!!  Instead of garlic powder, I minced up 2 garlic cloves and added to the sauteed onions. Didn't have any cornstarch, so instead I chopped up a medium russet potato, added that to the sauteed onion and garlic along with the chicken stock and cooked for 10 min. Then added the frozen broccoli (used 1 1/2 bags of frozen florets).Also didn't have processed cheese, so used 1 lb of sharp cheddar.  Basically, this soup recipe is very forgiving!  The flavors were amazing. And my family loved it!  This is our go-to recipe for the winter months!!

This was an enormous hit in my house!! I made a batch and it was gone in a heartbeat- second time around, made a double batch and I doubt that one will last long either! Definitely a keeper!

I used Velveeta cheese, Organic Skim Milk, and Earth Balance butter. This turned out amazing and I will definitely be making it again! The onions and garlic made a big difference in bringing out the flavor of the soup.

Fantastic!  Doubled cheese and broccoli, but left all the rest! Made a HUGE pot of soup, great for lunch next day. I also added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg as someone else suggested.

My whole family loved this recipe! I followed (mostly) the suggestions of the two most helpful reviews. I did NOT decrease the butter. I think the original amount of butter is just right. I also added carrots as my family LOVES carrots and it was very tasty! Only suggestion is if you add carrots you will need to simmer the veggies for about 30 min instead of 15 since carrots take longer to cook through. I also used all sharp cheddar and no processed cheese. Turned out awesome.

At first I made it as is.  There wasn't enough flavor although the consistency was excellent.  I added some sharp cheddar cheese, sliced carrots, salt and a little more milk because of the extra cheese.

Very good simple recipe. I've never used corn starch before and it was very cool to see how effective it was for this soup. I wasn't sure which cheese to use so I bought mild cheddar. My picky eaters loved it!

this rating is totally my fault. I threw all ingredients in a crock pot thinking that it would simmer well, and it did not, I took one bite and threw the rest out. If I try again I am going to go by the recipe.

I made this for the first time last night, I had people over and everyone loved it. However, it does call for a lot of butter cooked with the onions (1/2cup) and I think next time I will try it with less butter, to save on the calories. Other than that, this was a DEFINITE keeper!

I LOVE this recipe. I made this for both myself and my boyfriend one day instead of going to Panera Bread. It tastes GREAT! The only thing I suggest is adding a bit more Cornstarch... it came out a little runny with he original ingredients. I cant tell you how much I added because I just added little increments of a tablespoon at a time and waited while stirring to see how thick it got. Other than that please try the recipe if you like broccoli cheese soup from the restaurant, it definitely tastes the same!

Great easy recipe...modified it to 6 servings, used fresh grated cheese, fresh chopped garlic (not the powder) and cut down the cornstarch a bit. Tastes great, would make again!

Great Recipe. My husband loved it. He said it was better than Chili's and Jason's Deli. I made 1 1/2 of the recipe to be able to share with my daughter and her family and my neighbor. I change the recipe a little. To make more servings, I added 6 cans of chicken broth and 1 16oz package of chopped broccoli and 1 16oz package of broccoli florets. I used 2 1/4 lbs of velveeta cheese cut into small cubes, 1 cup cheddar cheese shredded and 3  slices of american cheese torn into pieces. I did not use water, I only used 1 1/4 cup of milk and use both flour and cornstarch to get it to the right thickness. I will definitely make this one over the cold winter days.

This turned out almost exactly like my favorite restaurant's! I did a couple substitutes but no major changes. I sauteed minced garlic with the onion and omitted garlic powder, used four packets of chicken bouillon and four cups water in place of the chicken broth, used frozen broccoli cuts instead of chopped and let it simmer until tender enough to break apart, and instead of mixing the cornstarch with water i mixed it with the second cup of milk. Turned out perfect and just the right viscosity.

This is really good. I agree with the others in that I'd recommend more broccoli, but strangely I thought the cheese was about right (which is strange because I love cheese)... anyway, I'd definitely recommend this recipe, so yummy and perfect for those stormy cold days!

I still need to thicken this, but after tasting it I had to write my review. This is SO fantastic. I will never make a different broccoli cheese soup. I used fresh broccoli, and only 4 cups of chicken broth. I can not say enough good things about this one!

Good! Pretty easy, I only added 24 oz of chicken stock (it was all I had!) plus one can of condensed cream of chicken soup and one can of water. Also didn't add the cornstarch at the end, and I used my immersion blender to puree the broccoli, which thickened it naturally.

Very good. Easy. Beware though, it takes a large pot. I used a 3.5 qt. pot and it ended up being too small. I only had a half sweet onion. This was my first attempt ever at broccoli cheese soup, and I had trouble getting this to thicken though after adding additional cornstarch slurry so we just ate it because we were tired of waiting. It did thicken slightly upon cooling but still not like I expected it too. The hubs declared this better than his favorite from the Deli so that is all I need to make this a winner for me. Thanks!

Great soup. My family loved it.  I think the recipe calls for too much cheese, next time I will use cheddar intead of processed. My changes; I used fresh broccoli (3 large heads). I did not use chicken broth, instead used a little water (since we were abstaining from meat and meat products during lent). I used half and half. I slightly blended most of the broccoli and onions and left about a fourth of it as it was for some consistency. It was great. I will make this recipe again.

Great recipe.  I used frozen broccoli, but a little more than it called for.  Didn't have corn starch so I thickened it using a rue (added at the same time the corn starch would have been) and I used shredded cheddar cheese-not sure how much, but it was a healthy dose!  I will definitely be making this again!

My kids loved this-which says alot! I will make this again, but next time I will add more broccoli and a little less cheese, it was a little overpowering. I also used 2 cloves of garlic which is the way to go.

This recipe was outstanding. I have 3 boys who are picky eaters and they kept asking for more! I did a few minor adjustments: I used half and half instead of milk and melted the cheese into the half and half before adding to the broccoli/chicken broth. I also cut down on the amount of water used for dissolving the corn starch by half.

My wife loves Broccoli Cheese soup but this is the first time I've made it for her.  She absolutely loooooved it!  Said it was the best she's ever had.  I thought it was great but didn't say anything as I didn't want to influence her.

The only modification I made was to add 1/4 cup of marsala wine.  Someone suggested substituting one cup white wine for one cup of water, but I didn't have any so, like many cooks, I improvised.  Didn't want to overdo the sweetness so I put the smaller amount in.  This recipe is something I would be excited to prepare for family or guests.

It was a phenomenal soup!! The cheese accidentally curdled, and so in the end we pureed it. Delicious! For vegetarians, you can make 6 cups of vegetable bullion instead of the chicken broth. This is a wonderful soup, and has definitely made it into my recipe book! :)

Great soup.  I did add salt & pepper (particularly necessary if you use unsalted butter).  Also used reduced-fat cheese - turned out great.

I have been making this soup for years. The only thing I change on this recipe is that I use minced garlic not power. I use a crock pot, so to start I saute the garlic. After about 1 minute I add onion and the broccoli. After the onion and garlic are cooked I transfer to a crock pot where I add everything else (in the order of the recipe). My kids eat this and they hate broccoli. Great job Karin!!

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious! Highly recommend this to anyone who is feeling like a great bowl of soup. 
When I made this soup for my family and friends I actually tweaked it a bit. Of course we are cheese addicts in our house, so I used about double the cheese and it was not too much. I also added 1-2 small cans of diced potatoes at the tail end of the simmering of the broccoli! Yummy Yummy!!!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, and my whole family enjoyed it. I only changed a couple of things - used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and used more corn starch to thicken it up more. Very good soup that makes a LOT, so if you're wanting to feed a bunch of people this would be a good recipe to use. However, if you're only making for a few people I would probably make less because I didn't think the soup tasted nearly as good the second time around. I thought reheating the processed cheese might have been the reason for it not reheating well. This is a great broccoli cheese soup and we will be making again. Thanks for the recipe, Karin!

Loved this recipe, I only made a few changes do to what I had on hand.  I used real shredded cheddar, and used cream instead of milk.  It was very high cal. but loved every bite.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it over and over.

Awesome!!  The only way my kids will eat broccoli and it is so good..I did use some of the "tweeks" that were made by the other people who used this recipe.  Tweeks I used was the 2lbs of broccole and the 2 lbs of velveeta which to me made the soup!! I also used boullion cubes instead of can broth just because thats what i had available and it turned out sooo good.  thank you for sharing

I just made this soup, only change I made was I did not have canned stock, so I used water and boullions.  I have to say this is a excellent recipe, I have tried many and altho they were good, were not  nearly as much flavor as in this recipe.  Very very good.

My first recipe from this site and it did not dissapoint! i made it for my husband and our staff at our motorcycle shop and all the boys loved it!  I pureed 3 good sized potatos, and a bag of frozen broccili and added to the mix and i also added an extra half a pound of velveeta because cheese is the best thing ever, next to butter.

I did as the others suggested and used double cheese (using sharp cheddar and velvetta) and double brocolli because I blended half of it, and used half and half instead of milk...even my picking people ate it up and wanted more!  Will keep this recipe for later use.

This is a great broccoli cheese soup recipe. It is very rich with a lot of flavor and is ready in a pinch. I always order this soup at Quizno's or Panera Bread and now I can make it at home anytime!

I've made this twice now, and it's delicious and easy!  I like to double the broccoli and the cheese.

I followed some of the suggestions from previous reviews (used 2lb each broccoli & cheese, and instead of mixing the cornstarch w/ water I reserved the 4th can of broth for that step), and it turned out FABULOUS!  My husband, who cannot stand cooked broccoli (and even griped about the broccoli smell as it cooked), went back for thirds!  Definitely a keeper!  I might try it w/ ham & potatoes instead of the broccoli sometime, as I suspect the base would work well for a potato cheese soup as well.

This recipe was great! I used half and half instead of milk, real minced garlic, 2 pounds of Velveta, and 2 pounds of broccoli florets instead of the recommended amounts. I also followed the directions of another review and poured 3 cans of the broth over the broccoli and mixed the last can with water at the end. It was a little watery this way, so I thickened with flour.  (I didn't have cornstarch on hand) It turned out great! Next time I will try it with the cornstarch though.

Very good soup! The only thing I changed was that I added some pepper jack cheese to the soup to give it a little bit of a "bite"! Sooo good!!

Great starter recipe. I went without the onions, half and half instead of milk, shredded cheddar cheese (not processed cubes), and used 2 cans cream of broccoli soup to add flavor.

This soup is wonderful!  I use fresh broccoli and add some chopped carrots as well.  If made as the recipe states, the soup is more soupy.  My family likes it thicker with more substance to it so I add more broccoli and the carrots.  Overall, very delicious!

I found the soup to be a little thin, but once i thickened it with flour it was wonderful! The cornstarch isn't enough so if you like your soup thick you need to mix in flour at the end. Don't worry about being able to taste the flour, the cheese covers the taste just fine!

Great Soup, my 14 year old is learning to cook and she picked this as one of her weekly dinners. Easy to follow directions and tasty too. She added freshly grated cheese and pepper. Served with warm french bread.

This soup was absolutely phenomenal! I have been using Allrecipes for several months, and I have found many recipes that were very good, but this is the first review I have made. I made it today as a starter for a Sweetest Day meal with my boyfriend, and he was simply blown away. All through dinner, he commented on how it was the best soup he had ever tasted. I read most of the reviews on here, and I did tweak a few things when I made it. I doubled the cheese and broccoli, and I added a clove of garlic to the onions when I cooked them in butter. It was sooo easy, and definitely a soup that will become a staple at my home. Thanks for the recipe, Karin!

This soup turned out delicious!  Absolutely perfect to pair with the extra bread bowls I had.  I halved the recipe and it made plenty for my college lifestyle.  I didn't have any cornstarch so I just replaced it with double the amount of flour, and although I had to cook it a lot longer to get the flour well incorporated, it turned out great!

The only change we made was to puree the broccoli after it simmered and before we added the cheese.  Very good!

Very good soup. I used beef broth instead of chicken (it's what I had here), added an 8 ounce block of mild cheddar cheese in addition to the Velveeta, and I also threw in two diced potatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I would change next time is to cut back just a tad on the garlic powder and the cornstarch. It was a bit too thick for my taste. But overall, we enjoyed it very much. Definitely a keeper.

This is better then the broccoli cheese soup you get in most restaurants!!  I made it for my daughters college soccer team's post game lunch and it was a huge hit! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and I did puree a little more then half of the broccoli in about half of the broth in a blender after is was cooked and added shredded carrots.

Absolutely amazing. Very flavorful. One of those dishes you can't stop tasting while you are cooking it! I ate three small bowls as soon as it was finished. My family has always been a fan of McDonald's broccoli cheese soup adn this tops it by far. I did use 2 fresh heads of broccoli instead of frozen. Will def. make again.

This soup was great. I followed the recipe exactly as it's presented. The texture and richness was so perfect. It was thick, but not overly so. Cheesy, but not overly so. Just perfect and my family loved it and were amazed. When people see how beautiful it turns out they think you're a master chef for being able to make this from scratch. However, it's one of the simplest and cheapest recipes I've made so far.

This is a delicious soup. . .I subtracted 1 star for all of the cornstarch, I wanted soup, not pudding!  I used just 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch to thicken very slightly.  It turned out great!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes!  I have been making this for years now and just had to review it.  This is a great platform recipe you can use to create all kinds of great soups from.  I love to add shredded carrots or cauliflower to change things up, too!

Unfortunately I read the reviews AFTER I made the soup.  You definitely have to add another 1 lb package of cheese.  Cut the onion amount to half and be sure it is cooked until clear.  I only cooked mine in butter until soft and it turned out a little too cruchy and 1 whole onion is too much.  Too much crunch in a soup!  Also, definitely use half and half instead of milk.  We used 2% and it made it too watery.    If you have to tweak a recipe too much, it doesn't warrant a 5 star rating.  I was expecting something closer to Black Eyed Peas Broccoli Cheese Soup, but not even close.  Too watery.    If you have to tweak

It didn't even taste like broccoli OR cheese.  It tasted like chicken broth with garlic powder in it.  The reviewers who rate this highly must NOT have ever had a great broccoli cheese soup.  I personally have and will never make this again. I am in hot pursuit of a good recipe.

This was fantastic.  Of course, it may be because I realized that I had accidentally doubled the amount of cheese.  It tasted identical to Jason's Deli which I have always considered the best Broc and Cheese soup ever.  Next time I'll see how it tastes with the RIGHT amount of cheese :)

WOW! Super-easy and very, very yummy! The thing i like is it's versatile. Since I did not have enough broth and a bit more cheese, i tweaked it like many others and it was still wonderful. Even the kids slurped it up! =)

This is really good, I did use half & half instead of milk and stirred it into a can of cream of celery soup, then added to the broccoli cheese soup after I added the cheese, then I mixed the cornstarch with chicken stock instead of water.  Then when serving, I sprinkled with bacon bits, shredded cheddar cheese and a little fresh cut chives.

Really loved this recipe. Even though it is a quick recipe, I didn't go through all the steps. Just brought the broth to a boil, added some chopped frozen broccoli, approximated the amount, and cooked for a bit. Then added the cheese, which I doubled. Stirred till melted. Added heavy whipping cream and the garlic powder. Served to three hungry children (ages three, five and seven) who slurped it up and thanked Mommy for making the best soup ever. I look forward to making this again and again, and hopefully following the full instructions at least once. And I'd like to try different cheese variations. This time I used Velveta as that is what we had on hand.

Absolutely Magnificent! Best Broccoli Cheese Soup I've ever had! The only thing we did differently was we used fresh broccoli and we used less onion and butter.

This is a delicious and easy recipe! It tastes just like broccoli cheese soup from a restaurant - yum! I doubled the cheese and broccoli, replaced the milk with half & half (fat free), and left out the water. Stir the cornstarch into the 4th can of chicken broth instead, and add it in at the end. This is definitely a new favorite meal for my family!

I have been searching for a good broccoli and cheese soup recipe! This is awesome! all three of my boys 15, 11 & 4 love it. It is easy and I make it with 2% velvetta & skim milk. Still use the 1/2 stick of butter but I think you could use a 1/4 cup and still have the same great flavor. I also use one clove of garlic with the onions. It is a great recipe and easy!

This soup was excellent!  I used minced garlic with the onion and after adding the broccoli & broth, I transferred to the blender to get rid of the chunks.  I also added half & half with the milk.  Tasted great & served in bread bowls!!

This soup is delicious!!! Of course, I made a few modifications... I added about 1 1/2 t. of minced garlic to the onions and butter,  I used double the amount of vegetables, and I used the broccoli, cauliflower, carrot mix instead of just broccoli.  I also doubled the cheese; half velveeta and half medium cheddar.  Oh, and one last thing, I dissolved chicken boullion in water instead of using cans of chicken broth.  I will definately be making this again!!!

This soup is Wonderful.  My daughter wanted panera bread soup and I told her I would make it.  I do always read all the reviews before making a recipe on this site and this was no exception.  I did follow others advice with some of my own changes...1/4 c butter was plenty...I bought frozen broccoli in steam pouch and used 2 - 12oz pkg...and did cook them slightly in bag, then removed and chopped finely...with the onion I added fresh garlic and got rid of the garlic pwd... I seperated some of the chicken broth into another pot and melted the cheese in that broth and added it to the main pot.... I used heavy cream, not milk... and  I did add two cups of shredded colby and cheddar at the end.   This soup , I was told, was better than any other chessey broccoli soup out there.

I found this soup to turn out watery...could have been my cornstarch mixture or something.  Flavor was good, however, I added another 1lb of Velveeta and it was much cheesier tasting.  I'll consider making it again if I can figure out why it didn't thicken...

Only giving 4 stars due to cornstarch taste.  I saved a can of broth to mix with the cornstarch as others recommended, but it didn't help.  This soup had great flavor until we added the cornstarch then that's all I could taste.  My 9 year old daughter suggested using some white cheddar that we had and it saved the soup.  I would suggest less cornstarch

Soooooooo good.  I used fresh broccoli and a hand blender to process half the ingredients after the broccoli was cooked.  Used half the processed cheese food and half cheddar cause that is what I had.  Left out the water added the corn starch to a cup of the broth.  Added the cheese when soup was done and stirred until it was all melted.  I will definitely make this one again.  This one is a keeper forr sure.

My brother asked me for an easy broccoli cheese soup recipe that he could surprise his new wife with.  I didn't have one but looked and found this one...which was a major hit!  His wife was not only surprised at the fact that my brother had made soup from scratch, but was blown away at how good it was.  My brother said this was incredibly easy to make even for a novice cook like himself.

This soup turned out better than expected!  I was a bit nervous about it tasting like milk and cheese, but was pleasantly surprised.  I did blend it together with a hand mixer at the end so there were no broccoli chunks.  It made a nice creamy soup.  I will try "real" cheese next time though, just for the health factor.

2-3 cans chicken broth only.  Also I did 3 C. milk.  Shredded cheese, not processed.  Fresh broccoli, not frozen (steamed first) then it was really good.  I recommend these changes.  Perhaps a little less garlic.

Soup was really good- would have been 5 stars if it didn't have to be "tweaked" as much. I also used 4th can of broth to mix with cornstarch instead of water. Also added some grated "real" cheese rather than adding any more processed cheese. Very good- served with buttermilk biscuits!

Amazing! It makes a huge batch, so plenty of warm goodness for later. I used half&half instead of milk and 2 pounds of cheese and 24 ounces of broccoli. Everything else I kept the same, and it turned out perfect. Thank you for this great recipe.

To make this recipe more low fat, i omitted the butter and boiled the onion and celery with chicken bouillon/broth. I blended half of the broccoli mixture before adding the milk. Also used 2 T cornstarch to thicken and added butter buds along with the garlic salt. Had some roasted chicken leftover from the wkend so diced a few Tblsp of that. Good basic recipe to make your own.

My family really liked this soup, it wasn't "too cheesy" like some of them can be. I think it's because we only used 1 lb. of processed cheese and about a half cup more of shredded cheddar to melt in. I took the advice of others and used 3 cans of chicken broth in the soup and 1 cup broth to mix with the starch. I also doubled the Broccoli and I think it could have used even more! Great winter soup!

This was perfect and delicious!  Exactly the broccoli and cheese soup recipe I was looking for!  I've never worked with Velveeta/processed cheese loaf before, so I was a bit apprehensive about this recipe, but I'm glad I tried it.  5 stars.

This is an AWESOME recipe! This was the first time I made this soup, it was very easy. I added a little cornstarch because needed to be thicker. I also added carrots.

This was probably the best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had.  I tweaked the recipe a bit- I used 1/2 the butter, double the broccoli, cheddar cheese rather than processed and saved the last can of chicken broth to mix with the cornstarch(per someone elses comment)  Me and my husband loved it!

Ok... So I worked at a restaraunt that served the BEST broccoli cheese soup. And I have been searching for a recipe that is close enough. This one definitely wins! Although, the first time I made this, the garlic seemed to overpower it. (And I'm a garlic lover). So the next time I doubled the broccoli and added 1/2 pound extra cheese, and still used only 1 tsp garlic powder and it was PERFECT! I could eat this everyday! Thanks :]

This was my first time making any broccoli cheese soup and I was nervous for some reason. Turned out quite qood and here's my variations: Used 28 oz. brocolli, when cooked to tender in the broth put all the brocolli and a cup or so of broth in the blender and pulsed it to chop it up quite a bit then added back to broth in pan, used 1c. fat-free milk, 1c. 1/2 n 1/2, 3/4lb. Velveeta (will use full pound next time), 2c. shredded cheese mix (added the shredded cheese after the milk), onion powder instead of fresh. Even my nephew who doesn't usually appreciate brocolli LOVED this soup. Score!

It tasted very artifical.  I had not used a Velveta type cheese before, and I really didn't care for it.  Too much cornstarch, it was way too thick. I'll look for another recipe that uses fresher ingredients

This soup was wonderful!  I followed the recipe with the following modifications: I did add some wine to the onions as I was sauteeing (used Smart Balance 50/50 instead of regular butter) and sauteed about 1 tbs of minced garlic along with the onions. I used a 48 oz box of Lower Sodium Chicken Broth to simmer the broccoli.  After the broccoli was tender, I pureed about 2/3 of it in the blender.  I added 8 oz of shredded monterey jack cheese to the 1lb of Velveeta and I used the 2% lower fat Velveeta.  I added 1/4 cup of cornstarch to 2 cups of half-n-half instead of using water.  Allowed it to thicken.  It was awesome!  I think the wine and the add jack cheese really made a difference in the flavor, and it was just the right consistency with the 1/4 cup of cornstarch and the amount of liquid I used.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor of this was really good, but according to the recipe you can get away without pureeing/blending this soup and I really think it would have been better had I done that.  I used cheddar & mozzarella cheese that I shredded and it was really good!

I'm giving this 4 stars based on my alterations of the recipe. I used half the amounts called for of the chicken broth and milk and left out the water completely. This was the perfect consistency for me. Not too thick but not too thin. I also used a hand blender to puree after the broccoli was cooked and only put a few sprinkles of corn starch in (I mixed it with some of the milk before pouring in). Then I "souped" it up with some seasonings like a pinch of nutmeg, black pepper, celery salt, sea salt, Tabasco and the like. I really just tasted and seasoned and so on until it I felt it was properly seasoned. I also cooked it quite a bit longer, while stirring, then turned off the heat and let it sit for a while to thicken before serving in sourdough bread bowls. It was absolutely delicious.

So, so good!  I'm an awful cook, but I wanted to do my part at a Christmas Eve party with my son's God-Family by bringing a soup.  They were all skeptical of course, and we were shocked that it tasted amazing.  Everyone loved it.  Very easy!

Made this at TxGvg for my sister and her 4 kids (1 is a vegetarian) and it was a HUGE success! Have since made it almost weekly 'cuz it's a "quick, cheap and easy" lunch option for me. Followed other suggestions - doubled the broccoli, added 1/2 lb cheddar jack cheese and reduced cornstarch 'cuz the soup is so thick to begin with...LOVE this stuff!

I don't know what I was thinking when I made this recipe.  I read the reviews and saw that people compared this to Chili's soup which I don't think is very good, and I made it anyway.  I saw that it called for alot of corn starch and I made it anyway.  I also saw that people said it wasn't thick enough and I should have known it wasn't because it needed more cheese but that they weren't bringing their soup to a boil after adding the cornstarch.    I should not have made this soup.  :(

EXCELLENT!!! My boyfriend said it's better than anything you can get in a restaurant, which I agree with. Was told it could use some pepper though. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and half-and-half instead of milk. Awesome recipe, thanks!

It came out alright.  I think the Chicken Broth made it too watery, as I traditionally like thicker broccoli cheese.  Nothing to write home about, but still a great base soup if you're bored and looking for something to warm you up in the winter.  (PS - I used way too much Garlic Powder, be careful it can ruin the recipe.)

Awesome soup! Thank you for sharing. 

Since I didn't have time to research the other reviews, I ended up making some changes on my own - since my family tries to lower sodium content, and fat.

So omit the butter and instead use 1 Tb vegetable oil instead. Instead of the 4 cans chicken broth, I used one box of low sodium chicken broth. And for a little extra zip - a requirement in our home - I used the Velveeta Pepper Jack 1 lb loaf. Instead of 2 cups whole milk,I used 1 cup 1% milk, and 1 cup 2% milk and omitted the cornstarch and water.

I thought this recipe was awesome!  I did add 1 and a 1/2 bags of the broccoli florets and I did double the cheese. I also added about 1/4 cup shredded carrots.  I thought this soup tasted just like panera bread's soup.  I think the texture is fine and is how soup is supposed to be, not too thick.

This is an amazing recipe!  I've had it exactly as written and also tonight I made some alterations.  Everybody's taste is different lol.  Still yet I did not vary to far from the original.  Like many others I doubled the cheese, and added garlic in with my onion.  I used 2-32oz boxes of broth instead of 4 cans, and 4-16oz bags of frozen broccoli.  We love broccoli lol.  I do not have an immersion blender *wish I did* so once all was mixed and heated I blended half of the soup.  DELISH!!!!!!! I love it

This soup is fabulous!  It's easy to make and tastes great.  It's just as good as Panera Bread's version if not better.

This was incredibly good and easy to make. Used suggestions from other reviews, doubled broccoli and cheese. Omitted water and added corn starch to the 4th can of broth. Thickened up nicely, tastes great!!

Absolutely fabulous!  I wish I had some containers so I could save some of this goodness for the cold winter that is upon us.

I only added 3 cans of broth. I mixed the corn starch with the 4th can. I used my emulsion blender on this as well. My husband thinks I'm the best cook in the world- thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I did take advice of some other reviewers and doubled both the cheese and the broccoli.  I also added a couple shakes of white pepper.  Enjoyed by all, and will make again for sure.

Great recipe!!  Easy to follow, and delicious!!  The only thing I did different was used fresh broccoli because there was so much at my local farmers market. I also uses a tsp of minced garlic because I didnt have garlic powder at the time!  It was so good!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This soup is excellent!!! So yummy, this is exactly what I was looking for when searching for a replacement for the soup I used to get at Sizzler's. After surgery and radiation to the mouth, my husband loved this yummy soup, we even blended it to make it extra smooth. I have made it just as the recipe directs, and have also added an extra package of broccoli for extra veggies. Great both ways!!! This is a keeper!!!

This recipe was really fantastic!  It was gone in a day and it makes a HUGE pot!  Definitely add 2 lbs of Velvetta and twice as much broccoli.  To simplify, I used 2 bags of the steam in bag broccoli and just added the broccoli to the onion mixture.  I also used 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk like some other users suggested.  I didn't have any canned bullion, so I just prepared 5 cups bullion with the cubes I had.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of the powder. Amazingly awesome stuff.  If you like the Broccoli Cheese soup at Chili's, you're really gonna like this recipe.  Marvelous!  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good stuff.  My husband really liked it.  I used two heads of fresh broccoli instead of frozen, chopped.  I used 1-2 tsp fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder because I didn't have it.  I added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese at the end, 4 dashes of tobasco, and chopped cooked chicken.  My husband suggested chopped bacon, I think I'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh So Yummy! I'm SO GLAD I read the reviews first. I used two cans of chicken broth, 1 lb. frozen broccoli, 3/4 lb. velveeta, and a cup of shredded mild cheddar. Also, I mixed chicken broth with the cornstarch instead of water. My husband loved it too but said I could go a little easier on the cheese next time. Thanks so much!

Halfed it, kept the broccoli and cheese the same used 1/2c milk and 1/2c heavy cream and didn't use any water.  YUMMY, I'LL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN VERY SOON.

Made again using fresh broccoli fat free half and half and 32 oz of water w/ 4 heaping tsp of ckn broth granules.  Wasn't as thick as last time though but still REALLY GOOD.  I'll try adding potatoes next time.  I won't use frozen broccoli again

oh my gosh I've never had a better broccoli and cheese soup. I made a few changes: one, I used 2 lbs. of Velveeta cheese. Two, I covered broccoli and onions with three cans of chicken broth and used 1.5 cups of the remaining can to dissolve the corn starch. And third, I used 20 0z. of broccoli. I just can't get over how wonderfully amazingly delicious this soup is. If you had to pick a broccoli and cheese soup recipe, this is the one. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER!!!!!!

i thought it was fantastic, my husband could eat the whole 2lb velveeta block alone so he thought it wasnt cheesy enough. i adjusted the recipe to 8 servings, used 3 cans of broth and used the 2/3 cup of broth instead of water for the cornstarch. i would have liked it if it was thicker, maybe i put too much broth. i used a full bag of frozen brocc plus a fresh bunch of brocc and 1.5 lbs of velveeta. i also had some heavy whipping cream and used that with the milk. all in all very filling and delicious served with sourdough bread!

This was very good and very easy to make.  The velvetta is really what made the soup - I don't think you could get the ooey gooey cheese factor with cheddar.

I made homemade bread bowls, and this was a great cold night soup.

This soup was very good.  I made it for my grandmother after she had gotten out of the hospital for surgery and she couldn't get enough of it.  I took the advice of others and doubled the cheese and the broccoli.  I used half frozen and half fresh as to have big pieces of the broccoli in the soup for presentation and for texture.  Anyways,  it was awesome and I well def put this in my soup rotation.

This is a great soup! I listened to the reviews of others and used more than 160z. of broccoli...maybe about 24oz. The cornstarch really thickens the soup well. Before adding the cheese sauce, I used an immersion blender to puree the broccoli pieces (so that my broccoli-hating husband would try it). He loved the soup and so did everyone else. Thanks!

I used fresh broccoli and a hand blender for a smoother texture.  I par steamed some florets and tossed those in for the last few minutes.  Excellent recipe.

I used half the butter specified, but other than that followed along as the recipe instructed. The soup was good, but it seemed to be too cheesy for us. Next time I will use only half the cheese and see how it turns out. But it was still a very good soup. Also, I made this in my slow cooker, and it was so easy, I would make it that way again.

I first made this in November 2007. It was great. I am going to make it again with the confidence of knowing it will be great again. The only thing I did different was add more cheese but who doesn't love cheese? Well sorry for all those lactose intolerant ones. But great recipe!!!

Awesome! I am always looking for something that tastes like restaurant quality and I have found it! Very good, rich and creamy! You just have to give it time to thicken up towards the end! Be patient it is worth it!

I've never liked broccoli-cheese soup, but for some reason, I was craving it, so I searched for a recipe, and found this one. And I'm so glad I did! As a lot of other reviewers did, I doubled the cheese and broccoli, and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.

I also sprinkled in some cheddar cheese.

SO GOOD!

Very easy to make. I boiled the broccoli in the broth then added the cheese and milk. Careful, don't let the cheese burn turn down the heat after it melts.

My boyfriend requested I make this soup for the holidays.  I am not a huge broccoli cheese soup fan, but it really surpassed my expectations.  After reading many reviews, I doubled the broccoli and the cheese, and this was really important.  I also used 2% velveeta and only 2 tablespoons of butter.  I did use about 1/2 the cornstarch recommended and combined it with the last can of broth, so the soup was a little thinner than the broccoli cheese soup I have had in chain cafes and sub shops; however, that wasn't at all a problem for me.  I don't like it to be as thick as nacho cheese!

Pretty good. Nice and cheesy. I added a few chicken strips and cooked them up with the onion. I didn't have chopped frozen broccoli, just the roughly cut stuff. So after it softened I took a immersion blender to it to chop it up a little more. It worked well. The only thing I didn't like was it had a slightly dry/grainy texture, maybe I did something wrong with the corn starch (I've never used it before).

Tasted great! But I didn't like how my cheese seemed to seperate. I wanted a smoother look. But like I said, it tasted great! Oh... and I used half regular broth and half roasted garlic flavored broth. MMMM

I like a chunkier soup, so I add 3 packages of broccoli, and for richness, I use 1 Cup half/half instead of 2 Cups milk.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with only two alterations.  I included a clove of garlic and I used onion powder since I had no garlic powder.  I poured it in the bowl, added a little salt and pepper, and I must say it was exceptional!

I followed this recipe to the letter except for using fresh broccoli and only a half cup of water to disolve the corn starch.  I thought it was bland.  The flavor didn't jump out for me.  I used quality, name brand ingredients too.  I kept thinking it needed something.  I think the recipe has promise, if that one missing ingredient which really brings out the flavor could be found.  I suspect that the processed cheese product was a big part of the problem.  It doesn't actually have much of a cheesey flavor.  The product may behave well, but in the end, it is little more than yellow filler.  I'll keep looking.

This was simply the best Broccoli Cheese soup I've ever had.  Like most, I doubled the amount of cheese and broccoli, and disolved the cornstarch in broth instead of water.  Outstanding!  I think it's funny that the only bad reviews this has received are from people who changed it so much from the original recipe, it's practically it's own soup.  Please try the recipe as listed and review it on that.  Then doctor it all you want and make it your own.

Followed recipe exactly, and was disappointed.  After all the "rave" reviews, I expected it to be better than it was.  I agree that it is too rich.  Probably won't make again.

this recipe rocks!  very good winter meal with ham sandwiches.  i usually dont change the recipe the first time i make it, but i did with this one just because there were so many consensual ideas.  changes:  32 oz. broccoli, 3 cans of chicken broth and used 1 cup of the 4th can with the cornstarch, 2 lb. velveeta, half and half instead of milk, and 1/2 tbsp. garlic was justright for us.
yum yum.  thanks for the recipe and thanks to everyone else for the suggestions!!!

Everyone in our family liked this recipe. We used fresh broccoli and cauliflower. 2 can chicken broth and 2 cups water w/ chicken boullion. Everything else we kept the same. I will add this to our favorites.Made again with double the frozen broccoli and liked it as well.

Great soup...my whole family loves it!  I did cut the cheese down to 1 1/3 loaves of cheese and increased the cornstarch a little.  I also added a bit more milk.  Truely delicious...everyone should try!

This is a very good recipe. I used the tips suggested by previous posters, and I took half of the broccoli/chicken broth base and pureed it in the blender. I also added shredded cheese on top.

Yummmm!

It was pretty good, and very easy.  Too bad my husband told me he "doesn't like" broccoli so I won't be making this as a regular soup.  I added "matchstick" carrots and frozen corn to the broccoli when cooking in the broth. Then added 2 packages of large ham cubes when I added the milk/garlic powder. I also didn't have enough velveeta so I only used about 1/2 pound of that and 1 1/2 c of shredded cheddar. The people that complain about the onion probably don't use the small (slightly larger than a golfball) cooking onions. I used one of those and thought the flavor was fine. I also didn't think the garlic powder was too much, but I like garlic and had the other veggies/ham/cheese flavors in there.

Tasty!  I think the garlic powder is a little too much - next time I'll make it 2 tsp.    If you don't have corn starch, you can add instant potato flakes to thicken the soup; it's really easy to add them a little at a time until you get the consistency you desire.

We loved it!  I think I would dice the onion a little finer next time - and I left out the cup of water and used some of the broth to dissolve the cornstarch instead - I will put this on my list of favorite soups!

VERY GOOD!  It makes quite a lot.  I doubled the amt of broccoli, used 1/2&1/2 (2%) and did not use water.  I mix the cornstarch with the last can of broth.  Quick and easy to make.

this was very heavy w/o being creamy. maybe too much corn starch. i'll try making a roux next time with flour instead of corn starch, half light cream and half chicken broth, and half cheddar - half processed cheese.

This turned out really well, although I think the next time I would reduce the amount of broth.  I also used fresh broccoli and it turned out I should have used more of it.  I also added some real shredded cheddar because it didn't seem cheesy enough.  Overall, though, the flavor and consistency of this soup is excellent, although it did take quite a while and extra cornstarch to thicken.  I think decreasing the amount of broth is the key to making this recipe just about perfect.  Thanks, I will definately make this one again.

This is very close to the Bread Company/Panera Bread's soup -which is my favorite! I followed the other reviewers suggestions of halving the recipe except for the cheese and brocolli and I also added shredded carrots to make it more like the Bread Co's. Perfect for a cold winter day!

This is fantastic. I served it tonight with jalapeno cheese bread. Hubby loved it too.

Changes/Additions I made: I added 1 diced potato, used mexican velveeta, and half & half instead of milk.

The flavor of this soup was awesome. My boyfriend said it was the best broccoli cheese soup he's had. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't care for it reheated the next day. It seemed way to think - maybe I'll try it without the cornstarch next time.

This recipe was really easy to make and tasty.  I followed other recommendations and first off, cut the recipe in half.  As a twist, and because I only had 1/2 the broccoli I needed, I also used frozen asparagus.  I mixed them with some chicken broth, placed in the food processor and then on pulse, got the veggies into much smaller pieces.  I also cut the amount of broth by half and made up the difference with half-n-half, and substituted all of the milk with half-n-half.  When it was all said and done, the soup had too creamy of a taste so next time, I will keep the broth amount the same and just substitute the milk with the half-n-half.  I used half processed cheese and half cheddar to reduce the sodium.  Because of the overly creamy taste, I had to add a little more cheese.  Because of all the cream, the soup was too light in color so I added a drop or two of red food coloring and it gave it that nice cheddar cheese yellow orange it was lacking.  I purchased bread bowls from Panera and served the soup in there.  Very filling!

This was incredible!  I did like a lot of others, and used 3 cans broth, 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream, 1 tbls minced garlic, and added 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese.  I put an extra 8 ozs of broccoli, which, as a broccoli hater, was too much.  That is the only thing I will change next time...no extra broccoli!  Otherwise this was delicious and very close to what I get at Panera.

GREAT SOUP! This was the first time making anything like this. My husband absolutely loved it, which really surprised me. I halved the recipe and because there was quite a bit left over, I threw it over some pasta the next day. Not too bad, but the soup (on its own) was way better. THANKS :)

agree, add another bag of brocolli.  PLUS... add some white wine to taste, fresh chopped parsley AND 1/4 cup of grated carrots.  that's what Panera (I think) does and it adds a really good flavor.

This was a very tasty recipe, though for some reason it was lumpy.  I probably either didn't melt the cheese thoroughly or didn't dissolve the cornstarch enough.  Either way, I will be making this again.

This recipe was really good. I made a couple changes, I used fresh broccoli and added one cup of the broccoli water to the chicken broth.  I also added sharp cheddar along with velveta.  Goes perfect with some homemade bread!

Fantastic!  After reading through some of the reviews, I made a few alterations.  I used two bags of frozen broccoli, 3 cans of organic chicken broth and substituted one cup of heavy cream for one cup of milk.  Also added a bit of garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Have made it this way twice, will continue.  Thanks!!

This was really yummy.  I used 1/2 leeks, 1/2 onions, just cause i LOVE leeks, and threw in 1 minced garlic clove.  Only used 3 cans of chicken broth instead of 4, and 2 bags of broccoli.  Added not only the processed cheese, but a good couple handfuls of shredded sharp chedder.  Also, subsituted the milk with half and half, and used one cup chicken broth to mix with the cornstarch.  Then I simmered it for about 30 minutes.  My 5 year old loved it, as well as our neighbors (it was a large pot and I had plenty to share.) Served with plain old saltines and it was soooo good!!  I'm totally keeping this one!!

Fantastic!! We added almost 3 lbs fresh broccoli crowns and used half and half instead of milk. Didn't need as much of the cornstarch with the extra broccoli, but boy did that thicken it up great! Garnished with some cheddar cheese, too like others said. Highly recommended!!

This was very good.  Based on other reviews, the changes I made were 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, 2 cans chicken broth, 4 cups fresh broccoli, 1 cup cauliflower,
1/4 lb velveeta and 1/2 lb sharp cheddar, 1 cup milk, 1 cup half and half, 1/3 cup corn starch.  I pureed half the chicken broth mixture in a blender, then added it back to the pot, so it wouldnt be as chunky.  Im giving it 4 stars only because the recipe needed so many changes, but this was the best broccoli soup Ive ever made.

Very good! I added some crushed Town House crackers (for salt) on top, with a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, and it was very yummy!

I thought this recipe was great.  I just substituted real cheddar instead of processed and used a chicken boullion powder mixed with water since I didnt have any chicken stock on hand.  I blended it to make it more creamy and the hubby loved it!

Great flavor.  Definately used more brocolli and less garlic.  This soup hasa great base for changing it to cheesy potato and bacon, or even brocolli potato.

Incredibly delicious! I used what I had on hand, but the basic recipe is what I followed and it was SO wonderful. I scaled the recipe in half but used 3/4 package broccoli florets, since so many others suggested using extra broccoli. I used about 1 cup mexican style shredded cheese and 1/2 cup italian style mix shredded cheese, and 1/4 cup broken up american cheese pieces, since that's what I had on hand. I used fat free milk and added a teaspoon of mustard powder and chopped the broc up with my spatula while it was simmering, and used flour instead of cornstarch. I can't believe frozen broccoli and random cheeses came out so great! Thanks!

We tried this recipe the other night and it is absolutely full of taste.  I like my soup really thick, so I made sure I was patient when I added the cornstarch mixture-just keep stirring until you get the consistency you want.  Next time I'm going to dress it up with white wine as recommended.

I recently had broccoli cheese soup at a restaurant, and wanted to try and make it at home...This was great! And don't be afraid to customize it to your own tastes...I added only half the butter,and onion, doubled the broccoli, used 1 less can of broth, and added 1c. shredded cheddar, and it turned out DEE-LICIOUS!!:)Thanks Karin!

Wonderful recipe- thank you!  I followed reviewers advice and doubled the broccoli and added 1 cup cheddar cheese.  Also 1 tsp mustard powder with the galic.  Fabulous as written and as modified!  To lower fat you can easily take most of the butter away as well.  Will make again and again.

My youngest daughter, who is 6, LOVES broccoli.  Everytime we go out to eat, she asks if they have Broccoli Cheese soup.  So, to surprise her, my husband (the cook in the family) made this soup.  She loves it!  Everyone did, in fact (except my 11 year old, who thinks anything green will kill him).  The one thing I thought was missing was that "real cheddar" taste.  So I sprinkled on some taco cheese (it was as close to cheddar as I had at home) and it helped dramatically.  We cut the chicken broth in half, as others suggested, and completely left out the garlic, as my daughter isn't a fan of it.  We also used cream in place of the milk and 1/2 cup of cornstarch.  It was perfect!  I would recommend this to anyone!  And the best part is you're using frozen broccoli, so you don't spend a lot of time chopping and it's ready in no time!

Ready in almost no time at all, but I'd use less garlic powder than the recipe suggests!  This was way too much garlic.  I also added some celery salt and that gave it a fuller flavor. All in all not a bad recipe.  I just tweaked it a bit for my guest's and my taste.

I'm not what you'd call a "cook."  I rarely spend any time in the kitchen, but my husband really wanted me to make cheese and broccoli soup.  So, I found this recipe and got to work.  Not only was this one of the easiest things I've ever made, my husband took one taste test and with awe in his eyes he said, "mmmmm..."  I'm calling my sisters right now to give them this recipe.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I first found this recipe over a year ago and I have been making it non-stop ever since.  Although; I had no idea until today as I was reading these reviews, that 'processed' cheese food means velveeta!  I have always used either chedder or colby-jack which I am fine with since I don't really like velveeta anyways.  One thing I've learned is that once you add the cheese (especially if you are not using velveeta), don't let it boil!  Let it get as hot as possible without boiling or it will come out grainy.  I also leave out the water (for convenience) and just mix the corn starch with the milk. I am a terrible cook and can only make about 3 things, but this is one of them!  My entire family loves it too.

This is delicious! As someone else suggested, I doubled the cheese but I'm not positive that was necessary. It was the perfect consistency for my husband and I, but leftovers have that jelly-like consistency that cornstarch-thickened foods tend to have, so next time I'll probably use 1/2 cornstarch and 1/2 flour. I like this soup because other other than the milk and the onion, it can be made with ingredients from the pantry and freezer. Not crazy about using processed cheese, but it is a great melting option that won't "separate".

First time I tried making this soup myself..recipe is awesome..tastes just like from a restaurant..just got done making it and couldn't believe how easy it was..the only thing I tried different is half and half instead of regular milk because I heard it thickens the soup better..and I added a bit more broccoli than called for(about 1/4 cup more but I think even a bit more woulda been better)I used sharp cheddar as well(a little harder to get to melt but worth it) and the 1 lb was just enough if not just a tad too much..next time maybe a little less garlic but I'm not a big seasoner..5 star recipe definately

This soup didn't quite meet my expectations.  Maybe they were a little too high.  I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the broccoli and cheese.  Broccoli amount was perfect but it was a little too "cheesy" for my taste.  Next time I might just put 1 1/2 lb. of cheese.  Also, omit the garlic powder, doesn't really fit in with everything else.  Next time I'll add some black pepper instead.  It makes A LOT!  Hopefully it'll freeze well!

This was absolutely easy and had such a wonderful flavor!  I took the advice of others and halved the recipe for everything but the broccoli.  I also omitted the milk because I like it a little thicker.  I was concerned about the amount of cornstarch it called for but it was fine.  Even my son had a bowl before going to school and asked for it again when he came home!

I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen; less garlic; less onion; and a little more corn starch to make it a tad bit thicker.  Everyone loved it!  My dad still can't stop talking about it. The prep time is a little underestimated, but I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was really good!  I used two pounds of the cheese, two 16 oz bags of frozen broccoli (next time I'll use more).  I followed the directions of the previous poster who used a crockpot.  I cooked mine for 4 hours and the broccoli was a bit mushy, so maybe next time just three hours... otherwise, yummy!  Thanks!

The cheese tastes very good in this, I was originally worried about that. But the soup seems a little empty. I am thinking about adding some more vegetalbes to it. My mom liked the soup as is though, so i guess it's just my personal taste. Also, do use fresh broccoli instead of frozen one, frozen food lacks vitamins.

Love this recipe. I use fresh broccoli
and also add small red potatoes for more substance. I have even used dry mustard instead of the garlic. I like it either way. My family loves this soup. Thanks!

Little too much garlic and I am a garlic lover! However I enjoyed this recipe. I tried it with light velveta and spray butter to make it a lower-fat dish, served it in a bread bowl and it was a dish I'd make again.

This is an awsome recipe.  About 3 months after we had this, we were driving in the car and my 5 year old was asking. " Mom can you make some broccoli soup like what you made last time." Of course I ran out to the store to get the broccoli needed, although I use fresh instead of frozen.   Thanks for the recipe, I will make it often.

Tasty, hot and creamy just like a good soup should be. I think I might add Kielbasa slices or something like that to make it a bit heartier and add protein...

I made this soup for the first time for my husband tonight, and we both loved it!!  It turns out nice and thick and has great flavor.  I think next time I might add a little more broccoli, and maybe a few julienned carrots and some potato.  A meal in itself!

I was a little skeptical, but in the end everyone in my family really enjoyed it!! My husband and daughter requested MORE broccoli. We rate it a winner!! The only changes I made the second time were to add julliened carrots and reduce the amount of cornstarch. What a fabulous and easy recipe!!

Just excellent.  I did 1.5 lb Velveeta and extra broccoli.  Used half and half instead of milk.  I also added a few handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese at the end and some white pepper.  Totally exceeded my expectations!!  BF ate 3 bowls of it in 20 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Without question, this is the best homemade soup I have ever made!  It's VERY easy and tastes wonderful.  I recommend adding a little extra cheese (I usually throw in some cheddar).  I also add a dash of extra garlic power.  Fresh broccoli has a better taste than frozen (plus, you don't get all of the stems that come in the frozen bags).  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This soup was delicious and very easy to make.  Like the other readers, I increased the amount of cheese to 1 1/2 lbs. and added fresh broccoli to the frozen (probably the equivalent of one head).  I have friends and family over every week for soup night and this was a hit.  It will go in the regular rotation.  Thanks Karin!

Oh my goodness,little taste of heaven... We loved it. My three year old loves "cheese soup", so I put the frozen broccolli flowerettes through my food chopper first, and it was wonderful. I didn't have any trouble with thickening, it was just awsome!!! Thank you Karin!

When I started making this my husband wasn't so sure about the processed cheese food in this soup but after he tasted it he completely changed his mind.  I did change two factors when making the soup 1) I used fresh broccoli and 2) I blended the soup so that there weren't any chunks.  In my husbands words "I wouldn't be ashamed to invite someone over for a bowl of this!" :)

This recipe was good as is (I used pre-packaged fresh broccoli florets and half milk/ half fat free half n half).  But when I added cubed potatoes (from a can) to the leftovers and garnished with crumbled bacon - it was even better!

I tried this out and I was happy with the result I got.  I did add a few tablespoons of flour to act as a thickening agent, and an extra 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and 3 garlic cloves, minced.

This receipe is fantastic! I substitute half and half for the milk and add 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of 1 Tbs. My husband is not a big garlic lover. But let me tell you he LOVES your soup receipe! My whole family has your receipe. It is so easy and quick to make at the last minute. Thank you so much!

I made this soup when I needed a quick and easy soup to cook along with my mother's birthday dinner. It was so flippin' good! It was really easy to prepare, and everyone was crazy about it. I used shredded cheddar cheese and a cherry tomato as a garnish, like I read in someone else's review. However, the recipe says to keep the flame low when adding the cornstarch. I did the opposite. If you turn up the flame while putting in the starch, it will actually thicken.

This soup is excellent!  I used red onion and sauteed with the garlic.  As suggested in some of the other reviews, I used half processed cheese and half extra sharp cheese.  Thanks for the recipe Karin!

This was my first time making broccoli soup and this was fantastic!!  It's even better than what I would have in a restaraunt.  For garnishment, I added shredded cheddar cheese and diced tomatoes.

Very good, but salty so try use stock that doesn't have a lot of salt in it.

I had the worst craving for broccoli and cheese soup this past week.  I didn't have the processed cheese so I used about a pound of shredded mexican cheese.  It did leave the soup a little grainy, but was still very good.  I did have to add quite a bit more salt to achieve the right taste and instead of mixing the cornstarch with water, I used whipping cream.  Added lots more calories, but was worth it.  I added some shredded carrots while I was sauteeing the onions and sprinkled on some freshly ground black pepper.  My father in law and I enjoyed this very much and I would certainly consider making this again.  Thanks Karin.

To be honest, after reading the ingredients list, I had my doubts but I figured that with all the good reviews, I had to give it a try.  I don't give very many 5 star ratings, but this recipe certainly deserved it.  The flavor and texture match exactly the broccoli cheese soups I love from restaurants.  I added salt, but that is the only thing I did differently from the recipe.

Excellent!  I used both fresh grated cheese and ready grated cheese and found ready grated cheese contains cellulose to prevent caking.  It also prevents complete melting.  Also, added cream to each bowl at the table to cut the garlic.

Absolutely fantastic! Although this soup is very high in fat....thankfully it is very filling and is very simple to make.  Its a hearty meal when served with some crusty bread. I have also made this with left over cubed ham. Its great either way.

Great recipe!  I used my hand blender to slightly puree the brocolli before I added the cheese so my toddler wouldn't recognize the broccoli.  It worked great and he loved it.

This is an amazing recipe. I love tons of garlic so I doubled the garlic powder in the recipe. Also, I forgot to buy a processed cheese, so I use normal cheddar and it came out tasting great, but really clumped. Next time, Ill use Velveeta (spelling?)... Everyone loved it in my house - even my mother who hates broccoli. Awesome, awesome, awesome recipe!!!!!! Thanks!

This is a gret recipe and it's really quick and easy. The only change I made was to leave the onion whole so that I could take it out when the soup was finished. I liked the flavor with the onion, I did try it both with and without, but I have kids who hate to chew the onions.

I followed the crockpot recipe that was included in the reviews. It was very good but I think I'd use a little less garlic powder. 1 tsp. was still too salty for my family's taste. Very easy to make though. I'll make it again.

Not a big hit here.  The kids would barely touch it, and they LOVE broccoli.  It was too bland for my husband and I.  It needs something.  We added pepper & shredded cheese, but it didn't do the trick.  It wasn't gross, just not great.  We won't be making this again.

An excellent recipe for such an easy preparation.  Tastes like broccoli cheese soup from a restaurant.  Next time I will add a bit more cheese to make it thicker.

I made this last night then brought the leftovers to my Mom's for Easter lunch. Everyone loved it. I'm printing copies of the recipe for my Mom & sister who says it's better than the Ritz Carlton's soup. Thanks DW.

Excellent soup. My teenagers loved it the whole kettle was gone in one meal with 4 people eating and I had to hide a bowl for my husband or he would not have gotten any. I went with the recipe as written except for using fresh broccoli and absolute keeper thanks!!! Delores

This was good but VERY salty.  Velvetta and canned chicken broth have so much added salt.  Even with homemade stock, I thought it was too salty.  But it was tasty and had a nice creamy texture.

This recipe is great!  It was quick and delicious, even better than you would find in a restraunt.  Might even be made better with some ham or bacon and potatos?

Great soup!  I doubled the cheese and used fresh broccoli.  Next time I'll skip the corn starch.  Loved it!

This is the best. It is sooo easy and does not take much time at all. I love it. I simered some white wine with it and it made it soo good. We had fresh baked french bread with. Simply awsome!

Super recipe!  My 9 year old gives it a 10 and my veggie hating 11 year old ate 2 bowls.
I used fresh garlic (sauteed with onion). In order to keep fat down, I also reduced both the butter and the cheese by one half, 
and used no-fat (skim) milk.  It was still VERY rich.  I also simmered for 5 minutes to keep the broccoli a little 'crisper'.

Good soup for a midweek, run of the mill meal.  Needs some dressing up to make it really spectacular.  Next time, I'll dress up with real cream, fresh broccoli, better cheese, and most importantly, authentic chicken stock -- not canned broth.  Then garnish with bacon and green onion.

My husband and I really enjoyed the soup.  My son loves broccoli cheese soup but didn't like this one.  He said it had too much garlic, not enough cheese.  Next time I make it I will put more cheese, and less garlic.

my only suggestion is temper the chicken broth with water if you use a flavorful chicken broth.  And an extra package of cheese doesn't hurt.  :)

We loved this recipe and I have some major Broccoli Cheese Soup Lovers in my house!!  I sauteed the onions in the wine and liked that flavor a lot.  I only used half the garlic powder because I was afraid it would overpower the other flavors, but will probably use a little more next time.  This was easy to make and enjoyable to eat!!  Thanks!!

The best homemade broccoli cheese soup I've had.  Wonderful cheesy flavor without being too rich and very filling! I only used two cans of broth becasue that was all I had and I substituted cream for milk and ommitted the cornstartch to make a perfect all protein/no carbs meal. If you are on a low-carb diet it's a great recipe!

need to chop up vegetables a lot more and microscopic onions, but only about 1/2 an onion.  Didn't use as much starch and added a little co-jack cheese and a dash of parmesan cheese.

I think it tasted great before I added the milk, and I think there was also too much cornstarch.  Otherwise, it's a nice, simple recipe to make for a winter soup.

I wanted to try and duplicate the broccoli cheese soup made at McAlister's here in the south. After reading some of the reviews I chose can you use 4 tablespoons butter with y'all sauteed the onion and two cloves of garlic in then I added 4 tablespoons of flour to make a roux. I used two cartons of chicken broth and added some carrot matchsticks. I chose to use two heads of broccoli instead of the frozen broccoli. After cooking the broccoli and carrots 15 or 20 minutes, I used a potato masher to get the consistency that I wanted. I also used a pound of Velveeta chopped up small and about 2 cups of mild cheddar. This will be my new go to recipe for broccoli cheese soup.

This recipe is Theeeee Best!!! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the T. This time, I made it a little different. Instead of the cans of chicken broth, I used 1 & 1/2 packs of Knorrs Chicken Bullion, with the right amount of water, heated the water just to get the bullion mixed in without powdery lumps,  then I used a bag of frozen broccoli and a bag of frozen spinach. The taste is so good! It taste much better with the powdered bullion instead of the chicken broth.

It's a good recipe. I've made it twice. Did a couple of little things different but I stuck pretty close to the original recipe.

Absolutely delicious made as recipe states.  This recipe is so easy, it’s one of my most frequently made soups.  It’s a forgiving recipe: you can tweak it to what you have available.  I can’t find cans of chicken broth in the country I’m living in right now, so I have to substitute bouillon cubes - works fine.  I also can’t get frozen broccoli, so I must substitute fresh.  I just sautéed the onions in the butter, added in the bouillon broth, then added finely chopped fresh broccoli and let it cook a while before adding milk, cheese, etc.  DELICIOUS!  I’m so thankful I tried this recipe. Thanks so much for posting it.

This is our family's favorite Broccoli Cheese Soup. I have made it many many many times. I typically make it with fresh broccoli florets rather than frozen broccoli because that's what the boys/fam like the best.

I thought it was an easy recipe to follow and cook.  I added more broccoli than called for. Garlic measurement might have been a little more than my liking, so next time around will reduce it just a little. Otherwise, delicious!

Really good and simple enough recipe. I changed it slightly for our preference: added frozen avocado pieces and blended these with precooked broccoli so soup became very smooth and flavorful. The color looks really beautiful and appetizing in our bowls. I didn’t add any corn starch since the avocado thickens naturally. It’s a really bold yet bountiful flavor and goes well with garlic bread. I also reduced the butter and used chicken broth cubes instead.

Great recipe. I have made it 3 times, once with cauliflower. I also add carrots for their color and nutrition. 
It only took a little cornstarch to thicken it, about half.

This was great! My family loved it. I took the advice of some reviews here and doubled the cheese, and I used medium cheddar for half of it. I also used heavy cream. I added a little cayenne pepper, smoked paprika and chipotle chili pepper because we like smoky flavor and a little spice.

Yum! I was worried it would be too velveeta-ey but it was yummy. I halved the recipe for myself but put the full amount of broccoli and cheese in it as others said they did. I think I will try less cheese next time. As it was pretty thick and cheesy but not so overwhelming so I can see why others liked it like this. Thank you!

My husband said, "this is better than any restaurant!"

I used an immersion blender on the broccoli after it simmered just so it wasn't as big of chunks and it was amazing!

I followed the recipe with two exceptions: I used 1 less can of chicken broth and added two cups of real cheese because it was not as thick as I would've liked. Solid recipe but it didn't taste as flavorful as I would've liked. I regret not adding some celery or carrots or something else to give it a little depth.  I would consider using this recipe again with more modifications!

This was surprisingly simple, and tasted great! I used fresh broccoli, but followed the recipe for everything else. I would probably add a little pepper next time, but still great.

I thought this soup was quite tasty.  I did however, use fresh broccoli.  I tried using medium cheddar but I won’t do that next time because the cheese doesn’t blend well.  Thanks for the recipe

Flavor was good but I think this recipe is designed for cheese byproducts like Velveeta because there was too much liquid and my cheddar simply seperated in the liquid to form little cheese balls in my soup.   Still tasted good

Great fast tasty soup.  I used an entire 32 oz box of broth and a 12 oz bag of frozen florets.  Only added one cup of milk and 6 oz of cheese.  I omitted the cornstarch. Everything was still super tasty.  Served with Naan bread.

Fantastic!!!!!! I’ve made this exact to the recipe-awesome. I’ve tweaked it-awesome. My tweaks weren’t much. I added some garlic, paprika and a couple drops of Tabasco to the onion sauté. Instead of milk, I added 1 cup of cream and 1 can of beer. I also let it sit on the stove on min covered for a couple hours. Finally, I added a brick of old cheddar. Love it!

Wow, this is one of the best soups I have ever made! I followed the recipe as written with only a couple of deviations (halved it and used 2 cups chopped fresh broccoli instead of frozen), then sat down to a wonderful glorious experience as my taste buds sang while I ate. Sooooo good!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used fresh broccoli, fat-free half and half, 6 T butter, 4 garlic cloves minced, the powdered garlic, 3 chicken bouillon cubes, fresh ground pepper and a good splash of white wine (Chardonnay).  I added a mixture of cheddar cheeses instead of the processed cheese and thickened with 2 T cornstarch and cold water.  Very tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

Making it now and I have made it in the past. I love it. I add more broccoli and some other spices. I also mix it with white rice and its delicious. If its too watery I add more corn starch or the opposite I add water. Its an easy meal that makes plenty for the next days.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it is DELICIOUS!! I followed the advice of others and doubled up on the broccoli. I used heavy cream instead of milk, and added some shredded sharp cheddar at the end. this soup is so flavorful and very hearty! Will definitely be making this again!

This is the best recipe I have found for broccoli cheese soup.   I was out of cornstarch so  I used  flour and water to thicken it . I also added a package of sharp cheddar cheese.  I also pureed it with my stick blender.  It came out great.  Maybe use half and half next time   However, it is still very rich just using milk.

I gave this 5 stars based on what I did. Here is what I did. Never use water when making any kind of a cheese soup. Always substitute milk for water. I used 'Cream of Chicken Soup' (Condensed). Again, use milk, and not water! Water is too thin and will dilute everything including flavor and make it more runny. All you need is 1/4 cup (not 1/2 cup) of butter to saute the onions. If you are sensitive to garlic, use half the amount. Don't use cornstarch. If you have to use "cornstarch" then you didn't use milk instead of water, or you use too much milk, or you don't have enough cheese in your soup. Never use water in this recipe!! Add 1 tsp of Knorr Caldo Sabor De Pollo or some kind of chicken powder or bouillon to the soup - if you think it needs more salt and chicken flavor. If you think the soup is too thin, add more cheese. If you think the soup is too thick, then add more milk. The cheese I used is always American Pasteurized Processed Cheese. Any real (None Processed) cheese will not work. It will not blend. It will be like oil and water, and will not mix. I've already made this mistake in the past, so don't repeat that mistake. I also boil or steam my broccoli separately, until it's the way I like it, then I add it to the finished soup. If you like lots of broccoli, then use lots of broccoli. Make it the way you like it. Not every recipe is going to suit everyone. You have to make it your own - enjoy!

I doubled the broccoli & cheese as suggested. I also shredded a large carrot & cooked it down with the onions. Right before I added the broccoli , I threw in a couple cloves of minced garlic & cooked it down for a minute. I thought that it needed a teaspoon of pepper too. Next time I just may substitute half & half for the milk.

Delicious!  I used 2 different processed cheeses (a white cheese mild and creamer).  I didn’t use cornstarch, but with the extra cheese it didn’t need it.  Also used plenty of fresh broccoli and served it with homemade cornbread.  IT WAS A HIT

Followed recipe exactly except used equal amount of fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Bland and kind of gloppy to me. I added curry powder while eating it to give it some flavor.

This was my first time making broccoli and cheese soup. My boyfriend LOVED it! The only reason why I put 4 stars is because my cheese ended up clumping up and it was a struggle trying to break it apart.

I only had 1/2 the cubed cheese so I grated some old chedder cheese (about 3/4 worth).  Instead of adding milk I added 1/2 and 1/2 cream because I had it and had to use it up.  I didn't have enough chicken broth so I added I can of Campbell's Broccoli and Cheese condensed soup with 1/2 milk and 1/2 water.

Great base recipe!  Made small mods to my taste like everyone else. Added three thinly sliced carrots, a sprinkle of mustard powder and some minced garlic when I sautéed the onions. Used 2 heads of fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Then I mixed the cornstarch with about 1 cup of the chicken broth instead of water and subbed heavy cream instead of milk. Also added a handful of shredded cheddar on top of the velveeta cheese in the recipe, and used some cheddar on top as garnish. Great soup!! Maybe even better then Panara breads ??

I first cooked a large bag of frozen  broccoli pieces and poured them into my colander to drain. Using the same pan, I sautéed the onion in the half cup butter, then added 1/2 cup flour to make a roux. Cooked that a couple minutes, then added my chicken broth, half and half, a little garlic powder, cheese and the broccoli. Let it cook to thicken. It was delicious, especially on this cold, snowy day in Iowa!

Made half of the recipe so that I could test it out for my super-picky tween daughter. I blended up about a cup of the broccoli-onion-chicken broth mixture to bring out more of the broccoli flavor, and left some larger broccoli chunks (daughter's preference). I didn't have garlic powder, so I sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic salt in and that was a good option. The Velveeta is salty enough that replacing the garlic powder with garlic salt in full would have been overwhelmingly salty, so I'm happy with just the sprinkle I used.

I made it as directed except used half and half instead of milk and it was very watery. I think it calls for too much chicken broth. The flavor is good thought.

This soup tastes sooo good.  Only thing is it does take a little extra time to cut veggies & I was a little nervous making the butter/flour mixture (I didn't want to mess it up)!  I definitely will make again!

This was perfect!  I doubled the recipe and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. It was so rich and delicious! If you are trying to do low carb this is perfect.  Just fewer onions and whipping cream instead of milk.

I took some advice from the other reviews and started with garlic and onions, used chicken broth and added carrots and red pepper flakes for flavor.  I used an immersion blender to get the consistency I wanted in a broccoli cheese soup.  Turned our great!  It took me 3 hours instead of 1, but I am slow at prep so maybe that is why.

This was a good guide but I used flour to thicken it at the beginning instead of the cornstarch.  I added some shredded carrots also.  I used cheddar/jack shredded cheese and used more than the recipe called for.  Then I added bacon crumbles when I served it.  It was yummy.

Disappointed in this one.  I added the diced cheese and it all seized up together and turned into a clumpy mess I couldn't get it to blend at all... upon googling this problem there's very little you can do to fix cheese once it clumps.  I ended up spooning out 2 cups of sludge basically, and throwing in 2 oz packages of shredded cheddar blend cheese which worked much better so I was happy I was able to save it, but wasted a lot of cheese.  Another caveat is that it's not a good idea to use just cheddar straight without another easily meltable cheese.  Cheddar alone doesn't melt in real well unless it's already shredded.

Just made this tonight; it was my time making soup. I doubled the cheese and broccoli like most comments suggested and, if I can say anything, I think I'd use 1 1/2 pounds of the cheese, a compromise between the original 1 pound or the suggested 2 pounds. That's just my take on it. My family loved it and I've already been asked to make it again.

I had frozen broccoli stacking up in the freezer so I was looking for a winter soup and I looked through a lot of  recipes. I read the comments first and  made a few changes but it turned out great...Will definitely make again and I'm looking to see if I can can it!
I omitted the 1 cup of water, added the equivalent of flour to the milk...I had a bad experience with corn starch as a kid..
And I added some leftover roast chicken breast...great thickness, taste and texture....

If you like to taste the broccoli in the soup, cut back on the garlic a bunch.  It's okay, but I prefer to add (less) real cheese to broccoli soup.  Besides, who can afford an $8-10 block of cheese for one pot of soup?  :(

This soup is amazing!!! I made a few alterations based on other reviews. I did a roux by adding flour to the butter and onions versus doing the corn starch and also doubled the broccoli and Velveeta. Its to die for!

I only needed to use 1/2 of the corn starch mix called for.

Made this for myself when I was sick with a bad cold.  So much better than store bought or restaurant.  Used a cup of frozen chopped onions to save time.  Otherwise, followed the directions exactly.  So good!!!  Makes a big pot.

Very good soup base but as the reviews note the consistency is a bit off. I did 3/4 cup of water instead of one but it was still very runny. I added an entire bag of shredded cheddar cheese and an extra 1/3 cup of corn starch. It was perfect that night. To reheat I had to add milk and stir prior to microwaving.

I’ve made this recipe a few times now. It is one of our favorites, and great for this cold winter weather. I do cut the butter in half.

This is an easy soup that is good just as the recipe is or you can pop it up with some cayenne pepper and white wine.  I added cauliflower too

I made this with about 4 cups of fresh broccoli and I chopped half a bag of frozen broccoli. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone loved it!! It will definitely be a recipe I use again and again!!

Made as written using Velveeta and 2% milk.  I did add about 50% more broccoli and about 2 Tbsp. sour cream.  It was plenty rich!

Made this in the Instant Pot blender: 5 minutes prep (no sauté), 22 minutes later it was done.  Scale back the recipe to four servings so it doesn’t overflow. No need for thickener (added starch).    Mmmmmmm........

Awesome soup! I admit I cut the amount of cheese, but it was still great.  Did use fresh garlic since it was available.  This time it turned out thinner than expected, maybe due to the change in the amount of cheese...so yeah, don't that!. Doubling is prefferable...heck, who cares about the calories!

We loved it!  After reading other reviews, I doubled the broccoli and cheese content and mixed the cornstarch with a cup of reserved chicken broth.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of garlic powder a smidge.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added a bottle of beer (12oz, lagger) after the onions sautéed in the butter and let it reduce down for about 10 minutes. Then I used real Vermont cheddar instead of the processed cheese and heavy cream instead of milk. Finished it off with some white pepper, cumin, and a dash of hot sauce. Came out perfect!

I made a few adjustments. Used fresh broccoli. Used chicken broth to make my corn starch slurry rather than water. Used a whole 2 lb block of Velveeta, added in two separate batches, and stirred constantly as each batch of cheese melted. Let it simmer when its all done until you just start to smell broccoli cooking down, then let it cool for about 20 minutes before serving. It was very cheesy, velvety texture. I will definitely make this again.

The cheese was nearly non-existant probably due to this calling for too much chicken broth. Next time I will double the cheese, use less broth and add spices since this was quite bland. I suppose this is a decent base recipe.

This soup is way too thin, with not nearly enough broccoli. It never thickened up, even though I followed the recipe. I tried adding more broccoli cheese, but that didn't work. To be honest I'll probably throw this out.

I was hesitant on making this bc velveeta creeps me out but the reviews were excellent so I gave it a shot and I’m glad I did! This is the best broccoli cheddar soup I’ve ever made... I did add one thing though. When the soup was done it looked too smooth and yellow so I steamed a 10oz bag of broccoli in the microwave then put it through my food processor. After adding it to my soup the look and texture were perfect! I also added a big handful of shredded extra sharp cheddar (bc can you ever have too much cheese? Haha). This will be going into my regular soup rotation for sure!

Delicious! It made a large batch so I’m giving half to my sister. The only change I made was adding in one carrot and one large clove of garlic that I needed to use up.

Following other recommendations I used half and half and doubled the cheese. I also used fresh broccoli. This soup is awesome! I’ll definitely make it again!

I did not have any onions so I did not get to pit some in. I also did not reach the 2 cups of milk,only about 1 cup and a half. The soup was a bit thick for my liking but the flavor is good. I hope to make this another time

I love this soup.  I’m not much of a cook but it turned out great. I used fresh broccoli that is in a twelve ounce bag already washed and cut so just chopped it up more. I used a little less broth and more milk. Added instant rice about 2 cups at the end.

I made this last night as directed and I tasted more chicken broth than I did cheese. My husband added some cayenne pepper to his and it spiked up the taste. Next time I will use less chicken broth.

Great recipe!! As Karin suggested, I added some white wine. I also substituted Half and Half  for whole milk but that's just a personal preference. Wonderful recipe!  It was exactly what I wanted on a cold winter's night.

Followed directions, but I didn’t have velveeta so I used shredded mild cheddar and Colby jack. Was pretty bland, and a little thin, and 2/3 cups corn starch is a crazy amount! Next time I will cut the stock back by 2 cups, & reserve 1 cup of stock to mix the corn starch. Also will add carrots & celery and use an immersion blender before I add the broccoli. Still will use cheddar and Colby jack because I think velveeta is gross, and I’ll add some red pepper flakes, black pepper, parsley, and maybe some basil too.

I halved the recipe except for the cheese and broccoli and added the following to the chicken broth: 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning; 1 tsp of parsley (all dry herbs) 1/2 tsp of chili paste, many dashes of Black pepper, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 chicken bouillon cube. Did 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. 3 tbsp of cornstarch. OMG. Deliciously

This is a delicious soup!  I've made it with fresh and also with frozen broccoli, and used unsweetened Almond milk.  Entire pot of soup gone in a day, so I made another.  You won't regret making this recipe.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it is delicious! The only changes I made were to use half and half instead of milk, and I puréed the broccoli before adding the cheese (used 2% milk velveta). I also added the wine which Karin suggested. Thank you for sharing!

Awesome! The best broccoli cheese soup I’ve ever had! and very easy to make. I,like many people, doubled the amount of cheese and broccoli. I used one block of Velveeta and 1/2 lb of sharp cheddar  cheese. Next time I will 1/2 the Velveeta and increase the cheddar cheese.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I will be making this  plenty of times this year. I used half and half instead of milk , doubled the cheese, and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as per instructions with the following exceptions: cheddar cheese instead of loaf, 2 chicken bouillon cubes with the chicken broth and fresh broccoli. It tasted delicious in a bread bowl too!

Absolutely fantastic! I had to tweak the recipe, a little, as I was doubling the recipe, but the pot wasn’t quite big enough.

replace the corn starch with 2 small potatoes or 1 large potato. It turns out much better.

I made many of the changes other reviewers did: I doubled the cheese, used 2-3 pounds of fresh broccoli chopped, used half and half instead of milk and added no water. I also puréed the onions and butter after cooking as some in my family don’t like their texture, but I like the flavor.

Awesome and easy. I used fresh instead of frozen broccoli just because I had it, and a couple of garlic pods minced and added to the onion. Didn’t have corn starch so I went with another’s suggestion and made a roux with flour in the butter instead. It was just a bit soupy for our taste so I added in just about 2c of cooked rice to chunk it up a bit.

Made this soup but I used fresh broccoli and added some boiled cut up chicken, it was delicious! It was very easy to make and I used the corn starch with 1/2 cup of water and it turned out amazing. Thank you so much!

I agree with the many other reviewers who say to double the broccoli and the cheese!  I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower instead of frozen, because I needed to use up stuff in the fridge.  Added a couple chopped garlic cloves in with the onion at the beginning, and skipped the garlic powder that's called for later on.  I didn't have corn starch but I thought it was acceptably thick even without it.  Definitely delicious.

So easy, so good,  my wife absolutely loves it. I added the mushrooms,  and it was awesome. 
I look for simple recipes with few ingredients, and that's what this is. Great recipe. You could also add other things to this if you wanted, not just mushrooms,bit carrots, celery, etc. 
I just use through recipe as written, and sometimes add the mushrooms . GREAT recipe!

Easy to make and excellent! I halved the soup but went heavier with the broccoli. At the end, I still found I preferred more. Since I had the broccoli on hand, I steamed about one cup more in the microwave - perfect amount now! While at the store, I found an 8 oz bag of 'Velveeta Shreds'.  First time I ran across this, and it was the perfect amount for the halved soup, with no cutting up the cheese or having too much leftover. It melted beautifully, too. In place of the milk I used non-dairy creamer. I cut back by half on the butter with no problem and added some onion powder and black pepper.  I also cut back by about half on the cornstarch mixture, and the thickness of the soup was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe which I will surely make again!

I think if you follow the recipe as written you will be happy, but I changed mine to suit my taste and ingredients on hand.  It came out yummy.
*I used half milk and half heavy cream (Half&Half)
*I cooked fresh broccoli
*I reduced the onion a bit, I don't like an obvious onion flavor
*I reduced the cheese block a bit and added shredded sharp cheddar.

Great soup. I use grated cheese instead of the cheese product. Sharp, old, smoked, marble. Every time it's a different cheese. The smoked old cheddar was the best so far. Mmmm

Loved it! The butter isn’t just for the onion, but the soup as a whole. I also questioned, but I always follow the recipe 100% the first time. This is excellent as is. I will add  more broccoli next time as a personal preference, as I love big pieces in there. I’ll add some salt and pepper too, a total comfort food with a side of toasted French bread!

I have made this exactly as the recipe reads and everyone is very happy with the soup. The only thing that I ended up doing is using two boxes of 32 oz broth which only increases it a bit, and at least doubled the broccoli because we love it !!
(Actually I have made it more times then I can remember:)

Very tasty! I made a few changes:
* Only 2 cups Chicken Broth
* 1/3 Cup Corn Starch mixed with 1/2 Cup Water
* 1 tsp Garlic Salt instead of Garlic Powder
* Pureed the onion/broccoli mixture using a stick blender before adding cheese, milk, garlic salt and starch

Very easy double batch in full size crock pot. Toss all ingredients (but water & corn starch) + Mushrooms / Wine / little ham or bacon ends and let go on high untill melts. 

Let simmer on warm until 1/2 hour before serving: Add corn starch slurry as needed at that time to thicken as needed.

This soup was very delicious. We don't care for onions, so I used onion powder in place of the onions. The soup was a little thin at first so I added a little more cornstarch.

I added some spices (cumin, paprika, salt and pepper) and just shredded some cheddar instead of the processed cheese (I just don't have any).

Fabulous.  I was concerned about the cayenne pepper, but the flavors are well blended, and a delight to eat.

I added the mushrooms as suggested because I had some in the fridge that needed used up. I wish I hadn't. The flavor was too strong. Otherwise, I followed the tips of others and increased the amount of cheese as well as added fresh garlic. This soup is a winner, and it paired nicely with a baked potato.  I will definitely make this again...just not with the mushrooms!

If you don't use Velveeta, I would suggest adding any real cheese at the very end, after the corn starch, when the soup is smooth and hot, but not boiling.  Grate it and add it in gradually.  It only takes a minute.

It's not the best i've ever had.  But I don't cook that much and when I do it's hard to enjoy.  Anyways, I would recommend for children but not worth the 3 hours it took for me to make it.

Added my own twist to this soup, just the right amount of beacon and additional cream.  Now I won't go out to buy ready made..now on only homemade.

I took suggestions from other reviews and used broth instead of water with the cornstarch , added more cheese because who doesn't love cheese and added a healthy amount of fresh pepper and salt.

THis was delicious!  Like others suggested, I cut the butter in half and added 2C of sharp cheddar. I also cooked it in a crockpot  couple of hours.  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent soup.  Thus was my first time making it. I made a few minor changes after reading the reviews on this recipe. I used four 14.5 oz cans Chicken broth instead of three. I cooked the broccoli for about 30 min to make sure it was nice and tender. Next time, I will use fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I used a whole stick of butter instead if 6 tbls. to sautee the red onion. I also added garlic powder to the onions because I had no garlic cloves on hand. I used 1 lb Velveeta and 1 lb cheddar cheese. It could not have turned out better. My family ate every bite. I'll definitely be making this soup many more times. My family loves Panera's broccoli cheddar soup and this is almost identical.

I only gave 4 stars because I altered the recipe a bit, but this recipe makes a great start. I did what others had done by using way less butter and sautéed fresh garlic with  the onions. I also only added 3 cups of chicken stock along with 3 heads of broccoli (I wish I added another). Instead of milk and processed cheese (ew), I added 2 cups of 18% cream and 2 cups of shredded old cheddar, and only 3tbsp of cornstarch with just enough water to mix in a cup and added it to the soup.  I added a dash of nutmeg and pepper to taste and pulsed it a few times with a hand blender just  to break up the large pieces of broccoli. It tasted amazing!

I only had a carton of chicken broth (4 cups).  It was the perfect amount with one pound of processed Velveeta and one cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I blended half of the soup in the blender and didn't need any cornstarch or flour. I did mince two cloves of garlic and cooked that with the onions in 4 tablespoons of butter in addition to the garlic powder. It was restaurant quality for sure. Delicious.

As others have mentioned the soup was thin so I followed the process and ingredient list but had to look up what constituted processed cheese food and substituted a mix of freshly grated tasty cheese and 1/4 cup Parmesan. (to a total cheese content of 500 grams roughly 1 pound)  I doubled the Broccoli  using two good sized heads of broccoli. Some had suggested it had more a stock taste than broccoli so i only added 6 cups of stock, whereas 14.5 x 4 = roughly 7/8 cups of stock. I added 200 mls of the milk to the cornstarch instead of the water and a cup of light cooking cream that guarantees it wont curdle when heated. no other liquid and my hubby loved it and came back for a second helping.

I read the reviews and I used 1cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. I used about 2lbs of fresh broccoli instead of frozen. And I used white cheddar cheese that I sliced and put in at the end. As I said minor changes. This was awesome! We had two bowls each and my son had croissants with his. This will be made often, thanks!

I made this for company and it was finished before everyone came over, so I left it on summer to stay warm - well, I thought it was on simmer. It was really on high heat, though, and it had a skim and the broccoli was burnt when I served it. I was a little disappointed in myself but the recipe is great.

This came out great, I altered using 1/2 velveeta and 1/2 medium cheddar. Next time I will use 1/2 the cornstarch as it came out too thick for our taste.

I've always loved broccoli cheese soup, however, this recipe (even though I followed it to a T), did not turn out well for me.  Not only did I end up with clumps of cheese that melted but then once it cooled, some  of the cheese hardened into clumps, but the onions itself was so overpowering, I ended up tossing it.  It was disappointing to waste such good ingredients (and cheese is not cheap!).  My kids love broccoli cheese soup but they would not even touch this soup with a 10 foot pole!  Ugh.

This is my absolute favorite broccoli cheddar soup. I added about two more cups of chicken broth than it called for because it wouldn't have been enough for my family of four. It was phenomenal! Everyone went back for seconds and thirds. This has always been one of my comfort foods, but this recipe in particular is the best I've ever had. Yum yum.

I doubled the cheese and broccoli, per other reviewers suggestions. And it was delicious! But I think as is, it would have been to watery.

I doubled the recipe and added some fresh garlic with the onion. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. Both of my kids love it and I thought it was delicious!

Was pretty good. Would use others' suggestion in using twice the cheese and twice the broccoli next time. I used half and half instead of milk.

I cut this recipe in half to satisfy my 16 year old's late night craving for broccoli cheese soup, for a smaller portion and quicker fix. Given this was an unplanned, use-whats-in-your-pantry, late night effort, I think it turned out very well.  A little salty, but probably because I substituted half the Velveeta with Cheez Whiz, as I did not have enough cheddar/Velveeta on hand, used canned milk, and added a tad of Worcestershire sauce.  My go-to recipe has been copy-cat Panera Bread recipe, but honestly this was much easier and very close to just as good!  Creamy, warm, very tasty and delightfully satisfying.

VERY GOOD without a lot of fuss. I used half and half instead of extra water and left out the cornstarch. Next time: low sodium chick broth, as the Velveeta has a lot of sodium.

Really good!

This is delicious! I made it as directed, except with a cup of half and half. I would suggest following the recipe the first time as is. I would probably like a little more broccoli.  I was going to make a white sauce  with flour to thicken the soup,  but I'm glad I didn't.  The texture was smooth  and just  right with the cornstarch and it was easy to blend.  This is a great recipe!

I did make a couple of minor changes to this recipe.   First off, I used fresh broccoli and second, I used one pint less chicken broth.   Other than that and adding in pepper, I followed as written.   I thought the consistency was perfect for how we like it (using 1 pint less) and it was super smooth and creamy.   The flavor was good, but not over the top.   It was easy to make.

Too much onion, for my taste. And it does come out watery. Not sure if I need more cream/milk, or a different or more cheese. Yet, taste is there.

I did cheddar instead of processed cheese. The process cheese probably melts more smoothly. It still tasted delicious though.

This was a pretty good recipe! My wife is a Vegetarian so I substituted a vegetable stock and put some more salt in it and it turned out just like my moms! Also, instead of corn starch I used flour and made a roux. It makes it more creamy!

I made this recipe with some adjustments that others suggested. I used shredded cheddar cheese and while most of it melted, some stuck to my broccoli which made the soup mostly liquid with broccoli and cheese bunches. The flavor was very good so not sure what I did wrong. If I make again, I will cook the broccoli separately and add it after I add the cheese. T

This  soup was wonderful!  I did adjust the amount of cornstarch to about 3 tablespoons and 1/2 cup water.  Also, I use half and half instead of milk, but this is to die for!  I'm sure if I were ever in the position of getting divorced, this soup wold reverse the entire process!

This is a delicious soup!  My entire family enjoyed it and my 7-year old asked to have it in his lunchbox the next day!  I used a mixture of grated cheddar and Monterey Jack because that is what I had on hand and also used fresh broccoli because I didn't have frozen.  Absolutely delicious and will keep this to make again.

Oh my Goodness! What a great tasting  recipe. My newly 8 year old love the one from Golden Corral and according to him it taste just like it. I did chose to grind down some of the broccoli so the 4 and 5 year old would eat it... they loved it as well.

Really good soup for cold winter night. Be sure to use Velveta type cheese and not shredded block cheese or packaged shredded cheese, these types do not melt into the soup mixture well. Spoken from experience. However, all tasted great!!

Amazing! I have made this soup 3 times now and it is great. I had trouble finding a 16 oz bag of chopped broccoli so I just bought a 16 oz bag of broccoli Spears and chopped them up myself. The soup comes out creamy and delicious every time!

The first time I made this it was good but I felt like it was lacking a little flavor.  The second time I followed the recipe but added 8oz of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I also held back one of the cans of broth and put the corn starch in that to add at the end.  The cheese gave it the flavor I felt it was missing and the broth cornstarch thickened it up better than the recipe.  I may just add 1/3 cup corn starch next time.

Very good, but not as flavorful as I would like. I think it needs a stronger cheese, but maybe that's the point.

Other than adding twice the broccoli and reducing the amount of garlic (both personal preferences)  it is wonderful!!! A friend suggested I serve it with Emeril Lagasse's homemade crouton (with homemade essence seasoning - google it) and it is to die for.....perfect for impressing company ??

This came out very well. The only change I made was to add a little real shredded cheddar in addition to the Velveeta it called for. I also used an immersion blender to chop up the frozen broccoli florets so they weren't so big. I will make this again!

Very good and simple to make, everyone loved it.  I added some chunks of leftover ham from Christmas and it was very good.  I would have added some celery also but didn't have any, I'll try that next time.  Excellent recipe.  Wasn't sure what the processed cheese loaf was so I just used velveeta singles from the local store, chunks would have been better so I didn't have to unwrap them all, lol.

Wonderful and easy recipe. 

I even swapped out Lactaid for regular milk and everyone loved it....especially my husband who is lactose intolerant ( I  shredded  cheese on the side )
I used a hand mixer to blend and smooth the the soup.  Mmmm mm!

I made a few changes: 1.  I added 2 stalks of celery and two small carrots (both diced) to the broth and cooked it with the onion. I then pureed it with my hand blender before adding the broccoli and other ingredients. 2. I also added 1 t of smoked paprika.  3. I could not justify the price of velveeta so I bought 1 pound of real american cheese slices. They actually melted into the soup base much easier than cubes of velveeta would.   The finished product turned out exactly what I wanted. A smooth creamy cheesey soup base with broccoli in every bite. Thank You!

Everyone loved this soup!! I used extra shape shredded cheddar cheese, and about 1/2 cup more cheese than the recipe called for. I will definitely be making this again but when I do, I will add some shredded carrots and I will run the broccoli through  a food processor just a bit to break it down a little, but not too much.

Next time I think I'll chop the broccoli a size smaller, and probably cut down on some of the fluids (I did add the 1 cup wine suggested in the opening). After all the reviews of doubling the broccoli and cheese I went for it, but next time I think I'll do what the original recipe called for to keep it a little bit leaner. It was really good paired with some crunchy bread!

I really really liked this.

I was hesitant about the Velveeta (Apparently my store doesn't even carry it in block form. I had to buy the generic equivalent, "Melting Cheez") but the flavor is wonderful. I also substituted vegetable stock because vegetarian reasons and it still turned out great!

Following Megan's comment, I doubled the cheese and did half and half instead of milk and I love it. I honestly wish I had added an extra bag of broccoli but apparently my pot is too small; I'll definitely double the broccoli next time. I also added a tablespoon of black pepper with the garlic powder but I'm a pepper fiend, personally. It added a nice heat but isn't 100% necessary.

This makes a metric heckton of soup! I put a ton of it in the freezer so I hope it keeps well.

It was yummy but there's def room for improvement.  Maybe next time I will use real cheese instead of fake stuff

I doubled the cheese to 2 lbs and used 2 packs of frozen florets.  I kept the chicken broth, water and corn starch the same.  Also I sautéed a bit of garlic with the onions.  It was yummy enough.  Idk if I'll make it again.

I am in Canada and perhaps I didn't use the right cheese..  I found 'processed cheese loaf' a little odd and thought it didn't sound right with that but did it anyway.  I found my soup very thick (too thick) which I didn't expect since someone else said it was too thin! and with the processed cheese I just couldn't eat it.

I love this recipe because it is so easy to make it gluten free!!! Velveeta and corn starch are gluten free, So this is a delicious option for those with celiacs. After reading the reviews I  doubled the cheese, used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, and it was AMAZING!!! This is now a staple in our home!

Quick and easy recipe.  Followed several of the recommended changes....used half and half instead of milk, doubled cheese and broccoli.  

Just as good as restaurant versions, if not better!

Will make again.

Really good.  It's a smooth soup that is a kid pleaser.  I can see experimenting with sharper flavours added to the same base and it still being delicious.  Very quick to make and velvety delicious.

We made this last night and it was definitely a keeper!! We made a little adjustment, we added 1/3 C of white wine with the broth and cooked it with the broccoli. Then we followed the recipe as it was. But at the end we put crumbled bacon on top of the bowl of soup. Yum!!

Used homemade stock made from Costco Rotisserie chicken. Added pink salt to bring the flavor up.  Used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of skim milk. Used fresh broccoli I steamed lightly instead of frozen. Added a little fresh cracked pepper and this soup is outstanding!

Everytime I make this soup, my husband renews his wedding vows.
Joking aside, 4-6 cloves of garlic, 1 onion, and a stick of butter until everything softens. Then I add a 3lb bag of fresh broccoli (from Costco) and 8 cups of chicken broth, and let that cook on medium high heat for 10-15 minutes. With a handheld immersion blender, I blend everything together. Then I add 1 lbs cheddar cheese. More cooking, more blending. I add a cup of milk with 2Tbsp cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Delicious. Every time.

Just made it!! Used fresh broccoli and added 4 small potatoes. Since I used fresh broccoli before adding cheese and milk I placed it in my Vita mix just a short pulse worked. Poured it back into the pot and added all the cheese and milk. I did not use cornstarch. I will make again for sure.

Pretty good! Added mushrooms at the same time I through in broccoli as other user suggested. I think it made it more tasty. I think I'll add less cornstarch next time. I like my soup a little less thick.

I used this recipe as a general guide.  I tweaked it a bit to add more veggies and fresh ingredients.  I normally use frozen broccoli but, on this occassion I used fresh.  I chopped up the crowns and shredded the stalks along with 3 medium carrots.   I sautéed some onion and celery in the butter/garlic and added the fresh broccoli.  I had homemade vegetable broth and along with 1/2 block of processed cheese I had about 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and used milk.  As a surprise addition I had 1/2 cup fresh pumpkin puree which I added instead of flour.  *I know- my recipe is quite a bit different and I could submit my own recipe.  However, when I use allrecipes.com I live in the comments.  This recipe is really good I just used what I had onhand.

Delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I was pretty nervous about using the "cheese product, but  it turned out so yummy.
Changes include:
1/2 chicken and 1/2 veggie stalk
Added 1 finely shredded carrott
Combined chesees and milk in a separate pan before adding to onions and stalk.
4 oz cream cheese
3/4lb sharp cheddar cheese
Kept broccoli whole
Omitted water 
Used butter and flour mixture to thicken.

Me and my grandma make this a lot, and we tried probably 3 different recipes before using this one. It was by far the best, and every time we make broccoli soup we use this recipe. The last time we had it we accidentally added a little too much garlic but that was on us. 100% reccommended

This is fantastic. I added some shredded chicken but other than that followed exactly. The chicken helps make it more filling and doesn't make you feel so bad eating multiple bowls.

Nom Nom Nom this was so good.  I shouldn't have cut the broccoli so small and I used half Velveeta and half extra sharp cheese.  I also added half a beer and some red pepper flakes for a bit of spice.  And, I cut down on the butter.  I think I only used 4 tbsp and low fat milk.  It's creamy and delicious!

A real "comfort food" , delicious soup.  Changes are not really needed, but I had some fresh broccoli that I used instead of frozen.  Also, we do not care for processed cheese so I used grated cheddar Cheese.  I think it gave.it a much better flavor.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  A "keeper".

I always follow comments before I make a dish and this had me licking the bowl!!! I used 3 tablespoons of butter and sautéed the onion, garlic, and carrots. As suggested by another commenter I used 6 chicken bullion cubes crushed up and added to the butter and onions. I added the broccoli and let it soak in the flavor and added 6 cups of water. I sprinkled some salt and pepper on it and I let that simmer for 10 minutes and added 1 lb of velveeta cheese and a handful of shredded cheddar. I wanted to save some shredded for the top so I added 2 extra slices of mild cheddar I had in the fridge. Once that was melted I added 2 cups of half and half stirred it up and did the recommended amount of corn starch. This was better than any restaurants broccoli cheese soup and I will be making it again!!!

Wow. It was already good before I put in the milk and debated adding any. I even left out the butter, instead substituted chicken fat and stock.

Definitely amazing.  I have used a lot of recipes on this website, but this might be my new favorite.  I, as many others, doubled the cheese and broccoli. Used a loaf of Velveeta Extra sharp cheddar. I also used a tablespoon of minced garlic when sautéing the onions and another tablespoon of garlic powder at the end. I used the 4th can of broth for the corn starch instead of water. Turned out great!  Next time I will include more of the broccoli stalks to give it a bit more crunch.

My daughter is a vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also added a can of cream of celery soup, and used flour instead of cornstarch, and this recipe is definitely a keeper! So delicious served with cheesy breadsticks.

This is by far the best broccoli cheese soup we've made. we added a little extra cheese and served in a bread bowl (topped with shredded cheese) it was awesome! I let the broccoli and onion simmer a little longer than suggested (to let the bread cook). Not sure what that effected in the end result but it was amazing!

What does one do when the kids don't shut tight the deep freezer in the basement?  You get creative!  Two bags of frozen broccoli, now thawed need salvaging. Broccoli cheddar cheese soup!  Began with two sticks of butter, minced onion, parsely, rosemary, garlic salt, sate, and the broccoli sauteeing. I added 49.5 oz Chicken broth and simmered.  Added the pound of velveeta, shredded sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, milk and a brick of cream cheese. It is smooth!  Great with a beer!

If you use Velveeta, this is a good soup. Good flavor. But do not try to substitute real cheese.  just makes a really big clumpy mess.

This recipe was just what I was looking for, a broccoli cheddar soup that didn't taste like broccoli in cheese sauce.  It is creamy and yummy.  It did go against the grain for me as I don't usually cook with process cheese but I broke the rule this time and I have no regrets.  I read the reviews first and then I made my own changes according to the size of family I have.  I used 1 medium onion, sauteed oil soft.  Chopped up one large stalk and head of broccoli, added to the pot.  Covered onion & broccoli with 900mL of no salt chicken broth, simmered.  Cubed 450g process cheese (velveeta) and added to pot.  Added 1 cup of 18% cream. Then thickened with 1/3 cup cornstarch mixed with ~ 1/4 - 1/2 c water.  Continued to stir until starch flavour was gone and soup was thick.  Served with grated cheddar on top.  Delicious!!

If you follow the recipe it will not be too thin, but very thick so I did add an extra cup of milk. We also replaced the onion with a table spoon of onion powder. Great recipe.

WAY too much chicken broth and corn starch. Came out tasting like a thick chicken broth with some cheese and broccoli as opposed to the other way around.  Recommend lowering amount of chicken stock, replacing with milk, and adding a little more cheese (used 1lb block of cheddar and cubed it).  Also, I couldn't get the cheddar to completely dissolve into the broth so the consistency was very funny along with the amount of cornstarch added. Would do 1/3 instead of 2/3 and add more if needed.

The Soup is wonderful, but I made a few changes to it.  Instead of adding the garlic powder I incoporated one large garlic clove, minced. In additon to the corn starch,  I added 1/4 cup of flour after the onions and garlic are cooked until they are translucent., cooked the flour for about 3 minutes, then I added the liquids, and everything else.  It is a very yummy soup.

I liked the flavor of the dish, a lot! My daughter and boyfriend were also very pleased with it. I would give it a five star, but I had one issue. The taste we'd more than enough to sell it, so we all are up, but the texture was a little funny. The cheese and the rest never truly mixed together. I'm open to feed back on this one because I did make a change. Other reviewers said they had happily substituted real cheddar cheese for processes cheese food. None of them mentioned a texture issue. I used two packs of shredded cheddar cheese. I don't really like the idea of feeding my family process cheese food. Could this have been why the cheese stayed sort of separate? We liked it anyway, but I'd like to correct this.

This soup was just okay. It was rather thin.  I think it would have been some better with real cheese rather than Velveeta.  And it definitely needed more broccoli.

I made this for my family & they all loved it including my 10 month old! I made it exactly like the recipe with the exception of adding about a cup & a half of shredded monterey jack cheese to the final preparation as well as using fresh steamed broccoli crowns instead of frozen broccoli. We ate this with crackers then had leftovers with grilled cheese sandwiches & then poured over baked potatos! It is super yummy & I will be making this again!

I made changes b/c of the ingredients I had on hand. The soup was amazing and it would have been good as written, I am sure.  I used 1/2 a large onion, 4 cloves of freshly crushed garlic, 1.5 t of ground thyme, 1 tsp of celery salt, lots of pepper, 8 oz of Cabot seriously sharp chedder cut into cubes, and an 8 oz package of Sargento shredded 4 cheese mexican.  1/2 cup of half and half and a 1/2 cup of milk. I used an immersion blender before adding the milk and cheese.  And I only used a 1/2 C of corn starch.  2/3 of a cup just sounded like it might be goopy.   served it with Texas toast.  Cold rainy day in New England and this was just the thing!

I just made this super delicious soup. I chopped up garlic and cooked them with the onion and butter. I bought fresh brocolli and boiled it for a short time in water and drained the water out of it. I bought a large package of mushroms, sliced them up, and cooked them in the chicken broth until tender. I used velveeta and medium cheddar cheese, cut them up in small pieces, and melted that in with the mushrooms and broth. Added the onion garlic butter mixture and brocolli. Heated the milk in the microwave, etc. And mixed the corn starch in a cup of the soup mixture. Wa la!! So very good. Thank you so much!!

I used half of the cheese, a little extra broccoli, arrowroot powder and sprouted flour instead of cornstarch (and not as much), mainly veggie broth with some chicken broth, added Italian spices,  nutritional yeast and lots of black pepper. Everyone loved it..

Very tasty! Thank you for sharing. All of my children love it, but my 7 YO daughter requests this for her birthday dinner every year... and about every other night;)

I cut the recipe in half for a family of four and have some leftover. Perfect broccoli and cheese soup recipe! my only substitution was fresh broccoli copped up small.

Most of the time while eating this I was getting up to spit out chunks of cornstarch. That's disgusting. The flavor was good however.

I was craving something different (and so was the baby in my tummy) so I took a chance and made this. It was AMAZING! My 10 month old couldn't stop wanting more and my hubby had 3 bowls of it. I did tweak it a bit...first of all I changed it to 6 servings instead of 12, used bullion cubes instead of canned stock, fresh broccoli, substituted milk for heavy cream, regular flour for cornstarch (whipped flour and cream together and added it) and a cup of shredded cheese at the end.

Really good with a couple alterations. I made a rue with 1/2  cup butter to 1/2 cup flour, instead of cornstarch. Added 3-4 cloves of minced garlic to the onions. 2 cans chicken broth, and a jug of chicken stock. 1 can of evaporated milk instead of plain milk. Real cheddar cheese.

I have never been able to successfully make broccoli cheese soup.   But with this recipe,  I nailed it!  My family raved.   I used gluten free broth so my friend that has celiac disease could enjoy it.   This will definitely be made again. !!  I made this exactly like the recipe.  It took a bit, but it thickened up very nicely.  I only added pepper.  The velveeta melted very nicely in the hot broth.  Home run recipe.

Great recipe! Since I made it in my crock, I eliminated the need for butter. I simply tossed everything in the crock raw and it came out tender and delicious. One major difference that I did was to add a tablespoon of steak seasoning to the broth. This gives it a little bit of a zip. My family enjoys this soup especially tonight since the temperature is below zero and the winds are howling outside. Thank you for your fabulous recipe!

I probably didn't need to modify this recipe in any way but I couldn't help myself and did just a tad bit. I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and a 1/4 of a large bell pepper with the onions. I also used half and half instead of regular milk and reserved some of the broth to use instead of water for the corn starch. For the cheese I used Velveeta. Came out soooo good!

I did not make any changes this time but next time I will add more Broccoli.  The soup is very good just needs more Broccoli.  I may thicken it a bit but all in all it is a good recipe.  Thank you.

I like the flavor but too much liquid. Next time I will have 2/3 the broth, a bit more cheese, and keep the rest the same. This is one of the best Broccoli Cheese Soup recipes I have had.

I used real cheddar cheese that I added at the end once I turned off the heat (not a fan of that other cheer stuff). I added fresh garlic in with the onions. I also added salt and fresher cracked black pepper to taste at the end. Everything else I followed the recipe. It's pretty yummy soup. Will make again I'm sure.

Just made this. It's "souper" good! I did add the extra broccoli and cheese like others mentioned and instead of milk, I used fat free half and half. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!!!!

Between 6 people, we finished an entire pot and all wanted more. I used the recommended mushrooms and a cup of Chardonnay, which added layers to the taste. Took a chance and made it in a slow cooker, and left it for about 5-6 hours, which made the broccoli really tender and amazing. Substituted flour for the corn starch, and used 1:1 mozzarella and cheddar instead of the processed cheese. Definitely will make this again. Easy, good for a slow cooker, and mouthgasm-causing.

Instead of chopped onions I used dried minced onions about 3/4 cup. (I thought I had some but works out better so my 10 month old won't chop down on an onion)  I also doubled the cheese and broccoli. My family likes lots of flavor so I doubled the garlic, added about 2 TBS  of pepper, 2 TBS, 3 TBS of chicken powder  and 2 TBS  of adobe seasonings. It came out fantastic. I followed the recipe but it was lacking flavor.

I used fresh chopped broccoli. This started out great. Once I added the cheese, it turned chewy as it stuck to the florets. Still tasted great. Once refrigerated it was one big chunk of garlicy broccoli. I think this could be awesome without adding any starch at all, and using some American cheese mixed with cheddar. Mom & Gpa liked it though.

I halved the recipe and accidently still used 2 cups half and half.  I sautéed the onions and one finely chopped carrots with one tbsp butter and one tablespoon EVO.   I used a large garlic clove, and made a flour and butter roux using 5 tablespoons each.  I add a shake of mustard powder and dash of Worchester.  The Worchester is key.  Still creamy and delicious.

I added a pinch of salt and white pepper to taste at the end. I also used real shredded cheddar vs. the faux cheese and it was amazing. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe! We used 1/2 c. flour (instead of cornstarch)  with the last cup of broth to thicken soup-The only cheese we had was 12oz finely shredded sharp cheddar.  This soup is absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love the soup. Next time I'm going to try 1/2 an onion and less garlic as they seemed to overpower the other flavors a bit. I will also be using white wine in with the onions and butter as well as velvetta cheese instead of sharp cheddar

This was delicious! Even my kids ate it, and they're scared of vegetables. Only change I made was to add another 8oz of Velveeta.  This recipe does make a HUGE amount though.  Next time I make it I'll cut the recipe in half.

Had to troubleshoot a lot to get this to taste good for me. After I had gone through the recipe the soup was very thin and barely tasted like cheese at all so I roughly doubled the amount of cornstarch & water and added a quarter of a bag of shredded cheese (because I don't generally have excess cheese "product" just kicking around in my fridge). After that I still had to add salt and pepper to make the soup more savoury and less sweet for my liking. In the end I still have a soup that I will probably eat most of, but it took me almost an extra hour trying to figure out where I had gone wrong when it turned out that I hadn't gone wrong at all.

FANTASTIC soup!!!  We have made it 4 times in the last 2 weeks.  Only change (to fit our taste) was to cut the amount of garlic powder in half.

Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe!!

This was a very good recipe.  I changed it up just a little:  I added about a teaspoon of black truffle butter when sautéing the onion, used a white velveeta cheese, and added more garlic than it calls for.  When it was served, I shredded some smoked cheddar over the top.  Everyone loved it!

I've made many broccoli & chedder soups in the past, this is by far the BEST! "YUMMO" (as someone well known,  has been heard to say-lol). I also tried changing the regular milk to 1/2 & 1/2 - making it MUCH richer (you can also use fat free 1/2 & 1/2).Soo creamy  & rich.

Amazing with a few tweaks!! I added 10 chicken cubes (instead of chicken broth), 29 ounces of water, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 1 whole velveeta cheese (2lbs.), 1 quart and 2 cups of whole milk, and one can of condensed milk.  1 extra pack of steamed broccoli after soup is cooked to add some chunks of broccoli.  AMAZING!!!!

Thought it was super simple and delicious.  But, I, of course was the only one in my house who would touch it… lol.  Anyway, I used 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 Velveeta; fresh broccoli and doubled the amount.  A dash of Worsteshire.  I blended 1/2 the broccoli mixture before adding the cheese which thickened it very nicely.  I did not use water.  Quick, easy, yummy.

This was absolutely wonderful. I used heavy whipping cream (it's what I had) and poured it into  a sauteed onion and flour mix to thicken the soup. I also added carrots and potatoes because I needed to use them up. I cooked it in the crockpot. My children were leery, but once they had it, I had to sneak a portion out or I wouldn't have gotten seconds!

Great soup! Reminded us of Panera Bread Broccoli Cheese Soup. Quite rich & heavy we just used nonfat milk, definitely eat a small portion. Sprinkled onion-garlic croutons on top, & served it with chicken & lettuce wraps. 
Thank you for the recipe.

I made this last night and it was AWESOMEEEE! I also made a few tweaks after reading the reviews. Here are the tweaks I made: instead of frozen broccoli I used 2 large fresh heads of broccoli and cut off the florets. I used 64 oz (or two 32 oz) of low sodium chicken stock & 2 lbs of Velveeta and 1 cup of freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese. I followed the cooking instructions exactly and the soup turned out amazing. I also added some fresh course ground black pepper and a pinch of sea salt. Garnished with scallions and more shredded cheddar!! My husband loved it. I will definitely be making this again!!

It was extremely thin and buttery even with only half the broth used (based on other's feedback). I used good quality real cheese instead of Velveeta so in all fairness, maybe that made a difference? Would not make it again.

Very yummy!! On the advice of others, I doubled the broccoli, used heavy cream instead of milk, and put in 1/2 lb. more cheese (total of 1 1/2 lbs.). Took a while for it to thicken up but it did after about 15 minutes with lots of stirring. I think the garlic powder added a wonderful taste! I will for sure make this recipe again.

I followed "Megans" advice and used half and half instead of milk and I doubled the cheese and broccoli. It was so good. My nephew was licking the bowl. My only comment would be that I think it calls for way too much cornstarch. Delicious soup.

I made a couple adjustments. I made a half recipe and added a shredded carrot. I also used aged cheddar cheese and reduced the amount of cornstarch and water. Delicious! Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Delicious! In reading the other reviews, I made a few changes. I added fresh minced garlic with the onion, and used 3 cans of the broth to cover the broccoli. I mixed the corn starch with the 4th can instead of using water. Love it!

So easy, so good & the best part was I had all the ingredients on hand...took it to a church potluck and came home with an empty crock pot. The only thing I added was two medium carrots, shredded and cooked with the broccoli.

Everyone has a way of adjusting a recipe to fit their taste (no pun intended). I used 90% of the recipe and sincerely appreciate it being shared. I used ½ and½ instead of milk and  added 10 ounces of frozen chopped broccoli. Also cut up cheese into small cubes too. I feel like I got my perfect recipe now.

I used the recipe more as a guideline. The changes I made were:  I used 3 finely chopped cloves of fresh garlic, a mix of whole milk and heavy cream, I used white (real) cheese, I added thinly sliced fresh carrots, and instead of using cornstarch to thicken it, I boiled a few potatoes and made them into a purée. I uploaded a pic. Very tasty.

This is a great easy recipe. I make it all the time, with a few minor changes. I think the recipe as written is a bit too thick, so I cut down on the cornstarch. Also, the garlic is very strong, and I like garlic, so I cut back on that a bit as well.

This soup is delicious! I made it for my mom and brother, and both of them liked it. The changes I made were that I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and I added some water to the chicken broth.  Next time, I will definitely use real cheese, but all in all, it was a good, mostly healthy soup.

I made several changes that I read about, adding double broccoli and cheese (I used fresh sharp cheddar), but this soup was really quite bland. I added garlic powder, but it didn't help enough. I won't be making this again.

I don't do "processed cheese food", so I subbed in real, sharp cheddar cheese that I grated. I also sauted some fresh, minced garlic with the onions in place of the garlic powder. With these changes, it brings this soup to a five star rating. And by the way, this is also great over a baked potato - yummy!

Great soup. I did make a few changes. I used veggie broth (daughter is a vegetarian), shredded cheddar cheese, half and half a little over two cups, and I added a ton of garlic we love garlic in this house, and carrots. I did not have a corn starch and since I was using shredder cheese which has a little flour. I used less flour and kind of a half n half with water n broth from the soup. I did not add my cheese until the very last minute. This is very important. if the cheese is added to soon it will drop to the bottom and make sure to lower heat before adding cheese.
Thanks

This recipe was helpful. I made a few changes. I added shredded chicken, carrots and potatoes. I also mixed the corn starch with a cup of half and half instead of water. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and fresh broccoli instead of frozen broccoli. One more thing I did, I used a pound and a half of shredded sharp cheddar and made my own chicken broth. AMAZING!

Great recipe. Added scoop of sour cream and handful of Mexican cheese to each bowl for added flavor.

I added twice the broth added yellow bell pepper and small shrimp.  I also used smoked cheddar cheese.  This was really good  chesse soup, I think the only one better was in a little truck stop in Green Bay Wis. On a fishing trip.  Humm good!!!

Omg yumm! Made this tonight after days of wanting broccoli and cheese soup but not wanting to buy the canned stuff or go out to eat. This recipe is almost perfect! I made a few changes (changes are after review) according to what others have said. This is the best B&C soup I have ever eaten, even my picky 9 y/o loved it and had seconds! We served it with parmesan cheese fococcia bread. * changes I made-  I cut up a small onion (about ½ a cup when cut), 3 cloves of minced garlic( instead of the garlic powder), and a ½ tsp of oregeno and sautéed it. Used 3 cans of broth, and 2 bags of broccoli, then let it simmer for 15 minutes while I cut up the cheeses. I used 1½ lb of Velveeta and 1 lb of Colby jack cut into tiny chunks. When the broccoli was nice and tender I took out the bigger pieces of stem and slightly pureed them then added back to pot. Added my cheeses until melted then added the milk. I let this simmer on low while I made my slurry (used the other can of broth instead of the water, highly suggest this!) And finished like the recipe says. After we put it into bowls we topped with a little bit of freshly cooked bacon pieces and served. Amazing! Will be using this recipe again!

The soup turned out thick and creamy; however, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder seemed a bit much! I will cut back next time.

used dried minced onion instead of nice fresh onion...because I'm a dolt and keep forgetting to buy onions...added them to the melted butter and 2 minced cloves of garlic..added the chicken stock, 1 pkg of frozen broccoli florets, a splash of worcestershire and 1/4 cup of sherry..mixed 1/3 cup of corn starch with some half and half..put it into a cup and topped it off with more half and half..added it to the pot along with one more cup of half and half on its own.. pureed the bigger broccoli florets a cup at a time in the blender..added them back and used 4 kraft cheese slices torn into pieces and half a pkg of kraft pizza cheese mix...stirred it all around until the cheese was all melted..added a couple shakes of montreal steak spice too...so delish!! I didn't use garlic powder or the extra cup of water..Will be doubling this recipe next time and freezing some single portions..I think I'll stick with the dried minced onion too..I know that I love it this way, so I don't want to mess around with it..I know my steps sound like a lot of work but it only took 1/2 start to finish

I have made this many times, I have always left out the onion all together (had a family member allergic) and it has always come out perfect.  Got my kids to start trying "little Xmas Trees" in a lot more recipes.

This made a somewhat rich, very delicious Broccoli Cheese soup. I marginally adjusted the recipe by using two fresh broccoli heads finely chopped instead of frozen broccoli and two fresh cloves of garlic minced instead of garlic powder.

It was delicious!  I also added the wine. The only substitution I made was add spinach stalks, just because I had them, I used real cheddar - not processed, and instead of cornstarch I thickened with potatoes. I pureed stalks and broccoli in the blender. I also added garlic to the onions while sautéing.  I like butter and cream and since I didn't have milk I used 1/2&1/2.  With a side of salad it was a complete meal.

Had some processed cheese on hand (not something I usually buy) and thought this was a good way to use it up.  It was eaten without complaint by all my children and the 1 1/2 year old ate 3 whole bowlfuls.  I still prefer recipes that use real cheddar but this was really quite good

This was a great starter recipe.  As many folks, I sometimes need to be pointed in the right direction and this recipe did that for me.  I made some modifications based on what I had in the house and my own personal tastes.  I reduced the chicken broth to one 48-oz container of low-sodium broth.  I added two cloves of crushed garlic to the sautéed onions.  I used three 10-oz packages of frozen chopped broccoli.  At the end of the cooking time, I made a few passes with the hand blender to smooth out the soup but not enough to eliminate the texture.  When it came time to add cheese, I used one half pound cubed processed cheese food and one pound of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  And to finish the soup, I added one cup of heavy cream instead of milk. The final modification was that I used potato starch instead of cornstarch to thicken it.   Yes, I know it’s not low-calorie or low-fat, but it sure was good.  Thanks for the recipe!

The basic soup was good but a little lacklustre for my family.  I zipped it up with a little Gouda and some cheddar as well as a bit of dry mustard and a shot of whorchersteshire sauce.  As well used a lot less cornstarch as the cheese thickened it up a bit

Loved it - with some modifications - I like my soup thick, but with slightly reduced cornstarch. I reduced the stock amount to 40oz total and added both the stock and 2 cups of skim milk in the second step. Right before I added the cheese I removed a few tablespoons of the liquid and stirred in 2 Tbsp of corn starch until smooth, then added that back along with cheese. used fresh broccoli added when the onions were almost done, added salt and pepper. Perfect and delcious - thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is delicious! I sauteed the chopped onion and broccoli in butter, along with a stalk of celery and a few carrots (chopped). Once the vegetables were softened, I added the garlic powder, a bit of ground pepper, and a pinch of salt. I added the chicken broth, brought it to a boil, and reduced it to a simmer for a couple minutes. Then I added the milk and American cheese, and stirred over low heat until the cheese melted. I thickened it with cornstarch and water, and added a pinch of saffron just before serving. I did not puree the soup. It was delicious!

Added two chicken bouillon cubes with the broth, used garlic salt (was all I had) and topped with grated Colby jack. Awesome! My husband is making "I'm so food happy I'm grunting" noises. Lol!

Easiest soup I have ever made.  I did however use heavy whipping cream instead of milk and both mild and sharp cheddar cheese.  To not have my cheese stick to my pot I actually used a grated spatula to keep the cheese off and moving.  This recipe is a big hit with family and the timing is perfect from start to finish 40mins.  I am turning into a foodie....my family is loving the recipes I keep using.  Thank you.

I made this receipt this evening. I only changed two things- 1.) used Fresh Broccoli and chopped it up. 2.) used 2lbs of cheese. Other then that I followed the directions to a tee and it was amazing!!! By the way it makes a lot, even for a family of 6. I have 4 boys and two girls, and I will have lunch for the next 5 days.

I thought the soup was too cheesy when I followed the suggestion to double the broccoli and cheese. I added bacon to it as well as the suggested Worcestershire to cut the cheesiness.

Used many of the recommendations....doubled cheese (half was a medium cheddar)...add minced garlic to onion at beginning...used half and half instead of milk plus added more broccoli. Loved it. Thanks!

Very good. I changed it to 24 servings. 
I will cut the butter in half next time. I added finely chopped garlic instead of powder...added shaved carrots...added mini bow tie pasta. I scooped out the big chunks of broccoli and put in blender, pulsed a few times so there weren't huge chunks of broccoli. Was tasty :)served with a good garlic cheesy bread.

Just made this yesterday for the first time.  I modified only a couple items using my judgement. Instead of 1/2 cup butter, which is a whole stick of butter, I used half of a stick. I used 32oz bag of frozen cut broccoli instead of 16oz bag, and I added 1 more can of chicken broth, as I do not like such a cheesy taste.   It came out delicious.  I will definitely make it again.

I liked this a lot, but thought it was better the second time when I used an immersion blender on the broccoli before adding the cheese. I used the shredded cheddar from the dairy aisle at the grocery, and it melted perfectly in about 10 seconds. Colama6, thanks for reporting that it can be frozen! I'll try that.

Soup was easy to make and tasted very good. I will need to reduce the garlic powder measurement as it tasted too garlicky for my liking.

Very good dish. I would add that I think it called for too much onion. I will cut the onion in half next time. However, I found it very rich and delicious other than the onions. I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a no fail recipe. My soup turned out just as I expected. Undoubtedly, this soup is fine as is; but, I added cubed new potatoes and chopped chicken to mimic one of my favorite Campbell's Chunky recipes. I saved this to my recipe box, and will be making it again.

This was very good. I followed the suggestions of previous reviews and used 2lbs of cheese, used fresh broccoli and garlic. I reserved 1/2 can of broth to combine the cornstarch with and omitted the water. Very good and thank you for the suggestions! Next time I may also use some cheddar and more broccoli. This was super easy to make as well.

Original recipe is good but a few modifications make it great! 

First, replace 1/4 cup of butter with 1/4 cup of white wine to the onion base. Double the amount of broccoli and add 1/2 cup of matchstick carrots. Replace 1/4 lb. of processed cheese with 8 oz. smoked Gouda. Instead of milk, use heavy cream. Finally, after all the ingredients are in, put half the soup in a large heat proof bowl and purée with a stick blender then return to the pot. (You could do this in a regular blender as well)

I don't have to tell you this in not healthy at all but it sure is delicious, rich, and creamy.

After I made the soup I placed it in the crock pot for 5 hours to make the broccoli really tender. I did not add corn starch until about a half hour before we ate it. Reason being I didn't know I was out of corn starch, and had to run to the store and get some. It did not make a difference, it thickened up just great! Best Broccoli cheese recipe I have found. My picky husband said it was the best he has ever had. I added some ground pepper, it just felt strange not to put it in there, so I did. Besides that, I didn't adjust the recipe and it was AWESOME!

Holy cow! I could DRINK this stuff! The only changes I made were doubling the broccoli and reluctantly doubling the cheese. I say reluctantly because I tasted it before adding more cheese and it tasted great and knew I shouldn't add more cheese because it makes it less healthy. Nevertheless, I added more cheese and oh my goodness! It was just wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have any stock on hand so I used water and a little bit of beer (about 1.25 cups beer and 6 cups water). I also doubled the broccoli and cheese, and the flavor and consistency were just fantastic. I also only needed to use 3 tablespoons of butter for the onion. Everyone that ate it was raving! I'll definitely be making this again.

This is fast, easy and delicious. It's a good comfort food and the best Broccoli Cheese soup I've ever had. I followed the recommendation of others and substituted half & half for the milk and used shredded cheddar because I had it on hand instead of cheese food. I was starting to make a different type of soup prior to finding this recipe and had butter, chopped carrots and celery in the pot before deciding on this recipe. The addition of celery complimented this recipe very well.

This recipe is awesome. We did make a few changes. We used a 48 ounce can of chicken broth instead of 4 cans. We also added 2 teaspoonfuls of minced garlic to the onions as they were cooking. We used 2 packages of frozen broccoli. We used 2 pounds of Velveeta cheese. This was as good as any I have had at a restaurant.

Excellent recipe. My family loves cheese so I doubled the cheese and broccoli  (recommended by some reviews) and added fresh garlic with the onion instead of garlic powder. Yummy!!!

First time make it and both my daughters and I love it. Easy to make and cheap.  Beats going to Panera and spending too much money on soup that only cost me $3 to make. Thanks.

After trying a different recipe for this using flour, I decided to go the cornstarch route. I used 32 oz of chicken broth instead of the recommended amount, used a can of cheese soup instead of the cubed processed cheese, used half the milk and half of the cornstarch. I dissolved the cornstarch in the milk and ommitted the water. It was marvelous! Next time I will use two cans of cheese soup.

This soup recipe is awesome!  I've made it two years in a row for a Halloween party.  This year I made a double batch in two large crockpots and they were scraped clean!  I only made a couple changes.... Instead of frozen broccoli I used 4-5 fresh bunches of broccoli, I like to use the florets and cut away the stems.  It really cooks down so when in doubt use more.  I used a full 1 pound box of Velvetta, and instead of water I reserve a cup of chicken broth to wisk cornstarch into for thickening.  I also use Vitamin D organic whole milk because it's what we use.  Everybody RAVES about this soup and it's SO easy to make.  Be sure to prep/cut up all your ingredients before you start because stirring frequently is important to avoid scalding.

I used some other reviews alterations, and some of my own. I add chicken to the recipe. When cooking the onions, I add the chicken-cook and cube-then follow the instructions. I also add minced garlic while cooking the chicken. instead of milk, I use half & half. I also use a reserved cup of the broth with the cornstarch. At the end add a bag of shredded pepperjack cheese as well. The entire family loved it!

This was really good and very simple I had broc. stems and a few florets that I saved from a fresh bunch. I chopped the broccoli into a little more than 1/4" pieces then boiled them with the melted butter and onion and chicken stock. Instead of garlic powder I used garlic salt with parsley because I used unsalted butter. The rest was the same ...it was so aromatic my two year old came over and asked to have some!

Best soup I every made.  Very tasty.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I put the some of the broccoli in the food processor when cooked then added to the soup again to finish.  This was great!

I'm giving this a 4 because if I had made it as written I wouldn't have liked it, which would really make it a 2 star but we have the benefit of lots of other cooks making the mistakes first and this really was a 4 star soup with their changes and I think next time I can make it a 5 star.  I halved the recipe but kept the broccoli and cheese the same.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and I used real garlic instead of powder.  Next time I will do 1/2 Velveeta and half shredded cheddar.   I had some leftover crumbled bacon from another recipe and threw that on top before serving and as we all know, everything is better with bacon and it well it was.  Can't imagine not having it there in the future.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I made a substitution of 12 oz. of cream cheese instead of milk.  It took longer to cook, but it was just as good.  Using the cream cheese meant I did not have to use the corn starch.  I also used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I have made it both ways.  Both are delicious.

Awesome soup! I didn't have enough process cheese & so I made up the difference with shredded Sharp Cheddar. Tastes amazing. Creamy & smooth. Just the right ratio of broccoli to cheese.

LOVED IT! Yummmmy! 
 I did make a rue with flour to add to the butter onion saute, that worked well instead of corn starch. I didn't add as much chicken broth, I used a food possessor to chop up some of the broccoli first, then added less processed cheese, added plenty of cheddar and half a brick of cream cheese, salt and pepper, and only 1 cup of milk. YUMMMMMY! Wish my belly were larger, cause I could totally have another bowl! SO GOOD!

Really good but it needs tons of black pepper! I made these modifications: I used fresh broccoli (a big crown), I simmered it for about 20 minutes. I also used shredded sharp cheddar cheese (no cutting needed), I only used two cans of chicken broth (all I had) plus one and a half cup of water mixed with some chicken bouillon. I used 2 cups of a mix of half and half, whole milk and heavy cream (again, that was all I had). I added the garlic powder and some fresh garlic as well, lots of black pepper, a dash of salt, some dry parsley, dry mustard and some Italian seasoning because I felt it was a little bland. Next time I will use heavy cream only and maybe add the right amount of chicken broth.

Delish! I was a bit concerned with the amount of butter BUT it turned out soo good, I will definitely be making this again! The only thing I did differently was putting the broccoli with a can of broth in the blender on the lowest setting for about a minute.

I am doing liquid diet with my wife for her surgery and made this, I have never liked broccoli or onions before, but after a week of not eating any solids this was great!
Only thing I changed was that I really chopped up onions and broccoli and sifted the soup after cooking.

I made this for friends coming over and they and I loved it. Made according to directions. Exactly like a restaurant soup which is what I was aiming for. I think the trick is the Velveeta which makes it blend better than real cheese.

This recipe was really good as a base recipe, then I just added some other ingredients. I only used 2 cans chicken broth and then an additional can of water, I didn't want the chicken to be overpowering and I can't imagine how watery it would be if I had added the 4th liquid. My husband and I really liked it, but will make it thicker next time. The 2 cans chicken broth, garlic and onion gave it really great flavor! I also added 1 Campbell's broccoli cheese soup, 1 cream of broccoli and 1 Campbell's cheddar cheese. It helped thicken it  a little more and made it creamier, I used velveeta block cheese and threw in a handful of shredded mozzarella for fun. Most of all love the onion, garlic and chicken broth added :) thanks!!

This turned out well. I will probably follow other reviewers suggestions of increasing the cheese. I used left over mashed potatoes to thicken the soup in the place of corn starch. I will do that again. Because I have dietary problems with milk, half & half, cream and sour cream... I will probably try yogurt in the future (made it with out the milk this time).

There were so many good ideas in the reviews that I read, I didn't really know how to make this soup. I used 6 tbs of butter., 6 cups chicken broth, almost double the velveeta, double the broccoli, a large handful of triple cheddar cheese, and maybe 1/3 cup cornstarch in 1/2 cup chicken broth. It came out perfect.

There is way to much chicken broth in this recipe, perhaps if you cut the broth in half you might get something good, but I wouldn't know

YUM. The only change we made was to use fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Fast, delicious, and easy. What a perfect recipe!

Amazing!!! It's a staple in our diet now. If you like a chunkier soup then try the Broccoli cuts instead of chopped. I haven't had a complaint yet.

We cannot have dairy so I substitute an equal quantity of our dairy free butter, rice milk in place of cows milk, and one 8 oz. bag of Daiya cheddar shreds. I have to add the replacement cheese at the beginning in order for it to melt by the time the broccoli is ready. It turns out really good though, especially for one who misses their former dairy life. My 1 year old especially loves it. Thanks for the yummy recipe!!!!

While the flavor of this soup was good, I found the texture to be chalky.  Next time I will use flour instead of cornstarch to thicken.

Perfect recipe! I've gone back to it many times, always comes out delicious. I have been doubling the cheese & the broccoli, just my families personal preference (we love us some cheese) Definitely not needed as the first couple times I made the recipe by the book and it was a huge hit.

Very easy and tastes great! I only used a 14.5 oz bag of broccoli but next time I'll add more broccoli. I put the leftovers in the freezer. Hope it tastes just as great later.

I made this as is and it turned out Sooooo GOOD! The only small tweek I made was instead of using 1/2 a cup of butter I used 4 Tablespoons of Margarine. My brother's girlfriend and I loved it.. My brother was iffy but it grew on him... And I have so much left over for the next few days... Definitely plan to make it again

I modified this to suit us, so I hesitate to grumble about the recipe, but it didn't quite work out how I wanted.  I did a roux instead of cornstarch and it never became thick, despite the fact that I've never had issues with a roux before.  There was also just too much going on in this soup for me.  I think I'd prefer this purreed and with less chicken broth.  Hubs, however, was perfectly content and is eating up the leftovers with gusto.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is amazing!  A few reviews recommended doubling the cheese & broccoli and I did the first time, but not the second time I made it. And honestly it was really good both times.  I did puree most of the broccoli to give it a smoother texture.  This is one of my new favorite soups!

This was great!  The only thing I didn't have was cornstarch so I omitted the water/cornstarch bit.  I found that if you pureed it and let it stand for a few minutes, it thickened up a little.  This is going to become part of our regular rotation :) Yum!

I basically used Serena's alterations.  Added some grated carrots, used fresh broccoli as well as the leftover bags of frozen broccoli I had around.  Mixed the corn starch into the half and half.  added cheese at the end.  Used anykind of orange cheese I  had on hand.  Combo of Mississippi State Edam Cheese and sharp cheddar.  It was easy and delicious!

This recipe was excellent!  I did replace the milk with half n half and I also used a little extra broccoli.  I added salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  I poured the half n half into a sauce pot and melted the cheese in there and then poured the entire mixture into the simmering broccoli.  Worked like a charm.  Took a hand blender to it right before serving!  Will absolutely make this again!

Great soup! I added some sautéed mushrooms which even my mushroom hating husband enjoyed and I used fresh steamed broccoli instead of frozen, because that was what I had. This made a TON of soup though! We had no hope of finishing this before it went bad, so I put half of the finished soup in a freezer bag, and hoped it would reheat well. It was frozen for about 2 weeks before I pulled it out. I let the soup defrost on the counter all day so it was just a little bit slushy when dinner time rolled around. I emptied the whole bag into my pot and heated it slowly over medium low heat, stirring frequently to help the separated soup mix back together.  By the time it was done, the soup had been heated very thoroughly, and you never would have known it had been frozen! I'm definitely going to add this to my list of freezer meals for when I have my second baby!

As others before me, I too, made some changes to this basic recipe.  I substituted 2 cans of cream of chicken soup for water and milk and also flour for corn starch.  Also added shredded carrots and chopped green bell pepper and used 1/2 a loaf of Velveeta and shredded mild cheddar.  If you like a chunky soup leave it as is. If you prefer a creamier soup, just put 1/2 of the soup in a blender and then combine.  This turned out better than expected.  Yum!

I followed the Recipe exactly and the only thing that needed changing was the amount of corn starch that was called for, it was way too much! It made the soup too thick. I had to add 4 cups of milk to thin it back out. But once it was to the right concistency it taste great! Will definitely be making this again!

This was delish! I didn't have quite enough processed cheese so threw in a small handful of cheddar cubes after I took it off the heat.  The best broccoli cheese soup I've ever had.

I have made this recipe twice now.  Followed the advice of the other reviewers.  Although I do put mine in the crockpot on low for the day, after I have cooked and followed all of the steps.  My hubby who loves cheddar broccoli soup has asked for this several times.

This was good but I'll definitely add more cheese next time. My 19 month old son even loved it and he's not a big fan of broccoli.

I used an immersion blender to make it smoother. Also, next time I would probably either omit the cornstarch entirely or halve it. It was a little gloppy, but the flavor was UNBELIEVABLE.

I was looking for a side to go with ham and cheese Stromboli. My 10 year suggested broccoli cheese soup. This looked like the most promising recipe. We were not disappointed, it was delicious. I did follow other reviewers advice and doubled the cheese and broccoli. I also used half and half instead of milk. I had problems getting it to thicken so I sprinkled flour on top and whisked it in. It still wasn't thickening so I took about 4 cups out and blended it in my Vitamix. It did eventually thicken up. Took seriously about 15 to 20 minutes. I don't know why. Worth the wait!

I also doubled cheese and brochilli. Next time I'm going to add less garlic powder. It over powered the soup to me. Maybe a tsp instead of tbls. But it was so good!!!! Deffinently comparable to chillis or panera breads

I thought this was a very good base recipe but needed a little something to make it great.  I ended up doubling the broccoli and adding a handful of sharp cheddar, and some parmesan romano blend.

I loved this soup. I did make some changes though. I adding chopped carrots, and some chopped frozen spinach. Instead of the corn starch I added potato flakes about 1 cup. The soup still seemed as though it was too thin so I added some cooked cheese ravioli to absorb some of the liquid

My husband loved this soup! He said it was the best soup I have ever made! I liked it but it isn't my favorite. I used all the ingredients, the only change I made was I put everything in the crockpot and let it go on low for a few hours.

This is my first five star review.  No tinkering with major ingredients, just a tweak here and there to meet dietary and personal taste requirements.  I made half a batch using fresh broccoli. Onions were cooked in 1/2 the listed butter.  After simmering 15 minutes, solids were strained out and chopped a bit in a food processor.  Half the powdered garlic was enough for us.  1/4 c corn starch was added to the milk then stirred in to thicken.  This would be a company dish with a garnish of grated Colby cheese and bacon bits.  Well, two out of three of us thought it was great.  My wife would have slurped it up in a restaurant but saw the Velveeta box in the fridge.  She said something about bad nachos at the bingo hall. My son and I gladly helped finish hers.  Maybe when the nacho memory fades we will let her have some of ours.

I would say those values for broccoli and cheese are the minimum. I think you can add extra broccoli and cheese both up to probably an extra 8oz each, if you want something that's broccoli-er and cheesier.

I found that the cornstarch needed a good 10min simmer after stirring in, to reach the proper traditional B&C soup consistency.

DON'T FORGET TO SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER. This recipe doesn't instruct you to add any, but after you've got everything in the pot, start tasting it for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste.

Sorry, but this soup basically tasted like heavily garlic flavored artificial cheese with a few pieces of broccoli. Perhaps it would be better with real cheese and without all of the garlic.

Used 7 cups chicken broth, 32oz Velveeta cheese cut up, mixed corn starch with 1 cup 1/2&1/2 and 1 cup milk before adding to soup. Topped with shredded cheese and freshly cooked bacon bits and Yummy !!!!! Everyone had seconds, it's really good!!!!

I made this soup for my family.  They LOVED it!!  My 6 year old kept coming back for more.  It was a sure hit with them. Easy to make; didn't take long to make either. Is an inexpensive meal to make with plenty of leftovers  Will be making it again.

It was really good but keep your salt and pepper shaker handy if you don't add it in the pot. Also, it takes a lot longer to make than it says if you don't have a food processor to dice the onion and the cheese.

I loved this recipe, very basic and easy and quick in my opinion. I have to admit I made some changes, I added Kraft Singles Slices for the cheese instead because that's what I had on hand. I also added salt, pepper, thyme and rosemary to taste. I also threw it in the blender after it was all cooked, then I returned the pureed soup to the pot and added some small chunks of ham. Hubby loved it :)

I doubled the cheese and it was thicker then Elmer's Glue. The cheese was the only thing I could taste. I could have saved myself the trouble by melting a block of cheese and serving it for dinner. I DO think doubling the broccoli and substituting milk with half and half is a good idea though. Other than that, I've made this several times for my family and there's always nothing left. DELICIOUS and perfect for a frosty day!

This soup is okay, but a little blase for me...however, you can use it as a good base or starting point for something a bit more flavorful.  I pretty much made it as written since I didn't have any half and half or other cheeses at home and was just trying to make something quick.  However, just the Velveeta definitely doesn't do it for me and I think I'll either add more Velveeta next time or add some grated sharp cheddar cheese like other cooks have suggested.  I used my own homemade chicken broth, but I like the idea of adding chunks of chicken to it next time.  I also used fresh broccoli which I think really helps, and I added salt and black pepper to taste, but it's still lacking some kind of seasoning.  This is why I think the sharp cheddar or possibly even some grated parmesean might help next time.  Also, I made half the milk evaporated milk and the other half 2%...I will definitely use half and half or cream next time.  I agree with other users to skip the last cup of water and just whisk corn starch into a cup of the hot soup instead...the soup is already too thin and kind of watery tasting without needing to add more broth.

Made this for a girl's night get-together and we all LOVED it!! There are only three of us, so I cut the recipe in half. Because I had fresh broccoli from the farmers market, I steamed it and then pulsed it in the food processor. Also used Queso Blanco processed cheese since that is what I had on hand. One of the girls said her mom used to make it with the yellow processed cheese, but she liked the white cheese better! This recipe is a "keeper." Just wish DH liked broccoli.

This was a great base for broccoli cheese soup. I made some adjusments. I added more cheeses like pepper jack , sharp cheeder,  1/3 cup of  Real Beacon bits  and fresh broccoli.

Excellent recipe. Is very important to disolve previously the corn starch in water or in will be very dificult to do while cooking.

I followed the recipe with no tweaks.  It was edible.  Way too much garlic.  Didn't taste much cheddar or broccoli.  I may try this again and double the cheese, double the broccoli, reduce the butter a bit, use half and half and either eliminate or greatly reduce the garlic.

It was wonderful. I used chicken broth from leftover homemade chicken soup. I also omitted the garlic powder. It was very thick so I might halve the cornstarch next time. My six year old asked if we could make this every night.

It was a hit. I'm a strict recipe follower not a chef so I tried it as it was written. I would have liked it a tad cheesier so I went outside the box and sprinkled some cheddar on it in my bowl. Yum and yum!

I have been trying to find a broccoli cheese soup that is relatively quick and easy. Here it is! I made this and then put it in the crockpot on warm. It's pretty perfect. I had a two-pound loaf of Velveeta I needed to use so we doubled the batch. My husband, who swears "soup is not a meal" brought this for his lunch for four days. We also took half of it to a neighbor. So don't double it unless you need to feed a BIG bunch. :)

needs to be thicker and by adding a can of cream of chicken or even celery soup it helps. Sometimes I throw in potatoes  so it serves as potato soup also.  

This recipe as stated is to thin but you can really tweak it to be better..

Hey Lady!? if you cook everything this awesomely delicious... Marry me?
 What can I say? it was absolutely a 5 star soup! Thanx for sharing.
P.s. I did cheat a lil though... I used a jar of "Cheesy Ragu double cheddar" to save a little time.. got every thing ready n' before serving I stirred in the jar cheese.. it cooled it down to edible.

This is a DELICIOUS soup.  However, to make it even better, cook FRESH broccoli and then mash it with a fork leaving some larger pieces but also mashing a lot of it very finely.

This is such a great recipe. We love it and it's pretty easy and full of flavor. First time I made it I didn't have cornstarch on hand and used flour...meh. Second time I had cornstarch and it was fabulous! Threw in some cauliflower as well as the broccoli. Tastes better than a restaurant version I used to love.

The second time I made this, it turned out kind of gritty. What I found out is DO NOT allow it to come to a boil or the cheese "breaks" The third time, I followed this rule & it was SUPERB!!!! I do not like mine so thick, so I backed off the cornstarch. Love, love, LOVE this soup!!!

I had an abundance of fresh broccoli from my garden. I didn't feel like freezing it and then using it, so I used it fresh. I tried to use an equivalent amount of broccoli as was called for in the recipe. The soup turned out delicious, but I prefer it a little thicker. So I added more cheese. Next time, I will add the extra cheese, plus replace some of the milk with cream.

Great soup.  I can't think of anything that really needs to be changed.  My preference might be for a slightly thicker soup when warm, but it was still a good consistency.

This was delicious. Not generally a fan of the processed cheese. Had a little in the fridge so I used what I had and used cheddar jack mix for the rest of the cheese. Also, made a roux instead of cornstarch mixture. This was amazing. A dash of nutmeg and to me it was the same as panera bread.. yum!

I doubled the cheese and broccoli like other reviewers suggested. Also used fresh broccoli and cooked in my crockpot for 4 hours. The flavors blended nicely. I used heavy cream instead of milk and vegetable broth to make this for a vegetarian. With my changes this was a 5. As written I give it a 4.

Usually, I make a recipe precisely the way it is written to be fair in reviewing it. Last time I made a broccoli cheese soup from this Website, I made it that way and my family hated it. So, this time, I followed the recipe, but also doubled the Velveeta as other reviewers had suggested doing. Holy moley, it is delicious!

Finally, I used fresh broccoli my husband had grown, gave it a rough chop, and it broke up well just from stirring the soup.

I initially halved this recipe because I thought no one else in my house would eat it because of the broccoli. I was wrong, everyone ate it, even my children that are notoriously picky! Next time I'll double it.

I've been wanting a good recipe for broccoli and cheese and I made this last week and it was delicious!!  The only thing I'm planning on doing the next time I make this recipe is add more broccoli, but other than that, no complaints.

I used fresh broccoli, and replaced two of the cans of chicken broth with 2% milk, then added 2 chicken billion cubes. My family and guests loved it and some of them don't care for broccoli!

Yum! I added a little more cheese :) than what recipe calls and used sharp cheddar . After adding cornstarch raised heat and started to thicken, came out very good. Next time will cut onions a bit smaller and cook them a bit longer so you can't really see them in soup.

The Best soup Cheese Broccoli that I made!!!!!!! Exquisite soup of broccoli to make for your family! Delicious and easy to prepare. I made some modifications, I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. I cooked the broccoli first and then I put in a blender to make a uniform mix.

The reason for 4 stars is because I will make changes from now on to this recipe. As written though it is very very good! Changes I will make from now on:
Will use heavy cream in place of milk, will use only fresh broccoli and will almost double the amount, will use 1/4 cup butter (1/2 is way too much and I don't even care how healthy it is. It is just un necessary), I will certainly ad more cheese. Most likely an additional 1/2 pound. I will update in a week when I make the next batch but I am certain it will be phenominal.

Definitely a MUSZT have recipe however. The possibilities with this are endless.

I just made this tonight and it came out terrific! I did make a couple of changes. I wanted a meal in a bowl so I boiled 2 bone-in chicken breasts and used the broth from that. I then added a little more water and several bouillon cubes. I followed the rest of the recipe as written except for adding the chopped chicken to the meal. For the milk, I used skim. Every little bit counts. Very good!

This soup was so easy and so perfect for a cold, drizzly night.  Easy enough that my 3 year old son could really help with everything involved!  I did make minor changes...I added minced garlic in with the onions...doubled the broccoli and cheese (per other reviewers) and used garlic salt and white pepper to season at the end. Very filling!  Will definitely be making this often!

This recipe tasted like what I would expect a traditional broccoli and cheese soup to taste like.  Based on reviews from other users I made the following changes:

Use 3 fresh broccoli crowns 
Used 1 Tbsp minced garlic
Double cheese (use whole loaf)
Use half & half instead of milk

Just made this soup for my family and it is delicious. My son that doesn't really like broccoli even loved it. This is a keeper. I did follow other recommendations and added more broccoli and cheese but I will definitely be making this again, Thank you for this recipe.

I tried this and was pleased that such a simple recipe could be so tasty. I also added a generous amount of fresh ground pepper, and 3 cups of steamed rice to the soup, and doubled the cornstarch to make it nice and thick. The rice really helped the soup be a 'meal' and made it more filling. I served the soup with big hunks of crusty bread for dipping during Monday Night Football. The guys were all stuffed. It was a hit!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my soup turned out perfect! This was actually the first time I had ever made broccoli and cheese soup. The consistency was nice and thick. Even though there are not many ingredents it was very flavorful! I will definitely be making this soup again! The only thing I would change would be to add more then 16oz of broccoli.

For the trifecta: delicious, hearty, and easy.  If you don't feel the need to change things, it works great as is.  I added a couple of handfuls of finely shredded cheddar, and I might add a little more broccoli if the mood hits me, but it doesn't have to have it.

Also, I found this looking for a recipe for someone who is on a pureed food diet.  I just used the hand blender before adding the cheese, and it turned out fantastic.  If you don't like chunky soup, trust that this soup works great pureed as more of a cream soup.

I tried this recipe for the first time for our church's soup dinner. It was amazing! I was complimented all night on how great the soup was. I will never eat the store bought soup again!!! I only made one change to the recipe. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder simply because I was out of the powder. Turned out amazing!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!! I only made a few tweaks to it: I added 1/2 cup of white wine, and since I didn't have cornstarch I used flour instead. Instead of using any water, I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and whisked the fourth can of chicken broth with the flour. Doubled both the broccoli and Velveeta cheese. It was PERFECT! I only ended up eating one bowl of it since my boyfriend devoured the rest of it, but I'll be making this again soon! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is outstanding. We did do a little tweeking of it to get it to where we wanted it. We doubled the cheese and doubled the broccoli, to make it heartier. And added a splash of beer for flavor. Thank you for posting this recipe, it was easy to make and tasted dynomite.

This was very good. I cut the chicken broth and milk in half and omitted the water. Others had suggested doubling the cheese and broccoli, but I didn't need that large of an amount. I mixed the cornstarch with the cold milk. I used 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp ground black pepper. I smashed the broccoli into tiny pieces with a potatoe masher so the kids would be more likely to eat it. They don't like broccoli, but really liked this soup.

This is My Favorite!!! Easy to double and freezes well too...I use Half and Half instead of milk and add a handful or two of shredded cheddar to it and double the amount of broccoli. So creamy and flavorful!

This was fantastic! I, like others, doubled the cheese and broccoli and used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of milk. I mixed the cornstarch with the last can of chicken broth instead of using water. I honestly think you could get away w/ 1/4 cup of cornstarch though and I plan on doing so next time. As much as I LOVE the taste w/ all that velveeta, I might try 1/2 velveeta 1/2 cheddar next time. After it finished cooking, I took my handy stick/wand blender thingy and pureed it until almost smooth. This reheated beautifully the next day and it reminds me very much of 99 Restaurant's broccoli & cheese soup. I have 6 children, and over half of them liked this so I call that a win!

I use the recipe as an idea of what to do.  I put my own style using:1cup of heavy cream, 1 1/2 cup of milk, also instead of chicken broth I cook first the broccoli and use the same water giving it a best flavor. Thanks

Thought this was a great recipe. I did not use onions, just used some onion powder. Also as others have suggested I used 1/2 and 1/2 and added an extra pound of cheese. Lots of compliments from it.

Great!  Very flavorful.  I was nervous about the 1 TB of garlic power but it's definitely not overpowering at all.  The only changes I made were: 1/3 c cornstarch & I pureed about 3/4 of the broccoli before adding the cheese.  I would definitely make this again!

Made this recipe exactly as stated. Would use less onion, less garlic, and low sodium broth as this was a bit salty. Other than that it was really good. My daughters love Broc Cheese soup and thank goodness I froze a couple bowls of it because they ate every bit of it the 2nd day after I went to work.

Fantastic review. 

I have done a white cheddar version of this, and I would like to try a monterey, and a smoked gouda cauliflower soup with bacon. (I did a casserole version of it-PHENOMENAL.) 

One comment I would make is the absurdity of using "cheese food," when there are plenty of creamy cheeses you can use. Even mild cheddar melts so beautifully, if done right.

I doubled this recipe for a Halloween party and not one spoonful was left over! I omitted the onion but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and it was delicious! Received rave reviews even from the kids at the party.

It wasn't bad..but it tasted a little funny to me. I did everything just like the recipe, but I was hoping it would be like Panera Breads broccoli cheese recipe. My hubby likes it though!

This was a huge hit for the family gathering. All the cooks wanted the recipe. The only thing I did different was par boiled the broccoli ;then run it thought the food processor for a finer texture. I also added some extra cheese
Can't wait to make it again.

Easy and delicious.  I wanted to make an organic soup so I used about a pound of a local organic medium cheddar and it turned out great.

I don't make soup very often but I was glad I made this one to celebrate the first snow day from school!  As another reviewer suggested I made my mostly in the crock pot.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  After 3-4 hours in the crock pot the broccoli fell apart and was very good!  I didn't thicken it with the cornstarch since I didn't have any :)  SOOPER good!

This recipe is wonderful!!! It reminds me of the Broccoli Cheese soup I get from a local cafe. It's wonderful. I did read other reviews, and doubled the Velveeta and broccoli, and replaced tge milk with half and half. It was a huge hit with my family. This one will become a regular in our home...especially through the winter months!!!

this recipe is super easy and very flavorful! Once, when I was eating at an Amish restaurant, they served a broccoli soup with very fine noodles. When I made this, I didn't have noodles, but I did add a large can of chicken noodle soup. I just used a little less milk and it turned out great! I will definitely make it again!

If you make this recipe you either need to double the cheese and broccoli or cut WAY back on the butter!  Sooo, dissapointed- it tasted like a stick of butter.

This soup was great!  It would have been a 5-star, except for the amount of garlic powder.  I cut the garlic powder to 1 tsp (instead of 1 Tbsp as the recipe called for), and it was just right.  I would also add pepper next time, as we all added a good amount after the soup was in the bowl.  A definite winner at our house for a chilly fall day.  Plus, there are loads of leftovers for lunches later in the week.

This is epic with a "few" changes. With the butter and onion we use fresh garlic & 3 chicken bullion cubes instead of chicken broth, 3 handfuls of baby carrots and 2+ pounds of fresh broccoli (mostly pureed with 4 cups water, about 1/4 of the broccoli chopped small), added one pound shredded cheddar, and used half and half instead of milk.

This was the BEST broccoli and cheese soup I have EVER eaten! The changes I made were I doubled the broccoli and cheese, I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I used half & half instead of milk. It was DELICIOUS and it made a lot! If you are a fan of broccoli and cheese soup, you have to try this one.

I used a mixture of fresh and frozen broccoli as it was what I had on hand.  I also used onion powder instead of chopped onion to save myself some prep time.  AMAZING!  This is my new favorite soup!

I made 1/2 recipe because I only wanted about 6 servings. I used low-fat dairy products, no sodium broth powder and added salt to taste, and frozen defrosted broccoli to save time. I accidentally used double the amount of broccoli, and it actually seemed to be the perfect amount. I liked everything about the soup, but it seemed like it was a lot of garlic powder. But, it wasn't too overpowering once blended. It just kind of reminded me of a soup I might get at a sub shop or food chain for some reason.

I made this last night and it was the best broccoli cheese soup I've made. I didn't add the garlic powder and cut back on the onions because I have kids. I added some leftover ham from Easter. Super easy recipe and my kiddos liked it.

This was an amazing success!  I only used about half the butter called for & added some chopped fresh garlic to the chopped onions.  I too used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.....it makes it creamier.  It was great last night when I made it but it was even better today at lunch as leftovers!  I will so use this recipe again!

Made this last night using 2 bunches of fresh broccoli that needed to be cooked.  Came out perfectly!  Hubs had 3 bowls AND my picky pre-schoolers loved it too!  SOOO easy to put together.  Will make this often.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is picky and absolutely hates garlic.  I made this soup tonight and he said that he liked the flavor.  I didn't have the heart to tell him it has garlic in it!  VERY good recipe if he liked it!

I followed another person's suggestion and put in half cheddar and half velveta. It had plenty of broccoli in it for me. But the finished soup was to salty. I also added some grated carrots for taste. Next time I make this I will most likely use all cheddar and fresh broccoli instead of frozen.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe (once tweaked).  My b/f and I tried this recipe previously and it was too cheesy, but we still liked it so we tried it again.  Before I started I boiled cubed pieces of two potatos.  Then I cooked the recipe as it normally is done.  After the onions were done I added corn and broccoli, then put 3 cans of chicken broth in.  I added the garlic and the potatos I cooked. Then put the cornstarch in the last can of chicken broth.  I added that to t he mixture stirred it for a little bit and YUM YUM YUM!!!!

Love this! I have made this several times and my family loves it. I have used both fresh and frozen broccoli and of course I had to stew the fresh broccoli longer. I also didn't add the water as most other reviewers suggested and it was perfect consistancy.

As a new cook and first time soup maker this was easy and turned out delicious!  As suggested by others, I sauteed fresh garlic in with the onions and added the cornstarch directly into 1 cup of the chicken broth.  I also used 1 pound of real sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  Mmmmm!

This is the first time I have ever made this. It was easy.  I did add extra broccoli and use 1/2 lb of process cheese and used 8oz pkg of shedded cheddar cheese.  I thought it was very good. I will make this again.

Very good & easy!  I used fresh brocolli & carrots that I steamed first then added to onion butter mixture once onions were soft.  Followed other steps then after the adding of milk but before the adding cornstarch I used my SUBMERSIBLE blender directly in the stock pot to blend carrots & brocolli!  Turned out great:)

This was a really good soup. I would like to find a broccoli cheese soup that did not call for processed cheese...you can taste the processed cheese and it takes away from the flavor of the soup.

This soup deserves a 3-3 1/2 stars, but gets a four for EASE of the recipe. I could not imagine making this without doubling the broccoli and cheese. I doubled cheese and broc, and I also omitted the water and mixed the corn starch in with the 4th can of broth and it turned out with a great consistency. I will make this again, no doubt, but with some more modifications; maybe the ones suggested by lovestohost.

Perfect soup... used real shredded cheddar instead of velveeta cause I don't like fake cheese.

Yummy! I took out about 80% of the broccoli and placed it in the food processor after it had cooked. This left just a few chunks of broccoli, but the soup was super creamy.  It was amazing.

Excellent and "souper" easy! I followed the recipe exactly, except used frozen onions to make it even easier- I just poured a little in- no measuring. My very picky husband and toddler son enjoyed, and the left overs were even better.

really yummy and tastes just as good with fat free chicken broth, 2 % cheese, and skim milk for a healthier option.

Awesome!  I made this broccoli/cheese soup for my wife and brother-in-law and they just raved about it.  So did I.  The Velveeta makes it.  Thank you.

A great classic broccoli soup.  Instead of cans of chicken broth I used 3 bouillon cubes and 4 cups of water, which turns out to be a little less than called  for.  I also substituted the cornstarch for an equal amount of flour and didn't mix it in the 1 cup of water, just sifted it right into the hot soup.  It was a little grainy in appearance but great texture and taste!

This soup was awesome!  My husband made this recently and based on other reviews, doubled the broccoli and velveeta.  He also cut back slightly on the butter.  It was incredibly rich, delicious and very easy to make.  We will be adding this to our weekly winter dinner menu!

This soup was fantastic.  I thought I was in one of our local family restaurants.  The only change that I made was to cut the butter in half and it still tasted fabulous.

this was really good!  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot.  I followed others' suggestions and used half and half, double the cheese, and chicken stock to mix w/ the cornstarch.  The corn starch didn't thicken it up as much as I would've liked so next time I think I'll use flour.  Definitely a keeper!

All I can say is "oh my goodness", made this tonight and it was awesome! I did decrease the butter to 1/2 cup and used a potatoe masher to break up the broccoli. Thank you so much Karin for this recipe.

I've made this wonderful soup a number of times now and it is the most flavorful broccoli cheese soup I've ever eaten. The first time I made it I used a combination of broccoli and cauliflower leftover from dinner the night before which reduced the cooking time by about 10 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T"  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

I made this with one block of Velveeta, and two bags of shredded cheese and it was still too soupy. Next time I'll do it with two blocks of Velveeta and the shredded cheese because I like it to be really cheesy! Aside from that, the flavor was great!! It made enough that we had a lot of leftovers that we put in the freezer to have for dinner sometime soon.

I put 1/2 in the blender for a different texture and it was perfect.  However, I still thought it a little bland and added a little cumin to it which gave the flavor a little more depth.

I really enjoyed this - used Velveeta light and Fresh broccoli, and I didn't use the whole 2/3 cup of cornstarch...I didn't have any problems with it being too thick - It makes a lot so I won't be making it again anytime soon, but definitely will keep it for the future.

I made 1/3 of the recipe and made a few alterations to match my preferences.  First, since I'm a vegetarian, I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock, and I used half of what was called for.  I also used an olive oil spread instead of butter, and reduced the amount I used.  I increased the onion from 3/8 to 1/2.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Instead of just broccoli I used a blend of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, and I used almost twice as much as in the recipe.  I replaced half of the cheese food with sharp cheddar, and used about half the milk.  I did not add cornstarch since I used less broth in the beginning.  The result was excellent!

OMG!!! Delicious is an understatement. I could only get 10 oz. packages of frozen broccoli in my store, so I used two of those packs which was great. I added minced garlic as others suggested because we like it. The wine was optional so I also added that. The rest was per directions and the whole thing was so very easy. I thought it was perfect, but my father would have liked more of a cheesy taste, so I'm making it again but trying it with more cheese. I will update, but it was fabulous with the one pound only. Thank you so very much!! Terrific recipe that I will be making again and again! Update: I tried about 1 1/2 the Velveeta called for to get a cheesier taste, but with no noticeable difference. If you really want alot of cheese flavor, you will need to double the cheese in the recipe, but I strongly suggest making it as it is written first. Still loving this recipe so very much! Thanks....

Absolutely FABULOUS! My husband who doesn't even like soup semi-reluctantly tried this tonight, and LOVED it! It makes so much, and we're looking forward to having it again this weekend- maybe in some sourdough bread bowls! :)

Easy! Excellent!  My husband and kids continually request this for dinner.  I have now made it 4 times and have been more than pleased everytime.  I bet it would be great in a bread bowl too!

My husband and I really liked this for an easy lunch.  It was fairly quick to make and reheats well also.  Only change I made was I used  1 lb fresh broccoli, and chopped it myself.  Broccoli is pretty easy and quick to chop.

Yum!! I made this with veggie stock (because I'm a vegetarian) and it was delicious! My husband ate two bowls and then asked me why I had never made this soup before. It was also nice that the ingredients were so cheap, this huge pot of soup with 10 or more servings cost less than $10 in groceries.

Wonderful soup! I've never made Broccoli Cheese before but it was great. I bought a mix of Broccoli/Cauliflower and added a small amount of flower/water mixture cause I don't like soup that is real thick. Other than that, I kept everything the same. I think I might try adding rice to the leftovers like one member suggested. Thanks!

My husband works for Bongards Creameries in Bongards MN.  We added 2 lbs of cheese and 1 carrot to the recipe it was to die for.  We reduced the servings from 12 to 4 but still added 2 lbs of cheese.  Loved it. :-)

Absolutely wonderful, the best recipe ive found. Like all the reviews say double the cheese to 2 lbs of velveta. I am not big on onion so i only used half of a small onion and put it in a food processor and used the smallest pieces it would make. Worked perfectly.

My boyfriend and I loved it! Even after i halved the recipe it made quite a bit of soup. I took the advice of one reviewer and saved one can of broth and used it in place of the water. I also added some shredded sharp cheddar on top for garnish. Aside from that i made no modifications and followed the recipe exactly.

Very yummy! I made it pretty much exactly as written, except that I omitted the onions and added cooked brown rice to it at the end to bulk it up a bit. A big hit :)

Just made this soup! It tastes great but I did do a couple of modifications. I did add 2 cloves of garlic and added that to the onion/butter mixture. I also added 3/4 lb of extra Velveeta cheese. But overall this is a wonderful recipe!

Very good!   I used a whole stick of butter and two cups chopped onion.  The only other change I will make next time  is to cut back a bit on the water to one third cup to make it thicker.  Yum! Update:  I just made this a second time and I only used 4 cups broth, 1/2 stick butter as indicated, and 1 cup of chopped onion. The rest I followed exactly.  Be careful to allow your cornstarch to dissolve completely in water before adding to pot.  Though this is  good as is, I think I will double the broccoli and the cheese amount next time.

Delicious!  This is a great basic recipe that adapts well to any individual preferences one has.  I added carrots, used homemade chicken broth and decreased cheese (needed it for another recipe and didn't want to go to the store :-)).  Thickened with milk and flour instead of cornstarch/water, and used about 1/2tsp garlic powder.  Will become a regular staple in our rotation!  Hubby loved it!!!!

Not bad..my first time making broccoli cheese soup.. couple minor changes.. used a 26 oz bag of frozen broccoli.. minced onion.. 49 oz can of broth.. after broccoli was soft I put in my food processor so it would not be chunky for my 2 year old. Used 2 lb block of velveeta 2%. Still not restaurant quality but not bad either!

Absolutely Delicious!  Followed some of the suggestions.  The first day we ate it as soup.  The second day, we added some brown rice to it.  It made a really great side dish to chicken.  Will definitely be making this again.

Turned out a bit thin.  Next time I'd omit the water and dissolve the cornstarch in the milk. I used fresh brocoli and onion powder.  Next time I'd add more broccoli and carrots too to increase the vegetables!

The soup was delicious, just what I was looking for. Made a few changes. Instead of doubling the cheese & broccoli as others suggested, I cut the broth in half. Used 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 3 Tbsp cornstarch with 1/2 cup water. Also used 1/4 tsp onion powder instead of onion since my husband hates onions. We loved it!

This was WONDERFUL! I made it exactly as written -except I used a bag of broccoli/cauliflower mixed- and if I absolutely *had* to make any changes the next time, because there WILL be a next time, I'd cut the butter and garlic in half. I can't imagine anyone giving this less than 5 stars. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is the best broccoli cheese soup I have ever had!  Very creamy, wonderful texture!  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers by doubling the cheese and broccoli, plus a bit of shredded cheddar.  Very, very delicious!

Perfection! Hubby loved it! I used fresh garlic (abt 6 cloves chopped) and sauted it with the onions. I also mixed the corn starch with one cup of the chicken broth instead of water. Mmmmmmm!

Easy to make. I doubled cheese and broccoli. It filled up my six quart dutch oven. Seems like it would feed more than 12. This got rave reviews at the large soup supper where I served it.

This is by far the best broccoli and cheese soup I've ever had.  Didn't need to change a thing.  I had gastric bypass in May, 2009 and struggle with certain foods.  I put the finished soup in the food processor to cut up the broccoli a little more and it is perfect!  I have no trouble with this one.  Thanks for the recipe--it's one of my favorites now.

Excellent! Will definitely make again, followed recipe except added double the cheese and broccoli.   (revision 12/11) Made using mushrooms, white wine & fresh garlic.  Also doubled the broccoli and substituted the water for chicken stock.  Very good.

This is by far the best Broccoli Cheese soup recipe I have found.  Like others, I made a few minor changes/additions.  I added a few cloves of minced garlic when sauteeing the onions and left out the powdered and I also added a handful of shredded carrots when I added the broccoli.  After simmering, I pureed most of the broccoli and carrots in a blender but left some chunks for texture.  I also used half and half instead of the milk as many had suggested.  I didn't have a block of velveeta on hand so I used a combination of sliced american and shredded cheddar/jack cheese.  The soup turned out thick and creamy and tasted wonderful.  It's great with a loaf of sourdough bread for dipping.  I'd put this recipe up against Panera Bread any day!!

Loved it.  My husband had 3 bowls.  I took others advice and doubled the cheese and broccoli.  I used 1/2 frozen and 1/2 fresh.  I thought it tasted just like the soup at Panera Bread.  I'll be making this again!  Thank you Karin

VERY GOOD! I added an extra 1/2 pound of cheese and used 2-10oz. boxes of chopped frozen broccoli. My family really enjoyed this. Even my 2 year old scarfed it down. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

This soup is sooo good. I've made several times, but this time added extra Velveeta as well as shredded cheddar.  My other preferred changes are to use 1/2 and 1/2 and real garlic.

I agree with Megan, this soup tastes just like Chili's recipe.  I was just at Chili's about a week ago and found out that they no longer offer broccoli cheddar (at least at the buffalo location), so I am very glad to have found this recipe.  The only other place I have found a comparable broccoli cheddar soup is Panera Bread, but now that I can make it at home, that is what I will do.  I made the recipe as directed, and agree with adding more broccoli, but besides that it is perfect.

How can you go wrong when a recipe starts with cooking onions in butter! You immediately know it's going to be good....  :) This is the best by far Broccoli Cheese Soup around. I always loved Panera's but this might be at least one star higher than Paneras... Delicious! I added about twice as much Broccoli, and added some diced carrots... Wow, it's sooooo good! I found this recipe at work last night (worked midnight shift) couldn't wait to fix it for my breakfast........ Yum-O

Very good soup! Like some other reviewers, I doubled the broccoli, to make this more nutrition dense. I didn't double the cheese, and it was still plenty cheesy. I used my immersion blender to puree the soup before adding the cornstarch. Thanks!

Very good! However, I've have made alterations. Double the broccoli (32 oz). 2 cups of evaporated milk, instead of regular milk. No garlic powder. 2 tbsp flour instead of 2/3 cup corn startch, I thought the corn starch added a chalky texture. Prior to adding the cheese I removed half the mixture and blended it, this gave it a great creamy base.

I planned to make this soup days ago and when I finally did, I found that I didn't have all the ingredients so here is what I did. I didnt have a whole onion so I used what little I had and added a leek (white part only), I only had 1/2 a pound of brick cheese so I sliced the whole recipe in half and used broth cubes instead of broth. Fresh broccoli instead of frozen. The soup is fantastic. I will definately make it again.

I opted to use cheddar cheese lilke may reviews before me, and my kids did not like the texture of the soup.  Wish I had gone with the Velveeta.

Very good soup, I used fresh broccoli and it came it just as good. I didn't have cornstarch so I used a flour/milk mixture to thicken the soup. Will definitely make again, but will cut back a little on the velvetta.

This was awesome soup I huge hit and the recipe made plenty I put a bunch in my husbands lunch for the next day also froze a bit for later... The only thing that I changed is I doubled the cheese I was also told it would be even better with more broccoli but I'm not a big veggie eater so it was perfect. I also served it in a bread bowl delicious one bowl filled us all up. It was definitely something I will make again.

This soup was excellent, even my 5 & 6 year old enjoyed it.  There was enough leftover to freeze & enjoy on another cold night.  I did follow along w/ the other reviews when doubling the cheese & broccoli & I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, just because I like it.  I also followed someone else recommendation & used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the cup of water. It was delicious & I can't wait to make it again.

I liked this recipe a lot! Definitely a keeper...one suggestion: Use 2 (14 oz) bags of broccoli..there wasn't enough broccoli to me. I used 2 (32 oz) cans of chicken broth and used 1 cup in place of water to mix with the corn starch. Other than those changes it was delicious!

Loved this! I made a serving for three but put about 400g of brocolli instead. Instead of using cheese cubes, i simply grated cheese and that worked wonderfully for me. I used milk only and that turned out perfect for me. Also substituted garlic powder for 3 gloves of minced garlic. Didn't subtract from the taste I feel. Love love love

We loved this soup!  I read some of the reviews before I started it and decided to only use half of the garlic.  It still had a really strong garlic taste to it.  I think next time I will just omit the garlic all together.  I plan on making this again soon!

My first attempt at Broccoli Cheese Soup and it was a success!  Only change-up was I used Smart Balance butter sticks (50/50 butter/spread) and it turned out cheesy and delicious.  A perfect companion for our BLT sandwiches at dinner tonight!

Love this recipe. Sometimes will use half a cup of chopped onions instead of powder and make a roux with flour instead of cornstarch. Use this recipe all the time for a quick and cheap meal.

This was so very nummy!! It was a little too runny for us, so I added just a little more cornstarch. Also, after I simmered the broccoli, I used my potato masher to mash up the broccoli into little bits. My kids really appreciated that! We ate our soup w/ rueben sandwiches. It was great on a chilly day!!

I halved the recipe, used vegetable broth (to make it vegetarian), and fresh broccoli.  This is a good recipe as is but it was a bit too garlicky- weird combination to me.  I will decrease the amount of garlic- probably acutally use real- next time.  I will also not add quite as much cheese- very rich.  A very easy recipe and very filling.

I am on a low carb diet so I substituted cheddar cheese and heavy cream for the cheese and milk.  Also definately use double the cheese as many people have already suggested.  You will also need to add some salt and pepper to it because it is a little bland.  Next time I will also add some bacon to it to make it a meal for my low carb diet!

My husband felt the soup was too thin.  I thought so at first, but when I reheated it the next day it seemed slightly thicker.  The taste was very good.

OK I totally changed this but it was perfect for us. Used one half an onion and only a couple T butter. Used package of frozen borccoli cuts. Added 2 small carrots sliced small and followed directions. Then I used immersion blender to mix until just a few chunks around. For cheese used 1/2 loaf Velveeta and 2c appx shredded mild cheddar. Simmer and stir, I was watching and still slightly burnt bottom. Used 2c half and half, next time start with 1.5 c and see if that is enough. There were a few small chunks of cheese that would not melt so I used the blender again and added pepper...perfection! No need for extra water and cornstarch, when you blend the veggies it provides the thickness! Forgot the garlic...my family loved this. Thanks for the great base!

I've made this a few times.  Every time I have taken the advice from the reviews that say to double the cheese and broccoli.  Also, instead of using cornstarch, I let the soup simmer until it thickens.  We love this broccoli cheese soup!

Great flavor but too runny. Froze well in small packages and then served over baked potatoes.

Yummy!!  My kids hate broccoli, but they ate this up.  I used low sodium chicken broth and 1 1/2 lbs of velveeta cheese and it was perfect.  I have never had soup this good.

I've made this soup about 5 times and each time except for once I doubled the cheese amount.  The one time I forgot to put 2 lbs of cheese the soup turned out awful.  I'll never forget to double the cheese again.  This is such a great soup.  I love the broccoli cheese soup from Panera Bread and this one is just as good if not better.  Thanks for sharing

Love this recipe! I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviews: doubled the broccoli, 1-1/2 lb cheese, cut back to 1/2 cup cornstarch, used half milk and half half & half. I also did not add a whole extra cup of water to mix with the cornstarch - just enough to smooth the cornstarch before adding to the soup. I also put some of it through the blender before serving. My father-in-law who doesn't like broccoli said it was good! It was amazing! Definitely a keeper!

I thought this was GREAT! I decided not to add onions, and substituted onion powder for the garlic powder (my family isn't huge on garlic). For the cheese, I used half cheddar and for the other half I used a four cheese blend. I can't wait to use this recipe again! :)

I am not a huge soup fan, and even I liked this!  It really thickens after sitting.  I think I would add more broccoli next time, as I like a lot of vegetables and also I will add the cheese last. I used mild cheddar instead of processed cheese, and it stuck to the broccoli in clumps.  I added even more cheese at the end, and that melted nicely.  I will make this again.

My first attempt at this recipe and it was perfect. I did follow someone else's advice and instead of just water to mix cornstarch I used 3/4 cup of broth and 1/4 cup of water. This is a keeper!

My fanily loved this, even my wife who is very picky about her soup. I made about half the recipe and still had plenty as a side dish for four with a sandwich. I used frozen broccoli florets that I thawed under hot water and chopped roughly. Really good soup and very easy to do. Definately a keeper for years to come.

This was really good broccoli cheese soup. After reading other reviews I had my hopes up that it was going to taste like Chili's soup, but it didn't. Other than that, it was great!

Very good!  I used ELMOLVSU suggestions and also made it in the crockpot. It was rich and so good.  We used it as a topper for potatoes so I added a little extra cheese to make it thicker.  Will be making again.

Great recipe. I think it would be a 4.5 made as is, and a few changes make it a 5. I added a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion, use half and half instead of milk, and only used 1/3rd cup cornstarch. Cornstarch doesn't mix with hot liquids, but I only used just enough water to thin it out. The final product was very good, but I felt like it was missing something. I added 1 TBSP Texas Pete's hot sauce, and it really brought the flavors of the soup together.

All I can say is, "Yum!" Biggest recommendation I can say is don't rush cooking each ingredient like it says.  I did, and it turned out yucky. Took my time, which isn't much at all, and it was much better.

I just wanted to say thank you for sharing this recipe.  My family was delighted when I made this recipe this afternoon.  It was a cold, cold day here in the Midwest and this warm, creamy soup really warmed us up.  So close to what we get at the restaurants around here.  Didn't change a thing and loved it - thanks again!

This soup is awesome! Very easy to make and tastes delicious, reminds me of the soup my daughter slways orders at Friday's.  I chopped the onions and the cheese in my food processor as well as a quick chop to the broccoli.  This made it super easy and fast.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a double batch of this soup and served it as a starter to our Prime Rib roast Christmas Eve meal for 18 guests.  They all raved about it and several asked where I bought it from - lol.  I think I followed the recipe exactly but substituted fresh crushed garlic for the powdered.  It was easy to make and tasted wonderful.  Even all the kids ate it happily.  I made it early in the afternoon and then transferred it to my crock pot to keep it hot till dinner time so I was able to tend to the 10 million other things I needed to do that day.  Thanks again!

The recipe "as is" is pretty bland and watery. I had to add much more cheese and more seasoning. After I did, it came out very good. So this is a good base recipe, but that's about it.

I did what others said and didn't use water, I used chicken broth instead. I dont know. I just wasn't 'head over heels' for this soup. My husband liked it, but he also wasn't begging me to make it again any time soon.

This is definitely the best broccoli cheese soup recipe ever!  it's just as good or better than the restaurants.  When I finished making it, I realized it made a ton, wondering how in the world we would ever finish it all.  YEAH, well -it was gone the next day.  My husband can't get enough, it's like the easiest gift i can give to him now to make him happy!   :)  I doubled the broccoli, and added some shredded cheddar cheese to it as well.   SO GOOD.  Now we don't know what would do without this recipe.  THANK YOU!

This served as a starting base for my soup. I altered only to what I had on hand. Used bouillon instead of canned broth. I also added very finely diced carrot to the brocoli since my frozen bag was only 13 oz. I used a splash of worchester sauce in the soup and seasoned with salt and pepper. It was excellent, better than the soup they are selling down the street at Panera Bread.

I was disappointed with this recipe!  I decided to follow as written and would describe the finished product in two words:  Runny and Bland!  But that is probably to be expected if you consider you're adding 10 cups of liquid to 1 lb. of processed cheese.  It's still in the pot so I tried to fix it by adding the following:  1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese (I don't want to add more for fear that I end up tossing the whole thing!), 1 tsp chicken boullion, 1 tsp. garlic salt, and ground pepper.  Hopefully this will at least make it edible.  But dangit--I was so hopeful to find an alternative to the cream-based broccolli soup that we love!  UPDATE:  We just ate dinner--my kids picked out the broccoli, my husband said it was 'edible, but you could probably find canned stuff that tastes better.'  One more comment, 2/3 cup of cornstarch is an insane amount for one batch of soup!  I should have trusted my instincts, and listened to the reviewers on this one.

My husband made this for me when I was sick. It was just what I needed. just right. It is WAY better than the canned. after trying this I will make it my sick soup and never eat the canned again! I will even eat it when I feel well. My son that is 4 even fell in love with it and ate 2 big bowls full.

this was very good except a little too salty. I substituted veg broth for the chicken so my veggie daughter would eat it. basically very easy and tasty. May try cheddar next time instead of velveeta and see if it comes out smoothly.

It was good though I thought it tasted a little too much like processed cheese.  I'll try this again, but with real cheese this time.

WOW!! My family loved this!  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the onion (and still added the garlic powder) used fresh broccoli, half and half, added sharp ceddar and montery jack and combined the cornstarch with chicken broth.  For those of you reading this, this is just a combined list of what everyone else has tweeked the recipe with!  

Will make again!  Thanks, Karin for posting this recipe!

This recipe is absolutely delicious...I incorparted some of the previous tips. I doubled the broccoli, omited the water and used a cup of the broth to mix with the cornstarch, I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and I added pepper. Finally to make it more hearty I added diced potatoes and crumbled bacon. This recipe will be a staple in my house. We loved it!

I made this last night and it went over very well with my family. I was going to double the recipe but after reading the reviews, I decided that it would make enough. I used the 1 pound block of velveeta and then added a bag of shredded sharp cheddar and used 2 boxes of broccoli. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and added a little garlic salt and some oregano. I will be adding this to my winter soups!

Wow. Oh Wow. I've been looking for a broccoli cheese soup recipe for a long time and have always been intimidated by them - until now. I made this recipe using the double idea (double cheese, double broccoli) and even though the cheese was almost too much (I'll be doing 1 1/2 lbs of cheese next time), it was amazing. The cornstarch mixture made it thicken beautifully - perfect for a cold winter day. Makes a lot, but that's no big deal - we'll get a day or two of lunches out of it!

This was so good!  Since I was cooking for two, I halved the recipe except for the cheese and the broccoli.  I used a 10oz. chopped broccoli square and a half of a 16 oz. bag of broccoli cuts. Followed another reviewer's advice and reserved some chicken broth to mix with the cornstarch instead of water.  Hubby even had seconds.  Froze leftovers.  Served with some sweet cornbread, this rivals Quizno's.

Delicious and satisfying! I followed the recipe as written except used reduced sodium chicken broth because I knew the processed cheese would provide plenty of sodium for us.

Everyone enjoyed this.  Very filling. Need to make some changes next time:  slice shaved (lunch meat) ham into small pieces; saute with 1 chopped red onion in 1/2 c. butter; stir in 3 cans chicken broth and 32oz pkg of broccoli pieces.  Cover and simmer until cooked.  Smash broccoli into finer pieces.  Add 2 lbs Velveeta (cubed), 2 pints of whole cream and 1 tbs of garlic powder.  Let it simmer.  Thicken it by mixing separately 2/3 c. cornstarch and another can of chicken broth.  Pour into soup and stir until thickened.  Makes 3 meals and can be frozen.

If you are feeling like indulging on the "comfy" side for a bit this soup is delish!  I used vegetable broth instead and brocolli baby florets (two frozen bags).  Also added some sharp cheddar.

AWESOME!  My daughter had been bugging to to find a great broccoli cheese soup recipe.  This is the one! I used about 20 oz of frozen broccoli florets. Cooked them down, and then followed a few other reviewers. Chopped them up and added them to the butter. I left out the onions because my daughter hates them. I added three cans of broth til heated  up, then added 2 lbs. of cheese and used 1 1/2 cups of the other can of broth to mix with the cornstarch. Thanks for this awesome recipe.

I am sorry but I did not care for this at all, I know it is weird because like everyone else likes it.  To me the garlic flavor was too strong, although normally I love garlic.  I thought that the cornstarch was a little much and made it too thick.  I have never really made a soup with cornstarch before, so maybe I did something wrong.  I threw the whole pot away and made a sandwich for dinner.  Don't worry though, lots of others liked it... my taste buds are just different I guess.

I'm a head chief at a known La Restaurant. I'm always having family and friend want me to make these over the top kind of foods. Well, I carted a friends housewarming party and wanted to try something different wasn't in the mood to go out and make up my own stuff, so I looked on this. I didn't read any review until after I made my soup. I loved it and now ofter it at my business where its getting tons of great raves. Best advise I can give those that didn't like it is to always take and go with the feeling cornstarch works better then flour but add flavor to that, white pepper does wonders. I did use a little over 2 lbs, and streamed the broccoli with the chicken broth, whole, then pulled the broccoli out diced it then added it back. I did use a 1/2 c of butter with the onion

This was pretty good.  I cut back on the Velveeta at first and subbed in a little cheddar.  I ended up adding the rest of the Velveeta just to get it to the flavor I was looking for.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  I ended up having to cook my broccoli a little longer because we like ours kind of soft in soup.  Otherwise, pretty good recipe.

My kids loved this soup,it was just as good as the local deli.  Rich and creamy texture. I did add white pepper to it but that was the only change.

Amazing flavor! Very delicious. I'm allergic to onions myself, so I replaced them with a cup of carrot straws, but it was still magnificent! Thank you!

This was an okay recipe exactly as written. At the end we added a few dashes of tabasco and extra cheese for more flavor. Turned out much better! Place in a bread bowl for looks.

Absolutely Delicious!  I can't get enough of it!  I also followed the other users advice and doubled the cheese, and next time I will double the broccoli because it didn's seem like there was enough.  But those are the only modifications I made.  Oh wait--I did add a handful of shredded mild cheddar cheese too.  YUMMY!!!

I really liked this recipe. It is very tasty and overall I was happy with it. The only thing is that the soup was not as thick as I had hoped and I did not want to continue to add cornstarch. I was afraid of changing the flavor. Next time I make it I will try using 3 cans of chicken broth.

This soup was amazing! My husband raved about it.  I followed the other suggestions and doubled the vegetables and cheese.  Instead of one bag of broccoli, I added one broccoli and one cauliflower.  I reduced the amount of stock by 2 cups and added 2 cups of dry chardonnay instead.  Gave it a wonderful flavor.  Beat it all up w/ a hand blender for smoothness.  Served it with fresh buttered crusty bread.  Yum-O!

This made a huge pot that I ended up giving away.  Couldn't eat more than a small bowl, it was really rich so there was no way that my husband and I were going to finish it.  It definitely had too much of something or somethings: garlic powder? velveeta? chicken broth? butter?

Used only a generous 1/4 c of cornstarch in the last can of chicken broth, omitting the water.  Good with 2% milk.  Makes a big batch.  We thought it was great!

I first found this recipe about 8 years ago and loved it! I haven't made it for a very long time and had a craving for broccoli cheese soup so I had to hunt down the recipe again. I'll have to try some of the suggestions made, but I still really love this recipe!

This is a decent broccoli cheese soup, but I didn't think it was as wonderful as other reviewers did.  Something tasted a little off, maybe the cornstarch.  I will look for another recipe when I make broccoli cheese soup again.

Loved this recipe!!!  I doubled the cheese & broccoli as recommended.  I didn't have enough chicken broth so I added one can of vegetable broth, one chicken bouillon, and one can of cream of chicken soup.  I added an additional cup of milk to which I added the cornstarch.  It's definitely a keeper!!

I thought this was excellent soup!  I, however, thought it could have been a bit thinner.  I followed everything exactly but used a bit less corn starch.  I ended up adding more milk and broth at the end to thin it a little bit.  Definitely a keeper!  (be careful not to burn your tongue!)

This is an excellent Broccoli Cheese Soup.    The addition of chicken broth is such a wonderful idea.  However, the cornstarch flavor was just too much for me.  Needs a little tweaking to be a five star.

Good, similar to the BlackEyedPea. Have enjoyed it with broccoli but I was craving this one night, had everything except broccoli.  I did have a bag of frozen (Pictsweet) Cracked Pepper Summer Vegetables and used that instead.  I liked it even better.  Served with Light Wheat Rolls from Susan Harshbarger.  Thought I was in the restaurant.

My family loved this recipe! It was delicious. Although, I did double the broccoli and the cheese. This is definely a keeper that I will be making for years to come.

It was my first try making broccoli cheese soup and I guess maybe I had added too much broth or maybe the cheese wasn't right that it turned out more watery/brothy than it was supposed to be. I also ran out of garlic powder which may account for the blandness. However, in that situation, I managed to salvage the situation by seasoning the soup with some salt, dried oregano, parsley and garlic chives. It worked out well, but next time I think I will spring for Velveeta (I used regular brand cheese this time) and maybe reduce the chicken broth to using only 2 1/2 cans.

This soup was truly amazing, I did follow the advice of others, and used the last can to dissolve cornstarch, I also added some carrots, and some substituted half and half, since I am not a big fan of broccoli, I steamed cauliflower and threw it in instead, awesome and easy.  The garnish of chopped tomatoes is worth the extra couple minutes of chopping.

This is a very good soup,and my experience and rating are based on my attempt to make the recipe for 15 people. First, use fresh broccoli and less broth. Mine was not thick enough and the cornstarch did not help. Too much liquid. The flavor is great, it just depends on how you like your broccoli and how thick you like the soup. Good soup!

This was fabulous!  I was so glad to find a recipe for this soup that wasn't loaded with cream and butter.  I used fresh broccoli and just simmered it longer before adding the cheese.  I added double the amount of broccoli it called for.  Also, instead of garlic powder, I used jarred crushed garlic.  It was delicious!  Plus, makes enough to freeze for another time.

I love this soup.  I used half the butter and it still came out wonderful.  Two sticks plus all the cheese seemed too fattening.  I also used fresh broccoli and pureed it with the hand mixer.

Great recipe. It is a staple. Only addition I make is I add 4 cups of frozen mixed vegtables when I add the broccoli.  I also use broccoli florets.

I added some extra broccoli (about another 1/2 bag) and only 1 quart of broth. I also added some grated carrot. 
When the broccoli was cooked I pureed most of the soup in my small food processor and added the cheese. When I tasted it, I realized there was no need to add ANY milk or cream--it was delicious as is!
Add the cornstarch a little at a time until it reaches the desired thickness. My family loved it and my daughter declared it tasted like the soup she loves at Panera!

Yummy!  I halved it and made a few changes:

No broth, so I used cubes 
Used minced garlic with the onions
Threw some canned carrots in with the broccoli to simmer
Used 1 cup shredded cheddar with the Velvetta to thicken it up
Did not use cornstarch (I never put cornstarch or flour in my soups, just more veggies)
Put all of this in the blender so I didn't have chunks
Read some other reviews and put in nutmeg - not going to do that again!  Did not like the taste of it!

Overall, I love this recipe!  But, until broccoli turns another shade, the husband and kids won't touch it :o)

I used cauliflower instead of broccoli because we love it, but we still ended up throwing most of this out. I am sorry I wasted the ingredients on it and I sure I will not try this one again.

1 word - AMAZING. It comes out so rich and creamy... my friend and I were in awe as we were eating it. The only changes I made were using vegetable broth instead of chicken and adding some shredded cheddar cheese. The one problem was I was having trouble thickening it, so I just added cornstarch from the box and covered it for a bit. Otherwise this was fabulous! The best thing I've ever made!

very good.  i rated it 4-star because of the potential i think it has.  i did tweek the recipe though, so i cannot fairly give it a 5-star.  

the biggest mistake i made was to use real garlic--adding it to the onion saute.  the soup was VERY garlicy.  next time, i will use real garlic, however, i will just add it to the base, instead of with the onions while sauteeing.  

had i not done that, i think this would have been a 5-star!  very good!  i also added carrots, and 2 bags of shredded sharp cheddar, as i like it super cheesy.

LOVE THIS!  But, make sure you get the right amounts of chicken broth with your cheese!  1st time I made - FABULOUS!  2nd time, I got a bit more chicken broth & not enough cheese.  REALLY good though!

I wasn't overly impressed with this soup, but it was easy.  I steamed the broccoli separately as I didn't want the broth to turn green and based on others' reviews, halved the butter, added garlic and matchstick carrots after the onions sauteed, right before adding the broth.  I doubled both the broccoli and cheese and added about 1 tbsp. freshly ground pepper.  I also added a handful of shaved pecorino romano for a little sharpness.  This is a quick and easy recipe, but it didn't do much for us.  Thank you anyway, Karin.

When I was single my roomate and I used to practically live off of this soup. It is easy to make and taste wonderful. A good comfort food for girls on the go!

This is a great soup, but I would reccommend that you cut the recipe if you're making it for your family, unless you plan on freezing some.

Well, here is another 5 star rating!  My husband said this is better than anything he has received in a restaurant - - Huge Compliment.  I added shredded carrots to mine and used a bit more broccoli and cheese.  Serve this with a hunk of crusty bread and it makes quite a filling meal!

Definitely recommend reading through the reviews before you follow the recipe to the letter. Came out a bit thin and bland  :( Either go w/ half-half or heavy cream, minced fresh garlic cloves instead of powder, and extra-sharp cheddar sounds good too. other than that, super easy.

OUTSTANDING!! Like others, I made a few changes, like 2 cans of chicken broth, and fresh broccoli. Also, I used the whole 2 lbs. of processed cheese. It does make a lot, so be prepared for leftovers!!

I did miss a couple of oppurtinities to feed this to my Mom and Dad last year,but have full intentions of pinning them down this fall with it!If you like brocc/ch soup you'll love this.I play with it a little(fresh brocc and stuff)but it's great...splurge on a good crusty bread-this soup deserves it.

This was the first recipe I used off Allrecipes, and I've been making it for almost a year and a half now! It's excellent; I don't make any changes other than to use more cheese. Thanks for a great recipe! Even my husband (who DESPISES broccoli) loves it. =)

This was one of the best soups I've ever had!!! The only change I made was putting the whole 2lb block of cheese instead of 1/2. Next time I might try adding another bag of broccoli. It was a big hit, everyone ate it up!!! Will make again!

This soup was excellent!  I doubled the recipe, then froze 2/3 of it in Ziplock baggies.  It reheats very well.  Even my broccoli-hating 4-year-old twins loved this!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I do wish I would have read through the reviews before making b/c it was thinner than I would have liked and could use some more broccoli. I followed the recipe exact but will add more broccoli next time. Will definately make this again and again!

I was very excited and felt it had potential, but was just kinda blah in comparison of what I was expecting.  Perhaps some spices it needed.  I love Broccoli Cheese Soup, but will try a new receipe.

O.K., after 389 reviews, it's kind of a "no brainer" that this is a really good recipe.  However, I just wanted to let everyone know that this was my first time making any kind of cheese soup, and it really did turn out yummy!  My son loves broccoli, me--not so much.  So I ran an immursion blender through it so it wasnt so lumpy.  A little salt and pepper was all I added to the recipe.  This first time success story has given me the confidence to try other new recipes!  Thanks a bunch!

I made this and added cauliflower, used half and half instead of milk, and took some of the soup and pureed it to make it thicker and sneak in veggies on my kids...it was delicious!! I'll make this again! It's a great soup base and as others said would be wonderful with chicken, potatoes, etc...so easy to make!!!

This was good, not a favorite.  I added extra cheddar cheese to it.  I would definitely not recommend so much garlic powder.  We are garlic eaters, but this overpowered the soup itself.  Will try again with some minor changes.

I actually didn't enjoy this soup and neither did my family, I'm used to using fresh ingredients, and i wasn't impressed with the frozen brocolli, nor was I impressed with the processed cheese, I've made broccoli cheese soup in the past differently, using fresh broccoli and brie cheese and it was amazing, won't be making this recipe again.

This is a very versatile soup. My dad loves it, even though he usually doesn't like cheese soups. I made it more hearty by adding potatoes.

This was very tasty, next time I will increase the amount of broccoli in it.  Be careful to keep the heat down, mine scorched a little on the bottom of the pan when I increased the heat.  I decreased the butter by a couple of tablespoons, and it was fine.

I've never made soup before so I was a little hesitant. But I have to say this soup came out perfect. Like everyone else, I doubled and minced some of the broccoli and doubled the cheese. Wonderful soup, Makes a big pot, but my family loved it so there were very few leftovers, will make again.

Perfect broccoli cheese soup. I have been looking for a good recipie forever, so, my search is finally over. This is so simple, and tastes great! My husband is allergic to broccoli, so, I used carrots, celery, and potatoes. He gave it 4 stars and said it was good for an occasional soup. So, we both liked it.

This one gets the proverbial 6th star.  I followed the suggestion of using a little more broccoli and pureed some after the broccoli was tender and before adding the cheese. I used 1 pound of American cheese.  I also used only 1/2 cup corn starch in 1 cup of water as suggested.  Perfect.  Never had better broccoli cheese soup anywhere.

I simply love this recipe!  I added extra broccoli and processed some of it to add texture.  I also only added the reccommended pound of cheese, I used Velveeta and a bit of American.  I also only used 1/3 cup of cornstarch because last time I made it, it was too thick.  I also added a handful of sliced mushrooms.  This recipes is a keeper!!

This is an edited review...first I gave it a 3 star because of the heavy chicken stock flavor.  I had a surplus of broccoli from Costco today though, and decided to attempt this one again with modifications.  I used a 32 oz box of chicken stock, and added a little over a cup of water.  I doubled the broccoli, and added 1 pound of shredded colby cheese.  I also used 1.5 cups of milk, and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.  It turned out sensational with the modifications.

Pretty good--will make again, and will try some of the earlier reviewers' suggestions. Particularly curious about an earlier suggestion of replacing the water amount with beer to make beer cheese broccoli soup--I'll try that next time I make it! Make sure to sift out the cornstarch so it disperses evenly through the soup mixture; using that much cornstarch can cause it to clump together. Thanks for the recipe, Karin!

This recipe was great-- i was very impressed. The only changes i made to the recipe was that i added more broccoli, used 3 cans of broth instead of 4, and sauteed the mushrooms with the onions!! It makes a huge pot so be ready to eat up!!

This is a great recipe.  I do make some changes when I make it though.  I cut the garlic in half, use twice as much broccoli (usually fresh) and cheese, and use cream in place of one cup of the milk if I have it on hand.  Makes for a very rich soup but it's a wonderful treat.  I usually serve it with a garden salad, and hot crusty bread.

Everytime I make ths my boyfriend says "Sweetness, this is SO good" - He requests it often! I add the white wine and omit the mushrooms I like to serve it with crusty bread and butter or homemade crutons. The best part is it's really EASY!

This recipe was so yummy! My picky eater husband liked it, but wouldn't touch the leftovers. Next time I'll add a bunch of ham and maybe some potatoes to make it more "chunky". I loved it just the way it was though. It was just as good as Jason's Deli and I made it at home!

I'll agree with the other 408 people that think this recipe is wonderful! It made alot and I was able to invite my brother and his wife for dinner. We all loved it and my 3 year old had 2 bowls full. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. Super fast and I even had all the ingredients on hand. Yummy in my tummy!

My family loved this soup!!  Which is saying something because my husband is the pickiest eater in the world!  He usually orders broccoli soup at his favorite restaurant & said this was better(I almost fell out of my chair!). The kids loved it too!  I will definitely be making it again.  The only change I made was I added about a cup of shredded cheddar because I had it on hand.  Excellent...it's a keeper.

I was so very disappointed!! Everyone gave this such rave reviews!!  I consider myself a fairly decent cook. I followed the recipe to a "T". Was very salty. The velveeta didn't melt fully so I had little curds of cheese, which grossed the kids out. My husband asked me not to make this again.

Making this soup for my husband I just knew he would be so overwelmed with love and a full belly that he would instantly jump up and clear the table and do the dishes all while I sat on the back patio with my feet up, nah didn't happen but this soup got my approval:)

What a wonderful dish!!  This soup came out thick enough to make a full meal, but would also make a great appetizer.  I loved this.  Next time, I'm going to try it with mushrooms as well.  Also considered spinach.  There's a lot you can do with this, if you're willing to take a couple risks.

This was ok- I changed the recipe a bit, which was probably a mistake.  I cut the recipe in half and used chopped fresh broccoli intead of frozen.

This soup is sooo easy to make!  I absolutely love it!  It has a wonderful rich flavor and will definitely make it again and again!  It reminds me of eating in one of the best tea rooms!  I like to add extra cheese to make it extra rich.  I use about 3/4 of a block of Velveeta.  Yummy!

GREAT soup! I went ahead and doubled it, simply doubling the entire ingredient list as it was given. The only change I made was to add a little kosher salt and crack some pepper, for personal taste preferences. I served it in large dishes, spooned over chunks of sour dough bread, the lazy woman's sourdough bread bowl. I'll definitely be making this recipe again in the near future.

I really, really liked this soup. I found it incredibly easy to make, and so tasty.  I only changed it a little - I doubled the amount of broccoli (used frozen - tasted great) and used a little more Velvetta (I went with 1 and 1/2 lbs).  I also just added a dash of garlic powder instead of the tablespoon listed, and I added julienne carrots for little extra something.  It came out wonderfully and I will be making this again and again.

Fantastic Recipe! Make sure you turn your heat down low or the cheese wil clump to the broccoli! I have made this mistake many times and it isn't pretty.

This soup is very good!  On another review they said it take about 30 minutes to thicken, that is true only if the heat is too low.  On my cornstarch box it states to thicken a soup or gravy the heat needs to be set at medium.  I set mine at medium and it took no time in thickening.  I also cut back on the liquids as suggested.  I will make this again.

This recipe was restaurant quality and very easy to make.  Like another reviewer suggested, I kept the amount of broccoli and the amount of cheese the same and I cut the rest of the ingredients in half.  I also dissolved the cornstarch in the chicken broth instead of adding the extra cup of water.  It turned out perfect.  I served it with sourdough bread.  It was a hardy meal.

I hate broccoli, but this was wonderful! My guests had atleast 3 bowls a piece, which is always the highest compliment.  The only notes I can add is that you remember that it takes 30-40 minutes for this soup to thicken up, with constant stirring, even after you add the cornstarch.  So, be prepared.  I also added a cup of cheddar and put it on top for garnish.  Delicious!

Just what I've been looking for!  Did add more broccoli and some chicken soup base for a richer flavor.  Get raves whenever I fix it.

i cut down by 3/4 on the onions, and it was still too onion-y, yet still lacked SOMETHING to me, I'm not sure what, but it wasn't onions.

On the other hand, my boyfriend (who loves broccoli & cheese soup AND is an extremely picky eater) LOVED it. Now he asks me to make it all the time!! 

I'm actually making it again tonight!

This was pretty good!  I admit to being skeptical of the Velveeta, but it made a nice flavor.  I added a good bit of shredded sharp cheddar just to make the cheese flavor a little stronger, but very impressive for how easy it is.

This was good. Next time I will use more broccoli and add pureed broccoli to give more texture as previous member suggested. Even better next day.

Loved this soup!! I never use processed cheese in my recipes...usually real cheddar cheese...but I decided to give it a try. So glad that I did. I did use 3 medium size heads of broccoli cut into small florets. After the soup was cooked and the broccoli tender...I put aside maybe 1/3 of the florets- pureed the rest of the soup in batches and then added the cheese and milk and the rest of the broccoli for texture. It was excellent. Will make again real soon!

Scrumptious, warm and creamy.  Great for an autumn/winter's night.  Makes enough for left overs and so it's even better the next day.  This one won my husband's heart.

Great Soup.  I followed the recipe exact. Make sure you take the time to stir in the cornstarch to thicken it up.

Turned out really good used fresh brockley had to let it cook the brockley alittle longer than if you use the frozen. Thickend up really well.

This soup was so hearty, tasty, creamy, and wonderful. A new fav. of mine and my 18 month old son. I did not have processed cheese on hand so I threw in a can of Feista Cheese soup, 4 slices of American cheese, and 2 slices of Swiss. I also emitted the garlic (except for a sprinkle). It was great. Better then many fancy dinner soups I have had out. Will def. make again and again! Thanks for sharing this easy and yummy recipe!

Yum yum!  This was probably the best broccoli cheese soup I've had!  I added some sliced carrots to it, and if I had some, I would have added more broccoli.  Very good!  My husband thanks you (as do I!).

Wonderful soup!  My husband LOVED it and he is not a huge soup fan.  Will use fresh broccoli next time.  My 2 children, 8 & 5, loved it as well.  Served with slices of Tomato Basil bread for dipping!

This recipe is excellent!  It is now a staple in my house and my kids love it!  I add 1 bunch of fresh broccoli and 1 1/2 lbs. of cheese.  I also made it with heavy cream and it was delicious!  Great for an Atkins diet.

I made this soup for Clark Masonic Lodge 40.  Some of the guys hadn't had any sort of broccoli soup before.  One said "I'll try anything once."  It went over well.  I left out the garlic powder, since I'm not a believer in dessicated garlic or onion products.  Also, I used a "sweet" Vidalia-type onion.

This recipe is really simple to make, and doesn't take much time at all to prepare.  All thou I do recommend cutting down on the garlic powder if you don't care for things that are salty.

I made the recipe according to the instructions.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that it was to thin and not cheesy enough.  Next time I will use twice as much cheese.

This recipe was good but none of my family thought it was fantastic.  I doubled the amount for broccoli and cheese as recommended from some of the other reviewers.  I also cut down on the garlic amount and just used a teaspoon. I used half & half in place of milk which made the soup a little richer.  I probably won't prepare this recipe again.  I wanna find a cheese broccoli soup recipe that is out-of-this world!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I just made it and followed the recipe to a tee. I had to double everything to serve at a soup and sandwich party tommorow.  It came out great, can't wait to hear what people say about it.

This recipe was awesome! It's so creamy and delicious, a terrific soup for cold days. I served it with ham sandwiches and it was big hit! I think next time I'll add some cubed potatoes, or maybe even leave out the broccoli and make a cheesy potato soup. This recipe seems to be very versatile. Thanks for a wonderful soup recipe!!!

I will use less cheese next time.  It was very, very good but way too salty for me.  I'm sure with less cheese it will be fine.

This soup is wonderful. we are making it for the Fall Festival at our church. We need to have soup for 50 and this will be a real easy one to put together and I suspect it will be a crowd pleaser.
I added a bit more cheese and broccoli (mostly because I didn't want a small dab of ingrediennts hanging out in my refrigerator. It took 30 minutes start to finish.

Excellent!  I added extra chicken broth, used broccoli cuts and light cheese and it was ssooo good.  My 4 year old nephew said it was "the best" and he doesn't even like broccoli!

This soup was a hit! Everyone loved it in my house and there was hardly any left over! The only recommendation I have is to chop the onion very fine. I have a picky eater who hates onions, but he overlooked the larger pieces and told me it was fabulous!!

I accidentally used Garlic flavored chicken broth.  It made it even more wonderful.  But be sure to leave out the additional garlic.

Wow! What a great soup! My husband said I had to make this again, after the first spoonful!  I scaled it to 6 servings and used a little less broth and a little more milk. I also added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. Some of the reviews said to add less garlic and a little more cornstarch, which is what I did. I will make this often--it is sooo simple and sooo delicious!

This soup was sooo good! I would recommend it to anyone - I tweeked it a very little bit by using a little extra Velveta and although I used the recommended 4 cups of chicken broth, I also threw in an extra chix. boullion. I will be using this recipe *very* often - Thanks alot

WOW...this was fantastic !!!  I was looking for a good soup recipe and had just tried one that was a disaster, so I was a little worried about attempting this one.  FABULOUS... I did add a bit more cornstarch as mine was a little thin and it is unbelievable.  Thank you so much for this recipe !!!

My family loved this soup!(Except for my 8 year old who has an aversion to any green vegetable.) It was very easy to prepare and made plenty for a second meal. I sent some over to a friend who then asked for the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good, but I thought there was too much garlic--next time, I may omit it entirely.  I also reduced the soup to 2 cans and added 1 cup more milk.

My kids were skeptical, but they liked it.  I thought it was easy, although it was the first soup I had ever made.

This soup is wonderful.  It is very easy to prepare and to make.  I omitted the onions and substituted onion powder and it was wonderful.  I couldn't eat alot of it though, because it is so rich!!

It was hearty enough to have it for dinner when I added cubed chicken breast and potato.  I made so much thinking to eat again on next day's lunch time, there was no such luck.

Karin, Karin, Karin, WORD! Outstanding soup you have here. I made it without wine or mushrooms, I can see how they might help add some zip.

Great simple recipe. I made it for a dinner party that I was catering and the women loved it. I added more cheese to give it a more cheesy taste.
