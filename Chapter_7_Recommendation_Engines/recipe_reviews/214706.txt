We really liked this recipe and didn't find it to be too bland at all.  I used a can of white hominy and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  I did add the full 3 cups of water and found it to be a little too liquidy.  I fixed that by adding a little cornstarch/water mixture and thickened it up to our liking.   Topped it off with some shredded pepperjack cheese and it was perfect!

This was totally easy to make. I'd make again. My family loved it. I wasn't sure what the difference between yellow and white hominy but I used white. This was mild not spicy. It was very very good and it was a great alternative for my kiddos.  We did have to add extra water because there wasn't any liquids to help cook with the potatoes and  in fact it took longer to cook the potatoes for that reason. When reheated most of the juice factor is gone, but that's okay, I opened up a small can of green chili enchilada sauce and added to the stew and it was totally awesome as a reheat dish. We totally loved this.

Pretty bland as written...  I salvaged it by adding 1 c. beef stock  (only started with two cups of water for fear it would be too liquidy) and added a lot of cumin, salt, and pepper.  Next time I'll be sure to season the ground beef better and use all beef broth instead of water.  It's worth trying, but needs more flavor which you can add it to suit your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Good, but I made it without the meat, I really don't care for ground beef except in a burger. To make up for the lack of meat I added the recommended salt, pepper, cumin and broth instead of water.

Just awesome soup.  Loved the flavor and colors.  I didn't have any hominy, so I just added more corn.  This was easy and delicious!

This was good! I used beef broth instead of water. It does take longer to cook than stated. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely no taste what so ever. I tried adding garlic and cumin and it was edible but very bland and not worth making again.

In lieu of ground beef, I used cubed pork, added 2 tbsps. cumin, 2 cloves garlic and omitted the hominy and salsa.  Used chopped fresh roasted green chile (since I live in NM and always have it in my freezer).  
Brown the pork in 4 tbsps oil, then remove and drain.  Add the onion and garlic to the oil and saut√© until soft.  Place all the ingredients in a kettle or crockpot and simmer for 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and starts to fall apart.  Place in serving bowls and garnish with grated Mexican blend cheese and warm flour tortillas.

very,very bland, no taste at all.I ended up adding 1 jalapeno pepper, some cumin, oregano,bay leaf and salt and it was edible.I also fried strips of flour tortilla to garnish it along with some diced up cilantro. I don't think I would make it again with ground beef. I have seen this recipe made with pork or stew meat, probably would be more flavorful. I might try it that way!

This recipe is a good starting point but seemed bland as is. I only added 2 cups of water with 2 cubes of beef bouillon. I added chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, paprika, black pepper, and salt. I also didn't have green salsa so I added some homemade salsa. I also added 2 guajillo peppers with the stems cut off for the extra spice. This recipe turned out to be a five star  recipe. Yum

This recipe was a good starting point...  I added 4 cups of beef broth in place of the water.  Also, to make the green chile stand out more I added a 16 oz jar of green chile salsa and 1 14.5 oz can of green enchilada sauce. The tomatoes were fire roasted with garlic.  Also, be sure to add salt and black pepper to taste.  Enjoy..

We always make the recipe as stated the first time then if we like it we keep it as is. Or we make changes to suit our like. 
I think it is the only fair way to rate a recipe. We loved this one ! Quick and easy, smells awesome. Only change I made the second time we made this was to use beef broth instead of water. Gave it a bit more flavor. A definite keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Made it veggie by just substituting some mexican veg crumbles, simmered it for over an hour so the potatoes could cook and it was fabulous!  Thanks for a great recipe.
