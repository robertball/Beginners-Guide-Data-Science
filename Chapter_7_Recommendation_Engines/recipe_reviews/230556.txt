This recipe doesn't tell you when to add the Grand Marnier and the Kahlua, so I just added it with the extracts.  This is a good variation on traditional spiced pecans that are served this time of year, but this has a nice twist...a subtle hint of orange.  I couldn't taste the rosemary at all and I thought that was an interesting addition, so I think I will double that next time.  These will be gone in no time, they taste great!

Absolutely delicious! I made them per the recipe except doubled the cinnamon (I always do in any recipe). I’d add more rosemary next time and could cut back on the sugar (they’re very sweet), but yum!!! I’m making another batch ASAP.
