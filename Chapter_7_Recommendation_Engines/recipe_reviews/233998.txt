this recipe is very good and very similar to the one done at my mother's home in Sicily. Only difference, we cook the pasta in the same water the broccoli have been cooked in to give it extra flavor and stir fry some sun dried tomatoes and/or a few anchovies fillets with the garlic. We usually don't top it with parmesan but with roasted breadcrumbs.

Seriously delicious!  I had mushrooms that needed to be used up and added them with the butter and olive oil.  Farfalle pasta worked well as an alternative to Angel Hair.  Would not change a thing!

This is a great recipe that I grew up eating and still make it often, just last week, as a matter of fact! I prefer to use Spaghetti Rigati or Thin Spaghetti. I usually just eyeball the recipe, but Chef John's measurements are spot on. I do add some freshly ground black pepper and sometimes I change it up by adding caramelized onion. Last week, I added the onion and also bacon that I chopped finely and crisped and sauteed the onion, garlic and stems using a bit of the bacon grease along with the oil and butter. That was a tasty variation. Another variation that I have made, one that might not appeal to everyone, is to cook the florets until they are very soft and mashing the broccoli/garlic and onions into the stock, leaving some of the broccoli in small chunks. This method makes it more of a sauce that will cling to the pasta. Alternately, you can also set aside some florets to cook tender crisp so that you have the best of both worlds! For Chrissy, yes, you can use frozen broccoli, but the cooking time will have to be adjusted. I would let the broccoli thaw first and then proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps!

Delicious!  I added a few meatballs on top to make this a main dish.  Also added a squeeze of lemon at the end.  Be sure to undercook your broccoli and your pasta.  They will both finish cooking in the pot at the end.  If it seems too runny, place on stovetop for another minute until broth cooks off.

Loved this recipe! I had some leftover chicken that I sliced thinly and added long enough before serving to heat through.  I also toasted some pine nuts and added before serving.  I used to go to a restaurant that served a similar dish and have been trying ever since to recreate it.  This recipe beats the original.  Thanks for a great recipe

Chef John, You always come through! I had a couple of boneless chicken breasts I wanted to use, so I cut them in medallions, dusted them in some flour and then sautéed them with the garlic. It helped to make a thicker sauce. I also sautéed mushrooms and threw them in with the pasta, chicken and broccoli. It was a wonderful meal! Thank You!

Great dish.  For those who say way too salty, why?  Recipe says SALT TO TASTE.  So YOU added too much salt and it's not the recipe's fault.When using canned broth, even low sodium, you should never add more salt.  Excellent recipe Chef John. 5 stars is too low really.

In a word...yum! I am a vegetarian, so I opted for vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe. Next time, I will add mushrooms, but the final product is just as good as a similar recipe from my favorite restaurants! I am thrilled and my family was just as excited with this new recipe as I was!

I had to change from chicken broth because I didn't have any so I used cream of chicken- mushroom soup instead with a full can of water and I alsp cooked pieces of small cut up  chicken with the garlic in the oil and butter it turned out great.  I think it needed more spice so added more pepper and more pepper flakes. Parmesan cheese on top mixed in yum.

I can never get these garlic/oil recipes right! I thought this one would be different with having broth. I ended up with a soup like broth. My only change was adding in some sautéed mushrooms. I can't imagine it adding that much liquid! I finally ended up adding some half and half at the end, to change it up, and see if that would thicken the consistency. It did nothing. I ended up with white broth. On taste and texture, I would rate it about a 2. Being as I have never succeeded at one of these recipes I rated it 1 star higher. Maybe, someone will eat it.

Delicious recipe. The sauce is light but very tasty.  My husband and I both loved the flavors and it's a pretty simple recipe to follow. If your mouth is spicy heat sensitive, I would suggest 1/2 tsp. pepper flakes. The flavor will still be there with less bite but it was great for us.

My whole family loved this! The key to not having it runny is to gauge the amount of broth visually. Less broccoli means less broth. When in doubt, the pasta can be cooked right in the pan before the broc heads are added. We'll make this again for sure!

This is a fantastic recipe! I like to add chickpeas at the same time as the florets to make it a vegetarian entree,but otherwise, follow the recipe to a T with great results each time.

This is awesome!  I've made other similar dishes, but none hold a candle to this one.  Spot on, Chef John, spot on!  This will see a lot of action at the LTH house.  No changes, other than using a couple more garlic cloves because, well, why not.  THANK YOU, Chef John!

Excellent and screw-up proof. I know, I screwed it up the first time I made it and it ended up perfect.  I didn't have the chicken stock (I thought I did but I was wrong) So I drained an 18 oz can of progresso chicken noodle lite and used it. It still tasted great. Everyone loved it.

Delicious, I substituted grapeseed oil for the olive oil and added almonds slivers and a dash of lemon. Turned out great and took way less than forty five minutes. My only concern was it ended up a bit too salty, next time I'll go with low sodium chicken broth and won't add any extra.

This recipe was surprisingly good.  I was skeptical at first about the amount of liquid, but make sure that you first don't over-cook your pasta, and that you add the cheese in at the same time as the broth/stock.  Remember that you have to let the pasta sit for a bit so that it soaks up the broth.

Love this recipe as it is presented. Another way to incorporate the broccoli stems is to peel the stems all the way through, as you would a carrot and add to the pan.  Vegetable broth makes it vegetarian.

I've been making this one for quite some time, replacing the broccoli with sliced black olives. The amount of broth is just personal taste. I'll try broccoli next time- I'm sure it will be good.

This was very good and very healthy.  Will make again, love that it uses all of the broccoli because the stems are the most healthy.

All Recipes has really taught me how to cook. I am grown but have not been very successful in the kitchen......until now. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was so yummy. I was getting stressed out trying to follow the recipe and I accidentally threw almost all the broccoli stems away. I just used what I had left. My daughter wants me to add some chicken next time tho. This recipe is added to my recipe box. I will also be following Chef John!Thx

Absolutely delicious! For my family's taste preference, I decreased the grated cheese and red pepper slightly. Each serving was then topped with toasted, buttered panko breadcrumbs. I will make this again. It's great for a quick weekday dinner.

Fantastic recipe, easy and delish.  I use a bit more crushed red pepper because we like a bit of a kick, and extra Parmesan never hurt anybody.

Wonderful! Definitely take the advice of others and way undercook your pasta. I used very thin spaghetti and cooked it for half the recommended time. Stir-fried some cut up chicken ahead of time and added at the end. Also added some broccoli slaw to the cut up stems since I had some on hand. 
Hubby gave it two thumbs up! Will absolutely keep it in the rotation.

Perfect. I used three bullion cubes in the water instead of broth just because I didn't have the broth on hand.

Not as difficult to make as I thought it might be and the taste reminded me of Scampi.  I did not have Red Pepper Flakes, but did have a Red Bell Pepper.  I chopped 1/3 of the pepper very small and added with the broccoli stem pieces.  The rest of the pepper, I chopped large and added with the broccoli tops.  The only other thing I did differently was to add the pasta to the sauce instead of pouring them into a clean pot.  Didn't need to dirty an extra dish.  The taste was very good and had perfect amount of garlic.  I am definitely going to make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Loved this nice alternative for a side dish that covers carbs and vegies.  We made as written except we didn't have the recommended cheese, so I used grated Parmesan and it was still fantastic.  Next time I will either lessen or skip the red pepper flakes and seasoning because it got a little spicy for my little one.

I made this exactly,, added grilled chicken at the end - tossed it in.  I thought it was okay. Kind of bland, even with the high end cheese.

I liked this but didn't love it. Made it just as the recipe said and although it was good, it wasn't a favorite with my family. I have to admit it was better the next day.

This recipe is excellent! I made 1/2 recipe tonight for the two of us for dinner tonight.  I diced 1/2 chicken breast and sauteed that in butter with 4 oz fresh sliced mushrooms. Then made the recipe as directed and added the chicken and mushrooms and a splash of dry white wine to the sauce just long enough to heat through.  My husband absolutely loved it.  I will make this again.

One of my favorites... I used to order linguine with broccoli at Italian restaurants until I realized how much fat it contains. I also consider this a main meal... who needs meat every time?!?! Very filling and delicious. One way to cut back on the fat content, if that's a concern, is to use half the butter and maybe a little more broth. Excellent!!!

The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is the amount of liquid that didn't cook down.  I cut the water/broth in half, and it was still too much.  I purposely didn't add all 3 cups at once, thinking it was WAY more than I've ever used other times.  So glad I did that.   I did change it up---used Asparagus, slicing the stems into small rounds, since the asparagus we get this time of year is a bit tough in the stalks.  Sauteed asparagus slices in 1 cup chicken broth added to garlic/butter/oil mixture.  Added a packet of Chicken Stock (dry)and 1/2 cup pasta water when I added the asparagus tops and some snow peas to the final mix.  Was hoping the excess liquid would get absorbed when I poured it over the pasta---no such luck.  It was still great, but next time I'll probably cook the pasta a little less before I add the veggies to the pasta--could be I overcooked the pasta before draining it so it was less prone to absorbing additional liquid.  First time is always a learning process.  Can't wait to try it with broccoli, though I plan to make it with asparagus and snow peas again.  Was a huge hit with hubs!

This was a better healthy recipe, but we sure missed a creamy Alfredo sauce.  I will share this with my daughter-in-law as she will love it and use it with spaghetti squash.  I will add a sauce next time and it will be so good.

Added more garlic, a full stick of butter and ended up leaving out the broccoli because it had turned and I didn't realize it. So since no broccoli, I simmered the pasta in the stock and added some parsley. The sauce was still a bit thin (my fault since no broccoli) so I added a couple Tbsp flour just to thicken a bit more. Would be good with some grilled chicken :)

I do similar without the soup, cheese, red pepper flakes, and butter.  I add slivered carrots and sometimes some slivered almonds and black pepper to taste.  This addresses some dietary restrictions.

Excellent recipe!  So delicious!  I just added some chopped , toasted pecans before serving along with the cheese for a little crunch.  However, it would have been great without the pecans, as well.

Excellent recipe! Any pasta will do.  I used rigatoni and added sundried tomatoes to the leftovers.  My husband and two children (ages 7 and 8) loved it.  Kid friendly recipe also excellent recipe for guests/company!

Feels light and yet filling.  The red pepper flakes really add the flavor.  I had some crimini mushrooms around so I sautéed them in butter and tossed them in at the last minute.  My husband  loved it too.  I will be making this easy dish again.

Not bad! I liked that this recipe uses all of the broccoli...has you cutting up the stems and simmering them first, because they can be sort of tough sometimes.

Very good! I halved the recipe, just to use it for a side dish, and added a little extra chicken broth at the end b/c it looked a bit dry. The flavors really get into the pasta and make a tasty dish. A nice, light, fresh tasting pasta. This was super simple to make too...I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. ;)

Had no idea how it would work (I am truly an All Recipes kind of cook- no recipe, no can do.) But everyone absolutely raved about the flavourful combination. will definitely add to my repertoire!

We thought this was okay. Everyone ate but no one was raving about it. I'm not likely to make this again but it was a nice and easy way to use up extra broccoli.

I used thin spaghetti rather than angel hair and only used 2 cups of broth. Looks so basic, but is surprisingly flavorful. It’s nice and garlicky and spicy. Family loved it.

If you’re sensitive to spice go easy on the pepper flakes! But besides that, great recipe, super easy to follow and complete. I seemed to have a decent amount of excess stock that required turning the noodles on simmer to absorb, but still yummy!

Oops. I hit the done button on accident and I don’t know how to go back and edit my first review but I was saying it was delicious and the only changes I made were that we used a gluten free brown rice pasta and we added pulled chicken to it after to make it a main dish. A++

I wish I had a bit more "sauce" but I probably used too much pasta. Otherwise, nice and garlicy, the broccoli cooks PERFECTLY and the red pepper gives it a lovely spice.
Will definitely be making again in the future.

This was great. I followed the recipe exactly other than 2 changes: I used regular spaghetti instead of angel hair since that's what I had on hand. I also decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp, since my mom is super "spicy" sensitive. She said it tasted great, but still a bit too spicy for her. My boyfriend on the other hand loves spicy foods; he said it wasn't spicy but was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I made this as a side for chicken parm.

It was a great side.

This was a great recipe! After reading many reviews, I sauteed some sliced mushrooms along with the garlic. I grilled chicken tenders and chopped them and added them to the pasta and broccoli just before I served it. I used low sodium chicken stock, but I salted my bowtie pasta water. I found that along with the salty grated cheese, made the dish just right. I had invited our 22 year old grandson to join my husband and I for dinner. At first,he was a bit hesitant about the pasta, but after a few bites he really began to enjoy it. My husband said it was one of the best pasta dishes I've made in a long time.  It is a definite keeper and one I will be making again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was the best recipe! Easy to make and very tasty. I do not like the broccoli stems so only used the crowns. We served it as a side dish but could easy add some cooked chicken and make a main meal out of it.

I will make it again! I didn't understand the part about broccoli sauce, though. I only had frozen broccoli available, so per my usual, I steamed it. Also, I didn't have any fresh garlic, but I did have refrigerated minced garlic. I followed the recipe to the best of my abilities & I can happily say that my Dad & son loved it! Thanks!!

Yes I will make it again the entire family really enjoyed it. The only change I made was the amount of chicken stock. Started with 1 1/2 cups let it cooked down then added an additional 1/2 cup. This left enough sauce to mix with the pasta  and cheese.

I’ve tried this dish experimenting on my own for years and never could get it right. Red pepper added a nice flavor and the mistake I was making was the amount of chicken stock. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

My family really enjoyed this dish but all agreed that it was missing something.  I did add shrimp since we all enjoy seafood, but it was still lacking in a special flavor. I liked that this was a healthy meal and would definitely make it again but would add either blackening, creole or another seasoning.

Very one note flavour. Easy enough to put together but bland. I usually love chef John's contributions but this one is not a winner for me. Sorry!

This was wonderful!  I added cut up chicken with the garlic as another reviewer suggested.  And I omitted the red pepper flakes since some of the group don't like heat - but I placed the shaker on the table in case anyone wanted to add some.  The chicken broth that Chef John used in the video is the best, has good flavor without being salty.  

The plate was beautiful with the bright green broccoli and chunks of chicken amid the pasta.  We had hard rolls and a salad to complete the meal.  Everyone at the table was happy, including the 3 year old.

For a time saver I used minced garlic from a jar.  Didn't add pepper flakes during cooking to make it kid friendly. (I sprinkled some on mine after plating.)  Came out great! Kids loved it, too.  Quick and easy!  Thank you.

This dish came out good, through I did reduce the chicken broth to 2 cups initially, adding about another 1/2 c before serving.

Tasty! Made this on a Wednesday night after work.  Enjoyed the light prep with the awesome product.  I followed the recipe exactly, scaled down to two people... Its got lots of fabulous flavor with that taste of a long prepared dinner.  For those, of you of you who don't like crushed red pepper and/or garlic because of the heat, this recipe has a wonderful "flavor" without the heat. Definitely will put into the monthly rotation at our house of two!

My children loved this!  I added chicken - and when they ate their fill, and had eaten all the chicken out - two days later I put in fried bacon - a two meal wonder!  I made way more than I would have considered as 4 servings.

Turned out great, my kids even liked it. The pasta soaked up the broth like the recipe said, worked out great. Will definitely make it again. I used vegetable broth and doubled the garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I made minor changes, but only because I thought 4 T. of butter was too much for us and we prefer roasted broccoli. I tossed the broccoli with olive oil and roasted it in a 450 degree oven (preheat the roasting pan in the oven while it's heating and while prepping the broccoli) for 15 minutes, or until browned.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe except cooking the broccoli in the pan. I simmered the garlic in 2T butter and 2T olive oil, added red pepper flakes, then simmered in chicken broth to reduce and flavor the broth for about 15 minutes. I added the roasted broccoli when tossing the cheese and cooked pasta to  heat to serving temp. Yum.

This was good in spite of my inept cooking skills. 
Here's what I did wrong:  1.  I let the sauce cook down too much so the end result was a little  dry.  It had good flavor in spite of this.  2.  I used pre-grated Parmesan. (Next time I make this I will use a better cheese and I will add some mushrooms to the sauce.)  3.  I only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  It needed the whole tsp.
I never go wrong with Chef John's recipes when I PAY ATTENTION to the directions and when I watch the accompanying video.

I made this and just did a few things different.  I had pork broth so I used that instead of the chicken broth.  I also added fresh green onions when I added the broccoli tops.  My kids and I loved it!

All in the family agreed this was very bland. Even using  regular chicken broth (instead of low sodium like the recipe calls for)  this still needed extra salt added at the table. Everyone also asked to add more cheese to help with flavor. I sprinkled my own with Lemon Pepper, which added a nice zing. I would make this again, but doctor it up with some additional seasonings. I also found it to be watery, as other reviewers mentioned. I think next time I will make it a one-pot meal by cooking the pasta right along with the broccoli in the chicken broth. That will eliminate the extra water and ensure good flavor in the pasta. Great idea here, but it needs work.

Thanks for your sharing from Thailand! I am very new to cooking, but I found this recipe to be very easy to comprehend and follow. It all went well, except for that my mother thought I smelled horrible lol. Everyone liked it. One cons for me, not for the recipe itself of course, is that I was hungry again pretty fast after having eaten this! I think that's because it lacks some protein perhaps. Looking forward to trying other recipes of yours.

I love Chef John like everyone else. This is a great side dish or add protein to make it a meal. I added extra Parm/Regg and it still wasn't very cheesy. I'll likely pair it w/ Crispy Fried Fish from this site.

Had fresh broccoli from our garden so I was looking for recipes with broccoli & pasta. Came across this one and surprised my hubby this evening with this meal. I added mushrooms and omitted the red pepper flakes.  We really enjoyed it! He keeps telling me, this is Pretty good :) Will be making it again!

I made it vegan by substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth and margarine for butter. It was very tasty, but 1) way too much broccoli (I made it with slightly less than half what the recipe called for and still thought there was too much broccoli) 2) my broccoli stems were still quite tough after cooking them according to recipe (but maybe my pieces weren't small enough). I'll definitely make it again, with modifications. Also, I think it pairs much better with freshly ground pepper for garnish than red pepper flakes..

Only change - added some chicken to it - cut it into about 1" pieces, sprinkled with garlic salt and some pepper, and cooked in the olive oil til it was about halfway done, then added the garlic and butter and finished cooking it.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  Tried this sorta by accident a while back when all I had in the house was broccoli and pasta (I always have the other ingredients).  Tonight we are having it for the 4th or 5th time.  Just love it!!!  Only thing I do differently is use regular thin spaghetti rather than angel hair.  Perfect!

This is the second time I made this and it has become a true favorite. I did not change the recipe at all even though I think you could easily add chicken if you insist on having meat. There's just two of us so we will get at least three meals off this recipe and that's fine with us because we LOVE it!

This is very good. I substituted spaghetti for angel hair and so cooked the spaghetti a little longer. Thanks Chef John

The way this recipe should be made.  No mushy broccoli and I loved how the stems are cooked first and then the florets. Thanks Chef John!

I did not have any broccoli this time so I left it out. Still delicious. I will make this again and again using different veggies...can't wait to try zucchini. Super easy! Makes great leftovers for a hot or cold lunch.

My family of four (including 2 teens), loved this! The only change I made was to use whole wheat spaghetti, since that is all I had available.  I followed the video's advice and let it sit for a full five minutes in the pot to cook a little more.  This was a healthy, filling meal!

I have some very picky eaters in my house.  Even my worst critic (my boy that will only eat hot dogs,chicken nuggets and plain pasta with butter) enjoyed this dish.  It was so flavorful with so few ingredients.  I used the whole grain, high protein pasta and it was tender as could be.  Great dish, highly recommend!

Really good but the broth mixture did not quite make enough. It did coat the pasta, but I would have liked some more liquid to mix through the pasta.  I'm adding some shrimp to the leftovers tonight.

I found that the angel hair pasta stuck together.  I think it would be better with a macaroni instead of a spaghetti.  I think it needs something more too, maybe anchovies, for more flavor.  I will be looking at other recipes.  FYI, Ina Garten adds lemon zest and the juice of one lemon to her recipe.  I think this could be the secret ingredient this recipe needs!  (Along with the anchovies!)

Good recipe!  It actually freezes well too, reheated with a little broth (much better than frozen convenience meals in the stores).  Thanks for sharing!

I thought the sauce was going to be more flavorful than it ended up being. I probably should have added more salt than I had, but I'm not sure if that would have made a big enough difference.

Wow, this was great!  I grilled some Chicken Sausage before I started cooking this and I served slices of that on the side for family to add to their pasta bowl.  No changes are necessary with this dish, it is perfect as is!

Talk about a Chef John moment!!! I served this with his wonderful Roast Beef Tenderloin (the video is fantastic for technique!!!), and my kids (including SIL who doesn't believe ANYONE can cook as good as he can!), have been raving about for weeks now!!  I've also served it with chicken, cooked on grill using no "BBQ sauce", but marinated in "Good Season's Italian dressing" (from the packet).  Wonderful combination of meats & side dish(s), & worth the little "extra" time, since it's both carb. & vegetable!!!  Blessings

This is a great and easy recipe. Quick to make, too. I do not like broccoli stems, so I leave out the step about cooking the stems separately and reduce the stock to about a cup. Makes a great side to a protein or a good one-dish vegetarian meal.

When I read this recipe I couldn't wait to try it. I had a package of Broccoli and Cauliflower pieces so I used both. I couldn't make the sauce because I didn't have stems so I proceeded blindly. OMG, It was amazing! I kind of sautéed the B&C in the olive oil, but did the trick with the Chicken broth and the pasta. I will make this over and over.  Making it tonight for my dinner, and yes will use both veggies again....YUM

Great recipe, full of flavor and simple to make. Only thing I changed, I used vegetable stock as I am vegetarian, but the rest of my meat eating family still loved it.

Why is it then whenever I use Angel Hair pasta, it always balls up when trying to mix?  I also found this to be lacking in taste somewhat (use more garlic, and I put a LOT of Romano cheese on it while eating).  I may try again using fettuccini or something with a bit more body.
