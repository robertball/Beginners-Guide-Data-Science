I've made this 5 times.  I can say that we prefer more cream cheese and the sweetness of the imitation crab. I used the S&S sauce from Lana's Meatballs.  It's the best homemade S&S sauce I've made so far.  I use the recipe as a base and season to our liking.  I've also made different variations.  Smoked oyster, beef bacon and feta with buffalo dipping sauce.  Parmesan chicken with mushrooms and spinach with Chef John's mushroom gravy.  I folded it as directed and also in a triangle.  While the triangle is easier, the crispy edges from the "pyramid" folding are better tasting.  I just need to master getting all they air out so the don't explode.  Great recipe.  Thanks Chef John!

I've tried a few different crab rangoon recipes and this has been my least favorite.  The soy and worchestershire sauce completely overpowered the filling and that is all I tasted.
I also like the idea of 4 crunchy "fins" but there was not enough room for the filling.

Be sure to get good wonton wrappers. The ones I got were not as thick and all that delicious filling burst through while frying  (argghh!).  So I had to ditch the nicer fold suggested by Chef John and doubled the wrap. This time it kept really well (although it wasn't as pretty and you don't get the crispness of the edges). One reviewer said to make sure you get all the air out to avoid bursting. Too bad I saw that suggestion too late.  But doubling the wrap worked for me.
By the way, if you do the simple triangle fold, you could keep them in a freezer bag and take them out to fry the following day and cook from frozen.
I also used a different sweet and sour sauce. But the crab rangoon was really delicious. Thanks again Chef John for a wonderful receipe. Keep them coming! :)

Shouldn't really rate this, because I made it as fundidos - so much easier than those little wraps!  Just spread the cream cheese over flour tortillas to within 1/2 inch of edges, mix crab with a little mayonnaise & seasonings and put about 1/2 cup into center of each tortilla.  Fold side in to make a square packet & use toothpicks to hold together, if desired.  I found I didn't need them if I browned the edge side first.  Cook about 5 minutes on each side in about 1 inch of peanut oil in a large fry pan at 400 degrees.  Yum!
PS:  If you have tortillas left over, cut them into triangles & brown in same oil.  Drain on paper towels & sprinkle with powdered sugar and a little cinnamon.  You have a great dessert as well.

I have made this twice, the second time I left out the fish oil and they were much better. Too fishy with the oil, it over powered the filling.

We really didn't care for this. The crab and fish sauce are overpowering. We will go back to plain Jane cheese wontons.

I made these for my husband and he really liked it.  He is a chef so it is hard for me to do anything right by him! This recipe makes a lot so I will make again next time I have guests.

Thank you again Chef John! I only thought I loved crab meat rangoons but now realize the only thing I have ever had at  a Chinese restaurant were cream cheese rangoons.These were absolutely delish. They not only looked fabulous but tasted amazing. 
Thank goodness the recipe made enough to make more tomorrow night.

I had been having a craving for crab wontons for months and finally gave in with this recipe. These tested better than ones I've had at restaurants. I did some with the 'warhead' fold, but eventually just did most with a triangle fold because it was faster. Super tasty.

I made these and took a picture before frying. They were gone before I could photo them after they were done. I think that means they were a real hit. I don't know myself I didn't have one. Everyone loved these but not the dipping sauce. Made as written. I will be making these again and maybe I'll get to have a couple.

The actual time to fill, fold and deep-fry a recipe (with a 1 liter deep fryer) was about 2 hours.  This does not include the refrigerator time.  I am not a real fan of fish sauce, but I used it anyway, and the next time I make it, I'll leave it out.  All that said, they looked fantastic and tasted very good (fish sauce notwithstanding).

freakin awesome.i did find they were better with my homemade S&S sauce. However, Chef John's sauce is actually better than cocktail sauce to dip shrimp  and crab in! it has a nice punch to it. Anyway, the blue crab is the bomb, but a little more challenging to find. Well worth your time. These Rangoons are dynamite.

I made this as a dish for a Chinese night with about 12 friends and everyone loved them. The only issue I had was when cooking them the crab kept boiling out of them, otherwise 5 stars.

I left out the crab practicing to make this for my mom (she's allergic).  Filled with half chocolate hazelnut, half jalapeno cream cheeses, with fresh garden herbs (I have cinnamon basil and german thyme).  These were amazing!
I'll make them with the crab next time though.  I crave rangoons sometimes.

These are delicious! I did not have soy or fish sauce but they still came out great. I made Lana's meatball sweet and sour sauce recommended by another reviewer and it was delicious paired with Chef John's crab rangoons. I did a 1:1 ratio of crab:cream cheese and although there were 10/10, I would do a higher amount of CC to crab next time (just because I like them creamier). I made in a deep fryer and it was super easy to get the hang of the "warhead" shape. Will definitely make again!

My family loves this recipe! The only thing I added was 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the cream cheese mixture.  It balanced out the flavors well. The first time I made it without the brown sugar, the cream cheese was a little too salty for my taste.

We used less cream cheese and stone crab claw meat. It was very good. folding the little pockets was time consuming, but worth it.

Made these for New Year's Day and they were pretty good. I prefer a sweeter taste to the filling so I may try it with lobster next time and skip the fish sauce. Dipping sauce was a little too hot so I'll cut back the sriracha next time. Video was very helpful for creation of perfect "pyramids" and they came out crunchy in just under 3 minutes.

I doubled the cream cheese, left out the crab. I didn't have fish sauce so I skipped it, and I used a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic.  LOVE this! I was terrible at folding the wontons so I gave up and ate the filling with crackers. So good. I also added more chopped scallions. This is a great recipe for people to adjust to their preferences.

I'm not one to criticize another mans work, but just to save you the headache my wife and I experienced this morning...you might want to skip this recipe.  We made it EXACTLY as stated.  The taste: Fishy. If we were to order this at a restaurant, we'd send it back. Can't blame the crab, it was sweet and tasty.  Maybe the fish sauce?  And for the dipping sauce in this recipe... it's not one I would ever serve with crab rangoon. We didn't like it, and I love most all things Chinese, Thai, Asian, etc. We ended up pitching everything in the garbage.  This guy is a likable guy, and the video is great.  And, thanks to Chef John, I learned the techniques of folding wanton wrappers. But based on this recipe, I doubt I will try anything else he has published, as our flavor profiles vastly differ.

I just wasted the ingredients to make these. I followed the recipe exactly. They are definitely missing something and don't taste anything like what you buy. Very bland.

I made these although they are not like the ones that I use to make and lost the recipe to. I also added about a half a teaspoon of A1 for that extra spice.

I should have used smaller rice papers and worked harder at getting all the air out.  I also would have liked a bit more cream cheese.  Flavors were delish and after I got the hang of folding they started to look pretty good.  So...more cream cheese, smaller wrappers and next time I might take a picture.

This was an awesome game time football snack! I followed recipe exactly except I cut the cream cheese in half as we enjoy the crab flavor more than the cheese. I didn't have any issues with wontons exploding. Also, not sure These are added to the list of new family faves.

Loved the recipe and it wasn't too hard to make.  I did  NOT like the ketchup based S & S sauce though. I'd like something smoother and lighter tasting.  We didn't let the cream cheese soften so it was KINDA hard to fork.  Had to use a knife and cut the ingredients in.. BUT since it was cold and we could make it into little balls easier we just went ahead and made them instead of letting it sit for 1-2 hours in the fridge.  It was a family project. My daughter that is 11 doesn't like crab so we did all the same thing for her (all the ingredients) but left out the crab. We just need to find the best sauce!  Thanks Chef John.

I loved this recipe . The  only thing I changed on this was that I cut the recipe in half due to only my husband liking crab Rangoon. He helped make it and found that it was pretty easy and tasted great!

Just made it today. I dont know something is wrong with the flavour. Maybe the worcestershire sauce? I will do it again without that sauce. Also my first batch bursted. So the next one i deep fried was double wrapped. I will try to experiment more with this recipe.

Thanks for this recipe Chef John!  The filling burst during the fry, so I had to take it out sooner before it got golden brown.  Very tasty and crispy even without any sauce.
