I liked it due to its simplicity and that it's low-fat, but had to make some adjustments. I used whole-wheat fettuccine, and added broccoli in with the fettuccine for last 3 min of the cooktime. Meanwhile, I sauteed a small onion (sliced) with baby bella mushrooms (salt, pepper, garlic salt); additionally, I threw chicken tenderloins on the Foreman (salt, pepper, garlic salt).

This came out a little bland. Part of this is my fault - I likely should have made more sauce to compensate for the added veggies and chicken. However, I think next time I will make sure to sautee the baby bellas with some red pepper flakes for added kick.

Great base recipe though, and I will use this again - with my adjustments.

I made this for my husband and I as a quick lunch yesterday. I used whole wheat pasta. Very simple and filling but bland. Next time, I'll add some fresh minced garlic. Yes, I get that it's reduced fat but that dosen't mean sacrificing flavor.

This was aewsome!!! Sauce was amazing! People are forgetting this is virtually a fat free alfredo sauce! I did fat free cream cheese spread instead and it was to die for still! I didn't mix the sauce with the noodles, I cooked noodles, put them over a plate, then put the chicken slices on the noodles pouring sauce over it. I also used entire box of fettucini and just 1 and a halfed the sauce recipe and it perfectly fed 4 people.

mmm! The cream cheese makes this alfredo so yummy-minus the guilt. I add a little broccoli to mine and make it super healthy.

I JUST MADE THIS RECIPE TONIGHT AND IT WAS A HUGE HIT! I GRILLED SOME CHICKEN BREAST ON THE GEORGE FORMAN AND SLICED THEM AND ADDED THEM TO THE NOODLES AND SAUCE. QUICK AND EASY AND GREAT FLAVOR!

This is a wonderful and simple recipe - it works out to be pretty inexpensive, too, since it doesn't call for very much parmesan or cream cheese. This sauce has lots of flavour and it would be easy to add in vegetables and other spices, though I loved it made as directed in the recipe.

This was amazing!!!  I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he thought it was the best thing he had ever had!  Let me explain--he has gastric reflux disease and cannot eat foods that are high in fat or super spicy.  Basically, that rules out alfredo and he hadn't had it in years!

Anyways, I tripled the recipe because I knew we'd want extra sauce.  I made his with the chicken broth, flour, fat free cream cheese and parmesan cheese (I could not find light so I used regular).  It tasted great and he was super happy to be eating something he hadn't had in forever!  I added salt, pepper, and parsley to mine for a little extra oomph.  The meal was absolutely delicious, especially when I threw in chicken, broccoli, and mushrooms.  MMmmm!  I will be making this again!

This recipe is great. I used 150% more sauce though because I don't like dry fettuccine. Omitted nutmeg because I didn't have it. Great and healthy.

A fabulous way to enjoy Fettuccine Alfredo without all of the guilt.  The only change I made was to omit the nutmeg.  I am a huge fan of the spice, but since others in the family are not, I just left it out.  Next time, I will be doubling this because leftovers were also delicious and my kids really loved this dish!

sauce was thin so I ended up using another block of cream cheese.  I increased the recipe to feed 8 and had leftovers.  It was delicious, extra calories and all.

Great bc I had everything on hand (I don't usually have cream or half-n-half, and milk is sometimes iffy), and this was very easy to make.  Bonus points for passing the hubby's picky palate.

As a "lighter" meal this is great.  The flavoring was wonderful and it felt indulgent without making me feel guilty. That being said, it doesn't taste EXACTLY like true fettuccine alfredo, but then, nothing really can compare to the real thing.  If you're looking for a lighter version though, this is a great, easy recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make- I actually used Neufchatel Cheese instead because it was cheaper from the grocery store and everyone in the family couldn't tell the difference! Would recommend it!

This was really good! I didn't use quite as much chicken broth as it called for because I wanted the sauce to be a little thicker and it turned out great. It definitely doesn't taste like the fatty, heavy kind of alfredo, but is pretty darn close and you feel a lot better about eating it. Adding smoked salmon to this was amazing!

I made this recently for guests but I added some garlic to it.    It was a hit with everyone.  My recommendations...  add lots of garlic and don't use whole wheat pasta (the wheat has too strong of a flavor and texture for this sauce).

I was quite surprised by this recipe, actually.  It seemed to easy to be any good, but it really is.  The only change I've made is to exclude the nutmeg, only because I never seem to have any in the house.  The recipe is fine without it.  It's so quick and simple, and my very picky fettuccine alfredo eater gives it two thumbs up. So do the rest of us!  Have used this recipe multiple times already.

To make this even easier, I used the garlic herb variety of the cream cheese spread. Basically you boil the broth, then add the cream cheese and parmesan, simmer down a bit, and done!

very good base for any seasonings you prefer.  I added Chulula sauce, onion seasoning, garlic, and lots of Penzeys Red & Black pepper.  This would also be awesome seasoned with Cajun seasoning.  It's a really good start, add your own style to it though, don't be afraid to experiment!

Great recipe and so easy to make...made it exactly by your recipe and the ratio of sauce to pasta was perfect for us.  Loved that you use cream cheese instead of heavy cream. I'm adding this to my recipes for sure!

Excellent recipe - just a tiny bit bland for my taste, so I added garlic - garlic is good in almost anything!!  I used whole wheat pasta flour instead of white flour, and added some fresh spinach at the end.  Served it over whole wheat pasta - it was great.

Overall I liked this recipe and will make it again. It's a little bland and does require moderate seasoning, but that's obviously a fixable thing. I added a little extra cream cheese to the sauce to thicken it little more, and I also added broccoli and chicken to the mix. I made 6 servings so there's plenty for leftovers :)

I have tried another alfredo recipe on this site, that is highly rated and asks for milk.  I had planed on making that tonight however, didn't have enough cheese.  Thought I would give this a try and I LOVE IT!  I won't be making the other anymore.  I put this over egg noodles and with diced ham, LOVE IT. Can't wait to make it again!** Update.  I was out with friends this weekend.  And one of them was RAVING about this sauce I whipped up for them! It made me smile!

The nutmeg was very overpowering in this dish.  IF I decide to make this again, I will definitely cut the nutmeg in half. I wasn't impressed with this recipe and neither was my husband.

I am a HUGE fan of fettuccine alfredo! But I have been loosing weight and wanted to be able to make it without eating a ton of calories and fat! So when I found this recipe I was very excited. I think this recipe is awesome! I will make it again and again. I think it tastes just as good as regular, maybe not quite as rich, but that's actually ok with me. My husband even thought it was excellent and he can be picky. I thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I doubled the sauce, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Once the pasta cooled abit, it became a glob, plus it was very bland.

This is one of my favorite low-fat recipes; you really think you're getting the real deal.  It is creamy and tasty, and not a "heart-attack on a plate".

Good recipe! We weren't super worried about the fat, so we added bacon and chicken. Husband loved! We'll be making again.
