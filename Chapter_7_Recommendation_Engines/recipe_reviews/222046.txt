This is a great way to use up beets from the garden. It was very tasty even without having the sweet onions and parsley to include. I also used feta, since that's what we had on hand. I always wear gloves now when working with the beets, and it makes life so much easier. My husband just suggested maybe adding a little more honey next time. I will definitely be making again and probably need to double recipe, since everyone enjoyed so much.

Great salad recipe as-is! I think the key with the onions is to use sweet onion. I also let them soak in the dressing before adding the rest of the ingredients.

I LOVE pickled beets and this tastes just like them!  I could have eaten the whole bowl by myself.  I didn't even include the walnuts, onion or parsley and they were still that delicious.  I used my pressure cooker which cooked the beets in 15 minutes vs 1 hour in the oven.

I didn't like beets as a child, but have been challenging myself to retry foods.  I LOVED this recipe!  Great flavors and textures!

I thought I would eat this entire dish myself!  The onion, dare I say it...overpowers the dish a bit, I would scale back to a scant tablespoon, or omit it to really concentrate on the beet/blue cheese flavor.  I was concerned there wouldn't be enough dressing, but it was a perfect light coat.  I always roast beets so this will be such a welcome addition.  Thanks!

I love this salad! I am Casein intolerant, so I just omitted the blue cheese.

Easy and elegant way to dress up a salad for a dinner party. I used canned beets and it was still great! Plus, it looks so pretty served over baby spring greens. I used almonds instead of walnuts since that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious. I'll make this again for myself and for company.  I was thinning out my beets and was looking for a recipe to use them up.  Thank you to the recipe poster for a truly unique recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  It lends itself to variations and I made some, as usual, using some from the recommendations from the reviews and some from my own tastes.  For the dressing, I added a bit more honey, added about a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of dijon mustard. Instead of the sweet onion, I used some Pickled red onions that I had made and it worked really well with this. (sliced red onions, red wine vinegar, sugar and salt) I also used feta cheese.  I had 2 people ask me for the recipe so I guess this worked.  Thanks for this recipe and for the recommendations for adjustments.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe per directions and it was wonderful.  If one is not fond of feta cheese this salad made with blue cheese is great.  Am making it again for dinner and I will be made again many times.

This made me love beets!  Simple to make, and very tasty.  I like to add the feta cheese and walnuts right before eating, to keep it crunchy and bright.  Oh, that parsley is more important than you think.  I forgot once, and couldn't put my finger on what was "off" about it.

Simply a delicious recipe!  I may have added just a wee bit more blue cheese than the recipe calls for, because I love blue cheese!
I've added it to my recipe box, and will be making more, soon.  It's Great!

Made this for a potluck, so doubled the recipe and it was excellent.  I did as another reviewer recommended and reduced the onion to a couple of tbsp rather than 1/4 cup.   The combination of flavors is wonderful.

While I love all the ingredients in this salad individually, the blue cheese did not work for me.  I will make it again at some point and try it with Feta cheese instead.

Trying to find cold vegetable dishes for summer that are low calorie and low fat and this fit the bill.  Followed the recipe with no changes.

I used tiny, garden fresh beets. I didn't have plain balsamic, so I substituted lemon infused balsamic and apple cider vinegars in its place. It came out so fresh and beautiful. I can't wait for my guests to arrive to join us in this feast that includes this beet salad.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used canned beets so I didn't have to go to the baking process. I didn't have red wine and I used feta cheese. Even with these changes it was delicious. Def I will repeat it!

Delicious!  I did double the dressing, but probably didn't need to.  I think it would be just as good with canned beets and a lot less work.

Very good salad!  I served it on a bed of dressed greens which made a nice presentation.  Next time will add more walnuts and cheese.

If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would!  This is INSANELY delicious!  I used leftover roasted beets and I only had cilantro, so I used that instead of parsley which I think I would have preferred anyway.  SO GOOD!!!

Oh my, I loved this! I will admit that I purchased a jar of delicious sweet and spicy baby beets from a farm stand and did use those, wanting to do something different with them. To try it out, I made just a small bowlful, adding the parsley, walnuts, onion, salt/pepper and blue cheese. I wanted it more moist, so I drizzled with a little olive oil and beet juice. The end result, I believe, was pretty close to what you'd get from the recipe. So many healthy ingredients is a plus! A definite keeper, someday to try with exact ingredients. Thanks byrnesette!

Good and easy to make in advance and leave in the fridge.  I leave a good half cup of the cheese and chopped nuts in a separate bowl and add them at the last minute so they retain their own flavors and are not soggy.

Also, (full disclosure), I was lazy and used canned beets.  :-)

I used vanilla fig balsamic vinegar, and substituted crumbled feta for the blue cheese. Perfectly delicious!

I thought it was a good way to serve beets that keep coming out of my garden! I cut back on onion and used feta cheese only because I don't care for blue cheese. Also, I didn't have parsley, but tasted good without it. Thanks for recipe!

Simple and delicious dressing for beets.  I left out the onion - just personal preference.  Also, substituted goat cheese for blue cheese.
