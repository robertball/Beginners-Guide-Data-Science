Groovie! This is your basic smoothie, but sometimes simple is delicious! I had fresh strawberries that I froze and used fat free yogurt and skim milk. I used less milk to keep it a little thicker. I chilled my glass and enjoyed this very much!

excellent, the entire family loves this smoothie. Sometimes I use 1/2 cup frozen blueberries and 1/2 cup frozen strawberries, this is also very good.

I love strawberries and banana smoothies. The only change I made was using plain yogurt and some splenda to sweeten as opposed to vanilla yogurt. Delicious!

My family liked this recipe, but it seemed like it made closer to four servings instead of two. Three of us couldn't drink it all. I am not a yogurt fan, but I liked this. I think some sugar would take away the tartness of the strawberries a bit, as other reviewers suggested. I am anxious to try with blueberries.

This is better with only 1 banana, fresh strawberries, vanilla soy milk, and some crushed ice. Makes a great quick breakfast!

I froze both the banana and the strawberries and sweetened it a little with sugar.  Also added vanilla flavored soy powder.

It was very good...it needed about 1/3 cup of sugar added to take the strawberries tartness away. Maybe a few ice cubes too. Yummy!

Because this calls for common fruits and ingredients one is more apt to have on hand, this is as easy as it gets to whip up a smoothie. There's nothing unusual or unique about this one - it's just good.  Other than adding a little Splenda to sweeten it up a tad, Hubs was happy with this prepared just as written.

This comes pretty close to my favorite smoothie.  What I do differently is:  freeze my chunks of banana as well as strawberries, blend with 1 container of any flavor lowfat/nonfat yogurt and sub 1/2 cup OJ for the milk...also add Splenda and vanilla extract to taste...Delicious!!  Try it...you'll be hooked!

this recipe is deeelicious!
i made it as my breakfast smoothie and it was amazing. lots of flavour, and very sweet. When I made this recipe, I didn't use frozen strawberries, i used fresh strawberries, its good either way, and i used 1 and a little more of large bananas( i didn't have small ones at hand) It still tasted good!

In trying to get my 1 year old to eat more fruit I turned to smoothies and this one did the trick.  I scaled the recipe to 1 serving and put leftover in fridge for lunch.  I used fresh strawberries and had great results!

This is so good it is almost sinful!! I used frozen blueberries instead of strawberries, but when I have strawberries I will also try those. My husband does not like blueberries or yogurt and had 2 glasses--what he doesn't know won't hurt him I guess! Thanks for the recipe.

Great and simple recipe!  We used lowfat strawberry yogurt and added a touch more milk since we like ours a little lighter and not as thick.  It works with a variety of fruits, all are yummy!  We've made this a few times now and the key is 1 part frozen fruit to 1 part fresh fruit.  So if you are using frozen bananas, make sure the other fruit is fresh, unless you like them super thick.  We use vanilla soy milk for an added health boost, our kids LOVE it!

I recipe almost exactly like this for my 2 year old.  He is literally addicted to it!  I use frozen fruit because it keeps longer and if your bananas get too ripe just cut them up and throw them in the freezer for the future!

DIRTY GROOVIE SMOOTHIE: (An excellent summer treat.)  In the mood for a fabulously refreshing alcoholic beverage?  Follow directions as written except, instead of using 3/4 cup milk, use 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup vodka (or rum) and 3 Tablespoons dry powdered milk.  Also, as many other reviewers have stated, I usually add some sugar or Splenda to the mix.  ENJOY!   I have been using this fabulous recipe for a couple of years now and everyone loves it.  I often don't have the exact ingredients specified so I will substitute more strawberries for bananas, different fruit for strawberries, cottage cheese, vanilla and some sugar for yogurt, etc.  It is a very easy smoothie to throw together with ingredients on hand.  Thanks!

A really smooth and versatile smoothie recipe that can be played with. I used frozen bananas but fresh strawberries. One cup of ice and more milk were used for a smooth but chilled result. I only used ½ cup of the plain type yogurt but added 1/8 tsp of vanilla extract and 2 tsp of sugar.

Love this and so does my boyfriend.  Sometimes I replace bananas with frozen blueberries, I like that one better.  Though more milk is needed.

Yum! My 5 year old and 10 month old loved this. I used strawberry Greek yogurt instead because it has twice the protein! So creamy!

This was a hit with my husband and 3 year old.  We didn't have strawberries, so I used half raspberries and half blueberries.  Per another suggestion, we added some honey to sweeten it a little.  I also added ground flax seed and cinnamon for nutrition and taste.

This is much simpler than the last smoothie I made, but oh sooooo much better!  I used fresh instead of frozen berries, and strawberry yogurt since someone ate my vanilla!!!  Was very yummy and will be my staple food for the next few days since I just had a wisdom tooth pulled!!!

I recommend not to use milk because that overpowers the taste of the strawberry/banana part of it. Other than that great smoothie!

This smoothie is basic, mild tasting, and easy to make. I will probably make it again but it could be better. It tastes like it needs something...maybe orange juice or some sweeter fruit in it.

I tried this and unlike any other strawberry banana smoothie I attempted to make, IT WAS GREAT!! I tried using strawberry and banana yoplait yogurt instead of vanilla, and it was AWESOME! I also tried bluberry yogurt, and it was EVEN BETTER! Sorry I am just so excited it worked out! :D

This was really good! I used fresh strawberries with a teaspoon of honey. This turned out really thick, though, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk to even it out. That made it better. I didn't have vanilla, so I  used plain yogurt.

I couldn't make it exactly as written because I only had fresh fruit (nothing frozen) and a 6-oz container of strawberry Greek yogurt.  I added a few ice cubes and 2 T of honey, though, and it came out pretty good.  Next time I will either use more ice or try to have some kind of frozen fruit to throw in because I would like it to be colder.

This recipe was ok. To me it was a little tart. I followed the recipe but i didn't have vanilla yogurt. Instead i used plain yogurt and i added several packets of splenda and i tsp. of vanilla. I should have read some of the reviews closely. Other than that it was good.

Not bad! It actually tasted like a strawberry banana smoothie, the ones at Mr. Smoothie or Smoothie King. However, it didn't have as much flavor as I hoped it would. It wasn't cold, so I'd definetly recommend adding ice. Also, I used regular strawberries because I didn't have frozen ones, as someone said before.

Delicious!  My banana was frozen and I threw in more strawberries.  I love it thicker.

This was ok. It tasted too much like yogurt even with the fruit and I normally like yogurt. Kids didn't care for it at all.

This was very good. I froze the bananas beforehand and used more strawberries than called for in the recipe (about 2x as much) along with a handfull of frozen blueberries. I didn't have any vanilla yogurt so I used plan yogurt sweetened with honey and vanilla extract. I added a few ice cubes while I blended it to make it a little colder. My husband loved it. I think next time I might try strawberry flavored yogurt as suggested by other reviewers.

This smoothie is the best I have had in a long time, its sweet, creamy and very fruity. I didn't have any vanilla yoghurt so I used stawberry mullar light, so mine is very berry, next time I think I am going to use some ice to make it a little for refreshing for breakfast! Great!

it's a pretty straightfoward recipe but it's just what i wanted so thank you :) i made about half and added a bit of sugar to sweeten it up a bit. i'm kind of confused about why it was compared to jamba juice in one of the reviews, it's milk, yogurt and fruit blended, so don't be suprised if it tastes like milk, yogurt and fruit ... a lot of the jamba juice drinks have sorbet or frozen yogurt in them and if you want something like jamba juice all the ingredients in their drinks are listed on their website...this is what it is, and if it's what you're looking for, then don't hesitate to try this recipe.

Instead of doing low-fat vanilla yogurt, I used vanilla Greek yogurt. I used a Fuji Apple instead of the banana and it turned out amazing!!!

Definitely a good and super easy basic smoothie, but I would’ve liked a little more fruit flavor. Maybe would use more fruit/less yogurt next time.

Very good! And you can add or leave out ingredients. Very versatile recipe!!! I didn't have bananas so I threw in some blueberries with the strawberries. Since I was using a fresh carton of Blue Diamand Almondmilk, it was not cold, I also threw in some ice cubes. 
I added some sugar, I like things sweet. YUMMY!!!!

I make this using apple juice in place of milk, gives it a more tart flavor.  I made it with milk the first time but it was too bland for me.

We added only one banana all you need. Plus the smoothies that we made the second time were actually thicker than the first time we made them. In my opinion the thicker ones were better.  Very filling smoothie. Loved It!

My daughter watches The Fresh Beat Band on Nick Jr., so when I said we were going to make "Groovy Smoothies" she was super excited!  If you know the show, you know what I mean!  These smoothies were super easy to make and were delish!!  I plan on adding different fruit flavors to change it up every now and then, but this is a great smoothie to make as is.

I loved it!! I made some modifications though; I added a splash of pineapple juice & orange juice and tsp of honey. I don't buy low-fat foods, so we used original Activia Vanilla yogurt. We'll definitely make this more often :)

My strawberries were refrigerated, not frozen. I added just a little ice and almond extract and enjoyed for lunch. Not many ingredients needed, so I had everything on hand. Just what I was looking for. Thanks Clara!! This was sooo good!!

I only used 6oz of yogurt (since mom didn't listen) but it still tastes like it has too much yogurt. And I added a tablespoon of honey since I like things sweet.  I'd like to try it again with a frozen banana to thicken it. But I don't plan o trying this recipe again since it's tasty but I think I can do better.

Very good smoothie.  I added a little honey and a little lemon juice to balance it out a bit.  The consistency was perfect for me as it was not thick at all - but I did let the blender run for a little while.

Came out nice and smooth. I would probably follow what others did and freeze the bananas as well. Other than that I used Almond Milk to lower the calories a bit and I also added a little flax oil for some Omega-3. Tastes yummy!

Pretty good. I used FF plain yogurt with a little vanilla flavoring, FF milk and frozen bananas. Good way to start out the morning. Pretty basic.

Great Smoothie. We have tried several from this site over the last few days and this has been the favorite so far for everyone here. I did add a handful of fresh strawberries and a few ice cubes and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing!

My 3 kids loved it! I tripled the recipe for the 4 of us- but none of it was leftover! All I had was 8 oz. cartons of yogurt- vanilla & strawberry- so that was what i used. And it was all snarfed up! Thanks for sharing!

We've been trying a bunch of smoothie recipes since we bought a blender, and this may be our favorite so far.  The proportions are perfect--the two bananas make all the difference.  This also worked wonderfully with strawberry yogurt (see, we've already made it twice!).

The best strawberry banana smoothie I've tried so far. I used strawberry banana yogurt and added wheat germ and honey, very good. I usually make two servings for me because some put it as 8oz serving sizes, this one is definitely two tall servings.

I loved this so did daughter's boyfriend. Daughter number one didn't like it at all but I didn't expect her to as she's not keen on strawberries. Daughter number two liked it but didn't rave. However that's all down to personal taste if you like strawberries and bananas you'll love this. Very easy and quick will be adding this to my healthy breakfast list. Thanks

This a fairly good and easy smoothie to make.  It does taste yogurt-y which is a slight detraction.  Sometimes I substitute the vanilla yogurt with vanilla ice cream depending on my mood.  It isn't as healthy, but it's a lot more yummy.
