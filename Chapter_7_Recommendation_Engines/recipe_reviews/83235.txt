Very easy to make and tasty. I added some chili paste instead of the cayenne and an onion & garlic. Will use this instead of my usual packet mix from now on!

This is great! Finally I have found a recipe from scratch! I use plain beef sausages add diced onion apple slices (and sometimes diced bacon:)) and serve on mashed potatoes with greens on the side and my kids come back for more... I can never make enough of this for the family - its always ALL gone.

Superb sausages! We used mild Italian sausages and slow cooked them for about 3 hours. Tender flavorful excellent!

We really liked this and I would make it again. I used smoked sausage and because that's already cooked it cuts down on the prep time. The only change I would make next time would be to make more sauce. I served it over rice.

A great sauce however I found it lacked something. I added onions and of course salt and pepper and what I think is the missing ingredient a couple tbsps of barbecue sauce. These additions made it superb.

Outside of substituting red pepper for for the cayenne pepper I followed the recipe except doubling everything to make 8 servings. Very tasty and if my son says it was "yummy" then I know I scored a hit.

Kids hated it wife loved it...I would add more spice next time (probably some liquid smoke paprika etc.) and cook the sausages with some garlic and onion for added flavor. Goes nice with mashed red potatoes and carmelized onion...

As a new cook, I wasn't quite sure what type of sausage to use, but I ended up using a beef smoked sausage. Served over homemade mashed potatoes. I thought it turned out fine and would have given it 4 stars because it is easy and quick. However, my husband said it tasted "weird" and he doesn't want to have it again so I went with only 3 stars. Fine...the leftovers are all mine!

We love this recipie over mashed potatoes or pasta it's a real hit for my 4 and 5 year old. I toss in the apples and onions and garlic others suggested and a bit of spinich for a bit of green. But this is such a simple recipie you can do what you want to it the sauce is amazing.

I love this receipe. I always brown my sausages first then fry off sliced onion & apple mix my sauce up seperately then add to sausages onion & apple mix. I tend to double the sauce receipe also have a play with the Worcestershire sauce ratio usually half that mixed up with Rocket Fuel sauce delicious & spicy:) I also cook mine in the oven.

Very good recipe. I used Hillshire Farms smoked sausage. I also added about 1 t. of corn starch to the water to help thicken the sauce a little bit. I didn't have any tomato paste on hand so I substituted with 2T of spaghetti sauce. Worked out great. Will make this recipe again.

Okay this recipe was/is awesome but one thing is troubling me which is whether to use light or dark brown sugar. Otherwise that than this recipe is really tasty. I made it for my trip to P.A. for lunch and everyone saw it and was like "What is that?" and I said "Deviled Sausages." They all tried it and LOVED it.

This is a great recipe. Super quick & easy. I added onion & a little more water to the sauce to make a little extra. It was great the kids & my husband liked it. I will definately make it again great when you haven't got many ingredients at the end of the week!

This is a great recipe. I served it with mashed potato and green beans and the family loved it. It has become a favourite quick meal. I sometimes add 1 tablespoon of fruit chutney for a bit more zing.

This is really good to be so easy! Great sauce!! I added a little garlic salt might try onions next time. We are a house full of picky eaters and we all devoured this including the kid!! Served with mashed potatoes and oven roasted corn...10/10 for a Monday night!! All done in 35 minutes. (Corn took the longest)

I wasn't too sure at first but ended up really liking it. After browning the (smoked) sausage and including the other ingredients (used ketchup for tom. paste/br. sugar) added water and white rice and let the rice cook until done. We had it with a little cheddar sprinkled on top. Very warming and filling.

I don't care for sausages all that much but would certainly use this recipe again. I used Cumberland sausages added some onions and garlic and made a mix of paste and chopped tomatoes. As usual at this time of year I made it in a fry pan on top of the frig in my hotel room in Thailand. Ideal recipe for those circumstances.

Delicious! I tweaked it a little - Husband likes lots of sauce and does not like anything too "runny"; to avoid this I doubled the sauce quantities and added half a regular can of diced tomatoes a bouillon cube and thickened it slightly. You could do this with any type of sausage and even pork chops. Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight. Very nice. Added 1/2 a large onion. Only other change was to increase sauce ingredients by half again (except water and cayenne) for a stronger flavour. Cooked pork sausages on stovetop until almost done then added everything to slow cooker. Wonderful flavour. Would definitely make this again. Enjoyed by all of the family. Thanks for a lovely recipe.

I used 2 pkgs. kielbasa sausages for this.  Nice change from steamed and browned on the stove.  Added some hot sauce to the skillet.  It tasted like Bbq sauce to us and might be easier to use that, doctored up.  Still, a good and easy dish.

I sauteed onions and added the sausage and mixed the sauce together outside the skillet. Because of my kids I did not add the cayenne pepper. Perfect for left over snags from the bbq.

Wow this was amazing. I used cajun chicken sausage some leftover pizza sauce instead of paste Dijon mustard and a pinch of corn starch. I served it over microwaved mashed sweet potatoes. Quick and delicious!

I really liked this recipe. I think I will double the mustard to give it a little something extra.
