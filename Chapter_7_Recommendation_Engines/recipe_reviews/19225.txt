Disaster on my first try!!  Not sure what happened, I have a feeling I went to happy with the alcohol.  This batter would not set.  (still tasted good, but very rich), I may try again with less liquid called for and see if that helped.

i think i did everything correctly when making this recipe.  however, it did not set... yet.  i've been waiting for 2 + hours and beginning to think that it is not going to set at all.  it does taste delicious and i wish i could salvage them but i'm afraid that they can only be eaten with a spoon.  :(  any suggestions!!!???

I tried this recipe and followed the instructions carefully but I still came up with a runny batter.  I even tried to thicken it a bit with more sugar but it still won't form into balls.  Too bad, it sounded so good.

Have made these every year for the holidays for 20 years.  They are a family favorite. Use the brandy extract intead of brandy.  What has worked for me is to chill the dough for approximately 1 hour.  Then scoop by rounded teaspoons, shape into 1" diameter balls, roll in chopped pecans and store in a very cool place or refrigerate.

Use 1 teaspoon brandy extract, not brandy
