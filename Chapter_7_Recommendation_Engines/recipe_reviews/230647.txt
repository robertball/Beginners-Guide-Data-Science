This was your basic Mexican cornbread with the flavors you expect.   I thought the flavor was pretty good, but, the texture was very soft.  It fell apart when we picked it up, so, we just ate it with a fork.  I do think 2 cups of cheese on top seemed a little too much.  The cheese got brown and crusty on top which we loved, but, it was very difficult to cut through.  If you like Mexican cornbread - this would fit the bill.  I would suggest just adding the cheese to the cornbread mix though instead of on top. Probably would reduce the amount from 3 cups also to 1-1/2 - 2 cups.

I absolutely LOVE this cornbread!!! It’s wonderfully crispy on the edges, a little spiced, and ooh so cheesy!

Delicious. My changes: I used self-rising cornmeal.and omitted baking powder, then forgot to add onions. I used cheese on the top-only. It is soft for a time after baking and will need to sit for a while if you want perfect slicing. I prefer to eat it warm and imperfectly sliced.

I already had corn in my chili so didn't put the corn in and I mixed half of the cheese in and put the other half on top. It was perfect. Very nice texture, great tasting. I'll make this every time I make chili. I like that this recipe doesn't use regular flour or sugar at all!

I made it to go with my homemade chili.  Loved it!! I am not a big fan of cornbread, because of the sweetness. But this was cheesy with a little heat!

It was o.k but even though I like jalapenos, I think I would leave them out if I made it again. Seemed to overpower and throw off the taste.
I used less oil than called for , and the texture was moist and held together nicely. Used less cheese and mixed it right into the batter. Still a cheesy flavour. Baked up nicely in a 9 x 9 pan for 40 minutes.

Omit the corn if desired. Total cheese used: 1-1/2 - 2 cups. Mix half the cheese into batter, the other half on top. Perfect; very nice texture, great tasting.  Even better cooled. It’ll be soft after baking and will need to sit for a while if you want perfect slicing. I prefer to eat it warm and imperfectly sliced.                                 For true Southern taste, fry up some bacon in the  skillet beforehand and use it instead of the shortening/oil/butter.
Do not leave corn bread in skillet after baking or you will have a crumbly, broken mess on your hands.
Parchment can be used for easier cleanup/removal from the pan.                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like that this recipe doesn't use regular flour or sugar at all!
