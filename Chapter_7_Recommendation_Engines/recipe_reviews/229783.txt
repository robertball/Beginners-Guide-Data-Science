Really great!  Used all butter (no Crisco!) Pecans are best if chopped REALLY fine. Chilling the dough helped.  I was making these for a reception so I wanted them small.  I made them smaller than 1", then "thumbprinted" them with a wine cork.  I also used a raspberry "all fruit" spread (in a ziploc bag with corner cut off for EASY application.)  Made 5 dozen. I will definitely make these again!!!

Since the recipe didn't list the oven temp, I tried out 350 degrees. My first batch took about 17 minutes to get done (I had them on the top rack), but they were a little overdone.

I did my second batch for 13 minutes on the middle rack, and they got done perfectly. 

Also- it seems silly, but I used my pointer finger instead of my thumb to make the imprint, and the cookies looked way better. The pointer finger makes a more even hole, especially when making such small cookies.

Very tasty! I didn't think it would make 4 dozen, because it didn't look like a lot of dough, but I got 45 cookies out of mine. I would have had 48 if I'd made my first batch the correct size. I didn't plan for the dough to expand as much as it did.

This is the recipe my family uses, except we use all butter.  Also,  1" is a little big (they do spread). I prefer to bake them for 5 minutes in balls, then pull them out and press them, and put back in the over for 8 or 9 minutes.  I always put the jelly in after they're out of the oven, so the jelly doesn't run!

Very good.  I've wanted to make these for years but the recipes always seemed too time consuming or difficult.  This recipe is easy to follow.  I used all butter instead shortening.   A few suggestions from other comments really helped keep things simple.  Chill the dough before rolling it into balls and also put the jam in a ziplock and cut a corner off to squeeze the jam into the thumbprints. Thank you for sharing and thank you also to all of you who left suggestions/tips in your reviews!

Oven temp is 350.  This recipe will make less than 4 dozen regular size cookies.  In order to make a bite size cookie, use a nickel size cookie ball.

This is how my family made Raspberry Thumbprints for years.  Only differences are all butter with no shortening and we added the jam right when the cookies came out of the oven still warm.  If we wanted something different we replaced the jam with a room temp Hershey chocolate kiss (make sure its pressed into the warm cookie right when they come out of the oven since this will slightly melt the chocolate kiss to adhere to the cookie).

Although these cookies are a bit labor intensive, the results are worth it- they’re delicious!    I used all butter, instead of part Crisco, and tried peach jam in some of the cookies.  We liked them but preferred the raspberry ones.     
All in all, a great cookie, and I’ll definitely make them again!

Used all butter and chilled the dough.  Used a Ziploc bag to pipe plum fruit preserves.  Turned out perfectly and smelled amazing when I pulled them out of the oven.  This is now one of my favs; everyone loves them.

I used all butter and I  used walnuts instead of pecans and ended up putting them in the dough as well as rolling the balls in them. I had my homemade cherry plum jam to substitute for raspberry. I did bake for 15 minutes at 350. My sweetie loved them.

Just like the cookies from my childhood!  My daughters loved these cookies as much as I did. The crunchy nuts, buttery cookie, and sweet jam are a perfect combination.
