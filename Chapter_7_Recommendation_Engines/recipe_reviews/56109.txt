Loved this recipe.  Made some changes and they tasted like the restaurant ranchero beans.  I presoaked the beans by putting them in hot water and letting them sit while we went to church (I actually goofed and threw 1/2 pinto beans and 1/2 blackeyed peas by mistake, but it turned out great!)  When I got home around 2ish, I transferred them (with their liquid) to the crockpot.  I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp bacon grease (didn't have bacon).  I let this cook for a couple of hours and then added a large handful of fresh chopped cilantro.  (I didn't use the jalapeno or tomato.)  I added salt (about 1/2 to 1 Tbl)to taste near the end of cooking time.  It took about 4 hrs to get a great tasting bean with some juice.  You could drain and mash (I "mash" in the blender with some liquid) to get refried beans - might try that with some leftovers, if there is some!  Great recipe!  Did cut in half though!

These were very good and easy..I cut the recipe in half since it was serving for 24..made plenty for 8-12 people.  Also I soaked dry beans overnight and then cooked in crockpot with all ingredients all the next day adding a teaspoon and 1/2 of cumin which I think gave it more flavor..seemed a bit bland without...they were great..a keeper!

Was really hungry for a warm pot of beans and this did it!  Had no fresh tomato so put in a can of diced with green chilie.  Also soften up a couple of cloves of minced garlic with the onion, jalapeno and bacon.  These were seasoned just right!

Gave it 4 stars, because I had to add a bunch of seasoning to the mix.  Added cumin (2 tsp), chili powder (1 tsp), and salt (2 tsp) and it was still a little bland.  Then I added some homemade taco seasoning (2 T) and cayenne (1/2 tsp).  DELICIOUS after the seasonings were added!    This is a great building block recipe.  You can spice up or down.  Yummy!!!

IMO, anyone who bothers to soak their beans first is just wasting time! All I need is a few hours to cook them, on the weekend or after supper for the next day. There is one thing that is not mentioned, you need salt but not till After they have softened or they will not get soft. I use chicken bouillon. I season these beans with almost anything in the spice rack,bay leaves, smoked paprika, garlic, cumin,pepper,oregano. My hubby loves beans and would eat them every day. If you want to make Cowboy beans out of this, use a can of pickled jalapenos,chorizo,ham,bacon,tomato, cilantro. These are Great for a party! Garnish with sliced radishes, cheese and sour cream. Thank you sheilamichael for sharing this wonderful dish.

OMG...these are SOOO good.  I was in a bit of a hurry, checking side dish recipes to go with my carne asada tacos, at 4:00 pm on a Sunday. I happened, though, to have canned pintos in my pantry. I followed the recipe substituting the canned pintos. YUMMY!  My sweetie loved them too!

These are great - they taste like the beans at our neighborhood Mexican place. I trimmed most of the fat off of my bacon and added a little diced ham that needed to be used. I also left the lid off for the last hour, stirring occasionally, to thicken the 'sauce' a little. We added a little s & p, and some hot sauce when it was served. I halved this recipe this time - and wish I hadn't. Next time I'm going all the way so I can have some leftover. Thanks!

My husband called these beans "southwest" style, rather than Mexican, but he loved them.  He did suggest using a smoked hamhock rather than bacon.  Very tasty without being too spicy for "northerners".

OMG!!!!!!!  What a FANTASTIC recipe!  I have been trying to master this style of beans for a decade and thanks to this recipe, I finally have!  I made as written (as in I didn't omit anything), but added 1 Tbsp cumin 1 tsp chile powder and garlic powder and my secret ingredient was 1 Tbsp of dried minced onion.  The saltiness and potent flavor of the minced onion really pushed this dish over the top.  I also briefly blended them in my food processor for a more "refried" consistency, It also blends the flavors really well.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, it is a keeper!!!!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out bland.  However, they look just like the charro beans at my favorite mexican restaurant and with a few seasonings next time, they will have a much better flavor I'm sure.

We have eaten these for about a week now. Delish! They go with so many meals. Even had them at brunch with egg tacos. Used a little bit of worcheshire. Lots of garlic. Some of our homemade salsa. Cooked them longer than suggested. Thanks!

I loved these beans but my husband hated them due to the cilantro!  Followed recipe exactly except used a serrano pepper with seeds and membranes instead of jalapeno because I had one that needed to be used.  Just a little bit of subtle warmth.  Will probably make again without the cilantro.

Thank you! I am a transplant from the West Coast and I have missed really good Mexican food. I wanted some refried beans and I don't know what possessed me to look up the term Mexican beans. Anyway, the long and short of it is that these are the beans I grew up on. I only used a couple of tbsp of cilantro because I was low and because I quick soaked the beans, they cooked quickly. I added some red bell pepper, but it was just to use it up and I am sure that it would be great just the way you made it. I will steer clear of using the whole bunch of cilantro because I know so many people are cilantro adverse. 

This is a wow recipe and very simple. I made it last week and we're making it again tonight. 

For those that like fresh flour tortillas but can't get them, Mission now has raw tortillas that you cook on the stove top. They are next to the canned biscuits at the super market. I honestly was blown away by the tortillas. The bean burritos were awesome. For the record, I am in no way affiliated with Mission, I just hate store bought flour tortillas and these were seriously life changing. I even spoke to the manager at Super Target to make sure they don't stop carrying them. 

This is a GREAT recipe. I have been talking about these beans, to anyone who will listen, for a week.

Fantastic recipe.  Instead of bacon, I added a left over spiral ham bone from Easter, so delicious!

Yummy! Love beans. I halved the recipe. Left out the jalapeno and mushed up about half of the beans. Easy and fantastic. Thanks for the recipe.

These are really good,especially after a few days.  I added a can of green chopped chilis, garlic, and some spices like chili powder and cumin.  I also used turkey bacon to cut down on fat

These beans are bland without dressing them up with some seasoning. Instead of 1 medium tomato, I add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and then I also throw in 2 teas. cumin, 1 teas. cayenne (or more depending on how spicy I want them), 1 teas. chili powder and salt to taste. They don't remind me of Mexican style beans, they're more like southwest style beans (like the ones you get at Chili's, only much much better) Give them a try, they're fabulous!!

Loved these beans! My mother in law makes THE BEST frijoles rancheros. I'd been wanting to make them myself and let me tell you, this was the best recipe I found. They smelled great and tasted even better!

You know this is a great recipe when my girlfriend from southern Mexico asks for the recipe. We love heat so the only real change was to add more peppers. I have made this several times and have seasoned around the style of meal I was planning. This is a big reason why these beans deserve 5 stars. This recipe lends itself perfectly to adaptations. ( Imade it exactly to recipe specs the first time which was well received by my family of 7)

Excellent basic recipe. I was only cooking for two so only had perhaps 4oz beans. I soaked the beans in chicken stock or boullion, and used this as the liquid for cooking. I also used pancetta which gives a wonderful smokiness to the beans. Try to avoid trimming the fat, as it gives the dish flavour, and is pretty pointless in a carb rich dish like this. Also added half a teaspoon of brown sugar, half a bay leaf, thyme, plus chili and some cumin as per the @twilkins version. The garlic garlic clove (added whole) was mashed into the beans at the end when I mashed about 20% of the beans into the sauce. Probably not very authentic Mexican after my treatment, apologies to sheilamichael for that.

This was delicious.  It was the first time I've ever made beans from dry beans (from scratch).  My daughter had requested homemade BRC burritos (beans,rice,cheese) like from El Pollo Loco.  This recipe tasted even better than theirs!!!!

I used this recipe for our Mexican Fiesta and it was an ok dish. I ended up with a ton of leftovers and it turned out to be more of like a refried bean consistency. So because of that I used the leftover beans to make a 7 layer taco dip and they made a better comeback and because of that I just made different bean dips with this recipe.

I love refried beans but these didn't turn out very well. Not creamy enough, kind of gritty. And very "beany" tasting. Like pinto bean soup tastes instead of like refried beans taste. Don't know what it would need to change that.

WOW WOW!  So, we cooked this forever, and it wasn't cooking, the beans were hard... and I about gave up.  Made another drink, hung out with my friend, and when we went back to the pot about 2 hours later, the beans were AMAZING!!!  If you think they aren't great, then keep cooking them.  I promise.  Best beans I've ever made!!!  (BTW, we don't eat meat, so added onion, green pepper, can of diced tomatoes).

Everyone loved these beans. My brother said they were the best beans he ever had! Great flavor.   I had canned beans so I used those instead, which reduced the cooking time. Other than that, I did the recipe as listed. This is going in our favorites box!

Really delicious!  Served this as a main part of the meal, not just a side dish.  It went over really well.  The only thing I changed was I used a can of red kidney beans instead of pintos, because I don't like them.  I also added just a sprinkle of old elpaso taco seasoning to the mix as it simmered.  It turned out so good!

Great recipe and agree with one reviewer that there's no need to pre-soak, just wastes time.  I used pretty much the same ingredients except I did not pre-cook the bacon and onion.  Nope, I put in a few slices of raw bacon and the chopped onion when the beans started to get soft.  I also chopped up some garlic and pepper and put that in.  Did not use tomato at all; just not necessary to me.  Also must keep on hand some salt to add to taste as it cooks.  When said and done you WILL end up with genuine, authentic Mexican beans.

These are fabulous! I have never made beans from scratch before, and these were easy. I added salt, white and black pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The hubby loved them! I will be making these again, thanks sheilamichael!

I made this recipe and served it to 8 of my friends last night at our Mexican party.  Since I am not a fan of spicy foods I was reluctant about putting all of the jalapeno pepper into the recipe but the next time I make this I will do so.    As in some other reviews, I also found it bland, however, those of my friends who visit Mexico annually say that these beans tasted exactly as those in Mexico.  I would definitely make them again.

When I told my family that I was making this recipe, they were not excited. We usually have boring pinto beans and smoked turkey, but this definitely wasn't that! They ended up loving it. I halfed the beans and used a can of diced tomatoes and chiles because that's all I had. I also add chili powder, sea salt, and taco seasoning. I still used a pound of bacon because the family kept asking "Are mexican beans ALL you're cooking?" "Is there going to be meat in it?" I wanted to make sure they'd see the meat and that it felt like a meal. I also added a few cloves chopped garlic in with the onions. I was worried that the bacon would go soggy, but after 3 hours of cooking the beans, by the time I added the bacon mixture, the beans were pretty much done, so that wasn't a problem. Even the one who hates beans in my family loved this. I crisped up some corn tortillas (we were out of tortilla chips) and served those on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe serves up a very tasty bowl of beans!  I grew up on these types of beans and this recipe rates up there in the "Like Mama used to make".  It is easy to follow with simple steps.  The servings are hearty and can serve as a meal all on its own.  Anyone interested can mix the leftover beans with chorizo sausage on tortillas and make another great meal

I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't taste it much as it was way too spicy for me. Husband gave this 3 stars and said it didn't really taste Mexican, and that it would have been better without bacon, perhaps with some lime juice (which I didn't have, unfortunately). Thanks anyway.

I halved the recipe, but used a whole Roma tomato and a whole jalapeño, added 3 cloves minced garlic with the onions, and added a tsp of cumin and a tsp salt, based on other reviews. Delicious! Served 10, with leftovers for us to enjoy with Huevos Rancheros, etc. Yum!! I will make these again!

These beans are so good, even without the bacon or additional seasoning. The recipe states that 2 lbs of dried beans yields a serving for 24, so I halved the recipe, but it made such a small amount, I had to make another batch.  Make more than you think you'll need.

I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and rather than adding  bacon to the beans, I added a tbs of bacon grease. I also added a clove of garlic , salt and pepper. I did not add the onion, tomato, cilantro and jalapeno to the pot but served on the side to be added at everyone's preference. Good basic recipe.

A nice recipe as is, but I added about 1 tbs of smoked paprika,  1 tsp of ground cumin and about 1/2 tsp of ground oregano. This is a great side dish that won't overpower the main course like a traditional chili might.

Hearty and flavorful.  I didn't add in the cilantro and I did tweak the recipe a bit... instead I diced one whole white onion, 1 whole green bell pepper (seeded), 1/2 fresh jalapeno (seeded) and caramelized them in olive oil first, then I added them into the  beans in a crock-pot with chicken broth.  I also threw in 2 small diced Roma tomatoes  that had been sauteed in olive oil and oregano.  Added them into the crockpot about 30 minutes before serving.  Spices included:  Fresh minced Garlic, onion powder, black pepper, salt to taste, 2 tsp chili powder.  Absolutely Yummy!  Next time I'll garnish wish scallions, cheese, and sour cream.

Really good beans, but I've got add, with the exception of cilantro, we've been making beans like this for as long as I can remember, and longer here in Tennessee.                                                        
Still great beans,!!

The picture looks wonderful but mine weren't very good following the recipe as written.  I may try some of the suggestions in the reviews today to salvage them.  I wonder if the taste I didn't care for was the bacon I used.  I think I will stick to ham hocks from now on like my mother always used. And not all my beans were tender without the over night soaking and I cooked them 2 hrs more than recommended.  Very disappointed.
