I greatly enjoy the flavors in this drink especially the intensity of the raspberries. However I think that next time I will double the amount of cocoa. They go so well together I would just like a slightly difference balance. That is the best thing about this site. We can share and modify. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I really like this.....not as sweet as I expected in a good way. I used chocolate almond milk as well as Coco powder but omitted the sugar. I also added an extra half measurement of the milk because it was too thick with out it.

8.22.16 Didn't have any coconut sugar but I did replace the almond milk with coconut milk. Wouldn't say this is my favorite icy coffee drink (husband simply didn't care for it) but it was different. I do like the chocolate-raspberry combination and the fact that you can drink it guilt-free which you can't do with many others.
