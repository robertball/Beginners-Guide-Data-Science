Great recipe! It's very versatile. I used zucchini, squash, broccoli and carrots. I also substituted fettuccine for the bow tie pasta since I didn't have any. I used a rotisserie chicken and just added it in at the end. Delicious! I will be making it again.

I thought this was awesome! Only changed veggies since I don't care for zucchini or squash so I used stir fry veggies . Great flavor, consistency and seasoning....I even uploaded a picture of what mine turned out looking like.  I did add extra pepper only because I'm a pepper freak! Thanks for a different recipe that I hadn't even thought of trying, will definitely make again and again....

We normally love any lemony chicken dish but didn't much care for this. I know that cornstarch sauces can be weird so I finished it with a pat of butter but that only helped a little. I think the peppers and lemon didn't work together.  If I were to try again I would omit the pasta (and probably the peppers) and serve over rice . It's not likely that I'll make it again, though. So many recipes, so little time!

If I were to make this again, I would not use the cornstarch. I think I would flour the chicken and use a bit of pasta h2o. I need to rate it just ok purely on the weird consistency of the sauce. The taste and other prep was fine. I did use lemon pepper on my chicken, I thunk it would be lacking without some seasoning!
