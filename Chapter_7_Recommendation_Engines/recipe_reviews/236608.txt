I followed the recipe as is with the exception of the cheese choice. I didn't have enough cheddar so my cheese was a blend of cheddar mozzarella and Asiago. It was delicious but a bit more salty than it needed to be. What I am baffled about is the size of the pan in the recipe. The dish did not rise at all so I had flat squares. I think I would use an 8x8 pan next time so the squares have substance. It might take a little longer to bake that way but at least they would be higher and prettier to serve. Otherwise this is a decent recipe.

These are so addictive!!! I'm telling you these are just amazing. The only thing I do different is add fresh lemon juice. Sometimes I add green beans to make a bigger batch. This is a keeper for families and for parties.
