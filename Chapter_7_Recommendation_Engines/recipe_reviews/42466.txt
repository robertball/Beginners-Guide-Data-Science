This was fantastic! Since I saw the review that said it was lacking something, but they weren't sure what, I went ahead & added the salt that was called for in w/the meat. I used just a little more salt than was called for to make sure the meat had enough flavor on its own. When I removed the meat from the pan, I added in the green peppers, & cooked them alone for just a little while. Then I pulled them out, added in a little olive oil & put in the onions, cooking them till they were translucent along w/a minced clove of fresh garlic. Then I added back the peppers & added in the canned tomatoes. The tomatoes I used were already seasoned Italian style, but I still added in the Italian seasoning & pepper called for too. We don't buy instant rice, so I made our rice like we always do, separately (but while all the other ingredients were cooking), w/some salt added to the cooking water & added the rice into the pan right b4 we served it. I left the 2 cups of water out of the pan b/c of that; but we realized once the rice was in the pan that there wouldn't be much sauce since we didn't add that extra water, so we added 1/4 cup tomato juice and that did the trick. The entire thing is AWESOME by itself, but we topped it w/fresh shredded Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. I know the way we did it sort of defeats the 'one pan' recipe it's intended to be, but it was still very quick, & I'm sure it turns out great w/the instant rice too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

For me personally this was a 5 star recipe to work off of. I absolutely love stuffed green peppers & am thrilled to have made a dinner that tastes just like it w/out having to deal with the actual peppers to stuff.  This is what I did: I browned a lb. of beef, removed it from the pan. While I did that I cooked up  white long grain rice. Next time I make it, I will cook up only 3/4 cup rice with 1 1/2 cup water. I added beef bouillion to the rice, but next time I'll just add it to the main mixture. Anyway, I put into my hot pan a medium sized green pepper cut up into bit sizes, let those soften for probably at least 5 mins turning often. Took those out & put in about a 1/3 of a chopped onion & a clove of chopped up garlic, cooked that for a few mins, added the water, a can of Italian styled tomatoes, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, a 1/4 tsp of pepper, & added back in the peppers. Simmered that for awhile until the peppers were crunchy but soft the way I like them, then added the amount of rice I wanted in the recipe, added back in the ground beef. Warmed it all up quickly, scooped it into bowls & put lots of both cheddar cheese & mozzarella cheese on top. I think it tasted like the stuffed peppers I've made before, but was easier to make and clean up after. Try this if you like stuffed peppers!

Very good recipe!  After I cut the peppers and onions and already had the meat browned I realized I didn't have any rice!  When I combined the water, peppers, onions, tomatoes and seasonings I added an extra 1/2 cup of water and a 1/4 box of ziti noodles and softly boiled uncovered (to evaporate the some of the water) for about 15 minutes until the noodles were done and then added the meat.  Only other variation I made to this was to melt mild shredded cheddar over the top.

I've made this quite a few times and I think I found my favorite variation--it definitely takes out the "blandness" the other reviewers were talking about. I started with a few slices of bacon, chopped into small pieces. I sauteed them to render the fat and until slightly crisp then added in the ground beef (turkey is great too!). I followed the directions from there except added in an extra pepper (whatever color), a clove or two of garlic, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of regular. When I put the beef mixture back in I added a small can of pinto beans (10oz i think) to make it a little heartier for the boys. I found it a little dry so I used some leftover sauce I had in the fridge. Topped with cheese at the end :)

My mom made a recipe like this when I was growing up, except she used diced zucchini instead of green peppers.  This was very good!  And you can use regular rice if you don't have instant - just simmer for 20 extra minutes or until the rice is done.  I love this with parmesean cheese sprinkled on top.

I can't believe how simple and GOOD this recipe was!  I thought it would just be a quick fix dinner, but it ended up being fantastic!  And so easy!  I added fresh garlic, red bell peppers (since it was all I had on hand) and about a heaping tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  Yummy!

I never made stuff peppers but was craving them and I started searching recipes and came across this one.  I did follow some of the ideas I read in the reviews and changed it up a bit.  It turned out exellent...better than stuffed peppers without the hassle.  And a cinch for my toddlers to eat.  I used the following ingredients:

1.20lb of 95/5 ground beef
2 cloves fresh garlic minced (did not use onion)
2cups water
1/2 can (7oz) of italian flavored diced tomatoes (basil, garlic, and oregano)
2- 8oz cans tomato sauce
1/2 tsp seasoning salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp italian seasoning
2 cups instant white rice

Followed the recipe exactly as stated but with my ingredients...except I cooked the fresh garlic in olive oil and then browned the meat in the pan after the garlic was cooked.

This was good, but I found it to be a little bland.  The only change I made was to add some minced garlic.  I think I might try serving it with tomato sauce and shredded cheese on top.  It is good though, and I'll make it again - kicking it up a little.

This is a good base recipe but needs a lot of changes to be really tasty.  
1.  I used 1 cup of water and made the rice ahead of time.  If you make the rice before, 2 cups of water is way too much.
2.  Use 1 large can if diced tomatoes. 
3.  Use 2 green peppers.
4.  Brown the meat in garlic and the onion for more flavor.
5.  Add a small can of tomato sauce.
With all these changes, it was really good.

It was good but just wasn't like our stuffed peppers. I added a can of tomato soup and that is what was missing! Served it with shredded cheddar cheese at the table and it was fantastic! Hubs had 3 plate fulls!!

Awesome!  We had sauteed peppers and onions left from a fajita dinner.  Used them in this recipe and it turned out great.  Will definitely make this recipe many times in the future.

This was pretty darn good for a quick weeknight dinner. 4 stars because I think it could use a few tweaks, but definitely a good starter recipe. I added the onion and seasonings to the hamburger, plus some seasoned salt and 2 cloves garlic. Also sauteed the (chunked, not sliced, and doubled for dietary reasons) peppers in the pan before adding the water and tomatoes, and used fire-roasted tomatoes and instant brown rice (what I had on hand). Next time I'll use beef broth or another can of tomatoes instead of the water to add more flavor to the rice.   For those using brown instant rice, let stand for 10 minutes :)

This was absolutely delicious! My whole family raved about this. I made a few modifications based on reviews, and it was top notch. I sauteed 1 medium onion and 4 cloves of fresh garlic crushed, and then added the chopped meat to the pot and salted it. Drained the chopped meat, and put all the ingredients together to the crock pot. I added a half cup of extra tomato sauce because I love the extra saucy consistency. Cooked it on high for 4 hours. The rice was cooked perfectly (I used brown rice) and the peppers had just a slight crunch to them. Just how I like them! I topped each bowl with a generous serving of grated romano cheese. Thanks for the recipe! Will absolutely be making this again & again.

What a wonderful way to have all the flavors of stuffed peppers with so little work. My husband and sons couldn't get enough of this dish. I used brown rice and a little bit of red pepper flakes to set it off. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love this recipe!  I've made it twice but for some reason the last time I coudn't get the seasonings just right.  So, I went by my stuffed peppers recipe and added worcestershire sauce and velveeta.  Great recipe!

Was good but a bit bland. I will make a few variations next time, including more salt, a little bit more italian seasoning. Good base recipe just needs a bit of tweaking to make it incredible.

This was pretty good, I really liked the idea of the peppers being sliced up in it. I added a can of tomato paste and doubled the diced tomatoes, but it still was lacking in flavor a little. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was missing something. Overall it was pretty good though.

Great base recipe.  I made it exactly as provided but it could use additional tomatoes as well as extra italian seasoning.  Reheats well for lunch the next day and is easy to throw together without effort.

We loved this!  I did use seasoned diced tomatoes and already cooked brown rice but other than that followed the recipe.  Very flavorful and easy to make.

This was really good.  It seemed like it wasn't saucy enough, so I added a small can of V8 juice..perfect!  I also added just a sprinkle of crushed red pepper for some zing!  It's a keeper!

This recipe worked out great for me because I had most of the ingredients on hand. It didn't take very long to make either. I did make some minor adjustments and it came out well flavored. Instead of the water, I used 2 cups of beef broth. I also chopped up garlic and added that to the skillet while browning the beef. Also, I added some parmesan cheese once I re-added the cooked beef to the sauce/rice mixture. Thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again!

I thought this recipe was very good.  The only thing I did different was add a small can of tomato sauce and sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top at the end to make it more like an actual stuffed green pepper.  I do think this recipe might need a little bit more green pepper because it mostly tastes like hamburger and rice in a tomato sauce.  I will make this again though because it is a lot easier than stuffing the pepper.

This was great!  I added an extra yellow pepper and 2 small zucchinis, and used a can of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes.  Oh, and a squirt of ketchup.  My regular long grain brown rice needed quite a bit more water, and time :(, but it was worth the wait!

I used a bag of dozen diced onions and a bag of frozen diced onions and cooked them in with the beef. I also added 3/4 of a jar of tomato basil spaghetti sauce and a small can of tomato paste.  Turned out pretty good.

I made the rice separately, as some others did, because we only had regular rice instead of instant. I didn't want it to be crunchy.

While the rice was cooking, I made the rest in my wok. I didn't have canned diced tomatoes, so I used fresh tomatoes and added tomato paste. I only added water once I mixed the rice in, to make the tomato paste saucy enough to cover the rice. 

It ended up being really good! And still easy enough even if you do the rice separately.

One of the easiest, best-tasting quick recipes on this site. I don't trust canned tomatoes (acid interaction) but I do substitute an equal amount of pasta sauce (from a glass jar) thinned with water for the tomatoes and water called for. I like the extra zest that garlic adds to this dish. Also using lean ground turkey for ground beef makes the dish even healthier as well as quick/instant brown rice for more fiber. This is a family favorite!

This was an easy, quick dish that has a great flavor.  I left out the Italian Seasoning and left out about 1/3 pound of the ground meat ( I used turkey ).  I also used brown rice for added nutrition.  I will make this again!

Great recipe.  I cut the green pepper into chunks, diced the onion and cooked both with the ground beef.  Included a teaspoon of garlic powder with the seasonings.  Used only half amount of undrained diced tomatoes, added a can of tomato soup.  Decreased rice to half a cup and used long grain.  Decreased water to 1-1/2 cups.  After fully cooked, I sprinkled on a few handfuls of shredded cheddar and let melt.

We enjoyed this with peppers from our garden.  It's a very forgiving recipe - salsa works, pasta sauce works, canned tomatoes work...basically whatever you have on hand.  I used cooked brown rice, because that's what we eat.  Tasted great!

This is a great alternative to stuffed bell peppers. with the price of bell peppers it just isn't cost effective for my family to cook stuffed one because the kids won't eat the peppers.  With this everyone cleans their plates.

Just made this tonight for my husband and 4 kids under age 7.  I put the peppers and onions in a food processor for the kids, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The kids all ate it and 3 of the 4 really liked it.  The baby couldn't get enough!  My husband had seconds and we polished off the whole pan.  It's a tasty, quick and easy alternative to stuffed peppers.

This recipe was good. However, even after taking suggestions from others I still thought it was missing something. Next time I make it I am going to mix a can of tomato paste in with the can of tomatoes before adding it to the dish.

Yay! I found a recipe that is not near as much work with the same great taste! The only thing I changed was I added a can of tomato sauce with roasted garlic. Sprinkled some cheese on each serving. A family favorite.

I love this idea!   Like most cooks, I made a few changes;  I pre-cooked my instant rice then mixed it into the pre-cooked ground beef (with onion). I then added the rest of the ingredient list (including a small squash) into a deep skillet and simmered on low heat for about 30 minutes.  I did not use any salt and added about 2 tsp. of ground pepper.  You can add a few tbsp of water so that the mix CAN simmer if need be. It was a wonderful summertime dinner!

This is a great recipe for someone who's on a budget. The recipe can be doubled and used for lunch/leftovers the next day. I'm making it tonite with corn on the side. Tomorrow, we'll have the leftovers with a salad. Yum.

I would have given this 4.5 if I could. This was a great recipe. Written as is, it is a bit bland but perfect for those who need a bland diet still had flavor. I made this again and I doctored it up with some salt, garlic powder, pepper, and italian seasoning while browning the meat and then I used italian style tomatoes and it was great. Someone had mentioned tomato sauce which sounds interesting so I might try that next time but it is a great recipe and easy. Thanks for sharing

It was a good meal but I found it a little bland...I added tapatio to spice it up..I will make this recipe again, using some of the suggestions made by other users to encorporate more flavor.

Absolutely quick and easy!! I did end up adding a small can of tomato sauce as it seemed to need more tomato flavor.  Other than that I followed the recipe and husband and I both thought it was tasty.  Definitely will be making again!

Okay my kids wouldn't normally touch a traditionally made stuffed green pepper with a 10 foot pole.....but, they scarfed this recipe down & had 2nd servings!!  Go figure, since it basically has everything a traditional stuffed pepper has.   Well, it's my secret & I'm not telling them! :)  I found the end result fairly dry (maybe I added to much rice?) so I added a can of tomato sauce & that solved the problem.  Oh, and I accidently used the Rotel Diced Tomatoes instead of just diced tomatoes---it gave it a little kick.

Very tasty. My husband says this is one of the top 10 best tasting things I've ever cooked for him. I used italian flavored diced tomatoes instead of plain ones, and added a bit more black pepper. I also used regular rice instead of instant.

Easy to make and tastes great. I made brown rice separately and then ate it with the meat sauce on top of it. Used a vegetable broth cube and only 1 cup of water in the sauce. Will make again.

It is possible this review is worthless, nevertheless; This is a good (not bland) rice dish for a family meal. I even said I'd serve it to guests because it is SAFE. The spices are moderated enough for children and parents alike. If you love to eat spicy then you will need to add some Jalapenos to the green peppers as I did (4-6 slices of chopped pickled Jalapenos and a Tbls of dried garlic slices). Otherwise, I followed the basic premise of the recipe (not verbatim as stated, sorry) and the salt/pepper was fine for me but not for my husband - a salt freak. We enjoyed this and we both had a healthy serving then stopped leaving the "seconds" for a later lunch/dinner. Oh yes, I used buffalo and not beef due to my husbands request. He now calls this BUFFALO RICE.

I cooked off the water and used 3 cups of regular cooked rice instead of the instant. I also used salsa-style diced tomatoes that contained jalapeno peppers, which added a perfect "kick".  Delicious and easy!

This is fabulous!  I double the recipe, but use a 15 oz can of sauce plus 1 can tomatoes (instead of 2 cans of tomatoes).  Used 3 large peppers.  I also added 2 - 1" slices of velvetta, cubed, toward the end.  Leftovers freeze well and make for a great, quick dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly, except to sprinkle a little salt on the beef after it was browned, which I don't think really made a difference.  It was DELICIOUS!!

This was so simple to make, and the flavors were great! I added a can of tomato sauce at the end to make a little more sauce. I will definiately make this again and pass on the recipe.

This is an easy and wholesome recipe. I even cooked mine in the oven. However, it lacks flavor. Could use a small can of tomato sauce since we seasoned with ketchup.

This is great as written (I add cheddar cheese though), but it's also really flexible depending what you have in the fridge.  I made this dish with all my leftovers from taco night and it was great, too!  Taco meat, mexican rice and mexican cheese instead of the plain ground beef, italian seasoning, and white rice.

The way I made it totally changed the flavor so I can't really say it is the same recipe but I got the idea from this one.  Instead of plain rice I used two packets of mahatma saffron rice.  Since this is a unique flavor I omitted the Italian seasoning.  I also used 3 peppers instead of one, and I used red, yellow, orange because that's what I had.  I also put a little mozzarella cheese on top. I love this recipe because you get the same idea of stuffed peppers but it takes way less prep.  I will try the original recipe sometime when I have regular rice on hand.

This is really good but I'm use to my mom's stuffed peppers and she always makes them with a can of tomato soup. So next time I make this I'll add that just to make it a bit creamier. But this was very good and my husband liked it a lot too and he usually doesn't care for skillet or casserole type meals.

This was a nice twist on the sometime labor intensive stuffed peppers.  My family really liked it and it was quick and easy.  Great for a week night dinner when you need to get dinner on the table fast.  We will be making this again.  I do agree it needs a little something extra so I added some garlic and some Italian seasonings.

Pretty good. The only thing I did differently was to add a clove of minced garlic and some basil. The Italian seasoning seemed a bit too much. Overall, a quick and easy meal that tastes pretty good.

I'm not a stuffed pepper fan, but my grandmother used to make them and I was feeling nostalgic, so I decided to give this a go.  I added a little garlic, but that was my only change.  Five stars for making me like stuffed peppers!

This was a quick variation of the traditional stuffed peppers.  My family loved it.  I added some sausage along with the hamburger, which helped make the flavors pop.  Very good, and will use again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few tweaks, and thought this turned out really well. I used ground turke and italian style diced tomatoes. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and sprinkled cheese on top before eating. Delicious!

I thought this was very bland & watered-down.  I used the recipe as is.  After tasting, I added a lot of spices as well as a cube of beef boullion but nothing seemed to help.  I would like to try again, this time, try to improve on original recipe.

Awesome! I used ground venison and put the chopped onions in with the meat. I forgot to take the meat out and just put everything else in (except rice) and simmered for like 40 minutes. I also added an 8oz can of tomato sauce with the diced tomatoes. Very good this way! Topped with a little shredded cheddar. Will make this instead of stuffed peppers from now on.

This was really, really good. Better than I expected for something so simple. I doubled the bell pepper, added some chopped garlic, and used ground turkey instead of ground beef. It was also very quick and easy. We will add this to our dinner rotation.

Tastes a lot like stuffed peppers.  I increased the green peppers to 2, added a clove of garlic and a can of tomato sauce.  I think it would have been even better if it were baked for 15 - 20 minutes.

I love stuffed peppers, so this was an easy one pan alternative to stuffing and baking the peppers. Being Italian I added garlic to the recipe, of course, and a pinch of red pepper flake. I also added some baby bella mushrooms with the vegetables, and used brown rice, boil in bag, which I cooked seperately and added at the end, and only used 1/2 the water.  I sprinkled some fresh grated parm cheese over it at the very end. Delicious!!

This recipe was pretty good.  It was easy to make (since I'm not any good at stuffing things).  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef.  Next time I think I might add a little marinara or tomato paste.  I will agree that it did lack a little "sauce" that I love with stuffed green peppers.  We'll make it again, definitely!

This is pretty much the stuffed pepper recipe my mother used for years that I acquired from her but at the end I chop up some pieces of velvetta cheese (to your liking) and mix it in until it melts.  It's so good!  My mom originally got the stuffed pepper recipe with melted velvetta out of a Betty Crocker recipe years ago.  Try it, I bet you'd like it!!!

Aside from doubling the green pepper, I followed the recipe exactly.  My entire family loves it! My daughter claims that she doesn't like green peppers and I told her that she could eat around them, but she cleaned her plate, peppers and all.

This recipe was good and fairly simple to make.  I did do some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and added more seasoning.  My husband really loved it so it will be a recipe that I will make again.

Great, fast idea but didn't like the seasoning combo. I added some pepper and fresh garlic and next time will cut out some of the italian seasoning.

My husband rarely compliments the recipes I've tried, but raved and continued raving about this recipe.  I didn't have tomatoes so used tomato juice, and used pre-cooked brown rice instead of the minute rice, and it was wonderful.  This is definitely joining my "regulars" list.

My whole family thought this was really good! I did change a few things though. The first thing I did, instead of slicing the peppers and onions, I diced them. The second change I made was the rice. Instead of plain instant rice I used a box of spanish rice mix and simmered for about 20 minutes, adding more water as needed. It was great! I will definitely make it this way again!

This was just OK for me. I won't go out of my way to make it again. It is a good use of extra ground meat and rice and pantry items, makes alot, and is very filling.

I thought this was pretty good!  I had a taste for stuffed peppers but I didn't want to go through the work to get them so this seemed to be a good recipe to try.  I didn't have any instant rice, so I used another reviewers suggestion and added regular rice and simmered for 20 minutes.  I should have only used 1 cup of rice instead of the 1.5 cups because I was left with very little sauce, but it still tasted pretty good!  Also, next time I make this I won't use the amount of salt that is called for.  I reduced it to 1 tsp and it was still too much for me.

The last reviewer was very gracious, but I could not find enough seasoning to make this dish flavorful.  The components give one much to work with, but I recommend using this recipe as only a base.

I've made this a few times now and I've come to the conclusion that I like it best with red, yellow and orange peppers, instant brown rice, and tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes. Great weeknight dinner...quick, easy and good. :)
