This was delicious.  I was able to get frozen calamari rings and it was quicker to make because the calamari only cooked for 3 minutes.  I added some dried italian spices one time and fresh basil another.  Both times my family LOVED it.

Once you've tried Calamari w/garlic, herbs and tomato sauce, If you enhoy calamari, I can't imagine you wouldn't be hooked.  
I have ate fried calamari most of my adult life but never ate it any other way.  I had the fortunate opportunity to have calamari w/garlic, herbs and tomatoe sauce at Catch 35 in Chicago as an appetizer recently.  I don't think I will ever eat fried calamari again.  Excellent!

This is a good recipe, but it is much nicer when made with fresh tomatoes. Just blanch and peel the tomatoes and then slice, instead of using the paste. Before adding the squid, I took the sauce and ran it through a food processor to make it more sauce-like. Will use again (and already have!)

Excellent recipe, fresh tomatoes definitely adds flavour, try to make tiny cubes if you want more texture. I also grilled a red capsicum in the oven and added it to the sauce(until the skin is black, put it in a sealed container in the fridge and skin when cool). Top it with fresh thyme. If you don't have red wine Balsamico vinegar can do the job. I found that 5 minutes for the squid was enough.

This was pretty good. The only thing I changed was adjusting the serving size to the amount of calamari I had and I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste.

I made this minus the pasta.  Simple and delicious.  I ended up putting  a table spoon of crème fraîche as well, and my family liked it!
