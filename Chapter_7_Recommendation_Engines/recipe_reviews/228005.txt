I thought this tasted alright, but found the recipe to be quite quirky. Who makes coffee today, by this cold brewed method? What is the point when a pot or cup of coffee can be made and refridgerated. To top, it would not have to be hand strained. I may have tried something like that in college, before I had a coffee pot. Maybe, a little more explanation on this would have been helpful. It would be rather time consuming to make the coffee ice cubes and then the cold brewed coffee separately. I have a very favorite iced coffee from the site that specifies the amount of milk amount too, and it comes out perfect. I had some tiramisu flavored coffee I made into ice cubes and decided to try it with this. I used less sweetener than suggested, but iced coffee really needs milk or cream in it. I can't see how that is an optional ingredient. It just tastes like coffee with ice cubes without it. Any iced coffee made at home still beats paying for it at a coffee shop. Try flavored coffee, it worked pretty well in it anyway.

In response to the most popular review. . .there's one very good reason to cold brew coffee. Cold brewing doesn't extract acidic, bitter compounds that are extracted by traditional brewing. Yes, it's more effort, but there is a significant difference in the results. Give it a try!

Good recipe, tastes much better with sugar. Also, 'Sweet and Low' is extremely dangerous.

This is one of my favorite summer drinks to make. I like to make a big container of cold brewed coffee (Pioneer Woman's recipe is my go-to recipe) and keep it in the fridge for recipes like this. I like to use Splenda sweetener but sometimes, I'll use Starbucks' sugar free coffee syrups. When I make my iced coffee, I like to put my coffee ingredients in a Ball jar, slap on a lid and shake until the ingredients are well mixed. Then, all I have to do is grab a straw and drink right out of the jar.

Coffee made using the cold brew method is delicious! Cold brewed coffee is much smoother than hot brewed coffee.  It reduces the acidity and makes it much less bitter tasting. This recipe makes enough for two to three cups of iced coffee, depending on how much milk you like to add.  I make this exact recipe every other day or so.  I like to add unsweetened vanilla almond milk.  I normally use regular ice cubes, but if I make a pot of regular hot brew coffee, I will freeze the leftovers rather than pour it down the drain.

I love this recipe! The coffee ice cubes are what really make it great, I think. I've been using medium roast hazelnut coffee, pouring water on it and letting it sit overnight in a teapot while the ice cubes freeze. In the morning I throw the ice and some sugar in a cup, pour the cold brewed coffee straight into the cup using some cheesecloth over the top for a filter, then add a good amount of whole milk and it is just perfect.

Came out very smooth and yummy.  Cold brewing makes a much better ice coffee than simply refrigerating coffee brewed in a machine. I used real sugar, or agave.  Most sugar substitutes are not healthy in the long run.

This turned out really good, I used Splenda instead of sweet N low, and 2% milk! and it was perfect... I used instant coffee to make my ice cubes, and cold brewed some hazelnut flavoured grounds... Yum!  I can see myself making these all summer.  :)

I liked the flavor! I also liked the idea of freezing coffee for ice cubes, so one doesn't water the coffee down with ice water cubes. :-}

Delicious cold brew coffee! Plus the addition of coffee ice cubes is genius. No watering down of the coffee until it can all be drunk. Great way to start my day. The only draw back is that this recipe takes planning ahead.

I'm not a big Sweet'N Low fan, and one packet is plenty for me. I loved the coffee ice cubes in the drink. No more watered down iced coffee. I used real cream instead of milk.
