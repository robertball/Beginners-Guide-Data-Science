Really yummy, unusual stuffing!  My whole family loved it.  The only change I made was to add the potatoes during the LAST 45 min. or so with a little water around the chicken.

Definitely not worth the effort. Would have been better off simply roasting a chicken and cooking potatoes/stuffing separately. Really looked forward to having this for dinner, but my whole family was disappointed...let's go to Cici's...

When you read this recipe you wonder how it could possibly be any good. And then you taste it. Wow! Unusual stuffing is moist and flavorful, potatoes are delicious, and the chicken makes a great comliment to finish off the meal. When I told my husband we needed ricotta for stuffing he thought I was nuts. He doesn't think that any more.

I really loved this stuffing; very unusual and unexpectedly delicious.  I was very uncertain how it would turn out but was pleasantly surprised.  I think I will make the stuffing alone as a side, as it stood out to me more than the chicken.

Delicious. The chicken is moist, the stuffing savoury and the potatoes flavourful. I used a large 4lb chicken and so had to bake it for 4 hours instead of just 2. Also, I rubbed the chicken in butter and made a braggs and brown sugar mix as the browning/basting juice. Everybody in my fam loves it! I'm still licking my fingers as I type on the greasy keyboard.

Great gluten free stuffing. I didn't make the potatoes though. The chicken remained moist and juicy inside and crispy outside. The stuffing was delicious and was a treat on its own. Definitely worth the extra work that goes into it. I added some onion around the chicken. Thank you Kat for sharing your recipe.
