I didn't find this very good at all. If I make this again, I will definitely want to warm it up first. My husband, a.k.a. the garbage disposal, was the only one that finished his, but didn't goes for seconds. The kids didn't like them and I don't blame them.
Warm it up if you're going to try this.

I frequently make this for my co workers, they love it! Takes some time to prepare, but easy to do. Great to make ahead of time for those short lunch breaks!
