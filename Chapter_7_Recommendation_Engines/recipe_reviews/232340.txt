It tastes great and is easy to make. I think I would prefer it with puff pastry next time.

Not a big fan of this one.  Think it needs to be cooked a little longer...hard to tell if bottom and top are cooked properly.  Does not store well.  Suggest eating right away.

We loved the recipe. It was so easy to make but my one complaint is that when  I put the leftovers in the fridge, the next day the top crust was so soft, just like raw dough.it waligbrowned when it came out of the oven.
