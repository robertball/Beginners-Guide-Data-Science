I haven't cooled this yet to try it (I just finished making it) but it tastes good so far. It's really sweet though and next time I make it I'll try to substitute something for all the sugar. I also used cheerios and it worked out well - I was trying to use up my cereal and peanut butter so this recipe was perfect. Let's see how my husband likes it!
