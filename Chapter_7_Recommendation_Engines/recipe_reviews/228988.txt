Well, I made as is with the exception of the spinach (forgot to get it). I hesitated with the salt, seemed like a lot, but decided to just go for it....WRONG. It was actually pretty good and easy to make, but WAYYYY TOO MUCH SALT. Smelled great while cooking, very easy to make, but did I mention that there was too much salt?

Love this recipe.  If you have picky eaters with vegetables, try processing them in a blender or food processor.  This makes a thicker sauce and hides the vegies.  My picky grandaughter loves this and she "Hates tomatoes and spinach". Since I don't cook with salt, I used 1 tsp garlic powder, onion powder and a small pinch of cumin and Italian seasoning and put in the food processor with the tomatoes and spinach.  If you don't cook the ravioli you can put in frozen and just add 1/4 to 1/2 cup water to the sauce.  Comes out of the oven really yummy

This was a big hit. I used ground chicken and got a bag of tex mex instead of getting both mozzarella and cheddar. I think I just added all of my ingredients (all of the chicken, all of the ravioli and all of the cheese... just eyeball it. you can't really mess it up). I made this for four people and ended up with enough for seconds and leftovers.

Made this last night and thought it was delish! I had read previous reviews so I didn't add salt and substituted italian sausage for ground beef. Hubby loved it-will make again!

This was a quick and easy weeknight dinner. It's not something I would serve to company, but it's definitely good comfort food when you're short on time and ingredients.

Just too darn salty! I as hopeful, since I had all the ingredients on hand and wanted to finish off what was left of a large bag of cheese ravioli. I even reduced the salt by 1/4 tsp. But obviously that wasn't reduced nearly enough. Otherwise, the recipe is just OK. The sauce is very thin. It smelled great while cooking, but was disappointing in the end.

I thought this was very good.  I did have to make some modifications because I was so excited to try it, but am really trying to clean out the freezer/pantry.  So I used Italian sausage and butternut squash ravioli.  Good combo, I omitted the salt because the sausage has enough I think.  I like the lightness of the sauce, but I might puree it next time as I didn't like the tomato chunks (personal preference I know!).

Love this dish!! I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger and I didn't add any salt at all, and I didn't use any Cheddar cheese, I just used Mozzarella and Parmesan. Other than that, I followed the recipe and I will make again.

Substituted ground turkey for ground beef, tortellini with Ravioli, and forgot the Parmesan cheese, but everything was fine, save for one problem - the recipe only provided enough sauce for basically one and a half layers. I'd recommend doubling the amount of diced tomatoes, and possibly cooking them in a saucepan instead of a skillet.

I made this recipe and my boyfriend could not believe how good it tasted.  I did change a few things, I used 1 lb ground beef, 2 cups Italian cheese and half jar of marinara.  I layered dish with marinara then 1/3 of ground beef, 1/3 of spinach, 1/3 ravioli then shredded cheese, layered it two additional times then sprinkled crushed red pepper on top of final layer of cheese.....it was awesome!! Plus I used cheese ravioli.  It was a quick and easy dinner that tasted awesome.  Thanks for recipe.

Delicious! I skipped the ground beef to make it a vegetarian meal and left out the extra teaspoon of salt. I thought the dish was easy to prepare and very tasty! I will definitely make this again.

I just made this and just sprinkled some salt over the meat. It turned out pretty yummy.  A nice change of pace from ravioli and a thick red  sauce.

I made this a week ago and my husband couldn't get enough. I pretty much stuck to the recipe except I used Ground turkey and my own special seasoning instead if salt. It came out GREAT! I will definitely be making this again in the future. Thanks Alicia716 for sharing this tasty recipe.

This was a great recipe and my wife (who is a picky eater) absolutely raved about it.  We did not have any spinach so I doubled the amount of ground beef.  I also used fresh, spinach stuffed ravioli rather than frozen ravioli.  This turned out to be a delicious, lasagna type dish.  will definitely make this again!!!

So we are on a combination of a pescatarian/ vegetarian diet. Instead of using ground beef I substituted it for beyond beef crumbles. And added diced onions and green bell peppers to the beef and tomato mixture. I doubled the seasonings and added chopped garlic as well. Sautéed it all together in olive oil before letting it simmer. It turned out AMAZING! We will definitely be adding this to our monthly dinner list.

This baked ravioli was great. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I used frozen spinach. Not only did it taste great, but it looked very pretty with the red tomato pieces and green spinach peeking out from the cheese. My husband and I both loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this last week, after having made a crockpot version, and liked this so much better.  I didn't have the spinich on hand, so I left it out and I just noticed that the recipe calls for 1/4 pound of ground beef and I think I used a whole pound! (but it was very good).  I have a question....do you think it could be made ahead and refrigerated overnight before cooking?  I don't see why not, just wanted to ask another opinion. Thanks

I really liked this dish.  I threw in a little tomato sauce as well because I was using Turkey.  But overall, I would say this is a good standard recipe and relatively easy to make.  I would recommend it.

I found this meal very heavy and tasteless.  I managed to finish most of it by getting some good quality jarred marinara to serve with it.  I won't be making this again.

Very good and flexible recipe. Used refrigerated fresh ravioli and did not cook it before assembling. Has queso fresco on hand and used that for the cheese. It was extremely easy and even my picky grandson liked it

I have made this about 7 times now, and the entire family devours it each time! This is so incredibly flavourful and easy. It's not a very saucy ravioli, but that is what we love about it. It's very light and fresh. I usually make it with ground turkey and just a pinch of salt (1 tsp is probably a little much, but adjust to suit your personal taste) and I used a baby spinach and kale blend once. I always double the recipe because the leftovers make a perfect lunch the next day. One of my favourite weeknight dinners ever!

This was super yummy and a great way to spruce up some ravioli.  I did increase the beef to 1/2 a pound and am glad I did.  Also, this was a bit too salty for my tastes, so next time I will bump it down to 1/2 tsp of salt.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used frozen cheese ravioli and added water to the sauce as advised by another reviewer. You will have to increase the baking time if you use frozen ravioli. The fresh spinach disappears in the layers of cheese, sauce, and pasta. This recipe is a keeper. Yummy!

Was planning to do cheese ravioli in a mushroom sauce but fancied something with a bit more to chew on so I did half of that and half of this.  Ground beef, threw in some mushrooms, garlic, a PINCH of salt and the remnants of a pot of bolognese sauce that I had left over.  3-cheese ravioli plus mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Didn't have Parmesan so I left that out which was fine as I don't particularly like it much.  Very nice meal, easy and quick to prepare.

This was a hit at my house.  I did a few things differently.  First, I added chopped onion to the browning meat  and garlic and omitted the salt.  Then I added a Large can of chopped tomato.  I used ravioli from the deli section of market and skipped the boiling of the ravioli.  Just make sure the meat sauce is a little runny.  For the cheese, I added a mixture of Mozzarella, Asiago and Parmesan.  Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper.

This Baked Ravioli was easy to put together, and proved very adaptable for individual need or tastes.I replaced the beef with Medium Spicy Italian Sausage, had to omit the Italian seasoning, as I forgot to buy it. I had a ton of garden fresh tomatoes, and used these in place of the canned. My pastor's family loved it, and a couple who stopped by to visit inhaled some as well. This is by far one of the best group dinners I have had the pleasure to make.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. Since I read someone's comment about the saltiness of the recipe here is my tip for all recipes except for cakes or cookies: I adjust and balance the salt amount considering the other ingredients that also contain salt and thus may make the recipe saltier than my taste. Furthermore, do not forget to adjust the salt content while cooking but keep in mind that you will be adding more salt to the recipe with the other ingredients included in the recipe especially if the other ingredients include cheese.

Easy and hearty dish - great for families in need (moving, with new baby, death in the family etc. The ground beef is so flavorful it tastes like sausage. Love the spinach!!

Quite tasty and very easy to make. I doubled it for leftovers. The reason for 4 stars not 5 is because it was a bit dry. Now, I did make the mistake of baking uncovered. Didn't realize the error until it was done, so not sure if that caused the tomato sauce mixture to dry up. But, next time will add a layer of tomato sauce outside what the recipe calls for. Definitely a keeper.

We really liked this...my hubby called it "delicious" :)
That being said, I made some changes.  For the tomato/beef sauce, I used a pound of ground beef and 2 cans of tomatoes...adjusted the seasoning accordingly for this...making more allowed for a layer of the sauce, not just a sprinkling.  delish.
