Loved this!  My husband is not a fan of cauliflower and I am always looking for new recipes to try.  The horseradish makes this dish and completely won over my husband.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic. Didn't have gruyere, so I used sharp cheddar. Not a speck left! It was just delicious.

As noted in noted options, I used onion vs shallots and half & half vs heavy cream and it was absolutely delicious. My husband and I loved it. The horseradish added good flavor without overwhelming.

Made this for Christmas. It’s a lot of work for a side especially on a holiday. Even grated my own cheese. Did not feel that it was really worth it. Wish there were instructions if it could be made ahead. I didn’t want to take a chance with company coming.

Was delicious. made to go with grilled chicken. Recipe was great as written, the horseradish gave a kick.  When I make it again, i may add some cayenne, but we are spicy eaters. THank you Lori for the recipe!

This was amazing.  Used Cheddar this time but can't wait to try it with the Gruyere cheese.  Everyone loved it.
