Great recipe! I used about half the amount of brown sugar, and I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the butter. I also melted the butter and stirred it in rather than cutting it in. Mine turn out like bars as long as I let them cool completely before cutting.

I used about half of the butter and added cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  A big hit!

Delicious! I'm just an amature cook... and so I almost made the mistake of pressing down on the crumbs for the bottom... ! luckily a keen observer stopped me, and I left the bottom all crumbly. Very easy and delicious bar! =P

GREAT RECIPE!! WHAT I DID WITH IT HOWEVER WAS INSTEAD OF PUTTING APPLES, I PUT STRAWBERRY JAM AND CUT DOWN THE SUGAR.  THEN I PUT HALF WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR AND THEN THE OTHER HALF WHITE.  IT IS EXCELLENT.  MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN TAKING THIS TO WORK EVERY DAY!! I MAKE IT ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND HE EATS IT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

This was really crummy (pun intended). The "bars" did not stick together and the recipe was not even tasty enough to pass for a crisp. A huge waste of time/ingredients.

With a 1/4 reduction in the amount of butter, this still turned out moist and delicious! The dessert was more crumbly than like a bar. It can't be picked up and eaten with hands, but it's still really good. The slight tanginess from the apples and the sugary texture of it is yummy!

This recipe was incredible!  It reminded me of the apple crisp they served in elementary school.  This is a delicious Fall treat that is even more so with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Thank you for sharing this one!

These bars are delicious. I used only 2/3 of a cup of butter and mixed it with my hands. It worked really well. I ate these bars for dessert and also with my coffee in the morning. Will definetly make these agian.

Not Impressed.
Not quite bars, not quite "Apple Crisp" as your husband calls it, not quite an "apple crumble" due to the size + construction.
The flavor was bland, and certainly there are better tasting apple-oatmeal-bake-type recipes out there.  Certainly there are others using less than an entire 2 STICKS (1 cup) of butter!!  My arteries are hardening as we speak.

Meh.    Wasn't horrible but it really needs some spices, I would suggest cinnamon at least, maybe some nutmeg and cloves too.  Mine was kind of salty, oddly.  Probably because I'm out of unsalted butter and wow, there's a lot of butter in it.  Definitely does not hold together in any way I would define as "bar-like".  Maybe I had dry apples?  I don't know.  I think I will stick with the old Betty Crocker version of Apple Crisp, and just put it in bar form.

It was alright, nothing to write home about or anything.  I tried because I needed to get rid of some apples.  I don't think I would make this again.

Great recipe -- using it often.  I cut up 5 or 6 apples rather than measuring.  It works out!

I have been using this recipe since 2003.  As I got the stained, dog-eared printed version out to make today, I decided I would chime in!  This is fabulous- perhaps too crumbly to be considered bars- but it is rich and nummy, and versitile( I have been known to throw in blackberries, blueberries or whatever is in season with the apples)!  Cut down the butter a bit if you want, and have fun!

This recipe was very good... not quite my favorite, but still yummy.  I added cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg, because my opinion is that any recipe like this MUST have cinnamon!  Probably won't make again, but we still enjoyed it quite a bit!

"My family loved this recipe!
So easy to make, I could't
believe that it would turn out
to be a bar, but it sure did.
I added tsp. of cinnamon and
1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the crumb
recipe, since we like cinnamon.
Also a little more apples."

I always use canned apple (Comstock Apple Pie Filling)for this recipe.It provides just the right amount of moisture to hold the bar together. I think if you use fresh apple slices,applesauce should be added to the layer of sliced apples to provide the needed moisture.A teaspoon to a tablespoon of Cinnamon or apple pie spice is definitely recommended to round out the flavor.This is a family and guest favorite especially with ice cream or yogurt.

Not very impressed. Added cinnamon and nutmeg and was still on the bland side. Not very bar-like. Ended up throwing out half the pan. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the too predominant taste of salt and soda. There was something just a little bit off in the flavor.

This looked really good and I had apples that needed to get used up but after the apples were cut I discovered that I didn't have any oatmeal.  So I used packages of instant oatmeal with apples and cinnamon (3 = 1 cup).  I also added 1/4 c. of flax seed to the dry ingredients.  I cut down the brown sugar to 1/4 c. of splenda brown sugar.  I added 2 4oz. natural applesauce to the apples to help with the problem of not using baking apples.  And instead of the 4 tablespoons of butter I used another 4 oz apple sauce.  They turned wonderful.  Not overly sweet and didn't fall apart!
