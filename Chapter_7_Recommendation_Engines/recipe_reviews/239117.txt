The butter tarts were really good.  I used brown sugar Splenda Mix, instead of regular brown sugar, so I didn't find it too sweet, as dd the previous reviewer (matter of taste, too.)  The pastry was simple and easy to make and roll, plus turned out nice and flaky.  I would have like the filling to be a bit thinner and runnier (Gooey-er) but that is a minor thing.  Overall, great recipe!

I would say more of 4 to 4.5 star recipe. 
I choose this recipe for the first Canadian Allrecipes Allstar challenge because I had all the ingredients and liked the fact the recipe did not contain corn syrup. 
I halved the recipe, which yielded 30 3 inch tarts. 
I used premade tarts shells because I needed to transport them and I find them easier.
The tarts smelled awesome while baking, just like what you imagine they should smell like. 
The only complaint and it is a minor one, is my husband found them a little too sweet compared to my usual recipe, but he also said he could easily eat 10 because they are butter tarts after all!
One recommendation I have would be to streamline the ingredients a little bit e.g. 10 tbsps milk is 2/3 cup 1 2/3 tbsps of vanilla is 5 tsps, it just felt a little awkward.
