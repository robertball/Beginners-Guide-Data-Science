I used to make cinnamon rolls and stick buns professionally.  Here is how we rolled tight buns.  Make sure you roll your dough out to 1/4".  Apply butter evenly, then sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Holding the rolling pin, gently roll over the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  At the beginning of the roll only 1/2" of dough and pinch down.  Now you must begin rolling from each corner, middle, working your way back and forth.  Curve your corners toward the center to avoid too much overlap (exess)  IMPT:  after about 2-3 rolls, carefully lift up each portion and pull away from you, this will "tuck" in the dough, be careful not to tear the dough.

A lot to remember, but after you get the hang of it, it's like second nature and you will have picture perfect cinnamon rolls and sticky buns

This is a good cinnamon roll recipe.  Here's a trick for cutting the rolls without mashing the dough:  take a piece of thread, slide it under the roll, cross the thread and pull quickly.  It works like magic, and you don't have a sticky knife to clean up afterwards!

These cinnamon buns are THE BEST EVER!!! I loved them so much, just a tip: the longer you let them rise, the fluffier and better they taste!!

Mine weren't so ooey-gooey.  I made per the recipe---except I didn't add the pecans to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture that went inside the rolls.  I would suggest not melting the butter that you spread on the inside before you roll it up.  If you just spread on a thin layer of softened butter you should end up with a more ooey-gooey feel because you'll have more butter on the inside to melt, which will make the caramel more gooey.  When you use the melted butter you don't get a lot of butter on the inside & I found this tended to give me a dryer--but still good--caramel roll.  I will try again, but next time I won't melt my butter.
Have made a couple more times & it definitely works better not to melt the butter for the inside and then I double the caramel for the bottom.  Still a good recipe, hence the 4 stars, but does need some adjustments.

I am a lucky baker, meaning I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time, but it usually works out pretty well in the end. When I made these for a dinner party I was having - I was a little worried - but they turned out well. Too well. The buns were so unbelievably and incredibly delicious I kind of got scared. I felt like I had created something so devastating, so powerful, that it would wreak havoc on humanity. I knew what it was like to be Oppenheimer, surveying the results of his work. So PLEASE be careful when and where you make these - they are beyond humanity's control; this cinnamon bun WILL NOT BE DENIED AND WILL HAVE ITS WAY WITH YOU! Consider yourself warned.

The best!!  I come from a long line of bakers.. this is great!  I used half whole wheat flour...incredible.  To easily cut the dough, use dental floss.  Slide it under the end, cross the dental floss at the top and pull.  Perfect cuts every time!  If you want more ooey-gooey, just add a little cream or whole milk (3-4 tablespoons) to the butter, brown sugar mixture in the pan.

I came to this recipe this morning and made these wonderful sticky buns. I changed only these two areas: I used a 9 X 9 baking pan and I made a little extra filling. In addition I made some simple white icing and I have to say this is one of the best sticky buns I have ever had; and I've had quite a lot over the years. I never thought I'd make a world class sticky bun but I was wrong. 

I would highly suggest taking extra time and being extra careful when reading the directions. In addition, I allowed my first rise to go for approx. 2 hours and it came out perfect. 

If you want great sticky buns that will knock the socks off your friends and family, this is it! Happy Holidays from Maggie's kitchen.

Great Recipe! For those of you who are novice bakers like myself, I'll share a few things I learned after a lot of trial and error and more reading. First, this recipe should be read closely as there are a lot of steps and can be confusing. Kneading was the difficult part for me. You must knead at least the recommended time if doing it by hand (8min for this recipe). In the past I didn't knead enough and my bread didn't come out fluffy, I couldn't figure out what went wrong because the dough would rise nicely. Kneading is key!! Add a little flour if it gets too sticky to work with/ lightly dust. The dough should feel harder the more you knead and you'll know its ready when you pinch it between your fingers and it feels like your earlobe. If in doubt, knead some more. It is difficult to over knead by hand. Also, when making the caramel you may want to do extra. I made double but make sure the sugar has completely dissolved so that it turns into caramel. I think it should be cooked at medium-high heat but watch carefully so it doesn't burn. Lastly, I cooked at 375 for 25min (min time recommended) and I was disappointed that after all the work they were over cooked on the top. I don't know if the temp was too high or time was too long, just make a note and watch carefully. No one mentioned this in other reviews so maybe it was just my oven. Next time I will try 350 degrees...My first review on here so hope it was helpful :) Good Luck!!

This buns are yummy! They taste like the Cinna-Buns.  They are one of those treats you do only a couple of times a year because they are not the healthiest thing but flavor-wise they are awesome.  We did not add the pecans because my kids do not like the nuts but they were great.  Present Idea: Prepare batches and put them in disposable aluminium containers - you can give them away and put the baking instructions and a DO NOT BAKE UNTIL CHRISTMAS MORNING Sign.  They will love it and remember you on Christmas morning when the cinnamon smell comes out of the oven! Thanks for the recipe.

These were spectacular! I ate them warm out of the oven so hopefully they are good warmed up.  I would suggest a little more caramel on the top, there was only "just enough." To get more sauce, instead of mixing 3/4 butter with 3/4 brown sugar, you can mix 1 1/4 cup of butter with 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

We loved this breakfast treat! It IS time consuming (I had to start these by 8am so that they'd be done for our brunch at around 11am) but they were very good! We only had to bake for 18-20 minutes (as another reviewer stated) and they didn't "dry out" for us. I noticed other complaints that they tasted stale when cooled...but we didn't have that problem since we don't like cooled caramel rolls anyways. The few that were leftover were reheated a few hours later this afternoon in the microwave for a few seconds and tasted as good as the original batch out of the oven! I'll be sure not to lose this recipe! Thanks Jen!

To anyone with a little bit of baking experience, this is a standard yeast dough, and is well worth the work involved in making a lovely dough.  Great caramel too, although I recommend doubling it.  Ignore the reviewer below who only gave it four stars because it was too time-consuming for her. That's just ignorant. There is an art to making pastries.  If it's too much work, go buy a can of Grands cinnamon rolls.

This is the only time I've ever set my oven on fire. The sugar-butter mixture rises and overflows a shallow pan, and it's pretty combustible in the oven!!! They sure looked tasty, but I didn't eat them with their fire-extinguisher powder coating.

okay, seriously better then the cinnabon ones!!!!  Takes a little time to prepare but oh so worth it!!!!!  I tweaked this just a touch...I used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar for the bottom and omitted the nuts. This made a really creamy topping and did not dry out. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon in the last addition of the flour, which gave the dough an extra little kick.  I made the dough the night before and baked in the morning...The smell in the kitchen was heavenly enough to awake 2 sleeping 13 year old boys at 8am on a Sunday morning!!!!  Topped this with a cream cheese icing and OMG, they were AWESOME!!!!!Try this one, you won't be disappointed....

This is a fabulous recipe. No major changes are necessary and it's super easy to make. Definitely a holiday stale from here on out. 
Here are a few notes I wanted to share:
Pressed for time in the morning?  Make the dough the night before and refrigerate overnight in an oiled and covered bowl. It will rise slowly throughout the night. Just make sure you pull out the dough a few hours before you make these so it has time to get to room temperature. 
The step for spreading the melted butter and cinn sugar on the rolled out dough: I used room temp butter instead of pouring a liquid butter on the dough.  Much easier (spread w a spatula). 
We went loco with the cinnamon, using much more then it called for. You can't go wrong with too much cinn (we ended up using about 1/4 and it was soooo fantastic). I would reccomended it!
If you can get two people (4hands) to roll it up you will get a great roll. Make sure to roll out the dough evenly. I didn't and though they were still great there were some rolls that were smaller from the ends and the middle ones were fit for a king!
Don't be afraid to increase the butter and sugar and nuts that go on the bottom f the pan. The more "ooey-gooeyness" the better!
Just some helpful tips. Enjoy!

This is my second time making these.  (I often use the Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls on this site, because I never seem to plan far enough ahead.)  That being said, I really planned ahead this time and made the rolls the night before, placing the pan in the fridge overnight still covered with the damp cloth from the first rise.  Perfect!  Take them out about 35 minutes before you plan to bake and let them come to room temperature.  Bake as directed.  Gooey and delicious and the long, slow rise makes them very light.

I have never had such delicious homemade cinnamon buns- I make the dough on a friday night, roll it up and keep it in the fridge so I can just slice them, let them rise a bit and bake them for fresh cinnamon buns on the weekend mornings!

These are delicious.  They are time-consuming, but easy to prepare.  The crumb of the dough is right on.  However, I have one CAUTION: If you do use a 9X13 inch pan, make sure it is at least a couple of inches deep.  Otherwise, all that delicious buttery caramel will be burned to the bottom of your oven, creating awesome amounts of blue smoke and a gross cleaning situation.

I had a cassorole dish that fit most of the buns, so I put the rest in metal pans. The ones in the metal burned, and the ones in the glass came out perfect.... hmmm. I've heard that metal gets hotter quicker, and 375 is just too hot. 350 for metal would have been better. Overly caramelized.

This was fabulous!  VERY good.  I've even made the dough over night, stored in the fridge, and finished up in the morning, to kind of cut down on time.  The only suggestion I would make would be brush the dough with melted butter before putting in the oven, and again about 10 minutes into it.  This keeps it moist, and prevents the "hard dough" thing from happening.  I do make this once a week for Sunday breakfasts before church- and have made for bake sales.

Amazing! Skeptical at first because it seemed very complicated, too many steps, too many ingredients repeat, etc. But my husband and I made it together and it turned out to be fantastic! We loved it, he was amazed! Thank you for sharing these great recipes!

These are delicious! I've never made any sort of rolls before or anything with yeast, so I did my research before finally deciding on this one based on many rave reviews, and I found the video quite helpful. These didn't take as long in my oven, I checked on them after only 20 minutes and they were done. After reading a few reviewers suggestions, I spread room temperature butter on the dough rather than melted, which I think is why they came out so gooey. I omitted the pecans as I didn't have any on hand, and being the unorganized baker I am, forgot to add the salt entirely. Even so, my family loved them and said they were absolutely delicious! Will definitely be making these again and again!

You need to make sure to cook the caramel (brown sugar and butter) all the way to carmelization prior to putting it in the pan otherwise it turns out a little crystalized.

I love this recipe, I use it all the time and it never gets old.  Just make sure to have plenty of Brown sugar, don't scamp otherwise it can get a little dry.

FANTASTIC. Used slightly crushed slivered almonds instead of pecans as that was what I had on hand. Doubled the amount of cinnamon. Baked for only 17 minutes. I would suggest setting the timer for 15 min and check after that. If buns are browning too much but are not cooked through they might need to be covered in foil to stop the browning for the rest of baking.

These are better than any store bought version you will ever find. I use a pan that is larger because the 9x13 tends to "squish" the buns. If you're going to eat a cinnamon bun it might as well be a big one. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I love this recipe and shared it with my coworkers after they sampled them. My only suggestion is more cinnamon and sugar in the middle of the rolls. My kids are real cinnamon fans and absolutely LOVE them. My 2nd oldest son says they are alot of work but they are WORTH it!

I have been using this recipe for four years. At first the results were disappointing but after some trial and error, I came to the following conclusions:

1.) Roll those buns tight! Practice makes perfect. Consult youtube to get a sense of proper rolling technique.

2.) Double the caramel, and add a pinch of salt, a splash of milk and some sort of liqueur. I've even used Malibu and the results were insanely delicious. The sugar melts effortlessly-- no graininess.

3.) Allow plenty of time for the first and second rise, especially the second. The fluffier they are right before they bake, the better. Use a brownie pan so the buns are packed tightly together and have space to rise UPWARD, not outward.

4.) Tent your pan with foil so the buns cook evenly and don't brown too much on top. Every oven is different so be careful with temperature and cooking time-- took me several batches to figure my own oven out.

Happy baking, AllRecipes community :)

I made these cinnamon buns this morning for my wife and kids for Mothers Day.  I used the bread machine to work the dough as I don't have a mixer.  This was a great time saver as I was also making eggs benedict.  The rolls were very easy to make, and everyone loved them.  I gave some to my neighbors and they loved them too.

I LOVE cinnamon buns and have tried numerous recipes, in an attempt, to duplicate the buns my grandmother made when I was a chid. She was a fantastic cook/baker but, unfortunately, did not leave recipes for several of her wonderful treats. I must admit these delicious buns are very close. I followed the recipe exactly as printed except I only required 3 1/2 cups of flour, total, to achieved a perfectly silky smooth elastic dough. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and let the buns rise about 2 hrs initially  and 1 1/2 hrs the second rise. This produced a wonderfully flaky bun which is delicious with or without the caramel pecan topping. My husband and grandchildren said these are the best I have baked thus far. I encourage anyone considering cinnamon buns to try this recipe....you will not regret it.

I also made a few changes at the advice of others. More gooey filling in the bottom and a little more sugar and cinnamon in the middle. Be careful not to add too much. I got complaints on one batch about being too sweet. 

I made these for my church function and they disappeared faster than anything else. I've made them many times and will continue to make them.

I followed one users advice and placed the unbaked rolls in the fridge over night and then baked them in the morning. They turned out great. Planning on having these Christmas morning for breakfast. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

Awesome!  This was my first time using dry active yeast and I think it went well. I left a half cup of floor out of the mixer and kneeded it into the dough, as to not make the dough too chewy and tough. Thanks

These are excellent when they are warm.  Once they cool down they get stale quickly (this is why I rated them only 4-stars). Warm the leftovers in the microwave oven and they taste great.

This is my all time weakness. Nothing says perfection better than a fresh sticky bun right out of the oven. My own sticky bun standby recipe is to use King Arthur Flour's Sticky Buns recipe and that's as close to heaven as it gets. Yet I will never let a chance to make Sticky Buns pass me by so I made this recipe exactly according to the directions. It's good but the lack of potato flakes is evident in the texture. While the milk in this recipe helps soften the dough the classic flaky, light as air sticky bun texture takes adding instant potato flakes. I'd give these five stars if I didn't have another 5 star recipe to use in comparison.

I have never made cinnamon buns before and I tried this recipe and they turned out great.  My house is generally a little cold so when I was waiting for them to rise I put them in the oven and turned it to 100F for a few minutes.  They rose beautifully and tasted fantastic.

these are better than the clone of a cinnabon - they're softer and squishier. They don't become rock hard after a day after baking. I love these and have gotten requests for the recipe. That to me says it all. I loved these and so did my family. I don't use the bread machine method, I use the kitchen aide mixer with the dough hook. No work!

Loved this recipe....BUT as one user suggested I used 1 1/4 cups butter and 1 1/4 cups brown sugar for the sauce .....it made them MUCH gooyier....The recipe, as is, is kinda dry and not sticky enough . Once you make this little adjustment .....hold onto your hat ....these buns are quite addictive .!!

MY HUSBAND AND I AND EVERYONE LOVE THIS RECIPE.  IT IS SO AMAZING.  EVERYONE AT MY MOPS GROUP REQUESTES THIS WHEN IT IS MY TURN TO MAKE BREAKFAST.  THE ONLY THING I CHANGE IS THAT THE LAST PART OF BUTTER I SPREAD ON THE DOUGH AND THEN PAT THE CINNAMON AND BROWN SUGAR MIX INTO IT.  I THINK IT HOLDS THE FLAVOR BETTER THAN MELTING IT.  HOPE YOU ENJOY.

Instead of melting the butter and putting in a 9x13 pan, I've always used cake pans.  Take butter right from fridge and slice into 1/2 tbs pieces.  Scatter brown sugar, nuts, and butter pieces in bottom of cake pans. Continue with directions for recipe.  When done, invert onto plate and you have your topping.

WoW!  I just managed to impress my boyfriend tonight.  The buns were soft and gooey and just the right sweetness.  I increased the cinnamon by half a tsp.  because I like cinnamon a lot and since I did not have any pecans I used walnuts.   I also replaced the active dry yeast with 2 tsp.instant yeast which I added to the flour.  I kept the original time to raise the yeast, the result was very good.  Two thumbs up.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I wish I had made two batches as they disappeared instantly!  I will definitely be making these often.  I used a 10 x 13 pan and also wished I had either used a bigger pan or even two pans.  The buns were huge but were kept from getting even bigger due to all being in one pan.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!!

VERY GOOD. I made them about 5 times so far. I made some for Easter and everyone loved them. I used the icing from the Cinnabon Clone recipe and I also only cooked them for about 15 minutes. These are definitely worth trying.

Delicious, although the first time I made them they were a lil too sweet. So, the second time i reduced the sugar in the 'goo' in the bottom of the pan to 1/2 cup (instead of 3/4) and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. It did the trick & they tasted amazing & were way better than any store / bakery bought cinnamon buns!

these are AMAZING. I just made these today for my fiance, and he loved them (ate FOUR of them at once!). I liked them too, and I"m not one who typically likes American pastries (usually too sweet). Anyways, i followed the recipe exactly (except I made just half the recipe, since it's just my fiance and me and we didn't want to gain 10 lbs :D). Also I used soy milk instead of regular milk. The result was great!! I swear, even though it does take ~3 hours and you'll have a lot of cleaning up to do in your kitchen, you won't regret it!!

With a few changes, this is a fabulous recipe.  As another reviewer noted, 15 buns didn't fit well into a 9 x 13 pan; when I realized this, I had to made more sauce for the second (8x8) pan.  The total amount of sauce I made (which I thought was just the right amount to make them nice and gooey) was 1 1/c cups butter and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar - this was enough sauce to generously cover the bottom of both pans.  I also added peanut pieces since I didn't have pecans; they were good but I'll use pecans next time.  I read several comments about them being over cooked so I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes - perfect!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I am not sure how you could not love these!  They are the best sticky buns I have ever had...hands down! One tip I found that shortened the overall prep time was "proofing" the buns in the oven. You just have to heat your oven to 200 degrees F and then shut it off. Any time you need them to rise (in the bowl and in the pan) you can just cover them with the damp towel and place them on the middle rack of the warmed up oven. I noticed that some people said it was time consuming so I did this to speed it all up. It really did the trick. I also only had to bake them for 20 minutes. Over all it only took 1 hr and 45 minutes to finish them as the dough only had to rise for 30 minutes the first time around and then the buns only had to rise for 20 minutes before baking.

I have one question about this recipe. If I wanted to make this the evening before && bake them in the morning the next day, what would I have to do differently for the best outcome?

Clone of a cinnabon is OK...This recipe is much better to me because it is most like the buns my mom made growing up. I could never quite duplicate my mom's recipe and now I have a fighting chance!

Maybe it is just me and being a new cook,however, I have tried this recipe twice now exactly to the directions. Each time there is either not enough flour called for or I am not sure how to properly kneed the dough! Anyway, the dough is so sticky that I am constantly peeling it off my hands, already coated in dough. When using an addition of flour, the rolls come out very dry. It must be me since this recipe has recived rave reviews from others but I am afraid I will try another recipe

A very nice dough, however there wasn't nearly enough filling to spread across the entire rolled-out rectangle, resulting in a not-very-cinnamony cinnamon roll.  I recommend doubling the filling (at least) and maybe adding some cinnamon to the goo that you put in the bottom of the pan.  I put the prepped rolls in the fridge overnight - they rose about halfway, then puffed up nicely when I baked them.

Absolutely the best cinnamon roll I have made in my life, and I have made 100s of them! This is the only recipe I have made more than once, and in fact have made now more than 5 times!  No changes made, once in a while I leave the nuts out, but otherwise followed recipe to a tee!  Enjoy!  And stop looking for a cinnamon roll recipe cuz this is it!

The best cinnamon bun recipe I have ever had, ever!  I love that it is all real ingredients and a non-bread maker recipe too.  Everyone at work begs me to bring these for a special treat and my family melts into the ooey-ness every time I make them.

Wow these were awesome! I made both the "cinnabon" recipe from this site, as well as the soft moist and gooey cinnamon buns" and they were (all three recipes" incredibly delicious, moist, fluffy with nothing bad to say about them. It is actually hard to say which one was the best. What I liked about this one, is that the glaze is ready when the buns are ready. I rolled the dough a little bit thinner and got about 30 buns from it and baked it in two separate dishes. Unfortunately, this way, meant that the glaze would be stretched a little too thin, but most people seemed to still love it that way! My brother actually said "it's like they were made in heaven!". This was really surprising for me to hear him say that, since he is usually the not so impressed serious type! :)... Most people at the family gathering thought these were the ultimate, with the exeption of one who would have liked to see some extra glaze, which was my fault and I should have doubled it since I stretched out the dough. All in all, FABULOUS RECIPE!! wORTH ALL THE WORK :), THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING!

Excellent (and fool proof) recipe!  I even forgot to add the eggs until after I was finished kneading and then had to go back and add them (before the rising) and it still worked out beautifully.  A recipe that you'll be proud to say you made =)

This recipe makes delicious cinnamon buns! The first batch I made I skipped coating the pan with butter and brown sugar and they turned out perfect. The second time, I followed the instructions completely. I felt that they were too heavy. Letting them sit in the mixture while they rose made the bottoms very soggy. I will still make this recipe again, but I will do what I did the first time and leave out the pan coating.

So easy and delicious! I made my dough not realizing how late it was getting so I decided to wrap it up, put in the fridge and finish the next day. I wasn't sure if they were going to come out right but they were so good! and easy!

This recipe was really easy to make!!! I have tried in the past to make sweet dough and bread from scratch and they just never seemed to turn out exactly as the recipe called, but THIS one was so easy and SSOOOOO GOOD!! A must for the up and coming holidays!!! I made them the night before and put them in the frig over night, and let them rise and baked them the next morning. They were all gone in a matter of minutes!!!

I changed it a bit, but it's an awesome recipe.  Original recipe used only nuts, but since I only had dried fruit I used that.   So my version has dried peaches, apricots, apples, pears and raisins. Instead of melting the butter to spread on the dough, I softened and mixed it with Parkay and spread it on like that so that the rolls would be soft.  I've put up a picture of my finished version.

I was hoping for so much more than what these turned out to be. It was too salty, it tasted too much like the yeast, the butter sugar mixture burnt to a crisp- it was overall a terrible outcome. I just can't believe that so much went wrong.

Absolutely perfect!! I've made a few different cinnamon roll recipes, trying to find one that my husband would love (he is big on cinnamon buns!) and these ones are a winner! Very impressed with house fluffy and flaky they are. I let them rise an extra 1/2 hour each time. They're delicious!

These sticky buns are pretty darn good!I made a double batch(one for friends) and let the 1st rise go for about 2 1/2 hours.After cutting them, I ran out of time & could not bake them, so I let them rise over night & baked them off the next morning.They were yummy!My hubby ate 3 with breakfast.I did make alittle more topping for the bottom.One other reviewer suggested cooking the topping less,I think alittle longer cooking would be better.I followed the directions exactly and believe the flavor would intensify with a little longer( not much) cooking time.But to each his own-I will make these again.The procedure was so easy.I did use rapid rise yeast.

This recipe made a great sticky bun.  The only thing I changed was to add 1/4 c. cream cheese to the 1/4 butter that was spread on the dough before rolling.  This seemed to make the rolls hold their moisture, even after cooling.  Not that we had many left to get cold!!!  I have gotten request after request from friends to make these and bring to work.  Fairly easy and economical pastry.

Great recipe but hard to get out of the pan after baking because the praline hardened and stuck - even with a parchment lined pan.  Next time I will IMMEDIATELY invert onto a serving plate after baking. For the filling I mix SOFTENED butter with the cinnamon etc and use an off-set spatula to spread that mixture on the dough instead of brushing MELTED butter then sprinkling the cinnamon etc on.  I find this yields a gooey-er and softer bun. :)  I use dental floss to cut the individual buns - way easier than using a knife.

I'm currently 8 months pregnant and had a craving for cinnamon buns. So i was getting all the ingredients outs and noticed that i was all out of milk but you don't deny a pregnant women, so instead i used vanilla ice cream. Which worked just as well and i even got complements from people about how good the dough was. If anyone does try this or is forced to do this i could in turn only use 3 1/2 cups of flour for some reason. But everything else stayed the same

Cinnamon buns are my dad's favorite food so for father's day, I made this recipe for him.  He absolutely loved them!  The entire recipe was gone within two days, but before he had eaten them all, I managed to steal one. They were the best that I have ever tasted!! I frosted them with cream cheese cinnamon bun icing and it was wonderful. GREAT RECIPE!

I was disappointed with the recipe. I cut the dough in half, making one 9-inch round pan of sticky buns, and one of cinnamon rolls. The bake time is woefully too long, resulting in a burned sugar mess on the bottom of the sticky bun pan.  

I will try again, making the following changes:
Use a bread machine to make the dough.
Add a bit of nutmeg to the dough.
Spread softened butter over dough & then sprinkle with cinnamon & brown sugar for the filling.
Use thread or dental floss to cut the rolls.
Add 2-4 T. cream or milk to the "ooey gooey" topping in the bottom of the pan. (And I may just cube cold butter & sprinkle in the bottom of the pan with the brown sugar rather than melting together.)
Change from metal to glass pans in an effort to prevent burning.
Bake at 350 degrees for 18 minutes -- and start checking at 15 minutes.

while checking my emails I came across this recipe and decided to try it because it looked so good and boy was I right.  I watched the video and I told my husband all the problems I had in the past with the yeast.  Today was a real lucky day I took my time and followed it carefully and no problem everything worked like clock work.  I am thrilled with delight that they came out great.  I did run into 1 minor problem i had them in a deep dish pie pan and the mixture bubbled over but I place a sheet of aluminum foil and it burned the oven but no fire.  Next time I will use a deeper pan.  I am so proud of myself for trying and this is a great recipe and they are so delicious and soft.  They are so yummy and deserve really 10 stars.

These are delicious, especially right out of the oven!  My husband prepared them just as directed, only adding a few raisins to the inside cinnamon mixture.  Took some time, but patience paid off!  So much better than store bought cans, or even the box mixes!   Try them for a holiday or anytime you want a special treat.

I tried another recipe a few months ago and the rolls didn't turn out as wonderful as I would have liked them to...however this recipe was perfect! I let them rise a little over an hour and fifteen minutes so the dough was quite large and they turned out amazingly. Wonderful recipe and will be using it many more times!

Cinnamon buns turned out large, fluffy, and deliciously gooey.  The dough mixed well, and baked beautifully in the oven.  If you like big, sweet, soft cinnamon buns then this is the recipe for you.  Sadly, I could not add the pecans to mine, as my daughter refuses to eat them :(  Pecans probably would've made these even more fantastic!  Definitely worth keeping.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS.  The only change I made was to use walnuts instead of pecans.  Other than that, the recipe was straightforward and I enjoyed every minute of baking these.  Definitely takes patience, but SO worth it.

I have to agree with many of the other reviews these are amazing out of the oven. I follwed the recipe minus the glaze on the top, i did the dough the night before. After reading another review about the dough being to sticky and having the same problem i was scared that it wouldn't come out the next morning. I am happy to say that leaving the dough overnight was much the way to go, the dough was easy to roll out, and the filling was more than enough to fill the buns. The plus side of also leaving it overnight was i did not have to wait the extra hour to leave them rise again, just cut and put in the oven they came out great

These were great however I'm only rating it 4 stars because the bake time of 25 minutes was way too long and mine came out very well done....next time I will only bake for 15 minutes.

Very good and easy if following directions exactly. I didn't know anything about baking in pinwheel shapes so the instructions helped a lot. I would say at first I was scared that the dough didn't turn out right as it was extremely sticky and elastic but with some kneading on a floured surface it was great. Also I didn't realize that the buns should be baked close 2gether so that they can rise up instead of spreading out, figured that out and all was good to go. Thanks for the awesome and simple to understand recipe!

These are YUMMY! I realized I had no blrown sugar when I was making them though, so I used white sugar instead, but it turned out just as good! (And all the friends I fed them to say the same :P)

WOW these are super! I only made one change, used 2c a-p flour and 2c whole wheat flour. Everything else I did as written. These are 'special occasion' treats in my opinion, so much butter and sugar but I made this for my son's birthday breakfast, they sure put a smile on his face. They rose so well, I was just so pleased with how great they came out.

You won’t get any complaints with these rolls, they are wonderful.   I loved the buttery flavor that comes through in the dough and caramel topping.  As is my habit, I cut the dough into 12 rolls instead of 15.  I also don’t melt the butter to spread on the dough, but use softened butter for more control and less mess on my pastry board.  It is a very sweet recipe so next time I would decrease the brown sugar in the filling to ½ cup.  Not only do they taste good, but look yummy.

These cinnamon buns are very tasty!  Someone made them for me first and they were great.  When I made them myself they turned out a bit dry and hard.  I'll have to try making them again, maybe with the oven turned down a bit or baked a little less.  A little time-consuming but worth it in the end!

I wish I could give 4.5 stars, bc the end product really IS delicious. I knock it back a 1/2 star though for not being as "ooey-gooey" as the name implies - DEFINITELY could have used more gooey to earn it's name. But they were still delicious.

As the title says, ooey-gooey, but only when warm from the oven. In our home we like to slice horizontally, butter both sides and grill. These were not good at all the following day. I'm sorry but the ooey gooey turns to crystalized sugar and is not very appitizing. Won't make this again.

My husband and I have been craving for a GOOD cinnamon bun ever since we had the best from a cute Cafe in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 2006. This comes close to the best except that I think the butter/brown sugar mixture might have been better off poured on top of the buns instead of onto the baking dish as mine got stuck on the dish and I had a hard time scraping them onto the buns. I will try again another time.

I ADORE this recipe.  These are a very soft and fresh tasting bread.  I've always really liked them.  I think my only wish would be to have more of the sticky stuff from the pan actually be on the buns... I often take a knife and scoop up some of it out of the pan when I take a bun out, and spread it on the top of the bun!

I'm giving these 5 stars because they were to die for, even though my caramel wasn't as ooey gooey as it should have been, which was my fault.  I used a metal baking dish, and should have realized they would get done sooner.  They weren't burned, just the caramel was a little overdone after about 20 min.  My husband still was impressed, though.  I also used the cinnamon bun icing from this website, which was great because of my caramel issues lol!  I will definitely be making these again!

So So good. I accidentally left them to rise 2 hours in the last stage of rising and it still turned out great. I have made cinnamon buns a few times over the years but I have never ever had them come close to looking as good as these ones did.

I have tried a few other highly rated cinnamon bun recipes from this site but none have come close to this one!! With other recipes I found the bun was too dry and didn't have that soft chewiness I was looking for.  I did increase the amount of caramel to put in the pan.  After taking out of the oven, I tossed them into a larger sheet pan and turned them in the caramel to ensure they were all coated evenly. Great recipe!!

We were really looking forward to trying this recipe. After 3 hours, we tried it and although the taste was good, it was quite dry.. I think I should have listened to other reviews and baked it in less time.  It makes a big batch, so I put some in the microwave, and its piping hot delicious. Eat it up quickly, because once it gets cold, it gets really dry.

These were excellent!  I took it for granted that the hubby (who requested cinnamon buns, and therefore became the baker's apprentice today) would know that a stick of butter is 1/2 c.--he didn't.  So, I learned after these went into the oven that he had only used 1/2c. butter instead of 3/4 c. for the bottom of the pan.  It didn't matter in the end.  Changes I made:  I don't like to use saucepans when a microwave will do.  So, I microwaved the butter when it called for a saucepan.  To make the brown sugar and butter meld together in the microwave, I first microwaved the butter until melted, then added the brown sugar, stirred, then microwaved an additional thirty seconds.  I have a high-wattage microwave, and 30 sec was fine for this.  I let the dough ball rise overnight, then let it rise for an additional four hours after forming it into the buns.  My house is quite cold, so I let them rise in the microwave, which carries a residual heat.  We doubled the filling.  We used whole pecans.  Delicious, quick, and easy!  Will be using this one again.

okay. this is the first time I am making bread and to be honest, My rolls are a flop. they did not rise and had the texture of half cooked pasta. But they tasted sooo good! I think what went wrong was during the proofing! I used hot water from the boiler and that must have killed the yeast! Will try again because I am sure I will get it right!

I reduced the butter by half (not in the dough - the butter that is melted w/the brown sugar and the butter that you brush on) and used about half the brown sugar also. They were still excellent and quite simple!

These may be time consuming but they are totally worth it. The only thing that has been altered in this recipe is instead of adding pecans to the cinnamon mixture that goes in the bun, I added 1/2 cup of raisins instead. I also drizzled an icing sugar glaze on top of the buns once they were done baking. Thanks so much for this recipe! It's a keeper for this cook!

The first mistake I made was making them. The second mistake was sharing. I had to make them once a week for a while. These are the best Cinnamon Buns I have ever had, better then Cinn-a-bon or ST.Cinnamon. I left the nuts out of the recipe. I am just not a nut in cinnamon bun fan. I always have trouble rolling up the dough with the brown sugar coating. It wants to unravel. Other then that it is pretty easy, takes a while, but easy.

These cinnamon buns are the best I have ever tasted. I'm not generally a sweet lover (salt is my vice), but I literally had to ask someone to take them out of the house. After I allowed myself a treat and had one for breakfast I knew I wouldn't have been able to stop. I would have hovered over them and continued eating these buns all day. If someone had claimed to have made these buns them self I would not have believed them. A little practice is needed to roll evenly. Believe me, practicing won't be a hardship. Cheers to Dakota Kelly for generously sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is an excellent sticky bun or gooey cinnamon bun recipe.  I made the dough exactly as written.  These are the changes I made to the filling and topping:  I used 1/2 cup raisins soaked in rum (to plump them) in the filling.  The topping I increased to 1 cup each, butter and brown sugar and added 3 Tbsp's pancake syrup to it (you could use honey, maple syrup or corn syrup).  I think it made the topping more typical of a sticky bun, which was what I wanted.  It wasn't grainy and didn't harden at all.  It thickend to a nice sticky caramel sauce upon cooling.  I used the full cup of chopped, toasted pecans for the topping.   Husband absolutely raved about them.  Will definately make these again.  Thanks, Dakota Kelly, for the great recipe!

Other than switching raisins for pecans, I followed this recipe exactly.  I added a couple tablespoons of milk to dough because it seemed dry while mixing in the KA.  After that, the dough was very easy to work with.  They are everything you want in sticky buns.  Very substantial and the recipe is well-written.  Perfect amount of ooey-gooey.  I baked them in a 9 X 14 pan.

Oh my God these are SO GOOD.  They're delicious when you first take them out, they're delicious the day after cold, and they're yummy when they're reheated in the microwave for 30 seconds.  I used walnuts this time, which I liked.  At the husband's request next time, I think I'll leave the nuts out of the filling and use pecans in the syrup.  I bet it'd be good with raisins rolled into the filling as well.

I made these today and I can not believe how wonderful they are! This recipe is the best! I will definitely make these again. The only thing that I will do next time is separate the buns more before I bake them. I had them at about 1 inch apart this time but I think 2 inches apart will make them perfect!

These were good, although pretty time consuming, and I thought they could have used a little more filling. I made a vanilla powdered sugar icing to go on top.

This recipe is awesome! I did modify a little based on recommendations. I replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat. I also did the kneading and first rise in my bread machine. I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup brown sugar in the bottom of 2 8x8 baking dishes. Then I covered with plastic wrap and went to bed. 6 hrs later, I took them out and left at room temp for 1 hr. Baked for 20 minutes and they were superb! Nice and soft, very ooey and gooey!! I may actually cut back slightly on the butter and brown sugar last night to what was in the original recipe. Otherwise, awesome!

Did these in the bread machine. I added 1/2 cup more flour because the dough was a little wet and they turned out perfectly. My father in law (who is difficult to please) raved about them!  I made them the night before, let them rise in the fridge overnight and baked them in the morning. YUMMY!

This was the first time I made sticky buns.  They took me all day to make, but that's because I had to run out a few times during the process.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I let the dough rise more than an hour (because I didn't get back in time).  They turned out beautifully!!  They are really good.  I doubled the ooey-gooey, but it wound up being too much for me.  If you love sugar, double it, if you don't want tons of sugar, the recipe is perfect.  I will DEFINITELY make these again!!

WOW! Yes! I totally recommend doubling the filling AND the ooey gooey!! These are fabulous! I didn't double anything and it came out wonderful but I wished I had doubled it!! Also I made a frosting of 3 cups powered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 2-3 Tbl milk and 3/4 tsp salt. They were gone in a hurry!! But if you double the ooey gooey and use this icing these are really ooey gooey!! Five plus all around!! Thanks Jen!!!!

My mother made these buns (substituting
her favorite refrigerator roll recipe) and using all Splenda (pure Splenda in the roll recipe and Spenda Brown Sugar in the GOOEY portion). The Buns were a big hit and really tasty.

Orgasmic!

I added more sugar, cinnamon, and butter, and I didn't cook for as long as recommended, I also made an easy topping:

1 package cream cheese
1 stick butter
1 tablespoon milk
1 tablespoon vanilla
enough powdered sugar to lightly thicken

they are incredible and amazing!

Jen,

Quit your job and start selling these, you will be a rich woman.

The bread recipe for these is wonderful.  However, I followed the recipe exactly, and there is not nearly enough filling or goo in the bottom of the pan for these to be called "ooey-gooey".  In fact, they didn't have any "goo drip" at all, and the filling was barely enough to cover the rolled out dough.  The flavor is great, but they are more of a pecan sweet roll than a cinnamon bun/roll.  They reheat in the microwave to be just as good as they were the night before from the oven.  The next time I make these, I'll just double or triple the filling and double the goo in the bottom of the pan; that will make them 5-star.

First of all, I started by warming up the milk first so it could cool while I dissolved the yeast and sugar.  Then when both were ready, I put the milk mixture, the yeast mixture, the eggs and the flour into my kitchen aid mixer with the mixing piece on low speed to combine them. I also used the same setting to mix in each 1/2 c. addition of flour until the last one. When there was only 1/2 c. of flour left, I changed from the mixing piece to the dough hook to complete the mixing of the flour and then I turned the speed up and let the dough hook and my kitchen aid to do the kneading for me.  Then I did the rest as directed.  
Doing it this way took out alot of the manual labor and I had more time to do other things.
These rolls were very sweet and perfect! Try the recipe as written first then make changes the next time if needed.  You may be suprised with the initial results!

My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and my boyfriend and I make an effort to have a quiet, relaxing but filling breakfast together at least once per week. I thought I would try these since they're our favorite item when we go out for breakfast. I've never tried making anything like this and I thought it was a little tricky but I think its only because of my inexperience. I hated the long wait but they were worth it! My boyfriend and I moaned with every bite! I took other suggestions and baked for less time and we ate the remaining portion of the batch with lunch later that day. Never got stale and these were the best I ever had and ever thought that I could make. I feel like a pro! Thanks Jen!

Well Jen, you outdid yourself and everyone else with this recipe. They are ooey-gooey enough for my family. We love 'em! Whether straight out of the oven or warmed up after they sit a couple days, the dough part is wonderful...sweet, moist and soft. These beat clone of a cinnabon.I did them in my zoji bread machine. It needs some help at the mixing stage, so I used my rubber spatula to help the machine get it mixed.Thanks for sharing.

Theses cinnamon rolls are the best that I've ever made, and I've tried plenty of different recipes.  I add raisins inside the rolls and also use whole pecans between the caramel and dough, and these buns are as good as it gets.  THANKS JEN!

The dough was perfect and the recipie was much easier than I expected.  I also found them easy to overcook (doh!), they were probably done at about 18min.  Overall, still very sweet and delicious.

I really love this one..I added raisens to mine and they were outragious! Be sure to follow Jen's recipe to a tee because I tried adding extra brown sugar and butter for the bottom of the pan and it glues tight to the bottom and its very hard like taffy..you live and you learn!LOL..I have made this like 10 times already ,they beg for me to make it again..Great job!!

These tasted really good and were fairly easy to make.  I used raisins instead of pecans.  They weren't as fluffy as most cinnamon buns but good non-the-less

They are not quite as "ooey gooey" as I thought they would be. It's a good recipe, but I have made better before. They tasted better with some frosting on them.

Tastes pretty good, but didn't blow my mind or anything like that.  Hubby liked it more than I did.  Took a long time and great effort to make IMO.  Glad I used the Clone of a Cinnabon icing too as that really added a touch of yum to them.

A Christmas morning tradition in our home is to serve cinnamon buns after the stockings are opened. Our 17 year old daughter made these this year and they were absolutely delicious.

These are Great..Just like Cinnabon (if not better)I do suggest lowering temp to 350-360. After flipping them over I drizzled with a cream cheese frosting WOW!!! Definitely worth the wait.

Phenomenal rolls! This recipe is the best I have tried. The rolls we soft on the inside, slightly crispy on the top, not overly sweet yet delectable. They were gone in24 hours and I doubled the recipe.
Guess what I am making tonight?

Totally a hit! Used 3.5 cups flour in my mixer and found the dough was too dry, so I used a little more milk to make it a little stickier.  Then used the other 1/2 cup to flour the surface and knead it to the right texture. Doubled the cinnamon brown sugar mixture for the bottom of the pan. Added the pecans. Spread soft butter on the rolled out dough. Added another 1 Tbsp of cinnamon to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture for the inside. Added pecans. Let it rise in a warm oven for the first and second rise. Baked it in a glass 13x9 glass dish at 375 degrees for 18 mins. Buttered the tops of the cinnamon buns. Turned them over on a dish and all the ooey gooey topping stayed on top of the buns. The dough was soft and the topping was fabulous.  Did not use the icing as it would have been too sweet. This is my go to recipe for cinnamon buns as long as I live!

Easy  recipe.
Added  some ground cardamom, and a generous squeeze of corn syrup to the pecan base. Also added  grated zest of 1/2 orange to give it some zing.
Came out fantastic-definitely will keep this recipe.
Bread itself was nice and tender-use whole milk if possible, it makes a more tender bread.....

My family loved this recipe and I replaced the butter for margarine and didn't use as much. Also I didn't put butter on top, but next time I will because I imagine that would make them even more moist! Best when hot ( as if that needed to be said ) !

This  recipe was really good!  They are delicious cinnamon buns that sit in a Carmel pecan sauce.  It is worth the time and steps, so don't skimp!  This will be great for the next big family breakfast, especially since it looks as though they can be made ahead and then baked in the morning.

I love this recipe! I personally change a few things to suit my family though. I am allergic to pecans so i skip those entirely. Instead one large pan i use three 9' disposable pie tins ($1.50 for 3 at the dollar store)i fit 5-6 buns per tin. this makes it so i can serve one almost immediately and gift one and save one. perfect for our family of 4. (soon to be 5) I highly recommend using the smaller pans for smaller families or those that don't eat them as quickly. :D I would love to know if they freeze well because i have yet to try.

Is my first time making cinnamon buns and it had turned out wonderful. The taste is delicious with the pecans in it which makes it even better! However, the brown sugar at the bottom of the pan is way too sticky. Since we could not finished 12 cinnamon buns in a day. We decided to put it into the fridge but it had got sticken to the plate and is really hard to come out. Overall, the cinnamon buns is pretty good.

I use Walnuts instead of Pecans.  I find that the walnuts are a bit tastier and less tart than pecans.  It would certainly be to each one's likes.

I have been looking for a cinnamon roll recipe. This is the third one I tried and I loved it. I didn't modify anything. I was trying to find something close to my mother's rolls because she can no longer make them. I took some to my parents and Mom approved :) I would like to add that I just started making bread - I am not that good at it and these rolls turned out perfectly.

Well worth the effort. Excellent recipe as is. I do tinker with recipes, however, so I went for the ooiest gooiest I could get. Used a tad more yeast, because this dough is resilient and I wanted height. Added a tad more brown sugar and butter to the pan bottom (must distribute right into the corners) A few more pecans... A tad more brown sugar and cinnamon onto the dough. And then cut the roll into 14 pieces, rather than 15. They were tall, tender and gooey. Friends came by unexpectedly and now they think I do this sort of thing everyday. As for stale leftovers? What leftovers!

Delicious! Even better with cream cheese frosting on top!
I had to work, so i made the dough in the morning and let it rise for about 5 hours; then when I rolled and cut them I let them rise again before baking for about 4 hours. They were so fluffy!

I always end up making these cinnamon rolls because the other recipes require a bread machine or instant pudding mix or mashed potatoes. I really appreciate that this recipe only calls for standard ingredients and tools. These cinnamon rolls present beautifully, and the topping is really gooey caramel. Everyone raves about these. Me, I'd prefer them to be a little more cinnamon-y and a little less caramel-y, but they're still quite good.

These buns were amazing.  The Amish make these and I have always liked them.  The most important thing is that you follow exactly the making the bread part of the recipe. Don't rush it.  I probably added more pecans than it called for because I like a really nutty bun. I also used a powerful cinnamon and some cloves. The rest of the recipe was pretty much on target.  In the end success is defined by how many will take seconds. Everyone did.  We had a few left over and the host of the party kept them hidden.  They tasted great and they looked beautiful.  I also looked like an amazing cook.  I will make them again.

Delicious!!  Had trouble getting all of the sugar to properly dissolve.  I don't think it is the recipe, I think it is me.  Maybe I am rushing it once it is on the stovetop.

These are very yummy! Just be careful with the bottom filling overflowing. It mades lots of smoke but thank god no fire. I would suggest putting a cookie under it to catch the drippings.

Tasty but cooking time was too long.  Next time I will shorten the cooking to 20 minutes.  Aside from that, the flavour was very good.

Made these for my family. What a hit. First time I ever made cinnamon rolls outside of the break and bake package. I added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp cardamon. Wonderful!

So, my daughter, who has a hard time boiling water without burning it, decided to make cinnamon rolls when she got home from school today.  I was out or I would have vetoed that decision as it is always just a waste of ingredients.  Unbelieveable...these were the best cinnamon rolls that I have ever tasted.  She substituted raisins for the pecans and she increased the cinnamon.  She cooked them for 20 minutes as someone else had suggested.  Honestly and truly, if my kitchen-challenged daughter can make this recipe turn out so perfect, everyone who loves cinnamon rolls needs this recipe in their collection.  Thanks so much for posting it!

OMG these are by far the best cinnoman rolls ever. Easy to make and turn out great everytime. My mother just loves when I make these. The only thing I do different is I don't add any nuts to the brown sugar cinnoman part I use them all on top. thanks for the recipe. Crowed please for sure.

These gooey cinnamon buns are a hit. My father (who worked in a bakery for many years) said they were delicious and I could easily sell them. Only complaint here is that beating the egg/yeast/flour mixture will end up with pieces flying everywhere. I eventually used my hands to get the rest of the flour incorporated. Also it's quite difficult to make the dough into a perfect, even rectangle.

Excellent!!  I appreciated one reviewer's note about flipping these upside-down immediately after they come out of the oven to allow for the sugar mixture to soak through the buns.  I will try that next time, but they were still very good as is!  As a side note - 20 minutes in the oven was a good bake time; 25 and they would have been far too brown.

These are really good. Akin to what my mom, a professional baker, makes (although I think she puts raisins in there somewhere.. that's a nice touch) Anyone complaining about dryness: you have to flip the buns out onto another surface as soon as they're done baking so the sugar-butter coats them and soaks in. Although, as others have said, you might want to increase it to really deserve the description "ooey-gooey".. Although I personally like them as it is.

These are pretty good, however they turned out a bit too well done following the recipe exactly.  I will try this again, however, next time I will either drop the temperature or cover after 20 minutes.  I drizzled on a vanilla glaze for some extra color.

This was the first time I made Cinnamon buns. I was looking for soft & gooey. Unfortunately, the carmel became very hard after it cooled. I pulled the buns out of the oven when they started to brown, but it was still too late. They are already getting hard. I would say that you should pull these out of the oven right as they begin to turn brown. I don't know what to say about the carmel, that was just sad..

I just made these and they're alright. I did what other reviewers suggested and didn't melt the butter for the inside of the rolls, but did for the caramel sauce and they wound up being soggy on the bottom and crunchy on the top. Next time I won't melt any of the butter and hopefully they turn out better. Still delicious, just the wrong texture. Also, I'm contemplating making these in the style of cinnamon rolls.

I was so excited to make this after all the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe and the caramel/nut mixture burned the pan and the rolls.  And the rolls came out hard! I waited one hour for yeast to rise and it rose, perhaps I should have waited longer!

These were delicious. I made them a week ago, and am making some more tomorrow so we can have them for Christmas breakfast, (okay it may not be the healthiest breakfast but its Christmas :)Im sure they are 5 star worthy, but I upped the brown suger to 1c and increased the cinnamon by a bit. I also added some cream cheese icing to it and they were to die for!! Thank you for the recipe. It was super good.

Good lordy these are amazing!! I was looking through this site looking for something to do today and I found these buns and I am too impressed with these! I used King Aurther Unbleached Bread flour and these rolls taste professional. I had no problems cutting the rolls with a knife and I cannot wait to make these again!! This is going down as the only recipe I will ever use, ever, for cinnamon buns. No more stale, hard store-bought one's for me! It is a little time-consuming. I started at 1:15 p.m and just finished at 4:35. Worth every bit of time, however.

These were very good!  I've been searching for the perfect pecan roll for years and this is definitely the closest I've come.  The dough part of this recipe is pretty much the exact same recipe as the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe on this site...just a tad more of this or that, but ultimately the same.  I think next time I may use the Cinnabon dough recipe (I like what is different about that recipe-a tad sweeter) with this caramel topping. I only made 6 rolls (froze the other half of the dough for later), but I didn't halve the caramel topping.  While it was de-lish that way, I think next time I'll only 1 1/2 the recipe, just to be a *tad* more healthy (can you even use that word here?).  I also followed the advice of reviewers who said to take them out early, and I won't do it again, they were completely doughy still.  I cooked them about what the recipe states.  They did get quite brown on top though.  Once they start getting brown, I'll cover them with a piece of foil next time for the rest of the cook time.

These were delicious, but they were not as gooey as I was expecting them to be. The sauce burned a little bit in the bottom, even though I followed the exact instructions. However, they tasted better for some reason after having been refrigerated for a night. *HINT* (this is my mistake, and my rating is not based on this) Do not add frosting to these cinnamon buns. They are sweet enough as it is.

Whoa! These are awesome! I will have to make the icing next time. I didn't really have a warm place to put these, so the dough took longer to rise and left them alone overnight. Time consuming, but WELL WORTH THE WAIT!

I must say, I was SURPRISED OUT OF MY MIND, when I made this. It took a while to make and I followed the directions perfectly. They came out AMAZING, gooey and moist, melt in your mouth. I couldnt believe it. I also added some icing on top and I didnt have any peacans, so I added some raisins. Just great. I had TWO and regret it. :P Should only be made once a year because it is just too good and WAY better than CINNABON or whatever its called. I did change a few things here and there, but not too much. :) Will be making every year or for work or church. Thanks for the recipes, unbelievable.

I also substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the flour, and reduced the baking time -- overall, these were AMAZING and really were wonderful leftovers as well.

Great recipe.The dough tastes great. I think next time, they would be even "gooey-er" if you added the mixture on top of the rolls in addition to lining the bottom of the pan with it. I also baked for 25 minutes, and they could have been taken out 2-3 minutes sooner just to be softer. Otherwise GREAT recipe. Loved by all.

I made those for brunch a week ago, but when I made them I started them the night before with making the dough I let it rise for 3 hours then I made the rolles and then I let them rise over night and the next day I baked them right before brunch and my in - laws loved them My mother in Law was impressed with me they are the best, here are some tips I spend the butter on the dough inseted of brushing it on makes them more gooey, let them rise over night, and eat them after about 2 mins after they are done that will make them good.

I made these a week ago and my fiance LOVED them!  We each ate one and decided they were so deadly we better not eat the rest...(trying to conform to the pre-wedding diet!)  He took them to work and his coworkers devoured them.  I will definitely be making these again! My two cents:  Also used dental floss to cut the rolls, much easier than a knife.  I used room-temperature butter to spread on the rolled dough, rather than melted – spreads nicely that way.  I also added extra filling, and they tasted amazing.

Although time-consuming (put the dough in my oven and it took almost 2 hours to rise), it was worth making these. Everyone commented that they were the best sticky buns they've ever had. They were still good for warming up in the microwave for a couple days. I will make them again.

OMG!! These are excellent! We lost our Cinnabon shop a couple years ago and my fav was the Sticky Pecan Rolls and this was a little piece of heaven! I made a batch for my sister in law for her family for Christmas morning, I'm sure they'll love them!  Only thing I did additionally was to make an icing sugar drizzle with icing sugar, vanilla extract and milk.  Yummy! They heat up well in the microwave on a low setting like defrost.  Thank you sooo much for this recipe! :D

Love these buns!  Whenever I have made them, I always bake them in muffin tins so that they are already in individual sizes and it is nicer to display them this way, especially if they are a gift.

This morning is the second time I've made this recipe.  It is excellent and the closest I could find to a recipe I had years ago.  As always, anything that is homemade with quality ingredients is always so worth the while to make.  Allow yourself plenty of time.

it took me three tries to get these right!  I make a double batch of the sauce for a single recipe, just to get more a more ooey factor.  this is the best cinnamon bun recipe I have found, and while I am not 100% satisfied, I still will continue to make them!

Awesome! I agree with the others- it is time consuming (took me about 3.5 hours) but worth the wonderful results in the end.   I followed the recipe almost exactly.. I used only 1/2 cup of pecans but that's simply a personal preference.   As for the cutting the rolls, I followed the advice of others and used the string/dental floss. It took about 25 minutes to bake and my only wish is that I used a pan bigger than 9x13.   Will make again and again!

I did this recipe minus the ooey-gooey (personal preference). The dough was a little dry when mixing it, so I took the suggestion of other reviews to add a little splash of milk. I also used instant yeast instead of active dry, as that was all I had on hand. I used 0.20 oz (20% less) of instant yeast instead of the 0.25oz of active dry yeast, and then I just followed the recipe (including proofing, or dissolving the yeast in the water and sugar). I lengthened the rising time for around half an hour on the first rise just because I had the patience and time to do so =P. For the sugar-cinnamon filling, I added an extra 1/2 TB of cinnamon for extra cinnamony yumminess, and I also used softened butter instead of melted. I cut the dough using the dental floss method, as recommended by others (take a piece of dental floss and wrap it around the log, and make a knot and pull). This resulted in perfectly round rolls! I also cut the baking time in half, because mine were already done within 10 - 12 min. The buns turned out perfect! The dough was very soft, a little moist, and delicious. Yay!

Made these for a church youth group.  They were a HIT! I doubled the recipe & they still could've eaten more.  The dough was great to work with.  This recipe will go into my permanent file!

Definitely take some time, but once you get them down, it's cake.  I do some extra of the caramel sauce for the bottom of the pan as well.  I also do a cinnamon, brown sugar, softened butter mix for the middle and don't have to worry about spreading anything twice.  As for cutting...a good serrated knife (pampered chef bread knife) works great.  Also..I made two batches once and only had a metal pan to bake the second batch.  Didn't turn out as well as the ones in the glass pan.  I think it makes the sauce on the bottom get too hot.  Thanks a ton for the recipe..the family LOVES it!

These were awesome!! My husband and the rest of the family loved them. I personally liked it with a little less ooey-gooey sauce but I found that the recipe made more than one pan so I make one pan with the topping and another without. Great recipe. I will be making this for a long time.


Hahahah been so long I'm divorced now but the buns are still amazing!
(update 2019) These are still awesome and I've been making them for a while. I always have more than a pans worth so I make half a batch without any topping and half with, it turns out great. Also I use string or unflavoured dental floss to cut the dough and it works out amazingly. Nothing smushing them down and they rise beautifully.

Absolutely FANTASTIC.
Easy recipe to follow - it was my first time making cinnamon buns, and they turned out like a professional baker's would!!  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  I used the dental floss trick instead of a knife, what a breeze!  Thank you thank you!

This is the best ever cinnamon bun I have ever tasted. This is the first time I made it too and it's so easy to do. My husband and I are loving it. It is so buttery and it melts in my mouth....ohhhhhhhhh soooooooooo gooooooood.

Okay. I took others' advice. First, I didn't melt the butter for the cinnamon spread. Second, I only baked it for 18 minutes. Third, I used 2 cake pans (round pans), instead of 13X9 pans. They are so good.

Directions were very methodical..nicely done. I'm not one to read all directions first (I immediately start doing what it says sentence by sentence), so I'm glad the instructions were laid out in that manner.  I never felt "rushed" to hurry and get the next step done (ie, to hurry and make the milk mixture while the yeast was curing). Each step had plenty of time to complete before it was necessary to move to the next step.  If any of that makes sense...  I just really liked the way the instructions on this recipe methodically pulled together an incredibly ooey-gooey, delicious cinnamon roll.  HOWEVER, NEXT TIME IT'S CRITICAL TO DOUBLE THE RECIPE.  This didn't make enough to let everyone indulge. :)

I am a novice Cinnamon Bun Maker, but these actually turned out quite well! They were light and fluffy instead of hard pucks like my last batch (Cinnabons Recipe) 
The caramel bottom was sooo good! Made the Cream Cheese Icing from the Clone of a Cinnabon Recipe and oh my...so good!
The only thing that was wrong with this recipe was user error...my bottom was soggy but the top was over browned. Still good though!

this are definetly much better than the cinnabon recipe...they were light and fluffy and gooey all in one.  I substituted raisens for the pecans due to a nut allergy at the school.  I would suggest cutting the margarine down for the caramel a touch as one pan came out pretty greasy...but definetly still edible!  Also a tip ***if your yeast hasn't responded and grown in the water within about 5 minutes...throw it out as then it's no more good!  Keeping the yeast in the freezer keeps it fresh...bakery secret!

My cinnamon rolls didn't turn out ooey gooey- They were great, but just not what I thought they would be. I did top them with a bit of simple icing- which kept them moist over the course of a couple days.

Absolutely the best! My friends constantly ask me to remake these! I don't follow the recipe exactly however. I refuse to use any pecans, so i put 1 cup brown sugar, 1.5 tbsp cinnamon, and about 1/4 cup of butter for what goes on the inside of the rolls. Also, i sprinkle just a bit of cinnamon into the dough itself while its being made. Really adds an extra kick to the dough.
To top, i make a frosting from 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp milk.
Fantastic!

I followed the recipe as is. The flavor was good, but the caramel-y topping got too hard. Next time, I would reduce the boiling time quite a bit. The rolls were also a bit dry. If the boiling time for the sugar was reduced, you might get a thinner sauce and thereby a more moist bread. I will try a different recipe next time, though. Thanks anyway.

Ooey, gooey, and oh-so chewy! These came out great!
 I didn't have any pecans, so I substuted walnuts and after reading some of the other reviews, I only put them in the bottom of the baking dish and it worked out great!
 Also, as another reviewer suggested, I didn't melt the butter which was spread on the inside of the rolls, I only let it become very soft and easily spreadable, and that worked out great too.
 To make sure these come out their very best make sure the butter/brown sugar mixture is thoroughly heated through before pouring it into the bottom of your baking dish. Enjoy!

These were the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made.  Normally, my cinnamon rolls taste too "yeasty" but these were perfecty buttery and sweet.  I followed the recipe except I did not have any nuts to add and they were still great. Last night, I shaped them into rolls and just left them (covered in wax paper) on my kitchen counter to rise until this morning (about 8 hours).  They had risen perfectly.  Use the thread cutting advice from another reviewer.  It works like a charm!

This recipe takes a little time, and strong arms to kneed the dough until it is silky and smooth, but well worth it. I have made this twice, once with nuts and once without. I gave these rolls as Christmas gifts to neighbors and my son's teacher. Go ahead, try it! It's perfect!!

Very, very good!  They are just the tiniest bit dry, so next time I will use another reviewer's tip to spread softened butter on the inside rather than the melted butter.  I let them cool too long in the pan so i had to spread the sticky caramel on the buns; next time i will immediately turn them out onto a plate.  Otherwise, an excellent recipe!  My husband said that, along with the fried potatoes and scrambled eggs i made that morning, it was the best breakfast he'd ever had!

This was a really great recipe!  I am an intermediate bread maker and don't know a lot of 'tricks', and I found this to be really easy with great results!  I did not add pecans to the centre of the buns, just to the sugar/cinnamon mixture that lines the pan.  I cut the roll into 12 buns so that they would fit into the 9x13 pan easier.  These are best right out of the oven, but still good a few days later after a quick nuke.  I loved these!  (very high in calories, but worth it!)

My friend Melissa had the brilliant idea to bake them in muffin tins when my baking pan turned out to be too small.  You want to reduce baking time if you try this, though, as mine got a bit burnt.

OMG, if I could give this 10 stars, I would! ABSOLUTELY YUMMY! It took me all day, but it was well worth the wait! They only took 20 min. to cook in my oven. I agree with other reviewers that there needs to be more ooey gooey, so next time I will double that. I will be making this one again, and again! Thank you so much for the recipe!!

WOW!  I made these as a gift to a sick friend, as my boyfriend hates Cinnamon Rolls. I didn't double the filling or sugar mixture spread on the bottom of the pan, but increased the amounts to 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup. To my shock, my boyfriend came home just as I was taking them out of the oven, and he asked to try one, as they smelled so good.  He had a couple of bites, sat down and asked for a glass of milk ... and proceeded to eat TWO!  He then said he has never had anything so delicious!!!  I also took other reviewers' advice and only baked them for 20 minutes ... I am in the mountains, and usually have trouble with high altitude as regards baking, but these were great!  He just came in and said again, "Best I've ever eaten!"  Thanks so very much for a fabulous recipe!

I followed the recipe for the actual rolls themselves to a tee with the following exception: I used 3t active dry yeast (I'm always paranoid that my bread won't rise properly!). I completely omitted the "goo" at the bottom of the pan because organic butter (or even conventional butter for that matter) is so expensive. Lastly, I used the icing recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon for the icing just because I had already tried it and really liked it. I baked them at about 335 for about 18 minutes just to get a more even "doneness" and to make sure they didn't get too brown. Next time I will also take the advice of another reviewer and start the milk mixture before the yeast mixture as it saves a few minutes of waiting. The dough rose well for me (both rises). Next time, I will allow about 2.5 hours for the second rise to get a fluffier, lighter roll. My rolls could have stood some more rise time. I baked mine on a cookie sheet (separated) and then iced them immediately. I had been using the Clone recipe, but wasn't ever able to get the dough to rise hardly at all (I think because of the lack of instructions for those with no bread machine). This one worked out perfectly for me. Thanks for sharing this one! Kudos to you, Jen!

These are amazing!  Worth every minute of prep.  I think I'll double the recipe next time and freeze the rolls before the second rising. Highly recommend!

Absolutely Amazing!  This was my first time using yeast, and my buns turned out sooo scrumptious.  I doubled the recipe.  Based on other reviews, I made 1/3 more of the filling, and my results were very "ooey and gooey."  Also, I substituted raisins for the pecans, since I'm not a huge nut fan.  Overall, time consuming, but if you have the time, this is a great recipe to make it worthwhile.

This recipe is pretty good. I made it with rapid rise yeast, which cut down on the wait time. I did not do the gooey in the bottom of the pan. Instead i amped up the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp in the filling and added 1 c semisweet mini chocolate chips also to teh filling. I baked them in 2 9 inch glass pie plates for 19 minutes and served them warm as dessert. My guests were weeping with joy and begged to take some home. With the rapid rise be sure to follow instructions on the packet. My rise times were 10 minute for first rise and 30 for final rise.

These are awesome!  Not as much filling spread on as
the recipes I have used in the past, but the "goo" on
the bottom of the pan compensates for that.  I am making the dough in the bread machine...second batch in 3 days.

Mmmmmmm! I had mine cold and it was very good. The only thing that made it less satisfying was the "buttery" taste. Maybe next time I won't add the layer of butter and brown sugar at the bottom but instead make some icing for them. It was definately a fun activity!  Thanks a lot, Jen!:):D

This is definately NOT for un-seasoned cooks! It took me four hours; way more than the given time. I'm not a beginner (with no mother to fill in every now and then and other hungry mouths...not by far)but it was much too long to make. They were definately yummy,though!

These taste better than Cinnabun! I bake a lot for my husbands office and he was told that these were their FAVORITE! It does take quite a bit of work but well worth the time. I also topped them with the icing recipe from Clone of a Cinnabun. Thank you so much Jen for sharing a great recipe and my hushand thanks you also.

Yes! This recipie for Cinnamon Buns is sooo good. I've tried this one and the one for the Clone of a Cinnabon, and this one takes the cake! My family is constantly requesting that I make them. A little sticky to roll out, but other than that, a perfect 10!!!

Sooooo worth it. I ran out of brown sugar so I just used some molasses with white sugar and added a great flavor. I also made a cream cheese frosting to go on top for an extra gooeyness. I have no pictures because it was inhaled faster than I made it. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!!

These buns are incredible. My Grandma always made what we called "Sticky Rolls" every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  You had to snatch them quickly because they didn't last. These buns are in the same ballpark as those buns, but Grandma's were still better; her cinnamon/brown sugar/butter mixture solidified in places, which lent a candy like texture to the buns. But you can't go wrong with this recipe. Everyone will like them. The tip for cleanly cutting the buns with dental floss was spot on. It works like a charm. My late grandma--bless her soul--would get a big laugh if she knew I was bragging about her buns!

Super yummy.  Here are my modifications (thanks to other reviewers!):
1.  Lined pan with parchment - parchment was oversized so I flipped up the edges for the last 8 mins so none of the caramel would overflow. Also it made it easy to flip over into the same  pan - less clean up!

2.  Made them overnight so after the second proof, covered with plastic film and then with a dish towel and stuck it into the fridge. Brought back to room temperature.

3.  Instead of melting the butter, just softened it for 20 seconds in the microwave.  

4. Gave them an eggwash before putting them in the oven.

5.  Baked at 350°F for 20 mins and the turned up the heat to 375°F for the last 8 mins. Cooked through perfectly without over cooking the top (or is that the bottom?).

This was my 1st attempt at making Cinnamon rolls from scratch. I am very glad that I tried it. Do yourself a huge favor and use the video. If I had tried to use just the recipe, I would have not been successful.

These are wonderful. I made a few mods to fit my taste. For example, if you like Cinnamon,  you will probably be a bit disappointed with the recipe as is. I added about a 1/4 cup of Cinnamon to the topping. The recipe calls none. I love Cinnamon so you will have to adjust based on how much you like. I also added some Ginger and Cloves for an extra kick.

I also added 8 ounces of Cream Cheese to the topping because, I thought as is, it sounded bland. I am very glad I added all this, because they turned out great. For me, the sweetness came out just right, so this will also depend how much sweetness you like.

I have been making this exact recipe for 30 years, every year for Christmas breakfast. After making the rolls and they are in the pan, I cover tightly with plastic wrap and foil. Christmas Eve day, put into your refridgerator until Christmas morning. Pop into the oven while everyone is opening gifts and afterwards have this delicious treat! This is my children's favorite holiday tradition and now my adult daughter makes them with me. These are delicious and so easy once you've done it once or twice (or more than 30, lol) The hardest part about making these is all of the requests from family and friends to make them some, which then ends up being a quadruple batch or more :)

These cinnamon rolls  turned out great  I would recommend this recipe. I would suggest to put the cinnamon rolls into two  9 inch circular pans instead of the rectangular pan. For the sugar-cinnamon  filling I wouldn’t make to much because afterwards you have a ton leftover.

I have thought for years to submit this recipe. I first made it in the early 90's while on a ski vacation in Colorado for  family and friends. While sitting around talking, waiting for the buns to cool someone realized that the dog had jumped  up and was pulling the buns off the counter. Motivated  defenders saved the buns. They take a couple of hours to make but it is so worthwhile. I don't remember where my recipe came from but this one is exactly the same. Best Sticky Bun I have ever tasted. 
Thankyou for posting. Dave

I used all pecans on the bottom and rolled up  craisins in the middle. I made 1 1/4 cup brown sugar and butter as per others suggestions. After initial baking for twenty minutes and it looked a lovely brown. After flipping it over to my other pan I didn't think the dough looked thouroughly done so I popped it back in the oven in that pan for another five minutes. Came out fine though I did drain the carmel from the pan and poured it over the top. The guys loved it. I added the craisins at my son's request and made a cream cheese frosting to satisify my other half.

AMAZING!I can't believe I made these!  I didn't have pecans so instead I used walnuts and were great!  

I used prepared frozen bread dough that you find in the frozen food section, mine was Shurefine. I used   1   1/2 bread doughs and let it thaw overnight in a covered, sprayed bowl (Syran wrap) to do in the morning.  I punched downed and rolled it out in the morning.  This is a great shortcut if you don't want to make your own dough.  :)

I give this 5 star recipe a 4. Honestly this needs to be cooked at a lower temperature for like an additional  5 or 10 minutes longer. Reason being was I took heed to a warning from another person who made this and lowered my oven racks. But all the butter had spattered all over almost smoking to the point of burning and it happened with in a matter of seconds. Its not like I put it in the oven and drove to the store. So, my Cinnamon Buns tasted like burn and I did finished them because I really don't like to waste food. So, lesson for me #1 lower the racks, #2 lower the temp and #3 longer time. That is all.

The bread base of the cinnamon rolls was soft and delicious.  I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the bottom mixture, but regretted it; I could hardly taste the cinnamon at  all (even though I increased it), and mostly I just tasted supersweet caramel.  I'd recommend just following the recipe on that one, but definitely double the cinnamon! :-)

In step 4 I increased the amount of butter and brown sugar both to 1 1/4 cups after seeing this suggestion on some reviews. Another awesome tip from the reviews was to use dental floss to cut the rolls from the log, worked like magic. I cooked the rolls for exactly 25 minutes. They turned out so good!! This is now my go to cinnamon roll recipe.

I wouldn’t say best I ever had in my life, but for homeade they were a hit with the family. I made sure to buy a fresh packet of the yeast for another Allrecipes recipe I made sticky buns the yeast was nearing the end date. Very elaborate steps to make, but worth it in the end. I baked for 20 mins and then last 10 put foil over it so it wouldn’t burn. I wish there was more ooey goey stuff, but overall very good.

I have made a few changes, as my mom is a cook and thus was able to help: 
- For the milk, I used half and half. 
- If making a double recipe: 3 tbsp. ground cinnamon for the filling. For the glaze: 2 cups brown sugar and 2 cups butter. 
-Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until golden brown (start at 25 minutes and check).

I've made it several times, each time improving. Will continue to make as they are delicious when done correctly.

Turned out FANTASTIC! I let the dough rise in the oven with the light on for about an hour and a half. Then after rolling I let them rise a second time for about 2 hours. The rolls turned out so soft and tasty. I will probably make 1.5 batches of the caramel next time for the bottom. I will also use more cinnamon and more pecans. I'm so impressed.

Loved it! Made only one minor adjustment - added 1 tsp almond extract to dough to give just a hint of nutty flavor. I do that frequently with sweet breads. Took about 4 hours from start to warm yummy gooey cinnamon rolls. My tip would be to roll your dough as even as possible. Otherwise you have fatter rolls towards the middle. Even a little extra height in the dough  adds up when rolled. Definitely use the floss to cut rolls.

This is an excellent recipe! Hard to mess up if you follow the directions, it's great for someone whose never made cinnamon buns before. It doesn't need a glaze or icing; perfect to serve as is (or warm it up beforehand which makes it absolutely brilliant).At the end, make sure to scrape that little extra bit of the sticky mixture out of the pan. Remember to roll the dough into a rectangle, not an oval, to get evenly sized rolls.

The absolute best! I don't know which came first, but this is exactly the same recipe  as in the Canadian Living's Bread and Pizza book.

I make my dough in a bread machine. If you want to do this, add the dry ingredients to the baking pan first, followed by the milk and eggs. My bread maker has a separate compartment for yeast and dispenses automatically. If yours does not have a yeast compartment, just add the yeast last.
Prep the filling while the bread maker does it's thing.

The bread maker mixes everything and does the first rise.
Then follow the recipe from "Punch down the dough...".

Works perfectly every time!

My family enjoyed these very much.  The dough was easy to work with, and produced a lovely bread. Since my oven runs hot, I lowered the oven temperature to 350.  I also added a little extra brown sugar and a Karo corn syrup to my topping.  I will definitely make these again.

These are insanely good.  I made the dough in my bread machine.  Put in two 9" glass pans, didn't double topping and it was plenty.  Froze one pan unbaked and unrisen, going to enjoy them this weekend.  Just thaw in fridge or on counter overnight and bake as usual.  Also, I baked at 350.

Made as per the recipe only omitting the nuts a personal preference.  I used softened butter instead of melted after the dough was rolled out and made a good "coat" of it, mmmmm, butter. Other than that it is very straightforward and easy. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe... I agree a little extra caramel is always good, once it's off the heat I add 1tsp vanilla essence, it flares up so let it cool a bit first.... I also add 1/2 tsp of Allspice along with the Cinnamon and as others have said, spread softened butter on the dough rather than melted. 23 minutes was plenty cooking time on 375.. Perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

You must carefully follow the recipe if you do you will have great success with this.  It takes a long time to make but it is well worth it.  Our family twist is to NOT flip the rolls out of the pan when they are done.  Instead I leave the rolls in the  9x13 pan and make a second batch of the yummy gooey topping and spread it the top of the rolls.  Decedent !

I followed he directions carefully but increased the rise time by 30 minutes once they were in the pan. I also added a 1/2 cup raisins. They were spectacular hot out of the oven but even the next day they were great.

Fantastic recipe! You could also replace the milk with unsweetened almond milk to give it a more earthy/nutty flavor, and each egg with 1/4 cup of apple sauce per egg. I tried using both substitutions (due to no eggs or milk in the house at the time) and they came out absolutely fantastic. Moist, fluffy, and full of awesome flavors.

Tasty recipe. There wasn't nearly enough ooey gooey as mentioned by other reviewers. Next time I will add additional sugar/butter mixture on top of the buns before putting them in the oven. I also added raisins to the recipe. Turned out great, but needed more sauce!

Great recipe I have made this 4 times already and will making it again soon for sure, for the caramel sauce I suggest melting the butter and sugar in saucepan until it bubbles you can also add about 3-4 tbls milk. You definitely need more cinnamon, I normally put 2 to 3 tablespoon. I roll mine bigger and slice it about 22 pieces so it can fit 2x 9" round pan.

Substituted whey for the water. The dough expanded a lot for me after the first rising so I only waited 30 minutes for the second rising. Next time I will definitely but in my lasagna pan because these buns get pretty big. I had to put 12 in the 9x13 pan and remaining 3 in a bread loaf pan. Other than that, absolutely delicious and gooey.

Excellent. I used the dental floss trick I read on a previous review and it worked great. Took 22 minutes at 375 in my oven.

I am a novice when it comes to working with yeast and this was only the 4th or 5th I've tried.  Followed this recipe to the letter except I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on top at the end (only had a few sprinkles left to use up in the jar and figured it couldn't hurt...it didn't)
We made these the night before and left them in the fridge.  Took them out to warm and rise about 2 hours before putting them in the oven.  Honestly the most amazing sticky rolls I've ever had!  
My 7 year old said "This is the best thing that ever happened to me!"  My 8 year old has been BEGGING for more since breakfast.  And my 5 year old at a huge roll without saying anything...which is huge as she complains about EVERYTHING I make!  
Awesome recipe and will definitely be trying again and again!

My dough didn't come together at all it turned into flaky bits, I followed it exact to the directions and twice it did the same thing. I think that it is calling for too much flour for the amount of liquid you have... that or the recipe is not explaining how to combined it properly.

I was really hopeful of this recipe based on reviews. They turned out good just not great. I love to cinnamon rolls to have flavor all around each layer in the bun itself. The only parts that had the most flavor were the inside parts. I think I can make it perfect next time though. It also needs a glaze which is also really easy to make. Here is what I'd do differently. 1. I'd put the brown sugar mix on top of the the whole dough from edge to edge that way I'm not wasting any dough. 2. I'd double the mixture that goes on the bottom of the pan and put that second mix on top of the cinamon rolls when theirs 5mins of baking left. 3. I'd make a glaze. That way you get flavor through and through. I will say that the good thing about these rolls were that they were pretty buttery and moist. But then again that might've been due only to me laying a layer of butter on top the last 10mins of baking because I was afraid of having a crunchy and dry top. I also took these out at 15-20mins. They were stil cooked all the way through.

My family loved these.  We ate two each right off the bat, but my tummy wished I'd only had one, what with all the dough and sweetness.  This recipe was fairly simple and fun too, but a long haul, what with having to rise the dough for a total of two hours.  If you need cinnamon rolls, and you need them now (!), then a recipe without yeast will satisfy sooner.  But if you want the real, ooey-gooey thing, then take the time with the dough as required.  I had left over melted butter in the end as using two whole tablespoons on the outside of the roll prior to baking was not needed, nor stuck to the roll.  I agree with MNDiana, who suggests brushing on softened butter, rather than melted butter, and will try that next time.  I used walnuts and raisins instead of pecans, and found the 375 temp a little too high as my outside rolls got a little too brown and crusty in just 22 minutes, but the inside rolls were perfect.  Lastly, the filling on the bottom of the pan cools to a candy-like state quickly and is hard to remove from pan onto the top of rolls after baking without it being clumpy, so make sure to tip them out onto another dish (after loosening the edges with a butter knife) after just a minute after removing from oven, and leave the tray upside down for a couple more minutes to let the filling fall onto the buns.  This will coat the buns evenly and prevent it from hardening onto the bottom of the pan before you can scrape it all off onto the buns! Merry Munching!

The only thing that wasn't exactly as expected was the gooey topping -instead of a gooey sugary topping, it became a caramel topping (that even hardens like a Halloween candy anywhere that pooling has occurred, though a quick microwave loosens it up again). 

The dominant caramel flavor was not what I was expecting, though from several other comments mentioning it this seems to be what others sought, so I assume I did follow the directions correctly (I went over them thinking I must have done something wrong, but it seems that I did everything exactly as expected).

The rolls were simple perfection. I will just try to adapt this for a non-caramel topping next time.

My husband has talked about his mother's cinnamon buns for years. She passed away long before I met him, so I've been trying to find a recipe that matches his childhood memory. This recipe is spot on. I make some cream cheese icing on the side because I prefer it and he's happy without. This is a great recipe. Going to make some tonight.

I've tried this recipe twice now. I think the results would be a bit more consistent with a weight-based recipe and not a volumetric recipe (especially relevant to us in countries where metric measurements are used) - and after making the necessary conversions, it was much better the second time around. The dough makes for a very nice, fluffy, squishy, soft bun, and in general this recipe provides just enough sweetness. Do use demerara/turbinado for the sauce in the bottom - great caramel!

Love this recipe! Worth the time to try this one. Only made a few changes as suggested by others to double the amount of sugar and butter for the bottom of the pan, and I let the dough rise for 2-3 hours initally, and pre cooking I like to let them rise for a minimum of 6 hours, or over night! So light and fluffy!

This is  the best cinnamon bun recipes I have ever made. I tried to make it in a kitchen aid mixer and it came out horrible so I decided to knead the rock hard dough myself. After adding cups of oil and destroying my hands I was finally able to soften it up. I also ruined the mixer and it let out a horrible smell.When I rolled the dough out it was so soft and nice, i guess it was trying to say after what pain and mess it caused. Anyways instead of making fifteen rolls I made about thirty. I rolled it out really long and cut it smaller. When me and my family sat down to eat it tasted delicious. I'm only thirteen so it was really hard for me but the taste payed back.

These cinnamon rolls were absolutely the best I've ever had. I found it rather difficult to roll them and think I will refrigerate for an hour or so before trying to slice next time. But all in all, a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

It was alright!  The dough is dry and I didn't really like how the caramel turned out.  For sticky buns, I would make an easier version of this using puff pastry like ina gartens.  Maybe we're just not a sticky bun type....

AWESOME!!! Adding my own touches to this recipe. I used my mixer stand with the dough attachment to elimate kneading the dough for 6 to 7 minutes. I also doubled the caramel. I did not melt my butter, I used soften butter, spread it on the rolled out dough before the brown sugar, cinnamon & pecan mixture. Rolled the mixture with the rolling pin to stay put on the dough. Then used thread to make precise cuts. Best served Warm. Husband LOVES it warm and gooey.

I just made for the second time and they came out better. The first time i made it exactly like the recipe is written, the second time i tweaked a bit. I add more of the sauce that goes under the cinnamon buns, and i also add a bit of salt, vanilla to the sauce. The salt makes a big difference, it makes the flavors pop. I also add more cinnamon and sugar to the filling. What really helped them come out moist is that i let them rise for a longer time and I put them to rise in a warm oven. I would turn on the oven for a minute and then turn it off real quick. I did have a thermometer inside the oven to monitor the heat because the yeast dies at 140 degrees, I never let it get past 125 degrees.This is definetly one I will be making over and over again. Love them.

I have tried a number of cinnamon roll recipes and this is the best of the bunch!

Rather than pour the sugar/butter/pecan mix directly on the bottom of the pan I first placed parchment paper on the pan and then added the mixture. When I inverted the pan and pulled off the paper almost every bit of the sticky goodness was on the top of the rolls and the pan was spotless.

This recipe creates a wonderful soft, moist, but not doughy middle. Not sure how some managed to get dry rolls out of this! Maybe over-baking?

Wonderful recipe!  I actually got everything together the night before and put it all in the baking 13x9 and put them in the fridge overnight.  I let them thaw out for about 30 minutes and then baked them in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes and they were perfect!

I made this in a non-dairy version using rice milk and margarine instead of milk and butter. 
I made it in a 9x13 pan and poured on extra brown sugar and margarine before baking.

Came out delicious!!!!!

Made this 21 hours ago, there were 15 buns, 5 people at home - there is 1 left!!  Unanimous -  they are fabulous! Like others I tweaked a little - left out nuts and raisins and increased cinnamon to a tablespoon; substituted soy milk for milk and margarine for butter. Used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. Family wants to know when I'm making the next batch!

I started making these around 12:30am this morning.  I fell asleep while the dough was rising, so the dough got to rise for 5 hours.  The kids and my wife loved them.  My wife said the buns were very tender.  Kids don't like pecans so I used cashews and peanuts.  Didn't roll nuts into the dough, just added 1/2 cup to the pan.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but there was just the right amount of sweetness.

These are fantastic!  Followed someone else's directions to make sure and cook the butter and brown sugar for the topping until it carmalizes.  They are very rich and sweet so I will only be making them on special occasions from now on.

The dough turned out awesome and was easy to make. But I was slightly dissapointed with the final result, they were good, but not incredible. Takes along time so you do want incredible when your finished. :-) Maybe cinnamon buns do need an icing, as this topping just didnt go the extra mile.

These are, hands down, the BEST cinnamon rolls my family has ever eaten! I added (by mistake) a full cup of brown sugar to the topping, and it was amazing. Gooey goodness...I had to share them with my neighbors!

Sinfully good!  Made these for my husband and brother-in-law after a long camping trip, and they kept asking for more!  I altered the recipe a bit by using golden raisins and sliced almonds in the filling and on top.  Will make again for overnight guests!

WOW. This recipe was really time consuming, which is why I can't give it 5 stars. But it was worth the time I spent this morning. They were delicious! The only real problem I had was that I used a full sized cookie sheet, not the smaller pan dimensions suggested, and the buns fit just perfectly packed in right next to each other, but the sheet overflowed into the oven and instead of a nice, yummy cinnamon bun scent in the air, I got a burning smell and smoke :/ Probably I need to get a big baking pan. Despite the overflow issue, the buns came out fine in the end. My husband and brother in law gobbled up 2 each! I'm sure we'll have them again for dessert tonight, and breakfast again tomorrow morning... Definitely I will try this recipe again in the future.

Amazing :) My only critic is that these belong in a bigger pan than 9x13!! It is way too small and the rolls end up squished. I stole a few suggestions from others, such as: to cut the rolls without mashing the dough take a piece of thread, slide it under the roll, cross the thread and pull quickly. For the sauce I used 1 1/4 cup of butter with 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the 3/4s of each that is suggested. And I did not melt the butter that you spread on the inside of the dough, I just used extremely soft butter and rubbed that onto the dough with my hands which made the filling alot more ooey gooey. :) But still an amazing recipe.

These were fantastic and I only added a extra teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe.  After 45 min. the dough was not rising as much as it should so I took someone elses advice and preheated the oven to 200 and then shut it off and placed the dough in for another 20 min.  I used dental floss to cut the roll slices and it worked perfect! On the second rise I set it in the oven right away for an hour. Only baked for 18 min. and they came out perfect,  everyone loved these.

This was my FIRST attempt ever at making cinnamon buns and they were a big hit! I took them to work and they didn't last long. The only problem that I had was that the cinnamon didn't seem to stick much inside the swirl. I probably didn't roll them tight enough. I'll definitely be making these again!

BIG 5 stars. Just like my grandma's! I have been looking for a recipe for years that matched her's. I creamed the brown sugar and butter together then spread it on the rolled-out dough. Perfect. Not dry at all. I also left these in the fridge, soaking in the caramel for about 18 hours...was going to bake them for breakfast, but went out instead ;) I was nervous they would be soggy, but they were awesome! Will never make another cinnamon roll recipe.

These are great! i had a snow day and felt like experimenting, and they came out really well. The only thing i had trouble with was some of the directions weren't very clear and i had to shorten the cooking time as they started crisping on top a few minutes early. Otherwise, this recipe was great and i'll use it again

I absolutely love this recipe. For the very first time, I made cinnamon buns last night and they were spectacular. The only thing I changed were the pecans. I didn't have any, so I used walnuts. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

These were good. I would say awesome for my first attempt at something like this. It did seem to take all day to prepare these. I think I maybe didn't cook the sugar mixture on the stove long enough? because the glaze was very gritty. But they tasted great!

These cinnamon buns were excellent right out of the oven and I got rave reviews from the people I shared brunch with that morning.  However, later that day they were like a brick.  The only saving grace was the microwave to soften them again.  For the amount of time it took to make them and the short amount of time they were actually good, it was not worth it.  Next time I use this recipe I will only bake 6 at a time to save on the waste, I threw away half the batch.

These were so easy, and so delish.  The only thing I did different was added some mini chocolate chips.  Yummo!!! Made them the night before, so they were ready to bake on Christmas morning.  Our new family tradition.

I just want to say, I followed this recipe to a T, and it was AMAZING. I feel sorry for my sick wife though, she had a stuffy nose and cant smell or taste right now. A little tid bit of info, make sure to whip the butter and brown sugar that is going into the bottom of the pan to make sure it mixes all the way. Also, adding a little white frosting after flipped is a definite plus. Enjoy this one, I know my family(minus wife) sure is!

I made these today, and REALLY wish my yeast would have performed like it should have! :(  I live in a teeny, tiny little town on an island off of Panama...and even though I bought the yeast today - it doesn't necessarily mean that it's still good!!  I'll be sure to check the expiry then next time!  I'm giving it a 5 star rating because if the dough would have risen - they would have been AWESOME! Thanks, and I can't wait to make them again....with non-expired yeast!  :)

Fabulous recipe. I did as previous posts state, allow dough to rise 2 hours instead of 1, spread soft butter on dough instead of melted before rolling, use dental floss to cut dough,  and cut baking time down to 18-20 minutes. Next time I will bake in a larger pan. This is the first time that I have made CinnBuns from scratch, fairly easy. I will make again soon!

Delicious...a bit time consuming but worth it.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and added about a cup of raisins to the inside mix.

This is a GREAT recipe. The dough came out so light and fluffy I couldn't even believe I had made it! I definitely recommend letting it have the full time to rise, both times. Don't cut those times short just because you're in a rush.  I did have problems with the caramel on the bottom of the pan. It came out tasting good, but on cooling it immediately became like hard candy. We had to take it off the buns in order to eat them.

SSoooo yummy.  Reminds me of PA Dutch sticky buns growing up.  Followed recipe minus nuts.  I didn't see the issue with the melted butter?  Used floss to cut and when done I turned them out onto Reynolds non stick foil.  I can't wait to make them for the in-laws over Thanksgiving!  Cheers!

This was my first time baking with yeast.  It took ages, but these turned out great.  The flavor was quite mild and sweet; I think I'll add more cinnamon next time.  The dough was really sticky and I had to add quite a bit of flour to knead it. Also mine were ready at 20 minutes; any longer and they would have burned.  They look perfect though, and they slipped right out of the pan without sticking.

These were not at all what i was expecting!  I really wanted a recipe that had the dough like a bread and it would melt in your mouth.  Instead, I got a roll that is LOADED with sugar and do not melt in the mouth.  Wish I could find a great recipe!  Will keep looking!

These buns tasted so good.  They came out so thick and the top part was dry.  Maybe I should cut it thinner next time and bake less time.  I need to try again very soon.

This is the best dough that I have ever worked with.  It rolled out so easy that I knew it would be something special to eat & it was.  Light & tasty these were fabulous.  I had to go out for a bit while they rose & my husband was supposed to watch them & put them in the oven when they were ready.  Of course he forgot.  When I got home 3 hours later they were filling the pan nicely.  Popped them in the oven and they turned out wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

OMG, these are absolutely the best tasting cinnamon buns.  The only thing I changed in the recipe is that I left out the pecans.  They were delicious!  I used the cinnamon bun icing recipe from the website.  I cut it in half though and I had leftover icing.  Will definitely make these again!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I also doubled the caramel topping, and the rising time both the first and second times around.  They may be a coronary on a plate, with all that butter, but they are undeniably delicious!

This was my first time making homemade cinnamon rolls. They turned out so good. I followed the recipe except for a couple small changes. Instead of melting the butter, I just spread softened butter on the rolled out dough. Also, I baked it a little less and it was cooked through perfectly. I used walnuts instead of pecans and I added raisins. I had a very happy hubby with these ones!

today I made these buns and had a problem. I followed some of the tips like adding the extra butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan...WELL ...I ended up with rock hard candy bits all over the buns. However the buns taste great. I had to chip away the hard bits...I will have to try these again. If anyone has any idea why this happened I would be thankful to hear from you

Great recipe... :) inside of rolling these into traditional cinnamon rolls, i made "cinnamon holes".. The middle is always the best part isn't it? Well the way i made them each bite was like eating the middle piece.   Instead of filling the dough after rolling it out, i cut little squares out and put 6 pieces into the bottom of a muffin tin, then layered on some of the filling, a few chopped pecans, then layered again 7 more dough squares and poured some more filling on top with more pecans and then let rise as usual and baking time differed just a little,.. i kept an eye on them so they wouldn't over cook.. BUT YUMM-O! and not much more effort to make these even better than they already were. :)

These are amazing. I made them yesterday and I already have to make another one. The only thing I changed was instead of 3/4 C of brown sugar and butter was too much. Instead I use a 1/2 C each and they were perfect

Delicious! I made them exactly per the directions and they came out perfectly. Oh, but they only needed cooked 20 minutes, but I think my oven is a bit hinky. I thought everything was in perfect proportion and they weren't dry at all. Oh, and I used the thread trick for cutting them, this made it so easy and didn't squish them at all!

These sounded tempting & since I have a son who loves cinnamon rolls, I thought I would give this recipe a shot. After reading many of the reviews, I thought I needed to make a little extra caramel sauce for the bottom so I increase the butter and sugar just a tad.  The sweetness was overpowering.  We couldn't enjoy the rolls because of the rich topping.  I guess if you're not looking for an incredibly rich topping, don't increase the ingredients.I was under the impression it wouldn't be enough coating.  I am sure we would have enjoyed it more, if I had stuck with the original recipe.  Too much of a good thing is distracts from the roll itself.  If I brave the process again, I will make it according the recipe.

Oh my gosh these are so good. I can't believe I made them. I added raisins with the pecans and brown sugar for the middle and added a few dashes of cinnamon to the butter and brown sugar mixture for the bottom of the pan. These are heavenly!

Love the recipe! The glaze at the bottom turned out perfectly! Very gooey but not too much, it was great. I didn't add the pecans. I used cinnamon sugar in the seasoning bottle instead of just cinnamon. I also put on some caramel on top of them before putting them into the oven. After they were cooked I added some more caramel on top for presentation and it was gooey and tasted awesome. My boyfriend who's a food critic LOVED them and I do too. Will make again when his family comes down!!

I made these years ago for my husband to take to work.  You know the recipe is good when your husband tells you the guys were taking spoons to the dish because there were no more!  In recent years I have made them with wheat flour and splenda for baking and they come out just as great.  An absolute favorite.

I usually don't like cinnamon buns, but these are super great. My kids and husband loves when I make them. Great recipe.

i did this recipe as indicated with the difference of the amounts on the filling. I used 2 TBS of butter which i brushed onto the dough sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon (about 1/3 cup) and added the pecans. I substituted 2 cups of bread flour for 2 cups of wheat flour and added a little more liquid. Everyone loved them.

So it delivered on the "gooey" part, although the syrup candied some in my metal pan despite the shorter 18 min. baking time. Too much butter for me.  I like a sticky bun you lick your fingers after but don't necessarily have to wash your hands!  I made a different sticky bun before which I have to find again...

First and foremost I am not a baker...I cannot bake anything.  These came out pretty good...The Ooey Gooey part was a little bit crunchy for me so I threw it back in the oven OG side up for about 5 minutes on 400 degrees and it melted the brown sugar a little better. I will put more butter on the inside next time before I roll as they were a little dry. I ttakes a long time to make so I would reccomend thatyou do your dough the night before if you plan to have this for breakfast.

These are the best. Followed the recipe to a T. I can't make them often enough. They don't last long. My mother in law thought I should give our local bakery the recipe.

This is the best cinnamon buns i have ever made, the dough was so soft and a delight to work with. I will definitely be making this again and suggesting it to all my friend and family. It was a big hit my husband and kids loved it.

Watch out for the sugar coma that will surely come after eating these absolutely delicious cinnamon buns.  I made them for my husband for Easter and he was blown away.  He said they are by far the best cinnamon buns he has ever had... and he has had many!!  I never dreamed I could make professional bakery style buns like this... thanks for a great recipe!

These are the best I have ever made. I too made a couple of changes. I used soft margarine to spread on it and then put the brown sugar on and sprinkled some cinnamon. I also used raisons rolled into them instead of the pecans. Next time I will have to buy pecans and give it a try. My whole family loved them!!

Yummy, Yummy!  I can't believe I made cinnamon buns this delicious in my own house.  They were great even when they were a couple days old.  I just zapped them with 15 seconds in the microwave and another dab of butter. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  I look forward to making them again.  Next time I want to try adding some raisins.

Wow. I have tried several recipes from this website but this has to be the best. This recipe really deserves great reviews. Only changes was that i may have added slightly more sugar and then I did a butter frosting but otherwise everything was the same. I never made cinnamon buns before but Im soo happy I tried this. I was really amazed by the great texture and authentic flavor. Only thing is maybe next time I will do like other reviewer suggested and not add melted butter to the dough but just spread butter onto it. Some of the sugar was a little grainy. GREAT RECIPE ! do try!!!

great recipe!  i made a few changes.  the first batch came out a teensy bit dry.  for the second batch i used more butter on the outside before i baked. then half way through the baking time i took them out and brushed more butter on them. also i forgot to use unsalted butter...make sure you do or they will turn out a tiny bit salty.  i work at a coffee house in hawaii and i made them to sell and they sold within an hour!!   i will use this recipe again! thanks so much!

This is by far the best recipe I've tried for cinnamon buns.  No need for icing because of the brown sugar-butter topping.  I use whatever nuts I have available and the buns are always good.  My family loves these and so do I.  I follow the recipe exactly (except for the type of nuts) and have no desire to change anything else.

This was the first time I EVER made cinnamon rolls and to say i was a little intimidated is an understatement, but after reading all these great reviews I simply HAD to try them!!  They were not as hard to make as i thought they would be!!  They made my entire house smell like a bakery!  I took them to a friends house and let everyone there try them!!  One man ate 4 of them!!  They were all gone in a matter of minutes!!  They told me I missed my calling and i needed to make a livin out of making cinnamon rolls!!  I will definately be making these again and again!!  I already have orders for Christmas!!  Now I just need to figure out a way to freeze them!!

Awesome! I'm very picky with sticky buns...and these we near perfect. Next time I will add an addition 1/2 cup - 1 cup of sugar to the dough and use a bit more cinnamon in the filling!

This was my first attempt at making cinnamon buns and I thought the process was actually going to take longer and be much more involved than it actually was. They came out wonderful and everyone still talks about them. Definitely delicious!!

Absolutely love these. I'm not a fan of pecans so I used old-fashion oats instead. Used double of what is asked for of the oats and added some on the inside. Came out  perfect with a great topping. Didn't need to make an icing.

I must have done something wrong with this recipe! I used one packet of yeast, which was measured in grams, not in ounces. But my dough NEVER rose! So, I pretty much ended up with small, dense, hard little dough things swimming in sauce (which was really good sauce). But I would really like to know what i did wrong, since this recipe took alot of time and ingredients...I had also made the "Cinnamon Bun Icing" recipe and that was FANTASTIC! Since i won't be putting the icing on the buns, I will be making chocolate cupcakes and putting the icing on them! MMMmmm...

Wow, this was great.  The changes I made was to replace 1/2 c of the flour with wheat flour and also replace another 1/2 c with wheat germ just to make it a bit more healthy.  I only used 1/2 c of butter in the dough mixture.  I also spread softened butter onto the dough before rolling it up instead of melted butter.  I only let it rise for 30 minutes on the second rising and then baked.  Terrific!!

Delish!  The caramel on the bottom was the best part.  It was kind of complicated to make and I think I dirtied just about every dish, pot and surface in my kitchen, but they came out picture perfect.  I didn't use any fancy rolling technique, just rolled em and sliced em with hand quilting thread. These tasted so much like a Cinnabon that I craved a cream cheese frosting to go with them.

Very light and fluffy and yummy! I read the other reviews, and made the "stuff" for the bottom more than the recipe called for. These completely satisfied my pregnant craving for Sticky Buns!!

I sometimes let the dough rise twice before cutting it and I get a good fluffy, light bun. Sometimes I want a little more dense and one rising (before they're cut) is fine. I add different things like vanilla or orange peel or a little rum to the batter for different flavor. These buns are becoming a Christmas morning tradition.

I made these for my staff team and work, and even though they all claimed they were on a diet, they ate them all up. Probably would have even licked the plate if I had let them!
They are pretty time consuming, so don't make them if you're in a big rush.

These were amazing! I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, which made them heavier, but that was just what I was looking for before a day of hiking.

Delicious!  I made these as close to sugarfree as possible by substituting Splenda sweetner with the white sugar and Splenda's Brown Sugar Blend with the brown sugar.  The only real sugar I used was in preparing the yeast.  The cinnamon rolls came out delicous!

I made this recipe exactly today and I loved it!  The only change I made was to make 1 1/2 times the amount of syrup for the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise I followed it to the letter.  The dough is easy to work with and the end flavor of the rolls is just right.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This were pretty good- best right when they come out of the oven because they are REALLY gooey!  I added about 2 tbs more butter to brush on the top.  I also made a vanilla frosting to put on them after they came out of the oven.  I rated it a 4/5 because the cooking time is off- or at least for higher altitudes.  I baked them at 365 (instead of 375) for 21 minutes and they were pretty brown on top!  Bummer....after all that hard work.  They turned out very tasty still- I caught them before they burnt!
I'll make them again :)

These are the best I think! I didn't add the gooey  mixture or pecans and used whole wheat flour. They still came out perfect better then the store and bakery. If you wish to indulge make the mixture but I find whole wheat works nicely and adds fiber. My dad asked me why they tasted so proffesional. I told him i used a different recipe and he told me to keep it!

The only change I made was to substitute walnuts for pecans, because that's what I had at home.
A quote from my dad: "These might be the best sticky buns I've ever eaten."  I think that says it all. ;)

Fantastic recipe! I misread the recipe and wrapped the buns with the melted brown sugar and butter sauce instead of the brown sugar, pecans and cinnamon mix. Then I dusted a layer of cinnamon on top before baking. Surprisingly, these buns turned out wonderfully! The buns have a slightly crunchy crust and a feathery soft interior. Will make this again.

These were good. But they do get hard quickly. The temperature of the oven is too hot in think it should only be 350 degrees until golden brown.

This recipe is great.  I would like to try putting the dough in the freezer overnight, then cooking in the morning.  I am just not sure when to freeze it ... maybe after the second rising.

These were delicious. My sister and I made them for Mother's Day, and we had a lot of fun baking them. We dolloped them with a cream-cheese icing, which really pulled it together! However, they do get very hard after they're cooled, but they soften right up if you microwave them. They were very good, but only worth the time if you enjoy baking (which I love, so I was happy!)

These were AMAZING! I didnt double the filling and topping as suggested and don't think I will ever try because they were sweet, and gooey and perfect after following the recipe as written. They were so delicious that my boyfriend finshed them off and had me make a second batch the following week!

DELICIOUS!!  I made a wee mistake and after melting my butter for the goo, I added the brown sugar and cooked it for a bit, which made the whole thing really thick.  DO NOT cook the goo :)  Second time around was perfect, but I will double the goo next time!

Excellent Recipe!  Delicious!  I didn't change a thing except I didn't invert the rolls out of the pan at the end. I just left the rolls in the pan.  The only problem I had was that it took much longer for the rolls to rise, but definitely worth the wait.  Made the night before and rewarmed them in the morning.  Thanks for a great recipe!

You can't buy better cinnamon buns. These are to die for. I don't bake them as long, only for about 20 mins or just until they start to change colour to prevent them from getting hard the next day.  I also use the "cinnamon bun icing" found on this site. Thank you!!!

"Mama Mia"!! Superb!! What more can I say but these are the absolute best I've ever had...just finished eating them. Family loves them! The kinda bun that makes you close your eyes when you eat it and then find yourself making strange moaning noises..lol ..Truly! I'd give 10 stars...Thankyou Jen!!! p.s. I only let them sit for 5 min. after I rolled and still came out perfect.

Simply Amazing! The "goo" carmalizes to produce a delicious caramel taste! You most certainly want to double the gooey topping portion of the recipe!! We doubled it and had just enough to cover all the cinnamon buns. Also, if you like the taste of cinnamon in your sticky buns, add more to both the filling and the topping. EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!

Fantastic!  My husband said these were absolutely 5/5!  I have made cinnamon buns before with a bread maker, but this was my first time from scratch.  They turned out beautifully!  The only change that I made was to reduce the cooking time like many others recommended.  I also made them smaller so instead of yielding 15, I made 28.  This is a super recipe, thanks!

These are awesome! I took the other reviewers advice and added to the goo part of the recipe.  I upped the butter/sugar mix to 1 cup for the bottom of the pan.  I then used a full cup of sugar to roll into the dough.  I added some extra  cinnamon too.  I didn't add pecans because I don't like them and I didn't have any raisins.  So I just left that part out completely.  These are terrific!  They are a lot of work but they are worth it!!

My Family and friends absolutely fell in love with this recipe.  Since I printed this about 2 months ago, I have made 6 batches. A new addition just made them even better.  I found a Vanilla Powder on the net @ Cooksvanilla.com.  I aad 1 1/2 tsp to each of the brown sugar mixtures. WOW were they great.  Everyone raved over the great vanilla taste it added.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would! After I made these, everyone raved...family members begged me to make them more often, and relatives asked for the recipe! I have been told these are right up there with Cinnabon brand cinnamon buns :-D

Follow the directions EXACTLY! They are the best cinnamon buns ever.

This recipe should be called perfection. I wish I would have found it long before I tried so many that did not come out right.. My boyfriend was in heaven and he is quite the connoisseur. They are as good as cinnabon. They just came out so perfect. I made the cinnabon frosting. We were just very happy with this recipe. Thanks

MMmmmmm delicious!  I made these for my mom on mother's day, it was my first try at making pastry of any kind, and they turned out great!  I took some of the comments in mind and reduced both the cooking temperature and cooking time by a little bit, and I added about 30% more of everything that goes into the 'goo', this way it did not go hard like some of the other reviews had mentioned.

Just made these DELICIOUS cinnamon buns.  Hubby wanted 2 right off and wants to take some to work.  That is good, seeing that if they were left here for me, I would eat them all.  I think I would cut the baking time to 17 minutes.  Put some confectionary icing on the sticky side, which made it even more delicious.  Thanks for the great treat.

AMAZING!!  Be careful when you put them in the oven however.  If you leave them in too long, the butter/brownsugar mix at the bottom turns into a thick, hard, chewey paste.  Tastes good when warmed up in microwave too.

These are VERY good,... but I must have done something a bit wrong because mine are neither ooey or gooey. The layer of brown sugar and butter on the bottom of the pan hardened into a toffee kind of substance,... so their kind of candy coated instead of ooey and gooey but still VERY yummy.

These are delicious.  They weren't all that difficult to make, and the result was a gorgeous pan full of perfect looking little cinnamon buns.  I actually took a picture of them because they were so beautiful!  They are very tasty and I'm glad I made them.

So good, it was my first time making cinnamon buns so it was a challenge but it turned out good.  Somehow my butter/brown sugar mix wasn't quite  runny enough and got really hard and stiff, but otherwise quite good.  I skipped the pecans simply because im not a fan, but it still turned out delish!

LOVE IT. Everyone i know loved it as well. An elderly woman gave me a hug when i made them for her and told me that i was sent to her to give her the recipe because she searched everywhere to find a good recipe for her daughter. I wanted to get the credit for her, but of course, i couldn't. Thanks Jen. By the way, i've made this over 5 times already, and everytime i have to add more flour than suggested, also, i'd have to wrap each bun piece tighter after cutting. I can never get to roll it tight enough, does anyone have any suggestion of how to keep it tight?

I know I'm among the minority here, but this was not the best recipe I've ever tried for buns.  My "goo" seemed to crystalize, and there wasn't enough of it.  I prefer my version where the sticky stuff is made of water and brown sugar instead of butter.

These cinnamon buns are awesome! We used margarine instead of butter (didn't have butter on hand), and they still turned out great. My only advice would be to make sure you don't roll out the dough too thin. I have forwarded this recipe to all my friends and family, and urge everyone to try it :)

Certainly not like bakery/chain store bought, much better. Will do it again, only double recipe. Some people were cheated because they wanted more. Thank you.

Great recipe!!  You have to eat them quick though.  The topping hardened really fast. Thanks for submitting the recipe Jen. I have a feeling this is going to become an old family recipe.

Excellent recipe. They were sooo good. I didn't use as much flour but I still ended up with the same # of buns. It took more time but it was definitely worth it. I will definitely make them again!!

I've made this recipe a number of times and have gotten tons of compliments.  My fiance just loves them.  I put raisins inside the cinnamon buns and put pecans an marachino cherries on top of the buns instead of just the pecans.  Great recipe thanks for posting it.  It takes some time to make but it's well worth the wait.

Fabulous.  I don't have much experience with baking from scratch and still these came out perfectly.  I had planned to send most of them to work with my husband (so that I wasn't tempted to eat the whole pan!) but he refused...too good to share he said.  The only change I made was baking for only twenty minutes.

VERY time consuming, but the recipe warns you of that. I'm a newbie to cooking and found this VERY easy to follow, and the end result is delicious! Only problem I had was rolling, the dough stuck to the surface and I ended up with a mis-rolled mess...guessing I needed more flour. But this is worth it!

These are everything. My grandma made cinnamon buns for each of her kids' families every Christmas. She never used a recipe and every year they were amazing. She is now too old to continue baking, so I used this recipe at Christmas this last December and everyone was raving about them. Thank you for sharing!

Delish! So I went crazy and didn't use cinnamon at all. or brown sugar.  I used orange marmalade.  Rolled out the dough.  spread the marmalade nice and thick (that I made myself!) and rolled and sliced.  Put a half inch of clear white syrup in the bottom of each baking pan and baked at usual.  HOLY MOLY!  This dough is gonna see some weird combinations.  It is so versatile and kneaded and raised so perfectly.  Love LOve love.   Post your weird comvinations.  My next:  cardimom and golden raisin!

The way the recipe is written could use some edits: 

#1. I’m still trying to figure out where and  why I need vinegar? 

#2. “ Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time“
(It should clarify that there is still 2 1/2 cups remaining) 

Should read: Stir in the remaining 2.5 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time.

Great dough recipe, I did it without pecans but my next time making them I’ll use raisins. The dough bakes beautifully and rises nice and fluffy.

Turned out fantastic!  I used walnuts instead of pecans, and really liked the contrast of the sweet butter/sugar and the bitterish flavor of the walnuts.

I have made these so many times that they are now considered Grandma D's cinnamon rolls. I don't always add the nuts but no matter they are great. I also add icing made with cream cheese. Fantastic! Made them for Christmas morning and New Years Day. I love this recipe!

Delicious! I'm not sure what was meant to brush with butter after rolling priot to putting in pan, so I just buttered the seam. Since I had an issue with my yeast, I let it rise overnight and baked first thing in the morning for fresh Sunday morning breakfast and they were a hit in our house. Will definitely be making these again.

These were amazing! I have to eat Dairy Free so had to substitute my non-dairy butter, etc. You never would have known they were Dairy Free. My kids and Grandkids couldn't get enough!

I made 2 batches. One without nuts and one with Pecans. 

YUMMY!! I will definitely make this again!

Love it, my favorite consistent go-to recipe for these type breakfast buns for the last few years. I like to make a side of cream cheese frosting so I can pretend I'm at cinnabuns (though I prefer anything homemade over theirs honestly) 

I've cooked these with littles chattering nearby and been distracted grandma who isn't used to cooking with such, and they've still been highly edible, even my "worst" batch. I don't have notes to hand, but I always look at the "most helpful" recommendations as to how to do a particular recipe. If you are doing such, note what folk say about getting the sticky part right, I've had mostly successes there with the hints and unchanged recipe, but once I probably did something wrong, forget what, and still they were tasty, but all caramel type topping takes a bit of skill/learning curve. I make these 2 x a year! Adore just as they are! (I leave nuts off one area for littles who often eschew such!) and love the dental floss trick for cutting them!

Perrrffffffffeccccccccccctttt! 
I loved it. It was all gobbled down right away!
I followed the recipe for the dough to a T but I did leave the dough to rise overnight.
I made a classic cinnamon roll though. I mixed up butter , cinnamon and brown sugar from the recipe of the “soft, moist and gooey cinnamon rolls”  it required a bread machine which I don’t own lol........this lead me here and I couldn’t be more pleased!!
I used the recipe “the perfect cinnamon roll icing” and it complemented it perfectly indeed. 
This will be my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls. Loved it.

I did leave out the nuts and they still turned out great.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would. I topped my [12 large] cinnamon buns with cream cheese icing after they had cooled down a bit, and I'm not gonna lie, these are some of the best cinnamon buns I've ever had. Everything about this recipe is great, but you have to be prepared to put in the time, about 3.5 hrs to frank. 

This was my my first time making cinnamon buns, or any yeast pastry, and this wasn't too difficult (though I have baked before). Before the first proof I thought I had messed up my dough because it was really rubbery and hard to knead, but after it sat for an hour it was much softer. I had trouble rolling it out too because, like puff pastry, it wouldn't stop shrinking back to a ball. Eventually I got it rolled out (18x14" is smaller than you think) I filled it with [about] 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup (not fresh) ground cinnamon, and 1/2 a cup butter. This made for a rich, thick cinnamon swirl guaranteeing a moist pastry. I only made 12 buns because you NEVER want to crowd them, they will grow when they proof AND when they bake. The large sweet sticky cinnamon buns this left me with makes this is my new go to recipe.

I baked this for my wife and she loved it.  Over 4 days she ate them all, ever one.  She then bought more pecans and told me to save that recipe.  She stays thin, I on the other hand looked crossed eyed ate the finished cinnamon Buns and gained 3 pounds.

The best and they cook up huge, tried to make them smaller and the were a bit dry, in hindsight I should have cut the cooking time by ten minutes. . Everyone I served them to said it was the best they have ever had. I did add more cinnamon for more flavour

Perfect gooey-ness and fluffiness! I cut the recipe in half and it came out fine. Too sweet for my taste so I would cut down on the brown sugar. Used walnuts instead of pecans - the crunch adds great texture!!

Absolutely AMAZING! I ended up doubling the amount of pecans which made it crunchier, as well as the filling because it didn't fill the dough quite enough. The gooeyness is incredible and everyone loved them!

My lard  ate 6 in the first sitting. These are incredible! I can't bake but decided to impulsively make these... 10/10 would make again.

I followed the recipe almost to the T - the only change is I only used 3.5 cups of flour

I got a little confused on the steps but that was my fault.  The dough was a little tricky because I'm not used to working with it.  The taste was great and they were gooey but not too gooey!

I found adding regular sugar instead of brown sugar has a nice taste to it.

I made half of the recipe putting 5 rolls in a small round cake pan and 2 larger rolls in a loaf pan, both lined with parchment paper. I followed the recipe but used demerara sugar.  Who doesn't love melted butter and brown sugar especially with nuts? Like some of the others and because I used smaller pans, I baked for 20 minutes at 375 rather than 25 to 30 minutes, putting extra melted butter on at the 15 minute mark.  I also went for extra pecans. The caramel does bubble up so watch for this. One is gone. It had a happy life. Looking forward to eating the rest in the days to come. The texture is light and fluffy. The taste is wonderful.

These where delicious!  The only change I made was, I added 1/2 cup golden raisins to the cinnamon mixture with just a sprinkle of nuts.  Also used chopped almonds instead of pecans simply because I didn't have any.  I cut into 12 buns instead of 15 and it fit perfectly in a 9 x 13 pan.

These were really good. I do like my pecans rolled up in the middle as well, so next time I'll add some inside.

Served this for family Christmas morning and it was a big hit. Moist, delicious and ooey-gooey. 

I free-styled with the cinnamon and brown sugar, and let mine rise overnight in the pan for an early morning fresh bake.

I made this and I'd say I'm not good with rising yeast but I followed the directions and they turned out wonderful. Next time I believe I will add some more topping to the top while baking that way all of it will be ooey and gooey. My family loved it and even though it did take a while to make, it was worth it!

Use this for my sticky buns every year, I let them rise one more time. If I don’t make them on thanksgiving and Christmas, there would be an uprising!

Though it took some time to make it was well worth it..light fluffy dough and probably the best I've eaten.  We omitted the nuts still perfect.

These were amazing, although I did decide to add a cream cheese frosting to them once they cooled off a bit.  That really puts these over the top.  My only criticism would be that the sugar/butter/pecan mix on the bottom of the pan comes out a little 'grainy' textured.  I plan to make these yet again, but will actually cook down the sugar and butter first so that the sugar dissolves and hopefully this will eliminate the graininess.

I don’t normally write reviews but I thought this one was worth it.  I wanted to make mini cinnamon rolls so after rolling out the dough into the 18x14 inch rectangle I then cut the rectangle into two pieces each 18x7 inches.  I filled and rolled each rectangle so each filled roll was 18 inches long.  I then cut with dental floss (highly recommend) resulting in rolls that were approximately 1 inch high (more or less).  Based on other reviews I also doubled the topping.  I was a bit worried when I put the rolls in the pan with the topping – they looked like they were swimming in it.  I brought these to a potluck where I baked them there so they probably rose for 3 hours for round 2 of rising.  They really grew and they were no longer drowning in topping when served.  It was the perfect amount.  The cinnamon rolls were devoured and I received many compliments for them.  Definitely worth making  :)

Great recipe, love the dough very light. I didnot use all the butter and sugar in the bottom of the pan as thought that was too much. Will definitely make again.

This is a really good recipe and it does take long, I was really satisfied with the result, but I did make some changes:

1. I made more of the butter/brown sugar mixture to pur in the pans
2.I used round cake pans instead of square
3.I didn't have a lot of pecans so I crushed some walnuts too
4.the dough was too dry - i made 1/2 cup of a milk/water mixture to add to the dough for it to get to the right consistency, when I added too much, I just added a bit more flour, I kept doing this until it was right
5.For whatever reason, my dough was refusing to rise, I popped them in the oven any way and they still came out great
6.Keep the oven lower, I baked mine at 330 Celsius
7. I used a lot of butter on the dough before adding the sugar/cinnamon mixture
8.I used much more than 3/4 cup of brown sugar when I was applying it to the dough: I made sure it was completely caked in brown sugar/cinnamon and nuts before rolling 
 
finally here is a critical caveat: I used round cake pans that are not perfectly sealed at the bottom, I had to place a rectangular pan on the rack below the buns so that it could catch the leaking sugar/butter.  When I did this, it burnt my rectangular pan and set off my fire alarm - don't worry! Because it had absolutely no impact on the cinnamon buns themselves, it just got ridiculously smokey in the oven/apartment. Or, just use a pan that is sealed at the bottom (I know, obvious)

I'm a novice baker and even I was able to get these to turn out great!!! It does take 3 hours but luckily a lot of the tasks are meant to be  done while the dough is proofing. 

I am also always scared of overworking the dough but watching the video was helpful. I probably mixed in 3 of the 4 cups of flour into the dough before I turned the dough out onto the table and sprinkled in more flour as needed - didn't use the full 4 cups

Tasted really good! My only complaint is that if you don’t eat or serve them hot out of the oven, they get hard and sticky, and even putting them back in the oven or microwave won’t do much to help. 
If you live somewhere cold like me, I’ve learned to turn my oven on while making the dough and then setting the dough on top of or next to the oven to help with rising. It never gets warm enough in my house for it it rise properly without this!

I felt like this was too much flour. It made the first batch dry so I added 1/4 cup more milk and two tbsp of melted butter to the dough. Also my son added mini chocolate chips on top.

Only used 3.5 cups flour however I was using Large eggs that appeared to be on the smaller side. On next attempt will use extra large.
Added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mixture of butter and brown sugar in the small sauce pan. 
These were absolutely the best sticky buns ever!!! Made me think back to the ones I got when going to Grandma's house each summer.

Everything was going well (I followed the recipe to the 'letter') I only say that because I'm always accused (by my family) that I NEVER follow a recipe.  That's only because people create recipes and some steps just don't make logical sense (anyway, off on my soap-box).  However.  I followed all the steps from the video recipe and it was great...until I got to the part where I put the batch back in the oven to bake for the final product.  Disclaimer: the end pieces I placed in the oven to bake during the last rise of the buns, so I kinda guessed that it wouldn't take the allotted time that the recipe said to bake it for.  So, I shaved 10 minutes off.  Even with removing 10 minutes from the low end of the time allotted, they baked faster and when I took them out of the oven...they were not ooey gooey, but a little hard and sweet (except for the ones in the middle)  

Anyway.  I will bake them again because I will not let a recipe defeat me (smile).  My suggestion to anyone reading this, is to 1) While the buns are going through their last rise (after they've been placed in the sticky mixture) bake the ends that you trim off, just to get a gauge how long they may bake in your oven 2) After you've started baking, check the rolls after they have been in the oven for half of the time you're allotting to bake them.  Just to ensure that they don't get hard.  As that was very disappointing and I would hate for that to happen to anyone else.

Lastly, the flavor was great and this is

absolutely loved making this. it was so easy and straight forward. my only issue was the melted brown sugar and margarine crystalized while they baked so I ended up with crunchy sugar and a slightly soggy bottom of the bun, but besides that, it was great and tasted beyond amazing

Very good.  I did make one mistake.  I cooked them a little too long.  I was using a convection oven and I cooked them for 25 minutes.  I think that is 3-5 minutes too long.  Otherwise they turned out great.

I made these without the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. They are phenomenal! Worth all of the effort. 
I agree that putting a pan or baking sheet under the bun pan is a good idea to prevent drips from reaching the elements and wreaking havoc on your oven.

Very fluffy, I made it with vegan butter, I have a dairy allergy. I used becel vegan butter. Next time though I'll use a different brand, this one separates too much and has a weird smell once it gets too hot. If anyone knows if a nicer vegan butter to use im all ears. The recipe is deaf good though

The glaze on mine was tasty but hardened after being out of the oven 5min. I lowered the temp to 350° and it still did it. Other than that these are great. Love the taste of them.

Delicious! Bye- bye recipe I've been using for 20 years! I made these as 2" rounds once baked for a large brunch (I find people eat more when they are small).  I rolled the rectangle to 8" w, used only 1/3 of the butter, brown sugar and pecans indicated for the bottoms, made a mash of them and "buttered" the bottoms of the buns  before baking, spacing them like cookies so they did not touch while baking. Once putting them in the pan, I patted them down so that the "mash" was evened out underneath before letting them rise the second time. Baked them for 10 min on parchment, let them rest a couple min, put new piece of parchment on top of buns and then flipped them over onto new parchment. Scraped extra topping from old parchment onto  buns.

I loved these, turned out perfect. Didn't last the evening. I tried them gluten free by adding two teaspoons baking powder to the gf flour and double sifting. Also extra yeast, dough needs to still be a bit sticky when rising so don't add much extra flour when kneading.  They baked up well obviously not as fluffy but the flavour was there. thank you for the recipe.

I made the dough in the bread maker substituting canola oil for the butter in the dough - dough was lovely to work with - there was just the right amount of gooey goodness in the butter/brown sugar mixture -couldn't really taste the cinnamon but perfect otherwise -will definitely make again

They looked beautiful just like the picture, but VERY oily from the butter and molassesy (if that’s a word lol) and not in a good way... if you love to taste melted butter with not very much sugar then this is the recipe for you;) unfortunately I do not love butter quite that much... I will say my kids still ate them though lol. But sadly I will not be making these again... on to to the next recipe!

I added a heaping tbsp of cinnamon both times and they were fabulous. My bf loves them. Best rolls recipe I have used in a long time it’s a new favourite that’s for sure! Also I took leftover butter and spread over the top of each bun so it could soak in and through.

I just used the caramel-pecan for the bottom of my cinnamon rolls (Clone of a Cinnabon recipe), and it tastes delicious, yet I would suspect it’d be better to put the caramel-pecan mixture AFTER the cinnamon rolls are done. It seems like the only way to go for pretty sticky buns. Next time I’ll try it that way. Although I think my mistake was I used all the sauce for 8 cinnamon rolls (whups!). The dough comes out moist and sweet (not overly sweet) ~ even yummy to peel off the pecan-caramel part and just eat the bread.

I swapped the flour with PC All Purpose Gluten Free Flour and it turned out great!  Weigh the flour rather than using a measuring cup.

I made this exactly as described with one exception.  Once they were all set to go in the oven, I covered them with tin foil and put them in the fridge over night.  Christmas morning, I pulled them out of the fridge, pre-heated the oven, and baked them.  By the time everyone was up (all adults), coffee made and table set, the buns were ready to eat, fresh and warm!  So very delicious, the best buns I've ever made.  I will do this every year from now on.

Should be 5 stars for taste but there is NO WAY 15 rolls are fitting into a 9x13 pan! I barely squeezed in 12 and as I'm typing this I'm watching them squeeze each other out of the pan haha BUT! I just put some of the extra melted butter in a frying pan and fried up the last 3 and they were deeeeeelicious!

This is a great recipe and a big hit in my house! I followed the recipe to the T except I 
a. Added vanilla paste to the milk/butter mixture to impart some flavor into the dough itself. 
b. Added a little cream to the milk for more flavor.
c. Added honey to the butter before brushing it on the dough and sprinkling the cinnamon sugar on top. 
d. left the pecans out of the filling and only used it as a topping.

However (at no fault to the recipe creator) the video is very misleading.  Firstly, I've made this recipe quite a few times now & my dough never turns out like it does in the video. It is a really sticky dough before the first proof. Also, I'm convinced the lady in the video used different measurements for the brown sugar butter mixture. It WILL NOT come out anywhere near  that thick being that we're using equal parts . It is much more like a water. I do add more  sugar to make it thicker and avoid having a soggy top.

All in all, while this recipe is time intensive (any yeast leavened dough is) it really is so fun to make and customize the fillings to your taste. And in the end you will have something so delicious that everyone will rave about.

5 stars because the bun itself is not overly sweet. After reading the various reviews, I proceeded to 'create ' the buns.  They were wonderful! The bun was light and fluffy. The sauce was also good but will try adding maple syrup  to the sauce next time to give it that extra gooeiness. I may experiment with cream. Sooooooo many possibilities. And the family loved them also. Yeah, it's a keeper.

Easy to follow instructions. And the bun tastes so good when we tried about 15 mins after baked. It turns a bit stiff the next day but just microwave it with a glass of water for 15-20 secs it'll be warm and soft again.

I made this recipe specifically because it was called "ooey gooey" and that's what was requested. Unfortunately it didn't live up to its name as far as that goes. However, we still found them delicious and it had a relatively easy to follow recipe.

Delicious!!! My family couldn't get enough and almost finished the whole dish after dinner last night. I put all the dough ingredients into my bread maker, on the dough setting and followed the rest of the recipe as written ( I did use walnuts, personal preference). Amazing! Thank you for this tasty gem, I will definitely make again.

This recipe is wonderful! They remind me of Sunday morning at the Jersey shore. This one is a must try. I did not have any issue with a sticky knife at all. I did what was done in the video (very helpful) and the came out great.

As someone who had never in their life made cinnamon rolls from scratch, let me just say that these DEFINITELY outdo store-bought ones. 

I only had one egg in my refrigerator, so i substituted the second egg for a 1/4 cup of mashed banana. It gave the cinnamon rolls a subtle taste of banana. They were delicious! 
I will definitely use that banana next time!

I go to this recipe for any type of bread I'm making. It's awesome and fluffy. Adjustments I make are 1/4 lard instead of butter and replace the 1/4 sugar with the same amount of natural honey. Tastes wonderful

Me and my younger sister managed to bake this and wow! The cinnamon rolls taste the best when they're hot. For some reason, our glaze was pretty hardened once the rolls have cooled, but maybe this is normal? We microwaved them when we wanted to eat them and the glaze softened well. Also, make sure to keep an eye on the cinnamon rolls in the oven; we may have slightly over-baked them at around 22 min of baking.

These were very good. Everyone liked them.  I made extra brown sugar and butter for the bottom of the pan ( 1 cup of each)  and added a couple tablespoons of cream to that as well.  I also added about a heaping tsp of cinnamon to the flour.   I'm not sure that I really needed the extra brown sugar and butter as there was lots of gooey goodness. Too much - if one could have too much of a good thing.  Excellent recipe,  even though I forgot to put in the salt.  I let them rise in the fridge so that I could cook them later in the day when we could eat them warm.

These were s large, fluffy and ooey gooey delish! The caramel sauce was perfect but a bit too much so in making the again I lessened the amount of sauce that I made. i can tend to bubble up and very so I recommend placing a drip pan underneath to save from a messy cleaning job in your oven.

I've made these two times now, both times the turned out wonderfully! I'm not a baker and these cinnamon buns are my first attempt at bread, these were very fun to make. I did add more cinnamon/brown sugar when I sprinkled it onto the dough. I found there wasn't quite enough the first time.

I've made this recipe a few times and with a few tweaks I figured it out. I always use tinfoil or parchment paper for easy cleanup. I took another reviewer's suggestion to add pancake syrup (not maple syrup) to the topping (about 1/3 cup or so) and I HIGHLY recommend this. I also added 3 TBSP coffee cream from another reviewer suggestion and about half a cup more of each butter and brown sugar. The topping was gooey and perfect!!

My oven runs very hot and i think the recipe needs adjustment anyways for baking time, my first recipe I followed the directions exactly and it was very hard and dark and I could hardly eat them. So I adjusted the temperature by 25 degrees less and cooked covered with tinfoil for 20 min. Then 5 minutes without the tinfoil. I baked them in a 9x13 metal cake pan. They browned perfect and tasted amaaaaaazing! Best cinnamon buns I've ever made and I have been around the cinnamon bun block. 

A few more tricks I use: butter the inside with soft instead of melted butter, use toothfloss or string to cut the cinnamon buns (mint will not alter the flavor), roll them tight, and let them rise a  ton longer than the recipe says especially the second time. If you use tinfoil and it sticks to the pan, run hot water into it under your tap, let it soak a minute and it should peel off. Wrap your buns immediately in tinfoil to trap the heat and moisture until they are cool enough to eat. I dump mine straight onto tinfoil after the three minutes and cover it with more

I have a sticky bun recipe I have been making since high school that everyone loved.  I tried these and think I like them better.  The bun is lighter & softer in texture & this probably has to do with the fact that you let them rise twice (my old one had one rise).  I do wish it had a bit more sauce to make them really gooey.  I divided the recipe into 2 using 2 pie pans with 7 buns per pan.  I baked the one pan right away as per the directions.  The other pan I put in the frig overnight.  I pulled them out about 1/2 hour before baking them and took fresh baked buns into work (everyone loved them!)  I think it is time to replace my old recipe with this one.  Thank you!

This recipe was great. I didn't change anything but found I didn't use all the flour (about 1/2cup left). I will watch it more carefully next time with second rising , it really puffed up. I took them to work and had no leftovers. I will make it again.

These were absolutely awesome. I have no idea why some reviewers are leaving less stars and complaining about this recipe! These are so easy to make with outstanding results. My husband loved them and he likes to think he's a cinnamon roll expert. I will definitely make them again!

There were steps missing in the recipe, the ingredients should be more organized. 
This recipe was extremely difficult to follow. After gathering all of the ingredients, there was an access of ingredients that the recipe never said when it should have been added into the batter or filling.

Foolproof! I even made the mistake of reading 1tsp of yeast as opposed to 1 envelope (2 1/4 tsp)...I realized after the dough barely rose what I had done. I cheated by mixing the other 1 1/4 tsp of yeast with 2 tbsp warm water and a 1/2 tsp of sugar, let that sit for ten minutes, and kneaded it into the dough. It rose perfectly after another 45 mins, and tasted great!

Used only 3 cups of flour and 1 egg, skipped the gooey bit on the bottom but it would be delicious with it, and baked for 18 minutes. perfectly fluffy rolls!

I just made these today... My family LOVES them.. They are so good. The only thing I  would do differently is add more topping on.  There was only just enough. I also noticed that the cook time at least in my oven was ten minutes faster then they  said... I also add cloves to my recipe.. These were awesome.

I made the dough in my kitchenaid stand mixer and was alarmed it seemed very wet/loose, so I added an extra 1/2 cup flour. As it turns out, I'd accidentally added double the butter. (One should not bake while packing school lunches/convincing children to brush teeth, etc.)  It worked out, thank God. The recipe made 16 huge rolls. 

I followed other reviewers' advice about doubling the butter /brown sugar and I regret it. Waaay too much caramel for my tastes! I feared I'd go into a sugar coma if I'd tried to eat a whole roll with its portion of caramel. 

Next time, I'll follow the original amounts. I'll also bake four and freeze the rest, unbaked, in packages of four each. That should be a year's worth of pecan sticky rolls for us.

My family and I love this recipe. When I make it, I double it because people always want more. Also, I make a little bit extra of the sticky syrup base because we like ours extra sticky.

I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I used walnuts instead. It turned out very yummy and I will most definitely make these again.

The only change I made to this recipe is that I used softened butter spread on the dough instead of melted butter.  These caramel pecan  rolls were soft and pillowy,  gooey and buttery and just outright delicious.  This is now my go to recipe.  I'm stopping my search here.

Amazing recipe!! I only added one additional step, after baking, I turned them over onto a cookie sheet and I noticed they didn't look as "sticky" as I had hoped for. I melted 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter on low temp in a saucepan, heated on medium-low until bubbling and slightly thickened, poured over the top and sides of the buns. Added that extra stickiness and sweetness that took these to the next level. With this additional step, I rate these 5/5! I could eat the whole tray!

Followed the recipe and directions and came out GREAT... next time will add some raisins as well - also Walnut or pecans can be used - whatever you have.  One trick because this is time consuming - make the dough the night before, put into a bowl and cover with damp towel and put into the refrigerator over night - it will slow the rise and be ready in the morning for the next steps

BEST GOOEY ROLLS I EVER HAD!!  I know if I made them every day every one of them would be eaten every day.... just toooooo good for words!  


I used my fav breadmaker recipe, then follow the directions for the filling and topping exactly.  The only thing I did different was I cooked the butter/b. sugar for the bottom of the pan, till dissolved.  Wow are these great!  

Made it the second time, and used Grandma's little trick to make them even gooey-er.  Before the rise in the pan, drizzle just a little bit of cream in the spaces between the rolls,  and the spaces around the edges.  They stay gooey-er longer, though in my house, the most they have lasted so far was over night!

Also make them with walnuts so yummy.

Can't even say how terrific this recipe is!

The recipe was easy to follow and turned out delicious!

I ended up having to use two baking dishes 13 x 9 and a 6 x 8 to allow enough space for the buns to rise for a second time.

Also in the Carmel sauce I added about a shot of Jameson and a dash of Cardamon... and used sliced almonds instead of the pecans. I then lightly sprinkled some Pink Himalayan Sea Salt once poured into the baking dish. 

These have the perfect sweetness without being overally sweet.  

The only thing I would do differently is to make some extra Carmel sauce and use a little more Jameson.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They turn out significantly smaller than the true cinnabon, but that is not a bad thing. Next time I will cut the batch into 12 instead of 15.  The amount of butter is incredible, definitely a once in a blue moon treat.  Excellent taste and texture.  A lot of  work but will impress your company.

This was a very easy recipe to make follow per instructions.  I left out the cinnamon and the pecans as i have kids that hate the cinnamon, I did add 2 minced apples cored out and no peelings to the insides of the rolls, and it turned out very good!!  I used the large sandwich knife  with the ridged edge to cut and worked nice.  I have had yummier caramel rolls, but these are very good for how easy they are to make!  Yes be careful you put this in a Large cooking pan because it does rise the mixture out of your pan.

Excellent recipe! 

I forgot to add the 1 tsp sugar to the yeast in the first step (didn't affect how it turned out). I used coffee cream instead of milk (the cream had to be used). I let the first rising go for an hour, and the second rising for for 1.5 hours. I set a timer for 25 minutes, uncovered, until 13 minutes were left, took them out and pressed them down a bit as they had "overinflated" somewhat. For the remaining 13 minutes I covered them in foil to prevent overbrowning of tops. After finished baking I took them out of pan immediately and covered them in foil on a plate until ready to be served. Super picky husband said this is the recipe I should keep- BIG statement for him to make.

Holy cow! This recipe must be foolproof, because I just made them never having made cinnamon rolls before AND without using measuring cups or spoons.

I made it because I'm visiting the family in Costa RIca that hosted me for my study abroad a couple years ago. They wanted me to make cinnamon rolls since they're somewhat exotic in Costa Rica, and THEY WERE SO GOOD. I definitely surprised myself. After eating two, my host mom was very impressed and said, "Ya puedes casarte." ("Now you can get married.")

Altitude note: We're at 6,000-7,000 feet here. I increased the temperature to 200 degrees Celsius and cooked them for about 32 minutes. When I took them out of the oven, they weren't quite brown on top but were definitely done enough.

I added a cream cheese frosting that was good: 2/3 cup cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 spoonful vanilla, 1/4 cup butter. (Measures are very approximate).

I consider myself to be very much a novice baker.  The first thing that got my attention was the name of the recipient.  Anything called Ooey Gooey has got to be good.  I have made this numerous times now and my wife, who is very health conscious and not a big fan of sweets, has asked me to stop making it for a while.  She will eat several at one sitting.

We made this for Easter Brunch.  It is really an easy recipe, you just have to start it early to allow time for rising.  We started it early in the morning while we prepared other bruch food. We let it rise in the microwave - first put a medium bowl half full of water in microwave for about 3 -4 minutes, then when you take out the bowl of water rather quickly put the covered dough into the microwave and quickly close it and leave it undisturbed to rise.  When it's in the oven baking, next time I'll check it at about 22 -25 minutes, because 30 minutes made the bottom just a tiny bit too browed for me.  This is best served right from the oven, but it's delish no matter when you eat it!

These were delicious. I skipped the pecan nuts as I'm not a fan of those, but I added some of member Cara M's "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing". You'd think that'd be overkill on these already gooey, sticky rolls, but it made them even better. Had they not been so unhealthy, I'd make them all the time. The instructional video was really helpful.

I have made it many times.  It's the only cinnamon roll recipe I use now. Changes I made:  add cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the dough recipe, and also add vanilla to the caramel recipe. Only baked it for 20-25 minutes and it's not dried out the next day. I love the texture the chopped pecans give to these rolls.

I absolutely loved these!  I think they taste better than Cinnabon's cinnamon buns. Follow the exact rising times or they will fight for space in the baking pan  and come out deformed.

Kept them for 28 minutes at 360 until they were golden brown - ended up bring too dry.....should have taken them out earlier when they are pale..,,,

My boyfriend made them for us, and they were super ooey -gooey. I would have liked them more with a cream cheese glaze though. But they were still really good

These are PERFECTION! I left out the salt this time and they still turned out beautifully. I also make mine waaaaaay "too sweet" by upping the butter and brown sugar for both the lining and filling. Next time, I'm going to replace pecans with diced apple...can't wait!

Ive made the clone of the cinnabon many times, but I really wanted to make sticky buns.  These were easy to make and the recipe was great as written.  Really good fresh or heated up.  I had them at least a week and even the last one was excellent.  They are way more sugary than cinnamon rolls though.

I've made these many times and have developed somewhat of a following for them in my circle. I have only ever had one issue and that, I'm quite sure was caused by the outdated yeast.

This recipe is amazing!!! The Carmel sauce is so good.  Make sure to place a cookie sheet underneath while baking to catch any caramel drips though.  After cooked, flip the rolls over on to the beforemetioned cookie sheet and this will ensure all the caramel sauce drips through.

I blended whole wheat flour and all purpose, and omitted the pecans.  I'm not sure if I used all the flour that was called for either as I just based it on consistency  of the dough.  But they turned out amazing!!! Will make again for sure

These are amazing!!!! 
I've made them twice now and first time they were gone within 3 days second time they were gone that evening. 
Key points:
Make sure to let it rise both time the directions call for! 
For a little added extra treat I made some homemade icing with vanilla butter and powered sugar and poured that on some of them. 
I'm not one to eyeball when it comes to cooking so yes I did bust out a measuring tape when rolling out the dough. 
Definitely a keeper!!!

I was really looking forward to these, but they were too sweet and not moist enough.  I think the problem is the amount of brown sugar. This recipe calls for 1.5 cups brown sugar. Brown sugar should be measured packed, at 200g per cup, but in recipe that is way too much.  Too sweet, and it dries out buns. Indeed the topping was hard when it came out of the oven.  I would recommend using a total of 1 cup (200g) for the entire recipe. If you use a metal pan I also recommend 350 degrees instead of 375.

Loved the bun its self, not a huge fan of the brown sugar crusting, but that is a personal opinion. The nuts can be a little too much but it depends if you are a fan of pecans. Other than that, this is a fantastic cinnamon bun and I would make it again.

My husband and daughter made these rolls yesterday, refrigerated them over night, and baked them this morning and they were AMAZING! The dough was nice and fluffy and the sauce on top was gooey and delicious!  My husband said he followed the recipe and the only change he will make next time is to add a bit more cinnamon which is just a personal preference.

375 is too hot. Turn it down to 350 to prevent burning.
These are good, but dry in the middle. Could use more sauce

Only used 3 cups of flour... the dough was becoming too stiff.  

The end result was far too sweet.  Next time I try these I won't be making the brown sugar mixture for the bottom.  Really makes these not so enjoyable.

I did make a cream cheese icing afterwards which helped.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I think I was hoping for more of a caramel pecan bun type of flavor.  This just seemed like a grainy brown sugar overly sweet recipe.  I'm so glad I didn't double the brown sugar and butter for the bottom of the pan like so many had recommended.  I'm still on the hunt for a gooey caramel flavor.

This is a great recipe! Don't be too alarmed if the first rise in the bowl doesn't look that risen....the second rise in the pan makes them perfect. Nice dough consistency, will make again.

Every one really loved this recipe.  I did not have a lot of time so I substituted frozen bread dough. It still turned out wonderful.

This is an awesome recipe. Mine turned out perfect. Moist,soft and wonderful flavor. It was such a great experience having them turn out so perfect since I have only tried to make cinnamon rolls twice before and they just weren't this delicious.
once the dough is rolled I use dental floss or fishing line to slice it into individual pieces.
 Thank you!

Made these today, exactly as the recipe was written.  They were a huge hit!  The outside buns got a little chewy with goo, which my daughter loved.  I would definitely make this recipe again!

I signed up just to be able to give this recipe 5 stars.  It was easy to follow the instructions and isn't too sweet.  Just sweet enough.  I am planning to make these without the nuts for school bake sales coming up.

My 14 year old son came into the kitchen yesterday afternoon with the Allrecipes app opened on the iPad, with this recipe pulled up. He said, "Mom, do we have active dry yeast?" Well, yes son, yes we do! He made these all buy himself, and they turned out fantastic! He was a little impatient, as he had no idea what he was getting himself into with a yeast bread recipe - but once they were done, and he tasted one, he said "I WILL be making these again!"

i was so nervous trying this recipe out but boy was it worth it!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with some minor changes as I could only find instant yeast that comes in 11gm packets where I live. I used about 1 3/4 teaspoons of instant yeast as the equivalent. I also let the dough rise for the same amount of time as above even with instant yeast. It's true what @JEWEL1190 notes that the longer you let them rise, the flufflier they become. And, instead of melting the butter, i brushed the butter at room temperature (I live in the tropical rainforest climate, everything melts at room temperature) over the dough and it worked out fine. The aroma in the house was incredible and by the time I served them, they were all gone in a matter of minutes. At everyone's request, will definitely do these again, even if it involves quite a bit of effort and bucket loads of patience. Well, you can alway reply emails, cook dinner or finish up a blog while waiting for the dough to rise. :) LOVE IT!

Yum! I used this recipe to make cinnamon buns (w/o the sticky goo). I've never made them from scratch before so I was a little nervous but they turned out very nicely. I did everything in the recipe except the part where you make the sugar/butter/pecan stuff. Just put the cut rolls in a buttered dish, let them rise, and then baked them. I glazed them with a little maple syrup when they came out of the oven. So so good! Oh and I added a little vanilla to the milk mixture out of habit but I'm not sure if it really made a big difference. Thanks for the great recipe! Will be making again! Would like to try the gooey buns next time.

I experimented a bit- I really like substituting butter with coconut oil so I was exited to try.  Everything went fine except the sauce & filling.(I split this recipe into 3 separate batches after the first proof (i.e. bread rising) 

My first batch with coconut oil instead of butter separated so had to dump it- the next caramel sauce and filling I did with butter and I used half a cup for both the filling and the topping sauce unfortunately I misunderstood the instructions and prepared my filling sauce the same way as the pan sauce-merely adding cinnamon-this resulted in a LOT of mess and most of the filling baked out:( so I used the rest of that as my topping sauce for the next batch. also the sauce on the first batch came out more like toffee than caramel :( started hardening even while still pretty hot. Also only needed to bake about 20 minutes-

The next batch I spread softened butter onto the roll & covered in the sugar mix. they rolled up nicely, & filling stayed in place but I had the same problem with the sauce and adjusted cooking time again.

The third I mixed the sugar mixture with a bit of softened coconut oil instead of melting it and used it like a paste for the topping which I spread over the tops and bottoms. for the filling I treated the coconut oil like the butter in the last one. the filling came out ok sauce not so much.
Bottom line- I would NOT cook with the sauce and instead make caramel sauce separately with the addition of milk. base dough = awesome

Thank you! thank you! thank you!  We have attempted baking cinnamon buns in the past, but our endeavours failed. We thought we'd give it one more try with your recipe and instructions.  Wow!  The buns turned out fluffy and soft and absolutely delicious!

Delicious! I made these cinnamon buns a total of three times, the second was a bit of a fail. You don't want to start making the cinnamon butter mixture until after you roll the dough out or it will get too hard. I like to bring it to a complete boil and then put it in the bottom of my pan. You also want to make sure you don't roll them too tight or they won't cook in the middle but will be hard on the outside. I also don't add all of the flour and Sift the cinnamon and sugar topping together:)

i have made it today . it was incredible. I faced a little problem in the butter and brown sugar mixture which were the pan , they didn't melt after baking .perhaps  i should mix them well before adding to the pan. but apart from that the texture of the Cinnamon rolls was awesome and fluffy and it is the 5 star recipe for cinnamon rolls. the next time i will make sure to mix the sugar with butter well so that it can turn to Carmel. just one question i wonder what is the best light or dark brown sugar???

These are THE BEST! I made them at night using bread flour and allowed my bread maching to do the mixing and kneading.  Then I cold proofed them in the fridge overnight.  I used my ovens proof setting in the morning then baked as directed. Oh I dab a bit of the goo on the up side to help prevent drying out.  I ended up with 16 since It's easier to cut with even numbers. Lol  3 days later they are still moist and delish!!
ps thanks to the reviewer for sharing the rolling technique and to use the roller on top of the toppings...they looked bakery beautiful!

Delicious! I did not flip them over and instead left the gooey side on the bottom and iced the top with cream cheese icing once they cooled a bit. They taste so much like Cinnabons, my stomach is aching from eating so many!

These were really time-consuming then butter/sugar mix boiled over the pan and smoked out my kitchen. Will not try this recipe again.

Hubs likes gooey cinnamon rolls, and the last several recipes I've tried just didn't make the cut for him.  So, I decided I'd go for one with "gooey" in the title to see if that would make him happy.  I did use a quarter more butter and sugar in this just to accommodate him, but I think it might've been just fine without it.  Success!  He loved these!  I didn't use pecan--didn't feel like chopping any--and instead used Craisins.  Worked just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried to make Cinnamon Rolls for years and failed. This one was easy and my entire family agreed were the best I have made. Baking them with the topping on bottom allowed them to soak up the butter. Turning them onto a serving tray put the carmel topping right where it should be to drizzle down the sides.

Turned out great but the tops were a little bit dry (I only baked them for 25 minutes).  I wish I knew how to keep them from getting so brown.

Tried this recipe today, and OH. MY. GOODNESS!!! Followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out beautifully! Was a little nervous, because I read the reviews while they were baking, and thought maybe I should have tweaked it a little... I did not need to worry. No changes were necessary at all!  I made half with the pecans & half without for my sometimes picky crew. They LOVE them! I'm very pleased.  Thank you, definitely adding this one to my recipe book.

Made these today. They are so yummy! My hubby loved them. I watched the video first, which was helpful, then followed written directions exactly but had to use about half walnuts as well as pecans since I didn't have enough pecans. Still turned out really good. 25 minutes was a tad too long. Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I will probably pull out at about 22-23 minutes.

Best one I have found yet.  Rose beautifully, even when I kept them in the fridge overnight and baked them Christmas a.m.  I didn't make any changes and the only thing I might try is adding raisins since we like them in cinnamon buns.

These buns were totally awesome! I made them for a mid-Christmas morning snack and was sweets do not last long in this home I doubled the recipe and got four (4) dozen buns;so, I split the batch in half and made a batch of "OoeyGooey buns" and a batch of regular cinnamon buns with a butter-cream glaze - even four dozen didn't last more than a few days.

This was the first time ever making cinnamon buns and I must say I was a little scared. But I read the instruction step by step and they came out perfect. I also followed what hDavis said about the string. That made for easy cutting. I love the buttery taste and put extra on. I will definitely be making these bad boys again.
Thank you

These were ooey-gooey! I didn't use pecans, but on half I used cashews. I followed the directions exactly, except I only baked them for 17 minutes on about 360. Mine only made 12 buns (not 15). But they were great! Next time I would make sure the butter and sugar syrup cooked a bit more so the sugar isn't grainy at all. Yum!

Semi~Homemade style, I don't have time to make homemade rolls so I bought refrigerated Cinnamon Rolls (Jumbo).  I made the Ooey Gooey sauce & put into bottom of 9x13 pan, plopped the Cinnimen rolls on top...let sit for about an hour on the counter.  Baked 25 min 350* & Viola!!  Next thing I know they are GONE!!   Thank you for sharing!!

i have made this recipe several times and it's always been a hit around here. they didn't dry out and were so good.. i am going to try adding a bit more caramel sauce as we like it with more. these buns never last for more than a couple of days.. they are gone so fast.... hubby always asks me to make some.

This was the first time I ever made cinnamon rolls and have to admit I was very nervous. (I've never had luck working with yeast). I followed the directions to a T and they came out beautifully. My family loved them and said they should be made frequently! I used a serrated bread knife to cut the rolls and had no problems. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!!

These were delicious and the directions easy to follow. Only thing is that I set them for 30 minutes in the oven, but they turned out a little hard. (Probably should have checked on them periodically, but I also heard that if you keep opening an oven it messes with the baking? I dunno. Bigger cook here). Next time, I try for 20-15 minutes so it retains the ooey gooeyness. =)

Love this recipe...I put raisins instead of pecans on the dough with the brown sugar & cinnamon.  I have to make a double batch each time because so many people enjoy them...I keep them in the freezer all the time for a quick treat...

I didn't make the cinnamon bun portion, but the bun portion was spot on! I made this recipe into twelve large pizza buns, by spreading a can of pizza sauce, sprinkling with parm & oregano & mozza, and topping with small pieces of pepperoni. I rolled this up and baked for 30 mins. They were scrumptious!

This is sooooo good and decadent.  For the comment on dry stale... I had not such experience...but I didn't use all the 4 cups of flour... only amount necessary to form the dough.  It came out soooo tender... For those familiar with Diners Drive ins and Dives, we've rated it 'Shut the front door!'

I used my bread maker recipe but the gooey recipe from here.  I melted 3/4 cup of butter and then I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar but did not boil on stove.  I poured it on bottom of pan and sprinkled pecans.

the first time i tried this recipe, i followed it exactly and the caramel turned out more like candy - a bit hard, too sweet and baked for a bit too long.  the second time i added 1/3 cup low fat milk to the caramel mix on the bottom of the pan.  it stayed truly gooey and i liked it much better.  i also reduced the sugar by 2 Tbsp in the dough filling and didn't butter the dough before sprinkling the stuff on.  I reduced the baking time to 20 minutes and they came out perfect for me - light, fluffy, gooey and not too sweet.  thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I followed this dough recipe to a 'T' but after adding 3 1/2 cups of flour, my dough was stiff, with hardly any elasticity as in the video. Any suggestions as to what I was doing wrong?

Yes.  Do what it says in the recipe.  Except you don't need to get the milk really hot in the beginning...just enough to melt the butter. 

And you can use walnuts instead of pecans.
This recipe Calls for 3 whole sticks of butter altogether. haha :) Yess...don't try to skimp out on that. 

  At the end you flip them over, and the top is sticky and these are just great.  Store in sealed container if you have leftovers.  Thank you!

AWESOME Recipe!!!  We did not have time to make the dough from scratch so we bought HyVee brand frozen white bread dough and let it rise overnight.  Punched down in the morning, rolled out and followed rest of this recipe.

Very good flavor, but the dough was really sticky and hard to roll up.  It is almost the same dough I use to make crescents, but my dough for crescents isn't sticky after letting it rise in the lightly oiled bowl.  Don't know where it could have gone wrong.  Next time, just going to make my crescent dough and then start on step 5.

The dough for this recipe is splendid, sweet, soft, melt in your mouth.  The filling and glaze however are not right.  It was much too much sugar and not nearly enough cinnamon.  Ended up being more of a sweet roll instead of a cinnamon bun.

OMG, these are soo good.  I made minor adjustments such as using a recipe for the pampered chef cinnamon mix and cooking at 350 for about 25 minutes.  They came out gooey, but not doughy.  Awesome!  While the recipe is easy, I am glad that it is time consuming, otherwise I would make them alot more and that would be bad! ;)

The buns themselves were great, although I think next time I would try just spreading butter into the rolls before adding the cinnamon and brown sugar, instead of melting it first. I found most of the sugar just went to the bottom of the pan with the suggested method.

Also, I would not bother with the butter/brown sugar mixture at the bottom of the pan. Mine did not turn out ooey or gooey at all. The mixture turned more into a fudge consistency, which tasted good at the bottom of the cinnamon bun, but I would rather just make a glaze or frosting to accompany the buns.

I would make this recipe again, but with a few very minor changes just to suit me a little better.

Fluffy texture was great, but didn't really taste at all like cinnamon. For all the calories that are in these, I'd hoped they would've been sweeter.

Awesome!! First time I've ever made cinnamon buns & they turned out perfect.  I also let them rise for about 2 hours the first time & added a cream cheese icing once they were cooked.  The icing was:  4 oz each of: butter, light cream cheese, white sugar, & 1/2 tsp vanilla.

Awesome!  However, I used only one stick of butter and dark brown sugar in the baking dish.  I also made them without nuts.  This was my second time making cinnamon buns and my family absolutely loved them.  The first time they were a bit dry, but with this recipe they will turn out delish!  It was well worth the time and effort.  You'll be glad you're not on a diet when these are served.

I really wish my camera was working!  I made this recipe using my new KitchenAid Stand mixer I got for christmas.  I too, did not melt the butter I used softened butter and spread in on by hand.  After cutting them with dental floss (for perfect circles)  I placed them on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper about 2 inch apart and baked for 18 mins.  Yum Yum Yum!  I will definitely be making these again.

This recipe was pretty good. I think 1 tablespoon of cinnomon is too much, so i did half a teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon and a half of cinnomon. I like how these puffed up when i let them rise, but they got really soggy sitting in the carmel and then got really brown but werent completely done. they were good, but they need a thinker carmel- one with corn syrup or honey added, and decreased temperature, then it would be perfect.

Excellent! I froze them and pop them in the oven as needed. They are best fresh out of the oven, are the best left over because they dry out easily.

This recipe was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a more traditional cinnamon roll. Not like the ones in the mall with all the icing and such. More like the ones I used to get at the local cinnamon roll shop in Pismo Beach. This recipe came out perfect and everone that tried them couldn't believe how good they were. AND I made the dough in my bread maker and it was perfect.

I made these yesterday, and they were delicious!! The only thing I would change is the bake time...it was a touch too long...maybe 15-20 minutes would have been sufficient. And I put a bit more brown sugar in the filling :)

I never made any kind of bread before in my life. This recipe is great! It was a hit. Though I would suggest to cook the "bottom" sirup a little bit longer so it is not "crunchy". 2 thumbs up!!!

I made these with Multi-Grain Flower, They were AMAZING! and a little healthier too. I took the advice of one of the other reviews and used butter that was not melted to spread on the rolled out dough. it seems to work well. although i never tried them the other way so?? Its up to u.

This recipe is fantastic!  It's exceptionally easy and fun to make!  I don't do much different other than adding more nuts than called for. My family loves them, and I've made them once for a friend who served the leftovers to his downstairs neighbors...they asked for my number!  Haha!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good basic recipe. I added currants to the inside of the rolls and used quite a bit more cinnamon. I also added another 1/4 cup each of butter and brown sugar to the topping plus some maple syrup. Cinnamon rolls are a special treat and can't be too gooey!

A complete disaster, the recipe for the dough was tasteless, and had a somewhat rancid taste.  I mixed up two batches of dough using different materials both times to verify if it was the ingredients or the recipe, and it was definitely the recipe.  Furthermore, the cinnamon filling didnt become gooey at all! In fact, the buns fell apart because the the spirals didnt join.  Definite disappointment.

I'm not crazy about the sticky topping - not quite caramel-y enough for me (it stays kind of granular). Maybe the addition of honey and cream would make it better???

These are just amazing, and worth the time and effort.  My boyfriend and I prep these before dinner, wait for the rising, pop in a movie, pausing to do some of the intermediate steps, and by the end of our movie they're ready to go and *so* delicious.  My one complaint would be the messiness left on the cooking sheets - it's a hassle to clean all the sticky syrup.  But other than this, these cinnamon buns are to die for!

Insanely tasty. These cinnamon buns are melt in your mouth perfection. Also, it is actually a fun-to-make recipe that will probebly monopolize an afternoon but IT IS WORTH IT! The "string trick" (mentioned previously in the comments page) works very well for separating the cinnamon roll.

These tasted pretty good, and were very easy to make. I had to add a bit more flour though, to make the dough manageable. This wasn't the traditional sticky bun that I'm used to...I'm used to a more sticky topping...maybe with some corn syrup?

I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough and a dash of allspice to the brown sugar. They came out great!! A lot of work for a couple of minutes of eating. I would make them the night before next time and warm in the microwave.

I had high hopes for this recipe after seeing how well others liked it, but I won't make it again.  The dough itself was fine, but  the caramel on the bottom of the pan turned out to be rock hard.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I think I'll stick with the good ol' cream cheese frosting.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully. The only changes I made were substituting EarthBalance spread for the butter and used vanilla Silk in place of the milk because I do not use dairy products. I was previously using another cinnamon bun recipe from this site, but this ooey-gooey recipe is far better bar none! I got several compliments on them. I plan to make them time and again. Thanks so much for this PERFECT recipe!

These were really good.  I used cream cheese frosting ( bought ) and used for icing.  They do get hard quick, but I think that goes for any cinnamon roll recipe.  Very time consuming - especially the 1st time making them

These turned out really well! I didn't have any nuts, and I even ran out of brown sugar so I had to use half white, but they were still good! My friends and I ate half right out of the oven.

My husband loved these but I thought they were just okay. In my opinion, they weren't worth all the time, energy and money that went into it. But it's a good recipe if you want to spend the time on it!

This recipe is excellent! Takes a pretty long time to prepare, but is well worth it--better than any cinnamon buns you could buy. Some reviewers suggested doubling the filling, but I would highly recommend NOT doing that: I had a bit too much as it was! I also didn't use 4 cups of flour, but only 3-1/2 as that was all it needed. So, double the recipe 'cause they'll disappear fast!

Wow! yummy is the best word for these dreamy little buns! - I doubled both the topping and the filling and was rewarded with delicious sweet cinnamon taste. Judging from the reaction from my 3 and 4 year olds (they are dancing around while eating!) I'll be keeping this recipe close!! Thank you!

Absolutely fantastic!  I added a bit more goo, and also threw in some currants.  These are the first cinnamon buns I've ever made, and quite possibly the best I've ever had.

These are fine as "ooey-gooey" buns, but were not cinnamoney enough; which was disapointing when we were really hoping for cinnamon rolls.  However, as sticky buns, these taste fine.

AMAZING!  
I used dark brown sugar for the bottom of the pan mixture, and will try yellow sugar next time as it was very dark and rich.  But I will still use dark brown sugar inside the rolls.  Worth the wait!

Always an excellent turnout.  My family loves this as a special treat.  They are great even when reheated in the microwave days afterwards, though they never stick around for long.

Very delicious, fluffly dough. Excellent recipe. However, I didn't find them all that ooey gooey inside. I will add more filling (brown sugar & cinnamon) next time. Other than that, they were fantastic!!

The taste was pretty good but there seemed to be something missing. They were not as gooey and sweet as I would of wished. It's really a matter of how you like your buns. If you like them buttery and flaky this one is for you!
