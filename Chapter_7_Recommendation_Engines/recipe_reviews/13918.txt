This best thing I can say about this recipe is that it wont clutter up my recipe box any more. If it had any taste I could say it tasted bad but it doesn't, If it had any life to it I could say it died but it doesn't, if it had any sice to it i could say it is bland but it doesnt. So if you are looking for a tasteless no life meal that has no spice in it at all try this one.

This is not at all authentic. Firstly, you must use palm suger in place of white suger. Secondly, a 1:1 ratio of fish sauce and lime juice should be added right after the noodles are added to the wok. Chopped, fried garlic and "prik kee neuw" (thai hot peppers) give pad thai that hot flavor, which is incidently a western convention applied to this dish.

Phad Thai doesn't need to be spicy to be Phad Thai.  This recipe was quite bland and had no typical phad Thai taste.  It tastes like an American recipe trying to be Asian.

I love traditional Pad Thai, and no this is not it. However When you want a Pad Thai fix and you also need your kids to be able to eat it. This does the trick. I do not agree this is flavorless. It makes me wonder if they are using fresh lime and fresh cilantro. Yes I do add fish sauce too.
My kids love this version and I still get my "Pad Thai" I just add my authentic thai chili sauce from our local thai store to my own dish and it is great!!!!
If you want real Pad Thai, that is what restrants are for!

This is not traditional Pad Thai. We found this much too sweet, and set off the flavours.

The Phad Thai from this recipe was bland-absolutely non spicy unlike the real phad thai-maybe some onions and chilli peppers will spice it up..

I liked this recipe! It turned out really well and my group really liked it too. I am more carnivorous when it comes to eating but this recipe was magnifique! I would greatly approve of usage of this recipe in the future! (terriyaki sauce is really good in this recipe too) *wink*

Tastes terrible-nothing like the traditional Phad-Thai, which is orange in color and slightly sweeter.

When I made this I changed a few things and added some chilies for flavor, my husband and brother liked it, but it wasn't like what we got at the local Thai restaurant.

While it may not be authentic, I find it to be a nice base for Pad Thai. It leaves alot of room to play with and it's nice to see vegetarian recipes.

I didn't really like it and I'm a fan of Chinese food.  The taste wasn't all that good.  Too sweet...just not right.

I made it exactly as the recipe is, but I found it to be bland for my tastes, so I added Siracha. But the rest of my family loved it.  Even my old-fashioned meat and potatoes husband.

The thing with this recipe is that it works best as a basic Pad Thai recipe that you can put your own spin on. Want spice? Add in you're favorite spices. Want it to have some meat in it.?Add some! I personally love Vegetarian meals, but adding shrimp made it more appealing to my siblings. Red pepper flakes were a great addition, and a bit of fish sauce. Maybe another splash of the soy sauce.
