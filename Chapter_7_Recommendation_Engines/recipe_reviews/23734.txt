I LOVE this recipe and make it more often than I should admit.  We even served it at our wedding.  I have yet to meet someone who didn't rave about it.  I do make a few very minor changes:  I use raspberries instead of grapes (just for personal preference), thawed frozen peaches instead of fresh white ones, and I warm up one of the ingredients in the microwave (usually the lemonade concentrate) to dissolve the sugar into it before adding it to the mix.  Note:  This is VERY good, VERY easy to drink, and VERY intoxicating!  Unless you want everyone at your party drunk after a drink or two, I suggest serving it with 7up or sparkling water (1:1 ratio).  It makes the drink a touch bubbly, takes nothing from the taste, and helps it go down a little slower. ;-)

I modified this recipe a little, based on other reviews.  For example, peach schnapps instead of vodka, frozen peaches instead of fresh, and no grapes at all.  It was really delicious.  I am thinking this would be perfect in the summertime.  Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent  Sangria!  Light, refeshing, perfect for summer evenings!!!  Added 1/4 cup peach schnapps to the recipe for a more "peachy" taste.  Changed the ratio of grapes to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup blueberries for additional color.  Leave overnight in the fridge no longer than 24 hours.  Anything more and your peaches become mush. This Sangria packs a power punch so please be careful...  as other reviewers have suggested, you might want to "cut" it with ginger ale or club soda to avoid face first encounters with the floor.  Enjoy!

This was big hit!  I made the traditional red sangria and the white sangria.  Everyone loved the red but asked for seconds on the white.  Very easy to make and worth making.  Everyone requested a copy of the recipe.

5 stars with my tweaks: I omitted the sugar, used Peach Schnapps, and sliced white nectarines as I wasn't a fan of the fuzzy peach skin in my drink. I let it sit for almost 24 hours before serving it over ice and frozen grapes cut with a 1:1 ratio of Ginger Ale. The drink was smooth and the fruit was deadly. Guests loved it!

I made this for a casual wedding reception with a Mexican theme and it was a huge hit.  I used Peach schnapps instead of vodka.  I left it in the fridge overnight at least 12 to 18 hours and it was excellent. The fruits had time to soak up the liquor and were absolutely wonderful. I made the Classic Spanish Sangria for red and this one for the white Sangria. They were both excellent but this one was the favorite. This is a definate keeper and the only White Sangria I'll ever make.

Absolutely love this.  Use hard fruits like apples, pears, mango's, and grapes.  Soft fruits will get mushy.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe for Sangrias. It reminds me of Olive Garden's Sangrias. The liquior stores in my town did not have peach vodka so I got peach schnapps. I used a bag of frozen peaches (1 lbs), 1 cup of red seedless grapes (because to me they are oh so much better than green grapes), and about 1 - 1 1/2 cups strawberries. I refrigerated it for 12 hours or longer. With the left over fruit I decided to freeze it and use it for ice cubes in the glasses next time I make these and yes there will be a next time. I do think I will add about three kiwis next time as well. That will be beautiful. This drink would be great for a pool party. Enjoy! WOW!

Fantasitc drink for a summer party.
I used a Pino Grigio ,sliced apples, peaches and grapes.
Also, could not find peach vodka a great substitution was 1/2 cup peach schnapps and 1/4 cup brandy.

I tripled this yummy recipe! I used 3 bottles of pinot grigio, 2 cups peach vodka, 1 cup reg vodka (100 proof!), 1 whole can frozen lemonade concentrate, 3/4 cups of sugar and tossed in peaches and strawberries.  You MUST let this sit overnight - it is a different beverage if you don't and not nearly as good.  I cut the sangria with fresca right before serving it.  I poured the fresca into the bottom of the glass (about 1/3) and then filled the rest with sangria and fruit - so yummy!  Two glasses will definitely get you quite buzzed so be careful!  I sent my grandma home slurring on mother's day! :-)

I made this last year for a family gathering and again this year for a lady's lunch. For the lady's lunch, I substituted peach schnapps for the peach vodka and it gave it a more fruity taste. Works well with white zinfandel wine also.

This is by far the best white sangria in existence.  I've tweaked it to perfection...  Use Absolut Pear vodka instead of peach, use 5 tbs of froz lemonade concentrate and cut back on the sugar.  I use a 1 lb bag of frozen sliced peaches, and omit the grapes and use fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries instead.  You could use frozen blueberries or raspberries/blackberries too.  If you do, it'll make the sangria more pink.  Also, any cheap pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc will do.  Every time I make it, I get RAVE reviews.  Make sure to double or triple your batch because everyone will want it and it'll go quickly.

I have made this twice for large groups and it was a huge hit! Refreshing and deliciously different from red sangria. I took the advice of other reviewers and added ginger ale- one litre per 750ml bottle of wine. My wine of choice is pinot grigio. You will not be disappointed and your guests will rave about this perfect summertime party beverage!

I used one bottle of 2009 barefoot moscato, peach schnapps instead of vodka, and omitted the sugar and grapes. Added two cans of ginger ale and it was AMAZING!! Perfect drink to sip on at the pool.

GREAT summer beverage, a big hit at my cookout.  I used peach schnapps instead of vodka.  Chilled for 24-hours and served with a 1:1 ratio of 7-up (added the soda right before serving).    I used pinot grigio, fresh peaches and raspberries (instead of grapes).  The raspberries turned the sangria a pretty pink.    Will definitely make again, delicious !

Wow!  I love sangria but this is WAY too much alcohol!  I kept reviewing the recipe to see if I missed some type of soda or something to dilute!  If you want your guests to get hammered, this is the recipe for you!

Phenomenal Sangria!  We doubled the recipe and used Pinot Grigio and substituted black berries and raspberries for the grapes.  We used absolut peach vodka not schnapps.  We used 1 pound of frozen peaches and 2 fresh peaches as well as an apple.  We made one batch with sugar and one batch without (the drink was sweet enough either way, I personally think the sugar is unnecessary).  We only got to chill this for about 5 hours before the party, but it went very fast, everyone really loved it.  The next time I make this, I will use a mango and a kiwi as well.  Excellent submission.

Used gallon of Chardonnay and entire bottle of peach schnapps, entire can of lemonade and upped the simple syrup accordingly and dumped it into a large punch bowl. My company loved it.  Frozen peaches keep it cool.  No need to make ahead of time.  Also, added a quart of ginger ale to keep everyone from getting sloshed.  A real hit and a lovely presentation! Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic!  I used vodka and peach schnapps, totaling 3/4 cup.  If you use schnapps like some of the reviewers suggested, you don't need as much sugar.  I didn't know what to expect making it last minute, but all my guests, loved this. Triple this recipe, at a minimum!  If you prefer a less sweet drink, add a splash of sparkling water.

This was a great, summery, refreshing, original recipe! I'm not too big on sweet, though, so instead of the lemonade concentrate, I used a few tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Added the right amount of tang, without adding extra sweetness.

First time making sangria and this was so easy!  Not to mention so good!  The only alteration I made was frozen peaches rather than fresh as that is what I had on hand!  Will definitely make this again....tomorrow!!!

I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at my house and made this punch, it went over so well! Everyone loved it, I even found that the usual beer drinkers were opting for this punch instead! I omitted the grapes and used fresh rasberries in their place, I also opted to use frozen peaches instead of the fresh. I left out the sugar all together and used unflavored vodka instead of the peach, also and as suggested by others i cut it with a 2 liter of ginger ale. It was absolutely perfect and I can't wait to make it again! Thank you for the recipe!

This is an AWESOME drink, but as another reviewer mentioned, it packs a PUNCH!  I've made about 10 batches and my favorite version is without the lemonade concentrate and the grapes. FOLLOW UP YEARS LATER - I can no longer find peach vodka, so I substituted Peach Schnapps.  This is much sweeter than peach vodka and the sugar (splenda)is NOT needed.  Much better without!

This is a great Sangria!  I've served it several times and am always asked for the recipe.  It's also a nice alternative to the traditional red wine sangria when you want something a little lighter and fruitier.

SOOOOO good!!!  Even better than normal sangria.  I made it for Valentines day, and we both loved it.  I did change a few things: I used 1/2 peach schnaaps and 1/2 brandy instead of peach vodka (the brabdy adds the perfect kick), fewer peaches, raspberries instead of grapes, no sugar, and 3 Tab. crystal light lemmonade powder instead of concentrate.  Still a little on the sweet side, so next time, I'll only use about a Tab. of lemmon stuff, or maybe just fresh squeezed lemon, since my boyfriend doenst like fruity drinks.  But we still both loved this!!!  definatly recomended :)

This sangria was really delicous. I made it with fresh strawberries and frozen instead of fresh peaches as recommended by others. I too omitted the sugar and cut this half and half with ginger ale because i was taking it to an afternoon party. Many people commented on how tasty it was!

I used 2 bottles of white wine, 3/4 of a cup of a good German apricot schnapps, 1/2 Grand Marnier and sliced up 5 white peaches. It was potent and delicious.

Similar to a recipe I make, only I use peach schnapps rather than vodka, and Limoncello rather than lemonade.  I also add ginger ale. Best if refrigerated overnight.

We really enjoyed this.  I liked the peach / wine combination.  Couldn't find peach-flavored vodka though so we substituted peach schnappes.

Loved, loved loved this! Had a party and served both this and Sangria a la Las Vegas. If you are looking for inexpensive serving containers for sangria, Anchor Hocking has 3 sizes of glass jars from about 2 quarts to 2.5 gallons. I bought (2) 2.5 gallon containers. It's nice because it allows to ladle out some fruit in each cup as apposed to spigot beverage servers. It also allows you to store the whole jar in the fridge overnight and you don't have to fuss when you want to serve. I found white organic peaches at Whole Foods and let them ripen a couple days; they were perfect and so pretty. The green and red grapes added a nice touch. I loved the fact this has a peach vodka rather than a sweet liquor and I didn't even add any of the sugar. I did, however, add some lemon lime sparkling water to dilute it a bit. In the ice bucket, I added cubes I froze with lemons & lime wedges in mini muffin cups. Party City has long appetizer forks that were nice to put in the glasses as a stirrer so people can munch on the fruit. I have also made these in small batches to have on hand for tumblers on the boat. It's a great, refreshing summer cocktail everyone seems to enjoy! Thank you for sharing!

DELISH!!!  Used Splenda instead of sugar and used frozen peaches and raspberries and added them right before serving.  Didn't add any grapes.  Also added sprite zero before serving to cut down the alcohol.  Huge hit at my labor day bbq.  Will def make again!!

Yum! Defintiely a keeper! I brought this to a birthday party and received many compliments. As others suggested, I added some Fresca so it wasn't too strong.  I'm not a fan of slimy-textured fruit in sangria, so I only added fresh apples to the mix.  I provided a variety frozen fruit instead of ice cubes (which actually was pretty interesting because you got a different flavor depending on the fruit you used).  Some fruit still got slimy as it melted, but at least you could pick and choose what you put in.  For extra peach flavor, I added some peach juice (found at Trader Joe's).  Thanks for sharing!!

I have been making this sangria for the past two summers and have given out this recipe so many times, I can't count.  The only alteration I make is to add cut up apples, which are usually the favorite fruit in it.  The apples add a good flavor with the wine, soak up the alcohol and taste delicious!

This turned out really good! I didn't have peach vodka (or brandy or schnapps) so I used Welch's white grape-peach juice instead. Mixed it with pinot grigio white wine until I could taste it (I would say I added about 1 cup or so). This also cut down on the alcohol content. I used pure lemon juice instead of concentrate (not as much-- juice from 1 lemon for each bottle), and added apples, peaches, and raspberries. The apples are really good in it! I recommend doubling the recipe (we got ~7-8 glasses out of 2 bottles of wine).

I will definitely be making this again!!

I doubled the recipe except the sugar (used 1/4 cup). I added a few more tablespoons of the lemonade concentrate instead. I finally found Peach Vodka (Absolut brand). This makes you wish that peaches were in season all year round! Careful...it's got a kick to it! This Sangria not only tastes great but the presentation is very impressive. Make sure to make it in advance. There is a huge difference in the flavor if you don't let the fruit sit. Everyone loved this refreshing drink.

I made this and the "Sangria! Sangria'l recipe for a party. This was the first to go. I used tips from other commenters (MDH12 & RG1) and used peach schnapps instead of vodka and added raspberries. I did use fresh peaches and nectaries. My husband kept eating all the fruit. There was little left for our guests. Was really refreshing and peachy and perfect for our Summer Solstice Celebration!

This was so good! I made this AND my regular red sangria recipe for a party, and this was the one that was gone at the end of the night! I didn't have peach vodka, so i substituted with passion fruit vodka instead. Also, I had tripled this recipe, and added 2L of ginger ale. It added a touch of fizz, and cut the potency a bit!

Made this for a 'girls night in' and was a huge hit!  I used pino grigio, peach schnapps vs. peach vodka and added a little club soda before serving.  Also used a bag of frozen fruit.  Was told by all to 'not change a thing'.

This stuff is amazing.  I can never bring enough to any event.  The only unfortunate thing is everyone tends to drink more than they should, and they feel horrible the next day.  Which wine you use makes a big difference for this sangria.  I use St. Francis chardonnay.  Just be sure you drink it within a day or two.  It does not keep well.

Love this recipe, it is seriously addicting!  I introduced it to my mom and a good friend and all three of us have been making it for a few years now.  Great hit at parties!  I like to make mine with peaches and strawberries.

I had 2 small glasses and suffered the next morning with a headache...  I guess it was good... it certainly tasted good...
I used a very nice semi-dry white wine, peach schnapps instead of vodka and no sugar due to the sweetness of th schnapps.  Everything else as directed by the recipe.  

Ate quite a few peaches ...  maybe that caused the headache... they were soaked in schnapps and wine..  Will try this one again... maybe I'll just have one glass next time.

Made this Friday night and it was delicious!! I used a Pinot Grigio and peach schnapps (what I had) and it was really fantastic.  When I make this again I will probably cut the sugar the schnapps and fruit made it pretty sweet.

Excellent drink.
 I made some modifications myself. I used canned peaches instead (as they are not in season for my area) and they worked perfectly, I also drained them and did not use the juice. I also added fresh cherries, strawberries, blackberries and raspberries as well. I also added less sugar to taste instead of the 1/4 cup to make it less sweet as the vodka already adds sugar to the mix.
 This is an absolutely wonderful drink and is the first thing to be finished at parties or dinners.

Good.  Used peach schnapps, regular peaches, red grapes, and strawberries.  I only used one peach as when I started slicing the peaches...they just weren't very good.  Added seltzer water to serve.

I used peach schnapps instead of the vodka and also added 1/2 liter of club soda to water it down a little for my party goers :)  Everyone LOVED it and raved about it days after my party.  I was asked for the recipe over & over.  Thanks!

I made this for a party, and at least half the people there asked me what was in it. It was really easy to make with frozen peaches and peach schnapps instead of the vodka + sugar. I also threw in some quartered strawberries instead of red grapes, and the fruit floated sort of in layers, which looked pretty. Thanks for a great recipe!

This as amazing! I read other reviews and followed the advice. Used peach schnappes instead of the vodka and halved the sugar (made a simple syrup so it was better blended) and also added seltzer because this can definitely sneak up on you. Raspberries, peaches, grapes, and strawberries finished it off. Was a huge hit. Doubled the recipe for 4 people and it was still not enough!

Wow, this is AMAZING!  Made a big batch for last summer's annual party and everyone raved about it.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I'm sure it would be good with other fruits as well.  It's like ambrosia of the Gods.  I can't wait for this year's party.

Delicious! I cut down on the sugar and used pink lemonade, but it is fantastic. I have been searching for this drink recipe on drink websites, to no avail. Love Allrecipes.com and this drink is a toast to them.

I followed the other suggestions on here and used raspberries instead of grapes, thawed frozen peaches instead of fresh white ones, and peach schnapps instead of vodka. Delish!!! Great summer Sangria!

Out of this world!  I used peach schnapps and frozen fruit as recommended by some others.  Went way too quickly.  Will definitely make again, but just much more next time.

This was wonderful! But cut the sugar or omit it completely! Used frozen peaches and raspberries and use peach schnapps instead of vodka. I also used club soda to mix it it with as gingerale would have been too sweet! Pour 2 more bottles of wine into the container as it was getting low and it was still good!

I made this recipe for my labor day bbq and it was a HUGE hit! it was gone in no time. I could not find white peaches at my grocery store so i used 2 regular peaches and also frozen raspberries instead of grapes. i made it the day before the party so the flavors would blend together more. the only thing i would have changed, is that i had made more!

I made this for a summer BBQ on a very HOT day which required cool refreshing beverages.  This Sangria recipe was a disaster.  Too strong, and not refreshing at all. I made a gallon and threw away almost the whole thing at the end of the day.  Not one of my 27 wine loving guests enjoyed it.  This recipe needed to be diluted with something.....

Very good! This would be 5 stars I'm sure, but I made some changes. Will re-rate when I try the original. I used nectarines and raspberries, and also added a 1/2 cup of triplesec. Cut with 7-up before serving. Deeeelish!

This is insanely amazing!  I made it one time in the beginning of the summer and since then everyone asks me for the recipe.  Instead of the white sugar, I lightened it up with 3 cups of sprite zero.  Also, I added all kinds of fruit including apples and oranges.  DELICIOUS!  But it creeps up on you so watch out!

A summertime favorite! I love it made with Absolute Mango vodka. Adding a spritz of diet Sprite or 7-Up does make it a bit less intoxicating. Enjoy carefully!

Best Ever! I used frozen peaches & omitted the grapes & added blackberries instead (because they were on sale).  I also didn't have peach vodka so I used mango-flavored rum. I made a 5 gallon bucket of this for my birthday party & there was not one drop left! Absolutely to die for!!!

I've made this recipe several times.  I use 1/2 peach schnapps and 1/2 vodka because we don't usually have peach vodka around.  I don't like the way fruit separates (peaches float and grapes sink), so I've been using raspberries and peaches instead.  Looks beautiful in a glass pitcher and a big hit at summer parties!

I had to do a couple of things differently because I wanted to make this for a 4th of July BBQ and didn't have time to locate all the ingredients...I had to improvise a little with what my local supermarket had.

They didn't have peach vodka so I bought regular vodka and a bottle of white cranberry peach cocktail. I followed the recipe and then added the juice to taste. They also did not have white peaches so I had to substitute regular, tree-ripe peaches. 

I had one peach and some grapes leftover, so I cut the peach into chunks and put the fruit on toothpicks, sprinkled with white sugar, then stuck them in the freezer so that people could add them to their drinks if they wanted.

Came out pretty well!

Sooo good. AND this is one of those great recipes that looks as good as it tastes! I accidentally doubled the vodka in this recipe (I swear, it WAS an accident) Also, I couldn't find peach vodka! So I used regular Absolut instead - and this was still delicious. Served this in a clear glass pitcher - so beautiful & so very tasty & EASY to make! I love it. Thanks.

Very good! Not a hit like the classic spanish sangria on this site was though. But very good and was still gone in the end. Made a double batch and used the peach schnapps/brandy recommendations which was great. Also used raspberries with the peaches & grapes. Grapes went uneaten in the end, so may use other fruits in the next batch

Love this! I made the recipe as it is the first time and it was great but I added frozen peaches instead of fresh. The next time I added mixed berries as well. Makes it look really pretty and gives it some nice color! Instead of plain vodka, I use either peach schnapps or peach vodka. It seems to be a bit sweet with the recipe as it is, so I like to add sparkling water to it to taste :) this drink will hit you so good!

I've made this several times experimenting based on what other reviewers have said. I think the last time I made it was the best. I use any sort of white wine, 1/2 cup peach vodka, 1/4 cup peach schnapps, 1/4 cup brandy. I also omit the sugar as the alcohol has so much sugar you don't need any more. For fruit I use 1 peach and half an apple. I'll also throw in grapes or raspberries if I have any on hand. We add a few splashes of ginger ale or Sprite to each glass when serving. Delicious!

I made this sangria for a party and everyone LOVED it!  I used Anakena Viognier Tama Vineyards Selection for wine and Absolute Apeach vodka. I also used half the recommended sugar. To help keep it chilled throughout the party I froze some extra whole grapes.

Holy sockawoza (is that even a word lol??!!??!!)!!! This was absolutely FANTASTIC. I'm not a fan of wine and therefore have never liked sangria, but recently my hubs (who LOVES wine) introduced me to moscato. I know moscato is not usually the wine of choice for sangria, but since this is the only wine I will drink and I REALLY wanted to try this recipe, I gave it a whirl. My husband gave me serious slack, warning that I was going to "ruin" this (and a good bottle of wine) but I forged ahead - and I'm SOOO glad I did! This change, along with my substitution of peach schnapps (for the vodka called for), using frozen (sliced) peaches instead of fresh ones and omitting the green grapes (I used all red ones) and sugar alltogether produced the most wonderfully balanced, fruity (and potent!) sangria EVER! My neighbor-gal pals couldn't get enough lol! NOTE: To make a weaker cocktail, top off individual glasses of sangria with sparkling water, club soda or giner ale (although the latter will make an already sweet drink even sweeter). If you are looking for an incredible drink with a good buzz backing, this is the one to try. In fact, Iv'e been asked to make another batch for our 4th of July block party next week! Thanks SO much for sharing this dangerously delicious recipe, FOODINC5! :-)

WOW this is my new favorite Sangria!!  I made it this weekend for a Graduation Party, I made 7 gallons believe it or not and every drop was GONE!!!  This was the hit of the party! I did substitute Peach Schnapps for the vodka, and I omitted the white sugar all together, it was plenty sweet without it! I used frozen fruit and let it sit overnight, delish!  We topped off each glass with Ginger Ale before serving....the other reviewers we SO right, this drink sneaks up on ya!!  Make this....you will LOVE it!!!

This recipe was delicious!  A huge hit between my girlfriend and I.  I used Kendall Jackson Chardonnay and peach schnapps instead of the vodka.  I left out the frozen lemonade and just added ginger ale to the mix.  Instead of the grapes I cut up apples and used frozen peaches.  The drink was very refreshing!  I can't wait to make it again!

Such a great Sangria!  The best one Ive made by far!  I just bought some cheapy wine for this, arbor mist sangria flavored, and I used peach schnapps instead of vodka.  I will try it with the vodka next time!  I also used different fruit of what I had, mandarin oranges w/ a little juice, frozen blueberries and strawberries.  Absolutely delish!  I almost drank the whole pitcher myself!  It's really versatile with different fruits.  Thanks so much for this great Sangria recipe!  It will be great this summer for backyard cookouts!  UPDATE:  I made this again with the peach vodka and also added in some pineapple and mango liqueurs.  Wow, it was so good!  It gave it an extra punch from the vodka being added.  Absolutely the best sangria ever!

this sangria is a fave with my friends! because it is flavored with peach vodka instead of peach shnapps, it packs a sneaky punch! i sometimes add some sprite to tone down the strength of the liquor, or at least I provide the sprite and a warning to my friends.

I served these at a dinner party and less than an hour later they had drained the pitchers and were digging in the pitcher for the peaches!  I let them "sit & chill" in the fridge for about 8-9 hours before I served them.

Doubled the recipe and made for a halloween party.  I used peach schnapps and heated the lemonade concentrate with the sugar to make sure it dissolved.  Also added an entire bag of frozen peaches and ommitted the grapes.  I made it 12 hours in advance and added 4 cups of gingerale just before serving. I made this and a red sangria and this was gone first, was a huge hit at the party.

Really good, I used Peach Schnapps lessened the sugar and added a bit of ginger ale, cause I didn't want everyone to be hammered.  We drank it all. It was light and peachy and yummy.

Delish!!!! Made this for a bridal shower & the ladies couldn't get enough. Used Peach Schnapps instead of vodka & added plain seltzer just before serving. I also soaked the fruits (peaches, apples grapes & strawberries) in wine overnight so everyone had a fruity treat with a little extra kick in their glass!

I made this White Peach Sangria for a girl's night at the cabin, and it was delicious!  I made it exactly as directed, and my friends and I were fighting over the last few grapes at the bottom of the punch bowl!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I omitted the grapes, used nectarines instead of peaches, replaced the vodka with peach Schnapps, doubled the recipe, and added 1 liter of ginger ale.  Perfection...not a drop left.

All at the party loved this. Made w/ peach vodka and omitted sugar and added small amount of brandy. Frozen peaches work great and can even add a variety of frozen fruit.  I served w/ ginger ale and still deadly because it tastes so good!

Amazing. This was a big hit. Admittedly, I drank most of it myself at a BBQ last weekend, the fruit is wonderful addition. I also doubled the recipe and added a bottle of champagne in place of the second bottle of wine. It is sweet and refreshing. Watch out for the grapes on the bottom of the pitcher, they'll give you a punch.

Peach a Licious! This was really delicious and I also made some changes according to the other reviews. Peach Schnapps (NO Sugar), just added the concentrated lemonade. Sliced up peaches, apples and some oranges, and we were good to go! I had to double up the batch, it was that good!

Holy hang-over.  This drink will kick your butt if you're not careful.  I made it last night for a group of friends and it was a hit! A few convenient modifications I made: I omitted the sugar - there's already enough in there anyway. Added a cup of peach vodka to every bottle of white wine.  I let the vodka and white wine soak the fruit (I used grapes and peaches as recommended with apples).  Then, when I poured the drinks I added a touch of lemonade to the top (the pre-made lemonade you can find at Trader Joes).  YUMMY!

Delicious! I used peach schnapps and then added some vodka for a kick. For the wine I used pino grigio. You need to double the recipe or it will go very quickly. I took some suggestions and used frozen peaches and frozen strawberries, however, I left the grapes out. Will make again and again. Everyone loved it!

Used peach schnapps instead of peach vodka, cut back a little on the sugar, added a can of club soda. Also added strawberries which gave the drink a lovely blush. It was a big hit at the weekend bbq. Very delicious and very refreshing. Extra peaches and strawberries at the bottom of the sangria pitcher ended up on my vanilla ice-cream the next day... very nice.

I used a peach flavored wine which turned out great, but I'm sure just the white wine would be good too.  You'll want to (at least) double this recipe!!!!!

Excellent Recipe - Great for parties and for the beach!  I modified the recipe to use half vodka and half peach schnaps.  If fresh white peaches are not available, you can also substitute with frozen or canned peaches.

I just made this sangria for my sisters baby shower. I used a 5 liter box of Pinot Grigio and adjusted the other quantities accordingly. I replaced peach vodka for peach schnapps like many other reviewers did. Since the schnapps is much sweeter, I halved the amount of white sugar. I must say.... The women RAVED about the sangria. Many people told me it was the hands down BEST sangria they ever had. I'm pregnant myself and very sad I didn't even try it out but my husband was my tester and said it was awesome as well. Oh, I added about 4 liters 7-up and one liter seltzer right before serving it. Next time I won't put grapes in it as they sank to the bottom and got stuck near the spout. But I'm very impressed with this recipe.  Next time I will have to use about two or three boxes of wine since it went super quick.

Alright, peeps, this stuff is pretty awesome, although I used strawberries instead of grapes and peach schnapps instead of the peach vodka. I served it half and half with ginger ale. HOWEVER.... we ended up adding some UV Cake vodka to it, and OMG!! It was soooo delish! Definitely be careful with this one! :)

Love this recipe.  I tripled it and made some modifications as per other suggestions: 10 cups moscato wine (since this was a sweet wine, I did not use the sugar), 1 cup peach vodka, 1.25 c schnapps, entire 12 oz container of lemonade, 3 lbs peaches, 1 pint blueberries.  Next time will add some watermelon too.

I love sangria and I was so looking forward to try this recipe and finally made it.  I was very disappointed!  I used peach schnapps and omitted grapes since a local store didn't have any but many reviewers said they also used peach schnapps instead of vodka and used only peach and/or add other fruits and everyone seemed to love it anyways.  I brought it to my friend who lives next door, thinking maybe it's just me who didn't care for the taste and he said it tasted like a cheap wine cooler.  Perfect description, except all these ingredients weren't cheap at all...

I made this for a party and ended up doubling all the alcohol. Made plenty, and there was still plenty of fruit. Feel like this is way too much fruit for the liquid they recommend

Amazing! I made this for a party and doubled everything.  I added the whole can of frozen lemonade, half of a bottle of sparkling seltzer, strawberries, blackberries and frozen peaches.  I also used peach schnapps instead of vodka, as it was on hand.  It was delightful and perfect, I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!  I used peach schnapps in place of the vodka and cut back on the sugar.  I took other reviewers suggestions and added some club soda; otherwise it could really sneak up on you!  (You can't stop at one glass).

This continues to be my go-to recipes to make for all BBQs. I made 3 gallons for a pig roast yesterday and it was a hit. I use frozen tropical fruit blend (peaches, mangoes, pineapple, and strawberries) which makes this incredibly easy to make!

I LOVE this!  I used a bottle of Pinot Grigio.  I didn't have peach-flavored vodka so I used regular Smirnoff, but I bet the peach-flavored makes it even better.  I also added a couple extra teaspoons of frozen lemonade mix, and I didn't have grapes on hand so I used raspberries and sliced apples in their place.  Served over ice mixed with club soda and a few slices of peach and it is delicious - but drink it slow!

I love this! I've made it 3 times now and it gets rave reviews each time.  I use peach schnaaps (had on hand) and concentrated apple juice.  (can't handle acidic juices)  Thank you for sharing, it's a keeper!  Sometimes I mix some with diet 7up over ice.  Fabulous!

Incredible summer drink.  I used the peach schnaupps as others suggested.  I use the entire can of lemonade concentrate.  Since I use a boxed wine I refill the lemonade container (375ml) 2 times with wine to equal one traditional bottle of wine (750ml).  Yum, yum, yum.

This is a "stealth" drink -- people will drink it on a hot summer day like it's fruit punch, and then, because of the vodka, they will all start getting a little tipsy and start to wonder why!  Even the grandma at the party was having a good time within fifteen minutes!

Couldn't find peach vodka, so I used mandarin vodka.  Used peaches and raspberries, but I think you could use whatever fruit you have on hand it it would still be awesome.

Love this recipe a huge hit during the summer. Prepare as instructed but with no grapes, then serve them martini sytle, rim a glass with lemon sugar and garnishwith a slice of peach! Leftovers? put them in the freezr and serve granita style.

Soooooo good!  I found the peach vodka at BevMo and it is wonderful.  Followed the recipe exactly. My friends kept asking for more and more.  Not really a wine person so asked for advice at Trader Joes and they rec. a sauv blanc (their brand for $2.99 a bottle) enjoy!

This was very yummy!  It is perfect for a warm summer evening.  I couldn't find peach vodka so I used peach schnapps instead.  The only thing I will do differently next time is use less peaches and freeze the grapes.

I've made this drink more then once now and definetly prefer the peach schnapps instead of the vodka. I also put in some fresh raspberries in place of the red grapes. Doesn't alter the taste much, but does brighten it up a bit and makes it more summery looking.

YUM!  This is incredible and so easy to make.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used peach schnapps instead of the vodka (also because I couldn't find peach vodka).  I added a bag of frozen sliced peaches and omitted the grapes.  I believe we will be serving this as our signature cocktail at our wedding reception! :)

Made this in a huge tub for my wedding reception. We used nectarines instead of peaches and added mangos. People who make sangria often suggested making it 48 hours in advance for flavors to mix thoroughly. Guests loved it and gave many compliments. Beware - this tastes fantastic so it's easy to get drunk without realizing it.

I used pinot grigio, 1 lb Dole frozen fruit (mango, peach, pinapple & strawberry mix), NO sugar, 1/4 can of frozen lemonade, 1/4 bottle (750 ml) peach schnapps, soaked fruit for 24 hrs, and I served it in a punch bowl and I added 1 12 oz can of 7-up. I made for bunco night and it was a HUGE hit..I made 4x the recipe and had only a little bit left over!

I recently made this for a wedding shower.  We went through 1 1/2 gallons of wine and a handle of vodka.  Wow!  Only changes - I used splenda instead of sugar and frozen peaches instead of fresh.  I used Rossi Chenin White Wine and Absolut Peach Vodka.  Definitely will make this again and again...

so delicious... normally I like to make the recipe as stated rather than change it the first time but I've never heard of peach vodka and I think peach schnapps is GROSS so I used a mixture of blueberry Smirnoff and Stoli Razberi since that's what I had on hand. OMG was it good! hit of my housewarming party. used sliced white peaches and gala apples plus a pint of blueberries. everyone asked for the recipe!

Great bones on this recipe.... a bit of tweaking made it perfect for me! I added one cup of peach schnapps and half a cup of peach tequila, omited the sugar and put in 1 plus cups of Sprite/7Up/Soda. Hmmm ... definitely a keeper!

Overall this is a great recipe.  When made as the directions stated I thought it came across too peachy, so I added a bottle of club soda and the whole can of lemonade concentrate.  Since it is mid March peaches are hard to come by so I used a bag of frozen peaches and a bag of mixed berries, I also sliced up some limes as well.  It was very pretty and tasty to boot!

This was awesome. But after reading the ingredients and all the other reviews I decided to modify the recipe and add the entire container of frozen lemonade concentrate with the required water and the liquors and 7-up. It was the best I made two gallons for a bridal shower and went like water.

At first sip, I would have rated this 3 1/2 stars, for overwhelming sweetness (I doubled the recipe and used 2 bottles of Two Buck Chuck sauv. blanc, 1 1/4 c. peach schnapps - that could have probably been cut back some - 1 1/2 tsp Crystal Light powder mix, frozen peach slices, red and green grapes and a squirt of lemon juice to try and "tart" it up a bit...didn't dare add any sugar.) After it sat in the fridge overnight, it got much better, and - boy, does it pack a punch! Love the sugg'n of freezing some grapes to ice it down! Took to the pool for a "mommy cocktail" and it did the trick!

Throw some extra whole grapes in the freezer to use as "ice" to keep it nice and chilled on a warm summer evening. I used 1 cup of regular vodka and substituted orange slices for peaches.  I also used splenda in place of sugar and mixed with flavored seltzer to add some low sugar bubbles. Lemon, lime or even berry flavored are all excellent!

This sangria is excellent - I have made it for a number of parties and it is always a hit - we often run out within the first hour!  In order to tame down the potency somewhat, I will add peach juice.  Other types of juices could also be added depending on personal tastes.

There was none left!  I used peach rum instead of vodka, just because that's what I had.  I used a very cheap white wine which ended up working well, but I had to add extra sugar and it had 'marinate' for a long time before the bitterness of the cheap wine wore down.

A delicious and dangerous recipe. I highly recommend making a double batch right away, even the fellas are gonna try this stuff and love it. It'll be gone before you know it. 

PS. I made it once with papaya and white grapes and one mango. It turned out great as well (used regular vodka instead of peach). And I cheat and use frozen peaches all the time...

Strong! I let it sit overnight, and the peaches had quite a kick to them when I served it.  Added 7-Up which help weaken it a bit as well as added a bit of a fizz.

Nice and boozy but don't change a thing.  Just add lots of ice.

I used regular peaches and pink lemonade concentrate.  Allowing it to 'brew' overnight is key.

This recipe is unbelieveably the bomb! Thats the good kind of bomb! So easy to do, we did it for two parties two weekends in a row and everyone raved and both times we didn't make enough! We definitely used the peach vodka and kept the proportions just as the recipe called for. We did find out that not everyone eats all their fruit and when they refill their glass some just add more liquid so you may end up with left-over fruit, but hey, thats almost the best part!

I made this for the first time this summer, and now my friends and family are obsessed. I’m not a big peach person, but this sangria is amazing!

As other reviews have mentioned, it IS strong, so don’t be afraid to mix with some ginger ale. Also, because you are going to have to make a TON (this will go like ice water on a hot day!), I used peach schnapps instead of peach vodka because the schnapps bottle is cheaper.

This recipe is always a hit! I’ve made it many times over the years, and always change it up a little. It always comes out great. I tend to use a dry Chardonnay. I’ll usually use raspberry vodka instead of peach. Sometimes I omit the sugar. I always serve it over ice with club soda and vary the fresh fruit.

I've made this twice now and both times, the whole thing went quickly! It's a great recipe for parties on hot summer days. I do make some tweaks for personal taste. I doubled the recipe both times. The recipe as is comes out very strong. I usually add Ginger Ale or Club Soda (about half a liter) when doubling the recipe. I also add a little water (to taste-- balances out the sweetness). I've used Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. Both come out very good. I also like to use frozen fruit-- it's a time saver! I like frozen peaches and frozen berries. I've also added apples. I let the recipe refrigerate overnight to let the frozen fruit thaw out and for the sangria to absorb all the fruit juices. Also, I highly suggest using peach vodka (I buy Svedka or Absolut but Taaka makes one too). We made it once with peach schnapps as people have suggested and it totally changed the recipe. I learned quickly I'm not a schnapps fan. I think it came out sweeter, and personally, I don't care for it if it's too sweet.

This is a neighborhood favorite; I've made it at least 
a dozen times. However, today I made one boo-boo followed by one necessary change. It turned out amazingly well so thought I would share.  I thought I had peach vodka.  Wrong.  Stores closed.  So I used Peach Schnapps, same amount as the vodka.  Since Schnapps is sweeter than vodka, I eliminated all sugar.  Then the store was out of frozen lemonade concentrate so I went with the only other option - frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate.  Perfection nonetheless!!  I do plan to use peach vodka from now on and adding back the sugar (I cut the sugar in half per our local preferences ) in order to remain true to the recipe.  But the raspberry lemonade was amazing in that it gave a peach hue to the sangria which vodka (or Schnapps for that matter) and regular lemonade does not.  I couldn't detect any raspberry flavor; I just detected delicious peach sangria!!  I will definitely use frozen raspberry lemonade concentrate from now on.  Enjoy this recipe; my neighbors and I sure do!!

I've tried a lot of sangria recipes in the last year. I love sangria! It's not easy to get just right. This is a great recipe! It was a little sweet, but that is not the fault of the recipe. Wines vary greatly in their dryness so the sugar is something you have to play around with. I used Franzia White Zin (box) which is sweet and omitted the sugar. I subbed peach schnapps for the vodka and only used 1/2 c. Threw in a bag of peaches and let it sit overnight. This stuff is awesome! I just poured some into a big wine glass filled with ice and added a splash of club soda. It's amazing!!! Very pretty too with the peaches floating around. I'm putting this into my recipe files under entertainment. Perfect for any kind of shower and I'll add raspberries!

I have made this recipe, and a number of variations, numerous times.  As written I only give it 3 stars.  The lemonade doesn't seem to fit; gives it an off taste. I substitute other fruit juice concentrates, usually apple because it's sweet but fairly neutral. I use more of the concentrate and then just omit the extra sugar.  I usually leave out the grapes, simply because it's too much work, and use frozen peaches.  Also, I have no idea why other reviewers are substituting the peach vodka with peach schnapps!?! You can ADD the schnapps for some extra peach flavor but put real alcohol, not just that syrup!

This wasn't bad, but I will keep looking for a "go-to" white sangria. I admit I followed some of the modifications that other reviewers recommended, and I'm not so sure they were all for the positive. I think peach schnapps may have actually been a bad move, it left a very fake-y peach aftertaste. I also put a berry mix in, which I think muddied the flavors a little too much. This recipe might be best as originally written without modification!

The best sangria hands down! My only recommendation is use peach schnapps instead of vodka. It gives the sangria a sweeter taste. People keep telling me it "taste like kool-aid"! I didn't cut it but it will sneak up on you. Peaches aren't always in season so sometimes I have to use frozen. They fruit always taste better fresh. However if you use frozen make sure they are thoroughly thawed (run under room temperature to thaw quickly). Make sure you let it soak for at least 2 hours longer if the peaches weren't fresh.

This is a delicious, albeit somewhat “deadly” sangria. Super sweet, with a sneaker bite! Always a huge hit at parties, and the first to go! I always use a dry chardonnay (cheap is fine….don’t splurge), and something inexpensive like a Burtnett’s vodka. I’ve tried with more expensive Absolut, but you just cannot tell the difference give the price difference. I’ve made this both with sugar and have also substituted Splenda to clip some calories. I never do the grapes, as they tend to sink and don’t add much flavor. Be sure to let sit overnight to allow the recipe to set. You won’t be disappointed!

Used two 750ml bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, 1c peach schnapps, 1/2c peach vodka, 6 shots of lemoncello, 1 LB of white peaches and some halved red grapes.  I am letting this sit overnight for a party on Friday,  Will be adding some 7 up or Ginger ale and cut up strawberries to this right before I serve it. As it sits now without the Ginger ale, it is Way Strong! It definately needs to be cut w/ soda of your liking.  It also really needs either the frozen lemonade concentrate or Lemoncello.  I would not omit this. I dd however omit the sugar. IMHO it doesn't need it.  Great recipe!! Cheers!

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the drink with soda water.  This is a strong drink even with soda water added!  I did not use grapes.  I used fresh peaches, plums, and blueberries.  I let the Sangria sit for 5 hours in the fridge before serving.  Another reviewer noted the Sangria does not taste good when first mixed and I also found this to be true so do not judge the taste until all the ingredients have time blend.  I will try this recipe again with frozen peaches.

I made this for the first time this weekend.  I doubled this recipe for a girls night with 9 ladies, which was just the right amount.
I made it with peach schnapps instead of the vodka.  Per other reviewers, I did not use as much sugar.  I used frozen peaches, grapes and added pears and apples.  I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator and before serving added the 1:1 ratio of seagrams ginger ale.  It actually tasted a lot like a moscato d'asti, which most of my guests really like.  Good recipe - will make again!

This was a big hit at a big bar b q I had on one of the hottest days of the year! It was a beautiful addition to the table but I wasn't sure how it would be accepted so I'd make one up with ice, a peach slice, a few raspberries, and a fresh mint leave...and I'd say, Try this, and they'd say, Oh Yum!  I couldn't keep up!

This is wonderful.  Used moscato wine, peach schnapps and frozen fruit.  Did not add sugar, as the wine is sweet.  Top is off with a splash of lemon/lime soda.  Will make often.

LOVED this sangria. Big hit for all at a summer pool party. I took some of the suggestions of others and used peach schnapps instead of peach vodka, frozen peaches instead of fresh, and added some 7-Up to cut the strength a bit. Rave reviews from all and sharing the recipe already. Can't wait for the next pool party - which may just be me sitting poolside. :)

Excellent drink though I did make some changes. I made 12 servings and used 1 bottle of Bellini (750) and 1 bottle of white white wine (750 - Pinot Grigio) then added 3/4 cup of vodka and 3/4 cup peach schnapps. The peaches were not in totally ripe yet and they still worked perfectly.

AWESOME!!! I followed other reviewers and used peach schnapps instead of vodka. It was strong so I added some seltzer when i served it. I used frozen peaches, green grapes, granny smith and gala apples. Everyone loved it! Will be making this again.

I made this for a Memorial Day weekend cookout and all of us loved it. I served it with appetizers and everyone wanted the fruit after the sangria was gone.  I let it chill for 6 hours and it came out perfect.  I plan on making it again this weekend!

I just made this Sangria for my sisters Bridal Shower and it was an incredible HIT!  It was gone before we got the games started and I made enough for 50 people!  I did add lime flavored mineral water for a little carbonation.  It turned out Fantastic and everybody loved it!

This sangria recipe is amazing!  I've made it many times and everyone loves it!  You can make it as light as you want by adding more club soda...or less for a bit stronger!  Either way, it's FANTASTIC!

My friends have come to expect me to bring this whenever we have a warm weather gathering.  As a matter of fact, my daughter has requested it for her May wedding!  I cut the vodka because it's pretty strong otherwise but it is so delicious and perfect for a crowd.

Yum!  This is very forgiving and the fruit can be substituted for what you have on hand (provided it's slightly firm fruit).  Best to leave your keys with a friend...  :)  Thanks FoodInc5!

The best sangria I have ever had. I made this recipe exactly as written no need for changes perfect the way it is! I made a double batch for a family party and it was gone within 20 minutes. My brother who is a wine snob loved it!

I made this for a BIG bash we have every year and everyone LOVED it! I really appreciated everyone else's reviews so I made a few changes to.  I used the entire can of lemonade, and added sprite instead of water according to the lemonade can.  I also added a couple shots of controy (orange flavord liquer)It was supposed to be for the wives...but the husbands kept coming back for more.

This was a great recipe!  The Sangria turned out so delicious!  I subbed raspberry vodka, and raspberries & blueberries instead of grapes.  I used fresh white peaches and peeled them.  This will be my new signature drink!

Great recipe! I have made this several times and is always a hit at parties. I used frozen (thawed)peaches and  fresh raspberries instead of grapes-turned out great. Easy to make and looks beautiful in a pitcher. Can't wait to make it again!

This was a fun drink to have on a hot sunny day, though it was really sweet for me. I used Peach Schnapps and regular vodka, as I couldn't find peach vodka and I left out the grapes. Next time I may use club soda or tonic water to calm down some of the sugar as it did make my mouth pucker.

I made this for three differenct BBQs last summer and it went over very well.  In the fall when the summer fruit was available I used fresh cherries and apricots to make up some of the bulk of the fruit.  This is a fantastic recipe, there is never any left.

I made this recipe for my book club.I doubled it and used Schnapps instead of vodka.It was totally awesome,everyone raved about it.I also used 2 bags of frozen peaches and rasberries but I used fresh grapes and applles cut up for lots of color.If you feel it is too strong you can all some sprite and it doesn't change the flavor just makes it a bit lighter.I will make this again and again!!!!

I really love this recipe! I used pineapple juice instead of lemonade, peach schnapps instead of vodka, and Pinot Grigio for the wine. I used white nectarines, strawberries and a plum. It was a hit for girls night!

Nice sangria.  I used this as a base and modified as I went.  I didn't have the lemonade concentrate so I used lemon vodka instead as I had it on hand.  I also only used green grapes and peaches.  Lastly, I made the mistake of adding the sugar after the fruit.  Oh was that baby hard to mix.  However, the resulting drink was tasty.  The fruit had a nice kick afterward too :)

I made this for our housewarming party & it was a huge hit! I thought I had enough for the day (six bottles of white wine & a liter of peach vodka!) but we ran out long before the party ended. I substituted fresh raspberries from my garden for the grapes. The only concern was that it was a bit strong. Ice helped a lot.

I followed by the directions however thought it was a little too strong for a sangria. The peach flavored vodka seemed to put it over the edge.

I served this to my dinner guests last night and they all loved it - - even some of the men!  I substituted peach snapps for the vodka and used raspberries instead of grapes.  I also used canned organic peaches and poured a bit of the peach juice in the sangria.  My choice for dry white wine was Pinot Grigio.  Be sure to double the recipe - - it will make a pitcher and will serve over 10 drinks!  If made in the morning, that is plenty of time to let the flavors meld.  Such a perfect drink for a summer bbq!

I loved this recipe.  Have made it twice already in a month!  I used Peach Schnapps instead of the vodka and used frozen peaches, green apples and whole strawberries instead of the fruit mentioned.  It makes a beautiful presentation. Even the men loved it!

I loved this recipe, but I thought it might be too sweet so I didn't use the lemonade.  I also used nectarines, green apples, and lemon slices instead of the fruit, and used mango vodka since I couldn't find peach.  Everyone at girl's night just loved it.  It is strong (which is good)--I quadrupled the recipe for 10 girls, and I still needed another two bottles of wine.  People love this, so make more than you think.  Since I hadn't tried the original, I still gave the recipe 5 stars, especially since my changes didn't affect the finished product negatively.

Delicious sangria! I doubled the recipe and made 2 large pitchers and it was gone in a heartbeat. We didn't have peach flavored vodka so I used regular vodka and added another 1/2 cup of white peach cranberry juice. I sliced up a peach, a granny smith apple and some strawberries for really good color and threw those in instead of the grapes. The alcohol soaked fruit was really good too.

I made this for a 50th B-Day Party & the guests went wild! This was an excellent beverage to make, very easy & what a crowd pleaser! The only thing I changed was that I used a Simple Syrup instead of granulated sugar. Can't wait to have an excuse to make it again.

I made a few changes, but this was good!  I only had nectarines and oranges...and i let them soak in regular vodka and sugar.  Then i added white wine that i had in the fridge, and it was TASTY!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a spa party I held last night and noone liked it, including me.  I made two different Sangrias and everyone preferred my own recipe.  This was extremely strong and not smooth at all.  The flavor was off, too.  I prefer my own recipe anyday.

THIS was great.  So easy to make, and everyone loved and raved about it.  I had to use canned peaches (fresh aren't in season here) and it didn't matter - delicious!  Definitely will make it again.

This recipe is fan-freaking-tastic! We made it for a party and had to hastily throw together a second batch because it disappeared so quickly. It wasn't quite as good because of course we couldn't let it chill to blend, but it was still a huge hit!

I thought this recipe was good, but not quite as good as the Classic Spanish Sangria on this site.  This was a nice light alternative for a summer get-together.  It was pretty strong, though, and most people at my party diluted it with a little Sprite.  The flavor from the Absolut Peach was yummy, but I found that the peach slices soaked up most of the vodka.  Worth a try if you're a peach-lover like me, though!

I’ve made this recipe many times for large parties and we never have any leftover!  Everyone loves it!  It scales up very easily.  I usually leave out the grapes and use frozen peaches.  I add half the night before to let them soak up the flavor and then serve the remaining frozen peaches as ice cubes for the sangria.  I do melt the sugar and lemonade together to avoid the sugar falling out of suspension.  I’ve also tried the recipe with both peach vodka and peach schnapps and they are both winners.  I usually use a Pinot Grigio for the wine.

This is the best sangria ever.  It is lethal as it goes down so easily and there is a lot of alcohol so I usually mix in club soda to make it not as deadly.  I swapped out the grapes for frozen raspberries as I like them better and used frozen peaches.  Everyone I've made this for raves about it.  Thank you!

Big hit for ladies night!

I made a double batch 24 hours in advance.

I must not have  scooped enough fruit into each drink and had a half pitcher of fruit left behind.

No problem. Throw into a vitamix and add ice. Sangria smoothie for 4! Yum.

Way too strong alcohol taste, couldn't even tell it was Sangria. This only works if you add soda or some other kind of mixer to it.

I have made this recipe countless times.  It is absolutely delicious, but if you let it sit for less than about 48 hours it is way too boozy.  If you only are able to let it sit 12-24 hours, I would use about 1/3 cup of vodka instead of the full 3/4.

Had a group of girlfriends over.  They loved the flavor.  It is a good idea to have ginger ale or 7Up available to cut the impact.  I doubled the recipe and it was completely consumed!

ADD PEACH CITRUS FRESCA!! In my opinion this is a 1 star recipe as it is. But I made some small changes that made it a 5 star. I made a double batch and it was almost impossible to drink as it was...so I added about a 1.5 cans of Peach Citrus Fresca to cut down the tartness and the STRONG alcohol taste. Since I served it in a covered beverage dispenser with a spout. I added a bowl of sliced peaches marinating in the remainder of the peach vodka and as well as mint sprigs for garnish. It was a hit! I would definitely make this again with the added Fresca, drunken peaches and mint!

This drink was pretty good. I used raspberries and frozen peach slices. It looked pretty in the glass. 
I thought the  alcohol was way  too strong, so I added a bottle of sparkling Pellegrino water. I also thought it could use a little more peach flavor, as it tasted ok, but kind of like a wine cooler.
I might try it again using peach schnapps or brandy. 
This drink needed something more..

Husband loved it. I made it for him since he loves peach sangria. I love peaches but hate peach flavored things. I used fresh peaches so I could eat them and strawberries. I stuck with peach vodka but the husband wants me to try it with peach schnapps. I definitely will be making this again for him.

I doubled the recipe to make a pitcher.  To enhance the peach flavor, I added one can of Jumex Peach Nector, a tablespoon of homemade simple syrup, and a 7.5 oz can of Sprite.  It was a hit at the cookout and tasted even better the second day.

Made this for a bridal party and everyone loved it.  Used peach schnapps instead of vodka and added some 7up. It was a bit sweet for me but most really enjoyed it.

This is my goto beverage for summer gatherings.  I  change it up based on what I had on hand when I first made it and it was FABULOUS!  It's a crowd pleaser for sure.  I use pear vodka instead of peach schnapps and the cheapest dry white wine I can find.  I cut back on the lime concentrate and use 1/2 the sugar and in addition to frozen peach slices I used blueberries and sliced strawberries instead of grapes.  In a pinch, I've used frozen raspberries in place of blueberries and it turned the sangria into a gorgeous pink color.  You won't be disappointed!

Be warned!  This stuff is lethal.  My guests love it.  The last time I served this (at a July 4th party I hosted), I ended up in bed at 10 PM while my guests continued to party into the night.  I heard it was a great party.  Get plenty of rest and take lots of vitamins before you serve this.

This turned out excellent. I used frozen peaches and diced some pears. Right proportion as it was not overly sweet.

I just made this last night for a family gathering and instead of adding the sugar I added the whole can of the frozen lemonade. I also only added 1/2 cup of the vodka as this recipe is super strong.

I made this and loved it!!  Nice and refreshing for a summer cocktail instead of the usual red sangria.  I doubled the recipe and used white nectarines instead of peaches.  Next time I make it I am going to cut the amount of sugar down.  I liked the suggestions of peach schnapps instead of peach vodka.

Made a double batch for a party..  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it... The vodka flavor was a little overwhelming, so added a can of sprite zero and lots of ice... you can cut back on the amount of peaches.. that too was overkill.

Wow! This is strong! That's probably why my guests loved it so much :-)  Took everyone's advise & went with frozen peaches. I also didn't have any peach vodka so I used peach schnapps. I let it "marinate" overnight. This won rave reviews at my BBQ. It's also pretty sweet, so if you don't like your booze on the dry side, this one isn't for you.

I made this recipe for a large birthday party.  Tripled the recipe using 3 bottles of Pinot Grigio wine, one 1/2 pint  peach schnapps, a whole can of  frozen lemonade, and a 1/2 cup of sugar.  For the fruit  I used frozen peaches and red and green grapes cut in half as I didn't want the fruit to get mushy. I made it early in the day for that evening and wondered why I made so much. It was a huge hit. One small glass left for me to enjoy as I enjoyed the success of a great party... Had several requests for the recipe. Very fresh tasting, not too sweet. Fruit was great 
Will definitely  make again.

This has been my go-to white sangria for a couple of years. As per other reviews, I use peach schnapps and a bag of frozen peaches. I sometimes add grapes, but I change the added fruit depending on what's available locally. You definitely have to cut it with sparkling water or whatever carbonated beverage you prefer.

This is a perfect light summertime drink! I did make a couple changes. 
I used 3/4 cups of peach schnapps instead of the vodka. (Mainly because I didn't want to buy a whole bottle of peach vodka that I probably wouldn't use except for the small amount for this recipe.) I also omitted the sugar since the schnapps had the perfect sweetness to it. I add whatever frozen/fresh fruit I have on hand when making this (strawberries, grapes, frozen peaches, etc). This is awesome! Rated it 4 since I made some alterations.

I have made this too many times to count. It's the best recipe for white sangria and it always gets rave reviews. White peaches are best for this as they are firmer and don't get as mushy as regular peaches.

I used 1 bottle of rose moscata (barefoot beach), 2 C. pineapple juice, 1/2 C. peach schnapps, 1 glass of lemonade, 1 liter of gingerale, 1/2 mango, 1/2 can pineapple, 1/2 small watermelon, 2 kiwi, 1 nectarine, (all the previous fruit was the remainder of a fruit salad) plus 1 lemon, 1 lime and 2 clementines sliced. Delicious!

Party is gonna happen.
Well the Sangria will give it a nice start anyway.
I did modify this recipe slightly because I had plenty of vodka in the house but not an ounce of peach vodka. So I switched it up a tiny bit.  One part Peach schnapps AND 2 parts regular vodka.  I think that was the perfect fix and now I have peach schnapps in the house for other cocktails and creations.
I think you could do without the sugar entirely too.
I suggest you ditch the grapes and use peaches, nectarines, mango, and maybe strawberries and blueberries to brighten up this delicious beverage.  I also added thinly sliced lemon, lime, and orange.
Would suggest a little extra fruit on the side so you don't need a spoon to scoop out some fruit for each beverage.
Easy to make. 
Doesn't not require the suggested time for the flavors to meld.
Last thing I want to suggest, if you or your guest think this is too toxic (heavy on the alcohol), give it a splash or two of sparkling or soda water.  You still have a refreshing cocktail but with a bit less guilt.
I'm not a big peach cocktail fan but this is high on my list for a White Sangria.

I modified this recipe by halving the vodka and using peach schnapps as the other half instead of sugar.  I omitted the frozen lemonade and used martelli's sparkling lemonade instead and used frozen peaches.  It was the hit of the party.

Absolute hit at my birthday party! I cut it with Vernor's ginger ale to keep people from hitting the floor because without it, the sangria is VERY strong. I used New Amsterdam peach flavored vodka. Delicious and easy to make, especially if using frozen fruit.

This is absolutely amazing! I used regular vodka (had it on hand) and  Pinot Grigio (which ever brand is on sale). I let it sit in the fridge over night and I must admit...it is intoxicating! The fruit becomes infused with the alcohol and its very tasty. I took the advice of another review and I cut it with ginger ale for a 1:1 ratio. I mixed it with the ginger ale as I was serving it so it does not go flat and Viola! PERFECT! Very refreshing and tasty. I will whipping up a few batches for the weekends we are out on the boat entertaining friends and family. This recipe is a winner!

Made this for a barbeque and everyone loved it. Lighter than a traditional sangria and maybe a tad sweeter but that's how we like our drinks. Watch it though, it goes down very easy.

I have made this and shared this for two parties and it goes soooooo fast! Used Peach Schnapps instead of vodka. Frozen peaches instead of fresh and omitted the sugar. Chill for as long as possible to marry the flavors. And make sure you cut it with sparkling water or sprite. SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!

Really it's a 5 Star with the help of everyone's comments: Peach Schnapps in place of vodka, no grapes, peaches, nectarines and raspberries best, warm frozen lemonade in microwave and dissolve sugar in that before adding to pitcher, when serving, 1/2 sangria 1/2 sparkling water makes both the Sangria and your guests last longer ;)

Made traditional red sangria and this peach sangria for a graduation party last summer.  This PEACH SANGRIA was such a HIT! 
Everyone was raving about it. Easy to make...used peach schnapps rather than Vodka and did cut it with a small amount of Ginger Ale and Club Soda so it wasn't too strong or too sweet.   And served over ice.  I had multiplied the recipe 6x to make enough for 40 and we ran out  quickly. Am only making peach sangria for a pre-wedding party this weekend.

Loved it! Huge hit last summer and again this summer. My friend Sue is such a lush! I'm giving her this recipe, but she'll probably have to double it! Bacardi Lemon is way better than the schnapps. Sue always finishes the bottle--no waste either!

This was a hit at a birthday party we through. It's very potent so definitely make sure to have 7up or Sprint to tone it down. We ended up using frozen peaches and peach vodka.

Made this for my wedding, using only half the vodka (couldn't have my guests passed out TOO early!), and it was gone by the time dinner was over.  AMAZING!!!

Made this for a girls night in and followed the recipe exactly...absolutely FANTASTIC.  I know some people have mentioned swapping out the vodka for schnapps and I think that would make it way too sweet.  Perfect as is!

I have made this recipe many times and it has never disappointed. Always the most talked about item after the party!!!! Incredible! I've never put the grapes in (as I don't like grapes) I've always put in a little extra of the peach vodka and I buy a bag of frozen peaches and it turns out perfect every time.

I had to change the recipe up a little bit to work with what I had, but it was still fantastic.  I'm certain that the original recipe is delicious too.  I used a bottle of white zin, peach schnapps (instead of peach vodka), the lemonade concentrate, no sugar, a bag of frozen peaches, and a can of lemon-lime soda.  The results were delicious and refreshing (and potentially very dangerous!)  Everyone, from my Sister in Law who rarely drinks to my Brother in Law who is a "beer man", loved this.  Here in Florida, this is a perfect year round drink.  Thanks!

This was delicious! Great recipe! I did not have peach flavored vodka so I opted for 3/4 cup of regular grey goose vodka and added about 1/4 - 1/3  cup of fresh/not from concentrate grapefruit juice w/ no pulp.  Also, 1 pound (3-4 medium) of peaches is a lot for this 6 servings recipe, I recommend 2 peaches at most.

This is awesome with Peach Schnapps as someone suggested. I call it a Peach Bellini and serve it with Scottish Shortbread II. This is a perfect adult dessert combo while peaches are in season.

I LOVE this sangria.  I've made it several times and it's always a hit.  I use peach schnapps instead of vodka and raspberries instead of grapes.  I make it the night before so the fruit can soak in it and the raspberries give it a pretty pink color.  I serve it over ice and top with a splash of ginger ale.  Every time I serve it someone asks for the recipe.

I made this for a ladies get together and everyone loved it!  I used peachtree schnapps instead of the peach vodka and it was really good.  I used fresh sliced peaches, sliced strawberries and a thinly sliced lime for color. I will definitely make this again, a delicious summertime drink!

Giving 4 because I changed it to be less sweet.  I used one bottle of Pinot Grigio, about 3/4 cup Cuantro, no lemonade concentrate, 2 tablespoons sugar mixed with about 1/4 cup HOT water to dissolve.  Cut up fresh peaches, apples and strawberries and let marinate for 8 hours.  OH MY!  This was sooooo good.  My fruit was fresh locally grown and very sweet so that is why I cut back on sugar.  Make this and it will be a hot summer party in your mouth!

This recipe is always a hit.  Sometimes I modify it by substituting raspberry vodka and rasberry lemonade.  When I make it raspberry sangria I often add some club soda after I fill the glass about 2/3 full with the sangria and fruit!  This will be a staple of girls night for a long time!

delicious! I made a few changes, based on what I had in the house...used stoli raspberry instead of peach vodka. I used fresh raspberries instead of grapes. I've already made this a few times. Twas a big hit every time! I would def let it sit for at least 24 hrs. Otherwise it has too much of a wine taste to it. I threw a splash of 7-up before I served...I will be making this all summer :)

I modified this recipe a bit and it came out quite nicely.  I used a lot more of the lemonade & sugar, used plain vodka (only because I couldn't find the peach flavored) and instead of apples, I used frozen peaches and raspberries.  I made the lemonade/sugar adjustment because the recipe, as written, tasted way too much like cheap alcohol and schnapps.  I also added some lemon/lime soda when serving each glass.  That really did the trick.  I'll make this again with the same modifications.

This recipe is PERFECT as is!  I've made it at least 5-6 times and I use Pinot Grigio for the wine. If it is your first time serving it to someone go ahead and add the fruit. But honestly if you're just making it for yourself and someone you've served it to already - you don't really need the fruit - as no one really eats it anyway! DELICIOUS

Very good recipe.  We made one substitution to the recipe since we made it on a Sunday and the liquor stores were closed.  Instead of using peach vodka we just used regular vodka and the juice from a can of peaches in natural juice.  Turned out really well.  We ended up not drinking it all and left it in the fridge for a week and it was even better at the end of the week.

This was delicious.  I used peach vodka and a little peach schnapps.  I also added a few raspberries for color.  Next time I will save a little for myself before I take it to a party - it was gone in no time!

I'm not a huge fan of sangria, but my husband made this, with a few extra twists, and it was really quite good.

Great recipe. My boyfriend made this for a party and used peach schnapps instead of the vodka and it was absolutely delicious.

This was awesome.  Made it the day before with a bottle of Gewurtraminer, 1/2 cup mango vodka, 1/2 cup peachtree, frozen peaches, mangos, and strawberries.  Was literally gone in 5 minutes.  Next time need to make a triple batch!

I have made this several times when the weather is warm. While it has never been my favorite, guests seem to always come back for more. it is something a little different than traditional sangria, so i continue to make it.

I made this for Thanksgiving, used frozen peaches and mixed berries instead of the white grapes.  I skipped the sugar, and added peach nectar.  I poured 1/4 into a decorative pitcher, and added about a cup of club soda right before serving.  Great party drink, and pretty!

I'm giving this 4 stars because my guests liked it more than I did.  It was pretty good, but I didn't think the flavors melded together so well.  I didn't add sugar due to personal tastes, so next time instead of a dry white wine, I'll use a Reisling or Gewurtz.

I made this as is and loved it but the next time I made a few changes and loved it even more! Be careful b/c if you use the peach vodka (I use Apeach by Absolut) it hit's you fast... I was very tipsy after only 1 glass

Changes: 
Frozen sliced peaches
Frozen Raspberries
half peach schnapps and half raspberry schnapps

This was very good!  I couldn't find good white peaches (out of season) so I had to scale back on those but it was still so good.  I made it for my brother's 30th birthday and even my dad (who usually only drinks Whisky) liked it. A splash of Sprite really adds to it and helps tame it down.  I used Pinot Grigio.

I made this for a casual barbecue with friends during the hottest week of the year so far and it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe and it was almost gone by the end of the night.  My liquor store didn't have peach vodka so I used white grape vodka which turned out to be tasty, too.  I was worried it would be too strong when I tasted it the night before and planned to add lemon lime soda, but after letting it sit overnight in the fridge - it came out great the next day with no need to use the mixer (unless you want to make it weaker and bubbly).  Got rave reviews of it and how refreshing it was.  Caution - the peaches end up soaking up more of the vodka than the other fruit and end up being a bit strong!

this recipe is wonderful but it NEEDS club soda at a ration of 1:1 just like that other review states.  it's way too bopzy otherwise.  my husband loves it, and he doesn't usually like sangria at all.  thanks for the great recipe!!

Everyone who drank this had a hangover the next day, and we didn't drink that much of it.  I would not recommend mixing wine and vodka at all.

This is one of the best recipes for Sangria.  I make this for family and friends gatherings.  I make sure the presentation is fabulous. Typically using different types of fruits. Time and time again I'm asked to bring to functions and for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I could not keep the punch bowl full! I used schnapps in place of the vodka, but I'm sure it would fine either way. I sliced peaches, mango, and oranges. It was sweet, but not overly so, and had enough liquor that even the guys at my party enjoyed it! I caught several men grabbing cups of the stuff.

Honestly, I would serve this again. And again. And again.

This was super!  I used peach schnapps instead of vodka and bottled lemon concentrade instead of frozen.  I also used peaches, mangos, and strawberries.  It was very good that way, but because it was for "dog park happy hour", I diluted with some Sprite...  divine!  Very "spring-y"

I made this for a New Years party last night and WOW! I was so good people were trying to hide it so no one else would drink it. I made a double batch but I could have made 6x and still not had enough. I was told I had to make it for every party now.

This sangria was a huge hit at an afternoon party I had.  I actually ran out.  From now on I am going to double the alcohol mixture and leave the fruit as it recommends.

This is a great recipe for those looking for a little something out of the ordinary.  I  too, as other have noted, made substitutions:  peach schnapps in place of vodka, omitted sugar and also used frozen peaches instead of fresh.  Made it twice for a couple of get-togethers and everyone asked for more!

I used Peach Schnapps like others and topped it off with some Diet 7-up.  It was sweet enough without adding the sugar.  Everyone loved it.

Ok, we love this. We used a bag of frozen peaches, only one color grapes, and frozen pink lemondade...working with what we had! It was great!

Made this for a girlfriend get together. Everyone loved it. I used plain vodka with some peach snapps instead of peach vodka and yellow peaches instead of white peaches. I served it in magarita glasses so we can easily eat the fruit. My friends were very impressed with the beautiful presentation and the tasty drink!!! Will definitely make again with white peaches or mixed peaches.

What a great summer drink.  I followed the advice of others and used peach schanpps. Half Peach schnapps and half vodka.  I also used simple syrup instead of sugar.  Made one batch letting it "marinate" the proper time.  People liked it so much that I just kept adding wine, schanps and vodka. We went through 4 bottles!

This sangria is the absolute best I have ever had.  Not real strong, but did add a 12 oz. bottle of Sprite to one batch for the non-drinkers in the group.  Would definitely make again!

Everyone has been right; this will get you buzzed quickly.  For this to taste just right you will have to make alterations of your own.  Mine were: canned peaches with light syrup, peach schnapps, club soda. Once the bitter has diminished from the white wine, you'll have to watch how sweet this could get.

I think I prefer the standard White Sangria better.

This was a great sangria! I liked the fact that it was on the strong side. Perfect for those spring & summer BBQ's!
I also doubled the recipe and used frozen peaches instead of fresh. Hit the spot!

This is pretty good.  I was looking for various ways to use up all the fresh green grapes from my garden.  It turned out a bit stronger than I was expecting, but maybe that had something to do with why everyone enjoyed it so much.

I had no complaints from the company I served this to.  I used mango rum istead of the peach vodka.  It turned out well.  One casualty to all that liquor...not too bad.

I thought this sounded so good for summer, but I was really disappointed.  I thought it was a lot of work and expense for a "just O.K. " drink. I had a party of girls that tried it and nobody loved it or asked for more.

I personally liked this sangria very much.  However, took it to a party and the red went fast, and this white didn't go.  I dunno, thought it was delicious!

This is just wonderful!! I used juice instead of vodka though. Very refreshing!! This recipe is better than any wine spritzer or sangria I've ever had.
