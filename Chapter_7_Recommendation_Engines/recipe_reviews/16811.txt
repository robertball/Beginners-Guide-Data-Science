This is awesome! I made this and everyone loved it. I wanted to make a batch first to see how it tasted before i tried to serve it at a party. my husband and I loved it. I even took 1/2 of the batch, put it in a little baking dish, topped with some cheese and baked until the cheese was melted. and i served the other half cold. 
i also noticed that if you will be serving it cold, make it the day before you plan to use it. that way it had time for all of the ingredients to mix together. then there wasnt any kind of overpowering taste of anything.

As is, there is just too much 'dip' and not enough pizazz.  Try 8 oz cream cheese,  5 chopped crab sticks (the more expensive 'real' crab is too bland) 1 tsp of granulated bouillon (chicken or beef),2 TBS. chopped GREEN onion,a dash of hot sauce and dash of worcestershire.  Use half and half to thin if necessary. This is really good as a stuffing in small lengths of celery....no crackers or chips needed.  My guests really like it.

I brought this to work today and had to go back to All recipes and print out the
recipe for them, they loved it.  I only added 1 teaspoon of dill weed, and added
2 chopped green onions.  I think it would also be good with green olives.  I will
make this again

This wasn't that great. I made it almost exactly as written except I used real crabmeat instead of imitation and I wasn't sure how much 8 imitation legs were. I also used Frank's hot sauce. It seemed overly fishy and I added a lot more hot sauce to be able to push the expensive leftovers. I won't make this particular crab dip recipe again.

Like a couple other reviewers noted, it did need a bit more hot sauce and I ended up adding more dill.  Other than that it was great and everyone who tried it LOVED it; a couple people repeatedly brought up what a great crab dip it was while devouring it.  Very good recipe.

This is an excellent, quick and inexpensive crab dip.  My friends are always asking me to make it for diffent occasions.  I sometimes add a little garlic salt and onion.

Great dip. Very easy and surprisingly different. I served it at a large party where
there was too much food, and this one was still wolfed down.l

This was just OK. Very bland and hardly any flavor. Added more hot sauce, some creole seasoning, and mustard powder. Did improve it some, but probably will not make again.

I prefer a lot less mayo, so I used about 1/4 - 1/3 cup and added Worcestershire and green onions like others suggested. My husband loves this!

I made this as directed and unfortunately was not impressed.  I'm trying to doctor it up as I write this, heating it up, adding this and that...As written, I wouldn't make it again.

ick.  Too cream cheesy, too thick, and the taste of the 
crab was totally overpowered by the dill and cream cheese.
It was a little bit better when heated in the oven
at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

I usually don't change a recipe when making it for the first time. However, I knew I had to based on the reviews and personal preference. 
First, I left out the olives, I did not see how they would enhance the dish. Also, I added garlic cloves and  tabasco and halved the cheddar with parmesan cheese. Then I heated it all in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. It was really good with crackers!

Great combination of flavors. The dill adds a depth of flavor without calling attention to itself.

I thought this was great. The only thing I changed was I left out the pepper sauce and added some finely chopped onion and some garlic. This was a huge hit at my office Christmas party.

As written this is very cream cheesy and though not bad, it isn't very good either. As some others stated, I added some green onion and increased the hot sauce. That helped, but I also added around a 1/4 cup finely chopped smokey cheddar and added the black olives to the dip but topped the crackers with green olives and they are AMAZING!

I used fresh crab and fresh dill weed in this recipe.  Served it to 8 women along with several very simple appetizers.  It was really not a hit. What a disappointment.
