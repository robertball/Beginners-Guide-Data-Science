We loved it!  Boiled fresh super sweet corn instead of bbq.  Added two cans of beans instead of one.  Then added 3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic to the dressing.  Also kicked it up a bit with balsalmic vingear.  Next time I will add avacado, cucumber, zucchini, red bell pepper!  The cumin and cilantro make it soooo yummy!

My whole family loved this!  I made this to go with blue corn chips for a card party.  I'm lucky the dish made it there.  LOL!  The only thing I changed was I used frozen corn instead of corn on the cob (out of season) and I baked it in the oven instead of the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely loved this combination of flavors!  Awesome (AS IS)!!!  I did not grill the corn, just cut it right off the cob, added the other ingredients, and baked about 30 minutes. Great side dish! Thank you!

Loved this recipe. The right combination of oil and red wine vinegar so it wasn't too acidic. Added a small amount of chopped red, green and yellow peppers. My husband added to his "Keeper" list. Great dish for a summer side, or to take to a party or potluck.

Man, this was good.  There was no way I was gonna insult beautiful, fresh ears of California corn in season (by grilling or cooking it).  I cut fresh corn right off the ear, and used smoked paprika (in lieu of chili powder).  Fresh-squeezed lime is a must.  What a treat.  Served it with BBQ burgers and Skewered Grilled Potatoes (another Allrecipes.com fav).  The red wine vinegar dressing is fabulous.  Such good food.

This was delicious!  I used sweet bi-color corn and boiled for 4 minutes rather than grilling it. I added chopped red peppers for a little added color, but it would have been fine without it.  It was so much easier to eat than corn-on-the-cob at our BBQ, but you still got that sweet fresh corn taste.  Everyone absolutely loved it - thanks for sharing!

Tasted pretty much as I wanted.  Good flavor, similar to what I have found at restaurants.

I added about 1/2 cup diced red onion. Next time I make it, I will rinse the black beans so as not to give the corn a darkish tint.  It looks fresher that way.  I also used frozen corn, just rinsed under cool water first.  I'm sure grilling fresh corn adds nice flavor, but, this was perfectly fine and got the job done much quicker.

This is great!  Used cannellini beans instead of black beans and used as a cold salad to accompany ribs.  Will definitely make this again.

I made it just as described except I added just a tiny bit of chopped jalapeno to give it a little punch. Very good and super easy recipe.

I've made this twice now, both times got rave reviews. I added tomato, zucchini,  and vidalia onion. You can add anything really. The dressing is what makes the dish.

The dressing surprised me - I for some reason expected a different type of flavor - very delicious. I was short on time so used canned corn and it was great. I also added grape tomatoes and avocado; next time I'll throw red onion in too. Great and quick to bring to a summer BBQ.

I made this for a potluck and it turned out great. I wanted to use frozen white corn but not finding any in my local market, tried two cans of white corn and was happy with the taste. Otherwise followed the recipe. This will now be my go-to corn salad recipe. Love the dressing.

I just made this for our 4th of July cook-out, delicious!  The dressing is sweet and tangy, goes great with grilled chicken and I am especially enjoying it with the bratwurst!  Yummy, fresh and crisp.

Just made this and am quite impressed! Had to sub a few things only because my pantry is low. Used lemon instead of lime juice, onion powder instead of garlic powder, hot sauce + paprika to mimic the chili powder, and used canned corn. Also added zucchini and canned tomatoes with green chiles per other reviewer's advice. Also added some mild salsa to the dressing as had no cilantro and that had it in it. Outstanding! Me and roomie have recently switched to a vegetarian diet, and am always looking for things like this. A keeper!

I really liked this recipe. Oh I did have to change a couple things based on ingredients I had. I used white wine vinegar instead of red. I did not have cilantro (but I bet it would be awesome with cilantro). I used some homegrown sweet corn that I had frozen.  I added some chopped cherry tomatoes that I had.  I also only used 2 Tbsp of olive oil.  The seasoning combination was perfect for me.  I will be making this recipe again.

yummy yummy yummy.  I've made this a few times now and I love adding quinoa, olives, and cherry tomatoes. 
but, its delicious as is. also, I like using Trader Joe's frozen sweet white corn. it is wonderful in salads.
the dressing makes this so delicious. I'll make a huge batch and it will be gone in 2 days.

Nice different way to have corn on a hot summer's day picnic. I grill my corn directly on the grill, I like the little charred bits of corn. It gives it a nutty flavor.

I made a few changes when I made it.  I was out of cumin, so I used curry instead.  I also used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder.  I also left out the cilantro as we don't like it, tastes like soap.  It was a big hit!

I've made this on three occasions this summer and each time I have been asked for the recipe. To enhance the taste of the corn, we smoked it on the Traeger grill and then finished cooking by upping the heat. I really enjoy this simple, flavorful and healthy salad. Thanks for sharing SunnyDaysNora. =)

This recipe is wonderful! I double it and take it to parties and it always gets rave reviews. The first time I used fresh corn as instructed, but now I use frozen corn, slightly undercooked. I have even used Birds Eye southwest corn for added interest. All work great! I do add a little finely chopped zucchini and tomato. It's a somewhat flexible recipe.  But I do agree, don't mess with the dressing. It is excellent!

Grilling the corn really makes it delicious. I highly recommend giving it a try. It's great as is or you can add onion, avocado, or peppers.  We serve it as side with burgers or as a pot luck dish.

Dare I say it?  I used two tins of niblets corn.  It's what I had & it worked great.  I think you could add anything to this recipe, but don't change the dressing as that's what makes it so wonderful.  Thanks

I used light red kidney beans in this with fresh corn. Tasted good but could be better will add tomatoes and cucumbers next time.  When I want a Mexican flare I will use black beans and other seasonings. Good all round recipe.
