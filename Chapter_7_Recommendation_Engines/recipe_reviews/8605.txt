Great recipe. I used boneless thighs fried them in olive oil and garlic. I also added thyme. Very flavorful, but next time I will double the sauce portion. I didn't bother with peeling the tomatos...what am I, Emril Lagasse? 
..but I did seed the tomatos as the recipe called for. If there was a difference to peel the tomatos, i'm not sure what benefit that would give me, because the dish was excellent without the extra work in peeling the tomatos.

I found this recipe when looking for something to do with a left over bottle of white wine from the day before. This has to be one of my favourite chicken recipes I've ever tried.

I used half red onion along with white onion as I love the way red onion and balsamic vinegar go together. I also used twice as much wine as the recipe asked for, to give it a bit of an extra kick.

Like others I sauted the mushrooms breifly over a very high heat to brown them off.

I also used chicken breasts as I was only cooking for two people.

The recipe creates a really nice thick and rich (yet light) sauce that you can lavish over the chicken, mushrooms and onions.

I served it with a side of bulgar wheat and briefly stemed vegetables. I think it would also be great with rice or pasta. 

It's definitely the kind of dish that can be dressed down for a home-evening meal or dressed up for a dinner party. I will be making this over and over! Yummy!

Fantastic dish!  Sophisticated taste, make sure to have rice to go along with dish, we thought we'd detour from the recipe and have fresh baked bread, it just didn't cut it for us.

This chicken recipe was great.  I used boneless, skinless, thin sliced chicken breasts.  I browned very well as my husband does not like pale chicken.  I added garlic, some thyme and did not add any salt.  I doubled the wine and added about a quarter cup or so of chicken broth so there would be more liquid.  I also sauteed the mushroons before adding.  I only had to cook about 15 minutes and removed the chicken.  I added the vinegar and sauteed mushroons and let the sauce develop for 5 minutes then added back the chicken and let it pick-up the flavors of the sauce.  Will definitely make again.  This goes great with Corn and Rice Medley on this site.

My husband and I thought it lacked some flavor.  Next time I might try adding garlic to help enrich the taste.  Served it over rice.  I almost think it tasted better as leftovers.

I made this once, using one 14oz can of diced tomatoes as I didn't have fresh on hand, and found it a good but a little bland (would have given it a 3 star).  My hubby said the same.  I should note that I did did not dredge the chicken in flour in an attempt to keep it the recipe as healthy as possible.

After following the reviews and my mom's cooking experience, I made the following changes/additions:

- 3 cloves garlic added to the onion/celery mix
- 2 14 oz cans diced tomatoes in place of the 3 fresh toms.
- basil and oregano to taste (fresh is best, but dried will do in a pinch)
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar (the best you can afford)
- if using cheaper vinegar (like I did), add 1 tsp sugar to balance the acidity

Serve over rice.

This has become one of my main meals for 'brown bagging it' dinners (I'm a shift worker).  And yes, the mushrooms freeze well.

Great recipe on it's own (every food preference is subjective), so thanks to Christy for posting this in the first place!

Awesome chicken recipe!! I followed everything the recipe said, and used little cherry tomatoes and added extra spices...it was a great dinner. I served it over mashed potatoes and had the leftovers all week. It was a great new and different chicken dinner. Even my chef husband was raving!!

3 tomatoes isnt enough sauce for all that chicken. More like 1 - 28oz can of stew tomaotes to start with. Like other reviews I added garlic 2 cloves, along with the onion.  I upped the oregano to at least 2 tsps to give it more flavour than it had. It would have been too bland without the garlic and extra oregano. A good base to play with.

This was very good.  I did not seed or peel the tomatoes and I added about 2 tablespoons of sun dried tomatoes in with the mushrooms and served it over brown rice. YUM YUM.  Will definitely make this again soon.

Easy and good. I used chicken breasts. I used red and white onion, little bit more wine and chicken broth. I am not a chicken fan but this had flavor. I will make again.

12/27/06
I made this again. It was great. This time I only used chicken broth, added an extra 1/2 T b. vinegar, used diced tomatoes and cooked the mushrooms in butter and b. vinegar before adding them to the other ingredients. Enjoy!

I cut the servings in half, I don't know it that had anything to do with how it came out or not.  It was bland, kinda mushy.  Maybe I had to much flour on my chicken.  I don't think I will make this again.

Very good recipe. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, but I think it would be good as written as well. I like the combination of fresh vegetables, vinegar, wine, and spices. Good with spaghetti or rice on the side, to soak up the juices.

This was very tasty! I listened to other reviewers and added a touch of garlic, and used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. The combination of the white wine and balsamic was very nice, and had an enxpected richness. Thanks!

Initially this seems too simple to be good, but the result is very tasty! I used boneless breasts, and I added some garlic to the onion celery mixture, but that's it.  It's a great low fat recipe with lots of taste.

I followed the recipe as listed--and could see how one thought of it a bit bland. Well, for me, I follow a low-sodium diet and it couldn't have been better. The flavors came together beautifully...and, yes, I'd make it again and again and again.

I doubled the sauce and it made a lot.  I "Magic-Bulleted" a can of dice tomatoes and used that as my base instead of the chopped tomatoes.  Loved the tasted.  Next time I would make it with bone-in chicken thighs. I didn't even pick out the sliced mushrooms (not my favorite).  I will be making this a lot.  Thank you.

I made this exactly as the recipe said except instead of fresh tomatoes I used canned whole tomatoes that I cut up a bit.  Easy, great recipe that looks really nice.  I think I will add a little garlic next time and perhaps a dot more balsamic vinegar as it was flavorful but not as flavorful as I'd like.  I served it with polenta.  Very nice dish.

Very good base recipe but gave it 4 stars because I made changes. I added artichoke hearts, 1 tablespoon of sugar, garlic and more oregano.  With these changes it made it a more balanced, less acidic dinner.  I served it over rice, it was a nice dinner.

This is a very good recipe, and I agree with most of the other reviews.  After reading them, I decided to change the recipe a bit, before I tried it.  First of all, the one thing I usually do, when a recipe calls for flouring and browning a meat, is to dredge the meat in a mixture of flour, garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  This helps add the additional flavor that most of the other reviewers were stating that was missing. Of course, I added garlic to the recipe, as well, and chicken broth.  I usually use a chicken broth that has roasted garlic in it.  I also use a vegetable broth, instead of water, when making rice.  But, I feel the most important factor in this recipe is the balsamic vinegar.  In Italy, they use a very thick, old, sweet balsamic vinegar. The real balsamic vinegar, is very expensive, but worth it! It has such a delicous flavor, and when used in this recipe, it is fantastic!

Sorry to rain on the parade but I am only rating this a 2.  Everything smelled divine as it was cooking and the chicken was very moist but...we just didn't care for the sauce at all.  There was nothing to balance out the acidity of the tomatos, wine and vinegar.  Those who really enjoy balsamic vinegar might like this dish.  It just wasn't a taste that my family was in to.

This was really good, my husband loved it too!  I followed some other reviews and added garlic.  I also added more balsamic vinegar and some basil.  Next time I'll add more wine to make it more saucy and I think I'll serve it over noodles.  I can't wait to make this again!

We followed the recipes exactly and thought it was tasty and moist.  We made pasta instead of rice, which worked out nicely.  I might try another reviewers suggestion to add garlic. THanks for the recipe.

Cut up boneless, skinless thighs
Doubled the balsamic vinegar
Added about 1.5 cup of chicken broth—as it stews it thickens
Used 6 or 7 Campari tomatoes

Ate it without rice or noodles—very good.

Really liked this recipe. Served it over rice. Next time I think I'll serve it over some kind of pasta with some garlic bread. Very good.

Thought it lacked some flavor.  I even added garlic but don't think it was enough.  Next time will add less wine and more balsamic vinegar.

This was really delicious.  I did change it to use up some bacon we had.  I fried 4-5 pieces then cooked the chicken in the bacon drippings.  I added my chopped bacon when everything went in to simmer.  Really tasty meal.

This was an awesome recipe. I loved it. I did as previous reviewer and cooked the mushrooms and vinegar separately and that worked good. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand so I put in a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil--really good. I also kicked it up alot by adding alot of garlic, basil and fresh thyme. I plan on making this a regular at the table. I wonder how adding artichoke hearts would be? May try next time. Thanks!

I thought this was good, but not great - I am giving it four stars since I think it has potential, it was quick and easy, and it is fairly healthy; but, it seemed to lack flavor and balance. I added 2 cloves of garlic, but it still seemed to be missing something.  I think I will play with this recipe and perhaps add more garlic, more oregano, decrease the wine a little and add a little chicken broth, some basil, a tiny bit of sugar, and a little worcheshire sauce. I really like basamic vinegar, but I don't think you would care for this recipe if you're not a big fan of balsamic vingegar. The cooking time was perfect and the chicken was very tender. I ate this by itself with a side of steamed carrots, I think, with the changes I noted above, it would be great over angel hair pasta. Update: I ate this as leftovers and added fresh grated Parmesan, and it really improved the taste/balance.

This was only okay.  I agree that there was nothing to balance the acidity, so there wasn't any real depth to the flavor.  I added a bunch of Parmesan and a lot of salt and it was better.  Maybe using chicken broth instead of the wine would help.  This is a good base to start with, so I may play with it a little.

This was quite good but I thought it might be lacking a bit in flavour. But it was a quick and impressive dinner party dish.

This was a hit with my family and our dinner guests.  The flavor is mild yet delicious. I followed the recipe as is and found plenty of liquid given off from the chicken itself.  Will definately make this dish again!

This was ok, but not what i expected.  I thought it needed something...more spices?  I added garlic and chicken broth (the sauce got too thick), but I don't know if i will make again.  Thanks though!

Good!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast that I pounded and cut into strips.  I omitted the celery (personal preference) but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was tasty...thanks!
