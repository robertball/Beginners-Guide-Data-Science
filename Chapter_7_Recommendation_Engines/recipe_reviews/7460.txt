I have to say that this is the recipe I was looking for!  A yellow cake made from scratch.  I followed the recipe to a T except I did what others suggested - cream the butter and sugar well (for about 5 minutes).  I mixed everything with the electric mixer and at the end my batter looked like yellow Cool Whip.  The flavour is buttery and the sweetness is just right.  Just make sure to frost it light because it doesn't need a lot of it.  The texture of the cake (both times I made it) was in between a pound cake and a fluffy cake.  Mine was NOT like cornbread at all.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Mixed properly and not overbaked, this is a fine, moist butter cake.  I used Penzey's double strength vanilla and,   for extra richness and moistness, I  added an egg yolk in addition to the two eggs called for. This cake has a coarse crumb which I'm sure would be great for cakes where it's important they are sturdy and hold their shape.  If you're looking for a more delicate cake with a fine crumb this would not be the recipe to use. I baked this in an 8" round pan, then split it into two layers. I filled it with seedless raspberry jam, frosted it with "Butter Cream Frosting 1," also from this site, and coated the sides in coconut.  Delicious combination of flavors, perfectly suited for this cake.

I have used this recipe on two occasions. I found the texture of the cake to be perfect for shaping it into themes. It holds together very , very well. Everyone who had the cake at the two birthday parties commented on its good taste . I will use the cake again - that is why I am back at this site. To print it out once again!

Butter and eggs are what to look for in a cake recipe.  This isn't a light froo froo cake.  Use good quality ingredients like real vanilla and it's great. (I often add more vanilla than a recipe calls for) Someone said it was like corn bread, it's dense like corn bread but soft, not grainy and it certainly did not taste like flour, it tasted like a vanilla flavored cake (sweet).  This cake will hold up to shaping.  It is great alone but frosting is always nice too.  The only difference in my ingredients, is I don't ever have milk on hand, I used powdered milk, not really a difference.  Do not make if you like lighter than air, froo froo cake.

I am sorry to report that my family and I did not care for this recipe.  We found it to be extremely coarsely textured and very dry.

This is the best and easiest cake recipe I've ever tried!  It's also the first one that didn't break when I turned it out of the pan.  A true winner!

I've been looking for a while for a good yellow cake recipe not using cake mix flour but as a real baker and this recipe just turned excellent. Eventhough, I added 1 more egg and 2 extra tablespoons of buttter. It's so yummmy!

This recipe is a classic and if made properly, it should not come out like cornbread.  I did add an extra egg yolk and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract to the vanilla (for a little more flavor).  If your cake is coming out dry and like "cornbread", you are likely not using cake flour and you are not softening the butter and whipping it with the sugar until very fluffy.  Be sure and use large sized eggs also. If your palate is only used to box cake mixes, this recipe will seem heavy and dense, but it shouldn't come out like cornbread if executed properly.  One other tip, be sure your eggs are at room temperature and your butter is very soft - basics for good baking.  Good luck and don't dismiss this recipe.

This is a very good recipe!! I actually converted it into a low sugar recipe (my husband is diabetic) and it tasted wonderful. I used 1/2 a cup of sugar and 12 packets of Equal and frosted it with a sugar free pudding and dreamwhip frosting, Yummy!! And I don't normally like low sugar desserts!

The first time I made this cake, I did not cream the butter and sugar long enough and it produced a cake the was coarse in texture, much like cornbread to quote some of the reviewers here. When I made the cake a second time, I creamed the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes, then added the eggs and vanilla and mixed until just blended before adding the flour and milk, stirring by hand. This produced a cake with a much finer texture. Both cakes were yummy though!  It also helps to lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup before leveling instead of scooping out the flour with the cup. You use less flour this way and it produces a moister product.  And finally, both cakes were done waaaaayyyy before 50 minutes. The first cake was baked in an 8x8 pan and it was a tad over done at 35 minutes. I baked the second cake for 25 minutes in a 9x9 pan and it came out perfectly.

I used this recipe for my son's birthday cake. The flavor was good, but, I, like others, wasn't overly fond of the heaviness of the cake. I probably won't make this one again.

My go-to cake recipe for all of my vanilla cupcakes and fondant-covered cakes. This is a dense but moist and easy to make cake...if it's dry like cornbread, you're overbaking the cake and/or mixing it too much. Mix in the flour JUST until it's blended and the cake will stay moist. If you over mix it, the gluten in the flour will make the cake "tough" plus you'll add excess air into the batter.  That said, I've brought tons of cupcakes to work made with this particular recipe and people always love them. It hold its shape very well. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Just add an extra yolk for moisture and double vanilla for excellent flavor. :D

This is a fantastic cake! I followed the recipe exactly. The trick for a tender crumb and texture is to cream the butter, once by itself, once with the sugar and again with the eggs and vanilla. You're looking for the mixture to be very light yellow and doubled in volume.

I made this cake as a birthday cake for my father in law.  It was wonderful!  I thought it was more "light" than previous reviewers suggested though.   I didn't see a pound cake texture at all.  
I do think the secret is to use a hand mixer and mix the butter, suger, vanilla combination for a good five minutes on high.  Then, I alternated a half cup flour to quarter cup milk mixing  after each addition until I'd used the rest of the flour and milk.  I also warmed the milk before I added it.
The layers were very thin, so I ended up making four layers.  They cooked in about 27 minutes.  
I combined raspberry jam with cream cheese to a thick consistancy for between the layers and frosted with a a mix of cream cheese, chocolate pudding mix and milk (adding milk until the mixture was smooth, but not runny).  After I coated the cake in the pudding frosting (more like a mousse!) I put the cake in the refridgerator to set the frosting.  
It was a huge hit.  My husband said it was the best cake I'd ever made.  My mother in law went back for seconds (very unlike her)...
I'll be making this again for sure.

This is a fatastic cake! It tastes wonderful and is great to work with. I happened to use this for a cake decoration contest and it works really well. One thing I have to worn you on is to be sure to grease the pan WELL before you bake the cake. Also be sure to watch the cake as it's baking else you may just fine a black brick of a cake in your oven.

My daughter and I made these together as part of a homeschooling project. We followed the instructions and ingredients to the "t" and like one review said it wasn't even sweet and it even had a bitter taste. 
Such a big disappointment to my daughter and to me since we made TWO.

This was pretty dense (As others have said) so it depends on an individual's preferences. My kids like it just fine, and it definitely is the kind of cake that you can actually shape and decorate without it completely falling apart, so great for birthdays.

This cake is entirely too dense.  Just like others have said, it turns out like cornbread.  It is much too heavy for my liking, and I won't make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly and I agree with the other reviewer that the batter should look like yellow cool whip when you are finished. I made these into cupcakes, they made about 14 cupcakes for me and took about 17 minutes to bake. I was concerned about them tasting like cornbread as other reviews had mentioned and when serving them for my friend's birthday, the first thing out of his mouth was indeed... "they taste like cornbread." Figures. In my opinion, the taste is quite good, moist and buttery. But the texture it what makes them appear to be cornbread-y. They were not smooth but instead had a lot of places where air bubbles had formed and caused a course texture. Also, they did not form domes like most attractive cupcakes do which was disappointing. Maybe they would make a better cake then a cupcake but I would not recommend making this recipe. It's very easy to make but the pay off is not good. All in all an okay recipe, but defintely DO NOT make cupcakes with it. You will be disappointed.

This is simple and quite tasty. I made cupcakes and they only took 25 minutes. I also made one batch substituting about 1/2 cup cocoa for slightly less than 1/2 cup flour and it was a great chocolate version. I think it's hard to screw up.

This is a great basic recipe for butter cake, the closest I've found to my favorite butter cake dessert in a restaurant! I added just a pinch of cinnamon, 2 and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract, and about a tablespoon extra of melted butter into the prepared batter before putting it into the pan and took it out just when it got golden on top and a toothpick came out clean. They were perfectly flavored and very moist. Great with chocolate frosting or with fresh berries and whipped cream! Yum!

when i made this cake it tasted pretty good, but it did have the texture of cornbread. The texture was just a tad too rough for my taste. I wouldnt make it again.

Excellent!  I used this cake as the base for a frozen ice cream cake and it had the perfect texture and taste to go along with ice cream.

This cake is delicious and turned out really well! I followed this recipe very closely - just used cake flour and sifted all of the dry ingredients. I also let my eggs and butter come to room temperature before using. I thought the texture was great - cake was very moist - not at all dry. I also made sure not to overmix once I thoroughly creamed  butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!

This is exactly what I was looking for when I was searching for "butter cake".  This cake is dense, golden on top, and not too sweet.  It is great for shaped cakes or shaping because it is not crumbly and will not fall apart.

I made cupcakes- mixed everything by hand to a smooth, creamy finish and poured the paper cups to a little over half full.  This made them rise perfectly- not too tall and not too short.  I followed the ingredients, no substituting but being cupcakes, I baked them for 40 minutes in an electric oven.  They probably could have gone maybe 35 minutes, but I forgot to check on them.

While they were baking, my husband and I gobbled the extra batter.  That is when I knew these would be yummy.  I could not stop eating the batter.

Anyway, after the timing issue, they came out fine and they are delicious!

I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks!

(P.S.  I would like to comment on the "cornbread" comments... this cake tastes NOTHING like cornbread!)

Very easy!  I made cupcakes, and found they raised beautifully and were light.  I baked them 30 minutes instead of the longer period for a layer cake.

I followed the recipe exactly but put the batter in a 9" round cake tin, baking it for 47min. It was a beautiful golden brown on the outside, and tasted great. I didn't put any icing on the cake for fear it would be too sweet. The key is using good quality butter and real vanilla extract. The texture of the cake was not very light, it was actually quite dense but my family enjoyed it very much.

Excellent results - I tried it with light brown sugar instead of white, and the husband and I loved it! I creamed the butter and sugar it in a small  chopper cos I don't yet have a mixer and   the texture didn't suffer at all. Thanks very much  - I'll definitely be making this again.

This is the BEST!! yes BEST! yellow cake I have ever tried! It is moist and delicious. The only thing is that it was finished cooking around 30 minutes! I am glad I checked it because I am pretty sure it would have dried out otherwise.

Outstanding! I changed nothing. However, depending on your oven, it can take less than 50 minutes to bake. I would start checking at 35 or so, with my old oven that runs hot. I baked it in an oval casserole that is slightly larger than a 9-in. round, which could account for the shorter baking time. Again, outstanding just like it is!!

Love this recipe. Taste great. Only problem was the time. First cake baked under the recommended time of 50 - 55 minutes got burnt. 2nd cake was done within 30 minutes and was perfectly moist.

Didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I left it in the oven for 30 minutes and that was too long even. Sorry, I was hoping this would be a good cake.

This was not to my liking! The only change I made to the ingredients was doubling the vanilla extract - and the cake STILL tasted like flour.  It is a bit on the dense side but I didn't mind that at all... Flavor was the biggest disappointment!

I don't know what the heck I did wrong but this came out tasting like a sweet corn bread. I did substitute sugar with Spenda and did so as directed on the Spenda bag.  We will eat it with dinner as it just so happens I made soup this evening, but I will need to go get a birthday cake from the store.

I had good results with this recipe. It is not the lightest cake but it is not heavy either. It is nice and moist if prepared correctly.  I added more flavoring (1 ½ tsp. vanilla/ 1 tsp. orange oil) than the recipe called for. I made cupcakes; therefore the baking time was much shorter, about 25 min. for me. Regarding the dryness issue that some bakers ran into; the length of time in the oven may be the culprit. Also, keep in mind the type of pan used does matter when determining the bake time.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because my husband loves it and that's enough for me. :)  One thing to keep in mind, this is probably not a b-day cake and it's definitely not light and fluffy. I've made it twice now and intend to make it again today, it always turns out just right. Not too sweet, not too rich - it's a great snack food.  I followed the directions exactly, not adding anything. It's great!

We LOVED this cake!!  I topped it with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from here.  I didn't find it at all dry.  I think it tasted wonderful and it is on it's third day and still as moist as day one.  So easy to make!

This cake tasted good. I followed other reviewers and added an extra egg white. But just a heads up..this is NOT a two layer cake. I put it in two 8" round pans and they really didnt turn out very big. So make sure you follow the recipe which yeilds one 8" pan. This was a bit difficult to decorate as it was kind of crumbly. I am pretty good ad decorating cakes but when frosting this cake, I kept getting crumbs in the frosting.

This cake is awesome! If you are loking for a cake mix type cake then use a mix, but if you are looking for something with a great flavor and an interesting texture, this is for you. Reminds me of the cakes my Gran made for me as a child!!

This was a very good cake.  I had to make some substitutions because I did not have milk (mixed cream, water and added some sour cream), and I did end up adding an extra tablespoon of butter.  All in all, wonderful cake - frosted with chocolate frosting.  Yum!  Thanks for the post.

Great tasting cake and easy to prepare.  Very dense but not dry.  Definitely use cake flour.

This is the best butter cake recipe I've ever tasted! One reviewer said it was coarse textured, but it is not. If you want a finer texture to a cake, use cake flour or pastry flour. Also very important, bake it for 40 minutes, not 50 or 55 minutes!  I made this for my 2nd wedding anniversary with a vanilla buttercream frosting and strawberry filling and oh! What a hit it was! Thank you for sharing!

This is an awesome recipie!I made it for poker night and it was gone really quickly! I frosted it with Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate frosting,the recipe which I found at the back of the coco powder tin. The problem with the cake is that it takes longer to brown so you really need to keep an eye on it. i suggest lowering the temperature if you have a fan forced oven like me. I baked it at 160+degrees celcius and it was in there for about 40+ mins or so. Oh and its best warm with the frosting on it. And the crusty bits rock!And it wasn't too dense at all. A nice in between. :)

Definitely practical, definitely easy.  Just a note, I used vegetable oil spread instead of butter, so I also reduced the amount of milk to prevent my batter from getting too runny.  I also baked it in a loaf pan.  The exterior of the cake was a little dark, but the "crust" was my favorite part of the cake.

Even though this cake over flowed all over my oven and made a huge mess, it was really moist and delicious. I made two 8 inch cakes and made a custard to put between them and frosted it with chocolate fudge frosting. I loved it so much. Thank you. My husband loved it and my 2 year old daughter was even caught sticking her finger in it when we weren't looking. Will defintely make again.

It was quick, easy, and with the addition of cinnamon and diced apples, it came out moist and delicious. The sides darkened (but not burned) a little and the cake was done in only about 45min, and with the addition of Butter Cream Frosting II it's already half-devoured.

Used this recipe for cupcakes and they turned out great!  I lessen the milk amount and added freshly squeezed orange juice and orange rind for orange butter cake.  My home smelled heavenly when the cake was almost ready.

I made this cake using two, 8-inch rounds and baked it for only 25 to 30 minutes. Sifting the dry ingredients and really creaming the wet ingredients will make this cake very light and smooth. Wonderful! People at work loved it! I cut the two rounds into two (four layers) and made a frosting (Coconut frosting and filling--Donna) for just the layers using shredded coconut, 2 c. sour cream, and 2 c. of granulated sugar. I reserved one cup of the frosting and mixed in 8 oz. of cool whip to frost the sides and top. WOW!!! It was a sensation! Thank you!

My husband is a big fan of butter cakes so I tried this and put a twinkie cream from another recipe in the middle.  It was fantastic!  I was a little concerned that it wouldn't have a good enough butter taste for him so I added a teaspoon of butter flavoring with the one teaspoon vanilla and wow!  Not sure I needed the butter flavoring but i found this to be quite good.  If you have a problem with the texture, make sure you mix your sugar and butter until CREAMED this will take away some of the grit that some complain about.

I just made this with Bob's Red Mill cup for cup gf flour mix. I doubled the recipe for an extra large cake pan lowered the temp to 325, baked for 40 minutes and it came out great. No hump in the middle because I lowered the temp.

100% agree with using room temp ingredients, making sure they are sifted and creamed very well. Mine turned out very light and supported fondant well. I also used the blueberry variation. Very very good recipe!!! Too bad about my fondant!

Solid recipe. Great flavor, perfect texture. My batter seemed rather thick, but it's also pretty cold in here so maybe my room temperature wasn't as intended :) I did not use parchment paper, just greased and floured my springform pan, and had no issues whatsoever getting the thing out. Thanks for sharing this classic recipe Carol.

Perfect little butter cake for a small dessert.  I followed the recipe instructions except I separated the eggs and whipped the whites then folded them in at the end.  Light and fluffy and moist.  Will make again.

I was looking to make a butter cake from scratch for my strawberry shortcake cups.  The cake came out light,  had a lovely fine texture and tasted great!  I had been doing research and saw that to get a fine crumb you have to beat the butter and sugar for 5-10 minutes.  I made sure to do this as recommended by the Joy Baking site and other Allrecipes reviewers.  Also, since I really like vanilla, I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Lastly, I was testing out making the cake in a jelly roll pan.  I doubled the recipe and it worked fine.  Baking time 25 minutes if anyone was interested.

I made cupcakes using this recipe for Valentine's dessert for my husband. This is definitely the best recipe I've found so far for butter cake/cupcakes. I admit I did alter it slightly. I substituted ½ cup of the milk for sour cream and the all-purpose flour for cake flour. Since I was using the recipe for cupcakes instead of a cake I cut the cook time to 20 minutes. The cupcakes were amazing! Light and fluffy with a crispy buttery top and very moist. In addition to the texture being great the flavor was also wonderful. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This is my go to recipe anytime I need to whip up a last minute cake or cupcakes. It's so simple that I allow my 3 year old to assist. Today we tried something new. A very simple change. We substituted the white sugar with light brown organic sugar. The butter did not cream the same probably due to brown sugar's high moisture content but the end result was wonderful. The cake had hints of a rich caramel flavor plus a golden color. Will definitely do this again when whipping up cakes for Christmas. Thank you for this simple and yummy recipe.

I really like this cake.  Per others suggestions, I added one more egg yolk and 2 tblsp of butter. I also creamed the butter and sugar for 5 minutes before adding anything else.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this recipe yesterday and i would say that the flavor is good but I don't really like the texture. Like a lot of people, the texture is like cornbread. I think that it tastes a lot better after I let it sit overnight. It became a lot more moist.

I LOVE this recipe, this is my go to recipe for all vanilla and butter requests I get. It's always moist and super yummy, I always get nothing but raves when I make a cake with this recipe. I do add just a bit more of vanilla extract and I also wrap the layers in plastic wrap over night to help lock in the moisture.

This is a sturdy cake that can with stand a good heavy butter cream frosting. It does not crumb easily when frosted. However, it is rather dry and is a little lacking in flavor.

I love that this makes one small cake.  For a butter cake it has less butter but still tastes like a butter cake.  I am downgrading this to 4 stars for two reasons, it fell in the centre (likely I took it out too early) and it was quite sweet.  That being said, it is an ideal cake and size for my family and will be made again.

I have only used this once but am planning to use it again on Christmas Eve.  I have been looking for a cake with this exact texture for years!  I use it to make "jam-cakes" -- you use a cooking cutter to cut out circular pieces of pie crust and put them into cupcake/muffin pans.  Then put a spoonful of raspberry preserves into the pie crusts, then top them with cake mixture.  Be careful not to use too much preserves!  My mother used to make these and I've been trying for years to make them, but the box cake mixes are way too light and spongy, and until now I haven't found another cake recipe that fits the bill.  Thanks for much for sharing this!

Well, I read the reviews that said not using pastry flour and/or not beating until creamy caused a cornbread-like consistency.  I use an electric grain grinder, so I put it on the finest setting and creamed the ingredients using a Kitchen-Aid for forever.  And the first comment???  "Is there cornmeal in these?"

I didn't find this to be coarse at all.  It was super fluffy and delicious.  Very easy recipe to follow.  I had whole vanilla beans so I put the seeds in and it made a beautiful vanilla bean cupcake.  Definitely saving this recipe.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, making sure that my butter/sugar was very well creamed. This cake has a spongy texture, but feels more dense than an angel food cake. I think it most resembles a coffee cake in terms of texture.  I also threw in some chopped fresh strawberries and it was so yummy. I love that this recipe is so versatile and you can add fresh seasonal fruit, jams, frostings, whatever to make a cake for whatever mood you're in. I bet this cake would be great in pineapple upside down cakes too! This will be a definite go-to recipe for me.

REALLY moist and delicious cake.      I substituted the milk with vanilla soy milk, and poured the mixture into a 9 in. square pan.  The cake was browned on top after 30 minutes and had a really spongy, moist texture.    Also, I made butterscotch topping with random stuff from my cabinet.    1 stick butter  2 cups butterscotch chips  1 cup dark brown sugar  1 tsp. vanilla extract    I cooked down the sauce on my stovetop, then poured the sauce over the cake immediately after it came out of the oven.  SO good!!

Wonderful cake! I followed the directions except I added a packed of french vanilla instant pudding mix. The cake came out very dense (not like corn bread) with a really good flavor. I iced it with my peanut butter cream cheese icing. So far I've gotten rave reviews for it. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions exactly, a rare event, and the cake was Very Wet.  I had to burn the outside, to cook the inside, and it was domed.  When I shaped the cake, to layer however, the inside was perfectly moist and tasted great!!!  I will make this again, adding less milk, and review again.

This is a great basic recipe for a butter cake.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar so I changed the recipe a bit.  I also baked it in a convection oven on 325 for 35 minutes.  It came out golden brown, extremely moist and a crust that had just a bit of a crunch.   Yumm!!!

This is a very good cake recipe for cupcakes or as a base for Boston Cream Pie.   Be careful not to overcook, 50 minutes was too long in my oven, I will begin to check it at 40 minutes. '  Good Buttery flavor, with a slightly crispy top.

I read through the reviews hoping that when I made it that it wasn't like cornbread....it was. It had the texture of cornbread. But it still tasted good and looked pretty!!! I wish I knew why it was like cornbread because I beat the heck out of the butter/sugar mixture. Maybe I will have to try cake flour. But it was still very yummy!

I doubled this recipe and used a 9x13 baking dish. It's important if you want 
great results, you follow the directions closely. I made sure to whip the fats and the sugar until fluffy, sift the dry ingredients and alternate the dry ingredients with the wet (ie, milk). My cake came out incredible. I frosted this cake with the Special Buttercream Frosting also from this site. Great pairing. I'd make this again. This was a fun weekend recipe to make with my oldest boy.

YUMMMY!!  I just took out the mini cupcakes from the oven and they are delicious!! I read other reviews about the texture but mine came out perfect.  They are just the tinyiest bit more dense than a box cake mix.  PERFECT!!  I poured the rest of the batter in a round cake pan that is still in the oven, I am sure that it will turn out just as great!

I really creamed well the butter mixture.  Added a little extra vanilla.  Then once it all came together I beat it on high with my mixer for atleast 2 minutes until I got the consistency of the store bought batter.  I will definetly use this again!

Great success for this 1st time baker !!! For really, I am so proud of myself with the result and help from this recipe and all the + & - ratings. The cake came out great. Pretty moist and yummy !!! It turned out taking 55 mins with my oven. Didn't came out like a corn bread at all. 

After reviewed many different ratings, I have taken some advices and changed the recipe a little by adding 1 more egg, 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Since this is my first time baking, I would not know the difference if I didn't have more eggs or vanilla. But, this pleasent experence have given me great confident for my next attempt, (after I have finished this cake with my family) I will probably try the same recipe with wallnuts or bluebarries, ... will also take other advice to try and add 2 more tsp of butter too so see how it come out.

Bake-on !!!

I followed the recipe exact, just added 1/4c of lemon juice to two layers of the cake, and the zest of one lemon and one orange. Wonderful cake for easter dinner. Will make again.

This is a pancake in a cake pan.  That's what it tasted like to me.  Too brown and crunchy on the top.  Overflowed in my oven also.

This recipe was wonderful. I made the cake into cupcakes and though it looked like cornbread, it did not taste like cornbread at all! I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the recipe and a little extra sugar. The texture was not too dense or cornbread like. As another person said, I think it is important to cream the butter well as well as to cream the sugar, butter, and egg mixture well as well. I will make this again!

Nice and moist and rich.  I ran out of white sugar (oops!) so I had to use about half a cup of brown to make up the difference.  I served it with fresh strawberries, icecream (vanilla) and a little drizzle of good balsalmic vineager.  And my husband enjoyed fresh fruit!

I loved this cake!  I made cupcakes with it, and friends at work loved it too.  Mine was light, buttery, and moist.  Some reviews thought the cake was like corn bread. It is a little more dense than some cakes, but I really liked that about it.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon for extra flavour. I was out of butter so I used butter flavored Crisco. The texture was lighter than when I used butter.

I have used this recipe many many times before I turn vegan. Then I easily veganized the recipe since it doesn't strongly rely on eggs. I use egg replacer, soy milk and non-hydrogenized soy margerine and it always turn out great. I lost my print-out during my family relocation. Thankfully, this recipe is still online!

Also made a homemade chocolate buttercream. Only thing I would add is that even with a normal coating of no stick spray the center stuck to the pan. But it was very moist and was a great end to a great dinner.

It tastes great.  I have had trouble with over mixing which made the cake dense.  Not sure if I should mix less or add more baking powder.  Also thinking of using cake flower instead of all purpose flour.  I chose to top mine with peaches and a sprinkle of powdered sugar instead of frosting.

I made this cake for Christmas. It was wonderful!! I want to start making things from scratch instead of the box and this was the first recipe I found. I did tweak the recipe a bit based on the reviews by adding one extra egg yolk and another tsp of vanilla. It came out soft, moist and very tasty !!! Now I just need to work on decorating skills ??

The best cake ever, I modified it to make it like a cake from back home. I added pineapple juice instead of milk and added rum ... and to top it off Italian meringue not the buttercream just Italian meringue ????????.. to die for. Now can someone help him figure out how to double up the recipe to make 1 lb of cake and adjust all the other ingredients accordingly so I dont mess it up.. thank you in advance

This cake was delicious and super easy to make.  I used store bought frosting and it was tasty.  I also ate it with my morning coffee, Downton Abbey style.

I made this for my son’s Birthday Party and it was incredible! I doubled the recipe to make it into a 2-layer, 8” round cake. I followed the suggestions of others and added one extra egg to the doubled recipe (if not doubling, just add one extra egg yolk). I used a traditional buttercream frosting (half butter/half shortening). There was nothing leftover! I will definitely be making this again!

I made this cake in a rush using my stand mixer, and it worked out great! It was baked, out of the pan, and ready to frost in less than an hour. We made it in a ghost-shaped pan, I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and that was a good amount for that pan. Took it to the Halloween party, frosted it there with leftover icing from the freezer, and it was a big hit. Everyone commented on how delicious it was, and it was gone very quickly. I almost always bake cakes that are chocolate or otherwise strongly flavored, but this was a refreshing change and really, really good!

I was anxious to try this recipe and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed. I did everything the way I was supposed to and it just isn't very good. it's a bit dense. The sides are very crunchy even though I cooked it a little less. It's lightly sweet which is alright I guess. It wasn't what I was expecting. I definitely won't be making it again and wouldn't recommend.

Easy to make, and lemon juice can be substituted for other flavours - orange/brandy etc. Makes a great base for layered cake, paired well with lavender buttercream.

Loved this cake. I had to bake it 10 to 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for but it turned out great. I love the fact that it makes an 8 by 8 cake. It's perfect size for my husband and I.
One thing that surprised me was the thickness of the batter. It has been my experience previously that when the batter was that thick the cake turned out like a souffle. That was not the case for this cake. It baked up perfectly!

This recipe is as easy as it gets and absolutely delicious. It is a dense cake and I made it to be unfrosted and used for strrawberry shortcake. It was amazing.  Very easy to make and of course, always use real butter. I also cut back on the sugar (3/4 cup) and that was plenty, even to eat plain (yeah, I snuck a piece, had to taste test, you know).  Was tender and a good crust since it cooled in the pan and I was not frosting. Reminds me of the one egg yellow cake my mama made. Outstanding!!

My husband bought a gallon of strawberries today and I wanted a simple vanilla cake to put them on. This was perfect! I whipped it up while supper was cooking, very easy. The cake was so soft and just sweet enough for strawberries and whipped cream, no frosting needed! I used SR flour instead of AP only because I was out. I'm going to sub lemon extract and a little poppyseed next time.

It was the night before my daughter's birthday and I realized I had no cake mix in the house & she loves vanilla.  I turned this recipe into cupcakes for her to take to school & they were a big hit.  Will be using this recipe instead of a mix from now on.

I made no changes to the recipe. Baked it exactly as the directions indicated. I don't know if it needed more butter, but this cake tasted exactly like Jiffy Cornbread to me and my family members who tasted it. :(

My go-to cake recipe for basic cake; I have yet another one in progress (waiting for eggs and dairy to get to room temperature) to go with the strawberries I got at the farmer's market.  It tastes better than cake mixes, it's not hard to make, and I usually have the ingredients in the kitchen for sudden-onset cake wishes.

I loved making it because it was just enough. The extras I added were half teaspoon of almond flavor and since my sweetheart doesn't like icing on his cakes,  a half cup more of sugar to satisfy his sweet tooth. Next time I'll try it with lemon flavor instead. Awesome.

I have made this cake several times. You really can't just dump everything in, stir and expect a light cake. There is a reason it's "from scratch." If you want to just dump, stir, and pour, Pillsbury makes a good one. For this cake, cream the butter, butter and sugar, then with the eggs. Follow the recipe instructions, alternating flour/milk, etc and you will have a wonderful cake. Stands up very well to fondant and heavy buttercream!

I honestly liked this recipe.I have been trying cakes from scratch and they always come out to dense.When I made this one,I followed the instructions and looked at and batter and tasted it.It seemed a little floury(not to mention my butter and sugar had a funny texture).I added extra sugar and butter and I was okay with how it tasted.I thought flouring the pan would cause the cake to be dry for some reason.I baked it in a bundt pan and used butter instead but apparently not enough because the top of  the cake got stuck to the bottom of the pan lol.Nontheless the cake tasted good.It was a thick on the outside but I liked it.I might change it a little more next time I make it but for the most part keep it the same.My boyfriend and my cousins loved it ;-)

**Gluten Free** version.... and it came out wonderful!  It's light, fluffy and very tasty.  I followed the directions exactly, except I substituted a Gluten Free flour blend for the cake flour and used almond milk. I made sure to blend the butter/sugar/eggs very well. It's hard to make a fluffy GF cake, but this worked well. One of the best I've made from scratch!

I love the flavor is this cake. I see that some people had a problem with how dense the cake was. I beated my butter alone for a minute or so and then added my sugar and I beated this for an extra 5 minutes. When u add the eggs, beat for a minute after each addition. Also, when adding the flour mixture and the milk be sure to add 3 parts of dry mixture and 2 parts of milk. (Ex: flour mixture,milk,flour mixture, milk,flour mixture) remember to beat very well after each addition but don't over mix. Then, tap the pan(s) in the counter a couple of times before baking. This will make a fluffy and delicious cake  almost cake mix like (ALMOST). My cake took 45 minutes in the oven and turned out great. Definitely making this again. I hope this helped :)

This is a wonderful homemade yellow cake recipe with a lovely flavor and beautiful texture.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in 2 8" round layers,  It came out of the pans very nicely after letting it rest (as the recipe advises).  The only slight change that I made was that I had part of an envelope of vanilla sugar leftover from another recipe and added it in addition to the vanilla extract.  
As a side note, I read some of the reviews claiming that the cake was too dense and tasted of flour.  Flours differ, and measuring it can be an art form, especially for cakes.  My advice would be to spoon the flour LIGHTLY into the measuring cup, and then level it GENTLY.

I followed this recipe exactly, except instead of using 3/4 cup of regular milk I added 3/4 cup of evaporated milk. This cake turned out amazing! Definitely a great recipe that I will use often. I paired it with a chocolate frosting from this site as well.

Followed this recipe but used the suggestion of others to cream the butter and sugar a bit longer. I added apple slices on top and drizzled a salted rum butter sauce on top. The cake was so moist and appropriately sweet. This is my new favourite recipe!! I will be making this again!

I made Boston Cream Pie with this cake and the result was pretty good. The only thing I'll change next time would be the amount of flour. Not sure if anyone else had this problem but my cake tasted a bit too much like flour.

I love the cake!  I have to say, it even made the "discerning tasters" test.  The timing needed longer. (electric oven) Make sure you beat well in-between for a well-balanced cake.

I used this recipe to make character cupcakes and they turned out beautiful. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes and they got a bit dark.  Next time I will bake at a lower temperature. Sprayed the pan with Bakers Joy no stick baking spray and even the tiniest details came out of the pan perfectly. It made a heavy cupcake with a rich taste.

Crazy as it sounds I added 1/2 a stick of cream cheese, 1/2 tsp of almond extract and an extra pinch of salt to the batter and it came extra moist on the inside with a slightly hard crust around which I love. I baked it in a bundt pan. Gave it 4 because of the changes I made but it's an excellent recipe for a base to play with. We had it with coffee and it was great.

Fantastic! Buttery, soft & just wonderfull with icing or melted butter and sugar poured over it!! To all the nay sayers, stick to boxed cake. This is great, quick and easy and you are able to use any icing and it will compliment. Thank you!

I'm kind of upset with how this turned out. I was going to use this batter to make an oreo cake, and I couldn't! The batter was extremely thick, and even when I added a little but more milk it didn't thin out. The taste isn't too bad, just the texture and density don't suit what I was looking for.

Awesome recipe! It turned out really delicious and fluffy :) just a note, its probably a good idea to take the cake out about 10 or fifteen minutes earlier if you use a larger tin, because it doesnt rise very well, and cannoverbake

I made this as cupcakes for a bake sale (2 batches made 24 cupcakes, baked for about 25 mins).  I found you really have to watch how long you cook them, ake from the oven at golden yellow, don't let them brown at all.  

They sold out at the bake sale almost immediately and were absolutely delicious!  Very buttery and moist.  Expect a denser texture than with mixes or store bought cakes, that is just the way of scratch cakes.  I don't understand where people are getting the cornbread impression...  Apart from the yellow colour (thanks to the egg yolks) there was nothing cornbread about this cake.

The taste of this cake is good.  Could not get out of the pans,,,even with waxed paper on the bottom.  Having to piece some of it together and not happy.  The texture is course and the recipe said bake for 50-55 minutes...way too long.  Tried taking it out of pans after 10 minutes, tried after 30 minutes.  Would Not come out.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made it into a layer cake for my son's birthday.  Everyone thought it tasted great, and my daughter wants me to use the same recipe on her birthday.  My only problem was that the cake didn't easily come out of the pans for me, but I blame myself and not the recipe.

I have to say that it did sort of taste like cornbread. It had a good flavor, but it was very heavy and thick. Not as moist as I expected. I will make again, but will probably use a bundt, tube, or loaf pan next time as it is more like a pound cake.

Delicious! Like MACGREGORS said, this cake holds together and shapes very well. If you're using fondant, make sure you chill your shaped cake before applying your thin layer of icing so all that effort you put into shaping your cake doesn't crumble away... Learned that lesson thae hard way :S

Not great, not awful.  One guest said they tasted like cornmeal.  I didn't think they were that bad.
Edited for second time baking:  MUCH better this time.  I wonder if I had overbeaten it the first?  Upgraded from 3-4 stars.

it was a great light cake that worked well as cupcakes. i just found that you cant make a large batch at one time and that it really needed to mixed well. to finnish up i dusted it with vanilla sugar and it was awesome! over all it was great.

I bake daily.I wanted something NOT chocolate. I DID read all of the reviews before making this so I knew I had a nice firm crust to put a thick buttercream frosting onto. I served my chubby hubby a slice. He said,"It's good but it reminds me of something." As he takes another bite he thinks some more...."I know, CORNBREAD!" He will finish the cake I'm sure. There is a texture issue with this recipe though.

It felt like something was missing... It was sort of lacking in flavor. And my family just really didn't care for it. Thanks for the recipe tho! :)

I did not like this recipe.  The consistently of the cake was course and the flavor was bland.  The children would not even eat it.

ok. Probably the best cake I've made. It is really all in the technique. Having your butter, eggs and milk really makes a HUGE difference. I like to mix my cakes by hand and made sure to alternate the flour mixture and milk slowly into the butter mixure to make sure everything was incorporated. I filled these with raspberry jam and topped it with a peanut butter frosting that I made up. My friends loved these "peanut butter and jelly cupcakes" I made these in mini-muffin pans.

I made this into one of those "rainbow" cakes for my husband's birthday, it was the perfect size for the two of us and he loved the "cornbread" texture.  He said he doesn't like really airy/fluffy cakes, so this one was perfect for us!

I doubled the amounts of everything.  I used 4 instead of 2 eggs, an extra half cup of Spenda.  I baked for 45 mins instead of 50 or 55.  The cake turns out good, moist & buttery.  It's not sweet enough for me.  Next time, I would add 3 cups of Splenda for the recommended 2 cups of sugar.

My father-in-law wanted a yellow cake, and I didn't want to make it from a box and this was perfect.  I combined this cake with the "Pudding Poke Cake" from this site for a chocolate pudding "icing", and it was perfect. I'm definitely not a baker, but the cake was not dry, and a perfect texture and taste.

I made the blueberry version of this and added lemon zest.  I think someone else said this reminded them of cornbread, and I could see why (not sure what it is, maybe the texture... but a bit moister).  I have had cakes like this from bakeries, so it's not bad, but it's just not what I was looking for.

This cake is fantastic.  Perfect for luncheons with friends or with a cup of tea.  I added lemon rind or orange rind for texture and flavor.  I also cook in a spring form pan, it not only tastes good but looks good.  Sprinkle some powdered sugar over the for a simple finish.

I made the blueberry version. This is very good but not the consistancy of box cake mix. It is dense, more like muffin consistancy. It is also done in about 30 minutes.

This was delicious and so, so simple. I used the variation with blueberries and nutmeg; I also added a little lemon extract. It tasted like a giant blueberry muffin, very nice and moist. My husband ate more than half of the thing in one sitting!

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this cake has a bit of a flour taste to it.  I gave it four stars because I think it would be a great base to experiment with.  I would like to try adding spices and a streusel topping to serve as a coffee cake.  The blueberries the author suggested might be good as well.
