Boy is this a great recipe!  I had the front window open and a neighbor and the UPS man stopped by to ask what was cooking!  A couple of things that are not mentioned in the recipe but are in the video - first Chef John used a mortar and pestle to grin the caraway seeds - well let me tell you caraway does not like to be crushed, but this is really an essential part of the recipe, if you have a spice grinder - use it, otherwise be prepare for some heavy duty crushing with the mortar and pestle.  Also, cool the skillet between doing the onions and toasting the spices - I came dangerously close to burning those preciously ground spices!  The video recommends simmering with the lid off - which I did and is probably also why the neighbors came asking about dinner.  This was a rich and beautiful stew - company worthy for sure, especially on a cold fall or winter evening.

Absolutely delicious! I added about half a green pepper, diced and sauteed along with the onion, which I had seen in other Goulash recipes. Went light on the cayenne pepper. (Chef John's nothing without his red pepper!) This was simple, delectable and even better the next day. Served over buttered egg noodles. Will make again! Thanks Chef John! Highly recommended, and I would encourage the grinding of the caraway along with the use of fresh marjoram if at all possible.

Dad & I thought it was alright but it was w-a-y too zippy for the four kidlets ages 10 and under.  If I ever make this again, it'll be with serious alterations.

We loved this!  It's true it is a little spicy, so if you're sensitive to heat just cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit.  We think the noodles and sour cream tamed the spice for us.  I was afraid at first it was going to be a little too vinegary, but when it was done....nope.  It was really tasty and perfect for a cold night.  Smelled great while simmering, but be sure to keep it at a simmer with no lid so it reduces properly.  A keeper in this house for sure.

Merriam-Webster's definition of "goulash": (1) a dish of meat, vegetables, and paprika that is slowly cooked in liquid; (2) a mixture of different things.

And that's exactly what this recipe is.  Plus, it's a delicious mix of flavors (as evidenced by the many, many 5-star reviews) -- perfect for a cold winter's night!

This recipe is phenomenal!  I printed out the recipe and my husband was the one who wanted to make it - the beef turned out so tender and my 15yr old son called the sauce "pure flavour" and "intensely beef-y" and asked that this be put into the recipe rotation!  He's learning to cook now, so maybe he'll make it the next time.  Thanks, Chef John.

Another winner from Chef John! . It is simply delicious with many layers of flavor and interest. I left out the cayenne because I didn't want it spicy. And really loved the flavor. Thanks Chef John for another fabulous recipe to add to my repitoire.

This is a great recipe.  Since it did not specify whether to use spicy or sweet paprika, I used a bit of both.  Also, made sure I used traditional Szeged Hungarian Paprika (lucky for me it was on sale when I went to purchase)---I think it makes a difference.  Be sure to watch the goulash the last 10-15 minutes.  You want to make sure the liquid has cooked down enough but not too much that it burns.  Great recipe, Chef John!

I get very irritated when people say "that's not authentic Hungarian"  not only have I read but cooked 100's of Hungarian recipes, the one thing that is authentic is the use of paprika, onions and sour cream after that it's anyone's guess!  Recipes for Goulash very from family to family and region of the country that family came from I grew up with a thick soup like goulash, some of you would call thick soup "stew", my family never used caraway seeds and didn't put tomato in either, doesn't mean it wasn't authentic,  just because your Hungarian grandma or mine didn't make it this way doesn't mean it's not right.

Absolutely stunning dish! Made Chef John's Goulash as written and it was perfection! I am shameless tweeker, I'll admit it. No need with this recipe, though. If you are intimidated by rich, intense flavored ethnic dishes, then this recipe may not be for you and, as another reviewer wrote, may not be too kid friendly. However, if you have a palate that loves new experiences, please give this recipe a whirl. Hooray for leftovers!

Exceptional recipe for a cold winter's night!  I made this recipe as Chef John recommended, but I also added 1 more onion, 5 stalks of celery (chopped), 2-14 oz. cans stewed tomatoes, 5 medium potatoes, and 1 1/4 cup chopped carrots.  The recipe's seasonings are so flavorful they can easily flavor the added vegetables.

If you want Beef Goulash like they eat in Hungary this is the thing. I have eaten it there and it was just like this. Great job with the video as well!

My sweetie raves over this dish. Just the right amount of bite/heat. I baked it in a Dutch oven at 300 degrees for 3 hours. Will definitely make this again, maybe even for company.

This is the second of Chef Johns recipes that I've tried and I'm 2 for 2.  I made it almost exactly as written, didn't leave anything out, but did up the paprika.  Hubby loved it, he keeps saying I should open a restaurant.

So good! I tried it once with chicken stock and the next time with beef as some have suggested. Both were amazing but I think we'll be sticking with the beef from now on. It's quickly become a firm favourite!! Three for three - Go Chef John!

My family spent several years in Germany and have had this stew or soup there and up until today have never found a recipe that came close to what we had in Germany. With exception of changing the chicken broth to beef broth, THIS RECIPE IS SPOT ON! Thank you Chef John from Ohio!!!

Love this hearty stew!  Couldn't wait to have this again since making it a couple of months ago.  I whimped out and used half the caraway and cayenne. The only ingredient I didn't have is marjoram.  The only advice is to watch for the sodium use.  When the broth reduces, it'll get salty.

Full of flavor, and simple to make.  Loved this!  I actually threw this together after work without advance planning... I pulled some stew meat out of freezer & happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  Didn't have enough stew meat, so added in some sliced carrots after awhile.  My family of five really liked this!!  Next time, I will garnish w/ a dollop of sour cream which I think will add much to the flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful tasty dish but BE WARNED! Use the proper cut of meat. First time I used check roast and it was perfect. Being a big dummy I tried it with round roast, (was on sale) and very tough, yet still tasty. I will make this again and again.

Thank you Chef John for another wonderful recipe!  Every one of yours I have tried has been great!  This was delicious as written, although I did cut back on the spice a little (I admit I'm a wimp).  Next time I may put full amount in.  There certainly are some rude people here.  Ignore them, your recipes are fantastic :)

This was absolutely amazing.

I grew up living next door to a Hungarian family and this is virtually identical to the way they'd make it.    

Fantastic.   Utterly fantastic!

I bought a cut of beef chuck accidentally thinking it was steak tips and then had to find a recipe to use it in. I've never had Goulash before but the recipe sounded interesting, and didn't turn out to be any more difficult or time consuming than any beef stew recipe would. I was a little concerned about the texture of the beef while it was cooking because it was pretty tough until the very end of the 2 hours. In the end it turned out fantastic, even better the next day. Can't go wrong with Chef John... Thanks!!

Wow!!!! This was wonderful!!!  Made it exactly as written, except only using half the cayenne. Served over wide fettuccini with a salad.  I bought the Hungarian Paprika to use.  I don't know if it would make a difference using Spanish Paprika, but I don't want to find out.  I don't have a pestle, so I put the caraway seeds into the corner of a plastic sandwich bag and crushed, or sort of crushed, them with the flat side of a meat tenderizer.  It seemed to work fine, even if they weren't finely ground.  Thank you, Chef John!  This will be a regular dinner recipe at our house!

Dear chef John! As a Hungarian I think your recipe is not bad at all  -  but  -  and here is the only big difference. In Hungary if you make goulasch you add the EQUAL amounts of meat and onions! Believe me, if you cook it long and slow, the onions will disolve!

Who cares what the recipe is called and whether it's true to its name or not! All that matters is how it tastes and it tastes fantastic! My husband is in the kitchen licking the pot.

WAY TO SPICY. THE GOULASH DIDN'T THICKEN LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE. IT DIDN'T TASTE LIKE HUNGARIAN GOULASH THAT I'VE EATEN IN CHICAGO RESTAURANTS BEFORE. IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE SPICY FLAVOR SPOILED THE MEAL. IF I EVER MADE IT AGAIN I WOULD LEAVE OUT THE CHEYENNE PEPPER.

Was a great recipe, and easy enough to make. I have a picky eater in my home and even he  loved it! If you have chidren in the home, I would recomend using a bit less spice. But we liked it just the way it is. Persnally, I cooked everything in the same stew pot. I just put the meat and onions aside while I heated the spices. Then just continued the recipe as written.

The meat was very tender after 2 hours of cooking but it had too much caraway seeds. I may try this again with the amount and use pork instead.

This recipe has a delicious rich taste and a touch of spike to keep things exciting. I'd recommend serving it over a bed of fresh spaetzle. It keeps well also. Another triumph of a recpie by Chef John!

I made as stated and watch the video before hand. I thought it was ok, my husband and daughter thought it was "good". There were a lot of spices that I had never used before, caraway, Hungarian paprika and marjoram. To be fair I don't think I am a fan of caraway. It was a little spicy, I thought it tasted better with the sour cream, I had it both ways. If I made this again, I might just change up a few spices for my taste, I liked how tender the meat was with this cooking technique and would have never thought to heat the spices.

Superb recipe.  Added quartered button mushrooms, other veggies to use up, and doubled the Hungarian sweet paprika.   5 stars, thanks Chef John!

5th time making this.  Can't say enough how much we enjoy this.  Make this without hesitation.  Do add a carton of baby bella sliced mushrooms before browning up those sliced onions.  Thanks, Chef John!

My first Chef John recipe and it was a keeper.  My family loved it.  It did take some time to prep, but well worth it.  I added sour cream to my first serving and none to my second.  It did add that extra something.

9/12/2017  This turned out really good. I do not pretend to write "reviews" because I generally make some changes to  everything, even baked goods because of high altitude; so when I stir up a "concoction" that did not suit my tastes I could never legitimately offer an opinion. I was a little guy in the 'forties when cooking was....and home canning, butchering, etc. was the norm and my mother was a great "everything" homemaker, she cooked up many "mixtures" that had no name or title except GOOD and many just got called goulash. I learned to cook from this fine lady during a time when the Grocer was an adventure, "supermarket" was not even a word and oranges were a real occasion at Christmas.
I really enjoy and value all the contributors to "ALLRECIPES" and the great convenience it is to reference so many, many different dishes and methods. Thanks to everyone !

I made it according to the video and it turned out great. If you like it a little thinner add more chicken broth. It is supposed have a little zip to it that is why you have all the wonderul herbs.  Change the type of paprika if you don't like a hint of heat, but i wouldn't make it without it.

Left out the cayenne as we didn't have any (and I'm not a fan of hot food) but what was made was amazing. Very rich and meaty, will definitely add it to my rotation.

Very good recipe.  A couple suggestions if you're trying this: paprikas vary greatly.  If your paprika is spicy that might be enough heat.  If it's sweeter or you're concerned about spice - start with 1/4 tsp cayenne and add more before reducing the liquid if you need it.  Also, use a spice grinder for the caraway seeds - you need them ground really well.  I added 4 carrots just to have a little vegetables and I'd probably do 6 next time.  I'd also add one more bay leaf.  And finally, I cooked this on the grill in a cast iron dutch oven at 300 degrees with indirect heat.  Once done cooking (approx 2 hours), I put it on high direct heat, uncovered it and reduced for 15 or 20 minutes.  Really good!

It's the only way I cook beef now - the flavour is so rich and full of umph! Plus the house smells incredible for the whole day. I skip on cayenne since the freshly ground black pepper adds enough heat on its own.

After my second time, I went out and bought a spice grinder just so that I can grind the caraway seeds for this recipe :)

The sauce was excellent, but the meat was tough. I think I will look for a recipe that cooks longer so the meat has time to get tender.

Overall, it's a good recipe but not a wow recipe for me. Tip:  If you find it difficult to cut fresh chuck roast, put in the freezer for 10 minutes or so and it'll be easier to portion.   I followed the recipe with slight exceptions:  I used a bit more garlic than it calls for, and I added about a half of a green bell pepper which I cooked with the onions.   As the caraway and marjoram flavors were outside my usual tastes, the novelty was good but I don't find either to offer a wonderful flavor.  I appreciate a bit of kick, so I likely should have increased the cayenne and/or left the sour cream off (

Found Chef John on YouTube; trivets lot of his recipes. All are good, but this one is a fan favorite of everyone that I’ve made it for...
Today I’m trying it in the slow cooker...

This looked and smelled amazing served over egg noodles.  Leftovers didn't last and were good - AH enjoyed the meat more than the noodles, SH and I liked this a lot.

I just made this today (seems kind of weird, since it's summer, but it sounded so good I just had to make it).  This was delicious.  Who knew something so simple could be so good.  The only thing I changed was I omitted the caraway, as I just don't like it.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Hubby said I can make this one again so, I know he loved it!  LOL

I love this recipe. The only thing I changed is I reduced the amount of caraway seeds to 1 teaspoon. I felt it overwhelmed the other flavors.  Other than that it is my mother's goulash from Germany!

* Disclaimer: This is no doubt a 5-star recipe as written; my tweaks are due only to personal preference.

Wow, so good. I toasted the spices and herbs (no caraway seeds) in a dry skillet while the onions were sauteeing in the beef drippings.  Also used red wine vinegar in place of balsamic. 

Thanks as always, Chef John!

This was really good!  My grandma used to make it after she watched one of her childhood friends make it (no written recipe).  It tastes just like what I remember. This was easy to make & the long, slow cooking made it even better.  Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

A+ I've been cooking my mom's Beef Goulash recipe for 25 years now, but this one is hands down the best. Being German and born in Yugoslavia, her recipe is authentic. Slight changes I made: No sugar, 1/3 the called for caraway seeds, and finally I added an entire 12oz jar of Trader Joe's Fire Roasted Red Peppers, pureed in a food processor.

First time I have made it.  My mother recently went to Hungary and brought me paprika which lead me to search for a recipe using this spice.  Turned out perfect and wonderful.  Everyone raved about it, my mother even loved it and she had authentic comparisons.  Next time though i will add vegetables which this recipe doesn't include.

Wat too much cayenne, and I like spicy food. Unless your tongue is challenged or the cayenne is stale, unlike mine which was fresh from a well-know purveyor of spices here in NYC, I'd say that you safely cut the amount by half.

This dish was awesome. However, we did not reach the thick stew consistency it was very liquid. Instead of sour cream we used Greek yogurt which thickened it a little. It. But I will say the depth of flavor is fantastic especially two days later as leftovers. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!  Used beef broth rather than chicken broth.  Also added cut up small potatoes, carrots and peas as my husband is used to Goulash with veggies.  I baked the goulash in the oven at 325 degrees for 3 hours, added the veggies and another 2 cups broth as my husband likes goulash like a soup, then baked another hour.  Meat was so  tender and moist.  Definitely the best recipe we've found, and wouldn't hesitate to serve it for company.

This has become my very favorite way to do a "beef stew". It's rich and dark and very flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly, so unlike me, but if I am reviewing a recipe I should follow it! I ground my own spices and I served it with egg noodles and a dollop of sour cream. Crazy delicious every single time. My family an guests (yes serve it!) love this one. I want to put my entire face in this. Love you Chef John!

This one is a keeper.  I usually leave out the caraway seeds and hot pepper (family preference), and it really does need HUNGARIAN  paprika.  Great served with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

One of the best recipes I've obtained from All Recipes, and I've made dozens. The only modifications I made were reducing the added salt and not using the caraway (my wife doesn't care for it). The depth of flavor was amazing.

I made this today - I made half the amount as there is only two of us. I wish I would have made the whole recipe! I would not change anything. I did simmer uncovered for the last hour so that it would thicken a little more. The flavor was exactly what I was hoping for and will definitely make,it again!

I thought I was sitting in my Grandmothers kitchen! She was from Austria and this turned out just like my memories. I've made a different version of what I thought my Grandmother prepared, no more ... This is my Go To from now on! I've passed it onto family members so they too can enjoy this awesome recipe! 
Thank you, Chef John!

I have been making this for a few years now. This is one of those comfort foods recipes for me. I usually use the half sharp Hungarian paprika from Penzey's along with their cayenne, it gives it a decent heat.

One of our favorites! However I follow all the steps up until simmering it. I just throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker and it does the rest.

Will definitely make this again.  Husband loved it.  Kids were so-so on it, but that is how they roll with anything new.  Perhaps a bit spicy (which my husband loved), so if spicy is not your thing, you may need to adjust the seasonings.  I will say however, that I found it just right and I don't like things as spicy as my husband.

I've made this recipe,as directed, at least 3 times and it's delicious. The aroma of beef, paprika and caraway is out of this world - and it's a nice departure from the usual pot roast seasoning.  Love this recipe.

Loved it. Gives you a spicy mouth afterward, and during eating, is just the right amount of spicy deliciousness. I agree - probably a bit too spicy for a young kiddo, but perfect for adults! We didn't let it simmer the whole time, so it was a little watery, but I'd guess we'll be impatient to eat it in the future [again] so will hit it with some cornstarch next time. Bravo!

I made this tonight on a snowy day. Perfect day to make it because it needs to simmer for several hours. I followed the recipe exactly and all I can say is it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This was really good. My husband loved it. He could smell it before he got into the house. I tried to do it exactly as written. I ran out of paprika (and couldn't even find Hungarian paprika at the store) and was at least a couple of teaspoons short. I used just a tad less cayenne because so many said it was too much. Also I followed the written recipe which called for ground thyme. Later I watched the video and he used dried thyme. None of it mattered. The flavors were amazing. I highly recommend it.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and the goulash turned out smelling and tasting phenomenal. I made buttered egg noodles and cauliflower steak to go with it and my husband and I devoured it all. I made it again later for some friends and their boys loved it, too (10 and 12 years old), the spices were definitely not too much for them. I did take the advice of others and made sure to cool my skillet before toasting the spices, otherwise the recipe is perfect as is. Five very satisfied and satiated stars for this amazing dish!

WOW!  Another keeper from Chef John.  This is so tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, however I didn't have Hungarian Paprika so I had to use the paprika I had.  Great comfort food.  We had this with egg noodles, and the leftovers were even better!  Thanks again for another HIT Chef John.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was spectacular!!! The only thing I did differently was to cut the cayenne in half (my 3 y.o. granddaughter was eating this and loving it by the way and she doesn't like meat!). It was easy to prepare and super luscious. I think the caraway really makes it especially toasting it in the skillet first. I made this for a party of 15 and they all went home with the recipe! Thanks Chef John :-)

Chef John, You rock!  This is a fabulous, delicious recipe.  Make just as is; if you don't make as written, don't review it ( not fair).  Maybe it's authentic and maybe it's not, but who cares.  It's delicious even for the old folk and the young folk in our family.  The egg noodles (homemade, please) and sour cream make it extra special.  Always love to try Chef John recipes because I always know that they will be really good without being too difficult for me to want to make or too fancy-gourmet for my midwestern family ranging from age 4 to 87 to want to eat.  Thanks again!

Great Combination of Spices! Followed recipe as written - used all ingredients as written without substitutions. Also if too spicy, sour cream on side - perfect gravy and tender meat.  I did add carrots and mushrooms. My family, happy with unique smoky spiciness.

Made it during Chicago snowstorm, and served it with egg noodles, crusty bread, and red wine. Perfect dinner!

Very good!  my ex in-laws are from Hungary and this is pretty close to Suzie's recipe.  I don't remember caraway seeds being in it.  I don't like them--I would have remembered those.  She also made the same dish with chicken and boneless pork.  YUM!  and to the person that said this is supposed to be a soup.  You are wrong--goulash is a stew like meal

I thought I did everything as written, but my beef never softened even after slow cooking for over 2 hours. Perhaps I overcooked it at the beginning, although I followed timing and temperature instructions.  The sauce was good, but too salty.  It was too much work for not a very good result.  This is the first recipe of Chef John's I've not loved.  I won't be trying it again.

Super yum!!  I didn't have caraway seeds so I subbed a tiny pinch of dry fennel seeds. It was still superb, can't wait to make better with caraway next time. Used a big Sweet Onion, no cayenne, and 1/2 cup less chicken broth in cooking. Whole family enjoyed. Rich and zesty.

I used to have to eat my babysitter's goulash when I was a kid and it was so bad that I never made it until now.  I have to say that this was probably the one of my most favorite dishes ever.  My 10 and 14 year old and husband thought it was fabulous as well.  My son and husband argued over who got to keep the tiny bit of leftovers.  
I didn't have a few things and so just used what I had.  I had no caraway seeds or marjoram.  I added a 1 tsp of Famous Dave's Rib Rub and increased sugar to 1 TBL.  I increased tomato paste to 1/2 cup and chicken broth to 3 1/2 C so it would get thicker faster.  We used one of our buffalo roast. Since I didn't have 2 1/2 hours I cut my meat up into tiny pieces and after I sauteed them I added them to 3 cups chicken broth to get them boiling and tender. So I cooked and simmered for about 1 1/4 hours.  The meat was very tender and the taste incredible.  It had a small bite to it, but nothing too spicy.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this many times again for my family and our family get togethers.

I have made Hungarian goulash for several years and have never seen sugar nor sweet vinegar added.  I have added apple cider vinegar which helps tenderize the meat and adds some flavor.  Neither have I ever added tomato paste, but I have used ripe tomatoes.  So, it was OK, but I'll rely on my own recipe.  I also add one or two or more Hungarian peppers, sliced or whole depending on who will partake of the stew/soup.  I also use bacon fat reserved from breakfasts, and smoked Hungarian paprika.

Way too spicy for everyone's taste.  I had doubled the recipe for 8 servings.  I had to rinse the meat and reserved a few tablespoons of the gravy.  I had beef broth and made a regular gravy and put the meat in the new gravy and served over a fresh batch of noodles. If I would use this recipe again, I will delete the cayenne pepper and the teaspoon of ground black pepper.

Dish was delicious. Alas, neither myself or my downstairs neighbor had caraway, but it was fantastic. The video was very helpful to see how it should be looking as it goes.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe to others. I don't eat beef that often, so it'll probably be one of my special dinners in the future.

WAY too much onion and caraway for us.  Would likely scale back to one onion and 1/2-1 tsp caraway.  I did appreciate the complex flavor, but even after 2 hrs, the beef was still not tender and the onions had boiled away to nearly nothing. Had I keep simmering trying to tenderize the beef, the rest of it would have scorched.  On the advice of others, I used beef broth instead of chicken and omitted the cayenne due to kids.  I think next time I'd also increase the broth by 1 cup to give a little more time to tenderize, and add a bit more tomato paste and balsamic.  I also did this stovetop this time, but may try it in my instant pot or slow cooker next go-round.  Still, a good base to work from, and it was tasty even though we didn't quite get there.

I have made this recipe several times and the family enjoyed it very much.  The only changes I make are to reduce the paprika to 1 tablespoon hot Hungarian paprika and only use a pinch of cayenne pepper.  If you like it very hot, go for it as written.

I made it the first time as written and it was very good. My family said it felt too meaty. They suggested I add vegetables in. I appreciate that doing so alters the recipe but I thought I’d share for those who wanted to try a variation.

This was excellent!  I used my pressure cooker to make sure it was good and tender.  I served it over Semmelknoedel with Gurkensalat for Christmas dinner!  Fabulous.

This is definitely not a traditional gulyas, however, it is an excellent recipe, and more like a hungarian porkolt (beef & onion stew). Very good. Highly recommend trying. Is a bit spicy so omit or reduce amount of cayenne if serving children. I am of hungarian descent and my family loves this recipe.

Super yummy! Like others have mentioned, this was very spicy! I had someone bring me Hungarian Paprika recently and I used a teaspoon of the Hot and a teaspoon of the sweet paprika and glad I didn’t go with the tablespoons as instructed. —maybe this paprika is spicier than the usual stuff in the pantry?

I made this recipe yesterday, and it was delicious. I wasn't sure, because the smell of the caraway seeds was a bit over powering for my tastes, but it turned out great. Especially with the sour cream added at the end.

Absolutely delicious !!!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great, and tasted just like the goulash my mom used to make (maybe better).  Only thing I omitted was the bay leaf.  Thank you Chef John !!!

I made this also, & Yes I put my own spin on it as well. I never liked American goulash, but this is the Bomb. I will make it again and again.  Sadly i didn't think about taking a photo.

This was delicious. I don't normally like caraway, but knew this needed it for the right flavour. It was so rich and good, the only change I made was to cut back the cayenne pepper a bit. I served it over buttered noodles, with a salad and fresh buns and my husband almost licked his plate clean. Thank you for sharing Chef John, I feel like your recipes are always reliably good.

This turned out wonderful! I used a cheaper cut of meat and slow cooked everything (for 8 hours on Low), rather than simmer. I also added one green pepper. Will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe a lot, it's one of our favorites. Recently becoming a mom of twins, I don't have the time to follow the orginal instructions for preparing. So tonight for the first time I tried this is the slow cooker, nothing browned or toasted just thrown into the pot and it turned out perfectly. I was worried not following the steps would change it, but it didn't. Only thing I changed was I added a little easy blend the last half hour to make it a bit thicker, as I serve it over spaztle.

We loved this, but a couple of us thought it was too hot (spicy).  Served it over rice and with a dollop of sour cream,  which cut down on the spicy.  Will definitely make again.

The flavors were wonderful, the beef so tender, but my broth was too thin. Not sure what I did do wrong, but will try next time with less chicken broth.

5 star rating! This is delicious, I added some carrots after about an hour of simmering and added a little more stock as I like it a little soupier (at Chef Johns suggestion).  My neighbours are drooling at the smell drifting out to the hallway!! The cayenne really does have a  kick but I like it spicy so all good. I suggest you half the amount called for if spicy isn't your thing.  Every recipe I've tried of Chef Johns is a winner, his recipes are my go to when I need inspiration for dinner. Thanks for another great one!

The best beef stew recipe I've made, ever. I threw everything into a slow cooker instead of a stock pot, and the onions were like butter, and the meat was tender soft velvet. I took the advice of some others and increased the onions for a more authentic taste. It certainly brought back memories of my time in Budapest!

Oh my.  So good.  I made a few changes but stuck close to the recipe with regard to seasonings which is the main thing.  I added two carrots, to celery sticks and 1 1/2 small green peppers.  I added about 1/2 T paprika and 1/2 tsp marjoram and 1/4 tsp thyme.  I may have needed the extra seasoning because I am on a low sodium diet and reduced salt by half and used a very low salt broth.

Wow - Pretty much stuck to John's  recipe with only tweaks where I was lacking the ingredients or that complemented the dish (i.e. no chicken broth, so I used a mix of beef and veggie broth).   Also added a few mushrooms and about a 1/3 of a green pepper, both sauteed with the onions.  Served over buttered egg noodles with sour cream.   Excellent recipe.

I didn't have tomato paste so i used crushed tomatoes. I thickened the broth with a little bet of corn starch mixed with cold water.  I also added about one  half cup of sauteed mushrooms to the recipe when I added the onions.

This is my husbands favourite dish. I can’t even count how many times I have made this. Even with substitutions (fennel, oregano and beef broth) this recipe still turns out great. This is incredible over fresh spaetzle. A five star recipe for sure!

Very yummy!  We watched the Hungarian a Grand Prix and had the goulash to celebrate.  It was really tender and tasty.  We used Spanish paprika as that what we had.  The sour cream was a very nice compliment.  It was over noodles, and next time we might try mashed potatoes.

Wow, this is delicious! Only change was fresh marjoram in place of dried. Otherwise did everything without tweaking. Picky eater husband went back for seconds - no leftovers!

I didn't have Caraway seed so just substituted with fennel. I thought it was just as great. Wow! what a great recipe. Will be making this again and again and again......
Thank  you Chef John for a wonderful recipe to add to my list.

This is probably my favorite recipe that I've ever found! Exactly as instructed, it is flavorful, tender, and delicious. It has just the right amount of spice and, with egg noodles and a little sour cream, it's literally perfect. Chef John Is the bomb!

I didn’t use the paprika or other spices because my mom isn’t a fan of anything spicy. It’s still good even without it. My first time, I used chicken broth, and it was alright, nothing fancy, but this last time I used beef broth and egg noodles, and it came out way better. I also added a little extra tomato paste, and again, left out the spices except for salt and pepper, but this is something I’ll make again.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out stellar. We like spicy so  we were happy this had a bit of a kick to it. Served it on a bed of egg noodle which went over well. The sour cream topping really rounded out the flavor. Will make it again.

Really liked the rich and bold flavours of this recipe. Used half pork and half beef stew meat. I found the stew a level too spicy for my liking, so will reduce they cayenne by 1/2 next time I make this. My husband loved this dish and we served it with potato dumplings with sauerkraut for our Sunday dinner.

This is a very good recipe. The only different I made to it was using smoked paprika and some mushrooms. I think the next time I make it, I'd use less caraway seed though. I think that's was contributes to the "twangy" flavor. I'd also probably use more mushrooms, less liquid, and do it in a crock pot.

I made a double portion so I needed 4 Tbs of Paprika, used 3 Tbs of regular Paprika and 1 Tbs of Hot Hungarian Paprika.  After it was cooking for an hour the flavor got a bit intense as far as heat went, so I added a couple cups of water.  Then I added 3 Tbs of instant potato flakes to thicken it up.  It toned down the spiciness  and thickened it up without compromising the rich flavor. My sons kept stopping by the kitchen to check if it was ready, because it made the whole house smell soooo good.  My husband commented that I was driving the neighbors nuts with the aroma.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream on top of buttery egg noodles.  This is an excellent dish!

I love this stew. The flavors are a little unusual (mostly from the caraway) so the first bite left my taste buds slightly confused, but by the second bite I was shoveling it down. I did futz with the recipe a bit. I doubled it, for starters. From there I added 2 green peppers and a whole bunch of celery. I diced the vegetables moreso than chopped them, so they really cooked down. I upped the paprika just a hair. Contrary to a lot of reviewers, I increased the cayenne pepper by almost 50% - Left me with a heat that isn't painful but does make sure I'm drinking plenty of water. Absolutely perfect.

All the meat eaters in my family loved this flavorful dish. I halved the cayenne pepper as  I am sensitive to spicy foods and I used smoked paprika. This gave the dish the right amount of kick for us!

Wonderful!!  Rather spicy, but I will definitely make again.  The only change I made was to add only 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  My beef wasn't the best, wasn't very tender, am leaving it on the stovetop for a while longer.  I love the consistency- the noodles don't need buttering.  Ate with fresh french bread from neighborhood bakery.  I don't care for all of Chef John's recipes because they are so heavy on the spice, but I will be working with this one to suit me and my family.  Thank you!

Another Chef John winner in our house. I used regular and smoked paprika. The combination of all the spices made this dish very tasty. I had to use red wine vinegar because I didn’t have balsamic. I ground the caraway seeds in my magic bullet. 
Excellent flavour.  Thank you again Chef John.

I have made this every ski season for 3 + years,  not sure why I have not rated it before.  I cook ahead and pack it  to go with the ski gear to heat and serve to an extra hungry bunch of skiers. I double the recipe and add potatoes towards the end to stretch the servings.  * please note that if you are freezing leave out the potatoes they will turn mushy. This recipe rivals anything we get on the slopes in EU.  Chef John your recipes are  my favorites.

I made this today. My paprika said "Hungarian half-sharp". I figured that meant it had some heat so I halved the amount of cayenne. The dish was still pretty hot with spice.I will make it again but with sweet paprika or will omit the cayenne if I use half-sharp.

I halved this recipe as it is just my husband and I and didn't have any leftovers, which in the end was good, because it was way too spicy for our tastes.  Other than that, it was very good. I didn't add as much salt as Chef John does and it still tasted very flavourful and the beef was very tender. I simmered it for 2 1/2 hours so it was very thick. I just added another 1/2 cup of chicken stock for last 1/2 hour and it came out perfect. Next time, I will definitely leave out the cayenne pepper, so don't know if I should make the full recipe so we have some leftovers.  Also, I only cooked 1/2 pound noodles to serve it over but felt we needed more. I'm going to have to play around with this a bit to get it right, but will definitely keep making it.

I followed the recipe pretty carefully, but was not happy with the result. First it was extremely spicy hot. I like hot spicy food, but both my wife and i agreed this was a bit over the top. I would suggest not adding the cayenne pepper indicated and just let the Hungarian Paprika supply the heat. Even after cooking for two hours, my cubed chuck roast was still  a little tougher than expected. I would be inclined to try the recipe in a slow cooker. Finally, I probably will not try to cook again. I was not a fan of the flavor of the caraway seeds. Very distinctive and certainly not a bad taste, but just not a taste I really enjoyed. Not to really criticize the recipe, I just think we discovered we are not fans of goulash.

We always love Chef John's recipes, but this one didn't do it for us.  It was OK, but nothing spectacular.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used regular paprika, as that's what I had on hand.  If I think to buy Hungarian paprika, I may try this again.

Chef John's best dish.  I've made it with both ground beef and beef chuck.  I think the ground beef is better.

Many years  ago I had a fabulous goulash in Europe.  I tried many more while there, but the others didn't compare to the first one    This is the recipe I've been looking for.  Thank you chef John.  While I had some Hungarian  style hot paprika  I used.  I looked on Amazon and found one made in Hungary.  I'll be using it next time.  And, yes my family liked it too.

I was kinda hesitant on this one with the mixture of spices. However, it was amazing! I had to thicken it with cornstarch but I think that’s because I cooked it in the crockpot all day. Don’t skip the sour cream!

I waited almost patiently for the summer heat to dissipate so I could try out this hearty beast. So worth the wait, but I won't be waiting for long to make it again. Stuck to the recipe mostly, but was missing a few ingredients. I only had one large onion and no caraway seeds. I used half smoked Spanish pepper (HOT) and sweet Hungarian paprika in equal amounts (OK, leaning toward the hot). Cooked one day, ate it the next and then had it for leftovers a couple of days later. Just got better and better. Next time, I will use the caraway, but may stick to the paprika mix. In any case, I think we'll get lots of use out of this recipe. I may even try to convert this to a slow cooker, just prolong the great smells. Yum!

I made this recipe with some slight variations (traded out some of the spices for cost, reduced the quantities), and it was absolutely delicious. Slow to cook but really easy and exceptionally tasty.

I made this for  me and my family. I left out the heat for my elderly parents.
 I took chef Johns advice and didn't buy stew meat, good tip. This recipe is so full of flavor, it is now one of my favorite meals to prepare. I did served it over noodles, but I'll try rice next time. Very delicious, glad I tried it!

I put a little less red pepper in it but otherwise

This was really tasty! Prepared almost as written (half the cayenne, I'm a whimp.) Enjoyed the video; it showed my husband what he could do to help (grind the seeds, chop the onions.)

Great recipe - My husband loved it. I had to cook it longer to get the richer looking gravy. Maybe if I browned the meat a bit more the gravy would have taken less time to cook. 
This is a keeper I printed it. It had a very good flavor but next time I will buy the Hungarian paprika and cut down even more on the cayenne pepper.  My husband ate it one night with really good noodles and then the other night with mashed potatoes. It made a very good portion.

I spent 4 years in Germany while in the Army and absolutely loved the Beef Goulash. I have tried quite a few recipes since then looking for one that tastes like the Goulash in Augsburg Germany. This recipe is the closest thing I have found. I have made it twice now and both times it got rave reviews from the family

Ignore the rating, because, well you'll see. I followed instructions, but 1.5 hours is just not long enough in a slow cooker. Meat was still a bit tough. Put it back in for over 6 hours and yes, that is the meal i was after. I probably crushed the black pepper a bit much and added too much chilli powder, which just mean extra sour cream for everyone. Possibly a bit too much chicken stock, next time I would use less to get a thicker sauce/gravy. I don't like adding cornflour to thicken it up. I added sliced portobello mushrooms that gave it another layer of flavour. Choice of meat was good, but next time I'd only brown it for a minute or two, not five. I used smoked paprika, gee that stuff is nice, better than hot or sweet paprika. Yes, I'd make it again, but I'd bear in mind that I'd be using my slow cooker that takes longer...

Made it as directed. Thought it was too peppery. Didn't care that much for the flavor. It was allot of work. Added carrots for the last hour and peas when I served it over a baked potato. It definitely needed the carrots and peas.  Won't make this as is again because it needs changes for my liking.

I nearly always use Chef Johns recipes because they just work! This recipe however was different it just didn't work it was spectacular! I followed everything exactly as directed and it is now my favorite Chef John recipe! I've never tasted such richness in a stew before. Served it over egg noodles with a nice green salad on the side and some baked bread for mopping. Absolutely superb! Thanks Chef John!!!

While the recipe is good and is tasty there are a couple things I did that I thought would make it better.  Over the 2 hours of cooking time the essential oils in the spices mellow out a lot and the dish loses its punch.  I bloomed out an extra 50% of the spice blend and reserved it.  With a last 15 minutes cooking time, added those reserved spices and it restored the spice punch.  Personally I think a little diced dill pickle would go nicely as a garnish, the acidity of the pickle juice would cut through the robustness of the rich sauce

Not bad, but the seasoning is all wrong and it's too thick!  As noted...real goulash is more like a heary soup than a stew.

I've made this a four or five times and find it really tasty but I have usually  skipped the cayenne.  Made it  again last night using 1/8 tsp of cayenne and found it to have plenty of heat.  Cannot imagine going with a full 1/2 tsp.

This goulash is SO much better than most recipes that are bland, boring, and only have a pathetic teaspoonful of paprika! It's wonderfully savory and spicy. Toasting the paprika and caraway seeds probably made a big difference. I would have never thought to do that. This recipe was a little extra work but was seriously worth it!

Delicious. I customized it to my taste by increasing the garlic and halving the cayenne. This gave my lips a tiny bit of burn, and that's all that I want. Also, I didn't have marjoram so I just used oregano. Worked out fine.

I didn't have any marjoram or thyme so I substituted  poultry seasoning.  I also simmered it for an extra hour.  It came out great.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing  your recipe.

Followed the recipe and this turned out fantastic! Didn't feel the need to change anything. I let it cool in the pot overnight, then removed the layer of fat on top and any fat or gristle form the meat. Reheated on low. Such depth of flavors! It's a weekend dish for sure, but so worth the time.

The first time I made this, I used up some leftover roast beef. I think I also use less broth and tossed it in the slow cooker on high for a bit.  Turned out great!

I  kicked up the cayenne and other spices just a bit because I like it hot and spicy! It turned out great. I used some venison flank meat and cooked it in the crockpot on low for about 8 hours. Would definately make again. The sauce came out a beautiful color and flavor, very rich.

I Made one change. I doubled tomato paste for a thicker sauce but would also double the meat next time. We had a lot of sauce left. Kids loved it and would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I was a little lazy and cooked my beef in a dutch oven pan until browned and then just simply added my onion without removing meat from pan.   And I tried really hard to crush the caraway seed with the blunt end of an ice cream scoop in a small bowl.  I don't feel like I did that very well, but the dish was amazing!  I think this was the first time I cooked with caraway seeds.  Make sure to include them.  They brought this dish to life!  Thank you again, Chef John :)

Instead of using the sour cream as a garnish, I added it to the mixture itself to give it some of that hearty consistency that is typically in a goulash

This was very good!  It was a very rich sauce and went really well with the dollop of sour cream and buttered egg noodles.  You only needed a little bit over top of the noodles to have a rich, delectable meal.  A few changes I made and will make next time.  I will make sure to cut my onions into larger chunks and will add in a can of whole tomatoes crushed up in place of some of the tomato paste.  I did also add 1 can chicken broth plus 1 can beef broth, instead of all chicken broth, plus an extra dash of italian seasonings.  Make sure to grind up those caraway seeds, and skim the fat off the top before serving.  I used pork meat instead of stew meat and it was excellent.  Thank you for the comforting recipe.  I will make again for sure!

This was delicious. I didn't know if I would like caraway seeds so I omitted them. Other than that, followed the recipe. The flavor was really amazing. Served over old fashioned buttered noodles. I would definitely make it again.

Wonderful flavor and thick if you want gravy ! Used egg noodles and a spot of sour cream . Not spicy at all as some reviewers say. Go by the directions people before you rate it.

So delicious!!! I made this for my husband and he said it was the best beef stew he's ever eaten. I made his to the recipe except I didn't have the marjoram or the caraway seeds.  He said it was excellent and wants me to make it again. I am a vegetarian so I made the recipe almost the same for me but I used tofurkey Italian sausages and did not brown my onions in the juices of the beef. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. All in all,  an amazing meat eater or vegetarian dish...with a few substitutions ;) I paired it with cous cous.

I wanted to find a good goulash recipe, since we just returned from Prague where we ate it a number of times.  I even brought back some paprika to use.  When I saw Chef John had a recipe, I was pretty sure my search was over.  And I was correct; this was just awesome and I will make it many times!  I did add a few potatoes in the last hour of cooking.  Yum, yum!!

It was good. Will go into my rotation as an alternative to regular beef stew. I was expecting much stronger flavors, and mine turned out really mild.

This was some spicy, but not over the top.
Had about 1/2 lb meat, therefore I cut the whole recipe to quarter.  Used 1/2 Hungarian and 1/2 smoked paprika...didn't have enough (I think it was) Hungarian.  The beef I used was left over steak I'd made before.
We liked this...was nice change.  Wanted to serve over egg noodles.  Didn't have any, so served with linguine.

Loved it! Splurged on Hungarian paprika and it was well worth the price. I like my goulash a bit thicker than it was cooking up, so I added the whole 6oz. can of paste and simmered it for a bit over two hours, no lid. I never would have thought of adding balsamic vinegar or caraway seeds, but Chef John has a habit of using not-so-common ingredients (Chinese Five Spice powder in his pumpkin pie, for example - best I've ever made!). I served the goulash once with buttered noodles, but now I'm eating it with paprika flavored (regular, cheap paprika) Jasmine rice. Cook up one potful and reheat with the goulash! I like this better than the vintage, venerable recipe I've made so many times from my old "New York Times Cookbook" from 1965. This has pizazz! My new go-to recipe! (Don't forget the sour cream!!)

Made this last night. It was so delicious! The only thing I did different  was leave out the marjoram and the caraway seed. I didn't have either but it didn't make a difference.  DH even raved about it. He took leftovers for lunch today. I'm anxious to hear how it was the second time around. This will be made again!

I used all the ingredients and followed the recipe with the exception for the cooking method. I used my instant pot. I sautéed the stew meat and onions and after it was sautéed I switched it to the manual setting (high pressure) for 20 minutes. It came out fork tender and I didn't have to worry about it cooking two hours.

This was my second Chef John recipe in two days, and WOW! My family went gaga all over again! I did forget the sour cream (silly me, I did have it in the house), but it was still wonderful! Thank you again, Chef John!

This turned out fantastic!!  I did make one substitution and one addition though. I substituted beef broth for half of the chicken broth required, and cut the crushed red pepper in half. I also sautéed sliced fresh mushrooms in the drippings then added them to the stock pot!  The family loved it!  Great Autumn comfort dish!

Holy smokes - this is by the best recipe I've come across!! So many great flavors! 

- I didn't have a brick and mortar for the caraway seeds, so I put them in a Ziploc bag  and used a dough roller to flatten and crush the seeds. The aroma is phenomenal once released. 

- Make sure to leave the lid off during the simmering process so that the sauce thickens. 

-  I served the beef goulash on top of egg noodles seasoned with porcini mushrooms. Yum.

- The sour cream does a beautiful job of balancing out the spice from the cayenne pepper. 

Thank you Chef John for another fabulous recipe!

I made this recipe as listed with one very small change.  I cooked in slow cooker over night on low.  I did put in a pot when it came time for cooking dinner and simmered another 30 minutes to reduce the liquid a little.  This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  VERY flavorful and yummy.  My husband was sad that there was so little left over.

Goulash is traditionally more of a soup than a stew.  A little more broth should be added to give the egg noodles more cover.  This is really a very good recipe.  I like to finish it off in the oven @ 300 degrees for 2:45 to 3: hours.  It really tenderizes the beef cubes.

Most awesome version of noddles and gravy I have found to date and I've been searching for 30 years.
It's beefy but without going over board so you can eat it everyday without getting bored. I don't think I'd change anything.

Chef John I've tried a few of your recipes and i am now a hero at home. The latest is the beef goulash. Again my family raved about this recipe. I made a slight modification to the recipe ... I omitted the caraway seed. As a kid the seed left a bitter taste in my mouth. Regardless it was fantastic. Tonight we are having the leftover goulash for dinner. After a couple of day's rest i hope the flavors will permeate the meat for another delicious meal.

I love pot roast but this was really good flavor, a little kick to it. I like cutting up meat first, maybe helped tenderness.  I will definitely make again!  Served to company, we all said "I never eat this much", I think that is a sign of how good it was. I served 4 and probably have 3 servings leftover.

Made it. Loved it!! Winner, winner goulash dinner. Everyone loved it (even the picky ones). Just the perfect amount of spice. Had to serve over rice because I had no noodles, but since I will definitely be making again, we'll do the noodles next time. My 16yr old daughter told me "I think I have a new birthday dinner request"Cant wait to try more of Chef John's recipes. Thank you Chef.

This is the recipe I've been looking for for 35 years! Fabulous!!!. I will be making it again and again. The only thing I might change is to leave some of the cayenne pepper out, not for me but for the grandchildren. I served it with noodles and sour cream on the side. Delicious!!!

I'm giving this recipe five stars even though I didn't love it. I'm giving it five stars because my husband and two teenage sons loved it even though my boys hate anything stew-like. I followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do. It took some time to make but was easy to follow the directions and it really did look just like Chef Johns. Smelled great cooking too. I'm not a big meat eater. Actually, I rarely eat meat but I wanted to try this. It was good but I would have liked it to have some vegetables in it. But that's just my preference and I don't think my rating should be based on that. This is why it gets the full five stars.

Chef John has never failed me.  At the last minute it seemed my house was place for the family reunion, 15 family members converged at my house.  I sent my husband to the butcher for a pot roast, but he came back with two large chuck roast (he said they were on sale).  Well I doubled up on Chef John's Beef Goulash, and it was great.  It did not take me a long time to prep, nor did it take a long time to cook.  I did use my electric pressure cooker, but still came out tender, flavorful, and the gravy was thick and rich.  Thank you.

Very good, great flavor. It was a little spicier than my family likes so I will most likely cut back or reduce altogether the cayenne pepper.

I didn't have Hungarian paprika so I used regular paprika. It was very tasty. When I make it again, I will use Hungarian paprika which I'm sure will make it even better. Great recipe!

I used a 3 1/2 pound chuck roast in the hopes of having some leftovers, but the family quickly consumed all that I made!  It smelled great while it simmered and was perfect over egg noodles.  We will definitely be making this one again.  We went with the 3 cups (vice 4) of chicken broth to have the thicker sauce.

Flavorful. Tender. Gobbled up by two adults and an 11, 9 & 6 year-old. Served with noodles… But also eaten plain.    increased the recipe size by .5, but made as directed. Family requested a do over!

This was a fantastic recipe!  My first time making a stew of this kind, and i learned a lot that i can apply toward future dishes.

Caveat though - this was very spicy-hot for my tastes, and i like hot foods generally.  Next time around, i may only use half the Hungarian hot paprika, and half Spanish paprika.

I made it tonight and let me tell you, the flavors are out of this world! The only change I will make next time is a little less caraway seed and a little lighter on the cayenne pepper. But that's a personal preference, nothing wrong with the recipe at all.

This is an awesome recipe! The only change I made was to cut some of the cayenne pepper. Otherwise, followed it exactly as the written recipe and followed the video to make sure I didn't miss a step. A definite hit in our house. This will be in my comfort food rotation.

This was a delicious meal.  I used new garden fresh potatoes instead of noodles because they were given to me. I also halved the recipe because there is only my husband and myself.  I will certainly make it again! I was able to buy crushed caraway seeds.

Prepared as per recipe (plus 4 "chunked" carrots with an hour to go). Absolutely loved it, as did my wife!  I can't wait for the leftovers for tonight's supper.
Made this a second time with "Hungarian" paprika instead of ordinary ... it was even better!

This was the first Chef John recipe I ever made and it was so darn good I've become addicted to Chef John recipes. Everyone that ate it loved it at my house. And  - yes - the smell was intoxicating all right! I've made it many times since and do caution using the right Hungarian Paprika. I accidentally overdid it with  a spicier one and it was pretty much inedible. Also I totally agree with the reviewer that said it was difficult to grind up the caraway seeds. I think I need to find a spice grinder so I don't have to chop tiny little caraways anymore. Also I am accustomed to cutting away fat off the meat before cooking to help with calorie reduction but in this case - be bad. That fat makes the sublime flavors happen!

Substituted beef broth for the chicken broth and added two extra tablespoons of Hungarian paprika. Couple of thoughts here....make sure to use only Hungarian paprika and make sure it is fresh paprika(fiery red not dull brownish red in color)! Serve with a tangy cucumber salad(uborka salata)! Eliminated the balsamic vinegar as this is not an essential ingredient to this dishes success.

I've made this a few times now.  I left out the cayenne due to family preferences.  Also, I just use a single skillet.  I brown the meat, take it out, then caramelize the onions, add the spices, then put the meat back in along with the rest of the ingredients.  I've found it is key to get the right amount of reduction in the sauce.  I did it in a dutch oven one time and the sauce didn't reduce enough before it was time for dinner, so it came out a little soupy and the flavor was less intense.  After dinner, I simmered the leftovers for about half an hour to reduce the sauce some more, and the result was more like the usual-- fantastic!

I made this for the whole extended family on a cold winter day after my Grandpa passed away. I didn't have my Hungarian grandmother's recipe on hand. I don't remember if we put in the balsamic vinegar, but we kept the cayenne (even though she wasn't familiar with that). It gives it an extra kick. Do not skip the braising - it adds so much flavor. Everyone was very pleased - even Grandma.

Very nice. I didnt add salt to the meat because I decided to use beef stock and was affraid itvwould get too salty:wrong. I would add salt to meat next time. It was better without the cream. It was done in 1.15/1.30 min.

Upon my return from a trip to Austria, I found this to be a great recipe and much like what the delicious goulash tasted there.  I plan to make it again for a Fall dinner party for 24.  I didn't change a thing except I didn't have caraway seed so I substituted a little dried oregano.  If it is better with caraway, so be it, but this was wonderful!

I made this for my mom's birthday.  She is Hungarian, and I was trying to make a themed dinner for her.  I made it without the Cayenne pepper because my parents cannot eat spicy foods.  It tasted very good, but there was way too much liquid.  She also did not recognize this as Goulash.  I will make it again, though, because everybody enjoyed eating it.  Next time, I will cut the liquid in half.

The first time I made this I did not have 2 of the signatory ingredients, caraway seeds and  balsamic vinegar. It came out pretty good but tasted nothing like the batch I made last night with all of the ingredients.  Last nights batch tasted very good with a complex flavor of caraway, balsamic vinegar and beef. FYI; I suspect the spice this recipe has is not from the cayenne pepper ( I cut that to 1/4 tsp) but the 2 tablespoons of paprika. I used smoked Italian paprika which may have been spicier than a sweet Hungarian paprika.

Very delicious recipe.  Followed recipe pretty much as written and made sure to use real Hungarian paprika. I did serve it the day after I cooked it to give the flavors a chance to mature.  Hubby raved about how good it was.  Not too spicy for us. A little more trouble than some recipes but well worth it. Thank you, Chef John.

WOW this was fabulous and so easy.  I actually let it simmer on low in my crock pot for about 5 hours...and I added sliced crimini mushrooms, which added a nice flavor.  I didn't have caraway, so I googled a suggested replacement and found cumin was good, so I used that and it really was just great.  I changed the recipe to 6 servings for two of us, and we have enough to freeze for a later time.  Awesome recipe

This was a real winner! Sauce was a delicious blend of flavors (even better the next day). I will definitely make again, but next time will slice onions thin and add garlic at the end their cooking time. I used mostly regular Hungarian paprika, and about 1/2 Tbls. of Hot Hungarian paprika (plus a tweak of cayenne). Served it with some homemade spaetzle just for fun! However, meat was tough even after 2+ hours of cooking time. Next time, I will partially cover during cooking and add more liquid if necessary.

Delicious!!!! A definite to be put in the menu rotation! Enjoyed by my husband too who had a plate & then went back for seconds which he hardly ever does! I left out the caraway & cayenne due to our taste preference! A little preparation but so worth it!! Thanks Chef John!!

Turned out Great! We don't like caraway seeds but this recipe was delicious without it. Next time I think I'll try putting a can of diced tomatoes in instead of the tomato paste just to have a few more veggies in there (and partially for texture). Definitely making it again.

This dish was worth the wait! I thoroughly enjoyed this goulash over freshly-cooked egg noodles. It has just enough of a kick to let you your pallet know you have something special in your mouth. The only change I made was to substitute a little of the Hungarian paprika with hot paprika. Excellent recipe!

This dish earned at least 4 "amazing"s from my husband at dinner tonight :-) My 4yo kept telling me i did a good job too lol I reduced the heat by half and it still had kick. I did not have tomato paste so I substituted an equal amount of chopped sun dried tomatoes. At a simmer this reduced a ton so I had to add another cup of chicken broth the last half hour of cooking. I  put it over spaghetti and topped with sour cream, parsley,Monterey Jack cheese and corn bread crumbs. Yet ANOTHER Chef John hit :-) Keep em coming and thanks!

This was amazing! It was so fun to cook with spices I don't normally use. The taste was unique. I actually used Gardein brand beefless tips (I'm a vegetarian). I simply can't imagine how delicious this would have been with real beef. Again, awesome recipe.

I knew when I started browning the spices that this dish was going to be wonderful.  I made it per the recipe except that I didn't have carraway seeds so I used cumin (googled substitute).  What a great easy dish to fix.  Glad I had a small portion left over so I can eat it again.  Put it on top of egg noodles.

This is really, really good.  But it is not goulash--it's paprikash.  

I think it is better to add the egg noodles a bit al dente to the soup and then serve. Much easier to eat that way.

I thought this was great. New flavors I have never cooked with (caraway). The meat was tender and I found that a small portion was filling due to the richness of the flavors. I held back a bit on the cayenne so that everyone in my house would like it. i'd say this is a monthly repeat on my menu!

I cooked this for 45 minutes in my electric pressure cooker and it came out delicious!  The flavors, especially the caraway seeds, make this dish extremely flavorful.  I am saving this for many more meals.

Wonderful flavor.  I did not have caraway seed nor the cayenne pepper, but used all other spices exactly as written.   I did follow another's suggestion in reducing the amount of chicken stock.  Served over jasmine rice with a dollop of sour cream with chives. Very satisfying.

Wow! fantastic! I made it exactly as is, except that I didn't have quite as much beef as he called for. Also, I cut back on the cayenne. But it was soooo good! the flavors blended beautifully and if you cook it as long as he calls for, you end up with a thick and creamy sauce without any cream, flour or cornstarch. Wonderful! Everyone loved it! I'm making it again, soon! This is definitely the best recipe I've cooked off this website.

This was really easy to make, and it smelled heavenly while it was cooking!  It had a bit of a kick to it, so next time I'll decrease the cayenne pepper.  Overall, this was a delicious and easy dish to prepare!

Loved it!!! Since I only eat organic food I used organic ingredients. The pasta, grass fed beef, and bread I used to soak up the remaining sauce on my plate. OH MY GOSH!!!!! I thought this was EXCELLENT!!! Thank you Chef John.

This was absolutely delicious! Thanks for the recipe, will make this again. I didn't change a thing. It's hard when you're looking to change things up for your nightly dinner and I stumbled on this, couldn't be more pleased. One of the coolest things us that I had everything in the spice cabinet, pantry and fridge and only had to scoot into the grocery store for the beef. Awesome!

Outstanding! Might be the best thing I ever cooked! I will use less or no  caraway seed next time as I feel it overpowered the aroma (didn't really impact the flavor).  Other than that...might use two large onions. Flavors were terrific.

I made this exactly as described in the recipe., although I was unable to get my hands on Hungarian  paprika and used regular paprika. I served it over buttered noodles. Everyone in the family loved it! Five stars! I will make this again and again. It is pretty to look at, with the rich red sauce and the dollop of sour cream the middle, and good enough for company fair. Thank you Chef John!

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe except I left out the cayenne pepper for my hubby. It still had alot of flavor. He said it was a keeper. This will definately be going into my rotation.

I have this same recipe except with fewer ingredients and dry red wine instead of tomato paste and chicken broth and it is called beef burgundy. Absolutely fantastic
