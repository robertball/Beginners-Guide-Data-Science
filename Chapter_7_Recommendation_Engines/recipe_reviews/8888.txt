This was VERY tasty.  I used low-fat margarine; omitted mushrooms; added chopped basil and used provolone.  This is just as good as any chicken dish from an Italian restaurant.  If my too-picky husband liked it.

Been looking for a recipe like this. Was intoduced to Fontina cheese in a hi-end Italian restaurant.  This is an almost exact replica. Only thing I added was a dash of lemon juice.  Fabulous. Had Ceasar salad and garlic mashed potatos with it,

I LOVE fontina cheese and this recipe uses it perfectly.  This was fantastic, but next time I would probably only use 1/2 tsp. of the white pepper, it was a little too strong.  Thanks for a "keeper" that I will definately be making again and again!

Rich and delicious with an impressive presentation.  But then it's hard to go wrong when you're working with perfect, luscious ingredients and proper method of cooking (although I cooked my chicken in half butter, half olive oil, at medium-high heat, not low!)  Using the best ingredients is key to getting the best results - no skimping!  Use a good wine, the same you'd drink.  Prosciutto di Parma if your budget allows and the very best fontina cheese. Also, being careful not to overcook the chicken results in its being fork tender.  Lovely dish - I served it with a rainbow angel hair pasta, and haricots verts.

Fantastic. I pounded my chicken flat and cooked about 4 minutes on each side. To the flour coating, I added a little garlic, paprika and black pepper. I only used a tablespoon of butter and a little bit of olive oil for the sauce, and at the end mixed in a bit of cornstarch to thicken. 

I served this with balsamic tomatoes with feta, fresh sauteed asparagus and a caesar salad. I will absolutely make this recipe again. Thank you so much!

we really liked this a lot, and will definately make it again.  I did make a few tiny changes.  I added a little olive oil to the butter when cooking the chicken to keep the butter from burning.  After browning the chicken, I put it in a pan in the oven at 350 for awhile because I didnt feel 2 mins a side was enough and I was prepping the sauce, etc.  I had pancetta and no prosciutto, so I cooked that up and crumbled it on top of the cheese, and cooked the mushrooms a little while longer until almost all the liquid was gone.  (the mushrooms were awesome!) This is a salty dish, I had to catch my husband before he just did his usual shake of salt without tasting.  My kids loved it, without the mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to prepare and great flavor.  I didn't have the fontina so I used mozzarella.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

This was amazing.  Not only does this taste delicious, but looks like a meal fit for company.  Didn't have fontina cheese, so used fresh mozzarella instead.  Can not wait to try this one again...probably next time the in-laws come for dinner.  Thanks for the post.

My husband and children really enjoyed this dish.  It was SO tasty and reminded me of something we would have been served in a restaurant.  The sauce is very flavorful and it really strengthens the flavor the longer you reduce it.  Did use fontina cheese, but not the prosciutto, just used sliced smoked ham.  I did have to add some cooking time to the chicken, I added the chicken back in while reducing the sauce.  Very tender.

excellent!  I used pounded chicken breasts. After briefly browning them I placed them in a 350 oven with the prociutto and cheese for about 10-15 min while I made the sauce. (I also thickened the sauce with a bit of corn starch mixed with water.) I topped the chicken with the sauce after baking and served with an asparagus and mushroom risotto.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing.

Very nice dish. I also used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil, because to get the chicken nicely browned, you've got to get that heat up high. I did cook it about 4 minutes per side.  It bothered me not to salt & pepper the chicken, but I'm glad I held off, because the Prosciutto and cheese provided plenty of saltiness. I served this with rice and broccoli, and my family loved it!

Married this and the Blissful Rosemary chicken recipe (i adore rosemary, which i added chopped to the mushroom mixture). Also while i was sauteing the mushrooms, i thinly sliced about 3 garlic cloves into that as well; it ampted up the flavor of the sauce quite a bit. Wonderful recipe, i cut down on the butter... too much for my taste for everyday dinners. Will definitely make again

I made this expecting it to taste like the Polo Rosa Maria from Carabas. Although the dish was flavorful, it wasn't what I expected. I served with some fettucini alfredo for a complete meal. Thanks for sharing.

What a lovely dish Jen; thank you. I made eight cutlets, quadrupled the yummy sauce and added more seasonings. So that the chicken could tenderize and soak up the flavor from the sauce, once browned, I placed the chicken into a roasting pan, covered it with the sauteed mushrooms and sauce and placed it into the oven for about a half hour. I then topped the chicken with the ham and cheese and ran it under the broiler to melt. All six of us loved this dish Jen. Thank you again!

This was just ok. Easy to make and tasty enough but not incredibly special. Probably won't make again but it was nice to try once.

I really enjoyed this recipe and thought it was pleasant tasting and light.  Everything came together well, and we enjoyed the taste of the mushrooms so much that I would consider making them that way for steaks.  The only reason this isn't five stars is that I was not in love with fontina (I had never used it before), frankly I think I'll just use fresh mozzerella as it is less expensive and has a similar texture.  Also one other change was coating the chicken in egg before flouring it.

I've never seen my husband rave over a dish more than he did this one.  I followed it exactly by the recipe with exception of me not seeing that I was supposed to pound the chicken thin.  By the time I realized it, they were already in the pan cooking, so I had to increase the initial cooking time to about 20 min, but the chicken still came out perfectly.  The sauce was good, and made the kitchen smell wonderful!  We paired it with steamed broccoli and rice. Note: for the people that complain that it is too salty, I learned that you HAVE to spend the extra money to get the good prosciutto.  The cheap stuff is a lot saltier.

If you are looking for an elegant dish, this one is absolutely amazing.  The chicken is so tender you can cut it with a fork.  The prosciuto and fontina cheese not only gives it a high class richness, but it's rich in every sense of the word.  My only change was to omit the wine and use straight chicken broth throughout the entire recipe.

Delicious!  I added more flavoring to the breading and used pepperoni slices instead of prosciutto (couldn't readily find any).  It is a surprisingly flavorful dish and very versatile -- use it by itself, over pasta, with veggies, etc.

Excellent......sauteed the cutlets in a little olive oil, placed in a baking dish and layered each one with procuitto and fontina cheese.....baked covered for about 15-20 min until cheese melted and chicken was cooked through.  The sauce was great....I did thicken it with flour and water and added an extra tblspn of butter at the end.....very tasty spooned over the cheesey chicken....will make again!

This recipe was good, but very time consuming. If I make it again, next time Ill use the thinner cut chicken cutlets instead of pounding out thick breasts.

Very good. I bought thin chicken breasts, rolled the proscioutto and cheese in them and secured with toothpicks. Nice for entertaining.

Personally, I really liked this.  My family thought the prosciutto tasted like that dried beef in a jar!  Apparently they are not used to the taste of that specialty.

This was a very tasty dish!  The combination of the prisciutto ham and fontina cheese sets this apart from the average chicken dinner.  I've never tried fontina cheese before this and my husband and I both LOVE it!  The only adjustment I had to make was to cook the chicken longer than the recommended 2 minutes on each side.  I'll definately be making this again!

I made this dish for company and we all loved it.  It wasn't exactly easy to prepare, but the end results were very tasty!  Will definitely make again for a dinner party, but it is too much work to eat often.

This was really good.  (I didn't have nonsalted butter, so I used the salted kind and it was a little satly, but I like stuff salty.)  I wasn't however overly impressed with the "white wine mushroom sauce".  It didn't take away from the dish, but didn't add that much to it either, and it took a while to make.  I think next time I will just sautee the mushrooms in the butter and leave it at that.  Nice recipe tho, and thanks for introducing me to fontina cheese.  Never had it before and really like it!

Delicious and easy, using fresh ingredients.  Saltiness of cheese and prosciutto was balanced by chicken.  A nice combination.  Will make this again!

Very good. A little salty with the fontina and proscuitto, but if you don't mind things a little on the salty side, you'll love this!

Absolutely fabulous! I used it as a base and added other fresh herbs that we love. Without those, we wouldn't have liked it as much. This would be my only issue with the recipe and that has more to do with our personal taste than the recipe itself. I'll surely make it again. :o)

Everyone liked this recipe. I modified it a bit. I cooked the chicken then after removing it, I put the prosciutto in the pan to crisp it up a bit. I removed it and added mushrooms to the pan and they absorbed some nice prosciutto flavor. I then cooked it the rest of the way according to the directions. It came out really tasty!

All thumbs up from my family of 5. Finally tried it after looking at it several times. Changes- afraid of dry wine and white pepper for kids. I used Pinot Grigio and very fine-almost powder grind black pepper. My chicken stock was made with roasted garlic.

Good. The sauce is very rich, but good. I made it with both fontina cheese and mozarella. The fontina cheese really adds a nice sweet and nutty taste. I highly recommend this.

My fiance and I loved this meal! I added some pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before dusting with flour. I also made extra sauce - it's so good! I browned the chicken for about three or four minutes on each side and then topped it with the prosciutto and cheese (I used shaved Parmesan - my fiance doesn't like soft cheeses - and it was fabulous) and put it in the oven for the rest of the time I was making the sauce. Turned out perfect! I will definitely be making this when we have company!

I looooved this recipe, as did my boyfriend, who claimed it was "possibly the best meal he'd had in his life!". Thank you, Jen, for your wonderful recipe! I added a few more mushrooms (gotta love 'em) and substituted dried parsley for fresh. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe and it was FABULOUS. :)

Wow! I have a hard time buying chicken because it is so bland but this recipe rocks! Its definititey got some bite and pungency to it so its not for the faint-hearted (or those who like bland things :)) Next time I would definitely double the amount of ingredients for the mushrooom sauce. I could have used more of that stuff. I omitted the parsley and it turned out fine. Use a good dry wine (only one you would risk serving to guests), trust me, this makes a difference. I used homemade chicken stock (try it some time, way better)  and gluten-free flour (worked perfectly). For those of you who are sensitive to gluten,  use it in this recipe and you won't be left out!  This is a good recipe to impress friends, parents, special people etc.

I thought that this was FANTASTIC!!  I did make a few changes, however.  When done frying the chicken I put it in a warm oven to keep it toasty.  Then, I sauteed broccoli, baby bellas, and 1 clove of garlic in the remaining butter/oil.  After two minutes, I added about 3/4 c chicken stock and let that cook off, until the broccoli was tender-crisp.  I  put the prosciutto and cheese atop the chicken in the oven until the cheese was melted and then I served it and the veggie saute over penne pasta with some extra fontina and parmesan sprinkled in.  Very good!

Delicious.  I didn't flatten the chicken as much and put the browned chicken with the fontina and prosciutto on top and covered it with foil and put it in the oven, covered, at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I made the mushrooms as directed and also put the sauce and shrooms in with the chicken.  Used my cast iron skillet and had only one pan. It was delicious and moist.

I first made this dish for hubby & I and used prepackaged proscuitto.  Then my daughter who is a chef-de-cuisine at a farm to table restaurant and her sous chef boyfriend came for dinner. The one thing chefs love is a true home cooked meal. I treated us to a true proscuitto de parma (at $15.00 a lb, I needed less than a 1/4 lb). Couldn't get Fontina so I used Gouda. mixed baby bellas & white mushrooms. And made this after getting home from work at 6:30.  Let me tell you - this is great!  Fast & easy. This is a keeper. They loved it & since I made a couple of extra servings, they took it home.  Chefs are often too tired to cook for themselves!

This was really good.  The only changes I made were to use boneless skinless chicken thighs and goat cheese instead of fontina.  I had the goat cheese on hand so I decided to use that instead.  I served this along with some fresh green beans for dinner.

Delicious! Unfortunately we didn't pound the chicken to be extra flat, which I think would have added to the meal. Otherwise, the recipe was great and it was appreciated as a wonderfl home cooked Valentine's Day meal :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It has a great flavor and makes an excellent dish to serve to company.  I didn't make any changes except to use 5 thin sliced chicken breasts, one small package of fresh mushrooms and 1 Tablespoon of dried parsley because that is what I had on hand.  Next time I would like to thicken the sauce more so I will add some corn starch.  Great recipe.

I just made the sauce that came with this and I thought it was pretty weak.  Not a ton of flavour and the color of it was unappealing.  Probably wouldn't make this again.

LOVED this recipe & made just as specified.  Alot of reviewers said they did not care for the fontina/proscuitto & it is for sure an acquired taste; my suggestion would be to taste both before going forward with the dish.  If you are a fan of the 2 though, this is the perfect recipe.  Might just be my favorite I have used from the site!

I throughly enjoyed this, unfortunately my husband was not as impressed with this dish. He wasn't a fan of the fontina (I loved it, but I can also see how it would be a bit overpowering), so next time I may substitute provolone or mozzarella. I'll also double the sauce next time, cause I wanted more to serve over my mashed potatoes. This was a beautiful dish though, and it went great with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

Me and my guests really loved this.  If your chicken breasts are thick, I would suggest pounding them a bit so that the flavors are evenly proportioned.  I sub'd chicken stock for the white wine and the sauce was delicious.

This was Sunday Dinner last night. WOW it was great.  I wasn't familiar with the Fontina cheese, it was delicious. The chicken was tender and tasty.  I added a little sea salt and garlic to the flour mixture. Great recipe.

This was a good tasting dish. If the prosciutto is very expensive where you shop, I think a cheaper ham would work well too. This did take me longer to prepare than some because my fry pan would only hold 2-3 pieces of chicken at a time (the chicken breasts were quite large after pounding them thin). Thank you for the recipe, Jen!

Quick, easy, not *too* expensive, but absolutely outstanding. The flavors complimented each other perfectly. Apart from using a couple of grinds of black pepper, I followed the recipe exactly. I can't think of any ways to improve it apart from perhaps popping it under the broiler for a couple of mins to brown the cheese a little. I wouldn't hesitate to make this again. Thank you so much, Jen!

I have been in this chicken/proscuitto phase for two days now because I had a huge package of proscuitto from Sams Club to use up. I love this combination and liked the addition of mushrooms. After reading the reviews, I used low-sodium chicken broth. That helped a little bit but still a tad salty. I also put the lid on the skillet to help with the cheese melting. Topped with a little  bit of ground sage to add color.

I have a big family so I doubled everything.  I also added a little olive oil with the butter.  I replaced the  prosciutto with ham, Fontina with Muenster  and white pepper with black pepper - just because that’s what I had on hand.  I let the wine and then the wine and chicken stock reduce for quite some time.   When I put the chicken back in the pan to melt the cheese, I put a lid on the pan. It was really good.   Everyone liked it.

Good, but not something you'd make on a regular basis. We decided we'd make a couple of changes that would make it quicker to make &/or not necessary for us. Since pounding the chicken breasts is hard on my wrists, we'll just cut chicken lengthwise so they're thinner. We also will omit the chicken stock as we'd rather have the white wine flavor more. Reducing the liquid only a little as then if needed we can add some cornstarch at the end to make a sauce that is a little thicker. We thought it was salty because of the chicken stock, prosciutto & cheese.  By eliminating the  chicken stock it'll help some. Think we'll try over a pasta next time.

Both my husband and I thought the addition of the prosciutto made the dish a little too salty.  However, the dish overall was a success.  We don't use wine in our cooking, so I used chicken stock.  I will make it again, maybe less prosciutto or even leave it out.  Very tasty!

This was a delicious meal. I did not have Fontina cheese available so I used Gouda cheese as a substitute. I also had to cook the chicken a little longer to make sure it was cooked all the way through but I did not change anything else and It was amazing.

OMG this was fantastic. I added fresh spinach to the mushroom sauce.   I served it on pasta w/a light butter sauce. It is very versatile.  I will make this many times more.  Especially for company dinners.

This is so delicious I would give it 10 stars if I could! The whole family absolutely loved it. The first time I browned the chicken then baked it in the oven on a wire rack to keep it crispy. I did not put the sauce over it until I plated it which was perfect. When made as written it's still 5 stars but the breading got a little mushy. I will only bake it from now on. Very tasty! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Let me just start by saying- I cannot cook! I always print out recipes from this website, but finally gave one try! I made this for my very picky boyfriend last night and he loved it! He said if he got it in a restaurant he would not be disapointed!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I breaded and baked my chicken and used mozzerella cheese. So delicious! Thank you!

I have made this recipe many times. It's one of my favorite chicken recipes. I have layered roasted red peppers in there as well and served it over egg noodles.

This was so delicious! We had leftovers two days later and it was still delicious! although i noticed that all the sauce cooked either into the chicken, or i over cooked it, but there wasn't any to pour over at the end, all i had left was saute'd mushroom, but it was still delicious. But im sure the sauce would've been good so i recommend doubling the sauce called for, or make the same amount for less chicken breast. This was fantastic though! Will definitely make it again!

I was not terribly impressed with this meal. I was looking for restaurant quality and i thought the execution of the meal could have been better. I've gotten great recipes from this site but this wasn't one of them. The proscuitto & fontina left a taste that wouldn't leave our mouth, no matter what we did.

OK -- but the flavors don't really blend, however if you have this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, they go very well together.

The chicken was very tasty, but we didn't care for the sauce.  We just ate the chicken.

I made this the other night and I was not impressed.  The chicken turned out well, but the sauce did not turn out at all.  I'm not sure if I messed something up, but it was so watery and I did not think it had a very good flavor.  I may make the chicken again, but I will not waste my time on the sauce.

This was a very tasty dish...however for those of you who haven't ever had fontina cheese I would strongly advise using a different cheese as my guests and I did not care for it.  But other than the fontina cheese it was wonderful!

Used 4 chicken breasts, shredded swiss cheese and dried parsley.  Yes, the chicken takes longer than 2 minutes (on low?!) to brown.  I cooked the chicken all the way through, about 5 minutes per side, then continued with the rest of the recipe.

Very good except you really need to saute the chicken longer than the 2 minutes per side that the recipe indicates. Other than that, this recipe is a definite keeper! I'm going to try making with fresh mozzarella instead of the fontina just for a change.

Yummy.  Next time I would like to double the mushroom sauce.
