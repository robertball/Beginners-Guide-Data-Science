I agree the topping could use some work.  It has too much flour, maybe cut it back to 1 cup?  The peach layer tasted great.

Peaches & sugar mixture was a bit dry, even with 6 cups of peaches. The topping had entirely too much flour and not enough butter to form the perfect crumb mixture.

I agree that the topping could use a little salt if using unsalted butter. My problem was that the topping was too floury. Maybe I processed the oats and walnuts too much. But when baked the topping came out very dry and didn't get crispy.

Just a note about the salt.  You can certainly add some salt to the crisp topping.  My family seems to prefer no salt added.  I would say about 1/8 teaspoon.

The topping a little dry, either need some more butter or a little less flour.  But it tasted good.  I used no salt added butter

This recipe has great potential but it certainly is the No Sodium version. Using unsalted butter and not adding any salt to the topping left the topping tasting rather flat. This also was very runny - I used 2 T Tapioca but it needed more, probably double the amount.

WAY too much flour! This was awful and I should have known better. Maybe 3/4 c flour.
