Great salad! Although the recipe suggests adding the spinach and bacon right before serving, I mix everything in advance as a make-ahead dinner and it comes out great. I think I would like it this way better because spinach blends in better with the rest of the salad. I also use home-made dressing, with olive oil, vinegar, salt, sugar, and pepper.

I really love this salad.  It's even better when you make it the day before you eat it so all the flavors have time to meld.

This is one of my classic summer recipes.  I've been making it for years and it is requested at family parties every year.  I use brown rice.

I made this for Recipe Group last night.  I wasn’t sure this was going to go over well with Hubs, but he amazed me when he told me to save the leftovers.  Another surprise came when he just now polished them off, commenting that he really liked it.  When making it I didn’t use all the dressing called for and I added some diced red bell pepper for some added color.  I liked this for something a little different.

Quick and easy.  Brought this to a 4th of July potluck.  Didn't have any green onions so I increased the celery.  Salad got raves reviews.

Good flavored salad. As a vegetarian, I substituted Bac-O's for the bacon.

Made this salad for Recipe Group. Nice blend of subtle flavors and a very pretty salad. I substituted pasta for the rice. Added 3 Tbs of small dice roasted red peppers which were a perfect addition to this salad. Five Stars!

Made for Recipe Group. Used Zesty Italian for this and it flavored the rice mixture nicely and was plenty to dress the mixed greens when added in. It just didn't wow me. Just tasted like a salad with Italian dressing on it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as a side to easter dinner. It went over very well. I cut the rice in half b/c I thought 2 cups would be too much. Plus i googled the recipe and the others with the same ingredients only called for 1 cup. I'm glad I did 1 cup was plenty. I also used fat free italian dressing to make it just a bit healthier! I will be making this again. Thanks!

I made this as the Recipe Buzz Group Recipe for this week. We really liked it. I didn't expect to because I don't even like the brand of Italian dressing I used (Newman's Own Light) but somehow it was delicious anyway. I used half the rice because I apparently can't do math and wound up making just 1 cup of brown rice. I decided to call it good enough, and so it was. We served this as a topping to fresh spinach rather than mixing spinach in because neither of us like limp spinach. Thanks for sharing!

I was worried that the dressing would overwhelm the rest of the salad but it didn't. I served it with ginger-glazed salmon. It was easy, different and my husband liked it so I'll be making it again soon.

Recipe Group Selection:  28, January 2012   I halved the recipe since I was making it for 2.   This salad was pretty good as written, but missing something.  I then added some diced sun-dried tomatoes and slivers of yellow pepper - this helped.  It made for a nice light lunch.

I was looking up something to use up some odds and ends and ran across this recipe.  This turned out wonderfully and was a huge hit!  I really really enjoyed this inventive was to use rice as a salad!

We absolutely loved this recipe. I only made one change by omitting the green onions. This was so easy and a great way to get my family to eat spinach!

I had never made rice salad before, so I was a little wary, but it turned out wonderfully! I'm allergic to celery, so I substituted julienned carrots and Japanese cucumbers. I also left out the bacon and green onions (due to lack of supplies) but it paired well with the wasabi encrusted ahi we had!
