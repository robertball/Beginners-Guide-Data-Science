This is very easy and good.  My boyfriend won't eat TVP, so I used veggie burgers instead and cooked them in the gravy.

So I think when it calls for a 12 oz. package of TVP, she means the kind that is frozen and already reconstituted. They come in 12 oz packages. This sounds really yummy, and I am a huge fan of TVP, so I will be giving this a try! Thank you!

Tasted good, but I suggest 1 cup of TVP per recipe. I don't know how 12oz of TVP works - it weighed out to be about 4 cups!

I think something is wrong with this recipe. It was a chunky mess. Maybe you have the reconstitute the TVP first? Seemed ok after I added more water.

I had to keep adding milk to get the right consistency.

Please note the author is clearly referring to frozen, already reconstituted TVP in this recipe. If you use the dried kind (like I do), use about one cup and soak in about one cup boiling water or broth first. This will only take five to ten minutes and is much cheaper than the frozen kind of TVP. This recipe is very good served over biscuits.
