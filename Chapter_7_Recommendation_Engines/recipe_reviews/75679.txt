Peanut Butter and jelly are a great combination in my book, but sandwich peanut butter between some tortillas and heat it up a bit to get the peanut butter a little "melty" and well....you have yourself a really nice little treat! I loved dipping these in the jelly, and can't wait to try a little banana along with the peanut butter or honey for dipping - great yet simple recipe!

This was great! I have 3 boys so I used 6 tortillas(2 for each quesadillas). I sprinkled cinn/sugar on them after I fipped them too! Dipped in honey instead of jelly.

Delicious. So easy and something I never thought of! I prefer it (scratch that, I CRAVE it!) with peanut butter and sliced banana inside. Skip the jelly. You can get away without butter in the skillet too, just use a bit of pan spray. If you do use butter, I'd recommend unsalted butter.

I gave it five stars for how easy and yummy this was. I decided to make one with honey(on it not as a dip) and one with bananas. Both tasted great. I would have tried the jelly one too but happened to not have any. oops. Anyway...  This is a great dish for kids!

The question?  "Why ya puttin' my peanut butter on Taco Bread?"  Answer:  "Well, our other bread is green..."  The 4 Yr Old PB Monster was a bit hesitant to try, but went bananas for these when he did.  Just a tiny dollop of butter on the pan.  Strawberry Polaner as jelly.  Creative, quick & fun!  Great spin on the traditional PB&J.

My 8-year old son really liked this. In fact, his comment was "This thing is really good." The only thing I may do different next time is try to put the jelly on before I cook it because he said it was a little hard to scoop up with the tortilla.

I've got to give this 5 stars because it was quick, easy, and really delicious. A nice change from regular peanut butter and jelly. The only changes I made was to use a whole wheat tortilla, soy-nut butter (husband has a peanut allergy) and I used strawberry jelly because that was what I had. I also made one and added semi-sweet chocolate chips... absolutely sinful, but very, very delicious.

I was craving peanut butter and these just hit the spot. They get crispy on the outside and the inside is nice and soft. I also used honey instead of jelly dipping sauce.

Tasty but messy. The peanut butter tended to drip out since it was warm and this made a huge mess but had great flavor if you like PB&J. I think the jelly would be more practical inside the tortilla too as the dipping was not working out. You can't "dip" jelly. Quick and easy and a nice snack in a hurry.

Fantastic!  My one year old loved it, and so did we!  What a great new take on the traditional P & J.  You can even switch this up by using different flavored jellies and jams. Thanks so much for this quick and easy lunch idea!

Love this for not only the kids, but myself.  I have tried many combinations.  My favorite is PB and marshmallows, the mini kind, they just melt and make a sinful treat.  After frying in the pan let cool for a minute or two or all the filling will flow out every where.  I never use butter or cooking spray just a non-stick pan.  YUMMY!!

The flavor is good (I didn't dip in jelly though), but they are really messy, when peanut butter is heated it just liquifies. I probably would have given it a 2-3 just because of the messiness of them, but the flavor was good.

Tastes good and extremely easy... what else could you want?  My kids loved these, and it's easy to experiment with.  We've also used PB and marshmallow creme.

I was a little hesitant about giving this 5 stars after my first and only experience but I decided to go ahead as I think it is a great idea with endless options.  Firstly I will never use that much PB again as it was far too overwhelming.  I found the jam (I used big chunky strawberry) was sticky but a classic pair to the PB. I think Banana would go fabulously inside and help the melted mess stay together - honey, of course be the final touch for dipping.  Chocolate and marshmellow also sound delicious as other reviewers suggested.  I normally broil my other quesadillas and found the butter and fry pan method yummy but had a hard time fitting my folded 10" tortilla in 9" pan and found the butter to be too much although I think I would have LOVED the results with less butter.  I may baste the tortilla with butter and broil next time and with this and other quesadilla recipes. Thanks for the starting point!

This was great, my 5 year old says "it's delicious!" We both loved this.  I used corn tortillas for mine, flour for hers.  I added a small piece of chocolate to each and mixed honey and strawberry jam for the dip.  These were great, we'll definitely be making them again!  Thanks!

Quick and easy lunch when served with fruit.  We skipped the butter, as there was no need for it, and dipped them in honey.

My son likes the peanut butter,nutello and banana Quesadillas. And we make our own wraps. Spread with peanut butter on half, then nutello on other half, put banana across both and roll until the banana is covered. If sliced into bite size pieces they look like pin-wheels

I was wary of this recipe because when I think quesadillas I automatically think cheese and that threw me off...but I really wanted to use up my burrito wraps before their expiration date so I tried it. Omg! Delicious!!! I fell in love. 

I've had it so much the past couple of days. It's very very filling which is great. My favorite way to do it is with crunchy peanut butter with sliced bananas and after I press it in my Foreman grill, I drizzle honey on it. To die for. Yum! Eating it now lol

These were fantastic! They are much more enjoyable than the old pb and jayy, because there isnt a crust on these! I like putting peanut butter and honey on them, and dipping them in gooey chocolate. Also, I use a quesadilla pan since I have one.

My son absolutely loves this. He prefers the wrap over bread. I buy the whole wheat ones and he still gobbles them up. A fun little twist on the same old PB&J.

Great quick snack! The whole family loves them! Quick less-mess tip: Let them sit for 3 or 4 minutes after they're done cooking and the PB will thicken back up a bit. Yummy!

I held off on the butter, and made it a soy butter and jelly quesidilla because my family has an allergy to peanuts. Makes a nice addition to the classic! Will definately be making this again.

I just made this using peanutbutter and bananas. I spread the peanutbutter as directed then layered the bananas half way across. Folded it and fried it as directed. It turned out a nice golden color and tastes pretty good. It's not my favorite snack but it was extremely easy and the results were worth the effort. My only complaint is that it seems kinda dry. Of course, most peanutbutter sandwiches do so that isn't really much of a complaint. I also chopped up some carrots and celery to go along with it, dipping them in peanutbutter or ranch dressing. Overall a nice, mildly healthy snack. I'll probably make it again sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on the torilla as someone else mentioned. About the messiness some have mentioned, I let mine cool for a minute and it wasn't messy at all. Not even the pan was messy. Also, clean up was a breeze. Took all of 2 minutes, making me love this about 100x more.

I made these for my son who is a Cheese Quesadilla Monster.  The first time I made these for him he asked me "Where's the Cheese?"  But he did finish the entire quesadilla.  I did not use butter, just threw the tortilla on the frying pan and added the ingredients.  Much healthier without the butter.

This is a great idea for quick lunches! I stuck mine under the broiler for a couple minutes and served with baby carrots and sliced bananas.

I've been making this for years with peanut butter and nuttella... yum

oh, and I also toast the tortilla in the toaster on the lowest setting just to warm it up and make it a tad crispy.

I added jelly inside with the peanut butter and then fried it. I thought this tasted good in an interesting way. It was a little rich, but I will probably end up making this pretty often because of how easy and cheap it was. Definately worth a try.

Made these for lunch today for the grands & they loved them! I added sliced bananas & a sprinkle of mini-chocolate chips but skipped the jelly. I wish I had done as chellebelle & used butter-flavored spray as I thought they were a little greasy. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a quick, simple dinner for the kids with things I had on hand, and these were great! The PB&Nutella quesadillas were the biggest hit - yum. I will definitely make these again.

WOW. Breathtaking dish, unfortunately I have a lot of gnats in my apartment and quite a few landed and got stuck in the gelly but it's just added protein I guess. It's a little messy so I recommend wearing gloves to eat it but the taste makes up for it. I tried adding a couple bay leaves and some garlic powder but I don't recommend doing that. Sometimes mindlessly following the recipe produces better results!

Better than peanut butter toast. I used crunchy style PB. Next time I'll put thin slices of apple in with the PB.

This was a thumbs down from my 5 year old, so I ended up eating it. It was OK--made a good snack. I liked dipping it in the grape jelly because it did need something besides just the peanut butter.

My only issue with this is calling it a "quesadilla" - which is cheese and tortilla. The butter is tasty, but unnecessary - use it if you like - or feel free to leave it off, if you prefer. Take care to let it cool a bit before eating - the peanut butter is HOT, and will burn badly, if you're not careful. I used almond butter [because peanut butter doesn't love me back, anymore )=] and blueberry preserves. Very yummy! [And LOL! Apparently I can't read directions! I put almond butter on one half of the tortilla and the preserves on the other half before folding - no dipping...{=]

Just got done making & eating this.. I liked it. But prob. will stick to my usual toast with peanut butter on top. Just easier and less mess to clean up.. I did not try dipping into Jam/jelly. But if going to dip prob. should let these sit for a bit as the heat melts peanut butter which makes peanut butter run..

This is a great idea!  I used whole wheat flat bread instead of tortillas and grilled them in my panini press.  Served them with apple slices and it was the perfect lunch for me and my toddler.  Didn't even need much jelly for dipping since the peanut butter was so gooey and yummy!

Delicious...BUT a quesdadilla implies cheese...do not call it a quesadilla unless it has QUESO (cheese). This would be better called cacahuatilla from the word cacahuate (peanut) and -tilla (tortilla) or PB&J tacos...

I have made this a few times for my girls. They enjoy it alot.  I use this recipe as a guideline, I have used many different jellys and even spread apple butter on top of the peanut butter. If you put the jelly inside the tortilla be careful because it will be hotter than the peanutbutter, and will burn your mouth, so just wait a few minutes. (my girls do not like dipping their quesadilla in the jelly, so we learned the hard way.

So delicious! Perfect for when you run out of bread and still need something to eat for lunch, or have a love for peanut butter. Do not cook with jelly in the quesadilla (it get's hotter than the peanut butter and burns your mouth), and make sure you have plenty of napkins handy!

This recipe was PERFECT for me today, as I had run out of bread. For those having difficulty with the Jelly, I found the easy squeeze kind (Welch's) worked beautifully, as it is basically liquefied already, and sticks to the tortillas well. Also, the messy factor can be avoided if you spread the peanut butter 1 inch away from the edge, then when it melts it doesn't spill over. Easy, quick and delicious. (Especially for college students with random stuff lying around!)

My kids (7,4,2) did not care for this although they love regular quesadillas. Oh well. :)

This is really easy and fast to make. My 8 year old daughter loved it. I also gave a bite to my 1 year old and she loved it also. I think I will try it with banana's next time.

Kids LOVED this. I added banana slices (sliced long way) prior to cooking in the butter. I thought it was good but nothing I'd crave. It was a major major hit for my 2, 3, and 4 yr olds. They ate every bit. I did make sure it was pretty well cooled before serving because that peanut butter is like molten lava right when it comes out of the pan. Mine wasn't running all over the place as other reviewers had said but I didn't even cut them until they had cooled to just being warm, that may have helped the pb set a bit.  I also didn't add any "dips" but offered honey to drizzle on because I preferred it that way and only the 2 yr old wanted it, the other two loved it the way it was.   Served it with halved cherry tomatoes and baby carrots, they ALL had clean plates!

These are quite yummy!  I was surprised.  We had them for lunch one day and both enjoyed them.  They were a bit messy and runny, but still really good.

ehhh....I wasn't a big fan of the whole warm peanut butter on a tortilla thing...I think it's probably one of those things you either like it or you don't...but it's defedently worth trying.

I was so excited when first saw this recipe, but after giving it a shot I was disappointed. The peanut butter tasted funny after it melted :( I tried it with chocoate chips and that wasn't good then I tried it with honey and it tasted very wierd lastly I tried it with jelly and I was still not satisfied. I probably won't try this again.

I gave this 5 stars as a busy mom of 4 boys-16, 14, 11 and 4.  This is so freaking easy and ALL the guys like it, even the neighbor kids.  We like to spread just a little apple butter on top of the peanut butter before cooking, not too much or it is a huge mess(but still really yummy!)!  Even the hubby likes it for a snack!

Wonderful idea, and so yummy!!
I used one whole tortilla, put the peanut butteron the whole thing, placed another whole tortilla on top, and when I flipped it when golden, added cinn/sugar and dipped in honey, just great.

I make these often for my two boys as a quick lunch. I serve it either with a homemade applesauce or with honey. I 
will often mash up a banana and mix it up with the peanut butter before I cook it for added fruit boost.

Made these for my daughter's 3rd grade class.  We took someone else's suggestion and made half of them with bananas (we were trying to use up some bananas) but the PB & J ones were definitely the much bigger hit with the kids.

I made these for my 3 kids for dinner.  They absolutely loved it!  A great change from the ordinary PB & J sandwich.  My hubby and I are their left-overs.  I shared this recipe with my co-workers the very next day.  A hit in our home.

They were ok. My daughter thought they were cool.  I tried the bananas and honey for dipping.
