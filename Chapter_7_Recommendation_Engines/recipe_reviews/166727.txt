This is how I've always made my sausage balls and they are never dry.  The key is to make sure sausage and cheese at at room temp when you start mixing and that everything is mixed well.  There should be no traces of the biscuit mix left when you start to form the balls.  The only way to get it mixed correctly is to use your hands.  I always have a couple dozen of these in my freezer ready to go.

the dry issue can be solved by adding cream cheese, I use about 4 to 6 ounces.  i also added garlic salt and tabasco sauce ;-)

WAY too biscuit-y.  These are super-dry.  You have all the right ingredients, but your proportions are off.  Maybe something like 122 sausage balls would be perfect.

I think it would be just perfect with only two cups of bisquick. The mixture wouldn't mix well so I HAD to add 1/2 cup of milk.  Next time I will try 2 cups of bisquick.

I love it, this is MY recipe also, learned in junior high home ec, but if you add 1/3- 1/4 cup water, they turn out PERFECT. Ive taken them to work countless times over 12 years, and they ALL want to know the secret to keeping them moist....

This the same recipe my Aunt uses when she makes them. You can add more cheese too, if you like.  She did once and they turned out fine. As the other person said let the sausage and cheese set for awhile out of the refrigerator and they won't be dry. My Aunt always said that when your kneading the ingredients, you know your done when it looks like a "brain" sitting in your bowl!

Loved this recipe.  I like proportion of more biscuit and cheese, less sausage.  Some say it is dry, but I think it is perfect.  My mom adds a sprinkle of milk to make dough moist.  No real difference.  A great starter, breakfast, or snack.

This is the perfect sausage ball recipe.   I use pioneer brand biscuit mix  I just like it better than other brands.   The only advice I would give is make sure your sausage is room temp.  Mix the biscuit mix first until there is no mix left in the bottom of your bowl. Then add the cheese.  Be patient it takes a little time but they are worth it.

A little dry.  I used jimmy dean sausage in one batch and vegetarian in the other.  These are best served up with some apple butter. YUMMMY.

These were delicious!  Many of the other sausage ball recipes seem more like meatballs, and these are like savory biscuits almost exactly like my mother in law makes.  I did cook the pork sausage first to make them a bit less greasy, then mixed everything together with just a little bit of water to keep it together.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great! The only thing I do differently is cut the Bisquick down to 1 1/2 cups and throw in some spices.

These are the sausage balls my mother made back in the 60s and 70s.  I  made mine with chicken instead of pork sausage, and they came out great.  These can easily be reheated by putting them in a paper bag and placing in a 350-degree oven for 5-10 minutes.

This recipe forget the milk. The milk changes it into dough and makes it much easier to form the balls.

Warning: Don't use the super cheap sausage-they will be greasy and nasty.  I used the Piggly Wiggly brand-the one that just says "sausage" and the balls were like goop when they came out of the oven.  I've had success using Jimmy Dean hot sausage though.  My husband can't get enough of these when I make them.  They are super bad for you, so I only make them every once in a while.

These sausage balls are not the ones I know and love. I am not sure why just yet. The ingredients are right, so it must be the proportions. Definitely seems skimpy on the cheese, not enough flavor, maybe needed more sausage too. On the positive side, I did add a splash of soy milk so that the dough was easier to work with and the consistency of the balls are good.
