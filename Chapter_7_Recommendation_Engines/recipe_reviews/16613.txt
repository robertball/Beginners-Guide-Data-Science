You've really got to like bleu cheese, but if you do, this one's for you!  This recipe got rave reviews from the bleu cheese fans at the party, and "not so hot" from the less hearty!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I stupidly only put half the blue cheese in it that was called for. I thought 8 oz. sounded like too much but I don't think it would be. I will definately try the recipe again with the proper amount of blue cheese in it.

I prepared this without modifications at a dinner party and no one would eat it. It had way too strong a flavor for most people to eat, probably the blue cheese.

Great Basic  Recipe. I made mine with blue cheese and roasted walnuts.  I wished I had thrown in some sun dried tomatoes.  Everyone loved it.

Really good if you like blue cheese.  I didn't use peanuts, just parsley to cover.  It went over really well.  Would definately make it again.

This recipe was 'ok' but didn't go down as well as others.  Very strong blue cheese flavour.

I agree with the other reviewer.  You have to be a blue cheese fan for this one.  It just sort of leaves your mouth dry.  My husband liked it though and that is why I am giving it 3 stars.  Will not be making this one again.  Sorry, but I am still looking for that 5 star cheese ball.

I don't eat blue cheese but made this for my blue cheese loving husband. He liked it and said that the peanuts were surprisingly good. He said the only reason he would not give it a 5 star rating is because you couldn't really taste the parsley.
