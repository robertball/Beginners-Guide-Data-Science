This came out soooo gooood!  The mixture came out a bit watery so I added cornstarch like someone suggested and the patties came out denser and firmer.  My family raved about them and the leftovers the next day was even better.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made another egg foo yung recipe but used the sauce from this recipe.  Though I can't comment on the egg foo yung, the sauce was terrific--one I will use for many other dishes when I need a delicious gravy or sauce.

Simply DELICIOUS! The sauce is wonderfully flavorful and the soy sauce is not over powering the flavors as some sauces do. I left out the extra salt as I don't like super salty foods but it is still plenty salty because of the Soy Sauce and what is added to canned broth. YUMMY!!

This deserevs 10 stars. I grew up in Chicago and this is the way my favorite resturant made egg foo young. I moved to CA and can't find egg foo young like this anywhere. I am so glad you posted this. Now I can have egg foo young no matter where I live. Thank you so much.

These were good, they make a healthly lunch or dinner. I added a little cornstarch to the eggs as another reviewer suggested, but they still ran a little. I also added a lot of extra soy sauce to the gravy because I like it that way. I'll definitely make this again.

I 'm going to rate this one actually a 3.75 :-) I think it does need some more tweaking but is a good start. I added in some more veggies and garlic and a bit of cornstarch to the egg mixture. I also used egg beaters from a carton rather than whole eggs. The eggs still do spread out to fill the whole pan, but if you wait for them to cook a little, you can smoosh/ fold the eggs into piles and make nice looking egg foo yung patties.
The sauce needs a lot of seasoning help IMHO. I added some garlic and a dash of honey and liked it much better that way.

I made this recipe, upon my husbands request. Our family of 5 loved it! I omitted the bean sprouts(didn't have any)and the salt from both the eggs and sauce. I used ham rather than shrimp, only because I'm prego and can't have 'em. If mamma can't have 'em, nobody can have 'em!! I did add just a bit more soy sauce to gravy, as well as a bit more cornstarch. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Served over rice and had the perfect meal! I'll certainly be making again. Thanks for sharing!

The egg patties were really good, but I thought the sauce tasted odd.  I might have put too much pepper in, though.  I'll try this again sometime.

Edited Later:  I tried this again a couple times, and it came out much better.  A substitution NOT to make:  vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  This is one of the few instances where they are not interchangeable (it tastes awful).

Yummo! It was so good. This dish takes me back to my childhood. It was my dad's favorite Chinese dish. He would love the flavor in this. I did add canned shrimp juice to my gravy. This dish did not need no added salt as recipe required. I added a tbsp of cornstarch and deleted all the oil. used nonstick pan and medium-low heat with lid.  Came out great.

Very good recipe, but you do NOT need the extra salt in the gravy. The sodium from the chicken broth and the soy sauce is quite sufficient.

I absolutely loved this!  Instead of the green onions, I added a chopped white onion.  My sauce, unfortunately, ended up with big lumps of cornstarch...likely my fault as I probably added the cornstarch/water too quickly.  I did leave the additional salt out of the sauce as I thought the soy sauce would be sufficient.  The patties turned out perfectly, nice and dense and full of flavour.  I was able to use some of the sauce and it was thick and delicious.  I can't wait to make more today.  Definitely a recipe woth a try!

The egg omelet was absolutely wonderful and I thank you so much for that as this dish is one of my fav's when we order out. I just wish I could find a good thick sauce recipe, which is more like a gravy that we get from our local restuarant. Thanks Kimber!

I think this recipe is good when you have alot of bean sprouts.  Alot of other recipes call for half the bean sprouts of this one but add other veggies.  I liked the egg pancakes.  What I didn't care for was the sauce.  It was too vinegary and not sweet and salty enough to satiate the desire for egg foo yung I have made in the past.  In the future, I will make your egg pancakes but use another sauce.

I tried this recipe impulsively for my husband because he loves the dish from the restaurant. It turned out really good. I did use fresh mushrooms, celery, green onion and white onion as the veggies. Not a huge beansprout fan. I also did not have the ingriedients to make the sauce so I substituted a chicken gravy package and added 3 tblspoons of soy sauce to it. Could hardly taste the difference. Will definitely cook again. I reccommend about 3 min per side though. They turned out a little darker on 4 min.

These were very good. Next time I will add more onion. My sauce turned out like sauce...not like gravy but it still added a nice flavor to them. The bean sprouts were good in these cuz they didn't have that really earthy flavor. I will def make these again.

This was pretty good. I didnt have bean sprouts so I lightly steamed asparagus and cut them into small pieces, and I used sliced shitake mushrooms. For some reason I had a really hard time forming a patty. I guess that just takes practice. By preparing the shrimp and asparagus the day before, this was a very quick meal to make when I came home.

I was looking for something new to do with shrimp and this was just right. It was easy & healthy... I just left out some of the yolks and added a few more whites. I know this is going to become a new staple. Oh yeah, did I mention it tasted great!

I love the flavor of this recipe. Thank you for adding the recipe for the gravy. You can also cook this up like a fritata if you don't want to do individual patties. In an oven proof skillet precook the vegetable like you would a stir fry. Add your meat and heat it through. When the meat is warmed pour in the beaten eggs. Continue cooking on the stove until eggs are at least half way set. Finish cooking in a 350 degree oven until eggs are set and golden brown. Slice it up like a pie, add the gravy and you have something that tastes the same and you don't have to worry about the patties holding together. My family calls it egg footata.

This "Shrimp Egg Foo Yung" recipe is a definite keeper! Yummy, yum, yum! I often have bean sprouts in the fridge (leftover from another recipe) that I have no idea what to do with. Never again! I was attracted to this recipe because the recipe description said I could freeze it. I used fresh button mushrooms (not caned). I divided the egg mixture among 6 mini-quiche dishes and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes because I wanted to freeze it in the cooled quiche dishes (which have lids for the freezer). By chance, this recipe had a very attractive presentation when prepared this way ("uniform pancake-like circular patties" - not browned though). I loosened the egg mixture from the quiche dishes while it was still hot because I wanted to be able to remove it easily after freezing. The defrosted "patties" reheated in my toaster oven tasted good; however, I can gobble these up quickly, so I am not likely to ever freeze them again. I had made a very delicious homemade chicken stock to make the "chicken-broth sauce" with (which I had planed to thicken with cashew nut flour because I don't eat cornstarch); however, I decided I really enjoyed the way this "Shrimp Egg Foo Yung" tasted without the sauce (which was more convenient for reheating from the freezer anyway, especially in single portions). I repurposed the chicken stock. I will definitely make the base of this recipe (no "chicken-broth sauce") again and again. Thank you Kimber for sharing your recipe.

I cut the recipe in half and it did not work. the eggs shrimp and bean sprouts looked like I was trying to make an omlet instead of the patties. The gravy wasn't good either. Please do a video on this one.

I did love it, and my hubby enjoyed it a lot!  Next time I will add cornstarch to the eggs also, but this is my bad.  Pretty easy and delish!

I loved this recipe! It was my first attempt at making egg foo young and was very easy to follow. I didn't use the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. I try not to use salt, so I cut that out as well. I didn't have the bean sprouts or white pepper but it was still delicious.

Thank you for this exceptionally easy and flavorful Egg Fu Yung recipe! I made a few simple changes-- since I didn't have bean sprouts, I used celery and green pepper chopped very fine, and teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. This is as good as any I gotten in a restaurant, if not better, and now I can make it at home! THANK YOU!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I added starch to the mixture as suggested by others and used egg whites in place of the eggs. I will be making this dish again and again. Great job!!!

loved this recipe, and the tip with the cornstarch is so helpful. the only thing i changed, i don't care for the canned shrimp, so, at my fave store, you can purchase lovely fresh shrimp, any amount you require, be it 1 or 100. i used 1 fairly large prawn, and it really made it much tastier.

This was such an easy dish to prepare....I struggled a bit on forming the patties but I know that was due to the medium shrimp I used along with the fresh sliced mushrooms, but otherwise it was easy to prepare and my family loved it!

This "Shrimp Egg Foo Yung" is excellent! I bake it at 350 for 45 minutes in mini quiche dishes. I have made it many times and skip the gravy (not necessary for me). Thank you Kimber for sharing your recipe.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was easy to make, and delicious!  Much better and far more fresh than from a restaurant.  I will make this again!  Maybe I will try roast pork in place of the shrimp...

Good recipe.  The only changes I made were to the sauce.  I used beef brother instead of chicken, and instead of the 2 Tbs. soy, I used 1Tbs. soy and 1Tbs. oyster sauce.  Delish!
