I made these to take to a church potluck and they are wonderful.  Easy and only a  few normal ingredients.  I had to leave the leftovers at church because if they had come home with me, I would have had the rest for dinner!

i made these tonight and the taste is there, but the part where we need to roll the dough was impossible to roll into a ball. The dough was extremely wet and sticky to roll it. I followed to the T. Not sure what happened.
