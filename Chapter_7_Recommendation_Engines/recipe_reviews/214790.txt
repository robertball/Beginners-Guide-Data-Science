I thought this would turn out really good... it was terrible. All the flavors were wrong and if you do decide to cook it it needs to be cooked longer than 30 min -- more like 45 or 50. veryyyyy disappointed.

I made this exactly like the recipe, except that I browned the chicken in butter, for  more flavor. I was really surprised at how good it was. It was very different. I wouldn't have thought to pair artichokes and curry powder, but it was a good mix. We ate so much we were stuffed. Yummy!!

I thought the curry in this was a little overpowering.  It was still good but next time I will only use half of the amount.  Other than that I thought it was delicious.  The croutons added a nice touch (I used sourdough bread).

Very flavorful. I loved the addition of lemon juice in the sauce. I usually shy away from cans of soup added to recipes, but I just had to try this. If I make again, I would probably add less curry, only because I could smell curry as I ate this.I would also add extra artichokes.

It was a nice change and had interesting flavor combinations, but I doubt I'll put it into the regular rotation.

It was not very good.  I actually went back afterwards to check and see if maybe I missed a step.  I didn't.  The soup and mayo mixture was SOOOO thick I felt like I was eating just condensed cream of chicken soup.  It would have been better if water/ milk, something liquid was added to dilute the sauce.

So I have used the combo of "cream of" soups with Mayo for a different casserole. It makes an amazing mix, expecially when you add curry. Sorry to those who don't like this, but low/reduced or fat free mayo will RUIN this. It doesn't add the right zip, but rather a sweetness that is icky. ANYWAY! I made this for supper when we were down to the dregs before grocery shopping. Only changes made: out of lemon so used pepperoncini juice which is a decent substitute, and added egg noodles cooked al dente. Yummy yummy!

Husband loves this dish but if it were up to me, I'd give it 1 star.  I couldn't suggest any changes as it was all wrong to me.  However, I used reduced fat Mayo to cut down on the fat.  I doubt that was the cause of the poor taste.

Such a delicious and unique combination! Only change I made was to use boneless chicken breasts and I cubed and browned them instead of boiling.

I used chicken breasts instead of bone-in and 2 cups of buttered Panko bread crumbs instead of the croutons. Since I am not a fan of curry, I substituted with basil. Absolutely delicious! This will remain as a favorite for chicken dishes.
