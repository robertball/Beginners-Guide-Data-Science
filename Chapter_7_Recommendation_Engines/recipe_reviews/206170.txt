there is never any cooking involved in sofrito...you must not be familiar with it. You add sofrito to cooked dishes such as beans, corned beef (PRican syle), and chicken...the list goes on and on.

Every caribbean family has their own version of Sofrito. Pixelsicle's version contains all the basic ingredients.  Great tip on the ice cube freezing - helps you portion it perfectly. I'm not sure what the the reviews are referring to "cooking", there are some people who roast the peppers to give the sofrito more flavor. But yes, the sofrito is used when cooking your dish.

Worked great for me, ended up using it in both arroz con pollo and black beans, very tasty. BTW, you don't cook Sofrito until you are ready to put it into a dish.

Absolutely WONDERFUL base Pixelsicle!!!
We (Arecibo, PR) use the above ingredients (Excluding the chilli peppers), plus cilantro, recao (Culantro leaf/ves),ajices dulce (Sweet peppers: looks like a jabanero but flatter looking and NOT spicy) and absolutely NO tomato (For longer freezer life).
I guess different parts of the Island make it different.  Some more simpler than others. ;0)

This was THE BEST sofrito recipe! Sometimes I add red tomatoes and use less peppers or add some cilantro. Yummy on soups, beans and meats.

There is no cooking involved. No combining of the ingredients through heat. This is more of a cold salsa recipe.  Not impressed.
