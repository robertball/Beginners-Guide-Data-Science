I make this same thing only i use deviled ham instead of the beef and add a couple of dashes of hot sauce. Serve it with Ritz crackers and I promise you it will be the first thing to disappear from the buffet table!!

This is an excellent appetizer!  To remove some of the saltiness, I rinsed and pat-dried the dried beef before chopping.  Then I added a pinch of bacon salt (yes this does exist! bacon flavored salt) as I am not a fan of MSG.  This addition did not make the recipe salty.

I've made this for years but my recipe calls for one additional item, chopped pimento olives.  The red piminto gives it a festive look. I don't use the monosodium glutamate, it's  nasty chemicals and anyone who gets migraines should stay away from it.

This was a huge hit at our Christmas get-together, there was barely any left over.  I reluctantly had to leave out the MSG because I couldn't find any in the store, but now that I know that "Accent" is the same thing, I'll follow the recipe next time.

This was a simple recipe.  I found it to mix better with about 2 Tbsp. of milk and placed in a covered dish--refrigerating overnight.

Tasted ok, but seemed to be missing something.  I don't know if I would do it again.
