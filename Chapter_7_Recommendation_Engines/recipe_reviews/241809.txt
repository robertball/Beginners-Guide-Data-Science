It was quite good. Needed a fair amount of salt and could stand for some heat (spice). I would also add more potatoes next time. I did microwave the potato cubes first so that they would be all the way cooked.

I have made this several times. I have never added the potatoes, I always serve over rice.  I only add 11 ounces of coconut milk (1 jug from sprouts).  I did not have fresh spinach the first time and used frozen, which I have used each time.  My husband tolerates this curry recipe after the many I have tried and will allow me to keep making it.

I replaced the chicken with kielbasa sausage and the spinach with bok choy leaves.. I also added some spicy paprika and chili powder to add some spice. I really enjoyed it and will definitely make it that way again.

This was one of those recipes I chose because it was easy to substitute ingredients. I made it for two added some frozen cauliflower and substituted sweet potatoes for the white ones. I would just put the potatoes in later so they aren't so soft. But it was tasty and easy.

I did not add potatoes, doubled the curry, added only 3 cups of coconut milk and as one other cook had done used frozen spinach but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a mess.  Very soupy, no taste.  Would not make this again

I liked the recipe but added grape tomatoes and chopped green onions. I also reduced the coconut milk to 2 - 14 oz cans (all I had on hand) and served it over rice. It was very good!

I didn't have potatoes so I left them out ( admit it would have been nice with) and I used frozen spinach. I added a bit of garam masala as I had just made a fresh batch,  and added some chilli powder. I used only 400ml of coconut milk (a bit less than 2 cups) and that was plenty. Maybe with potatoes and fresh spinach more coconut milk would be necessary, but I doubt that 5 cups would be needed.

This recipe is really great, I'm just not a fan of coconut and used half what was in the recipe and added more curry.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was amazing. I did substitute seasoned salt for pink himalayan sea salt and forgot the cayenne but all in all it turned out yummy. I cut my potatoes rather small to be sure they cooked through in the 30 minutes. I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious Fast Chicken Curry Haiku: "Should've been 5 stars! Potatoes not quite tender, and chicken was done." I made this recipe exactly as written, and the flavor was fantastic, but after 45 min., the cubed potatoes were still pretty rock-ish (disappointing!), so I made some quick rice to eat everything over instead, and we ate around the potatoes. I want to make this again, but would consider swapping the potatoes for garbanzo beans instead.
