Instead of throwing out all that liquid and paying for enchilada sauce you can use 3 cups of liquid and your own spices; salt, pepper, garlic, cumin and chili powder of your choice plus some diced onion and bell pepper add only a little more effort.

I agree with RBcook. Instead of adding water to the juices I used 3 8 oz cans of mexican tomato sauce, 4 chopped fresh jalapenos with seeds and 1 bunch fresh cilanto.

This is very good and easy. After the first cooking you get rid of all the fat so it's very lean in the end, unlike many shredded meat recipes. It's not very spicy and next time I think I will add 1-2 packages of taco seasoning with the enchilada sauce.

Instead of the enchilada sauce, I added a can of tomatoes and green chilies and a small can of green chilies, plus a small diced onion. Very good and tender

You have to try this! I suggest adding the onions, garlic and cumin like the other reviews say.  We didn't get to add cilantro but will for sure next time.  I can't wait to make this for my hispanic inlaws!  Talk about brownie points. HeHe

Drain off any fat and add the cooking liquid back to the shredded meat. Then continue cooking until the juices are reducedâ€¦(very thick).

Great recipe, but I did make a few additions. I added two 15 oz.containers of fresh salsa, and half of a 16 oz. container of sliced jalapenos, along with a little of the liquid. I also dropped in some chopped onion and cilantro. Fast, easy and super delicioso.

Made this recipe as written. Very easy and tasty. I usually add onion, but the first time I made it as written. If you did not make this recipe as written, then DON'T review it. If you want your own version of this on here, then post it in your own post instead of giving low stars to this one when you never even made it.

After moderations, this recipe is great.  First, I left out the pork and added adobo to the seasonings. After the alloted time in the crock pot, I drained meat then added one can of RED enchilada sauce plus 8 oz of beef broth. Turned pot up to high for 30 min. Last step was to add sliced carmelized onions and peppers and for another 15 min. WONDERFUL!

This  was a nice slow cooked shredded beef recipe. The only thing I found wrong was the name.  Just as an fyi only and with all due respect, this is not machaca.  This does go great in tacos, burritos, or served openly on a plate with rice and beans but this mexican plate is called "carne desebrada".  In order for it to be called Machaca, the meat would have to be 100% dried like beef jerky, then shredded very finely while dry, once finely shredded, it gets prepared for meals. But the taste and texture can never be mistaken for shredded beef as its very distinct and delicious.  There are even restaurants that mistakenly call some of there dishes macahaca, when it is really shredded beef.

My mom used to make this and I loved it!  I've modified a bit:  no pork, only beef;  no liquid in the pot until after you shred the beef, then add a can of Rotel and enchilada sauce.  I usually wrap it in a warm tortilla but on rice is good, too.

Instead of enchilada sauce, I used Anaheim peppers, jalapeÃ±os, onion, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. Cooked this with just enough water to cover.  Cooled, I blended it in my magic bullet! Very yummy!

I cannot keep my husband out of the crockpot-we might not have enough for dinner if he keeps going back to "sample".  I drained off the liquid and kept about a cup.  I added cumin, onion powder, garlic and chili pepper to the cup and mixed it back with the meat along with the enchilada sauce.  Very delicious.

Not only did I like this Machaca but I couldn't find anyone that I served it to, that didn't. It was wonderful!  Good job Tusconmom, you're close enough to the border to appreciate a good AUTHENTIC Mexican meal!!

I followed the recipe to a T.  I think it would have been super tasty if I had cut the cook time in half! Way too long!!! Ruined $40! I will try it again when I can stay at home and watch it!

Added spices, combined tips from most helpful ratings:  onion, cumin, cilantro, chili powder, hot chilies, more garlic, Montreal steak spice, Cholula, Better Than Bouillon vegetable bouillon with 1 cup of water . After cooking pork loin, no beef used, whole atop the spices and onions with added bouillon.  to just barely cooked, took out and cubed. Less work than cubing raw meat. Cooked another couple hours on low. Left overnight on warm setting. On serving day turned on high for 6 hours + with lid off to reduce the juices. Stirred every couple of hours. Added green enchilada sauce an hour before serving. Everyone loved this dish. Served for a party. Great on both corn and flour tortillas. Served with: salsa (regular and mango), sour cream mixed with yogurt, guacamole, Kraft TexMex cheese, lettuce, red onions thinly sliced, seasoned rice & beans, fresh peppers strips and diced fresh tomatoes.
