I'm not a real fan of strawberry shortcake so I wasn't sure I'd like this recipe.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!  The addition of Jell-O and cream cheese and sweet blueberries really makes this dish awesome.  Your guests WILL rave (mine did) and will eat a much bigger piece than you think....!!

thanks for the base idea for a wonderful cake!  i nixed the jello altogether because i'm really not a big fan.  i laid the pound cake in the bottom of the pan, and topped with a handful of blueberries, raspberries, and diced strawberries.  then i poured over a can of blueberrie pie filling.  then the cheesecake mixture, topped with the fresh fruit flag.  TO DIE FOR!!!  it's a 4th of july tradition!

I made a similar version of this cake 10 years ago.  However, it didn't have Jello on the bottom.  Instead, you used 2 layers of Pound Cake(or personal preference) with a layer in the middle of vanilla custard or pudding that had pureed blueberries and strawberries in it.  Yum!  The kids really seemed to like this version with the Jello though.  Easier to make then the other one.

The yello taste was overwhelming, didn't taste the cheese cake part, but it looks very pretty for the occasion!

I am not someone to bake/cook a whole lot but I can honestly say that I made this and it came out great.  I followed the directions exactly and brought it to a Memorial Day party.  I got great reviews and I was really happy with the way it turned out.  Next time I may try to do sugar free jello, sugar free cool whip and light cream cheese....

It was a pretty dessert to take to a Memorial Day picnic. It was good but I wouldn't crave it and I prefer the sugar cookie version better.

This was very good. I didn't let the Jello sit long enough before I added it to the pan so my pound cake floated, but it was still delicious

This was really delicious!  I made exactly as directed except I used Entemanns All Butter Loaf since I couldn't find the recommended pound cake.  Worked just fine but used two loaves.  I don't know if that's because I sliced them too thick.  In any event, this receipe is easy, refreshing and just plain yummy.  I did not think the topping was too rich as others did.  Personal preference?

Good Cake - I've never made anything quite like it before - jello doesn't exist in my world!!
I sliced the strawberries and overlapped them on the frosting to make the stripes more obvious.

This is one of the easiest cakes to decorate I have ever made. I brought it to my local VFW and got rave reviews. I told them to make sure if there was any left that it needed to be refrigerated. When I went to help clean up, there was non left. I was so happy everyone liked it. Will make this one again.

It is an okay cake.  I'm glad I tested it out before making it for the 4th.  I don't really like the jello in it.  This is not a cake I would make again.

I used my mom's cheesecake recipe with the strawberry/blueberry decoration on top and it was a hit at my in-law's 4th of July party.  Thanks for the creative idea.

My friend brought this to one of our 4th of July parties and everyone loved it. So I finally got around to making it myself, as desert for our Fathers Day grill. What a treat, its simple enough to make and perfect for a hot summer day. Yum!

Husband and son loved it. I loved how easy. It was to make and so festive.   Used sugar free jello, fat  free cream cheese and stevia instead of sugar. Used cool whip recipe from site and added the cream cheese per this recipe.

Very good--refreshing, easy, quick, no baking required--my  family loved it. It tastes even better the next day after the flavors have "married." It looked very patriotic at my 4th of July picnic. I will definitely make it a tradition.

I made as directed, but I baked my own pound cake from scratch. I would give this recipe 5 stars for appearance, but only 1 or 2 for taste. The Jell-O layer just didn't seem to go well with the other layers. I think pudding would have been a better choice for that layer.

I made this wrong!  So, I can't give it 5 stars based on what I did.  BUT, what I ended up with was really great and got rave reviews!  I only had one strawberry jello, so I used a packet of unlavored gelatin and added 1.5 tsp to that.  I also didn't have cool whip, so I made whipped cream with heavy whipping cream, sour cream and sugar - of which I was supposed to used powdered but only had granulated!  I also only had 2 hours til party time, not the 4 hours required to chill!  So, I put it in the freezer instead for an hour - and it all worked out.  Really tasty.  I think I will make the jello again the same way as I did before, but try using cool whip next time as that would be way faster and easier!  But it did have a great tangy taste making homemade... :)  Thanks so much for this recipe, I will be sure to make it again!

It was OK.  The pound cake was a little soggy in it, so I am not sure if I goofed it up or not.

I loved this cake. My parents asked me to make a cake for the Fourth of July and this was what I decided on.  Putting Jell-O in the pound cake sounded weird at first but it turned out great.  Everyone loved it!

Very tasty and kinda light. I subbed 1/3 less fat cream cheese & fat free whipped cream for the full fat variety; the topping was very yummy. I was worried how all layers would work together and it worked surprisingly well. Of course the presentation couldn't be beat for 4th of July celebration. I've already had requests to make this again.

This was a fun and tasty addition to our 4th of July celebration. I put the cool whip on the top without adding the cream cheese and sugar. I think it was a lighter tasting dessert this way, where as the cream cheese would make it taste too heavy. I felt like I was cheating because I normally make a "homemade" dessert but everyone loved it and it was gone in a flash of a firework. :)

It was really good, but I made some changes though. I didn't want cool whip in mine because I wanted a more cheesecake taste so I added more sugar and an extra package of cream cheese, and then added some sour cream and vanilla to my cheesecake mix so I would have enough to spread across the top and cover it well. It was awesome and my guests loved it!!

I won't make this again I don't care for the Jell-o with the cake. I also didn't care for so much cream cheese in the frosting.  Guests weren't fans either. It was pretty to look at but that was about all.

I made this over the weekend just for fun and thought it turned out rather well. I think the mixture of cool whip and cream cheese for the topping was quite rich. I think next time I will use fat free cream cheese and/or light cool whip.

Yummy and easy!  I did add a splash of vanilla to the whipped topping.  I used sliced strawberries across the top (instead of halves) - it looked great and was a hit on the 4th of July. I would like to try using angle food cake next time for something lighter - I did use light cool whip, light cream cheese, and sugar free jello and it turned out very good.

It turned out OK but I am not a fan.  Jello just didn't taste right mixed with cream cheese and all together a let down.  Recipe however is fine and works as directed so this is a matter of personal taste.

I made this for my family reunion in 2008 and will be making it again this weekend for my grandma's birthday.  I absolutely LOVE this dessert and it lasted about 5 minutes the last time I made it.  There is another recipe out there that is the same but without the cream cheese or sugar for anyone who doesn't want the cream cheese in it.  Fantastic and so easy to make.

This recipe was a great hit at a bbq i went to tonight. i hadn't realized that it would take 4 hours for it to set and i was freaking out. after 1 hour i had no choice but to frost it. but turns out 1 hour was perfect timing. so all my worries were over. i will definitely make this again!!!

Loved this recipe! It was easy and fun to make, and went over very well at our fourth of July gathering. I would give this a 4 1/2, actually...but since I couldn't do that, I went with a 4. My sister suggested using red rasberries for the stripes...I think I'll try that next time!

My work had a potluck for the 4th of July and I brought this. I really wasn't sure how it was going to taste because putting the Jell-O in the pound cake seemed odd but it was a hit. The topping was my favorite part!

This cake was a HUGE hit! It was so easy to make and fun b/c my young children were able to help decorate it with the fruits. The best part is that you don't ever need to turn on your oven. A perfect summer cake - not just for the 4th of July.

I was a little worried that it wasn't going to turn out but, boy was I wrong! Not only did it look great but, it tasted great too! I'll have to find another was to decorate the top of the cake because there is no way I can wait for another "patriotic" holiday to make this cake again!

Even tho I live in London, England, I made this for my Boston-born son in Saturday and he was delighted :-)  He doesn't like cheesecake, so I just topped the cake and jelly (as we call it over here) with whipped topping, then decorated as seen. It was a great hit.

this is a wonderful light, tastie  dessert.  A big hit with my big family, it will go into the family recipes to be made again.  I loved this easy to do cheesecake.  Bet it would be good with an angle food cake bottom, also.

AWESOME.  I used blackberries for the outside of the "flag" and it was good, just rolled them in some sugar so they were not so bitter.  Will make again next year.
