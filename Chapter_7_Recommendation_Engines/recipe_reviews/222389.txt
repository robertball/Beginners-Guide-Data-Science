I didn't try this recipe, but I wanted to say I see my grandma doing this since ever. I asked her to teach me how to make it about five years ago, and have been making my homemade herb salt since then. We always add onion and garlic. I love the flavor. Also, the onion helps blend the herbs together, since I use a regular blender. My grandma adds marjoram to hers, but I can never find fresh marjoram when I need it. Since I love basil, I use it instead.  I never tried to season cooked food at the table with this and I don't see it working (maybe it is because I add onion and garlic?), but I use my herb salt to season pretty much anything I am cooking. Try it on your rice. You won't believe how much better they will taste.

Wonderful! My whole house smells amazing! So easy to make. I doubled the recipe and filled 7 "Ball" 8oz crystal jelly jars with a little left over for me!

Yummy and I am such a fan of rosemary.  I used Kosher salt, my preferred salt. Next time will not grind the salt.  Dry out the rosemary first then grind just add to unground Kosher salt.

sweet and simple and great for gift-giving!  we added all kinds of extra "goodies" the second time we made this - sesame seeds,finely ground nuts, garlic granules... but the original recipe is lovely and a great all-round seasoning - especially with the fresh herbs!

What a fantastic recipe! I made it with the herbs listed in the recipe but I'll be using others that Chef John mentioned in the footnote. I use it on everything - absolutely love it! Thanks Chef John - another winner :)

Made as described this is delicious. Yes, the colour does fade over time bit the flavour is great. Will definitely be making it again.
