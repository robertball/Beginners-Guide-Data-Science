This was absoluely wonderful.  We had it last night for dinner and my husband could not stop  praising it.  I halved the recipe, and it worked fine, althought it would have been just as good to keep the full amount of grits, if not better and easier..  I had large shrimp that I cut into thirds; use the full amount (based on halved) of hotness and after the first surprising 'bite' we decided it had the perfect amount of heat to it.  Since there were not  much grits I could not layer it, so I just poured some shrimp mixture in the pan and then put grits on top and mixed it up; then I did that again, madce about three 'layers.' - put the cheese on top baked and it came out super.  The smell while cooking was so good too.  I will make this again and again.  Perfect amount of everything.  Mine was not soupy at all.  UPDATE - made again for my 85 year od parents from NC and they too LOVED it - in fact loved so much they kept complimenting me on it all during the game.  I accidently poured all the can including juice into it; but it was fine.  Its now in my 'Favorite' Box.  Thanks

My family loved this recipe, however, a little too spicy for us and I left out the hot sauce.  Will definitely make again and allow husband and one son to hot season on their own; myself and younger son will not.  I think we would prefer less olive oil to saute the shrimp in as I added this to the casserole and it was a little too soupy. Thanks again for a lovely dinner we are looking forward to again.

This is a great recipe! You can easily adjust the spiciness to your preference. My hubby and I like only a little bit of heat, so I skipped the hot pepper sauce and only added a pinch of cayenne. I halved the recipe, using only 1 lb. shrimp, but I wish that I had kept the grits the full amount. Just be sure to watch the grits and not let them boil over (I ended up scrubbing my stovetop for a while)! We really enjoyed this meal. Creamy, yummy goodness!

I served this for our champagne breakfast/brunch on Thanksgiving.  It was a huge success!  I excluded the diced tomatoes as I didn't have any on hand and I was NOT going back to the supermarket after doing all of the Thanksgiving shopping!  My family loved this and has requested for this to be a part of our favorite meals.  :) Thanks for sharing!  ;)

Flavor is Right on.   When I served it I gave extra hot sauce and cheese to whoever wanted it spicier or cheesier and it was a hit, everyone loved it and asked me to make it again!
I did intend to halve the recipe and based on previous comments, I left the grits at the full amount,  and I’m glad I did.   There was big shrimp and plenty of grits and veggies to go around without anything being over powered.  
The grits were  a little runnier than I’d have liked so I may either add a little less milk  as they loosen when they bake due to the  onions tomatoes and shrimp releasing their yummy liquids into the grits.  It wasn’t Too bad, but just a bit beyond where I’d like, so I’ll try by cutting the milk by ¼ cup or so.

My husband made this, exactly to the recipe. It was amazing! We'll definitely have it again.
