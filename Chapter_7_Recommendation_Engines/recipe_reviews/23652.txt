I just won the Superbowl Ladies Bake Off at church with this recipe!  What a great pie!  Sinfully rich and easy to make.  Made recipe just as written but forgot to drizzle with chocolate. Thanks for the recipe.

This pie is great!  I made it for Easter and everyone loved it!  The only change I made was to use milk instead of half and half, because I forgot to buy it!  I will definitely make this again!

This was very good, but extremely rich.  I made a few adjustments; first of all I forgot to pick up fudge topping, so just subbed chocolate sauce & a few pieces of melted milk chocolate.  In addition, I only used 16 Snickers fun size bars.  Once I folded in the whipped topping, I also added in a few chuncks of Reese's pb cups that I had chopped up, just for texture.  I used a deep dish graham cracker pie crust and had waaaayyyy too much filling; probably could have made 2 regular sized pies.  Put the pie in the freezer for 5 hours and then swirled with chocolate sauce & topped with more chopped peanut butter cups.  Everyone at dinner said it was really, really good (even my picky mother) & that is what I was hoping for! Just make sure to remember that a little slice of this pie goes a looonnnggg way.  :)
