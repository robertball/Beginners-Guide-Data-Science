This was a wonderful shortcake recipe! I scaled to two and made mine in a large ramekin - perfect (and gorgeous) for two! The shortcake is soft, fluffy, lightly sweet and a little sticky - like a really good angel foodcake, but a little denser, I "cheated" and used whipped topping I already have but the real stuff would have been a wonderful compliment to top this one off with. So, so good!

Awesome!  I halved the cake height-wise and put it back in the pan, layering with strawberries, juice/syrup, and then the cream.  Final product was AWESOME, and was better the second day..the layers soaked up the juices and cream beautifully - I would definitely not substitute storebought whipped cream for the homemade stuff in this recipe!

This was my first time making strawberry shortcake, and this turned out great! As Allison did, I halved the cake and put it back into the pan, layered it with strawberries and syrup (from frozen) in the middle, and then topped the cake with whipped cream and fresh strawberries. It received rave reviews at my party!

Oh My Goodness!  This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I will never look for another Strawberry Shortcake recipe again.  My husband requested strawberry shortcake for his birthday, and the silly goose thought I would BUY one!  I went looking and found this recipe, and even though it was my very first time making one, it came out amazing. :)  (I am a much better cook than a baker, so I was very pleased this turned out so well.)  Mom and Dad loved it (Dad's exclamations upon seeing his piece involved the word "Shazaam!", LOL) and my hubby was bragging on me at work the next day, even showing a photo.  I followed the recipe exactly, changing nothing, and making good use of our Kitchen Aid mixer.  I used a foil pan because I didn't have the right size pan.  The cake came out sweet and firm, but wonderfully textured and Mom said she would have been happy to eat it plain!  Beginning to end, this recipe was easy and tasty, even for the rare baker like me.  We used too many strawberries the first night, so next time I might use three pounds. ;) I just can't wait to make it with in season berries!  Finally, it tasted every bit as awesome the second day. :D  Thank you for sharing, Petra, and for helping make my hubby's birthday a success!

This cake was absolutely amazing.  i have so far made it twice and both times it was an absolute success.  I am a beginner baker and i have had my share of absolute baking disasters but this cake turns out perfect every time.
I like to halve the recipe and then bake it in 2 6 inch round pans for 15-18 minutes.  It's a great dessert for a dinner or a small birthday get-together.  
definitely a great great cake and two thumbs up!!!

Baked it in 2 round dark nonstick pans for about 18 mins at 350. Did the toothpick test and they were perfectly cooked and nice and spongy on top. An VERY important step is to spray the pans with Pam Baking Spray (or use melted butter and flour), line with parchment paper and then spray it with Pam again. This will ensure that the cake slips right out after baked and looks PERFECT. I thought it'd be ok to just spray the pan when making another similar cake and it ended up a total mess! Another tip is to make sure the beater and bowl are completely clean before you start whipping the egg whites. My insertion blender stick did an amazing job of whipping them up fast. Anyway, I made the recipe exactly as listed except I added vanilla extract and extra sugar to the whipped cream. I wanted a recipe with simple ingredients for a birthday cake for my MIL and this one fit the bill. She LOVED it and was duly impressed ;) and everyone else thought it was delicious too!

This cake has a rubbery texture and very eggy flavor.  I was quite disappointed.

this came out perfectly! an angelfood-like cake crowned in delicious strawberry goodness. i doubled the recipe to make a giant cake for a birthday gathering. if you do this - use big bowls when working with those egg whites - they get huge! the only change i made to the recipe was to sub out some of the white sugar for brown when creating the strawberry sauce, and throwing a splash of balsamic vinegar in to add complexity to the sauce as well. next time, i may try adding some almond extract to the batter - i think that would take it to a whole new level. thanks petra - this is tops!

This is a very nice recipe. I did what another reviewer did...split the cake in half and put it back in the pan (with the strawberries in the middle). My sweetie has a bit of a sweet tooth so I used cream cheese frosting on top. Thanks for sharing Petra. I will make this again in the future.

Very light and not too sweet so you can enjoy the strawberry and cream flavor. I used Lemoncello with the strawberries  and it was delicious!

This is my first review ever! Petra, this was exactly the type of Strawberry Shortcake I was looking for! It was my Mothers Day dessert. Served with sliced strawberries (no sugar) and homemade whipped cream. Reduced sugar in shortcake to 1 cup. Thank you so much for sharing this outstanding recipe.

I had been searching and searching for an excellent strawberry shortcake recipe.  My mother had always made the biscuit version, which I do not care for.  Imagine my delight when I came upon a recipe that brought back memories of the sublime 'erdbeere kuchen', that I had enjoyed in Germany in the early summer.  As fresh as clover, not too sweet, so that the strawberries can truly take center stage, and often with the strawberries arranged with artful symmetry, they should rank as one of the all time great desserts.  Bless you, Petra.

This turned out surprisingly well considering I have very little experience baking sponge cake. The whites took awhile to whip, but it turned out good. Would make again.

This was easy to make.  I followed the recipe except for making the whip cream at the end and I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar in the strawberries.  I went to a Farmer's Market and the strawberries were really sweet.  The 1/2 cup gave me a lot of syrup.  The only thing I would change is the 9x13 dish.  I think it would have been fine in an 8x8 or something slightly smaller than a 9x13.  The texture and taste of the cake was great.  The hubby loved it.  The strawberries tasted great.  It was easy to make using a stand mixer.  Took very little time and effort.  The only effort I expended was that I did not flour and grease the pan enough.  The cake did stick and I used an offset spatula to release it from the pan.  With that being said, the cake did not break when I cut it horizontally and placed the bottom back in the pan. The top did not break..even when I flipped it over.  The cake was didn't even feel stiff enough to do that!! But it worked and it came out great!  Taste was great all around!

I made this for a bridal shower.  I added gelatin to the whipped cream to stabilize it. (Dissolved 1 tsp. gelatin in 1 1/2 tlb cold water for 5 minutes, then added 1 1/2 tlb boiling water, stirred into whipped cream) It was a fabulous cake

I'm not sure what we did wrong because our Shortcake was anything but tender or spongy. It was delightfully thick, almost caramelized. This was our first try but it was so good that just like 'Lil T said, I will never look for another Strawberry Shortcake recipe. We halved everything and since we only had an hour, I mashed the strawberries up. Wow!! I don't like big chunks of strawberries anyway so this was a perfect solution. Thank you Petra!

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I added almond extract to the cake and baked it in 3-8inch cake pans for about 20 minuets. I scraped the top layer of the cakes off, so that the syrup would penetrate the layers. I assembled it the night before, it was perfect. It tasted kind of like ladyfingers. Everyone loved it, I can't wait to fix it again!!!
