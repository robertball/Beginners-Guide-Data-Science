I didn't put salt or walnuts in these.  I changed the frosting to cream cheese instead of butter, and also cut the recipe for the frosting in half.  I still had too much frosting, so I took the leftover frosting and added more powdered sugar, and made Kahlua mints! The submitter must make tiny cookies, because I ended up with 2 1/2 dozen delicious cookies, not 54 like she does! Well, maybe if I had added the walnuts, I would have had more cookies! This is a great recipe!

It was like a fancy adult oreo. These were delicious on days one and two, but they dried out quickly. Definitely halve the frosting recipe unless you want loads of leftovers.
