Thank you thank you thank you for FINALLY resolving my unsatisfying stew saga.  Myself AND my husband loved this dish - he is uber picky so that is telling you something! I realize that others take issue when you review based on your own modifications but I was out of one of the main ingredients so I subbed (tomato soup).  Here is what I did - First I seasoned the heck out of the beef with salt, pepper and lemon pepper.  I used flank steak because I can not stand how fatty beef stew cubes always seem to be at my grocery store.  Then I didn't have the tomato soup so I used French onion - we are onion fanatics so this was great.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and replaced the water with beef broth.  Holy flavor town!  I left out the bay leaves because I personally can't stand them.  The steak sauce addition was so awesome - loved that ingredient!!  Until this recipe I always hated the way my stew came out - not anymore, this is a staple in our house says my husband!  I didn't have enough time so I did the crockpot on high for 6 hours - great.  THANK YOU!!!

My family enjoyed this. I only used 1/2 a package of the onion soup mix and used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup - also added some beef bouillon to the water for more flavor. We will make this again.

I tasted it at the 8 hour mark, it was bland for My taste. 1Tbs. Salt, 1 tsp. Ground Black Pepper and 1 Tbs. Dried Mexican Oregano added, and by the 10 hour mark, it had brightened up considerably. Definitely on My make again list.

I found it a bit too salty. I may omit onion mix next time. I may also double the carrots as there were not enough for my liking.
