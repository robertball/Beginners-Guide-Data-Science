INCREDIBLE!  So delicious, and the kids loved them.  I did sub vegetable oil for the olive oil and brown sugar for the white but left all other ingredients and amounts alone.  I baked them in a mini muffin tin and got 38 muffins.

This came out soooooo good! I doubled this recipe for a potluck omitted the pecans and added a maple brown sugar instant oatmeal 2-packet strussel with a little help from some more brown sugar flour and butter and made this in a 9x13 glass pan lined with parchment with a silicone mini loaf pan of batter left over. I baked these together for 45 mins and turned them around at 25 mins. Perfect!
