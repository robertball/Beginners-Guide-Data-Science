As the author wrote, these can get hard quickly.  They are difficult to eat on their own but would be nice dunked in coffee.  They have good flavor, but are really, really sweet.  Too sweet for our taste so I probably won't make them again.

These were a little bit of a challenge for me.  I made half batch of 24, one dozen by the directions and the other dozen a bit improvised.

Maybe I didn't work my dough enough, but it never really came together.  I had a lot of crumbles that I formed with a cookie scoop for the first dozen.  They were a bit bigger than the recipe called for, and smashing them with a glass didn't get them quite thin enough.  They puffed a tiny bit in the oven and spread slightly.  I left them in for 16 minutes and they never got golden on top, but I was afraid to leave them in any  longer.  The first batch actually came out a bit soft in the middle.  I don't mind a soft cookie, though; just not what I expected.

They are fragile when warm, so heed the warning about waiting to move them until they've cooled a little bit.  I did them on parchment which I can usually slide off the pan without any harm but not so with this batch.  There were a few crumbled casualties.

So for the second batch, I decided to vary the technique a bit.  I formed the rest of the dough into a log that was about 2.5" in diameter, then sliced 1/8" thick rounds from it.  That was much easier and the cookies did get brown around the edges.  They're cooling now, but I'm pretty confident that these will be crispy.  

All in all they taste good, but you may have to experiment a bit with the technique.  I would have done 3.5 stars if I could have, but will give the extra half star for taste :)
