I was working with 1 pound of asparagus, so halved the recipe.  Also, since the season is short, I only wanted asparagus, so didn't use baby greens, tomatoes, or radishes.  Because of this, I only used 1/4 C of oil & 1/8 C of vinegar.  This was the perfect amount of dressing for me.  I grated the eggs over the top instead of leaving them in larger pieces.  We loved the dressing and will definitely make it again.  Next time, I'll add green onion.
