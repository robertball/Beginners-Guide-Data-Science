I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries(because my family loves blueberries). Also, I used the Neufchatel Cheese (1/3 less fat cream cheese)as suggested in the recipe footnotes and no one could tell that I had not used regular cream cheese. Prep time was about 30 minutes and baking time was also 30 minutes.  Excellent recipe -- I will definitely make this again!

I'm giving this recipe a 4 only because it was just a bit too sweet for my liking.  Other than the too sweet jam ingrediant...these turned out sooo yummy!!! Next time, however, I will just not include the jam and just do a thick layer of whatever fruit I decide to use.  Very tastey recipe and I had no trouble with sticking! Thank you!! :)

Followed this recipe except for adding extra blueberries.  This is easy and a perfect alternative to cheesecake, especially for kids!

USE LEMON WAFERS FOR THE CRUST. I've been making this recipe for years, the only thing I have now changed is to use the lemon flavored nilla wafers, it's even more amazing than before.

I don't know where this recipe came from, but it was simple, delicious and makes you look like a "master chef"! The only thing I recommend is using homemade jam as I did. I used tripleberry jam and then added the blueberries!  Awesome!

Great recipe!  I had some blueberry jam that did not set up very well and used it in this recipe.  It worked out great!  I was so glad to still be able to use up the jam that did not turn out.  I made both steps in my food processor.  That made it a very easy recipe.

I just made these for the first time. Very easy and yummy recipe to make for a gathering. I think next time I may try them with extra blueberries (maybe slightly sweetened) and minus the jam since I thought they were almost a little too sweet. I only had frozen blueberries, but worked great. Also, think this recipe would be excellent for raspberries or strawberries.
