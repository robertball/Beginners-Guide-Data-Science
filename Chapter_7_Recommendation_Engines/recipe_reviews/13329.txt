I've made this recipe about a dozen times and I love it! The only thing I'd recommend is washing the canned beans in a colander to reduce the extra sodium in the canned juice. Otherwise the chili tastes too salty.

I'm giving this a "solid" 4 of 5 stars.  I tweaked it just a bit, using a pound of ground chuck and about 3/4 to 4/5 pound of mild italian sausage. Cut back on the salt a bit "just 'cause" and used a little stock rather than the water to give it a little "slow-cooked" flavor.  I've had it on the stove for about a 1/2 hour and it's already respectable.  I'm expecting good things with a little time for the flavors to "meld."  Will definitely keep this recipe around, especially for quick-fix chili cravings.

This chili is awesome!  My boyfriend and I have made it at least 5 times because we always get a craving for it.  I've also made it in the crock pot and it turns out very well.

This chili was FABULOUS!!!! I made a couple of changes by using a cup of dark beer instead of the water, and for one of the cans of diced tomatoes I used a can of Rotel "chili fixins" diced tomatoes. Topped with some sour cream and cheese and atop white rice this was the best!

Excellent, quick chili recipe.  I used 1 can of beef broth in place of the water, and crushed red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce, and all kidney beans since that's what was in cupboard.  Will definitely be my NEW chili recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

It was sooo good!  The best chili I have ever made.  I modified it a little, replacing beer for the water and adding a little cinnamon, cocoa powder and red ground pepper.  It was delicious!

I used this recipe as a base for the ingredients I had on hand, different tomato products and beans.  I added a can of tomato paste - as it seemed a bit soupier than I like.  A winner with the kids too!

I've made this multiple times.  I almost always made a triple batch in my stock pot and freeze portions for lunches for next week or so.  You can easily double the chili powder for more spice, or even puree a few jalapeno peppers with the tomato sauce when you add it.

This turns out great!  I tweak it a bit, though, because I think it turns out too soupy just the way it's written here.  I add 1/2 of a sweet red pepper, chopped, and 1/2 of a bell pepper (whatever color I have on hand), chopped.  I omit the water altogether.  I drain the beans a bit and use black beans instead of pinto beans for color and a stronger flavor. Instead of fresh garlic, I use 3/8 tsp. garlic powder.  I only use about 1 tsp. of sea salt.  I also use 1 tsp. red pepper flakes in place of the hot pepper sauce.  This is a great recipe for rainy weather!  Thanks. =o)

Great chili with a few modifications. I substituted the can of regular diced tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. Subtituted the pinto beans with a can of whole kernel corn. Also added a 6 oz can of "Hunt's Tomato Paste with Basil, Garlic, and Oregeno" since the original recipe was a little too soupy. This thickened it up nicely. Since I added the tomoato paste, I also added a few more shakes of chili powder (maybe an additional 3/4 tsp). I drained the kidney beans and rinsed them before adding to the pot. I used about 1/2 tbsp of salt (instead of 1 tbsp) and an overflowing tbsp (instead of 1 tbsp) of Frank's Red Hot sauce. This was the best chili I've ever had. Highly recommended.

This was really tasty!  I go to a community college for culinary classes and we had a soup practical today and we had to make chili and another soup of our choice.  I did everything to the t, except I forgot about the pinto and kidney beans.  So I split a can of cannelini beans in half since I was making minestrone as well.  My teacher gave me a 93 saying it was thick, chunky, rich and meaty.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  I think I'll use this recipe forever!

Good chili, except it was a little too sweet.  Against my better judgement, I added the 2 TBS of sugar.  It would have been better with about 2 tsp of sugar.  I served it over Flamin' Hot Fritos, then put a scoop of mac n cheese on top with a dollop of sour cream.  OMG it was GOOD.  The Flamin' Hot Fritos took some of the sweet away.  I also only used 1 can of beans, cause real Texans don't put beans in their chili and I'm still a Texan at heart!!  I will use this recipe again and again for quick chili, but with less sugar.

Very good chili.  I usually don't review recipes when I mess with the ingredients, but my changes to this one were minimal.  I omitted the 8 oz. can of sauce and instead added a 14.5 oz. can of stewed.  My 3 cans of diced tomatoes were Fire Roasted, w/ green chilis, and w/ green pepper onion and celery.  I couldn't see using an Italian style tomato in a chili recipe...but I'm sure it would have turned out fine anyway.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. ground beef because that's all I had and I seasoned to taste, rather than with exact amounts.  It turned out very well, though mine is probably a bit more watery than if I would have used the 8 oz. of tomato sauce.  I cooked this on low for about an hour and a half to cook the tomatoes down.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe! Served with Mexican cornbread. I used 28 oz. of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel instead. I also halved the hot sauce so my 2 year old could eat it.

This chili is absolutely delicious.  We had to substitute a can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce, but we didn't change anything else.  We will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe, Pam!

I changed it a little from what I had on hand. I used 2 cans of diced tomato, 1 (4oz) can chopped green chili's, omited the water and added a can of chili beans. Eveything else was the same as recipe. It was really good

I was not altogether impressed with this recipe. Admittedly, I altered it a bit to fit the ingredients that I had, but the alterations were minimal. I left out the hot pepper sauce, substituted garlic powder for the minced garlic, and used Mexican style stewed tomatoes instead of Italian-style since that was what I had available to me. When I first tasted it, it was a little too sweet, so I added a splash of white vinegar to balance it a bit. That helped, but when all was said and done, there was still some flavor present that made it taste a little odd. Others who ate it said they thought it tasted fine, but I wasn't satisfied with it and ended up getting rid of the leftovers because I knew I wouldn't eat it.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was pretty good.  My boyfriend (a Texan) and I both enjoyed it, and it truly did get better every day.  The second time, I only made one change- added some bacon (about 5 slices) and substituted some of the beef for mild italian sausage.  This time, it turned out very soupy, I had to cook it way longer than suggested to thicken the sauce.  And it was so incredibly spicy that I took one tiny taste and my mouth was burning the rest of the night!  I tried to dilute the spice by adding a little sugar, and some flour to thicken it up and battle the spice, but by the time I added enough brown sugar and flour to make the spice bearable and get the right consistency, it had become too sweet.  I'm not sure if it was because I used a different brand of hot pepper sauce that was too overpowering, or if using the sausage instead of beef was too much.  I'll probably start looking for a different chili recipe, because although it was very good the first time I made it, the second time I was pretty disappointed.  Too soupy, too many tomatoes (I prefer beefier chili to chili that's heavy on veggies), and too spicy.

Tip:  I fried the bacon in a sautee pan, and removed the bacon but left the grease in the pan.  Then I sautted the onion and garlic in the bacon grease, instead of in with the beef.  This gave the onion and garlic and AMAZING flavor, I almost wanted to eat them plain instead of adding them to the chili!

This was VERY EASY to make.  I am not a fan of cooking so this was great for me.  The only thing that I would change would be the amount of salt; maybe only use half of what is called for; it was way to salty for my taste.  Other than that, it was delicious!

I've used this recipe for two years. It is delicious. Way Easy. The only tweak I've made is I use red beans, in place of kidney and pinto beans.

This was a decent chili, but it didn't wow me. I made it exactly as written. The "hot pepper sauce" I used was original Tabasco Sauce. I did notice an inconsistency with one ingredient: "Italian-style diced tomatoes" (e.g., tomatoes with a few herbs) in the ingredient list, became "diced tomatoes with chili peppers" (e.g., Ro-Tel). I used the former. Also, it didn't say whether to rinse and/or drain the beans, so I didn't. The chili came out a little soupy to my taste, and the sugar added a sweetness not often seen in chili. It was nice enough, and I ate it all over about 4 days, but it just didn't stand out among chilis I've tried.

My family had this last night, and everyone loved it!  It's quick and easy to make.  We topped it with grated cheese and chrushed some chips on top.  It has a great flavor.  I was surprised my kids would like it with all the tomatoes in the recipe, but they really add a lot of flavor.  I was also very surprised we had any left over, but the leftovers won't last for long!

This was wonderful chili and it will definitely be made again in this house.  I made just a few changes but I think it would have been fine as it is.  I used beef broth in place of the water, i didn't add the cumin because i didn't have any, i used 2 cans of each of the beans and I added a small can of green chiles.  It was SO delicious.  If it is better the second day I can't imagine how good it is going to be tomorrow.  Thanks Pam.

This is one fantastic chili.  I have made it several times and I am never dissappointed.  The thing is that I added a little extra garlic.

Really quick and tastes better than a lot of chili recipes that take forever. I always serve my chili over rice, and my husband's over sweet cornbread, with sour cream and cheddar cheese on top.

AWESOME!! I was told this was "outstanding". I only made a few minor adjustments - only used half the beans and I used diced tomatoes with chili flavoring rather than Italian seasoning. I also let it simmer for about 2 hours rather than 30 min. Thanks for this awesome, easy, chili!!!!!

I have a picky husband, and a 9 year old daughter who hates chili and both of them loved this chili! Our whole family loved it! My daughter asked me to make it again!  I tried to stick to the original recipe but didn't have everything on hand so I had to make some changes; I used cubed chicken breast instead of ground beef, only about 1/2 of a red onion instead of 1 onion, replaced the Italian-style diced tomatoes with diced tomatoes with roasted red peppers, and a can of black beans replaced the pinto (I really need to go shopping!).  I also left out the salt and really did not miss it. I left out the black pepper cause I don't really like it.  Everything else I did according to the recipe. It was so very yummy!!!

Delicious.  Fastest, easiest chili.  I used the full T of cumin and about 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 T. Chili powder.  Hot pepper sauce for your own bowl as desired.  Served with yogurt or sour cream, chopped green pepper and onion and shredded cheddar.

Very fast recipe to put together and it tasted great.  I made a few changes, such as adding dried oregano, hot paprika and a pinch of cayenne.  I omitted the salt - WAY too much sodium. I used a bottle of beer instead of the water, and let it simmer for 30 minutes before adding the beans (plus some chopped green pepper).  I let it simmer another 30 minutes, and served it with grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream on top.

This was one of the best chilis I have ever made. I turned this into chili mac and we raved over this simple but delicious dish. I scaled this down to half, used ground chuck and cooked the onion and garlic right in as I browned the beef. I had to use what I had on hand but this recipe is so versatile that it still turned out so tasty. I used Texas sweet onion, Del Fuerte mexican tomato sauce, half a can of roma tomato paste instead of Italian style diced tomatoes, a can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can of Bush's chili beans, a splash of white vinegar,a hefty pinch of cocoa powder, and replaced the water with beef broth because I had it open in the fridge. I forgot to add the hot pepper sauce, but that may have been a plus considering hubs no longer has his cast iron stomach.

Best chili I've had in a LONG time!  I halved the recipe and it seems overly beefy for my taste - next time I will still cut it in half but keep both cans of beans.  Subbed cayenne for hot sauce and tomato paste for tomato sauce (didn't have any).  Cut the water back to 2T to avoid soupiness (putting it into bread bowls) - perfecto!

Very good.  I used ground turkey (dieting) and maybe half the salt.  I left out the hot sauce because I'm a wimp with spices.  It was great.  The hubby who loves heat, added hot sauce to his bowl at the end.  I liked the hint of the sweetness.  Highly recommend the recipe.

EXCELLENT QUICK AND EASY.  WHEN YOU DRAIN THE MEAT USE THAT TO SAUTE THE GARLIC AND ONIONS. I DRAINED THE KIDNEY BEANS AND PINTO BEANS BEFORE ADDING TO THE POT.  DRAIN THE TOMATOES TOO BUT SAVE IT INCASE THE CHILLI GETS TO THICK THEN YOU CAN ADD SOME OF THE DRAINED TOMATO INSTEAD OF JUST WATER.  FANTASTIC, SIMPLE, QUICK RECIPE AND IT TASTES GREAT.  IT WAS NOT A HIT...IT WAS A HOME RUN.

Great standard recipe. I have been making this with fake veggie meat (yves mexican flavored, it's 3/4 pound per pack) and have been using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce since as some people said, it's too liquidy. I don't have this problem with the paste. Also I found that if you put the beans in undrained, then don't add salt, it's too much.

We loved how quick & easy this recipe was, the only problem was the sweetness. In our opinions chili should not be sweet.  We kept saying over and over again this is so good EXECPT for the sugar. We've made it muplitple times since then only without the sugar..... YUM!!!

I've made this twice now and it is VERY good.  Quick and easy with fantastic results.  I was somewhat confused with the ingredient list: it calls for 2 cans of Italian-style diced tomatoes, but then the directions refer to tomatoes with chili peppers.  I used 3 cans regular diced tomatoes (undrained) and then one 4oz. can (drained) diced chilies.  I also used all kidney beans and reduced the salt to 2 tsp. and the hot pepper sauce to 1 tsp. (I'm a weakling when it comes to spice)
Delicious!

This recipe is great in taste as well as simplicity.  I would recommend using the diced tomatoes with no salt added because I didn't and somehow it turned out too salty for us, I think 1 tablespoon of salt might be too much.  I will try to cut down next time now that I know what to expect.  You can always add salt but it is extremely difficult to reduce it once its in it.   I did increase the pepper sauce due to personal preference and added a little more cumin, chili powder and a small dash of oregano.

This is my husband's favorite chili recipe.  I made very slight changes which are: Instead of Italian-style diced tomatoes, I use Chili-style diced tomatoes (usually find this at WalMart).  I use 2 cups of water instead of 1.  I increase the chili powder & ground cumin by 1 teaspoon each. Instead of simmering on the stove, I put everything in the crockpot and cook on low heat for 6 - 8 hours.  Makes the house smell wonderful and the flavors have that "next day" taste which I love from soups, stews & chili.

This was an excellent recipe. We omitted the hot sauce because children we eating too, but it was awesome with AND without! We made a couple of 'errors' with too little ground beef, too many beans...but it was fantastic besides the chefs mistakes...lol

This is a fabulous recipe for chili!  Not only is it quick, it's also easy.  I do, however add 2 cans of kidney and 2 cans of pinto beans.  Rinse them well.  Add also a green pepper to the onions when cooking.  Gives a little more "meaty-ness" to it.     Also, to give it a little more smoky flavor, I do my ground beef on our charcoal grill.  Just adds the little something to the flavor.  All in all, I'd say amazing recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This chili recipe was very tasty...the best I've tried.  I substituted 1 lb ground beef and 1 large leftover prime rib (cubed), halved the amount of onion, left out the hot sauce (for my daughter's sake), and used 1 C dark beer instead of water.  I also let it simmer uncovered for about 2 hours as it seemed a little watered down.  The next time I make this recipe, I'll add one can of black beens in addition to the kidneys and pintos that the recipe calls for.

I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who likes a hearty, classic-falvored chili.

My husband requests this chili all the time and it's an easy go-to when sports are on or if we have unexpected company.  I usually try to have most the items on hand but it can be altered very easily and still be great!  I've made it with ground beef,  ground turkey, and chicken breast.  Sometimes I add just a tad more heat (hot sauce) depending on the company.  It's also great to freeze in freezer bags for individual servings.  My Marine son had it when he was home on leave last year and raved about it.  He's a picky eater so I consider it a winning recipe!

I LOVE this chili!  Very quick and easy to make, and the flavor is great...I do add a bit more hot pepper sauce (I use Frank's Red Hot) because my husband and I like spicy food.  I also add a few packets of Taco Bell mild sauce (my grandmother's "secret" chili ingredient haha)

Loved this chili! It was very easy and cheap to make. I used 4 fresh tomatoes and 1 can because I didn't have tomato sauce or canned tomatoes, it was a perfect ratio. I think the fresh tomatoes add to the texture too. I added just a little flour in the meat (like a roux) to thicken it up. Delicious!

Excellent. Substituted Beer for the Water. Cooked longer with lid off to cook down some of the liquid and make it thickier. Family ate all of it.

Such a great chili receipe!  Easy to follow and tastes delicious!  

I thought it was a little soupier than I would've liked, next time I'll lessen the water or add some tomato paste.  Also, I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce and made mine pretty spicy.  Great sunday football watching meal!

What a simple recipe! I made it exactly as listed with the exception of adding some green pepper and omitting the hot pepper sauce as my husband and I don't particularly like spicy chili. I made this for a party we threw recently and it was a big hit with everyone there! This was the first chili recipe I had ever attempted and we just love it.

GREAT way to make quick chili! I substitute chicken broth for water and add a few extra spices such as chili powder and chipotle and double the cumin and pepper and hot sauce - pretty much throw in whatever spices smell like they will taste good in the chili. I've also made it with turkey instead of beef and it was TASTY!! Have made this stuff quite a few times this year and everyone is always requesting seconds...and thirds.

this was an easy quick chili. i doubled the recipe except for the meat and sugar and i didnt have italian style diced tomatoes so i used regular diced and added a teaspoon of italian seasoning which i dont think made much of a flavor difference. this was good and i have a big container to freeze for later in the fall. thanks.

This is the first time I've made chili and I think I did a pretty good job thanks to this recipe!  I couldn't find the Italian-Style tomatoes so I used the Zesty Chili Style and just didn't add water.   This is really good considering how quick and easy it is.  Thank you!

This is my go-to recipe anytime we need chili.  To add more color and crunch, I add one chopped green bell pepper and one cup of frozen corn.  We love this served with a nice piece of corn bread.

GREAT recipe.  Super easy- throw it together an hour before dinnertime and it's ready to go.  Tastes as good as some of those 'all-day' chili's I've been a slave to the kitchen for.  Dress it up as you like- add a little extra kick with some cheyanne pepper, or make a little 'fixin's' bar for company with cheese, chips, green onions, sour cream and jalapenos.  Well liked by all.

Very Very easy and hearty. I leave out most of the water to make it thicker, and use 2 cans of kidney beans. You can make it hot or mild - great w/ sour cream and cheese!

This recipe is easy to work with. We didn't need eight servings. I made some adjustments.(one pound ground beef,two cans diced tomato,(one chili ready,one regular).Reduced the spices based on the recipe portions.Used one onion and three garlic cloves.For the water,kept it at one cup,but used 1/2 water and 1/2 beer. Added green peppers and corn. Can't wait to make the full recipe next time.

If you need a quick chili, use this one. This was the best ground beef chili I ever made or ate. I don't usually like chili made with ground beef - never considered it the real thing! This is quick and flavorful. Ignore the review that says it's terrible! I'm throwing out all my other quick chili recipes and only going with this one.

Can't go wrong with this chili!  Easy to make, even for a college student!  I've made it on several different occasions, and it is always a huge hit.  It even won a taste test between four other chili's at a friend's chili event.  It's great without any changes or subs, but it's very easy to change to suit your personal taste as well.  I like a sweeter chili, so I add ketchup.  For the crowd that likes it spicy, I substitute cans of Rotel for one can of tomatoes.  There's really no way that this chili can taste bad!

I thought it was delicious! Thank you. After I made it I transfered it to a crockpot and brought it to a baseball consession stand and everyone loved it! As someone else said, it was even better the next day! Thanks again!

This is excellent! I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, one small can of tomato paste and one small can of tomato sauce and I omitted the chili powder because I have little ones. It turned out excellent. This is a super easy, delicious meal.

Turned out well, but with some alterations:  I used a slowcooker, and let it cook a good 20 hours.  This allowed it to thicken up.  I used hard cider in place of the water and added a few sprinkles of ground cloves.  Next time I'll use only kidney beans, I like the firmer texture of the kidney beans more than the pintos.  Also I'll use tomato paste rather than sauce to help with the overall consistency.  Still I give this chili excellent marks for the blend of flavors, not too spicy, just sweet enough.

This is a great basic chili recipe. Sometimes I use half ground turkey and half ground beef. I also add diced red and green bell pepper. I use the petite-cut canned tomatoes because I don't like big chunks of tomatoes. I start with half the amount of chili powder because some family members can't handle the spice. I serve it with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese on the side. Yummy!

In the first chili cook-off 11/04, my husband won with this recipe, but subbed dark beer for water. I made Fusion Chili (Can you figure Quick Chili I beats out the more creative Fusion Chili?)
In next chili-cookoff, husband stood by Quick Chili 1, But I tried Chili II by Cathie, adding fresh chilantro and bit more chili powder and about 2 TBL cumin. I won.

I don't know why any one says that the recipe is too watery or sweet. I've never had that problem. My husband and I just love this chili. He would eat it every single day if he had the chance.

Very good chili recipe.  It's easy to adjust to your own taste by leaving out the hot pepper sauce (or adding if you like it hot).  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 teaspoon. I will definitely be making again. Thanks!

A+++++ I have made this twice and it is awesome.  Both times I put it in my crock pot in the morning and we had it for supper that night.  Even though I put it in the crock pot I still browned and drained the meat first.  The first time I made it there was a very slight sweet taste to it.  It wasn't bad but we are just not used to a sweet taste in our chili so the next time I left out the sugar and it was perfect.  This chili is not spicy so it is perfect for the kids, we adults add cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to our bowls to spice it up a little more.  The only other thing I did was adding flour to make it a little thicker.  I took out a cup of the broth and mixed it with flour to make a paste and let it simmer.  We will be making this often.

Best chili recipe. I get asked to make this for every BBQ with friends. Fan favorite with everyone! I don't add the extra water, I like it more chunky for dipping with tortilla scoop chips. Also, I drain the water from the bean cans. I don't add about half of the sugar and salt that it says in the recipe. Will be making it for every occasion from now on.

This was a good recipe. I did however make some changes (as I always do).  I added a pound more of ground beef then required (I was feeding a group) and towards the end I cook see the chili looking more soupy than desired so I made a roux (three tablespoons of butter and like 4-5 tablespoons of flour) and slowly whisked it in the chili.  It turned out great and will make again.

Coming across a decent chili really is not all that hard. However, sharing your creation with 30+ friends and not one of them saying the've had better or it reminds them of their momma...THAT IS AMAZING. I have been making this recipe for years and it has never ever disappointed, in fact it is requested.

This was my first time making chili from scratch so I was very excited to try this recipe. I didn't have canned beans so I precooked dry beans I already had on hand and it came out great! I am sure I'll be making this forever!

My serving size was 4 - so I added some chopped bell pepper to the onion when sauteing, used one can each drained of red kidney and black beans, used two cans tomatoes (one stewed, one diced) and skipped tomato sauce, added some BBQ 3001 sauce - next time I might put beef broth in place of the water for a little more flavor depth.  Absolutely delicious.  Served with cornbread, roasted taters and a salad.

Not really a traditional chili. I did make a few minor changes. First, beef doesn't really sit well with me so I substituted chicken breast. Then, because I was out of beans I used some noodles that I had in the cabinet. Also, I'm not big on chili powder or hot sauce, so I skipped those. I was out of tomatoes so I used some chicken stock instead. Onions give me bad breath so I used celery and carrots. I didn't have any cumin but I did have the salt and pepper. It wasn't what I think of as a traditional Texas style chili, but still, very good. I gave it 5 stars!

I followed this recipe almost exactly - I just left out the hot sauce since there are several children in my family who are sensitive to spiciness. It was very easy to make and very tasty. Even the sweetness from the sugar came through just right.

I doubled the recipe and it was delicious!  We made two pots of chili plus cornbread, and we substituted some brown sugar in for the white sugar.  We also added black and white beans, as well as some sweet orange and yellow peppers.  We also used sriracha hot sauce for the hot pepper sauce.  It was wonderful!

**MODIFICATIONS**
Awesome- subbed 6 oz of IPA and 2 oz of water instead of 8oz of water. Used 1.25 lbs of 96% fat free beef and added 16 oz of chicken sausage. Used reduced salt canned beans and tomatoes. ADDED 1tsp of liquid smoke and 4 slices of GOOD thick cut Applewood Smoked bacon slices precooked and crumbled into beef/onion mixture. PICKY, PICKY Kids LOVED it!

Amazing! I only had 1 lb ground chuck so I just added extra beans to compensate.  I didn't have kidney beans either so I just used all pinto beans (a 40oz can plus a 15oz can) but I drained out the liquid from the beans (reserving it) and then added in the amount needed for the right consistancy.  I used Kosher salt. This was the best chile I've ever made (per the family). The flavor is fabulous!  Nice and spicy (just how I like it!!)

I made this recipe and my family loved it!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and used ground turkey instead of the ground beef, and Cannolini beans instead of the Pinto beans, and it was delicious!  I took the tip of another reviewer and rinsed the beans to remove the added salt, and all was great.  Spooned it over brown rice and threw a sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese on top, and at it up - yum!

I added the Red Gold brand Sloppy Joe Original Sauce 1 can 15.oz,Brooks mild chili beans in chili sauce 1.lb can,1 pound of hamburger meat. From another viewer's advice. And 1 cinnamon stick & I had no cocoa powder so I added a couple of shakes of instant Dark Chocolate Sensation Swiss Miss packet.  But over all that's what I added and it turned out great. Mine is so mild I did change the serving size down to 4 servings & put it in [a slow cooker or Crock Pot for 3-4 hours on low.]Then I'll add cheese to each bowl & I know it's weird but we like chili w/ plain spaghetti or elbow macaroni.add little butter on top pour the chili over and don't for get the crackers. Now that's a meal. I know when I make chili we can eat this for at least 3 days. So it will change to be a topping on hot dogs, no pasta. So it's chili dogs w/ cheese. So thank You Pam Smith for your   Unique Chunky Chili.

very easy and very tastee, but changes to recipe i've made, add more peeper, and maybe salt, also added one bay leaf, added some chopped sweet basil, i left out the hot pepper sauce and added some red peeper flakes instead but be sparing because it will be hot with the addition of a cajun spice such as tony chaceres or zatarins spice, and remember to drain the liquid from the all the canned beans or it will be too watery, and simmer it at very low heat for little longer than 30min,

Made it as it was called for, noticed an omission or an error in the ingredients.  It calls for Italian style diced tomatoes but in the directions it mentioned te diced tomatoes with peppers.  I had a can of green chili peppers so I added those.  It turned out really good!  Next time I will buy the diced tomatoes with peppers instead of the Italian-style.

Delicious chili! I didn't have cumin so I left that out. I also pureed the tomatoes as we don't like big chunks of tomato. After tasting, I thought it tasted too sweet so I added one more tablespoon of chili powder and it was just perfect. First time we ate the entire pot of chili! Thanks!

Quick Chili I Haiku: "Nearly gave it 5, a great chili, and yes, quick, but not quite awesome." I followed the recipe, except after browning the beef, garlic, and onion, I put everything in my crockpot on low while I went to work. Oh and I only had 1 lb. of meat, so I halved the recipe, and used just kidney beans. (Not a big fan of pintos anyways.) Nothing bad to report on - it was a very nice, tasty chili, but not earth-shatteringly good. I would make it again, but would consider adding, Idk, beer instead of water, or chipotle peppers, or something else to give it a special nudge.

Made some slight changes based on availability of ingredients - sub louisiana hot sauce, chili beans for pinto beans, whole canned plum tomatoes.  Good taste, moderate spice level (can adjust as desired) and fab with corn muffins.  Bravo!

Truly wonderful chili recipe! Made a few changes though...
Added 1/2lb of mild Italian sausage, chopped up cilantro with my onion to add to meat while browning, used reg. diced tomatoes bc thats all we had on hand and added 2 tablespoons of a local made chipotle seasoning I bought at the county fair awhile back that was supposed to be used in making a dip, but worked great with the chili!! Also used chili beans vs. what what suggested again bc thats what we had in the cabinet. Will make this again and again!

I made this recipe as is with the hot sauce on the side.  It was a good basic recipe. great flavor but kinda thin and runny for my liking. I will probably use thisrecipe again buttry to have it come out thicker.

This is excellent chili.  I did need to adjust the seasonings to my taste, mostly by adding more.  Instead of hot pepper sauce I used ground ancho and chipotle peppers.  2 Tbs sugar would be too much in my opinion, I omitted it this time but I usually add a tiny bit with any tomatoey dish.  Used two onions.  Even with that I thought the balance of beef:tomato:beans was perfect.  Even though it is fine after 30 minutes I added extra liquid and let it cook longer to make it even better.

Amazing recipe!  The best chili we've had.  It will definitely be one of our staple meals.  We changed it up a bit - 1 large can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added 1 can of tomato paste for thickness, added 2 jalapeños for kick, used beef broth instead of water, and a dash of cinnamon.  Perfect!

surprisingly the chili at my university dormitory was the best chili I've tasted, but this recipe is pretty darn good. my husband absolutely loved it. I personally didn't like the Italian style tomatoes, too chunky for me, but otherwise it was good.

This was amazing! I tweaked it a bit, adding two packets of El Paso Chili seasoning instead of the spices listed, some Italian seasoning, and a bunch of chopped celery. Other then that, I stuck right to the recipe. And what a fantastic recipe! I will definitely be using this to make chili again and again.

We had this for dinner last night and we really enjoyed it. I halved the recipe, which wasn't the easiest thing to do since it meant I had to split up the tomatoes and the tomato sauce. I hesitated over adding the water, ended up doing it, and had to use some cornstarch to thicken it up. Other than that though, it was fantastic, easy, and we'll be adding it to our dinner rotation!

I have never made chili before 1. because I don't like it and 2. because my husband always raves about his own. But I wanted to try to make him some to see what he thought.    I used 2 1/2 lbs of ground chuck instead of 2.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and used 3 TBLS of the tabasco sauce, I used two cans of kidney beans instead of 1 each of the kidney and pinto beans and I left out the sugar.  I also added a half of a green pepper and a half of a red bell pepper.  He absoltely loved this chili, he says its better than his own and that says a lot for this recipe.  I have a hard time making things like this for him because again I don't like it and I won't taste it so I have no idea what good chili tastes like.  But thank you for the recipe it was great and will definetely make it again for him.

Oh this one is a good recipe... I tweaked a little bit:  Added two stalks chopped celery and 1 chopped green pepper, replaced 1 can of diced tomatoes with a can of tomato paste, added a bay leaf, added two cubes beef bouillon and added masa harina (3 tbl) to thicken chili.  Was really comforting on a cold fall day!

Good and easy with most ingredients right in the pantry. I used ancho powder instead of chili powder. Also beer as other suggested instead of water.

Excellent! Used ground venison instead of beef; cayenne powder instead of hot sauce; and diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of 1 can regular. Fabulous! Served with cheese and oyster crackers.

This was a very good recipe for chili. Some said it was too hot but others thought it great. As you can see it was a big hit for the Super bowl.

I used 1 lb. ground sausage and 1 lb. of beef, instead of 2 lbs. of beef.  I also did not use pinto beans cause I didn't have them. This chili is even better the next day.

This is a fantastic receipe.  Made it for a Christmas party and it was the hit of the party.  A 5 yr old girl told me it was the best chili she ever had!  Thanks for the suggestion about the dark beer, nice sweet contrast to the chili powder bit.

This is the chili to make if you are short on time ! Very flavoraful.
 I used 2 28ozs crushed tomatoes with puree instead of the diced tomatoes and the tomato paste and it turned out great, it was thick without the individual tomato chunks ( my kids don't care for the chunks )
I also added red & orange bell pepper puree ( leftover peppers that I sauteed with onions than pureed it ) for extra flavor and vegetables. My kids didn't know the peppers were in there so they ate it up ! 
It turned out Delicious !

I thought this chili was very good.  I was a little suprised by the italian taste (which I guess I shouldn't have been because of the seasoning).  

It was also very chunky, which me and my husband liked.  Next time I think I'll omit the sugar because it was a bit too sweet for my tastes.

This is such a great comfort meal!  I barely have to dirty any dishes and the flavor is just great.  I like my chili spicy so I even put a little extra black pepper and hot sauce in!  I usually don't use a full 2 pounds of meat, the beans are a nice filler.

I found this chili a little spicy for my liking (but then again, my boyfriend adored it), and I used a little less meat and added a can of baked beans. It turned out super tasty and was also enjoyed by my roommates. Next time I would down the chili powder JUST a little.

Next time I will use 2 cans of Kidney beans or I will rinse the can of Pinto beans. When I opened the can of pinto beans and added them I noticed they had a real  salty  smell to them. I did not like the taste the first day but the 2nd day it was good. I will try again

This exceeded my expectations! I used home canned tomatoes (not Italian) that were pretty watery so I didn't add the extra water. I used all kidney beans and omitted the cumin. This is great for watching the football games today! Thank you.

Fantastic!  I made this chili the other night and it turned out great.  My husband loved it!  I couldn't find canned pinto beans in my local grocery store, so I used two cans of kidney beans...and for the hot sauce, I used a teaspoon and a half of the West Indies pepper sauce that we brought back from our honeymoon (very hot!).  I took some of the chili to my dad and he raved about it.  I will definitely make this chili again!!

great quick dinner! We don't care for tomatoes in chunk form so I exchanged the can of stewed tomatoes for more tomato sauce and used chicken broth instead of water. I like to use ground turkey as well. Top with a blob of sour cream and cheese. YUM! Thank you Pam.

My favorite chili recipe.  Easy to follow.  I cut down the sugar to 1 tablespoon, and add 3 cans of beans - whatever I have on hand: kidney, black, navy.  Always add a can of corn for some color.  We usually serve over rice with some crusty bread

This was the first time I ever made Chili and it was delicious!  I did add some smoked paprika and used 1 lb ground beef for chili and 1 lb chuck roast that I cut into small bite size pieces.   I browned the chuck roast pieces after the ground beef through in the fat to add flavor then took all the meat and tossed the browned fat.  I saved the juice from the browned chuck roast and added it with the other ingredients.   So good!

I used crushed tomatoes as I did not have any diced tomatoes. I added 1-4oz. Can of hot peppers and 1-4 oz. can of mild peppers, and 1/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper. I followed the remainder of the recipe and cooking instructions. 
EXCELLENT Chili!!!

Absolutely wonderful! I made two pots because 2 of us in the family are vegetarians. One pot was made with real beef and the other pot with plant based “non”beef. I subbed the real beef for Morningstar crumbles in the veggie pot and it was fabulous! Will be enjoying this recipe again and again.

I cut down on the chili powder because sometimes I find it overpowers a dish. This chili was amazing! I took it to a block party & it was the first chili to disappear!! It's a keeper!!

This chili came out great! I do not eat meat so instead I used meatless mexican crumbles. The crumbles mimic the ground beef well and are seasoned. I still used the same amount of seasoning called for this recipe and also added fresh diced jalapeno just before simmering for 30 mins. I was worried it was going to be over seasoned but not the case at all. Also, I used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1 cup. I prefer my chili to be a thicker consistency since all the cans of tomatoes are already In their own broth to begin with. I made Vegetarian Sweet Poato Chili Cheese Fries. Topped the fries with shredded pepperjack, chili, more pepperjack, red onion, green onion, cilantro and avocado. It was amazing. Tweaked the recipe quite a bit but either way it was a great recipe. Super easy and quick. I'd definitely reccomend this recipe.

Very easy recipe to make and delicious as is. But when i made it again  I did tweak it a little.  I used both equal amounts of Hamburger and Pork sausage (a lb each), i also used a can of stewed tomatoes with jalapenos, can of tomato sauce, can of El Pato tomato sauce(spicy),
i have also used a can of whole peeled tomatoes and kind of broke them apart while cooking, 
instead of water i used chicken broth, used 3 beans; cantinella, pinto and kidney.  I also threw in a Jalapeno for added spice, and used the spices as the original recipe shows. (the sugar really helps the recipe) 
This is the version i make all the time now.
So easy and simple and i get so many compliments for this chili.  I highly recommend!!

This was probably by-far the easiest chili recipe I’ve ever made, and it turned out delicious! I was going to replace the water it calls for with bone broth but totally forgot to. Still super yummy.

First attempt - pretty good as chili mac on spaghetti. Look forward to adjusting. Was happy to have a recipe that didn't require a green bell pepper - which I always forget to buy!

My modifications: 

1 - Sliced the onions, didn't dice them.

2 - Used 1 lb ground sirloin and 1 lb all-purpose "80% lean ground beef" from the meat case.

3 - Took the advice of another AllRecipeep and rinsed the beans in a colander to reduce the salt. 

Grated cheddar and diced fresh onions on top.

It's GREAT. The only thing I miss (and the only reason for 4 stars not 5) from the place where I get addictive chili is actual stew-like chunks of meat. I might try that next time.

I am vegan so I didn’t add the ground beef but rather added white chili beans, black chili beans a can of corn and 2 cups of cauliflower crumbles for “meat”. No water, and I added 2 tsp of tapioca starch. Amazing!

Love it! I've made it at least a dozen times. It's so simple, yet so delicious. The only change I make is I leave out the sugar. Not a huge fan of sweet sauce. Besides that you'll have an awesome bowl of chili in less than an hour.

Probably my favorite among all the chilis I have made.  I followed the ingredient list and directions as written (perhaps I used a bit more garlic, and chili pinto beans rather than plain) and I'm saving this one. Not difficult, just delish. Now I need to find an equally good chunky chili recipe.

I have made this recipe more than once! It tastes great and my kids love it. We also add sour cream, cheese and chives to make it better. We may have cornbread or cheese toast to complete the meal and sometimes fried Chicken wings ;).....

I made this recipe because was craving some chili but didn’t have the instant “chili” seasoning that I usually buy. I’m pretty impressed how it turned out. I did omitted water because used some water from pinto beans, omitted the tomato with chili because didn’t have any, use only half can of tomato sauce, used 4oz of ketchup, pinto beans instead of kidney beans and used some pepper mild hot sause. I think next will use my cast iron pan to cook this, Yummerz??

I'm 58 years old, cook every day of my life,  and have made many different chili recipes over the years.  This is a very good chili recipe.  Just made it last week and it was so good that I am making it again tonight!  Made it exactly as the recipe called for.  Did not change anything!

Excellent chili recipe. The only change I make is to use beer (usually a lager) instead of water.

Gave 5 stars for the base seasonings.  I made pinto beans from scratch in the crockpot adding 1 cup water and  a 1/2 carton of chicken broth I had in hand and a can of petite diced tomatoes. That sat on high for about 5 hours. Then I fried a pound and a half of ground beef  with a half an onion and 1 tsp of fresh garlic. I used 2 tbsp chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp of salt & 1tsp pepper as called for un the recipe. I also added 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp paprika and a small can of tomato paste. When cooked and mixed I tossed in the crock pot along with 2 tbsp cornstarch slurry to thicken. Perfect with the honey cornbread!

Delicious, but next time I’ll add less salt. I like salt and even for me it was too salty. I added two minced carrots in place of the sugar, one chopped green bell pepper because I like that flavor in my chili and I drained the canned beans before adding. I’ll definitely make this chili again!

I stuck pretty close to the recipe, cutting down on the spice because my grandkids and my mother-in-law were eating with us.   I then added corn and mushrooms to the recipe and was very pleased with the results!  It was definitely an easy recipe to prepare was quick. We were eating in no time and I received many compliments on it.  I will definitely be doing this recipe again, fairly soon.

I've made this recipe many times.  It's quick, easy & delicious.  I tweak it.  I use Rotel's Chili Fixin diced tomatoes & green chilis instead of the original.  I don't use the cup of water &, instead, I use either beef broth or extra tomato sauce depending what's on hand.  I also add Mexican oregano, chipolte chili powder & paprika.

I used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce, and tomatoes and a jalapeño instead of the tomato/green chile can mix, and just a tad more sugar, but this is definitely a staple dish for me now. Paired with a GF cornbread, this is one of the best dishes I’ve had in a long time. Thanks for sharing!

We used 1 can (14.5 oz) green chili diced tomatoes and 2 cans plain diced tomatoes.  Rinse canned beans before adding to recipe.  We used 1/4-1/2 tsp ground red pepper  (to taste) instead of using chili powder.  Did not use hot pepper sauce.  We loved it and so did our grandfather.  It is a blessing to find things that he likes to eat.

I used 2 20 oz cans of chopped tomatoes, couldn't find any with chopped peppers.

It went together very easy, I let it sit in the slow cooker overnight and it was ready for the potluck lunch.

Exceptional recipe! I did change it up a bit, but nothing drastic. I used 1-28oz can of crushed tomatoes (instead of 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes);  1 can of Rotel tomatoes w/ habaneros (instead of the 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes); and 4oz of tomato sauce (instead of 8oz). I've made this several times and it is a BIG hit with family, as well as guests.

Will definitely be recorded into my recipe book.  This is the 2nd time I have made it.  First time was good, but this time is even better somehow.  Last time I followed the instructions more to a T and this time there were a couple changes so I will let you know the differences: I used 2 med/large tomatoes (seeded) instead of canned, and we added half a hot green pepper (chopped), the amount that we figured would have been mixed in the canned tomatoes.  We felt some of the water content was lost through using fresh tomatoes, so we added maybe 3/4 cup water to the one cup that's already called for.  Also, while I browned the meat, I was measuring the spices into a bowl, and without thinking I sprinkled almost a full tablespoon of cumin straight into the browning meat!  I think this ended up being part of the key to amazing chili, along with fresh veggies just being so much better.  But there's one more difference.  After done cooking, we felt the beans weren't soft enough, which was probably due to a lot of wind coming through our open doors, which kept stifling the flame on our gas stove.  So we cooked then on low for 25 mins, then turned up to med-low, cooking for 5 mins.  It is the most amazing chili we have made.  Thanks!

I adjusted it a little .. I used half the sugar and because my family doesn’t tolerate heat to well I didn’t add any heat but it came out very flavorful ...i served it over white rice and a corn muffin on the side ...I will definitely be making this again.

I make this over and over again. I personally love the bean to tomato ratio but if you omitted one can of tomatoes, it'll still come out good. It's so simple and the end result is hearty and warm. Goes perfect with honey cornbread or saltine crackers. Great the next day too.

I used 1lb ground beef and 1 lb ground Italian sausage, doubled and rinsed the beans, and omitted the sugar. Added 1/2 a sweet red bell pepper, chopped and also omitted the water. Husband and I loved it. Very quick and easy compared to my  favorite recipe.

I do change quite a bit in this recipe, but the basics are the same and my family LOVES it! Here are my changes: Replace 2 lbs ground beef with equal amount of venison (stew meat or ground), replace onion with onion powder (we do this b/c my DH is allergic to fresh onion), replace 2 cans of tomatoes with chili peppers with 2 cans diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning, replace all beans with black beans (rinsed), replace hot pepper sauce with 1-2 chipotle pepper(s) - ground, replace white sugar with coconut sugar (for lower glycemic impact). I omit salt, pepper, and water unless needed for taste and consistency.

So quick and easy! I reduced the number of servings to fit our needs, used V-8 Juice instead of the tomato sauce so I reduced the water a wee bit.  This will be a favorite now!

The family loved it. I made a few adjustments. I used broth instead of water & added a small can of tomato paste. I like a thicker chili base, the recipe was a little soupy for me. I probably will not add as much sugar, maybe cut it in half next time. You could taste it right off the bat. This recipe is a keeper!

My brother hates beef, but loves chili. So I had to go on a hunt for a recipe that would be versatile enough to substitute one for the other, and low and behold, this one is a winner! 


Now of course because I use chicken I have to cook it first and use my Kitchen aid to shred it while I saute the veggies. 


I mostly follow the recipe, with a few tweaks suggested by other reviewers and a few of my own.  Nothing big though. I rinse the beans. I substitute chicken.


The biggest change I dare do to this awesome recipe is adding some spices in order to give the chili a deeper flavor, like it's been cooking longer. 


I add about a tablespoon of cocoa powder, I substitute coffee for the water, and I add about a teaspoon of cinnamon. 


And my picky brother loves it. Requests it about once a week, which is fine with me.

Good base for chili. I added more seasoning based on preference and use 2 cans black beans. Half cup beer and half beef broth instead of water. Added a little cocoa and cinnamon as well as cayenne. I make it a lot. It is a bit liquidy ao i cook rice and add it in when both are close to done. Or i serve it with fresh bread, both work well.

I made this for a community function in our neighborhood. The pot I served it in was scraped clean. I did use 1 lb  ground beef and 1 lb sausage and added a can of seasoned white beans. I also used 1 cup of beef broth instead of water. I left out the salt and the sugar. I thought it was yummy.

I had everything in the pantry except the Pinto Beans so I substituted Black Beans. Just as tasty . I am planning to make again and use Pinto Beans next time just because I want to  make the complete recipe.

Made in my Ninja, I cooked the ground beef, onions, and garlic all in the pot, strain some of the grease. I used beef broth instead of water and 1 8oz can tomato paste instead of tomato sauce (I like my chili thicker) and I just use regular diced tomatoes. Let simmer for a few hours and omg SOOOOOO yummy.

Excellent Recipe,   Made a few slight changes but excellent.  Instead of water I added 1 cup of dark beer, used 1tsp of sriracha sauce, along with a 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.

I used pork blade steak. Browned it, chopped it, and added it to the onions and garlic. My kids, mother in law, and hubby loved this! For the hot pepper sauce, I used siracha the first time and pepper plant the second time. Siracha was almost too hot for the kiddos.

I've made this probably 18 times. Which turned out great.  But after the 3nd time.  I would think about making this chile after I'd make steak or BBQ the night before. So I would use the ground beef and use whatever meat I cooked the night before.  Each time it makes it my own with all of the familiar flavors.

I followed this recipe until I was ready to add the spices and re-read the measurements for the spices.  Perhaps the cook who provided this recipe accidentally wrote down tablespoon when they intended to write teaspoon.  I only used 1 teaspoon of salt instead of the 1 tablespoon of salt that the recipe calls for.  1 tsp. of salt was more than enough and I can only imagine what it must taste like if 1 tablespoon of salt was in the recipe.  It's my understanding that recipes that have hearts are healthy.  I wouldn't consider this a healthy recipe because of the extra salt and the sugar which is not needed or healthy..

Good and fast. Sugar unnecessary, just add a little extra cumin and paprika when cooking the meat, and a more generous amount of hot sauce at the end.

This is a great recipe and is very forgiving! The chili was a huge hit and will be my go-to recipe from now on. :-)

I wound up having to use a few substitutions to accommodate what I had on-hand in my pantry and it still turned out great. 1) I didn't have tomato sauce, so I subbed with a can of plain diced tomatoes. 2) We aren't big kidney bean fans, so I subbed with a can of chili beans. 3) I had 1/2 of a green bell pepper in the fridge, so I diced and sautéed it with the onions. 4) I also wound up simmering the chili for two hours, instead of the listed 30 minutes (because my bf was running late) and it was still delicious. 5) I may even throw in some frozen corn the next time I make this recipe. I think the texture and sweetness of the corn would pair well with this recipe's flavor profile.

Started off by making this exactly as recipe states.  Lacked depth of flavor.  Ended up adding 1 diced green pepper, 8oz diced green chiles, added 1/2# of browned ground sausage with half another white onion, teaspoon cayenne, 1 more can of dark kidney beans, another 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 dark lager.  Much better but original recipe is good as a starter recipe.

Made the mistake of adding the tablespoon of salt.  Way too salty! I think it was supposed to be 1 tsp. Skip the salt!

Very quick and easy. I added a little extra chili powder for a tad bit more heat. The family loved it served with grated cheese on top and a side of corn bread.

Excellent! I followed the recipe, adding only some extra beans: black and chili. The sauce in the chili beans accounted for the extra fiber and kept the chili thick but still soupy - perfect for bread or crackers. I only had one pound of beef, so the extra beans were my substitute. Great seasoning level, perfect to adapt to individual preferences. I use low sodium beans when available and drained the beans that weren't in a sauce. I think that helped the saltiness or wateriness I see other reviewers mentioned. Making this again tonight!

This is a quick, yet very flavorful chili! The only change I made was to substitute meatless "beef" crumbles For the ground beef. Yes, I plan to make it again.

I think this recipe is a great one and super easy. I've made it 4 times now and I've tried different bean combos to see which one I like best. You can add more or less of anything to suit your own taste but the ingredients are spot on for my family. We love it! The weather was somewhat inclement yesterday and I decided today was chili day. Thank you again Pam!

Didn't have the right amount of meat or chili powder, accidently put too much tomato sauce, used black beans with my kidney and pinto beans, pulled out a bunch for my vegan daughter before adding my meat, and it still turned out great. I used Tapatio hot sauce and crushed tomatoes with basil. Basically, I butchered the recipe and it still worked.

We all loved this chili last night. My wife and daughter (yes, I'm a guy that cooks) don't like hot food. This chili was perfect with just enough kick to have a really good flavor. I left off the hot pepper sauce and used a couple of tablespoons of crushed red pepper instead, and used one can of Hunts diced chili ready tomatoes instead of one can of  plain diced. I also used all no salt added cans to make the salt content more realistic. We will be making this again.

Excellent Chili!! I did make a few minor changes though. I sprinkled in cinnamon, cocoa powder, and used 1/2 a red pepper with the onion. Served it with honey cornbread and sour cream. Yum!

Delicious! It did come out too soupy, so I added some flour and a beat egg white, and it thickened right up! Also, the only beans I had were black beans so I did two cans of those, no other kinds of beans. Turned out great, even my 6 year old ate it!

I make this chili recipe all the time.  It's quick, it's easy and it's delicious!  Except for browning the meat and onions, it's basically opening cans and dumping in the pot.  It makes a lot also.  I separate into 1 cup containers and have for lunch during the week or freeze.  This is my "go to" chili recipe.  Just top with a little cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream and enjoy.  Thank you!

Here is what I would do:

Make sure you add the syrup in the beans ( I didn't and there wasn't enough liquid)

And I would add a can of garbanzo beans. There didn't seem to be enough beans. Otherwise it's excellent!

Loved this easy  weeknight recipe!  The only changes I made were using all kidney beans (I didn't have any pinto beans) and I substituted chipotle powder for the hot sauce. My chili-hating family thought it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

The only change I made was to use the Rotel brand diced tomatoes with chiles. . Wasn't sure the recipe meant 'Italian " style. My 20 year old liked it a lot and said it was medium spicy. He likes it hotter.

I've made this chili recipe several times, and my kids and husband and I love it! The only difference I made is that I fry the garlic, onion and ground beef, and then add it, plus everything else to my crockpot, plus an extra half cup of water and a few extra shakes of tapatio, and set it on high for 5 hours. The flavors mix and mingle with each other so much better when it sit in the crockpot all day. Amazing recipe!

We love this recipe! The only adjustment is that we only use 1 tsp salt.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday & it was a hit! I had a nacho bar set-up with nacho cheese, guacamole, sour cream, green onions/tomatoes/olives/jalapeños/ all chopped, shredded cheese. I noticed everyone pretty much made loaded nachos w/ all the ingredients. I left out hot sauce in the chili beans since the kiddies were going to have some. I did use a 'not' real ground beef option and my meat eating friends did not notice. I have made this recipe  since & friends/fam ask for the recipe :)

This recipe saved the day! The chili that took so long to make burned, just 45 minutes before our Super Bowl Party began. I had time to go to the grocery store and to get this simmering before the guests arrived.

This is the best chili recipe for a quick dinner or football game!  This is very mild, so it is great for kids.  Add a few dashes of hot sauce to make it spicier!  Definitely rinse the beans before you dump them in.  My while family uses this recipe!!

4 stars since I tweaked, used 1 can of beef broth instead of water, packet of chili powder and omitted the can of tomato sauce.  simple, basic, good chili- great for cold days.

Customized with a splash each of red wine & sherry vinegars with brown mustard. I used garlic powder instead of minced cloves this time and flavor was definitely more subtle but worked just fine.

This was a quick, easy, and delicious chili. My family and I loved it! I didn't change anything, but I did add a can of corn (per my 11-year-old son's request) and a half cup of chopped bell pepper. This made the chili even more colorful and hearty. Perfect for a cold winter night.

Fantastic! Instead of hot sauce I got a can of the spicest chili I could find to add a little more depth and heat and it was some of the best chili I've ever had!

This chili is indeed quick but doesn't skimp on flavor at all! I ended up using fresh tomatoes because that is all I had (peeled and chopped) and added a little more garlic. During the last 5 minutes of cooking, I had 2 tsps. liquid smoke and that knocked the already delicious flavor of the chili out of the park! We topped our bowls with cheese, cilantro, and avocado slices. Will definitely be making this again!

I've made this several times--I use 1 lb. each of ground beef and ground turkey and add one more can of beans. I used a three-bean mixture (kidney, pinto, and black).

This is pretty good for being a quick chili. I've made several changes though and it has made a big difference. I use low sodium tomatoes and beans. I omit the water and sugar, neither are needed and the sugar makes it sweet. I don't like a lot of cumin so I only use 1/2 tablespoon and I add an extra clove of garlic. Lastly, after adding all the seasoning I bring to a boil then reduce the heat to low and let the chili simmer for about 3 hours. This makes for an easy chili that isn't too bad.

Super simple. Super good. Used a can of Brooks hot chili beans and a can of pintos and like many others, subbed a can of beer for the water. Added a can of tomato paste because I like my chili tomatoey. Definitely making again, at least doubling the recipe next time. Servings say 8 but I'd say 6, and even more like 3-4 if you're feeding folks with really hearty appetites.

I've made it as directed and it was great. Then I've made it with dried beans, replaced the meat with bulgur and a bit more liquid, replaced the liquid with veg or chicken broth. I use rotel for two of the cans of tomatoes. I'll use whatever tomatoes I have on hand. This is an easy to modify recipe perfect for weeknight.

I used ground deer meat, added extra chili powder and used himalayan pink salt. Instead of the Italian style tomatoes, I did two cans of original diced tomatoes with green chilis, added an extra garlic clove, and fresh picked green onion (two large stalks). I added a teaspoon of worstecire sauce, a touch of cinnamon, red pepper flakes, and used two cans of red kidney beans.  It turned out really good and my house smells delicious! Hot rice, crackers, topped with cheese and a few slivers of green onion!

I deviated from the recipe a bit. I never added the Italian tomatoes, instead I just added more diced tomatoes. I added more Cumin and Chili Powder than requested. I also added more meat. I used GOYA SOFRITO to season the meat which was also tomato based and just gave it more flavor. In the end I wish I had made more because it turned out so good. Chili is even better the next day. Oh and I did not get rid of the grease from the meat I actually let it mix in with everything.

I'm relatively new to cooking and found this so easy to make! Made it for my boyfriend and parents who loved it. I changed it to ground turkey and also added some green and red peppers, took out the pinto beans. Will make again and double the recipe to freeze!

So easy to make and just delicious. Added 2 teaspoons of oregano, a chicken bullion cube, and 2 tablespoons of cayenne (though if you're not into spice I'd recommend only one).   Also used the "chili ready" beans instead of plain.  Topped it with some shredded cheddar and everyone loved it.  Great fall recipe!

Great for a quick chili dinner. My family doesn't care for a large amount of tomato pieces or beans, so I used one can  (14.5 oz) of fire roasted diced tomatos,  23oz of tomato sauce and one can of chili beans. I was crunched for time, so I also used  about 2TBS minced onion rather than fresh.  I added more cumin, about 1 1/2 TBS and less sugar. About 1 TBS sugar. I also added less water... About 3/4 C. I used Frank's  Red Hot sauce for spice. Thanks for the tasty and quick recipe!

Turned out pretty well! I'm not a huge tomato fan, so I left the tomatoes out. Rinsed the beans. Added one can tomato paste. Substituted vegetable broth for water. Added extra vegetable broth (approx 1 cup?). Added a pinch of cayenne pepper. Left out Tabasco. It's a little spicy for the littles. May try 1-1 1 /2 tbsp chili powder next time.

This is a great quick chili recipe.  I substituted one pound of sweet Italian sausage for one of the pounds of ground beef, used beef broth instead of the water, and added 1/4 cup of Mazetta Tamed Jalapenos (diced).  It was very good!  I will definitely make it again as winter is coming!

This recipe turned out great.  I did omit the hot pepper sauce, but added one jalapeno.

A year or so ago, I searched for a quick chili recipe because my then-fiance was craving chili. Found this beauty and have made it multiple times since then. My now-husband just asked for it again tonight. Lol.

I've tweaked this minimally. I always make this without the pinto beans, and use chili beans instead. I'll do one kidney, one chili, and one black. I also add a green bell pepper for some extra flavor, throwing it in with the bulk of the ingredients in the second half, after the beef and onions. The recipe calls for 2lbs of ground beef but I usually put in 2.5-3lbs for some extra meatiness, some extra weight to it. Also. Butter. To get that extra richness, either throw a stick of butter in at the end, or put a tablespoon of it in the bowl when you serve. Heaven.

I didn't add the kidney beans and I used 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes. I also used original Rotel. I love this chili! My family loved it also! I only substituted because it was what I had on hand.

This recipe was amazing and amazingly easy!  I did a few tweeks. I didn't have Italian style tomotoes(and my husband hates oregano anyway) so I used one can of rotel tomatoes and an additional can of diced tomatoes (along with the tomatoes the recipe calls for). I salt and pepper my hamburger when frying it, so next time I will back off of the salt. I used beef broth in lieu of water. This chili is the perfect blend of sweet heat. I will definitely make this again!  I've won two chili cook offs in the past and I think I will enter this recipe in our cook off, it's that good!

Great recipe for someone who doesn't plan well for 2 hour prep dinners. I'm not a fan of spice so I left the hot pepper sauce out.  Super easy and really tasty! Also feeds a good amount of people.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I backed off the spices a little bit just because I was fixing it for kids, but they ate it up.  It  had great flavor.  Definitely a chili I will make again.  Might try it with the beef broth next time.  But it's great to have it ready in about 45 minutes.

AWESOME!!!!! ...and  am not that crazy about chili!  The problem is that I like a little sweetness that I haven't found in most of the chili recipes or dishes that I have tried,  so I rarely eat it. (It doesn't seem to work to just add sugar to any recipe.)  Chili textures also vary so much that I don't generally care for it, but when the weather is very cold like it is now, chili is what want.  When I saw that this recipe added sugar and seemed to quick and easy and that the reviews were great, I had to try it. I was not disappointed. The flavor, sweetness and texture were just the way I like it. I was out of tomato and pepper sauce, so I replaced them with tomato paste and a few pepper flakes. I also used chicken broth instead of water.

Delicious. I usually make with ground beef and use either black beans & pinto, or just one or the other. I also don't really measure the spices, but just add whatever seems right when I'm cooking it. So far, no complaints! :)

This recipe is great!! Being the mom of 4 I need fast and easy. And this is one of the few that gets a thumbs up from EVERYONE....not easy. I do this one in the crockpot after I brown the beef, and I usually let it go on low for the day. (about 4-6 hours) and the flavors  mix beautifully.  Instead of pinto we like black beans. And I add a can of sweet corn to it.  With fresh warm corn bread you can never go wrong with this recipe.

Love, love this recipe! I first cook fresh pinto beans in a crock pot. I substitute them for the kidney beans as well, since my kids didn't like them.  Instead of water I use the water from the beans.  I also leave out the hot pepper sauce.

Fantastic recipe!  I wanted it thicker, so I let it simmer for much longer than 30 minutes, and it turned out perfect. I only used 1.5 tbsp chili powder, substituted a watermelon wheat beer for the water and sriracha for the hot pepper sauce.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  This made an awesome not-too-spicy chili, easily spiced up more per bowl with some extra hot sauce of your choice.

This recipe was fantastic.  The TBL of hot sauce wasn't quite enough so added more (overdid it a bit so added a little more sugar).  Next time wll try the beef broth in place of the water as suggested by some members.   This was great paired with the Mexican cornbread recipe. Yummers!!

This recipe was such a great starter recipe thank you! I don't make chili often because I really just, don't know how. I'm not a chili person, but my husband is. He liked this one a lot! I took other reviewers' advice and used one pound ground beef and one pound ground pork. I added a bit less salt than the recipe said as well. I also made mine beanless because I hate beans. I put a little wine in it that I had in the fridge, plopped a little sour cream on top, sprinkled it with shredded cheese and served with homemade corn bread and oyster crackers. It was very very good! My husband said he was so full he was sleepy hahaha! I used all of the canned ingredients in this recipe which really is not something I'd normally do, so I can't wait to try this recipe with completely fresh ingredients. I bet it'll be absolutely amazing! Thanks again for sharing :)

This recipe is not bad at all...for a quick chili this is what I will be using from now on. I used reduced sodium beans and did not drain them. Perfect amount of saltiness...didn't need to add any.

Great chili recipe. Easy to follow and quite flavorful. I did adjust the recipe to accommodate 3 lbs of meat so we could have left overs. Since I have a little one, I did not put the hot sauce in it. I also just added 1 tbs of sugar instead of 2 and salted to taste since I am salt sensitive. Neat thing about chili like this, it tastes even better the next day!

Awesome taste! It was a little bit too watery for me. But that could've been because I didn't strain the beans...

I love this, it's really easy and comes together quickly. I tend to keep frozen cooked ground beef in the freezer which makes this very quick.  I used diced tomatoes with green chiles which makes it so much better.  I use chicken broth instead of water if I have it, and 1/2 the chili powder so the kids will eat it. Love it!

Family loved it. I left out the can of plain diced tomatoes. Used chili beans instead of the pinto. A can of beef broth instead of the water. And I didn't add any salt. I also let it simmer for 1.5 hours. Easy and yummy. :)

I have never been very good at making chili... I've tried many recipes and even those little packet things you get at the grocery store, but they never work out.  This one, however, was perfect!  I love that Italian-style tomatoes are used instead of plain or chili-ready.  I made this for my Young Adult Group at church and they DEVOURED it.  I adjusted the recipe to 20 servings and between the 11 people that came that night, they cleaned me out.

A few things I changed- the chili was thin already after I put the tomatoes in, so I drained the beans and rinsed them well and I did NOT put any water in at all.  I also did not put any hot sauce in because I didn't know how spicy people liked their chili, and I found the chili powder gave it enough of a kick without having to add extra.  Also, instead of two cans of plain diced tomatoes, I used one can plain and one can of tomatoes with onions and green peppers simply because that's what I had in the pantry.  I loved it!  Even my mom, the chili snob, gave it two thumbs up. :-)

hubby and i loved this! the only thing i did differently was I used 2 cans of kidney beans instead of 1, did not use the pinto beans. I used crushed tomatoes instead diced and omitted the tomato sauce. Turned out brilliant! I also made homemade beer bread to go with it! PERFECT for that cold night! :)

Very easy & quick.  Made this because I had chili on my menu and did not have the mix on hand that I usually use.  I didn't want to go BACK to the grocery store!  Modified for things I had on hand - RoTel, soybeans instead of pintos, garlic powder & onion powder in place of fresh ones.  My husband liked it better than the mix, so I think we will be switching to this recipe!

We love this recipe. Quick, easy, slightly spicy and a little bit of sweet. We've made it many times and tried different variations to our tastes now, but really you don't need to change a thing! (i don't like kidney beans so I sub chili beans for both pinto and kidney to make it easy). Sometimes we'll add a diced red pepper. Play with it however you want! Great base recipe.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I did differently was that I put in some chilli flakes instead of hot sauce because I didn't have any on hand. I also threw in a red bell pepper and mushrooms for some extra veggies and rinsed my canned beans. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is great!  I think there is a typo in the ingredients, the diced tomatoes should be diced with chili peppers.  I did add chopped celery, and simmered longer!  It was a hit!

I adored this recipe and received lots of rave reviews for it. I omitted the water and in stead used a large container of vegetable juice instead. I also used a 40 oz. can of kidney beans and two 15 oz. cans of the pinto beans. I also omitted the hot sauce as I am not a fan of overly spicy things. Also, I browned the meat along with the onion and garlic and then added everything to my crockpot and cooked it on high for about three hours.  I can't wait to make this chili again, its now my go to chili recipe.

Best chili ever!!! I did make a few changes: I only used on pound of ground beef, substituted a can of this rotel spicy tomato sauce for the tomato sauce and hot pepper sauce and then used Italian seasoning and diced tomatoes for the italian style tomatoes. I usually hate it when people change the recipe so much and then write a review on it, but this is just so good that you should know about it. It won first prize in a chili cook-off. Amazing!

Pretty good, not the best, but for the time involved in preparing, not too shabby. I made this in a rushed effort to get dinner on the table and wasn't expecting too much, I'm really surprised it had as much flavor as it did. We enjoyed it and ate all the leftovers, thanks!

Excellent Chili!  I tripled the recipe for a big party I was having and it turned out great.  The only thing that I did differently was use all kidney beans instead of 1/2 kidney 1/2 pinto.  The store I went to didn't have pinto beans!  I think the cumin adds excellent flavour to this chili.

Wonderful!  I have tried a few different chili recipes, and so far this beats the others by a mile! Plus its super easy. I like to add some beer (about 1/2 can) to it; I think beer gives chili a great flavor when cooked together.

Really great recipe, I made it while camping and it was perfect.  I chopped everything up in advance and mixed the spices in tupperware so it was a breeze making it on the camp stove.  I just omitted the sugar and hot sauce, and added a green pepper.  We brought a bottle of hot sauce and everyone made it as spicy as they wanted.  Yummy!

My husband and I love this recipe. I've made it about 5 times already and even people at my job love it.  They ask me constantly when i'm going to make it again.  If you find it too watery just let it boil a little longer.  The only thing is I didn't use the sugar, it still came out perfect.  Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the best chili I have ever made.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I substituted chicken broth for the water.  It was slightly watery until it cooled, and I put it in the crock pot the next day with a perfect chili consistency.  I served it at a football party, and everyone raved about it.  My mother-in-law who says she normally doesn't like chili tried a bowl and loved it.  She quickly accepted my offer to send her home with some.  Super recipe!

My whole family loved this one. I will make again but I will leave out the sugar, makes it too sweet.

Very good recipe.  Quick and easy.  Great for after a long day of work.  I noticed that some of the other reviews said that it was a little watery.  To make it a little thicker I added 1/2 cup ground up tortilla chips.  I ground them in my food processor could also be done in a blender or a plastic bag and a rolling pin.  Great recipe.

Loved it, but a little thin. I think you should use tomato paste instead of sauce.  Also, I added a dash of cinnamon to cut the chili powder and crushed tomato for smaller tomato chunks. Will definitely use again!

I have made this recipe several times and my family loves it.  I have varied the beans and used left over meatloaf once.  Definitly a Do Again recipe at my house.

OK, it was "just chili" and I don't see what all the excitement is about.  There was also some flavor in it that I did not prefer, but could not place my finger on what it was, or possibly a combination of flavors?  EDIT:  Just made this again.  I still don't see this as a great chili (there's definitely better), but I liked it better this time around.  This time I only faintly noticed whatever it was that I didn't like in it.  I thought perhaps it was too much hot sauce, but I noticed another more recent reviewer said they too thought there was something that made it a little odd and had not put the hot sauce in.  So I'm still baffled.
