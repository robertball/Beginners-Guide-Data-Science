I give this 5 stars only because of my addition.  I have made this before, and not been impressed with it.  But I added 1 drained can of Rotel Original (tomatoes and chilies.  It added just the "kick" this recipe needs!  My husband and I pratically inhaled it, it was so good!  Hahahaha

I had a very similar recipe years ago that I lost.  I was excited to find this one again because the family always liked it so much.  This recipe is simple and quick.  
I did make a few changes.  Left out the tomatoes, no one likes them at our house.  I also added a couple of teaspoons of prepared mustard to the topping.  My old recipe had it, and I thought it added a little extra.

My family loved this, but I did make some changes to the recipe.  I used a can of tomatoes/chiles as suggested by another cook, and added some hot sauce and chili powder to the meat mixture.  I also added 1/2 can of corn to the meat.  For the topping, I used a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix, prepared according to the directions on the box, and added the other 1/2 can of corn to this.  I sprinkled some extra cheese on top, and baked.  The sweetness of the cornbread topping really complemented the slightly spicy meat, and my whole family loved it.  It was a winner!

This was a very popular dinner in my house last night! The only change I made was using a can of drained, diced Italian style tomatoes mixed into the ground beef/onion mixture instead of using a fresh sliced tomato. I also added a little crumbled bacon on top, with the cheese, to make it Bacon CheeseBurger Pie. People wanted seconds and so I'm adding this one to my recipe collection.

Flavorless, no spice or zing to it at all. Me and mr friend, upon serving up dinner, instantly started thinking of things to do to improve this - NEVER a good sign.

* I'd stir the spices into the meat.  

* Use Mexican Oregano instead of just standard Oregano.

* Either increase the Bisquick power by half again or cut the milk. The topping was *WAY* too runny.

And that was just off the top of my head.

This was tasty and easy to make.  I used regular bisquick as I couldn't find buttermilk, and it was fine.  I think I'll also add Worcestershire sauce next time.

The first time I made this recipe, my husband said, " Oh wow!  Is that a quiche?".  It is so easy to make!  The second time I made it I added French's Fried Onions.  It made a wonderful addition!!  I have also altered the recipe for a change with some ham and broccoli.  It is a nice base recipe for lots of other ideas!

I love these impossible pies. They're so easy and fairly quick to get into the oven. We're not spice loving people so we thoroughly enjoyed this! I booboo'ed and put the Bisquick mix in before the cheese. The cheese wound up going on last but it turned out great!

Excellent cheeseburger pie.  Takes a little longer than the traditional Bisquick recipe but it's worth it.  The oregano and the tomatoes (thin slices worked great) are a nice departure from the standard recipe.  The tomatoes definitely help keep the pie moist.  My teen boys and their friends love it.  I'll have to start making a double batch from now on.

I use a recipe very much like this, but found if I decrease the milk by half, I get a much fluffier casserole.  Very easy and very yummy!

I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and cut back the milk a bit and added a drained can tomatoes and green chilis instead of the sliced tomato.  I also doubled the garlic salt and halved the pepper.  Skipped the oregano altogether. We LOVED it! It was easy and delicious!  I'll definitely make this again.

This was really fast and easy to make, but everyone in the family thought it was just ok, even with rotel. I probably will not make it again.

I'm not sure if the measurements are off or what, but 1 teaspoon of pepper made it almost impossible to eat, and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt made it incredibly bland.  Maybe the two should have been reversed???

This dish was just okay.  It kinda reminded me of a breakfast dish.  It had more of a egg taste to it than what I was hoping for.  I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

I liked this recipe but only because I followed 2 different reviews suggestions. Instead of using sliced tomato on top,I took a can of diced tomato with chiles( drained) and mixed it in to the beef right at the end of browning it. I also reduced the amount of milk by half and used bisquick. Instead of oregano I used italian seasoning because thats what I had on hand.

Im sorry, but i wasnt very pleased with this recipe.  (Look at all the people who reviewed this favorably - most addded or changed at least a couple things about the recipe)  I made this to a "T", exactly as written, and it was just way too bland.... 3 stars for easiness, 1 star for taste, hence the 2 star rating!!

Very quick and easy recipe which, just like a regular cheeseburger, everyone has their own way to dress up! For our family, we love mushrooms, so I included them in the mixture of meat and onions. I poured in a can of drained diced tomatoes. I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce that gave it a nice kick and saved it from tasting too bland. My 3 guys inhaled it so next time I'll double it in a 9 x 13 pan so we have some leftovers!

Like many others, I thought the recipe needed more.  I seasoned my meat, added more garlic, used less pepper than called for, used drained canned tomatoes (diced).  I have my own homemade "Bisquick" that I used on top.  Yet, I still found this on the bland side and didn't like it enough to make it again.  I would have rated it 2+1/2, but couldn't.  Just didn't wow us.

I use to make Betty Crocker's impossibly easy cheeseburger pie. I found this and decided to make changes for when my kids aren't around (they like the original). I used mushrooms instead of tomatoes and used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar! Yummy!!!

Added italian seasoning and a zucchini, teaspoon of ginger in place of the black pepper. No tomato  or pepper as we are nightshade free. Tripled the egg mix, used flour instead of bisquick. Only one 12oz sleeve of meat, but added 12 oz of mixed veggies. I had shredded colby jack, so I used it. 2 onions. The fam really liked it. A good recipe to use up leftovers with. I love it with mushrooms instead of meat for a veggie night in the winter.

I actually really liked it! I'm new to cooking so I loved how simple it was. My boyfriend and I both loved it! I used ground oregano instead of oregano leaves and it was a little too strong but it seems like a simple fix. :)

Fast, easy & good! It's no big deal to spice it up a notch with whatever you like best. The next time I make this, I will try a few of the other reviewers suggestions. Maybe tomatoes with chilies, more spices, a little frozen corn, a few black beans and maybe even try the cornbread topping. This is a great recipe when you really aren't in the mood for spending a lot of time in the kitchen ... just serve a little salad on the side.

OK, let me get right to the point. This was not what I was expecting AT ALL! Having said this, my neighbor and husband didn't find this to be as awful as I did (I think their expectations differed from mine). As many reviewers suggest, the batter is quite runny. I think that's where this went terribly wrong for me. Even after baking for the suggested 25 minutes, my pie was not cooked thru. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until it had set for 10 minutes and I cut the first piece. :( The top tested done, but the batter that seeped thru the meat layer was gooey (yuck!). Another 15 minutes in the oven did NOTHING to solve the problem! Maybe this is characteristic of an "impossible" pie, but it was completely off-putting IMO. Hopefully this will work for you, but it was a total disappointment for me. Thanks anyways, Herald.

My family likes spice and full flavored foods.  I added Worcestershire Sauce and a little bbq sauce to the ground beef.  I also didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I substituted half the cheese with Mozzarella.  It came out very good.

We all liked this...  I made my own baking mix with help from SunnyByrd :)  I used American cheese and it was very cheesy and delicious!  We like a bit of spice in food so I added a dash of cayenne pepper to the beef. I would probably add more baking mix or less milk next time since the topping was a bit thin and didn't give as much breading as I would have liked.  Good!

great! NOTE TO NON-AMERICAN-EATERS:  this does NOT taste like some can-inspired casserole.  as long as you spice it up!  i added sliced hot peppers (cooked with the beef), reduced the beef, added some olive oil, added some finely chopped garlic, added canned peas, added asparagus (turned out too thready/hard to cut), added salt, added red pepper spice, added a small package of crushed red pepper (would not do this in the future). i also wish that the crust was on the bottom as well as top... next time i'll consider pouring some on the bottom first, or maybe just mixing it with the meat sauce... next time i'll also try to make it more healthy using mozerella cheese instead of cheddar slices.

I have to give it 5 stars because my husband liked it so much. I used Jiffy corn muffin mix instead of the bisquick, but I would have liked it to seep down in the mixture a little more. The meat seemed to need a little extra kick. Next time I'll play around with the recipe some more.

This was good. It's not the type of meal that I would make for company coming over. I was making cupcakes for a party at the same time. It's the "I need to make something good yet easy and quick for dinner" type of recipe. I used a ripe garden tomato instead of the italian diced tomatos like I planned and that turned out very well. The baking mix topping while mixing it together did seem awfully thin to me so I just kept adding handfuls till it was a nice thickish consistancy. My husband said it tasted like a cheeseburger on a biscuit, it does definitly dress up the popular "off the box" recipe! All in all it was a good dinner and I'll definitly be having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!

I gave this five stars because it is exactly what it says-- impossible easy.  Add to that the fact that my extremely finicky five-year old loved it, and you have a five-star recipe in my book.  It is not gourmet fare by any means, but it does make a good weeknight main dish.  I used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato and added bacon pieces.  Everyone was happy at my house!

This was okay...I jazzed the meat mixture up by adding a few splashes of hot sauce and a few shakes of creole seasoning, seasoning salt and extra garlic salt.  I had some leftover canned corn which I also added on top of the meat mixture.  I put in the recommended amount of oregano which seemed like too much - a half teaspoon would probably have been better.

This was delicious.  I made some alterations though.  I omitted the tomato, oregano and garlic and used garlic powder, after the hamburger was cooked and drained, I added a can of tomato soup.  I also baked the bottom of a pie shell in the oven for 10 minutes, then added the hamburger mixture, ect.... This was delicious...served it with  potatoe pancakes and some veggies...Hubby loved it!

This was interesting...Like a cross between a quiche and a meatloaf. Put some ketchup on it and it's wonderful. I will make it again. Followed the recipe to a T except I used buttermilk pancake mix. I doubt it's much different, though.

I first saw this recipe about 3 years ago and made it for my 6 year old as something quick and different.  Fast forward to now and not only does my (now) 9 year old love it, but my husband does too!  A breeze to make and nutritious!

I followed the recipe and was disappointed with the results. It was bland. I thought with the seasonings it would be more flavorful. I couldn't even finish it.

I needed to feed a larger crowd so I  multiplied the ingredients by 1 1/2.   I added some taco seasoning in the hamburger, and I added a half can of nacho cheese soup. That really helped with the flavor.  My son ate a large portion really liked it.

I have made this so many times as is.  Its good.  This time I added a bunch of sautéed mushrooms with pinch of thyme and instead of biscuit mix I added 1/3 cup flour mixed with 1 tsp baking powder and 2 table spoons olive oil.  It was a huge hit with my family.  Will definitely make it that way again.

I added shredded squash, green pepper, carrots, worcestershire sauce, drained canned diced tomatoes, diced green chiles, and colby jack cheese. I doubled the "crust" recipe (with half the milk) and adjusted the seasonings (1t garlic powder, 1/2t pepper). Delicious!

I used a can of tomatoes with green chilis instead of fresh tomatoes as suggested.  Also added some pickle chips, mustard and ketchup before dumping the biscuit mix on.  Very good.

Not enough flavor at all and I took recommendations of adding mustard, ketchup and worcestshire sauce.  Like another reviewer said, way too runny and the topping was just not the right texture.

I didnt have any bisquick so I used cornbread mix instead (mixed up as mix directions said) and I added to the meat mixture 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can minced chilies, and 1 tsp hot sauce. I followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients.  The cornbread mix didnt go to the bottom as the bisquick would have, but it was good anyway.

I give this 5 stars for being a quick, easy, I've-got-all-the-ingredients kind of meal.  My 8 yr. old son LOVES it.  I would suggest adding the seasonings to the meat BEFORE placing it in the pan so that all of the meat gets seasoned and it doesn't just sit on top (and of course, season to taste--whatever you normally put into burgers).  Also, I took a cue from our local pizza parlor's cheeseburger pizza and I put mustard on top of the meat mixture, then placed hamburger dill slices all over it before sprinkling on the cheese.  Not bad for a quickie, kid-satisfying meal!

I made some similar changes to those suggested by other users.  I added a can of rotel as well as some cumin, chili powder and all seasoning.  The meat mixture was pretty good.  My biggest problem is that the bisquick didn't cook all the way through leaving a mushy mess. Next time i'm going to try covering with foil to see if that helps.

made this the other night.  very easy to put together but felt it needed something more.  I added a can of rotel instead of the fresh tomato also added the french fried onions, tasted too much of the oregano so I might either cut that down a bit or leave it out all together. This one needs a little work but still not a bad easy fix meal for the times when you are in a hurry.

I make this every once in a while.  It's really just okay, and I never want to eat the leftovers the next day because they deteriorate pretty quickly.  Next time I'll try it with the additions other reviewers suggested--french fried onions, mustard, and rotel.

A great start, but definitely needed a kick. I added a chopped cayenne pepper to the beef, along with some sliced baby bellas. I'm not a fan of tomatoes, either, so I stirred a small can of tomato sauce into the browned beef mixture, too (will use paste next time, though).

This is a super easy, super tasty dish.  Even my mom (somewhat picky) loves it!  The oregano gives it a different taste, much better than the recipe on "that box"

This was pretty much everything I thought it was going to be - OK...I subbed ground turkey for the beef and after sampling the mixture before baking it, I decided to add more garlic, some worcestershire sauce, A1 sauce, ketchup and mustard.  I also threw in a can of Rotel spicy tomatoes as opposed to using the fresh, and I cooked them with the meat.  The final product was good, and I would make it again for the ease of prep....thanks!

This was very easy to make, and turned out very well.  Unfortunately my son and husband don't like tomatoes, so I used ketchup instead for the burger-like flavor.  I also added a bit of Worcestershire sauce as well.  For the topping, I think I added too much milk accidentally, but I managed to balance it out and it still turned out very well.  I think I'm going to use the suggestion someone else posted and try adding bacon next time!  I will definitely be making this again!!  Thanks for posting!

Great - but i did change some things.  instead of tomato slices, i mixed a can of italian diced tomatoes and added some ketchup (probably 1/4 cup) to the meat/onion mixture.  the boy loved it (as did i), and next time i might add some heat in the form of red pepper flakes or Frank's Red Hot.  Thanks a lot for the post!

My mom used to make this when I was little, and I loved it. I omitted the tomatoes, but did sneak in a small julienned zucchini to get more veggies in my husband's diet.

Very good recipe.  The biscuit topping seemed a little bit too thick, I will probably only use 3/4 of a from-scratch batch.  Other than that, quite nice.

This was tasty, but the topping was very eggy.  It may have been eggy because I converted the recipe to 1 1/2, and sometimes when you convert recipes they turn out funky.  I used season all and garlic powder in place of the pepper and garlic salt.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Next time I make this I will follow the original recipe for the topping.

I thought this was a great recipe for when you are in a hurry.  I didn't add the tomatoes because my husband doesn't like them.  I also didn't add the oregano for fear that it would make it taste too much like meatloaf with cheese.  It turned out great!  I wish I would have made more.  Definately a keeper!!!

This was okay but definately not the best. I have made other recipes similar to this but i found it to be wet in testure. I think it might have been due to the sliced tomatoes. Probably won't make it again.

It sounded really good, but was rather bland.  I added a can of chopped tomatoes with peppers instead of sliced fresh tomatoes & added extra cheese on top of the biscuit layer.  Tobasco livened it up a bit though.

recipe was rather bland although I did supersize it to feed a larger family. if I try again I will use sharper cheese, more cheese and spice it up a bit.
