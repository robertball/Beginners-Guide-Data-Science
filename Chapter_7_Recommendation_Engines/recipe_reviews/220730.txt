These were different from any falafel that I have ever had, and I LOVED them! The curry powder gave these wonderful flavor. The insides were a beautiful bright yellow...so pretty. Almost too pretty to eat. Almost. Loved the crunch of the panko. These could've used a bit more salt, IMO, but that would be my only change next time. Served w/ 'Roasted Garlic Tzatziki', also from this site~YUM! Will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are really good. I skip the egg to make it vegan. QUICK NOTE: I've been seeing alot of reviews where people are stating theirs fell apart or turned to mush. You may be using too much oil, or your oil is not hot enough. When a bread crumb "dances" ON the oil, it should be a good temp. Don't crowd pan. Don't move or turn food until ready. Fry in small batches, even if your pan will hold more. And allow the oil temp to come back up in between batches. When done, set balls on cooling rack, not paper towels. :)

Pretty much everybody complains about the patties falling apart, even those who liked the taste and gave it a good rating otherwise. The reason is very obvious: you NEVER use canned garbanzos to make falafel. That should really be common knowledge by now. Canned garbanzos are pre-cooked, which denaturizes the starch, which will make it very difficult to make them hold together. You'll have to add a ton of extra ingredients like bread crumbs, egg etc.
The authentic way to make falafel, and the only way to make them so they actually hold together without adding all the extra stuff, is to use dried uncooked garbanzos and soak them over night.

The curry gave it great taste but  1/4 cup olive oil made it really runny. I had to keep adding more and more bread crumbs so that my patties would stay together. The recipe also did not call for any salt. I added one teaspoon to mine.I will make this again but with those changes.

I was curious to try this as it seemed very different than what we make back home in the Middle East (we don't use eggs, bread crumbs, and we use different spices). I tried it after making a number of modifications based on other reviews. First, Don't use canned garbanzo by all means! use dried ones after soaking them in water overnight. Second, there is no need for olive oil in the dough at all, it will make it very runny and you already have enough oil during frying ! Third, use fresh garlic and parsley if available. I used curry as specified but I didn't like it that much and I will be sticking to the traditional spices next time(cumin and dried coriander). Overall it wasn't that bad but not that wow.

These little patties are amazing! I did need to blend in more panko to help them hold their shape, but otherwise made exactly as written. Hubby was very pleasantly surprised by this one, as was I. I didn't even serve it with a sauce- the curry lends such a lovely flavor! I simply served it with some roasted vegetables, and it was a wonderful vegetarian meal. Thank you for sharing- it's a keeper for sure!

My husband and I really liked these. We had tried a recipe from a newspaper that used black beans. Black beans are not the way to go. We thought these were the most like some we had had at a 'hole in the wall' so were quite pleased with this recipe. 
Another thing we like with falafel is a spicy mayo dip we found with the first recipe: 1cup mayo, 1 Tablespoon minced garlic, 1 Tablespoon of Sriracha hot chili sauce.

Alright, I have made this before and from the start I listened to people:  skip the oil altogether, and use that for frying instead. For those like me who know that falafel does not take curry at all, the two ingredients you actually need to use to replace that are ground cumin and ground coriander seeds, start with  1/4 tsp. each and work up from your own taste. Finally, a key to making this healthier if you wish: replace the bread crumbs with oats (yep)and work in the egg until you know you have the right consistency.  You can add a little bit of water if it is too dry, as the oats will soak it up and you will have no splatter at the fry stage. Just keep in mind that if you make these with oats it fries differently and some of the crispiness may be lacking. Why I gave it 4 stars? I love falafel and this is a good general idea of where to start!

Sketchy! Good flavor but way too wet. They totally fell apart in the pan and made a big 'ol mess. We even halved the olive oil and doubled the bread crumbs. This recipe needs a re-work

I made this as i did have all ingredients on hand. I was not happy with it ,,not enough spice for me and mine fell apart. I added more breadcrumbs as I had a 19 ounce can, maybe that is what made them fall apart.

This was my first time making falafal and oh man, where have you been all my life!! Super easy, super filling.  This one is a keeper.  
As one reviewer stated though, the olive oil was a bit much.  I had to keep adding panko.  I didn't have time to chill it either, so they were pretty crumbly.  Next time I will decrease the olive oil and chill.  Because there definitely will be a next time.

Wonderful flavor. Terrible cooking instructions. I make patties from canned salmon all the time and so I was confident going into this recipe, but if I try this again, Im going to add only egg whites and perhaps no olive oil in the mix, just to fry. They didn't hold together and created breadcrumb slush in my pan.

What a lovely meal. I used gluten free panko and chose fresh parsley over dried. I allowed the mixture to sit about an hour before making into patties. I had no issues with them falling apart. Loved the flavor and they were so easy to make! Thank you for the recipe.

Fell apart in the oil, the mixture was not dry enough I guess, even with draining the chick peas well.

The patties disentigrated in the pan making a big pan full of mush. Out of all the patties, I was only able to salvage about 5.

Loved the flavor profile after adding a little salt, but it required quite a bit of tweaking to get to the finished product.  Fortunately this was not my first falafel rodeo.  I doubled the panko before dropping my test dummy.  It was still too loose, so I added some flour.  The consistency should be closer to a bread dough than a cookie dough, but you don't want to add so much flour that it becomes dense.

It was pretty good but there was not a lot of flavor. After reading reviews, I added less oil to the mixture and made sure the oil in the pan was hot (bread crumb dancing on top of oil when added to test for heat) and I was careful to let them cook for a while before flipping them. The one I didn't wait long enough for kind of got smooshy and almost fell apart. Ate them with pita bread and spicy mayo (srirachi, garlic, mayo combo) and it was good but not outstanding. I probably won't make them again.

This was very delicious! I followed the directions pretty close, except I substituted fresh italian parsley in for the called for dried parsley. I thought the consistency was perfect, not too dry, but enough to stick together and hold shape through cooking. We made it with cucumber sauce on the side... the combination was excellent!

I tried the mixture and it was so bitter, no sense continuing on. I threw out the curry powder , then looked up online if it can go bad/bitter....nope, that's curry's natural taste. But? I love curry. Oh well, better luck next time.

This was a really easy and simple recipe.  I did not have panko, so I used Italian style breadcrumbs instead.  My only recommendation would be to add a teaspoon of salt for a little more flavor.

I used fresh dill and garlic instead of dried, added a smidge less pepper than the recipe called for, and an extra splash of lemon juice. It tasted good. But it took me forever. Like an hour. I think frying it took the most time and I'll find a recipe for baked falafel next time. And I actually doubled the recipe and there was only a little leftover! We aren't big huge eaters either, pretty average. At least it did taste good though!

I made these  falafels they were ok but the curry seemed a little stronger then I was used to using.  Also, the initail paste after blending seemed a little wet but  bread crumbs  help and they baked up ok.

Really tasty! I only added maybe a tablespoon of oil to the mixture which came out with a good consistency.  I tried frying the first few but found they fell apart.  For the rest I baked them at 450 degrees on a greased pan until golden on both sides of the parties.  Baked the "falafel's" stayed together nicely and had a great consistency.  I made a tahini sauce for on top

Delicious! I made several changes inspired by the reviews and it worked out very well! The consistency and flavor were awesome. I left out the oil from the mixture, used oats instead of breadcrumbs (I didn't have breadcrumbs), used 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and coriander instead of curry (so that it would taste more authentically middle eastern), added a dash of salt, and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I did have to add a bit of flour (probably about 1/4 of cup) to the mixture after blending to make it firm enough to form into patties before frying.

This was the first time I've ever made falafels as this was a request by my 11 yr old son. He claims that he's had them before; this was my first! With that being said, I had no idea whether they were supposed to taste the way they did. He loved them so I guess that's all that matters LOL. As others have said, I omitted the oil but ran out of panko bc; only had the initial 1/4 cup. Used Italian bc to make it drier as well as to coat before frying. Will make again!

We are not adventurous eaters, but we do like humus and curry.  The two picky children couldn't get one bite down.  The two non-picky children couldn't get more than two bites down.

It came out really good but cracked open when I fried them... Probably needed more Panko crumbs.. I'm definitely going to make them again!!

I was trying to be more calories conscious on this one, so I omitted the oil, baked them at 375 for 15 minutes and didn't roll them in panko. They were okay, a little dry, would probably be more tasty fried. If you bake, I'd definitely recommend using a tsatzki sauce. Combined with lettuce, tomates, on a naan or pita, would definitely be a hearty but healthier meal.

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with mush balls that caused the oil to get all bubbly and overflow all over my stove. I think this might have been better with more bread crumbs and cooked in much less oil.  I have made more complicated falafel recipes with much better results and will stick with those.
