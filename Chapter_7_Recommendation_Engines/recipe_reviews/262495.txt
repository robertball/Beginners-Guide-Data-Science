Yum! I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I normally roast spaghetti squash in the oven but I used the microwave and it worked great. A nice change of pace!

Very good recipe. It's a little sweet because of the squash so I added extra salt and it was great. I will be making it again. Make sure to broil it so the cheese browns on top, that makes it very flavorful! 
*Even better as leftovers.

I increased the recipe for a potluck: I doubled the squash, garlic powder, sour cream, and cheese. I left the margarine and pepper flake amounts as-is, and used half an onion.  (I almost always reduce onion amounts.) I  didn't have enough sour cream, so I used cream cheese to make up the deficit; and I used butter in place of margarine. || Even with these pantry and taste accommodations, this recipe was AMAZING, with a light, balanced flavor. It was a huge hit at the potluck, and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I have been tired of making the same old "spaghetti and meatballs" with my squash so I was looking for something different.  This recipe was amazing.  I doubled it because I had a lot of squash from our garden,  I am so glad I did.  So delicious.  I prepared the squash in the oven instead of the microwave because I like it seasoned  and the roasted taste better.

My company didn't like onions so I replaced it with fresh garlic.  Really good, creamy and tasty.

My husband & I really liked this.  I made it exactly as recipe is written except I punctured squash a few times before microwaving.   BUT, to the review that suggested it was a good way to sneak veggies into your kids, that definitely didn’t work for my two boys.  It was a no-go!

Made this for lunch today and it came out great. My only changes were to cook the squash in the microwave to save time and I used mozzarella cheese since I had some I needed to finish up. Several testers had never eaten spaghetti squash before and they loved it! Will definitely make this again in the future as it is a great way to get more veggies in the diet.

A different way to cook spaghetti squash.  It has a good flavor but is a bit like over mashed potatoes.  The texture may put some people off.  I cut the pepper flakes down to 1/4 tsp.  It still had some bite but not overwhelming.  I will make it again.

Hubby liked it but I didn't.  I followed the directions,  except for the pepper flakes.  I thought the sour cream was too overpowering.

This is a delicious recipe! I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar per my hubby’s preference, omitted the red pepper flakes but otherwise made it as directed. Next time, still using pepper jack, I will include a bit of red pepper flakes for the extra kick. We are both looking forward to enjoying this dish again and again!

This is an excellent recipe for spaghetti squash. I did do a couple of things differently, but the results were great. I roasted the squash cut side up with olive oil and spices drizzled on it until the strings started to separate. I used real butter (I never, ever use margarine!), a small red onion chopped, real garlic and only a small shake of red pepper flakes. Also used regular sour cream and cheddar (probably a little more cheese than called for). It turned out really, really delicious. I know it’s a higher fat content, but it is a matter of preference. The smaller amount of heat was good too, enough to notice and spice things up but not burn. Don’t forget leftovers will get hotter! Anyway, I’ll be making it again, in fact already on the menu for next week!

This recipe was so so good!  The only thing I changed was using non fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and using gouda cheese instead of cheddar.  You can bet  I will be making it again??  Thanks for sharing!!

I followed the recipe and thought it was pretty tasty!  My kids didn't really like it.  Next time maybe I'll add a little cream of chicken to make it more like the au gratin potatoes to appease the little ones.

Left off peppers, used go veggie cheese and tofuti sour cream. Still turned out great. Would have given 5* except it didn't firm up quite as well as I thought it would.

I didn't add the pepper flakes, I will next time just didn't feel like it.  I did, however mix in 1 cooked chicken breast, small cubed, and used med sharp cheddar cheese and jack cheese, and added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes for moisture and it came out fantastic!  I couldn't get enough and was just as good the day after and the next day.  I live alone, so I altered for 2 servings and it made 3 for me, perfect.

And I also doubled the amount of onion, etc, and the cheese, half of which I put on top.

Really tasty. My son, in particular, loved it. I would reduce the red pepper a little the next time , but thought it was great overall.

This was amazing!  I didn't add any extra ingredients but I was short on enough red pepper flakes so I added extra garlic powder.  Also I just can't seemed to cook things in the micro for health reasons (I want all the nutrients) so I did opt for baking the Spaghetti Squash.  400 degrees for 25 minutes. It also gives a better flavor.  I loved it so much I think I'll have to make this at our next family holiday!

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the red pepper flakes all together because my mom isn't a fan of spicy. Even without the "spice" the taste was great! We will definitely be making this again and adding more cheese next time.

Surprisingly, very good!  Since it was the first time I made this,  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  Next time might experiment with some add-ins....(crumbled sausage, shredded carrots, spinach, cubed ham, etc). Served this with a side of salad and crispy garlic bread. Yummy!

Super easy to make and it was delicious. I added chicken to it. Even my husband, who I've tried multiple spaghetti squash recipes with and he didn't like the others much- said this  one was a keeper

This was a good way to introduce the family to spaghetti squash.  Everyone seemed to like it okay.  I am one who likes spicy food -- the hotter the better.  I followed the recipe and put in the 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.  Even for me, I thought it was a little spicy for just being, what I thought, a family friendly side dish.  It wasn't crazy spicy, but it was definitely noticed by the more 'spicy sensitive' dinner attendees.  Overall, however, I thought it turned out well and would consider making it again (cutting back on the red pepper flakes).

This was pretty good. I may not have used enough seasoning. It definitely needs seasoning and cheese to kick up the flavor. It could be made better with more of both. Hubby thought it was "so - so". I would make it again just for the nutritional value it offers and reduced carbs.

I had this recipe saved for a while so I was excited about making it but a bit apprehensive about microwaving the squash to cook it, as I’ve always done it in the oven. It took a little longer in the mic but maybe because I turned the turn table off so the dish would fit.. only did 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes & I’m glad because that was plenty for my smaller sized squash. Used about 5 slices of kraft singles due to totally forgetting to pick up cheddar cheese at the store. Fresh grated Parmesan on top. So delicious with chicken parm and salad, I didn’t want to stop eating it! Thanks for the recipe, will be making again.

We normally microwave adding some butter, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.  It turns out good enough for adults to eat, but nothing special.  For the first time our youngest daughter thoroughly enjoyed eating spaghetti squash.  She normally would only take a bite of the other concoction.  My wife tasted it and commented it tasted like Potato Au Gratin.  Then I revealed the name of the dish.  We really enjoyed this dish.
