These are delicious. I added the nutmeg and thought it was a nice touch. This is a great complement to brunch. Just a tip, if using a Philips airfryer, donâ€™t preheat with the parchment paper. Add it when you put the sticks in. It will burn. Thank you for the recipe.

Wasn't expecting these to be so good!  I did an extra minute at the end for a bit more crispy and used unsweetened almond milk since that was on hand.  I will definitely make these again.
