GREAT recipe! I've made scallops this way for years... with a few minor changes. I salt & pepper the scallops, drizzle with a little olive oil and marinate the scallops with a lot more chopped fresh garlic & rosemary. Spray the pan with non stick spray and place the scallops in one at a time (don't dump them in with the juice or you'll end up "boiling" the scallops) and cook 2-4 minutes each side, depending on size. The jumbo sea scallops have the best flavor, just be sure to rinse them well.

Very good and quick. Suggest heating a Tablespoon of oil in pan before add ing butter so that butter does not burn.

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT.  I USED A LITTLE BIT MORE GARLIC AND A LITTLE LESS ROSEMARY.  IT WAS PERFECT.  JUST BE CAREFULL NOT TO OVER COOK THE SCALLOPS BECAUSE THEY WILL TURN OUT RUBBERY.

This was very good. I used minced garlic, and added dill weed and lemon pepper to the mix. While the scallops cooked, I constantly spooned the butter and garlic mix over them. It took a lot longer than 2 minutes per side to cook... but I had the jumbo scallops. I served with steamed sugar snap peas and white cheddar shells and cheese macaroni. I will definitely make this again!!

A basic recipe to season to your taste.  However it could go wrong if you crowd the pan and it isn't   heavy and hot enough.  I find a cast iron fry pan works best. Scallops cook in a hurry and you want a bit of a crust on them.  It wont happen with too many in the fry pan.  They will give off their juices and start to boil and dry out.  A hot pan with just a few scallops and turning frequently does the trick.

I never cooked scallops before so this recipe was very helpful for my first time. I added a little white wine and I didn't have any  rosemary. They turned out great.

This was a little bland for us so I added 1/4 cup more butter, 2 tablespoons white wine, garlic salt to taste, and green onions.

I had never cooked scallops before, so I wanted to start with something simple. I read all the comments before I started and this is what I ended up doing...
Im not a fan of rosemary... left it out.
Im a big fan of garlic... added extra
I did salt and pepper them before I cooked them.
I put enough olive oil in the pan to just cover it before I added the butter and used a little lower temp so the butter wouldn't burn.
They took a little longer to cook... ~5 min each side.
And they came out better than any scallop I've had at any restaurant. Perfect!

Just what I was looking for. Just a nice simple recipe. No sauce,not a lot of other additives to get in the way, just great scallops. This will be a regular in our house.

These were awesome.... just like in the restaurants!  I made a few edits however.  I used 4 cloves of garlic and added about a 1/4 cup of white wine.  I also made sure to rinse the Sea scallops (I prefer these) and pat dry ahead of time.  I put salt and pepper on the scallops before sauteing. I'll make these again.

Hi from TX...I had a weird craving for scallops (no, I'm not pregnant!)and tried this. I used very small "bay" scallops. If I do it again I'll splurge for the $12.99/lb huge scallops. These turned out semi-okay; I tried to sear them in my iron skillet in a mixture of olive oil and a little butter, sprinkled garlic salt and some italian seasoning, but they were very lackluster. I'm a newbie to cooking seafood so I'm sure it's my mistake. Thanks for the post!

I liked the rosemary here, something I've never used with scallops. Its flavor was very subtle, however, so next time I might consider using even more.  Clarified butter (or adding a little olive oil to the butter) helps ensure against it burning when saut√©ing at a relatively high heat.

Very good! I used big sea scallops, rinsed and dried, then coated with olive oil, sea salt and pepper. Cat iron skillet heated then added butter, rosemary and garlic. Cooked for a minute and added scallops....was very pleased! Will definately make again.

I'm eating it right now. It's amazing. I used 2 HUGE cloves of garlic (the size of 5 normal ones), 4 large sprigs of rosemary (I like a lot of herbs), and a crapton of olive oil, and a dash of butter. My tastebuds are doing cartwheels while singing the 'halleluja' chorus. Thank you.

I used  1T olive oil rather butter and I used jumbo scallops so had to cook them 3-4min a side.  I love the delicate flavors and will make this receipe again soon.

Needs salt.  Definitely use 2 cloves of garlic.  I dried the scallops on paper towels before cooking.  they were good, but needed salt and definitely use 2 cloves of garlic.  I may sprinkle them with a little grated parmesan cheese right before I take them out of the skillet.

Lacked spices.  I don't think rosemary is a spice I'd recommend on scallops.  This needed a bit more salt and a touch of "something", which I couldn't pinpoint.

Absolutely Delicious and so easy!  I took a few of the suggestion from others - drizzled some olive oil to prevent the butter from burning as well as seasoning the scallops with salt & pepper prior to sauteeing.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I just used about a 1 tsp of dried.  Came out great!

I expected more flavor than these delivered.  I think there is potential, but to my taste they were lacking as this is written.  More rosemary, more garlic, and perhaps a splash of white wine, and a little sprinkling of salt when they're finished.  I will say though that the scallops were perfectly cooked.

This was my first time cooking scallops and I absolutely loved them. I did sprinkle the scallops with a little seasoning salt.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Truly delicious!  This is a keeper.

The scallops were soft and tasteless. I could taste the garlic, but the scallops were not at all tasty.

OMG! This was GREAT!! I added a few things though. I cut up carrots into little sticks, green pepper, mushrooms and broccoli. Added those things in with the butter first to let them simmer and then added garlic, extra butter a little bit of splenda to taste and then the scallops. This was AWESOME! Thank you so much!!

Great. Easy and delish. I just wanted to stress that it's ok to cook scallops fast; they may seem undercooked but that's how they should be. They are supposed to be pan seared on outside. No need to add liquid as it may make them boil. (don't).
Also, I agree with others who stated not to crowd the scallops. They should not touch. As with all seafood, fresh is best. Yum.

It was my first time cooking scallops so I did over cook it a bit.Even with that mistake it was good. The breadcrumb coating was awesome. Will use it for other meats as weel.

This was fine, but didn't blow me away.  I think it would be better to sear the scallops first, and the rosemary was a bit overpowering for my taste.

I tried this with what I had on hand, and used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 Tbl. of garlic salt, melted in in the pain and sauteed the scallops for about 5 minutes per side (they were quite large scallops) very easy and very delicious!

Love, love, loved it!  Used sea scallops and shrimp.  Both were out of this world.  I also did the baked scallop recipe so we had a delicious mixture of both versions for dinner.  (Also, having scallops saut√©ed in butter can sometimes feel too heavy if eaten alone.). i appreciated the hint from the other reviewer to add a little olive oil to the butter mixture so you can get the butter temperature really hot without burning the butter.  The hotter the saut√©, the better the scallops lock in their juices.  Used the cast iron skillet, too.  Also I saut√©ed garlic and rosemary in the butter/oil for couple minutes before adding scallops and shrimp.  A delicious treat!

I would change this recipe to start with only 2 tablespoons of butter plus the crushed garlic and spice. Add the scallops when the pan is hot, searing them a golden brown on both sides. (If I had read the other reviews first, I would have then added a half cup of rice wine, to loosen brown bits, then added the rest of the butter).  I didn't have rosemary, so I used fresh basil from my garden.

I seasoned almost as written, except for the rosemary only because I didn't have any. I also didn't remove the garlic from the pan when complete, but removed the scallops. They were delicious. I also prepared them over a high heat that I think locks the juices in. You just have to be careful to not over cook them. Also, it's very important to wash (rinse) the scallops if you buy Sea Scallops like I did. Overall, I gave this five stars because this is definitely a keeper.

Very easy and delicious. Modified according to prior tips; salt and pepper on the scallops before putting in pan; a bit of olive oil in pan. I did 2 batches, half pound each batch, to control the cooking and added a splash of white wine to each batch. Next time,  I might add a pinch of cayenne pepper, or even herbs de provence. I served this with arugula salad (olive oil/lemon/parm cheese) and asparagus cooked in half chicken broth/half water with herbs de provence.  Light but filling dinner for two!

Delicious and simple recipe. Love that there is just enough seasoning for flavor without hiding the taste of the scallops. I seasoned with salt and pepper before putting in the hot pan with melted butter and saut√©ed garlic. I used parsley instead of rosemary.  Served over saut√©ed spinach and angel hair pasta. Thank you for posting. It‚Äôs a keeper!

Very simple and very very good. I did this exactly according to recipe and it came out wonderful. I also did another pan and added a cream sauce. To make the cream sauce I removed scallops from pan, used the pan drippings and mixed with more butter, whipping cream, white wine,  sour cream, romano cheese, and a dash of salt. The sauce was decadent and really added to scallops...so BOTH ways were yummy.

For a person that is not familiar with cooking seafood, this is a nice easy recipe to follow.  My husband and I really enjoyed these.  The only ones I like better a scallops that a friend makes that are wrapped in bacon.  With my limited skills I am not ready for that.  These were perfect.

Easy and tasty recipe, but husband thought the rosemary was too much.  Next time I will use just a pinch or maybe substitute it with parsley.

I was so nervous, this was my first time to saute scallops. They were perfect. No changes made other than to salt and pepper the scallops before they went in the pan. The timing on the recipe is dead on accurate. We used jumbo sea scallops.

Fabulous recipe!  I never made scallops before, and this was so easy and delicious.  I used one extra clove of garlic, no rosemary since I don't like it, and took the suggestion of a few reviewers to salt and pepper the scallops after washing and drying them.  I'll make this again!

These were yummy. Make sure you pay your scallops dry before you sear them. And if you really want to add some good flavor, sub bacon fat for the butter! Yum!

What an easy recipe for a great entree.  I marinated the scallops in olive oil and minced garlic for two hours but skipped the rosemary, which isn't a favorite herb in our house.  I cooked the scallops according to the recipe and served them on fettuccine with pesto along with asparagus and  a Caesar salad for Valentine's Day dinner.  Two thumbs up from both of us and so so easy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This seems like a decent recipe. The main things I would change are 1. Use a larger pan or do the cooking in small batches so the scallops have space to sear properly. 2. Work more by color than time. It took nearly four minutes per side for them to gain a golden seat for me.

I added a pinch of Himalayan salt. Took out the rosemary. Cooked them for three minutes on each side. Cracked pepper on finished dish. I paired it with cauliflower risotto and spinach.

This is a good recipe. I used my cast iron skillet. The scallops cooked evenly and took on a beautiful color. They were tender.  Don't use minced garlic from a jar as it doesn't make a paste and it burns. My dish did not taste burned though. I didn't have rosemary so I served the scallops with the garlic butter from the pan. It's good this way, but I will put the rosemary in next time!

Best way to make scallops. I just add olive oil, brown sugar, raw honey, roasted cherry tomatoes, loads of garlic and saut√© the scallops. It ends up with the tastiest honey scallop sauce. Great for bread or to add to risotto

I needed to modify the original recipe, I added white wine and added Lime Oil to the butter so it wouldn't burn.  I also added lemon pepper and crazy salt. Served with Sauteed Onion/Zucchini with wilted spinach with garlic.  Very tastey
