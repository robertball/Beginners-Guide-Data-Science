I used a Swiss-American cheese slices on top of these sandwiches as that's what my favorite cheese steak food stand guy tells me to use. I also spread some garlic-butter on the rolls and toasted them slightly before topping them with the cheese-steak mixture. Other than that, I pretty much kept to the recipe. This is good but it's missing something. I'm not sure what it is, I'm going to make this again and play with the recipe a little.

Very good!  I definitely would read the first review from the owner of this recipe.  I used a 2.6 lb trip tip steak and it was way overcooked after 4 hours.  Next time I will do only 3 hours.  I also made sure to add the 1 T of red wine vinegar that was suppose to be listed in the recipe.  The white American cheese was so good on this!  And definitely put two slices of cheese on each sandwich because once it melts you will want extra!  Thanks for sharing a great and easy recipe!

My boyfriend loved this! Be sure to ask your butcher if tri tip steak is available - it wasn't at our store, and the butcher was able to suggest a different cut. We left out the mushrooms (he's not a fan of them), but I will definitely add them to mine next time!

This is my recipe and seasoning the meat kind of goes without saying for me - sorry I left it out of the recipe to salt and pepper it. I guess it is just something I do naturally.  With all slow cooker recipes where you are using meat - to get the most flavor sear the meat first on the stove. I do this for this recipe when I have more time, but it still works and is flavorful without searing.  Be careful with the salt as the stock will be salty too, but do season with salt for more depth of flavor.

My husband and I found this dish rather bland.  I was a bit concerned about this seeing that it called for no seasoning on the meat or the veggies, so I even added salt and pepper to the grilled veggies.  We also used pepper jack cheese and used the leftover broth for dipping but overall the sandwiches just seemed lacking in flavor.  If I were to make this again, I would brown the meat first with some garlic salt and pepper and maybe even some flour and then place in crock pot.  I find from making roasts in the past with tri tip that this tends to seal in the juices.  Definitely found 3.5 hours was plenty of time for the meat.  It was still pretty tender (not chewy thankfully) but already dry and cooked through.  I think the leftovers are going to make some awesome fajitas tomorrow, though!

I read a few of the reviews before starting this recipe because I wanted to improve the taste and texture of the tri tip steak. Lightly sprinkle (no more than 2 tsp.) of Montreal Steak seasoning as a rub before searing the meat in a 2-3 qt. pot (or use 10-inch skillet with lid). I try not use more than 1-2 tbl. of olive oil when searing. After searing, transfer meat to slow cooker. Meanwhile turn off heat to searing pot and add beef stock to soften up all the leftover meat/seasoning pieces.  Whisk in vinegar and worcester sauce then add stock mixture to slow cooker.  I added raw, sliced onions mushrooms and peppers directly on top of meat before covering and slow cooking. After 2-3 hours I removed meat to let cool before slicing and returning to slow cooker.  I grilled the sliced sandwich buns. With slotted spoon I transferred meat/veggie mixture to each open-faced bun then added the cheese (it melts on the heated meat mixture but you can also melt it in the broiler. I ladled out remaining juices (I didn't strain it) in dipping bowls to serve on the side.

Very Yummy!  I used 3.5 pounds of tri tip steak to feed 8 & doubled the rest!  It was loved by the adults as well as the kiddos!  My husband asked this recipe to be a part of the monthly menu!

this is my first review after making several things on this website. This sandwich is great! My husband accidently grabbed beef stock instead of chicken, so i put beef stock in the ingredient finder and this looked good. the beef is super easy to cook since it's in a crockpot and cooking the veggies only takes a few minutes. I don't even eat beef but had to try one of these after they came out of the oven and looked so delicious! only change i made was to use provolone cheese instead of american. Wonderful recipe, will absolutely make again!!

This was freaking delicious!  I cooked the meat exactly 3 hours and it was nice and juicy.  Omitted the peppers since my husband doesn't like them and I added Worcester to the mushrooms and onions.  It was also easy to make which is great for me since I usually can't cook.

Well, I tried this and it was not to my liking! The meat was dry, tough and tasteless. I made only two sandwiches and couldn't eat more. Don't make this just go to a good sub shop.

Wonderful sandwich!  What made this so good is the white american cheese.  Some east coasters use cheese whiz, which is not nearly as good.  I do believe this is the best genuine Philly Cheese Steak I have eaten!

Very yummy!  I made it without the mushrooms (because I don't like them), and the recipe turned out great.  Used sourdough rolls and colby jack cheese that I  had on hand - delicious!

This is a pull-apart beef sandwiches.  This is far from a cheesestake.  I come from PA and every cheesestake I ever had was made out of thin sliced rib eye or eye roll steak.  The stake is cooked quickly on a hot griddle, after onions were caramelized in the pan and removed.   Place on a hard hoagie roll and pore melted cheese wiz over the top.  Don’t forget the salt, pepper and garlic.

I'm so glad I found this recipe because I bought a 3 pack of tri tips that was on sale and needed some new ways to make it!! This was really good! I didn't use the mushrooms, just because I didn't have any on hand. I love a good sandwich :) Thanks for the recipe!!

I had to defer to the cheese steak expert (Mr. LTH) on this one.  I asked him for a star rating and he said, "4.5".  I would say 4, so we'll average them together and call it 4.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the cut of meat.   I did not have tri tip, so I substituted Sirloin Top Roast.

The meat was amazing.  I think I will use the beef broth used for this in more then just this dish.  I had to use hot dog buns though as my kids don't eat that much.  Next time I will use the hoagie roll.

Good stuff - passed the test by my wife, who is originally from Philly. I used half the recommended peppers, but didn't skimp on the onion. After taking it out of the slow cooker and breaking it up, I mixed the meat in the same skillet as my peppers and onion and then mixed in the cheese.

This turned out delicious.  Followed the recipe other than putting salt, pepper and some onion powder on the meat before cooking.  It was tender and fantastic.

only difference I made in actual preparation was I used a can of beef consumme instead of the beef stock. I made up the sandwiches as written, but then added some chipolte mayo I had made (which made them wonderful)

I used a 3 lb sirloin tip roast and since I only eat very well done meat cooked it until it fell apart in the pot(about 7 hrs) then let it hang out for another hour in the broth. I think this dries it out some so I also use a sauce on the sandwiches but that's not to say it would have been dry if cooked to medium as the recipe instructed. I did not wrap and reheat the whole sandwich because we didn't have time. I just toasted the buns and used shredded cheese so it would melt from the heat of the meat and veggies, which I cooked slowly in foil on the grill til soft. The meat wasn't that flavorful, in my opinion but we'll see how the leftovers are. Overall, I like the cooking method but will try to get more flavor next time.

Great idea but I think a little over the top as far as using a better cut of meat. I used bottom round steaks cut from a bottom round roast. Inexpensive and works well. I cooked the steaks in chicken stalk (all I had) and onions on high in my crock pot until meat started to fall apart. I pulled the meat apart (like pulled pork) mixed in 3 ladle fulls of the juice and let it sit while I cooked the onions, peppers and mushrooms. Placed on toasted rolls with cheese and mustard and broiled to melt cheese. Very tasty, tender and the family raved about them.

Living on the west coast from Philly, not easy to come across a good philly...made this with french rolls (bc we dont have italian) and it is definitely a keeper.  Everyone enjoyed the sandwich.  I did cook for only 3 hours, I think next time I will cook on low for 3 hours instead, i like a some color in my meat.

I gave 5-stars because the entire family liked this one.  Only substitutes I made were sirloin steak and grated italian cheese, simply because that's what I had on hand.  And I put open-faced under broiler instead of wrapping in tin foil because we like the toasted bread, but I think would be good either way.

Will be adding some more spices next time as I felt it needed some pepper at least. But I did enjoy the flavor, and oh yes, I served it on Focaccia bread.  MMMMMM!

I also agree that this is missing something. None of the flavorings penetrated into the beef which also was not very tender.  If we do this again, might cook it longer so it's shreddable next time.  Served it with mayo and might dip the sandwich as suggested by the author.

This was easy and so tasty! The kids said that it was one to put into regular rotation. B+ from harsh teenage critics!

Be sure to use a cut of meat with some fat on it, also as others have said the seasoning of the meat itself is lacking and can taste very bland.  Otherwise a good recipe for Cheese Steak Sammwhichs

Everyone loved them!  I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used dry white wine vinegar instead.  I used thawed frozen peppers and onions to save in slicing but next time I will definitely use fresh.   My husband said it was a tad bit dry so with the leftover juices I plan on making a super thick gravy to drizzle over each one after they come out of the oven.

This recipe made for some tasty cheesesteaks.  I used provolone cheese and multi-colored peppers because of my family's taste preferences.

Really liked the flavor of the meat and it was great to have that part done ahead of time.

I cooked the tip steak for like 8+ hours in the crockpot added garlic powder, kosher salt and cracked black pepper. It was totally amazing!  I don't like green peppers so I used red pepper and  baby portabella with shredded cheddar cheese. Again, it was amazing!!  I will be making this again for sure!!

This was wonderful! The down-side for me was that my local markets didn't carry the cut of meat suggested. So I wound up with a tougher piece of meat and that made the sandwich hard to chew, especially for my kids. Next time I do this I will have to find a meat market.

These turned out really good. My steak was a little over-done; my pieces must have been too small (bought pre-sliced at the grocer). My mushrooms were no good, so I had to ix-nay them; used green and red bells. Also used Swiss cheese instead of American, and buttered the rolls with melted, salted butter before I topped them. All in all, a hit!

I stuck to the recipe and found that the meat had an almost sour taste when done from the Vinegar I suspect. I cheated so my kids would eat it also and dumped in some bbq sauce at the end and a little maple syrup to just sweeten it a little bit!  It was then a HIT! But it is not really the same recipe then. Will make again with the addition of a little sweetener and bbq sauce.

I followed the advice of others and seasoned and seated the beef before putting it in the slow cooker. I cooked it for about 3 hours. The meat was moist and tender. I omitted the mushrooms, as my family does not like them. Everyone loved it. I do highly recommend wrapping them in foil before baking them. We were out of foil and the cheese melted more on the pan than the bun. We dipped the sandwich in the leftover juices. So yummy!

Philadelphia is famous for their cheesesteak sandwiches.  To make a  Philadelphia Cheese Steak sandwich, use green peppers, onions and Cheeze Whiz....lots of it.  I ate a real one down by Independence Hall a few years ago and it was the best sandwich I had ever eaten in my life.  They put the hard rolls on the grill and browned them and heated them up and put a huge amount of steak/green peppers/onions on it and doused it with warm cheese whiz which was heated up in a can on back of the grill.  Great town and a great sandwich!

I gave this 4 stars since I had to tweak this recipe.  I used my own rub and quickly grilled the boneless beef ribs, which was $2 less a pound.  If you season the meat well enough then the beef or vegetable broth is enough to cook the meat in.  I'll make this again using my twist especially when our summer temps are expected to be triple digits like the day I made this.

Just some friendly F.Y.I being its not stated... If you plan on doing a Tri-Tip low & slow, your temp needs to be in the 225-250 range & it will be done in about 2-1/2 to 3 hours regardless what you make it in... Except I've noticed with one of my smokers being it generates a lot of steam, it's done in about 2 hours at about 240... None the less, there's a simple guide to follow...
