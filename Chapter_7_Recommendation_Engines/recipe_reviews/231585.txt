Chicken Parmesan with Linguine & Broccoli Haiku: "Needed some more sauce. (And more seasoning as well.) Tasted fairly good." Followed the recipe exactly as written, but found two things odd - the dip in milk followed by parmesan which resulted in nothing "sticking" in any breaded or "Chicken Parmesan-ey" kind of way, along w/ the throwing the thawed broccoli into the boiling pasta water towards the end. Well I did everything as Kraft intended (other than using non-Kraft mozzarella) and we found the plain can of tomato sauce lacking in flavor, along w/ not being enough of for covering that much chicken, pasta, mushroom, onion etc ... In the end, the chicken was moist and cooked perfectly according to the recipe's directions, but the linguine was just so ... yawn. To make this again would require using a quality jar (or homemade) spaghetti sauce, or adding substantial seasoning and spices to the tomato sauce, tossing the linguine w/ the chicken/mushroom mixture, and either bypassing the broccoli altogether, or letting it cook w/ the chicken.
