WOW!  Probably the best thing I ever ate for lunch.  The only Chipolte sauce available here is canned and I find it has an off, metallic taste so I simply seasoned my chicken with chipotle powder that I bought fresh from the Farmers Market.  I still got the kick and smokey flavor.  Fabulous! We will absolutely have these again.  Thank you Patty!

This is an amazing dinner!  Patty Cakes will not care at all that I tweaked this just a touch (she always tweaks recipes, AND she KNOWS me!).  But I'm not letting my love for her get in my way.  I had some leftover chicken from a very mild chicken dinner last night, and just to add a little more I bought a grilled chicken breast from Vons (Safeway---or now maybe Albertsons).   I used Classico's Alfredo Sauce and added to it Herdez's Guajillo Chile Cooking Sauce.  Because this was just for the two of us, I didn't measure anything---just mixed until it looked right to us.  I didn't use Pico de gallo because the Herdez sauce with the Classico Fresh Alfredo Sauce was just perfect!  On the top I used a guacamole recipe by Paula from this site (Guacamole My Way), and I topped it with just a touch of sour cream.  I can't tell you how wonderful this was for us!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Thank you so much, Patty Cakes!  P.S.  The bacon addition was genius!

This recipe was,absolutely delicious!  I made a few *small* changes to fit our tastes. I was unable to find chipolte sauce so I added chipolte seasoning instead. I also used green onions (personal preference) and added 1 cup of Mexican blend cheese. Wowza! This recipe is a definite keeper! Smokey, savory, just perfect with some guacamole and salsa.

super surprised there are only 3 previous reviews for this recipe.  It was great.  I didn't really measure anything (making for two) and it was just fabulous.  Threw together some pico and skipped the guacamole (I didn't have avocados) and it was super fast.  I had some chicken breasts to use up so instead of buying a precooked bird from the store I baked 3 of them with a little chicken broth and some crumbled chipotle bullion for 30 minutes.

Every once in a while you run across a recipe that knocks your socks off.  This is one of those recipes for me.  I used a little less chipotle sauce than was requested in the recipe but it still had that kick.  I topped it with guacamole and it was perfect.  This was an easy and very tasty dish.  Itâ€™s a keeper!

Consistent family fave. Not exactly low calorie, but a nice treat for the weekend! I substitute enchilada sauce just as a personal preference, but the recipe is great as is.

I was looking for a recipe with chicken and bacon and this popped up. Yum! So glad it did! While I made it differently, the flavor combos were genius and something I'll return to again and again. I fried corn tortillas for taco shells, added rotisserie chicken, topped with bacon. I made my own alfredo sauce, and mixed in some chipotle chiles en adobo. I spooned this mixture on top of the chicken and bacon, and finished it with sliced plum tomatoes. If I had had guac, my husband would have had that on his.

Made it as listed without any changes.

I really wanted, and expected, to like this recipe, but I was honestly stunned by the blandness of it.  It TOTALLY lacked spice and flavor, and to finish eating what I'd made, my family and I found ourselves DROWNING the taquitos in guacamole and pico de gallo just to make them passable.

I repurposed the remaining chicken mixture into enchilada filling to avoid wasting the ingredients.

If you make this, make sure to assess what your version of spicy and flavorful is as compared to what others think is spicy and flavorful.  Kept wondering if it was a geographical thing.

A real disappointment.

It was okay, kind of a strange flavor with the chipotle & Alfredo mixed together, definitely not the best combination. I didn't really enjoy that. Would not make it again.

Not bad! My filling was a little bit runny, but the flavor was weirdly delicious. The only change I made was that I just fried mine in the bacon grease instead of using oil.
