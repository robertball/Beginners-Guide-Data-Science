Pretty tasty! I made mine thicker in mini heart molds, but I think that was not the best idea b/c it was kinda hard to bite through them, so next time, I will keep them thinner. I then dipped them into chocolate, which made them lood so pretty. Not an exact replica of a Butterfinger, IMO, but still good! Thanks for sharing. :)
