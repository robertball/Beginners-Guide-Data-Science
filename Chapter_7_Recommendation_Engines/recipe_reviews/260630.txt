This recipe worked very well in the air fryer. The cake came out moist and fluffy. I would maybe omit the salt if you're using salted butter. It had just a touch too much salt after adding the pinch. We cooked this in an air fryer cake pan which was the perfect size.

Love this quick little cake however for my air fryer I don’t cook it near as long so check it along the way and if it seems cooked way early, it is.... also I used the round air fryer pan that came with mine.... one other thing is that you have to be sure and use self rising flour... turns out good if you don’t over cook!

I think this might have been a really good cake but it was overcooked at 30 minutes.   Turned out very dry.    Was the perfect size, however, had it not been so overbaked.  Will try again and check after 20 minutes.  Or I may just bake it my toaster oven.
