I made this healthir by using light cream instead of heavy. I also used more leeks and less cheese. Very good and creamy, I will make again!

My daughter, who is an excellent cook, served this at Easter. The only change she made was substituting light cream for the heavy cream; it was delicious. I hope she makes it a tradition.

Mmmm, I really enjoyed this smooth and creamy pasta side dish.  (Hubs not so much, but then that was a given, considering he doesn’t like “stinky” cheeses like Parmesan, Romano, etc.  Even so, he still scarfed it right up!)  I had an “Autumn Harvest” special blend orzo I wanted to use, so I substituted that for the ditalini.  While it obviously gave this dish extra flavor it wouldn’t have had on its own, I have no doubt I would have enjoyed this just as much had I used the ditalini.  The leek was a creative and interesting addition that along with the heavy cream and cheese made a really rich and delectable sauce.  I served this with “Veal Marsala,” and “Sauteed Green Beans,” both recipes from this website.

Thank you for the nice simple recipe.  I had a lot of leeks on hand this fall and I never cooked with them before.  This was such a pleasant dish.  First, I made the original recipe for myself and loved it.  Then, I altered it to serve my family by tripling it, added to cooked campanelle, topped w/cheese, and baked to brown the cheese.  OH SOOO YUM.  This is just a suggestion, the original recipe is 5 stars just as it is.

This is a QUICK and tasty recipe!  It has become a "usual" at our dinner table.  My only substitution is olive oil for the butter, but other than that I prepare it as-is.  I find the amount of sauce enough for a coating of the pasta instead of being dredged.  If you like a more saucy dish I would recommend doubling the sauce portion of the recipe.  I give this 5 stars for ease and yumminess!

This was a decent pasta recipe. I enjoyed the flavor of the leeks, which really came through in the sauce. We did make it lower in fat by using milk instead of heavy cream and adding some flour to saute with the leeks just before the milk to thicken it, which worked well. I also reduced the amount of butter used. I gave it only three stars because it was not a special recipe or something that I would remember but it tasted good.

I thought I had cream, but I only had half and half; so I thickened the sauce with flour (by taking about 1/4 cup warm sauce and adding about two tablespoons flour & then stirring out all the lumps before adding it back)- I doubled the recipe. I then added a can of minced clams with about two tablespoons of the clam liquid and about 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes... my husband likes spicy food! It turned out extremely well. By the way, I have no idea what ditalini even looks like; instead, I substituted fresh linguini from the grocers fridge:) Yummy!

So tasty and simple!  I happened to have a "leftover" leek and looked up any recipe to use it and came across this one.  I had everything but the cream so I used fat free half and half that I had on hand.  Delicious!  My kids gobbled it up and requested that I make it again as soon as possible.

This was decent but a little plain tasting.  I think the leeks should of been cooked longer.  I added some chili flakes and that helped.

This dish was pretty good.  It was basically just an alfredo sauce.  I didn't think it would be good over ditalini, so I used orecchiette instead.  I also used a full cup of cream because there wouldn't have been enough juice to coat the pasta.  Next time I think I will use only half a cup of cheese because it was a little overpowering for me.  Overall this was very tasty and very easy...thanks.

So simple and so delicious! Made with rotini instead of ditalini and double the amount of sauce. Served with bbq'd tri-tip and my husband and I both thought the pasta outshined the tri-tip! Will definitely make again!

Ok, so before I get any slack for this I just want to say that I tried really, REALLY hard to find leeks, and neither of my local stores had them, so I made it work with what I had because I had my heart set on making this today. Having said that, this was DELICIOUS! Instead of the leeks, I used a mix of green onions and sweet onion, which was wonderful and more garlic than called for. Also, I had 1/2 & 1/2 on hand that needed used, so I went with that. IMO, the final dish needed a little salt, but that was my preference. I made this as a side dish to pork parmesan and hubby said he could've eaten this on it's own, so that's saying a lot, lol. This was so simple to make, and it will definately be going into our rotation hopefully I'll find some leeks soon)! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is absolutely delicious! Unfortunately, I didn't have any cream or even half & half so I had to use milk but followed the suggestion of another user and added some flour to the leeks/garlic before adding milk. I also doubled the amount of leeks, used about 3 cloves of garlic, and mixed enough cheese just to coat (about 1/3 cup). I will definitely make this again!

My whole family loved this and I don't think it could have possibly worked with milk to replace the cream, there are some recipes that you just have to make up for it in the diet later.  It was very rich and filling, but even still my 6 year old have four servings.  My 12 year old also made it with my help and he wanted to add chicken and brussel sprouts and it was a good touch to make it a one dish meal.

I've tried this recipe a few times now, and I just love it. The last time I made it, I used half heavy cream, half milk. I also chopped up and browned some chicken breasts, which went so well with the sauce and pasta. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Great recipe. Just added onion, tarragon, lots of extra garlic and thyme. Once cooked, I topped it with grated Parmesan then melted butter and baked at 400 degrees till nice and brown. It was fabulous. Will make again. Could not find detalini so used mini penne.

I used onions, garlic, and half and half.  I also added an extra splash of 2% milk.  My husband asked for seconds.  That is my greatest compliment since he really likes basic "normal " foods.

Needs more mile, at least 3/4 cup. also I used a whole leek (white and light green parts) and it still was not enough, could have benefitted from wither another leek or some onion, Also more garlic.

Loved it. Used more leek, less Romano and used half and half. Added a cup of kale which made it look more interesting and added nutritional value. Will definitely repeat. Maybe with orzo or barley.

Very good, although it needed way more garlic. I only had skim milk on hand, so I used that along with extra butter. I've never cooked with leeks before (grew them in the garden this year), and they browned a bit more than I would have liked, but I admit to being distracted while they were sauting. Will make again.
