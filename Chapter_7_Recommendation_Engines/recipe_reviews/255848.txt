Really good salad. I used dijon mustard in the dressing, as I don't buy chipotle mustard. I also used all wild rice and mixed greens instead of just kale. The directions say to cook the wild rice 30-45 minutes, but it actually needs about 60 minutes to cook, so just keep in that in mind. I toasted the walnuts before I added them to the salad too. Very yummy! Thank you for the recipe!
