This was a fun change from bread crumbs.  Since other reviewers mentioned blandness, I added some powdered ranch dressing mix to the flour and it was good.  I also just used an egg wash because I did not have any sour cream.  My one-year-old loved it.

I am searching for a good recipe for chicken nuggets and this is so not it!  Very tasteless breading.  Not worth the effort.

These were very crispy, moist and tender, but I'm gonna have to agree with the others that said that these were bland. If we weren't dipping them ,they basically had no flavor at all. I do like the idea of this though, so I will def be playing around with seasonings for these. Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely delicious! I added in a package of a seasoning mix from a hamburger helper. (I only needed the noodles at the time.)
