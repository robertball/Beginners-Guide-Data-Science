I have gotten raves for these cookies.  I made according to recipe and they were delicious.  I've had several people tell me that these are the best chocolate chip cookies they have ever eaten.

Sorry, but I found these cookies to be too heavy and flavourless.  I think it's the large amount of whole wheat flour that causes this.

These are great! I sub applesauce for half the butter, cookies don't come out quite as moist but still wonderful and with less fat.

It left me with a mess. I had to over-cook it just to scrape off the melted mass and then chip it off the cookie tray. I followed the recipie to the letter. DO NOT MAKE THIS!

This were really, really yummy. I halved the recipe since 6-8 dozen seemed like a lot of cookies, and while I'll admit I only had unbleached all-purpose flour, I would still say this recipe halves well. I didn't experience any of the dryness others mentioned (be sure to let the butter soften before use).  The cookies came off cleanly from my pans, including my normal aluminum pan. 
The dryness and difficulty cleaning people had mentioned almost turned me off this recipe but with no such difficulties I'm glad I made it.

These were very good. I like the whole wheat flour. It makes the cookies healthier, and in my opinion, tastier. Very good recipe. I think these would also be good as oatmeal scotchies--replacing the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.

These cookies were so dry and bland. I had to add 2 TBSP of oil so all the oats and flour could be moistened and the mixture would stick together.

I think this is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I have ever tried. They are moist and yummy. My picky husband ate them up in no time. I think it's is a healthier twist on a traditional cookie.

I just made this recipe, except that I halved it and made it into bars in a 9x13 pan. I did add extra chocolate but other than that made it as written and they turned out really good! Next time I might add a bit less sugar as they taste pretty sweet to me but I will definately be making these again.

Recipe is awesome as is! I halved the recipe since I really didnt need that many cookies. 1st time I made as is except a little less flour, as the batter got thick.  2nd time I made it a little bit healthier.  I used half butter/half applesauce, used 2 egg whites & 1 whole egg and used 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar & 1/4 cup splenda.  I still used less flour. it does take 10-12 minutes to bake.  It was just as tasty this way. Very yummy recipe!

These are ok. The dough tastes amazing. The cookies are good too, but they are extremely hard to get off the pan and the middle is still kind of soft. I don't know if I will make these again.

I followed the directions exactly except added more chocolate chips, because I love chocolate.  I think this will be my go to recipe for cookies from now on.  My whole family loved them and there was plenty to share with friends and neighbors.

HUGE waste of supplies, and this recipe calls for a lot of them.  I'm an accomplished baker and cook and I did everything right.  I ended up with a 1/4 inch sheet of flat mess.  I'll have to peel them up and use this mess for something.  Maybe they meant 4 tsp of baking powder instead of soda?  Look for a different recipe.

Made the cookies as instructed and they came out well...but not great.  They were good but have not a whole lot of experience with baking thus I may not have followed best practices...I think I'll stick to cooking and leave the baking to others!

I thought these sounded good boy was i wrong!:(  They stick to the pan something awful and have WAY to much baking soda I didn't even use the full amount and my kids only like them because of the choc.  They even said it tasted funny.  Don't bother with these they are not worth waisting your choc on.

I thought these had a very good texture.  They were crisp outside and chewy/soft inside (not cake-like).  They had a nice thickness to them -- not too thick or too thin.  They did have quite a strong whoe wheat taste to them.  I happen to like whole wheat, but for the average person, that might be a turn off.  the good amount of chocolate chips helps, though.  Anyway, nice recipe.  Thanks!

These are great! I'm not sure what some of these other people did wrong but mine turned out perfect! took them to work and they were gone in a flash. I love finding recipes that are semi- healthy. I'm going to try substituting some butter for applesauce next time, or maybe some peanut butter! That might be good too. Chocolate , oatmeal, and peanut butter! Sounds tasty to me. Thanks for the great recipe, Robin!

This is a good oatmeal cookie, but looking at the photo, I was expecting a ticker and chewier cookie. It  came out light and fluffy. I am going to try again with a little less flour and little more oats.

I picked this recipe because it used less butter than most I had seen. These turned out very well! I halved the recipe as I didn't have enough of the ingredients and it still made a lot of cookies! (About 54 cookies!). I followed it exactly (except I used all purpose - white flour) and the taste and texture are wonderful. This recipe is a keeper.

My daughter is allergic to dairy and egg. So I substituted dairy free margarine for the butter, and used applesauce for the egg. I cut the recipe in thirds, which called for 1 2/3 cup oats. I used only 1 cup, and I think the consistency was perfect! They did take longer to bake, but it may have been b/c I did them on a stone. I may turn them up to 350 next time. But I thought these were perfectly delicious, and a healthier option for chocolate chip cookies.

I liked this cookie. I exchanged 1/3 of the brown sugar with white sugar and added walnuts. With the whole wheat and the oats it is a more wholesome version of the usual cookie but but as a nutritionist I feel that there is no such thing as a healthy cookie.

Definitely a hearty cookie, but virtually tasteless. Perhaps it would make a nice side for ice cream, but as far as I'm concerned, by itself, this recipe is a total bust.

Yummy! There are oatmeal raisin fans and oatmeal chocolate chip fans in my family so I divided the cookie dough and put raisins in half instead of chocolate chips. It tasted great! This will become a favorite recipe!

I made these cookies two different times.  The first time, they turned out a bit dry (but still delicious), I think because I wasn't careful enough when mixing the wet/dry ingredients together.  The second time I made them, I was more careful and the cookies were FABULOUS.  I put just a tad bit less whole wheat flour in than the recipe called for. I will definitely make these again.

We think these are great!  I made 3 dozen as cookies and used the rest in a 9x9 as a bar cookie (baked for 30-35 minutes at 350).  Both are wonderful and I don't feel as guilty since there are oats and whole wheat flour and no oil or shortening.  I added cinnamon and additional chocolate chips which made them even better.  I always bake cookies on stoneware so I did have to cook them longer and then have them sit on the stoneware before removing them.  But, I will definitely keep this recipe handy!

This recipe didn't make nearly as many cookies as it claimed.  Mostly, because we ate most of the dough before we got them into the oven.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and used regular oats instead of the quick-cook and they turned out just smashing!

Very good. I made them as cookie-bars since it's so much easier. They turned out just a little bit muffin-like, but I think the key is to make sure to undercook them just slightly to avoid this.

This probably my most favourite cookie ever. It tastes awesome, its healthy and its soo easy to make. I always substitute half of the brown sugar for splenda to reduce calories.

The best!  I cautiously made only 1/2 the recipe, but next time I'll make the whole recipe.  I did sub more unbleached flour for part of the wheat flour as I feared they would be too heavy - but they weren't.  Next time I'll try more wheat flour.  Thanks for sharing!

This is my “go to” chocolate chip cookie recipe! It is the best. The whole wheat flour gives them a great taste. If I don’t have whole wheat flour, I use rice flour. Sometimes I add walnuts to this recipe and they are just amazing! I get a lot of compliments on them, and my family loves them! This recipe is easy to half if you don’t have enough ingredients.

The cookie tasted good, but was dry. I suggest you cut back on the dry ingredients. I added oil and more butter, resulting in minimal improvement.

The changes I made was using all purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of butter. These were by far the best cookies I've ever made! I've been looking for a recipe where mine didn't come out dry. Baked to perfection in 12 minutes (I dropped mine by tablespoonfuls) and lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper. I also cut the recipe in half. It made 24 cookies. They are delicious!

I quartered the recipe - didn't need 96 cookies. These were amazing! The dough looked dry and slightly crumbly when I got everything mixed together, but I decided to proceed and bake them. I baked them at 325 for 10 minutes and pulled them out. The cookies were soft, but I transferred them to a plate to cool. They set up nicely, and are crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy in the middle. This is my new favorite recipe! I believe the softened butter is the trick. I have never made cookies that turned out so well! Off to have some more now! Thank you for sharing!!

These were delicious! I didn't have white sugar so I just used all brown, real butter (of course), and I added just a little extra vanilla (just because I like it.) Good enough to be hand written into my family cook book! Looking forward to playing with variations now. :)

These cookies were very good and easy to make. I an not fond of whole wheat flour, so I changed the flour amounts to 1 cup regular flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat. The cookies took about 14 minutes to bake, and the batter was delicious, but thick. A good cookie recipe.

These were decent. I took them to work with me, and all the guys in my office ate them up, including the site director! They tasted much better and actually stayed together after sitting for 1-2 days. Don't eat them while they're still hot...all the chocolate chips fall out.

I cut this recipe in half, and added 3/4 of the sugar it asked for. I added about 1/4 cup of orange juice and about a half a teaspoon of grated orange rind as well as 1/3 a cup of dried cranberries. THEY TASTED AMAZING!!!! Thanks for the recipe!
