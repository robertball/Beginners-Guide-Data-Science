Somewhat time-consuming, but worth it. We really enjoyed it. Five stars.

Made half the recipe in 8x12 glass dish (plenty).  Boiled the noodles first (drained well).  Used leftover corned beef (diced).  Used more milk so saucier and added a little horseradish to sauce (less mustard).  Tossed cubed rye bread with melted butter and put on top.  Baked at 350 for 25 mins and voila!  Perfect!  We loved it.

Great recipe!  I'm not the big fan of Reuben sandwiches--my boyfriend is. But, even I really liked this!  I toasted some rye bread for croutons while the oven was preheating--I didn't even crush them into crumbs.  Also, I didn't rinse the sauerkraut--I wanted a stronger taste.  THIS IS GREAT!

I am sorry to rate this so low but we thought it was awful!  I followed the recipe exactly, thinking what a great way to use up the St. Patrick's leftovers.  We love Reuben sandwiches so I don't know what the problem is.  I ate my portion, but my husband wouldn't eat his after the first few bites.  Broke my heart with all those ingredients, especially the Swiss cheese.  Sorry-

Yum!  I used a lot more rye bread cubes--maybe half of a loaf--and did not crush them.  I think you get more of a crunchy rye bread taste that way.  I also used more cheese, about 3 cups.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Great recipe if you like sauerkraut.

This was interesting. With half the reviews being good and half of them being bad, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I figured since this recipe made it into the Tried & True Allrecipes Cookbook, it couldn't be THAT bad.  I was right.  I followed the recipes exactly and it turned out just fine.  I didn't pre-cook the noodles or anything. Definitely double up on the topping. I used 3 or 4 slices of rye bread and it wasn't enough.

UGH!  If you truly love reubans this recipe is definitely not for you -- there's no mushroom taste in a reuben and the egg noodles were awful.  I haven't rated too many recipes low but this one definitely deserved the 2 stars.

This recipe was great! I did make a few changes though. Based on other reviews, I decreased the sauerkraut to 1 1/2 cans. I also cooked the noodles before baking, and used 1 tbsp regular mustard and 2 tbsp dijon mustard. 3/4 cup of bread crumbs is not enough, so next time I think I will use 2 cups. I ended up cooking it for about 30 min. covered and 10 uncovered. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious recipe!  I doubled the bread crumbs and butter and next time might make a little more sauce because it wasn't as runny as a good Rueben sandwich is.  I split the dish in half and gave one half to a friend and froze the other.  It froze beautifully.  This is a definite keeper!

I made this for a group and they all liked it. I'm giving it three stars because of a bunch of edits.  Some changes I made:  Used one can sauerkraut, this was just right. Then I substituted cream of chicken for the mushroom soup because I feared that the mushroom would taste too strong with the other flavors. This turned out well. I also used more onion. The egg noodles were cooked for about 5 minutes, and I put some of the soup mixture right on top of the sauerkraut and then layered the noodles on to integrate the flavors better.  Changes I would make next time:  More rye bread - I made about 2 cups of cubed bread but it still wasn't enough. It just speckled the cheese on top, but you couldn't taste the rye bread flavor. I'd also add more corned beef.

My family loved this dish.  I did precook the noodles and added thousand island dressing.  I doubled the amount of bread and would probably add more next time.

Husband loves this recipe! He says it gets better as it sits.  I did add a whole onion chopped, a heaping tablespoon horseradish, 12-16 ounces sliced swiss cheese & ten slices of rye bread buttered then cubed & put on top of cheese.  This is the second time I've made this.

This was pretty tasty but you can't beat a traditional Reuben sandwich! I used some very strong English mustard, so I added some Thousand Island dressing for sweetness, and a more authentic Reuben taste. I boiled the pasta for 5 or so minutes so that it had softened a little. I halved the recipe, but thought that one can of sauerkraut was too much. I might make this again, but with less 'kraut and a little more cheese. Thanks, Sierra!

Fabulous!!!  My husband & I stuffed ourselves on this last night. I made it in a deep baking dish that was a bit smaller than 9x13.  Some changes I made were: used 1 can sauerkraut, pre-cooked the egg noodles, increased to 3 cups Swiss cheese, tore rye bread into tiny pieces and fried them in butter and then topped casserole with them.

I made half of this recipe in a 9x9 pan.  I used one 8 oz. package of sliced corn beef; one 15 oz. can of sauerkraut; four slices of rye bread cubed, not crushed; and I cooked my whole wheat noodles al dente before adding to the recipe.  I thought this was flavorful and the key was keeping the bread in a cube form.  Thanks for the tasty dish.

I kept asking myself why I didn't just make a reuben sandwich. This was pretty messy & we ended up slopping it on rye bread and eating like a sandwich. Doubt I'll make this again.

Hmm. I love reubens, but I didnt' really like this, particularly the egg noodles (maybe it's just the brand I bought).  The noodles came out soggy (cooked dead, but still raw tasting), and indistinguishable from the sauerkraut.  Also, the Grey Poupon mustard was too heavy.  I will either put less next time, or try French's.  The rest of the casserole is really good though (the butter crumbs on top).

This was awesome. I added more onion (1/2 cup total), I used 16 oz corned beef, provolone cheese instead of swiss, and I put in 2 cups of the bread and kept them cubed. However, based on other reviews, I cooked the noodles ahead of time, and I was only able to fit about 1/2 of them in the baking dish (13x9). So I only used about 4 oz of noodles. Next time I will double the bread (to make 4 cups) since that was the best part! Although, I think I will cut the recipe in half. We had a whole half pan left over!

Excellent!  I no trouble with the noodles...  just pushed them down into the saurkraut so they sat at the bottom of the dish in the liquid.  I agree it needs more bread crumbs.. and cubes would be just fine/easier.

Really good and easy.  I followed the advice of other reviewers: drained sauerkraut but did not squeeze, preboiled the noodles, cubed bread and left it that way and doubled the butter.  The proportions were perfect.  I would change nothing else.

It was easy--and it oven cooks for an hour so plenty of time to leave it and do other things.  I used mild sauerkraut and reduced it just a little (15 oz. cans).  I had no trouble at all with the noodles, but frankly I eyeballed them and they worked out to a single even layer, so I think maybe this is a recipe you have to use the perfect sized baking dish for.  I also didn't squeeze-drain my sauerkraut, just drained it loosely and had plenty of liquid.  Used a little extra bread--just cubed instead of crushed--and was glad I did.

My family LOVES this dish; I have made it at least 5 times by now.  The only problem I had was some of the noodles not getting saturated enough to soften; they were still uncooked - I simply cooked the noodles while I was assembling the other ingredients and cut the cooking time down to 25-30 minutes.  This is a keeper - it is already typed up and in my recipe book to pass down to my kids!!  Thanks!

My husband loved this dish. (He's crazy about Reubens.) I added a heaping Tbls of horseradish 1/2 cup of onions and also cubed ten slices of rye bread with a little over a cube of melted butter.  Prep time was 30 to 40 minutes.

This was a very different casserol.  I prefer a lot more rye bread that the original, so I cubed about 7 pieces of bread and rather than crush, I left them cubed. But otherwise, very easy to follow and nice for a change.

I made this for St. Patty's and it was fabulous. Add a bit more butter to the bread crumbs.

Absolutely amazing! I did follow the recipe for the main stuff but changed a few things. I love Reuben sandwiches but I always order them with a different white cheese because I do not like Swiss. So for this recipe I used a blend of shredded mozzarella and provolone. I also love 1000 island in the sandwich so I had to put that in. I hate mustard so I changed from mustard to 1000 island. I used a half cup of it because I really like it. I made more breadcrumbs as previous reviewers suggested. The result was one of the most amazing casssaroles I have ever made! I think I like it better than the Reuben sandwich!

VERY tasty!  It is a great way to use leftover corned beef and tastes just like a reuben sandwich.

I really like Reuben sandwiches and I thought I would like this more than I did.   It is good and my wife liked it a more than I did.   I can't quite put my finger on what is missing or wrong.   Next time I will try a little more corned beef and a little less sauerkraut.

Good recipe!  I will make again, but will serve with Rye toast or add more coarsly crumbled Rye cubes on top - otherwise it is just like eating the filling out of a Reuben sandwich and seems like it's missing something.

I love reuben sandwiches! This is a close substitute...casserole style. My daughter wasn't too keen on the sauerkraut but ate the rest. However, I reduced the mustard by half. It would have been too much had I used the amt required.

I have made this recipe many times now.  We love it.  I do a little tweaking.  I use a little extra beef and cheese, and alot of bread crumbs.  I also buy a large aluminum deep-dish casserole pan so everything fits good.

I brought this to a Hot Dish contest and won 1st Prize!!
I followed other reviewer's advice and used 16 oz corned beef, 3 cups of Swiss, boiled the noodles for 4 minutes, and 3/4 a loaf of rye bread...and kept it cubed.

This recipe was so so.  I love reubens but this recipe needed more corned beef.  plus, the noodles were still crunchy in some spots and I even cooked it longer than the recipe called for.  Too much mustard, and not enough rye bread on top.  I think that it would be better if the noodles were pre cooked, more beef and rye bread, and less mustard.  I will try to make it again though with the adjustments!  :-)

Easy, delicious!  I also cooked the noodles while preparing the rest and cut cooking time to 35 minutes.  Used cream of celery instead of mushroom.  Used about 5 large slices of rye bread.  Really makes a lot - would be a fun, different dish to bring to a dish to pass party.  Thanks!!

Very tasty, satisfying meal.  As recommended by most other reviewers, I used more rye bread than shown (I cubed a whole loaf of rye bread for the topping).  My mods: I used deli-sliced provolone cheese instead of swiss cheese, tripled the onion, poured 1/2 water over the noodle-layer (to make sure they all cooked), used 1/2 more milk than shown, and left out the sauerkraut.  It was fabulous!

I used turkey pastrami and reduced fat cream soup, and it still tasted great. I even used homemade rye bread! You have to be a fan of sauerkraut though, b/c the tanginess can be overwhelming, but I love a good reuben sandwich, so I'm not afraid. It makes a ton though, so be prepared for the leftovers!

Turned out so good. Made a little extra sauce and added an additional cup of cheese. Also extra crumbs with only a light crush for extra texture.

Instead of the sandwich style corn beef use a corn beef brisquit.... It's time consuming but the day b4 u plan to cook put the cornbread in crook pot and cook on low. So much better.. Everyone asks for more.

The noodles were a globs and hard clumps.  I think it would have been better if the soups were mixed with the sauerkraut and the noodles cooked a little.  I will not try this again.  I think this is a smear campaign against wonderfully made Reuben sandwiches!

I substituted 1can cream of chicken soup and 1can cream of potato soup for the 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Then, I only used 1 can of sauerkraut, and crumbled saltine crackers on top rather than the rye bread crumbs putting them on for the last 10 minutes. The prep time was really short once I dropped the rye bread topping. My husband and I really enjoyed it! The kids aren't big fans of sauerkraut so they only tolerated it.

I like this recipe, because it is a change from the ordinary, yet delicious.  I modify it by doubling the corn beef and rye bread.  Then, I keep the bread in cubes after drying it. One suggestion--if using very heavy egg noodles (like kluski), make sure to boil first, and reduce the milk

Very good.  Kraut doesn't overpower the other tastes.  I used pork kielbasa and my family loved it.

Excellent!  I took this to a picnic and everyone loved it!  Would definately use more bread crumbs next time since you couldn't taste a whole lot of the rye bread which I love.  A definate keeper.
