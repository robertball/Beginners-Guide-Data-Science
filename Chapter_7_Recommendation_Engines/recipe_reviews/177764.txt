Good recipe. I used taco sauce instead of salsa, and served with cilantro and chopped tomatoes.

I had a sheet of puff pastry that I needed to use before it dried out and this seemed like a fun recipe. I cooked my chicken breasts in the crock pot with taco seasoning and just enough water to keep it moist. I used chunky salsa, substituted cilantro for the parsley and also added some lime juice and a can of drained black beans. Very good served over a mix of field greens, spinach and cherry tomatoes, and then topped with guacamole and sour cream.

Was easy to make. I used some leftover mexican rice that I had on hand instead of the bread crumbs.

This is a great recipe! I cooked the chicken is cajun spices with onions. I also added black olives and green onions to the mix. Instead of bread crumbs I used Panko. It turned out really yummy. I will make this again.
