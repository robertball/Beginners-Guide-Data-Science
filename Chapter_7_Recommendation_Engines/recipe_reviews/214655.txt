This is our favorite snack! I always get asked for the recipe. Try using Synder's of Hanover "Hot Buffalo Wing" pretzel pieces for some extra kick.
I cut the hot sauce down to just a tablespoon, still hot but not so overwhelming. I use Hidden Valley dry ranch mix and definitely DO NOT leave out the celery seed, it makes this great.
For perfect texture the trick is to bake the mix. So preheat oven to 350. Mix together cereal, pretzels, goldfish. Melt butter in microwave then stir into it the last three ingredients (1 tbs. hot sauce though). Pour over cereal mixture, stir. Bake in a deap BIG pan for 15 min, take out stir throughly, then bake for 15 more. Take out stir and allow to cool completely.
This stuff rocks!

I've made this several times now and it's always a hit. Instead of packaged ranch dressing mix, I make my own from scratch, I suggest using Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix which is also on this site. Hers has no salt which is good in this recipe because you get enough salt with the Goldfish and pretzels. I always use Frank's hot sauce and some times, I'll cut back on the goldfish by a cup and add in some dry roasted peanuts or almonds. NOTE: I do not use celery seed. We don't care for it.

I liked the flavor, however VERY disappointed with the resulting texture. I'm not sure why Chex advises you to microwave. The cereal clumped together and was hard and stale tasting after only 3 minutes in the microwave, even stirring at 1 1/2 minutes. I will try this again, but I will BAKE in the oven on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 300 for 10-15 minutes, rather than microwave.

This was a delicious mix I made for my Fiance when he went away for a business trip. I was not about to buy a $5 box of wheat chex so I instead used the rice chex (8C total). I recommend using unsalted pretzels though because the mix is pretty salty. Beyond those changes, it was ridiculously fabulous and will be making it again soon.

I use a homemade ranch dressing mix so that I can control the amount of sodium.  Also, I heard that Chex just came out with a box of mixed flavors of chex so that you don't have to buy 3 kinds to make the chex recipes.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I wasn't sure how it would be with all the ranch dressing, but it wasn't too overpowering.  I didn't have celery seed so I added a little celery salt (not 2 tsp though).  I ended up using cheddar goldfish and pretzel goldsifh and then added sea salt bagel chips as well.  This was a nice change from the usual chex mix.

Sorry, but this was very bland. If you want spicy chex mix, add some Frank's to the original recipe, along with extra Worchestershire. I definitely won't be making this again.

YUM! 1st attempt ever at making Chex Mix. Read many reviews and opted to bake instead of microwave at 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Forgot to add the celery seed - opps! To make sure it was plenty spicy, I used Frank's EXTRA HOT sauce and it's perfect.

Really good! Not as spicy as I would have hoped. I didn't use the celery seed, and I only used corn chex...was a little too salty but not bad for a party mix!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I was expecting more Buffalo flavor.  Instead it was kind of blah.  I will experiment wit adding more Frank's sauce to see if that helps.  I used the "old" oven method as well, I don't really care for the microwaved version.

I used 3 Tbl of hot sauce and added an extra 2 Tablespoons of Buffalo wing sauce.  I only used 3/4 tsp of celery seed and that was MORE than enough.  It was still on the bland side and I couldn't taste the ranch flavoring.  If you eat a lot of it then you can taste the heat.

This is so good I did change a few things. I used 3 1/2 tablespoon of hot sauce(I used Franks Hot Buffalo sauce). I also used a Dill Ranch dressing mix and no celery seed. I will have to make more, I have already eaten half and it hasn't even cooled off yet!

I made this for the holiday season and no one really was that thrilled with it. It was not that flavorful even though I added extra ranch seasoning. I will be sticking with regular chex mix next time.

I used about 1.5 more tbs of hot sauce (I used Franks hot sauce) for extra heat.  I also used celery salt instead of celery seed and unsalted butter.  For the pretzels and crackers I used Annie's Organic Snack Mix Bunnies (3 Cups) and added 2 C of dry roasted peanuts.  It came out good, had kick and didn't taste salty.

Surprisingly bland.  I even added more hot sauce than the recipe called for, and it did not kick up the flavor at all.  I used homemade ranch dressing mix, but apparently this needs the additional sodium of the packaged ranch mix.  I used generic "chickadee" crackers for added irony, and baked instead of microwaved.  I won't make this again.

I like the idea of this recipe, but I found I had to make changes for it to come out right. It is VERY salty. I haven't yet, but next time I will use unsalted butter. Also, one other reviewer suggested unsalted pretzels...an excellent idea. Microwaving did not work for me...I used the old tried-and-true oven method and the mix actually got crispy instead of weirdly limp in places. I used Frank's Extra Red Hot and kept in the celery seeds, but I'd caution people about those. I like them, but biting into a few at once is kind of overpowering. Next time I will try a homemade ranch mix to cut back on salt. I did also add in some mixed nuts because I like that variety. Over all, I would make this again, but only with these changes.

This is my favorite Chex Mix.  I made it last year for Thanksgiving to snack on while cooking everything else.  I used all 1 kind of Chex so I didn't have to buy multiple boxes of cereal.  I had no problem with the microwave method and it had plenty of flavor (and spice) for us.  Can't wait to make it again this year, I see it becoming a tradition!

This was good, but not one of our favorite Chex Mix recipes.  The buffalo flavor is about right for us, but the Wheat Chex were a little chewy, not crispy like I think they should be.  I will stick with some of the other Chex Mix recipes.

Good little snack. I used 6 C generic corn squares, 2 C cheez squares, 2 C pretzels, and 2 C peanuts. After stiring the dry ingredients with the butter mixture, spread it onto a large pan. Bake in 5 min intervals at 200 degrees for about 20 mins total. Then do 5 mins at 400 to give it some crunch.

I was so excited to try this and then ended up so disappointed.  DO NOT MICROWAVE!  Turned everything into mush.  I increased the amount of hot sauce and was still so so.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because I'm going to try again with more sauce and use the oven

I tried this a few times trying to find the right combination of celery seed.  It was always way too overpowering and I will leave it out if I ever make it again.  I feel like it could be good if left out.

I was disappointed with this recipe, probably won't make again. I used the homemade ranch mix to cut down on the salt, used Snyder's of Hanover's buffalo pretzel bits, and I baked in the oven instead of using the microwave.  However, I didn't feel it had enough kick (I used the amount of hot sauce recommended)    Watch out for the celery seed though, I cut mine down to 3/4 a teaspoon and that was plenty, you definitely can taste it and I think any more would be overpowering.  Update:  I actually thought it had better taste right out of the oven, 5 days later my family hasn't eaten most of it, will stick to the original chef mix recipe next time.

Love this mix. Not sure why people have problems microwaving it. It comes out perfect for me every time. I do cut back celery seed 1.5 tsp and up the hot sauce to 3.5 Tlbs. Last time make it I couldn't find parmesan flavored crackers at the store and used mozarella flavored instead. I like these better and will probably make that a permanent change.

I didn't have celery seed so used celery salt..worked out fine. I also baked after I mixed the sauce in at 250 for 45min. I stirred/moved it around on cookie sheet every 15 min. It's awesome! Has a nice kick to it.

This was good. The longer it sits, the hotter it gets! A little too much celery seed but that can be easily corrected. Still not as good as the original, but I'd make it again.

Almost chickened out making this- lousy reviews!  However, I did and I love it!  I regret holding back on the celery seed - next time, I shall do the whole thing.  Doubled the hot sauce and put in worcestershire.

Make this for every party. Huge hit. I use corn Chex instead of wheat and Parmesan (gold) fish crackers. I also put extra hot sauce in.

We baked in the oven until cruncy. I missed cheese crackers, so I added them and used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Sauce. It still needs something...

This is best made in the oven.  I did it the old fashioned way.  Melted the butter in the baking pan as the oven preheated to 250 degrees.  I then mixed in the spices, the dressing mix and the hot sauce.  Tossed in the dry ingredients and baked for 1 hour stirring every 15 min.   YUMMY

After over toasting my first batch of chex mix I went looking for another recipe that included ingredients I had on hand.  What a lucky mistake for me.  I found this recipe and a review that suggested using dill dip mix instead of ranch and as odd as I thought that sounded I had dill dip mix in the pantry.  The fresh pop of dill balances the saltiness of the mix and you get just a bit of heat at the end.  Not being a big fan of microwave cooking I baked this in the oven at 250 for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.  Everyone loved this even people who don't care for the usual party mix.
