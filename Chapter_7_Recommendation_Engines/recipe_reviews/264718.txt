Made to recipe but morning showed mixture too soggy.  Had to strain out soupy mess.  Added cubes of crusty bread and 2 beaten eggs.  Mixed well.  Added more berries with cinnamon vanilla and sugar.  Baked at 375 for one hour.  Better ... edible at least.

I'd call this more of a custard than a traditional overnight French toast, but it was delicious.  After reading other reviews, I modified as follows:
*I used plain dinner rolls instead of the sweeter ones in this recipe.
*I used 2% milk instead of almond milk (2 1/2 cups instead of 3)
*I used 1/2 a cup of sugar instead of 2/3
*I put blops of cream cheese (about 1/4 cup total) on top before baking.
*I baked this covered for 1 hour and then uncovered for an additional 10 minutes.  No sogginess in the middle at all after that.

way too sweet.  I would omit the sweet rolls and use regular bread and also too much milk . Mixture was too soupy and not custard like.

This did not turn out well at all, cooked it for almost 2 hours and it was soup in the middle, it is way to much liquid, make this at your own risk

Tastes great! It’s more of a bread pudding in my opinion; baked for almost 1.5 hours and still sipping wet in the middle, and I didn’t even use all the almond milk concoction to begin with.

It did not say whether to cook it covered, or uncovered, so I baked it covered for most of the time and then took off the foil for the last part to crisp up. I guess if you want it so if you would leave the foil on.
