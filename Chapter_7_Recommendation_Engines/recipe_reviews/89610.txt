I actually made this as a main dish for my daughter. I added in some basil and oregano and only used the juice of half a very large lemon. I also sprinkled some parm over it just before serving. My daughter liked this and said she would definitely eat it again but did say she would like a little less lemon juice next time. Thanks.

This recipe has it all.  Great taste, low fat, easy to prepare, ingredients most cooks would have on hand, and colorful in appearance.  You could easily substitute other vegetables.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!  My family loved it.  I added a pinch of sugar to mild the taste a bit.  It was also good as leftovers.

8/15/07 *original review*Wow, so good! I didn't have any orzo, so I substituted acini de pepe which I had left over from making italian wedding soup. Everything blends together so well; this is a refreshing side dish. Thanks AMULHERN. *EDIT* I made this again using orzo, and also added a bit more garlic. I love this dish, and found the leftovers are just delightful too!

The cooking of the veggies took away their fresh flavor.  I believe this would have tasted best wiith raw veggies with the vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice and seasonings used as a dressing.

This recipe was OK, but nothing special. I cut the oil in half---glad I did or it would have been too greasy. I threw away my left overs.

I used maybe 1/4 cup of white onion, I omitted the garlic (but used a couple shakes of garlic powder with the salt and pepper), and I added 1 stalk of celery, chopped, and Â½ cup or so of broccoli florets. And this turned out just okay. My husband was not thrilled, and my daughter wouldn't touch it (although she enjoyed the plain buttered orzo I saved for her). Once we added some soya sauce to our plates, this dish was MUCH better. It saved the recipe. :) Thanks, AMulhern, you made me aware that I could interchange rice and orzo sometimes!

Great!  I didn't have any lemon juice so I just omitted it.  Just before I served it I put in two TBS of fresh parmesan and it was GREAT!  My family loved it and it was super easy to make.

Very good! I added fresh vegetables that I had on hand- asparagus and peppers. I used some soy sauce on the adult dishes and Parmesan on the kids dishes. Paired it with fresh baked Haddock. Nice light meal.

Really good, added yellow squash and cooked my orzo in vegetable broth instead of water for more flavor.  The balsamic vinegar and lemon juice really make it pop.  Will make this again

i've had a bag of orzo in the pantry for a while but never knew what to do with it. decided to make this along w/the awesome baked sea scallops from this site. personally, i loved it as is. the balsamic vinegar provided enough flavor for me. my husband thought it could have used some additional seasoning. i did sprinkle just a tiny bit of parm on it, then decided i didn't want to over-fatten something that was relatively healthy, especially with those scallops. i would definitely make it again, though maybe throw in some herbs and/or spices for my DH.

This was delicious. It was simple to make and was light and flavorful. The first few bites were a surprise as the dish was VERY tangy. But the dish grew on both my husband and I. I would use half of the lemon that is called for next time and add some Parmesan cheese to cut the tang.

I made a couple substitutions because my pantry is never stocked well (rice instead of orzo, and balsamic dressing instead of vinegar), but overall I liked this recipe and will try it again with the real stuff.  It was quick and easy.

This dish made me realize that I don't really like balsamic vinegar unless it's in salad dressing. It was too strong for me. I might retry this recipe with a lot of modifications. Thanks anyway.

It was good, but a bit too lemony.  I'm sure this can be a fantastic dish once tweaked a bit.

I tried this dish with some couscous I had on hand and it turned out great. I later tryed the dish again and actual used orzo and it did not taste as good. some sea salt and ground pepper can bring the dishes flavor out.

It was okay--it wasn't great, it wasn't bad.  I thought the lemon was a little strong, although I liked the balsamic vinegar flavor.  Many who rated this highly have added ingredients to the recipe as it's written, and perhaps it needs them to make it better.

Instead of cooking the orzo ahead, I sautÃ©ed the vegetables, then added 2 cups of uncooked orzo to the sautÃ© pan. I then added 3 cups of chicken broth and cooked until the liquid disappeared. It made a creamy side dish that everyone loved.

L.O.V.E this recipe!!!!! And I love the fact you can add what ever kind of vegetable you want. It's so versatile. The balsamic vinegar brings it all together. I'll definitely make again and will pass this on to my friends. Thank you!

I really liked this!!  I used Vidalia onion instead of red onion and it came out really well.  My one year old even ate it!!  If I wanted to use it as a main dish I think that I would load on some more zucchini and carrots though.

i used bell pepper instead of carrots (we had no carrots on hand) and sauteed everything in coconut oil, then added the olive oil as i added the final touches. i never follow measurements, but it came out delish! i wasnt sure what to expect, but ill definitely be making this again!
