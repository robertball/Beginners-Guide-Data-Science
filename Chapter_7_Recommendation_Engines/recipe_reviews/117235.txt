I upped the recipe to serve 12 for a Thanksgiving potluck. Results were great and the host and hostess were more than happy to keep the little that was left!

I tasted this at a Thanksgiving dinner put on by mys son's church last year. The chef was a retired restaurant owner and her sweet potatoes were the best I'd ever tasted! She was supposed to give her recipe to my daughter-in-law but didn't. When I read this recipe I felt it was as close to hers as I cold find. I substituted Cinnamon Vanilla Coffee Mate for the milk, added two teaspoons cinnamon and- it was beyond perfect. I'll make this often, believe me!

I have made this recipe at least 3 times now and love it so much that we are having it for Xmas dinner.  Even my family members who don't have a sweet tooth love it.  I have a sweet tooth and particularly love the topping, but the casserole itself doesn't taste too sugary.  I do reduce the sugar the recipe calls for slightly, but it would probably be fine if you use the full amount.

These are great Sweet Potato's for the holidays.  I have even used mini pumpkins as baking dish and stuffed them with this recipe for little individual sevings or used a large pumpkin as the baking dish for a little extra effect!

Loved it! First time I tried making it myself and this recipe is a keeper! I didnt have enough vanilla so I threw in a dash of mapline praline. Worked great! Easy, quick and came out better then I expected! Thanks for sharing!

Perfect for 2 people - other than 2 tablespoon egg. Don't over mash the potatoes like I did because then the consistency is like baby food. I used Lactaid milk instead of 2% since my husband is lactose intolerant. We enjoyed this easy and quick recipe.

This recipe was a hit with the whole family! I had a hard time finding pecans so instead i used a salad topping mixture of cranberries and pecans! It was awesome! I also added a bit of brown sugar to the potatoes themselves, not just in the topping.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Everyone loved it.  I had lost my recipe that I had for more than 10 years and this tasted just the same.  The only thing I did differently was that the butter in the topping should be semi-cold.  Otherwise it won't be crumbly.  It will turn out more like a batter....just saying from experience :)  Thank you for an AWESOME recipe that will be used for every Thanksgiving and other dinners as well.

I made this for a potluck, adjusted to 8 servings (used 2 eggs and a combination of skim milk and fat free half and half) and baked in an 8x8 pan.  I love that it's lighter than a typical sweet potato casserole.  Will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely wonderful!!  Our greatest problem was trying to decide whether it should be a vegetable or dessert.  We had it for both, but added a little ice cream for dessert!

simply amazing! I made this for our Thanksgiving feast and absolutely LOVED it! I plan on making this every Thanksgiving from here on out and a few times a year as well! The recipe is easy to follow and is not too sweet. I HATE canned sweet potoatoes/yams with marshmallows! This casserole is PERFECT!

A great recipe indeed. I added a few additional ingredients to give this a nice kick: 4 tbsp of disaronno amaretto, dash of cinnamon, and 1 tspn of vanilla butter nut extract. I also substituted the milk with half and half.

This was just ok, it may just be me though.  This is the first sweet potato casserole I've ever had and wasn't sure if I was going to like it because I'm not a sweet potato fan.  But since this recipe made a really small portion instead of a 9x13 I gave my tastebuds another go and it just wasn't for me.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, having never made sweet potatoes before, and it was a HUGE success!  One of my nephews who normally doesn't like sweet potatoes just raved about these.  So now I have a signature dish that's in demand when we get with my husband's family :)

This is the first time I made sweet potato casserole, and this recipe will definitely be used again. My husband could not get enough (although my kids were not to crazy about it). I loved it! It is sweet, almost like pie (which is what my husband liked to call the dish).

Always gets raves at Thanksgiving.  Would be a great dessert any time of year or side dish.  I did add some pumpkin pie spice to add some more zing.  May try a little vanilla next time also.  So much better then the icky marshmallow recipe that is traditionally used.  Great recipe!!

What is a 'large' sweet potato? I needed a recipe for 10; used 4 really large (giant) available yams (3-fisted size) and calculated the recipe for 10 (which said 5 large). Made a little extra topping; everything went great! Sweet enough, but not too sweet. No cooking spray; buttered the baking dish instead. Substituted raw sugar and organic brown sugar. Actually doubled all this & made 2 dishes so I have some after the feast for leftovers! Everyone appreciated the recipe for being 'just right'; i.e., not the sticky sweet marshmallow version.

This is a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner. I have cheated and used canned yams, but use fresh when I have time. Great recipe!

I love this recipe.. Every person at Thanksgiving dinner loved it too. I am pretty 'invisable' but at least 5 people raved about this recipe. I doubled the topping though :-)

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful!  I am not a huge fan of sweet potatoe but this was exceptional and easy.  I assembled the casserole at home, refrigerated it and then baked it for an hour later in the day.  Thanks for the recipe and I intend on making it for many years to come.

Sooo delicious and I'm not even a sweet potato fan! This side dish went great with my Valentines Dinner of Smothered Filet Mignon and Never Enough Green Bean Casserole (both on this site). Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. My fiance doesn't like sweet potatoes and he had two huge spoonfuls. The only thing I changed was that I left the potatoes a little chunky instead of mashing them completely. Excellent.

This recipe was very easy and made a delicious side dish. The color was kind of strange (I used sweet potatoes that were very light yellow). Yams may have made it look better. Overall though it was very good. Everyone had seconds.

This was a hit!  SO EASY.  I followed the recipe for 4 people.  Made a couple of minor changes....added a little pumpkin spice and used part milk and part half and half.  The topping is DELISH!

This has been my go to recipe for 8 years now!  I realized the date on my printed copy states, 11/20/2010!  My daughter requests this dish every holiday.  I highly recommend. I usually only make it for 6, but this year I need to make it for 15.  I came back to the recipe to adjust the ingredient quantity and thought  I would leave a review.  Thank you again for a great dish!!

I have made it as is and modified as well.
I prefer to not add any sugar as all.  Usually sweet potato casseroles are too sweet.  For the topping, I just put mini-marshmallows on top and broil. (makes it easier and we can't have nuts).
