This was really easy and one of the best dishes I have ever made. I lightened up the recipe using reduced fat cream cheese reduced fat cheddar cheese and instead of heavy cream I used fat free half and half. The healthier version turned out to be wonderful and each serving has about 300 calories 11 grams of fat and 35 grams of protein. I will for sure be making this again and again.

For a lighter version but no sacrifice on taste try fat free half and half. I use it always and can't tell the differance. Awesome!

Very good and quick. I added cumin and additional chili powder to add more "heat". The chicken was very tender and the sauce was the perfect consistency.

This was very good! I left out the Cheddar (on accident) and the mushrooms. Instead of enchilada sauce I used mexican seasonings and smoked paprika and kept it to the heavy cream and cream cheese for a thicker sauce. It came out great and was fantastic over rice! Can't wait for leftovers for lunch!

The recipe didn't specify to use red or green enchilada sauce - I used red b/c that's what I had. Just used whole can of sauce and next time I would just use the whole (1/2 lb) pkg of fresh sliced mushrooms. I omitted the chili powder because used HOT enchilada sauce and thought there would be enough spice (turned out great). This was simple and so delicious! Wonderful over rice to soak up that great sauce. Not very pretty to look at, so wouldn't serve to company though.

I made just as the recipe was written.  I have to say next time I would skip the mushrooms and add some cumin as some others have.  I used green enchilada sauce, which I did like.  Be sure to cook uncovered, otherwise it is too runny.

FIRST OF ALL, THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING JUST AS IS. I MAKE IT A DAY BEFORE I SERVE IT.  I DO NOT LIKE IT WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN HEAVY CREAM.   
The ingredients from this recipe also can be used to make a DELICIOUS enchilada cassarole. 

Simply make a sauce using DOUBLE THE AMOUNTS OF the softened cream cheese, canned chiles, chili powder, enchilada sauce and heavy cream, ADD 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder. Mix together in a sauce pan and stir together until all cream cheese is melted and sauce is well mixed, "don't cook sauce".  Use 3 cups of chopped cooked chicken.  I use left over bbq'd chicken or a store bought rotisserie chicken and it works great.  Make alternate layers using 8-10 flour tortillas,  sauce, cheddar cheese, and chicken.  Finish top layer with cheese and some black olives and bake 35-40 mins at 350.   You can either use or omit the mushrooms for the enchiladas, I do use them chopped very small.  Use as much or as little of the sauce on the cassarole to your liking.  Let this rest before serving or it falls apart.  As with everything this recipe is always better the second day.  Serve with your favorite rice and beans and/or salad.

Wow! The flavor of this sauce is awesome. I followed all of the directions except I used chicken leg quarters (as I didn't have any breasts). This is definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have any cream so used a little milk and it was still great. The recipe didn't specify red (probably meant red sauce) or green sauce so I used green it's my preference. It made a lot of sauce so I used some on baked potatoes the next night and on pasta the following night.

This was awesome! I didn't have enchilada sauce on hand so I combined taco sauce with some leftover tomato sauce and a splash or 2 of tapatio to sub. I browned my chickn breast withh S&P to seal in the juices before topping with the sauce mixture I also cooked the mushrooms in a little wine to draw out some of the liquid before topping the chicken with them and of course the cheese! Once this came out of the oven I garnished with some cilantro. Excellent sauce great new recipe for chicken goes great with mexican rice. Thanks for the recipe!

I made homemade enchilada sauce and doubled the mushrooms. We're a mushroom-y kind of family. I did add a bit of cilantro and lime juice. I think making your own enchilada sauce and fresh ingredients is key. This is quite good best paired with a good rice to help sop up the juices. I liked how easy it was to pull this together with items from my pantry/freezer without much stress even making the homemade sauce. I'll make this again for sure.

We really liked this one. It was super easy and delicious. My husband said it was restaurant quality. I actually didn't have half and half on hand so I substituted for whole milk and just didn't put as much in to try to keep the texture and it was still amazing. We cut it up and put it on rice like one reviewer suggested and it was a great way to use all the yummy sauce.

This was ok. I think next time I'll use green bell pepper instead of the mushrooms. I used fat free cream cheese and fat free milk to make it healthier.

This is a new favorite in my house! I did make some changes to cut down the fat and out of necessity and it still turned out wonderful. I'm overseas and don't have accress to green chilis or enchilada sauce so I substituted mild jalapenos and salsa (respectively). To cut down on the fat I used low fat cream cheese and reduced fat chedder and also whole milk instead of heavy cream - it was still wonderful and creamy! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was really tasty but needed some other vegetables or rice to go along with it. I should have thought of that before making it but it was just a little plain with just the chicken and the mushrooms. But it was super easy fast and tasty so that was great!

My family loved it and said it reminded them of our neigbours mexican chicken dish. To cut down on the fat I replaced the cream with skim milk and it was still very creamy. I replaced the canned chili with a fresh small jalapeno and browned the chicken. Yummy!!

Really good! I used Fat Free half and half to reduce the fat and it still had great flavor. I used Meundo Mix Chili in place of traditional chili powder. I omitted the mushrooms just because my family do not care for them. I am sure if you follow the recipe exactly as written it will come out great. I just wanted to make a few modification based on my personal preferences.

Very Good! I used 1 whole can green enchilada sauce a small can of mushrooms and light cream. The only thing I would change next time is to brown the chicken with a little garlic powder salt and pepper.

I skipped the mushrooms (hate them!! ick!! ick!) and this was incredible! Step-son who insists he doesn't like enchilada sauce ate half the pan. The rest of us would have too if he didn't beat us to it. I made it for the first time last week and am making it again tonight only tonight I'm making a double recipe!

This was a fabulous and EASY casserole dish. I used chipotle chili powder for a smoky taste and as recommended in another review used half and half in lieu of heavy cream. It was great!

I loved this dish. My only changes were I used unsweetened almond milk instead of heavy cream used a Mexican blend of cheese and added chipotle chili powder and cumin. I served it with homemade salsa a side of refried beans and lime/cilantro rice...it was restaurant quality. I couldn't wait to eat it the next day for lunch. The sauce is exquisite and my husband actually stood over the dish with a spoon and ate the sauce after he was finished with dinner! Thanks so much for sharing this one.

I thought this was ok but not something worthy of making again. With other reviewers stating it didn't come out looking very appealing I sprinkled the cheese on top instead of mixing it with everything else. I served this with a cilantro lime rice which complimented this well.

Oh wow - so good and easy! This is basically just a dump recipe but the flavor is more complex than that and the chicken is wonderfully tender. I used red enchilada sauce (we're not big on heat) and had to sub a can of mushroom pieces for the fresh and half-and-half for the heavy cream. Served over brown rice - very good!

The only real change I made was baking the chicken for 10 minutes longer than recommended and it was still very tender. I used medium red enchilada sauce this time but I'm curious to try it with the green sauce. All in all this recipe was delightfully different from our regular baked chicken recipes and it was quick and easy too!

This is great and EASY. It was somewhat bland on my first try so I added one can of hot Rotel and it worked much better. Next time I will try some cilantro for a different kick. Also a Mexican blend of cheeses gives more flair than plain cheddar. I used low fat half and half instead of heavy cream which was good although runny. Make sure cream cheese is very smooth to avoid clumps.

This really is very good however we were surprised how not spicy it is. Next time we will definitely use the medium or hot enchilada sauce if that's even enough. The cream and cream cheese really take out any of the heat in this dish. One more thing next time I will dice the chicken as the flavor is so much better when the sauce surrounds the chicken. With those changes (for me) this is a keeper! Thanks Kerri:)

Yummy! I loved it but my boyfriend hated it! No problem there more for me!:-) I used all the ingredients in the correct amounts but prepared it a different way becasue I was doing it ahead of time. I cooked the chicken seasoned with cumin and cayenne. When it was done I mixed all of the ingredients in the pan except the cheddar cheese. It cooled and when we were closer to ready to eat I mixed the cheese into the mix and baked it for 35 at 300 degrees. A slow bake to heat it through and melt the cheese. Really Good!

This recipe was fantastic!!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could. After it came out of the oven the chicken was so moist that I basically shredded it and mixed it all in with the sauce. I then served it over roasted potatoes that I had in the oven at the same time. It was amazing and I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow!!

I made this last night upon recommendation of a friend and I served with vigo yellow rice upon her recommendation. I actually made the yellow rice cut up the chicken once it was cooked and mixed it all together. It was very yummy but I think next time I will try cutting it up and serving it over white or brown rice for a variation.

This was excellent! I was drawn to the dish because Fierro was my mother's maiden name since she is a great cook this must be worth trying. Boy was I right! The only thing I would change is adding more mushrooms (if you like mushrooms). It was extremely easy and delicious!!! Definitely a repeat!

Really moist and flavorful. The chicken melted in your mouth. I agree with the others that this really didn't have enough kick. I used mild Enchilada sauce and next time will use hot It makes a ton of sauce so we served this over rice.

Awesome awesome awesome! So flavorful and very easy. I used reduced fat cream cheese (couldn't tell a difference) and omitted the mushrooms - although we love mushrooms it just sounded odd in the sauce. Oh and I used FF half and half. The sauce was very rich! I served alongside mexican rice (from a box) and black beans (from a can) - overall a super quick dinner. My fiance loved the extra sauce over the rice. It's not the prettiest dish but so delish!

This is a very tasty meal. I must agree that it is not very spicy and would use hot chilies if you're looking for a kick. The featured recipe makes A LOT of sauce probably a few more than 6 pieces of chicken are needed. I would also say that the sauce would be a huge hit at a party with some tostitos!!

I really enjoyed this meal but only gave it four stars because it was a bit too bland for me. I added jalopenos (fresh seeded sliced) which I think made the dish. I thought mushrooms sounded weird but they went perfect. Next time I will try to zest up the sauce a bit with some herbs.

This is fabulous... I made a few changes used 8 oz. neuchatel fat free half & half the whole can of enchilada sauce and a whole package of sliced mushrooms. The left over sauce is wonderful on poached eggs in place of hollandaise sauce. It's my husband's favorite chicken recipe.

Fantastic! I omitted the chiles and mushrooms and used paprika instead of chili powder since I didn't have any on hand. Baked for exactly 40 minutes after pounding chicken and it turned out moist and delicious. I served it with Cauliflower rice (minced cauliflower with butter garlic and parmesan) and roasted tomatoes with mozzarella and olive oil since I'm on a low carb diet. Yummy and so easy!

I made this for my husband and it literally brought tears to his eyes it tasted so good. I pounded the chicken flat and cut the breasts in half (they're so big these days!) and served it over wild rice. Easy and outstanding flavor! I think the next time I make it I will use chicken thighs since they are less expensive and the end result will be a little more moist.

It's like a chicken enchilada without the tortilla! My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I especially like it because the ingredients are simple and it's easy to make. We add a little hot sauce to the sauce to give it a little more of a kick.

This was nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad either hence the 3-star rating. I sauteed an onion in a little oil then added my green chiles. I then melted the cream cheese in the same pan and added the remainder of the ingredients omitting the mushrooms. I love them but somehow they didn't seem like they belonged in this dish. I did use a combo of 2% milk and regular half and half since it's what I had on hand. I seasoned the chicken breasts to taste and then poured the warm sauce over them. I covered with foil and only baked for 20 minutes since my chicken was the thin-sliced variety. With the warm sauce already poured over the chicken I didn't want to risk overcooking either. I mixed some white rice into the sauce after the chicken was done and also served a zucchini/squash/onion/tomato stir-fry on the side. Good for busy weeknights and husband really liked but not something I'll remember enough to repeat.

This was a very good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but to make it a lighter option I followed another reviewer and used light cream cheese shredded cheese and skim milk. I also used a full can of enchilada sauce (medium) and it had just the right amount of spice. I served over rice and left overs over pasta and it was good both ways.

This was really good. I love spicy stuff and this was just right. I don't like mushrooms or green chiles so instead I added a can of hot rotel. I thought the rotel made this dish. Everything else I kept the same. Will be making this again for sure. Plan to make rice with it next time.

This turned out really good! however I forgot the cream cheese and just used the half and half but it still tasted very good. I'm thinking of actually using the sauce as a dip for a party we have coming up and this time I might remember the cream cheese and it would probably make it more of a "dip" like consistency!

I am giving this recipe four stars because (1.) it only required a small number of ingredients & they are ones that I usually have on hand (2.) it was very easy to assemble and (3.) the sauce turned out excellent. However I think the next time I make this I will roll the chicken pieces in some taco-seasoning (or some other seasonings) as it needed something. I like the idea of a previous reviewer who used shredded chicken and served it over pasta. That is a grand idea...!

I just tried out this recipe and my family loved it. We like it saucier so I had added more enchilada sauce than what the recipe called for I also garnished it with chopped green onions and some diced jalapeños as we love our dishes spicy. I also prepared a side of Spanish rice. It was very good together..

This was delicious and easy. It was awesome as leftovers (5 star) and pretty good the first time around. (4-4 1/2) I did end up cooking it a little longer since I wasn't sure if 40 was enough. (Thick breasts) The chicken was very very tender. Thank you.

Really liked this recipe!! I only added a little of the chili powder because I didn t want the sauce too spicy. Just enough for me. Husband loved it as well. I added mushrooms on his chicken and then poured the sauce on top. I also added some shredded Monterey jack cheese the last 15 minutes of cooking. I served it over rice with some of the sauce poured over it. This is defiantly become a usual at my house. Leftovers tasted great!

It was delicious! Even my 17-month old that eats nothing had a few bites and didn't spit it out. My husband hates cream cheese so I didn't tell him it was in here and I don't think he even noticed. I did add a little extra enchilada sauce (green) and about 3 TB of salsa so the sauce was a bit runny. Next time I will try red sauce. I saved the extra sauce for pasta tomorrow.

My whole family enjoys this dish including my 11 & 12 y.o nephew & neice. Tender tasty and moist! An excellent dish served over brown rice. The last time I made it I used med/hot green enchilada sauce and added 1 TBLSP Chopped Jalepenos. That spiced it up a little but I might add even more jalepenos next time.

Scaled back chicken by 2/3rds (only two of us) but cut other ingredients by 1/3rd effectively doubling the sauce. Used red enchilada sauce and a whole 8-oz. package of fresh sliced mushrooms. Super! The only "change" I may make is to try using green enchilada sauce. This is a keeper.

It was good. Just not as good as the ingredients seem like they should be.

Satisfied the whole family! I modified for the picky eaters in our house by omitting the mushrooms. And since I only had 5 breasts on hand and a very hungry crew I decided to serve this over rice. This also helped modify some of the richness of the dish. I cut the breasts into bite sized pieces and increased some of the moisture quantities. I used a full block of cream cheese a little more cheddar cream and enchilada sauce (I used green) to provide more sauce for the rice. I garnished each plate with some sliced avocado. Delish! Next time I will use a larger can of green chiles to match the increased sauce amount.

I think this recipe has potential but my husband did not like it at all. I think that the cream cheese needs to be lightly melted over the stove top being being added to the rest of the ingredients because it was too chunky even after I let it sit out for two hours to soften. I'm eating the leftovers tonight with tortialla chips. I think it's a good base but might be better with bite size pieces of chicken wrapped up in tortillas. Also needs more of a kick. Will try some salsa with it tonight.
