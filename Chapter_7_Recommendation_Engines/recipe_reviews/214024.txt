Awesome dish!!!!  This is an A plus & easy no fail recipe that I have been making for many years.  It goes perfectly with ham & is my son's #1 request for family get-togethers no matter the occasion or menu.  It can be make the day before (unbaked).  I now use Panko crumbs on top for a real crunch & cut way down on the sugar to about 1/2 cup.  Also, Splenda works well.  Try it!!

VERY GOOD!  Was the hit of a recent family gathering.  I will say that it is pretty sweet so you could cut back on the sugar if you wanted.  The butter and cracking topping was very buttery so you could probably do the same with the butter.

As a born and bred Southerner I've enjoyed this authentic dish at every gathering of southerners I've ever attended from the time I was a very small child. Some variations I've seen included 1 cup of sweetened coconut, a can of drained Mandarin orange slices, chopped pecans, a small jar of maraschino cherries drained and cut in half, and a half bag of mini marshmallows. I've seen it served at everything from Sunday family dinners to dinner on the grounds at churches to family reunions to funerals and weddings to neighborhood potlucks and it is ALWAYS one of the first dishes to disappear. That many Southerners just can't be wrong. You should try this. This base recipe is the same at every occasion ENJOY!

This was perfect! Yum-a-licious! I cut the sugar to 3/4 c. and will probably cut it back to 1/2 c. next time. I will also cut the butter and see where I land with it. There was so much, it pooled in the dish.

This is a very tasty side dish.  My husband actually liked it.  I only had one problem, the cheese wouldn't melt even after I heated it up the next day.  I followed the receipe exactly except for cutting it in half and using less sugar.  Other pineapple casserole I have had, the cheese looked melted.  What did I do wrong?

Yummy..! A big hit for an Easter side dish. My father Loved it soo much. Love that it was not too sweet. My only question is what do you do with the 1/4 cup of reserved juice?  I added a bit to the dish, then the rest to the topping. Didn't think using it or not significant.

Holy nommers! Per suggestions, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used 1 stick of butter instead of a full cup and this was amazing. I also ran into issues with the cheese not melting. I may try grating my own cheese next time or using smaller shreds.

The first time I made this dish in May to bring to our camping group potluck, it was the biggest hit.  Everyone loved it!  I have been bringing it to almost every get together this summer with rave reviews.  It is very easy to make.  I did use more Ritz crackers for the topping, that was the only change I made.  Thanks for such a great recipe, it is an attention getter!

Holy moly, this is delicious!  Took it as a side dish to a big family BBQ and it was loved by all.  Don't even try and add up the calories, you might be frightened, but as an every once in awhile treat it is to die for!

I made this casserole yesterday.  I used two cans of crushed pineapple and it was not dry like when you make it using the chucks.  I also used shredded cheese and my cheese melted.  I cooked the casserole for about fifteen minutes then added the cracker crumbs and cooked it another twenty minutes.  It came out very moist and with just enough juice that it was not dry.  Try making it this way and I think you will like it better.  I did not cut back on any ingredients.

I've used this recipe for nearly every holiday over the past 30 years and it's always by popular demand.  Today is June 29 and I just put this dish in the oven; no holiday but just because, which seems perfectly reasonable to me when you want to see the smile on DH's face because it's his favorite "dessert"!

Delicious recipe whether used as a side dish or as a dessert.  I do cut back on the amount of sugar.  Also, I like the cheese to be melted into the casserole so I make sure to buy finely shredded cheddar.

It was delicious, however, I didn't have Ritz crackers or anything like it so I substituted about 1 1/2 cups of oats with only 5 tablespoons of butter. I enjoyed it and I think I will make it for family functions. It is super easy and quick. I agree with others, maybe cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup. It didn't seem to be too sugary to me, but maybe it was the oats or maybe I'm just a sweet eater. Anyway, it was so good!!

I made this recipe for a potluck luncheon and it was delicious.  I did alter some of the quantities of the ingrdeients.  I used 1/2 Cup of Splenda instead of sugar and reduced the butter to 1/2Cup.  I also lengthened the baking time to 40 minutes.  I will definitely make it again.

Our family was not too impressed with this dish - it was OK, but nothing special.   I did follow other reviewers' suggestion of cutting sugar and butter in 1/2 - I'm glad I did.  The problems I had:  1.  the cheese didn't melt.  I used full-fat cheese and shredded it extremely finely.   2.  the cracker topping didn't really crisp up the way I thought it should (maybe it needed a bit more butter?).   Note:  I did double the recipe (maybe that contributed to my problem) and baked it for nearly an hour.  There are other side dishes that I will explore rather than make this again.

Took a chance on making this as a side for our Turkey and Ham 
 Easter dinner and WOW!!  I am definitely not from the South, but can understand how this becomes a favorite side dish for holiday meals.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  As per the other reviews, I cut the sugar to a half cup and the butter to a half cup as well.  I used the pre-shredded sharp cheese and would shred my own next time as it does not melt as good a finer shredded one would.  If you have never tried this dish, I highly recommend you do!  Everyone will thank you for it!

This will be my third Easter making this casserole.  It is  delicious and reminds my husband of his southern roots (his aunt makes a similar dish)  Thanks for sharing! I will continue making it and hope it is one of the recipes my kids will have fond memories of. Hopefully someday they will want to make it for their own children

well for some reason the 30 min cook time left a burnt flavor to the dish ... half the family hated the cheddar and the only person to eat the leftovers was my dad but mostly because he was raised to not throw food away. I am going to try this again with some major changes, cooking at a lower temp, changing the cheese, change the topping as crackers disappeared with the pineapple covering the flavor. Also as I try not to used canned foods, I used 2 whole pineapples. One I blended using its liquid for the recipe, the other i chopped for chunks and the oz equaled that called for the recipe.

this is definitely delicious and hard to stay away from.  the buttery ritz cracker topping just makes it.  I read the reviews prior to making it and noted the comments on the sweetness.  I do agree that it is very sweet and could easily be adjusted to one's level of sweet.  I think I would opt for a half cup next time, as I made this to go with my Easter ham. I think half a cup would be plenty for the whole sweet/savory idea as a side dish.  I used just half a cup of butter and it was plenty!  I think a cup would have made it swim.  also added a bit of the pineapple juice to the butter/ritz cracker.  definitely a keeper recipe especially with ham.  thanks for sharing.

This casserole dish is much better than others I've tried. I don't like juice in the crackers. So yummy.

I tried this instead of sweet potatoes with our Thanksgiving bourbon coated chicken.  It was a great blend of sweet and savory and I really liked the difference in texture because of the chucks and crushed pineapple
