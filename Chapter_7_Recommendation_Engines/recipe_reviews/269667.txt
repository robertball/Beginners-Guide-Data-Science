I loved the softness of the chicken. It really does fall off the bone, but I wish it had a stronger flavor. I would double or triple the adobo seasoning on my next time. I did use the Traci's Adobo Seasoning from allrecipes.com. I did cook it for the 2 1/2 hours and followed it exactly except marinating 8 hours.
