No dutch oven, just a plain ol' cast iron skillet. I made one small change. I don't normally keep parsley on hand (and I forgot to pick it up this week during the grocery shopping) so instead of parsley, I added two teaspoons of homemade italian seasoning. This ragu was cake, seriously 20 minutes it took me to make this, not counting the simmering. The end result was fantastic. My husband and kids INHALED this dish--there was NO leftovers. I'll make this again.

5 stars for being easy, simple, and good! This will be my go-to if we just want to use italian sausages instead of my usual sausage/beef mixture.

I used 3 1/2 cups of tomato sauce like the recipe calls for and then decided to watch the video to make sure that I was doing it right, and the video says to use store bought marinara? You should change the ingredients on this recipe so it won't confuse anymore people!

FANTASTIC! Made the sauce as written and would not change a thing. The flavor that comes out of this after cooking so long is wonderful and sooo flavorful! I used cellantani (sp?) pasta instead of penne b/c that's what I had on hand. This is definitely a new pasta favorite~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious.  Did not change the recipe at all.  My dinner guest ate himself into a carb-induced coma.  So simple - will be making this again.

This was amazing! My only complaint was not having some nice crusty bread to go with it, but that's my own fault!

My changes were to use a red wine (found one meant to go with pasta and meat) and using almost 3/4 of a cup. To balance that out, I added just a tiny bit extra of heavy cream. But the wine made the sausage so rich and delicious!

So I come home from work one night and my husband says he has dinner taken care of. The house smells amazing, but yet I was still a little worried because the husband is not a make dinner from scratch sort of guy. I was glad he found this recipe. It was the first of many we've made from Chef John. In fact we've made it so many times I don't even have to look at the recipe anymore. I've made it with wine and also with chicken stock and a little cider vinegar and we like it both ways.

The only thing I changed was using 16 oz of pasta instead of 14oz. This has become one of my family and I favorite dishes.

I didnot have fresh parsley. I subed 2tsp. of dried Italian seasoning for the parsley because that is what I had. This recipe is fantastic. Make it, you won't be sorry.

We absolutely love this recipe.  It's on our regular rotation. Great as is, but to make it a little healthier I use ground turkey and add Penzey's Italian Sausage Seasoning while using Tinkyada pasta which is made from brown rice.  Delicious!

I just made this tonight. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used regular ground beef instead of sausage and served it over spaghetti. I only did this because I am desperately trying to find foods that my very picky 3-year old will eat and I didn’t want it to be too flavourful as she tends to like milder foods. My daughter, hubby and myself loved this. I used Newman’s Marinara Sauce for the tomato sauce. I highly recommend this recipe. This is definitely the sauce recipe I am going to use from now on for spaghetti, lasagna, etc. And I have tried ALOT!

6.17.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222001/spicy-sausage-ragu/ ... Good, but not special.  E, 22, thought it was too tomatoey, liked all, but this one was last place of the three I tried; this, Christine L's  Amatriciana & Ellen's Arrabbiata Sauce.

This was just full of awesomeness.  Very hearty, easy, and delicious.  I slow simmered for about 1 1/2 hours but I think it could go longer and just keep getting better.

Tomato sauce is not interchangeable with jar pasta sauce. The recipe should not say tomato sauce.

I love this recipe. I made my own marinara sauce by simmering tomatoes and garlic (with a pinch of sugar) for about 30 minutes then added to the sausage. Everyone loved it and licked the bowls clean. You will not regret. :-)

just tried this for the first time. I did make a few additions though, along with the sausage I added some pepperoni and prosciutto and used a spicy marinara sauce. I also used 1 of the home made pasta recipe from this site. it was absolutely DELICIOUS. I would highly recommend it.

I used a skillet to cook everything, not a dutch oven.  I used dried italian spice mix instead of parsley, and doubled the recipe as I'm feeding 5 hungry people.  It was fantastic, and everyone loved it!

Very delicious but watch the salt in this one. I used chicken and turkey sausage to make it a bit healthier. I used rigatoni and I think it's a better option than penne pasta because it fit with the sausage.

Great!  I used a whole cup of heavy cream instead of the 1/4 for creaminess, and I must say that this recipe beats any store-bought I've ever tried.  Quick, easy, inexpensive, and delicious!

Amazing and simple recipe.  I added some garlic and mushrooms but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.  Served mine over gnocchi.  It was perfect.  Thanks, I'll definitely make this again!

Phenomenal!!  I made this with Chef John's recipe for tomato sauce and it just could not have been better.  I did not have spicy sausage so I added some red pepper flakes and also some cayenne for good measure.  Served with rigatoni.  We loved it.  I think that 1/4 cup of cream takes it over the top.

DELICIOUS!!  and soooooo easy, I used light cream & dried parsley (because it's all I had) - otherwise as written and it was excellent.  I've been looking for a good sauce recipe forever, and haven't found one that I liked…….This is my new standard sauce recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

My hunny had thirds. He said this was one of the best things I ever made for him. I did double the cream, not a taste thing more I just didn't want it to go bad. Also the sauce I used was leftover from a sausage, peppers, and onion meal I had left. IT was amazing.

This has become my new favorite easy pasta dish.  My two young daughters and my husband loved it.  I used Barilla Marinara sauce for the tomato sauce.  That combined with the white wine and heavy cream made for a delicious, but not too heavy cream sauce.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 1 tablespoon of dried parsley.  I will be making this again, ....very soon.  Thanks Chef John for another fantastic dish!
