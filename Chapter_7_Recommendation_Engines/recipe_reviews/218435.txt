Oh yum! I don't have an ice cream maker so I improvised. I whirred all the ingredients in my blender (with about a tablespoon of grenadine), leaving out the cherries. I covered it and stuck it in the freezer and let it get really cold and ALMOST frozen before I ran it through the blender again, after which I folded in the cherries. I made little frozen treat pops out of this recipe with dixie cups and popsicle sticks. I was able to get 14 little cups full. I just lined them up on a flat serving tray and stuck them in the freezer until they were just about solid, then stuck the popsicle sticks in them. These are SO good! SO good. We're really loving these little gems. I think this might be our new summer treat--thanks for sharing.

Use non-fat Greek yogurt and non-fat cream cheese to lower the calories/serving to 130!  Still tastes delicious and freezes well.  The Greek Yogurt overpowers the cream cheese so it doesn't taste very much like cheesecake but ease of prep and taste make it a recipe worth making again.

Great frozen yogurt recipe, and it was still rich and creamy with low fat cream cheese and low fat yogurt. I used frozen strawberries instead of cherries and chopped them in the food processor.

Yummy! It is a lot of work to get 2 cups of chopped cherries, but it is worth it!

I used non fat greek yogurt and non fat cream  cheese and it came out great.

I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it is too sweet... I will use 1/2 or 1/3 cup of sugar next time and add a bit of dark chocolate chips next time.

I made this with homemade non-fat yogurt (thick, but not Greek) lowfat cream cheese and fresh picked cherries. It was a little heavy on the fruit for my tastes, but otherwise very tasty and creamy. I will definitely try this again with other fruits and probably less sugar

Made this tangy frozen yogurt on the 4th of July weekend. It was luscious and had lots of eye appeal. Will definitely make this again. Thank you.

Very yummy & such an easy recipe! I used regular vanilla yogurt since that's all I had. I don't own an ice cream maker, so I made popsicles. I just put all the ingredients except for the cherries in the blender, then stuck it in the freezer until almost frozen. Then took it out, blended it up again, then added the cherries & blended real quick once more. Poured it in my little popsicle containers & froze overnight. 
I halved the recipe to make 6 popsicles & I had a lot extra, which I just poured in a freezer safe bowl. I don't think you actually even need an ice cream maker if you have a blender. My husband LOVED this recipe & usually doesn't even like cheesecake, but he loves cherries. I personally don't like cherries, but I really like this if I just eat around the cherries. :)

This tastes soooooo goood!!!! I personally am doing HCG and modified this recipe to be Phase 3 compliant by using 2/3 cup Madhava's Vanilla agave nectar in place of the white sugar. Instead of using cherries I pureed some defrosted frozen peaches and added the mix to the yogurt. Honestly, the flavors were so good it was not even needed. I also added a cap full of vanilla extract for good measure. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you so much to the original poster!

Amazing! I used light cream cheese and it turned out fine. I did use full fat greek yogurt and would not reccomend otherwise, but one could lighten it up by adding extra berries. Rich and delicious!

Excellent recipe! I used light cream cheese, Dannon Light N Fit vanilla yogurt, and cherries that I had in the freezer. (I actually had only about 1-1/2 cup cherries, but it was plenty.) I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup, and it was sweet enough. I mixed everything, except the cherries, in a blender for about 30 seconds, then I added the partially-thawed cherries and blended for just a few seconds more so that the cherries were slightly chopped. I poured the mixture directly into my ice cream maker without chilling it first, and it was done in 20-25 minutes. My family loved it!

Tasted good but even though I mixed it continually while freezing, it ended-up being almost like 1 big ice cube. Would make great popcicles though.

Loved this!  Just like some of the other reviews, I used Low fat Cream Cheese and 0% Plain Greek Yogurt. I reduced the sugar to half a cup.  We thought it was plenty sweet.  My husband who hates it when I sub anything for Greek Yogurt really enjoyed this one!  We used frozen blueberries because that was what I had in the freezer at the time and it was aaaamazing.

FANTASTIC! This frozen yogurt will definitely be one that I will make again and again. I used a large jar of maraschino cherries and a little bit of the juice for extra color and cherry flavor. The use of cream cheese really enhances the creamy the creamy texture. I had a hard time putting the spoon down.

Even better when frozen for a day. I will definitely try tweaking this next time to make it taste more like a new york style cheesecake but it does taste really great.

This is delicious! I made a couple changes.  I used regular yogurt because I didn't have Greek.  Also, I didn't use the sugar, I used a bit more than 1/3 c Stevia natural sweetener.  and maybe a few more cherries than in the recipe.  I do not have an ice cream maker, so I put it in a large covered bowl in the freezer.  Not solid but edibly frozen after 6 hours in there.  Very very tasty and very very easy.  Next I will try with Greek yogurt and blueberries.

You will want to use full fat yogurt and cream cheese the first time around! It makes this so rich and creamy that you won't need to eat a lot. This is like velvet in your mouth with bursts of cherry sinfulness. So good you might not even regret it later.

I was looking to use up the last of my Fage 0% Fat Greek Yogurt.  Had 3/4 cup which adjusted to 3 servings on the recipe.  I had the "whipped" cream cheese handy.  I used baking Stevia, so measured half the sugar amount.  Followed the blender idea using my Ninja single serve cup for all ingredients ex. cherries.  Froze about hour & a half, then reblended again a bit.  Scraped into a bowl then folded in cherries.  Covered and froze for about another 5 hours.  I don't know if it was the whipped cream cheese sub, or its this good regardless.  But this was a sinfully yummy & creamy ice cream substitute.

I prefer ice cream over frozen yogurt but the market had some beautiful cherries and I like Greek yogurt so I thought I’d give it a try.  This was yummy.  I have a smaller ice cream maker so I adjusted the serving size to 8 which fit perfectly in my ice cream maker.

Yum. I used what I had in my kitchen. Low-fat plain Greek yogurt, cream cheese, maraschino cherries, brown sugar and almond extract. It turned out great. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this using Greek yogurt and fresh pitted cherries as the recipe called for. Many of the reviews recommended cutting back on the sugar so I put only 1/2 cup sugar. I found the finished project not sweet enough with a grainy texture and it turn into a huge ice block. If I were to make this recipe again I would probably use a dryer fruit and make it into popsicles as some other reviews suggest.

Love this. I pulse it in my blender a few times while it is freezing, I love what that does to the texture! Also, instead of cherries I have used sour cherry concentrate. You get awesome cherry flavor but without frozen chunks of fruit. Want to try pineapple next!

I subbed Stevia baking blend for sugar because my husband is diabetic.  After I pitted the cherries, I threw all the ingredients in a food processor and let it go. It was wonderful!!!

This was amazing. I used low fat cream cheese, fat free greek yogurt and 1/2 cup Domino sugar/stevia blend. I didn't chill it, just put it in my small ice cream maker and it was done in no time.

Made as written. We loved the cream cheese addition and will probably use that in other frozen yogurt recipes. I was actually not a fan of the cherries, but I might have made the chunks too big. I cut the cherries into 8ths; if doing again I'd probably purée the cherries. Otherwise pretty good!

I made this for a family dinner night (6 people)It was not a hit. The only who enjoyed it was me(the cook). I will not make it again.
