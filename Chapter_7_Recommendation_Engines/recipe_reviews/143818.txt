This was really good. I made it to go on some tenderloin steaks and everyone absolutely loved the sauce. I used the left over to jerry rig up some Eggs Benedict the next morning and really enjoyed it again.

I love it this way. A long time ago, I put a version like this into my super blender, it heats as you go...delicious. I love your way too. Good stuff.

Wow! So good and I don't have to use my blender. Had to use onion - no shallot - but all else the same. Love it!

It was very tasty, but seems like all egg yolk-based sauces, requires strict attention to the heating point of the yolk and whisking to avoid the separating.  Even with, the separation is difficult to avoid.  I wonder if adding the vinegar reduction after whisking the egg yolk and butter together, rather than before, would help prevent separation.  It works better that way with my hollandaise sauce.

Really good with an entrecot steak. I didnt have fresh tarragon but I added it dry. I donÂ´t usually rate but this recipe deserves it.

Make sure you don't reheat the sauce once you make it. It's okay to make it early and just serve at room temperature. Really delicious but with I wouldn't have tried to reheat it as it broke down...
Also, the recipe says to drain the tarragon and shallots and from the sauce pan, however, once you do this you want to reincorporate some back into the sauce to give it more texture and flavor.

I didn't think I'd like this recipe and cooking method, but the results are outstanding.  I agree, fresh tarragon is the key to a great sauce, but good vinegar is also very important.  The other herbs are good for background notes, but I've made this without chervil because I didn't have any, and I didn't really miss it.  Thank you for posting!

This is my first rating, and I must say I've made quite a few of the recipes without taking the time to rate.  This recipe deserves it!  I made filet mignon oscar style.  The sauce was the perfect companion for the combination of lump crab and asparagus with filet.  Creamy and flavorful without over-powering the rest of the ingredients. Loved it!
