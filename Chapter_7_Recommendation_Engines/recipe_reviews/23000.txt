An easy, if not awe inspiring spaghetti sauce recipe.  My mother makes a similar dish she calls tomato gravy.  My husband didn't care for the stew meat and stated he prefers hamburger or sausage.  

I added a green pepper and half a red pepper to the sauce with the onions.  I also added fresh basil, oregano, thyme and parsley the last few minutes before serving.

This is really good. It's a common way to make rag√π in Southern Italy. I added some peas and used it in some arancini as well as on pasta. Thank you for the recipe.
