This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I made it once with raspberry jam in the middle, and once with strawberry jam... sooooo good, they were gone in less than an hour.. and my husband is generally not a cookie person.  Yum!

These are okay. Definitely way too long for cooking - I had to do it for 10 minutes only. The cookies are crunchy.

I like the brown sugar version of this cookie.  Like my mother always did, I roll mine in coconut before baking.  Also, a candied cherry is nicer than a maraschino cherry.  I find the maraschino cherry tends to bleed and makes the centre of the cookie soft.

This recipe is great.  It is so easy and fast to make. I made it using cherries in the middle, jam in the middle and chopped pecans in the middle.  The cookies disappear quickly.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use granulated instead of brown sugar and to increase the vanilla to 1 teaspoonful.  It also helps if the butter is at room temperature and very soft.  Another thing I did with this recipe was to save the egg white and use it as an adhesive for the nuts I used in the centers of the cookies.  I whisked the egg white, made an indentation in the center of each cookie using the handle of a wooden spoon and then brushed the egg white in the center and added the chopped pecans.  The first time I used nuts in the centers, I didn't use the egg white and the nuts didn't stick nearly as well.  The possibilities are many with this yummy cookie recipe.

These were great!  I made them with strawberry jam in the center for a Christmas party and everyone loved them.  I'd say that other reviewer either flubbed an ingredient or needs to check his/her oven calibration.
