This one is a 3-4 star dish in reality.  As other reviewers noted it is rather bland, relying on the granny smith and blue cheese for flavor.  The granny smith is critical for that strong, tart contrasting flavor.  The subtle celery flavor was a nice texture addition.  I followed the recipe only adding some broth to the celery/apple/shallot saute to keep the pan scrapings incorporated (used a cast iron skillet).  It was a nice flavor all in all and plated beautifully (mine would have plated much nicer had I used a non stick skillet).  I think next time seasoning the chicken a little more with perhaps some onion powder? and using the red onion option (vs. the shallots) for some color would be a nice change.

The taste was just outstanding! I didn't want the blue cheese sauce to go to waste so I served it over some bowtie pasta. This is restaurant quality and ridiculously easy. I thought this had plenty of flavor but then again I was liberal with the salt and plenty of fresh cracked pepper.

If you use hot Hungarian papricka instead of sweet papricka, the recipe produces a marvelous dish.

Very good. I added blue cheese crumbles on top.  Next time I will not saute the apples.  I think raw will give them more tart and crunch.  This is more like a salad.

Fantastic!  My finace hates blue cheese and spinach, but he cleaned his plate and ate the leftovers!  I would like more apple in mine.  I think next time I make it, I will cook 2 apples instead of one.

Yummy flavor fest.  I cut the chicken in smaller pieces and will not sautee the apples next time.  My husband wasn't fond of the pine nuts.  The warmed dressing was a great touch!

I made this for my guests because this looks so pretty.  I agree with another review about using Granny Smith apples and not cooking the apples.  Everyone really liked it.  I think I'll save the leftover chicken and dressing and make a pasta salad tomorrow with it.

Nothing outstanding.  It needs some kind of kick.  Maybe adding a little of cayenne would help.

This dish was ok. I don't think it's 4.5 star worthy though.

omitted the apples due to husband's aversion to fruit in dinner, but added cayenne, just a touch, to the chicken, VERY yummy. add as much blue cheese dressing as you like. I heated up in the microwave on low setting so it didn't separate.

My husband and I thought this was fabulous.  I didn't use the tablespoon of oil to saute the veggies, I just added a small amount of chicken broth along with additional salt, pepper and paprika.  I chose the red onions over the shallots.  This recipe looks amazing and tastes amazing.  I will definitely be making this again.
