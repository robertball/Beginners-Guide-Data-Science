The flavor was great.  For me, the heat was just right.  For my girlfriend, it was rather spicy... but she loved 'em and couldn't stop herself from eating them.

I made this tonight for supper with some "boneless" wings.   This came out super!   Tastes as good or better than the big chain wing restaurant  we occasionally visit when I'm feeling rich.    I generally get six spicy garlic and six Blazing.  Now I have it covered!!!

Very good wing sauce I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder

I've made several wing recipes from this site over the past week and this one was the best. I scaled the recipe down due to the amount of wings I had but other than that  I made as written. The added garlic gives these a nice touch.  You can't go wrong with this one!

Was not like I thought it was going to be. No Garlic taste at all. VERY hot, and I used slightly less hot then called for.

Awesome sauce. The Franks and vinegar makes the perfect combination of spicy and tangy.
