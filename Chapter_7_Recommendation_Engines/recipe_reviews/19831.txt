Allrecipes never lets me down! I was looking through the barbeque sauce recipes, hopefully looking for some ideas to doctor up (believe it or not) a couple of bottles of plain old Kraft Honey Barbeque sauce that I had! Better yet I had all the ingredients for this recipe and it got good reviews. Thanks Sue, for my “Real Recipes from Real People” cosmic connection for the day. Just what the doctor ordered for my pulled pork. Didn’t change a thing, 5 stars, tangy and yummy. Exactly the flavor I was wanting. Seems like a lot of brown sugar but the lemon juice keeps it from being too sweet. The whole can of cola seems like it will be too thin and watery. But stir it up really well and it’s thicker than you think. I simmered mine a few minutes to soften the dried onions.This makes a lot. Next time I might scale the recipe in half.

I halved this recipe. I used a hickory smoke barbeque sauce (Kraft) and I added an additional half teaspoon of Liquid Smoke and a good shake of Frank's hot sauce for a little kick. This was nice to stretch the barbeque I had a little farther and make it taste less........processed.

This sauce is really great!  Here in the south we are serious about our barbecue!  It's really quick and easy and it tastes like you spent all day on it.  Great on anything you can throw on a grill.  Really good on Bubba Burgers.  Can't get any easier than that!

Perfect, Perfect! I used this wonderful BBQ sauce on another recipe from this site...Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork BBQ....the combination makes a true winner, the best pulled pork sandwich we've ever had. The house still smells sooo good!

Excellent recipe! I used this recipe the first time about a month ago on some pork ribs and was really impressed.  Friday morning prior to Labor Day this year, I did my usual dry rub on an 8 lb pork shoulder;  Sunday night before Labor Day, the shoulder when on the grill at 215 degrees for a very relaxing 13 hours.  Ten minutes of rest after coming off the grill, then the pulling began -- with intermittent doses of sauce.  The pork & sauce got rave reviews at our neighborhood cookout, and now my son is anxious to introduce the sauce & pulled pork to Texas !

This is a WONDERFUL barbeque sauce.  I used a spicy honey bottled sauce to give it a bit of kick.  Served this with pulled pork for a world series party---everybody raved!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good sauce- it's a staple in my fridge.  I would also use a 1/2 can of cola instead of a whole can to make it thicker.  I used it on BBQ burgers and everyone swore they were the best burgers ever!  It also keeps very well for a long time

A great way to use up those less pricey bottles of BBQ sauce purchased when the store has a BOGO sale.  The finished sauce is a bit sweeter than I would have liked, so I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes for counterbalance.  Family concurred it was quite good on grilled pork chops.  Thanks!

Very excellent BBQ sauce. I put the sauce on my Chicken on the charcoal grill and everyone just loved it. I would suggest reducing the 1 can of cola to 1/2 a can. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!! Do yourself a favor, season some chicken breasts with garlic salt and cayenne pepper, then make a little extra sauce and use it as a marinade. Reserve some sauce and baste the chicken as you grill it, its amazing! I made it for a party and people liked it so much I ran out of chicken!!!

I may have to try this one out. I've been using steak sauce and other ingredients for years in my bbq sauce since my grandfather showed me when I was a little boy. I would've never thought to put cola in it. Always used brown sugar or splash of orange juice to give it a sweet/ tangy tastse. I'll give it 5 stars. Just for the steak sauce. Every year I get mad props on my sauce. But this may take them over the edge. I'll let you know how it is for my next cookout in may or the 4th of july.

Everyone loved my ribs with this sauce!  Marinated overnight with a rub and cooked on low for a couple hours then slathered on the sauce once they hit the grill.  I only had the teriyaki A-1 sauce on hand but it turned out fantastic!

It was a little too sweet and plain to me, so it only gets 3 stars.  After spicing it up with some tobasco and garlic powder, it was great!

I made this recipe yesterday to pour over shredded chicken. I chopped one large onion and sauteed til clear instead of using onion flakes. I also decreased the cola to about a 1/2 can. Then, I simmered it til the sugar was disolved. It is absolutely delicious....very different from other sauces. My family loved it and so did I. A definite keeper.

Don't add the brown sugar and you have Memphis Style Bar-B-Q sauce. I used onion powder instead of flakes with a heavy splash of garlic powder. Kick it up with a touch of hot sauce. So Yummie.

My family LOVED this sauce on kielbasa! It was cut up and marinated in it for about 90 minutes and then cooked in the oven.  We cannot wait to try this on chicken.
