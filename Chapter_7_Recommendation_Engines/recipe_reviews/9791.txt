Great cookie! A perfect combination of buttery,crispy and chewy. I used all light brown sugar as I don't keep dark in my pantry, no problem.

I'm just making these! The dough is delicious! I did add more flour... it didn't seem quite thick enough... up to 2/3 cup more ( didn't measure!) Also... add Caramel Bits! YUM! I also added a little Almond and Coconut extracts... about 1/8 tsp of each along with vanilla. Enjoy!

These were pretty good. Seemed to have a more cake like texture rather than a cookie texture but that's ok. They weren't as sweet as I like my chocolate chip cookies but they will go great with hot cocoa!

The batter is delicious, but the minute I put them in the oven they spread into a thin sheet. I even tried adding more baking soda, but it did not help. Instead of cookies, I got thin, crispy mush.

Good cookie.  The cookies edges didn't set up like a good looking cookie, but spread out a little.  Maybe my fault, but they tasted good.

They were a bit flat, didn't look any different than a regular chocolate chip cookie and were very spongy.  They would have been decent if you wanted a cake cookie.

These were great. I think they would be good without the chocolate chips as well.

I saw the reviews that they were "cakey," and didn't figure that sounded too bad, but they were very bland. And the cakey cookies made me decide I really do like a cookie to be chewy.

while the cookie had okay flavor, this recipe is misleading. When you think cookie: soft and chewy comes to mind. This cookie is not that cookie. I even tried doctoring it after I realized and had wasted a lot of time and money doubling this recipe ( and we all know that chocolate chips and especially nuts arent cheap). Unfortunately I ended up with a big bowl of dough wasted because this cookie recipe makes cakey cookies. These kind of cookies are fine if you like and or expecting that. I wish they would rename this cookie to describe what it is "the cakey chocolate chip and pecan cookie"
