FANTASTIC! I made this tonight for my girls for dinner, and they absolutely LOVED it! The chicken had wonderful flavor and was so moist and tender. I did use the optional white wine and seasoned panko crumbs...This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Overall the chicken was great.  Easy to make and tasty.  I served this for company with lasagne caprese, stuffed mushrooms, salad and garlic breadsticks - was delish!  Downgraded one star because the recipe just wasn't proportioned as stated.  Perhaps my breasts were larger than the author had, particularly after pounding out.  When you build the breading, use common sense - eyeball it.   I at least quadrupled the breading for 10 breasts and came out ok, but with the original calculations, it would never have had enough breading.  Kind of the same with the liquid dip.  Can't remember if I doubled or tripled, but I ended up brushing the breasts rather than dipping them.  I made it again the next day with sufficient dip and they were very flavorful.  Will make again!

Pretty darn good! I used chicken tenders, so the cook-time was even shorter, and everyone liked them! Definitely a do-again!

Only change is that I would pound the chicken first if it's a large breast, and also I would put the chicken on a rack in the baking pan and turn it over halfway through so the bottom gets crispy as well. Very tasty tho and I would definitely make it again!

It was amazing! I didn't use white wine but I found a Dijon mustard that already had white wine in it so that did the job well. I bought chicken "milanesa" which is the breast already thinned out. However, after cooking it I realized I still should have thinned it out more because I ended up cooking the chicken for about 30 minutes instead of 20.

This chicken was awesome. My chicken loving parents gave it an A+ and my beef loving husband gave it a B++. He says chicken isn't eligible for an A. I made the recipe as written and used a panko Parmesan mixture i had frozen from another Parmesan chicken recipe. It was delicious and very moist. I served it with garlic pasta. My family cleared their plates. Th poor dog didn't get any leftovers.

These were really good! My husband says you can't go wrong with a recipe that includes panko and parmesan cheese. I had to sub garlic powder for fresh so I added a little extra powder to the crumb mixture. Baked them on a rack so the bottoms didn't get soggy. Coating was crispy and flavorful and the chicken stayed moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish is so delicious and SO EASY!   I was having one of those days, feeling totally uninspired and over it and wondering how in the world to prepare the chicken breasts I had defrosted.  I came upon this recipe while glumly searching through the site and thought I’d try it since I had all of the ingredients on hand.  It was awesome!  Breasts were moist, breading was flavourful and light.  Served it with a baby spinach salad and mushroom rice.   It’s a repeater!

I made everything as written, no wine, and forgot the garlic.  The chicken still turned out perfect, my husband and I loved it.  I do agree with everyone else in regards to the butter mixture and panko mixture not being enough when you have decent sized breasts, I was lazy and refused to make more, but it still was tasty.

Watch this closely, the breading browns very quickly.  I liked the addition of the Dijon mustard.

Awesome recipe. I added an egg white to the butter/Dijon mix. The chicken breasts came out moist and tender. Also, the same recipe worked great with thick cut boneless pork chops.

Delicious! I used thighs instead of breasts (our personal preference), and added a little lemon pepper to the bread crumb mix.  Quick, easy and oh, so good. I'll be making this again,

Quick and delicious, whenever my nephew wants to know how a meal is prepared, I know it has great flavor. The chicken was very moist and tasty. I coated my chicken breast first, then added paprika to the bread crumb mix for those in the house who enjoy a bit of spice with there meal. Definitely, will make again

Great recipe! I've made many things but never chicken parm before. Family loved it and said to put it into the regular meal rotation. I served it over pasta and smothered it with cheese and marinara.

Didn’t have Dijon mustard, but it was still great. Local grocery store sells thin sliced chicken, so no need to pound them. Super easy, super yummy. Great weeknight dinner for our family.

This is one of my go to recipes for chicken breast.  The only difference when I make it is I use olive oil instead of butter.

It was quick, crispy and very tasty! I will make it again and even try the suggestions in other reviews of topping it with spaghetti sauce or slicing it and putting it in a salad. I had some leftover and used it in quesadillas!

It already has five stars so we know it’s good.  And it’s Versatile! I changed it at the last minute, though.  Had just put the mustard in the bowl and I suddenly decided that with Parmesan cheese I’m thinking Italian! I removed the mustard  and added Italian season .  Also substituted water for wine.  The cold chicken caused the butter to harden  so I think next time I will dip the chicken in buttermilk first instead of butter.  
Note to any novice cooks:  Critical to the success of this dish is flattening the chicken breasts —pounding and making thin,  particularly if you use the supermarket chicken breasts which are huge due to growth hormone.    I flattened my chicken breasts to  about half an inch and they were actually doubled in size; so you’ll need a large pan.

Just delicious,  I followed the recipe and it turned out terrific!  It was something that I might taste in a nice restaurant.  Very easy, unless you're in a hurry.  Its quick to bake,  but getting the chicken dipped and breaded took some time and patience.  The paprika took the place of black pepper and was hot enough for me. I will definitely put in my good recipe pile.

I made this for my husband as-is (without the white wine) and he loved it.  This was very easy to make, so it's good for a quick weeknight dish, too!  It would be very easy to dress this up for personal preferences, but it's fantastic as written.

Made as stated EXCEPT I doubled the butter mixture and breadcrumb mixture for 5 thin sliced chicken breasts and it was just enough. Family really enjoyed it.

This is the second time I made this so I should rate it. We love it, it's simple and made with ingredients I usually have on hand. I did lightly pound the breasts a bit for uniformity.

I like to find the best recipes so I'm only making the very best tasting food I can. When my husband told me this is the best chicken I've made for him in our years of marriage, I knew this very picky man was satisfied...as was my quest for the best Parmesan chicken. I followed the directions exactly, and paired it with mashed yellow potatoes, chicken gravy from reduced broth, and a nice, deep and mellow Chardonnay. We will be repeating this effort, and I will not bother to adjust the recipe in any way. Magnificent!

Did not have any Dijon Mustard so used  deli grain mustard.  
I cut the chicken breast in half  rather then pound as my hands are unable to that.  It was AWESOME and the whole family loved it.  Will make it again

Will definitely add this to the "quick and delicious weeknight  meal" -- hubby and I loved it.  Cooked it longer than recipe stated due to large chicken breasts, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Served w/ a pesto pasta side dish & steamed veggie.  Delicious!

Made this for the first time last night, and it'll be in our rotation. The only small change i made was using regular Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of panko, since that's what I had on hand. I did use a good quality parmigano-reggiano cheese which I do think makes a difference over the regular pre-shredded parmesan. 
I was able to prep everything while the oven preheated. Turned out to be a perfect busy weeknight recipe. The chicken didn't dry out at all like it sometimes does in the oven and was much more flavorful than expected.

Yum, yum, yummo.  I've tried many, MANY other recipes similar to this one from this site and this was by far the best "quick, crusty, parmy, chickeny" recipe I've found on this site.   Thanks for sharing!  Husband hates mustard so I left it out, and this was still so good.

This was delicious. The only changes I made were to decrease the butter to 2 tablespoon and increase the wine by 1 tablespoon because I'm watching my cholesterol. My bread crumbs were Italian seasoned as well. I used fresh shredded Parmesan too. It turned out great. I served it with bow pasta with marinara sauce.

We loved these.  Since I was feeding picky grandchildren I substituted Italian bread crumbs and left out the other seasons and wine.  They were still delicious.  Left-overs were good the next day also.

Quick Crispy Parmesan Chicken Haiku: "Super moist inside, loved it having the Dijon. Great as leftovers." To maximize crispiness, I put my chicken on a rack over a sheet so it would have heat circulating around all that Panko-Parmesan perfection. This chicken was so very close to perfection - really tasty served w/ a salad.

Absolutely wonderful! I will make this often. I didn't want to open a bottle of white wine to only use such a small amount, so I used Sake.    Other than that I made it exactly as written.

I loved it! It was so tasty and so easy to make! It didn’t take long, so it was perfect for a weekday evening meal. I found that my chicken was still a bit pink after 20 minutes, so I left it in for 5 more & it was perfect!

Love this juicy well seasoned chicken recipe. Hubby is a happy camper with a serving in front of him. Made enough to freeze for a lazy day quick meal.

My son and I love this recipe!  So moist and delicious! I don’t use the wine, and mustard on occasion, when I have it. It’s a great flavor with it, but with the garlic and seasoned bread crumbs, the flavor is there! 5 stars.

I really liked this, despite the fact that I forgot to add the garlic.  Fiance gave it 4 stars, saying too much Parmesan cheese flavor.  Perhaps if I didn't forget the garlic, it would have balanced it out better for him.  I will make it again.

very good, however for my taste will leave out the salt and increase the temp a bit to make a little crispier.

Made this exactly as directed with only 2 chicken breasts. Cut ingredients in half. Baked at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes. So tender and juicy! Delicious and very easy!

Moist and juices. The Dijon mustard added some zing to the recipe. Used chicken broth in place of the wine. Still delicious. Will be a go to meal for me!

This chicken has really good flavor! I used dry sherry since I had no wine open and olive oil instead of butter.  Next time I make this, I will marinade it in the wet ingredients and maybe make more of it for that purpose. I made more coating than the recipe called for because I had huge chicken breasts from the meat market.

My family loves this recipe! The only thing I do differently is instead of using butter I use olive oil. I made this one time with melted butter and it began to solidify on my cold chicken breasts. It still turns out yummy but so does the olive oil!

I made this exactly as the recipe. The only difference was that I cooked the chicken for @15min, then turned to crisp both sides. Turned the broiler on for a couple of min to re crisp the top. Delicious

I have made this several times now...I've added it to my regular rotation of favorite meals! It is so so good! Do not leave out the white wine. I usually double the recipe because I use Costco chicken breasts and they are pretty big. I slice the chicken in half to make it less thick, then I cut in half again so the pieces aren't huge. I bake on a rack so it's crispy on both sides. I pair with my creamy parmesan mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and my family goes nuts! This is an absolutely delicious recipe, thank you for sharing!

I did not flatten my chicken. But it had barely enough coating for 2 regular pieces. I also used garlic and Parmigiano butter. Would make it again with less salt.

Delicious, moist yet crispy. Great flavors just had to cook longer than I expected probably due to the size of the breasts. Would make again as it is simple and I have most of the ingredients.

I thought this was really good. I used honey Dijon mustard because that’s what I had. Next time I will use this on chicken tenders rather than breasts because I think the breading to chicken ratio will be better. Definitely will be making again!

One of the best, easiest chicken recipes I have made.  4 adults and 4 kids all loved it.  Even my 1 yr old granddaughter loved it!  She only has four teeth- it was so cute to watch her enjoy!
I was a little short on Panko so added some Italian breadcrumbs, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is a good basic recipe for boneless chicken that can be adapted to what you have on hand!  I used tenders, so had to cook a little longer but still turned out moist and slightly crispy. Will keep handy!

I loved this! I wasn’t able to use the white wine, but it still turned out really good. I’m definitely going to make this again.

I thought this was a bit bland, but next time I'll add some Italian herbs.  I didn't need to flatten the breast, and mine was done in 20 minutes, leaving the chicken moist and tender.

I generally liked how fast it was to make it. I did have to bake it 8 minutes longer than the suggested bake time. I also added cayenne pepper, garlic seasoning, and onion powder to the list of seasonings to mix in the bowl. It gave the dish some added flavor, along with a pinch of warmth/spice.

This recipe was great! My husband and son couldn't get enough of it. I will be making this  again and again.The white wine added a nice touch. The only thing I changed was switching the dijon mustard to honey mustard (it was all l had).

Absolutely delicious!  I used very thinly sliced chicken breasts, baked it on a rack in the oven, and served it over romaine lettuce with homemade Caesar salad dressing.  My husband loved it!

I had a very large chicken breast defrosted, but no plan for dinner. This recipe was the perfect solution! I cut the recipe in half, filleted the chicken breast thin (instead of pounding it), and it turned out well. The white meat was moist and tender. The only problem I encountered was that the chicken, still cold from the fridge, caused the melted butter in the sauce to congeal and stick to the bowl rather than the fillets. I may try brushing it onto the chicken next time.

What a yummy, easy, and flexible dish! Made as directed, except I threw the liquid into a bag and "marinated" the chicken for an hour or so. Could see changing up the spices just to keep things interesting. Will definitely make again and again!

I ended up flipping the chicken halfway through cooking in hopes that it would make both sides crispy...no such luck. BUT the chicken was moist and very flavorful. Overall, excellent recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out perfect, at least that’s what my husband said!   I honestly don’t think that I’ve had a chicken breast, come out so moist and juicy before. I will definitely make this again.

So delicious, couldn't stop eating them. I used chicken strips instead of whole breasts and baked at 425 for about 20 minutes, which I just do for any chicken recipe. Crispy, tender, and the dijon mustard really made these incredible.

This was a really good and easy to make recipe! My only issues are that 1) there definitely wasn’t enough of the bread crumb mixture to effectively coat 4 breasts and 2) maybe it’s just my taste buds but I feel that although the flavor was good, a lot of it was lost. Next time I will double all of the dry ingredients.

I didn't have white wine so i used extra butter, and I used coarse grain mustard. And I only used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 which perfectly used up the mixtures, would not have been enough for 4 ... WAS very skeptical while reading the recipe that this chicken was good enough to deserve the excellent ratings, it looks so plain and simple when you read over it! I guess that is exactly what makes it such a great recipe: it is simple, quick and truly delicious! I can see this becoming a weekly made recipe in our house! My extremely picky 11 yr old loved it and I was able to make it quickly while my 7 week old sat in her swing before she started fussing. I didn't put any extra sauces or frills  to it, just served it with a side of carrots and a side of rice. Ate the leftovers the next night with broccoli and homemade cheese sauce and it warmed up beautifully in oven at 400 degrees for about 5-10 min. Can't wait to make again next week when my husband is home from work!

AMAZING! Made it almost to the letter-I did half Panko and half Italian bread crumbs. I’m going to try just Panko next time and see if I can get it with a crunch. All in all, this was a hit and I’ll be making it again! We ate it all before I could snap a picture!

My family LOVED it. Made one change though.... sprinkled the salt (We use pink Himalayan salt), pepper, and paprika onto the pat-dried chicken prior to dredging it rather than adding it to the Panko Breadcrumbs. Served it with cold pasta salad. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

So yummy. Made chicken nuggets instead of large breast pieces. Super tasty. Made no changes to the recipe. Used fresh Parmesan cheese.

This chicken recipe was so quick and yummy. Everyone liked it and it's a keeper. I think next time I might double the dry ingredients because I didn't have enough for the last 2 pieces. I also used pecorino Romano instead of the Parmesan and used only 1/2 the salt because it's a saltier cheese.

Sooo, I doubled the parmesan cheese and Paprika. I didn't use the wine, but added about 2 Tbsp of mayo and changed the Dijon to Keens Prepared Hot mustard. This was a big hit with the family and will definitely be a repeat meal in our house. Served it with roasted whole cauliflower and grilled asparagus. Total time for the whole meal was 1 hour ( Cauliflower).

I found it delicious as did my whole family including the 2&11/12ths year old who hit 3 a few months ago and doesn’t like much except Fast Food French fries!  The portions of coating (wet and dry) were perfect for 5 breasts (I was using the IQF ones which are not as huge as  regular breasts in the store so tend to portion control a little bit easier for us. I didn’t have a white wine open so I used a table spoon of a French white wine compote and it was great, added that little back flavor of wine without being over powering. Quick, Simple, Elegant, Delicious! Thank you!!!

This has become a staple recipe in our house, my husband and 5-year old son both love it.  I usually cut the chicken into strips instead of pounding it (hint - make more coating  mix if you’re doing this as strips have more total surface area than a single breast), as it cuts down on cooking time and, let’s face it, the flavours in the coating are what make these so good, so you can’t have too much!

Doubled the breading as I like a bit more.  Added an extra 10 minutes of baking and flipped halfway through baking time.  When I flipped, I added some olive oil to the foil under the chicken as it seemed a bit dry. Turned out nicely browned, but still juicy!  Served over a bed of parmesan buttered noodles and topped all with dried parsley.  Very tasty and easy meal!

Was looking for something to whip up quickly while the baby was napping. (She doesn't nap long!) This is it! I'm so pleased! Easy! Moist! Quick! Absolutely delicious! A keeper! Spread the word! I checked mine after 20 minutes and then baked for 10 more. I did use the white wine; also fresh, shredded Parmesan and homemade bread crumbs using stale French bread. Also, I only made two large chicken breasts. I'm an improvisor!

Super easy and delicious!  I didn't have any white wine, so I just used more melted butter  (unsalted ). Instead of the salt and pepper, I used Jane's Crazy Mixed up salt. I used gluten-free Italian breadcrumbs instead of panko. I pounded the chicken to make it thin. Next time I will spray the top of the breaded cutlets so that both sides turn out crispy.

I used convection at 400 (auto sets down to 375) for 20 minutes, and substituted red wine vinegar for white wine. This was so juicy and absolutely delicious!

OK, I probably absolutely altered this recipe… However let me share my delicious findings. I didn't have Panko in the house, so I used whole wheat flour in place of it. I only had smoked paprika, so used that, I didn't have any regular drinking white wine… But I had marsala cooking wine which I used... and instead of breasts, I used 8-10 chicken tenders. The liquid and the breading were the perfect amount... and the result was delicious, although I have no clue what the actual recipe tastes like.

Although this got thumbs up from everyone in my family, the prep time was longer than 15 minutes because I ran out of both the butter mixture and crumb mixture after 3 breasts and had to mix more.  I used the Purdue Perfect Portions 5 oz chicken breasts and I pounded them slightly so that they were level in thickness. As other reviews suggested, I used Italian Style panko and I included the optional wine but left out the salt because the crumbs were seasoned.  For me, the breasts took about 30 minutes to bake and really were delicious.  Make sure to spray the foil covered pan really well or the chicken will stick to it.

Fabulous flavour. Made exactly as written without the optional wine.  Didn't need to spray the foil, either - the butter in the breading creates enough lube to keep the chicken from sticking.

I didn't have all the ingredients (this always happens).  I swapped out the paprika with Old Bay Seasoning.  Oh it turned out the bomb! Yes I said "the bomb", and yes the "90s" called and I told them to replace the paprika with Old Bay Seasoning and now they make it to this day with Old Bay Seasoning. (enter The Fringe theme song)... :)

Delicious, easy and fast- perfect for a weeknight meal.  My 9 year old daughter is an extremely picky eater and she actually ate this.  It is impossible to find something she is willing to eat.  I used Italian seasoned panko crumbs and left out the paprika, only because I didn't have any.  I used dry sherry instead of white wine.  I also used Romano cheese instead of parmesan.  The chicken was moist, tender and delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

The flavor was delicious! the only thing I left out was the white wine. My only complaint is that my cook time was almost 50 minutes (the chicken might not have been thin enough). I will definitely will be making this again.

Was in a big hurry and needed something super quick and good. I used gluten free bread crumbs and garlic powder instead of minced cloves (because of the rush), and added some oatmeal into my mixture. They turned out so tasty and tender!

Fantastic!  My husband flattened the chicken breasts so much that they were cooked in 12 minutes, so watch carefully if you don't want to overcook.

Great chicken recipe.  I also placed it on a rack in the oven so I didn't have to turn it and they came out perfect after 20 minutes at 400 degrees.   Used a Riesling white wine I had on hand. Used smoked paprika instead of plain and granulated garlic in the dry ingredients.  Great recipe and will make again and again.

I made this and I did not have Dijon mustard so I used a spicy brown mustard, aside from this small change I followed the directions entirely including the optional white wine. I don't know if I will do this next time because to me it's not worth opening up a bottle just for 2 teaspoons of wine. The recipe did not say what type of white wine to use so I used Chardonnay.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It tastes WONDERFUL!!
It is SO easy to make!!
 I now have a new chicken breast recipe.  I DID need to double the liquid wash and the breading recipes.  But that was because I had six chicken breasts.  However, even if you only have four breasts, I would still recommend  increasing the wash and the breading by one half.  This one is going into my little "favorite recipes of all time" box.

I made this for company and everyone liked it, including my 5 year old. Quick and easy to make. I will definitely make it again. I am going to try using coconut oil next time or maybe olive oil vs. the butter for a healthier fat.

Easy, moist, enjoyed by all! 5 breasts so added bit more butter, chicken stock and Dijon to increase wet bath. Dry mix was enough for all 5 with some leftover for topping. Stoneware sheet kept coating crisp not burnt as they were larger and took 35 mins. Can see how you'd have to watch if using metal pan and know your oven.

My family's new favorite chicken recipe!!! Even my mother in-law, (who doesn't really like chicken much), enjoyed it.  The chicken comes out very juicy, tender, has a good crunch without being crispy, and a delicious flavor.  It's my go to recipe!!!

After trying most new things I make, my husband says, "It's okay, but I don't know if I need it again." This recipe he liked instantly and said he wouldn't mind if this became THE go-to chicken recipe. My four-year-old boy actually ate all of it without needing prompting, which is unusual for him. I loved it so much I found myself eating the crumbs from the pan! It's moist and has just the right saltiness. I did not add white wine and used Uncle Phil's Sweet & Sassy Mustard instead of Dijon.

I was looking for something quick to make for supper...my husband absolutely loved it and my 6yr old doesn't like chicken, but he tried this and he ate just about a full breast...I will definitely make it again...so quick and easy...

My picky three-year-old asked for thirds and the 10-month-old ate her whole plate. Big hit with the family. Next time I probably won't add extra salt to the breadcrumb mixture as the Parmesan cheese made it salty enough for my taste. I would definitely make this again. Simple, fast, tasty.

My boyfriend took one bite, looked surprised, and said "That's really good, not that everything you make isn't good. But this is REALLY good."

This is one of my girlfriend's (and mine) favorite recipes. It's so quick, easy and delicious. I use chicken breast tenderloins and instead of white wine, I use extra dry vermouth. I do omit the parmesan cheese, though.

Easy to make and tasty.  I pounded out the chicken before breading to have them cook evenly.  My six year old asked for seconds. :)
