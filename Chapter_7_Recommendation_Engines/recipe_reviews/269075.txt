11.23.18  This was just so darn easy to make today using the KA stand mixer.  As with most homemade bread, all you need is time.  I used the beater blade and then when it came time to knead, put the dough hook in and let it go for about 10 minutes.  Initially, I thought this bread was going to be dense, but the texture turned out just about right.  You get a nice bite  of chocolate from the chips (wouldn’t recommend using the mini chips).   I think in the future, I’ll add more cherries, since the chocolate overpowered the cherries just a bit.  Made no changes in ingredients or amounts, and ended up with two loaves measuring about 7” diameter.  Nothing not to like here, good stuff!

Made this today and it was sooo good!  Will definitely keep this on a regular rotation.  Only change was I added a handful of chopped walnuts.  Highly recommend!
