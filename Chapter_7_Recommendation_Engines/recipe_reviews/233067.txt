I came across this recipe a couple of days ago and have been dying to try it ever since.  Our frigid weather, however, has made grilling hamburgers outdoors a dumb move – but where there’s a will there’s a way!  With a few minor adjustments to the recipe I was able to make this indoors with no muss and no fuss – as a meatloaf!   I adjusted the recipe to two servings, to use 1/2 pound ground beef.  I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder and added 1/4 cup of minced onion. To bind it I added 2 tablespoons each of bread crumbs and milk and 1/2 egg (lightly beat an egg and measure out 2 tablespoons).  I formed it into an itty-bitty loaf, topped it with some darn fine barbecue sauce, and baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  I let it set about 10 minutes before slicing it up. Each of the signature ingredients of cheddar cheese, horseradish and bacon (I used real bacon, cooked and crumbled) were barely apparent but the combination of them united to create something unique and special.  I’m glad I was determined to make this recipe and simply improvised to do so.  This was a real treat, something to remember when the weather is more cooperative to make as a grilled burger on a bun.  When I do I’ll omit the binders – the milk, bread crumbs and egg, but I’ll keep all else the same, including my additions of minced onion and barbecue sauce.  It is the bacon, cheddar and horseradish, however, that are this recipe’s delicious distinction.

Fabulous!  I was scared of the 2 Tablespoons of horseradish so I backed it down to 1 Tablespoon.  I actually weighed the meat (which I never do) and I think that for us 3 patties would have worked better than 4.  Next time I would use 1 1/2 lbs burger and the full 2 Tablespoon of horseradish.   Nonetheless, these were stellar burgers.  I used 2 slices real thick cut bacon, cooked crumbled instead of bacon bits.  My burger loving hubby LOVED these.  Thanks Lisa!

Made these tasty burgers for the recipe group June, 2014.  I enjoyed trying these burgers.  Only adjustment I could see making in this recipe is to add some moisture..sauce, something to juicy up the mix.  Enjoyed trying, thanks for your submission.

RECIPE GROUP: whoooo were my eyes watering when mixing up these burgers! But, they turned out very moist and very tasty. I used real bacon crumbles but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I mixed them up and formed the patties, then chilled for a few hours before DBF grilled them up. Served on homemade onion buns, scrumptious!

I thought this was one of the best burgers I've in quite some time!  I followed the recipe, used sharp cheddar, adding some additional on top at the end.  I used the bacon bits, which I thought added great flavor, along with the horseradish, which I felt was just the right amount.  This is definitely a keeper burger recipe at our house!!  Thanks so much for sharing, LISASNOW!!

Came out great! I use Atomic brand horseradish and cut back a bit, but if you like things spicy and have this brand, go for the whole amount. Bacon and cheese usually sounds better in a burger than it tastes - flavor usually hidden, but all the flavors came out nicely.

I made this for lunch, I'll never make it in  an inside grill! LOL! I don't know why but they stick to the top of the grill. Anyway, I didn't add the horseradish ( my mother doesn't like it ) but with the bacon and cheddar, it was delicious!

Made for Recipe Group. This burger had a nice flavor. I normally just make plain hamburgers, so this was tasty and different. It would have been excellent if I hadn't overcooked it. I was ready to take them off, but got distracted, and by the time I got them, they were a little overdone and a lot of the cheese had melted out. That was my fault though.

Recipe Group Selection:  28, June 2014 ~ This was a very good burger, but I thought with the horseradish, cheddar cheese and bacon it would have even more flavor than what it did.  I cooked bacon and crumbled it rather than using bacon bits.  The heat temp and cooking times were spot on with our grill.  Next time, I'm going to up the horseradish to 3 tablespoons.  I served this with 'Picnic Marinated Summer Slaw' and 'Awesome Red Pepper Hummus Dip' both from AR and fresh veggies and fruit.  We both really enjoyed our dinner tonight.

I had this burgers this evening and it was delicious! I made a couple changes in that I omitted the horseradish and added an egg.  Once I mixed it all together, it was a bit too runny so I put a bit of bread crumbs to make it stick better.  I also put them in the fridge for a bit first to help them stay together when grilling. Great recipe!

These were absolutely delicious! I swapped the cheddar for Colby Jack and left out the horseradish, they came out perfect. Even my picky hubby lived them.
