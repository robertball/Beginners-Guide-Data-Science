This is excellent!! I changed only a few things because I didn't have them on hand. I used left over sausage and cut and browned the sausage in the pan. Then removed the sausage and added a frozen blend of red, yellow, and green peppers with onions and sauted them in a splash of olive oil and the grease from the sausage. I also did not use red wine because I didn't have any but it was still amazing!! The flavors mixed so well and even my picky eaters loved it! :)

This was fantastic!  I had a few modifications: first, I didn't have Italian sausage on hand, so I used smoked turkey sausage instead and added my own Italian seasonings.  And I don't like mushrooms so I left those out and added chopped onion.  I will definitely make this again!

Really good.  The only thing I did differently was use hot sausage instead of mild.  Next time I'll make my own alfredo instead of buying a jar.  I think that would put it over the top!

This recipe was fantastic. I was kind of skeptical at first mixing sausage with Alfredo sauce and red wine, but I am so glad I took the risk. I actually change the  recipe up quite a bit, because of the available ingredients I have stored in my kitchen. The pasta I used was organic whole wheat rotoni. For the sausage, I used ground Italian sausage. I didn't have mushrooms, so instead I used three mixed frozen blend of red and green bell peppers, and onions. I used Newtons organic Alfredo sauce for the sauce. For a kick, I used Louisiana's Cajun spice. After browning the meat, I seasoned it with the spice, and then added the vegetables with a little olive oil. Next, I added the wine, let it reduced, and then added the sauce, cheese, and a splash of half and half. Once the pasta was done, I drained and rinsed them with cold water, and tossed them with cold press olive oil. Last, I added the pasta to the sauce, and allowed it to simmer for a few minutes, and mmm mmmm good. So surprised at how well this turned out. I Will definitely add this to my collection. Oh Yeah, baby!!!!

If I could give this more than 5 stars my whole family would.  I thought about using chicken broth but hubby and I both agree that the wine adds a great layer to it but would still taste good with chicken broth if you aren't fond of wine.  Make sure and give it enough time to reduce down.  I cut baby portabellos in half so anyone not liking them could easily put them to the side.

Not my favorite. I really enjoyed the sausage in this, but I did not enjoy the peppers. I think next time I would nix the peppers and add more mushrooms just because that is what my family enjoys. I also did not use wine.  Overall it was an ok recipe tho. I think I might enjoy it more with some homemade sauce. The jarred sauce I chose was on the bland side so I should have added some more salt and pepper and other spices.

Hubby voted.  he said it is really good. I left out the wine and reduced with chicken broth.  Maybe next time I will try the wine to see if it gets a 5.

We loved this recipe!  Yummo!  I used the spicy Italian sausage which made it so flavorful and spicy.  I also made my own alfredo sauce.  It was like we were eating a dish from a fine Italian restaurant.  Definitely would make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

We loved this, though I don't know why it's called 'spicy' b/c it wasn't at all, lol! I made my own alfredo sauce instead of using bottled b/c we prefer it. Loved the addition of the red wine, which gave this a great background flavor. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good stuff and really good cold the next day, too.  I followed the recipe as written and added a sliced yellow squash to the mixture.  Added some mozzarella cheese too!  Very good, easy dinner!

My husband and 7 year old son really liked this.  I did too.  Made exacly as directed except that I scrumbled the sausage instead of cutting into slices.  This was even better the 2nd day as lunch.  Terrific dish!

I used thin spaghetti noodles instead of the penne pasta since I messed it up. Lol. And didn't add bell pepper or mushrooms since I do not like them. But added chipotle chili pepper for the flavor. But other than that it was a great supper to make.

This dish was really good! My son love it, even brought the leftovers for lunch the next day! The only changes I made were adding some diced onion and I removed the sausage from the casing and crumbled to cook in a skillet. We will make this dish again!

I used 3 Cheese Sausage in this because it was all I could find and it was a disappointment.  The Hot and Mild sausage was more to our liking.  The rest of the recipe was fine.

Very good! Used a port and Johnsville Sweet Italian sausage which made this very good, very sweet! Obviously, spicy didn't come through as much for us, but it was still amazing!

One of those rare recipes which pleased all 4, including the teenagers. Replaced mushrooms with zucchini, and added spinach. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, and this was easy and so delicious. I normally don't do jar sauces, but for simplicity sake, I used a jarred Alfredo sauce, and it turned out fabulous. I was surprised the dish was so flavorful with so few ingredients. Next time I may double the mushrooms and bell pepper, because I like a lot of veggies. Great recipe. Thanks!

Great dish!!! I did make a couple changes.... I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and used angel hair noodles instead.   Definitely make again!
