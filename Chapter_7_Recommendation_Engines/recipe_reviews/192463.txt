This was an incredible dish that did not last long on our plates!  I did not have cream so I used milk instead and the sauce came out fine. I also could not find crawfish and stuck with immitation crab.  Overall with these adjustments it came out great and I am sure with the correct ingredients it tastes perfect!!

I made this without the crab and crawfish.  I also didn't have white pepper or parsley.  I used like 4 cloves of garlic and I think you could cut back on the butter by half.   This is really good, I think next time I will omit the flour and maybe use cornstarch? I think that would work better. or maybe not use it at all.  It sort of tastes like alfredo sauce on fish but that is fine with me :)

FANTASTIC!!!   We are in Cape  Cod on vacation and caught some beautiful fresh Sea Bass on our early morning fishing expedition. As there were no crawfish but plenty of fresh live lobster we substituted lobster for the crawfish and sea scallops for the canned crab and it was wonderful!   The only suggestion I have is deboneing the fillet so that you don't need to mess with the bones while enjoying this meal.  We served it with basati rice and fresh corn on the cob.   YUM!  Thanks, Carolyn!

I made these using talapia.  The sauce was fantastic on it's own and I thought the finished product would be just as great, but for some reason the finished product was not that good.  It was kind of washed-out in flavor.  I can't imagine that using the seabass would be any different as it is a thicker fish than talapia. Was hoping great flavor for this one, but not sure if I'll try again.  The sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon though.  Come to think of it the sauce would make a great filling for crepes.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used whole milk instead of half and half, and had to use dried parsley because I went out to the herb garden and found deer had eaten the parsley to the ground. We’ll make this recipe again. It’s very impressive looking!

This is a fantastic dish that is very easy to prepare and is elegant enough for a special dinner. The flavors of the sea bass, crawfish and crab balance each other perfectly. And yes, this is a recipe for sea bass, NOT tilapia. The flavor profiles are very different for those two types of fish. If you have tilapia, go find a recipe that uses tilapia and don't give a mediocre rating to a recipe you didn't follow!
