This turned out very dense and thick for me, but tasty.  The only change I made was substituting one more cup of whole wheat flour for white. I almost broke my Kitchenaid stand mixer while kneading this - the motor got hot and started to smell because it was so thick.

One important hint for non-expert bread bakers: When moving loaves after the second rising I bashed one of mine on the oven and it deflated very rapidly.  A friend told me I over rose the bread on the second rising.  I should have only risen it about 30 minutes and it will rise more in the oven.

How do you give wheat bread 5 stars? I like the method.  combining most of the ingredients in a sauce pan and heating to 120 then slowly pouring over 1/2 the flour /yeast mixture while in the mixer is on stir is a simple way to get the yeast working.  After it is combined add more flour until it is no longer visibly wet.  You can then change to the dough hook or turn out on the counter to knead.  "Kneading adds air" The bread is dense but you can clear that up by adding wheat gluten.  I added 1 tablespoon.

This was great bread!  The best wheat bread I've ever made.  It rose nicely and had a very good taste and texture....I'll make this again for sure.

Reduced recipe to 24 servings, doubled honey and made in my 2# bread machine on the wheat setting (use 4 teaspoons quick yeast for quick wheat cycle).  My wheat-resistant family LOVED the moist, tender, tasty loaf.  I have made it 3 more times and they are threatening to refuse all store bought bread now. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an excellent bread.  I used all wheat flour (Wheat Montana's "Prairie Gold").  Wonderful texture not heavy at all.

Great recipe!  I love a good dense bread and this fits the bill.  A hint of sweetness without being overpowering.  A new favorite of mine.

Very heavy and dense. I used bread flour not AP and I added gluten.  Still way to heavy.  Tasted good but we didn't like it for sandwiches.  I liked it toasted with homemade jam.

Followed recipe exactly and bread turned out very dense and thick. My 6 year old loved it with jelly on it, but no one else would eat it.   Sorry....

The loaf turned out wonderfully! It was the first loaf of bread I've ever made and I was pretty impressed with the results. The only downside is that the dough didn't rise as much the second time around and it barely rose during the baking process. Also, I barely tasted the honey... I will probably experiment with this a bit more to get my desired results.

Made lots of changes! I used whole wheat bread flour instead of all-purpose, & white bread flour instead of whole wheat flour, & quick-rise yeast instead of traditional yeast. Also proofed the yeast & 1tbsp of sugar in warm water for 10mins first. These changes allowed me to skip the first rising, & I just allowed the loaf to rise for half an hr after shaping it into a baguette shape (bad experience with underbaked bread in when baking in loaf pans). Brushed with milk before baking to help the crust brown & add extra moisture. The bread had wonderfully soft, thick texture. Might be worthwhile to bake it in a loaf pan & see how it goes. Baking directly on a baking sheet took only 25mins.

Very good bread---perhaps just a tad too salty and not sweet enough? I don't know...anyway, it was pretty good.

Delicious, just like Mom used to make!  The whole house smelled so homey and comforting while this baked.  I did find that the flavor was a little bland - next time I will add 1 more teaspoon of salt and increase the honey to 1/3 cup, but that's just my personal taste.  I cut the cooled loaves into halves and froze three of them so that we only had one half out at a time.  Homemade bread gets stale pretty fast, so I'm hoping this will make them stay fresh longer.  Great recipe - will make again!

I've tried many different Honey Wheat Bread recipes and this one beats them all.  My son informed me last night that it was "The best bread" I've ever made.  Pretty good rating from an eleven year old.  It rises great and is soft and tender like store bought bread. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is a great bread.  It's not quite the honey wheatI was expecting and I even bumped the honey up to 1/3 a cup.  However, I kneaded it by hand after throwing the ingredients in my mixer, and it came out beautifully!  A friend who's not usually fond of homemade bread was impressed with it!  and this is only my second batch of homemade bread ever!  A keeper for sure.

This is a good bread for sandwiches.  I heated the wet ingredients in the microwave, stirring every minute until, my thermometer read 125 degrees.  My only change was to add Vital Wheat Gluten (the box says to use 4 tsp per loaf) to the dry ingredients.  I also allowed for one extra rising time.  30 minutes was all the time needed to bake.  Cutting with an electric, serrated knife made for clean slices!

This turned out good in the bread machine.  I added a lot more honey and a touch of brown sugar because I like my bread a little sweeter.

Delicious! I made two batches, one with fresh ground hard white wheat and the other with fresh ground hard red wheat. We wanted to see which wheat made better bread. Both were delicious! I used white bread flour and added 1 T dough enhancer (available at food storage or baking supply stores)

This is a staple in our house and now that I have shared this with our friends every time I bake it I have to make 4 extra loaves to give away.
Best tasting for toasting, plain as a sandwich or just warm out of the oven with butter or served with garlic butter with dinner. There are 3 adults in our house and we will go through almost 3 loaves a week.

This bread was great! I made it to go with dinner and, still warm, there were a few sour spots. (however, the sour spots didn't stop us from eating it that's how good we thought it was!) We ate the second loaf the next day and there were no sour parts at all. Maybe I did something wrong, I had to measure out my yeast by teaspoons, not packets, so maybe my measurements were off. Would that effect the sour spots? It was still delicious. Thanks for the great recipe! I'll be making this again and again!

This was the first time I have ever made my own bread, and the results were outstanding!  I feared, from reading other comments, that it would be too dense, but it wasn't at all!  I don't like fluffy bread, and this bread's texture is just great, not dense just full-bodied.  I baked it in 9x5'' pans instead of 8x4, and it still rose well.  I also dissolved the yeast before adding it to the other liquids, instead of just adding it to the dry ingredients, because I'm just learning and wanted to stay with what the packet instructions say.  My husband raved over it, and was about as proud as I was :)

This was a great recipe.  I added 2 servings of prepared oatmeal to the dough, which made it require a bit more flour to get it back to the right consistancy. I also used soy milk instead of regular milk.  I sprinkled the tops of the loaves with a bit of raw sugar, canola spray, and flax seed.  Very tasty bread indeed, my best yet! The recipe gave me two fat loaves (I like the natural look and don't use bread pans).

I make this bread all the time. It always comes out great. The only thing I have edited over time was to use half the amount of instant coffee because with the full amount it has a definite coffee flavor, which is not what I want from a honey wheat recipe.

I was looking for a new wheat bread recipe for a change, and this recipe was wonderful.  I did not have difficulty with it being too dense, and I found the flavor spot-on.  Just sweet enough, but not too sweet.  I have dark aluminum pans, so I didn't need the full 40 minutes to bake (35 did the trick).  Will definitely put this in my 'recipes to make again' pile!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if this just isn't something I can do well. It turns out heavy for me however it still taste good and it's filling.
It didn't rise very well for me but maybe that has to do with the fact that I live in a cold area, I always pre heat my over and set the bowl with the dough in it on a cookie sheet on the stove top.
My white bread always comes out great but am having issuses with the wheat, think I'm gonna try fast rise yeast next time.

The bread didn't rise as high as I would've liked... the taste is good although I've baked better in the past. Usually when I bake fresh bread close to a loaf will be gobbled by the family before it can cool all the way. I actually had to freeze one so that it wouldn't stale. It is entirely possible that I did something wrong as I am a very amateur baker!

I finally made your recipe a few days ago and it tasted wonderful to everyone that ate it.  We have a little left, but I know I will make it again tomorrow.  
If you make dinner rolls with your recipe you'll have to bake it less time. So I think it's just great.
Thank you very much for sharing your recipe.

What a great recipe! i ended up killing the yeast by heating the milk too much so my bread did not rise properly. it turned out to be a dense bread that was hard but still had a good flavor. next time i will be more careful with the yeast!
