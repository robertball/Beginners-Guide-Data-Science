Maybe the most delicious scone I've ever had in my life. I used whole wheat flour in the picture I posted above. Had to add a tiny bit extra moisture but I'm not the most accurate flour measurer. Also extended my cook time a bit to about 18 minutes. They are so fluffy and awesome even though whole wheat. The lemon yogurt with baking soda was a great idea! I also upped the lavender a bit but maybe wouldn't have to. I used about three teaspoons and they're very strong.

Was looking for a lavender recipe to use fresh lavender from our CSA.  These scones were so easy and delicious!  I used lavender leaves instead of flowers because it's what I have.  Subbed half whole wheat flour, and did not have lemon yogurt, so used plain yogurt + juice of 1 lemon.

This recipe was great! I divided it in half, and realized very near the end but I didn't have a lemon, so I used orange zest but lemon yogurt. I'm enjoying a scone right now, and it is delicious! If you're looking for suggestions, I would bake them a little longer. I would also add a little more lavender!

This is a fantastic recipe! I just made a batch exactly as written, and they are just delicious.  Fluffy with nice subtle hints of the lavender and lemon.

Delicious and quick to put together.  I shredded the frozen butter and will do that from now on. We really didn't taste the lavender but loved the lemon. I used a lot less sugar and lemon juice and had plenty of glaze. Will definitely use the recipe again. I think a few blueberries along with the lemon would be yummy.

I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I used vanilla.  I didn't have lemons, so I used orange zest.  The scones were very good, but I think they would be better made as directed.  Gonna have to get some lemon yogurt!  
I patted the dough out as for biscuits and cut them with a 2" round cutter.  They were really cute.

We really enjoyed them. I used half white and whole wheat flour. Would try a little more lavender next time. Will make them again for sure.

I tasted like oil and really crumbly, but not horrible.

These are wonderful!  I have made several times, I follow the recipe as is,  and they always come out perfectly.  
Try the "Perfect Lemon Curd" recipe on Allrecipes along with my suggestions on that one.  Clotted cream is so easy.  You can order NON ultra pasteurized heavy cream from Whole Foods, pour into glass baking dish, and bake at 175 degrees for twelve hours (overnight).  Cool, skim off the clotted cream and refrigerate.  You can cook with the remaining cream or bake a little longer to get more clotted cream.

I did not make any changes but if I make them again I would add more lemon zest as I would like a stronger lemon flavor

The lavender should be finely chopped to release more of that flavor and the lemon yogurt and zest overpowered the lavender so there was no balance of flavors. Also the texture was not that of a scone - this was too moist. Next time I will use an authentic scone recipe, omit the lemon yogurt and use lemon juice and zest, maybe even organic extract and chop the lavender.

I made a lemon drizzle to pour over it and scattered lavender seeds on top Very pretty plus  telling what was in the scones.

Followed directions exactly but they were very doughy, I had to leave them in another 12 minutes.  Could have went 1-2 more even.  Tasted very good tho.

Can I use this recipe in my book I'm writing about scones?! I love this so much that I really want to add it, and your account would be mentioned when I say where I got it from!
