Fantastic and my kids went crazy!  We don't get snow in NC often, so I'm sure this chocolate snow cream created a special memory for them.  Thanks!

I've made Snow Ice Cream for 50 years. My changes:
1. Use only white snow.
2. I used to make this in Northern Vermont. The outside temperature should be 0-20F.
3. For the liquid component, use Half-and-Half instead of condensed milk. Condensed or Evaporated Milk transfer a canned taste to the mixture. Use regular cane sugar, no Corn syrup. Molasses and Maple syrup are each  desirable to add sweetness.
Add a pinch of salt to the mixture.
4. Put all the liquid ingredients in a plastic bowl, snow in a separate bowl. Set bowls back outside and look for surface of the liquid mix to start making needle-like crystals on the surface. That part should only take a few minutes. The chilling of the liquid ingredients is important!
5. When you are ready for the final step have a spatula and heavy wisk ready to go.
6. Scrape the liquid bowl into the snow bowl with the spatula and fold the liquid into the snow. Use the whisk if needed to finish up the blending.
7. If the mixture begins to turn soupy, set the mixing bowl outside again and wait for the mixture to harden a bit. 
8. Ready to serve (quickly)! Four to six servings is about the maximum to handle at once!

It may be a bit difficult the first time you try, but after you've tweaking the mixture to your liking, go ahead ahead with extra garnishes like fruits, nuts, berries, candy chips, etc.
