One of my favorite summertime drinks! We often make this to take with us when walking at the zoo at night during the summer.

Now I have been looking at this recipe for a while and decided that I was going to make it today no matter what! I made it with what I had... No marshmallow stuff and no expresso.. Instead I just added a cup of coffee and its WONDERFUL! Oh yea and no graham cracker crumbs!

My husband loves Starbucks S'mores coffees so I decided to look up if there was a recipe for the same thing.  He loves it and now every time he wants one all i have to do is make it real quick.

i followed the recipe to the letter - i used whole milk and could probably have blended it a little bit longer so that the marshmallow fluff was better blended in. other than that it was "so good" according to my taste tester 9 year old! :)

My daughter and I both really liked this. It was a nice way to get our coffee fix and start off this balmy morning.
This recipe worked out well using my frappe maker machine.
