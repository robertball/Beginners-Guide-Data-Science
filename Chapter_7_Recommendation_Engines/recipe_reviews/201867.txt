This recipe was so delicious!  We loved the venison instead of the pork, and it is so much healthier!  Made it for the whole family, everyone wanted seconds...and thirds, great recipe we will use again and again.

I was out of venison steak so I opted for burger instead.  Because the consistency reminded me of traditional bisquits and gravy I added 1 tsp, maybe a little more, of poultry seasoning(to give it the sausage flavor) and a little cayenne pepper.  It was delicious.  I was reluctant to add the maple syrup at first but it added such a nice flavor.  Thanks for the new addition to my recipe box and another way to cook the deer in the freezer.

Very good. I am always looking for new ways to fix venison and while I don't like gravy my husband is a big fan. After fixing this dish for him I asked him if this was something he would want again (my test gauge) and he replied "yes, definitely!".

This was good but even adding more maple syrup it still just tasted like regular gravy.

I made this delicious and healthy venison recipe tonight for dinner and let's just say there's not much left over! I'm always looking for new recipes to try with my deer meat. This one so far is my TOP FAVORITE. My boyfriend really loved it to. I enjoy reading the reviews and agree with adding 1/2 cup of additional flour and that made the biscuit perfect. I cooked mine the full 14 minutes in the oven... DELICIOUS!!! All in all I LOVE this Recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!!

The gravy was excellent. This was my first time cooking deer sausage and I was worried how this would turn out. The gravy was smooth and creamy with a slightly sweet taste that complimented the deer perfectly.  Everyone in the house loved it, both kids and adults!

The biscuits could use a little work. I added about 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe after mixing it up and seeing how runny the biscuit dough was. This helped me to form biscuits. They cooked up well, but they were crispy and crunchy on the outside making them hard to cut on the plate.  

I will continue using this gravy recipe for our weekend breakfasts, but will go back to using the biscuit recipe in my better homes and gardens cookbook.

Gravy was amazing!! Had to add about 1/2 cup of flour to the biscuits since they were too watery.

Recipe was delicious.  Loved the gravy and I don't like gravy.  The biscuits only need 1/4 cup of milk.

I am only reviewing the biscuits. They tasted fine, but the batter was so thin they cooked up more like pancakes. Bleh
