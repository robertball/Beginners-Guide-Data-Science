Excellent summer dessert! I took the suggestion of decreasing the hot water so it set well and in good time. 
You can exchange the strawberries for mandarin oranges and use orange geletin for a nice change.

The pie was very tasty!  The only thing is that is took much longer than 20 minutes to firm.  Maybe it was just me, but we even put in in the refrigerator and it still didn't firm.  But it was very easy, and very tasty.  If you like strawberry, you'll love this recipe!!

I found it to work much better when I eventually froze it, as it never really appeared set in the fridge, despite 5 hours of chilling.

This is an easy and delicious make ahead dessert, but I substituted a walnut crust for the graham cracker crust == even MORE scrumptious!!!
The strawberries with the walnuts = an interesting, complimentary, and unexpected taste combination.

A bit messy... I've only refrigerated it, so i wonder if letting it set in the freezer would turn out... Very tasty!!

The pie was okay.  But it took a lot longer than recipe said for the mixture to harden.  But pie was fairly good.

Very refreshing pie that we all enjoyed tonight. Made this in the morning so by the time we were ready for dessert, it was perfect. So good and thanks Jill!

I used SF strawberry jello and NF frozen yogurt. I let the jello cool a bit then folded soft frozen yogurt at the same time I added the strawberries in order to prevent icicles in the pie. This made quite a bit of filling, too much for one 8 inch pie. I poured the excess into dixie cups, let them set up a bit, and stuck popsicle sticks in them. I thought it was okay for a low-sugar, low-fat pie but the family was indifferent. I'd make this again for myself. I think if I were to make this again, I would use frozen sliced strawberries which would cause the jello to firm up a bit, then fold in the frozen yogurt.

So good, and easy!  I have made this pie so much people think it is a speciality of mine and are always requesting it and asking for the recipe.  The times however are off it takes longer for pie to set.  HOWEVER....  I have found that if you put the filling and pie in the freezer it sets much faster.

I had something similar to this recipe as a child and I've been looking for it for years. The texture of jello and ice cream together was so unusual that I've always remembered it.

This pie is pretty good, although my kids didn't like it. I made it with only 1 cup of water, and it firmed up quite nicely.

I haven't made anything like this before, and had extra little helpers in the kitchen and we all enjoyed making this, and then the kids devoured them.  We made 3 of them and they all turned out great and everyone loved it.

I'm not a fan, generally, of pies made from a list of pre-packaged ingredients, but tried this one because of the ice cream instead of Cool Whip, and the fresh fruit.  My aunt used to make a Jell-O salad with strawberries and ice cream and I loved it.  So, perhaps given all that, my expectations were...well, not this.  I didn't care for this pie because of the texture (too firm and Jell-O like) and because of the firmness the fruit didn't incorporate well.  Based on the other reviews, maybe I did something wrong.

Overall a great recipe, however it is WAY too much filling for a 9 inch pie pan. Additionally, it doesn't include any kind of garnishings.

Pretty good.  I didn't know what kind of texture to expect with this.  I'm not a jello fan, but I liked this a lot.  I didn't add the strawberries into the pie, I put them on top, that way the picky eaters would still eat it!  Also, the gelatin separated a bit at the bottom of the pie, so there was a tiny sliver of strawberry jello at the bottom.  My husband loved it!  He thought that the pie looked like the ones from the movie "Hook" that they have the food fight with.
