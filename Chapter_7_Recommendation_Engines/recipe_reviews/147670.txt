This is awesome!  I made with light Miracle Whip.  Skipped the onion.  I almost added more liquid as it seemed very light on dressing when I made it.  Glad that I didn't, however, as it moistened up after sitting in the refrigerator for awhile. I also added some celery seed as we like that in our coleslaw.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks.

I like my slaw more on the vinegar side then the sweet side so I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, doubled the vinegar and instead of milk, I used buttermilk. If you can, make this the day before you need it...it's worth the wait.

This is now the ONLY cole slaw dressing that I'll make. (We used to use Marzetti which everyone liked, but this is so easy and delicious.)  The ingredients are always in our home, making it easy to whip it together. I made this 2 days ago and what was left over tastes even BETTER!  Make it a day or 2 in advance and it only improves.  AMAZING.  Don't change a thing. Thanks for this recipe Cookingnut!

This is very much like the cole slaw we make in our deli where people come from miles around for the cole slaw!  Except you don't really need the milk or the lemon juice.  The mayonaise is enough without the milk and the vinegar doesn't need the lemon juice.  We also don't use onions in our slaw.  The dressing-Mayo, sugar and vinegar will definitely get much juicier as it sits.  Shredded cabbage and carrots with the mayo, vinegar and sugar is all that we put in ours and it's famous for several counties around.

Yummy! I gave this 4 stars only because i did add celery seed, celery, upped the vinegar (because I thought it was a little sweet)and reduced my mayo. Very good! Ok so I did some tweeking to meet my preferences, but this gave me the good foundation I needed for the slaw. I did use onion powder instead of an onion only b/c my hubby would kill me if he found onion in his food! LOL. Will use it again! Thanks!

Great recipe. I'd like to pass one ingredient to substitute for sugar. I have always used sweet gherkin liquid. It gives me my personal sweet side of the sweet/vinegar side of my slaw.

I made a half dose of those recipe, but it produced quite a bit.  Followed halved recipe to a t, but was disappointed to find that while it did produce the KFC flavor, it lacked the kick that I was expecting.  That vinegar-fume-in-the-lungs kick. Will wait for it to marinate overnight and taste again.

LOVE this recipe!  This is coming from someone who has hated coleslaw her whole life.  I think I only ever had store bought, which I think is nasty.   

This coleslaw makes a delicious side dish, especially w/bbq pulled pork sandwiches.  It's super easy to prepare and it's always a hit.  

I do prefer to put cider vinegar in mine.  I've made it both ways, but the cider vinegar just adds a little something that I prefer.

I made this to go with pulled pork and it was awesome.  I made this as directed except I used bagged lettuce.  I used it today, for a wedding I was cooking for.  Changed the serving size to 80 and it still tastes awesome.  Can't wait till we eat it tomorrow.

Too sweet for my taste, so I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup and upped the lemon juice to 3 Tbsp and the vinegar (used apple cider vinegar) to 2 Tbsp.Other than that, added some celery seed (what Cole slaw is complete without it?) and it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

Kids never want cole slaw, do they?  4th of July family party, and my nephew couldn't stop raving about the cole slaw.  I don't think he'd ever had "homemade", LOL.  I used half purple cabbage, half green and shredded finely, so it turned pink!  I also chose apple cider vinegar.  I took another reviewer's advice & cut the sugar to 1/4 c.  No one thought it tasted like KFC's & that turned out to be a good thing.

This was great.  I left out the onion because I was too lazy, but this dressing is the best....and goes great on top of a pulled pork sandwich.

Well I'll be darned!  This does taste VERY close to ol' KFC's slaw, and I just love the stuff so I was pleasantly surprised and  pleased when I did my taste testing (which turned into just plain old eating haha)!  I tripled the recipe for a church pot-luck and I made sure to include this wonderful recipe.  Thanks for this winner!

Other than using Miracle Whip instead of mayo and a plain, old yellow onion instead of sweet, I made this as directed.  The recipe truly is Aw-some!

I am NOT a fan of cole slaw so when hubby requested it I said OK only if I can make it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  Not too sweet, not too tangy and not a ton of liquid.  I think I ate more of it than he did!

We needed a quick cole slaw for some oyster po'boys. Used some finely shredded cabbage and added just a touch of Chesapeak Bay seasoninig to this recipe and it was totally outstanding. I will use this tasty recipe over and over. Thank you.

My very favorite coleslaw. So so good! I made homemade mayo one day, since I was out of regular store bought and that really upped the tangy homemade flavor. Any time I can do so, I will make the homemade mayo with this.

Made this for dinner and it was amazing. I only put about 2 TBS of sugar and it was just the right amount of sweetness. So easy to make, I used a pre-made bag of cole slaw and I whipped this up in about 5 minutes and it tastes way better than any store bought cole slaw that you could by. So YUMMY!

Wonderful! I'm a huge fan of dressing, so I doubled the recipe. After a day in the fridge, it had a lot of liquid at the bottom, but I love it like that. I kept stirring the coleslaw around each day and it stayed nice and moist. Fed this to the hubby and some friends and they couldn't get enough!

A THOUSAND STARS FOR THIS ONE!!I'm from Argentina. The first time i tried Cole Slaw was when i was 5 years old and i was with my family in Miami, FL. We tried it in KFC. WE LOVED IT. Unfortunately we don't eat that here. I've just made this recipe. I left it for 6 hours in the fridge. O M G!!! I feel im back to that time in the USA. Seating there in KFC eating the huge thing of fried chicken together with the biggest size of cole slaw. I think that if you prepare it the day before it will taste sio much better.

Well...the dressing was easier to throw together than to drive the 30 minutes into town.  That is about the most positive thing I can say about this recipe.  I followed the directions to a T and although it looked pretty the first day, the taste was very mild/bland.  The second day it was super runny and the taste even blander.  Definitely not to my family's liking.  We will try another recipe next time.

This really IS restaurant-style coleslaw!  I even cheated and used packaged Tri-Color Coleslaw mix and modified the dressing slightly to use what I had on hand - using onion salt instead of the onion, apple cider vinegar, and adding a little celery seed.  I also pulsed the coleslaw mix a few times in the food processor to get a finer texture.  It was dee-lish!  Perfect accompaniment for all those summertime BBQ's and fish fries!  Sharing my photo of it.

IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A COLE SLAW, YOU CAN STOP LOOKING.THIS IS THE BEST COLE SLAW THERE IS.
THE ONLY THING I DO DIFFERENT IS TO ADD 1/2 TEASPOON OF CELERY SEEDS.

I have waited 3 days for this to turn out to be an amazing slaw.  Unfortunately it still hasn't.  While I agree with previous reviewers that the slaw MUST marinate AT LEAST 24 hours, I still can't give it 5 stars even after 3 days of marinating.  Here's my complaint... The dressing has never permeated the cabbage.  This is like eating plain cabbage with a milky soup in the bowl.  The two have never "joined".  My family commented that every bite requires a spoon full of the watery dressing to give the cabbage any flavor or else it's tasteless.  Not sure why it never combined well, but something is missing in this.....  Sorry for the bad rating, but as one other reviewer posted, "i'm still looking for the best".   This is not it.   Although it was not distasteful, I would not serve it to company.

I love this coleslaw.  I used one bag of prepard cabbage and cut the recipe in half.  It was great. The longer you keep it in the fridge it gets tastier. At least make it the day before you want to serve it.

Very easy to make. I skipped the onions and cut the ingredients in half to make a smaller batch. Then I felt sorry for not making a bigger batch. Yum Yum!!!

Just tried this recipe and it's amazing. Love it and will only use this one going forward. I also agree it reminds me of the KFC slaw which is my all time favorite slaw!!!!  So glad I found this recipe and tried it.

AWESOME and EASY!!  Only change i made did make this dish a snap.  Used a 1 lb (16 oz) bag of coleslaw with carrots.  I poured the cabbage on a cutting board and used a chef's knife to chop it up even more than it was.  Other than that I followed recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I've reviewed at least 8 coleslaw recipes on this site and this moves to the top.  As others said .. A lot like KFC.  Thanks submitter.

I used a pre-packaded bag of classic cole slaw, so I'm not sure about the amounts of veggies in he slaw. I cut back to about 2 tbsp of sugar but kept everything else the same. I haven't let it chill and can't stop eating it!

This coleslaw is fantastic!!! Tastes just like KFC!  I used Fresh Express pre-packed cabbage and left out the onion (didn't have any on hand) and it was great!!!! Definitely needs to sit, preferably overnight.  It's not quite the same if eaten right away.  Will definitely make again and again!

From now on this is the only recipe I'll ever use for coleslaw. The only change I made was using 1 teaspoon of onion powder instead of the sweet onion (I didn't have any). In case anyone was wondering a 16 ounce bag of prepackaged slaw mix worked perfectly and the recipe made PLENTY of sauce.

I was out of some ingredients to make my usual slaw dressing, so I decided to try this similar recipe. Other than being a little thinner, it was a delicious substitute, that I will make again.

Really good!  It tastes just like KFC if that's what you're looking for.  The cabbage DOES need to be cut very small as others suggested.  I've never cut up a head of cabbage for coleslaw before and found it to be very tedious so I left my pieces a bit larger... would have been better cut small.  After I made this I remembered my mother using the blender to cut up cabbage for her coleslaw (way back when,) so I might try that.   This was really good but I'm still looking for my perfect coleslaw recipe (I would make this again however.)  Thanks for the post!

I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, added dried parsley flakes, chopped celery and celery seed, it was all I could do to stop myself from eating the entire batch.

So very tasty.  I did have to add a bit more of the "sauce" as the recipe still had it a bit too dry for me.  Wowza!  Really great.  My son who is major picky eater (he's 7) even loved it.  Doubt I will make cole slaw any other way from this point on.

GREAT recipe.  I am kind of a cole slaw snob as I dont like many that you can get in restaurants.  However, I tried this with pulled bbq chicken and it was fantastic.  I will be making slaw like this every time!

Excellent and simple. Like others I halved the sugar and it was fine. Keeps well for a few days too. Add a handful of seeds (sesame/sunflower) for a crunch.

I just whipped some up to go with some shredded chicken BBQ sandwiches and it tastes excellent. I am sure it will be better tomorrow, but is great now. I had no carrots in the fridge so used some purple cabbage for color and a little celery seeds. YUM!

Pretty darn delicious.  I used one bag of shredded cabbage and recalculated the servings at 8 (about 6 cups of cabbage).  It was so good 2 of us ate 1/2 of it.  Ooops!

Well, this is it - the perfect cole slaw recipe (in my humble opinion).  I have made it 4 times now and just love it - it is always best on top of pulled pork sandwiches.  It does remind me of KFC's slaw but I like it much better because I prepared it myself and feel confident in eating it!!  It is sweet with a good bite and I seriously can't stop eating once I start.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good cole slaw. I recommend making it the day before as it certainly tasted better the next day. The only thing I changed was the amount of the ingredients because we are a family of 3. Even scaling it to serve 4 was a lot of cole slaw so be prepared.

Pretty good. Maybe a little too much tang from the lemon juice and vinegar, but this is pretty good overall.

This was soo tasty. I never knew how easy it was to make coleslaw!!! I omitted the onion (only had red ones on hand, and didnt want to use those) and took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a lil bit of old bay seasoning.. Sooo sooo good!! Hopefully the hubby likes it when he gets home.. Paired this with texas slow cooker pulled pork!! great combo...

Great recipe!  I make a batch of this once a week to have on hand as an easy side dish.  I used 1.5 tsp. of stevia extract in place of the sugar (we're trying to control sugar intake in our house).  I also used a bag of pre-assembled cole slaw veggie mix, which worked just fine.  We did eat it right out of the bowl, and it was fine, but it was much better the next day.

Simple, easy and delicious!  I put everything in my food processor because I hate chopping.  I like it chopped finely because I don't have to chew as much:)  I used a little less sugar but it was still nice and sweet.  Far superior to KFC coleslaw.

Awesome cole slaw!!! I made one other recipe that was ok, but this was outstanding! I used 2 bags of cole slaw mix & doubled the sauce recipe. Served it for our housewarming party & there was hardly any left!!! Definitely a hit! Will be keeping this recipe from now on!

I made this and my hubby thought it was better than Bob Evans cole slaw, which use to be his fav! :) I know this one will be a regular on our table from now on. The only diff I did from original recipe was to use Miracle Whip, we never have mayonnaise. But everything else I kept the same and it did improve over time too! Thanks for submitting this CoOkInGnUt!

This is just what i was looking for in a slaw. If you like your slaw sweet and not tangy than look no further!! This is truly awsome cole slaw. Thanks for sharing i will for sure use this recipe from now on. I saved time by using bagged slaw mix and that worked wonderfully!

As I read the ingredients, I see I forgot the milk, vinegar and lemon juice. I usually just use Marzetti slaw dressin. But I have gotten so I don't like it. Anyway, I used mayonaise, sugar, cabbage (of course), carrots, and onions. Salt and pepper to taste, I added celery seed, garlic and onion powder and we ate it for dinner as soon as I made it. I imagine it will be better tomorrw. I didn't leave the mentioned ingredients out purposly. I was just in a hurry and forgot. The slaw was very, very good.  Mrs. Dodley

Have taken it to church two weeks in a row and came home with only leftover juice both times.  I'm not a huge fan cole slaw, but I even had seconds of the batch that I made for us at home.  It truly does take like KFC which has always been my favorite.

This coles slaw was easy and delicious.  I have never made cole slaw before, but I know now I will never buy store bought cole slaw again!  It does taste like KFC, so make sure you like your cole slaw on the sweet side.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent! This was my first attempt at making cole slaw. I admit I cheated a little by buying the pre-bagged stuff, only because of time restrictions. Next time I'll chop my own. I cut down on the sugar and only added a couple of TBS. I also used apple cider vinegar rather than plain white vinegar and that added a better sweetness to it. Fresh lemon juice and freshly ground pepper, 15 hours in the fridge and it tastes soooo good. It's too bad I'm the only one in my house that likes cole slaw!

very yummy Cole slaw. I did use bagged Cole Slaw. While I was making it I was scared there wasn't enough of the mayo mixture, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours it was perfect.

This is my new favorite cole slaw recipe.  I made it for the 4th of July and everyone loved it.  I did have to leave out the onion as one guest cannot eat them.  It's probably even better with the addition of the onions.  I made it the night before so the flavors could marry.

Made this for a Mother's Day barbecue and everyone loved it! Tasted great! Dressing is a little too runny though... I'll probably use a little less milk next time. Other than that, I used bagged cole slaw mix and omitted the onions. Does taste a lot like KFC's slaw!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I am picky about cole slaw, but this one won me over. I made it for a spring picnic and found that it was a hit. Just a note: I subbed cider vinegar for white vinegar. It gave it just a little more flavor and aroma.

I quickly made this tonight for dinner - served it immediately.  It was amazing!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar (probably used about 4 Tbsp Splenda) and it was perfect.  I'm betting it will be even better tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used Miracle Whip Light and omitted the onions when I made this for a touring choir from Korea that was performing at our church. I wasn't able to attend the concert, but the choir director told me that "it was perfect and gobbled up by 50 hungry Koreans."  This is similar to the recipe my mom always made except for the lemon juice. That's a wonderful addition. One suggestion: make sure all ingredients are the same temperature. I had a nervous moment when I added cold milk and lemon juice to room temperature Miracle Whip and sugar.

I don't usually like cole slaw because I'm not a fan of mayonnaise based salads but this slaw was great and tangy.  The lemon juice and vinegar are a great combination.  We loved it.

This recipe tastes a lot like KFC slaw.  I used light mayo because that's all I had.  I think I would've liked it better with real mayo.  I didn't add onion.  It's a good recipe, but it didn't knock my socks off.  Still, if you're a big fan of KFC's slaw, you should give this a try!

Wow! This coleslaw WAS awesome! It has the perfect flavor of sweetness, creaminess, and tartness...and not overly thick w/ mayo. I used my own proportions and I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lime and it still turned out great--I got HUGE compliments for it at my party yesterday!

It's a very good slaw if you like sweet slaw!  It was too sweet for me, so I will decrease the sugar next time.  The flavor is delicious and fresh, though.  Made it as written- I think it will improve overnight, too.  It's a thinner sauce consistency than some other, more mayonnaise laden dressings, so if you like your slaw swimming in white sauce, this isn't the one- lots of good taste in a thinner coating of dressing.

This is my go to coleslaw recipe. I was coleslaw challenged before this recipe. I do change the amounts of lemon juice and vinegar for my tastes. Its very forgiving, so you can play around with it to your liking as well!

Calculated this recipe using 8 servings to compensate for the 14oz precut coleslaw cabbage at the grocery store.  Only marinated it for one hour while cooking the rest of our dinner.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the easy and basic recipe.

Excellent recipe! I made a few minor changes - I upped the vinegar to 2 tbsp and I also substituted 6 packets of Stevia for the sugar to make it a bit healthier. I added a cup of carrots (instead of 1/2 cup) and I didn't have any onion so I didn't add it. 

Just tried the first few bites before putting it away in the fridge and it was already delicious! Can't wait to eat it when its done. This recipe is a keeper!

Made as directed with only two slight variations -- not a single onion in the house so I used onion powder; and I added celery seed. The result was a super slaw. Loved it. I'll make it again.

I've tried a lot of coleslaw recipes, and they were just not right.  Not so with this one.  I followed the recipe as stated and it turned out so delicious!  It is important to let it sit the 3 or more hours.  I tried it right away because it was meal time, and it was pretty good.  Then later I got another bowl, and then a second.  It was hard to leave it alone.  Great Recipe! I've thought about adding a little celery seed and a grated apple to this.  I haven't tried it yet.

I made this using my Ninja professional blender.  Wow!  The dressing is the perfect compliment to the vegetables.  Great for hot dogs, or as a side dish with any meal. This is my official staple recipe for cole slaw.

This was a very tasty cole slaw. Not too sweet or tangy and it was great with our beef dip sandwiches. Will make again to go on pulled pork sandwiches. My only change was to add celery seed because I love it. Also, you can make this ahead of time for a quick dinner.

Very Tasty ! Used premix slaw and added just a bit of Miracle Whip above and beyond the 1/2 cup of Mayo ... personal preference only.

This is my go to recipe base anytime I want to make coleslaw!  I use a package slaw mix and then mix up the dressing.  I highly suggest making it the day before you want to serve it.  It's good about 3-4 hrs from when you make but SO much better the next day.  My kids go crazy when they find out I'm making it.  Besides using a package of the slaw mix the only other thing I do is add some celery seed.  Turns out delicious!

I like this coleslaw. So much better than others I have tried on the site with tons of sugar. I didn't have to adjust this one for overly sweetness. I bought a bag of angel hair cut cabbage that was 10oz. I measured it out to be 5 cups, so I made 1/2 recipe. I did the smallest size of carrot on my grater and minced the onions finely with a knife. I used mayo with olive oil, as it is what I have, and apple cider vinegar. Only change I really made is I cut the lemon juice in half as I always find lemon dominant in dressings and added about 1/8-1/4 tsp of poppy seeds per other recipes. Thanks

This is my basic cole slaw recipe minus the onions. The onions make a huge difference in flavor. I served this with Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit!

This tastes just like the name says, AWESOME!  After trying several cole slaw recipes, I can quit searching.  When my boyfriend tasted this cole slaw, he told me to throw out my old recipes because this is the only one he wants from now on.  I agree!  Yay

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly except I did not add the onions.  Came out perfectly and my husband loved it.  I agree with the other reviewers that you must let this refrigerate at least over night.

Made this a few times now with slow cooker ribs.....instant family favorite!  I have a guilty pleasure for KFC cole slaw and that's what drew me to this recipe.  So easy, made w items I always have on hand and I use the bagged chopped cabbage blend.  Definitely keeping this one in. My recipe box!

This dressing was way to sweet. I added more mayo and some horseradish to give it some tang. I will make this again but next time I will cut back on the sugar.

I was getting home late from shopping and needed to whip up something fast. I had pork barbeque and I love cole slaw with it. Looking for something quick and easy I found this recipe-Perfect! It is delicious as is. I did use a bag of already shredded cole slaw, but it turned out soooooo good. Thank you, thank you for this great easy quick recipe!

This was great! Only modification I made was shredded one medium sized head of white cabbage (which yielded about 8 cups), then shredded about a cup of red cabbage for some flavor and color contrast. Also cut sugar a bit to Â¼ cup to let more vinegar through. Just a personal preference. Thanks for posting!

This is very good and so easy to make. My husband said it was the best cole slaw he has ever eaten and he loves cole slaw. No need to ever buy dressing in a jar again. I added minced dried onion to the mayo/milk mixture and some celery seed, plus added another tablespoon or so of vinegar and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. I let the dressing sit for a few hours in the fridge before I put it on the cabbage. Excellent! A keeper!

This is the best coleslaw!!! It does taste just like KFC!!! I left out the onion because my husband doesn't like onion and doubled the liquid because we like it juicy.  I've been looking for a good slaw recipe for a long time and this is it!  I've made it a couple times now.  You will not be disappointed!!!!!

I've made this a few times already -- it's delicious!  The 9 1/2 cups cabbage is just about a whole cabbage.  I even made half a recipe when I had half a small cabbage handy, used less than the half.  I guesstimated the amounts (3/4 tablespoon vinegar, etc.) and it worked out fine. One time it was too liquid -- go careful with the milk, add more later if needed.  Thanks for this great simple recipe for cole slaw -- for years I thought it was a big deal to make!

This is seriously good coleslaw and ingredients I always have on hand!  I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup because I was scared it would be too sweet and it was perfect for our tastes.  I also left out the onions because I don't like them.  Thanks for sharing, this is my new go-to slaw recipe!

So far it does taste awesome, didn't realize it had to chill for three hours. I did use apple cider vinegar instead.

Hands down THE best Cole Slaw recipe I've ever tried.  Fairly quick to make with just a few common ingredients so no need to make a shopping run.  Love it!!  If possible make the night before to allow all the flavors to marry.

Excellent Cole slaw.  I added a bit more mayo in mine.  Made a big batch for Easter and it was a hit!  To add a bit of heat I cut up a large jalapeno.

Delicious!  I skipped the carrots and onion as I was in a hurry, and as other reviews mentioned added celery seed.  Looking forward to making it with the carrots and onions and letting it sit overnight. I will cut the sugar by 1/3 next time to make it healthier.  This is faster and much lower in calories than the "Blue Cheese Coleslaw" from this site (which I love!) and will be my new go to recipe for Coleslaw for non special occasions!

This was good eatin'!  I'm not a coleslaw fan, but this converted me.  I cut the sugar in half, left out the onions, added an extra tablespoon of vinegar and at the advice of another reviewer, I added two tablespoons of sesame oil. Oooh this is so good!  Everyone loves it.

I alway make a recipe as it calls for the first time I make it.  I made this as is, and it was very tasty, but liquidy. I think next time I make it, I will sub sourcream for the milk and cut back on the lemon juice.

This was great.  I was very loose with the ingredients (just squeezed the juice of half a lemon that I had on hand) and did add a good couple of shakes of dried dill weed.  It was great.

This is AWESOME! I made this quickly, and only refrigerated it for about 30 minutes. It was yummy!
I come from a long line of cole slaw eaters and they
all said it was the best! I'm saving the recicpce for myself! I told them i would bring it to all the parties! ( kidding)

This is really good slaw. Decreased mayo to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of sour cream to give it a bit of a tang. Great recipe.

I made a few changes, as I tend to do. I decreased the sugar to about an 1/8 of a cup and then substituted buttermilk for the milk. I also added a couple of dashes of celery salt. I did leave it in the fridge overnight and it turned out great!

Not a big fan of coleslaw but I had a fish fry for my father's 85th birthday and people expect coleslaw.  This coleslaw was a huge hit and I directed many people to this recipe.  I did try it and I admit it was pretty good.

YUM!!!    Recipe didn't say if vinegar was white or apple, so I used apple; probably doesn't make a difference.  Used bagged slaw mix.  Also didn't feel like cutting onion, so I used dried flakes.  I also don't like it too sweet, so I cut sugar in half and doubled the vinegar.  I didn't even let it sit and was eating it out of bowl; can't wait to eat it tomorrow!

This coleslaw recipe is just what I needed!  I only like a certain type of coleslaw and I had been trying lots of different recipes, but wasn't getting it quite right.  This hits the spot.  I tasted it to check the vinegar/sugar ratio before chilling it and it almost didn't make it to the fridge!  Thanks for a great recipe.    PS- I was out of lemon juice, so I subbed 2 packets of crystallized lemon (true lemon) and two extra tablespoons of milk-- works great!

Very tasty slaw.  The sugar gave it a nice sweet taste.  I added some chipotle sauce, which gave it a little spice, too.

I enjoyed this one....I did use a bag of cole slaw mix and also added another bag of shredded red cabbage.....I thought the dressing was great....hubby would have preferred a more creamy-mayo tasting dressing....I guess I could have doubled the dressing....I liked it because it was kinda light.....served with Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from this site.....a great combo!  Thanks!

I just made this recipe to go with the pulled pork BBQ I'm making tomorrow and it IS terrific!  My daughter is not a fan of anything too sweet so I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup, added a splash more vinegar and used red onion instead of sweet.  It's going to be a challenge NOT to dig into this tonight and save it for tomorrow!

UPDATE 7/20/10:  I've made this four times since May and EVERYONE loves it.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

To me, a great recipe gives me a good base to start from.  To the folks that gave 4 stars because they had to "tweak" it, I say "Nyah!"  We all customize to suit our family's tastes.  This slaw tasted JUST like my mother's.  I added celery salt, but pretty much just left it alone.  Great slaw!

I LOVED it!  It is exactly what I've been looking for since my favorite cole slaw is KFC's...but with my husband being laid off, I felt it was a needless purchase.  This is so much like theirs.  Even my husband, who isn't crazy about cole slaw, tried it and ate a large portion and told me I could make it anytime and he would help me eat it.    I followed the suggestions and made it a day ahead.  The next morning I stirred it and tried a bite and couldn't wait to get home and have some more.      I can't tell you the number of recipes I've tried for cole slaw and never make them again.  I'll never try another one again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a tangy slaw. I made this today so it only sat a few hours, but as my husband said while eating, "This is going to be really good tomorrow". I left out the salt, but I think it needed it after all so I added abut 1/2 tsp in.  UPDATE: This was excellent the second day, so much so that I upped the star rating I had originally given it as the flavors blended. It was so much like restaurant type cole slaw, very tangy, very good.  Thanks. This was 3.5 stars good!

If you want more "kick" in the recipe, add 1/2 to 1 tsp. dry mustard, depending on your tastes.

This is good.  Dressing seemed to be missing something though.  Might try it again to see if I can tweek it a little.  Update:  Much better the next day.  Now 4 1/2 stars.

I didn't enjoy this at all.  Maybe I screwed something up but it didn't remind me of KFC at all- or maybe I just haven't been there for awhile but I won't be making this again.  I like creamier cole slaw- this was too runny.

Wow! Wonderful cole slaw! I used the bagged coleslaw mix (so easy) and added about a teaspoon of celery seed. This is THE BEST and my very 1st from scratch cole slaw. Received gr8 reviews from my family and the family I sent some to along with a meal I made for them. This is the recipe I will use from now on since I'm going to make my own all the time now. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful slaw.  I used reduced calorie milk and mayo and purchased a bag of the pre-made slaw mixture.  I only had apple cider vinegar and it was perfect.

I just got a new food processor that made the preparation for this go rather quickly. I'm fairly picky about slaw but this one is terrific. My family is asking me to make more. I also left out the onion but I'll probably add it next time. This one is definitely a keeper.

YUM!  My first time trying to make cole slaw and I will not go searching any farther.  I made it a little too late to let sit for 3 hours, but it was still great after sitting for just one hour.  I also just bought a bag mix of the cabbage and carrots and did not put any onions, I am sure it would taste just as yummy, if not more with onions!

Ok let me try again, it turned out great, Iâ€™m allergic pretty much to everything, so I substitute mayo for best food vegan mayo and I substitute milk for soy milk, I recommend this recipe even with substituting itâ€™s deserved 5 star.

Sweet and tangy. I used lactose free milk and it is still creamy. Next time Iâ€™ll use cashew milk and stevia to make it low carb.

Halved the recipe. Too sweet for me, but 5yo loved it! Tastes alot like our local bbq place.  Used premade slaw mix, extra carrots, but chopped fine to get the texture and flavor consistent. Would def make again.

Very good dressing.  I only added 2 T sugar instead of 1/3 c, a little stone ground mustard and some celery seed.  Also used 1/2 mayo, and 1/2 miracle whip. Turned out great!

I did not make any changes.  I marinated it overnight which melded all the flavors together nicely.  May use a bit more vinegar the next time.

Great recipe, turns out well using mayo or Miracle Whip.  Reminds me of my grandmother's recipe that she made throughout my  childhood.

This is hands-down the best cole slaw I've ever made! It was very easy to make. I wasn't sure how much cabbage to buy, so I bought 1 large head. It only took 1/2 of it to result in the required cups of cabbage called for in the recipe.

We really liked this recipe a lot.  I like the lemon juice and the vinegar combo to balance the sweetness.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, and I'm glad I did, because that was plenty and I think more would have been too much.  I also used a tsp. of onion powder instead of minced onion, but next time I make it I will try it with the minced.  Best recipe I've tried.  It's aw-some coleslaw for sure!!!

Awesome! Subtracted the milk and sugar and added dijon mustard along with both green and red cabbage. This complemented our pulled pork sandwiches.

This was really good and really easy! Lasted us a few days and each day the flavor was better! 

Used it initially on blackened fish tacos, then as a stand alone side.

This slaw was a hit with my husband and me. The only thing I changed was I added about a tablespoon of chopped parsley because I needed to use it. I let it sit about 45 minutes before serving. Maybe it would get 5 stars if I let it sit the recommended 3 hours before serving.

This is a good starter for what I have since perfected over the years to make it my own :-).
I cut the sugar down to 2-3 t. (3 teaspoons is plenty-plenty) 
And, I add to the recipe... 
1 T. dijon mustard
1 t. celery seed
2 t. horseradish
1/4 C. salted sunflower seeds
1/4 C. raisins
1/2 C. chopped fresh, raw broccoli
And, I only use 1 "Fuji" apple, chopped
Lastly, I think it tastes much better if marinated a few hours.
Sometimes I can find in the grocery store bags that already have the carrots and broccoli inside.

I liked this very much.  As another reviewer recommended, I used a little less sugar.  The thing I liked the most, is that it doesn't get too wet even sitting overnight, and the flavour gets better.

Creamy and not to sweet.  I use Mircle Whip, left out onion for family preference and eliminated the milk, worried it would be two runny, still juice up, fine amount of liquid, made it the day ahead.

I used buttermilk in place of milk and lemon juice, used miracle whip and added a little more vinegar. Topped it off with a generous sprinkling of celery seeds. Yummier.

Best Coleslaw!  I mixed the vinegar and milk then the sugar ands stirred it well, then added minced shallot and let it sit for a couple of minutes while i put the packaged cabbage into a bowl...  then i added the mayo to the liquid ingredients and mixed it up well to add to the cabbage.  Fantastic

This was so easy to make. The flavor is just right and will definitely use this recipe for my coleslaw from now on. It does taste like KFC. Did not make any changes, except made another batch, but as another reviewer said, wait till it soaks in, otherwise it will have too much liquid.

I had to try this recipe after seeing the reviews that it tasted just like KFC's.  I think it's a wonderful, creamy recipe.  The reviewers were right!  It tastes just like it!  Just be sure to refrigerate it for the prescribed time before trying it.   That's what makes it creamy.

I was looking for a creamy Cole slaw dressing to go with whole chickens smoked on the Big Green Egg in which I put lemons.  This recipe caught my eye.  As with other Cole slaw dressings, I use the pre-chopped cabbage mixture from the grocery store.  And, I generally estimate on the measurements to keep clean up to a minimum.  With that said, I closely estimated the portions (Rachel Ray style) and it tasted great.  The lemon was just what I was hoping for, a refreshing and light tasting Cole slaw.  This is recipe is a compliment to any BBQ.

The first time I made this, it was too sweet. It like slaw a bit tangy.  I put the dressing in the blender to make it creamier because it seemed lumpy with just the whisk. The second time I made it, I used some blue agave syrup instead of sugar. Worked great. Also, because we don't drink regular milk around here, I used almond milk. You can't tell the difference mixed with the other stuff.

Bought a bag of already grated cabbage and carrots.   Rinsed well and dried well.  About 7 cups.  Did not add milk.  Added a tad less sugar.  Everyone said it was the best!  Liked the fact that it had vinegar AND lemon juice in it.  It was quick and easy.

I made this slaw with a few less ingredients.  I used bagged slaw, just a few large handfuls, there are only 3 of us, so I donâ€™t like making a lot of slaw, it goes to waist. I put in some Best Food mayonnaise, a little Nathans mustard, capful of apple vinegar, and the juice of 1 Myer lemon, the slaw was wonderful. I have never put lemon in my slaw, but I do NOW. We ate every bit of it at dinner. I will try Co0kingnut recipe at a later date, I just won't add the sugar (I can't have sugar).

This is very similar to my own recipe.  I always add 1 teaspoon each of granulated garlic and onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed to the dressing.

Very easy to make.  I used Miracle Whip, just because that's what I had.  It may look like it needs more mayo at first, but it will get saucier as it sits in the fridge.  Use less sugar if desired.

This coleslaw went over very well at a party. No leftovers! The only modification I  made was I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup because I don't like coleslaw too sweet.

Super easy. First time making coleslaw.  I used the slaw out of the bag. I recommend making it fresh rather than making it ahead and refrigerating.  When I made it ahead I found it to be mushy and soggy.

Great coleslaw! Made sauce ahead in a jar and mixed in with the cabbage in the morning, before  our evening meal to blend. Made along with Chef John`s Pulled Pork recipe, Chantal`s cheesecake morning before and strawberry sauce from this site.  Guests ate it all and asked for recipes!  Great day or two ahead of time recipes to free you up day of a party!

NICE!!  I've always loved coleslaw but High Fructose Corn Syrup is always the 2nd ingredient :( 
Now however with this epic recipe I can make it at home with more wholesome ingredients and the flavor is wonderful!

This recipe is fast and easy to make, and tastes very close to kfc slaw.  I did substitute apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar, and I added about 2 teaspoons of celery seed.  I will definitely make this again!

Good recipe, but WAY too much sugar. I use a third of what the recipe calls for and I think that's pushing it. I also use buttermilk instead of regular milk and I like the tang it adds.

I was looking for a coleslaw for my husband . He loves the coleslaw from Kentucky Fried Chicken.When I read that this was close and the reviews were very good ,I decided to try it. So very glad I did. Now its our favorite. Havent been back to Kentucky Fried Chicken since.This coleslaw is simply delicious. Didnt change a thing  Would highly recommend this coleslaw. Taste great if you refrigerate for 24 hours  But so good you can eat after a couple of hours.

I didn't change a thing except I used 2 bags of tri-color coleslaw mix instead of chopping my own cabbage and carrots.  It was delicious!  My family of 3 ate almost the whole thing in one meal!

I accidentally put too much vinegar, but after adding a pinch more sugar and a tsp more mayo, it was super yummy.  I also did half and half, mayo and miracle whip.  We will definitely be making this again!

I coarsely chopped the veggies and decreased the sugar.  I think the mix of ingredients is good and I just adjusted to taste.  We like a tangier deli style cole slaw.   If you use fresh veggies, it will last a few days.  If you're not going to use it quickly, the packaged cole slaw gets bitter fast.  Note the number of servings.

I greatly reduced the amount of this that I made, needing only a small amount for 3 fish tacos.  I used cabbage I had that was leftover from making cabbage soup.  I purely guessed at the quantities for the dressing, nevertheless, it turned out to be very good.

I really like this recipe- it's easy and fresh, and reminds me of when I was little. Depending on what you serve it with, a but of fresh cilantro is a Nice addition.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it is by far the best one I have ever tried. It is VERY similar to KFC's Cole slaw which is a favorite in our house. Hats off to the cook and thanks for sharing??

I made this for my boyfriend last month and this weekend when we planned for a bbq, he requested me to remake the slaw!it was that good! I skipped the onions and added more vinegar and lemon juice to increase the acidic content a bit..after cooling it in the fridge it was superb! I like how this recipe does not consist of buttermilk..simple and yummy!

Delicious coleslaw! I finely minced and added one fresh jalapeÃ±o and cut the sugar back to about 1/4 cup. Besides those two changes I followed the recipe. It definitely had more flavor after sitting overnight.  I look forward to making this again.

This is the way I've always fixed cole slaw, but add a little minced garlic.  My one, and only, complaint with this site, is that you don't tell how much is a serving!!!! My husband is diabetic, and we count carbs.  Without knowing what amount (1c,1/2c,1/4c..etc.), per servings, is making the count pure guess work!!

Good overall. I agree with some of the reviews to reduce the sugar somewhat because it is a little sweet. Otherwise it's simple and people enjoyed it.

Very good basic recipe. Due to personal preference, I went a little light on the mayo and sugar, and a little heavier on the vinegar (used white vinegar). Did not have lemon juice so left it out. Added a few shakes of dried minced onion since I was too lazy to cut up fresh and a tablespoon or so of chia seeds for extra crunch (I think my grandmother used to use celery seeds...) Serving it with BBQ pork sandwiches tonight.

Just finished making this ahead for a weekend with friends.  All my friends are huge foodies and I didn't hesitate to select this as a side to a slow-cooker pulled-pork. 
A few calorie saving changes...used Splenda in place of sugar, coconut/almond milk in place of dairy milk, and low fat mayo.
Did these changes the first time and nobody noticed.  My husband, who loves Coles slaw, said this was by far the best.

My family loved this cole slaw! The only change that I made was the addition of cilantro. Slaw was great without it, however I am a cilantro junkie.

I love cole slaw. Always wished I had a good recipe to make. This is it! I also love KFC's slaw. Though they chop theirs finer, this is right on the mark. I got shredded cabbage and carrots from Trader Joe's. So all I had to do was add the onions and other ingredients. Quick. Easy!

This does remind me of the slaw at KFC. I made it for a cookout our family had and everyone loved it! I did as another reviewer had stated and used the bag slaw mix, keeping the sauce recipe pretty much the same with maybe just a drop more vinegar. I diced the onions and wisked them in with the sauce before pouring over the cabbage and carrots, doubling the recipe and using the whole bag of cabbage mix. Very, very good!!

made this morning with miracle whip (sweeter than regular mayo) and 1/4 cup (or 4 tablespoons) sugar rather than 1/3 cup and increased the vinegar to 2 tablespoons, and a 16 ounce bag of shredded coleslaw.  turned out tasting great.  might decrease the sugar some more, try 3 tablespoons next time.

Easy and tasty.  I think I might use a bit more lemon juice next time for a little more flavor and tang, but I loved that it wasn't a heavy overly-mayonnaised slaw.

Fantastic cole slaw recipe - I used packaged classic cole slaw mix - so only made the dressing (only first 6 ingredients) - it was perfect!  I did cut sugar slightly - and then mixed in sliced almonds and craisins - it was a huge hit!!!!!

I made this recipe for the first time today. First, I modified the ingredients since I'm just making this for my husband and I. I didn't measure the cabbage, just added enough so we can have it for a couple of days. I added peeled carrot, and 1 tsp each of vinegar, sugar, and lemon juice. I omitted the milk and onion. I didn't measure the mayonnaise, just added enough to make the consistency we like. We're having it tonight with fish,fries, and a garden salad. This is the best cole slaw ever, and I plan on making it many more times, THANKS!

This is a great cole slaw, I substituted half of the mayo for light sourcream and added a bit more lemon juice, since I also found it a bit sweet. And pay attention to the quantity, it is a BIG portion for a family of 4. I had too much dressing, but that is a question of taste of course.

My family loves a sweet cole slaw, and this recipe made them happy. I used my mini food processor, and it chopped everything up fine - like in the restaurant. I made it and let it set for an hour, while everyone was gathering, and served it. The huge bowl was gone in 5 minutes, and my husband was licking the bowl. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I found this was a touch lemony the last two times I used it, but the first time I substituted about half the lemon juice for some lime juice and it was phenomenal!  I use this recipe for catering and always receive great reviews, even from my pickiest customers!!!

I am personally not a big cole slaw fan but this recipe is pretty good.

I made this as a side for pulled pork sliders for a Super Bowl party and it was quite a hit.

The only thing I changed was the amount of the ingredients used, I made only about 3 cups of cabbage, 1 small carrot, half an onion, 1/2 cup of mayo and the rest was just whatever amount I thought it was right.

I will definitely make this again!

Best recipe for cole slaw! Just like KFC but better! I did not put the whole amount of sugar in when I was making the dressing as I wanted to make sure I did not make it too sweet. Less sugar was perfect taste for us. I shredded the cabbage in my food processor but bought carrots that were already shredded.

I loved this salad!!!  I had to use key lime juice instead of lemon juice (I was out of lemon). This made the salad so fresh and delicious. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup as I am watching sugar intake. Will make again, and again, and...

Absolutely delicious! However, I did end of halving the sugar and tripling (or more) the vinegar and lemon juice. I decided to try it with half the sugar first, and found it very sweet, so never added the rest, and I sensed a need for more tartness, hence the additional vinegar and lemon. However, I still say this is the most delicious cole slaw I've ever made, possibly ever eaten.

I made this recipe for a fish fry and everyone wanted the recipe. I doubled the dressing ingredients as we like more dressing and I didn't have lemon juice so I increased the vinegar to compensate. Definitely will make this again !!

I was concerned that this might be too sweet, but it came together perfectly.  My family and I really enjoyed it.  I made the recipe as written and added a bit of celery salt.  This is a definite keeper.

Wow. I dream of this while its marinating. I've made this 4 times now. I make it just as directed and it is amazing. Like most say, definitely make it ahead of time so it can marinate in the dressing. A+++ for this one!!

I use a 16 oz bag of shredded cabbage and grate one good sized carrot. 1/4 cp of sugar is plenty!! It makes plenty of dressing for this amount of cabbage. As it sits the dressing runs to the bottom so give it a good stir. Best if eaten within 24-48 hrs.

I think this is the perfect traditional cole slaw recipe.  The milk makes it a nice consistency - it's not too goopy or mayonnaisey - very fresh tasting.  I cut the sugar by a couple of tablespoons and added radishes rather than carrots. So glad that I found this!

Delicious! I always try to make it the day before we are having it, or the morning of, so all the flavors can come together nicely. My husband and I love the vinegar taste too, so I always add a ton more of that!

Yummy and easy dressing - thanks! Used for broccoli slaw. I don't like too much sweetness but made the recipe as is and it created a perfect balance for the slaw. Also added dried cranberries and walnuts - delish!

The flavor of this slaw is spot on. I will never make another.  It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy.  At first when I tossed it I thought there would not be enough dressing but as it sits in the fridge it absorbs and ended up perfect.  I would not change this recipe- it's perfect.

As another reviewer mentioned, I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup.  I also subbed soy milk for the milk.  I only had time to let it sit for about an hour and a half but no matter.  Everyone loved it - no leftovers!  Will try splenda next time.

Excellent.  I used purple cabbage for some of it and also added some shredded carrots (both for color).  I used onion powder instead of onion, and all vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Thanks!

Super easy, super yummy.  Shredded the cabbage on our meat slicer, threw in the other ingredients and it was ready in less than 15 minutes.  We let it sit up for only a couple of hours and it was delicious! Hubby says it's better than what he has had in most restaurants (and he is a world traveler).  I truly agree.

you'all are right, this is a very good slaw!  I've made it several times now, but I must tell'ya, I'm in China and I used rice wine vinegar and Chinese cabbage, if you can find this cabbage you'll love it and the rice vinegar is a little tangier.

I followed the dressing recipe exactly but I purchased bagged cole slaw and this is just the way I like coleslaw, on the sweet side, not vinegary.  I have never cared for store bought slaw or the store bought dressings because they didn't have the taste I was looking for but this recipe did and I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Outstanding!  Like others here, I prefer less sweet and more tart...
I left the onions out too, but added a little more lemon juice to liven things up.  I'll be using this recipe again!

I adjusted the recipe for how much cabbage I had and it tasted great! I didn't follow the measurements exactly but I kept the portions similar. I've personally never made a coleslaw before so I was interested in trying it out since it's a side dish I love (most of my friends hate coleslaw so I get theirs when we're out) I saw a few reviews saying yuck to the onions, but I love onions so it wasn't a problem for me! They do have a strong flavor though so if you don't like onions try leaving them out and taste it. I'm sure it's fine without them.

This was my first time making coleslaw from scratch, it was a cinch! My MIL suggested I add some grapes (halfed) and I also threw in 1-2 tblsp of Marzetti slaw dressing in addition to the recipe.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving and it was AWESOME w/dinner - EVERYONE loved it!

Great coleslaw! I loved the dressing. Creamy and slightly sweet but not too sweet. I admit I did not chop my own cabbage and such. I bought a pre-shredded package of cabbage coleslaw mix at the store. I didn't put any onion in. But the dressing I followed to a tee and it was perfect.

Wow!  Everyone loved it. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup rather then 1/3 as I don't like too sweet a coleslaw.  Expect to make this often for potlucks and family dinners. dana

Just an awesome recipe. Like many others I added some celery seed and used bagged coleslaw. I found that the dressing was sufficient for 2 14 oz bags of coleslaw. Although I did add abput a half cup of minced onion.

It does not taste like KFC coleslaw to me at all, but it was pretty decent to put over pulled pork sandwiches.  I used a 14ounce coleslaw bag mix, did not use that much milk (probably only 1-2 tsp), added a pinch of celery salt, and placed it in the fridge for 24 hours.  It was a bit runny for my taste.  But my husband, who usually despises coleslaw, put this coleslaw on every pulled pork sandwich he ate, which is a pretty big feat!

Great recipe.  Only change I made was to use Silk instead of milk and I did add a touch of celery salt.  Very easy and it uses ingredients most everyone has on had.  This will be a keeper!

I have a fancier slaw recipe and was looking for something a little simpler. This was not only easy, but delicious. It really does taste just like KFC! The only thing I changed was I ommitted the onions. I don't think my kids would have eaten it had I included them. Thanks for the recipe. Definately going to be a regular in our house!

Yum!  I have just started making cole slaw this summer because my hubby loves it and I can't stand the aftertaste in store-bought slaw.  This one is a great balance of sweet and tang.  Love it!

Made this yesterday with a couple modifications. Substituted Truvia for the sugar and half & half for the milk; otherwise stuck to the recipe. The cabbage was super fresh as was the Texas 1015 sweet onion. After sitting in the fridge over night I sampled it and can say it is as good as any I've ever had. PS: This was my first attempt at cole slaw. Highly recommend. Four stars in stead of five is because it is not quite sweet enough for my taste but likely due to guessing on the Truvia amount ( 4 T) instead of the sugar.

Excellent basic slaw recipe! It seemed a bit sweet, so I doubled the lemon juice. And I used two green onions instead of the sweet onion.

Excellent.  I added celery seed (because I think all cole slaw requires it) and tripled the carrots.  The dressing is perfect.  I used white balsamic vinegar.

AMAZING!!!  So good!!  I didn't have onions on hand the day I tried this recipe but other than that I really didn't have to change a thing, which is unusual for me.  Great recipe and my BBQ guests completely agreed!

Good traditional slaw.  Love that it's basic with nothing in there that shouldn't be.  Really good flavor without overpowering the pallet.

Fantastic! And I recommend making it TWO days ahead - it gets even better. Only real change I made it less sugar (1/4 cup instead of 1/3). Also, if you use half red cabbage it turns the dressing pink. Might be kind of fun for kids :)

I've never made cole slaw for the fear of it not turning out right, but I decided to make this one yesterday and the name fits it perfectly ... AWESOME COLE SLAW!  The only thing I changed was I used a bag of cole slaw mix and omitted the onion.  I kept everything else the same.  Glad my first try making slaw turned out as wonderful as it did.  It really does almost taste like KFC's!  Thanks for sharing this recipe. I have found a keeper.

This Cole Slaw is the best. I served it at a luncheon, and one of my friends said it was better than KFC's cole slaw. I really liked it because it had a sweetness that was not at all overpowering.

My coleslaw issues are over. I read this recipe (& reviews) Had to scale to 4 servings and with minor adjustments...This ROCKED. Anyway, used 1/2 the sugar (used splenda) 1/2 the lemon juice + a bit more vineger. I used minced dried onion as fresh seemed silly for my small amount (but would use for larger scale). My only addition was celery seed. Didn't have fresh carrots to grate although I prefer it. I threw this together at 1pm (on the fly) & 4 hrs later it was better then KFC slaw. I'm looking for a reason to make a larger batch. So simple, yet sooooo good! I'm sure it's even better prepared a day in advance.

Great slaw!   I added a teaspoon of celery seed.   The whole family enjoyed it.  I had a chance to sample KFC's slaw the next day.   This recipe was even better than the Colonel's!

This was OK.  It definately needs some tweaking.  I think next time I'll add more seasoning (salt, celery seed, pepper). We also found the dressing to not be quite enough.  It was wet, but watery, not creamy. Good start for a recipe though.

Thank you for this recipe! I have been looking for a great cole slaw recipe that resembles KFC and this is it. I trimmed down the servings b/c I'm the only one in my home who likes cole slaw and I ran out b/c my kids ate more that I did! This slaw is great on a hot dog and alone. The name of this recipe is accurate b/c it is AWESOME!!

This cole slaw is WONDERFUL!!  The only thing I added was finely chopped green pepper.  It is especially great on pork barbecue sandwiches!  I made it for a friend who loves cole slaw and he said it was the best ever!!!

Loved this Cole Slaw recipe. This classic summer side dish became a regular paring with many of my barbecue meals and perfect for picnics and backyard gatherings. Because I made this so many times this summer I played with the basic recipe to twist things up a bit. Combing red and white cabbage gave more depth of the color and great for a 4th of July theme. I also added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and it tasted like a brand new recipe and very complimentary to all the other ingredients. This super healthy dish will be a regular part of my summer meals!

This is great coleslaw!  I am a true coleslaw lover & this is one of the best recipes I have found that aren't completely over the top in sodium.  I make it regularly everyone loves it!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it turned out great! Everyone loved it. Good and crispy. Way better than the stuff you get from the grocery store that is pre-made.

I did double the vinegar and only used 1 tablespoon of sugar since we like our slaw not too sweet.  This was very good and I'll continue to use this recipe.  Highly recommended!  Thanks.

For diabetics, you can change the white sugar to Splenda - I only used 1/4 cup and it becomes a delicious "no sugar" recipe

I can't say if this tastes like KFC cole slaw or not because I've never had it but I can say this is delicious... the best I've ever had!
