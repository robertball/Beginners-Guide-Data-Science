Great smoothie! I used fat free vanilla yogurt and because it was a little thick added a little extra skim milk. I also added a little strawberry jam in addition to the strawberries to sweeten it up a bit and increase the strawberry flavor.

As is - the recipe is very thick and the flavor is primarily bananna and yogurt. My friend and I then increased the strawberries, added 1/4c frozen OJ concentrate, added a splash of vanilla, a tsp of sugar and more milk to thin it out a little. Now - much better (but technically, a different recipe altogether).  My friend (and boyfriend) still wasn't fond of the thick texture but I enjoyed it with the changes made.

Because I used both frozen bananas and frozen strawberries (and a lot more strawberries than called for) this was so thick my Vita-Mix wouldn't even cut through it, which necessitated my having to add a lot more milk to make it run. The end result was a pleasant surprise!  This was fresh and fruity tasting, and not as bogged down by the slightly sour tang of yogurt as some smoothies can be.  I added a little honey to sweeten it up and this time Hubs actually commented on how "really good" this was without my prompting him.  (Hmmm, I have to remember that - frozen fruit and LOTS of it, more milk and less yogurt)  What is particularly nice about this smoothie is that there are no "exotic" ingredients you are not likely to have on hand.  Smoothies,at least for me anyway,  are something made on the spur of the moment and bananas and strawberries are simple, basic ingredients you can always have available in your freezer.

I put in one banana, half a container of blueberry yogurt, 1/2 tsp Vanilla, sprinkle of cinnamin, between 1/2 - 1 cup of 1% milk, and 4 ice cubes. Blended for one glass. Excellent texture, a refreshing morning treat :)

This was really good.  I used strawberry-banana yogurt.  It was really thick, next time I will use half the yogurt and maybe add some ice.

I used both a frozen banana and frozen strawberries. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The consistancy was just right and for me, this was perfectly sweet BUT I will say that my banana was plenty ripe. This was wonderful--this really made one portion........for me!

I have made this with oranges and fresh pineapple, peaches and bananas, very ripe pears and strawberries, whatever I have on hand. If I don't have milk , I use orange juice.  I also add honey if I need to sweeten it up a bit. It is a staple at our house.

Nice change for a quick breakfast.  I used a frozen banana, a few more strawberries, and as suggested by other reviewers, cut back a little on the yogurt and added a tad more milk (skim milk, in my case).  Strawberries and bananas always complement each other, and the yogurt provides just enough tang to yield a bright and fresh smoothie.

I actually really liked this! I did use Blueberries instead of strawberries, simply because I didn't have the strawberries, but I thought it turned out really good! I've had this a few times now... I love it!

I love this recipe.  I changed it up some since I make it and carry it to work with me.  I freeze peeled and halved bananas when they have ripened well in freezer bags.  I use one frozen banana, frozen strawberries and light chocolate soy milk with protein powder.  By the time I get to work it is not too thick and is perfect on the go.

My husband makes this almost every day.  It is perfect for that last banana that is way overripe and no one will eat!  Sometimes he adds blueberries, flavored yogurt or pineapple juice to mix it up!

This breakfast smoothie is great how it is. The only thing i did differently is use 1/2 cup strawberries instead of what the recipe called for and I added 1 tsp sugar for a little bit of a sweet taste to the smoothie

I used frozen organic mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries) since I didn't have plain old strawberries.  I also threw in a few ice cubes.  The yogurt I used was organic and french vanilla-flavored.  It came out thick and I hate seeds, but I'd probably try it again.  I'd just tweak it a little so that it's not as thick.

this was pretty good.  I liked the basic, easy to find ingredients it called for.  To give it a little chill I blended about 6 ice cubes with it and a little honey to sweeten it up just a tad.

This shake is very similar to one I make when fresh strawberries are in season.  I also add my usual additions, ground flaxseed and soy protein powder.

I've renamed this Dessert in a Glass. I used frozen strawberries, a frozen banana, and a 6-oz. carton of non-fat vanilla yogurt (not the frozen kind) along with the non-fat milk and got a great soft ice cream-like consistency. Makes a delicious, light dessert for after dinner. Just another way a great basic recipe like this can be altered.

Pretty good.  I did use a few more frozen strawberries than what was called for.  I also used vanilla fat-free yogurt.  Skim milk.  Tasty enough.

I had to add sugar.  Was a little bitter w/o. it.  NExt time I may use a differnt yogurt rather than plain, non-fat yogurt

Perfect recipe for our new VitaMix blender. The taste and consistency was very good. I was like a thin milkshake. We will make this one again.

I thought this recipe tasted a lot like yogurt and banana until I added  more strawberries, 1/2 cup more milk, 2 tbsp sugar, and 2 tsp vanilla. Thank you to the person above for suggesting these extra items.

I used a greek style plain yogurt, and just went with the recipe and I really didn't like it. Needed some honey and ice cubes. My daughter didn't even like it.

You can substitute the 1/4 cup of strawberries for blueberries for a different flavor and add a teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to add some sweetness.

I would double the strawberries. I used frozen strawberries and added frozen mango and some lemon juice.

This turned out great! I added a touch of kale to make it  a bit more healthier. And some lemon for zing!

This was definetly a favorite, me and my family enjoyed it. The only thing  I would recomend is to add more strawberries, about half of a cup or a whole cup of strawberries, and add a little bit more milk to have it more creamy, that's all.

I added vanilla extract and honey to this. I think it would be significantly better with vanilla flavored yogurt and maybe a spoonful of peanutbutter.

Loved it! I used Silk instead of non-fat milk and it still tastes delicious! I'm also one to not have many ingredients for stuff and have to go out and buy it. But this was simple to make and I has everything in the fridge and garden.

Made as is...not so good.  Replace the milk with OJ and you could be at Jamba Juice.  I also throw in some raspberries and even some frozen pineapple.  Yum

I swapped the milk for strawberry/kiwi Juicy Juice to give it more flavor and sweetness.  The milk just wasn't going to cut it.
