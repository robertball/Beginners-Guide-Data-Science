Wow. Can't even tell it's gluten-free! I also used Bob's Red Mill GF All Purpose Flour instead of the millet and rice flour. Also, I used 1 tsp xanthan gum & 2 tsp baking powder (instead of 1 TBSP/3 tsp of baking powder). Definitely will use again.

Very good basic recipe. I served it with thick beef stew and it was great. Could easily be adapted to add cheese, corn, or buttermilk if you plan on serving alone. I also used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Flour instead of millet and rice flour. I love that the cornbread came out nice and fluffly, but still holds its shape. Gluten free breads and cornbread tend to fall apart, but not this one. I plan on making again and adding applesauce and cinnamon for more of a breakfast type bread. Thanks! Great recipe!

This is a very dry cornbread, but once you get used to the fact that gluten free is going to be different from a wheat flour product, it's fine!  I tried to make my own millet flour.  It didn't work well, so I used the millet anyway!  I found that I had rice bran instead of rice flour, but it worked well for this!  I made this thinner than the recipe by putting it into a 9x13 pan, and it was done in 20 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this recipe a while back when I thought that I was going to have to go gluten free.  It turns out that I didn't need to, but regardless, this is now my go-to cornbread recipe!  I love this cornbread!!!  The only thing I didn't like was that it often turned out a little too dry and crumbly, but I finally figured out how to fix that thanks to another reviewer - add xanthan gum.  I had never used it before and was a little hesitant to add too much. I used 2 1/2 t. baking powder and about 3/4 t. of xanthan gum (which I stirred into the dry ingredients) and voila!  Problem solved!  It was fluffy but moist and stayed together.  Perfect!!  Thank you for the recipe and the great suggestions!

My family and I loved this cornbread.  I followed the suggestions of others and used the xanthan gum.  Since I wanted a little more cornmeal flavor, I used 1-3/4 cups cornmeal and 1-3/4 cup gluten free all purpose flour. It was moist, not crumbly, and had a very good flavor.  Can't stop munching on it!  I have missed bread since going gluten free and this really satisfies me!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I made it as described and was amazed how truly bread-like it was.  I will definitely make again.  Next time, I may try adding more sweetener, likely honey or agave nectar, to up the sweetness a bit as my family tends to like it a bit sweeter.  Really easy.

Loved it !  I'm not one to change up and recipe, then review it, but I didn't have Millet Flour so I just used rice flour instead. I ignored the comments on it being dry because cornbread is always dry.  Unless you toast it and butter it, it's dry - regular or gluten free.  This was a keeper.  My non-GF people loved it too, without mention of the fact that it was GF (shhh).

Amazing cornbread!  As suggested I substituted 1 tsp Xanthum Gum and  2 tsp baking powder instead of 1 Tbls baking powder, and I used 2 cups of the Bob's RM GF all purpose flour and no millet flour.  I also added 1/2 c applesauce.  I baked it for 10 extra minutes.  This was fluffier than regular cornbread.

This recipe is delicious.  After reading the reviews, I used 2 cups of Bob’s Red Mill all-purpose gluten-free flour.  I did not have millet or rice flour in the house.  I used 1 tsp xanthan gum and 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 1 tablespoon of baking power.  I used 1/3 cup of sugar.  I like my cornbread a little sweeter.  I cooked it in my 10-inch cast iron skillet.  I have a relative who is gluten sensitive.  I have been experimenting with gluten free recipes.  This one is a keeper.

Came out dry and not fluffy.  I am very picky about cornbread and even non-GF versions can be dry and not fluffy.  So, if this is the fluffiest I can get out of GF then I'd rather not have it.  Sorry, I was really hopeful but it is just a predictable outcome with GF breads.

This fluffy GF cornbread tastes just as delicious as a gluten recipe and no one will know the difference. I used Bob's Red Mill GF all purpose flour just like others suggested and it turned out great!

The flavor of the corn bread is good, however, it is WAYYYY too heavy!!  I was excited to find a GF recipe for cornbread, but will have to keep looking for the right one!

Love, Love, Love it! I have tried so many different gluten free cornbread recipe's and this is the best one yet! I even froze the left-overs in foil individually and pulled one out the other day. I ate it myself while cooking, without even warming it up. I'm not even the one on the gluten-free diet but I enjoyed it so much! Thank yoU!

The taste was good but it was dry and crumbly. I think increasing the eggs could make it great. Has anyone tried adding more eggs or oil?

Just used this recipe to make 6 corn muffins for use with making "Thanksgiving sandwiches" and WOW! Very simple and great result--even when the recipe is cut in half! Future batches I'll reduce the sugar to 2 tablespoons, add fresh thyme and a few cranberries to each muffin for a savory side. Thanks AR!

I agree with the reviewer that said you just have to expect that gluten free is going to be different than the gluten counterparts, and that is true here, too. That being said, I do think this recipe is good for gluten free.  The one thing I think I will do next time is double the amount of sugar, if not triple it. I like sweeter cornbread (love the little box mixes, but my tummy doesn't). As it was, I put a few extra tablespoons of sugar in, and I'm glad I did. If I hadn't, I don't think I would have liked it.

Well.....I don't like giving negative reviews, but I won't be making this again. It was extremely dry and crumbly.  It also made a lot!  I've made Jiffy cornbread many times (before gf) and that tiny box makes a square pan, so as I was mixing up this recipe I knew it was way more than that.  I used a 9x13 pan and it filled it to at least a 2" depth. Perhaps the larger pan contributed to the dryness, but I was afraid that much batter was going to run right over my square pan. It tasted okay (not great).  Fortunately, I have a cornbread salad recipe that calls for crumbled cornbread, and the leftovers (which was most of it) worked well for that, so it wasn't wasted!
It obviously worked for most of the other reviewers, so it's worth a try if you're looking for gf cornbread.

I did what everyone else did and used the Xanthum Gum, switched out the baking powder and because I like it sweet - I used 1/3 cup of sugar. I cooked them as muffins - both micro and mid size. On the mid-sized muffins I added some new but cheap/ small dried out dates and they cooked beautifully.
I got those dates at Cost'n'go and the brand name was Comp+ss.  I don't recommend those dates other than this type of use.

I agree with anel. I followed the directions exactly with the exception of using honey instead of sugar, and it came out very dry.

Did not like it at all.  Tasted too "floury".  Not  sweet enough.  Maybe I ground the corn meal too  much.

Taste was okay, not great, could taste the baking powder, and was too dry. I should note that I used Rob Mill's GF all purpose flour instead of the rice and millet flours  I enjoy experimenting with GF baked goods, but haven't had good success using premade GF flours. It does seem better to mix your own. Thank you!

I found it to be quite delicious. I made it to go along with some chili I had made, but instead we just had the bread smothered in butter and honey for dinner. Will definitely be making this again.

tried it this afternoon,I doubled the baking powder, used split peas powder/flour instead of millet flour, honey instead of sugar and soya milk instead of water.  Took 45 mins, it's heavy but taste delicious, intend to improvise next time.

This is an awesome recipe. I followed the advice to use GF all-purpose flour instead of rice flour and millet flour and added 1 teas xantham gum as someone suggested. I also used coarsely-ground cornmeal which we'd gotten from a grist mill and it was terrific. I poured this as a topping on a casserole and it was really good.
