Before you even read this review, please know that I'm one of THOSE people. I completely ignored the dairy-free ingredients because I didn't have them and I wanted to use up some flavored coffee creamer I had. I used real butter and International Delight Almond Joy coffee creamer. Because the creamer is so sweet, I did not sprinkle sugar on top of the scones before baking. I also made them into squares and cut 9 of them. They turned out pretty sweet, but perfect for an evening dessert with a cup of coffee. I would make these again, perhaps with a different flavor creamer even and cut them smaller next time.

I have made this twice now. Everyone loves it!  I made a couple of additions and 1 substitution.  On step 1. I substituted the hazelnut creamer for 2/3 C Nutella. Mixed that together with my hands. At this point the batter is very dry. I added 1 egg and 1/2 C buttermilk. Mix together and pour it into the parchment paper and form a circle.
