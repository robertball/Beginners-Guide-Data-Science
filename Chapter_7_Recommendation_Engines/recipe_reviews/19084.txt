I made this cake years ago to add life to a school project. My mom had a box of instant potato mash which we were never going to use so i figured why not. The cake came out moist and smooth. It was not very chocolatey rich but it still made a great tasting cake. Everyone was surprised to learn that it did include potatos and needless to say I got an A* on the project for it made a very interesting presentation.

I put 1/2 c. walnuts in this cake and used cloves instead of allspice.  This cake is ok but really a good old chocolate cake is enough without the bother of mashed potatoes. Plus the mashed potatoes I used I could have used for supper but had to more.
