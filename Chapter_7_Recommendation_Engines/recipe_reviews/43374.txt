Too much meat for one pita, so I just used the Canadian bacon. I scrambled the eggs the way I normally do (added a little garlic and onion powders) put that in the pita along with the Canadian bacon and some cheese.

This is great for brunch!  It was a big success here since no one likes omlets or traditional breakfasts anymore.  I fried 1/2 pound of breakfast sausage and ground it in the blender after it was cooked. Then I stirred in 4 egg whites and added 1/2 chopped green pepper and 1 chopped romano tomato and cooked until the eggs were done then sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese and stuffed into pita pockets.  Blending it up makes it easier to eat since pitas are fairly fragile.  I served with hash browns.

These were easy to prepare and super easy to grab and go. I prepped enough filling for a couple of days so all I had to do was warm up some and stuff it in the pita. I added a wedge of Laughing Cow Cheese and some fresh chives to mine. I also substitued turkey sausage or sliced deli turkey to make it a little leaner. I will keep this one on my list.

I omitted the Canadian bacon as I didn't have any, and microwaved the regular bacon to speed up the process. Also, I put a slice of American cheese in the pita pocket before I spooned in the scrambled egg. This was a really easy and filling breakfast. Thanks, Steve!

These were great.  We use veggies in the eggs, green pepper, onions and add cheese and one meat to the pitas.  Very Very good thanks for the post.

My husband really liked this! Of course, he likes anything with bacon. But who doesn't? I think next time I would add some potatoes but that's just a personal preference.

I used ground sage sausage and turkey bacon as the meat in the recipe.  I also wanted more flavor in the eggs so I used the cheesy herb egg recipe.  I tried a few different breakfast pita recipes from this site and I liked this one the best with the extra  herb flavor added to the eggs.  Next time I might add some salsa.

These were great. I didn't use any Candian bacon (didn't have any) & added some cooked green pepper & some onion. I like that you can play around with the fillings. Thanks.

I was looking for something different for my Husband's birthday breakfast and this went down a treat - he loved it! 
I found it too greasy so only 4 stars.

Very good. I have made these many times using 2 slices of bacon, 1 sausage and 1 slice of Canadian bacon, add some shredded cheese and then zap in the microwave.  All the meat just over powered the eggs for my taste.

This is fast and delicious. I add some chopped up ham or even turkey strips. Instead of a pita I use a soft taco and top off the egg with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. My girlfriend and I love this recipe!
