I didn't find a tablespoon of butter to be nearly enough for our liking. I ended up adding 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup). Recipe says it serves 6 but this was just about the right amount for hubby and I so keep that in mind. These were good but who doesn't love a classic wing? I recommend making as is to start off and only add more butter to the sauce if you see fit. I'm already looking forward to making these again!

My family loved it! I did use more butter, 4 tablespoons. I also made two batches and substituted country sweet for tangy wings, and it worked perfectly.

My wings turned out delicious!  The flour dredge was easy and turned out crispy!  However, my next batch I will use a different hot sauce. The one I used was too vinegary! Other than that I ate them all!

This really is easy and tasty. I didn't have wings, so I used 4 chicken legs for two of us, and it was still quite good. It was way more flour than I needed for 4 legs, but I've put the rest in the freezer for next time. I used a wok to cook in and didn't measure how much canola oil I used - probably 3 cups, maybe 4. Since the legs were obviously bigger than wings, I cooked them for 10-12 minutes, turning them a couple times. The chicken was juicy and flavorful with a nice crunchy coat. The Texas Pete wing sauce with butter (which I heated in the microwave) gave a nice kick but not enough to hurt. Good recipe!
