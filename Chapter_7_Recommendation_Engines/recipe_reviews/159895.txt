This soup was outstanding, although I did make a few modifications. I used diced/cooked butternut squash, eliminated the mushrooms and instead vermicelli I used corn and barley. To make a nice broth I used 4 cups of vegetable broth and I also used about 6 diced green onions and a big bunch of chopped cilantro and two chile peppers for a little extra heat. I only added the shrimp after the soup had simmered because it was already cooked and I didn't want it to get rubbery. It was just the Thai soup recipe I'd been looking for.

Really, very good, spicy, savory, 'bout as good as I've had in the Thai restaurants. The coriander, tumeric and cumin really "make" it!  Only thing is, I felt like it needed more liquid to be a true soup, so I added about 2  cups of broth/water mixture before the simmer stage. Did I miss where it said put in extra liquid? My substitutions:  Canned tomatoes (happened to be the kind with green chiles) and  a pickled jalepeno for the fresh... regular onion for the green onion (only 'cos I didn't have any!) Cappellini thin spagetti for the one called for. Thanks, Zoe!

This recipe is overcomplicated. Why sauté (basically) the same ingredients twice in two different pans? Why blanche/peel the tomatoes? Just sauté the stuff, add the spices, then add the tomatoes etc. Also, why cook the carrots in a separate pot? the only reason you'd need to do this is if you don't have a lot of time... otherwise it's better to let it all cook together, gives it more depth. I agree with everyone`s criticism that the pasta:liquid ratio is way too high... next time I`ll be adding half the amount, `cuz even with a can of broth and some extra water, it was still more like a runny pasta meal. Use fresh or frozen peas; canned vegetables are less nutritional/tasty. It`s too bad all the flavor got cooked out of the shrimp... add them at the very end, just after the pasta is cooked, and shut off the burner. Let it sit and cook in the hot liquid for a couple minutes until they turn pink, then serve. Furthermore, I`d also suggest upping the amount of garlic by at least 2x. Since I don`t have turmeric lying around (it`s mostly for color anyway, like paprika), I used straight up curry powder (about 2 tbsp) with the cumin/coriander. And instead of Jalapeno (a Mexican ingredient), I used sriracha sauce ($2.50 in the ethnic foods section... it`s like a spicy Thai version of ketchup). I also added a couple teaspoons of sugar, which was desperately missing. If you thought this recipe was good, check out the 'Coconut Curry Tofu' recipe from user KATHYCOLLINS!

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  It sounded great, but fell short of its promise.  It is really a shrimp vegetable/pasta soup.    I was hoping for a soup with true coconut milk and shrimp flavor, both of which are completely overwhelmed by other ingredients -- particularly the tomatoes .  I couldn't taste the coconut milk at all.  However, it has inspired me to try to develop a soup that truly tastes like coconut milk shrimp. soup

Great flavor!  I stuck to the recipe except for leaving out one of the carrots and adding 1 chopped celery stalk when cooking the mushrooms. I agree with the previous reviewer that there wasn't enough liquid to call this a soup; the pasta just soaks it all up. I added 4 cups of veggie stock to make more of a broth. This soup is attractive and a nice way to switch up my usual rotation of meals. Thanks!

I agree totally with some of the others.  Where was the liquid to call it a "soup"? First of all, Ashlou took the words right out of my mouth.  This recipe was WAY too complicated!  Too many dishes!  Why are we cooking everything in a separate pan, and why burn the spices??  Just cook everything (EXCEPT the pasta) in the same pan, add the shrimp last!  There wasn't enough liquid to cook the pasta in the pan, so I did cook the pasta separately, then spooned the "sauce" with shrimp over the pasta.  I didn't taste the coconut at all.  The cumin, turmeric and coriander flavors were nice together, but I felt that it needed more salt.  I don't usually cook with salt, but I did this time and something was definitely lacking.

Delicious! This tastes like something from a Thai restaurant. It is very rich, and was still rich with an added cup of water. I would highly recommend.

Really good soup.  I didn't add the noodles, and put corn instead, and it was very tasty!

This soup tastes great but it is complicated to make.  Slow and uses half the pans in my kitchen. I don't think the mushrooms are really quite appropriate and I had a bit too much lime in mine, but the flavor is excellent and it's fun to have a good recipe for shrimp soup.

Use less oil. Add broth. 
Used as a gravy for a pasta instead because it was too thick and oily to eat as is.  The flavor was good though.

It  was tasty  and filling. Very easy to make.  I love the spices.  I am recently found to be lactose intolerant and this is the first creamy soup that taste great to me and has no milk products in it.

Very good soup although I altered the cooking method to cut out the two saute stages.
