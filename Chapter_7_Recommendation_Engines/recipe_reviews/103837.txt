I think this was excellent after tweaking a bit. I used half splenda & half dark brown sugar, which gives a richer flavor.  I then used 1/2 the dark karo & half sugar free maple syrup to reduce the sugar further. I did the same thing but did another variation adding 2 squares of unsweetened baking chocolate and instead of pecans, I used unsalted macadamia nuts. Delicious!

My husband loves pie and pecan pie is his favorite. He tried it warm and didn't like it. Then he tried it cold and he loves it. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I substituted Sugar Free Maple Syrup for the Light corn syrup to make it Sugar Free -- It was fantastic.  Made it for a Potluck at work and no one could tell it was Sugar Free

I made this for Christmas last year - it tasted great.  People did NOT know I used Splenda Brown Sugar in this pie.  Nothing was lacking!

I have been searching for a recipe that will be as close as I can get to the "real deal" pecan pie we have in Texas. Since my friend is diabetic and I know substitutions must be made, this is the one that comes the closest. The only change I made was to change the light corn syrup to a sugar free pancake syrup. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly. No one knew it was made with Splenda and I didn't tell them. Everybody raved about the pecan pie and I just said thank you! I'll make another one for Christmas and get the same raves I'm sure.

This is the best pecan pie I've ever had, sugar free or otherwise! And very easy to make. I highly recommend it.

I used splenda brown sugar and sugar free pancake syrup. It turned out ok but it is a good recipe. I am going to try another brand of sugar free syrup and see if it turns out better. Otherwise, I will have to get the light corn syrup.  I will make it again:)

Loved it. Always loved pecan pie but very very sweet. This recipe tones down the sweetness just enough. Will definitely make it again!!

I used brown sugar splenda, and Mrs. buttersworth sugar free pancake syrup in place of white syrup. It turned out FANTASTIC! Not quite as sicky sweet as a real pecan pie...but a real hit with everyone in the family! THANK YOU for this recipe!

I use a basic Pecan Pie recipe...but substitute the syrup with Brown Rice Syrup and the sugar with Splenda granular.  Judy Duff

I just made this delicious pie for our son, who was recently diagnosed with diabetus.  I used Brown Sugar Karo, instead of the light Karo, as it had fewer grams of sugar.  It was perfect, and our son loved it. May be better than my longtime pecan pie recipe.

My family prefers this recipe over the traditional Southern Pecan Pie.
