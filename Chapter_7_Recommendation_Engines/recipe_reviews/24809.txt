I really like this recipe.  It is very easy and looks lovely.  I would recommend using a 6 oz package of the cranberries....and toss with only 1/2 bottle of the wonderful Raspberry Walnut dressing.  I highly recommend.

This was a good base recipe to help me create a yummy salad I LOVED. The changes I made:  I added red onion and feta cheese and did not use any avocado.  For people looking for the raspberry walnut salad dressing look for the "Ken's" brand.

Great recipe!  I was unable to find raspberry walnut vinegrette, so I used non-fat raspberry-balsamic vinegrette...excellent!

This is a wonderful, fresh salad!  I served it at a dinner party and it was a hit!  I'm a big fan of fruit in green salads and the dried cranberries were perfect.

I served this at Easter and it was a hit.  I only used 4-6 oz of cranberries and 1/2 of the bottle of dressing.  I couldn't find the exact dressing so I used Raspberry vinaigrette and chopped my own walnuts.  My family and friends loved it

This salad is great!  While I was preparing it, my husband teased me about what a "girl " salad I was making (we're newly married).  But he LOVED it.  The only thing I will change for the future is a little less cranberries & vinaigrette (just personal taste).

Wonderful salad. I don't like tomatoes so I changed it up with strawberries instead. I liked all the different textures in this salad. I used a home made raspberry dressing. Thanks for the great recipe, this salad is so delish!

Salad is always good. I often make one just like this. Any fruit vinegrette works great. I add some blue cheese and ham to make a wonderful salad. So yummy, you will want to eat it often with so many variations for a green salad.

This is a wonderful basic salad.  Open the fridge and add whatever you have on hand......strawberries and blueberries are great colorful additions, spinach leaves, walnuts.....pretty much anything goes.

This was a good salad but nothing that I would make again or crave. I thought it was too sweet. Maybe it was the raspberry walnut dressing I used. Newmans.

You can also add fresh raspberries or strawberries and/or some blue cheese crumbles if you like blue cheese for a tangy taste, and you can also use a balsamic vinaigrette dressing as a substitute for the raspberry dressing

This is the second time I made this salad. With a store salad dressing this recipe gets only 3 stars, but if you make your own raspberry dressing it is really nice. I omitted the tomatoes because I'm not big fan of it and added some walnuts.

Love, Love, Love this salad!  It is a great combination of ingredients and is not hard to make.  I made my own raspberry vinaigrette and didn't worry about any nuts other than the sunflower seeds. It was perfect!  Not good leftover, so eat it all the first day!

I made this for my mother's day party, and everyone LOVED it. It does not take long to prepare, and I only use 4 oz of dried cranberries, and easily made six servings. I also added 4 oz of honey glazed pecans, and strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries, wich really turned it into a "wonderful berry salad"! :D

Sounds wonderful. I make this type of salad frequently for lunches. Paul Newman has a wonderful fat free raspberry-walnut dressing. For a change, I add 5 large cooked shrimp cut up for more substance. Enjoy!

This salad is great!  I substituted almonds for the sunflower seeds and it still was a great salad.  I will add feta or chicken the next time.  Yummy!!!

I also added seasoned almond slivers, plain chopped walnuts, and blue cheese crumbles. It was good, but I think I could go without the sunflower seeds. Especially since I didn't realize I used salted haha. I also wasn't a huge fan of the dressing I chose, I would like to try another next time. It also didn't pair well with the dinner I made. I am sure it'll be a 5/5 stars  when I try this again.
