We started cooking the potatoes first because we knew they would take more than ten minutes and then added the sausage. The shrimp and corn went in together along with the little neck clams we decided to include in this amazing dinner. We fed a crowd of thirteen people while on vacation last week and everyone raved about this great summer dish. A salad and a loaf of crusty bread rounded out this authentic southern meal. Give it a try, there's nothing not to like. Thanks so much Kim!!!!

This is a great SC recipe, a staple at our house!  Couple of pointers -- add the corn just before the shrimp so it doesn't overcook.  This is typically served on a picnic table covered with newspaper and eaten with your hands.  When finished, roll up the mess and toss!

I used about 3 quarts of water, 1/4 cup of Old Bay seasoning and 5-6 dashes of hot sauce.  Then boiled the onion, potatoes, corn until done, then added shrimp and boiled for about 3 more minutes.  Absolutely perfect!!!

I was in the Air Force Reserves in Charleston, SC and cooked this many times for our unit.  The most we cooked for was 500 people!  We used the large bag of Zatarans shrimp and crab boil and everyone loved the taste it added.  For a large group we used the following formula.  This is a per person calculation so just multiply the number of people times each of the items and it works out great.  1/2 pound shrimp 1/2 pound sausage (we used Andouille or smoked Kielbasa) 1 ear of corn 1 potato (or 3 to 4 small red potatoes) 1 large onion  Served with sweet tea or ice cold beer!!!  We used the pour over newspaper on picnic tables method of serving.  Be sure to put out plenty of rolls of paper towels to use for napkins.  This is the low country at its best!

This was a good recipe, but I should have read the other reviews and added the corn at the end.  The corn in mine was overdone.  Other than that it was very good.  I put about 2 T Old Bay seasoning in - not the 3 oz that the recipe called for.  That seemed like too much to me.  I might add 3 T next time, but it was still good.  Super easy!

Excellent!  Even my picky husband liked it!  I was trying pieces as it cooked (I have no patience) and wasn't sure how good it was going to be.  But, in the end it was fantastic.  The whole was better than the sum of the parts.  We used corn off the cob, because that's what I had, which broke tradition, but turned out pretty nicely.

Instead of water we substituted cheap beer for that added taste! And Old Bay seasoning. Nice touch!

This is a favorite at our house, too, and a staple meal for anyone from the SC Lowcountry!  My son has been requesting it for dinner since before he could even say "sausage" and it's always been his favorite.  I agree with others who suggest waiting to add the corn until just before the shrimp, otherwise it will overcook while you wait for the potatoes to cook thoroughly.  And a tablespoon or two of Old Bay really does give it just the right taste!  Another option is to brown the smoked sausage slices before adding them in with the potatoes.  We prefer it that way. A great meal to serve outdoors, and with lots of napkins, as you eat the shrimp and corn with your hands!

Yea, I also cooked the potatoes for about 20 minutes before, added shrimp and corn last. Substituted Old Bay or Pappy's Seasoning (thought I had Old Bay but didn't), also added Onion Powder, Salt, Pepper, No Salt Seasoning and this turned out GREATTT! My boyfriend (who is picky by the way) loved it and told me to definitely save that recipe, so this was definitely a biggggg Hit!

Excellent!  My sister-in=law does this every new year.  I did as suggested and waited to put in corn with shrimp.  3 T of old bay was perfect!

I used this recipe and another for chicken bog for a catering for 100 and both were terrific! I used "Old Bay" (our regional favorite) for the seasoning and it could not have been better.  Thanks Kim!

I agree the recipe needs tweaking but we loved it!  I boiled the potatoes for about 15 minutes before adding the sausage for about 5 minutes, then added fresh corn for 5 minutes in the meantime adding crab legs and shrimp for 2-3 minutes to finish. In hindsight my pot was a little small (I ended up having to fish out the potatoes and corn to make room for the seafood), and I should have left the crab legs in a tad bit longer to heat. Also, although I used the full 3 ounces of boil mix it still needed salt. This was fantastic and easy!

Corn needed a little more time, and my family would have liked some chicken in it.

The real name for this dish is Frogmore stew. I make it all the time and it's a huge hit with my family. When I'm making it for company I add a few bunches of crab legs to it to make it authentic and it never fails to be a hit. Fresh Cilantro, Parsley, and Basil add just the right touch to it as well.

We calculated this recipe for 40 people (we had 35).  We believed it to be too skimpy on the ingredients, so we used 6 lbs of sausage (not 5); 70 fresh corn pieces cut 2 inches (not 50 pieces); 70 small potatoes (not 50); 20 oz of spice (not 15) and 10 lbs of shrimp ( not 7.5) and jumbo size not large.  Shrimp and corn proved to be adequate; potatoes and sausage were gone (ran out).

We altered preparation based on past experience. Here's our approach.  We put the seasoning in boiling water, and added the potatoes and cooked them until a fork test showed that they were almost done.  Then, we added the sausage and corn at the same time, and cooked about ten minutes.  We then added the shrimp and cooked for two to three minutes. We lifted the basket out of the pot, poured the "stew" into a deep serving pan and served, and our guests raved on and on about it.  The potatoes were done, the corn and sausage were just right and the shrimp were sweet and juicy and not over cooked.

The ingredients in the recipe were just right; however, the proportions were a bit off, as indicated above.  And we believe that the placement of all of the ingredients into the water (except for the shrimp) as this recipe calls for would result in undercooked potatoes or over cooked corn and sausage.  These are the reasons for the rating we gave (three stars).

My husband really liked this recipe.  It is kind of like gumbo.  I used a few different items because of what was on hand.  The  and shrimp seasoning mix.....I used Old Bay.  Instead of corn on the cob....I used whole kernal corn from a can.  I also had to use previously frozen shrimp from the prepackaged stuff at the store.  I don't eat seafood, but again, my husband thought it was great.

I love Beaufort, SC. Very quaint and friendly.  Its like a miniature Charleston.  I like the sounds of your recipe.  Very much like New England coastal towns recipes. This one sounds very easy to do, and I know I will like it.   Thanks so much from, Janine Suzanne

Love this.  Many ways to gild this lily.  Someone already mentioned cooking it in beer, someone else mentioned using crab legs.  Clams and craw fish work really well, but the ultimate is to substitute Maine lobsters for the shrimp.  please ignore the idea of using cut corn.  You're going to want to cook it in a pot with a strainer, and chicken?!   We've enjoyed it most every way mentioned and at least one in the town of Frogmore from whence it originated.  Try it.
