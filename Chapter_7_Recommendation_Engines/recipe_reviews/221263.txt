Loved the flavor!  And yes, I had to tweak a bit, but only used jar lemon juice instead of fresh and using dried dill instead of fresh.  And finally, the grill was not gonna happen in that weather.  I covered a baking sheet with foil, placed the soaked cedar planks on it and added the salmon then covered with sauce.  Baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Garnished with a little lemon zest and dried dill.  Yes, I came up with too much sauce also (at least the ingredients are easy to adjust!) but loved it, ummmm maybe reserve some for dipping.  Cannot wait to try this using the grill!  Thanks Gay for a great recipe.  I served this with rice and Garlic Spinach.

Easy. Great Flavor! I brushed the Salmon with olive oil and sprinkled with a little salt and pepper before putting on the plank.  Also, put a little white wine in the sauce. I used reconstituted lemon juice and dried dill.

Followed the directions and it came out perfect.. Yes, I had extra sauce.. so served it on the side.. My guests put it on the grilled asparagus and I think possibly even the bread..  It was that good!  Have made it twice so far and will make it again.. One of my favorites grilled salmon recipes.. We have salmon a lot here in the Pacific Northwestâ€¦.  Just made it again and this time I was a little heavy handed on the dijon mustard..It was still very good, but the sauce can easily overwhelm the delicate flavor of the salmon.. Be careful..

This recipe has great flavor. I love the dijon mixed with the mayonnaise! We didn't have any fancy cedar planks so we cut down some extra cedar fence pickets we had and soaked them for most of the day. This recipe did make too much sauce for just one fillet. We had two fillets and still had extra. My husband and I will definitely make this again!

Everyone loved it. This makes enough sauce to cover the salmon completely which keeps the salmon moist inside

Simple and easy no brainer meal. My family loves it. I added green onions and yellow onions on the top. My daughter adds lemon juice to her portion.

I thought the mustard was a little too much. It seemed to hide the salmon flavor. Next time I will try it again and cut the mustard in half. . Otherwise, it was very good.  Martin

I did everything as directed. Not sure why people like this so much. The creamy mustardy sauce was unsettling with the smoky flavor of the fish. Both my husband and I really disliked it. Will not be making this again.
