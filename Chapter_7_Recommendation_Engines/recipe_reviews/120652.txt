I've been thinking I should try homemade syrup because it just doesn't seem right that a product made with sugar and water should contain so many mysterious ingredients and preservatives.  I had no choice this morning because I started pancakes before I realized there was just a little bit left in the bottle.  I found this recipe to be a GREAT subsitute.  It was the same as the store bought stuff in color and texture.  I didn't have any maple flavoring but no one in my family knew the difference.  It might even be worth puchasing maple flavoring just for this recipe.  I haven't done the math but a couple of batches of this probably costs pennies, verses 2 dollars and up for a name brand syrup with very little difference in quality.  Plus, there's the benefit of one less processed-food that goes into my kids.  This will be made over and over and over in my house.

This came out perfectly.

I changed nothing and doubled the recipe.
(We use A LOT of syrup in this house!)
This was not hard at all to make and pretty straightforward. Mine thickened up nicely. This will be a nice syrup to have on hand for when we want a change from the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site. 

I'll never spend $4.00 on a bottle of 
pre-made pancake syrup again, now I know how easy it is to make at home.

UPDATED AGAIN 12/12/08: I made a triple batch of this today, using a tsp. of butter flavoring in with the maple. For those interested, a triple batch will almost fit in an empty Country Kitchen syrup bottle.

This was good.  I didn't have maple extract and I forgot to add the vanilla.  This definitely has the consistency of the store bought syrups.

When I made this recipe as written (minus maple extract), it was too sweet, so I tweaked it to make it a five star recipe. I only use brown sugar; to me the white is totally unnecessary. Just use 3/4 to 1 cup brown sugar, and I also add a little bit of salt. My husband loves the syrup. Oh, and I don't have maple extract so I use plenty of vanilla.

I decided to use this recipe because I'd run out of store bought syrup. My expectations weren't high, but the syrup actually turned out really good. I did add about 1/4 teaspoon salt to balance out the sweet. My only recommendation is that if I make it again I'll use 1 cup of water instead of 3/4 cup. Once it cooled it was too thick.

Great recipe! I didn't have maple flavor, so I just used vanilla and it was still great. Hubby and 5 kids loved it!

Fantastic syrup recipe! Only thing I did different was I used 1 tsp of vanilla, as I didn't have any maple. Yum!

Excellent recipe.  Ran out of store bought syrup and I had already made my pancakes.  Decided to look for something simple I could whip up and came up with this.  My family loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

This was so good - everyone loved it. I used CDT's recommendation and used the almond extract as well. I was so happy to realize the syrup thickens while cooling.

Ok so a recipie for syrup....  youd think Duhh, but hey! This one is great!  Who knew?  I made it with cinnamon instead of maple and it came out great! Try it yourself you will be impressed!  Add a tablespoon of butter as it cools to enhance the richness.

I made this syrup with the good old fashioned pancakes recipe and they are just amazing together! This recipe is great just the way it is and is super easy to make! No more store bought syrup for me!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is perfect as is. I only added another 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavoring and another half teaspoon of vanilla ext., and a tablespoon of butter but  that was to my particular taste. When it says boil 7 minutes or until SLIGHTLY thickened, THEY MEAN SLIGHTLY. In my first batch i boiled mine for about..15 minutes because it didn't look thick enough at 7....or at 10.....and then when i took it off the stove and it cooled down, I ended up w/ something nearly close to hard stretchy candy. Wasted an entire recipe of those ingredients and not to mention the electricity and time it took, but at least i learned my lesson. Second time around (with stomach rumbling and my pancakes sitting in a plate losing their fluffy warmth) I boiled for approximately 8-9 minutes (considering the butter and extra flavorings added) all the while checking every minute after 6 minutes while taking in consideration how much it'll thicken on its own while it cools and after 8-9 minutes and 30 minutes of cooling it turned out perfectly. Perfect store-bought consistency and tasted amazing over "oatmeal and wheat flour blueberry pancakes" recipe on this site. Next time I will try this syrup with the "fluffy pancakes" recipe on this site or a buttermilk recipe and I'm sure they'll turn out just as yummy!

This syrup is sooo delicious it tastes way better then the stuff that comes in the bottle and I compared ingredients and saw all the unneeded ingredients like Preservatives and Cellulose gum. I will be making this again.

I doubled the recipe & added some almond flavoring, too. Everyone here liked it & I am happy  to not have to buy the over-priced syrups in the store. When I make it in the future I can play w/other flavorings-butter-cinnamon-pecan, etc. Thanks, Jill!

This was great. Had very little of the store bought left. Made this and the store bought was still in the bottle, after all of the pancakes were gone. Will make again. I did use all brown sugar and a tbsp of butter when adding the vanilla. Lefted out the maple extract.

O_o If I was in an extreme pinch I might use this again as a base recipe.  Maybe it was just me.  It was just too sweet for my needs.  I didn't serve it. I'm glad I tried it though.  Thanks for sharing it.

Keeper, for sure.  Added butter flavoring, as another reviewer suggested, and used all brown sugar.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and I (like all of the others) will never buy breakfast syrup again!!

Why ever pay a fortune for expensive syrup from the grocery store anymore, when you probably have most of the ingredients to make this in your pantry already? Maple extract isn't very expensive and one bottle will make several batches. I added just a dash of cinnamon to the syrup before simmering. If it's not thick enough to suit your tastes, you can simmer it another couple of minutes, even if you only make that discovery after cooling. Just put it back into the saucepan, bring it to a simmer, and continue for another 2-3 minutes (longer if you like it really thick.) If you accidentally boil it down too long, so that it gets too thick, add a touch of water and blend in. When the syrup was cool and I tried it, the maple flavor needed to be just a little stronger, so I added another 1/4 tsp extract to satisfy our palates. Also added about 2 tsp butter, and it tastes just like Mrs. Butterworth. Now I just use the bottle, and fill it with this. Great money saver, and better flavor.

Great recipe!!  Even better than the last one I tried from this site.  It is just as good, if not BETTER, than store-bought syrup.  That being said, I'm still not thrilled about the corn syrup, so I made it a second time and substituted an equal amount of honey for the corn syrup.  It was surprisingly good!!  Think I'll stick with that from now on.  This recipe is a keeper!  I also add a pinch of salt to complement the sweetness.  Goodbye store-bought syrup, I won't be needing you anymore!

Easy, tasty recipe!  I found this out of desperation when I discovered that we were out of syrup as I made pancakes.  It tasted much better than store bought syrup.  I did not have maple flavoring, but couldn't tell the difference.  We will use this all the time.  Thanks!

YUM! I didn't have maple extract, so I added some molasses. So good! Had some depth to it-not just super sweet like some syrups.

This syrup has been used in my family, beginning with my mother, for the last 65 years that I know of. I prefer it to commercial pancake syrup which has a twang I just don't care for. It's wonderfully simple. We never added the corn syrup, which helps prevent it from crystallizing in storage. But to do that, just don't put a spoon in the pan after adding the ingredients except ONCE to stir them together. By the time it begins to simmer, swirl the pan -- don't stir! And that is good advice for any syrup or candy. Making this syrup at home is fresher -- and far less expensive!

WOW!  Super-good and super-easy!  I didn't have maple flavoring, so doubled up on the vanilla.  Didn't even miss the maple, but will be buying some next time I'm at the store so I can make it right.  :o)

This recipe is amazing. I left out the maple flavoring as most did and replaced it with the vanilla. I use this on homemade waffles and it is so very good. I think it is much better than store bought. I made up extra and keep it in a jar in the frig and then warm it when needed. YUMMY!

So good! I did add a dash of salt and a tablespoon of Jack Daniel's before boiling. I will never ever buy syrup in a store again!

This was dilicious.  This was the first time I made syrup, and I loved how easy it was.  I don't think I cooked it long enough (needed more than 7 minutes), but I will try it again.

This recipe is great!!! On New Years day i decided i wanted to make french toast for everyone and i noticed we only had enough syrup for one person, so i found this recipe and decided to try it.  I didn't have maple syrup so i added some ground cinnamon, a little allspice, and some nutmeg. It turned out delicious.  After it cooled down i poured it in the syrup bottle and never told anyone til after they ate it that i had made the syrup homemade they were surprised because they said it didn't taste any different then the store bought syrup.  I will now continue to use this recipe it is cheaper and better.

I use this recipe all the time, though I only use equal parts sugar and water and maple flavoring.  You can prep this the night before, stir it a few times here and there , and the sugar melts into the water and you do not need to boil it at all. Love it!

So much better than store bought!!
Quick
Easy
Delicious!!
We'll never use store-bought again! My girls want pancakes every morning now, not just Saturday! Since it has become so popular I have made the recipe x4 and jarred the syrup. A family of 4-5  can easily go through a single serving in one sitting!!

After trying different syrup recipes, I tried this one. Its definitely the only one I will use from now on. I used all vanilla instead of vanilla & maple, it still was great. It is more of the consistency of syrup that I expect. Thank you for posting it Jill!

Needed extra syrup and looked online for help. This is so easy and made from ingredients I had on hand. I'll never buy store syrup again. I accidently added 2T of butter to the pan in the beginning of the boiling process and it was great!

Not only does this save money, it does not contain corn syrup which is the main ingredient in commercial productts.  Corn syrup in way too many products for our good health.

YUM!!  I used Splenda instead of white sugar, and I left out the maple flavoring.  This is SO GOOD!!!  You should heat it slowly though, it helps to prevent some of that sticky coating on the top.  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!! :)

Tastes great.  I increased the vanilla and maple just a little.  Mine ended up getting too thick.  My old recipe calls for bringing to a full boil and then simmering (rather than to continue to boil), so I will follow those directions next time.  We did enjoy this and will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This syrup really turned out great! I didn't have any maple syrup around (neither did I have maple extract) so like a few other reviewers I simply used the vanilla extract doubled (1 tsp.) instead. It turned out really well- was sweet and not overly vanilla-y tasting. I would definitely recommend this recipe. Thanks!

This was very easy to make.  I used Almond extract and vanilla.  Gave it a four cause it has a nutty flavor (used the nut extract).  Next time I'll just use straight vanilla.  My 5 yr old gobbled it up along with blueberry pancakes.  YUM.

This was really great.  I used Raw brown sugar and substituted honey for the white sugar.  I didn't have maple flavoring so I skipped it.  My kids loved it and asked me not to buy store bought anymore. Was thicker than most homemade versions

Like others, I did not have syrup and I thought to myself just to look online to see if there were recipes. I looked all over my cupboards and had everything but brown sugar and maple extract. 

So I used 3/4th cup of sugar as I did not want to sugar overload my little girl and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. It came out water but the taste was so good!! So Im going to the store later on to stock up on brown sugar and maple extract!! I will be making my own syrup from now on! It was just so tasty! I bet it taste even better with the right ingredients lol!

I made pancakes but NO Syrup to befound!  Jill Hanns' recipe saved my morning.  It is so good with only Vanilla extract.  I'll add Maple flavoring next batch.  Thanks a bunch again to Jill and all the reviewers.

4 stars for the original recipe.  Definately only boil 7 minutes... it WILL thicken upon cooling.  I doubled the recipe and used only brown sugar with the corn syrup, and I only had maple extract.  It waseven better than the original recipe!!

I needed a recipe while taking a long trip overseas. The recipe was great!    I did change a few things, but these were due mostly to where I was and what supplies I could get.    In Iceland, the brown sugar has a MUCH stronger flavor than even dark brown sugar has in the states. Corn syrup is unavailable, as is maple flavoring for the most part.     We use 2/3 c brown sugar to 1/3 c white and a large spoonful of treacle instead of the corn syrup.     It still came out great! My kids were really surprised to be able to have pancake syrup "from home".    Thanks again!

Comparable to the store bought but better because it's home-made :)  Takes some planning because it takes 7 minutes to cook and 15 minutes to cool off (although I used the syrup while still warm as we didn't want to wait and it was quite good that way).  I know lots of reviewers like the vanilla better and it works fine that way but if you're going to make this again it is worth having the maple flavoring on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to say that this was a very easy and tasty syrup recipes to make. I followed the recipe all the way to the part of adding maple flavoring, which I didn't have. So I substituted it with honey and it came out really good. So good that my whole family enjoyed it. Thank you.

Tastes just like the syrup out of the bottles.  Out of syrup and you have the ingredients in the house no one will know the difference.  Also, stores very long in the fridge just like the bottled syrup.  Thanks for the subtitute!

Certainly as good as - or better than - any store bought syrup. Easy to make. We still like pure maple syrup the best but this was a yummy & quick substitute in a pinch. Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet! I've used it often and love it...so do my 3 kids and hubby. Once, I added more corn syrup to thicken it up a bit. Husband did not like that, but kids didn't mind. :) I've also tried it with just the brn sugar, as others suggested and it still turns out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe - it worked great in a pinch when I ran out of Mrs. Butterworth's.  I loved how simple the ingredient list was and may make this in the future if I run out of syrup again.

When I ran out of store bought syrup, I made this as a quick substitute.  I didn't have any maple flavoring in the cabinet, but did have banana and rum flavors.  Now I have a yummy bananas foster syrup.

This was pretty good for not wanting to go to the store to buy syrup. I didn't have any maple flavoring, so I'm not sure if it would have been better.  It would have been better if it were a little thicker and not so sweet.  It was a little much for me!  But, a good quick fix!

Oh Man!! You saved the day with this recipe!! I thought I'd try it, I didn't have any in the house and my waffles were already made and I am amazed!! I had never made homemade syrup before and was not certain if I wanted to try this after seeing my sister make syrup when I was younger, it was like flavored sugar water! So see my excitment when I made this and it turned out beautifully!!! Thank you!! I will make this syrup all the time now. No more store bought, this recipe holds it own and is SOOOO easy to make!!

This was a great homemade syrup. It was fast and easy too. I found out after I started that I didn't have any maple flavor, so I used a combo of butter and rum extracts to equal the given amount of maple. I don't know if mine turning out so well means you can change it out with say raspberry or orange or almond, but it worked for me. Next time I'll make sure I have maple in my pantry for maple syrup, although I thought the butter rum flavor was great too. This made enough for breakfast for 3 people and there is plenty left for another meal. Thanks, this saved me $ and I had the fun of making my own syrup!

I love this syrup.  you can add some butter for more buttery flavor.  real Maple and good vanilla to make the taste pop.  I do put in a pinch of salt for flavor.

Ive been making this for a couple of years, like others said I tried it in a pinch, first batch sorry to say was almost disgustingly sweet, but not be deterred i played with the recipe and adjusted the sugar till i finally got it just right for my family.(some may like it very well just the way it is but my family always uses light syrup)  I ended up eliminating the white sugar altogether and drastically reduced the brown sugar almost to the point of just using it for color (last batch i used DARK brown sugar), plus I add butter flavoring in addition to maple and vanilla. if i can figure out how to post  it i'll put my version up soon.

This is the only pancake/waffle syrup we use in our house.  The only addition I make is 1 tsp of butter flavoring.  It comes out tasting just like the store bought butter flavored syrup but without all of the artificial stuff!  Thank you Jill for sharing!!!!

It was okay.  I would make it again if I was in a bind.

Very easy and delicious. The first few times I made it with all vanilla because I did not have the maple flavoring. I thought it tasted fine. I enjoy not having to worry about running out of syrup - I just make my own.

This syrup turned out great! I didn't have any maple extract, so I just used a little extra vanilla, and it was very good! Next time, I'll try out the maple just to see how it tastes, but just with the vanilla alone, this was excellent.

This is a good syrup.  Next time I'll follow other reviewers recommendation for using only brown sugar.  I added pecans and cinnamon at the end and that bumped up the flavor a bit.

Awesome recipe!  Super simple to make. I made this and my son loved it! I am NEVER buying store bought again...I did not have maple syrup flavoring, so the vanilla worked well. This is a great base for adding other flavors.  I added two pats of butter to it before it cooled....I liked the flavor but not the consistency. it was a bit clumpy, which is not going to be good for storing(i can see it now)   I am an experimentalist so... 5 stars baby!

Sorry, but this didn't do it for us.  It was easy to make and inexpensive, but my fiance took a couple of bites and headed for the cupboard and the store bought stuff.  Perhaps I made a mistake in preparing it?

Soooo good!  Did not have maple flavoring so used about 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Also added about 1/2 tsp salt to sugar mixture before boiling.  And added 1 T butter after it was finished boiling.  No artifical taste like store bought, so cheap, yummy and easy!

I changed nothing and the kids prefer this to the stuff I used to buy so I always make it now!  I have doubled this and there was no difference.  I have already made it three times and I expect to make it again tomorrow.

I omitted the white sugar and upped the brown to a full cup. Had no maple flavouring so I used almond since that's what I had on hand. I did eyeball the extracts and may have put a little too much. Did the taste test and found this to be a little sweet, and the flavouring not right. But that could be my fault for putting too much extracts. This makes a very small amount, and I would only make this again if I was out of syrup and needed some in a pinch.

I asked my littlest grandson if he would like (his favorite) pancakes for breakfast before I realized we had no syrup. I didn't want to disappoint him or go to the store as we are a bit off the beaten path. I came to allrecipes to look for help and found this recipe which had ingredients I had on hand except the maple flavoring. We had a bit of pure Maine maple syrup left over from our trip to the farm on Maine Maple Sunday so I used a bit of that instead. That was the only substitution; the rest I followed exactly. My gradson and boyfriend loved it! I don't think they will let me buy it again! We love your recipe and next time I will have the maple flavoring on hand! Thanks!

This was SO GOOD! The consistency and color was the same as store bought syrup, but it was WAY BETTER! I didn't have any maple flavoring so I just used a full teaspoon of vanilla instead of a half, and I didn't even miss the maple flavor. I will never buy syrup again!

This is So good! My kids can't do artificial flavors and only 1 will eat real maple syrup. This will be all I use from now on. It tastes like pancake syrup (better even) but without the artificial flavors.  I used all natural maple flavoring and real vanilla extract for this. Much more economical and better tasting! Thanks so much for sharing this one!

This recipe is amazing!  I have never made homemade syrup before but like others have mentioned, I thought making it might save some money.  I made it with Good Old Fashioned Pancakes, also from this site, and it was a huge hit!  Next time, I might try adding almond extract, as others have suggested, but the recipe is perfect as is.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Like most people who have rated this recipe, I also, ran out of pancake syrup after the french toast was made.  I thought, "hey, it shouldn't be that hard, right?".  It really wasn't.  And it tasted great!!  
Only omission was the maple extract because I didn't have it on hand.  Oh, and I only had brown sugar flavored dark corn syrup instead of the light. I will definetly try to stick to the exact recipe next time.  Can't wait...

I really liked the look of this recipe, but I made some adjustments. I used 1C brown sugar, and instead of the water I used 1C of Prickly Pear Juice. My family LOVED it. Thank you for the recipe.

i may have cooked this too long, but it was about 7 minutes and the syrup ended up hardening like crazy. the dishes that came into contact with the syrup are ruined and i had to throw them away. not to mention my teeth! i'm sure that it is a great recipe (from reading the reviews), but i had zero luck :(

This was wonderful!!! It has a great consistency like real maple syrup. I didn't have maple flavoring so I used hazelnut extract instead and my family loved it. I will certainly make this again and again!
