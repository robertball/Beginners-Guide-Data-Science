I wrote this recipe! PLEASE disregard the vinegar! You can use vinegar or ketchup, but not both! Also, you can use orange/ lemon lime soda or ginger ale instead of pineapple juice and water. Cut the sugar way down if you use soda. It is also fantastic with brown sugar and/ or soy sauce. I make this almost daily. (with whatever combo of ingredients I have on hand).The recipe  is so forgiving and it will whip up in a sauce pan in no time. . My kids dip everything in it!

Easy and good. I ended up dissolving the cornstarch in pineapple juice because I started with a bigger can of pineapple.  And I used brown sugar - didn't measure but tried to add a little less than a cup.

The flavor was great, but it ended up very thick and jelly-like. i would cut the cornstarch next time.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. Changes I made were to reduce the sugar to only 3 tablespoons. I also used only 1/2 of the ketchup and used Thai sweet chili sauce for the remaining amount. That added a nice kick without overwhelming. I used rice vinegar, but feel that it needed the stronger flavor of apple cider vinegar.

This sweet and sour sauce is better than even what restaurants serve. It doesn't taste very good at first, but if you let it sit and cool down the flavor is much better.

I was very skeptical of this recipe. I followed the notes to switch leave out the vinegar and substitute lemon-lime soda for the pineapple. This came out very well. I added a bit of soy sauce, brown sugar and a touch of barbeque sauce. My kids loved it and it is way better than any of the bottled stuff in the grocery store. The novelty of ketchup and soda mixed together helped too I think. I will use it again when I need a sweet and sour sauce.

This was pretty nice, better than I expected it to be. I made it exactly as written, but I skipped the optional carrots. (I probably would have liked them, but I just didn't want to have to go buy them.) For the pineapple, I used a can of crushed pineapple. I was a little worried the sauce would be "chunky", but the crushed pineapple softened up a lot. I'm not a kid, but I ate this sauce as suggested, over meals of chicken nuggets and white rice. I thought this made quite a lot, though - those "4 servings" must be fairly large, in my opinion.

Yes used only ketchup instead of vinegar. This was a great add to homemade chicken nuggets or rice. Awesome flavor!

Luckily, I read the comment about choosing ketchup OR vinegar and not doing both! That would have wasted time and money had I not happened to read that. I would also suggest using a little bit less sugar. I went the ketchup route, so maybe the vinegar wouldn’t be this way, but it was just a little bit too sweet, even for for my kids. I’m also adding some onions and bell peppers next time because it was all kind of one note. The positive about that is that it lives true to its name and is kid-friendly. But even some kids love more flavor, so those other things are good optional add-ins!

6 1/2 year old approved!  My daughter loves the jarred stuff from the grocery store that contains a ton of ingredients.  Tonight I made this and didn't tell her.  She said it tasted so good and when I told her that it was homemade, she said she liked this even better!  I used both the vinegar and the ketchup, and it tasted great!  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! And for those of us that can not or do not want sugar in our diets, even we can enjoy. I made it as the original recipe is posted using Apple cider vinegar, but replaced the sugar with granulated Slenda and my family did not even know the difference.  I served it over Banquet Popcorn Chicken, Diced  orange peppers, pineapple chunks and rice. They loved it.

Will be using this as my go to recipe for sweet and sour sauce. I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of the 1 cup and found it was sweet enough. My girls frowned upon me putting the pineapple back into the pan so I did leave them out (they came in asking what was for supper and saw the pineapple sitting out and asked why). Hubby said it had good flavor but could be a bit more tangier so next time I think I'll add a bit more vinegar.(I also did not add the optional carrots) Thanks for the recipe! AAA+++

I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly and it came out even better than the stuff from the Chinese restaurant. I did use frozen popcorn chicken instead of frying the chicken, but it was still a big hit with my kids.

Was super great!! I did the vinegar version with just a touch of ketchup for color. I added to chicken drumsticks that I dipped in egg mixture with pepper and homemade chilli sauce,  and then dipped in flour with red pepper, black pepper, paprika and cayenne. I baked the chicken at 375 for an hour (pan rubbed with olive oil and pam)and flipped chicken once.  then i scooped sauce into the chicken glass pan and let bake for another 10 minutes then turned it super down for another 10 mintutes. then i covered it until my hubby got home and was a super yummy success served over white rice. yeh!  thanks a bunch!!
