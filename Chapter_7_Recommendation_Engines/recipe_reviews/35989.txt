As an old school Italian, there isn't nearly enough spice for 20 lbs of pork. Surprised you can get any flavor at all. I've modified several times and I'm getting close to what I consider real Italian hot sausage from the neighborhood. Good spices, just needs a little help. Try this: 
 * cut back to 3-4 lbs of pork (grind your own) 
 * 1/2 tsp salt, 
 * 1 tbs garlic salt, 
 * 1/2 tsp pepper, 
 * 1 tbs paprika, 
 * 1/4 C olive oil, 
 * 1/2 tbs anise , 
 * 2 tbs fennel seed, (fennel is porks best friend)
 * 1 tbs red pepper

Trick: after is sets overnight, fry up a meatball of it and check its flavor. Add what you think it needs and set it overnight again. If it's fresh you should be able to do this several times before you have to freeze it or cook it.

Well, what can I say but awesome hot Italian sausage. I worked in Italian restaurants for 7-8 years and ours was never this tasty (although we would buy it in from local Italian butchers/deli's. I scaled down this recipe to 4 servings (1lb pork) just to see, I will buy 2-3 pounds next time and freeze in individual portions. I could not find the anise seed so simply left it out and was fine without. I compared this recipe to a few others I saw and could not believe the amount of peppers fennels used in theirs, way too hot, you want a nice hot taste you can enjoy while still tasting the pork like this recipe gives, perfect! you don't want to blow your head off, what for? might as well just cover a plain burger/sausage in tobasco!! I also just had this plain on a portuguese roll(can't find good Italian bread here apart from ciabatta) no butter no onions or peppers, with sausage this tasty you don't need anything else really. Thanks (UPDATE) I just scaled this recipe to 12 portions(3lb pork) don't do it, the ingredients are all wrong! the pork says 3 pounds which is 3 times the original recipe I made(1lb porkbut all the salt and rest of ngredients has been multiplied by 4!! way too salty, couldn't believe it. So, scale down the recipe to 4 or 8 servings but not 12 as it is all wrong.

Great recipe, I'm so glad I found it.  I live 70 miles from the nearest meat department that makes this sausage, so having this recipe makes my travel alot easier.  Recipe is good as is but I like extra "kick" in my sausage so I cut the ground Pork in half (to ten pounds) and left the rest of the ingredients the same. YEEEHAAA! Will never buy this sausage over the counter again.  Will only make my own with this recipe!!!

I made this recipe several times now and it is great! I took it to the butcher when I slaughtered a pig to see if he would make some up for me and he says he loves it too and might start using it instead of his recipe. It's about the best I tried

This recipe makes exquisite sausage.  Really, very tasty and satisfying.  I had to change the ratio of ingredients a bit, but all in all, this is our new sausage recipe!  I scaled the recipe down to 10 pounds of sausage, so if you're halving it, here is what I used.  Super simple to remember.  And as a side note, some of the reviewers stated that it wasn't spiced enough, so I made these changes based upon their reviews.

- 2 Tbl Salt
- 2 Tbl granulated garlic
- 2 Tbl ground black pepper
- 2 Tbl paprika
- 2 Tbl fennel seed, lightly toasted and ground
- 1 Tbl red pepper flakes (2 if you're feeling adventurous)

This was my first attempt at homemade sausage and I wasn't too crazy with the outcome of this recipe.  My sausage didn't seem to have enough flavor (not like the store bought) and I had to add quite a bit more salt than what the recipe calls for.  I did scale this down to 8 because I only had about 2 lbs of pork and I didn't have the anise so I left it out.  I added some onion flakes but made no other changes.  I tried this with spaghetti and the sausage was very much over powered by the tomato sauce.  Probably won't try again, but glad I gave it a shot.

This is a wonderful sausage recipe.  We buy a whole peice of porc and grind it ourselves to be able to control the quality and amount of fat. We use it in pasta and on pizza and even as a breakfast sausage patty.  I highly recommend it.

I really liked this recipe. I will probably never but Italian sausage again. I've tried it with ground turkey also....just as good! I do however use extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegie oil and sometimes omit the pepper flakes if the kids are going to be eating it.  All in all a really good Italian sausage!! Thanks!!!!!

Thank God for the scaling feature on this site! No home cook is going to risk 20# of pork just to try something. The text looked excellent so I scaled to 8 servings (2# of meat). After reading ALL comments, I omitted the salt and increased some of the seasonings. (I'll post again with my FINAL edition.) For now, my method changes include using fresh garlic to replace garlic salt, less paprika as it is mostly coloring, more black pepper, olive oil for veggie oil, skipped the anise [don't have any] and increased the fennel and doubled+ the red pepper flake. I lightly toast and grind fennel seed and half of the red pepper flake.  I'm on my third small batch and with #4 I'll get it perfect for my taste. Let's be clear here: There is nothing wrong with the original and it IS perfectly suitable for a mass-feeding or commercial use. On a much smaller scale, I usually test once as-is and if it has potential, begin to make it a personal recipe. I eliminated the extra salt, not for health reasons, but because I don't like that much and most end-use dishes for this sausage mixture already have plenty.  I toast and grind fennel seed to smooth the texture and to extract more flavor per unit. [This is not essential.] The red pepper flake and black pepper are the 'heat' sources and very personal, your mileage may vary. (A great alternative is White Pepper, which tends to have more zing.) Five Stars, based on great ingredients and potential when Sm. batch is adjusted to personal taste. *****

Good but could use some work.  I cut the servings Waaaay back first off because I was not willing to risk that much should we not like the sausage.  The seasoning is too light, it needs to be doubled. We prefer lots of heat so we used even more of the crushed red pepper. (we grow and dry our own)  I do suggest as the recipe indicates, to let the flavors mellow 24 hours then make a test meatball.  We did this twice so we could adjust the spices.  Another tip is to not pack the casings too full as I did.  Some of them broke open during baking.  They held their shape but I wanted them *perfect*.  Dont over stuff to avoid this.  I added fresh herbs from my garden of oregano, basil and parsley.  I used fresh garlic and no garlic salt.  I subbed veg oil with EVOO.  Using my changes and additions I will make again.

This is very nice.  I downsized it to 3 pounds pork, ground it on the KA stand-mixer, then stuffed links with the sausage accessory and casing from a local butcher.  We ruptured a couple casings from too-high a drive speed, set the speed to 1, then hand-advanced the meat, which worked fine.

I like more flavor than this recipe provides.  I decided to omit anise, since fennel has licorice flavor, and added some other things:

For four pounds of meat.  Include fat, or trim it off.

6 garlic cloves
2 white onions, run through the KA meat grinder

Basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, flat parsley, red bell pepper, fine chopped or food-processor macerated, optionally run through the KA meat grinder to crush and release juices, or mortar and pestle.

A little nutmeg.   A little cumin and coriander whole seeds, freshly ground.

Salt to taste.  (The suggestion to make a little meatball and cook it makes great sense, to gauge how much salt is needed, completely safely.)

These are suggestions.  You should figure out what tastes good to you and your family.

This is one of my standard freezer items now.  Mix one pound of sausage with a big can of tomatoes and a little water, simmer and voila - an easy and awesome sauce for a lasagna.

This recipe is just super!  I have use it in pork and turkey mostly, depending on what I have on hand.  I has a really authentic blend of spices that I just love.  Most of the time I just do small batches, and then I use a morter and pestal to blend the oil, fennel, red pepper and anise.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is definitely a goto in my recipe book!

YOWEE-ZOWEE!!!!! was this good!
 I used on sale $.97 a pound country style pork ribs and it was still the best sausage I have ever had. I added more fennel, chili flakes and salt after cooking a small sample, but that was just to my taste.
 For sandwiches, pasta, pizza or anything else, this is the recipe I'll be using from now on.
 YA DID GOOD JIM!

Excellent recipe. I downsized it to make two lbs. at a time by proportioning each ingredient. Also added one Tbls. of cider vinegar, really boosts it up.

I am Italian and have been eating sausage, peppers, and onions since I was a child.  It is one of my favorite dishes eating it as a sandwich with the fixings preferrably on a hard roll bun.  I make the sausage casserole once a month. Tomorrow is Sunday and am making the casserole with potatoes that are oven roasted.  Comfort food and love leftovers too! I love putting and cooking the sausage in my pasta sauce.  It gets so good as the sauce cooks and seeps into the sausage and makes it so tender and delicious.  Enough on sausage...manga.

Scaled recipe back to 4 servings to make one pound.  It wasn't hot and spicy, which is what I wanted and knocked it down 1 star, but it is a GREAT regular Italian Sausage recipe with 5 stars.  I fried it in bulk after allowing to sit for 24 hours to add to my homemade pizza chili.  Thank you for the recipe.

This a very good recipe for italian sausage.  We use papa's recipe from the old country-Sicily- which includes grated romano cheese and fresh chopped parsley, no garlic.  The oil keeps it moist and makes it so much easier to stuff the casings. Don't forget to fry a test patty to taste and adjust the seasoning if too bland.  Making sausage is a lot of work especially if you grind the pork meat yourself.  But you'll know exactly what went into it, no surprises i.e. bone chips, grizzle yuk!

Great recipe.  Gave it 4 stars because it need to work on the spice combo some more.  First I scaled down the recipe to 20 servings, omitted anise (YUCK), only added a pinch of fennel seed, used 1/2 smoked paprika and 1/2 regular paprika (will go with all smoked next time).  I also slightly increased the amount of hot pepper flakes.  Will NEVER use store bought sausage again.  Thanks for sharing!

I skip the oil and use fresh garlic instead of dried or garlic salt. This recipe is otherwise similar to another homemade Italian sausage recipe I use.  Yummy!

This was actually quite easy to make.  I halved the recipe and froze the sausage in links, patties, meatballs and in 2 lbs. in bulk.  We had some of the meatballs in sauce and they were great.  Very flavorful, we will certainly make them again.

Loved it but have to share a couple of things. As a Butcher (retired) I have come to know a few things. #1 If you weigh 3 oz. of salt for every 10 lbs of pork when making sausage you will never go wrong. For 20 lbs of sausage, use a handful of fennel seed. (grind half in a coffee grinder) Use fresh garlic cloves mixed in a blender with water. Put all your spices in a bowl add the water/garlic mix. Add additional water to make a smooth paste. Mix into meat well. Use other ingredients stated for your own personal taste.  This recipe is tried and proven to delight.

Awesome!  Had 20 lbs of moose to deal with, and didn't want to do another 'kit' seasoning.  Unfortunately, I was out of fennel seed; amped up with extra star anise to try to compensate.  Still delicious, but would have been better with the fennel.  Used 20 lbs ground moose, 4 lbs pork fat, and used Vinnie's amped up spice ratios.  Also had a jar of homemade chipotle from smoking and drying some jalapeños that I threw in there.  Labeled all the freezer packs of sausage as ' vinnie-bag-o-donuts' :). Can't wait to try it again with some fennel....

I needed to pinch hit to turn plain ground turkey into spicy sausage for my soup.  This was delicious!  I downscaled the recipe to 1 lb.  All of the ingredients are important, including the anise and fennel seeds, which I bought in bulk at my local store with bulk spice section.  I used it immediately, rather than let it sit for 24 hours, and for this purpose it was fine.

Very tasty. I scaled it down to use with 1 lb of sausage. Not very spicy which was good, but VERY tasty. Will use this recipe as my standard and when I want it hotter, I'll use more red pepper flakes.

Really an excellent recipe as it is using simple ingredients from the spice shelf.

If you like a little hotter, add more pepper flakes, more anise or fennel add a bit more.. but of all the recipes I have tried over the years.. this one beats them all!

Thank you Jim for posting this recipe. It will be one that is now in the family recipe books forever!

Different and fun project.  We made these up a few weeks ago and barbeques some this weekend.  I'd like to play around with the spices some more as they seem to need a little something.  Overall good though.

This is the BEST!!  I make this big batch, put it in a jar (without the vegetable oil) and take out 2 tablespoons of the spice mix per pound of meat and add 2 tsp plus 1/2 tsp oil and a splash of vinegar. I make it all the time!

Just what I was looking for! They just don't make decent sausage in Asia...but this makes me feel right at home.  I scaled down the recipe for 1 lb pork and thought everything was perfect except the red pepper flakes--I'll add a little more next time.

The sausage turned out wonderful, however it was not as hot as expected. The recipe calls for paprika, is that sweet or hot?  It was unclear, but wonderful flavor.

Kind of you to share thank you. However, these spice amounts can not be correct.  There is no way a tablespoon of these spices would effect 20 lbs of pork, that is not logical. I do believe it would be hot and salty, certainly edible, but "Italian", no way. Fennel is a key ingredient in Italian Sausage. I use 1 Tbsp fennel per lb. pork, not per 20 lbs.
Perhaps you will try my recipe. Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to make it as hot as you like.
Darlene's Italian Sausage: 
T-Tablespoon,  Teas-Teaspoon.
3 lbs ground pork, 3 T Fennel seeds, 1 T Black Pepper, 2 T Paprika, 1 T Sea Salt, 1/2 bulb garlic-finely minced, 1 teas Red Pepper Flakes, 1 T White Sugar. 
Mix to combine. 
Let sit in fridge for 12 hours. 
Freezes beautifully, flavourful, and juicy.
Have a nice day.

This is a good recipe. Halved it and used 5 lbs pork butt and 5 lbs venison. It turned out great. Definitely using more spice when making again. This is a versatile recipe so make it to satisfy your taste. Enjoyed the time making these with DH

Recipe was really soft tasting, it was like the polish version of an italian sausage recipe given to them watered down. I doubled all spices accept reg. salt,tripled garlic salt,i had halved ingredients for 7 lbs, added a 1/4 cup granulated garlic for the hell of it, I'm Italian! Accidently added a 1/4 cup of chile de arbol powder thinking it was my paprika, its hot! So I got real hot italian sausage! original recipe was good as a burger recipe tho! but not for much of anything else In my opinion, others may vary! So eat whatever version you enjoy!

I found this very bland. For each 5 lb of pork, I ended up adding 2 tbsp salt, 2 tbsp black pepper, 2 tbsp crushed red pepper, 1 heaped tbsp ground fennel, and 1 tbsp granulated garlic. For regular Italian sausage I halved the crushed red pepper and omitted the garlic. I found it helpful to freeze the pork for about 30 minutes before grinding. Also, cook a little of the mix after adding the seasoning to test the taste. You can always add more of something!!

I needed some sausage but didn't want to go to the store. I scaled to use 1 pound of meat and substituted ground turkey and ground cayenne instead of red pepper flakes. Tastes great and easy! Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good.  I ended up adding using garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and adding more red pepper and salt.  I reduced the Anise and Fennel by 1/3.  Everyone liked it for eating as sausage patties this way.  Will try it on Pizza next week.

This recipe is fantastic! Just like Grandma used to make. I ground my own pork, useing a pork roast and scaled the recipe down to 4 servings (1 lb of ground meat). I didn't have the anise, so I added a 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning to the one pound of ground pork. To serve I sliced up 2 green bell peppers and 2 onions and tossed them with olive oil and salt and pepper roasted them in the oven @ 400 for 25 min. I browned the crumbled sausage in 2 tsp olive oil and added 1/2 jar of Emeril's maranaria sauce. Mixed in the peppers and onions and served on grilled hard rolls. Oh so yummy!!!!!! Thank you for the great recipe.

This was so easy to make.  The recipe was nice and flavorful and tasted just like sausage from the old neighborhood in Denver.  Personally, I will make it hotter next time.

I scaled this down for 1 lb pork. This was perfect for our pizza. It had great flavor, not really hot at all. Thanks Jim for sharing your friend's special recipe with us!

Followed the recipe but added additional ingredients (1 tbs garlic powder and 1/2 cup of water plus my measurements were a little heaping). This was based upon a 15 lb batch of pork. I must say I was impressed with the outcome!!

Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. I haven't made it yet, but am sure it will be great. During the years I was in Canada, hot italian sausage was one of my favorite foods that I have experienced there. After coming back to Korea, however, there is not such food in here sadly, perhaps I can buy it from the internet with a ridiculous price. (about 13-14 CAD per 300 grams) Now I can home-cook it thanks to your recipe. :)

I love this recipe as a sensible guideline!
As many others before me have mentioned, Vinny's tweaks make tasty sense!
This is my summer sausage burger recipe and my son and I chose this over burgers every time!

I made a pound of this last night  to go in a small batch of spaghetti sauce today.  Upon tasting, this morning, it is clear that this recipe doesn't have enough spices in it.  My sausage tastes good (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but it's way too mild.  Verry, very mild.

For Gods sake, don't make 20 pounds of this without tasting what it comes out like first, as it's not what most people think of as hot Italian sausage.

Not nearly enough spice for 20lbs. I doubled most and  tripled some, quadrupled red chili peppers and fennel....added onion salt....turned out pretty good, glad I read "vinnies" revue  and took his advise on adding lots more spice or I feel I would have wasted 20lbs. of pork.
Next time I will add and use cayenne in combination with pepper flakes.

We often make this 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef to use up the fattier pork.  I pare it down to a 5 lb recipe with measurements as follows: 2.5 lb lean beef, 2.5 lb fatty pork, 1 bulb of garlic, ground in with pork, 2 tablespoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, 2 tablespoons paprika, 1 tablespoon anise seeds, 2 tablespoons fennel seeds, 1 tablespoon hot pepper flakes.

I make an almost identical similar sausage to this.  Its delicious!   If you are not an absolute garlic lover, be very conservative with the amount you add.   TIP: Add bit by bit & pan fry little samples  as you go to fine tune to your taste.

I'm giving 4 stars just because it's not enough flavor .... (Or maybe I don't know if real Italian people don't like much fennel in their food?) 

20 pounds is WAY too much and not enough flavor and aroma ...  I made 1 pound of meat just to see how it goes and I "estimate" all the amount of  ingredients on my own since I pretty much know my own taste... 

1 pound  of self grounded pork shoulder  
1 teaspoon fennel seed (Fennel is pork best friend!!!) 
1/2 teaspoon anise seeds 
1 teaspoon black peppercorn 
1/2 teaspoon paprika (I don't like too much red color in my food) 
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (I like it spicy!) 
pinch of salt   

Came out delicious!!! Thank you for recipe :)

I don't like real spicy food . I scaled this down to eight servings and followed the directions. It turned out very bland. I I'd spice it up some more.

Not nearly enough spices---I had to almost double the amounts (I made only 1 1/4 lbs. meat, but adjusted the recipe accordingly), and I toasted both the anise and fennel seeds to bring out the best of them.  I'll try making this again in the warmer weather so I can grill the sausage.

Well.  I did a mashup of recipe plus reviewers and I'm glad I did.  I did about 4 pounds of ground pork.  My spice mix did the italian blend (my own), fennel, onion, garlic, black and red peppers, salt, avocado oil (i am out of olive).  It's quite delicious.  Basically doubled everything but the oil and salt for the reduced recipe.  And, as vinnie-bag-o-donuts says, fennel is pork's best friend.  Err on the generous side.

We made this sausage and it is very, very good! Better than most store bought bulk and very easy to make. We followed the recipe precisely with no deviations. We made meatballs, pizza toppings, mixed 50/50 with ground venison for meatloaf.. 20lbs did not last long in my house...

Edit- I'll add that we recently made a new batch but following vinnie-bag-of-doughnuts recommendation (basically doubled everything.) Also used hot paprika.. Much better! A little more 'oomph' to the sausage,

First time I made this I found it not spicy enough. This time I only used 10lbs. of pork and I used fresh garlic (instead of the garlic salt) and I added fresh parsley. Everything else I kept  the same. Turned out great   !!

Tasty meatballs, but for honest to goodness "Italian" meatballs from my old Italian neighborhood, you gotta have 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 pound pork, 1/2 pound ground veal. Add your spices of choice bake or fry them to get a nice crust then, Into the Gravy, to finish them off.

I tested this out on 1 LB of pork shoulder that I ground myself.
Needed more spice for my taste.  I  probably doubled the spices  called for  using 1 lb and used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  End result was amazing though, can't wait to make a larger batch.

I agree with Vinnie about the spice quantities. If my math is correct, the recipe calls for the following, for one pound: 1 1/4 t. paprika, 1/8 t. anise seed, 1/8 t. fennel seed, and 1/3 t. red pepper flakes.  I didn't have anise or red pepper flakes...never used anise, and usually sub Cajun or cayenne for the flakes. I like spicy but I'm a wimp on the heat level. For one pound, I used: 1/2 t. salt, 1/4 t. granulated garlic, 1/8 t. black pepper, 3/4 t. smoked Spanish paprika, 1 1/2 t. fennel seed, and a scant 1/4 t. cayenne.  Made Zuppa Toscana...pretty good. I'm glad to have this recipe for a guideline, but feel that using such small amounts of fennel and red pepper wouldn't be very flavorful, or hot, as per the recipe title = / ...

Like vinnie-bag-o-donuts, when I first looked at this I felt that there was not enough spices. I made it first (1 lb ground pork) as the recipe stated and felt it was lacking spices . I made it Vinnie's way and it did taste better, however there was WAY to much salt....  at least for me. 
Next time I will make it with less salt, but I will most definitely make it again.

This is my first attempt at making my own Italian sausage. I like my Italian sausage really hot so I put a lot more pepper flakes in it than were called for. My wife said it's too spicy for her. That's okay. More for me.

Nice flavor. Before you decide to rate this recipe or change it make sure to try it in it's original form.  All of the ingredients add distinctive flavor, including the paprika and the anise seed.  Using more fennel in place of using anise will not yield the same results as anise has its own distinct flavor. I chose to grind the spices in a coffee grinder I use specifically for spices.  That way I don't end up with a sudden burst of anise from one of the seeds and the flavors are distributed more uniformly.  After taste testing I decided to add more black pepper 1/2 tsp to 1 lb, and 1 Tbsp red pepper flakes to a pound.  I then also altered it by using 1 tsp fresh garlic and 1 tsp salt.  Garlic salt can vary greatly on the amount of garlic vs salt ratio and some have better flavoring than others.  Still if you are someone stating this recipe has no flavor it is likely because you are omitting ingredients.

We enjoyed this "Hot Italian Sausage," but it was quite mild for our taste (and certainly more like the mild Italian sausage at our local gourmet butcher shop and Italian grocery store). This may be because I reduced the servings to 8 for my family (perhaps not getting ideal ratios). I am also thinking that maybe I was supposed to use Spanish paprika (which is hot) instead of the more commonly available Hungarian paprika (which is mild). We like highly-seasoned food at our home (personal taste). If I were to make this recipe again, I would at least double up on the spices and use fresh garlic (personal taste). Thank you Jim Wyllie for sharing your recipe.

This was my second foray into making sausage, and I must say it was a massive success!  After I was done linking the sausages, I smoked it with hardwood chips in wine for a couple of hours (around 220F) and it took the most amazing turn!!!  It was a rodeo of flavor, and was the centerpiece of every dish it was in.

Good start but not enough spices.  I made (5 lbs) per the recipe and it was not spicy enough to match grocery store Italian hot sausage.  I added a heaping tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of dried habenero flakes and remixed and it tasted more like regular hot sausage.  The recipe calls for garlic salt but I used garlic powder and it was fine, perhaps better for less salt and more garlic. 

The recommendations for paprika,  salt, pepper, anise and fennel seed are spot on, I would never change those.  Just adjust the heat to your taste.

This is by far the leading recipe for Italian Sausage. I scaled it down to 20 servings, added a lot more fennel and a little more anise. Thank you Jim Wyllie for sharing.

Made this with soy crumbles in a lasagna.  My sister is vegetarian but I couldn't find any veggie Italian sausage. This was a great alternative.
