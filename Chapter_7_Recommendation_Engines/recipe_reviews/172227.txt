I've had cumin lassi's, and I was looking forward to making my first at home.  You need to love, love, L-O-V-E cumin to enjoy this.   It has so much cumin that it's the only thing that I could taste.  IMO it needs the cumin reduced significantly (maybe start with just 1 tsp or less) and perhaps add some mint or fresh cilantro as a complement to the cumin.  Sunaina, sorry for the bad review, but this recipe just didn't work for me.
