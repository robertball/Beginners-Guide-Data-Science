This is a great method.  I melted the butter in a microwave safe bowl with about a teaspoon of olive oil and a little minced garlic.  My head of cauliflower was pretty small, I tossed it with the melted butter and then onto a parchment lined baking sheet.   DELICIOUS and clean up was a breeze.  I have a confession..... I ate the whole thing myself!

Holy Cow!  I love roasted cauliflower anyway, using the usual olive oil.  The butter IS what is unusual about this  recipe and is the best cauliflower I've ever eaten.  Sure butter is less healthy but heck, it isn't that much.  I ate it like candy, even after it cooled off.  LOVED this!  Thanks Chef John!!

This was divine!  Never thought about adding butter.  I always use olive oil.  This time because I love garlic, I used 1 head of cauliflower and 1 head of brocolli and about 12 cloves chopped the garlic and stored it in 2 tbls of olive oil ill ready.  While the garlic was marinating, I chopped the vegetables.  Added 2 tbls of melted butter with the garlic mixture to the veggies and tossed with salt and pepper.  It was GREAT!!  Oh, it only needed 30 mins, added some grated parm and broiled for 2 min..yum! Yum!

You can't go wrong with simple roasted veggies.  As I've come to trust Chef John, I followed the recipe to a "T", and it was spot on.  THANKS for the recipe, Chef John!

Excellent! You made me look like a rock star in front of my new husband! Neither of us have ever had roasted cauliflower, so I thought I'd try out this recipe.
Not only was it simple and quick to prepare, but the end result made us both thrilled. The only thing I added was a sprinkling of 21 Seasoning Salute made by Trader Joe's. Thanks, Chef John!

Latest research is indicating it is not healthy to heat olive oil, so I was eager to try this recipe. I followed it to the "T". It was just okay for us. If you season it up with some spices, I think it could be a 4-5 star recipe. As written, it is simply too plain. I usually add garlic, onion and then either basil or thyme when I roast veggies. I missed not having the extra flavors. I think next time I will put crushed garlic in the butter and heat it on low for awhile before brushing it on the cauliflower. Cooking time was spot on!! Worth a try with adjustments you think would appeal to you.

Butter Roasted Cauliflower Haiku: "Simple, roasted vegg. (But it's not 'unusual', just nice and easy.") Not sure why CJ would say this is an unusual method for roasting cauliflower, or any vegg for that matter, but hey, I followed his foolproof directions and the only thing that I found it benefited from at serving was a small sprinkle of parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper, otherwise, we liked this side dish quite a bit.

I added 4 fresh garlic cloves chopped fine to the butter before I briushed it on the cauliflower...it turned out great! I also used a whole stick of butter...Everything's better with butter...I used kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. Very tasty. Definately a keeper.

This is an easy and tasty way to eat vegetables, especially for those not especially fond of them.  I usually use a medley of veggies... cauliflower, Broccoli, Carrots.  Rather than use butter, I put my veggies in a plastic bag, pour in some olive oil, salt and pepper, shake a bit to cover all the veggies and then bake.  Love the color and the healthy aspects of olive oil.

My family loves this recipe, and I make it often! The only change I made was to melt the butter in a large glass bowl, put the cauliflower in on top of it, and toss well. The pieces were evenly coated and it was easier than brushing the butter on. After I spread them on the foil I sprinkle just a bit of fine salt on top. I love the natural flavor of the cauliflower and butter and I let it shine through.

Great basic grilled veggie recipe. I use this recipe to roast broccoli, carrots, brussel sprouts, etc. I do mix the butter with some olive oil. You can roast all of them at the same time by just adding the veggies to the baking sheet that require a shorter period of roasting time. A great spice for any of these veggies is Weber's Veggie Grill. It's all you need for seasoning.

The video is like a silent movie in color...w/ subtitles. Must be early Chef John...whom I love. I find it lacks seasoning as written. Personally I do add some Olive oil. I also use any seasonings I want. Certainly needs any form of garlic, onion powder is good...what do you like? I might add some Poblano's in there to roast as well. I made what I call "Cruciferousfest" for a small live music picnic type party: Cauliflower, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, Daikon Radish and Bok Choy (all cruciferous). Drizzled it w/ reduced Balsamic Vinegar. Went over well...no leftovers to take home.

Because I had it on hand I used butter which I had previously clarified. (Ohhhh, yeaaah, good!) I used purple cauliflower, so the presentation was quite different! It turned almost black from the roasting process - unfortunately.  I really liked this - the ends of the florets were a little crispy, contrasting with the more meaty parts of the cauliflower. Unfortunately, this preparation did not change Hubs' unfavorable opinion of cauliflower.

This is the best way to make Cauliflower.  I have made this dish several times, once in a while I add and saute chopped garlic in the butter, and other times its red pepper flakes in the butter with a little cumin.

Quick & easy and oh so good.  One change: I sprinkled shredded parmesan cheese at the very end to melt on top of the cauliflower.  Added that extra bang. This will be a regular side dish at my house.

Love  this recipe! Of course you can put other spices on but I love it just as is! I cook this on a regular basis, but not as often as I'd like to . I could seriously eat this at least once a week. Thank you for a very simple but very tasty recipe Chef John!

The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I don't really like cauliflower but I ate a lot of it because it actually tasted really good cooked this way---exactly as written.

I loved this.  I prefer to have the plain taste of the vegetable to come through especially with cauliflower.  The only thing to do different next time is turn it after 20 minutes and then again after 10 minutes then cook an additional 10 minutes like the recipe suggests.  It may be better to be more evenly charred - I loved it just the same.  I'm glad someone else is using butter instead of olive oil all the time.  Thanks Chef John.

I roast almost all my vegetables. I use a 400 convection or a 425 regular.  No need for butter, olive oil is terrific.  You can also add a little bread crumb and Parmesan cheese. I also use powdered garlic and onion so it doesn't burn. Delicious!

I used this recipe as a base for unbattered "Buffalo Cauliflower" and it was perfect.  I used a bit more butter and also 2 cloves of chopped garlic.   After it came out of the oven, I mixed up 1/3 cup of Franks Red Hot Sauce with a few TBS of melted butter and poured it over the cauliflower.  Served with a side of blue cheese dip.   3 adults finished off a whole head of cauliflower and wished there was more!  My husband says he's running out to buy more cauliflower today.

Easy, excellent.  This the first time I've added butter; always used just olive oil but the addition with the garlic  was great.  Rather than brush the cauliflower I put it in a ziploc bag with the butter, oil and garlic and shook well, then added the salt and pepper after putting on the pan.  Keeper!!

Used more butter to cover all pieces and sprinkled with garlic salt... Oh my!!!  Delish!!!

Broke into small pieces so would bake faster.   Dont worry if they start to get a little black, they actually taste the best that way!! NOT Burnt tasting at all!  My husband and I eat the entire head ourselves and just cant stop eating it!!!  PS-I dislike cauliflower, but LOVE this recipe!!

A good simple way to make cauliflower, but watch the baking time carefully.  After 20 minutes, I turned mine and they only needed 10 more minutes after that.  Be sure to add plenty of salt or just use salted butter.  Next time I'll try adding garlic to the butter to make them even tastier.

This was really good.  I melted a little more butter than called for in a large bowl, then added the cauliflower and S&P and tossed till coated.  I also lined my cookie sheet with foil which was great for cleanup!

Yes, I made it! OUTSTANDING! I only tweaked it a lil.... I added a few shakes of Grated Asiago & Romano Parmesan Chese and a few shakes of Garlic Powder. FANTASTIC!
My Hubby Loved it, and he's snoopy.
Thanks for the Great Recipe.

Roasting the cauliflower gives it a decidedly different taste. It's so good! I had a head of Romanescu cauliflower so that's what I used and followed the recipe exactly. I cooked it only 20 minutes and it was perfect. FYI, you can roast brussels sprouts the same way and with a delicious result.

Wow!  I've always liked cauliflower okay, but preferred it with a cheese sauce.  Now this may be the only way I'll ever make it again.  I admit I tweaked a tiny bit, but just because of personal taste.  I'm trying to cut my butter intake, so I used avocado oil because it has a buttery taste but is healthier.  And I added a few shakes of granulated garlic.  Cooked until nice and brownish.  So fabulous!  Everyone at the table loved it!

I have been making roasted cauliflower for over a year now but I only use EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) now I will add butter sounds divine.  Everything is better with butter.  My husband and I fight over the last piece. And to think it can taste better than it does now!!!

These were delicious, but 30 minutes was too long in my oven. I set the timer for 20 minutes and they were already very dark (but not yet burnt) on the bottom. Next time I made them (a few days later), at 15 minutes they were just starting to get golden brown and I turned them for 10 minutes more.

Loved this but tweaked it a little.  Added minced fresh garlic to the butter and brushed it on.  At the last 10 minutes, I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  Was so good and easy! Everyone loved it and wanted more.

I have always used olive oil to roast cauliflower and I like that but this was very, very good!! Easy as well. I melted the butter in a microwave safe bowl and then I added the cauliflower florets and mixed well. I placed the cauliflower on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil and added the salt, pepper and a sprinkle of paprika. I cooked it according to the instructions and it was perfect. I could have made a meal out of the cauliflower alone! Delicious.

Excellent cauliflower side dish ! the children also love it and ask for seconds all the time. You need to keep an eye on it, in the oven the last 5 minutes of baking, on the 1st side. Sometimes the pieces of cauliflower brown faster than other times ..

As written it takes WAY too long to cook.  I wrapped the head of cauliflower in chef-grade saran wrap and put it in the microwave for 10 minutes on high.  It was soft when I unwrapped it and I chopped it into florets.  I poured melted butter over it with some garlic and a few turns from the pepper mill and some parmesan cheese,  I spread it out on the pan roasted it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and it was perfect---way quicker than the 45 minutes the recipe calls for, so I highly recommend whacking it in the nuker to pre-cook if you are under the gun to get dinner on the table.  I do this to all my fresh veggie dishes, cuts cooking time WAY down.

I don't like cauliflower and neither do my kids. They complained when they saw me cooking this. But the cauliflower arrived in our CSA so I tried this recipe (I've tried many!). Everyone devoured this. There was not a bite left. So glad to finally find a recipe everyone likes. I added penzys sandwich sprinkle spice to the butter.

Awesome and so simple! My hubby  loves steamed cauliflower, and snurled his nose when I told him I was roasting it last night...until he tasted it. He ate the entire pan! I got one small bite and I agree it was delicious! I made it just as written...thanks, Chef John!

I thought this recipe was great for my kids. I did add about 3/4 tsp. of garlic powder, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was nice to just let it roast while I prepared the other parts of the meal.

This was like eating candy. My whole family loved it. I was surprised that 2 T of butter covered a whole head but it did.

I will definitely make this again.  Lightly brush with butter though, I used too much was worried at the high temp it might scorch.  A definite keeper!

I used garlic salt, pepper and crushed rosemary.  I've roasted many vegs but never thought of roasting cauliflower for some reason.   This is a nice prep method, it mellows out the flavor.  My kids enjoyed it, too.

I think this is the best cauliflower I have ever tasted! I  used a little more than 2 tablespoons of butter, and browned it at the end under the broiler. So delicious. I think this recipe will lead to us eating more cauliflower.

OMG this is good.  Better than any cheese you could put on the cauliflower. The butter is infused into the cauliflower.

So simple and so good... I added some fine chopped garlic, and pre cooked the califlower in the microwave for 4 minutes prior to putting in the oven to speed up the cooking.... Great texture, Great taste!

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly except for the glaze. I substituted the white sugar with confectioners sugar.   I took the bread out of the oven after 50 minutes and brushed the glaze on.  Put it back in for 10 more minutes.   It was done so I removed it and sat it on a cooling rack.  After 10 minutes I glazed it again.  I had never used a glaze before (always a frosting) so I was afraid when I saw how runny it was.  But, after it cooled it had a beautiful glaze to it and almost a tad crunchy.  Be sure to cover it and refrigerate it.  It tasted more delicious and flavorful after it was cold.

Simple recipe, paint with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Or just experiment, Tony Cashera’s, seasoned salt, Durkee’s Hot Sauce, etc.  Tasty and low cal.

Basically, I made it exactly like the recipe except I added some herbs.  I have this blend of oregano, basil, and tomato by The Gourmet Collection that I use in soups and on vegetables.  These cauliflower bites were delicious.  My husband, who dislikes cauliflower was munching away on them.  Thank you

Sorry did it with olive oil.  Next time as I read the reviews I would do it with butter.  I did cut each of the flowers by them selves.  This worked for 40 mins. at 335 degrees.  Enjoy!!!!

I make this slightly differently.  I pour melted butter in the bottom of the whole cauliflower head,  that has been refrigerated so it doesn't run out.  I turn it over and rub softened butter all over it.  I put it in my dutch oven.  I add some carrots chopped to the size of baby carrots, and pour a little melted butter over them.  Bake at 425 for approximately 45 minutes.  Awesome!!

It was great!   I didn’t change a thing.  Only thing I did different is the way I buttered the chicken.  I’m lazy.  I melted it in a pot then tossed the Cauliflower in the pot.  Quick and easy and full coverage. Tasty.  I want to try it in my Air fryer next time

Modification to our tastes:
Replace 1/2 of the butter with olive oil
Cut amount of garlic in half
Oven roast until edges are brown and slightly crispy or grill

Added a little garlic powder to butter and 1/4 cup water to bottom of dish.  Make sure you stir a few times. It helps to cook more evenly.

Simple and tasty! This is a great recipe for cauliflower and a good base for any roasted veggies.  I add whatever vegetables I have in the refrigerator.

I had a large head of cauliflower so used 1 stick of butter (the more butter the better for us).  I roasted for 30 minutes, turned them then put them back in the oven.  I took them out before the last 10 minutes were up because they looked like they were starting to burn.  The smaller pieces came out crispy.  I  did not use salt due to dietary restrictions.  It was good, will make this again.

A great new way to serve cauliflower. Instead of brushing on the melted butter, I just put the cauliflower pieces in a large bowl, poured the melted butter over top and tossed, then added the salt and pepper.  I baked them on parchment paper. I'm not sure the extra 10 min. of baking is really necessary...will just do them for 30 min next time.

Love this recipe! I sprinkle grated Parmesan or Cheddar Jack and it's sooo good! Even my carnivorous husband likes it. Great with a cheese or spinach dip when leftover. Bravo!

I didn't have a baking sheet so used aluminum foil and shouldn't have baked it that long. I'll make it again but make sure it's for less time or use a baking sheet. Taste was awesome!

Followed the recipe exactly - except I needed a little more butter. Roasted nicely and had a great sweet-ish flavor. Will definitely make this again. I usually steam my cauliflower and add butter, salt and pepper after it's done - but the flavor came out different with roasting. Yummy keeper!

Not a bad cooking method - the cauliflower turned out tender and buttery,  though I like to add more than just salt and/or pepper. I tried two preparations, and both took the same time thankfully - the first was the standard recipe but with a little sprinkling of garlic salt, Red Robin seasoning (seasoned salt with some added spices) and Italian seasoning. The second pan had the same as the first, but a little bit of lemon pepper seasoning and a light sprinkling of feta cheese. Both of them came out rather tasty!

Yes and yes.  I like Cauliflower but lighting the oven when the heat index in July is 105 doesn't sound appealing.  Like many oven recipes, this on can be done on top of the stove.  Use a non-stick and cast iron pot.  Then follow the recipe. I like the idea of adding a little minced garlic and lots of chopped onion.

I used Earth Balance Coconut Spread in lieu of butter, and added minced garlic. Served over Mediterranean Quinoa with  glass of Pinot Grigio. Delish.

I've made this a few times and have enjoyed it.  I like using a plastic bag to toss everything then put it on the cooking stone. Tip: don't use the bag the cauliflower comes in,  since it has holes :)

Outstanding recipe!  Our guests loved it. I added a very small amount of minced garlic as  I melted the butter and and just before serving, I used some shaved Parmesan as more of a garnish than an ingredient. Next time, I'll try adding the parm for the last few minutes of baking.  But with or without garlic and cheese, this will be a staple when we're entertaining. Sooo good!  Thanks, Chef John!

This was really good. As I was short on time, I popped it under the broiler on high in a roasting pan, and keeping an eye on them and turning them, cut the time in half. I also served it with a bowl of curry powder on the table for dusting and it was delicious that way too.

I eat a lot of veggies but for some reason I have never roasted cauliflower before. I made this tonight for dinner and it was good. I did mix both butter and olive oil together and added garlic to it.  If you don't care for cauliflower I doubt this recipe will change that but it is another good way to prepare it.

I added some smoked paprika as well, which enhanced the flavor.  I also sprinkled some parm cheese on top after I turned the cauliflower .  I will definitely make it again!

Good and handy to cook with the meat in the oven (chicken cordon-bleu in my case). Only 4 stars because I found the cauliflower florets still a bit too crunchy - should need a longer cooking and maybe some kind of a spice (old Bay type) on top.

The description stated that this was an "unusual" way to make roasted cauliflower so I was intrigued and thought there would be some ingredient(s) to make it different. Rather disappointed because I have been making cauliflower like this for years!! Description is deceiving.  Like other comments, I usually add the garlic and at times have left the head whole rather than breaking into florets. Excellent recipe, just not unusual.

Excellent and a different taste - even better - than when I coat them with olive oil and roast. Watched the video and did this as described, including the silicone baking mat, brush for the butter, and turning after 30 minutes. Super simple and delicious recipe for cauliflower! This one's a keeper.

Added a bit of garlic, too.  We usually do olive oil for roasting veggies, so switching the butter wasn't a huge change. But it went over pretty well. I'll make it again, with the garlic!

Quick, easy, and INCREDIBLY tasty!  Definitely will make again.  Husband said it tasted "like nothing" - but he isn't a veggie person.  I thought it tasted like buttery, salted goodness.

I followed the recipe but  used frozen cauliflower and instead of salt and pepper I used Cajun seasoning and pepper.  Very very good. I will definitely make it again. And normally don't like cauliflower.
