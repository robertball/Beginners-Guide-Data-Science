This is almost exactly like my recipe, except I cook the onions WITH the mushrooms and then puree the entire mixture for about 10 minutes until it's completely liquified. I add this back to the turkey broth/chicken bullion mixture once it's thickened with flour. Add about 1/4 cup of white wine. Result? No chunks, just nice, smooth gravy with tons of mushroom flavor released due to the puree.

I am typically gravy challenged but this worked great for me. I didn't have as much celery on hand as the recipe called for which was a bummer but it was still mighty tasty. The only thing I did differently is that I chose to leave some of my mushroom slices whole instead of chopping them all. This is really good and will be my go to for turkey gravy. Don't forget that you can scale down the serving size when making smaller meals.

I couldn't get the color in the roux so the whole gravy was the wrong color. There was just way to much mushroom. I does taste good and I hope my guests at thanksgiving can over look the visual and enjoy the flavor.

I didn't put in the onions or celery (although I did have onions and celery in my turkey stock). Instead of chicken stock, I used sweet potato water and potato water.  I forgot to add the cayenne and wish I had but it was still amazing gravy.
