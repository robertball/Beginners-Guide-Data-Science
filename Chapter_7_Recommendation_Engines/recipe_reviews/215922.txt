I tried this recipe for it's simplicity.  The cream cheese is wonderful for some lasagna lovers who aren't big ricotta fans.  I will definitely make it again, but will play with some other herbs and garlic as another review suggested, but it is a great base recipe to begin with.  Thanks, Caroline!

I don't usually look at recipes that have not been rated, but this one I did and I'm glad I did.  Rich and yummy.  I changed a few things though.  First I used ground chicken (1 lb) and browned it, added a little water and simmered in some onions, broccoli and carrots along with 4 or 5 cloves of garlic.  I added the broth and the cream cheese right into the frying pan, mixing it in well before layering it in the lasagna.  Probably used more cheese than it called for, but I made a large pan.  Added an extra layer of noodles.  Would have added even more veggies but with 3 picky teenagers that wouldn't fly.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe but substituted Daves Gourmet Butternut Squash Pasta Sauce for the Tomato and Basil Sauce and it was delicious!

I made this recipe with no changes and found it very bland and boring.  I won't make it again.

I liked the idea of using cream cheese b/c I hate, hate, hate ricotta, and it was good; I wouldn't say great. I know lasagna shouldn't be crunchy, but with the shredded chicken, it was all sort of 'smooshy'. I think the cream cheese would be better w/ground beef/pork or ground turkey.

Delish! I had to use 3 more lasagna noodles, though. I thought there was just enough sauce and my husband loved it!

Not a bad meal.  I used about half of a left-over rotisserie chicken, and it worked great.  I added Italian seasoning and one clove of garlic to the chicken/cream cheese mixture.

I saved time by using half of a Costco rotisserie chicken. (Didn't have to use Bouillon.) Added some green onions and it was super quick and easy. Surprisingly good since that particular sauce isn't my favorite of Classico.

Really enjoyed this recipe, as did the husband. I added spinach to the sauce (which I warmed up prior) , used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and added a lot of garlic and other Italian spices and more motz cheese to the chicken mixture. I also did 9 noodles adding an extra layer, there was plenty of sauce! Very tasty and will make again soon.

I made this the other night and my family loved it.  My step daughters actually had it as a snack while watching a movie later that evening.  (Here that was supposed to be lunch the next day.)

Very, very good.  I used Costco rotisserie chicken and a couple links of turkey Italian sausage for this recipe. Browned onion and a couple cloves of garlic and added to sauce. Followed the recipe otherwise. Will definitely be making again and again.

This was very good!  I added roasted minced garlic(jarred) and Italian Seasoning to the bullion broth as others had mentioned.  I put half the Classico sauce in with the cheese and chicken mixture, but wish I would have left it as a layer instead.  The color of the mixture turns rather undesirable.  It wasn't that noticable since I added the sauce on the top noodle layer followed by the mzx.  The kids all liked it and so did the hubby.  I will definitely make this again.  I served it with garlic toast and a side spinach - strawberry salad - nice week night dinner!

I added some onion to the sauce and a bunch of  Italian spices, salt and pepper to the chicken. Not enough Mozzarella on hand during this Covid19 issue so I added sliced Provolone. This is a keeper, thanks for the idea
