I have always done the same thing with cubed steaks, brown then pour cream of mushroom soup over it with a little milk, onion and garlic salt and bake. I wanted to try something different and found this recipe. It turned out VERY delicious! I didn't have saltines so I used wheat ritz and I did add some pepper and garlic salt to the flour and cracker mixture. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect! Will definitely be making this again!

I am not a good cook but I tried this last week and it was awesome!!  Finally made gravy that was more than enough in quantity, and tasted great!  Normally I only like brown gravy but this was really good.  I did saute a ton of onions for the gravy which made it extra good!!  I am making it again tonight :)  p.s. forgot to say, I omitted the saltines, just used flour to coat.  I tried it once with the saltines but it was too thick - better without.

The gravy had no flavor, steak had no spice recommendations and tasted very oily.

Perhaps I ignored the red flags when looking at the ingredients.  There wasn't anything in the way of pizazz to signal it would be anything but bland, so my fault for expectations.  Perhaps it is a true country style flavor, I just never realized that meant it didn't have a lot of it.  Not sure why so many high ratings.   My guy, who eats everything and isn't picky, didn't even finish his.  I did finish it, as I didn't want my efforts to go to waste.  Not horrible, just not much of anything.

This was delicious. The only changes I made was to cut the recipe in half since I only had 3 steaks to prepare. I will be making this again!

This was very good and very easy.  Our cube steak was tough, but that's not the recipe's fault.  Made country gravy from a package.  Quicker that way.

I made this just like it was written and my family loved it! Thank you for sharing. The only thing I did differently, was I used Venison cube steak.
