I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil. That was the only change I made. I dropped these into greased muffin tins instead of messing with cutting them so they wouldn't have a chance to turn out tough.  These turned out so good--flaky and really just........YUMMY.

I have been making biscuits by this recipe since I was in elementary school and it works every time if you do it right! You need to use SELF-RISING, SOFT WHEAT flour, which is not as commonly available elsewhere as it is in the South. Good brands are White Lily or Hudson Cream -- NOT a hard wheat flour like Pillsbury,

Great recipe, especially when you need something in a pinch! I added a tsp. of garlic powder and used melted butter vs. veg oil cutting the amount in half. I baked these in muffin cups lined with paper liners sprayed with a little Pam which made things a lot easier!

The flavor wasn't bad.  Maybe I rolled them too flat or cooked them to long, but they were flat and hard.  I called them brick biscuits when I served them.  I like the other mayonnaise buscuits on this site much better. These also take three times the time to prepare and also makes three times the mess.  I will not make again.

I also agree with others, this reminds me of the biscuits my sister, grandmother and a great-grandmother used to make----but, the mayo is an addition and must make the difference as I could never get them to turn out like this recipe.  Hoorah!!

These biscuits were hard to mess up, in my opinion.  The dough was easy to mix together and the biscuits came out soft and delicious. I did make my own self-rising flour by adding 1 tsp salt and 3 tsp baking powder to all-purpose flour.  I also used an olive oil mayonnaise.  Neither of those things detracted from the final product. Mine cooked a little faster than the 20 minutes.  I have a convection oven and 16 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect.  Thanks for introducing me to this "new" way of making biscuits.

These were good, but I'd really hoped for a lighter, fluffier biscuit. They were a little on the dense side, but had good flavor. These were a nice addition to our chicken dinner.

This is a very good biscuit.  The flavor is excellent, it is easy to make, takes very little time, and if it has a flaw it is that they did not rise quite as much as I would like...which may improve as I make them again.  thank you for sharing this great biscuit recipe.  First good scratch biscuits I have made.

I have just found my new biscuit recipe.  I love that it does not require all the shortening, will be a lot cheaper on my budget I think especially since it requires ingredients that I always keep on hand.  The only change I did was to make my own buttermilk b/c I was out of my normal dry buttermilk that I keep on hand.  I just took 1 cup of whole milk added 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar and allowed it to site 5-10 minutes.  I definitely recommend this recipe.  For previous reviews that stated the biscuits were hard I would suggest not playing with your dough too much.  I put mine on a floured surface and did not roll I just used my hands to pat the dough 1/2 inch thick.  My biscuits turned out fluffy and yummy.  My family loved them there were none left.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

Super simple and very good. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a little over a teaspoon of vinegar to sour the milk.

Absolutely delicious. However, I couldn't get the tops of mine to brown at all. I cut them out with a mason jar lid and put them in a small round cake pan instead of cast iron. I had them on the top rack and took them out after only about 10 mins to avoid burning the bottom. They cooked much faster than 20 mins at only 400°, and the bottom was golden but tops were pure white, so not great looking presentation-wise, but the texture inside was perfect! Moist and soft and chewy, not crumbly. I used 2 tbs of olive oil and like I said, delicious! Will try butter next time just for curiosity's sake.

This is a great recipe to use when you don't have much time, no kneading or rolling required!  I followed the recipe, even used my cast-iron, and thought they were very delicious.  I followed the advice of one of the other viewers and use a flour other than Pillsbury, and spread some softened, salted butter on the tops before baking.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Used butter instead of oil. Tried not to handle the dough too much, but the still came out a bit hard. I'll try patting them out then doubling them over before cutting next time. Quick and easy recipe.

These biscuits turned out well -- though for my oven, 20 minutes was much too long. They were ready in about 13 minutes. Also I think they needed a little salt. But the texture was great!

The flavor is good, making them is SO easy. However, I made them twice in a row because the first time they were dense and flat.
The first time I followed the recipe but I rolled them and overworked them. They came out good to eat but could be used as a weapon half an hour later lol
I am determined to impress my husband with biscuits so I made them again. haha 
The second time I added a couple of pinches of baking powder hoping it would help them rise, I patted them instead of rolling and left them about an inch high before cutting them out. I also added butter to the top before baking. They turned out a little higher and fluffier.
I will repeat it the second way in the future and keep working at this until I get a presentable biscuit lol
Thanks for the super simple recipe. Both batches were yummy with butter and honey drizzle. But butter and honey drizzle cover a host of oopsies :-D
