I thought this dish tasted a lot like a well-made chicken caesar salad. I did make a few modifications: used more heat resistant shredded spinach instead of lettuce and used only enough caesar dressing to coat (but not drown) the other ingredients. I was even able to eat it for lunch the next day!

this was a great recipe. i used spinach instead of the lettuce and added bell peppers (yellow and red) for more color and to add some extra vegtables. It turned out great!

I almost didn't rate this recipe since I altered it quite a bit, but I thought it might show the versatility of this yummy simple dish.  Rather than butter, I sauteed the chicken cubes in a dash of EVOO and minced garlic.  I tossed the pasta and chicken w/tomato and fresh baby spinach, and used Good Season Greek dressing to mix w/the red wine vinegar and parmesan cheese.  I also tossed the complete mixture w/a handful of shredded italian blend cheese.  This was great!  I'm looking forward to trying it Ceasar style soon.  Thanks for a great weeknight staple!

I would say this recipe is definitley very good but not 5 star worthy. Not sure why but it is just good. I can't stomach hot lettuce though so both times I have made it I cook the pasta and chicken and then chill them before adding them to the lettuce.
It is pretty good though as I have made it multiple times!

Excellent. This has become my most requested recipe when I attend family gatherings. I use Renee's caesar salad dressing with half a cup of parmesan added to it. I add garlic to the chicken while it is cooking. As well, if you don't mix the dressing in, this salad can keep for a few days in the fridge. Thanks for the new twist on an old classic.

The first time I made this, my boyfriend ate the entire salad himself over a course of 1 1/2 days. The 2nd time I made it, he ate the entire thing within ONE day! I didn't even get a bite! This recipe makes a VERY generous amount also! He claims to some extent that the salad is better than having intercourse, which is pretty amazing! The salad tastes better when it's chilled giving time for the cooked chicken to chill also. For those people who don't know what to add to what, I just dump the lettuce, paste, chicken and dressing in all together and mix the entire thing. This has definately become "the salad to make" at my house. It's a hit with other family members also!

Two large chicken breasts was plenty for this recipe. I did lightly season the chicken with Johnny's Caesar Garlic Spread before browning it in the butter. I did have to add a little EVOO with the butter to prevent the chicken from scorching. The salad dressing I used was Newman's. My family seemed to enjoy it. Both my husband and oldest son thought it needed more tomato. This is a "make again" recipe.

I make a very similar recipe and love it.  The only difference is that I use Linguine noodles, add capers and avocado. YUM!

Very good with a few changes.  I used leftover chicken (marinade for chicken recipe) and cooled the pasta prior to adding to salad.  Also, used pre-packaged salad and cherry tomatoes to make life simple.  It was all thrown together in a snap.  My 5 year old asked for seconds. I served it with crusty bread and, all-in-all, was a very fulfilling meal.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a super good ridiculously easy recipe!! It was enjoyed by my entire family and a couple of co workers. I used Lighthouse Cesar dressing and only had a Italian salad mix on hand so thats what I used. Will certainly make this one again after a long day!

Cut the pasta in half, or double everything else.  Needs some seasoning, it was a bit bland.  After some tweaking, pretty good.

This was so good!  Of course I made some changes, however.  Instead of cooking the chicken in a skillet, I marinated it in some of the Caesar dressing for an hour and then grilled it on my GF grill - tasted great!  Instead of romaine, I used a sack of spinach leaves and I had to leave out the tomato because they're just disgusting at this time of year.  I added a bag of Italian 4-cheese blend of shredded cheese.  This made a TON - I made sure to keep the dressing separate so I can eat this for lunch all week.  I shook up the dressing, vinegar and parmesan in a cleaned peanut butter jar with a lid, and that's what I'm using to store the leftover in the fridge this week.  Even the hubs loved this - thanks!

I made some changes based on personal preference; I omitted the lettuce and served the pasta/chicken mixture on a bed of fresh baby spinach.  I also subbed chopped red pepper for the tomatoes, b/c I don't like them.  I only had two chicken breast halves, so I halved the dressing mixture.  It still made a large amount, with leftovers for tomorrow.  (I refrigerated the pasta separate from the spinach so it won't get soggy).  Dh and I both give this a big thumbs up, and it's so easy.  If you like chicken caesar salad, give this a try!  Thanks for the recipe.

I actually used this recipe as a base for a pasta salad. After cooking the pasta I rinsed it under cold water.  I added a diced tomato, coarsely chopped broccoli, and canned peas.  I mixed in the dressing, red wine vinegar,parmasean cheese, and seasoned with salt and pepper.  I left out the chicken and the lettuce.  After chilling for a few hours, I took it to a BBQ and there was only about a spoonful left by the end of the day!  It turned out great! It does make quite a bit though!

This recipe was very simple to make and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  I omitted the tomatoes though.  I served the dressing on the side, as well as the croutons and parmesan cheese to avoid making it soggy just in case we had leftovers.  I also used the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken to avoid time constraints. I have made this recipe several times and will continue to keep making it.

I wasn't sure if I should give this 3 or 4 stars.  I went with 3 because this really tastes much better the 2nd day, and served cold.  It was OK warm.  I left out the lettuce because it seemed weird in a warm pasta dish.  Otherwise made as written.  As I said, the leftovers the next day, served cold, were much better!

Very good and actually light tasting. I prefer it room temp to even slightly chilled. Make sure the noodles cool before pouring them on top of the lettuce! This will keep it nice and crisp.

Okay, I read all of the reviews about this recipe.  I dont get how you can rate a recipe that you completely changed and then call it "not all that great."  That sort of bugs me a little bit.  Anyways, with that being said I really enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for something quick, easy and yummy.  From start to finish this dish took me like 20 minutes and my family loved it.  I thought it was a little weird to be adding hot pasta to lettuce so I must admit I did change that a little.  I did'nt mix all of the ingredients together like the recipe said too. I mixed the caesar dressing with the cooked chicken and pasta then I served it over lettuce with the croutons and parmesan cheese.  I used a good quality caesar dressing because I think that makes a HUGE difference and I also think the red wine vinegar gave it another really good flavor. I was so happy with the end result.  My husband thinks it could have used a little more sauce but he is a sauce man and I thought it was great the way it was.    He still scraped his plate clean. This recipe was Quick, Easy & a hit with my family.  I will definatly make it again. YUM. Thanks for the great recipe.

my family thought this was great. I used a ready to go roasted chicken from my grocery store and just separated the chicken...(faster and cheaper than buying and cooking chicken breasts). I knew ahead of time there would be leftovers so i mixed the pasta and chicken together with the dressing, let it cool in fridge until dinner and just put a bed of romaine on everyones plate......it worked out great

This was so delicious! Easy to put together, and if you enjoy Caesar salad, your sure to love this recipe. It makes a big salad, so I sent some over to my sister, and she called almost immediately to ask for the recipe. It's a keeper!

I liked this recipe very much, although I used leftover chicken breast and put some crisp bacon bits in it.  I cooled down the pasta and chicken before I added it to the lettuce.  This will become a regular part of our menu.

This was ok.  I served the pasta and chicken chilled, but my husband and I still didn't like the lettuce with the pasta; too wierd for us, I guess.  My two kids loved it, though!  I would make this again, leaving out the lettuce, and maybe adding some red bell pepper for a little crunch and variety.

I really enjoyed this. A very quick and easy meal when you don't feel much like cooking or dirtying too many dishes. I subbed shrimp for the chicken and made sure to use cracked pepper and shredded  asiago to freshen it up a bit. Great use for older lettuce.

This recipe was AWESOME and very easy!  My boyfriend gave it 10 out of 10 stars. I did do a few minor changes though:  I marinated the chicken in Wishbone's Italian dressing for 3 days before cooking it.  Instead of grated parmesan cheese, I used the shredded parm cheese that comes in a bag.  And instead of caesar dressing, I used homemade italian dressing that I purchased from my neighborhood pizzeria.  I also used romaine salad in a bag instead of a head of lettuce.  Bon appetit!

This would've been a 4 star for me if I'd cut the vinegar. It seemed too over powering- jmho. That being said, I had unexpected teenage company and was able to whip this up to feed 8 people in under 15 minutes with pre-packaged chicken. I also used baby spinach instead of lettuce and chilled the pasta a bit before serving.

An upgraded caesar salad.  Very good, but not off the chart.  I suggest chilling the pasta first as others have mentioned.

This was very good.  The only thing I would change is to add more veggies to the mix.  I also just used the "Louis Rich" grilled chicken slices from the store to save time.  My guests couldn't get enough!

Delicious Caesar salad that we all enjoyed.  We had company at the lake and roasted a whole chicken.  The salad was a great dish to go with it.  In fact, we liked it so well, and I had leftover pasta, we had it again the second day for lunch.  Very quick and easy to put together.  This makes for a very nice summer time meal.  Usually I would make homemade Caesar dressing, but the quickness and ease, since we were on vacation and had company, I used a store bought bottle.

I liked this recipe but had to tweek slightly with less vinegar, and ceasar dressing,I only used enough dressing to coat lightly also omitted the lettuce and added spinach and red pepers to hold up to the heat. Otherwise it was great and my family devoured it.

I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this recipe. I wasn't too sure about the lettuce with the pasta, but it was brilliant! I hate red wine vinegar, so I subbed with White Balsamic - it was soooo good, I could have eaten the dressing on its own! I found it was missing something though ...  which I think might have been bacon. Next time I try this, and I will try it again, I will add some crumbled bacon to the pasta to see. Thanks for posting!

Absolutely delish!  I wasn't sure how the lettuce would be with the pasta but it added a nice crunch to the mix and a good little extra flavor.  I ended up using balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine due to not having any red wine vinegar and it was a tasty exchange.  I will definitely be making this one again! :)

This was great. I made it with cold pasta and chicken, because I thought the heat would be too weird on the lettuce. Chopped up the romaine and mixed it all together, and it was delicious!

This was delicious.  I added frozen (thawed) peas instead of the lettuce. Other than that I stuck to the recipe.  I will make this again and it would also be very easy to add lots of other ingredients (like feta cheese) and taste like a different salad all together. All of my picky eaters enjoyed it!

We LOVED this recipe. I used whole wheat penne pasta which made it pretty filling.  I also used spinach instead of romaine lettuce AND added green peppers. It was VERY tasty. Of course, I'm a big fan of ceasar salad anything.

Easy and flavorful quick dinner.  I used a whole, cooked chicken from the deli to save time and skipped the lettuce/tomato.  This would also be good with canned tuna I think.

Very good.  I was a little hesitant at first to add the lettuce, but it was a nice touch.  I chilled my pasta before serving.  The only other change I made was the manner of cooking the chicken.  I poached the chicken in chicken broth and Garlic & Herb Mrs. Dash.  Overall, this was an excellent recipe that will become a regular in the meal rotation.

This was so yummy.  Made it ahead of time to be served cold for a camping trip.  Had it all mixed up and just added some croutons on top when we served it.  The only changes I made was to leave out the lettuce and tomato.

This recipe was loved by all at my house.  Super easy.  I bought the pre-cooked Hormel brand chicken.  I let the noodle sit in the fridge for about 15-20 minutes before I mixed it all together.  Perfect for a hot summer day!

This was a great recipe, I just made two small modifications, I used grilled chicken breast stips, and I also used Farfalle pasta (bowtie).   Fiance Loved this, I love to cook, but am a novice, so there are many times when he barely takes a bite,  not only did he want seconds but he's taking some to lunch tomorrow --  as far as tomorrow, will not add the dressing/lettuce, I will let him add those on come lunch so it does not get wilted.

Thank you for this wonderful combination of flavors. I made this salad with a few alterations of my own. Instead of boneless, skinless chicken I used breaded, all white chicken fingers, adding bacon and onion instead of the tomato. Putting everything together for Rob's company picnic and well it was such a hit that everyone wants the recipe from me. Thank you again.

This wasn't a hit with my family.  We weren't sure if it should be served hot or cold.  I didn't mix the lettuce in with the chicken and sauce, because it seemed like it would wilt.  The receipe doesn't state what to do with the pasta--mix it in or serve the chicken mixture over it?  I ended up putting the lettuce on the plate, mounding the pasta on top of the lettuce, and then putting the chicken mixture over the whole thing.  It was terrible.  All but one family member threw it in the garbage.

I was searching for something my husband would eat, as he only eats pasta with some kind of meat and overcooked vegetables.  In my search for something different I discovered this, it was delightfully different.  My husband really enjoyed it and had the leftovers for lunch the next day.

This is a good summer evening meal. Cool but still filling. No need to change the recipe. I would only caution on going light with the dressing. You can always add more.

This receipe was so great. I did make a few changes to it, but only slight ones. 

I cooked my chicken in EVOO and Italian Seasoning instead of butter. I also let the noodles and chicken cool before I mixed the salad together to prevent wilting in the lettuce. I halved the recipe since it's only me and my husband and even then, I only used about half of the halved dressing mix (about 2 oz) and it coated the entire bowl of salad very well. Any more than that would have been a little too much.

The entire salad was gone by the end of the night. Definitely putting this in our meal rotation!

Overall this dish was good. I followed recipe with the exception of adding Greek seasoning to the chicken while sauteeing it. We ate it with home made garlic bread.

what can i say this recipe is very good. i cooked this for my family at a potluck and it was one of the first things to disappear quickly. I would leave out the tomatoes though because it makes it not taste like a true ceaser salad.

This was so good and so easy!  I baked the chicken in lemon juice, salt, pepper and balsamic vinegar and it was great.  I didn't use the red wine vinegar and it was still amazing!  Great for a week night meal!

I too thought this was ok.  I forgot to put the lettuce in before we ate it;  But I don't think that would make or break the flavor....It's quick and easy and tastes ok so I may make it again sometimg...

This was ok.  I thought this would be good but the lettuce was cold and pasta was warm so it was a bit funny together.  My husband liked it.  If I make this again i will make the pasta mixture and put in fridge for a bit before adding to the lettuce mixture.

This is an amazing recipe for anyone who likes caesar salad. It is my husband's favorite meal and it is super easy to make. I too was skeptical about the lettuce but it was good as well. It is just me and my husband so we often have leftovers so what I like to do is put the lettuce in the individual servings that way it does not get soggy. Great for leftovers as well, can even eat cold.

Easy to make, looks pretty, and everyone who had it liked it. Make sure to use a good quality Caesar dressing, as it is a major factor in the taste. Does not keep well because of the lettuce, so only make as much as you think can be eaten at one meal. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty tasty but I didn't like the texture of the lettuce after adding the pasta mixture that was warm.  I think it might be better once the chicken/pasta mixture is cooled in the fridge and add it to the lettuce after and eat it cold.

This was only ok for us,  I tried to follow the recipe (but used spinach), however it didn't have the flavor or yum-factor I expected.  It was a little weird for us.

Like another reviewer said -- I almost feel like I shouldn't be rating this because I did change it quite a bit.  I had to give it kudos though because it's a great idea and my husband said it was one of my best experiments yet!  I made a cold pasta salad with penne, diced grape tomoatoes, red & green pepper, cucumber and black pepper, mixed with a tiny bit of mayo and creamy caesar dressing.  Marinated my chicken breasts in a little bit of the dressing then grilled them.  Sliced the chicken and served it warm over the cold pasta and sprinkled fresh parmesan over the entire dish.  Fabulous...we'll be eating this all summer!

To make this dish healthier, I used whole wheat penne pasta, Ken's Lite Caesar Dressing, and ready-made grilled chicken breasts.  Becuase I do not care for warm and wilted lettuce, I let the pasta cool a bit before serving it on a bed of romaine.  I topped the dish off with croutons, which provided a nice crunch.  Even with all my "healthY" modifications, this dish was DELISH and I will definately be making this again!

This was very good, we all liked it. I omited the vinegar just because it didn't sound good and added a little extra ceasar dressing instead. I also switched the lettuce for baby spinach and used cherry tomatoes and red bell peppers. It makes a very large pot which is nice for us because we have a large family, very easy to tweek to your liking.

The basic pasta salad was good, but I think lettuce and pasta just don't belong in the same dish (i.e. either make a lettuce salad or a pasta salad, but don't try to combine the two).  It just didn't taste right.  This wasn't awful, but I won't make this again.

Wonderful Salad! Great for a hot summer night. I would cut the chicken up smaller next time but it had wonderful flavor with just the salt and pepper. It was a great hit at a family dinner!

This is a excellent recipe. Wanting something different for dinner and trying to please 4 very picky children. All 4 ate it up and asked for seconds!!! We all ate it hot and chilled excellent both ways. This will be on our menu every week. Thanks

followed the reviews and we did not care for this dish at all.  I was so disappointed because it used 6 chicken breats, an entire box of pasta and a whole head of romaine lettuce.  My kids, husband and I all thought the cesar taste was overwhelming.  I don't recommend it!

Quick and easy!  Next time I'll add a little more dressing and use some croutons as well for added crunch.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this came out with to much of a salad dressing oily taste for us.  Maybe cut back on the salad dressing and vinegar some.  Will try again with modifications.

This was really good!  I have always made this but without the red wine vinegar, so when you mix the dressing vinegar and cheese together, that adds another dimension to it.  To kick it up a notch, I used this Southwestern Caesar.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!! :)

I thought it was pretty bland, but that could be because I used reduced fat salad dressing.

I didn't like this. I thought the flavors would be great but they weren't. I highly recommend anyone who try this use GRILLED chicken. Cooking chicken in butter and then tossing with dressing is just too yucky! Too bad I didn't realize that before I tried this!

This recipe is one of mine and my husband's favs! It's quick to make, all the ingredients are usually on hand. I make the dressing with less vinegar than the recipe calls for. I use red cabbage and white cabbage with a mix of herb leaves. I layer the dressing and cheese, cabbage, herb leaves pasta chicken and then I mix it all up. It's very good... I highly recomend it!

We loved this!  I grilled the chicken instead and let everything cool off, mixed it all together and chilled in the fridge for an hour.  We thought it was great!  Will definately be making it again.  :)

Used rotisserie chicken and cooled the pasta before tossing it with the rest of ingredients and served it cold. Also cut back on the red wine vinegar in the dressing and used a lot less pasta. Lots of cracked black pepper on top. Very good.

It was pretty good! I did make a few changes. I used grilled chicken I had in the freezer, and only 2 large breast pieces and one small. I chilled the pasta before mixing because blah, I don't like hot pasta and cold lettuce all together. And I think we could use a little more Cesar dressing. I didn't use red wine vinegar I did use an olive oil and vinegar dressing I had on hand. And more cheese. Freaking excellent idea though! It will be a regular around here.

Very good would make again with the changes I made... when  cooking chicken breast I seasoned it with salt and pepper and approx 1-2 tbsp lemon juice. To the sauce I added 1 tbsp worchestshire sauce and 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 finely chopped garlic clove and 1 finely chopped green onion. Very good my family gobbled it up!!

MY family loves this one!!!!!  I love how quick it is not to mention convieniant. On thoes busy week nights when you dont have a lot of time to cook between the homework and feeding the animals. I buy a rosted chicken form our local grocery, while I am cutting up everything the kids are picking the meat off the chicken. When they are done my pasta is done and ready to go.

We have a restaurant called Cheddars who serves this exact recipe.  It is meant to be a cold salad, not a hot pasta dish.  Anyway, here are the changes that I will make when making it again.  I would double the lettuce (make sure you use romaine), omit the vinegar and add a bit more parmesean cheese.  It is a wonderful meal but it does not make good leftovers so make sure you only make what you will eat in one sitting.

I used a box of Kraft pasta salad - cesaer flavor. I had to add a little bit of extra cesaer dressing. And I also put in tomato and used regular lettuce and cooked chicken I already had in the freezer. It was a hit with the family!

Very good!  I left the lettuce out and vinegar per other reviews and I really enjoyed it. I'll make this again.

Good Flavor and Color but I found that I wanted a few more veggies in this pasta salad, so added cukes and snap peas.

I am 13 and made this for my dad for father's day. I thought it was delicious and he though it was delicious too! Instead of lettuce I used cooked spinach which I thought was much better and more appetizing. I seasoned the chicken a little by putting pepper and garlic seasoning. It added flavor to the chicken. We also added squash which was great because it needed some veggies. Next time I think there should be more veggies. But over all I thought it was delicious and so did my mom and dad. I highly rec omened this dish. But I will warn you it does make a lot of food!!!!

We REALLY enjoyed this.  Didn't use the vinegar.  It ended up being a wonderful light summer meal.  Leftovers don't keep very well since the lettuce wilts.  Definitely making it again this summer.

My entire family enjoyed this meal.  I too made a couple of miner changes.  I used a Lite dressing and only used about 1/3 of what it called for.  My husband tends to like a lot of sauce/dressing so he simply added a bit more to his individual serving.  I also sauted some onion and garlic before adding the chicken.   About 2 minutes before the chicken was done I added some baby squash to boost up the veggie content. Oh yeah, whole grain pasta in place of the regular stuff.  Yum!

This was good,not a blow me away taste. I took it to a family party I only had a very little left over. Was very different and a made a nice side dish, not too heavy and didn't get soggy at the buffet table. I would have liked to have the chicken to have a bit more flavor.  Next time I think I'll marinate the chicken in ceasar dressing. Thank you.

Close to the chicken Ceasar salads I tend to crave. I would suggest finding a homemade Ceasar dressing recipe you like and use it instead of something store bought. All in all though, this will become steady summer faire for our family.

This is a great potluck recipe.  I added red bell pepper and used a light creamy bottled caesar dressing.  I did not add the lettuce which worked out well as we ate the leftovers cold over greens the next day.

I used Spinache instead of Romaine.  It got a little soft - perhaps wait to mix until just before serving.

Easy and tasty - nice for a quick dinner before Cub Scouts. I didn't have the lettuce so I just used the sauce and chicken over linguine. Not sure anyone would go for the hot lettuce anyway. I'll most likely try this again - thanks!

I guess this just wasn't my taste.  I didn't like if for several reasons.  Mostly I didn't like having warm chicken and pasta together with lettuce.  The flavor was fine.  But the next time I'm in the mood for something like this I will either go with a classic chicken caesar salad or do this recipe WITHOUT the lettuce and toss the chicken and sauce with some fettecini or egg noodles.  I filled up on bread and picked out the chicken.  I'm already wondering what I'm going to have for lunch tonight.

This was a great recipe. Even my kids ate it! There was no leftovers. And easy to make. Added to our family favorites.

My huband and I really enjoyed this. I used the prepackaged chicken to save time. I brought this to work and everyone really liked it. Thank you for posting.

I made this for the salad portion of a progressive dinner. It went over very well. For the chicken I used Big Al's Chicken from this web site. (We had made some and froze it.) I think next time I am going to add some more dressing not much but some more.

Not a bad recipe.  I omitted the lettuce, it just didn't appeal to me at all.  The  leftovers didn't reheat well.  The dressing gave it a nice twist, I may try it again.
