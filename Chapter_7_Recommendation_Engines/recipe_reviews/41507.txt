This recipe is not only easy, easy,easy to make but it is also incredibly delicious.  I made several batches at Christmas to give to friends and family. I put them in large mason jars and cut a circle of fabric to cover the lid.  Then I tied a festive ribbon around the fabric.  Absolutely everyone who received these loved them.

I was surprised not to find butter as an ingredient and when I made the dough it would not form together.I then added 1/2 cup butter and although not mixed properly they turned out good but very crumbly.The recipe did not make 80 but more like 3 1/2 doz.I liked the taste and will try this again but mixing the butter with the sugar as in other biscotti recipes.

This was my first attempt at making biscotti.  These are delicious and very easy to make.  I dipped the tops in chocolate for an added treat.  Will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these at Christmas and really liked them. And I used Splenda for Baking instead of the sugar. I put all of the dough in a circular loaf on the center of the pan and baked them.  When I sliced them, they were more like the biscotti in the coffee shops.  I'll make them again!

These biscotti are the closest to my Italian Grandmother's recipe.  They are tasty, hard enough to dip in coffee, and bake nicely.  Very east recipe and a classic Xmas cookie.

Very easy and delicious.....my first time making biscotti as well. When making the dough I needed to add a fourth egg because there just wasn't enough moisture to bring it together properly, maybe because I mixed it by hand?

Delicious!  Very similar to coffee shop biscotti.  I have tried other recipes containing butter before but the cookies were always too soft for my taste.  These were very dry -- just like the ones you buy!  I made two changes -- since I had only two eggs, I substituted 1/4 c liquid egg product and (I think because of that) I had to add about 1T of oil to make the dough stick together.  For me, the recipe made 24 "standard" coffee-shop sized biscotti (with assorted ends), far less than stated, but what I expected.  Very good and very easy!

I tried this recipe and frankly it was a sticky mess until I added more flour.  I am at a high altitude so maybe that was part of it and I think I may have added a little too much flour (about a cup more).  I am going to try it once more because what I ended up with had a nice flavor-just not the right texture.  Maybe adding just 1/2 cup more flour next time.
