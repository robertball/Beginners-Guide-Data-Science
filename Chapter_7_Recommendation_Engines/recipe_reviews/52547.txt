i've made lots of mixed-fruit crisps over the years, and tried this recipe because of the new and interesting way to layer the fruit between crisp on the bottom and crisp sprinkled on top.  a great idea, and it really mixed the flavors throughout.  a couple of changes i made to the recipe, however --- i used a combo of fresh peaches and blueberries because that's what i had on hand.  i did not add sugar to the fruit as it says to do in step 2; seemed unnecessary and it worked fine without.  also - 1 1/2 cups of butter?!?!  insane - i used half of that amount and it still was buttery and crumbly.  i'll make it again for sure.

This is now my family's favorite dessert. Sometimes I cut the recipe in half and use a bag of frozen triple berry mix from the grocery store and a 8 x 8 pan. I have not altered the recipe and it is wonderful each time. Also, I have only used the frozen grocery store mix and it turns out great!!

Hint: melt the butter in a dish while the oven is preheating. Once you have all the dry ingredients mixed together and are ready to go, then mix in the melted butter. Makes it much easier to mix everything, and it comes out more consistently. I would add at least five cups of fruit, because there is a lot of topping. I used frozen fruit; I just let it sit on the counter for half an hour, and it was still kind of frozen when I put it in the over. A little bit wet (due to it being frozen fruit I think), but absolutely delicious and fool proof.

What happens when you die?  Is there life after death?  Is there a God?  Will I be rewarded for the good that I've done during my life?  The answers to all these questions will be made known to you once you make this Triple Berry Crisp.  It surpasses the feeling you get when a sudden cool breeze rushes past you during a four-day heat wave.  It will make financial account managers take their shoes off and throw them in a dumpster. Quite simply, if everyone in the world had but one bite of this Triple Berry Crisp on the same day at exactly the same time, everyone on Earth would suddenly, magically, find they spoke the same language.  All barriers would collapse. Wars would cease.  And perhaps best of all, Hallmark Cards would instantly go out of business because we'd no longer need to rely on someone else to help us express our love for each other.  I kid you not.  It's that good.

I have made this several times this summer. Always changing one thing or another. I have made it with all berries,some with peaches.Recently made it with just peaches and it was great.I usually use only 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar. Fruit is natually sweet, and I try to cut the fat down as much as possible and still have a good taste, anything less than 1 cup of butter doesn't seem to taste as good.  This is a very good recipe to have on hand.

Just took this out of the oven.  Very good.  I used 3 bags of frozen berries; strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  I just thawed, rinsed and drained them in the collander and then used Splenda instead of sugar.  I also cut back on some of the brown sugar.  I added a bag of pecan pieces to the crumble mixture. Before placing in the oven I added a mixture of cinnamon and Splenda over the top of the crumble and baked.  Delish!!!!

I was thrilled with the way this recipe turned out. Most crisp recipes just call for a crumb top, but this one was outstanding with a crust bottom.  Everyone loved it. My daughter-in-law said it tasted like oatmeal cookies with fruit. I used 3 pints of frozen blueberries, thawed. Can't wait to make it again. Will try other fruits.

This was excellent! Used one bag of (thawed) mixed blueberries, blackberries and raspberries instead of fresh and it turned out perfectly.

This is SO good! We ate if warm out of the oven with a little vanilla ice cream, mmmmmm! I did make some changes: used whole wheat flour and frozen berries, and also didn't "cut" the butter into the mixture just melted it a bit and mixed it in, it was fine. I didn't realize I was out of brown sugar, so used white (1 .25 cups instead of 1.5) and rather than mix the berries with sugar I used honey. I added a few more shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg too. Will definitely make these again! Everyone loves them!

Hubs loved this and promptly rated it 4-stars.  I, however, was somewhat less impressed, but we'll keep the four star rating simply because it can be tweaked to appeal to personal preferences.  I used raspberries, blueberries and strawberries, more than called for.  Yet there still was too much of the crumb mixture - way out of proportion here.  Half the amount of the oatmeal mixture would be plenty, and you could do with even less than that if you limited it to the topping only, skipping the crust altogether, which would be my preference.  I'm thinking that the high ratings here are for this recipe AFTER the reviewer made their personal changes.

This is an excellent recipe. I've even forgotten to add the cinnamon and nutmeg and it was still great. I've made it with blueberries only, with three berries, and with peaches and blueberries. All were excellent. I've tossed the fruit with Splenda instead of sugar and couldn't tell any difference. I've also used whole wheat flour instead of regular---also just as good. Do grease the baking dish with Pam or the bottom crumble will stick! And don't press the bottom crumble in too hard, for the same reason. Also definitely toss the fruit with 1 TBSP of instant tapioca or cornstarch to thicken the filling a bit, otherwise it can be runny or loose. You can also use almost double the fruit for a 9x13 dish; if you use the amount stated in the recipe, you end up with too much topping in relation to fruit. I suggest using cold butter cut into small cubes, not melted butter, to make the topping. Use a pastry cutter and if your hand gets tired of that, alternate with quickly pinching the mixture with your fingers. You get a much better consistency to the topping with cold butter. Also, I know some people reduce the butter, but I've made it both ways and the full amount of butter is really part of what makes this recipe so exceptional. This crumble is better the next day, so I always make ahead if I'm serving it to guests. Enjoy. :-)

I modified this recipe so much that it is almost completely different. The reason is I was in the beginning of Phase 2 on the South Beach Diet and needed to make a treat for my birthday, knowing that cake was not an option. :) I made a lot of substitutions... here they are:  3 cups of cherries, & 3 cups of blueberries; granular Splenda instead of white sugar; also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract & 1/2 tsp almond extract, plus 3 tbsp arrowroot (cornstarch substitute) for thickening to make not so runny. For crumble/topping mixture, I used the amount of oats called for, but also added 1 cup of chopped almonds (for more nutrients and crunch!); whole wheat flour; Splenda brown sugar blend; doubled the cinnamon (2 tsp); doubled the nutmeg (1 tsp); and lastly, used Smart Balance 50/50 blend instead of butter. This recipe is obviously flexible. I didn't make it the original way before modifying it drastically, so I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't be good, but it was SOOO tasty, and I felt so healthy eating it, although it didn't taste "diet-y". My friends at my birthday party loved it, and they certainly weren't on diets. I would recommend this portfolio of revisions to anyone looking for a tasty healthy version. Enjoy!!!

An excellent recipe, but I have a few tips to share.  First of all, I've seen several people recommend that the butter be melted instead of cut into the crust/topping.  I have tried it both ways, and even though it is a bit more time-consuming, you will get a better result if you cut in the butter.  I also recommend that you grease the bottom of your baking dish with shortening...it will help to keep the crust from sticking to the bottom.  

I bought frozen unsweetened berries (a mix of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries), and thawed them in a colander in the sink, to allow the water and juice to drain as they thawed.  Once they were fully thawed, I rinsed them with cold water and drained well again before adding the sugar.  Once you add the sugar to them, they will juice up again...but don't drain again...that juice will make a nice syrup while baking.  

Finally, the amount of crust/topping is a bit much...you could cut the amount by a quarter, or even a third, and still have plenty enough.

Maybe this would work better with frozen berries so that there would be more juice in the filling. The overall effect was dry, and I couldn't have eaten it without a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it. I would only use half the topping (with less butter) and only  put it on the top. There just wasn't enough berry flavor under all the flour and oats. Next time, I will leave out the nutmeg, even at a half teaspoon it overpowered the crisp (my nutmeg was very fresh). Without several changes, I wouldn't make this again.

YU-MMY!  This was really good.  One of the better crumble crusts that I've made.
I didn't have fresh berries, so I had to use frozen berries, which tend to have a lot more juice.  So I sprinkled a little "minute" tapioca in the bottom before I put the berries in and that did the trick wonderfully.

EXCELLENT!  One of the best dessert recipes on this website.  Super easy to make.  It almost turned out more like a fruit cookie bar than a crisp, and that's not a critcism.  It was just wonderful.  I used only blackberries and Blueberries (it's all I had), they were very fresh. I added two teaspoons of corn starch in with the sugar on the berries.  As some people suggested, I only used 1 cup (2 bars) of butter, softened them in the microwave and then cut them into the topping mixture.  I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  The finished product was plenty sweet and tasted fabulous served with a premium vanilla ice cream.  I had NO PROBLEMS with this recipe being runny--I'm not quite certain what other people are doing to make it that way.  The crisp looked delicious and served beautifully to 14 guests over for a BBQ/swim party who gobbled it up.  I can't recommend this recipe highly enough.

Great recipe!! Never thought to add crisp on top AND bottom! perfect! Just follow other reviewers suggestions and DOUBLE the berries (or you'll get more of a bar) and use only 1/2 - 2/3 the amount of butter (or it will be too greasy). 5 stars with those two alterations...MMMMMM!

This was very good! and so easy.  I used a mix of blueberries and raspberries as that is what I had on hand. As it is apple season I am going to give this a try with apples and a little cinnamon.   Going in to the 'do'er again' folder.

I've made this twice now--both times using frozen fruit. The first one I made was strawberry, raspberry, blueberry and it was excellent. The second time with peaches and blueberries--again excellent. Just thaw the fruit first and mix in a tiny sprinkle of sugar (doesnt need it, really) and voila! I suggest melting the butter before you add it to the dry ingredients. Much easier. Since there are only the two of us, I halved it and baked it in an 8x8 glass dish. This is so easy and so, so good! A keeper!

Bake the bottom crust 5 min or until crispy before adding the fruit and top crumble. No other complaints! I used thawed& drained frozen fruits but I'm sure fresh fruits would be even more scrumptious!

I'm a huge fan of any type of crisp and I thought this one was really good.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is I thought that the nutmeg just didn't fit well with the recipe - I could taste too much of it.  I've also never made any other crisp with nutmeg before.  Next time I will leave it out and I think it would be much better.

This is the best crisp recipe in the entire world. Totally exquisite. 

I followed the recipe exactly OTHER than using HALF the topping mixture. All the other reviews are absolutely correct, for some reason the topping to filling ratio is screwed up in this recipe. And I am a topping phene. So either use twice the berries or half the topping. 

I used a square 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13, since it just looked like it would be such a thin layer of berries on the 9x13. I skipped the bottom crisp because it just seems unnecessary And how on earth will it "crisp" up if it's underneath? I'm sure it's good either way.

I let the berries (handpicked blackberries) juice up with the two tablespoons of sugar while I made my topping. You bet I poured every last drop of that delicious syrupy goodness into the pan with the berries. I put a nice thick layer of topping on, so much that I couldn't see the berries at all, about a one-inch layer. There was still about half the topping left, so I just froze it for an easy crisp at some point in the future. 

I baked it for exactly 40 minutes. OH MY GOD!!! I have seriously never had more delicious crisp in my entire life. DO NOT reduce the butter! It is what makes this recipe so unbelievable. The butter (which I cut in cold, by the way), melts down into the berries, transforming them into some kind of heavenly substance.

So don't change the recipe itself, just use more berries or less topping and you will have yourself a fabulous crisp.

we buy in bulk so I had this huge bag of mixed fruit I wanted to use up. I tried this and it turned out fantastic! I doubled the recipe and made two large pans. I froze one uncooked to use for a later time and baked the other.  My husband who is very picky came back for seconds. I served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.
 Hubby was so impressed he took some to his friend.

So this recipe was great! I only used 1 cup of brown sugar, but I could have stood more and still been fine. Stayed with the original amount of butter however and it turned out great. Would have been a lot better with whipped cream though!

This is my staple berry crisp recipe!  Frozen berries work well for me (unthawed).  I reduced the butter to 1 cup + 2Tbl..  We like more berries per crust ratio, so I double the berries.  And par-baking the bottom crust for 7-8 minutes seems to work well.  Great flavor!

Easy and delicious!  I also cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan as another reviewer suggested.  The measurements were perfect!

This was soooo delicious served warm. What a great end to our holiday meal! I halved the crisp ingredients because I only made the top crust. I used oil instead of butter and reduced that amount to 1/4 cup. I left out the nutmeg. I will be making this again! I served it with a scoop of vanilla icecream with some cinnamon sprinkled on top - Wonderful!

This is excellent! I used a frozen mix of raspberries, blueberries, and marionberries. The only thing I did differently was to coat my berries in a little bit of flour so the filling wouldn't be runny. Topped with vanilla ice cream, this is so delicious!

I used frozen berries and if you like berries you should use a lot (I used about 2 16 oz. bags and it wasn't many berries for the amount of crumble).  My husband likes less berries and more crumble so it works for him.  Melt the butter so that it's easier to combine with the dry ingredients.

Made this recipe last night and just love, love, love it. I used 8 cups of the frozen berries and let them thaw for about an hour and drained the juice. This recipe calls for 4 1/2 cups of berries but even the 8 cups didn't overload it or make the crust soggy. I will definitely make this again and again!

I made apple crisp with this recipe. It was delicious. I think I'll cut back on the topping a bit for my personal preference. I also left out one stick of butter, again personal preference. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe!

Oh my, my, my!!!  This is absolutely to die for, I'm in Hog Heaven.  I only made a half recipe as that was all the berries I had, but used them generously. That sucker was gone within a few minutes.  Everyone loved it and wanted more.  Followed the recipe exactly for the half recipe. I would absolutely not change a thing.  Why would you fix something if it wasn't broken.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!!! This deserves 10 stars.

The only changes I made was that I used a bag of thawed and drained mixed berries (blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries) and also used fresh blackberries as well.  This recipe is super easy and my guests loved it!  Best served warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.  Next time I'm going to try fresh peaches and blueberries just for something different!

Very good. I did reduce the brown sugar (used only 1 cup) as suggested by others and increased the ground cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Plus reduced the butte to 1 cup. I used frozen berries and tossed them with the white sugar (actually used Splenda) and added a little cornstarch. It was delicious - not too sweet but very flavorful!! Thanks Polly!

I made this with black and red raspberries from my garden and followed the recipe exactly. What a disappointment. I thought it was way too sugary and greasy...the huge amounts of butter and sugar were a tip off but I relied on others comments and decided to try this anyway. I normally eat a very healthy diet, low fat and low sugar. What a waste of fresh berries!

Make Changes!! There's lots of crisp topping here, it's too much. I used 2 cups fresh blueberries with 1 1/2 cups fresh peaches (diced).  Put 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice on the fruit.  I reduced the brown sugar to 1cup (fruit is already sweet), and used 1 1/4 cup each of oats and flour.  YUM ! With a few changes this recipe is a winner.

WOW!!  I used fresh blackberries and raspberries and this was soo amazingly delicious!!  Easy to make, too!  The only problem I had was spreading the crust on the bottom of the pan and found it worked the best to spread it with my hands.  I will definitely be making this again!!  Thanks a million for the recipe!

This dish was amazing!!!!!! I was skeptical because the reviews seemed inconsistent. But I have to say I was wowed by this recipe.  Here is what I did. I used 2 cups of each kind of berry instead of 1 &1/2. I did not completely thaw the berries. Because I bumped up the amount of berries I added 6 tbsp a of sugar instead of 4. I also added 2 tbsp of minute tapioca to the berry mixture. This stops you from getting runny berries.  
I was skeptical about the amount of butter at first. Initially I added 1&1/2 stick of butter but it wasn't enough so I added the second stick of table soft butter. I also added a tbsp of vanilla extract to the crust. I really took the time to work the crust by hand that it became a dough consistency.  I then cooked the bottom crust separate for 20 minutes before adding the berry mixture & top crust so the bottom wouldn't be soggy. I baked it in a 9x13 aluminum tray for easy clean up & covered the tray in crisco as suggested by another reviewer so the crust doesn't stick. After I cooked the bottom for 20 minutes. I added the berry mixture and the crumbled the rest of the crust on top. Many reviewer said they had too much topping left over. I did not find that to be true at all. I had the perfect amount. But I also did not skimp when I layered the bottom. I did cook this for 40 minutes & broiled the top for 5 minutes to get it a deep golden color. This crisp can be served hot or cold & is great with whipped cream. A real crowd pleaser.

Excellent and exactly what I was looking for...crunchy oat topping..I read a lot of the other reviews and only made a couple changes to my taste..although the original I'm sure is scrumptious :) I used 1 cup of butter, melted first and added to the other dry ingredients. I also did not toss the berries with sugar initially. There is enough sweetness in the crumble mixture. I used combo blue/black/rasp and baked 40 min. Yum Yum. Definitely making again..

I made a 1/4 batch in 4 ramekins.  I put the full amount of berries on top of the crust, no sugar, added the topping and baked for 20 min.  Really good!  Second time I made them I cut the butter in the crust to 1/4 C - that's 1 T per ramekin.  Still really good.  Thanks Polly!

This turned out really good! Very simple yet always a crowd pleaser. I would suggest 2 cups of each fruit though, 1 1/2 C of the three left it a little thin in the 9x13 pan. Served it with warm "British style" custard instead of cool whip, for me it makes it seem more like what my nanna made, but that's more of a "fall treat" as opposed to summer.
Edit: this became a family favorite and something I've been asked to make for get-togethers many many times! I use variants of fruits depending on the season, strawberry blackberry, raspberry and blueberry are my go to though. By far this is the best recipe I've found!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I use all fresh black raspberries and it was heaven!  I did cut the butter to 1 cup (and I used margarine...it's what I had on hand) and quick cooking oats rather than rolled oats (again, what I had).  I would consider letting the berries sit in the sugar a little longer before putting them on the crust to allow them to get a little juicier, but it will be made many times over!  I can't wait to try other fruits!

This was so, so good...just a little too sweet for me.  I'd probably reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup next time just for personal preference.  Great crisp recipe...thanks!

Delicious!!! Great top and bottom crust. I reduced the amount of butter and brown sugar and it was still sweet. I cut it in half and used a round pie plate. I used 1 bag of thawed and drained mixed berries from the dollar store. Next time I will add a bag of peaches too.

Would give 5 stars but had to change a bit. Used half of the butter, 1 cup of brown sugar and a lot more fruit. Yummy and a keeper!

This crisp was delicious! I used blueberries and peaches instead of all different berries. I used at least 5 cups of fruit, instead of 4.5. I cut down on some of the ingredients because it does make too much as other reviewers have suggested. I used: 1.5 cups flour, 2 cups oats, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup butter. I would recommend eating it warm with some vanilla ice cream!

Tasted like a very buttery oatmeal cookie with berries.  This was an OK recipe.  I cut back on the butter and cinnamon , but other than that, I made it by the instructions.  It was WAY too buttery.  I like the way that it had a crust and a crumb topping.  I'll try something else next time or either cut way back on the butter if I do make this again.  Adjustments made:  1.25 cups butter instead of 1.5 and 3/4 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp.

This recipe is amazing! The first time i made it with real berries and it turned out amazing. When i made it the second time with mainly frozen berries it was a little bit too juicy for my liking! Definitely an amazing recipe either way!!

Very yummy! I followed the directions except that I didn't have raspberries so I just added more blackberries and blueberries. I also put the butter in the microwave to get it to soften quicker it made mixing the ingredients alot easier. Chopped pecans would be a wonderful addition to this already delicious crisp!

This recipe is easy and tastes great every time and allows you to mix and match the berries.  I've made it with the full amount of butter and then with half the amount and found the extra butter unnecessary.

So Good! Used two packages of frozen triple berry mix and it was a few ounces more than called for but just enough actually.  I thought it called for a lot of butter (3 sticks) but used it anyhow and mixed all the dry in the food processor. Served this to company and had it cooking while we ate dinner, with fresh whipped cream on top and they loved it, my husband who never eats dessert had a tad and had to have more absolutely loved this and had more last night as well and I think it's the best i've ever made. If you like the crumble more on the soft, moist kind of gooey side then this is for you! The top is pretty crumbly but the bottom layer is the soft gooey part...delish!!

Just tried this recipe and it as great. I used the same berries and also added strawberries. I think this be fantastic with peaches. The crust was delicious. I used some advice from other reviews: added a little flour to fruit mixture, added extra cinnamon and nutmeg, and added walnuts on top.

So yummy and very easy. I took the advice of others and upped the berries to 2 C. each. I only used 5 T. of sugar and it was fine, as the berries were ripe and flavorful. I made the dough in the food processor and it turned out great, and there was a lot of it. Definitely a keeper.

I really liked the taste of this dessert.  The crisp part was exactly what I was looking for when I found this recipe.  I only game it 4 stars because I like my berry crisps to be more juicy.  When finished with this, I could almost have cut the crisp into bars and served them that way.  Next time I will either double the berries or halve the crisp.  I did bake longer than required so that the dough would be cooked all the way through.  I also added rhubarb to the berries to make a tart/sweet combination.  Definately worth trying!

This was sooo good!  I used a bag of frozen berries (including cherries) from Trader Joes, and added a handful of additional blackberries.  Cut down on the sugar (next time I will omit the white sugar altogether, the berries were plenty sweet).  Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white.  Also didn't use all the butter.  This was so good!!  It was gone very fast too.  Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent! I have to say, however, that it goes against my grain to use this much butter and sugar. So, I substituted ½ c. olive oil for 1 of the cubes of butter.  And, I didn't use the white sugar on the berries.  And, I used fresh peaches + frozen triple berry mix (Costco).  And, it was fantastic.  Also, instead of the usual ice cream, I used full-fat Greek honey yogurt on top when serving it.  I am definitely going to make my version of this wonderful dessert!

For the love of all that is holy do not make this stuff. It is so delicious that you won't be able to stop eating it. I made mine according to recipe except I used fresh strawberries and fresh blueberries probably totalling about 5 cups. Its freakin' amazing. Seriously don't make this!

Wonderful! Like most others say...you might want to add a little more fruit. I used 6-7 cups of my freshly frozen blueberries. I also added lemon zest.:)Yummy! If you love crisp topping, this is the recipe for you! The more the better for me and there was still plenty adding the extra fruit! :) Family loved it!

Very yummy! I made it using fresh peaches and raspberries (that's what I had on hand). While it's true that you probably don't NEED to use 1 1/2 cups butter, I figure if you're going to have dessert, then have dessert! Everyone loved it, and wanted seconds. We will making this again for sure :-)

I've always found that if I am using frozen fruit for the crisp adding a couple tablespoons of flour to the sugar/fruit mix tends to thicken up the juices from the fruit.  I can't think of the right word to use but I liken it to fruit pie filling.  I've just sprinkled the flour over the fruit before mixing everything together but if you are worried about the flour clumping, mixing it with the sugar first may alleviate that issue.  My in-laws used to have an Italian plum tree and would give me so many plums I didn't know what to do with them.  I cut them in half, took the pit out, froze them and they made the most incredible fruit crisp.  The skin from the plum made a lovely texture and color. My favorite by far!

First of all I halved the recipe for an 8 x 10 pan. We loved my "doctored" version. I used strawberries instead of blackberries. I did not add sugar to my wonderful fresh juicy fruit. I only used 1/4 cup of butter and half the brown sugar in the crumble. It turned out delicious. I will definitely make again.

I follow this recipe exactly, but I chose to double the oatmeal topping because it didn't look like there would be enough for both a bottom and top crust.  I made this while visiting my in-laws, and they loved it!  I used fresh blueberries, and it was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe, Polly!

Wow!  This was wonderful!  I basically halved the recipe except I added extra berries, and less butter and brown sugar. I probably used roughly 4 cups of fresh blackberries and strawberries combined. I only used 1/2 cup of butter, but I melted it in the microwave before adding it to the dry ingredients, and honestly, I probably could've gotten away with even less butter than that--the topping was plenty moist.  I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I tossed in about 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts for added crunchiness in the topping.  Instead of baking this in one big pan, I used four 6oz ramekins for individual desserts.  I made this for just for me and my husband but I'm socking this recipe away for the next time we have guests...it's that easy, and that good! Plus, it's super pretty (and AMAZING with vanilla ice cream!!!) :)  No, seriously, it's good--try it.  :)

yummy!! i did make mine a little differently than written.  I halved the crumble recipe, and topped my fresh berry mixture with the crumble.  I did not have a bottom crust, only berries.  I also added a bit of vanilla to the crumble.  Very tasty crumb topping that compliments the berry mixture very nicely. Will definitely make again and again  and will try different fruits too.

For the longest time, crisps have been a favorite dessert of mine, but I only took the plunge and made one this last Thanksgiving.  Given how good this was, I am now kicking myself for not preparing this sooner.  This is a very easy dessert to prepare, and really tasty too.  Great recipe!

This recipe is terrific!  The crisp on the bottom and the top make this unique and absolutely delicious.  I made a large pan (approximately 10 x 15 inches) and I used three bags of frozen mixed berries (same types as in the recipe); each bag was 16 ounces.  I used the berries in a semi-frozen state and used 4 Tbls. sugar, 1-1/2 cups butter and 1-1/2 times the other ingredients.  This makes a lot of crisp mixture.  I followed the baking instructions as written.  I served this to many dinner guests and all loved it and asked for the recipe.  This is moved into my "favorite" file.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

This is a great alternative to a cobbler. I used fresh blackberries only and it was delicious. Mine came out not quite done enough in the middle so next time I will cook a little longer

I made this recipe exactly according to the recipe and the crisp was excellent.  Next time I will take the advice of others and cut back a bit on the sugar and butter.  I feel like the butter could have been cut maybe even in half.  This recipe is definately a keeper though.  Eventually I taylor all recipes to our tastes but I like to see how the recipe is in its origional form first.

Very good!! I used frozen berries & added a bit of flour so they wouldn't be runny/watery. I also added 2tbs sugar to the berries. 
Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I was going to take a picture to submit on the site but my boyfriend woke up in the middle of the night and ate all of it!  It was that good!  I read all of the other reviews and saw the problem with the butter so I just slowly added the butter until it was at the consistency that I wanted, I didn't end up using the full amount and it came out perfect.  I'm going to make this again and again and again!

I made this with all blackberries, left out the nutmeg (I had none) and cut down the butter to 1 cup, and it was so good. Super easy to make. And so yummy warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was excellent! I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and Splenda instead of real sugar. I used raspberries and blueberries. It was sooo good. Thanks for sharing!

This is truly a "delightful" recipe!  I used two cartons of fresh blackberries, two 12-ounce bags of frozen raspberries and two 12-ounce bags of frozen blueberries (can't wait for fresh berries to come back in season), upped the sugar a bit...probably to just under 1/2 cup... and baked for 50 minutes...as I said, "delightful".  Everyone loved this.  I did serve it warm with vanilla ice cream, but I enjoyed it best all by itself.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Wonderful!  Even my picky cobbler hating children loved this one!!!!!  Pretty much followed the recipe but healthed it up a bit with some whole wheat flour, reduced butter (would have been even better with all the butter) and groundflax seed.  These won't change the flavor dramatically and it was great.  Thanks.

My search for the best cobbler recipe is over!  Ok, technically a crisp, I loved it and so did my family. I did cut the butter to 2 cubes melted, and would cut the brown sugar down a bit. I had only blackberries and used about 5 1/2 cups that I cooked slightly with 1/2 cup sugar and 2 T. cornstarch. It did kind of end up like a breakfast bar, but oh, so good.  You could use any fruit.  Thanks so much! I will use this over and over.

Very good.  The only changes I would make next time are:

1) grease bottom of the pan with butter
2) melt the butter/soften the butter instead of cutting in cold butter
3) use only 1 cup of brown sugar (was a little too sweet
4) use more berries, a little less of the topping
5) might add some pecans like another reviewer suggested.

Awsome dish!  If you love the "crisp" part of fruit crisps, then this is for you!  I used two cups each of the fruit (fresh, not frozen), just to fill up the dish I was using; it came out great - served it at a dinner party last weekend, and everyone wanted the recipe and took leftovers home! Will be making this for all my BBQ/Grilling parties!

I used all blueberries, we picked and froze them last summer, just ran under cool water to thaw them a bit. In our opinion this could use... more berries :) and some nuts, walnuts or pecans would be great. Other than that I really like it. I especially like the crust on the bottom combined with the topping. yummy

I used this crust with peaches. I tossed with the same amount of sugar as in the recipe, probably used about 12 fresh peaches. Everyone raved about it and still does... months after.

A keeper for life!

Absolutely a 5 star recipe. Easy and delicious. I used 2 bags of frozen mixed berries and had this in the oven in less than 10 minutes. My husband raved about how good it was. Try this recipe--it is a keeper!!

This recipe is really easy to make.  I made two modifications to the original recipe - I used all fresh raspberries (4 1/2 cups worth)since they are in season and we have them readily available and I sprinkled granulated sugar on top (just enough for a light cover.  I didn't measure, it was maybe 2-3 tablespoons) to get it more crispy on top.  I thought is was very "dessert" like, great flavor - I really enjoyed it.  My husband liked it as well, but thought there needed to be more "crisp", so next time I will probably cut down on the raspberries (I'm going to try 3 1/2 cups) to get the ratio of crumble mixture to fruit more to his liking. I would recommend the sugar on top - it was nice and crunchy on top, even the next day.

This was absolutely loved and raved about by everyone who tried it.  I myself didn't care for the nutmeg flavor in the topping and I may cut down on it next time.  But my husband who is not a big dessert person, had seconds and couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Also, I used frozen berries as fresh are just too expensive in our part of the country!

REALLY EASY and very tasty..especially if you prefer a sweet, crumbly/crunchy type of topping instead of a cobbler/pastry type.  I used some strawberries too to fill in for a shortage on the other berries..."quadruple" berry crisp is great too!  I would add "GREASE the bottom of the pan"...mine stuck!  And I don't agree with the description...it is not very attractive looking.  I will make it again for my family but not for guests.

I just made this. Love this recipe. It's absolutely delicious. The one thing that I did different was the butter. I melted the butter and poured it into the flour mixture in a bowl and mixed it all up, then I pressed it into a large pie dish. It turned out perfect. Served with a little whipped cream or vanilla ice-cream. I will definitely be making this dessert again! Thanks. :-)

Love it! It's my go-too, basic crisp recipe.  I decided to switch it up for Fall and made it into a "CARAMEL APPLE CRISP". Using 5 cups of sliced apples instead of berries, I drizzled about 1/3 cup of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel topping over the top of the apple layer before adding the top crisp layer.  I baked it at 350 for a full 50 minutes (testing the apples until they softened).  Add a dollop of ice cream while still warm and VOILA! This is a 5 Star family fav.

This is extremely sweet, gooey and unpleasant to eat. I believe it needs only about half the brown sugar and butter. It also needs a good pinch of salt if using unsalted butter. I will not be making this again.

Tonight I made this with 5 cups of fresh blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. The other reviews are correct, you can even add more fruit then that! Of important note is that the fresh berries create a lot of juice and it appears very runny when finished baking. Turn off the oven and let it sit for 15-20 mins to thicken and it comes out perfect and still warm.  Three sticks of butter is a TON of butter so I think next time I will try two and also may add fresh grated lemon rind or lemon juice. Serve with vanilla bean ice cream

Very good dessert after a few tweaks.  I added a few TBSP of flour to my fruit and sugar to help thicken the juice since several noted that they thought juice made the crust soggy.  And I only used 1 c butter, since 1 1/2 seems like way too much.  I will make this again, but next time will either add more fruit or cut back on the crust.

I scaled this to 6 servings and made a mini version of this recipe.  I only had blackberries so I used those.  I cut the butter in half (1/4 cup for mine) and melted it.  I opted to omit the nutmeg, as I’m not a fan.  This smelled heavenly while baking, but I was disappointed with the end result.  This had way too much crumb mixture and not enough berries.  The excessive amount of crumbs, bottom and top, make this taste really dry.  Sorry, but I think I’ll keep looking.

Excellent! I used Splenda in place of the sugar and cut the butter back a little. I served it with a healthy "dollup" of plain Greek yogurt. This would be wonderful with a little glaze or icing on top, too.

I absolutely loved this! I made it w/ frozen blueberries, fresh raspberries and fresh strawberries. A little sugary, so I would cut that down a bit next time.

I have made this numerous times, using different fruit. It turned out GREAT each time. Fresh or frozen fruit, all good. Last time I used cranberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. GOOD! I also melted the butter before adding. I usually put almost double the fruit, makes it even more delish. Try this, you surely will not regret it.

Not bad. I'm not sure that I liked the triple berry mix as it seemed a bit tart. I could add more suger I guess but I'm thinking I more partial to just an apple crisp. I will say that it was easy and all just not my cup of tea.

My kids love this dessert.  For some reason, I was out of all-purpose flour so  I used whole wheat flour.  It turned out tasty.  Shared with a neighbor and they all loved it, too.

This was awesome!  I only had blackberries (and lots of them!), so I made it just with those.  I also melted the butter to make mixing easier, and left out the nutmeg because I'm not a fan.  Everyone loved it!

excellent!  Used 2 c each of strawberries, blueberries and peaches.  The oatmeal crisp part is fantastic--just the right combo of flavors and consistency.  Two of us ate the entire 13x9 throughout the course of the day.  This could be made super healthy by finding a quality sugar substitute to put in place of the white and brown sugar.  5 stars

Per other reviewers, I reduced the amount of butter to 1 cup.  I also used whole wheat flour.  I ran out of brown sugar at 1 cup so that's why I used.  This was GREAT.  Delicious, fast and easy (oh if only it was fat free, it would be perfect).  My whole family loved this desert.  I will be making it again.  Perfect combination of fruit, sweetness and crunchiness.  Thank you

YUM! I've always thought that crisp topping was the best part, so I love that this recipe doubles the topping. I thought the bottom part would get soggy, but it stayed firm and made dishing out servings easy. I used 4 bags of frozen berries (half blueberry, half blackberry), and drained them really well. I only used 1 cup of butter. I think the recipe could stand to use more cinnamon and nutmeg, will increase those ingredients next time around. So tasty, very easy to make.

This is DELICIOUS! I almost gave it 5 stars, but didn't since I changed a few things (and, I admit, I'm a little stingy with my stars:-)  First, we added about two and a half cups more berries than called for- about 5 1/2 cups fresh blackberries and a little over a cup of blueberries. I did not increase the sugar, though, and found that it was still plenty sweet. For the "crisp" I used about one and a half sticks of butter rather than two, and increased the oats by a bit, probably about a half cup. It needed to bake for about 15 minutes longer than suggested (probably since I added so many berries) and in the last few minutes I flipped on the broiler to crisp up the top a bit. I would highly recommend adding a few more berries than called for, but even w/o the addition this is a winning recipe, thanks for sharing!

I scaled down to 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar to save on calories.  Also, I used fresh peaches and blueberries.  It was good that night, but AMAZING after 2 days.

I prefer a crisp or cobbler with only a topping.  I thought having crisp on the bottom and top was just too much which masked the fruit flavor.  I also thought there was too much butter.

When I look for a dessert, I try to find one that is good for my two year old to help me with. This recipe was awesome in that sense. Everything was easy for him to help me with. By the time we were done preparing it for the oven, his face was berry stained :). I cut down the white sugar, which was a BIG mistake because the berries were more bitter than I estimated. In fact, I might add more sugar next time. I used blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and a few strawberries, all frozen. The crumble was delicious. I made the bottom layer super thick compared to the top so that it would hold better when cut. It also soaked up most of the berry juice so the dessert wasn't as runny as some other reviews stated. I needed a full hour for baking which is one of the reasons I'm leaving out a star. The nutmeg was overwhelming for us, next time I am using none. It's flavor didn't compliment the rest of the dish well in my opinion. I also used one cup butter and left out the other half.

I have about 6 recipes for various berry crisps. THEY ARE GOING IN THE TRASH because this is the only crisp that I will ever make in the future. It was really outstanding. I used just blueberries and raspberries - probably about 6 cups total. Pretty dessert, that tastes FANTASTIC. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will use again & again!

I would've given 5 starts because this turned out GREAT! I gave 4 because I added another cup or two of berries since I had so many lying around that needed to be used. Without the addition of these extra berries, I think the crust to berry ratio would've been to high. With the extra cup or so of berries, this recipe was just right. I did cut down the butter just a smidge and used about a cup, omitting the other half. The bottom crust was lovely, soft and chewy while the top crust was crisp and crunchy. All in all, aa real keepr! Just up the berries a bit and its a HIT!

Delicious!!!  I was craving a berry crisp and this definitely hit the spot.  I did halve the recipe for an 8x8 pan and the measurements were great, as is.  Although I did use frozen fruit since the fresh we have available right now is not great.  I used 3c. (2 bags) thawed/drained mixed berries and it was a perfect amount.  I did follow some recommendations and sprinkle the fruit with 1t. cornstarch since it was so wet.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I used 2 bags of frozen blueberries. This amount was perfect for a 9x13 crisp. I did not add sugar to the berries, though I wish I had. I think not only would the berries have been a bit sweeter, but the sugar helps to make a gooier berry layer. I tried only adding half the butter (3/4 C) as suggested in other recipes. This amount was not enough. I had a good amount of dry ingredients that remained uncooked on top of the berry layer. Next time I will either use a full cup of butter, or add some applesauce or nonfat yogurt to the dry ingredients.

A little too sweet for me so I'll definitely use less sugar next time but I loved the topping! The idea to put some on the bottom of the pan and then berries and then more topping is great!

I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this dessert. I was so excited to read everyone's enthusiastic comments....and mind you, I have a culinary arts degree....I followed this to a tee....baking is a science!  It was dry.  It had good flavor, but it was dry!  Too many crumbs...not enough juice to make it a cohesive, luscious dessert.  Might tweak it...might not.

OMG, I just made this and my husband and I finished up plates of warm-from-the-oven yumminess. We both agreed, this is to die for! And SO easy to make with a minimum of preparation. I used 4 cups fresh blueberries and 1 frozen cranberries. The cranberries added just a touch of tartness which I loved. I almost doubled the amount of cinnamon called for and used only 1 cup of real, unsalted butter. This turned out absolutely perfect. I think this will be the next dish I take to pass and one of the many functions I'm always attending.

This WAS excellent.  I had many compliments on it.  Like others suggested I used double the fruit and it was perfect.  You do need just the touch of some kind of sweetener on your fruit to bring out the juices.  Splenda works fine.

This recipe could use one improvement, that would be more fruit. The ratio of fruit to crisp was not right. Next time I will use a few more cups of fruit. I used black berries, raspberries and strawberries. I liked that the finished product wasn't too sweet ... it was perfectly balanced with sweetness and tartness. I didn't have butter so I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" baking sticks (basically margarine). It came out better than I thought even without the real butter. I will definitely make this again! Thx!

I halved this recipe because there are only 2 of us... I melted the butter to make it mix easier into the dry ingredients, and found that worked fabulously. I cut the butter to one stick for a 1\2 recipe, and used Whole Wheat flour... and I feel the butter was still a bit too much, but it tasted heavenly. I used fresh blackberries, blueberries and strawberries from my wholesale club, and I really liked the combo. I think next time i might use just strawberries and blueberries, and cut the butter back even further, adding some applesauce instead to keep it moist. Really good recipe. Love the idea of a top and bottom crumble!

This was very good.  I added at least an extra cup of berries and I think it could of handled even more.  This makes alot of crumble mixture.  I used splenda on the berries and smart balance butter. I diced up my butter and used my food processor to cut it into the flour mix.  Worked out great.  I used all 3 types of berries but the majority were blackberries.  This totally rocked with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Will make again for sure.

This was pretty good but not quite 5* worthy.  Seems like there should be more filling to compensate for the double crust.  I used frozen berries and the filling was just fine.  Will make again, but will double the filling.

I cut the recipe in half since there's only two of us. Used blueberries,strawberries and blackberries. So nice blend of sweet and tangy. Used plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg in the topping and only made the top layer. very quick and yummy! Ate it warm with vanilla ice cream, and the next day, cold with homemade whipped cream. Loved it, berries were fresh and didn't need sugar sprinkled on them  YUM!!!

This is one of the best crisps I know.  I have tried several different berries and they are all good.  Yesterday I made it with only fresh blueberries.  I didn't add the white sugar to them.  It didn't taste overly sweet.  It actually tasted healthy...lol

This was fantastic!  I used all blackberries for the recipe and cut the butter to one cup.  I served it with some whipped light cream.  It was so good!  My husband already asked when I was making another one!

WOW!! DELICIOUS!!  I did 1/3 less of the crumb mixture...only sprinkled on top. Could've done 1/2 recipe. EXCELLENT!! I don't want to stop eating it! Haven't taken to work yet, but I am SOO happy I did a small "tester" dish =) Will make again and again... **Used fresh raspberry & blueberrie. But only had frozen blackberries (do not thaw before baking). Wowza! =)

This was a super tasty and pretty dessert! I tweeked things a little for what we had in the fridge and b/c of other reviews. I only used 1 cup of butter, threw in a few more spices, cardamom was a complimentary flavor, and I subbed 2 tsp honey for white sugar in the fruit, which was a pint of blueberries, a cup of raspberries, a quart of strawberries, a quart of blackberries, and 2 fuji apples(so probably twice the fruit of the recipe). The apples gave it a great texture, and the two sticks of butter were just right. The whole family loved it and I'm sure it will grace our table many more times in the future. It did make a lot so we might half the recipe next time, but it was a perfect amount for a potluck or bbq. Thanks so much for this yummy recipe!!

I used 7 cups of thawed/drained frozen mixed berries, and reduced the butter to 1 cup, and then followed the rest of the recipe as written.  First, I can't imagine using much less fruit.  Any less would be too much of the crisp (delicious in it's own right, but would be imbalanced with the fruit amount).  As others stated, you can get by with the 1 cup of butter.  I don't think it would be ruined with using 1-1/2 cups, just may change the texture a little and taste a little richer.  Whichever you prefer depends on your love or hate of butter.  With 1 cup, the crisp still held together.  I probably would continue using the 1 cup (or possibly splurge with 1-1/4) just because it works, tastes great, and cuts out some calories/fat.  Definitely use your food processor to cut the butter into the dry mix! It's so much easier than by hand. The end product was good, I wouldn't say the best I've ever had.  I think fresh fruit may be better than frozen, but the frozen technically works fine.  I liked the crisp part (very good with ice cream), and it is true that it forms kind of an oatmeal bar when you let it cool and solidify.

If this recipe had been labeled as an oatmeal fruit bar, it would have been fine. However, there was so little fruit when compared to the topping that it was dry and not what I would consider a fruit crisp. If I do it again, I would at least double, if not triple the amount of fruit used. Also, the toping was too rich and buttery, would probably also decrease the amount of butter used.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, and it is the perfect blustery-day pleasure.  I always halve amount of crust, use just a half-cup of butter, and double the berries -- it's just amazing.  Especially good with only blackberries.

Sorry but this was much too greasy and sweet. I made it just as the recipe directs with fresh berries. It was an expensive mistake. With adjustments it could be a much better crisp. Less sugar and butter.....say half of the butter and 2/3 of the sugar.

I made this for my husband’s birthday and he absolutely loved it!  The only thing is I made it with fresh blueberries and frozen raspberries and blackberries because it was too expensive to buy the amount of fresh raspberries and blackberries I needed.  The berry crisp still came out great using the frozen berries.

I also reduced the butter by half; any more would have been way too much.  I used a mix of fresh and frozen fruit and it turned out great.  Next time, I will add even more fruit because I found there was too little to go with the crumble.

My absolute favorite recipe for a berry crisp. I have made it using the three different berries, with just blackberries, with just bluberries, and finally a combination of bluberries and nectarines. Comes out perfect everytime. I have also found that using margarine gives a chewier crisp as compared to a more crumbly crisp when using butter.

Excellent recipe!  I served it warm with a little whipped cream and it's a great summer treat.  Easy to cut the recipe in half and bake in 9x9 pan  - a little goes a long way.

This is very delicious and super easy to make. I took it to a cook out at a friend's and made it ahead of time. The only thing I didn't do was bake it and threw it in their oven just as we finished up dinner. It was yummy just out of the oven and worked out great!

OMG, this was soooooooooo good!  I cut the recipe in half, used frozen 3 berry mixture and it turned out even better then I expected.  Everyone loved it!  Will definitely be making this again.  The texture and everything was perfect even though I used frozen berries.  Excellent!!!

Very good, although it was not crisp. I used peaches, sweet cherries and blueberries, which worked out beautifully. I also  reduced the butter by 1/2 cup with no disastrous  consequences.

I decided to use all blueberries for this recipe & also halved the recipe.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon & allspice on the blueberries, and made individual servings using ramekins.  Makes a nice presentation when you're entertaining.

Yummy!  Have already made this twice in 3 days, it's really good and not so bad for you as far as desserts go, as long as you cut down the butter and sugar and increase the berries which is what I did.  It turned out great even with less of the good stuff.  I also used a mix of frozen berries that I thawed and they were perfect (blueberries, raspberries and marionberries) Thanks for sharing.

Tastes awesome, but my crust was a little soggy/gooey on the bottom.  I think next time I'd bake the bottom crust a little before adding the other layers.

Our whole family loves this crisp!  During the summer we made double batches of the crumbly topping mixture so we always had some on hand ready to bake after our weekly trips to the farmer's market for fresh berries.  My sister and my dad also say this is their favorite recipe for fruit crisp now - and at 88, my dad's eaten his share of crisps in his lifetime! :-)

YUM! Loosely halved the recipe (used 2 3/4 cups berries), used just fresh blueberries, only 1/2 cup butter (salted as it was all I had), dark brown sugar, and pulsed the crumble part in the food processor to blend (I hate cutting in butter by hand), and sprinkled sugar on top per another user's suggestion and had wonderful results. This is a very forgiving/versatile recipe. I've never made a crisp before that tasted great even w/out ice cream or whipped cream.

This was delicious. I liked how you could still make out the berries in their somewhat original form while you were eating.  There has got to be a way to cut down on the butter though.  Spray the bottom of the pan with PAM.

Have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it. I also used fresh peaches instead of the berries and it comes out just as wonderful. Very easy to make and best if still warm. The only thing I do different is that I do not make the bottom crust and just put all the crumble on top.

Hello, I followed recipe but instead of rolled oats I used 1 cup organic pumpkin seed granola  but any granola would do plus I use a porridge mix which is oats, oat bran, what bran and flax seed. I used 1/2 the room temp butter and then used mixed berry unsweetened applesauce and regular applesauce and turned that into dry ingredients. Crust is sweet and soft but still chewy.  Before I started mixing my berries I took three apples that were getting a bit soft, sliced and cut them up, drizzled maple syrup over apples and sprinkled some cinnamon over top and baked apple pieces in 350 degrees oven, in same corningware that I would later bake the entire fruit in, for 15 min.

I am an organic gluten free baker. I made this last night and all of my guests (myself included) LOVED this crisp.
I simply substituted the flour for the Nameste organic GF flour and the organic frozen berries that I buy at Costco.

I just made this recipe for the first time. I have never made a crisp or cobbler before. I didn't have brown sugar and had to make my own (added molasses to white sugar). I used 2x blueberries and 1x raspberries because my Sweetie hates blackberries. 

Other than altering the fruit I followed the recipe exactly. The recipe didn't say what kind of butter to use so I used unsalted. 

The flavor is perfect. It's not too tart and not too sweet. There's not too much topping. It's not too crunchy or soggy. I absolutely love it and will definitely be making it again!

I made this recipe according to the directions, and it was very, very good.  Some things I noted this time around and would change or make sure to do next time: 1) grease the pan and 2) use about 5 cups of THAWED berries, if using frozen.  I didn't grease the pan, and the bottom layer was next to impossible to get out of the pan.  I used almost a whole bag of frozen triple berry mix from Costco and discovered that 5 cups of frozen berries does not equal 5 cups of thawed berries.  I ended up having to thaw more berries.  No big deal, but I'm just pointing it out just in case someone else needs that information.  Everyone loved this one, though!

This was great.  Used only blueberries as I had a huge container from Costco.  I've never seen a crisp recipe where the topping was used on the bottom as well, but we really liked it.  I halved this recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  I used about 3 cups of berries and a half stick of butter.  Will make again!

This was SO EASY. I used others' recommendations and cut the (unsalted) butter and brown sugar to 1 c each. Doubled the spices, added 1/2 tsp of sea salt. 3 c frozen blueberries, 3 c frozen chopped peaches, omitted the extra sugar in with the fruit. Softened/melted the butter before mixing it into the dry mixture in my KitchenAid. Allowed the frozen fruit to sit out for about an hour on the counter. Baked for 35 minutes. The verdict: delicious, especially still warm with vanilla ice cream. A bit too sweet, though - next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar even more, maybe all the way to 1/2 c.

Really good berry crisp recipe.  Would work well with whatever berries you have on hand.  I made this recipe exactly as posted and it was delicious.  It wasn't too sweet and it was nice and crispy.

VERY sweet. This was really good IF you like sweet. However, I would recommend making it without the sugar tossed in the berries, with less sugar in the topping, and less butter. My husband & I had to scrape the crisp off the top to be able to eat it because is was so sweet! Overall pleasing for company, but way too sweet, even for my incredibly sweet-tooth!

Was good, but there is too much topping. The topping tastes a bit too much like brown sugar for my personal taste, but beyond that it was great. I think I will go back to my original recipe.

this was excellent!!!  i agree that you need either twice the quantity of berries of half the amount of crisp topping because there was A LOT of topping to go around!  i also followed other reviewers suggestion by cutting the amount of butter in half...and believe me...there was still PLENTY of buttery goodness.  baked it for the full 40 minutes and just when we took it out, the berry juices were boiling and oozing out of the crisp topping.  so good.  served it with homemade mascarpone ice cream...to die for!  thanks for the recipe!

I made the mistake of decreasing the amount of butter (upon other reviewers' suggestions) and much to my dismay.  While it was still good, there's a reason the proportions are written as they are--do NOT alter the recipe by reducing the amount of butter as it will make it slightly crumbly and dry!  The recipe is amazing as is!

Make this your family's favorite dessert instantly by making it once.  I was suspicious about having a bottom layer of crisp when my daughter-in-law made this for me last fall, but I wont do it any other way now.  My mother and mother-in-law were over for dinner when I first served this at home.  They both wondered why we haven't been making crisp this way forever.  This is a fantastic recipe.

I prepared this exactly as the recipe said. It was very good. I love the top and bottom Crisp. My guests enjoyed it as well. However, the crisp was a bit rich, I would reduce the butter as others suggested when I make it next time. I will make it again.

I made this with frozen Saskatoons. It was not very good. Not nearly as good as the Saskatoon Berry pie recipe. If I were to try this again, I would add more berries and less crumb crust. The whole thing just turned out quite dry. Perhaps a different fruit would have been better.

This was good, I scaled it down to make with just two containers of blackberries. I will use this recipe next time I make a crisp, it was so good we finished it! I served with whipped cream spiked with Grand Marnier.

Pretty good, but no rave reviews. (I used fresh blackberries). Next time I would use a little more than half the crust mixture on bottom.

This is a great recipe!  I reduced it to serve 12, and modified it by using 2 c. frozen peaches with 1 c. frozen mixed berries. I thawed the fruit and drained it.  I mixed the fruit with 1 T. flour and 2dded 1 tablespoon of flour and 2 T and 1 t sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon.  I added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the crust mixture, pulsed it a few times in the food processor, and added 1/2 t cinnamon and  1 cup of melted butter.  I spooned about half the crust in a casserole dish, added the fruit, and spooned the remainder on top.  Baked at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes.  It came out perfect!!

very nice, easy recipe.  easy to variate the berries you like or in season. I added a little bit of vanilla, a touch of cinnamon & a touch of nutmeg to the berry mixture, and used my fresh raspberries from the yard,blackberries & blueberries were frozen and it was delicious. I did add about a tablespoon of Minute Tapioca to the berry mixture to thicken it a bit as frozen berries can be a little watery.   I used rolled oats the first time and it was a little "chewy??", then tried it again and used quick oats, fresh sliced apples & cinnamon (for an apple crisp) and it was much better the quick oats did not overwhelm the "crisp topping" as the rolled oats did. I did find that when I used it for the Apple Crisp the bottom soaked up too much of the juice so if you use it with Apples only, either make a very thin bottom layer, or (like I will in the future)  only use it for a crisp topping, this did not happen with the berries, they had plenty of juice with a bottom and top crisp layer.   As usual practice and experment to find what works for you. Like I said this recipe is versatile, use whatever fruit/berry you like, it works. 
 Enjoy everyone.

Excellent!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Even people who don't usually like fruit, loved this recipe!  I'm making it again this weekend.

I made this for the first time for an annual get-together of online friends.  It was a real hit!  I liked it because it was easy to make.  The blackberries made it really special---I don't usually use them for cooking.  I will be making this for other special occasions, too!

OMG.  This is AMAZING.  I halved the recipe and thank goodness I had the sense to stop myself  from eating the entire thing.  It is so DELICIOUS! I made it entirely with frozen raspberries and the only thing I changed was that I omitted nutmeg because I dislike it and I didn't quite use as much butter as it called for -- since I halved the recipe, I used 3/4 of a stick of butter instead of the entire stick.  Also, I baked it for 40 minutes and wanted the top to be a little browner, so I put the broiler on for a minute or so to get  it nice and brown.  Oh my, it is complete HEAVEN!  I will be adding this to my recipe book for SURE.   It is the perfect marriage of tart  and sweet --- not too sweet and with a nice tart edge.  It tastes like a cobbler to me -- it's just so dang YUMMY!!!!!!!

I scaled this recipe down a bit for a smaller pan and used thawed frozen berries. Personally, I think the texture of the frozen berries was beneficial for this recipe. The crisp turned out beautiful, perfectly crispy, and delicious. The berry mixture was yummy and not too sweet. I used exact proportions that the recipe called for even with scaling down, and I did wish that there had been more berry filling. But that is easily fixed the next time I make this by simply adding more berries, because I'll definitely be making it again! It was well-received by my husband and was a favorite at a BBQ.

I make this in the summertime for BBQ and backyard parties. It is delightful and summery, but also good in the Autumn because of the spiciness from cinnamon and nutmeg. I always add a little bit extra of the spices and make a bit more of the topping to evenly coat the whole pan. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Also, this is good to bake a day in advance and warm back up in the oven for a few minutes and tastes just as fresh! Very good left over.

Delicious!!! I didn't have enough berries, so I used 3 cups of chopped apples and 2 cups strawberries.  I mixed 1 Tbs almond extract in with fruit, and follwed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Will definately make this again!

This turned out pretty good I didn't give it 5 stars because I was a little turned off by the texture the oats provided but my bf & my friends LOVED this. 
I used a frozen berry mixture, which worked out really well. I also threw in a dash of allspice to bump up the flavor a little.

WOW!  I love Ina Gartens crisp and always will, but this one is heavenly!  The crisp on the top and bottom is delightful, not overpowering as one might think.  I made exactly as written (heavy handed on the fruit) and received rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

This was spectacular! My style of cooking is a bit of this and dash of that-I just can't seem to follow a recipe to the letter-so naturally I added more berries, simply because I had more in the fridge. My guy ate almost the whole pan in less than 12 hours! Even got requests from his parents! Suggestion-use pastry cutter-and cold butter-trying to get it to crumb without one took forever and made a huge mess.

This was really good except for I had way too much crisp topping for it..There was a bunch extra that wouldn't brown up on top because it was too thick..maybe I didn't put enough butter or something..but they were still good..we just had to brush off a little topping before eating..my boyfriend loved them..he thought they tasted like really awesome nutri-grain bars..I think that's because I ended up cooking them longer to try and brown the crust!

My crisp was crisp,but not as crisp as I wanted!Didnt know if 3 sticks of butter was right: seemed too much butter, but I guess thats the right measurement for 1 1/2 cup!? It was all still yummy though as far as flavors blended together in the end result and berries tart and sweet were GR8:)I even ate the crumbly stuff by itself:P YUMMY snack alone!!

I wanted a fruit crisp for plums, peaches and nectarines and I liked the mix of oats, brown sugar for this one. It was amazing and so fragrant while cooking. There was none left from the potluck i made it for. Delish!!! I will make with berries when i have a stock of them.

I used 1 cup each blackberries and blueberries and 2 c. raspberries (personal preference for raspberries.  Berries are in season so I used fresh.  I cut the other ingredients in 1/2, except the butter where I used 1 stick (1/2 c) and the nutmeg where I only used a dash (I think too much nutmeg is not a good seasoning for berries).  I put 1/3 of the crumb mixture on the bottom and 2/3 on top and cooked it in a deep dish pie/quiche pan.  It was delicious with Cool Whip or with ice cream.  Brought it to a friend's house for dinner and it was a big hit.

I made it according to the recipe and thought it needed more fruit.  I made it again with twice the amount of fruit and sugar, and it was fabulous.  I'm making several to serve at my son's rehearsal dinner.

I also love the idea of the fruit being in between.  My kids loved it too!  I took someone else suggestion and cut the sugar...turned out fine.  I also took the suggestion to cut the butter in half but the topping was too dry.  Maybe use 3/4 of the amount of butter suggested.  Still great!!

I substituted sugar substitute  except for 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make it more  'diet' friendly. It was very well received.

This recipe took me back to my Grandmother's kitchen, I loved the flavor and I followed the recipe as written, except I used all blackberries. You can count on this recipe being used over abd over here.

This was very good!  I scaled it down to 6 servings, which worked great.  I served it with vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream and that was richly yummy!

Very good dessert, perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I cut the sugar in half and only used about 5 tablespoons of margarine. A quick spray of butter Pam across the top layer before I popped it in the oven the made it plenty crisp.

The first time I made this recipe, I used sweet cherries.  I thought it was incredibly good.  The second time I used a combination of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.  Although I liked it, it was just a bit tart.  My husband thought it was much too tart.   I think the amount of sugar needs to be varied depending on the type of berry used, and probably for my berry combination should have had another 2 T of white sugar.

Was mushy and tart, not good at all...would not ever make again.  Followed recipe exactly except I did half it, so maybe that is why?

Where has this recipe been all my life? This is one of the absolute best desserts I have ever made, hands down. I just try to ignore the butter-to-fruit ratio :)  I used 1-1/4 c of butter rather than 1-1/2, and I think you could easily make it one cup and not miss a thing. I think I'll also use a bit more fruit next time, although I think if you followed the recipe exactly you would be very happy with the results. Simple, great for summer produce, and one I will make for company and potlucks from here on out.

I made this with frozen berries, which does soak the bottom layer a little bit but otherwise works fine.  I just put them in purely frozen.  The white sugar doesn't stick to the berries too well that way though, and I only used half as much anyway.  The raspberries give it a particular tartness that makes me wish I had used the full amount of sugar.  I followed the advice of several reviewers and cut the brown sugar and butter to one cup each. Overall, a tasty crisp (and my first ever).

Really good, have made it several times. Works with a layer of apples, I added apple pie spice and left a little bit thicker flour/oatmeal layer on top to get a good crisp.

My reaction to this recipe:  Me saying "ehh"...(picture me with my lip curled up and my nose scrunched after i took my first bite). I made this last night for some friends who were coming over for dessert and game night...and they thought it was just "ok" too. What a bummer to make something for guests & it NOT turn out yummy(I chose it because it was rated really high). I was highly disappointed I spent time & money to make this (berries arent cheap when they are fresh)... this recipe uses too much butter (cut it in half people)... there's not enough sugar (use 2-3 times as much, and add a touch of salt)... the flour/butter/brown sugar/oats part of the recipe turned MUSHY (i cooked it for 45 min and it was still a blob of mush)...for sure...not worth it.  Im not sure why this recipe got so many good ratings... maybe those who rated it have never tasted a GOOD berry crisp? My advice: try a different recipe than this one so you wont be disappointed too.

Really good! I used frozen berries (blueberries, raspberries and blackberries) and let them thaw out for about 30 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the nutmeg which I didn't have!) and it turned out great. The bottom crust is a bonus! Got lots of compliments. Hated to admit how easy this was to make. This will stay in my recipe box for sure!

I baked this in my cafe in Germany today. I've never baked a crisp before but blueberries are on sale and I found this recipe.  I made it with only blueberries and added an extra 400gr, almost 2 cups. I stayed with the original amount of sugar, Germans don't like their desserts too sweet. I also 'make' my own brown sugar by mixing white and molasses and I only used one cup.  If you use the recommended amount of butter it will crisp beautifully w/o having to spray the top with aerosol oil (as previous reviewer recommended).  Next time I will double the amount of crisp so I can have a nice thick crust on the bottom ( it will cut and serve better that way) and a bit more on top. I am so pleased to have found a good crisp recipe that I can use with all berries and that's easy to make. I'm going to try making it in 2 pie pans next time.

This was so easy to make and really tastes great.  I did cut back on the butter as was suggested (used a little less than a cup), will probably use 1 cup next time as the topping was just a little dry.  I also didn't add the sugar to the berries and that was fine.  The only other change I made was to use half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  The bottom crust is a nice change. Its almost more like a bar than a crisp. Next time I'll also increase the berries to 2 cups of each.  Will definitely make these again.  They are good served hot or cold.

I made this today for Independence Day.  I divided it into two separate smaller baking pans.  I also used 4 different berries: strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.  It turned out very well.

I was looking for something easy for a last minute dessert and this came out great. I used frozen blueberries and frozen tart cherries that I had in the freezer. I also added finely chopped pecans to the oat mixture. It was a big hit with everyone, served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I reduced the amount of crust because of several comments.  Even though the cobbler turned out terrific, I wish I had made more crust.  I used 1/2  blueberries and 1/2 peaches, about 6 cups total.  I also reduced the butter to one cup and melted it. What a terrific recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

I had friends coming over and thought this would be good.  I didn't have any fresh fruit so I used two cans of pie filling (Peach and strawberry) and left out the sugar and the nutmeg. It was awesome!  I'll use this recipe a lot!

My 9 year old daughter and I made this last night.  It was the BEST crisp we have ever made!!  My only change was I used a squirt of honey on the berries instead of the sugar.  We ate it warm with vanilla bean ice cream on top-SO YUMMY!!

I'm a big fan of all things fruit, so the fact this had three berries told me it was a match made in heaven. At first I thought making a 9 X 13 pan for two people was going to be a bit much, but after just finishing my plate I think I'll be able to polish this off in a few days with the wife's help!

The frozen fruit got a bit juicy (after it thawed out) so I added 1 TBSP of cornstarch to thicken it up.  Also added 1 tbsp. of fresh lemon juice to brighten up the fruit flavor. Delicious!

I use frozen berries, don't add any sugar to the fruit, use only half of the brown sugar, and about a quarter cup of butter. Still tastes sweet enough, and it's healthier.

I was looking for a fruit crisp recipe that was in-between a crisp and a cobbler. This recipe looked perfect. I did read the reviews and noticed that a few said it was too much butter, but I like butter and butter crusts, and decided to use the full 1 1/2 cups. I'm sorry to say that it was too buttery and heavy for our family. By heavy, I mean that I could only eat a few fork fulls and felt full. The butter was overpowering and each bite felt like an anchor in my stomach.

This was really quick to put together for weeknight dinner guests.  I used frozen mixed berries as someone recommended.  I did find the bottom crust a bit much - it was so gooey.  Next time I'd just do a really thin layer on the bottom and more on the top.  Oh, and I cut back on the butter a bit.

This was very good! Made with fresh white peaches instead of berries. & served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Changes:
Used 1 1/2 cups rolled oats & 1 cup all-purpose flour.  Also, I reduced the amount of butter to 3/4 cup.

I took the advice from other reviews and melted the butter before mixing it in. Made the mixture much more even, and was easier on the arms!!

I have made this recipe serveral times just as the recipe states. It is terrific! I don't see any reason to change anything. I love how crunchy and crispy the topping is. I have only had a chance to eat it warm; I know I won't get any if it cools off. It dissapears so quickly. I used 5 cups of Huckleberries. I did have to cook it closer to 1 hour. Probably my location.

This is an excellent recipe, Thanks.  We also cut back the butter to one cup, but also feel that we need to double the sugar for the fruit probably because we used fresh blackberries and blueberries. Great crisp recipe.

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it! I made it with fresh picked blackberries, a small amount of red fleshed plum and blueberries and substituted 2 sticks of butter with a cup of canola oil to reduce the saturated fat content. It still had a scrumptious buttery taste.

Excellent recipe! I cut the whole recipe in half (but used more than half the original amount of berries) and used an 8x8 pan. On the advice of another reviewer I reduced the amount of butter for the crisp and it came out just fine. I can't imagine how rich and buttery it would have been with all that butter. Not necessary! I used all blueberries..they are in season right now and the grocery store had a sale so I went with it! I would love to try this recipe with strawberries and peaches and maybe rhubarb too. The idea to put half the crisp on the bottom, cover with fruit and then sprinkle the rest of the crisp on top was a great one. The crisp ended up being held together and almost pie-like instead of wet fruit underneath a thick layer of crisp. I also added a few tsp of cornstarch to the berries so they wouldn't come out too juicy. Next time I will use brown sugar in the berries instead of white and also toss in a little lemon juice. Had this still warm from the oven with a big blob of cool whip. Yum!! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Definitely a keeper!

Oh Good Heavens, this is soooo yummy!  With every bite, my guests "ooohed" and "aahed."  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and just softened the butter and mixed it right in, instead of cutting it in.  It worked perfectly, and this crust/topping is amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars all the way!!  This was excellent and so easy to make.  I did reduce the butter to only 1 cup and increased the berries to about 5 cups as suggested in other reveiws.  When cutting in the butter, make sure it's very cold or even frozen beforehand or you won't get the crispness on top.  If the butter tends to get soft while you're cutting it into the mix, just turn on the broiler for a few minutes after it's thourghly cooked.

We reduced the butter to 1c, I can't imagine adding all of it.  I will increase the fruit next time (frozen worked well) to 7c. and might even decrease the crisp portion.  Very good though!  Very good.  Thanks!

MMMM YUMMY!!! The best crisp recipe ever!  I also used less butter, more berries and more spices.  Also added a little instant tapioca so the blackberries wouldn't run all over the place.  I will use this as my "base" recipe for fruit crisp from now on.

Didn't like this recipe at all.  Too much topping, and what goes on the bottom didn't seem to work well.  I used raspberries and there was not enough sugar, the crisp was very tart, not enough fruit, and too much topping made it too heavy.

I made this tonight for dessert.  I love berries and a crumbly, crispy top....so this was a dream for me.  I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, thawed of course.  It was delicious and easy!!!  I served it with whipped cream, next time we'll have it with vanilla ice cream.

The crumble topping on this is excellent and works well with either frozen or fresh berries.  Easy to make and very versatile.  I sometimes add leftover pineapple or chop up a Granny Smith apple.  Whatever you like, you can add.  There are never any leftovers.  I used the recipe as is-five stars!  As is plus other types of fruit-five stars.

Wow!  This was the perfect dessert.  I have made many crisps and cobblers and this by far, was the best.  I made it with blueberries, frozen raspberries and peaches and it was just to die for.  There was the perfect amount of crisp and putting half on the bottom was a great idea.  I will make this again and again with various fruits.  Thank you for this great recipe.

This was a big hit! I added a little extra cornstarch to ensure that it wasn't too runny, but I think it would have been fine without it. Definitely use fresh berries if possible.

I used 3 12 oz. bags of frozen mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries) but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved this and really raved about it, but next time I think I will make less crust and also use less butter  (I think you can definitely cut 1/2 c. without any problems, maybe more).

This was delicious. A few changes though, I cut down the butter by about half and added two tablespoons of mayonnaise. I know it sounds weird, but the mayo adds a bit of a tang to the crust. I also used fresh blueberries and all natural raspberry preserves (its much cheaper).

I have made this twice and love how versible it is. Both times I have used a mixture of fresh and frozen fruit, everything from cranberries to blueberries. The last time I didn't remember to let the butter soften so I melted it on the stove and poured it in, and it still came out great. One pan is never enough!

I tried to go for the extra berries to balance out the "too crusty" comments I'd read, and ended up using a 16 oz. pkg of frozen raspberries, thawed, with another frozen 16 oz. pkg of mixed berries (blueberry, strawberry, and blackberry) and 1 cup of blueberries (both the cup and mixed berry pkg frozen).  I tossed 2 tbsp of flour with the berries in addition to just the 4 tbsp of sugar, thinking the flour would cut down on the liquids, but not so much :D  Still, my co-workers & I enjoyed the great blend of tart + not too sweet + crunchy -- next time, I'll thaw all the berries, and hopefully no liquids next time!

Very good!  I used frozen blackberries and strawberries, turned out great.  I also cut the butter by 1/2 cup.  Will certainly add this to my recipe box.

AWESOME!  I only used 1 cup of butter and may use less next time.  I also threw in a handful of chopped pecans to make the crisp crunchier and it was SO DELISH!!!

Delicious! The first time I made it, felt it was too rich.  I cut butter down to 1/2 cup, and found the topping crisps up better, and is not too rich.

Wow - what a delicious dessert.  I used blueberries and raspberries in mine.  I served it up with vanilla ice cream - makes a big pan - would be great for company.  Mmm...

Excellent!  We enjoyed this with pitted chopped cherries, blueberries, and raspberries.  I like a little more fruit and a little less topping but will definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor! I would increase the amount of berries. I used 4 cups of berries and 1/2 the topping and still would have liked more berries.

Mmmm..this was yummy.  I used only blackberries and peaches and it came out delicious.  I bet it would be great with apples and cinnamon too!  If you're a real texture person, you may want to omit the crumble on the bottom.  It does come out a little 'soggy-ish.'  For me, I love the crumble the best and mix it all up anyway, so it was superb!

Loved this recipe for a summer dessert. We live in the NW and I made it at the height of blackbery season. The first time I used blackberries, blueberries and peaches and the second time I used the 3 berries. I actually preferred it with the peaches, but it was awesome both times. And much easier to make than a cobbler. I'll probably try this winter with some apples and pears.

I gave this five stars but I changed a bit by adding six cups of berries and used 1/4 cup white sugar.  I can't imagine using any less.  I used blackberries, blueberries and peaches.  Very tasty and many compliments warm with ice cream. I made the crisp just as called for in the recipe and it was perfect...we thought!

Great, easy recipe! Used strawberries, raspberries and blueberries.  Cut the recipe in half and used a regular pie dish.  Came out looking great and was a snap to put together.  Don't think it was too sweet but I think it depends on the berries you're using.  Served with vanilla ice cream. Good rewarmed in the microwave the next day too.

Delicious!  The menfolk particularly enjoyed it.  I changed the recipe around a little, since I used only blackberries - I did 5 1/2 c. berries, 3/4 c. sugar in the berries, decreased the brown sugar a little, doubled the cinnamon, and cut the butter in half.  That worked beautifully  - it wasn't really sour but it still tasted all over like blackberries.  Thanks for the recipe; definitely something to do again!

This was too sickningly sweet for me...I was hoping for a lot of berry taste, but for all the berries it uses, it makes even more crust, and the crust is heavy and sweet.  I will half the crust next time.

My husband loved this cobbler. I found the topping a little greasy because of the butter. Maybe I used too much. It was delicious warm with some whipped cream or vanilla bean ice cream. This is a good recipe and I would make it again, but watching the butter I add to the topping.

I used frozen berries because fresh berries are extremely expensive around here in the middle of winter and it was absolutely fantastic. Next time I will probably double the amount of berries to make it more of a deep-dish crisp - mine came out looking a little like a bar cookie because of the relatively small amount of berries.  It still tasted wonderful though!

Best berry crisp recipe ever!  I made it exactly like the recipe reads except for an extra 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon (I love cinnamon).  It turned out perfectly.  Better the next day after it's been in the fridge for a while.  Vanilla bean ice cream is a great on top.  My family and I love it soo much that I made it three times in one week.  The first time with just marion berries, then with raspberries, then with boysenberries.  Each time it was fabulous and I got quite a few compliments and requests for a copy of the recipe.  The boysenberries had more juice in them than the other two berries, so it was quite a bit of juice on the bottom.  I just poured it on top over the ice cream.  YUMMY!!!!!!  Thank you Polly for an awsome recipe.

My husband only wanted Blueberries and I couldn't find my usualy recipe. I used frozen blueberries for this. It was pretty good.  I loved that there was twice the "crisp" part, though the bottom was very "crisp".  Next time I think I'll cook the bottom a bit before adding the fruit and the topping.  And I will definatley use fresh berries next time.  I doubled the sugar and they still didn't taste sweet.

Didn't make a single change,  used frozen berries,  and everyone absolutely LOVED it, even my sister who hates anything with oats in it!  Super simple to put together,  and you'll probably already have most of these ingredients in your pantry and fridge!

I love the flavor of all the fruits and also the top-bottom crust concept. My question is this:  even though the crust and topping are good - should you pound out the oats a little first?  I did not. I just added the Quaker Oats as indicated but now when we bite into it, it does feel like I'm having to chew the oats extra well. We just took it out of the oven and practically burned our tongues trying to get the first bite - so maybe after it sits for a bit, it will get softer.  Loved the favors though - yum (I did add more berries than called for per other reviews and I definitely think that is a good call but it makes it more of a "fruit cobbler" rather than a "crisp").  That is just totally personal preference.

Absolutely LOvED this recipe! Came out just as expected. I did have to Cook it a little bit longer but I think it was because I might have used more berries than the recipe called for. I made it with fresh berries. I had bought berries on sale and needed to use them up before they spoiled. This was the BEST way to do that.

I love that this recipe layers the fruit between the crisp layers. I followed the recipe for the crisp part but I had frozen fruit I had to use up. I had strawberries, blueberries, peaches and raspberries. It was delicious. A new go to for crisp.

I reviewed this already, but because it make SO much, we had tons left over.  It didn't heat up in the microwave very well, so tried something different.  I cut it in an inch or two wide and about three inches long. Then put a slice each in a fry pan with a bit of almond oil in medium high and browned in each side   When they were nicely coloured, I plated them up and topped with spoonful of whipped cream.    Oh my goodness. Heavenly!  honest, you will love this,  this way. So, so good

Great dessert! Pairs heavenly with vanilla ice cream. I make this with whatever kind of frozen berries I need to use up (blueberries, triple berry mix, strawberry-raspberry...) You do not need to add sugar to the fruit mix. This will only be good for 1-day max after cooking as the bottom gets soggy if it sits around longer than that.

This was very easy to make and it tasted great, but it was really watery. There should have been something to firm up the berry mixture. I used only blackberries and raspberries and it was fabulous. I'd make it again but I'd use some sort of thickening agent to firm it up.

I found fresh berries at my local Fred Meyer, delicious! Everyone loved it, my sister even asked me to make a small one to take to college.

I made homemade whipped cream with it and adjusted the butter to 1 cup.
Also make sure not to melt the butter, just soften.

Notes for next time: I cut the butter to 1 c.; that was good.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1 c. and omitted the white sugar w/ the fruit.  There was not enough sugar; don't omit the white sugar with the fruit next time.

I did not make any changes!  I have been making this since 2011 and it is a great recipe - especially for a group!  It is way easy and pretty fool proof!

I made this exactly according to the recipe instructions using frozen berries.  I did not let them thaw and did not rinse them in the strainer, etc.  I just measured them out frozen and proceeded with the recipe instructions.  The crisp was delicious and was a big hit with my family.  I will be making this again.  Very quick and tasty dessert -- especially with vanilla ice cream on top.

This was super yummy on a cold winter night! I used frozen berries & should have let them completely thaw before assembling & baking. It came out not as bubbly as it should have. We ate it with partially melted vanilla ice cream with some milk poured into it so it wouldn't be so dry. My husband and three kids enjoyed it who are 12,8, & 4!

I have made this a couple of times with different berry combos and it's ok. I think we might like it better if I cut back a little on the oats. We usually like oats but for some reason this just seemed to have a little bit too much. I did cut down the amount of butter the second time so that is probably why they were a tad dry. It did taste good enough that its worth making the effort to tweak it.

I'm not sure what went wrong. It looked so beautiful when I took it out the oven. I followed the recipe but the berries produced so much juice while baking that when I put some in a bowl it was almost a chunky soup texture. It tasted good but it looked just like oatmeal with berries in it.

FANTASTIC recipe for berry crisp. I would highly recommend making this in the late summertime when all of these berries are in season and at the peak of ripeness. Served up with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream, this recipe is a favorite of both my fiance and I. We're seriously considering making this for our wedding next summer in lieu of a wedding cake. We're calling it a 'marital crumble' haha 

Only adjustment I sometimes make is adding the juice from half a lemon to the fruit - adds an extra tang and somehow just makes the fruit flavours blend together even better. I would also agree with the tip about melting the butter before blending it into the other ingredients, makes it a lot easier to mix it all together. Just add a little bit at a time! 

Thanks poster! We have made this a bunch of times now and it comes out wonderfully each time we make it. :)

Just made this with frozen berries and it turned out delicious. Did not use the white sugar and glad I didnt. It was a bit watery using frozen berries but that's ok. I can't wait to make this again with peaches.

Wonderful!  I used maybe an extra cup of fruit and it still came out great.  The thing that makes this, to me, is that it has such a great texture.  It's not like many crisps that get soggy when made.  Definitely making this again!

That was dang good! Better than pie! Used fresh picked blackberries for first time. Will be using other fruits and be making this again! Used approx 6-7 cups of berries and increased sugar and spices by half. Cut butter down to one cup...will try as originally written next time, to compare. Did as another user suggested and melted butter in pan. Worked well.

Just tasted this and if I have never done anything else right in my life, at least I made this. It was incredibly easy to make and the flavor is incomparable. I did read some user reviews and decided to up the fruit to about 6 cups. I used fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries- about two cups of each and I substituted the plain white sugar for organic pure cane sugar which has a bit of a mapley taste. Also, I left out the nutmeg because apparently I have none, and halved the cinnamon. Final note- despite the butter criticism I decided to go with the full 1.5 cups and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely be using this recipe for the rest of my life.

Wowowowow! I increased fruit- I'd recommend 6-7 cups. I did 2 cups blackberries, 1.5 raspberries, about 1/2-3/4 cup of a hybrid peach/apricot/plum, and 1 cup chopped fresh cherries, and more fruit wouldn't have been too much.  I substituted coconut oil for the butter, and despite thinking 1.5 cups was insane, stuck with the recipe there. 
Huge success. Will definitely be making again.  Next time I may cut back a bit on the fat, and I want to experiment with some gluten-free subs, so my celiac-afflicted sister can try it.

I just made this today with fresh blackberries, raspberries (red and white), and blueberries from the farmers market. I only used 1 cup of butter thought because 1.5 seemed like so much. It mixes much better if you just dig your hands in to get a good butter to oats/flour consistency. I love the crumble as much as the fruit so for me its a perfect amount. I cooked this in two 8X8 pans. My daughter had two girls over for a play-date and we (including her little sister) just finished off one of the pans by ourselves! We topped it with whipped cream- and one child even tried it with a scoop of marshmallow fluff! Yummy!

I was looking for something to do with an overstock of strawberries and blueberries that were getting soft but weren't spoiled or anything. I also added some raspberries and it came out wonderfully. I used the rest of what I had left in brown sugar, don't think it was a cup and a half and it was plenty sweet. I was able to fit everything very nicely in a 11 x 7 glass baking pan. I will definitely make this again and play around with different fruit.

Cut the recipe in half...used about 3 cups of fruit, mostly blueberries with a few strawberries and raspberries that needed used. Used a stick of butter that, at the suggestion of another reviewer, I melted in my pan while the oven preheated and poured over the dry ingredients. And I used dark brown sugar. It was delicious! Just the right amount of juiciness. Spectacular with ice cream!

It is fantastic. I made a few changes . Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar, wheat flour, 1 cup of melted butter, 2 cups of toasted walnuts. I also added fresh sliced strawberries to 2 cups each of fresh blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. My husband couldn't get enough of it!

This is our family FAVORITE!!! It's been a double+ batcher ever since the first time I made it (probably back in 2012). I do use about half of the nutmeg that's listed to please our tastebuds. As far as the fruit, a bag of Sam's Club frozen (then thawed) mixed fruit works great...plus it's available year round. I add a little corn starch to keep it from getting too runny. LOVE it!!!

Very delicious!  Only made one recipe change and that was to add more white sugar to the berries.  I baked the crisp in wide mouth Mason jars for 40 minutes.

I just used fresh-picked blackberries in this recipe and it was wonderful!!!  I loved the bottom crisp and the top.  I melted the butter before mixing it into the dry ingredients and only used 1 cup, and it was great.  I also added a splash of Vanilla. Yum!  I broiled mine for about 5 minutes after the cooking time to get the top extra crispy.  Such a great, easy recipe!

great, easy recipe that is delicious. I also replaced white flour and sugar with oat flour and Stevia. I used 1/2 cup of butter also in stead of the full cup. It turned out great. I used frozen tri berries. My boyfriend is borderline diabetic. He can eat it. I will certainly make it again for our sweet tooth fix.

Great recipe! Used a bag and half of frozen thawed mixed berries (900grams) and did only 3/4 of the crumb mixture. Omitted the nutmeg as others have suggested. Delicious!

Followed the recipe and it was excellent and a big crowd pleaser!  I think any one berry or combination of berries would work.

It was very tasty but way to runny. Need to add some flour or cornstarch to the berry mixture next time so it's not so runny.

This is very quick and simple to make with ordinary pantry items and tastes delish!  Uses an awful lot of butter tho'.

Very good. I read other reviews and did cut the butter down to 1 cup and added more berries to cover the layer. I did have to add 20 -30 mins additional bake time to get the golden top. Everyone loved it topped with some vanilla ice cream, yum!

I just took mine out of the oven and it came out perfectly fine. I added strawberries and used wild blackberries. It came out crispy, juicy and delicious. I think that the only thing that I will change in the future is the amount of butter. 1 1/2 cups is quite a lot, just 1 cup will work well. One user said that she felt it was too dry, I definitely did not find that to be the case.

I used frozen berries and it wasn't runny at all.  However, I did not think this was any better than other fruit crisp recipes I have used in the past.  I also felt 3 sticks of butter was way to much for this crisp.

Halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 dish.  Reduced the butter per other reviews, and really enjoyed the oat topping with the berries.  Would agree with other reviews about putting even more berries in!  Can't wait to make again.  Was great warm with vanilla ice cream too.

I didn't care for this recipe. The berries should have been the star, but were completely overpowered by the topping. The topping was a bit floury too.

Just needs a pinch of salt.  My family devoured this recipe at our last get together.  I usually make it with whatever frozen fruit I have on hand (cherries, apples, peaches, mango pineapple mix, berries). No need to thaw the fruit, just throw it in and sprinkle the sugar on top (or toss it in the sugar), cook until bubbly in the middle (cooking time will be a bit longer).  This last time I made a 1/2 batch in my toaster oven using a few good dashes of homemade pumpkin pie spice (instead of cinnamon/nutmeg) and tossed the frozen apple slices in cinnamon sugar, the flavor was amazing.

This was pretty good, but I should of not used frozen berries. It made too wet. I used about a 1/4 cup less butter, and only used 2 tbls of sugar. Next time I wouldn't use any since the fruit is sweet enough.  I also would of added more of the crisp for a thicker layer.

Did not make this as shown, as I only had some strawberries and blueberries,so I used fruits that were going off! AND, I had run out off flour! and, had only 3 pkgs of instant flavored oatmeal! So, I ended up using ground-up nuts, and Panko crumbs and some pancake mix!!!!! You don't even want to hear about my brown sugar fiasco. At least I had some. Baked and hubby ate it warm out of the oven and loved it! You can tell I never bake!

I'm sure this recipe would work, as is, but I changed a few of the ingredients around, as per personal preference / other reviewers suggestions / an honest mistake.  First of all, I used 8 cups of fresh blackberries mixed with the same 4 tablespoons of sugar.  The filling was made with only 1 cup of brown sugar, and 1 cup of butter, and no spices [the mistake].  I sprinkled half the filling into the 9"X13" baking dish sprayed with canola oil, and with the remaining crumble, I added 1/2 a cup of raw sliced almonds.  Followed the instructions as written for the remaining part of the recipe.  Wonderful, juicy, and berrrry crispy, haha.  I think the one thing I would do differently next time, however, is to bake the bottom crust [pricked first, or course] for 8-10 minutes before adding the berry filling, and the topping.

Very easy recipe to make with great results. I did divide the white flour into half white and half whole wheat to make it a bit healthier. Also cut the butter to one cup. I also used six cups of fruit. Next time I will use twelve cups of fruit. I just felt the six cups was not enough.. I can't imagine what it would be like with 4.5 cups as the recipes calls for. I found the crisp on both the top and bottom was nice, but it definitely needs more fruit in the middle.

Only used a cup of butter and 2 C. each of blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. I probably should have only used the 1 1/2 C. since the extra berries made the bottom a little too wet. Still absolutely delicious. I liked it better cold the next day myself :)

really good- i modified mine a lot to suit my needs/tastes.  I used a 7x11 pan and used about 3 cups fruit, 1 1/4 c oats, 1 c flour, 6 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. coconut oil, spices and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I coated fruit in about a tsp. of corn starch so it wouldn't be runny.

This was very good. I used blueberries and strawberries (halved, which were wonderful). I initially thought there was a lot of topping/crust, but I made a thicker crust bottom and covered the top well using all (and it was quite a bit) of mixture. It came out beautiful and delicious! Unlike some, who melted the butter, I cut in my butter. It took some time but the flavor was really nice.

Great simple recipe. I used way less sugar (like a couple tablespoons) and about 5 times as many berries because they were so good! When the berries are so sweet you just don't need as much.

Absolutely excellent! I made this for a family get together a week ago, and I'm still receiving compliments on how delicious it was. Every morsel had been eaten and my hubby and son fought over who could eat was was left on the serving spoon :)) Great recipe!

This turned out good. It's not my all time favorite fruit crisp/cobber recipe but it's still good. I used all blackberries because we just picked a bunch fresh. Because of that, I added a little bit more sugar. I also only used a cup of butter and the crisp turned out great. When I make it again, I will definitely add more fruit because the fruit to crisp ratio, is a definitely more crisp.

This is a great base recipe that lends itself to suit your taste. After reading a lot of reviews I made the following changes: used 6 cups of fresh blueberries (that's what I had), cut the brown sugar and butter to 1 cup of each. I followed the rest of the recipe as originally written. Everybody who tried it, absolutely loved it. Apple picking is around the corner, guess what I'll be making?

I've been on the lookout for a really good cobbler recipe for awhile! This recipe is delicious and was very easy to make. As others did, I also substituted honey for sugar to use on the berries and also used one cup of butter instead of 1 1/2 cups. I found it easier to cut the butter in the dry mixture and stir it up, and then put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds just to make it soft. Then I stirred it a bit more and it was perfect. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Absolutely loved this! Not hard at all to make, and tasted wonderful. Personally, I prefered warming a piece in the microwave and eating with vanilla ice cream...or just as is any time (:

This was tasty. I took another reviewer's suggestion and cut out the white sugar and used half the amount of butter called for. The topping didn't get quite as crumbly as I would've liked, so it may have benefited from a bit more butter, but definitely doesn't need the full amount. I also used 3 cups of frozen mixed berries that I let thaw for about 2 hours, so I scaled the recipe to 2/3 which was perfect. I served it to my husband and friends and everyone enjoyed it but no one raved about it.

I didn't care for this recipe. Two stars instead of one because it was edible. The crumble bottom and topping was too flour-ie. I did use wheat flour instead of regular flour but I think if I made it with regular flour I would still feel the same way. I won;t be making this again.

Very tasty.  I added a touch more cinnamon and probably did not need all the butter, but it was very delicious.  I made it for my mum-in-law, who is visiting from overseas and she asked for the recipe.

This is AWESOME!  I will definitely be making this again.  I left out the cinnamon, didn't sugar the fruit, and added sliced almonds to the crisp.  For fruit, I used about fresh peaches, cherries, and raspberries. Served with fresh vanilla whipped cream.  I baked it a little longer than 40 minutes in a convection oven set at 425.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4 stars is that there is a lot of crust in this crisp! The flavor is perfect, the consistency is fantastic. If you are the kind of person who likes a lot of "crisp" with your berries, you'll love this. If you want less, my suggestion is to halve the crisp part of the recipe and use it only on top of the fruit (rather than as a crust and a topping). I made this tonight using 4 cups of fresh blackberries, and because I ran out of rolled oats, I had to substitute with crushed breakfast cereal (mixture of kinds). No matter...the flavor and texture was divine. This is a very forgiving recipe. I served it with vanilla ice cream AND whipped cream (oink!) and it really was a winner. I'll make it again but probably with less crust.

This is my new favorite recipe! So easy and quick, so open to customizing--any fruit works! Nectarines are now in season--can't wait to try them in this recipe. Works as breakfast and equally well as a dessert--so glad you shared this with us!

I was not thrilled with this recipe. I followed it exactly and i thought it was dry, yet sticky and glue-like. I might try again and add some juice or water.

I made this for a birthday party.  This was very good.  There were 10 of us and we had more than half of this left.  It's not so good the next day.  I would only make half of this again.

I've made a lot of crisps/cobblers over the years and this is by far the best.  I often use frozen berries instead of fresh berries.

I used all blackberries, and while the flavor was delicious it came out a little runny.  I think next time I will add some cornstarch to help thicken things up a little!

This was delicious!! I would give it 5 stars, but couldn't due to all the changes I made. I ended up using 3.5 cups of blackberries (a bit tart on their own) and 1 cup of a very ripe peach. I decided to cut down the white sugar to 2 tbsp and the brown sugar to 1 cup and found it was plenty sweet. I also cut down the butter to 1 cup and a bit less nutmeg as I find it to be a strong spice. I found that there was plenty of crumble mixture, and in the future would use 5-6 cups of fruit. I can't wait to try other combinations!

I really liked the idea of the flour/brown sugar mixture on the bottom and top of berries. Very good recipe. My berries were very juicy so I added a couple table spoons of tapioca to thicken it up. It just a tid bit that my mom taught me :)

This is fantanstic. The first time I made it I felt it needed a slight salty sensation to go with the oats properly.... so today I added 1 tsp. of baking soda to the crisp to give it that slight kick and it was perfect.  I also used 5 cups of fruite (berries and peaches) and a shake of cinnamon in the crisp.  Like others I melted the butter into the crisp mix and only added enough to wet it...probably about 1 1/4 c. total.

Fantastic recipe, and agreed that any fruit is interchangeable.  I halved the recipe and used white peaches with 1 tbsp of sugar instead since the peaches were sweet enough.  The amount of topping for the bottom and top was perfect I felt.  Great consistency.

excellent recipe, we used 1/2 blueberry and 1/2 wild blackberry. We used two sticks of butter, and it was still very buttery and delicious!!! Big hit with our two daughters, even though we had to wrestle the wild blackberries from them!!!!!!

I was searching for a recipe to use up a bunch of blueberries I had and chose this because of it's numerous great ratings. I did as others suggested, I used 6 cups of fruit (blueberries and white peaches) and reduced the butter to 1 cup. This came out wonderfuly delicious! I had extra topping so I baked it separately and will use it as ice cream topping.

So great!!  So much easier to make than a pie, and in my opinion, a lot better!  I usually half the recipe and use a 8 inch round pan, and skip the sugar on the fruit.  The triple berry listed here is my favorite, but I also make other versions like apple, etc.

I only read a few of the reviews so maybe I missed this comment - this recipe cries out for more fruit! I used 8 cups vs the 4 1/2 cups called for (with corresponding increase in sugar) and it was fantastic. I would not have wanted less fruit in such a big pan. It took longer to cook - close to an hour - but it received rave review after rave review. Truly the best summer dessert I've ever made.

Used a combination of pie cherries, blueberries and raspberries.  I did not use a bottom crust, just because I prefer a lot of berries to a little bit of "crisp".  Turned out wonderful.  Berries are a little juice and runny, but taste is right on.  My husband will be pleasantly surprised after dinner tonight!

I LOVED this recipe!  I made it using only blackberries.  I had about 6 cups of berries, so I used 6 TB of sugar and found that to be just right.  I was a little unsure how much butter to use based on previous recipes, so I used 1 cup (2 sticks.)  That gave a very generous butter/dry ratio so I wonder maybe the original recipe called for 1 1/2 sticks vs cups.  I liked how it came out with 2 sticks and that is what I will do again.  I loved the concept of dividing the "topping" into two layers.  I let my butter sit out until it was really soft and then cut it in as the recipe directs.    I will definitely make this again.  This recipe makes me want to plant blackberry bushes in my yard!

I found this recipe too rich and sweet for my taste and I love sweet food.  I had to serve with a lot of vanilla ice cream to tone down the richness.  If I were to make again I would cut down on the sugar and the amount of topping and add more fruit.

This is so easy and so yummy! It's easy to half recipe and bake in 8x8 pan. I love the suggestion of melting butter in pan as oven preheats, then mixing in pan. I scoop some of the topping out and make a bottom layer and top layer of crumble. Very simple!

Wow, this is so good, and so very easy. I doubled the berries, and added vanilla icecream at the end.  I liked the crisp instead of a "doughy" crust, and I doubled the recipe so I could take some home, but everyone had seconds so its time to make another one!

This tasted great and was really easy to make! The only thing I changed was that I used only fresh blueberries and raspberries(it was all I had) and used a lot less butter than the recipe calls for (3/4 cup instead of 1 1/2 cup). I also used a little extra cinnamon...I served it warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream.Delicious!

I made this just as instructed and it was way to floury? I had to cook almost 20 minutes longer just to get the flour to brown and not be so white. I would use another recipe next time with just the crispy on top and more oats,brown sugar and less flour

I made this for my inlaws & they loved it! They had it warm w/blueberry ice cream. I used a bag of frozen berry mix-strawberries, blueberries, raspberries,  blackberries. I also threw in a handful of fresh blueberries & strawberries that I needed to use up. Smelled divine!

This "crisp" didn't crisp for me, even after baking it for longer than directed.  The next day it was soggy.  Even though I increased the amount of fruit, to me there was still a disproportionate amount of the oat mixture.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was good. The usual crisp I made uses a similar topping, but only on top. It could use more fruit, but I do love the topping. As someone else said, it's like an oatmeal cookie crust. Yum! I used strawberry and rhubarb but otherwise followed the recipe, butter and all. The butter did not seem excessive for the amount of flour and oats used. It wasn't greasy at all. I will definitely make again. (Oh, I just used the food processor for the cold butter. Put everything except the oats... pulse it until butter is pea sized. Then stir in the oats so they remain whole. Super easy.)

Loved it.  We especially liked having the "crust".  It made the dessert less mushy because it absorbs some of the juices from the fruit.  I used a frozen mixed berry blend; 5 cups because there was a lot of crumb mix.

OMG people!! This recipe is a keeper! I will put it in my "frequent file". I made it this afternoon for our Valentine's Day dessert. My husband plans on having it for breakfast tomorrow too! It is not too sweet, just right with a little vanila ice cream. I used the exact ingredients/measurments called for. However, I baked it (in my oven) 15 minutes longer than the directions called for. It wasn't overdone and the topping was nicely brown and was crisp when cooled. Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

Not the greatest. I followed the recipe but used frozen bluberries only(5 cups). It was dry maybe 8 oz of yogart would make the filling more appitizing.

I didn't care for this. I used fresh berries, but the flavor just wasn't that great. The crust on the bottom was worthless, since it turned into a hardened puck on the bottom of the pan, and the topping on top of the berries didn't crisp enough with all that butter. I've made much better using other recipes in the past. I think I'll go back to apples!

I only had 2 cups of blueberries, so I cut the recipe in half and it was absolutely perfect! I used an 8 x 8 pan and followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was the perfect consistency and ratio of berry to crust!

I couldn't stand to use that much butter so I didn't.  Tasted a bit dry but probably due to lack of insane amount of butter.  Bummer!

I happen to not care for berries once they are cooked, so I didn't eat this myself. But everyone else who did, enjoyed it! Now I can only rate the recipe based on the preparation of the actual berries as I used the "crisp" recipe from Ina Garten which I happen to love. It could have been sweeter, but since I served it with Vanilla ice cream, they said it balanced the flavors nicely. Next time I will taste the berries first and adjust the sugar accordingly. I would definitely make this again for those who enjoyed it the first time around.

Really good.  Very easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly except that I used blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.  The blueberries and strawberries were frozen so I kept it in the oven for another 10 minutes more.  I would definitely make this again.

This turned out pretty well for me. I cut down the butter to 3/4 cups and I was quite pleased. Can't imagine using the amount the recipe calls for. Only other thing I did different was to bake at 375 deg for the first half hour, then turned down for the remaining time to 350 deg. It came out perfect and in 45 minutes. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the butter.

Yum!  This was the yummiest crisp I have ever eaten.  I used frozen strawberries & blueberries and cut the butter amout by one stick (due to other reviews).  Turned out great.

If you are wondering whether to try this recipe I have to tell you that it is a MUST! I had some blueberries that were just beginning to get soft and a bag of apples in the cellar. I used about 2+ cups of apples and 4 cups of blueberries and also cut back on the butter to 1 cup as other reviewers suggested. Also, didn't have rolled oats on hand so used 5 packages of instant oatmeal(in various flavors!!!) In a word....Yummy!!! This is definitely one of the best berry crisp recipes around. Can't wait to try it using other fruits. Many thanks Polly! =)

Oh my, this was fabulous!  Lasted only 2 days at my house. I used strawberries & blueberries & cut back on the butter to 1 cup. I can see where this would be highly adaptable to other fruits.  Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious!  I've made this twice; the first time with three different berries; the next was all blackberries.  I prefer the one-berry version, and while the recipe does call for a lot of butter, it absolutely makes a difference.  I served it warm with ice cream - yummmmm....

Wild blackberries grow in abundance around our neighbourhood.  After picking with my daughters we looked for a crisp recipie.  This is the one I found.  I used a mix of about 3 1/2 cups fresh blackberries and 1 cup of fresh blueberries.  The rest of the recipe I left the same.  It was fantastic!  I found it tasted the best when it was warm with a little vanilla ice cream.

I use 4-1/2 cups of blackberries because I have them growing in my backyard all summer.  I have made this recipe 4 times in several weeks and it never sticks around long. My 4 year old and 1 year old are crazy for it. Family members are offering to pick me blackberries to make this crisp.  I cut the butter in half and it still turns out great.  If you want it to really crisp up on top, you can coat it with a little bit of cooking spray.

Outstanding!  I used fresh fruit and this was just wonderful.  Next time I think I'll try to reduce the amount of butter as there is quite a lot in this recipe.  This would be fantastic served warm with ice cream.

I used all blueberries since that is what I had. If you use a whole berry like this, it is necessary to crush the berries (just slightly) before adding the little bit of sugar it recommends. I thought the idea of crisp on the bottom was an excellent idea, and liked the crisp okay myself. I personally thought it was a little under-sweet and had a bit much butter (will adjust this the next time I make it), but I made this for several friends and they LOVED it. One even took a to-go container for later!   The most popular way friends seemed to enjoy it was with a small scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a dollop of whipped cream. While it wasn't my favorite dessert, it received rave reviews and I will make it again with the adjustments above. I anticipate other forms of berries might not need the extra sugar, but if you are using blueberries or another tart berry I would recommend it.

Wow is this fantastic. I've made it multiple times with just blackberries, triple berries and it is a huge company hit. I've made it 3 times this season. Just yesterday I made it with fresh picked wild blackberries. I did use two TBL's extra sugar. I even made it with six cups berries and double the sugar. Excellant. Company gobbles this with 1/2 and 1/2 on it or ice cream and return for seconds. Never any left overs with this recipe!

Made exactly according to the recipe (except substituted old fashioned oats for rolled oats...didn't have the rolled ones on hand).  I made 2 pans this morning, one for a potluck/celebration later this evening and one for my family.  Came out FANTASTIC!!!

This was good!  I made mine with all fresh fruit and used strawberries instead of blackberries.  The crispy top was so delicious.  The only change I would make would be to use 2 cups of each fruit instead of 1 1/2.

I made this for a BBQ and it got rave reviews.  I made a few changes that would not change the texture or flavor much. I did not have the nutmeg on hand and I only used fresh black raspberries from my yard. It was so good I had to pick more berries and make it again since there wasn't any left over! I do think the butter could be reduced by 1/4 C and not change the yummy crust or crumble top if you wanted. I thought it was delicious as is, however. This one goes In the recipe box!

I really liked this! I ended up using peaches, nectarines, and blueberries because that is what I had on hand. I loved the crisp part and the fact that it was on bottom and top. We ate it out of the oven with vanilla ice cream, mmmm! My sister ate it out of the fridge, cold, and thought it was excellent that way too!

This was great and very simple to make.  I took it to a potluck at work and it was gone instantly.  Instead of the individual cups of berries, I used a triple berry mix (3 lb package) from local grocery store. I will use this recipe in the future many times over.  Thanks

Simple and yummy. I made a half batch with 3 cups of fresh blueberries. I added 1 tsp cornstarch with the sugar and melted the butter.  While I was assempling it I worried I didn't have enough crisp to do the bottom and top layers but a very thin pressed layer in the bottom of the dish was plenty to get the layered effect and leave just enough to cover the top. Came out tasty and will certainly make it again!

Perfect! Couldn't ask for a better crisp! Made this with my 6 year old son today, using freshly-picked blackberries.  I didn't use all the topping (can you believe it?) but saved it in the fridge for perhaps an individual crisp later this week. LOL

This recipe turned out nicely. I used fresh raspberries and blueberries and served it with vanilla ice cream. I used 1 cup of butter and found it to be sufficient. In the future, I will melt the butter in the microwave instead of softening it. Also, I will either add more fruit or reduce the bottom/top oat mixture.

This dish was fantastic!  I cut the butter in half and it was more than enough for the full recipe and trust me, I like butter.  I liked the ratio of crisp to berry and this was a HUGE hit. I've served alone, with ice cream, and with fresh whipped cream.  Delicious any way and everyone loves it!  Give it a shot, you won't be dissapointed.

Very delicious. My only negative is that there is a whole lot more of the topping/bottom layer than there is fruit filling. I would suggest using a little more butter in the topping mixture because mine stayed very dry and didn't get crispy. Still tasted great, though.

This was delicious!  I used frozen berries, rinsed and drained and actually used about 6 cups total (2 cups of bluberries and 4 cups of a triple berry blend).  I've made it twice and will definitely make it again!

WOW!  This is great!!!  I have a feeling that this is a pretty basic crisp recipe that can be used with most fruit!  This was really good.  I love blackberries and will probably try it with just the blackberries next time.  Thank you so much for a great dessert!

I have made this twice and both times used strawberries instead of the blackberries.  I also DID NOT add the sugar to the berries.  I did melt the butter completely and then used my hands to mix in the oat mixture. When serving this hot, I would serve it with ice cream and if serving at room temp, I would do whipping cream that is lightly sweetened.

Used a mixed bad of berries which always works well. My only suggestion would be to read other tips about cutting back on the sugar, brown sugar, and butter. My family LOVED this recipe and did not notice the change. They even said it may have been too sweet if I used the correct  amount. (I used 1 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup butter) Thanks for the GREAT recipe! Will make again!

I've made this twice with blueberries only when my husband brings home fresh wild blueberries from a summer camp out.  I love the chewiness from the oatmeal.  Vanilla ice cream is a must.

Great and easy recipe. works well with frozen or fresh berries. Only thing I would (and have) changed is to increase topping amounts by 50% so instead of 2 cups oats and flour i use 3 - adjusting the spices accordingly.

Scrumptious! I sized this down to 2/3rds and went according to the recipe. I used 2/3rds blueberries and 1/3rd raspberries and didn't add sugar to them. Texture was excellent, mostly from the soft berries with the dough giving just a bit of crispiness to it. Dad's not normally a fan of oats but loved this. Goes great with or without ice cream!

This is a stand-by dessert. I'm partial to fresh berries, but frozen work fine. I prefer to decrease the butter to a little over half of what is called for, I use whole wheat flour, and don't sugar the berries.

I added 1 cup of crunchy Granola and omitted 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of the butter.  This made the top slightly crunchy with a nutty taste, very good.  I would make it again.

I made this recipe and took this to a barbeque last night and everyone raved.  I did add some walnuts to the topping and added a few more berries.  Also don't make the mistake I did but not using ROLLED oats.  I accidently used oatmeal cereal so it made too much topping and didn't look quite right but sure tasted fantastic!!!

Not very impressed with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but felt that the topping was too mushy and buttery.

This was delicious! I served it at my 4thof July BBQ, and everyone loved it.  The only adjustment I would recommend would be to add more berries.  I will make this again and again!

omg. this recipe was so good. Easy to make especially for someone like me that always messes up baking goods!! lol. I halved the recipe and also added a 1/4 cup of finely chooped walnuts to the top. Since i didnt have a sqare baking dish just used a 8'' round pan baked it for 25 min. Thanks u so easy to make

Only had 2 sticks of butter so that is what I used. Extra stick was not missed. Next time I will add more fruit. Only used blackberries as that is all I had. Possibilities are endless. Would like to try this with peaches, blueberries and strawberries. This was berry berry good! :-)

I downsized the recipe (made it for an 8x8 square pan) and used frozen berries, but I thought this was just okay.  A lot of crisp and not much berries.  I'll keep searching for the ultimate berry crisp!

I gave it fours stars because I changed it slightly. I nearly doubled the fruit which made for a perfect balance of filling and crust. Of all the desserts available at our 4th of July block party pot-luck, this one was gone before everybody had been through the line! Thanks for making me look so good!

This was easy & very good.  I used mostly fresh raspberries because that's what I had.  It really would be good with any fruit mixture, frozen or fresh.

Excellent!  I used frozen berries but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty.  Not too sweet, nice crunch on top and the bottom layer soaked up the juices which gave it a twist. Everybody loved it. It also goes farther than I expected because it's so filling. So much better than a boring old pie!

easy to make.  i used a package of frozen berries plus a pint of fresh blueberries.  i only put 2 tbsp sugar on the fruit (instead of 3), and i added some lemon juice

for the crisp mixture, i used 1 cup unsalted butter (at room temperature, which made it easy to mix together).  i recommend adding a bit of salt to the mixture (i.e. 1 or 1 1/2 tsp salt) OR, preferably, use salted butter for the crumb mixture.  enjoy!

Yes, there is alot of butter in this recipe, but man is it good!! :) I cut the recipe, and used extra blueberries, raspberries, and a pear. I will, without a doubt, be making this again, but next time I guess I will cut the butter in half and save some calories ;)

The crisp was delicious; however, I do have one cooking tip to offer. Never, under any circumstances, substitute Worcestershire sauce for the vanilla extract. The results are less than appealing.

Oh, and if anyone has any misgivings about the amount of butter as I did (my first time baking a crisp): yes, it does call for a cup and a half of the stuff. Not the healthiest dessert out there, but tasty!

I made this crisp with Blueberries only and it was delicious!!! I added six cups of Blueberries instead of the 4 and 1/2 and next time will add even more fruit.  It was a lot of "crisp".  Will definitely make again!!

Made this for company tonight.  Used mostly blueberries and some raspberries, frozen from the bags.  Added a little flour to the fruit as suggested by others.  Decreased butter to a stick and a half.  Decreased brown sugar by a half cup.  I'm not going to tell you to do it this way, but it did turn out GREAT!  I served it at room temperature with whipped topping.  I think it would be heavenly served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe- a great foodie friend just had three servings! I didn't use all of the topping on top- only a sprinkle so the fruit oozed through, used 1 cup butter, and 1 bag triple berry frozen fruit with about 8 fresh strawberries chopped up. Will make again and again!

Great recipe. I used a frozen mixed fruit of strawberries, blackberries, red raspberries and blueberries. What a treat and even better when chilled.
Thanks Polly Giebler

The taste was fine, but a little too sweet for my family.  Big problem with juice though.  Ended up moving the berries & crust to another pan and dumping the juice.  Would not plan on serving this to guests because of the looks.

This is delicious! My whole family loved it. I used frozen blackberries only- just thawed them out first. Served warm with ice-cream- perfect! Just the recipe I was looking for. Thanks!

Whole family loved it. I used 2 16oz packages of frozen blackberries. When I do that next time I will not add the crumble on the bottom. It was delicious and much better that traditional crust.

I didn't need 18 servings so I cut the recipe in half (though I used the full amount of berries, 4.5 cups, because it looked skimpy without all of them.) I also used almost all blueberries with a few blackberries thrown in. It took awhile to "cut" the butter into the flour - about 15 minutes to get an even texture. Other than that, it was all very simple and hard to screw up.

This recipe, paired with a scoop of GOOD quality vanilla ice cream, will absolutely get raves at a dinner party. I will definitely make this again, it was very impressive and sooo delicious.

This is wonderfully rich and delicious... and flexible in that you can really use any combination of berries or just one kind and it still turns out really wonderful.  Not a recipe for dieters though... but truly yummy comfort food.

Fantastic, I see why this recipe has such an awesome rating.  I reduced the servings to 4, and used only raspberries - mmm.  I only had frozen berries so I thawed them a bit in the micro and went ahead and used them, tasted great.  Will definitely make again.

Yum Yum!  I thought this was the best crisp I have ever had.  Yes it was rich but oh so good.  I just had blackberries from my yard and it was just delish!  Will make again and again.  I had without and with vanilla ice cream.  Great recipe.  So easy to make!

Yum, yum!   I did increase the berries to a total of six cups (used 3 cups bluseberries and 3 cups blackberries)  and sugar to 6 tbsp.  I did not think the crust was too much as some reviewers did. I think it was perfect, but then I do like a good crust.  I'm making this again tonight!
PS Don't forget the ice cream!!

Wonderful recipe. Can use half the amount for the topping- be sure to use regular oatmeal (not instant). It makes the topping so much better!

Very good.  I also added more fruit...about 2 cups of each (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries).  Was a bit mushy in the middle, next time won't add so much butter and will cook longer.

Excellent recipe! I use what berries I have on hand (any 2-3 of the recipe's berries, plus ripe strawberries) and chopped the larger berries so that all sizes were equal. This is our family's new favorite dessert, especially when topped with rich vanilla ice cream! Next time I will add finely chopped nuts to the topping to make it more crunchy; the topping tends to get soggy after sitting for a bit.

Absolutely wonderful...IF you double the berries (left all the other ingredients in the filling the same and it was still plenty sweet enough!)and cut back on the "crisp" a bit.  The crisp has a great flavor, there's just a bit too much of it for my taste.  Will make this again for sure!!

Made this with aprox. 5 c of blackberries only. It was good but, I was expecting more blackberry favor. I plan to double the amount of blackberries next time or half the dry ingredients (less crisp and more berry).

This is GREAT!! I converted the recipe to 12 servings and used an 8" square glass pan. It provided plenty of topping for a nice bottom and top layer. I did add about one cup of extra fruit. I used mostly blue berries with one large peeled peach and several sliced strawberries. I baked it for about 40 minutes. This dessert got rave reviews. One of our guest said it was the best dessert he'd ever had. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Thanks Polly for posting this jewel!

One berry works just fine. Makes a lot of crip topping.

Everyone that tried it, loved it.  I used whatever berries I had lying around at the time:  Strawberries, rasberries and marionberries all grown in my parents yard.  It was wonderful.

this recipe was great.  I bought a large amount of berries and I didn't know what to do with all of them so I started searching for recipes this was perfect.  I served with french vanilla ice cream and followed others advice for the pan spill overs

I only give this one a 3 star because I wasn't "wowed" by this. It was ok, but not great, and most cobblers I've had at restaurants have tasted much better. I was hoping for something simple and easy but with great flavor. The berries were just berries with sugar, and the crust was mealy and heavy. Reminded me of an oatmeal cookie gone wrong. I probably won't use this recipe again, but it warranted a 3 because my friends liked it.

Absolutely delicious!  I used all frozen blueberries for mine, as that was all I had at the time,  and it came out wonderful.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and the crust and topping came out great!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This crisp is great!  I used previously frozen blueberries and raspberries and picked the blackberries fresh.  I also added two cut-up crisp apples to the mix and added a touch more sugar. I served it at my mother-in-law's birthday and she liked it so much she had a second helping!(and she NEVER has second helpings!)

Meh. If you’re looking to make oat berry bar cookies then this recipe is for you but I like my fruit crisps to be more fruit than cookie so I won’t be using this recipe again.

Wow! I tried something similar at an Inn where I stayed so I looked for recipes to try to copy it. This was even better. The only thing I added differently was Danncy Mexican Vanilla (clear) because you can’t have too much Mexican Vanilla in anything and I switched the raspberries for cranberries because that’s what I had. They added a slight tang to the sweet. I made this as dessert for Christmas and it was ridiculously Delicious. It was breakfast for the next few days after! Yum!

I used a mix of fresh berries: raspberries, blueberries and straw. I used 1 cup of butter and left out extra sugar on fruit.
Makes 1 large pie dish with enough leftover for a couple of personal size pyrex  dishes. Excellent!

Make sure the butter is soft so your topping is all moist before baking or it ends up powdery in the top!  We had to add extra butter to fix this but it was so good!  My 10 year old made this!  Simple and delicious!

Delicious. I used the frozen berries from Costco. Although I used 1 1/2 times the amount in the recipe, next time I’d use the entire bag. I thawed them and then mixed in a bit of cornstarch. With regard to the butter, it’s much easier to take it cold out of the fridge, and grate it into the solids. It’s so easy. Then just mix it in, cutting with two knives. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this using Saskatoon berries (a staple in Canada during berry picking season). I only used 4.5 cups, but I would add 5-6 cups next time as there's lots of crust and topping for the dish. It was delicious.

I recently made this for a potluck and it was the best crisp I've ever made.  I received many compliments.  I did use half the sugar called for in the recipe and my guests commented that it was sweet enough.  I used organic frozen berries as well.

Thanks so much for such a great recipe!  This is now my "go to" crisp recipe.  Can't wait to try it with other fruit variations.

Very good! I did it just like the recipe said and it turned out great! If I would change anything, I would add a little more berries, but other than that, it was perfect! Husband approved even. I made another batch today and I'm going to freeze for later.

very good (even with frozen mixed berries - straw, blue, black).
Crumb mixture turned out very very good.   I suspect the good amount of butter didnt hurt.

We really liked this dessert. The layer of cripyon the bottom is a nice change from a traditional crisp. I had some fruit in the frig I needed to use up and so made this with blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries and it was wonderful. I would think you could use just about any kind of fruit as long as the total amount is about 41/2-5 cups of fruit. Because I only cook for 2 people, the next time I make this, I will cut the recipe in half and use an 8” square pan. Theo nly oats I had on hand were quick cooking oats, and they were fine, but I think the old-fashioned rolled oats would actually work better so will use those next time.

I was not expecting this to turn out.   So much butter and  crumble!   Seemed to overwhelm the berries.   But I was so wrong!   It’s delicious.  

I followed the recipe exactly except I only had a cup of rolled oats so I used steel cut oats for the other cup I needed.    That may be why the crumble was not overwhelming.

It was tasty! Just the right amount of sweet and grain. My berries didn’t have enough moisture to attach to the sugar so the sugar ended up at the bottom and when I poured it over the crust it tended up in a pile. Next time I would sprinkle the sugar over the berries after they were on top of the crust.

Great basic recipe, but did as other reviewers recommended and used a little more than half the butter, and did not add sugar to the fruit. Especially when served with whipped cream, definitely doesn't need the extra sugar.  Needed a little longer to cook in my oven, but turned out great.

This is a great recipe ... I'm sure no changes would be needed but I did make a few. I added about 50% more fruit than the recipe calls for (I used a mixture of what I had on hand: fresh raspberries, some frozen mixed berries, a few fresh apples chopped and 1/2 bag of fresh cranberries).   Even with this, I felt that there was too much topping/crust to fruit.  I also reduce the amount of butter by 1/2 cup / 1 stick.  When I make it next time I will not put any flour/oat mixture on the bottom, and reduce the amount of the flour/oat mixture that I make.

Tastes wonderful, but I only used about 2/3 of the crumble.  The amount recommended here overpowers the berries IMO.  I also added a bit of lemon zest to the berry mixture.

I loved it! I may add more berries next time though. I love having the crust on the bottom and then more on the top. I put more of the crumble into the crust and just sprinkled some on the top. I used frozen fruit and drained them as much as I could so it was perfect in terms of wetness. Maybe a bit less brown sugar in the crumble. I hope to try it with strawberry and rhubarb next time! Will definitely be making it again!!

I made this using frozen raspberries and blueberries, with a couple hands-full of dried cranberries to fill out the measure.  Think the cranberries were overwhelmed by the raspberries, but they did provide a nice tart bite. Bet the addition of just enough orange juice to moisten would be nice, too.   Also used more sugar than called for.  We liked the double-decker crust.  Also sprinkled some broken pecans on top.  Really enjoyed!  Good way to use that forgotten frozen fruit in the back of the freezer.  This is a good recipe to halve for those of us in small households.  Works fine!

Its a very good crumble. I used frozen fruit instead of fresh due to other reviews saying it was too dry with fresh. Using my food processor to mix the crumble, this recipes was very simple and delicious. Will definitely make again.

The combination of berries is great. I thought the "crisp" part could be cut in half and not as much brown sugar. Seemed to be mostly "sweet crisp."  If I make it again, I'll change it.

I substituted Almond flour meal for all purpose flour and cut back the butter to 1/2 cup. I also only used 2 tablespoons of sugar to sweeten the berries. I served it at a dinner party as well as Sunday dinner. A big hit with everyone!!

This was pretty good. I'd definitely make some changes next time. I personally like my fruit crumbles to be more liquidy, and this came out a tad dry - almost like granola fruit squares or something. (I'm used to crumbles that are mostly berries and their juices along with a little crumble for added flavor and texture.) I used what I thought would be the best fruits for their juiciness - blackberries and raspberries. Next time I'd definitely use more fruit and not as much of the topping. I think the flour and oats just soak up too much of the berries' liquid. It's a good base recipe though and can easily be tweaked without causing failure.

Just like another reviewer, I used half the butter. I had some frozen blueberries I wanted to use up and this recipe turned out heavenly! This is definitely a keeper!

Followed other users advice and used: 1 cup of butter, 3 T of sugar, zest of one lemon, extra fruit. Next time I would add even MORE fruit, and maybe not quite use all of the streusel. Great base recipe though. I used raspberries, marionberries, and peaches for fruit. Delicious.

super good!  I did reduce butter to 1 cup, used peaches strawberries & blackberries.  Didn't toss with sugar but did sprinkle a bit on top 1-1 1/2 TB because the strawberries weren't very tasty.    This would be amazing with Whipped cream or Ice Cream on top.  Love the bottom crust.  It is like an oatmeal cookie with fruit.

This is just as good as a berry pie. I have made it with a regular crust and the crumble. Some reviews say this recipe makes to much crumble. Leftover crumble freezes well in a freezer bag. I always make extra for the freezer

I've made this a bunch. It's forgiving and easily adaptable. For a wheat-free version, I subbed oat flour for white flour. Also subbed coconut oil for a dairy free version. I mix it up and use wheat flour instead of all white flour, and often toss in a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed for an added fiber boost. Very tasty even with the modifications.

I used all blueberrys as that is what I had. Like it because it was not overly sweet. Nice touch with the nutmeg. At with and without icecream. Prefer without. Think next time I will turn on the broiler at the end to get the top crisp.

Overall this is a good fruit crisp, but next time I will double the amount of fruit. Too much crisp made it more like fruit squares. I like that it is not too sweet.

This recipe is five stars just as it is. Whenever I ask my fiancé if he wants dessert, anything he wants, he always requests this even over restaurant desserts! The crust is amazing - the brown sugar is what really does it. I usually use frozen berries but thaw them first. I actually like them better as they seem to have a more potent flavor. I like to use a combo of raspberries, blueberries and dark cherries - but any berries would do. Also - as others have said it's a lot of butter! It definitely is great as it is but I make it a little healthier by using only 2/3 of the butter and it tastes great, too. This one is a keeper!

Should have read the reviews first for modifications. I would have eliminated the sugar from the berries, although I did reduce the brown sugar by a bit (could have been more). I also would have reduced the butter and only used about half of the crisp topping. I increased the berried by about a cup.

I halve this recipe and use it to top about 5 cups of peeled and sliced peaches. (I also use at least half white whole wheat flour.) It still cooks about 30 (35?) minutes. Makes the perfect cobbler. Perfect. I imagine it would be divine with berries too, but there are other things I prefer to do with my berries....(huckleberry bars, anyone?)....

This is good with changes.  I used blueberries and rhubarb, increased the sugar in the berries, decreased the sugar in the crumble and decreased the butter by one third.  Next time I will grease the pan and bake bottom crust for 5-10 min before adding berries and additional crust.

This one rocks.  I've made this a dozen times at least.  I use  a food processor and chunks of frozen butter -- keeps it crumbly.

I also substitute other tart fruits, including strawberry, mango, apple.   I sometimes substitute 1-1/2 cups of fruit with an 8-oz jar of homemade wineberry jam and skip the white sugar.

Super good! I loved the crispy oat mixture and berry ratio. I used about 5 cups of berries (strawberries, blueberries and raspberries) and it was perfect, not soupy. I will definitely be saving this recipe and making this my go to crisp recipe. Thank you!

I made this recipe as is with the exception of adding an extra cup of blueberries. It was too much crust and topping, even with the extra blueberries.

This was terrific. I halved the recipe and baked in and 8X8 pan.   I used frozen blueberries (coating them in the sugar mixed with about 1T cornstarch.)   I used a stick and 1/2 of butter.  This is a keeper!

The nutmeg a cinnamon make this dessert taste so earthy and wonderful. My family can't have dairy or citrus so finding desserts is hard work. We used margarine instead of butter and a soydelicious vanilla ice cream to pair. This recipe continues to make several appearances throughout the year and always looks beautiful coming out of the oven. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Oh wow!  I made this with just blueberries.  This is great warm with ice cream or cold the next day.  I melted the butter in the oven using only one stick as suggested by another reviewer and reduced the sugar a bit.  A big winner with everyone.

Definitely cut the butter and sugar. It doesn't need that much fat - it's supposed to be a summery treat! Next time I'll also add more berries. There was a lot of yummy crust, but I could've used more tang from the blackberries.

For adults who felt there was never, ever enough of the crisp as a child, this recipe delivers.  I've created this using nectarines in place of one type of berry, and have also swapped coconut sugar instead of brown sugar (to make this a safer dessert for those of us watching blood sugar levels).

The time I took this to a barbecue, the hosting family called a friend to come over and enjoy this amazing crisp!  This is my new favorite, and I look forward to trying different fruits.

I'm making healthy changes in my diet and cut the brown sugar and butter to one cup each in this recipe. No one missed that extra half cup of butter and sugar. I also used frozen berries that I thawed for about 90 minutes in a colander. They worked great.

I made some changes based on other reviews and the ingredients I had on hand.  The result was fabulous.  I used all blackberries because that's what I had in the freezer.  I think any fruit or combo of fruit would be delicious.  I thawed them and drained the juice before using.  I increased the fruit to 8 cups and the ratio of fruit to crumble was perfect.  I used the full amount of sugar, because my blackberries weren't very sweet at all.  With sweeter fruit, I would probably cut back on the sugar.  I mixed the crumble and refrigerated it overnight so the butter was chilled again when I used it.  I think the amount of butter is a personal preference.  I cut the butter to 1 cup.  I thought it was perfect, but my husband thought it was a little dry and would have used the full amount.

Wow, AMAZING!  Kids loved it!  Husband said it was "best dessert he's ever had". So, THANK YOU for the recipe!

Okay - I'll admit I was really random on this, but nevertheless, it turned out delightful.  Here's why... first I saw someone's review about melting the butter while the oven was preheating... I did that, but only 3/4 C of butter because I intended to halve the recipe.  I used an 8x8 pan.  However, the kids were distracting me, and I forgot that I was halving the recipe - ha!  So, I did 4.5 cups of frozen berries.  I let them defrost a little bit, then mixed with white sugar (only did 2T of white sugar because our family believes in greatly limiting sugar). In the separate bowl, I mixed the dry ingredients.  I only used 1C of rolled oats, because that's all I had. I used only a loosely filled one cup of brown sugar - could've used less still.  Once the butter was melted, I poured the butter into the dry ingredients and mixed it up. I'm guessing that half of the butter probably only worked because I didn't have all the oats in the mixture. I will fix this next time I make it! :)

I also read another review saying their final dessert was watery perhaps due to the frozen berries, so right before I put the berries into the pan, I strained them again... and hopefully strained out some of the sugar with the water ;) 

After putting the berries into the 8x8 pan, I put the topping on but it seemed like way too much, so I threw out about half of it.  Moral of the story is th

Absolutely fantastic!  I took it to a friends'  house to have for a dinner party dessert.  It was a hit!  I used fresh blackberries, frozen raspberries and blueberries slightly thawed.  I added some extra blackberries.  I feel, the 'real' butter makes a big difference.  I know 1 1/2 cups seems like a lot, but do it!

I would have given this a 5 star but based on other comments I did make some changes.    More than doubled the fruit and used only 1 cup of butter.    Those were the only changes and it turned out well, I will use this again for other fruits as they come into season.   Thanks

I received several compliments at the 4th of July BBQ I took this to. I used only 1 cup of butter and chose frozen wild blueberries and cherries (thawed) for the fruit filling. I also used a couple dashes of pumpkin pie spice in lieu of ground nutmeg. This dessert was excellent.

I liked the fact of having the crust and crumbles on top. Reviewer naples34102 was right on about the fruit balance in proportion to the crust was off. You need to reduce the crust or increase the fruit. I followed the directions and ingredients to the tee except only used two fresh fruits blueberries and raspberry. Also just melt the butter like another reviewer states, it was much more work than it needed to be. Ice cream on top helped to mellow the sweet/tart taste. I may make again but reduce everything but the fruit.

Perfect as is! I made this according to the recipe and it was declared a favorite at a large family gathering.  I also have made it when I was low on the ingredients called for, cutting the butter by a third because I ran out, and using only blueberries because that's what I had on hand. It was  a huge hit as a lower-fat blueberry crumble!

I increased the berries each by a half cup so I also boosted the other ingredients a bit. I wasn't too exact about it but it still turned out great. (I did increase cooking time by about seven minutes.) Served with vanilla ice cream. The family loved it.

This berry crisp was delicious and the perfect thing to use up some of the fresh berries I had. I cut the recipe in half because it is just my husband and me and used light butter in the topping because that is what I had on hand.  I only used 1 tbsp. of sugar on the berries, and did not really measure out the berries, just used up all the raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, I had, along with a few strawberries until it looked like I had enough.  After I began making the crisp I discovered that I was out of oats, so I subbed an equal amount of pretty finely crushed graham crackers. It was so delicious with a little whipped cream on top! I will definitely be making this again!

Made this for Mother's Day dinner with my parents and my siblings and their kids. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the berries, I didn't measure them, I just bought two 6oz packages of blackberries, 2 6oz packages of raspberries, and 2 pints of blueberries. I did not melt the butter, and used a pastry blender to mix everything. It was perfect! Everyone enjoyed it and there was only a little bit left over that my daughters begged me to take home, which they ate for breakfast the next morning. Now, they're begging me to make this again so they can have more. I think this will become a staple in our house!

I used 6c. thawed fruit. Next time I'll use a thickener, and will leave the sugar at 4TB (I used 6TB). Yummy, even though runny. Oh, and I only had a little bit of oats, so I just made a little crumble for the topping (not the bottom). Next time I'll be sure to have enough ingredients! Yummy yummy recipe though!

I used a mix bag of frozen berries and had not trouble with this being dry.  I will make this again but next time I will cut down on the brown sugar just a tad.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe for apple crisp.  I reduced the butter by 1/4 cup and I also reduced the sugar used on apples alone.  Finally I reduced the white sugar used in the oat recipe by 1/2 cup. 

It turned out really great.  The crisp is really "crunchy", and the flavor altogether is fantastic.

You can't go wrong with this one. However, I am a traditionalist and I put all the berries on the bottom and the crisp on top!  I think it's best using fresh fruit and serving warm with vanilla ice cream melting on top!

I have made this fruit crisp over and over! We love it!!! I have made it using less butter and once with the full recipe recommended. We like it with 1 c in stead of 1.5 c of butter. I use 5 cups of triple berry frozen mix from Costco. The Kirkland brand. So good! I have also used less sugar and my husband didn't notice :-)

I really liked it, but felt it was too sweet. It needed more contrast of flavor. I think I will add lemon juice to the berries and cut the sugar. I really doesn't seem necessary.

I made this with wild raspberries and black berries that grow around my property every year along with some blueberries and it came out amazing. Will totally be making this again.

This recipe is outstanding!   This will be a new family go-to in our home during berry season.  I added a half cup of extra berries and used part fresh and part frozen because that's what I had on hand.

As the recipe says, it works well using only one type of berry as well. Tastes great, and the wild blueberries I used were sweet enough so I didn't have to add any sugar to them.

This was easy and delicious using fresh berries. Great summertime dessert. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was gobbled up at the get-together I attended. If I made it again, I would probably cut the white sugar down as the berries didn't need that much. But a great recipe. I highly recommend trying it!

The only change I made to this recipe is that I halved it (knowing the only other resident in the home wouldn't partake), otherwise I made it true to spec. It's positively sinful how good this dish is. And versatile! Breakfast, dessert, midnight snack -- it's good at any time, anywhere. Eat up! Thanks!

I really liked the Triple Berry Crisp but I think next time I will increase the berries.  I really like the berries  but that is just a personal preference.  Homemade whipped cream or vanilla ice cream is good but the desert is good without it.

An explosion of  fresh fruit flavor!  This dessert was easy to make and was delicious with vanilla ice cream on top.  It was a hit at dinner - and was good the next day too!

It fell apart on me when I served it, so next time I'll scoop it and serve it in dessert cups instead of trying to serve it on dessert plates.  That way, I'll have a better presentation.

I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I used most of the dough for the bottom and reserved 1/3 for the crumble. I added some agave to the berries but mainly because they were really sour. I used cherries and black raspberries. It had a good fruit to crust ratio and still retained a tart flavor. I can imagine the mure butter, the tastier, but this was quite yummy and didn't make me feel as guilty.

This was really good - followed other recommendations - used less butter, also used less flour.  Made with 6 cups of mixed fruit (a combination of thawed frozen, and fresh).  I drained out the extra juice from the thawed fruit and I think that helped.  Can't wait to try it again with peaches - and thinking of adding in chopped walnuts to the dry mix too.

I wanted to do all blueberries, so used 4 cups of blueberries and 1 cup of white sugar since I wasn't sure how sweet it would be. I also used light brown sugar. It was a huge success. Enjoyed it so much.

I've made this recipe for years and people always ask for the recipe.  I love it.  The only thing I do differently is add whatever other fruit I have so it still adds up to 4 1/2 cups of fruit.  I've added chopped peaches or apples or rhubarb, anything so it's not just three berries.  For this reason I call it Triple Berry Crisp Surprise.  The surprise is that I never use just three berries!

Great idea and had a good taste... I needed to almost double the berries to cover the bottom crust. Need to make sure the bottom crust gets done as mine needed another 5-10 mins even though the top appeared done. I think I'll use a little less flour next time so it's more "crispy" and less like a crust on the bottom.

By far one of my favorite recipes on here. Super simple and holds well.. Make some home made whipped cream for a topping or some vanilla ice cream. Delicious. Making again tonight for Game of thrones party :) will be adding strawberries tonight.

Great recipe, very heavy on the butter.  As recommended by an earlier review, I will try 1c of butter next time I make it.  I was surprised it wasn't too sweet, considered adding some lemon juice, but taste was great.

This was good, but way too sweet.  The berry part was good and still retained some tartness, but the crisp bit was way too sweet.  Next time I would use only 1/3 (or maybe less) brown sugar.  Might try this again but wouldn't break any land speed records to do it.

I doubled the recipe to make one for family and one for a girls dinner.  Followed recipe exactly with fresh berries. Took them both out of the oven, packed one in Rachel rea casserole travel bag (while still hot).  I tasted the one staying home and was disappointed at how dry it was. The one in bag stayed hot in bag for about two hours......the steam in bag must have made crisp moist and it was much better- I did get compliments and all was eaten, Don't know how to fix it to not have to add the "steam" step!!  For one thing, I would double the berries- do love the bottom crust- but topping disappointingly dry.

I was looking for a basic crisp recipe. There was way too much butter and too much flour in this recipe. I will use less flour and more oats (for more crunch) and less butter (for less fat) when I make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and I think it makes a great basis that you can adjust as needed for your own tastes. Some may like it as written (and a little sweeter) or with some minor adjustments to the sweetness.

I made it with the same amount of berries listed in the recipe but used a mixture of blueberries and raspberries only. The only other change was to follow the advice of others who used just 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar.  The sweetness, for me, was just perfect and I could still enjoy the tart taste of the blueberries. I also liked the sandwiching of the berries between the two layers of crisp. Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream -- oh yes! Will definitely make this again and experiment with other fruits that are seasonally available!

Great recipe! Easy to make and so tasty! I used local blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries which made it even more tasty. I served it with vanilla ice cream.

My alterations: I used gluten-free all-purpose flour and half the cinnamon and nutmeg because I didn't want strong spices in it. I also used maple syrup in the berries instead of white sugar just to have a healthier form of sugar in it. It tasted great! Just a little too sweet for me especially if you eat it with vanilla ice cream. I will probably try only one cup or maybe 3/4 cup of brown sugar next time.

I tried this recipe for our Memorial Day bbq.  Everyone thought it was fantastic.  I changed the recipe a little - used 1/2 the sugar, 1 cup of butter instead of 1 1/2, and I added more berries.  It was very good and I will be definitely be making it again.

Served this berry crisp at my book club with vanilla ice cream.  Great flavors for a warm spring evening.  I used 1 cup butter and 1 cup brown sugar. Any more butter would be greasy and any more sugar would be too sweet.  Used 2 cups of each berry and I think this should be a minimum or use less of the topping in a smaller pan.  Being a pie maker, I opted to cut the butter in and believe this would give you better results.  This would be great at a brunch served warm or possibly mixed with yogurt.  Thanks for the recipe, will do again.

There should be a warning label for how amazing and addictive this is! I added a bit more lemon juice to make it more tart, since I increased the oats mixture and didn't want it to be overly sweet. It tastes even better as leftovers!

I love to cook but have never really gotten into baking/deserts.  I had to make a desert for a pot-luck and decided to give this a whirl (plus all the berries were 1/2 price at the store that week!!)  Came out absolutely fantastic (followed recipe to a T except I melted the butter in the microwave first).  Whole group ate this up (should have made two in retrospect!).  You can't mess this up and it tastes sooooo  good!  Thanks for making me look like I can bake.  :)

Easy and very good! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan which I sprayed lightly with cooking spray. I used a frozen berry mix of strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, taking them out of the freezer about 1/2 hour before assembling. I took the advice of others and baked bottom crust first about 5 minutes. The crumb mixture was great, and I plan to try it with other fruit combos, i.e. peaches, apples, etc. The frozen fruit mixture already was sweetened, so I did not add any additional sugar, although it did taste tart to me. I think the scoop of vanilla ice cream took care of that!! Thanks Polly, great recipe! UPDATE 8/18/15: Made with mainly blueberries and one peach, and it was very good. I still did not add sugar to the fruits, and it was perfect. I cut back on the brown sugar in the topping, but will do half of the sugar another time. Also cut the butter in half and melted it as a reviewer suggested; that worked good, too.

Dangerous recipe! It is great if you have a dinner party. Throw it together quick before you serve your food, and put it in the oven while you eat dinner, then its ready!

I keep frozen fruit in my freezer so I can make this on the fly. I only use frozen fruit and there is no need to measure fruit. Just fill the bottom of your dish with fruit. 

I would not recommend melting butter. I tried this twice and it's a horrible mess, plus it doesn't spread evenly. It just gets concentrated in one area. Keep your butter at room temp, or a little cold. Also, 2 cups of white sugar is alot with the fruit (and it's natural sugars). Just sprinkle a little sugar on top of the frozen fruit.

Some reviewers mentioned putting the oat mix on the bottom, and then layering the fruit. This doesn't work well because it doesn't crisp, and turns mushy. 

This is delicious...enjoy!  But you have been warned...it's a slippery slope once you start to make it...

This recipe is a good starting off point.  I eliminated the nutmeg because I don't like it.  I used 1 1/2 cups of rhubarb compote and 1 1/2 cups of blackberries because that's what I had on hand, so a total of 3 cups of fruit instead of 4 1/2.  I reduced the crumb mixture to 2/3 because of the reduced fruit.  But even with the reduction there was just way too much crumble.  I used what seemed like a reasonable amount, probably about 1/2 an inch of each layer which I guess was a little less than half the original recipe.  And it was amazing!  I put the left over crumb mixture in the fridge and I will be making personal sized crumbles with the left overs.  Yum!

Great recipe.  May add some preserves to the next batch.  But I think the recipe has a mistake.  I think it's supposed to have 1 1/2 sticks of butter, not 1 1/2 cups.

This recipe is a definite keeper! I added finely chopped almonds to the crumble. And used blackberries, blueberries and fresh cranberries. This is a recipe that you can use any fruit with!

Great recipe! I used with just blackberries during blackberry season. This makes a HUGE crisp, but we love the crust and I normally double it, so even though I didn't use as much fruit as the recipe called for, it was PERFECT for us!

This was good, but needs a bit of tweaking to be great. My family likes crisps with strong fruit flavors. Adding that much sugar to the fruit and spices to the topping dulled the tartness of the fruit, especially since you're getting twice the crust on the top and bottom. I used frozen fruit, which made it nicely juicy, and added a cup of extra fruit, but I still could have used at least one cup more, maybe two. Other than using less nutmeg, the topping was excellent. The ratio made for slightly chewy corners, which were delicious. I'd never made a crisp that called for a crust on the bottom and pressed it too hard, which didn't let the oats cook all the way. I would recommend patting it into the pan. I'll definitely try it again to see if I can get it perfect for my family.

I cut the crisp recipe in half but still used all of the fruit in a 9 x 9 pan.  Used blueberries, raspberries, and peaches.  Only used 1/2 c. butter and cut down on the brown sugar.  Tasted fresh and summery!

Great recipe!  Very easy to make! I used bluberries, raspberries and strawberries and it tasted fantastic! I would recommend cutting back on the white sugar only use 1-2 tbs, since the berries themselves have sugar. Or skip the white sugar all together and add chocolate chips! YUMMY!

Made this last night for family and friends.......HUGE hit!  I only changed 2 things, I used all blackberries and cut back the butter by a 1/4 cup and will probably cut back to a half next time.  Very tasty recipe Polly! Thank you

Pretty good, but I'm agreeing with another reviewer, that it really could benefit from some salt.  I also will definitely add some walnuts or pecans to topping next time.

I made this just as written except for the addition of strawberries and substituting a 1/4 cup of white sugar for a 1/2 cup of brown sugar which I ran out of while making this. It is restaurant-quality good.

This recipe while it was okay as long as you put ice cream on top, it was sooo much better the 2nd time with a little work, I doubled the filling recipe and only put crumb mixture on top as it had way too much crust, added a little extra sugar or splenda to fruit so it would taste good by itself w/out having to cover in ice cream, I would also recommend fresh fruit and at least 6-8 cups, the frozen has too much juice and is alredy more mushy to start with and definetly bake it the full amount of time so top doesn't get soggy after the first day

Saw all the rave reviews so I thought it was safe to try for a dinner party without making one to test ahead of time.  I used fresh strawberries & raspberries and followed the rest of the recipe exactly as called for.  The crust did taste great and so did the berries - the reason for only 3 stars is because it came out really greasy.  1 1/2 cups of butter is WAY too much to add to this recipe.  After dishing out one serving, you could see the melted butter pooling up on the bottom of the baking dish...really unappetizing & too heavy for a crisp.  I will not give up on this recipe though, I am going to try making it again, but this time I will follow what several others have recommended with less butter.

I halved this recipe for dessert for two. Turned out delicious & my boyfriend loved it. Topped with vanilla ice cream, this crisp is out of this world! I omitted blueberries & used peaches instead. Next time, I will increase the fruit 1 cup & decrease the butter by 1/4 to 1/2. Skimpy fruit & too much butter (for my taste, and for health reasons) earned this dessert 4 stars. Will definitely make this again for just us or company!

I used all blackberries and margarine instead of butter, as that's what I had on hand.  I also cut the recipe in half, as there's only my wife and myself, here.  The crisp cam out yummy!  It was perfectly moist and the sweetness was just right.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I used only 1 cup of butter, and it still turned out great. Plus, I used gluten-free flour (Bob's Red Mill) and it tasted delicious.

I used ONLY blackberries b/c that's what I had, but I felt it needed way more than the amount suggested. I liked it though, but I know blueberries and rasberries cook down a bit, too, so I imagine I'd put in at least a couple more cups.

Yummy! I only used blackberries (a combination of wild plus a few store bought ones) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

This recipe was phenomenal! I used double the berries though because I didn't feel it filled the pan sufficiently. If you do use more berries, be sure to cook it 5-10 mins longer so that you can see the juices boiling. 

Instead of serving it with whipped cream, try vanilla ice cream when the dessert is still warm. It melts over the top for an amazing creation!

Delicious!  Only reason for 4 stars, I changed it; Splenda & Splenda Brown, reduced butter to 1 cup.  (I don't know why all the crisp recipes have you cut in the butter - it so much easier to melt it and mix).  We LOVED having a bottom crust!  YUM!

Though I cut the brown sugar and butter by 1/3, this was delicious.  I know more butter and more sugar would only have made it more rich and fabulous, I just couldn't justify the extra calories for myself.  I did use frozen berries, out of necessity, and I don't consider using whole wheat pastry flour a change, because I use it in everything, but if you do, then I changed that too.  Bottom line, this was easy and and the bowl in front of me is deep red & purple, and delicious.

This was a winner with my family.  I read many of the reviews and made some adaptions based on what I read.  I used 3 pints of fresh berries in a 9" square pan.  I cut the butter to 3/4 cup, the flour and oats to 1 1/2 cups, brown sugar to 1 cup, cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoon, and nutmeg to a little less than 1/2 teaspoon.  Even though I used a little more fruit than what was called for in a 9x13 pan, I felt there could be a little more fruit to balance out the yummy crust and topping.  I  have a large pan in the oven right now with 3 bags of frozen fruit.  I cut back the butter to 1 cup and left all the other ingredients as is.  I am hoping for an equally great turn-out.

Love this recipe. It's a big hit every time I make it, and I've made it with a variety of different fruits. I also cut down the butter to 1 cup, and double up the spices. So, so good.

This is just "ok"  Certainly not a 4 or 5 star.  The crust and top layer are of a very dry consistency.  I use allrecipes on a regular basis and the reviews are typically on target.  The ratings for this recipe, in my opinion, were far too high.

didn't care for the crisp layer on bottom made desert to gluey in texture, and I would use less blue berries if you want a tarter dessert.

Best Mixed Cobbler I've ever had! I used frozen berries and had to keep it in a little longer (10 min for my oven).  It goes great with Tangy Whipped Cream (1 c hvy cream, 1/2 c sour cream, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla) Yum~

This recipe was so easy to make!  It was so delicious and convenient to make during berry season.  I used fresh, but could've used 1pkg frozen.  I also cut back on some of the sugar and butter.  You could probably also use honey to drizzle on the berries instead of sugar.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!! I have made this several times in just the past month. I made it for 2 4th of July parties, my monthy girls night and again just for my hubby & kids. The crisp is perfect!! Everyone raves about this dish! It is so simple to make. I use a mixture of whatever berries I have on hand so blackberries, raspberries, blueberries & strawberries as well as peaches have gone into this dish. They all taste delish in any combo! I also used more berries then what the recipe called for. About an additional 1 1/2 to 2 cups. The only other change I made was to cut down on the white sugar. The berries alone produce enough sweet juice so you only need about half of the sugar.

I cut this recipe down for 6 or 8 and make it in individual ramekins.  It makes an very impressive dessert for company.  I add about a 1/2 C of coconut to the top crumble.

Made this on sunday for my family, was a hit. Had issues finding rasberries, in the end found some. One of the things I would change, is put more of the  crips on the bottom, and less on the top. Might sprinkle sweet and low on the berries instead.  Was wondering if anyone has made this but  used other fruits, example  peach, apple, ect..  Will make again. (will cut the butter in using my food processer on the pulse, my arm still hurts today from cutting it in!)

This is a great mix of berries.  I loved the taste!  The only problem I had was after it had cooled down the topping was dry.  Then the next day after being covered it got soggy.  It still tasted wonderful and we finished the whole crisp.  Just do not know how to make the topping better.

Loved it!   When I was making the triple berry crisp I thought I was doing it wrong and it was questionable on how it would turn out.  But it was amazing!  I knew it was going to be good when I was cutting a piece and it looked so delisious.  The whole family loved it!!!

Used only black raspberries, and served it with a raspberry ripple ice cream- absolute perfection!  I suggest adding a little bit of lemon juice and cinnamon to the berry mixture, to give it a little extra tang.

My go to recipe. I originally made this for my mother's birthday. I always use Blackberries ( tartness) and Blueberries ( for the sweetness) I have made this 6-7 times by now. I couldn't wait for the Blueberry prices to come down so I could make them this summer. I am making this today for the 4th of July BBQ. Awesome with Vanilla Ice Cream.

YUM! I used half sugar/ half splenda on the fruit. Added toasted almonds to the topping. This recipe has the perfect ratio of "crisp" to allow the fruit to be the main attraction.

This recipe is so easy and so good.  Some of the recipes on allrecipes are rated very good, but then I try them and am disappointed.  This is not one of these recipes at all.  I would recommend this to anyone, esp those who are cooking challenged like myself.

Wow! Great Crisp Recipe! I even used 2 bags of frozen blackberries (instead of fresh triple berry mix) and it was just perfect! I did have to add a little extra sugar to the berries. I cant wait until the berries are in season this year. I'm sure this will be on our table frequently. Thank you for sharing!

Very good, but TRIPLE the amount of fruit.  I doubled the fruit, and it was still dry.  I would definitely triple or quadruple the fruit portion.  Other than that, the "crisp" part was delicious!  Enjoy!

The crisp was dry. There was too much crust/topping and not enough fruit. The topping/crust wasn't sweet enough.  I won't be making this recipe again.

This was a very good recipe.  I added about a half cup of diced rhubarb which makes it very tangy. Next time I make it I will probably add more fruit.  There is alot of crust so think it could benefit from more fruit.

Just got done baking and eating a slice. Very delicious! I'm bringing the rest to my mom's for our New Years Eve dinner (I had to try a slice while it was fresh out of the oven!). I DID make some minor adjustments based on other reviews I read. I added about an extra cup of berries and I also cooked it in the oven for about 20min longer since I wanted the topping to be more crunchy.

Nothing special or impressive, though it was still edible, it wasn't what I was expecting.  It also took a lot longer to cook than it was supposed to.

I couldn't believe how perfect this came out!  I LOVE the taste of the berries and the smell was absolutely HEAVENLY! I baked it for the time suggested & turned off the oven leaving it in there for about 10 minutes longer and the crisp on top was PERFECT!  Thanks for an amazing recipe, this is a favorite, hands down!

This recipe turned out great. I didn't have quite enough fresh fruit so I added about 1/2 a cup of frozen raspberries and it still turned out well. You could scale down the topping recipe though

This is a wonderful recipe. I've made it a couple times now. Where we live we have a lot of fresh blackberries to use and then I had frozen blueberries to go with them. Didn't have any raspberries although I'm sure it would be wonderful with them as well. The blackberries & blueberries turned out great served with a some vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. It doesn't turn out mushy if you thaw the frozen berries and drain them well. I will definitely make this again.

Easy to make and this recipe was a big hit with my co-workers. Word of caution, if you use frozen fruit, be sure that it has been thoroughly defrosted and drained otherwise you will get a lot of excess liquid in the bottom of your crisp. I used froze blueberries and ran into this problem. I elevated the pan to let the liquid pool then drained it off and then the crust was crisp like it should be. If I hadn't done that the crust would have been soggy.

Five stars for being so fast, easy, simple and very tasty! I followed the ingredients exactly except that my fruit was frozen. I also melted the butter in the pan it was going to cook in, (as another viewer suggested). Worked out just fine. I think it took me all of 10 minutes to put together and throw in the oven. Definitely will be doing it again.

I've made this recipe twice, it's wonderful.  The second time I didn't add any white sugar to the fruit, I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup and reduce the butter by half.  I used fresh peaches and blueberries and it was sooo yummy!

Following the advice of other reviewers, I cut the amount of butter in half and also used only 1 cup of sugar for the crumble. I used fresh peaches and blueberries for the fruit which were already so sweet that I didn't add the white sugar.  This dessert was so delicious it got gobbled up at a dinner party and I got requests to make it for subsequent dinners!

really great recipe. This was my first time making a crisp. I brought it to a church function and it was a hit. I used 4 cups of frozen mixed berries instead of fresh, and topped it with whipped cream, YUM

Made this for a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I used extra berries, but kept everything else the same.  I filled a 2-cup glass measuring cup for both the raspberries and the blackberries and used just a tad over 2 cups of blueberries.  Topped with a little homemade whipped cream.  Yum!

*UPDATE*
I have made this several times and used various fruits...all kinds of berries, cherries, peaches, etc. I think just about any fruit, except citrus, would work. But it is some sort of berry crisp my husband always requests. So much so, it sometimes feels as though he married me for love of my crisp rather than me! ;)

I made this for my husband, son, & grandson, as I have them for lunch most everyday on the ranch. My grandson said that it was a 5 star dessert. It was very delicious, & super easy. A dollop of whipped cream to top it off, made it a BIG hit!

This was perfect.  After reading a review that used frozen berries I was a little nevous.  I made sure I thawed and DRAINED the berries well because I used a frozen berry mix.   I made this for my hubby, I don't like raspberries or blackberries (seeds) but this was over the top(I had to taste it).  Even my semi picky 5 year old liked it.  Thanks for a great one!

Exactly what I was looking for!!!  It smelled SO good while cooking.  Followed recipe exactly, except only used raspberries.  I liked the ratio of fruit/crisp.  Also liked all the butter - YUM!  This is excellent, and so easy!  Will be making this lots and lots!

This was good, but not great, and the presentation needs a little help. The dish came out runny, but I think that's because I used frozen berries, which is what I had on hand. I definitely suggest sticking to fresh if possible. I may play with this recipe.

Simple and delicious!  I used all black raspberries and it turned out great.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar and butter in the recipe.(used 1c brown sugar and 1c butter)  Will definitely make again.

Ok. Decent jumping off point. I would just say take everything everyone says into consideration. As always, we all tend to adjust it, However it's a great starting recipe. Thank you.

I added strawberries to the summer berry mix.  It came out fantastic!

Oh, and vanilla ice cream goes great with this! :)

Oddly we didn't like the texture of the oats in this...it was mushy with the juice of the berries. Okay flavor...would use my own crisp topping recipe with mixed berries next time.

This a totally awesome crisp that received two thumbs up from everyone who tried it! I will certainly make it again (in fact, I'll make it tonight!). 

I only had two very minor changes out of necessity. I only had 1 cup of blueberries so I increased the blackberries. I also used the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus Spice in place of the cinnamon/nutmeg. But these were so minor that it was extremely close to the original recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. 

I would recommend though to have it with vanilla ice cream. :)

Enjoy!

Oh, wow - this dish is very easy to make and SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly as shown, and it was excellent.  I served it warm with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, but it was delicious plain as well.  Definitely a keeper.

This was great!  I used a frozen triple berry mix, and I halved the recipe and put it in a 7x9 (lost my 8x8 pan somewhere).  It was sooo good with vanilla ice cream on top.  I would consider adding more fruit though.  I don't think you could add too much fruit to this.  I'd probably double it. Delicious, fast and pretty good for you!

This was so easy! I didn't use all the butter the recipe called for, but most of it. I used peaches, blackberries, and blueberries and served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a hit! Def will make again.

Delicious!  As suggested, I used a bit more fruit and added some diced fresh peaches (had them around and they needed to be used!).  Outstanding with some vanilla ice cream.

So very yummy!  Even my DH who doesn't really like blueberries tried this and thought it was good.  I did cut the butter down on this but other than that I didn't change it.  Very easy and tasty for little effort!

This is a wonderful receipe.  I made it with only blueberries and raspberries.  I also put in a scant teaspoon of tapioca, so it would not be too runny, however I put a little to much.  Will use less next time.  I also used only 2 1/4 cup butter.  The full amount would have been just fine.  I also used only 1/2 of the white sugar in the berries, only because I do not like it too sweet.  Everyone in my family thought it was an excellent dessert.

this is a delicious recipe!  The only thing i would change is add less butter.  I made mine with 2 1/2 sticks and you can really taste the butter in the crumble.  It is good though!

This was so great!  It just disappeared everyone loved it so much.
I only used 2 cubes of butter (3 sounded like way too much) and it turned out fine.  I probably used more berries than it called for, I just dumped all 3 packages in the bowl with out measuring, but it turned out awesome.

This was very good! I used blueberries, peaches, some strawberries, blackberries and rasberries and used half brown and half white sugar on the fruit and added a little lemon. 
I did use all the butter in the crisp mixture...it needed it. It did make A LOT of topping, so next time I'll probably add more fruit. It was yummy!

This is a great summer dessert.  I think I may cut the crisp recipe in half and just do 1 layer on the top instead of 2 layers.  It was a tad too much butter for me. 
But overall, great for a bbq!

Just made this earlier tonight. Followed the recipe using blueberries and blackberries for the fruit. My only other tweak was the addition of a couple of tablespoons of demerara/turbindo sugar in place of half the white sugar and fruit mixture.

We LOVE this! Easy to prepare and tastes terrific.

Excellent!  I used frozen blueberries and it was perfect.  I did cook it a little longer than stated as it didn't look done in the center.  May have been due to the frozen berries.  Thank you!

I make this recipe again and again. I usually use frozen mixed berries; that way, I can keep every single ingredient on hand in the pantry and freezer for an easy, wonderful, spontaneous dessert.

This was just okay.  I wasn't a big fan of the crisp... it wasn't very crunchy.  I did use less butter than called for, so maybe that's why.  There was plenty of topping though.

Turned out perfectly (baked a total of 35 min). Ended up using only 2 sticks of butter total (would have been a lot easier with a pastry blender). Also, I used an extra cup or two of berries.

My crisp never seemed to cook. The berries cooked but the flour never browned.  I did reduce the amount of butter used, but that was my only change. Tasted pretty good, but i dont know if id make it again.

I would rate this as 9/10. It was really good.  I cut the butter down to about 1 cup and added extra berries.  I used frozen berries not fresh. I doubled the spices.  The baking time was probably a bit less than an hour, I'm not sure though as I didn't set the timer.  This is the best crisp recipe that I have made.

This was a good berry crisp and the company that I made it for seemed to like it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added extra fruit and was glad that I did.  Also, next time I think I'll use something other than the blackberries as I found them a bit 'seedy' in the crisp (just a personal preference there).

Fabulous dessert!  I used fresh blackberries and raspberries, but couldn't find fresh blueberries so I used dried and they worked out wonderfully.  Served warm with a dollop of freshly whipped cream, this makes a yummy dessert.

This is the best crisp recipe I have ever found.  I use fresh blackberries (sometimes frozen) and everyone loves when I make this including the neighbors so we always have to make two.

I have made this recipe many times and I ABSOLUTELY love it! I have done all combo of berries and every time it is fantastic! I love that there is crust and topping...it is like a yummy berry pie with struesal topping underneath and on top. My hubby loves it slightly warmed with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.  ;)
Plus I just measure my berries and adjust the recipe until it matches what I have and adjust the size of pan and cooking time accordingly. If I am short...smaller crisp.

Trying this recipe for the first time, I opted to follow it and not make any changes. Next time I will heed the advice of others and use  less butter.

This is very good and simple to make.  I like to use blackberries which are all over the city during the summer.

The absolute best crisp recipe - and so easy.  I used half fresh blackberries and half blueberries.  Didn't have any nutmeg so used a bit more cinnamon.

I modified the recipe a bit when I needed something to take to a potluck. I wanted individual-size yummies, so I picked up some small dipping bowls that could be put in the oven and filled them with the triple berry crisp. Yum! Big hit. I'm making it again for another potluck...

This was alright-- not as amazing as I'd hoped.  I used frozen berries as so many other posters did, but they were soggy and it was quite obvious they were not fresh berries.  The recipe itself was good, just not fantastic.

What a great find! I used the wild black berries that were growing on our property (don't worry they aren't poisonous and I washed them) and added a bag of frozen mixed berries as well. The spices complimented the fruit so well and added a nice 'bite.' I served this warm with some homemade vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

Very easy and tasted wonderful.  Mine didn't "crisp" up the way I would have liked it to.  I don't know what I did wrong, but I will definitely still make this again.

I have made this 3-4 times now. Each time, it seems, the recipe just gets better & better. My family & co-workers both LOVE the granola style crust/topping & the large amount of fruit flavor. Definitely a winner!

This was an excellent recipe.  I used blueberries, strawberries, and cherries.  It was so good that my husband ate about half the pan the first night I made it!!  I'm sure that this would be delicious with just about all fruits.

Tasty, but overly rich and sweet.  I only used 1 cup of butter but the crisp was still SO rich and heavy it just sits in your stomach.  A couple spoonfuls is all anyone at the party could eat.

Wondefful...The crisp topping is awesome..I love it on top and bottom. I didnt have blackberries but it worked out just the same I added a bit more sugar because the raspberries and Blueberries can be tart. I will use this recipe with other fruits too like apple, peach strawberry rhubarb YUM!!!

This was very good.  I used all blackberries, next time I am going to try it with fresh cherries.

Very good and easy too make. Next time I will add rhubarb and appples for a bit more substance. But delicious for sure! Worth a try!

I've made this twice, both times using different combinations of frozen instead of fresh berries.  This was very easy to make, not a lot of ingredients, and is very yummy.  Served it both warm and cold to guests and they LOVED it each time.

The topping was really good!  I had bags of fresh picked blackberries, so just added some sugar to this and then the topping.  My guests were pleased!

I made this for company and everyone loved it. I could not find raspberries so I left them out. I used 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and 2 1/2 cups of blackberries. I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. It was wonderfull!!

Served with vanilla ice-cream, it was very good.  My husband had seconds.
