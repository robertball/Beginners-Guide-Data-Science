I added 7 cups of liquid ( more water than broth). The ham that is on the ham bone was enough ham for the soup. So easy and delicious!

I loved this recipe! Don’t change a thing. I had to use a slow cooker because I was out all day and I might have added to much water because of the size of the pot. Consequently it was a tad thinner than I wanted after 6 hours. Solved that problem by adding a cup of milk and continued cooking on low for a total of 8 hours.

Made it as written using a spiral cut ham bone. Didn’t add any salt due to the saltiness of the ham, and didn’t need it. Was absolutely delicious!

Made in Ninja 3 in 1 & slow cooked on high for 3 hours after sautéing veges.   Also added a ham bone I had leftover for stock because I had it & I didn’t have enough chicken stock.  Added some diced potatoes & I sliced the carrots (about a cup) because I like them like that.  Came out delicious!
