This is a great recipe.  I recommend cutting the potatoes into 4ths as it makes for smaller bites when eating.
The flavors are great.  The red onion, Kalamata's and the vinegar work really good together.  I give this 6 stars.

My husband and I both really liked this.  It was a lot more elegant than regular potato salad.  I used red wine vinegar instead of the rice or malt vinegar.  Next time I might add a bit more for punch.  I left out the 3 TBS of olive oil at the end.  There was no need for it - it would have only made the whole thing greasy.

This is a great version of my old roasted potato salad recipe. This one calls for mayo (I substituted fat free ranch) and that helped the garlic stick to the potatos. I also added a little pickle juice to the vinegar and tripled the garlic.  Any way you do it, this is far better and much more versitle than the mashed potato salad recipes.  It goes well warm or cold and makes a great topping for green salad as a leftover.

This recipe is fabulous.  It's unlike anything on the pot luck table and everyone who tried it RAVED about it.  This is going to be one of my standards.

A very tasty potato salad.  Baking the potatoes retains the nice red skin color in addition to retaining flavor.  I refrigerated them overnite which facilited slicing them into perfect slices that do not fall apart.  I used white balsamic vinegar and only 1/2 teaspoon of thyme which is the max I could use unless you love thyme. A nice twist on regular mayonaisey potato salad.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both thought this was excellent. I eyeballed the herbs and ommitted onions, but didnt think it detracted anything. I will definitely make this a lot and it would be an excellent potluck dish.

I have made this recipe a few times now and love it, but decided to add a review after taking it to a BBQ yesterday. My bowl was completely gone while the regular mayo potato salad just sat there!! So many compliments on it! I have only made it with capers and feel that it is perfect with a bit of the caper juice added. Definately serve it at room temperature, it loses something otherwise. YUMMMM-Y.

I also omitted the oil in the dressing. I didn't have olive when I tried this recipe. I have made it twice. The second time I cut some bacon into small pieces and roasted with potatoes. I also added 1 teaspoon English Mustard into the dressing and sliced 5 radishes mixed into the salad. The crispy bacon, the pungent flavor of mustard and radish made this potato salad even better!!

It was a good change from traditional potato salad, and I like the idea of roasting the potatos.  However, the kalamata olives were too strong in proportion to the dish, and so it wasn't a knock your socks off experience for my guests.  I would probably make again, but reduce kalamata olives and include some other ingredients like chopped celery.

Excellent! I add a small spoon dijon mustard at end.  Also, add more olive oil at the roasting stage and exclude the olive oil at the end.  Perfect.

This was good. I decreased the olives to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup capers. It was a very pretty dish and had nice texture.

I didn't like this.  It was similiar to my roasted potatoes but i like my recipe for those better and it was nothing like potato salad.  I did get the potatoes a bit overdone since i already had something in my oven i used my speed oven so that could have been part of it but i'll stick to regular potato salad.

I really like this salad. A nice alternative to the traditional cream based potato salad. My husband however, did not like it, but I think if I'd called it something other than "potato salad" he would have been OK. He's not too flexible with variations on classics. I would recommend it highly for anyone not too set in their ways!

Awesome potato salad recipe! Just what I was looking for to go with our brats on the grill tonight. I left out the olives, as I didn't feel they were necessary (and I didn't have any - hah)!  They would have been good in it as well.  I love the tip about putting the potatoes in the oven while the oven is cold.  That worked really well, and if others are wondering about cooking time - I started timing once the oven was up to temperature, and I did add 5 minutes longer, just to get them nice and browned.  This one is going into the recipe box!  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I used capers instead of olives because I had them on hand, and I think it added the same kind of taste. Great for barbecues!

These were quite possibly the best potatos I have ever had.  I have never actually used the herbs de Provence---just what ever herbs I had on hand---but each time they were excellent.  The olives, mayo and vinegar make such a great sauce...more like glaze for these potatos.  It is the kind of recipe that if you are not careful, you will have eaten them all standing at the counter before you can ever get them to the table.  I now always roast potatos the way this recipe says, starting in a cold oven.  Can't say more how great these are!

Wonderful, warm or cold! I used cured, nicoise olives, not having kalamata and it was lovely.

The best part is the low quantity of mayonnaise, cutting back on fat and calories, but no less moist and flavorful.

This was great. I did leave the oil out of the dressing just to cut some fat. This was a wonderful side dish to the grilled steak we had. Thanks for an easy weeknight side!

This was awesome!  I had to add a bit more oil to the dressing to balance out the vinegar flavor.  I also had to cook the potatoes a little longer, but that may be because I cooked them in a jellyroll stoneware.  Otherwise, I followed it to a T.  This recipe is a keeper!

Awesome recipe. Love the dressing! The briny olives worked great alongside the natural sweetness of the onion and caramelized potato. Delicious.

I added capers.  I would go easy on the salt as the capers and olives added enough to season the dish.  Very good!

Yum!  I can't wait to make this again.  I didn't have enough kalamata olives, so I added some capers.  Also, as suggested, I only added 2 T olive oil to the dressing rather than 3 T.  So delicious, and very gourmet!

This looks and tastes GREAT when warm (just made) but after a night in the fridge, the poatatoes look a little squidgy and not that attractive.  Still tastes good but I recommend eating warm when just made.

A nice change of pace from the usual potato salads.  I did decrease the amount of oil used.

This is the potato salad recipe I've been waiting for. I made it exactly as the recipe states, just double the garlic. It came out fantastic! Thank you so very much!

Excellent flavors, the onions and dressings add the perfect bite to the potatoes.  I substituted kalamata olives with capers to serve as side with seafood, delicious!

Delicious! The potatoes were perfectly roasted and seasoned.  I made the dressing in a jar with a lid and shook it up until it was completely blended.  I picked my parsley out of my garden just before adding it to my salad.  The only thing I didn't have was a small red onion so I substituted a couple of small shallots and it was just perfect.  I LOVE this recipe!  Thank you for posting this!

The sauce make it great. I sautéed finely chopped onions (1/4 red onion) with a pressed clove of garlic. I pulled it off the heat. When the pan was warm I put in the mayo (substituted vegan Mayo) and rice wine vinegar to mix and melt together.   Potatoes for 20 min was a little over done on the bottom, I'll probably go for a little less time next. There will be a next time, it was very tasty.

This is delicious. I've made this several times according to directions and will make it many more. Enjoy!

Edited to add: the potatoes, roasted with the olive oil, special herbs, salt, and pepper, are utterly phenomenal, even on their own. I plan to use this truly magical, simple little blend  the next time I want roasted potatoes  as a side dish. YUM. YUM. YUM!

This was a nice change from your typical side dish.  I cut my potatoes in fourths and next time will cut them even smaller.  Everyone at my table seemed to like it and it all got eaten so that's always a good sign!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I loved this recipe, I didn't have olives therefore I used artichoke hearts and tripled the garlic... Yummy! I will make this again for sure!

I made this for a party yesterday, and everyone loved it.  My husband is not a big foodie, and he told me after the party that this was excellent.  I'll be making this a lot in the future.

I made these tonight for my husband and a dinner guest. They were a big hit! Only change was I used 1/2t each of ground rosemary, oregano, and thyme. I ended up cooking them slightly looker than stated, about 35 minutes because my pork chops were still cooking. But they were great, nice and soft and very tasty. I'm making them again in two nights for another dinner guest.

After reading the different reviews, I just decided to leave it as is.  It was just wonderful warm fork and knife tender.  There were no leftovers so I'll have to make it again to see how it taste cold.  Thanks for the post.  Nice different take on potatos.
