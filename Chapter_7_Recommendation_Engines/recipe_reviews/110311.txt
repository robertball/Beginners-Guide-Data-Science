Simply delicious! Plus you look like a genious in front of kids! Another great thing about this recipe is you can use this as a starting point and get really creative. I used chocolate wafer cookies and chocolate chip cookies and made some with vanilla ice cream and some with chocolate ice cream. When it comes to rolling the ice cream sandwiches I used all kinds of stuff: mini chocolate chips, mini M&M's, toffee pieces, toasted coconut, choppped peanuts, crushed Oreos....etc.  These definitely are a hit and a really cool and tasty treat! Thanks cookin'mama for a great recipe!

OK, so we didn't quite follow the recipe verbatim!  My dear stepdaughter made these using her homemade chocolate chip cookies, Haagen Dazs Dulce de Leche ice cream, and mini-chocolate chips; then we drizzled them with caramel & chocolate syrups, & used one as a birthday cake, as you'll see in the posted photo.  It was fun and delicious!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cookin'mama!

I made these for the kids on their last day of school as a treat. I used oreos for theirs and strawberry icecream because it is their favorite. But, I made the hubby and I some using Pecan Sandies, chocolate icecream, and rolling them in crushed chocolate covered expresso beans. WOW they were good! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these before and find taste tasty but messy, both to make and to eat. I use these thin, flat chocolate wafers, and spread with home made whipped cream (whip a pint of heavy cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla until very stiff.) Then, spread a little on an oblong plate; spread some of the whipped cream on each cookie and (after you have a few together) stand VERTICALLY on the plate. After the whole box of cookies is done, frost the entire "log" with the remaining whipped cream. Cover and refrigerate several hours. After a couple of hours in the 'fridge, the crisp cookies will absorb moisture from the whipped cream and become cake-like. Slice the "log" on the diagonal for a REALLY tasty chocolate/cream dessert. I find this less messy but just as good as the ice cream version!

Great - easy recipe that my family and friends love!  Easy way to make a tasty portion controlled treat.  The longer the chocolate wafer cookies stay in the freezer - the softer they become, almost like traditional ice cream sandwiches.  Also - I made this again with chewy chocolate chip cookies - the opposite holds true for the "chewy" store bought cookies - they get harder the longer they are in the freezer - beware!

Just the ticket for a fun, easy, pretty dessert that everyone enjoyed!  I've also used chocolate chip, oatmeal, and plain sugar cookies, dipped in sprinkles of all sorts.  They were all great!  Thank you for such a fun submission!

Yummy!! Everyone really liked these. I found the chocolate wafer cookies, no problem. I also did some with chocolate chip cookies. Decorated with mini chips, and rainbow sprinkles. I made these up in advance, wrapped each one in saran and stored in the freezer until dessert time. Thanks for a fun recipe!

WOW! WOW! WOW!  I used Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies and rolled them in mint chocolate chips.  I froze the cookies first so the chocolate wouldn't get all over my hands.  These were small which was good because the ice cream didn't have time to melt when you ate them; and, if you were counting calories, there were less.  I made both chocolate and vanilla ice cream sandwiches and they were equally as good.  Thank you cookin'mama for sharing your recipe!

Ok, heads up..DO NOT MAKE THIS IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR WAISTLINE!! This is a great, versitile recipe. You can use chocolate chip/macadamia nut cookies if you do not like oreos. I have made it with each kind and is as delicious either way.

FANTASTIC! I couldn't find the wafer cookies so I used double chocolate chip cookies from the bakery. I used homemade vanilla ice cream & I rolled  in a mixture of mini-chocolate chips & toffee bits .(I let them sit out for  3 to 5 minutes before rolling so the bits would adhere better but don't walk off & leave them) My grandsons loved these ...thanks cookin'mama!

Tasted very good but it melted pretty quickly. I recommend to frezze them longer than you think you need to.

Great and super easy. I made these for my daughters preschool class and they were a huge hit with all the kids.  Also they were way easier to transport than cupcakes or something that can get smooshed.  I would definitely make these again.
