I'm rating this a 3* rating rather than a 5 simply due to the difficulty of the recipe and the presentation.  If you look past how awful they look, they tasted awesome! If it was a little easier to make and they looked like what you would envision them to look, they would get 5 stars. But I did make this recipe over 2 years ago when I was first starting to cook, so maybe I should give them another shot now that I know what the heck I'm doing...So I think I will change the rating to 4* :)

This was phenomenal; however, we did make some variations. We used crab instead of shrimp. Also, we added fresh herbs to the cheese cause. We slightly pan seared the crab cake before adding it to the lobster tail. This is definitely a favorite!
