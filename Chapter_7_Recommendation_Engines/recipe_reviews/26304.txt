This was an excellent recipe until we added the 
cheese.  With all the fresh veggies it tasted wonderful as it was cooking.  When we added the ricotta it was terrible.  We made it again and just served the fresh sauce on pasta, it was great!

After hours of cooking this turned out horrible. There are 4 adults and 2 children at my table and none of them liked it.

This recipie was very good.  If you substitute a tsp of crushed, dried red peppers for the fresh red peppers, it gives the sauce a serious kick.  This sauce also freezes quite well.

This is sooooo tasty! Before reading any of the reviews, I chose to leave out the Ricotta as I was looking for a meatless tomato base, not a creamy base. I also added 2 grated carrots and a couple extra cloves of grated garlic. Also, I used canned/chopped tomatoes as I didn't have time to boil/skin/mash them and it turned out excellent. This is for sure a keeper! Add a nice ceasar salad and dinner is served!

Was looking for a good, chunky meatless pasta sauce and this was pretty good.  After reading reviews, skipped the ricotta. I also added lots of fresh basil and a couple of diced carrots.

very good but a little too chunky for the little ones!  I put it in a blender to make it a little smoother.

Lacked salt and the amount of tomato paste tended to give it somewhat of a bitter taste.  Good base recipe, but would tweak it.  Be careful if using a crockpot to be sure & check after 5-6 hours.  Sauce may start to burn after 6 hours depending on your crockpot.

Very good!  I left the ricotta cheese out and add that to the sauce on the noodles.  It makes a lot; there are several containers in the freezer ready to reheat for a quick meal.

I took hints from previous comments and eliminated the ricotta and used 1 tablespoon crushed dried red pepper flakes instead of the chili powder.  I added ground white pepper and some ground sea salt to bring out the flavor.  I used a food processor to blend ALL of the vegetables into a thick chunky paste and then sauteed the blend in the butter for about 15 minutes before adding the tomatoes.  Lastly, because I wanted more of a bolognese, I sauteed 1 pound of very lean ground beef and added it to the sauce before simmering it on the stove for about six hours.  The result was the absolutely most delicious spaghetti sauce I have ever made or enjoyed anywhere. I will admit that next time I will use a little less brown sugar although I do think it's an important ingredient that counterbalances the acidity of the tomato paste.  This makes a lot so will be freezing the leftovers for future use.

I made this using little tomatoes from my garden and a can of diced tomatoes for the correct amount. The rest of the recipe was made exactly with the exception of the cheese at the end. Wonderful flavor and better than anything you can buy. Be ready to save some in the fridge. This made enough for three spaghetti dinners for my wife and me.

I have been making this sauce for many years with my own changes to suit my family's taste. I leave out the ricotta and mushrooms and add ground sausage meat (I use 4 mild Italian sausages and remove the casing) use the same pan you cooked the veggies in to brown the meat, add it to the sauce and simmer according to the directions.
