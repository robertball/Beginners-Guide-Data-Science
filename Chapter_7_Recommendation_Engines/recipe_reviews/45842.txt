This is a great new way for me to cook portabello mushrooms.  I served each mushroom over a small bed of spinach and sprinkled each with balsamic vinegar and parmesean cheese and served with a side of warm lentil stew.  An awesome vegetarian dinner!

Very good!  Cooked this recipe twice already.  If you like basalmic vinegar try adding it in with the olive oil along with a little white wine.  It compliments this recipe.

Recipe good but needs some punch.  The next time I'd use a marinade for the mushrooms and broil them, then add them to the veggie mixture. Also this time I used feta cheese instead of the parmesan - added more flavour.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I make this and put it in tortilla warps and make veggie quesadillas, or add it to my scrambled egg beaters. Makes for a very lo-cal, and satisfying meal. YUM-O!

This is a good base recipe. I think you need to add a little more flavor for the mushrooms to soak up. I used soy sauce or teriyaki sauce, both are great.

This was one of the best recipes I have tried so far!  The flavor was incredible, very filling but healthy.  I did make a few adjustments....I added the soy sauce while cooking, and dashed a bit of hot pepper sauce as well as a bit of cayenne and red pepper flakes near the end of cooking as well.  It had a slight bite, but overall great flavor....loved those portobellos!!!  Try this recipe!

I made this like a stir-fry, with frozen vegeatables and served it over rice. It was flavorful,healthy and filling, although I would consider it a "light" supper.

Wonderful! Used a little balsamic vinegar. My new favorite! I also melted one slice of reduced fat smoked provolone. I made burgers for the guys and had this for myself. Yummy!

An excellent recipe definitely worth repeating!  I never understand why some people give this, or any other, recipe a poor rating because of an admitted *cook's error*.

I've never had Portobello Mushrooms before, but a friend convenience me to give this recipe a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They were firm and very tasty.  I may never have a hamburger again.  I took the advice of others and added balsamic vinegar to the oil before cooking.   FABULOUS… thanks for sharing.

I switched out red bell pepper for the green, just because I prefer them. I also added crumbled goat cheese and served it on grilled focaccia. YUM!

Very good.  I'm a fan of portobello mushrooms.  I still think they are best on the grill, however.  Nonetheless, this dish was very good.  I added a little green onion to the recipe. I served it with fried brown rice (with soy sauce).

We really wanted a light meal after all the "holiday eating" and these were perfect.  They still filled us up, but did not feel so heavy.  I followed what others said and added some white wine and balsamic vinegar (not too much) right before adding the mushrooms.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  So good!  We'll probably do these in the summer on the grill, too.  I served it with sauteed spinach and a side of confetti barley pilaf (from this site).  Perfect!

Really good, light, easy vegetarian recipe. Just a suggestion: don't cook the vegetables for too long before adding the mushrooms, they taste better if they're a little crunchy :) The dish is a little bland though - might try adding a few spices next time.

Delicious! I just added a little red bell pepper for color and left the veggies semi-crunchy, but those were just my preferences. This is wonderful just the way it is.  So you know, I'm a meat-eater trying to become a vegetarian; this with some brown rice kept me satisfied and happy while the rest of my family were eating a roast!

Yummy...I made this as a side dish rather than a main....I used a whole pack of baby bella mushrooms cut in quaters, 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange bell pepper  thin sliced , 1 vidalia onion sliced , to cloves of garlic minced and I also added some fresh cracked pepper, dried basil and parsley. Delicious along side BBQ grilled chicken breast.  Thanks!

We thought this turned out very well, I was worried that the juice in the mushroom would soak through the bread but had no problem at all.  We went a different route and added an Asian twist and used soy sauce and a bit of dried ginger with white pepper and a bit of rooster sauce for heat. We will try it again with some other kind of twist maybe with the balsamic and olive oil next time.

This was pretty good for how simple it was to prepare.  I added some worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and a dash of hot sauce to the veggies and mushrooms.  My whole family enjoyed it.

Really simple recipe. I added Teriyaki sauce to taste with the olive oil and a little more to the underside of the mushrooms. I also sprinkled a little Adobo seasoning and a few crushed red pepper flakes.  It was tasty.  I will make it again.

I grilled my mushrooms in a ceramic pan on an outdoor grill. I covered the pan with tinfoil to retain the moisture. I sautéed the onions and red peppers on the stove, caramelizing the onions before placing the veggies on a rosemary parmesan roll.

Added balsamic vinegar, but to my taste it still tasted a little bland. Will make again but will try tweaking for more flavour. Had with some small potatoes

These are so good. We altered it a little bit and used zucchini instead of green pepper, and it was amazing. I would advise to use hardy buns, as the ones we used turned a little mushy.

Very good. I too added some balsamic vinegar and some soy sauce to the olive oil. I paired it with some sautéed chard and rice - it was delicious!

I didn't really like this recipe but, again, it was prob my fault.  I did everything by the book but my caps didn't get done so I left it cooking for an additional 10 min to get the caps right.  By then the other veggies got way too smushy.  The flavors were OK though.  I think next time I may slice the mushrooms vs leaving them whole.

I used a 1/4 cup of Merlot when cooking the mushrooms. Adding extra garlic when cooking the vegetables and used Red, Yellow Peppers along with an Anaheim Pepper with chopped white onion. 
Just a bit of sea salt and did not add soy sauce as many recommended. I made garlic butter and added parmesan cheese and sprinkled some italian seasoning  and broiled them in the oven until golden brown. 
Then,  motzarella cheese on the mushrooms, covered them with the vegetables, and added a bit of water in the pan to melt it all together as they steamed. Bing! Delicious!

Followed the recipe & took advice from other reviewers by adding a splash of both balsamic vinegar & white wine. I served it over brown rice to add a bit more protein. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious. I did add low sodium teriyaki sauce and crushed red pepper. It was a hit and very filling. He loved it and wants me to cook again.
