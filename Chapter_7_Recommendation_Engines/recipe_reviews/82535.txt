Excellent. I wouldn't change a thing. My husband and I have made this recipe a Sunday morning tradition.

I made these for a brunch and no one liked them at all, neither did I.  I think they were way too sweet for my taste.  I wound up throwing them out.  However, the cheese blintzes I made from this site were out of this world.

On paper this recipe looked wonderful and so I had high hopes. However no one in my household liked these.
