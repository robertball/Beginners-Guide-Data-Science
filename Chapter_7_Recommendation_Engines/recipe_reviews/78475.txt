This was just okay. I had Sangria at a party some time ago and when I saw this recipe I thought I would give it a try. I think the problem is that it had too much Club Soda. I will make again with less Club Soda.

Very refreshing.  Definitely need to let it sit for a while before drinking.  Next time, I will peel the oranges before putting them in.
