By recipe it was to the top of my bread machine! Next time I plan to cut everything by 25% and use garlic salt instead of regular salt as well as double the amount. Otherwise it came out very well once I trimmed the unbaked dough off from the "overflow"

Love this bread, it goes with just about every meal be it chicken and rice casserole, beef stew, or just about any soup. I always bring this bread with a casserole when someone is sick at church (I am the pastor's wife, so my bread machine works overtime!!)

It was delicious. Even my picky 8 year old loved it. I had to take off a star because it rise so much it hit the top of the machine. Next time I'm gonna try it with 1 1/2 teaspoons yeast instead.

I modified the recipe to add 1 teaspoon of pizza seasoning and Italian seasoning in addition to others it listed and 1/4 c of Parmesan cheese. I also think it came out better when I had the bread maker make the dough then bake in the oven with an egg wash over the top.

This is my 2nd loaf I've made in my new bread machine....I made this today for my ''dinner guests'' ...Haven't sliced it yet, but it's very moist, smelled great while making too.. It rose all the way up to the top of my bread machine, but only a small spot touched... Can't wait till dinner!!! Will update more afterwards too!!  UPDATE:  My dinner guests LOVED this bread... nice & moist, full of flavor...one man ate 3 BIG PIECES of this with his dinner!!!  I toasted a slice this morning, YUMMY!!  The loaf stays very moist & soft...It's a KEEPER!!

12/2/16 UPDATE:  This is the only bread I make now.. My friends always ask for it, I even send some home with them!  The ''shelf-life'' is very short for them, they eat it quickly... I'm guessing I may need to make loaves for Christmas Gifts too!

This baked very nicely in my Zojirushi bread machine. I used the basic quick cycle as it called for bread machine yeast. I personally prefer a chewier and crispier bread to balance all the herbs. This was very much like a standard white bread. I am not familiar with the Macaroni grill, but can see this being popular. I tried it with the suggested cream cheese, but think it would be better with a garlic spread or butter. Was interesting to try.

Reducing the recipe by 25 percent, as recommended by another baker, successfully prevented bread from touching the lid of the bread machine. I substituted garlic salt for regular salt, as suggested by another baker. I had expected the bread to be a little more flavorful.

This is so easy to make and tastes great! Perfect to serve with soups or stews. I used AP flour and added 3 tsp. Wheat gluten to make it rise better. I added my liquids first, then dry ingredients and lastly the yeast. Perfect every time!

This was very good.  I used the dough only setting on my machine and baked it like a French loaf in the oven.  Was delicious with my beef stew.

Excellent.  Didn't change a thing.  Very flavorful.  Did not reach the top of the bread machine like others had complained about.

This is absolutely the best bread I've ever made. With or without the spices. The only change I made to this recipe is using bread flour instead of all purpose flour. It just about pushes the top of the bread machine open it gets so large.

Family loved it!!  I made 2 changes because I live at 9,200 ft.  (1) bread flour instead of AP; (2) 1.5 tsp active yeast instead of 2 tsp.

Making another loaf now!  Thank you! :D

Substituted bread flower for the recommended all purpose flour. Next time I think I will go with the all purpose. It came out very fluffy. A denser bread would be better for soup dipping.

I was disappointed with this bread.  For the first time in years, my loaf collapsed. The herb bread recipe that came with my bread machine is good, so I will go back to that one.

Wonderful bread!  Nice herby flavor in a light, soft bread.
Made a half-recipe to make a 1lb loaf.
