I've had this recipe for a few years and I love it.  It is a great compliment to any roast meal and especially nice for the holidays.  If you aren't into butter, sautee the onions in olive oil and omit buttering the bread. It still comes out great.  Evaperated milk (low fat or regular) compliments the sweetness of the onions. I have also used different creamed soups...cream of onion is really nice...and substituted worchestershire for the soy sauce.  Sprinkle a little more swiss cheese for the last few minutes of baking.

Wow. Good flavor. I used a mix of cheeses since I didn't have all the Swiss called for, and I didn't bother to butter the bread slices (which I cut up into 'fingers' for easier serving). Also, instead of canned cream soup I used the Cream Soup Base from this site. Very very tasty.

This was a great side dish.  It does taste like french onion soup.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half or try freezing half of it.  It makes a ton.  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup, low sodium soy sauce and skim milk.

Heavenly is right Meli! My only change was using buttered bread crumbs as a topping instead of the Italian bread. Added some garlic powder and black pepper to the onions as they sauteed. Delicious and thanks!

I used 3/4 of a loaf of french bread.  I sliced it in  1" thick slices.  (I think this made for a better presentation) I also used cream of chicken soup.  Guests raved how delicious it was!

I always try the recipe 'as written' before presuming to review it. This was really good.. well received by myelf, my husband and grown son.  It was a very satisfying side dish with our pork roast. The next time I made it I tweaked it..with... sourdough bread instead of italian, 3 sweet onions and 1 large red onion,  1/2 provolone and 1/2 swiss for the cheese..plus 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme and a splash of balsamic vinegar in the soup mixture.  It was extremely good too. Different 'notes' to experience between the two versions.  Loved them both. Still have not found my perfect tear free way of dealing with the onions tho. Anyway, great recipe! Thanks so much :)

I made this for 15 people for Christmas Dinner. It was a big hit. I cooked the onions in olive oil, added a bit of fat free butter spray, used a combination of skim milk and fat free half and half, fat free cream of mushroom soup and fat free swiss cheese slices. Everyone loved it.

I made this over the holidays and at dinner I was satisfied but not overly impressed.  But WOW, once reheated it was delish, so comforting.  I think by myself I went through the leftovers in a matter of a couple days.  I will try to make lower in fat next time and scale the servings down for a regular week night meal.  You should really try this one!

This was awesome!  It was so creamy and wonderful!  I will certainly make this again.  My family scarfed it up, they are picky some times.  It was easy too.  My only mistake was I bought bakery bread, and I think sliced bread would have fit/presented better in the pan.  But, I just cut it to fit and it was delicious.

I made this as "something different" for Christmas this past year.  It didn't go over very well because it didn't look that great, and I have so much to choose from at Christmas.  It tasted pretty good--maybe a little salty and a little mushy, but good.

Scratched on the butter and used whole wheat bread, added peas (yummy!), and made a half batch in about 2/3 of the oven time recommended.  Was sensational regarding how many "healthy" short-cuts I took.  It was perfect for something to whip up as a busy student in college on nights that I'm going veggie.

Having the swiss cheese char in the oven added a remarkable flavor profile and I will be adding more chopped veggies in there next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

FANTASTIC recipe. I served this as a side with steak and ribs on the grill. It disappeared in no time and got rave reviews. I caramelized the onions, used cream of celery soup and a small baguette for the bread. Made it three days ahead and let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to cook it. An easy make-ahead that I will definitely use again.

Appearance-wise, this looked a little mushy but taste-wise, this was amazing! I used rye bread as that was what I had and what I needed to use up. Cream of chicken was also all I had on hand. I had some leftover rice and poured some of this over it and it was good! Easy and would definitely make it again.

This tasted great! I think it tastes somewhat like french onion soup, without the broth of course. The only things I did differently was to use low salt soy sauce, 98 percent fat free soup, and added worchestershire sauce.( taste was still great.) As a reviewer already mentioned it would be very good as a side dish with meat---like a roast...I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Regularly get requests for this one. I swapped the soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce, though.
