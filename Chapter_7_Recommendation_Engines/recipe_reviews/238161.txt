Love this so did my family! I didnt have rosemary so I used thyme, which my husband prefers anyway, Also, I added zucchini and roasted it with the potatoes in the oven instead of microwave, also added a little onion (or shallots one time) a few cloves of garlic and a some red bell peppers all sauteed in the bacon grease before I added the potato and zucchini. BTW I added the enitire 16oz pack of bacon to balance with all the extra veggies. I think next time I'll add some mushrooms instead of zucchini!! One time I added crushed red pepper flakes, the extra kick was great for the adults! Also tastes great with salsa and/or hot sauce  as a topping!

I only made 1/2 the recipe. Think breakfast frittata...bacon and potatoes.  It was tasty. I liked the rosemary.

Excellent recipe.  It was a big hit for the family.  I made it in a cast iron skillet and sliced and froze the leftovers for breakfasts during the week.

This was an easy way to impress my aunt's at my mom's house when I last went to visit.  The uncle's were dubious as t they thought it similar to quiche, and the refrain of,"Real men don't eat quiche." rang out from them.
