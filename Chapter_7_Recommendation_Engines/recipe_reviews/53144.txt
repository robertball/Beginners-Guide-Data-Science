These were disgusting. We had already marinated some of our homegrown peppers in a vinegar based marinade and stuffed them as well.  The ones in the vinegar based marinade were much better.  The oil soaked peppers were nasty!

My family loves these peppers and when I came across the recipe, I couldn't wait to make them.  I made two large jars and then still had left over proscuitto and cheese so ran to get more peppers only to find they were sold out.  I bought Hot Banana Peppers instead and stuffed them and all of them were a huge hit!!

I love these.  I had a little trouble finding the cherry peppers but managed to get them at a big grocery store.  I would suggest purchasing at least 18 medium sized peppers and have about 2 1/2 cups of oil for this recipe or use less Prosciutto and Provolone.  I used regular olive oil instead of extra virgin olive oil because I prefer the milder taste.  When refrigerating, the oil may get cloudy but comes back to normal at room temperature.

My husband always asks for these so I usually make a couple of jars at a time.  We are originally from outside of Philadelphia where most pizza shoppes sell these.  Now we are in Alaska and they are well, non-existent.

I don't know why you would need that much oil. I just drizzled a little oil on each pepper, then I baked them. They were good!

Delicious and very spicy!  The peppers I bought may have been small, but I had a lot of prosciutto and provolone leftover.

I used hard salami and a little vinegar with the olive oil, I just like that combination.  Also, just oil appeared to be a little much.

I wish everyone would try these!!  I make them every week and keep them in the fridge to snack on whenever I want.  Much cheaper to make them yourself than to purchase the premaid poppers at the store (in the jarred pepper isle).  They go for $6 for 6 peppers.  Delicios...so glad to see a recipe out there for these popper!!!

My way is much tastier. After removing the seeds and ribs, boil the peppers cut side down in about 1/4 inch of red wine for 8-10 minutes. Stuff with prosciutto and Monterey Jack. No salt or olive oil or very little. You can dash a bit of Italian dressing on each if you would like.  Can be served warm, at room temp or cold. ENJOY!!!

these are delicious!  I made w/ hard salami instead of prosciutto-much tastier!  Also, because I made a huge jar, I rotated the jar every day so the olive oil didn't have time to solidify. Also added some vinegar to the jar for even more flavor.

These were very good.  Expensive, probably cost me around $13.00 to make (I used whole jar of peppers). For best results I find the peppers taste better at room temperature.

They were good but the problem is left overs....when you put them in the fridge, the oil solidifies and then it becomes nasty. I think adding some white vinegar will help.

Hate to do this but I thought this recipe was missing a step.  Loved the concept though. So I skipped the soaking part, placed them on a cookie sheet, drizzled them with the olive oil and sprinkled them with basil and thyme and broiled them just till cheese is melted and skin starts to brown!  Mmmm

I had a surplus of t hese cherry peppers in the yard and never grew them before and found this recipe.  Had 40 people over the house for a Sunday brunch and at the last minute (night before) we decided to use a few dozen cherry peppers and marinated them overnight. 

A few changes I made: 1st I added some herbs to the oil and I always use a TOP QUALITY EVOO (that's key as the oil becomes more of a sauce/flavor). I added marjoram, basil, thyme, etc. 

Then the next morning I took them out of the jars and placed them into casserole pan and broiled them until the cheese and tops got slightly charred..  The first guest asked me "what are these" I told him "Italian Cherry Poppers...like jalapeno popper but different pepper and stuffing" 
10 minutes later about 30 peppers were all gone!  We didn't think anyone would eat them!   But they are MUCH BETTER broiled 10 minutes ... i'm not a fan of straight out of the jar as much
