A few years ago I posted this recipe because it was just this great dish that my whole family loved and we all liked to add a lil extra of this or that... I was fond of adding more oranges and my dad liked more pineapple. I read the post where the woman had made hers a lil too runny... DO NOT make the jello... you are only using the powder packet in this recipe. For anyone who is fond of nuts pecans or walnuts chopped coarsly is very good. Hope everyones family enjoys this as much as mine.

Coming from Utah, the Jell-O capital of the world, I love this.  I am famous for this recipe in my family.  Any eating, they always request me to make my Jell-O stuff.  It's great.  I have used mixed berries from the freezer and strawberry Jell-O (my favorite) or just mandarin oranges in orange Jell-O.  This recipe is forgiving and great.  I have even quadrupled it for some functions.

This makes more than six servings.
It is very good.  I used one reg. pkg. jello and one sugar free pkg. Light cool whip. I used crushed pineapple because two year olds were eating with us. I drained it for an hour or so and also used the back of a spoon to press out extra liquid.  I made the day before and it wasn't a bit runny the next day nor the day after that.

This is good!  I subbed peaches for the oranges, because it's all I had.  I'm surprised that I liked it so much.  Just a little note, if you taste it right after it's prepared, it is gritty from the jello, so it's not a good idea, it's better after it has had time to meld.  Thanks Tiffany!

This had a really great flavor to it.  Just a personal preference of mine would be to whip the cottage cheese in a blender first, just because I find the large curds a little disconcerting in a fruit salad.  Also, try not to make more than you can eat in a day or two, because the juice from the fruits will make this fruit salad a runny mess by the end of day two.  Went over very well with my guests when first served though.  Thanks!

Yummy.  I used fat free cottage cheese, light whipped topping, and sugar free jello with the mandarin oranges and crushed pineapple.  It was very delicious and quick!  A little "soupy" but probably because I should have done a better job draining the fruit.

We tried your recipe Tiffany, it was just delicious and so easy to make. Our family has
tried different combinations for holidays,
using various fruits and nuts depending on the
celebration. Your recipe is very simple and it
allows for children to help in the cooking.
Gracias Tiffany!

Used reduced fat whipped topping and Light and Lively cottage cheese. Turned out great, with less fat and calories.

I made this twice. First time as written but Cool whip just doesn't cut it for me.  Next time used real whipping cream with strawberries.  What an improvement!

This IS EXCELLENT ANYTIME!  However, if you are watching your calorie intake like I am use low fat cottage cheese, sugar free gelatin, and use only 8 ounces of cool whip lite.  This reduces the calories by about half.  I really think it tastes better with less cool whip because the orange flavor of the gelatin is not spread so thin.

I made this for my husband's birthday party and he did not care for it and I didn't get any positive comments.  When our guests figured out it had cottage cheese they seemed a little turned off.   Like cottage cheese, this has an odd texture.  Doesn't seem like fruit salad to me, seems more like a pudding dish or something.

I don't usually like "fluff" types of salad but this recipe sounded very intriguing.  I made it for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a hit!   My father-in-law said that it was the only fluff he ever had that he liked!

EXCELLENT AS SALAD OR DESSERT.  I ALWAYS DRAIN,
(PRESSING THE PINEAPPLE TO GET RID OF JUICE).
I'VE USED THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES UNDER THE
NAME "ORANGE FLUFF".  I DECORATE WITH ROUND
PINEAPPLE SLICES AND CHERRIES ON TOP.

Yummy!!  I have been looking for this recipe ever since I first tried it about a year ago.  I tired it with dream whip and it was soupy and I also tried it with lite-cool whip, not a good idea either.  It gave it a funny taste.  Stick with regular cool whip.

I personally loved this fruit salad. It definitely does not keep for more than two days, so scale back if you are making this for a small crowd. If you use low fat cottage cheese and cool whip it brings down the fat content, making it a lighter snack to enjoy. A unique dessert that I really am a fan of!

I liked this salad. Unfortunately, no one else did! So, I was left with two big bowls of it! I would suggest to cut the pineapple chunks and the mandarin oranges in half to help make it more edible. Also, it was too tart. Not sure what to do about that, maybe less orange gelatin mix? I always make fruit salad and always get rave reviews but not this time. The ingredients just don't mix as well as other fruit salad ingredients. Too many different textures, flavors and shapes. I would definitely suggest that you try this one out for yourself before making it for a crowd.

although this is an awesome recipe, i found that the cottage cheese, whipped topping and gelatin to be used should be only 1/3 of what is being mentioned here. I was left with so much of it that I had to go out and triple the fruit to make it a fruit salad... :( this is the first time it has happened to me that i did not see this suggestion in any of the reviews.. left with a lot of it today!

Nice and easy, and not too sweet. I think next time I will add more fruit, probably something fresh instead of canned, and maybe some chopped walnuts or pecans. We liked this recipe. The kids hate cottage cheese but they ate this not knowing that it's in there.

I love it!  Cool, refreshing, & EASY, and there's nothing better than that!  Have fun trying new flavors.  I have used orange/pineapple jello with the mandarins and pineapple and red raspberry jello with pineapple tidbits and maraschino cherries.  Use light cool whip and lowfat cottage cheese for a just-as-good, yet lower fat treat.  Will make again and again and again...

This salad is so simple and makes enough for a group. I used crushed pineapple instead of pineapple chunks. So many variations in flavor, looking forward to the next time.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used low fat versions and sugar free orange gelatin mix. Make sure to drain the canned fruit thoroughly so your fruit salad has a good consistency.  Addictive treat and got lots of compliments when I hosted a group lunch.

I make this recipe all the time. I use the small curd cottage cheese, sugar free jello, and light whipped topping. I also drain the cottage cheese because the first time I made this it did come out a little runny. I just put the cottage cheese in the strainer and let it sit there for a bit. Anyway, I love this recipe and would strongly recommend it.

Thank you SO much for this recipe! I was just browsing when I stumbled upon this and knew I had to make it right away... as soon as I took the first bite I almost cried because it is the exact fruit salad my grandma always made me when I came to visit as a little girl! I'm so glad that I can pass it along now. Thank you!!! :)

Very easy and quick to make this...some ate it as a side dish, some as dessert!  Makes a huge amount...next time I'll cut recipe in half for the crew I entertain (13).  Also, this  gets very soupy by the next day.  Next time I'll add in other fruits as well.

This was nice and light.  For those who like it a little less sweet, try pineapple flavored gelatin.

I read all of the positive reviews and tried the recipe, and it turned out a soupy mess. Mostly, this recipe confused me (perhaps the source of the soupy mess part). It says to use 1 6 oz pckg of gelatin, but all the standard pkgs are .3 oz. So I used one pkg, and 6 oz of water (probably my mistake) no dice. So, I added 2 more. Still soup. Was I supposed to use one .3 oz pkg of jello but with no water? Still seems weird. Anyhow - perhaps if you can make it right, it's good. However, I did not understand the gelatin aspect and wasted a lot of fruit, cottage cheese, whipped cream, and jello.

My mom has made this for me and my brother our whole lives...it is required fare for our birthdays, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas...we eat it politely at the table and then fight like only a brother and sister can over the leftovers! Over the years we have tried to find ways to make this healthier, and have decided that no-fat cottage cheese is not a good idea, but 2% cottage cheese, low cal whipped topping and diet jello are indeed okay! Around our house, we just call it "Orange Stuff" and/or "Orange Fluff". It is amazingly delicious and simple!

I make this all the time, especially during the summer months to bring to parties and potlucks.  The only thing I do differently is to use crushed pineapple instead of the chunks.

Tried this recipe and I gotta tell ya, it's great! Used a little less cottage cheese though. I also added some Nilla Wafers on the bottom of the dish before adding the fruit salad. I don't ever have to worry about leftovers either. Thanks for the recipe!

we have been making this jello salad for years for church and family functions!  It is so yummy and easy, sounds weird with cottage cheese but if people are not willing to try it, it's their loss and more for me and those who like it!  We use pineapple tidbits or crushed pineapple instead.

Easy and delicious. I was looking for a recipe after stocking up on high quality cottage cheese on sale. I added roasted chopped pecans. My guest loved it and asked to take some home to his wife.

For an easy to prepare recipe that is quick to "whip up", this is one of the best! Not only did EVERYONE at our Thanksgiving dinner have seconds, my son, who will NOT eat cottage cheese finished off 2 helpings, even after he was informed of the "secret ingredient".

JUST A FEW NOTES.  I LEFT THE PINEAPPLES OUT ALTOGETHER.  I USED MINI MARSHMELLOWS, AND I USED A LITTLE MORE JELLO.  MAKE DOUBLY SURE YOU DRAIN ALL THE JUICE OUT OF THE ORANGES, OR WILL GET TO RUNNY.  WITH THE LEFTOVER JELLO FROM THE SECOND PACK, SPRINKLE IT OVER THE TOP JUST BEFORE YOU SERVE IT.  THIS WENT OVER SO WELL AT A DINNER I HAD, THAT I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO FIX IT EVERY TIME AFTER THAT.

This is a fast and tasty recipe.  It's more like a desert.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe.  The secound time I took the fat and calories out!  I used FF cottage cheese, FF Cool whip, and SF Jello.  It still was very good!

I loved the taste of this salad.  I used only an 8 ounce Cool Whip and it was fine.  I also think that well drained crushed pineapple instead of the chunks would make it even better.

Delicious fruit salad. I like another reviewer blend my cottage cheese in a food processor for a smooth texture and I also add marshmallows to it. I make it the night before so that the flavors blend well. I've made this to take to pot lucks and it is always a favorite.

One of my most memorable "church" salads, by which I mean that you can find this either on any church potluck table or church cookbook. This is also good with mini-marshmallows and sliced bananas. NOTE: If you don't like chunks of cottage cheese, you can run the cottage cheese through the blender/food processor to make it smooth. Or use sour cream.

It was okay: we blended the jello and cottage cheese in a blender so it was very smooth. Added many, many more fruits to it, cutting with more Cool Whip so that it was liquid enough; overall not a bad recipe but not on my list of favourites.

Being a diabetic, I use fat free cottage cheese, sugar free whipped topping, sugar free jello, and no sugar add fruit.I like to match up different flavored jello with different fruit. Just be sure to drain the fruit very well or you will have a soupy mess! This is a great treat for someone who has to watch their sugar intake!

This is just like a salad I buy from a local groecery store deli.  It is delicious.  
I have made it twice.  The second time I used strawberry banana jello, added pineapple
banana and peaches.  It was great.  I put a helping into a blender and added milk
and it made a great smoothie.  Since I had to give a kid friendly rating, I gave it a three. 
My kids didn't like it but they don't like anything.  Will definitely keep this one.

This recipe is ok. If you are thinking about substituting this recipe with other fruits like fruit cocktail - not a very good idea. It's best with pineapple and mandarine oranges

This is one of those can't live without recipes.  My mom called it "Panic Salad" because the ingredients are usually on hand and it's a snap to throw together.  It works great with substitutions!

I MAKE A VERSION OF THIS FRUIT SALAD EVERY HOLIDAY. WE CALL IT "DUMP SALAD." THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS I ADD MINIATURE MARSHMALLOWS. I'VE ALSO REPLACED THE ORANGE JELLO WITH CHERRY AND ADDED CHERRIES OR STRAWBERRY JELLO AND ADDED FROZEN STRAWBERRIES.

Very light and not too sweet.  I used lite coolwhip and fat-free cottage cheese.   The only differencewas that I had no pineapple so I used more mandarin oranges.  Will definitely make this again.

Greatly enjoyed by three boys 9yr, 8yr and 4yr old and their grandmother. By itself works as a dessert or with your choice of greens, a salad. Certainly more than six servings though and we're glad of that! A very nice taste contrast when paired with a pulled pork sandwich by KMB233

Great recipe!  Yields much more than 6 servings!  I used crushed pineapple for a more subtle texture.  The chunks are almost too big for my liking.  A hit with everyone!

This is very good.  In response to some cooks, you do not add water.  Also draining the fruit well, especially the pineapple, makes it just the right consistancy. No soupy mess.  Our family loves this.

This is some seriously yummy stuff.  I tripled the recipe for a pool party I threw over the weekend and everyone just LOVED it.  I had to give it a low Kid Friendly Rating though because not even one of the 30 kids at the party would try it (though their parents were gobbling it up!)  Next time I'm adding marshmallows and topping w/ toasted coconut.  YUM!!!!!

I'm glad to find this recipe on the site.  My Aunt Goldie used to make this every time she had a party and it was always a hit.  She used fruit cocktail and strawberry Jell-o.  I look forward to making your variation.  I made it once using lemon Jell-o and crushed pineapple.  It was very light and tasty.  A great addition to any summer meal.

I did not have orange gelatin so I made it with lime.  Brought back fond memories of years ago.  VERY easy, quick, and pretty comfort food.  Can be dished up ahead of time and kept refrigerated to pull out at meal time.

I ate the whole thing by myself! Of course it helps that I'm pregnant and crave cottage cheese, but it really is delicoious. Added mini marshmellows to it which made it even yummier.

this is delicious!!! you can substitute any fruit/gelatine combination for the oranges and orange jello...strawberry jello with sliced strawberries is awesome!!!  i prefer crushed pineapple though.  if you don't like the chunky texture of the cottage cheese buy small curd and buzz it in a blender for a few seconds before adding to the bowl.

I always tried to like cottage cheese but it always made me gag. One of the girls I work with brought this in and I forced myself to try it and it's not bad at all. I've made it twice now. I think the fruit gives it nice texture and flavor. I have always only used one box of jello. I think it's enough. Two boxes is way too much.

I enjoyed this fruit salad.  I was confused on the amount of Gelatin to add. It calls for 6 oz and I bought the .3oz boxes and added too.  The orange flavor was a bit too strong.  Will only use one box next time.

I love this stuff!!! I had been looking for a recipe so as to know how much of what to put in...I made it for Thanksgiving this year, and everyone LOVED it!! I did leave the pineapple out just because I love the oranges so much I didn't think it needed anything else. Thanks for the recipe! :)

My Grand Daughters call this pink stuff when I use a red flavored gelatin!  We also call this Yummy Stuff.  Kids eat Cottage Cheese and don't even know it.  Be sure to use well drained Crushed Pineapple.

I thought this was really good.  About the only thing that I changed was that I used a 28oz can of mandarin oranges and just ate a few out of the can!  I think you could almost get by with 8-10oz of the whipcream.  In addition, I think chopped nuts would be good in this also.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out using cottage cheese, but what a surprise! Simple and quick with a nice flavor. I only used one box of the orange jello. Make sure to drain the fruit well before adding. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I love this recipe....the only thing I change, is keep out a few slices of orange to decorate the top with and slice a few marichino cherries in half to add to the top as well.

The flavor is great (only 1 pack of jello) but I can't get over the cottage cheese texture.  I love cottage cheese I just don't know that it has a place in fruit salad.  I am reluctant to serve this to our guests but since it made so much I will.  I think if the cottage cheese was replaced with a whipped cream cheese it may taste amazing.

Delicious, sweet creamy and refreshing. I used lowfat cottage cheese, sugarfree jello and sugarfree cool whip, and even the sugar junkies enjoyed the salad. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this for a healthier dessert after dinner.  It looked pretty gross, not a lot of people ate it.  I had it and didn't think it was BAD but I won't be making it again.  I'd rather make a fruit-jello mold.

This did not go over well at a picnic that I went to but I thought it was yummy and so did my mother-in-law. I did add colored mini marshmellows and lime zest. It was quick and easy and I will love eating the leftovers.

I, personally, enjoyed this recipe, but all four of my kids found the taste and texture of the cottage cheese off-putting. Perhaps if it was pureed beforehand, it would help. This salad wasn't a hit with my family, unfortunately, so I likely won't be making it again.

My husband was looking to relive a childhood memory of a salad with cottage cheese and orange jello, which led me to this recipe.  Maybe I was a little heavy handed with the Cool Whip.  There wasn't enough fruit in this for my liking.  I ended up adding another pack of Jello, a large can of oranges and a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple.  The end product still wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be, but the family seemed to enjoy the flavor and though it made a huge bowl of salad, it was all gone by the end of Thanksgiving dinner.  Maybe next time I'll cut way back on the Cool Whip.

I was a little skeptical because of the cottage cheese, but this is really yummy!  Even my daughter who dislikes cottage cheese says it's good.  This is super easy, too!  We will make it again and again.

It's too sweet and I have a major sweet tooth. I think I would only put in 3 oz of gelatin instead of 6 oz

Reading other comments I was worried it would taste gritty but that was not the case. I used extra oranges and pineapple and also added 2 cut up firm bananas, 1/2 cup copped pecans and about 1 cup shredded coconut. It still seemed a little wet but after it sat in the fridge about an hour or two it was perfect. It does make a huge amount. And I used 3/4 of the tub of cottage cheese (lowfat) and  only 8 oz of whipped cream (lite). Yummy!

This was really good! I added a few things extra I had on hand like mini marshmallows and an extra can of fruit.
