Really yummy. Couldn't find miso so I did without it. I probably used more soy sauce and I added a dash of chipotle chili powder for just a tiny bit of bit

Unless you really love peanut butter (and I mean like my puppy!) and really DON'T like the taste of green beans, you will probably not like this as is.  You might as well just get out a jar of peanut butter and shove the green beans in it.  It overwhelmed any other ingredients.  I added more soy sauce, I added more miso paste, I then tries resorting to tons of fresh grated ginger, then cayenne, but I did not care for this recipe.  Maybe it's just me but....

Unbalanced recipe that I don't think can be fixed. Find a really good peanut sauce recipe and use that instead. This recipe is nothing but sweetened peanut butter on bland green beans. 

Skip it.
