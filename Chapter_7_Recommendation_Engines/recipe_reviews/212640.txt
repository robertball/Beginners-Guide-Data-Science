This recipe is so decadent. Please be sure to use the ingredients listed. Wild Mushroom Ragout NEEDS wild mushrooms to bring the intense flavors together, not plain button mushrooms. They are too mild. Also the fresh herbs make this recipe come together so be sure they are FRESH not dried. This is an elegant main course to serve your special guests. Enjoy!

This definitely wasn't as good as expected. I thought that all the ingredients were really good but they didn't come together. I made it exactly as indicated except I used dried herbs (1/3 of the fresh amount) and only white button mushrooms. It was far too vinegary and lacked any other flavor. If I ever made this again, I would cut down on the vinegar or leave it out. Maybe add some beef bouillon. Or just use a pack of knorr with less water and some mushrooms :)
