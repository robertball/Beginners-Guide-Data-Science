This is a great recipes to make ahead of time and freeze. My husband's favorite to throw in his lunch and heat up at work. This is definitely popular in Germany when I had visited. Germans selling these in stands along with giant pretzels and bakery goods at markets. I learned how to make these a while back ago but very rarely find recipes online. They are very delicious. Easy to make. And my girls love it.

I make this often. Sometimes as written but other times I use refrigerated biscuits like those from Pilsbury. Just roll them out so you have about a 5" circle. Works great. Other variations are to add some cheddar or mozarella. Kids like the cheese versions best. Can't imagine why.

I could not give it a 5 because I didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't have cabbage so i steamed up a bunch of brussel sprouts and chopped them up added 1 tbsp unsalted butter to them two medium grated carrots 1 small bag of frozen corn. ( I wanted peas but I was out.) I mixed together 1 lb of ground chorizo 1 lb ground turkey 1 lb ground beef and cooked the mix slowly with no added oils or butter or anything in a large cast iron skillet while I attended to the prep of the vegies. when the meat was almost done I added two tsp of fresh ground black pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper and four tbsp of dried minced onion and worked it into the meat. After the meat was done cooking I drained it in a colander then added it to the corned beef hash (I picked up a can of this on purpose for t his dish) waiting in a mixing bowl where I mixed them all thoroughly. no need to add salt to this dish.. Vegie mix tossed in and mixed in as thoroughly as possible. 1 can of grands buttermilk biscuits I manually spread out each one at a time as far as I could without rendering them useless then spread a couple small slices of gouda tbsp shredded medium cheddar tbsp shredded mozzarella then two tbsp of the filling on top of that pressed down firmly to encourage it to stay then a tsp of alfredo sauce over that then I folded the biscuit down and pulled the lower part up and overlapped in the middle. the sides I pulled up and pressed to the top of the package....
