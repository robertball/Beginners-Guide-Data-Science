Because I have a small rice cooker, I halved the recipe. The salt amount seemed like WAY too much, and after reading the other review stating it was salty, I chose to only use one third the amount of salt (so for a half batch, I used 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp). Am I ever glad I cut back! The seasonings were perfect, so I can't even imagine how salty it would be with the full amount. With the reduced salt, I really liked the overall flavor. It was a nice change of pace. The rice did come out a little mushy (even though I rinsed it first), so it would be a good idea to use a bit less liquid than called for.

This recipe is good and super easy to make. You could also add in some gandules (pigeon peas, drained/rinsed) and cooked cubed or diced ham to the rice cooker. However, please take some notes before proceeding to make this recipe as it really needs to be updated because it doesn’t even match the author’s original recipe. 1.41 oz of Sazon is the equivalent of 2 boxes. It should read 2 packets sazon, NOT  2 (1.41 ounce) package sazon. Also, when using sazon packets, there’s really no need to add the additional salt. Since the recipe has you use chicken stock, I would omit the bouillon all together. Here’s what I did after scaling recipe in half (5 servings): used 1.5 cups rice (jasmine is what I had), 1 ¾ cups chicken stock, 2 tbsp. tomato sauce, 1 tbsp olive oil, ½ tsp salt, 2.5 tsp homemade sazon (you would want to use 1 packet Sazon if you have it), and 1.5 tsp garlic powder. Omitted the bouillon. This was very good this way. Yes, lots of alterations were made here, but they were all very necessary. Otherwise, the recipe will come out extremely salty. If this recipe is ever updated, I’ll try again as written and likely increase my rating.

We followed the recipe and it was salty! Perhaps 1-2 teaspoons are enough. Thanks!

I went with 1tsp of salt as others suggest which was a good suggestion. But in the recipe it says 2 (1.41oz) packages of sazon. Which is 2 whole boxes of 8 packets each. 

I figured this was way too much and it was. The rice comes out orange like the photo and not yellow. It's not bad, but could be much better. Next time i'll just use a few of the little packets inside the box which are 1 gram each. 

The flavor in arroz amarillo should be more subtle. But the rice did come out of my cooker the perfect consistency, not mushy at all.

Used fresh garlic and diced up some red bell pepper. Really tasted great. Will be making again for sure.

Five star flavor, but too much salt!  I only used one tablespoon of salt and it was still a little too salty.  I'll definitely be making it again and will probably decrease to 1 teaspoon and see whether that's enough.  I used two packets of Sazon Goya.

I made this based on the reviews and it came out so delicious. I cut everything in half because i wanted to just try it first. 2 cups chicken broth, 1.5 cups rice(I used basmati), 1.5 tablespoons tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 2 sazon packets not a box and 1/2 of a bouillon cube crushed. Took about 20 minutes in the rice cooker and came out awesome!!! For real!
