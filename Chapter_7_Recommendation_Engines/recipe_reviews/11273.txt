This recipe has too little flour for the amount of butter it calls for.  I would recommend adding one more cup of flour, then the cookies wouldn't spread so much during baking.  Good luck.

This was the worst recipe that I have ever tried.  They came out looking like pancakes.  I have tried the recipe twice and both times the same thing happened.  I wasted my time and my money.  It was just a very bad recipe.

The cookie did not hold its shape like normal thurmprint cookes..it spread out and was flat as a pancake.  I loved the idea of doing caramel and the hershey kiss but I wll try it on another cookie base because this one did not work no matter how long I refrigerated the dough

I would definitely make this again but I put two cups of flour instead of one and a whole cup of brown sugar. This made the recipe a lot better.

The batter was runny, like others have said.  But I tell ya, try thumbprint cookies with a swirl of chocolate frosting instead of a kiss.  Fabulous!!!  Try it!

I wish I would have read the other reviews first.  They tasted allright but they were completely flat like pancakes.
