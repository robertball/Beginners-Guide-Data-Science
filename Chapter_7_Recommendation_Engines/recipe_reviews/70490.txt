This was really excellent!!  I highly recommend NOT using flour tortillas.. unless you like the "gooey" taste at the end results.  The corn tortillas were firm and full of corn flavor!  Also, people should not rate a recipe BEFORE they cook and try it.  I added a bit more comino.  Next time, I'll add some minced bell pepper.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I changed it a bit to make it more healthy. I replace one can of soup with boiled cauliflower & carrot (about half a large cauliflower and a few small carrots) that I then puree in a blender, along with milk and the other can of soup. My children don't even notice that the extra vegies are in there. 
I also tend to boil my chicken and then shred it. I just find that it's quicker that way. 
This recipe tastes great with a side of rice.

Great dish, I used chicken tenders instead of bone in chicken and shredded them and it turned out very good. Highly reccommend this dish!

This recipe was awesome!!  The only change I made was I used "chili beans", instead of the chili with no beans and it came out so good.   Also the chicken breasts I used were huge so I was actually able to make 2-9x13 dishes (one layer each).  This is so good, I'm thinking of making a big tray of this for an upcoming family get together!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Loved, loved, loved this! I used boneless, chicken breasts sprinkled w/taco seasoning & baked in a pan w/salsa & water. After shredding it, I sprinkled w/more taco seasoning. I also threw the chicken in w/the soup mixture & layered chicken/soup mix, corn tortillas(chopped), cheeses, repeat. I had 2 cans of chili beans(also called mexican bean mix or chili mix in some stores) which I used in place of the chili w/out beans. It was incredibly good! It would be fantastic in tortillas, enchilada style but we just ate it straight & some scooped it w/tortilla chips. I'll definately be making this again! Thank you!

This is very good. My husband loved it. I did not use the cream of mushroom and we still enjoyed it. I also halved the ingrediants- and it worked perfectly in an 8x8 dish.

My 7 & 9 yr old kids liked this. I upped the cumin to 1 tsp and used half an onion due to personal tastes. Thanks for the recipe; it was great even though I left off a layer of tortillas!

My family loves this, and we call it "Chicken SOMEORA" (as in, they always ask for some more!).  Thanks so much for this delicious, easy recipe.

This was excellent!! My family loved it including my picky husband.  It's cheesy, creamy, and full of flavor! I recommend using 3lbs of chicken breast because it makes alot of sauce. Will leave you with lots of yummy leftovers too.  I just seasoned boneless breasts with southwest seasoning and salt and pepper, then cooked them in a pan with olive oil.

Quick and easy.  I would make a layer of corn tortillas on the bottom before the chicken also.

Excellent recipe.  I used 6 boneless chicken breasts and shredded them instead.  I also upped the cumin and garlic powder to 1 tsp.  Next time I will also season the chicken and add some sauce to the bottom layer.

I thought this was pretty good.  The kids just stared at it wouldn't even try it.  Fortunatly for me that meant leftovers for lunch.  Followed recipe as stated.

This chicken was excellent.  The prep time took more like an hour though.  I only changed a few things.  Instead of baking the chicken I grilled it up on the stove, while I was grilling it I kept cutting the ckicken up until it was thouroughly cooked and shredded.  The other thing I changed was I used vegetarian chili, which had beans in it.  I did it for the main reason of that I can't stand any kind of canned meat, I also figured a little beans would make it extra good.  My family loved it.  It also made for a lot of leftovers.

This was good.  I have made it twice now.  The first time I used pre-cooked rotisserie chickens from the grocery store and I made one and a half batches.  One batch was a 9x13 pan and the other an 8x8.  There was enough sauce for both, but it did take about 3 full chickens for enough meat, although I was fairly generous.  The second time I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  It's pretty versatile and I will try ground beef next.  Both times I used a little extra milk so the sauce wasn't so thick.

Loved it!  It's not that much to look at but, boy oh boy it tastes great!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used fresh garlic rather than the powder and, salsa instead of the picante sauce, because the only picante sauce I could find was "hot" and I knew we wouldn't like that.  Oh!  Also I boiled the chicken instead of baking it.  I will surely make this again!

VERY GOOD!! I changed a few things... left out the can of chilli and mixed black beans and olives with the chickn layer.  I also used three boneless skinless chicken breasts that I cooked by boiling instead of baking (deffinitely faster!). It filled my 9x13 glass pan to almost overflowing! I might try two next time, or halving the recipe. It was a BIG hit in our house though and I will be making it again soon!

I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked them in a skillet rather than in the oven.  Also omitted the Monterey and can of cream of mushroom soup.  My chili had beans, which I thought added to the casserole.  I used more cumin, garlic, and chili powder, too.  Other than the alterations, I thought the recipe had great flavor and was simple to put together.  Good recipe for the weekdays!

This recipe is awesome! My husband and daughter loved it. I put mild picante sauce in it but next time I will put medium just to spice it up. A quick and easy meal that is delicious!

First of all you have to be a chicken lover to eat all that chicken in one dish! We like our chicken but we used four boneless skinless chicken breasts and even that was too much. The tortilla directions were very vague and we didn't know how many to use. We ended up using too many and they were all still dry. There wasn't enough sauce because it soaked into the chicken and that didn't leave much for the tortillas. I will make this again, but I will use quite a few alterations and substitutes.

I did everything as the recipe called ... except I used a rotisserie chicken and I added a little bit more garlic powder, cumin and decided to add a 1/2 teaspoon or a bit more chili power.  I love this casserole!  Easy and good.

Delish and my 9 year old son is still eating it! I only substitute mushroom soup for sour cream because of alergies and mozarella and Mexican cheese since I didn't have the cheese at hand. I made a full salad as a side dish.

took the advice of the reviewer who suggested using corn tortillas.  The hubs loved it and the kid had seconds too so it's a winner.

I have made this a few times, I make it with a side of rice and replace the no beans chilli with a jar of sloppy Joe sauce. It's really good, also you only really need one package of cheese and I use 3-4 boneless breasts. I plan to try it with ground porc this weekend. Highly recommend this for an easy meal!!

This recipe was so good! I gave it 4 stars because I had to make a few changes because I didn't have some of the items. I used boneless chicken breast and sprinkled garlic powder while cooking in the oven for about 35 minutes. Perfect!
I didn't have the picante sauce, so I used 3/4 cup of Herdez Salsa Verde and about 1/2 cup of petite diced tomatoes. I also used pepperjack cheese in place of the jack cheese. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was awesome! My family said this is a keeper!!

My in-laws have been making this for years and it's a crowd pleaser. We use flour tortillas cut into 1" strips and mild green chili instead of picante sauce. I tastes like a yummy burrito. It's easy to double or triple to feed a large group. With salad and chips and salsa you can't beat it.

Oh my!!  This was really good. Of course, I love casserolish type things. It is a little more work than my normal tacos or spaghetti but it is worth it. It makes a lot and you can definitely have company over with this recipe. I forgot the milk in the recipe but it seemed to be fine without it. My daughter who is 6 did not like it but that is pretty normal. I will give it 4 stars only because it is not a whole family favorite.

SALTY!! next time I will use low sodium soups and sub garlic salt for garlic powder. My family liked the taste and did not mind the salty factor, I will make this again with the changes...easy, easy, easy.

Delicious!  This tastes like a chicken enchilada.  My family loved it and I will make it again.  It makes at least 8 servings, so next time I will cook half and freeze half for our family of 4.  I used corn tortillas, Pace medium picante, and Hormell chili no beans.  I also boiled the chicken which worked fine.
