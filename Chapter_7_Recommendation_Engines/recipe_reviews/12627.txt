Delicious!  I didn't even bother with a crust at all - I just made the filling and dumped it into a 9" square baking pan. It was much lower in fat, calories and carbs that way, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it a lot. I had a large pumpkin already, so wasn't sure how much to use in the recipe. I ended up using about 1 pound of cooked pumpkin, and about 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes - it was just right for the 9" pan. The thyme really gave the dish a great flavor, and it was nice to have a non-sweet use for pumpkin!

My son wanted to take this in his lunch the next day!
I thought the crust was very boring for this - next time I would use a cheddar, spinach or nut crust.

Unlike some previous reviewers, I like the taste an oven baked crust gives to a pie like this.  I used a ready made crust, which was fine, but wouldn't mind substituting a jazzier one.
The flavor was great, you could taste everything individually and together.  It isn't much for the eye (hence the 4 stars), so I will probably add something with a splash of green next time.  Also, for vegetarians, the protein levels aren't wonderfully high, so some tofu marinated in a tofurkey seasoning mixture might be a good add, or perhaps some shelled edamame?  I will continue to play with this, it's worth it.  Thanks Jen!

I followed other reviews and omitted the crust. Also, used 1 cup pureed pumpkin, 1/2 pound of sausage, and one sweeet onion. We really liked this dish, will make it again!

This has become a family favorite!  I use a refrigerated crust. There's enough filling for 2 regular 9" pie pans.  We eat one and freeze the other. This is a great fall or winter side dish.

we loved this recipe!  i used a really small pumpkin, plus about 1/2 of a small butternut squash, and i used small red, white and purple potatoes, so it was really colorful.  and VERY tasty.  will definitely make again.

I made this last night and it was a hit with the whole family.  DELICIOUS!  I substitued a spinach crust, but next time will not bother with a crust at all.  It really doesn't need one.  I substituted soy cheddar for the monterey jack and added about 3/4 cup of organic beef stock to the mixture before baking, as it seemed a little dry.

I am not going to bother with a crust next time because it shrunk so much and didn't really add anything to the taste.  The flavors of the potatoes and herbs were wonderful though.

Loved it!  My husband who hates pumpkin, never suspected a thing.  In fact, he thought that it was so hearty that there had to be meat in it.  I used a ready made pie crust instead.  It was a tad dry, but made up for it in taste.  Great for vegetarians too.

Brought this to a potluck and people thought it was fine.  I made it without crust as one reviewer suggested, but I definitely think it needs a crust. Otherwise, it doesn't look presentable. I had to substitute parsley for thyme.

Made the filling exactly as submitted but omitted the crust -- thought I'd do a trial run. My family gives it 5 thumbs up! This will become a dish I take to Thanksgiving dinner this year. One question: there is one family member that isn't too fond of thyme. Could anyone suggest an alternative herb to use that would similarly enhance all the flavours?

Since I used dried thyme, I reduced the amount, but still found this very heavy on thyme.  Also, I didn't care for the corn with the squash & potatoes. There are several other butternut squash recipes I prefer over this, so it's unlikely we'll make it again (with or without the crust).

I give 4 stars, only because I did alter it a bit. I added pork sausage to it, and everyone LOVED it.

I thought this was good, however I think it could have used a little more "kick".  I am thinking about making it as a Thanksgiving side dish perhaps with some chili powder, red pepper flakes, or something of that nature.  Or maybe some ground turkey or sausage would be good.  I did not make the crust, but I thought it would make a better side dish than a pie.

This was extremely tasty! I doubled the garlic, hubby said even more would have been better, and added a bit more salt and some diced chicken to make it an entree. I also cooked the veggies in butter to give them more flavor. I used the No Roll Pie Crust II from this site, made with whole wheat flour, super yummy combo!

This recipe came out perfectly for me. I did peel my potatoes after they baked. The flavor was somewhat like Northern Michigan's famous pasties and so next time I might try adding some turnip or a little parsnip to the mix.  Thanks! Update: Just a couple weeks later and I'm all set to make this dish again. It was that good. I found some organic, whole wheat pie crusts in the frozen section of our grocery and will try those. We do enjoy the pie crust in this recipe. Fantabulous! Oh yeah, I've also agreed to make this for three friends. No matter, this dish is THAT easy to prepare.

My tastebuds are singing!!!  My family loved this!!!  I made the following changes:  I peeled my-baked-potatoes (I didn't notice in the recipe where it mentioned to peel or not to peel)and then added some canned yams, which I drained and cubed (I'd use baked sweet potatoes next time, but I didn't have any).  Also I stirred in some some evaporated milk (about 2/3 of the can) and grated parmesean cheese and let that all cook down a bit.  I took some buttery club crackers and mixed them with real melted butter and made a 9 x 13 crust.  Top with potato/pumpkin filling, sprinkle with more parmesean, baake at 350 until crust is done, and YUMMY!!!  The perfect fall food!

Delicious!   I didn't use a pie crust either but I think it would be good that way, too.  I have some delicious salsa that's mostly sweet peppers and I added maybe half a cup of that for a little extra zing.  Next time I might add some fennel instead.  Very good on these cool fall nights!

I didn't have pumpkin on hand so used a butternut squash instead, the flavour was fantastic but next time would peel and cube the squash instead of roasting it in the skin.  Also I'd add a couple of sweet potato's.  I didn't add the cheese and found it made a fantastic side dish, the kids ate it up so no complaints there!

I made this pie using a polenta crust to cut down a little on the fat and calories.  I think the flavors went well together.  The pie filling is pretty easy to make. I added some chicken broth to the filling because it was a little dry. It seemed like it could use another flavor to counteract the sweetness of the corn and pumpkin.  Maybe sour cream? green chilies?  I'm not sure.  I agree that even reducing the dried thyme to 1tsp is still too much thyme.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but no one in my family thought it was a "make again" dish.  I did make it without the crust, but based on the other reviews, I don't think that could have been the problem.  Feels like it needs something...maybe a splash of cream or more spices?

I used a homemade crust, but not the one from the recipe.  Mine was made with vegetable shortening.  It turned out perfectly.  Also, I used dried herbs and mozzarella cheese.  I loved it, my husband thought it needed something.  I think next time I will add more vegetables - maybe peppers and carrots?

So good! I did as one of the reviews suggested, and did not use a crust, just did it in a casserole dish. I also replaced the corn with red, yellow, and orange bell peppers which I sautéed along with the garlic and onions in olive oil before mixing with the pumpkin and potatoes. This was delicious, not difficult, could definitely be easily tweaked to match individual flavors as preferred.

Not much exciting flavor, just veggies with allspice. And I don't think the cheese adds anything flavor-wise, just extra calories. I made without crust. I wouldn't bother making this again.

nice, but a little bland.  It needed something. One of my daughters gave it a 9 and the other a 7, so I'll give it 4 stars. For me it was only worth three, but I have to appreciate something that is a hit with my family.
