The added orange flavor in this recipe is especially nice for those who don't like gingerbread in particular.  A really fast and good recipe.  Does not make too many gingerbread men, so there are not the left overs.

Just didn't really like the taste of these cookies compared to a Betty Crocker recipe I used.

I liked the orange flavoring.  I substituted honey for the molasses.  My kids had fun cutting out shapes.  They are good firm cookies but i would call mine honey orange cookies instead of orange gingerbread.  Quick and easy to make (okay, except for the chill time).
