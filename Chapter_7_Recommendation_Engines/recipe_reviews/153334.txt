These were okay.  I probably won't make them again.  They had more of cake like texture and I was really hoping for brownies.  Also, since I was making these to take to work and not a lot of people don't like nuts.  I didn't mix the nuts into the batter but instead only sprinkled the nuts on half of the batter once it was in the pan.  That way the people who like nuts can have nuts and the ones who don't were still able to share in the enjoyment without the nuts.

These taste the way a perfect brownie should, in my opinion!  Fudgy, not too sweet, and delicious!  I followed the recipe, BUT-I couldn't throw away perfectly good egg yolk, and knew I wouldn't use it for something else, so I just used the whole egg, and only medium sized, not large. Since I used the whole egg I only used half the number it called for.  I like the addition of pecans, it's a good combination of flavors.  I halved the serving size, only making half a batch in an 8x8 pan.  I will make these again and again!

These were really good.  I was disappointed that they were not fudgy like the picture shows but I think that was my fault.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I will make these again since they are healthier then regular brownies and because they are tasty.
