Simple but kind of bland.

Good stuff!  Made a few changes:  Cut the chicken into chunks and added the onion to the chicken as it browned; carmelinzing the onions added good flavor.  Used canned spinach and a chicken boullion cube.  Left the chicken in the pan and added enough water to mix in and cook some instant rice with it.  Easy as could be and tasty too.  We added some sour cream to our plates to provide a little extra creaminess.

A "safe" recipe. Won't offend anyone but won't excite anyone either. Although I followed the recipe exactly, the spinach was evaporating faster than the liquid. Should I make this again, I would cut the liquids by at least half.

I am following a Weight Watchers plan and this recipe is only 3 points per serv. I found it to be delicious and easy. Next time I would double the spinach and cook the chicken a little longer. Excellent!!
