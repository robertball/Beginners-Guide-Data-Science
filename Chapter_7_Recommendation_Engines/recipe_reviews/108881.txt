I'll admit, were not beet lovers here, but my friend had extra beets from their garden and was over for dinner tonight so we used this recipe.  They just loved it, though I didn't try it cause I hate beets they just loved it so I printed out the recipe for them.

Very good! Sweet beets and the sugar/vinegar/cinnamon really helped to diminish the earthy beet taste. Also, the vinegar isn't that strong once this is ready to eat. I used fresh beets from my garden, just boiled 'em for an hour or so until they were tender.

after unsuccessfully scouring my kitchen for my grandmother's recipe for pickled beets, I decided to come to allrecipes... and again, wasn't disappointed. This is as close to grandma's as I've seen. The only change was that she always tossed in a few cloves... probably 1/2t or so. I just heard my kids in the basement, "do you smell that? She's cooking beets again." so I must be doing SOMETHING right. :) Who cares if I'm the only one in the house who loves these? Thanks a bunch, TasteKing!

I am right this moment enjoying my pickled beets. I did feel like the beets themselves got lost in the cinnamon-ness, though, so when I make this again (which I will definitely do) I'll probably cut that down. I used fresh beets, which I boiled in their skins until soft, then peeled and sliced, using the cooking liquid as my base. I also added onions to the brine. Thanks!

These were really great!  We liked the spices and accidentally used some rutabegas (I think I spelled that wrong) because we thought they were beets too but it was all good!

I reduced the sugar and cooked a sweet onion to include in this recipe. Turned out well. I might decrease the vinegar  bit the next time I make this recipe.

OK, this is the first time I have ever made pickled beets. My mother used to make her own all the time and my husband always loved them. As I am not a beet fan, I decided to try making them. These taste just like my motherâ€™s, and my husband was ecstatic about this recipe thank you for this once again memory making recipe.

I made these last night to serve. Followed the recipe exactly and they are delicious. I will definitely be making these again but I think I will add a little onion next time.
