10.24.18  I gave up on thinly slicing the cauliflower, as it was just crumbling, looking like cauliflower rice.  Instead, I just cut it into small, bite-size florets which worked fine.  Didnâ€™t really measure the veggies, just eyeballed it, but I made the dressing as written using olive oil instead of canola.  I used a combination of Kalamata and green olives with pimento which brought a little brininess to the salad, and also added the optional onions, but skipped the optional green peppers.  This is a nice change for a side salad with a mild flavor.  Thanks for sharing.
