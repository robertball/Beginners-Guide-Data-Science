I made  this tonight and it is absolutely delicious! I love all of Capt. Walker's recipes. He is a talented cook and picks up most of his ideas from foods he has eaten  as he has sailed the world!

Absolutely fantastic! I ended up using a huge pan and just lining it then doing a layer of potatoes, then a layer of bacon and sausage, then top with more potatoes. I baked at 350 then placed under broiler for crispy top and bottom (use loads of butter or olive oil). Then I topped it with a swiss cheese fondue. Freaking A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Kids were all over it. Fed 10 people with a batch like this!

I modified this.  :(.  I know!! But it was still SO GOOD. I used a bag of frozen hash browns and I should have only used 1/2. I didn't add the mushrooms (the boys don't like) and I added the cheese to the middle of the potatoes and layered the remaining on top.  My pan was way too big to
Flip and fry so I had to place it in the oven as is. It was DELISH. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN.
