This is GREAT - it WORKED, was easy (although it takes hours) and was yummy.

Thanks very much Patsy. 

The outside of the loaf was all crunchy and the inside soft. By the second day the bread is not so fresh and crunchy but can be easily cut very thin and makes wonderful crispy toast.

I am allergic to wheat and baking powder and this is the about the tenth recipe that I have tried and the first and only one so far that has worked - I am new to baking !

By the way my second attempt was even better than the first and rose more. I found that it was important to follow the temp guidelines and managed to keep the constant temp during rising by putting the bowl with the dough in an esky (Australian for cooler or picnic or insulated box) with a cup of boling water and thermometer. Temprature and humidity was constant.

I am looking for more baking recipes to play with that do not use wheat or baking powder.

Very flavorful chewy bread.  I used honey instead of white sugar which could account for why it didn't rise the second time as well as I would have liked, but it still came out very good.

The loaves turned out perfect.  Crispy crust with soft inner core.  Great the next day for sandwiches or toast.  I subed White spelt, brown sugar, and organic unfiltered apple juice to add a little more flavor.

This is a great recipe I will be making it weekly.  For me the rise time was a little long but that varies with type of yeast, and room temperature. Not only is this bread much cheaper then the store bought spelt but it hold ups much better in a sandwich. This recipe was easy to make (spelt is known to be fussy) I did substitute agave nectar for the sugar to lower the glycemic index since it is being made for a diabetic. One warning I do have for people with allergies is that spelt is a type of wheat better tolerated the most.

This is the first spelt bread recipe I tried, and it is absolutely delicious! I just cut one loaf open to taste and cannot stop eating from it, it's that good. I made it exactly as the recipe is written, except I used 1 tablespoon honey instead of the sugar, as my daughter cannot have white sugar.

Absolutely LOVED the taste of it.  Baking it reminded me of when I was a kid smelling fresh bread coming from the kitchen.

Wow, this is THE best spelt bread recipe I have tried to date! Chewy outer crust and nice texture inside. Like some other reviewers I used honey instead of sugar. I like the flavor better. I also used half light and half dark spelt flour. The bread will be less dense or heavy. Also I only ended using about 6 cups of flour. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for posting it.
