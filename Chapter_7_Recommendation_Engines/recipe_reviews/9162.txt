This was excellent!! The last time I had creamed onions, they were frozen! This was way better and much tastier. 
 
Here is what I did:  Bring the water to a boil, and drop your onions in,  skins and all, let them boil for 1-2 min., drain them. Then, you cut them,  by doing it this way, it is much easier.  
Far as the white sauce goes, equal amounts of butter and flour, combine the milk with the cooking water. I did it a cup at a time. 1 C. of cooking water mixed with 1 C. of milk, pour that in gradually. 
The spices I used were salt and pepper to taste, and Paprika. 
On any spice, you can always add more of it at the end, so go sparingly while in the pan. Paprika is a great spice, a nice hint of color, and a great taste too. 
My husband and I loved this dish, he's never had them before and he enjoyed this. 
Will definitely be making this again. Thanks Ibby! Really enjoyed it.

Big fan of the creamed onions. Another
suggestion(what I do)is add sharp chedder cheese to the sauce while it is thickening the after I pour the sauce over the onions I top it with a Ritz Cracker and butter topping, and bake for about 35min. This is a lot richer than your recipe,so some people may not like it.

Way too much watery sauce for the amount of onions called for. I'd use half the amount of liquid and maybe some dehydrated onion bits to give the sauce some flavor in addition to the salt and pepper to taste.

Don't save the cooking water. It's not necessary, and just makes for a really runny dish. A tip: Pearl onions are easier to peel if boiled whole with skins on. When done, just pop them out. They will be nice and creamy, and not a pain to peel that way. Use cream in this recipe instead of milk. I'd add a dash of some kind of hot sauce or cayenne to give this dish some pop.

Here's a variation that was passed down through my husband's family. Use 1 lb of boiling onions instead of the pearl onions. I blanch for 3 minutes and then cut off the root so the outside peels off easily. I then boil the onions until tender in lightly salted water. I make the Wondra White sauce and add a little mild cheddar and dry mustard. Put the onions in a casserole dish, pour the sauce on top and sprinkle a light layer of bread crumbs. I'll do this part in advance and then bake uncovered until heated throughout.

I used fresh onions & snow peas from the garden to make this recipe and it was wonderful. I did not use all the liquid however. 7 cups milk & cooking water just seemed like too much, but maybe it would be okay.

This is ok if you completely leave out the onion water, or boil it down to a few cups or so. However, those who are searching for a satisfying version of what they remember from several holidays ago will not find what they are looking for here. Try 1 Tbsp each of butter and flour, and use 1 cup of half and half, or (maybe) cut the half and half with whole milk, but low or nonfat milk just won't do. And add just a touch of nutmeg. It's the secret ingredient... Hey.. since when can a dish like "creamed" onions be made low fat? ;^}

I liked it but I thought it may need a little more flavor... I was thinking maybe add cream instead of milk and add some chives! Other then that it was still good.

I have been making creamed onions for years.  Got the recipe from my ex's great aunt, her Swedish recipe.  Use milk and half and half.  I use a stick of butter and 8 tblsp. of flour.  Heat it together to form a nice, caramel color rue.  Add the milk/half and half mixture slowly into the rue whisking constantly.  I add a few tblsp. of finely grated parmesan cheese and salt and pepper only.  Makes two 10" pie plates of these wonderful onions!!

This recipe calls for way too much liquid and not nearly enough onions for the amount of sauce.  3 cups liquid TOTAL is all you need.

I've tried to make these twice, and both times the sauce has come out extremely thin and soupy.  If there's something I'm doing wrong, please let me know.

Very little taste to me.  Tasted like milk with onions dropped in it.  YUK!  I might try it again tho, but with a LOT LESS milk...just enough to give it some body, and I may use cream instead of milk, and add chives or something else.  All in all....didn't like it.

The proportions are wrong on this recipe. I had to throw out the sauce and replace it with another recipe I found elsewhere.  The other recipe with the same ingreds made a creamy sauce.  12 oz pearl onions, and 2 cups of water used to boil onions only.  The creamy sauce was made with 3 T butter, 3 T flour and 2 C. milk, slowly adding the milk, salt  & pepper to taste.  Much better!

Rating is for my recipe, not the one above.  I use a tablespoon of non GMO Corn Starch instead of flour. 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of the onion water after the onions boiled. 2 tablespoons of butter. Salt and pepper.  I make the cream sauce and then pour it over my cooked pearl onions.

I haven't tried this yet, but first reviewer said sauce too thin.  Seens like a lot of liquid for the flour.  Try just 1 cup of cooking liquid, that's what I'm going to do.  Sounds delicious!

This recipe has way too much liquid. It would be fine with 3 cups of liquid. The ratio for a  classic white sauce is 2 T Butter / 2 T Flour to 1 cup liquid.  Also, 8 oz of onion is not enough onion for this much sauce.

My mother in law is coming for Thanksgiving dinner for the first time in 18 years.  She asked to have creamed onions and I exected a winner with this recipe.  I am not a creamed onion fan. I saved 4 cups of water + the 3 cups of milk = 7 cups of liquid!!  I melted the butter and used 6 tablespoons of flour.  Once I added the liquid slowly I found myself stirring for over 25 minutes while adding much more flour.  It finally started to thicken after 30 minutes.  I addded over 1 cup of onions (about 30) and they are swimming in the sauce.  My husband says it is good but I am going to run to the store and buy more onions to make it look better.   I also have about 3-4 cups of sauce left.  The water/milk should have been 1/2C and 1C respectively.  I sure hope my inlaws like this!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it's just somewhat bland.  I added a bit of garlic powder, but still kind of boring.  Another reviewer suggested using a bit of chedder and topping with crushed buttery crackers, then baking, and I will probably try that with the ample leftovers I have.

...after I fixed it. Use TWO cups onions. Leave out the cooking water and just slowly add milk to the hot flour and butter and stir constantly until creamy. Stir in onions and transfer to an ovenproof serving dish. Use ONION salt instead of plain. Bake just until bubbly (but not brown) in a 350F oven.

I am not a creamed onion fan, but made it to bring to thanksgiving dinner.   I used more flour to make a thicker base, didnt use all the liquid, and added some minced onions.  It was refrigerated overnight.  Everyone liked it.  Next time I would use less flour than i did and about the same liquid.  Was pretty easy to make.  I think I will be making again next year.

Too much liquid for the amount of onions and really quite bland. The second time around, I doubled the onions. Added paprika, onion powder, lots of black pepper and some sharp cheddar. I thought it was a big improvement. Still a good recipe to start with.

Good, but I added a teaspoon of ground nutmeg to the white sauce. To me, tasted bland without it.

I think there is an error in the amount of onions for this recipe. Maybe 2 pounds of onions or 1 package? One cup of onions would not serve six people. Otherwise the ingredients listed would make great creamed onions.

Try using Rice Flour for a gluten-free dish!  This is a favorite of our family.
