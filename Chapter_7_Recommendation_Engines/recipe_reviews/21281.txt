Not bad, but didn't quite impress my taste buds.  I'll take my crab a different way.

Disappointed.  It was not firm, just comes apart after cooking and for some reason (probably the mayonnaise) was greasy. The taste was on the bland side.

I replaced the canned crabmeat with imitation crabmeat.  My family had mixed feelings about the flavor.  Very easy quick and easy to make. I think it would be great for a brunch with plenty of other choices.
