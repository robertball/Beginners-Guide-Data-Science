I used this today on a grilled jalape√±o-cheddar sausage and it was too sweet even after adding more horseradish. If you're looking for a sweet-slightly spicy mustard/dipping sauce this would be good. It just didn't worked too well on the sausage but that's not to say it isn't tasty.

I love this mustard with 2 tablespoons of pickle relish mixed with it. It's great in Deviled Eggs and on hot dogs and hamburgers.

This sauce is exactly like what I've found at one of our favorite local sandwich shops on a roast beef sandwich. It is the perfect combination of sweet tangy and not overly spicy. I absolutely love it. Thanks Kristy for sharing this simple sauce.
