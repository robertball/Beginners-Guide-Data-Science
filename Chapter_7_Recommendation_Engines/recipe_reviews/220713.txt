These were great! Very simple to prepare and very tasty...I did not make the dipping sauce, but plan to next time. Hubby and the little guy loved these too. I did season my egg w/ garlic powder and seasoned salt and used seasoned breadcrumbs, which made these very flavorful. These cooked up in a flash and were gone just as quick. Oh, BTW, I got more than 12 out of this recipe...more like 25 or so (just a heads up)... Will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very nice twist on asparagus.I did make two substitutions though.I used Panko bread crumbs and for the sauce I used 2tbls. Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce instead of green chilis.It was awesome!

I also seasoned the flour with seasoned salt and onion salt. Used 1/2 breadcrumbs and 1/2 Panko mix. It was fabulous! Dip in ranch dressing for a great appetizer!!!

Excellent!  But really how can you go wrong with breading and frying something?  My asparagus was very young and thin so it cooked quickly and was delicious.  I will do this again.  Thanks!

We didn't think we liked asparagus, but now we know we do!  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I had to toast whole wheat bread and crumble it up.  It still turned out really well.

You had me at coating and frying! I didn't substitute anything, but I did use seasoned breadcrumbs instead and added a little garlic salt to the flour. They came out amazing and the dipping sauce was awesome!! My fiance is already asking me to make them again.

You lose too much of the asparagus flavor. I'm sure to make the dip for get togethers again, it was delicious.
