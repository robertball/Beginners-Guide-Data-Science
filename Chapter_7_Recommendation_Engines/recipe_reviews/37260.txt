This was very good! The only thing was the crust was a little too thick for the unmassive filling. If I were to make it again, I would probably double the filling, since the shortbread over powered its taste. Also, I would cover the edges with tinfoil, because the shortbread browns easily

Super easy and delicious!  A great alternative to traditional apple pies.  I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar and changed spices to 3/4 t cinnamon and 1/4 t nutmeg.  Took it to work and my co-workers went crazy!!

This was very easy to make.  A little too much crust.  The golden del. apples didn't have too much taste, too sweet.  I prefer a jonathan or macintosh. I made it the night before using it and the crust got soggy.  I may try pre-baking the crust a bit before adding the apples next time.  I served it with the cinnamon ice cream recipe from this site and everybody raved about both dishes.

When we first tasted this pie we rated it as delicious and definately a keeper.  By the time we had the second piece, the crumb crust had turned to "mush".  Did anyone else have this trouble? Also, the apples were a bit too firm.  Perhaps cook them a bit first?

Very Good!! my daugahter liked it. I just add 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon becuase I like it a lot. The shortbread mix needs at least 2 tablespoon more.

WONDERFUL!!!  This could also be called "Peach Shortbread Pie".  I made this recipe with about 2 pounds of peaches in a round stoneware pan.  I added one-fourth cup more brown sugar and it was superb.  My daughter said "why make pie when you can make this"!  We all loved it.  I baked it for 50 minutes uncovered. This is definately a keeper!

This is a great pie!  It went over well with my family.  We also liked it because it is not very sugary.  I will recommend this one to my friends. -Geri Culwell

I fixed this for hubby's potluck to go with the Irish chicken & dumplings recipe here on allrecipes, and I have to say, I had a hard time letting it go out the door! The shortbread is fantastic, and the golden delicious apples are a nice change from my usual granny smiths.  Wonderful flavor and aroma, all though the apples were really juicy, and the pie was a bit watery.  Maybe tossing the apples with a bit of flour along with the brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg combo would help?  Highly recommend for a very simple apple pie, without the hassle of rolling out dough!

Perfect.  I pressed down in the center of the shortbread mix and forced the sides up a bit to create a small well.  Other than that, I followed this recipe precisely.  Turned out fantastic!

I chose this recipe because I was looking for something just a little bit different than the usual pie or crisp. It was different but not as good. It was simple to make, but just as simple as making a crisp. I won't make this again.

Some people might think this pie isn't sweet enough, but our family loved it.  It was so easy that my 9 year old son was able to do most of the recipe himself.  I only had to separate the eggs for him and take it out of the oven.  We all agreed that the crust was the best part.

This recipes gets thumbs way up from me.  The underneath crust came out crispy, sweet, and slightly brown.  The pie itself was very tasty.  The best thing about it is that this is a complete pie without any dough-rolling at all. Cheers!  I made no changes to this recipe except letting the pie bake for an additional 5 minutes to be sure it was done.

I have made this twice now and it's turned out fabulous both times.  I used granny smith apples.  The crust is wonderfully thick, like shortbread.  Those who usually don't like pie crust especially enjoyed it.

Made this recipe from magazine found some years ago and it was a favorite. Just found my handwritten copy again and the pie's  baking now in the oven. The original recipe called for an 8 inch springform pan. My husband loves the filling softer, so I usually precook the apples, as well as use a few more than the recipe calls for. I almost always end up baking it about 10-15 min. longer, as well. (Maybe because it's in a spring form pan?)I, too have problems if the pie sits overnight-it can get a little soggy. Happily, it's such an awesome recipe, that is almost never an issue!  :)

This was easy and tasted good but there was too much crust.  The top crust was done but the bottom was still not cooked.  I will be making this again but I will use less crust on the bottom and I will try with Granny smith apples.  I think I will try like another reviewer said and bake the bottom crust and then add the apples and top crust.

This is amazing.  for some reason my crust was mush, i'm almost sure it's because i messed up the recipe a little, but a night in the fridge made it harden.  besides that, this is just delicious!

This was a very good very easy dessert.  I served it with whipped cream and everyone loved it.  I heated a piece up for about 20 seconds in the microwave the next day and it came out okay.  It didn't hold together as well but it's still good.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was delicious, much easier than a pie, and was universally enjoyed by all who ate it!

The only thing I would change is that there is too much crust/topping and not enough apples in this recipe.  I would simply reduce the amount of crust I made next time.

Love this pie - so easy.  Several have mentioned that their crust turned mushy - ours did not - we stored it in the refrigerator, and I also used Gala apples instead of the Golden Delicious.  Also doubled (at LEAST) the cinnamon.  Our daughter is not typically an apple pie eater, but she LOVED this.  I will also try it in a peach version and will definitely make it either way again and again in the years to come.

The dough was a bit sticky, I had a hard time pressing it into the plate. I did use more apples than it called for, I was using a deep dish pie plate which I won't do again since there wasn't enough crust! It tasted really good the first day, then the crust does get soggy. Next time I'll use a smaller pie plate and make sure it gets served the same day!

A tart? A pie? Whatever it is it's wonderful!I added a bit more flour after to the apples, but I would not do the same next time. Typically the apples would be the star in a dessert like this, but we just loved the shortbread type crust. I may go splurge on a tart pan the next time I make it. Thanks Sera!

Yum!  The shortbread dough seems VERY crumbly however do not worry, it can be patted into place and will bake up fine.  I would suggest sprinkling some brown and white sugar over top of the apples if they are tart (e.g. Granny Smith), I used macs and it turned out fine per the recipe.  I did not use all the dough; there was a lot left after making a crust and I didn't want to bury the apples.  A nice fairly simple, quick apple pie.

A little dry, too much topping.  If I made it again, add cranberries to give it some flavor.

Really like this recipe. I've made it twice and everyone likes it. I like the fact that it doesn't have shortening like a regular pie crust. I prefer to have good old butter. Easy to make too. I used Macintosh apples and they turned out nice. Also want to note that I used way more apples based on previous reviews.

I did not try this pie because I had made so many desserts but everyone who tried it loved it so im giving it 5 stars.  I will definately make it again so I can try it.
