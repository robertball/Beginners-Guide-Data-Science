I made this delicious quick bread twice...the first time as printed, so I would know how it should taste, the second I used 2/3 cup honey because my husband prefers it to white sugar and added 1 more teaspoon baking soda (because of the honey).  Both times it was very tasty.  In fact, my husband has asked that I bake this bread instead of serving store-bought.  To top that, my sweet mother-in-law insisted on taking the second loaf home with her!  High praise indeed from a retired professional baker and a lady who raised a large family on homemade bread!

A hearty bread which is very easy to make.  I found it a little too sweet; next time I'll use less sugar.

I loved this bread!!  I halved the recipe to make one loaf.  The dough was quite thick after mixed so I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I did rise an inch or two and that surprised me as I am used to having to use yeast.  I baked it an hour and it came out well.  I also used no whole wheat flour as I didn't have any on hand, so I used all all purpose white flour from hodgkin's mill.  I also had to sub rice syrup for the sugar as I cannot have sugar.  I also had no buttermilk so I sub full fat plain yogurt.  It turned out great, butter on top made it awesome.  It was almost sweet without being too sweet and very dense.  I will make this again soon!!

This is definitely an easy bread to make.  I love that there's no yeast in it - makes it mighty quick to make.  

Personally, I love the sweetness of it, but if you're not into it you could easily cut down on the sugar to maybe 2/3 cup.  Still, it's delicious!

One of the best recipes I have in my extensive recipe collection! So easy to make. Rich, moist, and delicious! Low in cholesterol because it contains no eggs, nor shortening of any kind, but it is a bit high in sodium. The recipe I use is for a single loaf. We use this bread for Communion at church.

five stars for the simplicity and tastiness of this recipe. i had extra buttermilk i wanted to use in a recipe easily and quickly. i only had unbleached flour on hand, reduced the amount of sugar, and baked in small loaf pans. the bread was wonderfully (but not too) sweet and had just the right amount of substance (not too fluffy nor dense). try it!

I have only one(!) 9x5 bread pan so I cut the recipe in half, used low fat buttermilk and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. It came out wonderfully delicious! My husband wants me to make it instead of buying bread at the store. I suppose I should buy a second bread pan...

So I don't like having to substitute, but had to thinking I had three cups buttermilk instead of two - was gonna make 3/4 recipe.  Anyway, stuck with the 3/4 plan using 2c buttermilk & 1c Greek yogurt. Added sugar as listed since that yogurt is a bit cheesy (if you know what I mean. & if you don't, try it - you will.  ;D)  I thought it was okay.  Kids thought it was "too brown."  :D  'Wish they liked it.  Oh, in one of the three miniloaves I made, I added a heaping eighth teaspoon cinnamon.  It was just barely noticeable.  'More would've been fine.  It's pretty dense, as expected.

Very similar to the Colonial Brown Bread on this site, which we preferred to this recipe. Taste is pretty much the same, except it seemed that this bread got moldy quicker than the Colonial recipe. Could just be the funky weather we've been having.

I made this to get rid of some buttermilk that was leftover. A good dense bread. Quick to make. I cut back on the sugar because of reviews since I was making it to go with roasted chicken.  Glad I did. I think this would be good in the morning, toasted.

I had about 1 cup whole wheat flour and used AP flour for the rest and used Stevia instead of sugar. This was EASY, quick, baked beautifully in 45 minutes and was wonderful! Nice and dense (great with the stew I cooked it to go with) but there was a lightness to it as well I loved the crust!

I made this bread this a.m. just to give it a try.  So far half of one loaf is gone - I'm thinking it's a keeper.  My kids and husband seem to really like it.  I made it according to the recipe.  I think raisins would be good in it, too.

Great!  How can you beat a tasty, simple-to-make bread,  It tastes good with honey butter, cream cheese, peanut butter . . . reminds me of a bagel in some ways.

I had some sunflowers seeds and 1/4c oatmeal. This had an earthy flavor w/ a little sweetness to it.  It also was a dense bread. Not bad but I will not substitute it for a lighter yeast bread.

Made this today for the first time and it is delicious.  I did cut back on the sugar a bit and I was glad I did.  I only made one loaf but will make another in a few days.  I think i will make it a savory loaf then with some chives and other herbs mixed in.

This bread is great. Right up there with yeast bread but much faster. Great with soup and  for sandwiches. I did change up the sugar and used 1/3 c of honey instead. Softened the honey in the microwave before adding to milk. Also didn't have buttermilk so added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to sour it, then stirred in honey to that.  When done I buttered the tops while warm. I even had a little batter left over I was afraid to add to the pretty full pans so I stirred in more milk and made pancakes with the rest which turned out tasty as well.

Loved it.  Followed the recipe but had to "make" my own buttermilk (milk and lemon juice) , at about 40 minutes I tented a piece of foil over the bread in the oven because it was getting very brown.  That was sufficient and the loaf turned out perfectly.  It's dense.  It's a bit sweet but not offensively sweet.  Sliced thin and spread with butter it was a perfect accompaniment to hot soup on a near zero night.  P.S.  I do not like wheat bread . . . but this is the single exception.

This is tasty and chewy. I forgot to dissolve the baking soda in the buttermilk first and it came out nicely anyway.

This was ok but we all thought it had a slightly odd flavor and was way too sweet, even though I reduced the sugar.  Probably won't make again, although I'd love to find a quick substitute for yeast bread when I've run out!

My only change was using Splenda in place of sugar.  I have mixed feelings about this bread.  It was incredibly quick and easy to throw together but it was far from my favorite.  I took some to my mother and she thought it was really good.  I'm sure it would complement some dishes, as it is very dense and hearty.  I actually think it would taste pretty good using 100% all-purpose flour but that would take all the nutrition out of it.

First time buying 100% whole wheat flour. I found this recipe on the side, but I cut in half,and I added splenda about 4 or 5 pks, I used Fat Free milk and I used 4 pks of Also Salt (salt subsitiute) Turn out great, not to sweet and not salty. I think next time I may just add 2 or 3 pks of splenda. Just  because I don't care to much for sweet bread. I am glad to have to use regular salt.

Delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this simple recipe came out!  Also surprised at how much it rose.  I only made half the recipe because I only had enough buttermilk for one loaf.  Also, I used lowfat buttermilk and it is wonderful.  I think i will try making it again into little loaves with pumpkin pie spices and maybe some chopped up prunes or cranberries!  If it works out they'll make great holiday gifts!  Thanks for the recipe!

This one was a nice change for us!  I rarely use whole wheat flour, but had some and chose this recipe.  Since there are just two of us, I made 1/4 the recipe using a small loaf pan that's volume is about half as much as a regular 9x5 loaf pan.  I did cut the sugar in half, per other reviewers suggestions.  I baked mine for 40 minutes and it tested done with a toothpick.  I did think it was just a bit dry, but maybe I over-baked it.  I'm anxious to try the leftovers toasted.  I think it will be even better!  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  We tried toasting this and it is even better!

This was so easy to make!  I only used 2/3 cup sugar because some reviewers said it was too sweet, but next time I will follow the recipe exactly--I think it needs the full amount. I'm not much of a baker, and I have a fear of bread making in particular, so I was so happy to see that neither proofing nor kneading were necessary.  It was a sticky batter, and the bread came out dense and soft. I am going to freeze one loaf, so we will see if it freezes well.  Thanks for this!

Excellent. I made one loaf and everyone loved it. I believe this is the easiest and best quick bread that I've made in many years of cooking. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

LOVE this bread!  It's dense, but not too heavy.  Just a bit sweet & so good buttered!  I bet it'd be good made into french toast, too. 
I did cut the recipe in half, and made just one loaf.  I used a glass loaf pan, and only had to bake the loaf about 45-50 minutes.  Truly is a very easy recipe!

A good dark bread with a slightly tangy after-taste, but nothing spectacular about it. Will probably make it again, but will not be a staple at home.

Made this just as directed, and while this was good, the sweetness of the bread wasn't really my cup of tea. The crust and texture were great, but to me, the taste was very similar to a graham cracker. The kids might like it toasted with peanut butter and jelly? I'll give it a try.

I have to cut out yeast due to migraines. I love this recipe! The bread has a pretzel-like taste due to the baking soda. It is wonderful as sandwich bread or toasted with jam.

I've been making this slightly sweet and dense quickbread for several years after finding the recipe on the Bomb's Red Mill flour package. Everyone loves it, it's super easy to make, and it makes amazing toast. Now that I see others have replaced sugar with other sweeteners, I'll give that a try next time.

This is a nice, dense bread that is simple to make.  I sub'd the sugar for an equal amount of honey, personal preference.  Tastes very earthy with the whole wheat flour.  It's a nice compliment to a hearty soup or just on its own.

My very picky family LOVED this bread... and I even oopsed a bit!  I had no butter milk, so I added fresh lemon juice to plain milk only to discover that I had no baking soda.  I corrected with extra baking powder and removed the salt. Served it with a lentil loaf and received two thumbs up from everyone.  I'll make this again for sure, next time with the correct ingredients.

So easy and so good. Next time I will try a little less sugar but great as written. Had to use milk soured with vinegar and it worked just fine.
Be sure the soda is all dissolved.

Very simple to through together... the final product did seem to be rather dense... but the bread had great flavor even though I cut the sugar back by half... will definitely make again if a need a bread but don't have prep time for kneading...

The creator of this recipe can not be serious when calling this wheat bread. 1 cup of sugar made this cake...a cake without any added flavor like vanilla or cinnamon. It reminded me of a sweet, a very sweet cornbread. It would probably be good if you turned it into a banana or another sweet bread. I was looking for wheat bread....a huge dissapointment

This recipe was so easy. I was worried when it wasn't fluffy bread dough, but it cooked very well. My kids say "it's holy" and "this is like heaven." It's a winner recipe in my house!

I love that this is so easy to make AND it tastes good!  I think it's best warm out of the oven.  Also, I reduce the sugar  to half  of what the recipe calls for, and it is still plenty sweet.

This is a wonderful sweet bread and so super easy. I followed the recipe exactly as written and my family loved it. I think this bread would make a great base for banana nut bread or raisin nut bread. I am probably going to try one of those in the near future. I will definitely be making this again.

9/13/06 - I've never tried 'Swope Bread' before, but I wanted to make something bread-y without yeast or eggs. I did a half batch to make one loaf, and I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used 3 cups of all-purpose. I used about 1/4 cup sugar and around the same amount of honey. I used 1 cup of fat-free vanilla yogurt and 1 cup of milk plus 1 tablespoon of vinegar. It turned out really well, and my 3-year old loves it! I think she believes she's eating cake as it's a sweet bread. Next time, I'll probably cut the sugar in half. Thanks, Melissa, for a marvelous recipe! *** 9/14/06 - I have to reduce my rating from 5 stars as the bread has a weird, almost chemical smell to it - like bleach or strong disinfectant - that's rather off-putting. It didn't have it just after coming out of the oven, but late last night and today, it's been very much there. I might try this again to see if it was just a fluke problem with my changes or if it's going to be a regular occurance.

You have to be in the mood for this bread.  I love it for breakfast, toasted with butter...YUM!  Very unique, but I really like it.  It's a different treat when you are bored with the same old bread.

I've baked this bread twice - once yesterday and now today - both times it turned out kind of spongey in texture - and it has a funny taste - although - no after taste - as you sometimes get with yeast-breads -- i like it but i don't really like it -- but i like that it's easy to bake - like a cake - you just mix everything together and pour it in the tin - and it bakes so fast - and you don't have to wait for it to rise and get your hands sticky kneeding it - so this bread has it's advantages - but it's no 5 star bread in my opinion.

Excellent sweet bread.  I made it for my co-workers as a treat and everyone raved about it.  This could not have been easier!
