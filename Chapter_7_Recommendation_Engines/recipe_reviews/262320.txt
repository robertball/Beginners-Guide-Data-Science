This turned out perfect! My roma's were small so I used 3 but that is the only change I made. There never seems to be enough liquid in the recipes I've made in the past but this one was spot on. The only change I would make next time is to use cilantro instead of parsley. Either way, this was excellent!

Made this for our school's church this past Friday for no meat soups. It was a hit. The chili gives it a nice kick. Would def make this again for my family.
