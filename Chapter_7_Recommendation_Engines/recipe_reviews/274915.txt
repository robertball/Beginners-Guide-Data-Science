This was so good! I did add an extra can of chicken broth once all ingredients had been added. Otherwise, I followed instructions exactly. So simple and delicious!

This soup was by far my favorite of the year.  I actually substituted 3/4 C. uncooked wild rice for the potatoes and it was amazing!

I made some modifications Along the way but it was a great soup.  I added two more cups of chicken broth, I used 2/3 of a pound of chicken sausage  and 2/3 of a cup of half-and-half. I also use mild sausage instead of hot and spicy for the kiddos.  Personally, I would not add the half-and-half next time. Not because it was too thick but because I personally love clear broth soup.

This is a lovely base recipe for a soup!  I did end up adding some chicken bouillon, Italian seasoning, and a little crushed red pepper flakes at the end after having followed the instructions exactly to up the flavor.  If I were to make this soup in the future I'd definitely use spinach rather than kale, but that's just a personal preference.  The whole family enjoyed this one!
