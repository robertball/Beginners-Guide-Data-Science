Broccoli tossed with Dijon just didn't appeal to me, neither in taste nor appearance.  But cheese sauce made with Velveeta did!  I don't think I've had that since my kids were still at home, YEARS ago. I do like Dijon mustard, however, so I mixed it in a bowl with the cheese and a little milk and microwaved it, making a creamy cheese sauce with a little Dijon tang that I drizzled over the cooked broccoli.  Great memories of kid-friendly meals and good old-fashioned comfort food, updated with a Dijon twist.

Very good change of pace veggie dish. Everyone is able to adjust or add to their own taste buds and preferences, and I totally agree with Chef Clare, Please try and understand what you are talking about before you berate someones recipe, because you used substitutions or didn't make it properly....  Food and its preparation is an art and talent that not everyone has, but does have the capability of learning.  An experience.  Too many cooks spoil the recipe of origin.  Make a new recipe of your own already..... Good recipe....Thanks.

Very simple and tasty!  This was a great change from the plain cheesey broccoli I usually eat.

I guesstimated the cheese and cut it into bite sized chunks, let it sit out until room temperature. Be careful cooking this in the microwave, one minute on high could burn it easily. I did the cheese first for thirty seconds, then stirred it and added a good splash of milk and a spoonful of Dijon mustard and stirred it in real good, then nuked again for thirty seconds. I continued to add a little Dijon until it reached the taste I wanted, I never came to the full amount the recipe calls for, so I'd suggest add and taste, since Dijon can over power if you add too much. This was a very easy topping for steamed broccoli and my family said to make it again. I love Velveeta on broccoli and the added tang of the Dijon was a very nice touch. The milk helps thin it a bit so it pours nicely over your vegetables and keeps it from hardening up too quick when cooling off.

Good but nothing special.  It's easy enough to make again but not sure I will. Just wasn't what I was hoping for. Thanks anyways.

I agree with the last reviewer.  Don't write a review that is totally useless.  When I read reviews I am looking for valid information re: variations to the recipe.  AND by the way I am 62 and this was a recipe my grandmother used when I was young except she used regular mustard....and we loved it.

very tasty change from our normal steamed broccoli.   Definitely needs Velveta type cheese and just had to cut back a bit on Dijon.  I feel that you have to use the ingredients given for this recipe to be a success otherwise do not expect good results and complain.

This was delicious! I used shredded cheddar cheese because that's all I had. Next time I will increase the amount of cheese slightly.

Made this for the Recipe Photo contest.  2 Tbsp. was a lot of dijon for just one head of broccoli for my taste.  Even with cutting the dijon back quite a bit I found the flavors of the processed cheese (Velveeta) with the dijon to be a little strange.

I make my cheesy broccoli with frozen broccoli, sliced onion, American cheese slices (I don't keep Velveeta around) and cracked pepper in the microwave.  The mustard was a perfect addition to give this dish a little extra zest.  Didn't have any Dijon so I used a big squirt of spicy brown mustard, and my hubby says it's the best I've ever made!  Thanks for a keeper!

AWESOME.  Love the tangy zip on this.  I will try again w/ a lower fat cheese to see if I can remove some calories/fat from it, but other than that delicious way to eat the broc.

Might be worth the calorie sacrifice to use a fattier cheese, though.

This was ok - though I am not sure how you are supposed to get the Velveeta to melt smoothly without crisping, etc.  Will not make again.

I just didn't care for the flavor the mustard gave this. I thought it the cheese and mustard would make a nice combo but I was wrong. The cheese and broccoli on it's own would probably be great so the recipe isn't hopeless!

I used frozen broccoli so that I could do it all in the microwave (I got the broccoli about 2/3 cooked before adding the cheese and dijon).  This recipe is perfect for weeknight dinners -- quick, easy, and good.

This is a nice way to vary plain old broccoli.  Mostly I have used either the casserole (the one with eggs and mayo) or just sprinkled Parmesan over it, but this was a nice change!  I liked it and so did my husband.

I was pleasantly surprised with this simple and easy recipe.  I've also tried with Mexican velveeta and spicy brown mustard on sugar snap peas.  My husband and kids will eat any veggie smothered in this stuff.  Thanks!

good recipe. Fit time I made this I made a mistake.  (everyone makes mistakes) I used zen broccoli that I boiled and drained. It was ok. Second try, I used fresh broccoli, steamed. Much better (at least I learn from  my takes ) for the record, I am not a chef, as are the vast majority of people on planet earth.

This was really good!  I boiled the broccoli for 5 minutes, then followed the recipe as directed.  This will definitely go into the rotation!

I put a little worchestershire or soy sauce in the mix, and thin with milk. Sometimes I use mozzarella or some soft cheese if I have it.

Adam LOVED it!  First time he's ever eaten broccoli and liked it.  Dan likes it better the old way, but enjoyed the change.  Going to try cutting them in half next time.  Cooking time for this was 35-40 minutes.  Cooked it in broiler pan bottom.

Quick, easy and tasty!  I used less dijon (only 1 tbsp) because of the kids.  The entire family loved it! Thanks.

Surprisingly tasty and very easy!  I used plain yellow mustard for mine, and it was still good.

My family loved this. We've done cheese on broccoli for years and this was a surprisingly good change. My family doesn't care for Dijon so I used half Dijon and half yellow mustard. I also used shredded cheddar, which was all I had on hand. I stirred it half way through the microwave heating and had to heat it longer. I wished I'd made more, it was so good everyone wanted seconds.

Loved it! I used honey mustard and low-Fat processed cheese food. I steamed the broccoli first then combine the mustard and cheese, then added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper. Poured over the broccoli and mixed lightly.

My son, daughter, & I all loved this. My husband hated it, I didn't know he hates Dijon!!! Anyway, I just used a pound of frozen petite flowerets. Cooked in the micro, & proceeded from there. Used 4 T. light Cheese Whiz. Easy, good, & low carb!!
