When I tasted this before cooking, I found the flavor to be rather thin and unremarkable. So I added: molasses, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a smidge of rum. With these additions, it was excellent.

This is my recipe. I found using more potatos cuts back on the sweetness just enough.You can also make this ahead of time and just reheat.

I love this dish but for health reasons I did a few things different. I boiled the potatoes first, then skinned them (the skins come off easier that way). I substitued Splenda for the white sugar and added 1/3 cup brown sugar. I also mixed in walnuts and used egg subsitute instead of the real things. For butter I used a Heart Smart brand of butter that really did taste like butter but was made largely with olive oil. The only thing I did allow for us was the miniature marshmellows but not too many. We ate this stuff like it was going out of style and we didn't feel bad afterward. :)

We have this every year for Thanksgiving, it's a staple.  I do add a little cinnamon and nutmeg, also great with miniature marshmallows and crushed pecans as a topping before cooking!

Excellent dish! I made this for dessert and, after just one spoonful, my wife insisted "you gotta make this for my mother!" One change: I used 3 tbs butter instead of 1/2 cup.

I liked it, but it was far too sweet and became very clumpy.  Don't know what I did wrong.

I thought this recipe was great. However, I thought it was a little too bland so  I made some modifications. I added -  - 2 overripe bananas  - 2 tablespoons of cinnamon - 1 tablespoon of nutmeg  I thought the bananas really accented the orange juice nicely. You can def. taste it in every bit so don't use, if you don't like banana.

It's missing the "Wow Factor" for us. It was bland, even after I followed the suggestion to add cinnamon. For me, the orange juice was weird, because I could taste it in every btie. I will try to make it again, but will follow other suggestions of adding nutmeg and all spice, and maybe cut back on the O.J.

I was looking for a recipe to imitate what I had as a child where the sides were crunchy and the pudding was thick enough to hold in one's hand, like a brownie. This wasn't it, but it was still good. I didn't have juice so I used 1 cup water and 1 tablespoon orange extract. I also used 1 tablespoon vanilla because I like to taste my flavors. This was a good dish served warm, alone or with whipped topping.

This is a really nice side dish, although it would have been nice if it were a bit more creamy. I cut the sugars to 1/2 c. each and the butter (I used oil) to 1/4. I also added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Wow -- this was great! My kids helped make it and gobbled it up. I halved the butter and sugar, and it still came out tasting plenty sweet. I might even cut the butter and sugar to a fourth and serve it as a side dish next time.

I took over the job of bringing sweet potatoes to our family gathering at Thanksgiving.  Even though I had a hard act to follow, everyone loved this recipe.  I roasted the potatoes instead of boiling them and it turned out great.  My sister found vanilla marshmallows at Whole Food Market.  Those were the perfect addition to it.  I'll probably bring it again next year.

I liked this okay, but it's pretty bland.  Maybe because I had to substitute the dark brown sugar with light brown.  Should have added some molasses.  Seems like it needs some kind of topping.
