Made this Key Lime Pound Cake yesterday and was a little leary about the temperature and cooking time but to my surprise....This was absolutely a wonderful change to the regular pound cake...If you like lime and want a velvety dense moist pound cake...This is it!! I do a lot of baking and this will be in my "unique favorites" for a citrus pound cake...Thanks again...Great recipe..Marie

Hey girls, if you give this recipe another chance ,,it works. First,, dont poke any holes in it, instead of useing
key lime juice, I used 2 limes,I also added lime zest in place of key lime juice. Key lime juice is very, very tart, So it becomes easy to over do. I think 1/2 c. key lime juice too much. Try ,juice from 2 limes ,plus the zest, then, juice from 2 limes plus the zest
in the iceing,That is what will make you   want to make this again
 Karen

This recipe sounded delicious.  There was just one review when I printed it out, 5 stars. Baked it and was disgusted (sorry, "disappointed" doesn't convey my feelings) with the results.  The "glaze" saturated the cake, making it appear undercooked and unappealing. I was too mortified to serve it to my guests.  Unfortunately the flavor was not good either, so into the garbage it went.  I was incredulous of the one 5 star review I had seen, and I went back to see if any other reviews had been added, perhaps helpful hints to improve it.  That's when I saw that others have had this problem.  With the price of ingredients this was an expensive disaster, not to mention a total waste of time and electricity to bake. If anyone is daring enough to try this recipe, at least make a true and proper glaze using confectioners sugar that won't saturate the cake.  Sorry about the bad review, but it's an honest one.

Yes, this recipe definitely has problems as evidenced by the fact that, a) it’s been ignored, b) only 16 people have reviewed it and c) it has a low rating. I’ve been eyeing it for some time, thinking that one day I wanted to “have at it.”  Today was that day. I think what happens is that just like with top chefs, in the interest of being creative we stray from the tried and true chemistry of a recipe to come up with something different that we can call our own.  That may be what happened here.  I fiddled with this recipe big time, but now it works and can be prepared with confidence in my view, as opposed to its continuing to be neglected.  So… 2 c. of fat is too much…reduce the shortening to 1/2 cup.  Two cups of sugar is not enough – up it to 3 cups.  Add 1/4 tsp. salt to heighten flavor.  Increase the milk to 1 c. and decrease the lime juice to 1/4 cup.   Add 1 T. of grated lime zest and, if you can get your hands on it, 1 tsp. of pure lime extract.  (I buy mine online)  The ingredients for the glaze are just fine…BUT…it has to be heated to a boil, boiled for about 2 min., then brushed onto the warm cake.  I didn’t bother to poke holes in the cake – it absorbed the buttery, sweet lime glaze like a sponge.  The bottom line?  This cake is incredibly delicious.  Moist, buttery, beautiful and boldly lime.  Don’t pass this by! I’m rating this 4 stars (but it’s really 5!) just so that it isn’t overlooked, even tho’ as written I’d most likely rate it a 1 or 2 star recipe.

This recipe needed obvious (and not so obvious) changes. Don’t use a stand mixer to blend batter; crumb will become too dense—a reaction of the long-chain gluten (protein) strands in the flour being over mixed. Replace all shortening with approximate quantity of butter. Not sure exactly how much I ended up using, but two cups—4 sticks—way too much. Add ‘til consistency is cake-like, and batter tastes good. (A batter that tastes good bakes into a cake that tastes good!). Whip the egg whites firm and fold into batter.  Don’t add the glaze until after the cake has cooled completely: Hot cakes are especially porous & glaze will sink in. Also, just mix the sugar and lime juice (no butter) together, then heat without stirring until it begins to bubble around the edges and can glaze the back of a spoon. Prompted by other reviewer comments, I decided to use my simple confectioner’s icing instead of glaze. Just one cup confectioner’s sugar mixed into 1 TBS lime juice. Fork drip it over the cooled cake in a lattice pattern. For the time-constrained among us, there’s an easy solution to this recipe. Simply replace part of the water when preparing a yellow cake mix (I like Duncan Hines) with approx. ¼ cup concentrated frozen limeade, and a few drops of lime extract. Add more or less of both, depending on the amount of lime flavor desired (remember- taste the batter!).  Let cool and add your sugar/lime juice glaze to the top. Makes an awesomely good, quick, and inexpensive cake!

This was one of the most decadent, delicious, rich, fantabulous-tasting desserts I have ever made... but it was very unattractive to look at. I made it for the birthday party of a dear friend, so it was presented to understandingly forgiving company. The texture was dense & sticky, and it came out of the pan unwillingly, leaving a crumbly, woebegon-looking crust. But when everybody tasted it, they did not care what it looked like. My mouth is watering just thinking about this cake. I've made it twice, both times it was pitiful looking. And both times it was so delicious you could hear the angels sing. Make it for the people you love, who will forgive it for being homely.

I love Key Lime anythig.  I made this a few nights nights ago and it was delightful.  I followed the exact recipe no alterations.  However I am not sure if I did the "glazing" right. It soaked into the cake not leaving a glaze at all.  I did find that adding a dollop of cool whip when serving adds to presentation and enhances flavor.

What a wonderful pound cake! I was looking for something different and decided to try this. I actually doubled up the glaze and poked alot of holes in the cake. Everyone who was fortunate to have a slice absolutely loved it. It has become my new "favourite" as well as my family's.

I was not impressed with this at all.. Followed the recipe completely.. It is too heavy to be called a pound cake, and the glaze soaks in and turns to a gummy center, giving the impression that the cake is not baked completely.. Not really much flavor.. All in all, I wouldn't recommend it or try it again.. Sorry guys..

This cake has a wonderful flavor, but the time it took me to squeeze the limes, will make me think, before I fix it, again.

No stars...I should have read what several others had written.  I think someone left out the salt needed to make it bake & rise better.

The ingredients were not the usual pound cake quantity...the cake was doughy and very heavy. I actually tried this twice thinking it was something I did wrong. Maybe increasing the sugar and decreasing the amount of shortening vs butter could be the solution. I also ran out of key lime juice and used orange juice. Shouldn't think that would matter either. Hope this helps

Followed the adjustments provided by naples 34102 and they were on point!  My frosting didn't turn out as well but that's an easy fix even if I have to add just a pinch of powder sugar to the glaze.  My family devoured this cake!  Thanks naples 34102

I was really really hesitant about trying this recipe based on some of the reviews, but decided to give it a chance, and decide for myself.        I honestly don't know what all the bad reviews were about.  If you enjoy key limes, you will find this cake delicious.     I did not use the glaze. I also chose to bake it in the stainless steel bowl that comes with the kitchenaid mixer, and increased the bake time by about a half an hour or so. The cake was very moist since it was baked in a deep bowl, and I just cut a slight bit off the top layer because it was a bit too brown for my taste.  I then and inverted the cake onto a plate, frosted it, and decorated it.  I ended up with a very cool ball shaped cake.   It was delicious.  Again, I did not use the glaze, so maybe with the glaze it would be too strong of a taste.  but for me it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing.  I encourage others to take the recipe, experiment with it, and with a few minor adjustments, you can really be creative with it.   For someone with no cooking experience, you may not have the ability to modify the instructions to make it work PERFECTLY, so for that reason I rated it a four.  For taste however, I give it a five.

This in my opinion is far from pound cake. I bake and cook alot and thought I would try this one. This is not a tasty cake whatsoever..Lesson learned, stick to tried and true pound cake recipies passed down from family and flavor them as desired..The texture is crumbly and honestly lacks flavor. I think the shortening kills it.

I agree that 2 cups of butter/shortening is too much--reduce to 1.5 (and even a teaspoon of shortening is just gross--I only used butter).  I don't know why there's butter in the glaze.  I just boiled and cooled sugar and lime juice (and doubled the measurements) and it was just fine.  I also added lime (not key lime) zest to the cake batter, which I probably won't do again.

This cake was a lot of work, a lot of mess, not very pretty, and only ok.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but it was just too much to consider making it again for something that was only ok.  Also, it became abundantly clear while batter was dripping out and burning in the oven, that a loaf pan is not a suitable alternative for a tube pan =)

While I liked the flavors of this carke, it turned out kind of dry and very dense.  Not a big hit with my guests.
