Delicious! I did do it a little differently. I still used all of the ingredients as listed, but I mixed everything up in a bowl, put into a casserole dish, topped it with a little more shredded cheddar and bacon bits and baked it @ 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, until it was hot and bubbly. I served this with tortilla chips and crackers. The guys raved over this! I will def be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I put all of the ingredients in a crockpot and cooked it on low for 4 hours, mixing every 1/2 hour. Then set the crockpot on warm. Everyone loved it. It was so easy.

So I did the same as one of the reviewer's I mixed everything together I omitted the artichokes and I sprinkled a little blue cheese crumbles on top. I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. It was amazing!!!

Delicious. Changes I made: I used fresh bacon, cooked to a crisp on a countertop clamshell electric grill instead of the bacon bits; Instead of using ranch dressing in a bottle, I combined part of a packet of ranch salad dressing  mix with the sour cream; I used less cream cheese and more cheddar;  I also used only one can of chicken; as someone else suggested, I combined the ingredients in a baking dish and then browned/bubbled it up in the oven. Next time I may top with a few bleu cheese crumbles along with the bacon crumbles before baking.

i made this for a wine tasting party and paired it with a Cabernet.  it went over well.  i actually added more siraccha to spice it up some more.  if you like mild, just follow the recipe.   i had all the ingredients on hand, but you could easily make it without the artichokes. i can see adding chopped celery to this just before serving.  i served it with celery and rye crisps. i like erin's idea of switching the cheddar for bleu cheese...that sounds yummy erin.

I halved the recipe (for 10) and added ground black pepper and garlic powder.  I think it is yummy and a twist, or actually an addition, with the artichoke hearts.  Next time I will try fresh blue cheese instead of cheddar.

Easy to make, but the flavor was very bland.  I will not make this version again.

After it all melted together, I served in a small crock pot to keep warm.
