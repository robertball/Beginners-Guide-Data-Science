I have made several varieties of fried rice. You simply can't go wrong. I added fresh ORANGE pepper chopped up fresh from the garden, and a half bag of frozen corn. It was incredible!  Beans were also fresh out of the garden. We have chickens, so I threw in 3 eggs 

Kids absolutely loved it and told me this was the best one yet!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Easy, cheap, healthy and delicious.

Definitely a good beginning recipe. The method is right on. I messed with the ingredients though, adding extra veggies and some cooked chicken instead of sausage. It really only needed about 2 Tbsp of sesame oil. I also reduced the salt. I'd add some soy sauce in the end to pump up the flavor a bit. Thank you for the recipe.
