Was searching for a technique more than a recipe. This is great. I haven't had much success with recipes that instruct you to roast raw potatoes for a long time at high heat. That method usually yields a dry result. I boiled the potatoes completely before roasting them. I also increased the temp to 400 to get proper browning. Next  time, I need to remember to cut them in shapes with high surface area to volume, like thick slices or thin wedges, for maximum crispy area.

These were awesome. I used russet potatoes and cut them in quarters and since I don't have fresh rosemary I subbed about a teaspoon of dried instead. I was looking for something with flavor that was lower in fat and this is perfect.

I cannot believe what a difference this method makes! Turned out absolutely perfect on my first try. The only way I'll ever roast potatoes from now on. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe. I added paprika. I will keep it and use it regularly. I cut the potatoes to create more surface area, as a review I read suggested, so we could have more crunch. Perfect results.

One of my favorite potato dishes! I used minced garlic instead of garlic cloves because I didn't have any, and it worked fine. I would definitely add more spices (rosemary, thyme, etc) next time I make it. Perfectly crispy on the outside, it's a winner in my family!

I made a couple changes to the recipe. I used dried rosemary as I didn't have fresh. I crushed the garlic cloves a bit just to get more flavour out of them. After tossing the potatoes in the oil I added some garlic powder and onion powder to taste. Had some friends over for dinner and this is the first time I ran out of potatoes. They were a smash hit.

I was actually looking for a recipe to make Greek Style Lemon Potatoes when I stumbled on these! Tonight was the 3rd time I've made these and they're my favorite way, bar-none to prepare potatoes. If you are trying to get out of the butter habit with potatoes, you will never miss it again! These are too good for butter!

I found this to be very bland - surprising because I added more garlic and rosemary and salt than asked for. I won't make this again.

I'm not surprised that these are excellent. The only change I made was using Yukon Gold because the market didn't have New potatoes. Nothing more to say here, really. I loved this dish and this recipe is going into heavy rotation in my home.

This technique delivers crispy yet buttery potatoes! I always tried to soak my potatoes in cold water to make them crispy but it never really worked. This did! hooray!

Only alterations I made were to the way I chopped the potatoes. I took other reviewers suggestions and cut them into thick coins so that there was as much surface area as possible for crisping. Ok there was one other alteration... mama went a bit overboard with the cayenne but that's the way she like it. DELICIOUS! Crispy and comforting. Will make this recipe again!

This recipe is simple, as is the potato flavor. So,  I plan to use this recipe but include green peppers, onions, tomatoes, garlic, paprika, and cheese next time to spice it up a bit.

Very tasty recipe!  I made it with "old" yellow potatoes that were large, so I cut them into quarters and did everything just like the recipe (except for I doubled the minced garlic).  I was amazed how the garlic and rosemary flavors went into the potatoes while boiling!  I baked them for 35 minutes, then put some shredded italian cheese on top and turned off the oven.  A few minutes later, they were ready to eat and were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  My kid and husband loved them!

Turned out perfect! Followed directions except added additional seasonings to par cooked potatoes. The extra step in par cooking potatoes is what makes these so very delicious! Will definitely be making again in near future. Served along side grilled steak and steamed asparagus.

These are really good
I used a mix of baby potatoes most cut in half.
My roasting time was only 20 minutes. They are flavorful. Not sure if I'd go through all the trouble of the flavoring the water again..as they are good.. they just are as good as any well seasoned roasted potatoes. (Perhaps that is due to me using baby potatoes I don't know). None the less this recipe is a 5

Followed the recipe as written.  The potatoes were amazing. Crispy  on the outside and soft and creamy  flesh.  Will definitely make these potatoes again.

Yum!  Made as shown.  Loved the texture from pre-boiling the potatoes.  Next time, I will boil and season a double batch and freeze half before roasting in the oven.

First time making these.... my husband mentioned, while the potatoes and spices were boiling on the stove... "Wow, that smells strong".... between the garlic and the rosemary... it was very fragrant....  but I continued with the making these, according to the recipe... and in the end... they were crispy on the outside and tender creamy on the inside with a light delicate flavor... I will be making these again!

I liked the texture, but I think I will leave out the cayenne next time as I don't prefer the spiciness. Otherwise, pretty easy to prepare and yummy to eat.

These were great! I used a mix of russet and red potatoes (what I had on hand) and was out of rosemary so I used Italian seasoning. The flavor was really good. Also, I turned the broiler on high for the last few minutes to crisp them up a bit more. Supuer yummy!

I love this recipe and make it often. The bay leaf, garlic and rosemary used in the parboiling step add a very subtle special flavour to the finished dish.

Wow, obtained the crunchy, roasted potatoes I've always wanted.  The secret does seem to be in the parboiling.  It may seem tedious, but it doesn't take that long and is well worth it in the final outcome.

Really good.  I used about 1 tsp of dried rosemary since that was all I had.  It gave a nice subtle flavor to the potatoes.  Will make it again.

Sorry, this was a disappointment. Far too much work (Parboiling, etc) for minimal flavor return. I'll stick with the regular method of roasting potatoes.

Absolutely delicious!  Its the perfect amount of crunch vs. cream.  I ate it simply, with a side of sour cream sprinkled with onion salt.  Made my day =)

This time I cut the potatoes into quarters.  Next time I'm going to try cutting them into sixths to get even more of the crispy, crunchy exterior.

I found the potatoes a little bland even with the herbs and garlic in the boiling water. But the method is great, producing perfectly cooked potatoes with delightfully crispy skins. I would make this again, probably with some additional spices.

So easy and delicious!
I used a medley of Yukon gold, red and purple potatoes. In addition to the potatoes being fabulous, the garlic was delicious and I couldn't stop eating the crispy rosemary leaves. 
Will definitely make these again, probably soon.

I used russet potatoes, and thyme, as I was out of rosemary.  Still, these are scrumptious!  So very easy to make, crispy, crunchy outside, fluffy, warm insides make these the first thing on the table to run out.  This is now my favorite potato side dish. Yummmmmmm!!!!!!

Our family calls these Oven Browned Potatoes and we've always cooked them with a beef roast or leg of lamb, basting them with the meat juices, which have seasonings from the roast.  Then, while the meat is standing before carving, we put the potatoes under the broiler until brown and crispy.  DEElicious!

I followed the instructions exactly and these potatoes turned out perfectly. They were creamy and fluffy on the inside, and nicely crisp on the outside. Will definitely add this recipe to my list of side dishes, and not just for special occasions!

Chef John didn't disappoint. I will make my roasted potatoes following this simple recipe from now on. I like that I can do the boiling of the potatoes and then when we get home from whatever, I can just pop them into the oven. A definite keeper just as written.

These potatoes are very good. Make them as is! I like to add pepper to roasted potatoes. So I added a pinch and it was perfect! EDIT: I made this recipe using little potatoes. It came out perfect, and as a bonus, it can stretch a small batch of said potatoes.
