This was very filling and tasty. I used sour cream in place of the cream cheese; I thought the cream cheese would be too rich. Also, I probably used about 3/4 cup of salsa. 1/3 was not nearly enough to mix in with the beef and taco seasoning. I was worried that the rolls would not be baked through, so I turned the oven on the preheat and put the flattened rolls in by themselves until the oven was preheated. Then I layered the ingredients and baked for about 15 minutes, put the cheese on, and baked another 5. Perfect!

I thought this would be a great way to use up leftovers from taco night. It sounds great but, we didn't care for it. I think we would have liked it better with pizza dough instead of the cresents. We did serve it with sour cream.  I'll try it again with some changes.

Easy, tasty meal!  My kids can be picky, but they thought this was good.  Little changes I made:  *used 8 oz cream cheese, *used a whole can of refried beans, *used taco sauce rather than seasoning (lower sodium)--all changes worked great.

This was really good, and kid friendly to boot!!  But instead of the crescent rolls, I used the pizza dough that Pillsbury has.  A more non-seam to it. I also pre-baked it as the oven was pre-heating as others suggested.  I also added the chilis to the recipe, and sauted garlic and onion before adding to the beef mixture.  Make sure that the cream cheese is really spreadable, so that it won't tear the crust. Overall a great recipe and very easy...

Found this recipe to be rather bland.  I think more seasoning of some sort would help.

Another quick tasty meal that we enjoyed.  I added a small can of diced green chilis and definately more salsa than called for.  This doesn't make a ton of filling so I think you could certainly dream up many ways to add volume to it.  Some frozen corn would make a nice addition to this and using the whole can of beans also so you don't have the "what do I do with the rest of these beans" dilema.  Others suggested this and I wish I would of done it.  Using 8 oz. of cream cheese would also work.  This was good as is but a credit to the recipe for me is how versitile it is.  I'm sure kids would love this.  Many ways to plate this too....with sour cream, more salsa, lettuce, hot sauce, sliced tomatoes, etc. etc. I did use reduced fat crescents and ground turkey with no sacrifice in flavor.

My husband and 10 year old son both loved this.  I used 1 cup salsa, the full can of beans, and the full 8 oz. package of cream cheese.  I added some extra cheese which I stirred into the meat mixture after adding the beans.

Not bad.  Very easy to make.  Little cleanup involved.  
     I used 6 ounces of reduced fat cream cheese, about 2/3 cup salsa, and a whole can of refried black beans.  I sprayed the baking dish with PAM before laying down the crescent rolls.  I served it with a Mexican side salad.

I loved this recipe. I did make a few adjustments to fit out tastes.  Such as 2/3 cup of salsa, half of a large sweet onion while browning ground beef, onion chive cream cheese, a layer of pepper jack cheese on top of cream cheese and a layer of pickled jalapeno's on top of the pepper jack.

I almost gave this a 3 star rating. It was ok but needed some help. We followed the original recipe and I think it could have used some more meat and less taco seasoning. It could have benefited from some chopped tomato and lettuce on top too. It wasn't a bad start to a decent recipe though.

My kids loved this recipe and they are very picky eaters. I also used sour cream instead of cream cheese. It was good w/sour cream but next time I'll use cream cheese to see which one is the best. THANKS FOR SHARING!

I do love this combo but I use plain greek yogurt in place of the cream cheese (just a thin layer for some tang). I make my own refried beans and taco seasoning. I also put the crescent rolls on TOP instead of pre-baking as the bottom crust. After you cook and season the beef/bean mixture, throw on the layer of cream cheese, sour cream or yogurt, then lay the raw crescent dough on top and cook until golden brown for upside down pie.

Pretty good.  The crescent rolls didn't bake completely in the middle of the dish, so next time I'd prebake them for 5 or 10 minutes.  I didn't measure the cream cheese but used a block I had in a bag in the freezer so I'm not sure how much I used; probably 6 oz or so.  I also used the entire can of refried beans; I figured it couldn't hurt and I didn't want to have to figure out what to do with the rest of the beans.  This turned out to be pretty tasty and filling.  Thanks for the recipe!

Out of the mouth of my 5 year old son, "this is awesome!" Just like some of the others I tweaked it a bit. I baked the crescent rolls for about 8 minutes first, then spread cream cheese mixed with 1/4 cup cream cheese, and topped with beef mixture. I left off the beans only because I didn't have any. Easy & yummy!

Three stars from me, but the rest of the family (3 other family members) gave it a 4.  The two year old didn't care for it at all.  My only change was to use the entire can of beans.  It was easy and quick which fit the bill for the night, so I thank you for sharing your recipe!

What a surprise! Everyone here likes it.  My picky husband (who does most of the cooking, my 6 yr old and my 3 yr old!  Victory!  The only changes we made was to use sour cream instead of cream cheese and to cook the dough for 10 min on it's own and then add the sour cream and beef mixture.  Thank you!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I normally can't make anything without changing something, so for this I used ground turkey seasoned with oregano, garlic, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and sea salt/pepper.  I also used 8oz of low fat cream cheese and 7/8 of a can of beans instead.  I pre- baked the crescent roll for a few minutes and then added the toppings.  I topped with taco and mont-jack cheeses and then added a 2nd tube of crescent rolls on top.  I sprinkled a little cheese and chives on top and baked for 15 minutes and broiled for 3-4 to get the top brown.  It was a nice change from regular tacos.

Great recipe!  I made it in an 11x7 in pan and it had a nice thickness to it.  I served it with chopped tomatoes and chopped avocado along side of it and it was delicious!!  A keeper!

This was a good recipe. I loved it; my husband just thought it was okay. Instead of salsa, I used Rotel to give it more flavor. As with other reviewers, I used all of the cream cheese and refried beans.

Both the husband and the toddler LOVED it. I used lowfat crescent rolls, weight watchers cream cheese (8oz), a full 16oz can of refried beans and several types of leftover shredded cheese in various bags and it still turned out great. This would be great topped with black olives and/or green chilies but I used what I had on hand it and was fab!  I did cook the dough until set before adding any other ingredients. The cream cheese spread easily on the warm dough. Also, if you allow this to cool for a few minutes the beef/bean mixture will set and be less soupy... a must for me since I used more than double the beans called for in the recipe.

This was a great recipe for the whole family. My husband, who is very picky, loved it! We will definitely be having this on a regular basis.

This was so very tasty, & super easy. The preparation time was so fast. I made it in a 7x11 pan, & it worked out just fine. I cooked it till the crescent rolls were alittle on the dark side, & it made it almost like a crust. Very crispy.

My BF loved this, and my coworkers couldn't get enough of what the leftovers smelled like! I found the dough a little underdone in the side with the cream cheese, so would suggest baking the dish with just the crescent rolls for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Also, make sure the sream cheese is softened befor spreading it on. I did use almost the whole can of beans, and also topped with sour cream and black olives to serve. Delicious and easy to make.

Wow!  This was so much better than I even expected!  I used ground turkey instead of the beef, and used Pace brand taco seasoning mix, which seemed much better than Taco Bell or Old ElPaso.  I also used the full 8 oz cream cheese, and all but 2-3T or so of the refried beans, and probably close to 2 c shredded Mexican blend cheese on top.  Can't wait for this to join the rotation.  Simple to make, inexpensive ingredients and most importantly GOOD!!

This recipe is simple and a nice change from soft taco night.  I used Mama Renfro's Roasted Chipotle hot sauce for a great smokey flavor.  The 1 can of cresent rolls didn't exactly cover the entire dish, so I had to use two.  (Granted I didn't try too hard to make 1 can work) Next time I might attempt to use a deep dish pie pan.

Quick, tasty and inexpensive meal!  Like other reviewers, I used a full can of beans, 8oz of cream cheese, and about a cup of salsa.  Definately a repeat recipe, so thanks!

This was really good for a "package meal". I used Bill Echols' taco seasoning recipe from here and added in a little water and prepared the meat like I would for tacos then added the beans (1/2 can). This was a nice meal for a weeknight and was completed within an hour. My teen rated this lower than the rest of us, but only because as he said it is 92 outside and he was too hot for a hot meal. This is certainly worth serving again on a cool winter's day... The only improvement I could make with this is maybe adding a dollop of sour cream at the table. Yummy!

Very simple and tasty meal. Nice change from the regular mexican night! Like others, I made some changes. I used 1 1/2 cups of Thick N Chunky Salsa and the whole can of refried beans. I put the whole package of cream cheese (8oz) in the microwave to thin it out then spread it over the crescents. I followed the recipe by putting the beef/bean mixture on top. When I took the pie out to add cheese I added crushed Doritos as well. The Doritos added both flavor and crunchiness (is that a word?) Yummy, it's definetly a keeper!!!!

Really good & easy.  I used 1/2 can of refried beans (a little more than the recipe) and served with sour cream, salsa & olives to garnish.  The whole family liked it.

This was a very easy dish to put together.  The only thing I did different was to use the entire can of beans. It was also great for leftovers.

This was a winner for all in my house.  I used 1 whole can of refried beans along with 2/3 cup of salsa.  All the rest of the ingredients I kept the same.  When serving we topped our portions with cut up black olives, lettuce, tomato and of course sour cream!

Made this for the fam last night, it was fantastic.  I had some leftovers from our tacos the night before, so it was a perfect fit.
