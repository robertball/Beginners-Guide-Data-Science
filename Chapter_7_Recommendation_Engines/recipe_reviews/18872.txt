My aunt always makes this dish for Christmas get-togethers with the family, and we can't get enough of it!  I usually only do the grape jelly and the mustard, and I use those tiny weiners (lil' smokies) instead of the larger hot dogs, and it turns out great!  This is an easy and tasty appetizer to bring along to any party.  Just make sure to supply enough toothpicks for everyone to grab the small weenies with!

Fantastic! I was a little leary about the mustard and grape jelly, but it was so good.  I used Lil Smokeys instead of hot dogs.  Will definitely be making this again.

Very good!  It sounds strange to me to use grape jelly but it tastes great.  I added a little garlic powder and onion salt.  Also, I made it just for my family so I only used a quarter of the ingredients and cooked it on low on the stove for about 45 minutes.  I didn't want to drag out my big crock pot and it turned out fine.

This was an okay recipe. I think the hot dogs should have been sliced into bite sized pieces. Maybe this was intended in the recipe but it was not specified. The taste of the sauce was intense and I would not recommend it as anything but an appetizer. Overall, I was not highly impressed with this recipe.

I made this recipe last year & I'm getting ready to make it again. It wasn't only easy, but good! I love "beer weenies!" My husband liked them, too. Sometimes they're better when they've been refrigerated & re-heated.

this was a good recipe,  the flavor is what i'm used to. i think anyone who may have had problems came into it using regular hotdogs.  definitely use the little wieners.  the title of the recipe is slow cooker "wieners" but in the recipe is says hotdogs.  i see how most could be confused.  use the wieners, yumyum.

I didn't think the jelly and ketchup combo would be good, but it was.

I made this for a party and it was definitely the hit of the night. I was nervous about the jelly but it turned out great. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of garlic powder to the crock pot. Great recipe.

The kids loved them! I thought they were ok. The fault is using hotdogs, it was a texture thing. Next time I will use the little wiener things or smokies. Like I said, the kids loved them, the adults loved the sauce.

I made this for a kids birthday party & it was a great success. Left out the grape jelly as I don't think we can get that in Australia and replaced it with a bit of honey instead. Served with grilled onion & cheese on top. I think the adults enjoyed it more that the kids!

We use cocktail weiners (little smokies) and sometimes use red currant jelly in place of grape.  I also make them stovetop without the brown sugar and vinegar.

I used smoked weiners. Sauce came out tangy and sweet,  it's a perfect combination.  Perfect for brunch with the girls.

Made these using Lil' Smokies. Good taste, but the sauce is thin, and probably cook long enough to thicken.

sorry, we diddnt care for these. Maybe we overcooked them in the crockpot, not sure. Since overcooking in the crock is hard to do. But the taste just diddnt agree with us.

I made these for a party of teenage girls who shunned them for the frozen chicken tenders. What a shame - they were actually pretty good for hotdogs.  I used the little smokies.  I liked the fact that the recipe used mustard rather than the traditional ketchup or chili sauce.

Great potluck food. For extra goodness, add 1/2 cup bourbon whiskey, and a 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke. Stupendous! I cut the hot dogs into 1" pieces and reduced cooking time. When they begin to swell, they're ready.

Really enjoy this!! Made a few changes I used half of all ingredients plus added 1/2 cup honey barbeque sauce for that football game flavor.. It was fantastic an all guest enjoyed it.
