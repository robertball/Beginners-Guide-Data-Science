Pretty good...a different twist on pesto.  Next time I make it I think it will taste good with some lime juice added for a bit of a tang.

My friend Matt made this and recommends using another type of nut.  He topped chicken with the pesto and baked 1 hr. He reports the pecan tasted too strong for the first few bites, but ended up tasting OK.

Very  good.  I tried this and the second time, I used 1/4 c. mandarin oranges instead of the oil.  I drizzled the mandarin juice for consistency.  This recipe can be used with pecans, walnuts or pine nuts. Sometimes I use basil leaves instead of cilantro for a different taste. I used pesto on chicken breasts and also on pork chops.  My family loved it!  ENJOY !
