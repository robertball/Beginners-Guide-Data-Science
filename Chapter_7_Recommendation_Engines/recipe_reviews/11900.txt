I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, fresh spinach and a premade jar of sauce.  The lasagna came out beautiful and yummy.

I've made this recipe three times since I saw it online.  It was really easy.  Instead of making the sauce with sauce mix, tomato paste and tomato sauce you can use a can of spaghetti sauce.  Cottage cheese works just as well as the ricotta.  I also used fresh spinach because I did not have frozan on had- I stemmed the spanish first and tore off the stems.

This is very good lasagna.  I followed the instructions exactly, except I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce instead of an 8 oz can.  I can't imagine an 8 oz can would have been enough.  I cooked for the length instructed but the noodles were still a little tough.  The taste was great and the sauce was very rich and full of flavor.  I will definitely make this again but try cooking the noodles first.
**I have to add that this lasagna was 100 times better heated up the next day.  The sauce was tastier and the noodles more tender.

Overall, this recipe is very simple to make and pretty tasty.  I changed the recipe slightly to substitute store boughten pasta sauce for the first four ingredients because I prefer the flavor.  (For example, I chose a spicy roasted red pepper sauce to make mine more flavorful.)

I also made the slight addition to include cooked carrots in with the spinach ricotta mixture.

Overall, my only complaint was that it was not quite cheesy enough.  I wish the cheese to noodle ratio was a little bit higher.  Granted, I understand why the ratio is the way it is since ricotta comes in a pint size.  However, when I make it in the future I will probably add more fresh mozzarella cheese or perhaps some romano to make it four cheese lasagna.

However, overall it is a great, simple recipe.  It's also very easy to add in other veggies you like such as carrots, zucchini, bell peppers, etc.  But if you're a cheese lover like me, I would add in more cheese to make it even yummier.

Great lasagna. I used double the amount of cheeses called for and 2 boxes of spinach, along with more sauce. I used the Barilla jarred sauce and the no cook lasagna noodles. My husband loved it.

This is the first lasagna I ever made, and it turned out awesome! It came out of the oven a bit saggy in the middle, but no one cared at all. My fiance ate about a third of it by himself! I substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce w/ mushrooms since I wanted a few mushrooms and was too lazy to make my own sauce; I also added half a cup of romano and extra parmesan, since I crave cheesiness; and I added some basil, oregano, and parsley since it seemed appropriate. Just a great lasagna, and quick to make on top of that. Definitely making again when I need a lot of food and don't have a lot of time.

I like the flavour of the spinach in this dish. I used oven-ready lasagne noodles and it worked just as well. Quite yummy!

Great recipe.  I've been trying to learn to cook in the weight watchers world in which I have been thrust.  This was a great recipe.  I used fresh spinach leaves, a premade spaghetti sauce, cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and left out the mozzarella cheese.  We liked it better than traditional lasagna.  And it even has a vegetable in it!

Ok, I have to admit I changed a few things out of personal preference. First thing, I used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of mixing it up. I added some dried spices to it: basil, sage, garlic, onion powder, pepper, Italian, and then some diced up onion. I did not use ricotta, I used soft tofu (drain it well!) instead for less fat & extra protein. Mixed the tofu with shredded mozzarella & the spinach. (no parmesan, ricotta, or eggs). Layered and then sprinkled the top with extra mozzarella.   It's lasagna, so you can't really go wrong. I definitely recommend using tofu instead of ricotta!

Very good basic recipe.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce and a can of petite diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  Even my 4 year old who hates spinach loved it!

I used this recipe as a base for the cheese and spinach portion of the recipe.  I used my own homemade sauce.  I also added sausage I made.  I doubled the recipe and the amount was just right.  The cheese was creamy and delicious.  I used fresh spinach not frozen.  I let the lasagna sit for an hour then returned to the oven to reheat.  My slices came out neatly and held together well.  Next I will add some eggplant and skip the sausage.  Very easy and adaptable recipe.

I didn't love this.  It tasted strongly of spinach, which I liked, but it felt like there wasn't much of anything else going on.  I think it would benefit from some onions and mushrooms at the very least.

This was very tasty and I shared the finished product with our neighbors since it turned out so good!  I used my family's most favorite Barilla garlic flavor spaghetti sauce in place of plain tomato sauce, and the dish definitely didn't need any extra flavoring. I plan on making again with some healthy changes such as whole wheat lasagna noodels (if I can find any) and low fat cottage cheese in place of half the ricotta cheese.   YUm yum Yummmmm!

This is a tasty lasagna. I left out the eggs, actually, and used a pinch of oil instead; it was still very good. I also made a bescianella with butter/flour/milk/nutmeg. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Yummy!

This was the first lasagna I have ever made, and it turned out great! I used a 12 oz can of tomato sauce and added parsley,  basil, garlic, and oregano to the sauce-- it really added some great flavor! This is a good recipe for anyone who has never made one--simple, fast, tasty!

I had serious doubts about this recipe...I didn't think the noodles would cook.   I actually did mine all in a slow cooker on high, and in less than 1.5 hours it was perfect!!!  (Note: my slow cooker doesn't take long to heat up).  I admit I did change a lot of things.  Like others, I used canned basil spaghetti sauce, low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta (tried to strain it a little first - cottage cheese is more watery)...didn't add the parmesan (would've been better with it, but trying to make it more low fat) or mozzarella but instead put some sharp cheddar on the top only.  I think that's one of the best things about this recipe: it's versatile, and as long as you include the right amt of liquids, it will turn out beautifully!

Since I cut out some of the flavor with the cheese, I added Italian dried spices to the spinach mixture.

Awesome.  Why go for take-out when this is so easy?  Will definitely use this recipe again.  So convenient when there's no time for "fussy" lasagna.

Super easy and super good!  I used a jar of pasta sauce in place of spaghetti sauce mix/tomato pasta/sauce/water.  Also used fat free ricotta since it's what I had at the time and it was still delish.

I made some changes to make it easier on myself.   I used a large jar of spaghetti sauce instead of "making" it using the first 4 ingredients.   I also used the nobake lasagna noodles to save time.   It turned out great, even for my meat lovers in the family!!

It was easy. Relatively fast. And very delicious. It's easy to customize.

My husband who claims he doesn't like lasagna was able to eat some nice sized portions.

I really enjoyed it. It's a shame I'm doing the diet thing because I could only eat a very small part.

But it's a great recipe.

This recipe was very easy and quick. I along with others used a pasta sauce instead of the paste & sauce mix. It turned out perfect and tasted great! I will make this many more times in the future.

This came out perfect! I was skeptical about baking the lasagna without boiling the pasta first, but it worked great! Like many others, I used sauce from a jar - I needed a little more than one jar, and I also added a couple tablespoons of water to be safe. I also put mushrooms in, which release water when they cook. After an hour of cooking, the pasta was still a bit hard in the middle, but I just let it sit covered and it finished cooking on its own, yet didn't get mushy. Easiest lasagna ever!

Excellent recipe! I made a couple changes: I used 1 jar of meatless spaghetti sauce, added in chopped mushrooms and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes to the sauce to make it more hearty. I also omitted the salt in the recipe. I also used more mozzarella cheese than called for (another 8 oz). Probably need to cook a smidge longer than 1 hour if you are using oven-ready (no-bake) lasagna noodles.
Can't wait to make again - I didn't miss the meat at all!

This recipe was very easy to make. We have made it twice and both times it turned out good. I gave 4 stars because the flavor could use a little zing but I had no complaints. I substituted egg beaters and used light ricotta the second time and it tasted just as good as it did the first time. This is a good recipe to use to add and subtract what you like. I would definitely recommend this for kids or a big family it is filling.

This was the first time I've not cooked my noodles, and I am so happy with the results, I'll probably never cook them first again!  Just use more sauce than you would with precooked noodles.  Awesome!

I used spaghetti sauce and no-boil lasagna noodles. Change nothing else. Cheese amount is just right for me because cheese doesn't overpower the taste of spinach.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I made it with whole wheat lasagna noodles to add more nutrients, so it had to bake a little longer.  My vegetarian friends loved it!!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious!  So easy to make!  I used "oven ready" lasagna, just to ease my mind.  Next time I think I will use a jar sauce only because I can choose different flavors.  It looked very impressive coming out of the oven.  I great vegetarian option.

Quick and simple! It's very hard to go wrong with this one :) Made this for my honey after a hard day's work, and he loved it (ate two huge slices!).  Few things I changed: -Added zucchini on each layer (thin slices) for added crunch. I think adding some mushrooms would be good too! - Used a jar of basil spaghetti sauce instead of dealing with the tomato paste + sauce step.

I really liked this lasagna.  The first time I made it I used a 26oz jar of prepared pasta sauce and felt that I should have used more.  The lasagna noodles were not as soft as I like them.  Still good, but not perfect!

The next time I used 1 1/2 jars of the pasta sauce.  I put 1 cup of the sauce at the bottom.  Also, after assembling the lasagna, I put a little bit of the water (about 1/2 cup) around the sides of the lasagna.  

This time the noodles came out soft like I like them and the amount of sauce was perfect.  Loved it!

Please note that I used regular lasagna noodles and not the 'no-boil' kind.  Not sure which one the recipe calls for.

This recipe is great! I loved it and definitely didn't miss the meat. This was my first lasagna and it was delicious. I used frozen lasagna and used the tip from here to squeeze it between the back of two plates to drain.

Wonderful recipe.   It was quick and easy to make with great results.   I did make my own pasta sauce rather than use a packet, but otherwise that was the only change.   I think next time I may remove the foil the last 15 minutes, just to brown up the cheese a bit.

This lasagna was absolutely delicious, but like most recipes, it's a better base-concept than word-for-word.  I made this with whole-wheat noodles for extra nutrition and they didn't hinder the taste or tenderness at all.  The sauce is much better if you use a typical jar of spaghetti sauce, or if you season the tomato sauce/paste yourself with whatever herbs/spices you like, and maybe some shredded carrot. Obviously, adding meat to the sauce is an easy tweak and it doesn't hurt the ratio of the dish one bit!  I used fresh spinach (about two generous cups loosely packed and mixed into the ricotta/egg mixture.)  Also, this is FANTASTIC if you slice up some brown mushrooms nice and thin and layer them between the ricotta and the sauce.

This recipe was great.  I made a few changes though.  I made a vodka vegetable sauce, sauteed onions, then grilled red peppers, mushrooms and zucinni in olive oil.  I added a call of crushed tomato's and 1/4 cup of vodka and 1/4 cup of light cream with salt, oregano, basil and garlic.  I mixed the ricotta with the spinach (fresh) and 1 egg and 1/2 tsp salt, no cheese.  But then when i layered, I put a layer of parm cheese in between the ricotta mix and the sauce.  It was excellent.

This is a super easy and delicious lasagna. I took other reviewers' advice and used a jar of tomato sauce in place of the packaged sauce and water. I still used the can of paste, though, to thicken the sauce slightly. Next time I will add some more mozzarella, and perhaps another layer of pasta on top so it looks more like the photo. I'll definitely make this again, and look forward to experimenting with different vegetables.

I liked it, but found the spinach to be a little over powering. I think next time I'll try fresh spinach and/or significantly less. I mixed ricotta cheese and cottage cheese to make it a 4 cheese lasagne. (with parmesan and Mozzerella on top)

I followed the recipe as it is. I only ended up adding some Italian seasoning and garlic to the tomato sauce.  After an hour of baking under foil, I broiled it for 10 minutes in order to get a nice crispy cheese crust on top. Next time will add bread crumbs and maybe pine nuts on top.  It came out great! I would definitely make it again.

This was a great hit in my home. I used jar spagetti sauce. I also used fresh and frozen spinach. I used half ricotta and half cottage cheese. I also used whole wheat noodles. I only used one egg, I added fresh mushrooms, diced garlic and diced green onions to the mixture, When I combined the cheese misture, I also added fresh parsley. WE NEVER MISSED THE MEAT! MY husband loved this dish. I added garlic bread and a salad. Great meal.

I give this four stars because I changed the recipe, but I would give it 5 with the changes. This is great for being a low-calorie lasagna. I used tomato basil bottled spaghetti sauce (who uses spaghetti sauce packets??) and subbed one cup of parmesan for one cup of the mozzarella. I also threw in two cloves of garlic, some black pepper, and half a diced onion. Next time I will use fresh spinach, and sautee it with the onion and garlic before adding it to the cheese. For ease and convenience though, can't beat this recipe!

This was a great family meal. Good way to introduce spinach into our maeals without the kids picking at it. The leftovers were also great. I followed the directions but added an 12oz can of tomato sauce like someone else sugggested. Still not enough sauce for my liking, but good enough to enjoy with my family. I will defintley make it again.

I started with this recipe because I wanted to make an all veggie one for my family.  But I added sauteed zucchini w/garlic cloves, broccoli, carrots and tripled the cheese and doubled the jar sauce.  It was a hit!  Use your imagination when adding veggies.  The basic recipe was good but needed more for our family's tastebuds.

Excellent recipe.  Will definitely make again.  I made with whole wheat lasagna noodles to keep it on the healthy side and no one in my family even noticed.  Thanks so much for an excellent meal.

This was very, very good. I used fresh spinach, and I guess I didn't chop the spinach enough because some pieces were quite large.  That kind of took away from the overall dish, but the flavor and taste was excellent.

Next time, I will chop my spinach a few more times. I prefer to use fresh spinach over frozen.

Deilicious! I added a tbsp. minced garlic and 1/2 cup chopped white onion for flavor (sauteed in butter until the onion is soft)-I think it might have been bland without it. My husband loved it, and he's usually skeptical abuot meatless entrees! Try this one-it's great!

I'm not even sure what spaghetti sauce mix is, but whatever it may be, it sounds like something processed that's coming from a package. I used a good jarred sauce along with a lot of seasonings, as this would have otherwise been quite bland. Good base recipe that you can certainly play around with. Thank you.

This is so simple and delicious....I made some revisions to the recipes such as adding more Mozzarella cheese, along with additional lasagne noodles (no bake type); some red pepper flakes; a lot of garlic..hmmm.. Also, after the hour of baking I removed the aluminum wrap placing it under the broiler adding crispiness to the top.  GREAT...

This is an excellent recipe.  I have been using it for years.  I got it out of a cookbook called the Active Woman's cookbook.  It gives the option of 8 ozs. of Ricotta or 8 ozs. of cottage cheese.  I always use cottage cheese, and make everything exactly as the book says.  If you use frozen spinach, like it suggests, you squeeze as much of the water out as you can.  The water though, is what helps the noodles cook in the oven.  

Try it, you'll like it!

Good recipe, but next time I make it I'll change a few things.  I'll probably use cottage cheese rather than ricotta and add lots of other veggies like mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers (red ones for color!), and it might even be good with artichokes.  You could pre-cook the noodles to minimize cook time.  I'm also glad I waited the 10 minutes before serving to let it solidify a bit.  The sauce was really good as the recipe described, but I would use a jar if I was trying to make it quickly.

Delicious! Used jarred sauce, and boiled the noodles first.  I haven't been brave enough yet to make a lasagna with dry ones.  It did cut the baking time, though, which my kids appreciated!  Just smelling this cooking will make you wish an hour was shorter!

I usually always make the recipe exactly as is. I did add 2 precooked chicken breast(cut up) to the spinach mixture and added a clove of garlic.  I really enjoyed it as did my 2 year old....whom loves anything with tomato sauce. This was fairly easy and a change from things I usually make.  I think that it is a good basic recipe and will be making again someday.

Excellent recipe!  Even our picky 14-month-old loved it!  We used jarred sauce and added sliced zucchini to the layers as well.  Definitely something I'd like to make again--maybe with mushrooms too?  I thawed the frozen chopped spinach until it was in small pieces but didn't need to drain it.

This was my first time making Spinach Lasagna and I thought it was delicious.  I had bought shredded Mozzarella by mistake, so that may have not made it as cheesy for me as I would have preferred.  I used a Spaghetti Sauce Mix that said was thick and zesty and added that to the sauce ingredients.  I used tomato paste and the sauce with no salt added.  After it was all in the pan, I added about 1 1/4 cups of water around the sides to make the noodles softer.  I then extended the cooking time another 15 minutes.  I would have preferred more Mozzarella cheese and some oregano to spice it up a little.  Overall, I thought it was quite good and will make it again.

Added 1lb extra-lean ground beef, 1/2-cup chopped onions, 3-tbsps fresh-cut parsley, and 2 fresh-ground garlic cloves to 20 oz of pre-made spaghetti sauce, left out the parmesean, and it was great!  I'm sure had I actually followed the recipe, it would've been good, too.  I used all fat-free cheese, and it still tasted great.

This may have been one of the best lasagnas I'ver ever eaten.  It might have been that my wife made it, or that I was particulary ravenous for lasagna when I ate it, but I loved this lasagna.

The recipie was fast, easy and very tasty! I decided to use spagehtti sauce instead of making your own, also i cooked the noodles prior. I would recommend using more ricotta cheese and adding some motzerella cheese for the top of the lasagna! Excellent!

Very good. I used a jar of sauce and no-bake noodles. Even my ricotta-hating husband liked this one. Simple and delicious; we'll definitely be making this again.

This is the very best Spinach Lasagna recipe I've ever tasted!  I don't normally like spinach, but even using the full amount the recipe calls for, is not overwhelming to those that dislike the flavor and/or texture of spinach!  I always use 'oven-ready' noodles, as they seem to cook the best in most recipes that call for baking noodles.  This recipe also freezes very well, up to 6 months.

Not bad.  I used jarred tomato & basil sauce in place of the first 4 ingredients, a cheese mix instead of mozzarella, and whole wheat rotini instead of lasagna noodles.  I pre-cooked the rotini, carmelized some minced onion and mixed it all together like ziti.  I then figured it needed some spice, so I added italian seasoning, cumin and a dash of cayenne.  That really helped add some flavour.  Otherwise I think it would have been pretty bland.  Not noteworthy, but good overall.

Very tasty and easy to make. There were a few extra steps that I think were omited (such as cooking the noodles). I also think the recipe could use a little bit more water to moisten it up a bit. Overall very good though!

For those of you who are Spatini spaghetti sauce fans, you are probably upset that you can no longer find it, as I used it exclusively for this recipe and always thought it "made" this lasagna dish. This is such an awesome meatless lasagna and I have made it SO many times and people ask me for the recipe. I substituted McCormick's Salsa mix instead and it is not bad, though not Spatini. HAS ANYONE FOUND A SUBSTITUTE FOR SPATINI???? I am disappointed they are no longer making it.

Good and very easy to make. The only drawback was it needed a bit more spiciness. I made two of them, to one of them I added italian sausage to the sauce....worked well.

First rate!  This was fast and delicious.  I used what I had on hand: a jar of spaghetti sauce mixed with a couple of tablespoons of water instead of the paste, sauce mix and tomato sauce; light ricotta cheese mixed with light cottage cheese and monterrey jack instead of mozza.  Substitutions worked great and held together nicely.  Thanks Jolene, this is a keeper!

Really easy basic recipe. Of course I doubled the cheese layer ingredients because we are a family of cheese sluts lol. I used two jars of my favorite store bought sauce and added in a couple of cups of chopped broccoli (frozen) for a little added texture. 

Another tip I picked up from previous adventures is to add 1/4-1/2 cup of water around the edges of the pan before you put it in the oven to make sure the noodles are fully cooked through. 

Came out great!! I am definitely making this again.

My son and I really liked this spinach  lasagna. It is simple, which is a big plus for me. I made substitutions out of necessity, which made it even simpler, and it still turned out yummy!
I used: No parmesan, No spaghetti sauce mix, No water.
For the tomato sauce: I used: about 1 & half, 15 oz canned tomato sauce.(the basic stuff)
Ricotta (as in recipe) & the Shredded Mozzarella as called for, and... I used it in place of the bit of parmesan too, ...I didn't add extra cheese, but I think that would be good as well.)
I also used only approx. 60% of the spinach (which I am very glad I went slow in adding it in, because it indeed has a strong spinach-taste  especially at first, definitely a spinach-lasagna).
About 3/4 the way into cooking, I added a pinch each: dried oregano, dried thyme, dried basil , sprinkled on top. 
All in all, is tasty spinach lasagne. My 17 y.o. son, who doesn't like veggies, and I each had extra servings.

This was very easy and went together quickly. Like others I used my favorite jar pasta sauce and I eliminated the eggs for my vegetarian daughter. You can do the cheese filling without eggs but I prefer it with. I also opted for fresh spinach which works out just great and layered it instead of mixing into cheese mix. I used no bake lasagna noodles and extra sauce. All in all a good recipe.

I gave it three stars because 1/2 my family didn't like it, and the other half did.  I personally thought this was a very good receipe.  My husband needs meat in his lasagna and my one daughter thought the spinach was overpowering.  I thought it was delicious.

This was a big hit with our family tonight! I used store bought pasta sauce and was a bit more generous with the mozzarella cheese, but found this to be a great base recipe.  My four kids and husband all loved it! All but one of us had seconds. I am sure the leftovers (what few are left) will be quite tasty tomorrow.  Next time I plan to make two and put one in the freezer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! My 11 year old son ate 2 helpings for dinner the first night and single handedly finished off the leftovers the next night! We used 2 jars of sauce instead of fiddling with the packet/water/dried sauce mixture and it turned out perfect. I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta and sauteed the spinach with a small diced onion and 3 minced garlic cloves. Definitely a new favorite in this home! Thanks for sharing!

We made this for guests tonight and even our kids liked it!

We also used a jar of prepared spaghetti sauce, which made it easier and I used grated mozzarella cheese. It tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made several times and is very good. I like to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I also add a can of mushrooms and some shredded carrot.

I made a couple of days ago for my family...and it's gone! I did use my own sauce and doubled the cheese amounts because we like a lot of cheese..I also added 1 pound of sweet italian sausage.  Used the "no boil" lasagna noodles..sooo easy!  Will make again and agin...

Pretty good! I used fresh spinach and onions instead of frozen. I sauteed them in olive oil. I also omitted the sauce mix and water.(I had to use what I had in the kitchen)It's really good if you sprinkle some basil on the top. I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was SO EASY.  The results were perfect, flavorful, and almost good enough for my young son to eat spinach!  After he picked out all of the spinach, he told us how good it was.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks.  Oh, I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead, which made it very fast.

This lasagna was so quick and simple to make.  I used one large jar of Ragu spaghetti instead of making the sauce.  It was prepared in less than 10 munutes.  My family loved it.

After reading all the raves, I was expecting this to be great and was very disappointed.  My husband said it tasted like a healthy choice/ diet lasagna.  I thought it tasted salty.  Maybe a different sauce?  If I were to make it again, which I won't, I would use a mushroom jarred sauce.

I was looking for a healthier version so I replaced the noodles with sliced zucchini.  It was so good!  You really don't miss the noodles at all.  I also used ricotta rather than cottage cheese.  And using lower fat cheese make this so guilt free!

First time making it: Good dish as is. Second time making it: Amazing!! Not sure what the tomato paste and sauce are for, if you use your favorite spaghetti sauce it works great with more seasonings. Used fresh spinach and sliced mushrooms as personal preference. Also added 4 cloves of garlic to the ricotta. Hubby loved it!

Gluten-free, egg-free version (using Ener-G Egg Replacer and Jovial lasagna noodles) turns out great (and I just use 1 jar of Classico spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce, tomato paste, and sauce mix).

I used the ricotta cheese. Also, I replaced the tomato sauce with a basic store brand and added a little garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Came out well.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. However, I chopped & fried spicy Italian sausages, added home made (previously frozen) tomato sauce (made from roasting tomatoes from our garden). I also used steemed beet greens instead of spinach. Next time I'll add sautéed onions, garlic & mushrooms. Good recipe, thank you.

This is the same recipe I've been using for years!   A tip to help the noodles cook: break them in half of thirds.  This allows the liquid to seep in and cook the noodles through.

Tastiest lasagna I've had in a while! We chose to add 1/2 lb of italian sausage and 1/2 lb of ground beef- browned in pot before adding to sauce. Very moist and cheesy dinner!

I used 1 1/2 jars of Ragu, cottage cheese instead of ricotta and only 6 noodles.  I made 3 layers (2 noodles/layer) and baked in 11x7 dish.  Delicious!!

I love spinach lasagna, and this was very good. I added some extra sauce because I like it that way. My guests cleared their plates!
