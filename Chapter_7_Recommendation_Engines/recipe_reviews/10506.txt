These are a bit more like a biscotti than a cookie because they are so dry.  I reduced the amount of vanilla extract to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract.  I think the peppermint might be the only thing that saved the cookie.  A few came out of the press okay, but most of them I had to peel off the press.  I commend you for a valiant effort.  I may make them now and then, but I will shape them as a biscotti and dunk them in coffee.
