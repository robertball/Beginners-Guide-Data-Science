As a culinary student I am always looking for good recipes to try. I must say this is by far the best recipe I've found for spare ribs! I did do a few things different though, I did not boil the ribs before browning them. I found that it was not needed. I did also add a little more Worcestershire sauce and beef stock to add a little more flavor. Other than that this is an awesome recipe! TRY IT!

I didn't boil the ribs in water, but did brown them with garlic olive oil. I transfered all of that to a slow cooker. Next I made the sauce but I added two tablespoons of horseradish and 1/2 cup red wine. I let it cook on high for 4 hours. It was delicious. I'm saving the extra sauce to add beef and mushrooms to serve over noodles.

This came out good!  I had some spareribs and NO clue how to cook them, so here comes AR ;)  The combination of ingredients (and the fact that it's unrated) worried me a little, but I went with it and I'm very pleasantly surprised!  I generally don't like nutmeg in savory dishes, but after the long cooking time, you can't pick it out amongst the other ingredients - everything blends nicely so that you can't pick out any one flavor.  Very good recipe, thanks!

I made these for my family, and they came out delicious! The only thing I changed was that after boiling them, I baked them at 250 degrees for 2 hours covered then 300 for an hour then the last 45 mins, I uncovered and baked at 350. They fell off the bone. Even my picky six year old loved them.

This is a 5-star pork rib recipe.  I made the sauce exactly w/ no modifications, and followed Staschy's general method for cooking and the ribs fell off the bone in wonderful tenderness when done.  Here's how:  boiled the ribs in large pot of water 45 minutes.  Made sauce exactly in dutch oven.  Didn't brown the ribs, just put them directly in with sauce once sauce was made.  Put lid on dutch oven, cooked 2 hours covered at 250, 1 hour covered at 300, 45 minutes uncovered at 350.  The ribs fell off bone as took them out with tongs, had to use a spatula to support underneath to get the rack on a plate w/o meat falling off further.  The sauce is a wonderful, rich, vinegar-based sauce.  It was effortless to separate the meat from bone, shredded it, then plunged eat bite into the sauce before eating.  My 9-y.o. daughter said she could literally eat this dish every meal for the rest of her life.  :-)   I would pay good money at a restaurant for ribs this delicious, tender and tasty.  Make them this way and you'll say the same.

Awesome shortribs! Super moist and great flavor.  I did not have beef broth, so I used vegetable broth.  I cooked them at 250 for 3 hrs and 320 for 45 min.

I read the recipe wrong... and thought the SLOW-Cook said SLOW-COOKER so I used the slow cooker.  Worked perfectly!  I never boil my ribs first as the flavour comes out into the water (thats why you boil vegetables and meat in water to make soup!).  I just browned these quickly and threw into the slow-cooker.  I made up the sauce as listed PLUS some garlic and poured it in.  Turned it on HIGH for 6 hours, but they were perfect after only 4.

I am only rating this a 4 because we thought the sauce was a little bland.  When I make it again, I will use more brown sugar.  

My kids thought it was a little plain as well, so I zipped up some honey garlic sauce, coated the ribs and placed in the oven to get all sticky. The base flavour from the original recipe made these just wonderful!  (which is what I am rating).  The addition of honey garlic sauce to that already base flavour made it a 5 star in our house!  Thanks for this recipe!

Go ahead and let this cook in your slow cooker all day for a perfect dinner when you get home!

My family loved this! I always try to use fresh ingredients, so I used a whole onion that I minced and fresh squeezed lemon. I almost didn't try this one because of the picture. I cooked em overnight in my slow cooker. The sauce was thick and dark...just like the restaurants! My 11 year old daughter always orders ribs and she said these were the best she ever had. My picky husband said to save this one and make it every weekend :) I don't eat meat, but this smelled so good cooking. This is a must try recipe! ENJOY!

Flavor was good, not overpowering at all.  Spareribs were pretty tender, too.  Husband really liked them!

I had a 1/2 rack of baby back ribs in my freezer. I was looking for a different way to make them and came across this. It is very good! Next time I'm going to try it with spare ribs or St. Louis ribs. I didn't boil the ribs, just browned them. I minced a small onion instead of the dried onion. The ingredient list looks odd but it all comes together very deliciously! I'll make this again!

Perfect as written.  To save time, I broiled ribs to brown.  Did skip boiling.  Threw in roasting pan with sauce, and followed the suggestion for 2 hrs at 250 degrees, 1 hr at 300 degrees and 45 mins at 350 degrees.  Tender  and flavorful.  My rib officienado gave it 5 stars.

I used beef spare ribs; 1/2 veg broth and 1/2 red wine, and no seafood seasoning. Instead of minced onion I cut up onion rings and added that. I only browned, not boiled the ribs. It took only 3 hours in slow cooker.

I just tried this recipe today and was very good.  I had baby back ribs that I wanted to just cook over stove top so I tried this recipe.  I did not boil the ribs; I removed all visible fat, sprinkled chinese five spices then browned them and followed the recipe without the seafood seasoning and nutmeg. After 1 1/2 hours, it was done.  Sauce was thick and very good. I will definitely do this again.

We didn't boil the ribs, but followed the rest of the instructions, and it turned out great.  The extra sauce made an excellent gravy for mashed potatoes.

Amazing!  First, I loved the title, "Sunday afternoon..."  I had beef ribs instead of pork, I think either one would of been just fine.  I only had half a lemon, so after squeezing out the juice, I through the rest of lemon in with sauce and ribs.
This dish barley made it to the table, the smell throughout the house was epic!

This was just so GOOD, The only thing I changed was the dried minced onion. I didn't have any so I just minced a small amount of a fresh onion. It all came out PERFECT and so TENDER !! I will be making this again for sure !!!!

Had a large slab of ribs, so I doubled the sauce recipe  (but kept the same amount of broth).  Substituted Frank's Red Hot for half of the ketchup for an extra kick.  Browned in garlic and oil and then put in crock pot on low for 5 hours (skipped the boiling).  Loved it!

Meh. I got excited about this recipe, given all the rave reviews. And I did boil it first, but I think that gave it a funny smell that simmering in sauce didn't completely get rid of. My quest for delicious, yet not completely artery-clogging, ribs continues . . .

I used the recipe for just the sauce, nice flavor, a little too much Worcestershire sauce (I would use half that amount) and a little too sweet. The nutmeg was fine. I added 2 Tablespoons of cornstarch to make it thicker. I will make it again.

Excellent flavor!  I used boneless pork ribs and wasn't sure how to adjust the cooking time so mine ended up a bit dry.  The juices helped a lot.  I boiled them for 40 minutes, pan seared for about 5 minutes each side and then put them into my crockpot on low for 2 1/2 hours.  My family, including my kids, loved it!

This was a hit!!  I boiled the meat for 1/2 half & browned it!!  Preheated oven, about 300.  When I made the sauce, I replaced brown sugar w honey, it was excellent  I baked for about 2hrs!!  Great football Sunday dish!!

This made some amazing ribs.  I didn't have the seafood seasoning, but added a few that would be in it. Also, I seared the ribs and then put everything in the crockpot for a few hours. The house smelled wonderful and made a great dinner with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies.

This recipes was so good! I made it about three weeks ago and I'm making it again tomorrow! I followed the recipe to a tee and it was the best thing I've ever tasted. I love pork and this falls apart which is heaven. Thank you for this recipe! It is a keeper!

I used this recipe for lamb ribs. Very easy and tasty, served with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. Doesn't get five stars because the ribs are a bit too greasy due to them cooking in the dissolved fat for 3 hours. That may be becasue I used lamb.  Great dish to prepare during football season if the tv is close to the kitchen!

I put the ribs in the pot to boil frozen and then started timing the boiling, so they didn't boil a full hour.  I also added a little red wine to the sauce.  I did everything else exactly as directed.  I had never cooked ribs before.  They turned out great!

Outstanding!!!! Only deviation was didn't boil ribs and used apple cider vinegar.  Can't wait to make for my entire gang.  Totally worth the effort.  Did the 2 hrs. at 250, 1 hr. at 300 and 45 min. at 350.  Perfect!!!

I had these for dinner last night and the family rated it a 5 star, so did I. Very good blend of flavors.
I didn't boil before browning. They turned out very tender. These are excellent! Thanks for this recipe.

OMG, did all that this recipe said w/two minor changes; boiled only (didn't brown) and didn't have enough beef stock so added red wine to make up difference.  SO DELISH and love how meat just fell off the bones.  Would make this every weekend if it could.  Hubby and son loved it.  Sauce was nice to put over egg noodles too.  Must try!

This is great recipe. The only thing I changed was I added honey  to the sauce, cooked it on high in a crockpot for Two hours and then on low for another 4 hours and added sliced onion in the crockpot. Very very good!

I followed this recipe and made it in my dutch oven exactly how this recipe is written. I did not add or exclude anything, including boiling them (although I was really skeptical). They turned out amazing, and as stated totally fall off the bone! 
I will forever use this recipe. Thank you

Meat was tender but not as tasty as I would have preferred. This is probably because I didn’t boil the fat off first so it must have added too much liquid while cooking. Also, I did not brown them. Lazy!! Will do that next time. I’m sure the flavor dynamic will change if I follow the recipe better.

Very tasty! We were quite impressed how good this sauce smelled AND tasted. I made with boneless country style pork ribs, and I like using oven with Dutch oven, so I baked as others reviewed.  As the lid was off, you could SEE when that juice got absorbed and they LOOKED done.  Paired with some great mashed potatoes for the juice. Keeper!

Good recipe! I personally think they could use some kind of sauce on them. I’m one of those people who loves to eat ribs and have sauce all over your face!

This is one of the BEST recipes I've made on here! I'd give it 10 stars!! Followed the recipe except I cooked in oven covered at 250 for 2 hours and then uncovered at 300 for 45 minutes! FANTASTIC!!

I've made this recipe twice. Both times the meat was tender and tasty. I did not use seafood seasoning or red pepper flakes,  simply because I don't like too much spice or heat. (Personal preference) I found that the flavor from the beef broth overpowered the meat, so i used chicken broth the second time.  This will be my go-to rib recipe from now on!

I mixed two batches of sauce: one with beef broth and one without. I put 2 racks of ribs in 10x15 baking dish and covered with beef broth mixture over ribs. Cover tightly with foil and baked at 300 for 2 1/2 - 3 hours until tender. I removed ribs from pan and allowed to sit for 15 minutes to dry. I then coated ribs with remaining sauce (made without beef broth) and placed over charcoal grill. Flip every 15 minutes, coating with sauce each time. Grill for 45 minutes with lid closed. DELISH!!!!

I added raw honey and I think it really brought the taste alive. Meat was really tender. Loved this recipe. Served with potatoes cut with butter poured over. UM!

I wasn't sure if this was a slow-cooker recipe or oven. I poured all the ingredients except for the oil in my slow-cooker and raw ribs, mixed them a bit. I cooked them in low for 7 hours. Delicious!!!!! Will be making them again soon!

This is a keeper!  I omitted the boiling as one reviewer suggested and simmered it for 3 hours.  The meat fell off the bone.  I definitely will make this again.

I made  a couple of changes. I used beef spare ribs. I doubled the batch of sauce because of the amount of ribs used, 3.72 lbs.  I did not double the vinegar though and I boiled the ribs first which cut off an hour of simmering time at the end of the recipe and  oh my goodness it was the best. I will definitely be making  this again and again.

These were very good.  I didn't have old bay spice or nutmeg, but they still turned out good.  I left them in the crock pot for 6 hours and there was no trace of meat still left on the bone.  The sauce was quite watery, so next time I would take the time to thicken the sauce to pour over the ribs.  They had just a little zing to them.

These ribs are a favorite at my house.  My husband has asked for them repeatedly.
