This is the best fish I have ever had.  I didn't use measurements, but I used extra virgin olive oil as my base and to that I added old bay seasoning, garlic powder, seasoned salt and dry parsley flakes. I brushed that on my tilapia and placed a lemon slice on each fish and then squeezed fresh lemon juice on top and baked covered at 350 for 25 minutes.

I made this tonight. It was great. I used frozen tilapia and it needed about 5 more minutes.  I used a frozen stir-fry veggie mix...next time I will add it with only 20 minutes left because th veggies were overdone.  Instead of dotted butter, I melted butter and added lemon juice, garlic & onion powder, parsley, old bay, and pepper.  I drizzled this over the fish.  The last 10 minutes, I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  It was great.  Next time I'll top it was parmesan cheese. Thanks so much. This is a great recipe that you can really experiment with.

This dish came out great but I am giving it only four stars because it's one of those that everybody changes to his own liking.  The basic idea, Tilapia with Old Bay Spice is a great one, though.  For my dinner, I melted about 3 tbs of butter and added lots more of Old Bay along with some lemon juice, which I drizzled over the fish.  Then I  topped the fish with  freshly chopped garlic, scallions and ground pepper.  Before serving, I poured the resulting sauce from the pan over the fish and rice - this came out really really nicely!

Very good recipe! I layered my 9x13 w/ some uncooked white rice & cream of mushroom soup, and cooked the fish on top.  Also added bread crumbs -- made it a little crunchy. Great taste, really fast to make and extremely easy!

Wonderfully easy recipe with very nice results!  I would like to give it a 4.5-star rating.  I recommend two changes to the recipe: 1. instead of lemon slices, drizzle freshly-squeezed lemon juice over the fish (and over your choice of fresh or frozen vegetables); 2. add an additonal spice/herb to the Old Bay and garlic salt, in order to zip up the flavor...which otherwise will be on the bland side.  I will make this dish again, and add paprika.  Tilapia is a delightful fish:  versatile, affordable, and delicious.  This is a great recipe to get more seafood into your diet without fuss. It is also a lean and healthy recipe.

I normally can't stand  the sight or smell of fish, let alone the taste. However, my girlfriend loves it. I decided to surprise her because she has always said that if I were to cook fish that it would taste better than in restaurants. Well, I had no clue how to start, so I used this recipe as a base and it was amazing. The differences I made were that I added lime juice instead of lemon slices, and that I added garlic powder, salt, black pepper, cayun, and a little bit of bread crumbs. I then served it with garlic mashed potatoes and wild rice. This recipe is now my favorite and easiest to make.

Very easy, flavorful, and cost-friendly!  This would be a good dish for someone who is either new to eating fish, or is not usually a fish lover,  as tilapia is very mild.  For those of us who love fish, it's very good.

I took suggestions from other reviews and made the following small changes:  used frozen but slightly thawed fish and veggies, coated the fish with just a little olive oil and butter, added fresh garlic, and used recommended spices liberally and added a couple of other spices as well.  Lastly, I sprinkled bread crumbs on the fish for the last ten minutes of cooking, and left the dish uncovered for that length of time as well.  Very tasty.

For all those who have a giant spice cabinet, but not the Old bay seasoning, here are the ingredients in Old Bay Seasoning: Celery Salt, Ground Mustard, Red Pepper, Black Pepper, Bay Leaves, Cloves, Allspice, Ginger, Mace, Cardamom, Cinnamon, and Paprika.
Just a little pinch of each and voila you dont have to go to the store to buy something special :)!

I'd strongly recommend thawing the frozen vegetables before baking.  I did not do this, and I has to add almost fifteen minutes to the cooking time.  Even then, the fish, while done, was just  barely warm.  I still tasted great, though.

Liberal use of spices is definitely key.  I also used Smart Balance spray, instead of butter and it worked well.  My frozen vegetable of choice was a 16 oz bag of broccoli stir fry.  Semi-thawing of the frozen vegetable should speed up the process as it took 45 minutes, rather than 30 to fully heat through the vegetables.  I put the vegetables on top of the fish, then sprinkled vegetables with spray butter and all the spices noted on the recipe and by others.  I toasted leftover french bread and crumbled it on top, spraying all again with the spray butter.  I took the cover off the dish the last 15 minutes of cooking time to crisp up the fish a bit.  My husband said it was "delicious".  Without the added spicing and spray butter, it would be more bland than I would prefer.  Overall, the dish is easy to prepare.

I've used this recipe for about 2 years and it's always a satisfying, low fat meal you can feel good about serving.  It's very versatile - as other reviews have indicated.  You can use fresh veggies or frozen (thaw first). When you cover it, the moisture from the veggies "steams" the fish so be sure to uncover about half way through cooking and let the moisture out a little.  I spray the pan with pan spray, arrange my fish, sprinkle on some lemon juice (not too much), the old bay (or whatever seasoning blend I want to substitute).  I omit the butter.  I use garlic powder vice garlic salt to lower the sodium content - old bay has enough salt.  I also put some lemon juice over the veggies for some added flavor.  I top the fish with Panko (japanese bread crumbs) about 1/3 - 1/2 cup mixed with some paprika (1/2 tsp), 1/8 tsp. pepper and 2 T. grated Parmesan Cheese.  Cook as directed.  This is a great recipe.

Tilapia is an excellent choice for people who don't enjoy seafood.  Mild, adaptable, healthy.  The recipe as written is mild and can be adapted to each person's taste buds quite easily.  Hubby likes mild  and my son and I lean towards spicy so it was a perfect choice for us as each filet was customized to our individual preferences.

This was delicious and I'll be making it again for sure - quick, easy and even healthy!

I made this recipe slightly different than the instructions, using what I had on hand. I did not have any frozen vegetables of any kind so I decided to lay the fish on a bed of rice. I sprayed a pan with cooking spray, and then spread 1 cup of rice (not minute rice) into bottom of baking dish, and added 1 and 1/4 cups water. I laid the still frozen tilapia fillets on top of the rice and seasoned per the instructions, going heavy as suggested by most of the reviews I read. I did not have any fresh lemon so I added a substantial amount of lemon pepper seasoning instead. Covered with foil and baked at 375 for 30-40 minutes and it came out great! Rice and fish cooked to perfection! The ONLY thing I would have done differently is to have added more butter and seasonings to the rice itself, it was good but could have used more flavor.  Thanks for such a great base recipe!

I made this today and it turned out great. I did sub the Old Bay seasoning for Cajun and instead of a lemon I used a lime. My picky eater loved it! I'll make this again =)

Wow ~ 4 1/2 stars made me want to try this recipe for Easy Baked Tilapia, but to be totally honest, I followed the directions to a "T" and I thought the fish turned out dry with very little flavor...not a good combination.

Recipe was pretty basic. To cut down on the sodium I didn't add the garlic salt, instead I added garlic powder. The old Bay has enough salt. I sprinkled pepper. Used the lemon slice and added a slice of orange. To save on dishes, I made foil pouches and placed on a cookie sheet. You can also make this on your grill without the cookie sheet.
I didn't make the veggies, Made a salad instead and wild rice.

I did not have Old Bay Seasoning, so used salt, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Otherwise did everything per directions. It was incredibly tasty and satisfying. The veggies were yummy with a mild taste of the lemon. Served with rice with sauteed onions, green, yellow, and red peppers. It made for a beautiful, colorful plate.

I was skeptical at first because I don't like the taste of frozen tilapia, and this seemed too plain to mask the fishiness... but boy was I wrong. I love this fish. It is tasty, economical, and quick & easy enough for a weeknight.  Yum!!

I absolutely loved this recipe even though I'm definitly not a fish eater. I took the advise of others by running hot water over the frozen veggies before baking. They would never have cooked through without defrosting first. I also added parmesan cheese and seasoned bread crumbs per other reviews...great addition. What made it for me is instead of butter I used sesame oil to coat the pan and drizzled some over filet. I didn't have any Old Bay, so I substituted season salt and instead of lemon I used fresh lemon thyme sprinkled over the fish. After baking 15 min I added the cheese and bread crumbs then drizzled a little more sesame oil over it and baked uncovered the additional 10 minutes. I will definitely be adding tilapia to my meals in the future...quick, inexpensive and tasty.

I grilled mine on the George Foreman grill. I used the same ingredients but since it wasn't going in the oven I melted butter and olive oil on a plate, rubbed the filets in it, sprinkled it with lemon juice - and then used all the other seasonings - turned out great!  Served with steamed green beans and garlic bread.

Line the fish with cubed potatoes instead of vegetables. Be sure the cubes are small,,,,to ensure being cooked in 30 minutes.

This is a WEEKLY staple in our home! It's the Easiest and Healhiest fish I have ever made that my family LOVES. I once forgot the lemon slices and my son was quickly disappointed! I don't deviate much from the recipe, it's easy! I go light on the butter and have switched up my veggie choices. I've added many different frozen selections from my local grocers freezer to "change" our healthy meal. I've even added fresh veggies half-way into our baking time. Thank you for this wonderful, healthy meal!

I love this recipe & make it all the time. I use just plain frozen broccoli, & sometimes add in some cut up potatoes as well.  It all goes great with the seasoning mix.  I add a little borsari citrus seasoning salt on top of everything & squeeze lemon juice on top rather than using lemon slices.  I also rub fresh chopped garlic onto the fish rather than using garlic powder because I think the taste is a little nicer.

Made this tonight. Love the simplicity! Didn't have lemons or lemon juice :( so I used a few dashes of lemon pepper and followed the recipe as stated (well-minus the veggies-didn't have those either). Fabulous! Everyone wanted to lick their plate :)

Overall, it was pretty good. The best part being how easy it was to prepare. The worst being that my house smelled like a big fart. My spouse loved it though, so I give it 4.5 stars.

Very very good!  It was so easy.  I added 1/4 tsp more of Old Bay and sprinkled some paprika on also.  And instead of butter I used extra virgin olive oil.  Also I put tin foil down in the pan first, makes clean up a breeze.

Turned out perfect! I just cooked the fish alone, I used olive oil instead of butter, normally I don't like fish but this was simple, easy, and tasty! My husband and picky kids loved it, thank you:-)

This is very good.  I've made it probably a half dozen times now.  and I've changed it up since.  I have always used 1/2 tsp of Old Bay, I've done the garlic powder/onion powder combo(was ok), I've also used 1/4 tsp of rosemary garlic from the grinder by Spice Island seasonings(awesome).  Also, instead of EVOO, I use 1/4 cup white cooking wine.

If I could give this a million stars, I would. I used frozen tilapia and frozen veggies and just added an extra 7 minutes. The only substitution I made was using Tony's creole seasoning instead of Old Bay because it was all I had on hand. It was perfect! So the next night I decided to try the same recipe with chicken breasts. Again, I used frozen chicken and a different mix of frozen vegetables. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes and it was the best chicken I've ever had in my life. Thank you so much for this recipe... It's so easy and versatile.. definitely a keeper!

Tilapia is a light & delicious fish. It cooked wonderfully in this recipe.  I made just a few changes, like sprinkling the lemon juice over the fish, and used fresh veggies w/a touch of olive oil, S&P, red onion, mushrooms, celery & broccoli. Great light meal.

2nd time making it since a month ago finding this recipe. 1st time I made as directed minus lemons or lemon juice. Instant hit! Last night I made it without the veggies and sprinkled old bay a bit more liberally with butter sprinkled all over. Then I made Landry's ponchertrain sauce with pan seared scallops. Chopped some of scallops and mixed with sauce, laddled ontop of fish and topped it with the remaining scallops. Beautiful dinner. This simple tilapia dish will become a regular menu that allows so many different ways of presenting itself.

Easy to make and tasted great! Adjustments: Enough Old Bay Seasoning to cover the 4 Tilapia fillets, Garlic Powder (no garlic salt in cabinet), juiced with half lemon and covered with 1 sliced lemon, added 1tbspn fresh chopped cilantro and 2 cloves of garlic chopped. Baked 375 for 30mins covered. Served with Brown Rice and Baked Sweet Potato. Excellent! Will make again!!

Made this mostly as written.  I didn't have garlic salt and wasn't sure if it was garlic "salt" or "powder" that was "really" called for... since regular salt was another spice... so I used seasoned salt plus garlic powder and the old bay.  I had a bag of California Mix veggies... cauliflower, broccoli and carrots...that was the best I could do without making another trip to the store, sorry! The dish was very pretty going into and coming out of the oven... and smelled delicious cooking.  Next time, I think I would go heavier on the spices as it seemed a little bland to me.  That being said, the husband and kids gobbled it up... and there is one piece of fish plus veggies left for his lunch tomorrow.  I would be happy to make it again!  Oh-- and one of the reviews said to defrost the veggies first... I did a partial defrost... just put the bag of veggies into the fridge for about 3 hours prior to cooking... and that took enough of the iciness off.  Good idea!

The wide range of the reviews from one star to five stars supports the Latin saying: De gustibus non est disputandum (Concerning tastes, there is no dispute.). Although the sale of tilapia has increased in recent years, some relate that to the lower price of tilapia compared to the much more prized and expensive fresh ahi/ yellow-fin tuna and flounder/ sole. For tilapa-based recipes that are not bland, it is necessary to use sufficient spices. For those who wish to cook tilapia, this easy baked tilapia recipe may require several trials to determine the optimal amount of spices to suit one's taste. Personally, in the future I shall not purchase tilapia .

The prep was extremely easy, but it took me a lot longer to bake the tilapia until it was safe to eat.  I ended up uncovering it after 25 minutes, cranked the oven up to 400 to try and speed up the process (we were hungry!), and broiled at the end.  The flavor was good, but I think next time we'll try a different cooking method.

I really don't care for fish, but this recipe is awesome!! I squeezed lemon juice on the fish and veggies. I also sprinkled some cayenne pepper, season-all, blackened old bay seasoning, and paprika on the fish.  I only used broccoli and sprinkled that with s&p.  I thought it was amazing, kids loved it too!!  You can spice this up with anything you have in your spice cabinet, use your fave seasonings so the fish will be to your liking.

I really enjoyed this recipe!!! Although i didnt cook it as long because i had smaller fish, but watch the cooking time because if you cook it to long it turns out really dry. I also found that using lemon juice instead of lemons worked better...more flavor!!! 5 stars!!!

So easy! Tilapia is very mild and this recipe really infuses it with garlic and lemon flavor. The veggies really pick up the flavor as well. Super inexpensive to make and very flavorul and healthy. Fresh minced garlic makes a big difference and I recommend drizzling some lemon juice over the fish and veggies. This dish has become a frequent favorite in my home. Photo available on my profile page.

Delicious. I did cut the garlic salt in half (1/4 tsp.) and added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder (seemed like the fish might be too salty w/ that much garlic salt). I doubled the Old Bay, but only because I ran out as I was sprinkling onto the fish and needed to add more to cover everything. I roasted the broccoli & cauliflower separately in some EVOO, Old Bay, garlic powder, and cracked black pepper. Baked both at 400, veggies for 20 minutes, fish for 25. This was probably the easiest meal that I've ever prepared. Served with Knorr Herb & Butter rice. The whole meal was less than 500 calories! Don't skip the lemon slices; I think they really add to the flavor. And don't substitute lemon juice! Real lemon slices are key!

It was good but I didn't like the flavor of the fish under the lemon slice. Next time I'll just squirt some lemon juice instead.

I threw this together with some lightly sauteed brussels sprouts and mushrooms instead of frozen veggies. Popped it in the oven and surfed the web while it baked. When I served it, my husband crowed "How fancy!" (we're poor newlyweds), and it was really delicious.

Friday dinner is fish night and this is what I cooked tonight. My husband loved it and said "really good". Though I did some modifications and didn't use measurements. I just mixed melted butter with lemon juice, old bay seasoning, garlic and onion powder. Poured into tilapia wrapped in each foil packets. Broiled it for 15-20minutes. I also added parmesan cheese a few minutes before its done. Really tasty!

Very quick and Very easy.  I'm glad I read alot of reviews first.  I used sliced lemons and lemon juice, garlic and onion powder, and heavy with the old bay.  The only thing that was an issue was it wasn't done in 30 minutes.  I did have my frozen vegetables and tilapia in the refrigerator all day before I cooked it....but it took 40 minutes to cook.  I know next time just start checking on it at the 25 minute mark.  However, other than that very good and very quick!!!!  I know a dish is good when my husband eats it all!!!!!

I have actually been making a recipe like this for years...got it from Red Lobster website...fish in a bag...minus the garlic salt....i revised it ...i steam my veggies prior ( i do carrots and potatoes-use any veggies you like)cuz i like them tender and i use i cant believe its not butter no calorie spray butter and spray the fish and veggies with that. I also put the old bay seasoning on the veggies too and sometimes have no fresh lemon so i just use a few drops of lemon reconstituted juice(the little container shapped like a lemon)

This was a nice surprise! I was looking for a fast, simple recipe for tilapia that would go with pasta and leftover alfredo sauce.  I assumed since this looked so healthy it wouldn't have much flavor but I gave it a try and I was wrong. It was very good and went well with the pasta. My son who was home from college had it for dinner AND breakfast the next morning!!

Five stars for being the best combination:  easy, few ingredients, and delicious!  I actually wasn't expecting it to be as delicious as it was because of the simplicity of the recipe.  I keep trying fish recipes and there are only two that I've really liked enough to make again, and this is one of them!  Will become a regular part of my menus.

This turned out very average for me. Fine, nothing special. I used frozen tilapia, but other reviewers who liked it much more than I did, as well...this had no flavor. REALLY wanted to like it, but unfortunately, just not impressed at all.

Great way to cook Tilapia!  It tasted so good and was so healty.  Instead of using any butter I used cooking spray but otherwise followed everything else!  Even my two year old asked for more fish and veggies!

Excellent and easy. Mix and match your own herbs. I used garlic 'n herbs, some seasoned salt and dried parsley and mixed it with about 1.5 tablespoons of butter. Melted it all and poured it over the fish. Added lemon slices, covered the dish and tinfoil and baked for 25 minutes. Sprinkled with shredded parmesean when it was done! YUM!!

This was so SO EASY and SO DELICIOUS!  The fish was moist and tender and the old bay was yummy!  I did not cook it with veggies and I only cooked 2 fillets for 20 mins.  Thanks so much!

Great way to bake tilapia. I took it out a few minutes early, removed the lemons, sprinkled it with grated parmesan and broiled it until golden brown. The kids loved it.

Very easy, very flavorful, very good dish.  I followed directions exactly (except omitted the frozen veggies and opted for a rice pilaf for the side).  Came out great!

Yum. I had a request for "just baked fish" and found this recipe, it was wonderful. I usually season my fish with seasoned salt, pepper and dill but seasoned as specified (well plus dill, I just think it's MADE for fish): this too was a nice simple combination which I will use again and in other fish recipes. No problems with the cook time. The lemon baked in was nice, seemed to blend into the fish more than just juicing one over the top. Thanks very much for submitting.

This was my first time using Old Bay seasoning (I had a sample packet). With the garlic salt added, this was way TOO salty. Plus with the lemon juice and the vegetables, my fish was slightly soggy.

I am giving it 4 stars because I changed it and I used this as a base.  I ommitted the veggies and lemon.  I thought that fishy tasting veggies would not taste good.  I melted the butter with the garlic and Old Bay seasoning.  I poured the butter mixture over the fish.  I baked for about 20 minutes.  Then, I took about a cup of panko breadcrumbs with some parmesan cheese and spread that on top of the fish.  I stuck it back in the oven until the breadcrumbs browned.  My family LOVED it.  Even my three year old loves it.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have frozen cauliflower with broccoli and red pepper so I added asparagus and quartered pototoes,with a little olive oil springled on top of them.  My husband thought it was really good. Will make often.

This was nice and easy--a simple meal to scale when cooking for one!  I made two fillets and still used a whole bag of stir fry veggies.  I had a good dinner and the perfect sized lunch for the next day.

Not so great in my opinion. I think the fish would benefit from being baked in an open container. The water from the frozen veggies didn't help it at all.

Wow, that was amazing!  I used only items I had, fresh broccoli, green beans and baby carrots which I positioned around the fish (not over the fish) as per suggestions. I used garlic salt, black pepper, paprika as per suggestions, I also added parmesan cheese and fresh parsley in the last 5 minutes. I didn't have Old bay seasoning or lemons and it was the most amazing fish dish I've ever had!  WOW!  Easy to make, one dish to wash, awesome all the way around.  Thank you for this great recipe!

YUM !  Very good, and very easy. Like a previous poster, I too squeezed fresh lemon juice on mine. I used a small lemon and sliced on half for slices on top of the fish, then squeezed the juice from the other half over the whole dish.  I'm making it again tonight (second time in 1 week) but this time will go a little heavier with the Old Bay and salt.

Great flavor and very healthy.  I used olive oil instead of the butter.  Also added onion powder, whole wheat bread crumbs and parmesan to the topping.  I also used fresh broccoli and cauliflower and just briefly steamed it before baking.  Served with rice.  Delicious.

I am not a big fish eater, love shell fish, but generally not fish fish.  Anyway, bought some Tilapia and my husband told me that it isn't good fish.  I decided to find a recipe and find out for myself.  I made this dish the other night and he ate it and told me that it was fabulous!  So, thanks for the recipe!  I even passed it along on my blog to my friends.

I make this recipe about once a week.  I'll usually slice some fresh zucchini and yellow squash in place of the frozen veggies, and I use Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning in place of Old Bay... it's delicious.  It's one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes, and he used to hate fish!

I have made this so many times, I cannot believe I have not rated it until now.  Mine always takes 10-15 minutes longer to bake.  I just use whatever frozen veggies I have in the freezer, and wait until those are cooked to make sure it is done.  I usually make a side dish of brown rice to go with.  Very easy and good for a mid week meal.

Okay, I admit, I didn't make it exactly like the recipe stated.  Instead, I fried it in a pan with a bit of olive oil and it came out much better, than baking it.

This was my first time making and eating tilapia- this recipe was easy and great for a beginner like myself.  I think it needed a little more flavor and seasoning though.

I didn't eat this, but my husband said the fish tasted good, but after cooking it about twice as long as it said it would need to be cooked it was finally done.  He said the vegetables weren't very good.  Too lemony.  I, too, squeezed the lemon juice on the vegetables.  My 8 year old said the fish was better with more pepper.  I would cook the vegetables seperately next time because they liked the fish alone.

Super easy, super quick, fantastic taste! My husband loved it and my young kids ate their full portion without complaint. We will be eating this about once a week for sure. (I omitted the garlic salt only because the Old Bay seasoning I have is the "garlic and herb" variety.) Thanks for this time-saving, delicious recipe!

This was very dry and bland. It was crunchy, but zero flavor.  I would add different spices or seasoning, or something to provide a little moisture.  With the corn meal in there, I would add maybe some hot sauce or mexican type seasonings, maybe even a packet of taco or fajita seasoning to the dry mix and serve it on top of a pico de gallo with black beans mixed in it.  Or maybe use the dry mix but add Old Bay seasoning to it and have it with tartar sauce.  It needs something.

I was really surprised how good this is--I was worried that the vegetables would taste like fish, but they didn't.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and I put some butter chunks on the vegetables, too.  I served it with brown rice and Irresistible Soda Bread.

Easy!  I left off the frozen veggies and just steamed mine on the stove.  The flavor of the tilapia was light and the lemon gave it such a nice finishing touch.  Yum!  I served it with couscous.

I altered this recipe by making a breaking from Italian breadcrumbs+panko breadcrumbs+cornmeal with Old Bay seasonings, garlic powder, onion powder, & cracked black pepper. I lightly breaded the fish filets, sprayed cooking spray in a 13 x 9 pan, placed fish in pan, then dotted butter around fish, drizzled olive oil lightly over fish, and added about 1/2 cup white wine to pan around fish. Baked fish until golden brown on top. Husband says best fish he's had in a long time. Served with scalloped potatoes, and steamed broccoli.

This recipe is awesome.  Instead of the frozen veggies, I bought some fresh asparagus.  I put a few pats of butter on them with some garlic salt.  I also put garlic/parmesan spice on the fish and the asparagus.

Definitely an awesome and easy weeknight meal. Use prepacked frozen tilapia filets and you're good to go! Also, Old Bay isn't the only seasoning you can use. I used Everglades All Purpose Seasoning (aka Monkey Dust for you Floridians out there) and it was very tasty. I might try plain old Adobo seasoning next time. Still, this one's a keeper!

This was quick and easy, I work late and bought the ingridents the day before, it was complete ready in approx 30 minutes. I didn't see old bay seasoning at the store, however I had some lemon seasoning, and it came out perfect. I also made a salad, and rice w/mushrooms, peas, and carrots. They loved, loved, loved it.

I made this recipe one night when my 3 month old twins were crying and my 2 year old and 3 year old were fighting like crazy.  It was very quick and easy.  I used lime instead of lemon because it was what I had on hand.  Not only was it an easy recipe it tastes great.  My husband was impressed and my kids ate every last bite and asked for more.  I definitely felt like super mom that night!!!! Thanks

I'm not a fan of lemon & that's all I could taste of the fish. The veg was a different idea & we loved it(I used broccoli, partially thawed). Hubby & daughter liked it very much.

I have to say that I've never cooked before and well I wanted to trying cooking something for the first time without messing up. This recipe went very well and the taste was amazing. 30min was all I needed and couple side dishes and dinner was done. I defiantly recommend this to anyone else like myself looking to start with something simple and enjoyable

Couldn't understand why so many people loved this recipe because it looked too easy to be that good....Oh my, this was wonderful.  Baked at 375 for 30 min. and it was perfect.  As others had recommended, let the frozen veggies thaw first, this is key to having everything finish cooking at the same time.  This will be on our menu quite a few times during this Lenten season, and throughout the year.

Super easy and healthy but the vegetables lacked in flavor. It can easily be fixed by seasoning the veggies.

Did not enjoy this dish at all. The fish was very bland and I did not like the addition of the lemon. Will not make again.

Quick delicious dinner. I used frozen tilapia and followed another reviewers suggestions and melted the butter with the old bay seasoning and garlic and drizzled it over the fish. I used a package of frozen cauliflower carrots and snap peas. Delicious.

A win!  I didn't have old bay seasoning, so I improvised.  I used frozen tilapia, used suggestion to put filets on a bed of vegs.  Easy, served over rice, yummy!

Not even close on the time, at 30 minutes the fish was still mostly raw. (more than 70%) I know I have to adjust my bake times for cake, (I live in the Rockies) but fish? If it ever gets done I evaluate the flavor.

This was just ok. The flavor wasn't balanced enough for my taste. It needs some lemon squeezed on top of the fish I think. Also, thaw vegetables beforehand. Mine were still cold.

Quick and easy tilapia dish!  I didn't use exact measurements; just poured 1/2t garlic salt, sprinkled it over the fillets until I decided there was enough (I don't like a lot of salt and was worried about using in conjunction with the Old Bay).  I sprinkled the Old Bay liberally and added a dash of garlic powder (love garlic!).  My family of non-fish lovers enjoyed it and I will definitely be making this again.

This was good, not great.  I did follow reviewers' suggestions to thaw the vegetables and add a little seasoned salt and parmesan cheese.  Probably not a recipe I'll make again.  I used frozen tilapia (freshly thawed).  Not sure if fresh tilapia would have made a difference.  Tilapia is not expensive!  This is a good thing!

This was very easy and good flavor, but the veggies just didn't come out as advertised.  Next time I'll prepare the veggies fresh and separate from the fish.

I used frozen tilapia (not thawing).  I didn't have garlic salt and used celery salt instead. I didn't have frozen broc & caul w/ red peppers, just froz broc&caul and added frozen pearl onions and fresh grape tomatoes. No lemons either, just sprinkled lemon juice. I cooked it for about 40 min total, I believe.  This was SO yummy... all three kids ate it up too! 2nd servings for the boys! Served with chicken flavored rice w/ broccoli (the one in the frozen microwave bag) & fresh salad. SUPER quick, easy, healthy dinner and SUPER tastey too!  I highly recommend this dish cooked this way with any variation of your favorite seasonings... It was YUM-O!

This was marvelous! An easy and very flavorful way to prepare Tilapia. I added 1/4 cup of white wine without using lemon slices. I had lemon juice and just splashed juice on the fillets. Thank you for sharing.

Good, basic recipe for any mild fish.  I made exactly as written and didn't feel the butter added anything so next time I'll skip the small addition of fat and calories.  This could be modified in many ways by adding different spice combinations and different frozen vegetables.  I think asparagus could be particularly good this way.

I didn't use the veggies, but this was a great easy and quick way to fix a wonderfully, healthy dinner. I served the fish with black beans and brown rice, which went well with the citrus flavors. I used limes instead of lemons and squeezed one all over the fish before baking. YUM!

This is good!  Easy and healthy.  I used my own fish seasoning (published on this site as "Dianne's Fish Seasoing") instead of Old Bay.  Drizzled the fish and veggies with olive oil, sprinkled the seasoning over everything, added some lemon slices and it was good to go!  Perfect with rice as a side dish.

I am giving this 4 stars just because I didn't follow the recipe to the T. I couldn't find the Old Bay Seasoning and instead I used the Mediterranean Herb Perfect Pinch by McCormick, since there are so many spices in it I skiped the garlic salt. I used  salt and pepperr, the butter, the lemon and the frozen vegetables as suggested, it was delicious! next time I will add more of the seasoning for extra flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

We are not big fish eaters in our house but are trying to eat healthier so I decided to try this recipe out tonight.  It was a HUGE hit.  I purposely made what I thought was extra so my husband and I would have leftovers for lunch but there was nothing left!!  It was thumbs up and got a coveted "it's a do over!" from my kids.  I would probably give it a 5....except it is still fish! LOL

i followed the recipie mainly. i melted the butter and added the lemon juice like another person stated. i brushed it on the fish then sprinkled the old bay, lemon powder, oinion powder, paprika, salt and some pepper and repeated on both sides. i put the vegis on top and also spreqd lemon butter on them and sprinkled ligh6t salt and peppr to it. to add a different twist to it I poured som pre cooked shrimp on it. put foil on it and baked it! after 30 mins i took the foil off and let bake on a lower temp for a bout 10/15 extra mins to allow the fish to crisp some. this allowing my jasmine rice took cook:P YUM!!! will try different ways later.. thanks for the place to start

This is great! I made this for my husband and my parents and they loved it!  I suggest using a little more Old Bay Seasoning and garlic salt.  I don't cook the vegetables, they never turn out well for me.

I wish I could rate this a 4.5.  I prepared the recipe as directed, only I don't keep garlic salt on hand so I just used garlic powder and salt.  The dish came together quick and had a pleasant mild flavor, but I felt like it was missing something.  I think I'll experiment next time and add some onion powder and parsley.

Made this for my wife and she really liked it.  Did not have any Old Bay seasoning, but used fresh pepper, minced garlic, a little salt, two lemon slices per fillet, and just a touch of cayenne.  Used a glass baking dish with a little olive oil on the bottom.  Did not include the veggies either.  It was very easy and turned out perfect.

I tried this recipe because I was out of parmesan cheese and couldn't prepare our favorite baked parmesan breaded tilapia.  While we didn't enjoy this quite as much, it was a great and easy alternative.  I defrosted the tilapia and vegetables before baking, and both were done to a perfect consistency after 25-30 minutes.  After reading many reviews, I decided to season the tilapia more liberally, using McCormick's Grill Mates Seafood Rub on both sides.  In addition to dotting the fish with butter, I melted extra butter and drizzled it over the vegetables after sprinkling them with salt and pepper.   I will definitely make this again due to the extreme ease of preparation and clean-up, and the versatility of it offers for altering the seasonings and vegetables. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I absolutely loved this dish. I really don't like fish most of the time but this recipe really surprised me. I used frozen Tilapia and frozen veggies (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower mix). I didn't have fresh lemon so I just poured about a Tbsp. of juice over the fish, drizzled them with evoo, salt, pepper, and the seasonings mentioned. I surrounded them with the veggies and put some margarine on top. Since I used frozen fish I had to cook it for a few extra minutes. It turned out wonderfully. Thanks!

This was great, but here's how we cooked it:  We thawed frozen brussels sprouts and used fresh tomatoes for the vegetables. Old Bay, garlic powder and lemon pepper front and back. Dabs of butter and slices of lemon on top of the fish while in the oven. Cook covered for 20 minutes, sprinkle everything with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and bake for an additional 10 minutes. \It would have been so healthy if I hadn't had macaroni and cheese as the side dish! *smile*

I would really give this 4.5 stars because my boyfriend liked it more than I did. It is mild, and fresh tasting. I used frozen broccoli. Very easy. Cover it with foil when you bake it for sure.

I made this recipe last evening for my boyfriend and I. Used frozen/ fresh tilapia. This was outstanding! Very tender and flavorful. Next time, I will use a bit more Old Bay seasoning as we like just a kick more of flavor. But this was a really easy and healthy meal to prepare. Served it over rice pilaf and asparagus spears! Will definitely make again.

I made this fish today and we really liked it.  I added more butter and melted it.  I also put the seasoning in the melted butter and then brushed the butter on the fish before baking it.  You are going to have to add more seasoning otherwise it will be bland.  I added more of the seasoning stated, but I also added some black pepper as well as ceyenne pepper as I am from the south and we like our food spicy.  I baked for 25 mins covered and then 5 mins uncovered.  The reason I did this is because if you are going to add vegetables to it you are going to want to cook it uncovered so it is not swimming in liquid.  I also thawed out my vegetables before cooking them also...overall I thought its was a great easy dinner!!! Something I will be making again!!! Thanks for such a great recipe for a beginner cook like me!!!

This recipe was great!  I skipped the vegetables and made dilled red potatoes separately instead.  I baked for 20 minutes, removed from oven, sprinkled with parmesan cheese, and then baked for another 10 minutes. Perfect!  We love it and there are never any leftovers...

Can't get much easier than this and it tastes great too!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen tilapia. Just popped the frozen tilapia and frozen veggies in the oven. Had to add about 10 minutes cooking time.  It worked out well with the frozen veggies because they were done at the same time. It also looked very pretty and I liked that it was healthy.

This turned out really well. I used a frozen veggie medley that included yellow squash, onion, asparagus, mushrooms and peppers.  I melted the butter (probably about 2 TBS instead of tsp), mixed in Old Bay, garlic salt, lemon juice from 1/2 a lemon, and pepper. Brushed both sides of the filets. Then I sprinkled just a dash of lemon pepper and parsley over the fish.  Topped each filet with a lemon slice. Spread semi-thawed veggies around the fish, as directed. Baked, covered for about 20 minutes. Didn't have bread crumbs, but crushed about 10 Ritz crackers, mixed in Parmesan cheese. Uncovered fish and sprinkled cracker mix. Baked 10 more minutes.  The sweetness of the crackers was perfect for the tartness of the lemon juice and the bit of spice in Old Bay. Served with long grain wild rice and a roll. Thanks for a great meal!

Wonderful. As others have stated I add paprika to the bay seasoning, butter and lemon and then sprinkle some Parmesan in the last few moments of cooking. I use this recipe on all different types of fish.

Made it twice. It was a big hit for my family. Turned out awesome. Used all kinds of frozen veggies(whatever my family likes). Even my 2 year old ate everything.

UPDATED REVIEW after using FRESH broccoli florets and a very generous amount of the seasoning:  Delicious, easy and healthy!  This will go into our regular weeknight dinner rotation. 
RECIPE AS WRITTEN:  Extremely bland.  Other reviewers were right in that the vegetables put off too much water.  Not nearly enough seasoning.

Pretty good... use a good bit of Old Bay- it lacks flavor if you don't.

Let me start off saying that I hate fish (the taste and boy have I tried to like it, since it is so healthy and low fat) and did not actually eat this....but made it for my husband and daughter while I had leftovers.  My husband thought it was pretty tasty.  I did not have any of the Old Bay Seasoning, but used some of Emmeral's essence instead.  Because it is quite spicey...I only salt and peppered my daughter's (15 mo) and she loved it.  My husband even ate the vegetables!  I have never cooked fish before (see reason above) but found this recipe easy to follow.  I will make again, Only got four stars because that is what my husband rated it

I followed this recipe closely (for me!) except for the Old Bay Seasoning. We don't have any, so I just salted, peppered, and garlic powdered the fillets on both sides. Oh, and I drizzled each fillet with a little lemon juice instead of using slices, I prefer the end result. Quite good! Our daughter scarfed the fish and tried the veggies, success! Simple and tasty, I might try serving with a lemon sauce next time. Thanks for sharing, FMcNerney. :)

Good recipe, very easy to prep.  Next time, I'll steam the veggies seperately.  It took longer for the fish to cook.  I had to take them out because the fish wasn't cooking.  I will cook this again and add something extra for more kick.

Good dish but needs more of a kick, I would recommend adding a good bit of black pepper and paprika.  I also doubled the bay seasoning which added to the flavor.

This was really good! I used Costco stir-fry vegetables and used another user's idea of adding bread crumbs and parmesan cheese during the last 5 minutes. It was delicious!

Very good!  Next time I think I'll go a little heavier on the seasoning.  Instead of using a lemon I used a tomato, but next time I'll use the lemon.  Putting the mixed vegatables in the pan with the fish not only saved on clean up but made them very tender.  Very easy to make and very easy to clean up, and all with a great taste.

I'm rating it a 3 because it was a bit bland--but it has potential. Next time maybe a 4 but I don't think it'll ever be a 5 for me, it's just a tad boring for my husband and I. I think we just prefer shellfish, so it's not the recipe that's at fault.

I used olive oil instead of butter (as the healthier choice), and mixed some garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper and brushed this all on the fish. I didn't have fresh lemons so I just squeezed on some lemon juice, then sprinkled on some bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, covered with foil, and baked for almost 25 minutes. I served it with whole wheat pasta and green beans since that's all we had in the house tonight.

Next time I'll definitely add more of the same seasonings, and remove the foil for the last ten minutes.  I think I'll also lay thin lemon slices on top, and surround the fish with fresh or frozen vegetables as the recipe calls for.  Maybe I'll serve it with couscous.

Overall: not bad--pleasant and somehow comforting, and filling.

This fish was SO easy.  I actually omitted the frozen veggies and made some fresh broccoli on the side.  I used a convection bake setting on my oven, at 375, and it took less than 20 minutes and was still very moist.  

I was pretty heavy-handed on the Old Bay and garlic salt, and I used fresh lemon juice as some others suggested.  I also substituted Olive Oil for the butter.

This is a very versatile recipe and I can see adding this to my regular rotation. The fact that it took me about 5 minutes to prep it for the oven was a HUGE plus!

Very, Very good!  Simple yet pretty and tasty!  I used seasoning salt instead of old bay seasoning and it was excellent!  I served it over slightly buttered angel hair pasta and boy, it was delish!  My husband said it was restaurant quality in taste and presentation.  Thank you for a great recipe.  UPDATE:  I made this again  tonight and I can't emphasize enough how good this is.  I've made numerous dishes from this site and many excellent ones but this one trumps all others.  I would give this 10 stars if I could!  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!

This was really yummy. Ultra healthy and delicous for a family thats currently in a low carb diet. 
We dont have old bay seasoning in Australia, so i had to improvise a little. But it was still a tasy dish. Served it with more vegies (zucchini, capsicum, broccoli) and didnt use frozen, we used fresh! Thanks :)

Very good. I took some of the suggestions of adding more old bay and some paprika. We don't do butter so I added a couple of teaspoons of olive oil. We don't care for cauiflower so I did broccoli and carrots with red peppers. Very good we went for seconds. Thank you. Very healthy dish. Husband and I loved it.

Great!  I took the advice of others and added more Old Bay and used the lemon juice.  It came out great!  My boyfriend loved the dish which makes it a extra winner.  The time to make this is good for the weekdays plus clean up is easy.  I try to make this a few times during the month.  Also, I used frozen carrots and broccoli since my boyfriend doesn't like cauliflower, still good.

Seems as if others like this alot more than I did. As written, it was way to bland. Very uninteresting meal. I ate broccoli and filled up with a nice glass of Chardonnay. I doubt I'll take the time to try and make this recipe more to my liking. Thanks anyway for sharing.

This gets 4 stars for quick, easy and healthy. Not to mention affordable. My husband loved it. However I thought it was a bit bland, next time I will add fresh garlic, more lemon juice and some onion powder.

Quick, easy and delicious! I used crystallized lime powder (my new favorite seasoning!)instead of the lemon slices, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. (We like LOTS of garlic, but just a little salt, and the Old Bay is sufficiently salty on its own.) Also substituted a Mediterranean-style vegetable blend that was already seasoned.  Even my husband, who isn't terribly fond of fish, loved it!  This is one of those recipes that seems perfect for an adventurous cook to experiment with... (ooooh - wouldn't salmon be good done this way!?)  A definite keeper! Thankyou for sharing it!

I used this recipe as a base since it was my first try cooking fish.  After reading a couple reviews about the tilapia drying out if cooked too long...the idea came to me...Oven Bags!!  On each fillet, I lightly squeezed a few drops of real lemon juice (round container in the fresh veggie section).  For seasonings, some shakes of Emeril's Bayou Blast on the fillets and rubbed the seasonings on the entire area of the fillets.  The flavor of the seasoning was just right, not too overpowering.  I stirred the fresh veggies with a light coating of olive oil (broccoli, carrots, and broccoflower - a cross between broccoli and cauliflower, looks like cauliflower but with a green tint - no bitter taste).  Then cut up 3 tablespoons of butter and scattered them over the fish and veggies.   Once everything was in the bag I also added a little water.  Cooked about 45 minutes to an hour on 375 - turned out great!  My husband really liked it and I will be making it again!

YUMMO! I served it with some wild rice, and the whole family raved about the entire meal(even my so who doesn't like cauliflower). A keeper. I will make again. I love when we can get the children to eat their veggies. 2 Thumbs UP!

No flavor.  I had to add a variety of seasoning at the end to add some taste to it.  I was so looking forward to it.  I used some wild basa talapia filets.  It took a lot longer to cook than what the recipe said.  such a tasteful fish... but such a bland recipe.  oh well. Learning.... and I'll keep on trying other recipes.

This was surprisingly good and sooo easy and quick. I used individually wrapped frozen tilapia and added a mix of frozen vegetables. My 13 year old loved it. A keeper

This recipe was SO easy and tasted great! I substituted Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning for the Old Bay and used only frozen broccoli.  It took 28 minutes at 375 in a gas oven.  The broccoli absorbed the taste of the lemon slices that were on top of the fish. Very yummy! I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I love tilapia and during Lent, especially, I make it quite often. I used garlic and onion powder in lieu of the salt. This was quick and easy and perfect for a Friday night on the run. Thanks!

Very simple recipe with lots of room to customize.  I seasoned the filets with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, dried parsley and garlic powder, and placed a pat of butter and sliced lemon on each filet.  I also threw some raw asparagus in the baking dish as well. For the last 10 min of baking (out of 25) I sprinkled breadcrumbs on top of the filets.

Note: I used fresh veggies.  I've tried based on the directions with frozen veggies but the fish didn't cook well, you should defrost beforehand.

I made this and it was delicious! I bought fresh tilapia from the market and decided to make a dish of it, rather than fry it as I usually do with frozen tilapia fillets. I really enjoyed this easy quick recipe. I didn't have old Bay seasoning, so I used my own seasoning. I added dill. I used frozen vegetables that I had on hand, peas and some fresh red bell peppers.  Great dish that I will make again and again!??

This is one of the first recipes I made my husband 5 years ago and I still make it monthly.  We love it as an easy option when we are looking for a light dinner. Pretty much any frozen veggies work in this and I serve it on top of rice to make it stretch a bit further.  =)

I took an old piece of tilapia that had been in the freezer for months, and I just covered it in the ingredients mentioned here plus a nice coating of cayenne pepper, and it was soooo good!  The foil suggestion lead me to wrap it up for the first 25 minutes, and then I opened it up for the last 5 so it can brown.  One of my favorite fish dishes!

I disagree with adding garlic salt considering how salty old bay seasoning is, so I used roasted granulated garlic. Quick to make and hit the spot.

shockingly simple and really full of flavor! I put lots of the seasoning on it, used vegetable oil instead of butter, and squeezed half of the lemon slices all over everything then included them on the bake as well.

Easy Baked Tilapia Haiku: "Believe the reviews. This IS easy and five stars. Really surprised us!" I've never seen a frozen blend of brocc/cauliflower w/ red pepper, so I used a fresh produce bag of the two said veggies, and added a handful of chopped red bell pepper ("Looks like Christmas!" according to my daughter.) Didn't change a thing other than squeezing on lemon juice rather than laying on the slices, and uncovering the pan at 20 min. to add another squeeze, along w/ a couple more sprinkles of Old Bay. I seriously didn't have high hopes for the vegetables - I thought they'd be bland mush, but at this time and temperature w/ just the little bit of seasoning, they were devoured w/ as much delight as the Main Event, and yes, the fish was just as good too!

This recipe was super easy. It is very customizable to your taste.  I mostly followed the recipe ingredient list (didn't have garlic salt so used garlic powder and salt), but just did everything "to taste"  instead of following measurements. Came out great. Everybody loved it. My fish and veggies were frozen solid so, based on other reviews, I cooked for 45 minutes. Everything was tasty and cooked perfectly. So fast and easy, which is just what I needed tonight. I served with some millet and French bread.

I made this again and used the same Frozen vegetables, but a different brand. The vegetables were a little bigger and did not soften as much as I would have liked in 45 minutes. I just popped it back in the oven for a few more minutes (my lentils and rice were not quite ready anyway). If you have smaller veggies you may need less time, thicker cut vegetables you may need more.

This was excellent!  I squeezed lemon juice over the fish instead of using lemon slices and since I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning I had to wing it with whatever spices I could find.  Oh, I didn't use any veggies, I only used this recipe as a guideline for cooking my fish, so I guess I strayed quite a bit in that way.  Served with fresh steamed asparagus and Brazilian White Rice from Allrecipes.

Very good! So simple too:) I didn't have any lemons so I just drizzled some lemon juice concentrate on top and it was very good. I definitely added more of the Old Bay and garlic salt too. I also mixed them together in a small bowl, instead of adding them separately. I only used one tilipia fillet so I cooked it for 22 minutes instead of the 25-30. It came out done but couldn't hurt with added minute or two.

I loved this - for the ease of preparation, the healthiness, and the lemon makes a nice finish.  I used frozen stir-fry veggies and the fish was moist and flaky.  Served with jasmine rice.  Great weeknight dinner.

Turned out SUPER delicious! Only thing I did differently, was cut the butter into small 1 inch cubes and put them on the fish and instead of using fresh lemon, I use a small bottle of lemon juice for it. Put it on top of brown rice and ate it with steamed broccoli. I'm trying this recipe with Halibut instead of tilapia the second time. I'll see how it tastes.

So easy and so delicious! I used broccoli alone instead of the vegetable medley, added a bit of parsley, and olive oil instead of butter - my only changes to the recipe. I can't believe I have only now discovered this recipe, which will certainly make many repeat appearances at my dinner table.

Didn't change a whole lot but used my own homemade seasoned salt mix instead of Old bay. I think the recipe is great but the fish we got - farm raised tilapia from china (my boyfriends purchase) turned out a bit figure than my preference. I mean we could add a ton of seasoning and lemon but it shouldn't need that. I think this is a classic way to prepare a light white fish of any kind so I will make it again. Very simple and I served it with cous cous.

so easy and delicious.  you will feel full after one helping which makes it super healthy calorie-wise.  it's also packed with protein from the fish and cauliflower. i didnt have old bay so i just used paprika, poultry grilling seasoning, and some nutmeg.  turned out good, but may be too spicy for some.

Very good, but probably will not make again since there are so many healthier talapia recipes on this site such as those with no butter or fat.

Tasty! I forgot to get lemons, so I dribbled on a little lemon juice. I also used the Garlic & Herb variety of Old Bay seasoning and left out the garlic salt. It still turned out great! I loved how easy it was. My boyfriend liked it too, and he's kind of picky, so I'll definitely be making this often.

I'm not a big fan of fish, but this was a really good recipe. My husband 
really loved it! It was a comfortable full after eating. It didn't make you feel sluggish after eating like fried foods.

We loved this recipe! I didn't have the seasoning it called for, so I used webers roasted garlic and herbs seasoning and seasoned pepper. I also used fresh broccoli and mini yum yums. It was anything but bland!

My husband always grills some tilapia and I surprised him with this recipe. He loved it, said it was even better than his ;)

I wouldn't go that far, personally, but it was a nice twist... (get it...?) hehe.

This recipe has become one of our week night favorites.  Quick, easy and healthy!  We usually use frozen tilapia so need to cook it a bit longer than the recipe states.

We really enjoyed this. Neither of us are fish eaters but would like to start incorporating it into our weekly menu. I greased the pan with Pam and put olive oil on the fish. I followed someone elses recommendation and melted 3 T of butter and added a liberal amount of Old Bay seasoning to it along with 1/2 a juiced lemon and drizzled it on top. I also put spring onion on top. I also added bread crumbs on top when there was only 10 minutes left and kept the foil off. Next time I need to remember to go easy on the bread crumbs.  I would definitely make this again.

I wasn't really a big fan of this.  I thought it was somewhat bland tasting even though I followed the reviews and liberally seasoned the tilapia with old bay and garlic salt.  I've definately made better seasoned tilapia before.  I would have rated it lower but surprisingly my husband and children both liked this recipe.  So maybe it was just me.  I think I like stronger tastes.

This is great!  I don't put any butter on it, use fresh broccoli, carrots, and red bell pepper for the veggies (don't like cauliflower), and finally, put fresh minced garlic over the whole thing instead of garlic salt.  Lastly, I put salt and pepper on the whole thing.  I usually serve this dish with Zatarain's Red Beans and Rice - really healthy and low-cal meal, and so delicious you'd never guess it!  I totally recommend!

Great recipe for tilapia! I used this as a base recipe and tweaked it to suit my family's tastes. After reading other reviews, I coated each side with olive oil and added Old Bay liberally. I added lemon/pepper seasoning, sea salt (both from grinder spice bottles), and garlic powder. I omitted the frozen veggies and served with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh cucumbers/tomatoes. I cooked for 20-30 minutes, added crushed seasoned croutons after that cooking time then cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes. Family went crazy! Thanks for sharing!

This recipes is so great and super easy.  I have made it with fresh veggies and frozen.  You can also use any kind of white fish.  I don't care for tilapia because it is quite fishy.  With this recipe it masks the fishiness.  I prefer this recipe with barimudi.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make, healthy, and inexpensive b/c it requires very little ingredients. The broccoli is even delicious because it absorbs the flavor from the fish and spices during baking. Will be adding this to my list of staple recipes, especially when I am short on time.

I don't cook fish as much as I should, especially since tilapia is always a bargain here in FL, but this easy recipe has convinced me to try it more often.

I did not have Old Bay, but used Mrs. Dash Spicy Blend. Poured a couple TBS of canola in the 13X9, tossed the fish fillets, sprinkled liberally with the Spicy Dash (salt-free), lightly sprinkled w/sea salt, and covered the fillets completely with thin slices of a fresh lemon. Filled in all remaining space in the pan with frozen mixed vegs (chopped broc, red/yellow sweet peppers, zucchini) and dotted them with butter. Covered and baked at 375 for 40 mins while brown rice was cooking. Absolutely awesome and healthy meal. I had leftovers tonight and that was equally as good. This will be a weekly meal for my house.

This was delicious and nutritious!  Not much of a fish person but this was great. I got a bag of broccoli/cauliflower and a bag of red peppers/green peppers/onions. I also sprinkled the Old Bay and some Smart Balance butter over the veggies so they didnt need salt.   Its a very light dinner for the guys, even with the vegetables so I made some brown rice w/ quinoa to go with it.

For white fish, I was always under the foolish impression that it was boring/bland & therefore needed a breaded topping, cream sauce, etc. Wow! I was dead wrong. This recipe was filling and flavorful. In addition, I added Cajun seasoning to give it a kick. Sometimes less is good and in this case, less is GREAT!

I didn't add the lemon or the veggies. I also more butter and old bay and my family really enjoyed this with the changes. I also used haddock loins instead of tilapia which took a bit longer to cook.

Was pretty yummy.  Even my 8 year old daughter loved it! I rubbed olive oil over bottom of pan, then seasoned both sides of fish with tiny bit of melted butter, blackened seasoning, garlic powder, and lemon pepper. Also instead of lemon slices, I squeezed lemon juice over the top of them after seasoning.  I sauteed the veggies separately.  It was delicious :)

Excellent simple recipe for Daddy's dinner night.
My young children love this fish over a bed of steamed brown rice.

We love the Old Bay ( I used Old Bay Blackened season for my wife & I) 
My simple variation was to melt the butter down, lightly brush the fillets with butter/garlic salt mixture. Add lemon pepper to taste.

This recipe was simple, and delicious! I used brown rice as a side instead but next time we're trying the broccoli. I added more old baybecause I'm an old bay fanatic, and a teensy bit of lemon juice to each piece. Came out perfect. If you aren't into fish that tastes, well..super fishy, this is the recipe for you!

Quick, easy and inexpensive recipe. 
My recipe is also baked and it makes delicious fish tacos for a quick, week days, dinner. Check it out.

This was even better then I was expecting. I cooked fresh veggies separate, but didnt change anything about baking the fish. Even my husband loved it.

I always bake tilapia but never as good as this...I usually wrap in foil but placing it in a dish with foil on the bottom with butter spray is the way to go!  EXCELLENT and HEALTHY meal

I loved this dish! I followed the recipe and also drizzled a little white truffle olive oil over the top before I put it in the oven. It was so light and simple. The 25 minute time was perfect and I also used frozen veggies. I thawed the tilapia first. I would recommend this dish to anyone because it is so easy and it turned out great. Instead of butter you can use extra virgin olive oil to cut down the calories. The butter just gives it a savory feel so I really liked the butter. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

I don't like lemon so I omitted that and used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It was delicious, healthy and easy.  Even my picky husband cleaned his plate!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was both easy and delicious! I made rice to go on the side and it was such a simple, tasty supper! This is definately a keeper. I added bread crumbs to the top as suggested and that really added some texture to the fish. I also put parm cheese on top of the fish and veggies towards the end of cooking. Very good recipe thanks!

This dish was extremely simple and delicious. I just eyeballed the Old Bay, added Garlic powder, and since I did not have a fresh lemon on hand, sprinkled on lemon juice. I used someone else's idea to melt the butter and pour...I think this trick worked very well. My 3 kids ate up every last bit.

Loved it!!! Awesome, easy recipe! I changed it up just a bit. Instead of garlic salt I spread some minced garlic to the top of each piece of fish. I didn't add the frozen veggies either. But the fish was deeee-lish!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe! I will definately be making this again!!

Perfect easy recipe.  To make sure there is no "fishy" flavour, try soaking the fish in milk overnight while defrosting!

I have made this twice and it turned out great each time.  My kids liked it, too.  The only change that I made was I used fresh veggies. I think this will be something that I keep in my freezer all the time as a quick go-to healthy meal.

This was the first time I've ever cooked my own fish and turned out wonderfully!  I used grouper filets with olive oil and a little more Old Bay than the recipe called for.  I would definitely recommend this recipe for anyone just learning their way around the kitchen.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I baked mine in a 9X11 pan spraying it with cooking spray first.  I covered it with foil for 20 mins and took the foil off for the last 10 and it was perfect!  I used different seasonings but the key definitely is to use quite a bit of them.  I used a bit of salt and pepper along with onion powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and then I sprinkled just a little but of Parmesan cheese on top (making sure to season both sides).  Then I used about a tablespoon of bread crumbs and sprinkled it on top then sprayed it with low fat cooking spray.  So yummy!  Thanks for the tips!

Excellent!  I made this for tonight's dinner.  I did make a few changes.  I coated both sides of the fish with olive oil, then seasoned it with Old Bay and garlic salt along with parsley and layered some lemon slices over the top.  Then I bag of cauliflower and broccoli around the sides.  Baked for 30 minutes.  My husband said this is a keeper!

Really liked this recipe.  Very easy (especially since I had never prepared fish before).  I used zuchinni squash, broccolli & cauliflower.  Next time I'll use less lemon though as it mixed with the vegetables too much.

Had to rate a 3 because it's just a simple recipe, nothing special and over the top. I liked it, but my family did not. My husband put the fish on a corn tortilla and ate it with cilantro jalapeno sauce, like a fish taco, and it was good, but, overall a simple recipe. I used broccoli and cauliflower, that was the only change.

DEE-LICIOUS!!!  I made this for me and my boyfriend last night.  It was soo good!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a little more seasoning because I seasoned both sides of the fish.  I also used fresh veggies instead of frozen.  This recipe turned out moist and flavorful.  We have four tilapia filets left in the freezer and my boyfriend wants me to make this again tonight!  This recipe is easy easy easy, and healthy.  Clean-up was a snap because everything was baked in one baking dish.  Thanks for the recipe F_Gory!

I found this recipe yesterday at work and I'm in weight watchers and was looking for something light and tasty. I had all the ingredients listed except the lemon, so I just squeezed lemon juice on the fish fillets before baking. The meal was so good and satisfying! I wanted seconds and thirds but I have to control myself. I will be making this again in the very near future. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Awesome!  I used Pam instead of butter, dumped two bags of Green Giant steamers (rice and veggies w/buttery sauce) and a wee bit of chicken stock over the fish.  I didn't have any lemons, but didn't miss them at all. Covered with foil and baked for about 30 minutes.  It was even better the next day

I tried this recipe tonight, using the uncooked rice, cream of mushroom soup and frozen broccoli. I used Adobe seasoning also with the Old Bay on the fish. I topped the dish with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and broiled it for a few minutes to a golden brown. We loved it.  The rice didn't cook thoroughly, however, so next, I may partially boil the rice first before adding the cream of mushroom soup. Great recipe!

Made this tonight, super easy. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. My family loved it. I thought the seasonings were very light, could of used more Old Bay and garlic. Really really good though.

This is an excellent dish.  I melted the butter before spreading on top of the fish.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, then used sea salt and ground pepper.  It was melt-in-your-mouth good!

I was extremely liberal with the seasonings and used bird's eye Nomrandy blend for the veggies. This was by far the best tilapia dish I have made and wow! so easy. Thank you for a great recipe!

This fish melts in your mouth!  I am on a diet tho so i used fat free olive oil spray in place of the butter for greasing the pan and sprayed lightly on the fish.  Will definatly make this dish again.  I served with a side of sauted asparagus.

This was good. I replaced the lemon with lime juice and used black pepper along with the old bay seasoning. It cooked for about 20-25 minutes and was moist and tender.

I cooked this for my Boyfriend and 2 of my friends and they loved it! I didnt cook the veggies with it though i just did the microwave veggies so it would be ready quick. I also made some orzo pasta to go with it, and it was delicious. make sure you season both sides because I thought about not doing that but did it anyway and they came out perfecto!!!

The fish was very good and moist.  We had fresh-caught Tilapia, which took longer to cook.  I put much more spices than called for, which made it much better, in my opinion.

I made this recipe last night, I loved it.  I skipped putting the veggies around the fish and did some on the side but I followed  the rest of the recipe for the fish and  it came out great, I would make this again for sure, it was an easy week night meal.

Fantastic.  I'm new to fish and new to trying to eat healthy.  This is great.  I'll be making this at least once a week.

Super quick and easy. I pumped it up a little and was liberal with all the seasonings. Didn't have any lemon so left it out and it was still delicious. Will definitely make this again!

This is delish!  Made it last night subbing EVOO for the butter and cooked without the veggies.  I served with brown rice and snowpeas.  It was filling, light on the calories and SOOOO GOOOD!  Will definitely make again!

Easy, tasty way to prepare a rather bland fish!  I melted about 2 Tbs butter, added a bit of olive oil, and then mixed in a generous sprinkle of Old Bay, along with juice of 1/2 lemon.   I brushed this over both sides of the fish. I also had some shallots lying around, so I minced them and put them on top of the fish.  I did not add any additional salt, as Old Bay is full of it already!  Baked on 375 for 20 min covered, and then 10 min uncovered with some added panko, parmesan, and paprika.    Served with lemon slices, over steamed rice and fresh broccoli.  Great healthy weeknight recipe!

Excellent recipe! Followed it to the letter, except I used frozen tilapia and veggies. I let it thaw a bit before putting it in the oven, but it still only took about 25 minutes to cook. I will be making this again and again.

I was concerned that this dish wouldn't have any flavor given how easy it was, but the fish and the veggies were super delicious!  Definite bonus that it's healthy for you too.  Will add it to the regular fish rotation.

I never have leftovers when I fix this dish, and it's great for a night when you're in a hurry.  I like to use fresh veggies instead of frozen.  I typically use squash, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, bell pepper, onion, and eggplant, or whatever I have in the fridge.  I don't have old bay seasoning, so I always play around with herbs and put on whatever smells good to me at the time.  thyme, rosemary, oregano, and a little bit of chili powder for a kick is hard to beat.  the lemon adds a great kick at the end as well.  fabulous dish.

5 stars with more seasonings.  I followed the recipe closely, but added more seasonings, unfortunately it still needed flavor.  Really bump up the seasoning.  I lined my pan with foil and it made for super easy clean-up.  I prepped almost all of it the night before and just threw in the vegetables before putting it in the oven.  Will likely make again!  Thanks F_Gory!

I liked this! Didnt change much just added paprika and parsley. Also didnt have brocolli. My fish turned out perfect baked 375 for 20 mins. Dont care much for the veggies they did have a fishy taste to them but I think that may be why the fish turned out so good. My boyfriend said "This is the best tilapia you have made so far" and I make this fish alot. I eat fish once a week so this will be one recipe on the rotating fish list.

So easy! I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower. The fish tasted a little "fishy" but the lemon added really great flavor. Vegetables were delicious.

this was the Tilapia recipe i've been looking for. Me and my girlfriend loved it. The only thing I did different was to use fresh Broccoli instead of frozen mixed. I baked it at 375 f for about 25 minutes. I added the juices from the pan to some seasoned white rice for the perfect side. This was very easy to make and very healthy.

Some of the broccoli did come out a little brown, and the fish was a little burnt on the bottom.  Other than that, excellent recipe- everything tasted great, and it was very easy to cook!  Will definitely make again, with slightly shorter cooking time.

Very good, I followed the advice from a previous poster, used lots of butter, garlic, seasoning (not the old bay), salt & pepper...baked for 25 minutes with foil, then uncovered and topped with mozzarella, baked for another 10 minutes.....yummy!!!

Served this to a group of 10 and it was a huge hit.  Just seasoned the fish, covered and baked as directed.  Served with fresh asparagus and wild rice.  Excellent, easy, and healthy.

It was very good but I think I was too light on seasoning, etc. Should've used 2 lemon slices on each piece, more old bay, and doctored the vegetables some more, they were bland. Maybe some spray butter on them would've helped halfway thru cooking. Overall, a good recipe (love the red peppers in the mix), just dont be afraid to add a little more seasonings if you think you'd like it.

Easiest, yet tastiest recipe! I threw frozen tilapia filets (seasoned per the recipe) in with frozen brocolli and cooked for 30 minutes.  Fish was done perfectly and brocolli was not mushy.  Thanks!

I loved this! I used fresh vegetables (zucchini and asparagus) and substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder. Using fresh vegetables with the frozen fish proved to be no problem - it still took the same amount of time, and the vegetables were perfectly done! I also (as others noted) drizzled the fish and the vegetables with olive oil. I love how quick & easy this dish is! As others noted, be liberal with your seasoning, and enjoy!

I am new to eating fish, really dont like it but my new husband loves it and encourages it due to healthy. I made this recipe to surprise it and HE LOVED IT! He was so impressed with me! Even better, I liked it!! It was a little bitter for me, believe it was due to using lime instead of lemon, will use lemon next time. I will cook this again and again!

This was an alright recipe.  I thought it was a bit too bland.  I also recommend cooking the veggies seperate from the fish, the water from the veggies, made the fish watery and took longer to cook.

This was pretty average. The fish was a little bland.  But for a quick healthy meal, it does the job pretty well.

This is so delicious and so easy!! Fresh tilapia and a box of frozen peas with butter (yep, it's all already in the box). Spice it to taste - Old Bay, Lemon Pepper spice (instead of lemon juice). Pop this puppy in the oven, follow cooking instructions and it comes out perfect all the time. A simply great recipe!

I'm all for any meal that makes less dishes for hubby to do (heehee), and when they taste good, that makes them even better. I put my veggies in the fridge about 3 hours before I made dinner so they would be a bit thawed, and didn't have any problems with crunchy veggies. I also didn't have any Old Bay, so I improvised and used some paprika, onion powder, mustard powder, celery salt, and ginger. Hubby wasn't overly impressed, but he did clean his plate, and our 12 month old gobbled it up.

This was quite good. I misread the ingredients and somehow ended up using like 3 tablespoons of butter, but oh well. Certainly didn't hurt anything! I melted the butter and added everything to that and just drizzled over it. I didn't have any lemons, so I just drizzled some lemon juice on the filets. My filets were partially thawed and my veggies were totally frozen and everything was perfectly cooked in 25 minutes. Served with long grain & wild rice for a tasty, light dinner. Thanks :)

This was a great and easy recipe. I added some sliced onion slivers and tomatoes on top of the butter, and then sprinkled the fish with some dried basil. I didn't have any lemon, so I left it out. The hubby thought is was great too!

This recipe doesn't indicate that if you use only the amount of Old Bay stated, you will end up with a bland dish.  Very good, but bland.  Add more spices.  Also, one pound of tilapia won't feed four people unless there are side dishes.  I substituted a blend of red and yellow peppers and white onions, plus a can of mushrooms, in place of the vegetables suggested.  You can use any vegetables you want.

This was a very light fish and done perfectly. I didn't have to change or alter anything which is hard for me not to do. Very nice fish dish and great to serve for dinner guest. The flavor is outstanding for a light fish taste.

I made this dish last night and it was wonderful.  The fish got a little overcooked/dry because I left it on too long because the frozen veggies were still cold.  Next time I will use fresh veggies or steam them first.  This was really good.

Great recipe!  Easy prep and tasty.  Even without the lemon. I just used garlic and lemon flavored Old Bay.  Also used Adobo seasoning for a little extra flavor.  Easy to use many different variations of this recipe....and I will!

I love this recipe! I make it all the time. I only gave it four stars however because the vegetables were bland. I decided to drizzle some lemon juice on them as well and sprinkle some seasonings on to give them a bit of a kick.

Very simple and healthy.  My young children love it and request it.  If you aren't into Old Bay, it's so easy to use your own desired seasonings.

My husband loved this recipe.  I didn't have the frozen veggies though, so I used fresh carrots, onions, & celery.  It turned out tasty, but needed more salt.  Will definitely cook again though :)

My boyfriend says this was the best meal I have made EVER! I altered the recipe a little bit. I put lemon juice, I didnt measuree just what I thought was good, instead of Thyme I used Tony's Chachere. I am from Southern Louisiana so put this on everything, also added garlic salt and italian seasoning. I put onions on top of the fish as well, yumm. I didn't put the vegis in with the fish instead put it on the stove. I made risotto with this meal. It was a hit, I made it Tues and my boyfriend asked me to cook it again tonite, it's Saturday! Very easy and worth tyring.

Loved it, loved it.  Simple and healthy.  Never seen the kids gobble up fish that fast.  LOL  I actually never liked tilapia, but the seasonings made it just right.  (I used lemmon pepper seasoning instead of Old Bay) and I love the way the veggies were crisp after steaming with the fish for a half hour.  Yummy!!

This recipe was super easy and very good. My roommates loved it. I followed the recipe, but I also follwed some of the suggestions that was posted in the blogs by adding a bit more flavor with onion powder and the bread crumbs....excellent. I also cooked my veggies on the side instead of in the dish.

This is a very simple recipe that works out for me no matter what spices or vegetables I substitute. I like to add some ground cayenne pepper to the fish for some added spice and color. I also always cook this with one or two bay leaves and some fresh thyme.

This was really good.  I'm not a big fish fan but wanted to eat semi-healthy.  The seasonings were perfect, not overpowering.  I'll make this again I'm sure. Thank you!

This was...ok. I added A LOT of garlic as well as some italian seasoning and minced onion, and also topped with italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. It still came out bland. Next time, I will use a lot more garlic

Very tasty! Even more flavorful with a bit of cilantro and fresh veggies instead of frozen.  A winner - quick, healthy and yummy!

The fish was moist but lacking flavor.  I did add a bit of Paprika, but will likely try another recipe next time.  The good side though is that this recipe was super easy and quick, and not bad (just a bit boring).

This may be the best "bang for the buck" recipe I've gotten from Allrecipes.com.  Cheap, fast, easy, and easily our favorite fish dish.  I do what others have suggested by being more liberal with the spices and adding Paprika.  I also sprinkle some lemon juice over the fish and veggies.  My grocery doesn't have the right frozen mix of veggies, but they do sell a small bag of fresh brocolli/cauliflower that is the perfect size. I add sliced bell pepper to that. I really like the fresh veggies, and they really come out full of flavor in this recipe.

I've been looking for a good tilapia recipe and this one is a keeper! The fish came out very moist and tender. My husband and kids ate it all up. I did squeeze some lemon juice before baking. Next time I will definitely add more Old Bay.  Will make this once a week!  Thanks for a great recipe  :)

My husband would certainly give this 5 stars - he LOVES it.  It's a mystery to me - he's usually a meat and potatoes kinda guy!!  It has excellent flavor - I was liberal with the Old Bay.  I couldn't find the vegetable blend they recommended so I used Italian style mixed veggies - which were quite tasty.  This recipe is GREAT for a quick week night meal.

My husband and I both thought this was great...very flavorful but so easy! The only change that I made was to sprinkle lemon juice over the fish instead of the lemon slices as I didn't have a fresh lemon. Will definitely make this again!

i thought that this wasn't bad.  The rest of the family liked it a bit more then I did.  I added parmesian cheese to the top of the tilapia before I baked it.  I had to increase the cooking time quite a bit.  It was a very flaky dish.  I think next time I might try something with a bit more spice.  This was VERY mild.  Maybe a bit of white wine to this might help?  Thanks so much for the recipe!  I'll try it again with a couple of switches:)

This was good and easy.  I had to use what I had on hand which was only Broc/Caul mix without the peppers.  I also didn't have the Old Bay so I used another seafood seasoning.
I was not expecting that the vegetables cooked with the fish would come out well, but they did.  I did, however, have to increase the baking time by 15 minutes.  
Tasty recipe.  I may add some onion next time.

I usually do not care for fish unless it is battered or breaded but this was excellent. I love the spices and red peppers with the fish. I too did not have lemons so I used my spice lemon peel spread over it and veggies. I tried to stay as true as possible to the original recipe. I will make this. again!!

We usually flour & fry tilapia, but this brings out more of the taste. I substituted EVO for the butter & "Spike" for the Old Bay Seasoning.  Excellent, will certainly do this again. I liked the ease of using the oven and foil, and it will be a long time before I stand over a frying pan again.

This recipe was ok but next time I make it I think I’ll add more seasoning and lay the lemon beside the fish instead of on top. The vegetables were perfect!!

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I didn’t have fresh lemons so I substituted bottled lemon juice. Also, since Old Bay has quite a bit of salt in it I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. One other thing, I added raw onion rings to it.  I absolutely recommend it.

I might make it, but it sure sounds like that's way to long to bake. Fish only takes 10 minutes per inch to cook through. I would precook the veggies and probably bake about 15 minutes at the most. (As Gailmellina stated, it was dry! )

This recipe is wonderful and so easy! I use frozen broccoli and frozen tilapia, sometimes I add 10 minutes to the cook time to make sure it's done. Always feel super healthy and put together when I make this!

Good, but I will modify a bit next time.  I used foil & Pam for the pan instead of grease, and didn't add butter.  I will add just a dash of cayenne, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/8 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of salt, and only a splash of lemon juice.   I will also try with fresh vegetables instead of partially thawed frozen veggies.  I will stick to veggies on the sides of the fish or in a separate pan because veggies on the top made the fish not cook as quickly.  I will cover the pan and cook for 15-20 minutes, then add Parmesan and bread crumbs and cook for 15-20 minutes more with no cover.

I have been on Weight Watchers and this dish was perfect for my diet. I made this for friends and family one night and everyone liked it. It was flavorful, easy to make and only 1 WW point per serving.  I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely love this recipe. So easy and the whole family loves it. I add whatever frozen veggies we are in the mood for and have in the freezer. Even gave this to my daughter who just moved out, as an easy yummy recipe for her and her roommate.

This recipe was pretty good. What I enjoyed about it was the riced cauliflower that I cooked in the pan with it. It soaked up a lot of the flavor and became "fluffy." The other frozen veggies I baked with it took much longer to cook from frozen so I had to remove them and continue baking in another pan.

I love how easy it was to prepare! I only substituted the Old Spice for mixed spices local to my area, and used foil paper. Over the last 5-minutes, I removed the grill so it would become a little crispy. Delicious!

I love this recipe! The fish was flaky and the vegetables tender. I baked at 375* for 25 mins. However I forgot to cover it and it still came out perfect. (For weight watchers it’s a 0 point meal) So delicious I see myself making this a regular dish in my household! Thank you for this 5 star recipe!!!!

This is a fast, easy and delicious way to prepare tilapia and we loved it. The frozen vegetables kept the fish wonderfully moist while baking. I followed the recipe except for the following: I used tilapia loins instead of fillets (they're a bit thicker and stay moist better; I didn't have fresh lemons so I just splashed some lemon juice on.  Will definitely make this one again!

I made this and wasn't really too happy with it. I just didn't like the taste and such but my boyfriend loves it. I tend to buy my tilapia pre-seasoned so I am sure that is why.

This was an easy, simple, healthy recipe and very tasty. I didn't measure the seasoning, but I'm guessing it was more than just 1/4 tsp. I had a mix on hand of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots, so I used that instead. It was really good and everyone liked it. And it was quick, great for a weeknight. I would definitely make it again!

Ok, this was soo good, I made just a few changes. I had family coming over so wanted to bake fish and not fry it.1) I used a stick of butter with garlic and herbs from Publix, I microwaved this to melt it. 2) I used the Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder and lemon juice and  didn`t measure any of these, just used my opinion on how much. 3) I also used paprika (just for a little color as I didn`t have the smoked kind). 4) I mixed everything with the melted butter and then dipped all the tilipia in the mixture. 5) I sprayed a 9x13" pan and placed the fish in it. Any mixture left over I poured on top of the fish. 6) I covered the pan with foil and baked at 375 for abt. 26-30 min and it was so good even my picky sister (who only eats flounder) asked for more.
 I served this with steamed veggies and rice and there was leftovers on everything except the fish. This was so good, I will make it again and again. The marinade was outstanding, I was wondering if you could use it on different meats?

Used some Creole seasoning and it was delicious. Perfect texture and great balanced flavor with the lemon. The juice at the bottom created by the butter mixing with the juice from the lemons and seasoning was good and I poured it over th fish for added flavor. Also did not add veggies, but had a side salad instead.

I could not find broccoli and cauliflower with red pepper, so I used broccoli florets and mixed pepper slices.  
This was very disappointing.  The tilapia was bland and needed more seasoning.  If I were to cook this again, which I won't, I would increase the Old Bay and use regular garlic and Kosher salt.  Also, it needed to be cooked longer than 30 minutes.

Yes I will make it again... it was easy and very good. The only problem is, I need to figure out how to keep it warm moving from stove to plate... It cooled quickly but was wonderful overall.

I gave this recipe 5 stars even tho I modified it-let's face it: we all have our faves, right? So based on the fact that I like my veggies done, I put my layer of frozen veggies in the pyrex in the oven while I quick thawed the tilapia and assembled the remaining seasonings. I placed a layer of frozen snap pea pods on the veggies in the oven, layered the fish, sprinkled the seasonings including dill but no lemon (ugh), covered with foil, and baked 25 minutes.  I took the dish out of the oven, topped each fillet with maybe 1/8th tsp butter, and covered each filet with finely fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Five minutes longer in the oven the dish with the dish uncovered,  and it was delicious!

My family liked it. I made a double batch. I only had one pan with a cover so cooked one uncovered. The covered pan turned out great and the fish was moist. The uncovered pan had dry fish. This may be the mistake some have made where they claimed the fish was to dry. Make sure you have a cover before cooking this recipe.

I followed this recipe but added a few things that other reviews said.  I added the parmesan cheese at the end which just pulled it all together.  
Super yummy, my family loved it!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

As the title states, this recipe is easy. Oftentimes we are led to believe that the quality of a recipe is directly proportional to the amount of effort in said recipe. This recipe demonstrates that simplicity can lead to great results. The fish was flavorful and ended up being a hit!

This recipe has become a family staple at my house!  I've made it many times!  Sometimes with the veggies and sometimes I make the veggies separate.  It makes for a quick and easy meal when you don't have a lot of time.  My whole family gives it 5 stars!

I am not a fan of fish but this recipe has be craving this again! I did make things a little differently than the recipe calls for which is why I gave it 3 stars. I used tablespoon of butter instead of tsp (I like butter), I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and added pepper to the seasoning. I seasoned both sides, topped each (I only made two) with a tablespoon of butter and then cut a lemon in half, one half I used to squeeze juice on the fish and then the other half I sliced to put on it.  I completely missed the part about covering the dish but that actually didn't make a difference. The fish was absolutely delicious!

The fish was raw (even on a convection setting) and vegetables were cold.  Once cooked separately, it was good but wouldn't recommend the recipe.

I wanted an easy,  healthy way to fix tilapia.  My family got bored with the "usual 'recipe.  My son was disappointed that there wasn't enough for him to have seconds.  I did not have lemon,  so did without,  brushed a little olive oil on bottom of pan and on top of fish before adding the Old Bay seasoning. I used frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrot mix. I put everything in the pan this morning before going to work. My husband put it in the oven,  leaving the foil on the pan. I made brown rice as a side. I will definitely prepare this meal again.

Left out the cauliflower and added mushrooms.  I will make this again for sure, my wife and I loved it.  Next time I'll double the Old Bay and garlic amounts for a little more flavor.

Added turmeric and ginger seasonings to it only because they're good anti-inflammatory seasonings. Also used olive oil spray to make it healthier. Very good. I'll make it again ??

I make this pretty much according to the recipe, and I have made it many times! It is super tasty and super easy! The fish does not shrink, but stays plump and moist. My only change is that I use FRESH broccoli and/or cauliflower. They cook perfect. Frozen veggies will overcook.

Loved it. Garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I melted butter and poured over rather than dot. And I hate lemon so omitted that. DE-LISH-US. I found 15 minutes at 400 didn't dry out the fish as others commented.

This was really good. I made it for dinner last night and everyone loved it! I did bake it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and I also skipped the vegetables. I didn't have any garlic salt so I put on minced garlic and salt. I will make this again!

I only made the fish part of this recipe.  Also we didn't have the Old Bay's on hand so we used Chef Paul's seafood magic.  It was delicious.  I served with white rice and steamed asparagus.  The lemon was a good additive.  I will make it again, next time making sure to have the veggies so that I can make it exactly as instructed!

Pretty good recipe, very easy to make and play around with. I drizzled a little olive oil on the fish and added minced garlic and fresh chopped parsley. I baked it with asparagus and served it with brown rice and stewed tomatoes.

This was AWESOME!! The fish was so flakey and just fell apart. Prep was so easy and used minimal dishes to prepare so clean up was a snap. I will most definitely be making this a lot in the future.

Pretty good. Made this without the cauliflower, our brood doesn't like cooked cauliflower. Subbed orange slices for lemon.
Next time I'll put a little white wine and perhaps some orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice in the baking dish for extra flavor.

I was reading through the reviews, and I squeezed lemon juice over all of the fish, and I'm glad I did. This will be an easy go to recipe for tilapia, but it wasn't my favorite

This recipe came out perfect. Not only was it delicious, but it was so easy  to make and clean up.  I served it with some rice, but we really didn't need it. This recipe was perfect on its own. I'll be making this quite often.

I modified slightly because I didn't have garlic salt, so instead I used old bay, garlic powder, sea salt, lemon juice, and butter. It was ok but it still lacked in flavor; I barely tasted any seasoning.

I did make some changes. I used Cajun seasoning, dried parsley, a fresh red pepper, and frozen broccoli only (I really dislike cauliflower). The timing was definitely off for using frozen veggies. The fish was thawed and it still took 10 minutes extra (40 minutes total) on 375. I think I could have even left it in for a few more minutes. The freshness was great! It smelled fantastic and I think the lemon was a good choice. Next time I will add more seasoning including some fresh garlic. My husband loved it though :)

This was my first time making anything in this nature. It turned out great! My family killed it with no leftovers. The only thing I changed was removing the lemon an added lemon pepper seasoning instead.

This recipe turned out wonderfully!  I used 5 tilapia fillets that were mostly frozen, seasoned with lemon pepper and garlic, lemon slices and a few pats of butter. I had 2 bags of frozen Mexican style vegetables with cauliflower, broccoli, corn and red pepper, so I dumped them in the pan with the fish and seasoned with a little salt and garlic and a drizzle of EVOO.  I baked uncovered for 35 minutes and it was cooked to perfection!  I will be making this again with other mild white fish like sole or yellow tail.

This was really good....one of the best fish dinners ever, according to my husband.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not add the vegetables, I just cooked the fish.  The fish was moist and delicious after 30 minutes of baking.  This will definitely be made again.  Thanks!

I cooked about 45 mins, because when I checked at the 30 mins, the fish were still raw, adding more time made veggies too soft. But sill delicious!

This recipe was amazing. I added cayenne pepper and dill weed and didn't put on old bay because I didn't have any. It needs just a little cayenne pepper on each fillet.

My first time making it and I'm happy with it! I think I did add too much garlic salt though and might swap it out for celery salt next time and more lemon slices. All-in-all, I'm satisfied. Very yummy!

I couldn't believe how easy this was! I didn't have Old Bay seasoning or lemon (although I can't wait to get some and try it again), so I used some lemon pepper seasoning, and it turned out great! I also tossed the broccoli in just a little bit of olive oil before putting them in the pan with the fish. I'll  definitely be keeping this recipe.

Wasn't bad at all but not amazing or awsome but a great starting point for getting creative and making it better. That's why i love this site.
Besides the additions that some other reviews had i thought I would also add oregano. OMG. ..next time I will put more, it added a zing flavor to the tilapia that was just amazing!

I really liked this recipe.  I made a couple of changes like using olive oil instead of butter and tossed the broccoli with it too.  Used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and left off the lemon.  I added salt, pepper, nature's seasoning, paprika and some spicy seasoning for some zip.  Cooked it for an extra 5 minutes because the fish was large.  It was moist and delicious.....thanks for another great basic idea that I could add a twist to!

This recipe is amazing. I used Cajun seasoning instead and it turned out full of flavor and filling.

I've wanted to find a good baked tilapia recipe for a while; we usually fry it. This was a great recipe to use as a base. I didn't have those seasonings on hand so I used seasoned salt, basil and oregano instead. I also used fresh instead of frozen vegetables.

YUMMY & EASY! I cut the recipe in half (using two filets & a 10oz bag of veggies). Didn't have lemon so I brushed the tilapia lightly with a lemon infused olive oil prior to adding seasoning. Threw in a bag of frozen seasonal veggies & wahlah! 25 min later, tender & flavorful meal. Turned out GREAT!

I don't eat fish but I am not opposed to making it for those near and dear to me. I tend to stick to one or two salmon recipes but my boyfriend prefers white fish so I had to scour the web. This recipe was extremely easy to follow. I was able to purchase two fillet at my local Publix for $4.50.  I didn't measure anything but I did use a non stick spray in a glass baking dish and I sprinkled the Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder (didn't have garlic salt) over the fish until it was lightly covered. I put a dab of butter on each piece and then placed thinly sliced lemon on top and baked as directed. This fish created no odor at all while baking which was an amazing plus for me. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed mixed veggies.

I'm definitely not a fish person, but was looking for a healthy dinner option for me and my husband. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to prepare and how it didn't have the fishy taste or smell! Substituted the butter for olive oil and had to tweak the cooking temp and time because of a smaller pan (2 qt pan with rounded bottom baked at 400 for 1hr) but it's turned out well the 3 times I've made it! Paired with steamed asparagus and served it over brown rice.

Really simple and easy to make. Substituted Cajun seasoning for the old bay; garlic powder and salt for the garlic salt; and lemon juice instead of lemon slices. Used a vegetable medley for veggies, paired it all with mashed potatos and it came out perfect. Definitely a keeper

This recipe was fantastic!  My whole family loved it.  We used a different variation of frozen vegetables with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, soy beans, water chestnuts, etc, but I think you could mix this part up easily and often with great results. I usually don't follow recipes to the letter, but I did this time.  No need to change up the seasonings.  The fresh lemon slices are what truly made this Awesome.

This was quite tasty and so easy to make.  With our busy lives I am always searching for something quick and healthy and this fit the bill perfectly.  I didn't have the right spices the recipe called for and instead used Mrs. Dash Garlic Pepper and a little Herb de province. The veggies were still stone cold in spots after 25 minutes but the fish was perfectly done.  I scooped them out, zapped a minute in the micro and put them back in with the fish.  The presentation was beautifully bright with the veggies and lemon.  My husband and son had two helpings while my picky daughter worked her way through one helping.  We will have this again, especially on a busy day. Thanks for the recipe!

My first time ever making fish at home, and first time ever having tilapia... Recipe was great! I added a little olive oil base to the pan, and heavily seasoned with garlic powder and Old Bay, and a little lemon juice. Great taste!

This recipe is perfect as is.  I change very little but will substitute the frozen veggies I happen to have on hand. It's great with California Blend, and my personal favorite is plain old Brussels sprouts. Kudos to you, F Gory, this is one of my all-time favorite standbys!

I had to substitute the tilapia with carp. That's all we got down here. I didn't use any of them veggies. I left the heads on mine (tastes better.) I substituted a fire for my oven. I have a flat piece of metal that I use in the fire to fry the fish. I substituted that for a pan. It came out great! Five Stars.

I did not care for this recipe. Baking the lemon with the fish made it taste bitter.

The taste is good. I have made several times exactly per recipe.  I think I need to try cooking it uncovered. The fish sometimes is mushy.  Kids love it... When it is not mushy :)

Oh My Gosh this was wonderful and easy to make!! Both my boys turned their nose up when they heard I was making fish, but polished off their plates and were sniffing around for seconds!!!  Served the fish and veggies (I used stir fry blend) over unconverted white rice and it was wonderful!!!

Not amazing, just ok. Cooking time took twice as long, bland flavor, and was very watery due to the frozen vegetables. Was healthy, though. Won't be making this again.

Very easy and tasty. Made gluten-free macaroni and cheese as the side. Got compliments from the family, and I felt very pleased with it myself. I didn't have the lemons or spices called for, so I used Mrs. Dash and Lemon Pepper instead. The frozen veggies already had some Italian seasoning on them, so that added to the flavor as well.

I made this with cauliflower and broccoli  surrounding the fish.  I used extra old bay seasoning and added paprika. I did not have lemon so I used lemon pepper seasoning.  I put the seasoning on the fish and vegetables. I thawed the frozen vegetables.  Stuck it in my toaster oven for 35 minutes.  Absolutely yummy!!!  This will be my talapia recipe from now on.  I can wait to have this again.  Like some of the other reviews stated, the topping kind of slid off of the fish.

Delicious!  I used frozen string beans instead of broccoli, drizzled a couple of teaspoons of olive oil over the fish, and used Lawry's season salt (don't like Old Bay) and it turned out great.  I am not a big fan of fish, but this recipe turned out so well the first time that I am adding it to my family's meal rotation.

This is my favorite fish and love the recipe because it was nice and simple. I had to make some changes because my fish wasn't done in 25 minutes. 
I had some shrimp left in the freezer so I put that in the baking dish with the tilapia. I cooked it for 25 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered and it was done. Everything was good. I will cook again

Very good recipe.  I used fresh veggies including carrots.  After 25 min. I took lid off and broiled for a few minutes.  Then plated fish and cooked veggies in microwave for 2 min so the carrots were cooked.

Delicious and easy!!  I will definitely make this again; the fish was  moist and flavorful.  I did not add the veggies to the dish because I feel like they would have had a "fishy" flavor, so I cooked up some veggies on the side.  Still, I really liked the flavors in this easy baked fish recipe.  Thanks!

This was my first time cooking Tilapia! I didn't have frozen veggies so I just did the fish in the pan and it came out great! I placed a little butter on top of each fish and then seasoned it per the recipe - no measuring. It did take a full 30 minutes to cook (not 25 minutes) but came out really well! It wasn't NEARLY as hard as I thought it was going to be! Definitely will do this one again!

I made this tonight and the lemon rind was apart of the seasoning which is something I personally did not expect or want because it gave my fish a bitter taste, so it didn't turn out as good as I hoped. I gave this dish 4 stars because I can see (taste) the potential. The next time I make this, I will be sure to cut the rind completely off first or just use fresh lemon juice. I should have known better, but I followed the recipe to see what kind of difference it made. It was edible enough for me and my daughter to eat, and to me that's all that counts, but I will make the proper adjustments to rid the fish of bitterness. As far as the seasonings, it's basic, but you adjust according to your taste. Hope this helps =^)

This was a big hit at our house.  Everyone loved it.  So easy, too.  I didnt have the seasonings it called for so I substituted lemon pepper and it was good.  I sprayed the bottom of the pan with olive oil Pam and used Brummels & Brown spread instead of butter.  Broccoli was the veggie I used.  My youngest even ate her broccoli and loved it.

I wIld give this recipe 5 stars ! Since  we don't care for old bay seasoning and try to cut down on the salt, i used garlic powder. I used the frozen vegetable mix with carrots and the casserole is very pleasing to the eye. i sprinkle a little vegetable seasoning (chef paul's ) on the veggies. will be making this again soon. i do think fresh tilapia is best to use.

So easy, and so good. Only minor changes for what I did not have. Served with brown rice, turnip greens, blackeye peas, cornbread sticks, and a big ole pitcher of sweet tea. Absolute southern delicious heaven ! Thank you !

Very delicious meal... it is necessary for a good flavor to GENEROUSLY add the Old Bay Seasoning.  Also, the cooking time allowed wasn't nearly enough to actually warm the frozen vegetables all the way through or cook the fish.  It took about twice the time.  I also added bread crumbs during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  While eating I realized that the vegetables touching the lemon were amazingly delicious and I will be adding lemon juice to the veggies next time.  Also, the veggies were really bland, so I think I'll spice them up a little more than just salt and pepper.

Will make again for sure!

I used frozen ingredients (fish and vegetables) and it did add about 15 minutes to the cooking time but who cares!  It's like a fix and forget it meal.....so easy and very good.

Probably the best tilapia our family has enjoyed - especially since it is so easy to prepare.  Will definitely make again often.

fish turns out great every time, frozen veggies just can't compare, but I think that's what makes the fish stay tender and moist

This is such a great recipe - I was even able to get my boyfriend - who hates fish - to eat it! We replaced the frozen veggies with fresh asparagus, so naturally we added it to the pan about halfway through the recommended cook time so it wouldn't be limp and soggy.

This is my go-to recipe for tilapia loins! My whole family loves it and it is so quick and easy. To make it fit into my diet restrictions a little better, I use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray (with olive oil) instead of butter. I also put the lemon slices under the fish on the bottom of the pan so I can top them with about 2 tbsp. of an equal mixture plain and lemon pepper panko crumbs, then mist the tops again with the ICBINB spray. Take the foil off with about 5 minutes left in the cooking time to allow the crumbs to crisp a bit and voila - Deliciousness!

This was a very refreshing dish.  As with most of the other reviewers, I changed it up just bit.  I prepared the fish, then served with brown rice.  I also sprinkled just a tad of parmesean cheese on the fish about two minutes before it was done.  Delicious.  So glad to find a simple, great tasting reciepe.

This recipe was delicious!  However, i was a little too liberal with the spices and it ended up being too spicy (never used Old Bay before).  Good news is, I was able to scrape some of it off and it tasted much better.  The fish was good, but I was more impressed with the way the veggies turned out.  The blend of lemon with the butter and spices made an amazing sauce for them and they tasted out of this world!  

I did partially thaw everything and used butter spray as opposed to real butter.  Other than that the spices remained the same as well as the time it took to cook it.  Will make this again, only go easy on the spices.

So easy, and to change things up, try using a sliced lime instead of or in addition to, the lemon.  Easy & perfect every time!

I love this recipe. I have made it twice since I found it. It is perfect. I did amend it because of lack of supplies but it is still amazing. I swear I may make it once a week. I am also going to try it with boneless skinless chicken breasts. :D

Super simple, quick and easy. Even the kids loved it. I substituted fresh garden veggies for the bag of frozen vegetables - carrots, broccoli, and zucchini. And I used Mrs. Dash citrus herb seasoning instead of the Old Bay.

This was so delicious and easy! I used extra virgin olive oil as someone suggested , and I didn't measure the spices, but a used a pretty liberal  amount of Old Bay, garlic salt, pepper, and parsley flakes, mixed them all together and brushed them on the fish(then added more old bay)!Soooooo good!

Would have been great as a stand alone recipe...but we made a surf 'n' turf meal with the jalapeno steak from this site, and that just eclipsed everything (it was delicious!). Next time I'll make this on its own with milder accompaniments. The Old Bay seasoning gave a nice flavor. Thanks!

I am a rookie at fish - both eating and making.  This was very easy and tasted wonderful!  I did not have lemon and used just the frozen broccoli that I had on hand.  The broccoli was as good as the fish!  I will make again for sure.  Thank you for sharing.

Easy and delicious.  I use frozen veggies that DO NOT include broccoli or cauliflower.  It takes too long to cook the veggies and overcooks the fish.  So a bag that includes corn, green beans, carrots, etc works better.  I also put the veggies in the fridge the day I'm going to fix this dish so they are a little defrosted.  I bake it for 30 minutes.

Eh - it was okay....served with brown rice.  We were all hungry an hour later.  LOL.  Prepared exactly as suggested....I maybe would have squeezed lemon on everything and then laid slices on it.

Awesome Recipe! I used olive oil instead of butter, added parsley & my veggie mix was- broccoli, cauliflower & carrots. Partially thawed the frozen veggies as other reviewers suggested. Served with wild rice. Extremely easy & healthy, I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. Even the kids liked it and they don't usually like fish. I think I baked it a little too long, it did get just a little dry but it was still very tastey.

I did what one reviewer suggested: make a base of olive oil and add garlic powder, Old Bay seasoning, dried parsley (I omitted the seasoned salt) and spread on the fish. Then lay a lemon slice and sprinkle with fresh lemon juice. It was good! It lacked a kick, but my picky husband liked it. I did not make the suggested veggies; instead, I served it with rice on a bed of fresh spinach.

Didn't really love this, but I was sparing with the salt, which made it too salty for me.  Stick to the recipe measurements.

Good, but I've gotta agree with everyone else that this is bland.  I used at least 1 tsp of Old Bay and next time will probably use more.

Made this for my husband, as I am not a fish eater and he said it came out great.  He really enjoyed it.  My favorite part was how easy it was to make.  It was very little effort, i will definately keep this recipe on hand as its so quick to make on busy nights.  thanks !!

Good recipe that you can alter to your liking.  I added more Old Bay.  I am also dieting right now so I used butter spray instead of butter.  I also used fresh broccoli and cauliflower.  I started cooking my fish frozen because I forgot to take it out before I went to work.  So after cooking for the alloted time and at the temperature in the recipe I actually turned the heat up to 425 and cooked an additional 15 minutes.  That way the veggies cooked and the fish was done.  I don't even like tilapia and this was really good.  Be sure to add additional seasoning because the portions in the recipe may note be enough to your liking.

Yummy! I really don't care for the flavor of tilapia so I used white roughy instead and it was delicious!  I did not add any frozen veggies, but used all the seasonings as indicated and the fish was delicious.  I made a simple tartar sauce on the side with mayo, lemon juice and diced dill pickles.

This was the nest recipe I evr tried. I did almost everything, except i Used Everglades Seasoning instead of Old Bay. And I also added lemon juice instead of the whole lemon. Lastly i melted butter and olive oil together,then finished it with grated Parmesan and Bread Crumbs. It was so delicious. My family loved it. Way 2 Go!

Wow! I needed a quick low calorie talapia recipe and up came this one. Followed it exactly and it is outstanding!  It was tasty, with a  little bit of kick with the seasoning. We were very pleasantly surprized with how good this recipe is.  Thanks for a new keeper!

Excellent!  I loved the tilapia and vegetables. Unfortunately I followed a reviewer's suggestion to add uncooked rice and cream of mushroom soup.  If you like crunchy rice, great, but I don't, so will not include the rice next time.  Compliments to the contributor.

Excellent!!   We used spray butter on both sides, and the rest of the recipe to a "T", and was fantastic!    Made this a few times now, and everyone loves it,  thanks!!

This came out very tasty. I did alter it a bit. I added 1tsp butter and 1 1/2 tsp olive oil. I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp minced garlic. 1/2 tsp old bay seasoning and scapped the lemon. was very good

this was fantastic! Super easy to throw together and really moist. I made the veggies seperately, melted the butter and baked for 20 minutes and then added grated parmesan and breadcrumbs and put it back in the oven until the breadcrumbs were brown. I'll definitely make this again, thanks!

My fam loved it and requested it the next day.  I did add parmesan cheese and bread crumbs to the top. I didn't add the veggies and served with sauteed spinach instead.  Will definetly try the veggies in the pan next time.

This was only ok, not bad, but not good. I added extra seasoning, etc. but it was still pretty bland. A bummer since I really like tilapia. Probably won't make this again.

It was really good.  I only made two fillets with it and it worked since I am the only one who eats fish in my house.  It was perfect for dinner and lunch the next day.  I took a whole lemon and cut it up and put two slices on both fillets and then squeezed the rest of the lemon on the tilapia and it turned out really good.

I eat fish all the time, and to me, this recipe was mediocre.  It could use a little more seasoning.  Even so, the seasoning doesn't make it "the best fish I've ever had," as so reviewers have mentioned.  This recipe, to me, is just okay.

I really hate the taste of tilapia, but it's cheap and easy to prepare, so I usually look for recipes that cover up the taste of the fish.  I could still taste the tilapia's fishy, dirty flavor in this one, but I still give it 5 stars for ease of prepration and cost of ingredients.  Plus my husband liked it, so that makes it a keeper.  I'll just add more garlic and lemon next time and that will probably help, for me.

This one gets 5 stars just for the sheer ease of it.  I did just the fish and it was so easy and turned out great.  I didn't have any Old Bay, so I used McCormick seasoning for chicken and fish, and it was perfect.

I was pretty excited about how easy this sounded.  I don't get home from work until 6:30, so throwing frozen veggies in a pan with fish, spices, and lemon and having a meal 30 minutes later sounded great!  But the frozen veggies just don't cook at the same rate that the fish does.  After 45 minutes I took it all out and had to microwave the veggies the rest of the way so they would be edible.  Yes, the flavor of the fish was good--but it's not exactly groundbreaking news that Old Bay, garlic powder, and lemon makes for good fish.  If I were to make this again, I would follow the advice of other reviewers and thaw out the veggies first.  I just wish the recipe had said to do that in the first place.  As written, I was pretty disappointed.

I increased the spices, and swapped out the vegetables. I used kale, but will try baby carrots next time. I seasoned the veg with salt, pepper, old bay, and lemon juice. This was easy and healthy, and I will make it again.

This is an excellent recipe. Effortless preparation, and easy one dish clean up. More important than either of these things, the result was light, flavorful fish with just the right amount of seasoning and the vegetables pick up a subtle lemon flavor. The better half has never cared much for tilapia, but really enjoyed this and ate a double serving.

My family loved this recipe.  The tilapia turned out great!  I made it with Broccoli with Red Peppers- which is also an AllRecipes dish- and mashed potatoes.  My husband loved it and wants me to make it again soon!!  Very healthy and tasty.

EXCELLENT!  Use a little more butter and a little more lemon than called for.  I'd think two lemons, one sliced for fish and one squeezed over all (fish and veggies) would be perfect!

Like other users I did not make this dish as described, but it was an inspiration :) AND it took LITERALLY ten minutes to throw it all in a dish. Took about 35 minutes to bake, but who cares?! I didn't have to do anything else to it! My alterations: -2 filets of something I had in the freezer, so probably not tilapia -I used lemon juice instead of lemons -fresh broccoli and a chopped roma tomato -some fish spice from World Market..... YUMM!!!

Delish!  I often make fried fish, but was trying to get a bit healthier, so tried this and the whole (very picky) family loved it!  Will definitely make it again!  After the veggies were done, I stirred them in some rice made with chicken broth for a great side dish!

Great recipe. I used frozen tilapia so I had to cook for about an hour and the veg's got really soft, which is fine because my 1 year old needs them soft anyway.  My 14yr old son (Pickiest eater ever) loved the fish.  Will definitely make again and again

I made this dish and followed the recipt pretty closely.  I used diced garlic since I didn't have garlic salt and it turned out wonderfully.  I also substituted the lemons for lemon juice because I was out of lemons.  It's a great mix of flavors and the vegetables also took on some of the flavor, although I did shake some Old Bay seasoning on to them as well.

I loved how easy this was to prepare. I didn't have any lemon, so I drizzled some lemon juice on top. I also melted the butter and drizzled that along with the spices on top. During the last few minutes of baking, I topped the fish with some French Fried Onions. Everyone loved it!

Super easy recipe to follow.  I omitted the vegetables and subbed olive oil for the butter.  Also added bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese during he last 10 minutes of baking.  My husband rarely eats fish that isn't fried or prepared in a restaurant.  He loved this dish and asked for another serving the following night.

DEElish!!  My 13 yr old devoured it.  My husband loved it.  My daughter is still not a fish convert  -- yet.  I even put some cooked and cleaned shrimp in baking dish and added the same seasonings.  That tasted yummy too!  Have made Tillapia twice and will definitely add to my roster.  Very EASY TO MAKE!!

This recipe was delicious! I did everything the same except...I slightly boiled a fresh red pepper and added it to a Couliflower and Broccoli blend. I think some of the Old Bay sprinkled on the veggies would add flavor. Other than that...terrific!

This was the tastiest and easiest recipe I have ever made for tilapia.  My husband who really does not care for fish at all completely cleaned his plate.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a small amount of coarse bread crumbs to the top of the fish during the last several minutes of cooking time,which added a bit of crunch.  EXCELLENT!!

This recipe was very easy and tasted great! I am trying to cook healthier for my family and introduce new foods to them. This was my first time making fish and everyone loved it. I did add extra seasonings and lemon. I also cut out some of the butter. I did not use the vegs. I made other things my family likes and I will be preparing this again!

This was really good and simple to make.  I seasoned both sides of the fish and half way through baking I poured out the melted butter and juices.  I served this with couscous and corn.  I will def be making this again!  Next time to make it healthier I might skip on the butter.

This was very easy and very good.  I made it without the vegetables, just because I had other plans.  I served it with roasted garlic cauliflower from this site and butter and herb rice a roni.  Kids (1 and 3) and adults liked it and it was a healthy meal.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was perfect for a person like me who was brought up in Japan where people eat fresh fish and are more health conscious. it was easy to prepare and the tilapia tasted great, but I needed to add little more lemon juice and spice.

It was ok in my humble opinion. This is one that you definitely need to add or omit spices to your Individual liking.  I think the fish & veggies would have come out better baked in an open container. To much water in the dish from the frozen veggies. I will make again at some point and try adjusting to our taste preferences. Sorry.

Just made this tonight. I didn't have a lemon so I just used lemon pepper and it worked just fine. Easy, simple, and delicious!

Very good tilapia recipe! I made it almost exactly as written, other than sprinkling the veggies with some parmesan cheese after baking. I served it with brown rice. Very healthy and tasty!

This was such an amazing recipe, I followed every step! The one thing I added/changed was that after everything was in the baking pan (fish filets and frozen mixed veggies) I added fresh diced mushrooms on top - only because I had some in my fridge that needed use, but this turned out wonderful in the recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!

I just finished making this for my 4 year old daughter (everyone else was having a blackened tilapia sandwich for lunch) and she finished it all. Since it was only one serving, I put everything in foil and folded all the ends to seal in the steam. Baked it @ 325 for 25 mins. Came out tender, flaky, and perfect. The only thing different I did to the recipe was sprinkle a little bit of dried oregano and thyme to the fish and squeezed lemon juice over the entire foil package. Smelled and tasted Wonderful!

Great Recipe.  Mostly followed, but used butter, Old Bay, Lemon Pepper fish rub by McCormick, lemon slices and baked without the veggies.  Turned out excellent, my husband who hates fish even liked it :)

This was good, I took the advice of several people. Didn't add veggies. Made rice and green beans on the side. Added lemon juice, will add more next time. Sprinkled spices over top will add more next time. Cooking took about 25 mins (I used frozen fish).

Good, easy dinner. I will not use the lemon next time and will put a little more Old Bay on it. I'm not a big fan of lemon on my fish but wanted to try the recipe as is first time around. I also used fresh broccoli and cauliflower and it came out just right. Will make again.

This was a great basic recipe, especially since I am cooking for one!  I added more ingredients to it.  I melted the butter (like another reviewer suggested) then mixed in Old Bay, lemon juice, fresh parsley, minced garlic, pepper, sea salt, paprika, and cinnamon. I am usually a stickler for measuring, but since I was only cooking one piece, I just eyeballed to taste. I poured/spread the mixture over the fish. With 10 minutes left, I added some bread crumbs and Parmesan.  When it was done, I switched to broil to crisp the top for a minute or two.  I also had a problem with the veggies being overdone, so I may add a little later in the cooking or cook separately next time.

4 stars for a great base recipe, here's my modifications:

Use heavy duty aluminum half sheet instead of baking dish

used whole fresh tilapia, small ones @ 1 lb each, scaled myself

extra garlic, extra old bay, added bay leaves

buttered pan, clean gutted fish, season with salt and old bay on both sides and insides. Layed on buttered pan on top of grated garlic, more old bay, lemon slices, more old bay on top of lemon slices. Arranged fresh carrot medallions, broccoli heads and cauliflower around fish and seperated from each other, carrots on sides, broc on top and bottom, etc. Oiled and salted (lightly) entire pan, wrapped in foil and sealed with one hole punctured at a corner for steam. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes and was done. Fish tender and flavorful, veggies just done, had wonderful flavored pan drippings to spoon on veggies.

Very good taste but not nearly cooked at prescribed time shown and temperature. This may have been due to the fact that I overloaded the baking dish and had veggies on top of the fish. Once done though very good taste.

I normally don't like baked fish but this was delicious. I made this twice once with the lemon slices and once without my personal preference is without. I also add alot more oldbay and garlic salt than called for otherwise you can't taste it. I  baked this with fresh broccoli and baby carrots. Great quick weekday meal.

I modified the recipe. I used another seasoning mix. I made the fix 5 times, 1 of those times I used peas and corn on top of it! Delicious. Another time - corn and bell peppers! Superb! Great recipe. Tried red snapper in place of tilapia - yuk! Smelled way too fishy.

This recipe was good, but the fish cooked out too much water. However, the seasonings were just perfect. I also decided to melt the butter and then put the seasonings on top and it came out quite tasty. I will use this recipe again.

Very light, easy meal. I added paprika and a small amount of dried tarragon to the fish before baking. Served with baked broccoli and carrots, with a side of rice. 

Bachelor friendly.

My family is trying to learn to eat fish, and this recipe was a hit with everyone, including my 5 year-olds.  My husband, as a rule, hates lemon, but the lemon in this dish was subtle enough that even he enjoyed it.  A definate keeper.

As the other reviewers have said....this is one of the best fish dishes I've ever made.  I used fresh broccoli and cut up carrots and sprinkled all around the fish.  They came out perfectly steamed.  My family loved this dish so much that I made it two nights in a row!

Very easy, quick and fool proof. So easy you really don't need to measure ingredients out. Although I'm not a HUGE fan of fish, this has become a regular in our house, my bf requests it all the time!

so easy to make and very tasty.  It is so refreshing to find a healthy meal that actually tastes amazing.  The only thing I did differently was omit the veggies and made rice on the side with a side salad instead.

I had never tried tilapia until I tried this recipe. I had decided I needed to introduce fish into my diet. This recipe definitely helped! Thanks!

This was good and healthy.  I made a few changes; I ended up using a grill season for chicken instead of the Old Bay seasoning.  They didn’t have it at the store I was at and I’ve never even heard of it so maybe it’s not as common on the west coast.  I also used a couple of squirts of olive oil instead of butter and used 3 slices of lemon on each piece of fish.  It was so easy I’m sure I’ll be making this on a regular basis.

Easy to prepare, packs a lot of flavor.  I also substituted lemon juice for the slice of lemon and used a bit more seasoning.  I will be making this again.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I used frozen cauliflower and broccoli.  I also omitted the butter and used a can of cream of broccoli soup.  Served over egg noodles, this was a great comfort food with wonderful flavor.

This recipe was so good and tasty and the best part: super simple from prep to cleanup; it was a little bland so I added extra old bay seasoning and plenty of minced garlic.

Yummy.  I don't even know if I like Tilapia (I like fish like Salmon and Tuna) but I made this recipe and loved it.  My husband also enjoyed.  And it was so easy to make! I was pretty liberal on the old bay and the garlic salt and probably doubled or tripled the butter (I put a few slices on each piece).  I also dribbled some lemon juice in addition to putting the lemon slices on top.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I love the mild flavor of Tilapia!  The veggies and rice melded nicely with the fish.  Hubby was a little miffed that I made fish for dinner (he's a fish hater), but he said it was alright for fish.  I'll be making this one for lunches for myself.  Umm. Umm. Good.

I made this tonight and although it ended up tasting ok, it took about an hour to cook.  The veges were still partially frozen after 45 minutes so I took off the foil and put it under the broiler till it was done.  My husband thought it was rather bland and said I should have added breadcrumbs to enhance the flavor a bit.  On the upside, my teenage daughter who hates seafood loved it so I guess I will try it again and maybe I will add some breadcrumbs, it couldn't hurt!

I was never much of a fish lover, but my husband is and he just made this dish for dinner, it was EXCELLENT!  I love it!  We will certainly have this dish again and again.  The only thing he didn't do was put veggies in the pan, just the fish, he steamed carrots and served it w/ wild rice.  Very Good!

This recipe was excellent.  I think people need to realize that this is a very mild tasting meaty fish (for those that said it was bland).  Tilapia is my favorite fish, so I already knew the 'original' taste.  My brother and father loved this recipe, and I am an absolute horrible cook!  They were very impressed and ate it as fast as I took it out of the oven.  If you are a tilapia fan, this is highly recommended.  This tastes like the restaurant!

I made this last night for dinner and it was wonderful.  So easy!! The veggies did not taste fishy at all.  That was my biggest worry.  I brought the leftovers for lunch today at work.

I made this with a little over a half of a pound of tilapia, didn't measure the spices (just eyeballed it), and used fresh cauliflower only instead of the frozen mix. I also didn't use the lemon (personal preference). Since I wasn't using frozen veggies or the full amount of fish I only baked it for 17 minutes. It was really very good! A great way to cook tilapia!

This tilapia recipe is awersome. It is very light and super easy to make. My weeknight favourite. I change the spices from time to time to give a different flavor to the dish, and it never gets boring.

I love this recipe! It really couldn't be easier! I didn't measure the spices - just sprinkled a bunch on - and it was so delicious. Even my 2-year old gobbled it up and asked for more.  I will be making his often.

This was amazing. It was so mild. It had an excellent flavor to it. The vegetables turned out perfect as well. I fixed mashed potatoes with this and it was an excellent contrast.

It was pretty good, but not as much flavor as we like.  I like the broiled tilapia parmesan better. It was very easy to prepare, but was lacking some kick.
