It was OK, but lamb and sauce were just 'ok', nothing special. Granted maybe I went wrong somewhere in the ingredients or prep. I'll look for a different lamb recipe next time.

Excellent. Did steps 1-3 as written, switched to the slow cooker. Removed shanks before refrigerating overnight, then followed the rest of the instructions as-is.  Thanks, Chef John!

This was Excellent!!! I followed the directions exactly & the lamb was fork tender, juicy & wonderfully delicious with the spring onion mashed potatoes & a side salad. I did remove the fat, as noted in the video, which cut down on the strong lamb taste. However, our carrots came out very mushy because of all the cooking. (Won't be taking any stars away - the greatness far outweigh the mushy carrots!) Will adjust the next time I make this in about 3 weeks for family that is in town. Can't wait!

I use All Recipes quite frequently for ideas at the restaurant I work at.  Was recently thrust into the Executive Chef position, which the bar was set pretty high from previous Chef.  I use Chef John's recipes quite often and get nothing but great reviews from our customers.  This recipe was no exception, 5 stars across the board.  Thanks Chef John.
