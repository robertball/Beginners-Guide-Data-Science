Very easy to prepare. Cost was rather high due to all of the various juices necessary. Flavor was good but very weak - probably would have been stronger if the chicken was marinated in the juices for some time before cooking.

I made a few changes and thought this turned out pretty good. To the juice mixture I added a small onion and a dash of garlic powder; I marinaded the chicken all night and all day (cut some slashes in the chicken to absorb more flavor). Then when grilling we brushed with the juice every so often. I cut it into strips and served over brown rice; the tropical flavor was definitely there!

Had I read the reviews before making this I wouldn't have tried it and the reviews were correct....this recipe has absolutely NO flavor. I even marinated the chicken in this for 2 1/2 hours before cooking. I'd have rather saved all my ingredients and cooked a plain chicken breast that's how little flavor this had.

I was hoping for more flavor. I did let it marinate for about an hour but it still did not have enough flavor for us.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't a hit either.
