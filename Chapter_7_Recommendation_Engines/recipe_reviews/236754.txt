Very good classic saskatoon pie filling. I changed the number of servings from 24 to 8 because I only wanted to make one 9 inch pie. It was the perfect amount with a couple of tablespoons left over to top 2 yr old Grand Daughters vanilla ice cream. Grand Daughter loved it.  Mom and dad thought the pie was awesome and I can apparently make another one sooner than latter. I enjoyed it on toast and aged cheddar cheese. I would definitely make this again and pass the recipe along. Thanks so much, as Saskatoon recipes are hard to come by just like the berries.

I adjusted the ingredients for one pie.  It was delicious. I will cut back on the sugar by 1/4 C. I found it quite sweet. I used a frozen pie shell.
