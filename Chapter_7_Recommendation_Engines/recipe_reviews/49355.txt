I LOVE a good gin and tonic! Maybe it's the English in me coming out. This is a definite classic! An oldy but a goody. Go for a good quality gin and don't add the extra lime juice, keep it clean and simple. I do like the lime garnish though - Cheers!

The gin and tonic...  Two ingredients that many folks love to hate!  I, however, enjoy the flavor of gin, and I'm learning to appreciate tonic water.  I recommend staying away from diet tonic, though!  Yuck!  A good rule of thumb is 1 part gin to two parts tonic.  Add a squeeze of lemon (or lime, if you prefer).  I think the tablespoon of lime juice and wedge of lime are a bit much for me.  Like another reviewer, I've also tried this with a splash of Rose's sweetened lime juice instead.  Refreshing!

To us Brits, a G&T comes with a wedge of lemon. Lime will do at a push, but lemon is the way to go!

Absolutely ethereal. These drinks remind me of my dead grandmother who went to heaven. Truly a gift from above.(Only someone from below could hate them and if they were from below they cannot be from Arkansas).

Very good, easy & refreshing. I use Diet Tonic & less lime. I love lime, but 1 T is too much for me. Thanks!

I love a good G&T, but the real differentiator is the ingredients! Good gin (Hendricks, e.g.), good tonic (Q Tonic) and (this is actually big) squeeze 1/2 of a washed key lime into it and garnish with a key lime wedge. Oh, and make sure your ice is good. I usually use store-bought to avoid funky refrigerator ice taste. Experient and enjoy!!!!

I did omit the lime juice and wedge.  It tastes good.  I am new to drinking spirits.  Simple and easy.  I will try the lime juice maybe next time.

A nice refreshing drink - but then again you can't go wrong with gin.  FYI - if you don't like gin, stay away from this one.

Delicious! I always enjoy lime with vodka or gin tonics.  The tall narrow glass is the way to go. Ignore the short, wide glass in the display photo.

There's ever too much lime! If I'm ordering one I usually ask for about 4 more wedges of lime on the side because, in my opinion, there's never enough! :o) And you gotta go with Tanqueray or T10, anything less is a disservice to your G&T :o)

I love Gin and tonic...I am a huge fan of something different.  I have landed on Ten and Tonic as my favorite. However, I have just mixed a 5th of Bulldog with Bombay Dry Gin to try and capture a ten like taste.  Bulldog has very strong floral flavors which I hope to tame with a standard London Dry....coulda been Gordon's as well. Will let you know how this works.... Yes I may be over the top!

This is pretty similar to the way I've always made a G&T. I love lime so add the extra as stated in the recipe, but I only do that for mine. For anyone else I just do the lime wedge (or lemon, or grapefruit, whichever I have around). Like another reviewer stated, the key is in quality ingredients. I use Hendrick's Gin (or Brooklyn which a fried gave me once) and Q tonic.

The way your taste buds detect the quinine in tonic is genetic.  To me it is bitter and most unpleasant.  To many others it is pleasant or is  not tasted at all.  I actually do  quinine taste test as a biology lab when teaching genetics.  In my experience more people like it  than dislike it.  So if you like it I imagine that it is really pleasant in a G&T,  but for me - I prefer my gin in a martini!

It's hard to believe that at my age I had never experienced a gin and tonic until last Saturday. I know people love them so when my friend offered me a sip of his I eagerly went for it. All I can say is, you've gotta love tonic to drink this stuff. Cubby, I'm not putting down your recipe at all; tonic is tonic and I guess you either love it or hate it.

The 2 to 1 ratio of tonic to gin is the best. The recipe calls for too much lime IMO. I stick with throwing in a lime wedge after squeezing it.

I accidentally picked up some tonic water and it tasted horrible. Thank goodness for this yummy recipe, I will actually be buying the tonic on purpose now. I tried the suggestion of using either the lime juice or lime wedge. I used the juice and it tasted perfect.

Whenever I make a recipe for the first time I find it's imperative to follow the directions to the letter. I really enjoyed them. And have made them several times. After trying them the way it's written my father suggested I add a couple shakes of orange bitters. I did that and I thought it made the drink even better. The addition of orange bitters rounds out the flavor and cuts the bitterness of the gin.

I added 6 parts gin and 1 part tonic rather than what the recipe had, but yeah, pretty solid outcome.

Great, simple drink.  Adjust the lime juice (Rosie's is great) to taste.

Great drink. I like either lemon or lime, but 1 tablespoon is too much. Just cut a nice wedge and squeeze and stir into the drink.

No lime juice, just a squeeze and the wedge tossed in the drink. And to me, it's not a G&T without a dash of Angostura bitters.
