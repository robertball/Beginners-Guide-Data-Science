I was afraid of making homemade brownies because all the recipes I've seen always looked complicated and too many ingredients. Not this recipe. I had everything already except for the chocolate. They were simple to make and tasted delicious! My husband is a big brownie critic and he ate 3!! Needless to say, I will be making again. I did not use 4 eggs but 3. I think my only complaint is that it was a little too cakey but next time I will use only 2 eggs and see if it solves the problem. I also baked them in a 9x9 pan. We like them thick and a 9x13 would just be too thin. I baked an extra 7-8 minutes.
**update**
I think I have perfected this recipe. Only use 2 eggs and bake in a 9x9 pan for 30 minutes. I add abot a cup of semi sweet choc chips to the batter as well and it is WONDERFUL!! They turn out thick and fudgy, just the way brownies are supposed to be.

For those who had criticisms of these not being chocolaty or fudgy enough, the solution is simple--increase the chocolate from 4 ozs. to 6 ozs.--you won't be disappointed. Bake them in a greased 9-inch square pan and bake about 45 minutes. Except for that one ingredient difference, this has been a recipe I've used from time to time for over 10 years, and it's very good--moist and buttery rich!

Do you like it when it sticks to your teeth and tongue? I do! Very good ones. Did not put nuts in it, but will try with chocolate chips next time. A keeper

Update...I made these yesterday for my Mom's Valentine Birthday dinner which we celebrated early. They were PERFECTION, and here is what I did. I only used 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and thawed, drained, frozen cherries(cut in half & pat dry, so not too wet)1 cup salted butter, 1 cup flour, & teaspoon vanilla extract. I baked in a heart shape pan that was size 8 5/8 x 8 1/2 x 1 1/2 inches in a preheated 350 degree oven for 35 minutes. They were not too sweet(first time I used the 2 cups & did not like the too sweetness), fudgy, chocolatey, and everyone in the family LOVED them.

I have to disagree with those that found this brownie fudgy. They were cakey and crumbly. I suspect the 4 eggs are the culprit. Also, it seemed there was a slightly flat taste to them. I used Ghirardelli chocolate, which I already know I like, so maybe I didn't add enough salt. I continue my search for the perfect fudge brownie....

I've been using this recipe for over a year now, tweeking here and there.
I only use 2 eggs, as others have said.  I also add 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  
My husbands' co-workers love the peanutbutter twist we did with this recipe - 
follow the recipe, using two eggs instead of four.  Add 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of Reeses Peanutbutter Chips (instead of walnuts) before popping into the oven.  Once completely baked, let it cool for ten minutes, then add 1/2 a mini peanutbutter cup on top of each brownie.  
Delicious!

Edit* 
Make sure you use a large enough pan.  When I first tried this recipe, it came out goopy (8x8).  Then I tried using my larger pan and it came out great.  I also noticed that my darker pans produce a softer edge; glass pans tend to crisp up the edges (alter cook times a bit for this).
So for those of you having a hard time getting this recipe to fully bake, try a larger pan.

Caution: these brownies will make you lose all self-control and probably derail any diet you're on.  You've been warned!  They're fantastic! Fudgey and rich, just like brownies should be.  I took the advice of other members and reduced the eggs to four egg whites.  I also used about 3/4 C butter (I ran out) and substituted chocolate chips for walnuts. 30 minutes was sufficient baking time.  I recommend eating these warm out of the oven; the sides are crispy and the inside is amazing.

Halfed the recipe, used a mix of cocoa powder and chocolate and didn't use the walnuts, but they tasted great!  My brother, who doesn't usually like sweet things, wolfed them down!

I don't typically make changes to a recipe the first time I make it, but after reading the first two reviews I decided to take their advice. I used 6 oz of chocolate and 2 eggs as well as baked them in a 8" square pan. 

With those changes these are absolutely the best brownies I've ever had. I've made this recipe twice and both times these were awesome! The first time I made these I thought they were a bit greasy though, so the second time I reduced the butter to 1 1/2 sticks as well as reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. They were still great. My one piece of advice would be to not trust the toothpick test. I tested the brownies after 45 min, 50 min and 55 min and each time the toothpick came out dirty. I finally pulled them out of the oven after 55 min and while they still tasted yummy they did over bake. Next time I will stick t the 45 min rule and pull them out regardless of how clean/dirty the toothpick is.

This is a very nice, easy recipe. The brownies turned out moist and gooey just like we love them. However, I am giving this recipe only four stars because I thought they lacked a bit of chocolaty taste (they were also rather caramel colored than brown). I put a coffee/chocolate glaze and cocos on top (1 TB Butter, 2 TB confectioners sugar, 1 TB dark cocoa, 1 TB coffee; heat all in small saucepan and put immediately on hot cake). And then they turned out very good. I will make this recipe again, thanks!

YUMMY!!  Turned out very well, not too chewy, not too cake-like!  Very simple as well, which is a huge + in my book :)  I heated the chocolate & butter in the microwave, rather than stovetop, and turned out fine.  I also sprinkled M&M semi-sweet baking candies on top, just for fun.  My 3 year old "helped" me make these, so the added candy sprinkles were the perfect "job" for her. :)

This is VERY similar to an old Betty Crocker brownie recipe we've been using for 30+ yrs - and always loved in our families!! THE BROWNIE for us.  These tips might help with some of the complaints about greasiness, lack of chocolate flavor, and "flat taste":   -if using 4 oz of UNSWEETENED baking chocolate, decrease the butter by 4 T. -if using cocoa, use 3/4 C cocoa and 1 C butter -increase the salt to 1 tsp; you won't have the "flat" flavor mentioned by some -DON'T overbake (overbaking will turn them cakey): bake just 'til the sides start to pull away; toothpick test isn't the best with these.

My favorite brownie recipe. I notice people are saying that improve the density, you should take out an entire egg or two for a denser brownie. Eggs have two different structural qualities because you have a yoke and a white. The whites help provide more structure to a recipe, making a cakier brownie, while the yokes provide more moisture, making a denser brownie. After trying the recipe as written (very good as-is), I now use three eggs and one egg yoke in this recipe for perfectly (to me ^^) fudgy brownie.

Brownies came out amazing.  Perfectly fudge-y, gooey, and dense.  My father in law ate 3 before we left the house for dinner, and then wanted more for the ride home.  Please use this recipe as is!   All 4 eggs, all the sugar, and make sure your chocolate is unsweetened.  I think that may have been some peoples problems is they may have used semi-sweet chocolate instead.  If you want a cake like brownie, you are probably making a mistake picking fudge brownies.  I would recommend finding a recipe for that instead of changing this wonderful recipe.  I frosted my brownies using "satiny chocolate glaze" from this site.  You cannot make brownies like this from a box.

can I give it less than 1 star? I tried this twice. Once with 2 eggs and it was inedible. It was a gooey mess that then cooled and hardened into what could only be a doorstop. With all 4 eggs as the recipe suggests it was MUCH better but I never got that great chocolate taste that I usually get from box mixes. For all the rave reviews on these brownies it was a major let down.... twice.

The BEST brownies I have ever made. I added 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of the walnuts and they turned out so fudgey and chocolatey and delicious! They took about 35 minutes to cook and they looked not done and when i inserted a toothpick it came out a bit wet but that is only because they are SO CHOCOLATEY! They self-iced themselves, too! I'm not a person who likes hard chewy brownies so these soft melt-in-your-mouth brownies are amazing. I'm using all my willpower not to go wolf down the entire pan. The posted recipe says 12 but it's really about 24 good sized brownies if you cut them up right. I recommend these 1000 times over!

I have to say, it's rather annoying when someone customizes a recipe, makes it, doesn't like it, and then gives the recipe a lower rating than it deserves (or even a higher rating). This site gives the option for custom versions so utilize it! Anyway, as far as these go, I made the recipe exactly and can see where some would consider it too cakey, I did at first actually, I also found them a bit dry, however, while they were still warm I went ahead and put them in sealed containers and stuck them in the fridge, after about an hour or so they were more brownie like and a bit more moist. I give this recipe five stars because it's of the first that I've made where the brownies actually taste more like brownies rather than dry cake! If you prefer your brownies more like fudge then use the two eggs most people recommend, I did that for the second batch and found them slightly too dense but still good.

I took another reviewer's suggestion and increased the unsweetened chocolate to 6 ounces. I made no other changes. I baked this in my Perfect Brownie Pan for just under thirty minutes and they were perfect.

I'm a very picky brownie person b/c most brownies people make are hard and dry, in my opinion. So I was looking for a recipe that didn't give me that. I found it! These brownies were so moist that I had both of my parents (who are on a diet) taste them b/c they were just that good. I also took them to a church gathering and everyone who had one said Wow! and Mmm. So yes, this is definitely a keeper.

I made those brownies 3 times, both times using only 2 eggs like many people suggested. 

This is a really great recipe, they turn out perfect! My boyfriend always gets almost too excited every time I make them because he loves them so much!

Like eating a piece of rich, chocolate fudge.  After chilling, these were easily cut into nice squares and removed from the pan.  Simple, delicious, fudgy brownies!

I wouldn't say these were OMG brownies.  They were o.k.....maybe because I took the advice of others.  I am an experienced cook and baker and I don't totally agree with the other reviews.  By eliminating 2 of the eggs, I felt they were dry and crumbly, and I even took them out earlier that suggested.  I did add aditional cocoa, which I am glad I did, and I now add white raisins because it does make brownies slightly moister.  No one knows they are inside, but they just always say that I make the best brownies!  And I never tell my secret (something I learned from a caterer!  I would use at least 3 eggs and maybe even the fourth if you want them more moist vs crumbly.  I did use the sour cream chocolate frosting with plain yogurt vs sour cream from Allrecipes, and it was the icing on the cake!  It actually made the brownies O.K.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out a gooey mixture.  I am giving it one star because it was very tasty.  I used another brownie recipe from another site and that turned out great and I ixed those with this mixture.  They were yummy!

These brownies are STUPENDOUS...I'm one of those people who interprets recipes more as guidelines than exact instructions (sometimes that bites me in the butt), and I still managed to make awesome brownies with this recipe...for example, I didn't have any chocolate squares (really, who keeps those on hand?!) so I substituted 12 tablespoons of cocoa, upped the butter by a tablespoon and added 2 tablespoons of milk.  I also left out the walnuts.  They were STILL delicious and fudgy and YUM!

With a couple minor changes, these are the best brownies I have ever made!  As others suggested, I used 3 eggs rather than 4 and they turned out perfect.  I also omitted the nuts.  I like thick brownies so I used a 9X9 glass pan and baked for approximately 55 minutes.  These brownies are nice and fugdey; not cake-like at all.  This will be my standard brownie recipe from now on!  Thanks!

I was trying to follow Angelflower23 modifications and I have to say it turned out awful. I had to throw it out. I don't doubt her brownies were great, I am sure I did something wrong along the way. I just can't figure out what... The texture was all wrong, and it was SO GREASY, we could feel the butter more than anything else. I used 2 eggs, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup chocolate chips and the 4 oz. of chocolate bars. I will have to try again and start with the original version.

Yes, they're delicious.  Yes, they're fudgey, not cakey.  Yes you should make the changes suggested by previous reviewers:
(1) less sugar (1 1-2 cups)
(2) less eggs (2 large)
(3) use a smaller pan than a 9x13
All i had on hand was a 9X13 and i was just having a mad brownie craving, so i didn't bother making that change.  The brownies were cooked within 15 minutes and were super thin, like cookies, but not crunchy or round. And just as a side note, this recipe is the same as "One Bowl Brownies" (+/- one egg) from this website which is the (kraft) recipe from the back of a Baker's chocolate box.

Following the recipe exactly, I did come out with one of the best fudgy consistencies I have ever tasted in homemade.  The problem is the chocolate is lacking.  I'm going to try it again with an extra square and see if that fixes it.

This is a really good base recipe, but modifications needed to be made. It really depends on what your idea of a good brownie is. Mine is fudgy and rich, not cakey and bland. Unfortunately, as is, this recipe is the latter. However, by reducing the eggs to 3 (I was afraid to try it with only two, but I may next time), making the sugar 1 cup brown and 3/4 cup white and upping the chocolate to 6-8 oz (I've tried it with both and both are great, but 4 is way too little for us) then this recipe becomes a winner. I did not add nuts 'cause we don't care for them.

After further review of how this recipe turned out, I had to revise my review. There is soo much butter in this recipe, that when I put the brownies in the oven, the edges bubbled and almost fried. After I tried to remove them from the pan I baked them in, I found lots of butter on the bottom of the pan. The brownies were very greasy with butter.
I also found them to be way too sweet. I only used 2 eggs because I dont like cake brownies. 

I would recommend cutting the butter way down. Probably to 1/2 a cup. I would recommend using 2 or 3 eggs instead of the 4 unless you like your brownies cakey. 

I would also recommend cutting down the sugar by about a 1/4 cup. Again, unless you like your brownies really sweet. 

My fear of that taking out some butter and sugar will effect the recipe a lot. So my eval of this recipe is that it needs modification to make it usable. But I do like using real chocolate instead of cocoa.

These brownies are AWESOME! I read the other reviews before making, and agreed that 4 eggs were too much! I made these changes: used 2 eggs instead of 4, decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. And to save some time, I put the chocolate chips with the cup of butter in the micro wave at HIGH setting and heated it in intervals of 30 seconds until the chocolate was completely melted. I am eating this chewy fudge brownie as I write this, and can tell this will be a regular go to brownie. However I think I will be cutting back even more on the sugar. I love sweets but its a little too sweet for me.

This is the first recipe that I have used that actually creates fudgey brownies. I took the advice of others and only used 2 eggs and used semi sweet chocolate and cut the amount of sugar in half and then baked in a 9x9 inch pan for a thicker brownie. The only problem was that they stuck terribly to the bottom of the glass pan. Next time I will use a nonstick pan.

Pretty good. Followed the advice of others and only used 2 eggs. A little too much butter but still rich and fudgey. I'll probably make these again with a little less butter. UPDATE: Perfected with 1 stick of butter and 3 eggs! Best brownies ever!

I added an extra 2 oz of chocolate and used only 2 eggs after reading some of the other reviews. They came out perfect! I've been looking for homemade fudgie brownies and these are it! I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top just for fun. You will need a glass of milk with these brownies though. After 3 failed recipes I'm very thankful to have found this one!

After reading reviews, the only change I made was dropping the eggs to three total. Otherwise I made it just as written and they came out lovely, fudgy, and about one inch thick. I would say that because this recipe is almost entirely chocolate and butter, the success of the recipe depends on how good of chocolate you use. If you use Baker's brand, you're going to get bitter, nasty brownies -- use Ghiradelli's or Hershey's.

Very good.  I added a handful of chocolate chips, as well.  My only note is that I burned the brownies slightly, so will reduce the cooking time in the future to 25-30 minutes.

These brownies had the consistancy of fudge brownies, but the flavor was not the greatest.  They just didn't have that deep rich fudgy flavor. I'm going to keep searching.

These were moist and very chocolately without being overly sweet.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a brownie with an almost cake-like texture.

I made these last night. My office staff is loving them. I cut butter in half and substituted in 1/2 cup applesauce. Also I didn't have on hand the unsweetened chocolate so I substituted 1/4 cup semi-sweet chips, two small TJ's dark chocolate bars, 1/2 regular hershey bar and part of a milk chocolate Easter bunny. They turned out great. I WILL make again.

Made these for a girl at work and they were all gone in under 15 minutes by the staff! My first time making brownies and they were the best most people have had. I took them out of the oven a bit early so it would be gooier inside.

This recipe was right up my alley. I have made these right into cupcake form. These were soo delish. I made this a few days prior and was awesome, nice and thick, cakey just the way I was hoping. I omitted the walnuts on purpose because I wasn't sure if whom I was making these for has a nut allergy. But the only thing I did different wasn't so much with the ingredients to the recipe, that stayed the same minus the nuts. Was I seperated the eggs. And added the yokes after the choclate mixture cooled. But in a seperate bowl, I whisked the egg whites until I had soft peaks then folded the egg whites in completely before adding the flour and salt. And I think it did what I wanted as a thick cakey like brownie served as cupcakes....The doctors I made them for just total loved them and topped them off with a Raspberry Creme Frosting. Wonderful!! Thanks.

I followed the recipe as stated and all I got was a pan full of bubbling greasy mush that got hard as a rock after cooling. Not sure what went wrong, maybe I didn't let it cool enough between adding the sugar and the other ingredients? Any suggestions?

These brownies were ok but I think that they need some work. They were too sweet and the recipe was a little convoluted as whether to use 4 ounces of chocolate or just 1 ounce. I used 4 ounces because it made better sense with the amount of the other ingredients and it came out fine, but less sugar and possibly more flour would make this a great recipe.

My initial thoughts were 3 stars - they judge didn't taste that chocolatey to me. Looking through the reviews, I took a suggestion and upped the chocolate to 6 oz - 5 unsweetened and 1 semi-sweet (the next time, I did 2 semi-sweet and didn't really notice a difference between the two) and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!   The added chocolate make the brownies "fudgier" and definitely made them deliciously chocolatey. There's something still not quite perfect for me, I think I might try making this with 3  eggs instead. I cook them in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes and I Don't use nuts (hate em in brownies). I might try one reviewers suggestion of two eggs in a 9 x 9 pan for 30 minutes. Will update if I do.

I used one less egg and one more ounce of chocolate than the recipe called for, and they turned out great!  Brought them to work and my coworkers ate the whole pan.

I thought i would try a new brownie recipe and honestly, I was a little dissapointed. I followed the ingredients to a tee (except I used chocolate chips rather than chocolate squares but made sure my ratio was good) but my brownies came out nearly white! I just read a comment about increasing the choclate to 6oz instead of 4oz. I also added a personal touch to it by sprinkling choclate chips and marshmallows about 5 mins left to bake, it adds the gooey topping factor that my friends love. Now I have to make a whole new batch! I have a BBQ party to host in 3 hrs!

I substituted 1/2 c of honey for the sugar, 1/2 cocoa powder, 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/4 white flour, then only 3 eggs, and these brownies still came out fantastic.  Because of the honey I also lowered the temperature.  The texture was perfect, so they were moist and chewy, but cut clean so not crumbly and made a nice presentation.  Thanks!

Delicious, fudgey, and moist!!!  This recipe is simple and you get GREAT brownies!! Just make sure you follow it carefully and don't heat the chocolate/butter on high like I did! It turned out fine and actually gave it a little bit of a toasty flavor (which I like), but they didn't look as pretty as they could have otherwise...

I made 2 different brownie batches at the same time.  1 using chocolate squares, and the other unsweetened cocoa powder.  This recipe gave a far better chocolate brownie taste.  Good recipe, but I'll investigate others that also use chocolate squares.

I took the advise of some other reviews and added 2 more ounces of chocolate.  I also changed 1 cup of the white sugar to dark brown sugar, used 3 eggs instead of 4, added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips, omitted the nuts and topped them off with peanut butter frosting, these came out like fudge!  If you like your brownies more gooey then try this recipe but if your looking for a cakey brownie, this probably isn't the one.  I will make this again because everyone I gave them to fell in love with them and wanted to recipe!  They are super rich and chocolaty!

I followed the instructions for this recipe, except that I took the advice of others and used just two eggs, because I was hoping for less cake-like brownies. My plan was to use the brownies as layers for a brownie ice cream cake for my husband's birthday.  Instead of a 9X9 inch pan as so many others had used, I used two 6 inch round pans. I filled each one half full of the batter. After 30 minutes there was a crust on the sides, but the inside was still undone.  It seemed to take slightly over 40 minutes to get the middle cooked.  Then when I took them out, boy was it hard to cut them!  The crust was hard as a rock, but the middle was still nice an soft.  After they had cooled they were even worse!  It was now nearly impossible to cut them; forget about trying to chew them! Someone could have broken a tooth on it, it was so hard.  I don't know what went wrong since I followed the recipe and took the suggestions of others who had successfully tried only 2 eggs.  I only changed the size of the pan. I would not recommend this recipe. I ended up throwing the "stone" brownies away:-(

I thought these were pretty good. My husband thought they were okay. However, I'm still looking for a brownie recipe that turns out like the box mix--moist and chewy, but with the flakiness on top.

Thanks for the recipe! We made this tonight and it never quite formed properly. It was very crumbly, almost like crushed Oreos. I have absolutely no idea why this happened. That only thought I have is that we are at 2600 altitude...but really! Anyway, it tasted delicious! We sprinkled chunks and crumbles over vanilla ice cream and was that ever tasty! I will use this recipe again for that purpose! With my luck, next time it will turn out right, now that I don't want it to. Ha! Thanks again for the sundae topper!

These brownies were really simple to make and they turned out nice.  Kind of hard to stir cause they're so thick, but the end product is worth it.  However, they are extremely filling... first time one brownie filled me up.  However, they were a quick midnight snack and easy enough for someone unexperienced in the kitchen.

We baked this recipe in 2 small pans and it cooked fine but my family did not like these brownies. They were truly picture perfect but too bad they didn't taste as good as they looked. Very dense brownie was not cakey at all which I liked and some others did not. The taste was the only thing lacking in this recipe for me.

Hi there... making these now, and I tasted the batter before I popped in oven. I followed other reviews about only using two eggs, and added 3/4 cup of semi sweet chips as add in. I also didn't have the bakers chocolate so used the substitutions for coco powder, which I used dark... Also used an 8x8 pan... Can not wait to serve these at my daughters play date this afternoon!!! They smell wonderful and the batter was scrumptious...

I put these in a 9x9 and it took almost an hour to bake. At 35 minutes they weren't even close to baked. I only put in 2 eggs per some other people's suggestions, and used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of walnuts, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. They weren't bad once they were actually baked, but the fact that it took nearly 2x as long was quite frustrating given that I was on a time crunch!

I made these brownies while watching a movie with my family p.s. there great with vanilla ice cream.  I added about 1/4 cup of peanut butter and didnt use nuts and overall they were very moist and fudgy...a top notch brownie...a keeper.

Pretty disappointing. I started worrying about these when I peeked through the oven door during the last few minutes of the baking time and saw butter bubbling up around the edges of the brownies.  I love butter but this recipe has too much in proportion to the flour.  The brownies were too crunchy on the bottom and edges.  They literally fried in the pan. I've made lots of brownies in the past 40 years and my favorite recipe is from Martha Stewart. I even like mixes better than this recipe.  Will not be making again.

Everyone loves when I make these brownies! I did change a few things on the recipe though.  Instead of just 4 (1 ounce) unsweetened chocolate, I've used a whole Sweet Obsession Fine European Chocolate Dark Chocolate Bar (6.35 Oz.) for Dark Chocolate Fudge Brownies and at other times I use melted chocolate chips.  Whatever you use, I would suggest using more chocolate than the recipe. It makes it nice and gooey. I also bake my brownies for about an hour and don't add nuts.

These taste and look great! Chocolatey,buttery and awesomely delicious. If I am thinking of breaking my diet these are what would convince me to do so. I am not a big sweets fan but my oh my I am so into these. We used 1 1/2 cps of sugar because we used bittersweet chocolate. Other than that no other changes were made. They are cakey yet rich at the same time. The flavors compliment a nice strong cup of coffee or a nice earl gray tea. Next time these are made I will serve with either whipped cream or vanilla icecream. Delicious!!!

I wanted to like it, especially because the reviews were so good. These brownies aren't worth the money for the ingredien ts. a cup of butter and 2 cups sugar should make anything decedent, but these weren't. the recipe definitely needs some baking powder or something. what a waste.

We increased the chocolate to 6 ounces and decreased the eggs from 4 to 2 as some of the other reviewers mentioned.  I think one of the few things that could make these better are duck eggs instead of chicken eggs (duck eggs typically make baking recipes lighter and fluffier, not sure how they will work w/ brownies), ice cream, and some hot fudge sauce.

I followed the recommendations to cutting the eggs to only 2 used less butter but just didn't turn out at all!!  They looked wonderful coming out of the oven but they were not!

I've used this recipe numerous times, it perfect for a number of reasons. Number one is because I'm lazy with weak flabby arms so, melting butter and mixing all of the ingredients in one pan  kills two birds with one stone (no straining my lazy arms and only 1 dish to wash). The recipe is soo flexible I've even used hot chocolate when I didn't have bakers chocolate or coco around. This recipe always turns out great, chewy, fudgey and with a few more chocolate chips goes from regular to mega chocolate brownies without all the extra hassle and ingredients.

These brownies were a very big hit and went fast. Making second batch within a week. I used 6 squares of chocolate instead of 4 and no nuts. Excellent.

Even though a few changes to the recipe, I rate it a 5 because it, along with all your reviews, gave me perfect fudgey brownies.

As stated by other reviewers, I found two eggs to be just right for a fudgey brownie.  Because of reviews, I opted for an additional 2 squares of chocolate for a total of 6.  

Again, because some reviewers stated there was an oiliness, I cut the butter 25% to 3/4 cup.  Success-moist and chewy.  And that's even with overbaking them 5 minutes.  Should have taken them out at 30 minutes rather than 35 (glass pan).  I also cut the sugar significantly.

Thank you to reviewers for helping me get a perfect fudgey brownie the first time around.

First of all, I'm still having difficulty understanding those of you that do not like "sweet" brownies.  All of the brownies I have ever had in my life have been sweet.  If you don't like sweets, stay away from these brownies!  

I am an accomplished cook of almost 25 years.  I was self-taught at the age of 15.  I like to read cookbooks for fun so when I set out to find the PERFECT homemade brownie recipe, I kept coming back to this one.  After a few tweaks here and there, I am in love with this recipe!  

Here's what I did:

I followed the recipe exactly as written with the following changes:
-Melt 2 oz (1/4 cup) of semi-sweet chocolate chips with the unsweetened chocolate and butter.  I used a double boiler to melt the butter and the chocolates so the mixture does not have to be cooled before adding the sugars and the eggs.
  
-Omit 2 of the 4 eggs

-Substitute one cup of light brown sugar for one cup of the white sugar (use one cup of brown and one cup of white)

-Fold 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips into the completed batter before pouring into the pan.

I baked my brownies in a 9x13 non-stick pan at 350 for 30 minutes.  They are very lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and fudgy on the inside.  I will never buy brownies in a box again!

Oh, and to those who said they ended up with a hard, unedible blob, you didn't do something right - try again and follow my recipe.  It's fool-proof!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and amped up the chocolate and reduced the number of eggs to 2, so that the flavor was richer and it was more of a fudge brownie. The brownie was flavorful, but I'm still on a quest for a truly fudg-"E" brownie.

I made these and tweaked them by increasing the chocolate to 6oz, substituted 1/2 the fat with apple sauce and used Stevia sugar substitute.  I then added peanut butter and chocolate chips in place of the nuts and these were to die for!!!

These brownies are very good, but I only gave 4 stars because I made some alterations to the recipe to get a taste/texture that I prefer. First, I only had unsalted butter, so I increased the amount of salt to 1 1/4 tsps. Second, rather than using unsweetened chocolate, I used 4 squares bittersweet and 2 squares semi sweet - and cut back the amount of sugar by two-three tbsp. And third, I only used two eggs instead of four because in my experience too many eggs gives brownies a more cake like consistency and I prefer the chewy, fudgy ones. I also omitted the nuts - and altogether I found that these brownies produced the PERFECT bar.

Super yummy!  Made recipe as written then added homemade caramel and walnuts.  Oh, that pan didn't last the day. 

Note: Cooked for 35 minutes in a pan that makes 2 - 3 edges per brownie.  This made for crispy edges and fudgey center.  I suspect people who said they weren't gooey in the middle overcooked them.  Remember that they will continue to cook while cooling so do not cook until they look done - they'll be burnt in the end.

I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. margarine. I used 2 rather than 4 eggs, per others suggestions, and  I used 6 T. Carob powder and 3 T. Hershey's dark cocoa (my own choice).  I made in a 9x9 pan as others had suggested.  That said, the next time I make these, and yes, it will be soon, I will decrease the amount of chocolate, will try 5 T. Carob and 1 T. Hershey's dark cocoa, and I  will bake in a 9x13 as the 9x9 made them too thick for our liking.  However you like your brownies, I think this recipe will work for you - and being scratch rather than box, you know just what you're eating!  Enjoy!

I have been looking for years for a good homemade brownie.  This is it!!!  They were chewy and rich!  I used Smart Balance 50/50 blend instead of real butter.  When I pulled them out of the oven, I topped w/ 1 c. milk chocolate chips, let them melt and then spread over the top.

These brownies are heavenly! I used pecans and a 4-oz bar of Ghirardelli baking chocolate. I baked them for a little under 30 minutes and they turned out beautifully.  They are not gooey brownies, so maybe as fudge brownies they aren't the best but overall as brownies go, they're my new favorite!

I LOVED THESE BROWNIES! Wow, were they delicious! I used 2 eggs instead of 4 since people said they were too cakey with 4. I thought that with only 2 eggs they were a bit too fudge-y for me (but not my husband and sons). Next time I'll try it with 3 eggs to see if I find a happy medium. Fantastic recipe - thanks SO much!

Very good. We don't like nuts in our brownies, and I had read that many people thought these weren't chocolaty enough. So, instead of the chopped walnuts, we used 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. These were very good.

What are these? Are they caramel?  Are they chocolate?  I made them with 2 eggs as per other reviewers' suggestions, and skimped on the sugar, and they were still waaay too sweet.  Too unhealthy, and too weird, to make again in my opinion.

Great recipe once I halved the number of eggs.  The brownies were moist and chewy and just absolutely delicious.
One thing I would recommend is letting them cool in the pan for some time before transferring them over to a wire rack.  The first time I made them they fell apart trying to move them right away.  I should of known better.

This is a very good basic brownie recipe, full of chocolate flavor and nice and chewy.  They go great with a cuppa joe.  I made these for a meeting and everyone liked them.  I followed the suggestion of a couple other readers and used two eggs.  I baked these in a 9x13 pan, which made them thin, probably about 1/2 inch thick, so if you want a thicker brownie use a smaller pan.  The bottom of the brownies baked quite firm before the center was set, but if you like a high stick-to-your-teeth factor this will not be a problem.  I'll make these again, and will try a 9x9 pan to see what happens.  I also think these would be good with some instant coffee granules thrown in.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed it up a bit. Using 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semi-sweet. A tad bit more vanilla, and then semi-sweet chips insead of nuts. WOW, THE BEST CHEWY BROWNIES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!

I only had a 9x9 pan, so I just baked them a little longer than the time stated, since it meant they would be thicker. They were still chewy and good. My family said they were perfect. This is my new go to recipe for brownies.

Very delicious, but they kind of fall apart.  I would say good to make for your own home, but not necessarily to take anywhere!

This recipe was amazing. I've had such a hard time finding good homemade brownies, and this was perfect! As others suggested, I reduced the eggs to two instead of four, and my family doesn't like nuts so I took those out. I definitely recommend this

I will never make brownies from a boxed mix again! These are the best brownies. I have made them many times now. I usually Halve the recipe for a standard 8x8 brownie pan. I also use bittersweet chocolate chips (Ghiradelli) and they are amazing. I do not like recipes that are difficult or have too many ingredients. This one is perfect. Don't overcook though.

Followed the advice of others and made with only 2 eggs and extra semi sweet chocolate chips that I melted with the butter. I did not have any walnuts so had to leave that out.  I only baked for 25 or so minutes  because the brownies looked very done and I didn't want them to burn or get too crunchy. They came out pretty flat (I used a 9 x 13 aluminum pan) but chewy and gooey. Only downside to this was that pieces did not come out intact. Some of it would stay stuck to the pan. Maybe that was a result of halving the eggs.

These brownies are absolutly melt in your mouth, delicious, fugdy, goodness-y sqaures of heaven!!
I used 3 eggs instead of 4. Also, I added a teeny bit of brandy to keep the chocolate soft(you add it after mixing sugar). I added two extra tablespoons of flour because the recipe was a bit unproportional.
The trick to non-cakey-ness is to NOT open the oven during the cooking process and to used convect cooking so it cooks evenly. 
Also, if you want soft brownies, you need to cook the brownies at the minimum time. Then, take them out into open air. The brownies still cook out in the air and stay soft.
To re-cook for softy wonderfulness, put in the microwave until satisfied. Definetly keeping this recipe!!

I added 2 more oz. of baking chocolate and only 2 eggs as suggested by another reviewer, but in a 9x13" pan they were way too thin. The corners and edges were like crisp cookies. The middle was a bit softer, but not a fudgey brownie like I wanted.  Plus, there was something bland about the taste even with the extra chocolate.  Guess I'll try another recipe.

From memory, this looks like the recipe from an old Goodhousekeeping cookbook that I used for years. I haven't been able to locate my copy, so I appreciate finding it here. These brownies are rich and buttery and always get raves. Thanks!

I have never baked brownies from scratch before, and I was a little worried about how they would turn out. They were amazing! I follwed the recipe exactly, and they are perfect! Just thick enough, soft moist and not to cakey. I will definitly be making these again.

3.5 stars.  I should make this again before writing a review, but I don't know when that will be.  I thought that 1c butter was a little much, but went along with it.  The butter and chocolate mixed well together in the saucepan, but after mixing the other components in, the result was grainy and the butter separated.  I mixed it again and poured it into cupcake tins and baked for 20 mins.  When I pulled it out, it was still very liquid-ey.  But this being the first fudge brownies I made, I let it cool before making a final assessment.  Also, it was like the entire thing was floating in butter.  Certainly did not look appealing.  After cooling, the brownies did firm up well, and were fudgey...Aside from taking out two of the eggs and adding two extra squares of chocolate, I did not not alter the recipe further.  The next time I make this, I will definitely cut down on the butter to maybe a little less than 3/4c.  I had to soak the oil from the brownies before serving.  Taste was good though, so that's why it got more stars.

This has been our families favorite recipe for years, my mom found the exact same one in a old church cookbook. Since it's only me and my husband I make a half recipe and bake it in a 8 by 8 inch pan for about 20 minutes. I use less nuts and add chocolate chips to the batter. These are so fudgy and good!

Reduce eggs from 4 to 3, and the brownies will be less cake like. Also, it is very easy to melt the butter and the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl, then mix in all the other ingredients, for a one bowl recipe.

absolutely wonderful. I took everyones advice to make them super chocolatey.  I used 6oz of chocolate and only 2 eggs. ALSO I added 3tbsp of coffee and a tsp of instant espresso powder, as well as 1 tbsp of amaretto liquor. Because of the extra liquid I also needed another 1/2 cup of flour. My girls also requested chocolate chips...so 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips also made their way into the batter.  OOOOOOOOmg. It truly is like fudge.  I put in the smaller pan as well and baked for 50 min. They were still gooish in the middle when I took them out.  I have never had brownies turn out before...ever. These are the best.

OMG...the best brownie recipe ever. I did read the reviews first and followed some of the suggestions by others. I only had margarine  on hand so used it, as I dont really believe in butter but only for certain baking. I also only used 1 3/4 cup of white sugar from experience, and only had Frys Cocoa, so used 6 ounces as per other reviews about adding more chocolate. So use 4 tablespoons for every 1 oz of squares of chocolate. I did add a handful of chocolate chips and only added 1 cup on pecans (as thats all I had on hand) 2 cups of any nut is too much I think for this recipe. The crushed/chopped pecans work wonderfully in most recipes calling for walnuts I find.  These turned out FABULOUS I had to beat my teen boy off with a stick...lol, jk, but seriously he could barely wait for them to cool b4 digging in.  I also sprinkled icing sugar on top while still slightly warm..yummy! I like to leave them in my glass pan until we are ready to eat these , then cut them  instead of cutting into squares and leaving on a plate. As they stay gooey longer. THANK YOU K. Anderson!

OH MY WORD!!!!!!! No one in my family could believe that I made these. We ALL agreed they were simply the best ever. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because I live in another country and it was all I had. So I had some unsweetened cocoa powder. Seriously DELICOUS!!!!!!!!!

These are rich and perfect.  I did use 5 oz of chocolate and only 3 eggs, because I prefer them more fudgy than cakey, and they were awesome.

I wanted to try out this recipe, too see if it was better than the one I regularly use. It was good, but was too cakey for my taste.

followed the recipe, except my mix was more like a batter so i added 50 mls of water and they turned out great super fudgy, i used 45 g of milk chocolate and 75 g of dark chocolate turned out well, recipe should specify unsalted butter otherwise it loses a little sweetness

Used 2 eggs instead of 4. Ended up over cooking it because the middle seemed mushy, but when it cools it firms up. Mine were a bit crunchy but still the best brownies I've ever had. Will never make boxed brownies again. Oh, also I just microwaved the butter and chocolate then added 1 cup chocolate chips (no nuts), this was so easy and delicious.

I made the recipe as is with all four whole eggs. The only extra thing I did was sprinkle about a fourth cup of extra chopped nuts on the top for a decoration, which made the brownies look really nice and appetizing.  They turned out great.   It's true that they aren't as gooey as the boxed mixes, but they are still moist rich, with a true deep chocolate flavor.   I let them cool for about 20 minutes before cutting them, and they easily cut into nice clean squares and stacked easily in the cookie jar without crumpling, drooping, or sticking together.  My husband loved them.  He's not usually big on sweets, but he ate four in one sitting! I will definately be making this recipe again.

Soooo good!  I only had 2 eggs, so that's what I used, and I think it added to the fudginess (which is how I like brownies).  I decreased the sugar by a half cup, and then added chocolate chips.   Plenty sweet with the decreased sugar.

These are good brownies.  I, like others, had to substitute the melted chocolate for cocoa but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I think it would actually be better with melted chocolate, a little more fudge like.  I found this to be a little more like cake than I was hoping for, but I don't think that's the recipes fault.  All in all, good recipe.

Very good recipe.  I used 2 eggs and 1 additional egg white, plus used about 1 1/2 tsp of instant coffee granules (dissolved into a bit of water), plus used 6 bakers chocolate squares, as recommended by other users.  Yum!

Incredibly fudgy & delicious!  I have never make brownies from scratch before, and now I know I will never buy the box mix again!  I added a couple extra squares of choc & reduced the eggs to 2.  Fabulous!

These came out quite well  making them by the recipe.  Was tempted to cut back on the eggs after reading the reviews, but used all 4 and they turned out great. I didn't have the unsweetened chocolate squares so did the cocoa and oil substitute.  Also left out the nut.  Did bake it in the 9x13 pan and they came out great.  Moist and fudgy, not cake like at all.

Didn't really do it for me... followed another reviewers suggestion and added extra chocolate. Was really not brownie like at all, just turned out like a pan of chocolate fudge.

I took into account the suggestions of previous reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar and eggs, I also replaced the walnuts with the chocolate chips.  I was making these brownies for gifts, so I doubled the recipe and then divided the batter between three 8" x 8" disposable aluminum pans and cooked them for roughly 30mins.  While these brownies had the best texture of any brownie I've made (they were thick and chewy with a nice crisp to the top and sides) they were also so rich they were nearly inedible.  Brownies are usually wolfed down around this house, but the 8" x 8" pan I baked on Friday afternoon is still 1/3 intact on Sunday afternoon.    I haven't decided if I'll ever use this recipe again.  If I do, I will definately scale back the sugar even more, omit the chocolate chips, and perhaps even scale back on the unsweetened chocolate.

I followed reviewers' advice and reduced the eggs to 2. I added white chocolate chips in place of nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe. The sugar never dissolved, so the final brownies had an unpleasant grainy texture. Great taste! Horrible texture. It reminded me of the time I tried to make real fudge, and it ended up grainy too; so maybe if you are good at making homemade fudge this will work for you. I may try this again using 4 eggs and superfine sugar. (The kind that is finer than regular, but not powdered).

I really, really like these!  I used the 12T cocoa powder/4T butter substitution since I didn't have any squares of chocolate.  Easy recipe to follow and they came out great!  I also only used 3 eggs and thought the 'fudginess' was spot on.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. I did put some chocolate chips in and it made it soooo moist and yummy, I also did about 5 more minutes on the recipe because I have a gas oven and it was a little under cooked when I cooked it for 35 minutes. So I cooked it for 40 minutes all together and it was perfect. My whole family snarfed them down.

I had made these a while back, but never got around to reviewing it. It was the first time I ever made brownies using unsweetened chocolate squares versus unsweetened cocoa powder and I could definitely taste the difference in chocolaty goodness. But I digress...these brownies were as promised, fudgy and very chocolaty. I made them in individual small loaf pans and they were great! Would definitely make these again.

These were fantastic!  I did do a little altering but not much; based on other reviews and the turned out so good I may not be allowed to make them again.  We can't stop eating them!  I decreased the eggs to 3 hoping for that perfect fudgieness (and it was reached) and I increased the chocolate to 6 ounces instead of 4.

I've been wary of making "from scratch" brownies because my mother is SO good at it! When I found this recipe I decided to give it a try and deny it until my dying day if they weren't any good. I've just sampled a tiny bit and they're great for consistency! I like my fudgy, not like cake at all. These turned out wonderfully. I also used the 12/3 ratio mentioned in several other reviews, as I was out of baking squares. My other tweaks, necessary due to lack of grocery shopping: 1.)I used 2 "egg beaters" and 1 egg, as I was out of eggs. 2.) I added just a little bit of salt. 3.) No nuts, used chocolate chips instead. They turned out great!

These were really good and very easy to make. I used the altered recipe that called for the 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cup sugar. I might even go with a  little less sugar next time. The family LOVED them!!

Followed others here and used a 9x9" pan, added chocolate chips and cut the eggs to just 2 and this recipe rocked!  I used Ghirardelli chocolate.  Batter will be very thick and need to be spread into the pan.  Cut the oven temp to 325 degrees and will need to bake much longer than recipe as they are much thicker.  I didn't catch the final time but at least 45-60 minutes opening the oven often to check with a toothpick. Tough to judge when done (hate when brownies look raw) but don't be afraid to leave them in there.  When you get 4 out of 5 toothpicks out clean you should be good to go.  Taste great warm and even better the next day chilled in the fridge!  Wow!  Family is still talking about them.  Hope I can repeat...

DELICIOUS fudgey brownies if you use the 2 eggs rule.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 c., and increased chocolate to 6 oz, as suggested by others.  I used 7x11 glass pan and they turned out great, but I do NOT recommend cooking them for any longer than 28-29 minutes.  Let them sit after removing from the oven, and they will still cook a bit longer.  Otherwise they do end up kind of cakey even w/ the 2 eggs.  They are also drier.  I made them twice, once I cooked for 27 minutes (they needed another minute or two), and once again tonight, but only for 33 minutes and they were a bit too dry.

These were a hit on campus!  Made two batches of these; one with nuts and one without (food allergies).   Each batch was so moist and chewy and they were easy to prepare.  Definately a hit in our house.

Another Update...here is what I do... I only use 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, a package of thawed, drained, frozen cherries(cut in half & pat dry, so not too wet) 1 cup salted butter, 1 cup flour, & a teaspoon vanilla extract, and (4) one ounce squares of Bakers chocolate. I bake in a heart shape pan that is size 8 5/8 x 8 1/2 x 1 1/2 inches in a preheated 350 degree oven for 35 minutes. They are not too sweet, fudgy, chocolatey, and everyone in the family LOVES them. I will be making them for my niece's 15th birthday next Sunday.

YUM!  These brownies are awesome!  Easy to make and fudgy, which is the best part about brownies!  I only baked them for 29 & /2 mins b/c I looked in and the top looked done.  Next time I'll bake them even a little less, but they are so good!  :)

The brownies were very good. I made a few changes by only using 2 eggs like others suggested and a 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I used 1 1 1/2 cups of sugar so that it wouldn't be too sweet. the only problem I had was that I cooked them an additional 10 min and the middle still wasn't all the way done,but the top was starting to get hard, but they were very tasty. I will make them again

I have to disagree with the reviewers that said these were too sweet. I think they tasted great! The reason for 3 stars, is that the cooking time was WAY off for me. After 35 minutes, the toothpick was still coming out very sticky. I cooked it all the way to 45 minutes and it was STILL sticky, so I just took them out anyways. Also, I greased the pan like mad and they still stuck a lot. so much that we couldn't get them out without really digging them out and ruining the shape.  So overall- taste was good. Cooking directions and texture was not good at all.

These brownies were so delicious & a great something to make on a whim when my guy is looking through the cupboards for something sweet.  A little more cakeness rather than the regular "brownie" that I was hoping for. I did read the reviews first n cut the egg down to 3 instead of 4.  This was still a very nice light treat & I just sprinkled powder sugar for a topping.  Thank you for posting this recipe, will definaltely use it again.

I made these with 2 eggs and they indeed came out fudgy (instead of cakey)...but flat!  Also, this recipe has too much sugar (reduced to 1.5 cups) and too much butter.  I would cut down on these next time.

These are sooooo yummy! I used 2 eggs and they came out nice and fudgy. I made them a second time and used a substitute for the chocolate squares. 1oz square = 3 Tbs cocoa powder + 1 Tbs oil. It comes out to 12 Tbs cocoa and 4 Tbs oil. These also turned out fabulous! If you like fudgy instead of cakey, this is the recipe for you!

I'm surprised that no one thought it was a bit too greasy.  Next time I will cut down on butter.  My first word out of my mouth was, "caramel"  I loved it.  Edges are cookie/cakey/fudgey/YUM!  Texture is great and it tastes great as well. Oh, and I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and it was still VERY good!

I couldn't begin to tell you the number of times I have made these brownies.  Every time I get good results, and a lot of compliments too!  I am going to teach my daughter how to make them because they are so easy, good to eat, and a wonderful recipes for kids learning to cook.

These were very easy to make. I just melted the butter in the microwave then added the chocolate. I also only used 2 eggs for no particular reason and they turned out great. I only used 1 3/4 cups of nuts and will reduce it to 1 cup next time.

I made it exactly as written - with the exception of substituting 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips for the walnuts (too tired to walk to the store). Brought it for a pot luck, to rave reviews. I know some people used a 9 x 9 pan, but the 9 x 13 pan made them nice and thin, and I think that made it chewier.

These brownies were very good.  I made them exactly as written. I found that they were more spongy less gooey than what I've come to expect from a brownie. I'm guessing that was due to the high number of eggs in the recipe. Also, the brownie itself didn't appear as dark as a brownie typically does. All in all, it was an easy and yummy treat

I substituted 3/4 c. unsweetened baking cocoa powder for the chocolate squares.  I also used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar instead of 2 c. white sugar.  Only baked for about 28 minutes.  They were good but plain so the next batch I added a handful of chocolate chips and swirled in 2 Tbsp. of chunky peanut butter.  Delicious.

The only change I made was adding chocolate chips instead of nuts, and they came out perfect! Super fudgy and moist.

I made this recipe and had planned to follow the instructions as they were until I didn’t. I added dried cranberries instead of the nuts and I did half teaspoon of  vanilla and half a teaspoon of almond extract (because I added the berries). Once I started to add the flour to the mixture I noticed that it was very blonde. Not much chocolate in there at all, I started to think I missed an ingredient and didn’t want to go back to my phone to check. I truly thought I must have missed writing down the cocoa powder so I added a 1/4 cup. I am so happy I added that because these brownies would have tasted strange without the extra chocolate. Anyways with my modifications the brownies were good. I don’t think I’d want to try them without the added cocoa powder. If you prefer a light chocolate flavour these are probably for you. Also, there is no way they should be called fudge brownies because this is clearly a cake brownie recipe.

I followed the recipe as listed but even if this was easy to make, I was disappointed with the results. I was expecting the brownies to be perfectly "fudgy" but the final result was that it looked and tasted more like chocolate bread than actual brownies. Besides not using unsweetened chocolate, I don't know what else was wrong. The taste is still manageable though.

Will make these again.  I made a half batch because there are only two of us eating them.  Eight by eight inch pan, used 1 egg and one egg white.  I also frosted them with chocolate chip, powdered sugar frosting.  I overbaked them a bit and should have cut baking time by at least five minutes.  Excellent and easy, easy!!

Sorry, I could not give this recipe a five star rating because I tweeked it based on experience.
If you want truly fudgey brownies, try the following;
increase unsweetened chocolate to six ounces.  Decrease flour to only 1/2 cup.  I used salted butter so I omitted the  1/2 tsp salt called for in this recipe.
Bake at 350 until toothpick comes out with a few fudgey crumbs.  A perfectly clean toothpick equals dry brownies.

I double up on the chocolate, we do like chocolate. I also used only 1 cup os sugar instead of two, we were eating them with ice cream. It was a little cake-like, but they were delicious nonetheless. Next time, I will try it with 2 eggs, instead of 4.

Very good recipe - next time I'll cut back (even more) on the sugar, and also the butter (used full amount this time).  Also thinking about adding some baking soda for just a little rise?  Versatile recipe seems goof-proof.  Substituted 1/4 of the sugar with Tang drink mix for an amazing choco-orange flavor - inspired by fabulous Tang scones from our local coffee shop.  Drink of the astronauts! :)

I read reviews before making this and so I used only two eggs and 3oz of chocolate and 2 table spoons of Coco powder. I also only used half the sugar. That being said, they were way too sweet. My husband likes sweet things more than I do, and even he said it was too much. The consistency was OK. Not very fudgy; somewhere in-between fudgy and cake. And there still wasn't a very chocolatey taste. I will be continuing my search for a better fudgy brownie.

This recipe got good reviews from my girlfriend, her 12 year old kid and her 20 or so theater friends. They now ask her "when is your boyfriend going to make more brownies?" haha. I would say that's a success! I accidentally  ended up adding double the chocolate, but it was no issue, as everyone loved them.

Really good recipe. I went pretty much according to the directions, except for two things: 1. I used semi-sweet chocolate, not having access to baking chocolate. I used 8 ounces instead of 4 with that in mind, and reduced the amount of butter used to what I guessed would be right. 2. I also reduced the amount of sugar used from 2 cups to 1 cup, both because of the semi-sweet chocolate, and because some of the reviews mentioned how very sweet the brownies were, and I prefer cakes to be less sweet. These had excellent flavour and everyone loved them, but I found them slightly too cake-like, so the next time I make them I will reduce the baking time by 5 or 6 minutes. and report here on how that turned out.

Mine were plenty chocolatey, but I used 4 oz. of straight baking cocoa whisked into the melted butter.  That may be too rich for some people.  The brownies turned out great for me.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

4oz (4 squares) of unsweetened chocolate 

This would have been more clear in the writing of the recipe. 

I'm sure I'll rerate this once I make it again. But for the first time around... clearly I was mistaken about the 1oz of chocolate being in parentheses. Because the weight was in parentheses I assumed it meant the total weight. So they didn't come out correctly because I only wound up using a quarter of the chocolate I was supposed to.

Nearly perfect, but just a little too crumbly.  My kids and I made them and they enjoyed adding 2 cups of sugar as I cringed a little.  We will definitely make them a few more times.

These brownies are great! My roommate said they were the best brownies she ever had. I made a few adjustments to make them super fudgy and moist. I typically use cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate, just since it's what I have on hand.
Adjustments:
- 2 eggs instead of 4.
- used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. oil
- substituted 6 squares of chocolate with 1 1/8 c. of baking cocoa (plus 2 Tbs. oil instead of the recommended 6 Tbs. I tried 6, and it was WAY too oily.)
- used 1 3/4 c. sugar instead of 2 cups.

Relatively easy to make and very tasty. Definitely increase the chocolate, though. 

If you don't like cake-like brownies, then this is not a great recipe for you.

Almost gave this 4 stars just because I couldn't resist having some for breakfast.. But I guess I'll take responsibility for that. Haha! These were delicious!!! I used 8oz of chocolate squares instead of 4 and I used coconut palm sugar in place of most of the white sugar (only because I ran out of white sugar) and they came out amazing! Not too sweet, nice and crunchy. Love love love!

My husband is a, shall we say, a brownie snob.  If they are not chewy, chocolaty and milk worthy he will not touch 'em.  THESE MET ALL OF MR.'s critique!  I did not add the walnuts and added 2 more oz of squares.  VERY VERY quick & easy to make even with having to melt the chocolate. SOOO much better than boxed.  YEP THESE ARE A KEEPER!!

I'm rating these a "5", but writing this review as a BIG HUGE WARNING. I did not have baker's chocolate, but did have lots of chocolate chips. So, I subbed the same measurements of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the measurements listed of chocolate squares+sugar. And, I only used 2 eggs as recommended by others. All other ingredients, I left the same. The brownies came out edible and tasting fine, but they were so crumbly that they were not suitable for serving at the picnic I planned to take them the next day. DON'T TRY TO SUBSTITUTE IN THIS FASHION - IT WON'T WORK! I think the way these turned out, they would be great crumbled over ice cream, though.

These are tasty. These were cake-like brownies but they were delicious tasting. I will try it again but next time I will definitely use only 2 eggs and maybe a few tablespoons of oil... Otherwise they were a lot of fun to make and again - Very tasty. I added frosting to mine as well.

Modified this, but the recipe was a great base to start from.  Used 4oz of Godiva 60% bittersweet baking chocolate, 2 T cocoa powder, and 2 eggs, baked in a 9x9 glass pan.  It took almost an hour for the center to finish, but the results were amazing.

These were so good! I followed other reviewers suggestions. I used 3 eggs rather then 4, added some choc chips to the batter, three in about a cup of raspberries that I had to use bc they were starting to go bad and baked it in an 8x8 square pan. It took about 35 minutes Til it was done. I then frosted them with chocolate fudge icing. It was soooo good. The brownies stuck to our teeth! Yummmm

I loved this recipe, I make them all the time for my moms co workers and they have nicknamed them "magic brownies" . I usually add chocolate chips instead of walnuts but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. These have even won the approval of my brownie hating friends.

So I used 3 eggs, 6oz of chocolate, 1 1/2 cup butter and some chocolate chips and they came out as the best brownies I have ever had. The one problem we all had with them was they were so rich and chocolate-y that we couldn't have more than one. They also ruined my Moms diet a little bit. After 20 mins of baking I put on top some leftover yummies I found around the kitchen: mini chocolate chips, white chocolate chunks, Andes creame de menthe chips, a drizzle of sweetened condensed milk, and sweetened coconut shavings. That probably contributed to how crazy sweet they ended up being. All in all I felt like a food wizard after making these incredible brownies!

These were so delicious! I used the recipe as is, and baked for 35 min. The brownie was very moist with the 4 eggs, but I found them to be a bit too sweet for my liking. I might reduce the amount of sugar to 1.5 c or even 1 cup instead of the 2. I'm not sure what that would do to the consistency though. Overall, they were very moist and delicious. Would definitely make again.

These Brownies are amazing! I love a fudgy brownie and these definitely are. Unfortunately I read too many reviews about them being dry or too cake and people using 6 oz chocolate. I used the normal 4 of unsweetened baker's chocolate but then had just 1 oz of semi-sweet so I added that. I think this added too much liquid into the batter because no matter how long I cook them, the brownies are still gooey. So I'm really hoping they firm up a bit over night so I can take them into the office. Luckily for me (and unluckily for my pants) I really like gooey brownies that taste like fudge. I would say these are hands down the best brownies I have ever made, and don't change the recipe.  It doesn't need any alterations at all. It is a very rich brownie though.

Just had two of these (couldn't stop @ just one;) after making for the first time. Followed others' advice and used 1 1/2 c sugar, 1 1/2 sticks butter, 2 eggs and 6oz. choc. & about 1oz. of milk choc.(just b/c I had it on hand)  I also used whole wheat flour instead of reg. AP flour;b/c I already had it out...so SHHH! No nuts (Hubby doesn't like:( and baked in 7X11 glass pan for 35 min. They turned out yummy! Rich, chewy middle and hard, crusty edges...PERFECT! Might experiment with a little less butter next time, but that's just b/c I can't leave a recipe alone! Thanks for sharing!!!

Quick and easy recipe. They came out awesome! No complaints. Followed the recipe exact, no adding, subtracting, or reducing ingredients. If anyone is having trouble with this recipe I would make sure your ingredients are EXACTLY the same and you follow the procedure precisely.

These were so delicious! Easiest brownie recipe I've seen, and they came out perfect.  For the chocolate squares, I used 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder + 1/4 cup shortening instead, and they were moist and yummy!

Don't waste your time or ingredients on this recipe. After reading a few of the positive reviews, it seemed as though most of them tweaked the recipe a little, which is what I should have done had I not been in a hurry. But the recipe as it is written is just plain bad. It comes out cakey and dry and bland. It doesn't even make a good cake. People tweak this recipe because it needs tweaking. I wish I never wasted my good chocolate.

I followed the directions exactly - but these turned out too greasy. I am thinking 1 cup of flour wasn't enough - or maybe less butter. As a result, these turned out crumbly and greasy. The taste was excellent, so I will be trying to modify the recipie to work. I don't know how the others who rated this so highly did it - ???

This is the only brownie recipe I use now. They are perfect! If you want a "fudgy" brownie and not a "cake" brownie, this is it I only use my handwritten recipe cards for recipes that are going to be used year after year. This one made the cut! DELICIOUS! FYI-I made no changes to the recipe, I bake them exactly as described (sometimes I do leave out walnuts, depending on who will be eating them).

My family LOVED this recipe.  It was probably the best brownie I ever made or eaten.  I did tweak it a bit based on other reviewers.  I only used 2 eggs, 1 3/4 cup butter, a little less sugar and I put 1 cup of  Ghittard round chocolate pieces instead of nuts right before I baked them.  I also used a 8 X 8 pan and cooked for 40 min.  Outstanding, thanks for sharing!!!

Delicious! I rarely use bakers chocolate; I substituted special dark cocoa (3/4 c) plus extra unsalted butter (4 Tbsp).  Also, I used unsalted butter and I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. Not sure why so much salt is used in desserts.  Salt does control the rise when leavening is used, but there's no leavening in this recipe.  I used a scant cup of flour, because it’s the amount of flour that has more effect than eggs on the “cake vs fudge” debate, in my opinion.

Dusted with confectioner's sugar and not overbaked, you end up with a lovely looking and rich tasting dark chocolate brownie.

Absolutely the best fudge brownies I have ever had!  No photo because they disappear so quickly.... every time I make them.  I never add the nuts because we don't like nuts in our brownies.  Recipe easy to make and fast.

Only used 3 eggs and 1 cup sugar. Mixed in 6 oz each of chocolate and white choc chips. When done baking, spread 3oz each of chocolate and white choc chips over warm brownies - swirled and let cool.

Great and easy recipe - Thanks for sharing! :) 

I'd make half the quantity. Add 1 tbsp ready-to-drink coffee or 1 teaspoon instant coffee powder alongwith butter and cocoa powder. Coffee really enhance the chocolate flavour. Then in a 9" square pan, bake for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with wet crumbs. I'm out of butter so I'm going to substitute it with around 80 ml or 3/4 cup + 1 tbsp cup canola oil. I'm pretty sure it would turn out just as good! :)

I read suggestions and listened to a few. I used 1 cup of Ghirardelli cocoa bits (60%cocoa), 2 eggs, 1.5c sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond. baked for 45 minutes. The key to the perfect brownie is to let it cool. I will definitely play with this recipe. My husband has devoured them.

I like gooey brownies but these didn't even set up enough, after being fully cooled, to get them out of the pan.    They barely had any chocolate flavor.  Sorry but I will not try these again.

This recipe is a good base to start from. But it is not a perfected recipe. I have quite a sweet tooth, but it is too still sweet and I even lowered the sugar to 1 3/4 cup. I also did only 2 eggs and that made it plenty soft and chewy. I could actually taste the salt in the brownies so the salt proved to be unnecessary because probably because I used salted butter. I added 1 tsp of cocoa because of the reviews saying there was a lack of chocolate flavor and because other recipes called for it. But that ended up being unnecessary as well and the cocoa flavor stood out too much as well. The overall texture of the brownies was rather granular from the sugar and salt even though I added the sugar to the hot mixture. I think maybe if there were a little more flour, it would have helped with that and maybe also balanced out the sweetness. I also used 1 cup of chocolate chips like others recommended which turned out fine.

These brownies were good, but not good for plain brownie eating though. I had to add a cup of milk to the batter because I used Cocoa powder and not a chocolate bar, it made the brownies very bitter. We ate them heated under vanilla ice cream and with fudge on top; it was good. Again though, everyone complained it was a little to dark.

I think I maybe shouldn't have used the Kitchen Aid mixer to mix it up...it created a layer of air immediately on top of the brownies and a layer of sugar-crust above the air!  To me, they are pale, no where near chocolate-y enough, and WAY too much refined sugar flavor.  But my son has proclaimed them the best brownies he ever put in his mouth.   :-)

These brownies were amazing! This was the first time I've ever baked brownies from scratch, and this was pretty easy. The only thing I might change next time is use 2 or 3 eggs as opposed to 4, because I prefer my brownies reallllly fudgey....... I also added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix, as suggested by another reviewer. These were delicious! I'm definitely going to make them again.

I made these 1 yr ago as a going away snack for a friend on her way overseas. She practically had to pry it out of my hands. She LOVED them too!They were fabulous. Definitely rich enough with the 4oz of choc in my opinion. I followed the recipe to the letter though 1 batch with walnuts, 1 without. I never forgot how great they were, so I'm writing a yr later. Definitely going to make again, probably tonight!

I used only 2 eggs and increased the chocolate to 6 oz as suggested by other reviews. The brownies were nice and fudgy but pretty greasy. No one seemed to mind and they were eaten up quickly.

These are great-not cakey-just a bit gooey, just like we like them.  I only had three squares of bakers chocolate-so I used an extra 2tbls of butter and 1/4cup of powdered coco.  Turned out great.  Next time I'll be sure to have enough bakers chocolate on hand- because I know I'll make these again. Great recipe- beats the box for sure.

My first chocolate fudge brownies and it was a success! As I didn't have a 9x13 inch pan, I used a 8x8 inch pan instead. I used only 3 eggs, and I cut down the sugar to only 300g, 2 teaspoon vanilla extract. IT'S PERFECT!!! Crispy on the top and sides, and fudgey in the middle! All my friends and family LOVE IT!!! I'd baked 3 times already, and everytime it turns out well! Eat it with vanilla ice-cream, it's freaking GOOD! I will definitely stick to this recipe! :D

Excellent! These are almost as easy as making a box mix - literally a few minutes and it was done. I followed another reviewers suggestion and only used 2 eggs, which made these nice and fudgy/chewy. Great stuff!

I found these brownies to be too greasy and oversweet. I think cutting the grease and sugar in half may be a better choice. I made them in a 9x9 pan for my family of six and after five days there was still plenty of brownies. That's telling. Still searching for a great brownie recipe.

these brownies were really good but i would make one adjustment. it says a 13x9 inch pan but do NOT do this, the brownies burn really quickly and turn brittle and i had to throw out half of them. i would recommend a 9x9 or a little bigger but not too big. I tried making them again with the adjustment and they were perfect. i also recommend buying some of those caramel squared and chopping them up, pouring half the batter in, then sprinkle about 1 1/2 - 2 cups of those, then the rest of the batter. they tasted soooooo good!!

YUMMY, these brownies are delicious!  I used 3 eggs, 4 1oz squares of unsweetened chocolate and 1 1oz square of semi-sweet and they are very rich.  I cooked them in a 9X9 for 30 minutes.  They are quite thick, so next time I might try a 9X13, but we loved them, definitely a keeper.

These brownies came out very well. Very gooey and chocolaty. I dont agree with a lot of the reviews saying they are too sweet. They are NOT too sweet. They are just how a brownie should be. I followed the recipe exactly except used only three eggs cuz thats all i had. They are a bit too gooey in the middle. The middle didnt bake as well. But they really do taste good. I liked them!

These brownies have a great fudge taste, once you alter the recipe! I only added 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Then I got the fudgy consistency that I was looking for! Will definately make again!

I don't know what I did wrong, but these certainly shouldn't be called FUDGE brownies. They were more spongy than anything. They still tasted good, but I don't think I'll tell people they're supposed to be FUDGE brownies...

I made these for our Super Bowl Party.  I didn't add nuts and drizzled with melted chocolate chips.  They were very good and didn't last long.  Love the name Yukonchicka!

This is the exact recipe I used from the Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook that my mother bought me 25 years ago when I went to college.  It's a good, easy basic brownie recipe.

This turned out horrible for me.  It was hard, crumbly and not very sweet at all.  Not chewy and moist or even cake like.  I even changed the eggs to two like suggested by others and I was sorely disappointed.  I've made lots of different brownie recipes and never had this happen.  Sorry.

Went with one baker's recommendation on these: use only 2 eggs and bake in a 9x9 pan.  Amazing.  Also, if you don't have squares of unsweetened chocolate, you can substitute 12 T of unsweetened cocoa and 4 additional T of butter.  Tastes just as amazing.

I increased the chocolate to 6oz. like others reccomended and they tasted great.  I also cooked in a 9x9 pan which I wouldn't reccomend they turned out 3in thick!  I thought they were too cakey and a little dry but the taste was good.

These brownies are delicious.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add about 1/2 tsp. more of vanilla.  They are very fudgy and gooey, just the way I like them.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is really good, but I did follow some of the modifications of other reviewers (2 eggs, etc). Next time, I will try the recipe as written. The brownies are really chocolaty, but are also kind of buttery and fudgy. Really good.

great brownies. I avoided them being to caky by only using three eggs and putting them all in at once and beating them together.  They were very fudge like and gooey.  Next time though I think I will use less butter, maybe 3/4 of a cup or 1/2 cup, you could really taste the butter, not so hot.

ABSO-BLOODY-LUTELY AMAZING!! I tweaked it a bit, added a bit more flour and only 3 eggs. The aroma is spine-tinglingly delightful, and a #1 hit in my step-dad's eyes. I've made it 3 times already, and am going to make a huge batch for my cousin's birthday party tomorrow. The family is sure to love it! Thank SO much for this amazing recipe!! I recommend it to all choco-holics. A diamond-encrusted trophy for you, good lady/sir.

Eternally grateful,

~S.

To be honest I wasn't particularly impressed with these brownies, but I went ahead and rated them 5 stars because I modified the recipe according to other reviewers' recommendations. (I've always thought it unfair for people to change a recipe then complain that it wasn't that great.) I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I think that's why the brownies weren't as fudgy as I wanted. Perhaps the extra sugar would have made them just a little chewier.  Also, I reduced the eggs to 2, but I do agree that having 4 eggs would make them too cake-y.

I changed a couple of things--2 eggs, used salted butter and omit the 1/2 teaspoon, 1 1/4 cup sugar and used semisweet chocolate squares. Texture was still a little cakey and crumbly for my liking. Taste was ok, but too sweet. I'll blame part of it on the chocolate (although semisweet baking squares are still pretty bitter). I'll cut sugar down to 1 cup if I make them again. The hubby like them, though!

I could eat the whole pan. I have made this several times and if you are effecient it takes no more time to make these over the box mix and in my opinion way better. In addition, somehow I feel better knowing exactly what is in what I am eating (not a bunch of chems)

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  Often when I make homemade brownies, I make a glaze to go on them because they seem a bit dry.  I didn't even need to with these.  They were great.

2/2/08 update: Used 8x8 pan, 1 egg, 4 oz bitter chocolate, generous 1/2 cup flour, 1/8 teaspoon almond flavor, 1 stick butter, no salt, and only 1/2 white sugar.  Baked at 325 for 20 minutes and they were only about a 1/2 inch thick, but they were fudgy and chewy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside---perfect!!!!! If anyone tries this, let me know what you think!!! Thanks for the basic recipe!!!!

These were great! Very simple and delicious recipe!
Per PP's suggestions I only used 2 eggs.
I also added chocolate chips.

These were very thick, fudgy and gooey! YUM!

followed advice and added less eggs, which is a must. i can never find the pans i need, so this all went in an 8x8 pan and i cooked them a little longer. i think they are too buttery, but other than that, the flavor is pretty good. i did make on-hand adjustments: i added, in addition to the called-for 4 squares, a square of 70% cocoa chocolate (ghiradelli, i know i'm spelling that wrong) and another 1/4 cup of their chocolate chips. high quality chocolate will make the difference every time. my husband, who is really the pickiest man on the planet, swears these are his favorite brownies.

While these brownies were very sweet, I struggled to find the real, rich chocolate flavor I look for in a brownie. I love the "homemade taste", but will look for another recipe. Thanks anyway!
