Baked this a week earlier, and for Thanksgiving.  It was an extremely moist cake, and delicious!  I had no trouble getting it out of the bowl--just ran a knife around the sides.  However, we weren't fond of the frosting the first time, so the second one I baked I just beat a pint of heavy cream with a package of instant vanilla pudding (next time I'll use the cheesecake flavored pudding mix) until light and fluffy.

I made this last week and covered the top with shaved white chocolate instead of coconut and it was a HIT at my dinner party!  It took about 1h15m to cook.

I haven't eaten it yet, but was very disappointed - I followed the directions, and the cake stuck- I will try again but mix in a different bowl and grease the one I'm baking in.

The cake was absolutely delicious even though the center filling didn't turn out right. However I greased the bowl I baked it in and it came out of the bowl very easy. I had company the evening I made it and everyone love it.

This is a real show-off!  Delicious and not difficult.  Sorry, Cool Whip, but I made my own whipped cream.

I make it in a clean bowl too. I like to pour the cream cheese mix in first, then pour the devil's food over it. That way, the layers are clearly separate. Color the coconut green (3 tbs milk and 3 drops green coloring) to make an Easter cake!

This recipe should have a disclaimer:  LET COOL COMPLETELY BEFORE FLIPPING OUT OF BOWL.  With that said, it was a goopy mess because I rushed it.  Better yet, stick it in the fridge over night before flipping.  Also, I did as another user suggested and used white chocolate pudding mix for the icing part of the recipe, and it tasted terrific.

Cute cake, loved the icing. Be sure cake is all the way cooled. Mine was a bit warm and the icing thinned and slid down the sides a bit.

This was a beautiful cake I served at an office potluck during the holidays by adding sliced spearmint candy and cinnamon candies to make holly decorations on it.  My family doesn't like coconut so for Christmas dinner I made a white cake and used pistachio pudding for the frosting and it was a big hit.  This would be a great year round recipe decorated by whatever holiday you are serving it on.

Turned out great! But I mixed it in one bowl and had another heat-proof bowl that was greased and floured that I poured the batter into and baked it in. No sticking at all! The filling was great! And the icing was light and not greasy at all (like some icings can be).

Super moist and delicious. Everyone raved. I used real whipped cream instead of cool whip. Perfect.

I only gave it 4 stars because the edge of the cake got hard waiting for the middle to get done. And if you want a  truly white snowball. DO NOT use vanilla it turns it pale yellow. Next time I will try white chocolate pudding. Worked great with fat free cool whip and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

Cake was met with raves! I made the frosting recipe* & put on the coconut on the night before serving. Love a cake to mellow overnight. Not only I find it more flavorful & more homemade flavor! The only thing different: *I used in the frosting 3/4 cup milk. I love this frosting & use it all the time but find 1 cup milk is too much milk. This is a great frosting for any cake (without the coconut) for a chocolate mousse frosting using chocolate pudding or a lemon frosting too, using instant lemon pudding!

I like the idea of a "snowball " cake, it has a pretty presentation, but the filling, in my mind, leaves something to be desired.  It is way too dense and not sweet enough. If I were to make it again, I would bake the cake without the filling, then after it is baked, I would make a very light whipped icing filling and, using a big pastry bag with a big tip, fill the dome of the cake with it (like filling donuts).  Or, slice the top off the cake, scoop out some cake, fill it, replace the top and finish as recipe states.

Wow! I made this last night for my husband's birthday because I wanted something different than just regular chocolate cake. I followed the directions exactly. It was so easy to make, little clean-up, and absolutely delicious. Everyone loved it! My father-in-law even had to come back over today to pick up an extra piece because he enjoyed it so much. I plan to make this again very soon!

Well, it was a  good cake, I'll give you that but to me just a chocolate cake with cool whip icing, I didn't have vanilla so I used lemon and all you could really taste was lemon on top of chocolate,nothing special and making a round cake is hard! I don't know about other people out there but I would suggest leaving the cake in the oven LONGER than suggested.

I made this for the first time 3 years ago.  It is such a favorite that I now am making 1 for Thanksgiving, 3 for Christmas and last Easter I made one in the shape of an egg.  Always the star at desert time.

I have made this cake a few times and is always a hit.  I make a few changes.  I make the cake from the recipe on the back of the Hershey coco power and substitute the cool whip for heavy whipped cream and I bake it in a bundt pan.
