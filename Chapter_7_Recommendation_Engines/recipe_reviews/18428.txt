This recipe turned out very well.  I made a delicious bottom and top crust.  The only thing missing was the fluted edge.  The filling was a little bland for my taste so I added more cinnamon and nutmeg.  The filling seemed a little dry but not too dry.  I did let the pie set on the table for about 20 minutes before putting it into the oven as other "makes its own crust"  recipes direct.  I may try adding more liquid next time but that may also make the top crust disappear.

This was one of the worst recipes I have ever tried.  I do not recommed it.  No "crust" was formed, the flavor can best be described as bland and it looked disgusting!  Nothing about this recipe is good.  I would suggest you not waste your time on this recipe.

I like that you didnt have to make or buy a crust with this one. the first time I made it i followed it word for word, the 2nd time I changed it,I also doubled it. Well most of it, I only put 1.5 cups of flour and after I mixed butter/sugar/eggs, I added the flour AND the apples and mixed it around. Also used 1 cup of butter instead. Worked out better and had more of a crust like appeal to it. My 3 boys LOVED it...also sprinkled cinnamon on top of it.

We love this recipe because it's a lot less work than your normal apple pie... BUT... it can come out a bit like "cake" if you don't measure the flour correctly.  We also tend to put less sugar in it, only because we don't like our deserts so sweet.  That being said, the best compliment I can give is that 9 of the last 10 apple pies that we've made have been this recipe!

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but I figured I would try it because the calories and fat from the crust are cut out. I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the recipe because it didn't seem sweet enough.  The ingredients that make the "crust" were very dry, according to the recipe it seemed like it would be more liquid. But it turned out okay, it didn't really seem to make a "crust" but it did hold together at the bottom.

Though this pie looked pretty weird, it tasted pretty good. It could have been a little sweeter, but I thought it was pretty good overall. Very easy to make.

This was an O.K. recipe. I found it fairly bland, but my 14 month old LOVED it. I don't think I'll make it again & if I did, I think I'd add more sugar & perhaps something to make it a bit more moist? The only thing really great about is how easy it is to put together.

This recipe didn't really make a crust, and by the time it was done baking, the apples seemed a little dry.  Also, it wasn't very sweet.

Pretty darn good! I was a little nervous in trying this recipe because of some of the other reviews, but I'm glad I did.   I didn't have any pre-made pie crusts and hate making my own crusts with a passion. When I mixed everything together, it did seem a little dry so I added some soy milk. I also added a little less sugar than called for, a dash of nutmeg and little more cinnamon. Because we didn't have any eggs on hand, I used egg replacer.   It turned out great. I think what some people need to realize when making any recipe is that sometimes you need to play around with it a little. I don't necessarily mean to make it completely unrecognizable to the original recipe, but make a few small modifications if something isn't working (try adding more moisture, or not as much, different spices, etc).   This really is a nice recipe (hubby even loved it) that is probably in need of a bit of tweaking by whoever cooks it, but this is a keeper! Thanks for posting it.

This turned out very well. I baked it in a 9x9 greased glass pan for about 50 min.  I thought the dough was very dry when I mixed in the apples.  I had to add a tiny amount of water and decided to put a little vanilla extract in there too.  It baked well, turned out perfect and was delicious. I will be making it again using our home grown golden delicious apples. My husband liked the recipe very much, as did I.  great with coffee!

very easy, but not very good. Weird texture and taste. Had to cook it longer to get it to be firm also.

I dislike the taste and dryness of regular pie crust, so when I found this recipe I had to try it. The first time it was very bland. This time, I used butter instead of margarine, added a splash of vanilla extract, a sprinkle of apple pie spice and then sprinkled some brown sugar on top. The taste was amazing and juicy. No need to add any other liquid, tho I did contemplate it when I was adding the apples. Everyone loved it!

I love this recipe.  It is very simple and easy.  I add to the batter a tsp. vanilla, nutmeg, and ginger.  I thinly slice my apples and only fold in about a 1/4 into the batter.  The rest I layer on top and brush with milk and then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  So yummy!

This is a very good apple cake, by no means a pie, I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and still found it to be too sweet will try 1/2 cup next time. Everyone liked it at the potluck, sprinkled top with rolled oats to fancy up a bit.

I used apples from our apple tree for this recipe and it turned out pretty well. The apples were small so we ended up using 9 or 10. I played with it a little, added a few tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and a tsp of vanilla before folding in the apples. I also added about a 1/4 cup of rasins and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon before baking. The finished product wasn't as pretty as the picture shown but it tasted really good.

I thought this was a great recipe, however, it needs to be tweaked depending on your own taste. I added more cinnamon & also nutmeg. It is not very sweet, which is another thing I liked about it. Also, it comes out more like a cake than a pie. I also doubled the recipes & used a larger pan.

I have a recipe close to this except it has 2 eggs instead one. Also, it has 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. If you have trouble with the recipe above you may want to try my suggestions.

So I've just taken this pie out of the oven had had my first bites.  I love it but I can't say I didn't change it a bit.  Based on others reviews I added about a 1/4 cup more sugar and added  a dash of nutmeg, dash of cloves, a tsp of vanilla and about a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I chopped the apples and added about 6 oz of fresh raspberries.  I think its a great success but would probably rather call it a cobbler that a pie since the crust is throughout. Seems like a great recipe thats interchangable with whatever fruits you want.

This pie was a big hit! And it was so easy!  Actually, it seems like a cross between and pie and  cake!  I added about 1/4 cup more butter and sprinkled some cinnamon on the top before I baked it!  It made it’s own crust just like the recipe said it would.  The batter was very thick when I put it in the pie plate and this worried me, but it was delicious when served warm a scoop of Creme Brule’ Ice Cream!

I thought this was good, I did follow someones advise and up'd the butter.  It is more of a apple cobbler type dessert but it does have the taste of apple pie.  I will make it again!

This is a great dessert!  I fudged a bit because I was using up some blemished apples that were given to me and there were more than the recipe called for.  I also used apple pie spice that I had.  I believe it's hard to ruin this recipe, which makes it perfect for me!

The mix seemed a bit dry, so I sprinkled some sweetened lime juice over the apples before I added them.  It gave it some moisture.  Turned out great!

I love this recipe. My family and neighbors wait for these every year. I have 2 apple trees that are loaded with apples. I make apple butter, apple crisp and apple pies. By the end of all that baking I'm ready for something simple. This is it. I may add vanilla or cinnamon but nothing drastic. It's a great way for me to finish my apple season.

This worked out great, I added a 1/2 cup more sugar and about another teaspoon of cinnamon.  I think it could have used more apples, but overall I thought it was really good.  It crusted on the top like said, and it was really easy to make.
