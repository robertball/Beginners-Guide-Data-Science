Great recipe.  One suggestion.  Remove the seeds from the Zucchini.  That will take away the after taste and the slices look like apple slices.  Also make sure the zucchini is sliced very thin.

Okay, I was VERY excited to try this and fool everyone into thinking it was apple and not zucchini.  I do quite a bit of baking and have successfully made many different desserts.  For this one I followed the recipe exactly, however no one mistook it for apple.  It did LOOK like apple cobbler, but after the first bite it was obvious that it wasn't.  It just seemed not-quite-right and had a definite non-apple aftertaste.  The more crust in the bite, the better - I took a bite and got mostly zucchini and it was not good.  After that, I couldn't finish it - and I ALWAYS finish dessert.  My husband says that this proves the zucchini doesn't belong in dessert.  We threw the rest out, and I won't be making this again.  Oh well, it was worth a shot.  Is it apple season yet???

This is absolutely fantastic!!  I make this often and take it in to work, and I am showered with complements.  Yum, yum, yum!!  

I have also learned that I can make this using less zucchini than it calls for.  Whatever I have on hand is the amount I use.  (I have used as little as 4 cups and as much as 8 cups- I just adjust the amount of lemon juice accordingly and leave everything else the same.)

This recipe is 6 stars!  ******

Outstanding! And I really adjusted the topping so it would fit my dietary restrictions.(Usually the result is so-so but not for this recipe!) I used Equal in place of all the sugar and doubled the cinnamon. I used oat flour, whole oats, oat bran, butter buds and applesauce for the topping. I did halve the topping ingredients as suggested by others and it worked out great. My version worked out to two and a half points on the weight watcher plan and that was for one large portion. OOOOOOOOOOOOO it's so good!!!

This was wonderful!  I served a bunch of baked goods at a church function that all had zucchini in them and this was the biggest hit.  Some didn't believe that it wasn't apples.  I added a little oatmeal (probably about 3/4 cup) to the top crust and it was yummy!  I also added extra melted butter to the top that made the crust more crispy.

Ok, I'm not going to lie.  I wasn't fooled a bit.  The bitterness of zucchini was very strong and overwhelming.  I would suggest slicing the zucchini, salting them (like an eggplant), then rinsing off the salt and trying this recipe.  That way the bitterness is gone.  and it doesn't taste like you accidently threw the veggies in the cobbler and the apples in the soup.

Well, I had to try it because I have too many zukes - and we all loved it!  My husband, who can always figure out substitutions, was totally fooled.  To make it more appealing to him, I sprinkled raisins over the top of the zucchini mixture (before the crumb topping) and added a little uncooked oatmeal to the crumb topping.  Awesome!

Oh yes, this does taste like apple cobbler!  I had a huge zucchini, used part for brownies (see Marian's recipe) and used the rest for this - wasn't near 8 cups so I halved the recipe, basically.  The only addition I had was to mix in a packet of reduced sugar maple and cinnamon instant oatmeal to the butter/flour mixture and to use Splenda instead of regular sugar.  Yummyyyyyy with low-fat vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is DEEE-licious!  I served it at a scrapbooking party that my mom had, and all the ladies LOVED it!  Almost all of them asked for the recipe, and they were shocked that it was zucchini and not apple cobbler.  I baked mine in a 9x13 and added oatmeal and melted butter to the topping.  5 stars!

Excellent!... After reading other reviews I decided to seed the zucchini first... Mixed the lemon juice with half white and half packed brown sugar and spices as directed until melted, then added the zucchini, simmered for 5 minutes, poured into the waiting baking dish and followed through as directed... I did add a light dusting of cinnamon and sugar to the top while still hot out of the oven... I have to rate this as a very serious, outstanding, easy recipe...

My mother in law gave me this recipe when I first met my husband.  She has been making this recipe for over 30 years and now I have been making it for over 10!  The only things that are different between the two recipes are that we peel, then cut the zucchini in half lenghtwise and then scrape all the seeds out with a sppon.  Then slice the zucchini very thinly-a mandolin slicer works great!  Also, prebaking the bottom crust after you press it into the pan for about 10 min brfore putting the filling on-this prevents the bottomw from getting soggy!  My family and I love this dessert and it turns many people into zucchini lovers!

My family has been making this for years at Christmas but I have one big change to make to this recipe - for those that say its not quite right and doesnt taste like apple or its too bitter--When cooking the zucchini with the lemon juice, also ADD 1/2 cup of BROWN SUGAR. This takes away the tart, adds sweetness and makes the zucchini more closely resemble apples. The kids in our family have been fooled by this dessert for years thinking it was apple. Hope that helps!

In order to have the flavor and appearance of apples the best zucchini to use are the huge ones. Be sure to peel and quarter them and cut out all the seeds.  Slice into quarter inch slices and it will look just like apples!  The smaller zucchini don't work as well.

I've used this recipe for years and everyone is always amazed that it's zucchini.  I let the zuke get really big, then peel and seed it, then slice the white part to use in the recipe.  I also make just the filling part and freeze it for later use when the garden is producing an abundance.

I'm sold!! This is fabulous. I was so excited to trick my family (hehe)... I peeled and chopped most discreetly and threw away all evidence. Husband even came to check out what I was cooking up in the pan and made some comment about cooked apples and went on with what he was doing... I chucked inside. Soon the house filled with the best Apple Cobbler aroma :) and everyone started to get excited (*snicker*)! I followed this recipe to a tee, but baked it in a 9x13. RAVE reviews, hot from oven and reheated. I wish you could've been here when I told them "the big secret" ;) thank you for a great recipe and the most excellent entertainment... I had so much fun :D and... they asked for seconds!

Wow, who knew? My 2 and 4 year old girls are gobbling it down as I type saying 'so yummy mummy!' I went with Emaperu's review and used her recipe for the topping which was fabulous, it is as follows: - 1 1/4 c. oats, 1c. flour, 1/2 c. wheat germ, 1/3 c. nuts, 1 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c butter, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg & salt. Press half in the bottom of the pan and sprinkle the rest on top- I used almonds and walnuts and it made it. I also used whole wheat flour as it was all I had and it was just as good.  Final tester was dubious husband, who loved it. Yea!

With the abundance of zucchini we have coming out of our garden I came online to look for recipes. When I read the name of this one, I thought...."YUCK" I then read the reviews and said to myself...uses 8 cups of zucchini, and 5 star review...let me try it. You would never guess it was made with zucchini. Brought some to my brothers and he too was shocked it was made with zucchini. Had it warm with whipped cream, later when it was cold, and both ways it was excellent! Don't be afraid...try it. You will be glad you did!!

Amazing recipe! Modified it to be gluten-free by changing the topping and only used 4 cups of zucchini. Gluten free topping: 1/2 C. each of GF oat flour, rolled oats, brown sugar and butter (chilled). Mix all dry together and cut in butter to small pebbles. Mix half the topping into the zucchini and spread in pan, then sprinkle remaining topping over zukes and bake 350 deg. for about 35-40 minutes. (20 servings = 100 cal/serving) My mom absolutely HATES veggies, especially zucchini and she really liked this. Better than apple cobbler!

My husband HATES, no... HATED, zucchini until I made this.  He loved it when it tasted just like apples.   I served this for company and NO ONE had any idea it was zucchini.   They didn't believe me when I told them the truth. It's great for those zucchini that were hidden underneath leaves.  I'm making it again tonight for my bible study group.

A great way to use up all the zucchini that I over- planted in my garden (oops)! Do as other reviewers suggested and remove the seeds of the zucchini. I had no complaints about this recipe. Delicious!

This is crazy.  It tastes just like apples!  My suggestion, use fresh juice from a lemon, not bottled. If you are using a "monster zucchini" scrape out and discard the seeds in the middle.

Took a chance on this and made it for our speech/debate group dinner tonight . . . and was NOT disappointed!!!  Though I didn't get feedback from all the kids (they eat quickly then move into the next portion of their club meeting), my family REALLY enjoyed it!!!    Yes - the zucchini looked like chopped apples and tasted like apples!  I used one larger zucchini and six smallish-regular sized ones and ended up a bit short of the eight-cups.  Most of the bulk of the zucchini is scraped out to seed it - so this really is perfect for a bumper crop of this garden staple!!!  Love the recipe!  It's a keeper!!!

Wow!  I was so skeptical but since I had an enormous zuke to use I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  What a pleasant surprise!  I made it for my family and they, too, were amazed. The only change I made was to make the cobbler in two 8 x 8 foil pans.  This allowed me to take one to my family dinner and freeze the other.  Everyone who ate the cobbler tonight said it was delicious and rich.  Loved this recipe and especially loved fooling everyone!

Tastes just like apple crisp! Use 1/2 the white sugar the recipe states and substitute with 1/2 packed brown sugar. Add oatmeal to crumble on the top.

Delicious way to use up the abundance of zucchini that comes along every summer! Anyone who doesn't like this recipe probably didn't make it right. I've made it every week since the zucchini was ready and it never lasts more than a day at my house. I usually add about 2 cups more zucchini to make the filling thicker (and to use more zucchini) and add a little more spice than called for.

The key is to cut the circle of seeds out of the middle before using.  I took this to a community garden potluck and all of my colleagues requested this recipe.  You could not tell that the apple taste was actually zucchini.  This is a keeper.  I will now experiment with a different crumb topping.

The whole family loved this recipe.  No one knew they were eating a vegetable.  I plan on making more batches of the filling and freezing for "apple" pies.  My father grows great zucchinis and now I have a use for them.

I am impressed with this recipe!  I am constantly looking for new and yummy ways to use up that abundance of zucchini, and this one delivers.  The only thing I did different was to sprinkle some chopped pecans over the top before baking.  I liked the extra crunch it gave and I think next time I will include them in the entire crumb mix.  And yes, it tastes like apple.  Wonderful!

Loved it! Made as listed using one recommendation to cook the zucchini in the juice the sugar and the spice right away. Turned out great everyone loved it not one person was able to tell that this was Zucchini. Hubby thought this was better than my traditional Apple Cobbler. Next time I will cut back on the sugar in the flour mix we thought it was a bit sweet but I will def. make this again.

Okay, I had read some of the great reviews and was looking forward to fooling everyone. It really looked like apple cobbler, smelled like apple cobbler, and if you covered it with ice cream and got mostly crust it was good. I was hoping for for something that tasted just like apple cobber but this had a weird aftertaste. My sister did think it was apple cobbler but she doesn't like cobblers. I thought it was good but not amazing. If you want something really good, try the zucchini chocolate  cake.

This was fantabulous!  I had been asking for zucchini from friends and relatives and got given 6 huge ones!  I made bread and butter pickles out of 2 of them, shredded and froze another, then found this recipe.  No one figured out it was anythin out of the ordinary for cobbler.  Since my zukes were large, I peeled, seeded, quartered longways and sliced thinly.  Looked like small granny smiths!!!!  The lemon juice is the key.  I added oats to my crust also since I love the crunch.   Will definitely make again and try using brown sugar for the filling.

Seriously could not even taste the zucchini... tastes like peach cobbler but looks like apple cobbler. Instead of using 1 1/2 cups butter, only used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup applesauce. Also, substituted 2 cups oats for 2 cups of flour.

I'd give it 5 stars, but I felt 2/3rds cup of lemon juice made it a little too tangy, could be depending on the ripeness of lemons.  I also made the filling and put it into a traditional pie crust vs the cobbler topping so I can't speak to the exact recipe, however I fed it to friends and they thought it was apple pie.  I used the big large zucchini from my yard, not bitter at all and the texture was great, didn't put in the seeds.  The quantity cooks down quite a bit, so you could probably even use more than 8 cups, that was 2 of the large zuch's for me.  Yum, would definitely make again with less lemon.

This just out of the oven and I was so curious to try it based on such variable reviews. It is really good!! I used large zucchini, peeling them and cutting out the seeds and spongy center part. My food processor did a great job slicing the zucchini nice and thin. It also worked well in preparing the topping/crust.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and baked the bottom crust for about 15 minutes before adding the filling. The only thing I didn't do was sprinkle with the additional cinnamon at the end. 
While I agree that the taste is not quite what you would expect with apples (unless you used very bland ones) and the texture is a little bit different, it still has an excellent flavor. I will make this again!!

This is the second time I've made this and again it was a hit! Doesn't taste like apple and it doesn't taste like zucchini. It taste great.i followed recipe and scooped out the seeds as others mentioned. I think those who found a bad taste maybe mixed up cucumber for zucchini or bought the zucchini from the store. Fresh right off the vine zucchini with the seeds scooped out taste almost like apple and no after taste.

Delicious! I took out the seeds of zucchini with a spoon just like you do with melon and sliced zukes really thin. No bitterness. I also used two packs of instant maple brown sugar oatmeal instead of 1 cup of flour. Next time I think I will add crushed pecans to give it a little crunch factor! Great way to use up zucchini if your sick of grilling it or making zucchini bread!

My 80 year old dad's garden is over run with zucchini and summer squash.  I made this recipe this past weekend.  I wanted it to look as much like apple cobbler as possible, so I sliced the zucchini as I would have apples.  It turned out great.  The crumb crust is crispy and light.  It was absolutely delicious.  --Will be making this again.  Thank you for this recipe and helping me to enjoy my dad's beautiful garden and appreciate all of his hard work...

Having used up most of my zucchini in muffins, breads, and cake, I used summer squash instead.  I cut the squash in half, removed the seeds, and nuked the halves in the microwave for 5 minutes.  Then I scooped the flesh out of the shells and chopped into 1/4" cubes, more or less.  Since the squash was pretty tender at this point, it cut way down on the stovetop cooking time.  I increased the lemon juice to one cup, used packed brown sugar instead of white in the squash mixture, & added 2 heaping teaspoons (instead of one) of cinnamon. I also threw in a couple handfuls of raisins. To the crumble mixture I added 3/4 cup of oatmeal and used 1 cup brown & 1 cup white sugar.  I added an additional teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping mixture before covering the squash.  Served hot with vanilla ice cream, my hubby said it was the best cobbler he'd ever had!

I am SO impressed by this recipe. It is the first time I used zucchini to impersonate anything...my mind is wildly attempting to find more ways to use this delicious filling (muffins? pie?). For one thing, my gargantuan free zucchini are far more economical than apples! About the recipe, though, I thought all the flavors and sweetness were right, and I am going to use the suggestions to thinly slice the zucchini next time. One word of caution, however: best not to announce the secret ingredient (thanks, my daughter =/ ) if serving to an uncertain crowd...I was SHOCKED that some people wouldn't eat it...

This cobbler is terrific!  It fools everyone.  I think you could saute/braise the zucchini in lemon like this and use it in almost any apple pie or bar-like recipe and it would turn out great.  I did peel it and scoop out the seeds as suggested, and cut it into apple-like wedges.  A few things to note:  The lemon juice dried/soaked up before the zucchini was soft enough so at that point I sprinkled a little more on and added just a tidge of butter to keep it cooking without browning or sticking. Oh, and I didn't use as much nutmeg as the recipe called for (just a pinch) plus I used all brown sugar in the filling, and reduced the sugar in the crust by 1/3 cup. 
UPDATE: 8/2012  I have continued to love this recipe, though rarely do it as "cobbler" but use it in a pie crust with a dutch apple crumb topping. My kids are older and the jig is up, but they actually like this pie as well as any apple pie we've ever had. 
I don't know why some reviewers say the zucchini is bitter, they must not have very good zucchini. I grow a golden variety in my garden and they get to be 16 inches long sometimes when my back is turned and the overgrown ones are the ones I use for this recipe. Nobody has ever complained that my pie tastes bitter or like zucchini.

I used part brown sugar as others suggested, and pumpkin pie spice as I'm out of nutmeg. I insisted my 14 yr. old try my new "Apple Crisp" -keep in mind, this is the pickiest eater on the face of the earth!- and she loved it! She actually gave me a hug and said, "Thank you for making me try something new. I will never doubt you again." (Til next time, right?) I will never reveal it's not apple! I think this is the first vegetable other than potato to pass her lips since she was five! Thank you so much for this recipe :)

i made a similar version of this using a very large, tough zucchini, which i deseeded. i cooked it with apple juice, some lemon juice and a much reduced amount of sugar. it was very well recieved. just a suggestion.

If you are looking for a recipe that uses zucchini to make the recipe healthier this one is definitely not for you... I think the philosophy of this recipe is if you add enough sugar and butter anything will taste good... my coworkers couldn't believe it was made with zucchini and not apples... very good recipe I took the other reviewers advice and removed the seeds from the zucchini.... it taste good both warm and cold... definitely not the best if you are on a diet but a great recipe if you have a garden full of zucchini and are craving apple crisp

I had a bunch of zucchini (the pale green variety) I needed to cook up and found this creative twist on a cobbler.  I was sure to peel them completely, to avoid any bitter taste, and cubed them small.  I also used the following as my crumble: 1/2 cup butter (softened), 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats, 1/2 cup crushed walnuts, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (mix together with fingers to chunky crumbs).  My biggest critics (my 4 kids) loved it and I didn't reveal the "secret ingredient" until it was completely gobbled up!  Using apples definitely tastes better, but this is a fun and different option to use up those extra zucchinis.

Delicious! Have made the original version with white pattypan and the family gobbled it up and asked for more. Have also played with recipe.... added oatmeal to crust, nuts, brown sugar, apples, etc. It's even good if you don't peel the squash. I'll use this again and again.

WOW!  This was amazing.  I had a zucchini that had gotten too big in the garden.  So I thought what the heck.  I peeled it and too out the seeds.  Maybe others who thought it was bitter didn't do this.  Even with this 'old' zucchini it takes like tart apples (the lemon juice I guess).  Not a hint of bitter.  Tip: cook the zucchini until the liquid just cooks off. Otherwise it may be too watery. 

When I added the 'crust' mixture to the zucchini it made this wonderful thick carmel like sauce.  I misread and added 1/2 of the remaining crust mixture rather than 1/2 cup of it.  I've made it several times since and always do it this way now.

Like other reviewers suggested, I added a little oatmeal to the topping.  I made a half batch the first time as I was skeptical.  But have now made it multiple times! A scoop of vanilla ice cream will top it off.  Fantastic!

The first time I made it was ok. The next time I made this recipe I made some changes. I add 1 teaspoon else to each spice (nutmeg and cinnamon) because the last one I made didn't have much those flavors and also it tasted much of zucchini. Make sure to cook well the zucchini other way you will find chunk of zucchini and that is not so good ;) I will make it again :)

Some Zucchini can be bitter, and is best thrown out. Nothing you can do will change the taste. Try again with a good one (sample a slice before you use it).

I totally fooled my husband.  He was sure he was eating apple cobbler.  This cobbler is both simple and tasty with just the cinnamon and nutmeg flavoring.  Peel, seed and chop the zucchini rather small and you'll have a great new use for those garden extras.

Very surprised at how yummy a zucchini desert could be!  I halved the recipe (and used only 1/3 of the butter and sugar) and changed the flour to whole wheat pastry flour. STILL delicious and even a bit too sweet for my taste.  I also had too much topping as some other reviewers said (hence the 4 stars not five).  I like the idea of adding nuts to the topping and may try that next time.

Very good.  I used a cinnamon/sugar mix on top instead of straight cinnamon.  Very good - no one knew it was zucchini and thought it was a mild apple.

This was very delicious.  After reading the comments and seeing that some people were dissappointed because it didin't tase enough like apple cobbler, I decided to alter the recipe and used 6 cups of zucchini and 2 cups of apple.   Yumm..

My father became allergic to apples at the age of 60.  He was THRILLED with this dessert as now he doesn't feel deprived of his "apple cobbler."  Everyone I have served this dessert likes it, not all are fooled into believing they are eating apple cobbler, but all have asked for the recipe.  Serve it warm, with ice cream, for the most compliments.

This was an awesome recipe!!  I took it to a potluck and didn't tell anyone what it was and when they thought it was apple and I corrected them no one believed me and they wanted to know how I did it.  I did the sliced zucchini like one of the reviews suggested and it worked out really well!!  I added some extra flour to the apples and had to use half lime juice because I ran out of lemon and I didn't notice a difference.

Absolutely delicious!!! It really does taste and look like apples. My mom cooked the zucchini with the cinnamon and nutmeg along with some of the sugar the whole time until tender then added the rest of the sugar and it turned out great. She also substituted the butter for margarine. Slice the zucchini thin (like thin apple slices) and cut out the seeds too. Couldn't believe it would be so yummy but it is unbelievably great!!!! You definitely will fool people into thinking its apples. Highly, HIGHLY recommend to everyone!

Those who said this was bad probably didnt make it right. I thought it was great for a veggy cobbler. the only thing Id like to change about this recipe is how much butter it called for. If anyone comes up with a low fat recipe for this, that would be awsome. Its worth giving this recipe a shot. Ty, I can see why everyone liked it.

Yum! I followed the other suggestions and removed all the seeds. This tasted just like apple cobbler.

Fooled a few people with this in the past. I don't always measure my ingredients perfectly and have had this come out as squares rather than in a cobbler form.  Just make sure you cut up the zucchini small and simmer well with the lemon juice until softened.

I needed to find some other recipes to use up the abundance of zucchini in my garden and WOW this is a wonderful recipe. Just remember to remove all seeds and slice very thin that gave me excellent results.

We added oatmeal to flour mixture as suggested by another reader, and doubled the cinnamon. This is an excellent recipe, tasted just like apple cobbler.  I'm making again and will add walnuts to the topping mixture.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was amazing.  There was no way I would have ever believed that zucchini would taste exactly like apples.  My husband thought I was kidding him when I told him these were not apples.  I did a few things differently.  I used brown sugar as suggested in other reviews and I cooked the zucchini in lemon juice and Spiced Rum..yummy.

This is absolutely amazing!  No one in my family could tell that it wasn't an apple dessert.  I didn't have a 15" pan, so I made it in a 9x13, and the crust was a little too thick.  Other than that, it was GREAT!

This was amazing!  My family wanted to know how it got it's flavor.  My husband said the crust was perfect and my son thought it was apples.

I followed the advice of others and sliced the zucchini thin so it had the texture of sliced apples.

The only things I did different was to process the flour sugar and butter mixture in my Cuisinart and added dollops of butter on top of the zucchini mixture before the topping was sprinkled on.  I also patted the top down.

My only complaint was that even thought the crust tasted great, there was too much of it in comparison to the zucchini.  The next time I will double the zucchini mixture.

Update:  Increasing the zucchini filling by another half is the best combination.

I made this last night and it was great.  The house spelled wonderful.  I made half a batch and used an 8 x 8 pan.  Couldn't tell the difference, you'd think it was apple.  Will make this again, lots of zukes to use!

Some reviews said this tasted like zucchini.  I couldn't convince my friends that it didn't have any apples in it.  I think that maybe the difference is that I used a REALLY big zucchini with a much milder taste.  I made it in a 9x13 just for convenience, other than that, it was all the same.  I wouldn't call this a healthy recipe, but a nice way to use 8 cups of zucchini!

I'm giving this 5 stars as it's really quite good and does not taste like zucchini at all.  I misread the recipe and shredded the zucchini without peeling it.  That gave it kind of a green color.  I don't recommend this.  And I wish there was a solution to the butter that would avoid that step and make it more healthy.  If anyone has any substitutions, I'd like to know about it.  But otherwise it is a great use of zucchini and is really tasty too.

This was great!  I was a little skeptical when trying the first bite, but it really does taste like apples.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the amount of butter.  I was two tablespoons short, but it did not effect the outcome.  Also, I did not have time to put this together and bake it on the same day.  I refrigerated the zucchini mixture until I was ready, and it still turned out quite well.  Finally, I used a very large zucchini from the garden (I didn't want it to go to waste), I removed the seeds and spongy portion...it worked just fine.

I was reluctant to make this for a potluck until I had used my family as guinea pigs first. I made a small batch with my usual "Crisp" topping and everyone, including my picky 9 year old were fooled! My husband was even confused as to why I was having him taste "my usual" apple crisp :)   The only changes I made were using the large "8 Ball" squash from my garden instead of long zucchini. If your filling is bitter that's a problem with your zucchini, not the recipe...I also cooked it longer with the sugar and spices and a little pat of butter. My topping is:1 1/4 c. oats, 1c. flour, 1/2 c. wheat germ, 1/3 c. nuts, 1 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c butter, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg & salt. I press half in the bottom of the pan and sprinkle the rest on top. Oh yeah! 8-9 c. fruit filling in the center! :)

I made this zucchini cobbler recipe for a family reunion, and everyone loved it!  I cut out the zucchini seeds as another reviewer noted, and it really did taste like a subtle apple cobbler.  I didn't have lemon juice, but I did have lime juice, and with this modification it still tasted great.

Fantastic! I actually made this for my brother in law because he is allergic to apples and he really didn't want to believe me that there were no apples in it! Everyone talked about it for days, and it was even requested at another get together! Great way to use garden zucchini  in a creative way!

This was pretty good. I halved and seeded it then made pretty thin slices. If you're using a very large squash, I'd quarter it. The only problem with this recipe, thus four stars, is that apple cobbler tastes like apples, not just cinnamon. So I "fixed" the recipe by adding a sugar-free apple drink mix to the zucchini while cooking it. I also swapped 3/4 of all of the sugar for splenda. It's still not the same, but it does have a lot less carbs and tastes pretty close with the apple flavoring. Oh, and I buy the wal-mart brand next to the Crystal lite, but you could use the apple cider mix that's with the cocoa mixes.

I love this! My friend and I have made this a ton in the last month! The key is to making sure the zucchini is very tender when you're cooking it in the lemon juice (about 10 minutes), put you don't want it mushy. If you do this right, it WILL turn out better than apple crisp :)

Don and Mary, how adorable that you submitted this recipe together. Let me say that the only reason I tried this was because I was so desperately trying to find things to do with a giant zuke a friend gave to me. I can't begin to tell you how incredibly impressed I was with this wonderful recipe. I purposely did not tell my family what it was. I'm thrilled to tell you that they all LOVED it and thought it was apple cobbler! Like others, I did add oats to the mix and didn't measure the cinnamon. This was fabulous and I thank you so much for sharing your delicious dessert with us!!

Now this was amazing!  I did 2 cups flour, 2 cups oats.  Other than that, I followed exactly.  I love zucchini, but am not disappointed to have it taste like apple cobbler!  I had a rather large zucchini in the garden that grew ahead of me, so I was happy to find something that would use it all up.  Thanks!

This was nothing like apple cobbler, it didn't taste good either. The topping was very glue like and not crumbly at all. I won't make this again.

It is because of recipes like this that I am reminded of why I LOVE this website so much!  This recipe is easy, orginal and most importantly tastes wonderful!  I peeled and deseeded the zucchini and let it soften for a good 30 minutes.  I also added some allspice.  What a great way to use zucchini.  Everyone in my family thought it was apples.  I might use a little less sugar next time but that is just personal prefrence.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Simply the best!  Tastes exactly like apple cobbler.  My husband will bring home Zucchini from the neighbors garden just for this recipe.  I use 10-12 cups of Zucchini to get a bit more filling!!!

Very easy to make and simply delicious, I followed the advice of some other reveiws and added quick oats in the crumbs.  I did cut down the sugar and butter a bit, tasted great.  Took this to a church dinner and wouldn't tell anyone what it was until they were done nobody believed me that it was zucchini, I was asked for the recipes by at least 6 people.  A definite keeper my husband loved it!!!!!!!

What a waste of good ingredients!  It is very bland and tastes like a sugar cookie with a little mushy zucchini.  Should have made the sugar cookies and just had grilled zucchini.  Even my 3 year old who loves both zucchini and ANYTHING with sugar left it.  It was a beautiful golden brown and I followed the recipe exactly.  Just tasted awful.

Seeded zucchini.  Used brown sugar, truvia, and sugar.  And replaced 1 cup flour with old-fashioned oats.  Baked crust 10 minutes before adding filling to keep from going soggy.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.  I was "sampling" the zucchini mixture a lot before it made it to the oven.  Very good if you like sugar!

I've made this or a similar recipe for years and everyone LOVES it!  I suspect that those people who say it was slightly bitter forgot to peel and/or seed the zucchini?   Over the years I have made some adjustments, like cooking the zucchini in lemon juice and a couple tbs of butter or margarine, I use twice the amount of cinnamon and a bit more nutmeg,  and use 1/2 a cup of white and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar in the filling.  I also sometimes cut up caramels and mix them into the topping, or add dulce la leche to the filling if I have it.  Yes, it puts the calorie count up a bit...........but it tastes so good nobody cares!  All in all, this is a good recipe, but a bit bland without my little "add ins".

Delicious! My kids and husband didn't know that it wasn't made with apples.  I used a different topping (my stand-by apple crumble topping) only because I prefer crumble to cobbler, but followed the recipe exactly for the zucchini filling.  I removed the seeds as another reviewer suggested, and the cooked slices really did look just like apples.  I will definitely make this again when I have a surplus of zucchini.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was highly skeptical but my family STILL does not know that this is made with zucchini.  It's absolutely delicious.  I hate zucchini but I loved this.  Of course, one could disguise just about anything edible using this recipe...  Cutting the seeds off is essential to completing the illusion of apples.  My husband said he liked the texture of the zucchini better than apples - said they held their shape and texture better.  He's the only one I let in on the secret so far.  The true test will be when my squash phobic daughter comes home tonight and eats a big dish of it.

Yummy! I had some zucchini from the garden and wanted to try something different. My whole family loved this. It's tart and sweet. I wanted to add oatmeal to the crumbs but didn't have any, and I used brown sugar instead of white.

Very good! Who knew!? Used one super large zuke for an 8x8 dish. Yes I scraped out the seeds and pulp. Only reason DH knew was because I had saved the peelings for our goat.

We had an overwhelming about of zucchini last summer and so we started trying different things.  This one was a hit.  It totally fooled my brother, who won't touch zucchini.  I still prefer apple cobbler, but this recipe has made its way around my small town, because almost everyone that tries it wants the recipe.

Used the recipe for the base of a great low-carb dessert plus veggies!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and soy flour for all-purpose flour to bring the carb count down and used my regular apple pie spice mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander and cloves, plus a little orange juice along with the lemon juice for cooking the zucchini.  Only had 4 zucchini, so I used 1 cup of soy flour, 1/4 cup Splenda and 2 tablespoons of butter and added just enough water (4-5 tablespoons) to mix it together.  Baked it and ate warm from the oven with sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe.  Satisfied my sweet tooth and helped my diet, as well.

Excellent!  I did as others said by using only brown sugar (and less of it), 1/2 oatmeal 1/2 flour, 1 cup of butter and only put the crumble on the top of two pie plates.

I was amazed. I made it for a family gathering along with a peach pie thinking that the cobbler would be a fill-in when the peach pie was gone, but I was mistaken. Everyone loved it and ate it as fast as the peach pie. No one guessed that it was not apple cobbler.

Amazing! Fooled everyone!  There was nothing zucchini-ish about this. Another plus to this recipe is that it used an entire GIANT zucchini perfectly.  I seeded the zucc and made 1/4 inch slices - not diced as the recipe says.  It even LOOKED like apple slices.

Excellent!!! Everyone loved it. Will make this recipe often. I did use real lemon juice and I did use 2 cups of mix in the filler.

Wow...can't believe it's not apple cobbler. That's what i hear every time i make this easy and wonderful dish. I did add pecans and walnuts in the crust and topping. It reheats just as good the second time around (if it lasts that long in your home).

Taste was ok but dry. Far too much topping mixture. Half the topping would of been plenty, even including what was mixed in with the zucchini.

Amazing!  Tastes just like chicken! I'm joking.  It is a great recipe.  Don't change a thing.  It uses up all the zucchini from the garden.  Really does taste like the best lemon/apple cobbler ever!!!

Need something to do with those overgrown zucchini?  That's why I first tried this recipe. It's fantastic. Tastes like apple cobbler. I know some picky eaters who snub their nose at squash, so I served it without telling them it was zucchini. They assumed it was apple. After they raved, I told them the truth. That was a couple of summers ago...they eat it every year now!

I thought this sounded like a very interesting way to do something with some extra zucchini rather than let it set around until someone tosses it. I made the filling as stated but then made an "apple pie" out of it. Everyone I served it to thought it was apple pie. Until I told them of course. I think you could serve just the filling in place of stewed apples too. THANKS.

Oh, this is so yummy!  And, bonus, my gluten-intolerant young kids (who HATE squash of any type) are sitting at the table right now ooohhhing and aaaahhing at how much they "adore" the "apple" cobbler (giggle giggle).  As far as the recipe itself, I gave it a 5 star rating despite making a few unintended but necessary changes to the recipe.  Yes, I too hate it when people say they love a recipe but only after having made lots of changes.  I'm only mentioning the changes as commentary not as recommendations to improve the recipe itself.  I substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Baking Flour for the flour.  I had to use yellow squash (instead of zucchini), lime juice (instead of lemon), and brown sugar (instead of white) because I didn't have the required ingredients on hand.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and baked the "crust" for 10 minutes before adding the topping/filling, etc.  As far as the squash went, I did remove the seeds first and slice it thinly in the food processor.  Looked just like apple slices.  Yum!!

I have made this three times in the last two weeks for family gatherings and each time, I have had to forward the recipe to savoring palates!!!  Even those who were not particularly fond of zucchini were fooled!!  This is a great way to use up those garden "torpedos" and much less expensive than apples!  As per reviews, I substituted 1 cup oats for flour and used half brown/half white sugar.  Yum Yum!

Goodness... Is this legal??? I did this on faith alone, not expecting much because it was, well, zucchini :-)  I trekked down to the garden and chose 2 fairly large zucchinis, and 2 medium size ones, & proceeded back into the kitchen.  Well, I simply could not believe the taste of the actual "crumble" mixture itself even before baking this! The finished product was fantastic.  It was eaten with complete zest (under the assumption that it was Apple Crumble).  They were enjoying it too much, I didn't have the heart to tell them it was zucchini until it was finished heh heh :-).  They were in complete and utter shock when they found out it was zucchini.  This is the absolute best way to get kids to eat zucchini.  It has a bit of a citrus zing, that may not be to some people's liking.  This could probably be remedied by adjusting the amount of lemon juice in the recipe.  I am NOT a fan of zucchini or Apple, and I have to admit that this was spectacular. I think fresh zucchini is the key, because it is still soft, so it sliced very easily, and once cooked; it absolutely looked like apple. No one in our household suspected otherwise.  If you're an apple lover, or have an acutely discerning taste bud, maybe you'll be able to tell the difference. I don't think the average person would if it's done properly. I followed the directions to a tee.  I wouldn't change anything. This is a definite keeper for our household! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I made this to take to a family reunion. My sister-in-law has the reputation of making the best peach cobbler around. One of the cousins commented to me that she heard the "apple cobbler" was better than the peach, not knowing I had made it. When she had a chance to taste my cobbler I asked her how she liked it. She said it is delicious! I then told her it was zucchini and not apple. Her jaw literally dropped and she gave me a blank stare. I told her I never tell anyone it is zucchini until after they taste it because people do not want to try it. She said I would have been one of those. It was quite a hit! I had to promise a lot of people that it truly was zucchini. Thanks to this website for another truly great zucchini recipe. My husband still prefers the Zucchini Pie II recipe from this site because he likes the crust, but for a crowd this one is great! I used 8 cups of zucchini I had frozen and had to add some more to it. I think then I boiled them after being frozen they shrunk more than if they had been fresh ones. Please make sure you take the seeds out. I usually use large zucchinis and quarter them length wise. The seeds are easy to remove this way and then when you slice up these pieces they actually look like slices of apple. You will not be disappointed!

Man, I wish I could rate this six stars. This was unbelievably cool and incredibly tasty. My husband brought in a double armful of giant zucchini today and I was hunting for something to use up a bunch. This one called for 8 cups, the most of any of the other recipes I looked at, and it sounded interesting. It was awesome. I used my three biggest zucchini, peeled them until no green was left, seeded them with a grapefruit spoon, quartered them and sliced them into crescents. I didn't cook the pieces long enough in the *fresh* lemon juice--I really didn't trust the 'cook til soft' thing. But trust the recipe, cook the zucs til they're soft. Now, having slightly firm zucs wasn't bad, it just made the difference between them and apples a little more apparent, because they don't chew quite the same when they're firmer. I was also dubious about the amount of crust, but the crust is excellent. My husband and his brother raved--my brother-in-law asked for some to take home/to work the next day. My toddlers asked for seconds. All I could say was WOW! This is the *best* way to use zucs when you're bored with zucs.  One recommendation: Use smaller zucchini--The smaller, finer texture of younger ones would be a better match for apples, I think. Unbelievably yummy. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!!!

I had so much fun fooling my kids and coworkers with this cobbler! I made it exactly as is, except used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar in the crust. And added 3/4 cup oatmeal as others suggested. 

People said it was the best "apple cobbler" they ever had and I would laugh and tell them there was no apple in it and you should have seen the looks on their faces!!!  This was a winner! Thanks, Don and Mary! 

Also, I had way too much crumble left over, so I put it in a ziplok bag in the refrigerator and just used it as a topping on blueberry muffins. YUM!!!

This was excellent!  I cut the zucchini into apple-pie-like chunks, used 1/2 flour and 1/2 oatmeal in the topping, and also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  It was great, even my husband, who is suspicious of everything I make these days having zucchini in it, thought it was great.  Especially good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This is definitely a keeper!

Very good! I read over all the reviews and was concerned about a "funky" after-taste, but did not have any.  Maybe the texture is odd for some--I didn't cook the zucchini until it was all tender and the texture was like old apples, but still apple-y.  I used the scaling tool for a 12-serving recipe.  It basically was half the original recipe.  I used 1 Tablespoon of concentrated apple juice in my lemon juice.  For the "crust" and topping I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 quick oatmeal and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I was afraid that it would be too much "crust" but actually it wasn't and I can imagine it would be super fantastic with ice cream!! Thank you Don and Mary.  I see that Allrecipes also has a recipe for zucchini cobbler, but haven't tried it yet.

I can't believe I served this to guests consisting of 4 adults in their early 20s, two of them male AND I know at least one of them that would not have touched this had he known it was zucchini. All the guys took seconds of this "apple" cobbler. It was great and I got rid of one of my large zucchinis.

Okay, time to rate this since I'm making it for the third time!  Absolutely wonderful.  My husband, who can tell you exactly what is in Everything asked, "So, how many apples did you use in this?"  None!  Can't believe I finally fooled him.  I seeded the big zucchini after the first time.  I liked that better.  Added recommended oats the first time and loved the addition.  Forgot them the second time.  This time round they're going back in the topping.  Topping halved first time, as stated second.  I loved the topping but would've liked more filling.  This time I'm going to double the zucchini filling!  Used a 11X17 pan.

Excellent use of zucchini - this tastes just like an apple pie!  If you cut the zucchini into slices shaped similar to apple slices for a pie, you could fool anybody!  I omitted the bottom crust, and the recipe still turned out great.

I was very skeptical but this recipe made a delicious dessert. It's as close to an apple taste as you could possibly get without using apples. I wouldn't go by zucchini to make this but during the summer when I have an abundance of them from the garden it will be a great recipe to have.

Right we live in country where apples are expensive but pipian- zucchini like squash is cheap.  Thought I would try this out and it was delicious.  I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice.  I think next time I would reduce it because it was a bit too tart.

There are so many reviews on this recipe, most likely few people will read this one, but WOW! I expected it to be good but it was unbelievable. I am an apple crisp die-hard but this might be even better. I was out of the room as my kids were eating it, and my four year old got up halfway through. I asked her if she was done and she said "No, I just had to come and tell you that you make the best apple pie. It is the greatest thing I have ever tasted".Pretty funny. She kept mentioning it all night. She does not yet know that it is zuke! I used garden zuke and took out the seeds and there was no aftertaste or bitterness at all. The crust tastes like a shortbread cookie. Next time I might try some brown sugar and oatmeal. 
Also, I have used a lot of online recipes and have never written a review but on this one I just could not resist gushing!

I discovered this years ago and have taken it to family reunions and potlucks at work, and those who say they don't like/eat zucchini will eat this and I smile as they come back for seconds.  My recipe says to slice the zucchini, instead of chopping and I think that more resembles an apple appearance. This is scrumptious!

So good!   I substituted half of the flour for oats and used gluten free flour instead.  Served it with ice cream. Tasted just like apple crisp!  Will make again for sure!

I loved this recipe, i thought it was delicious. I was showered with compliments and everyone was fooled that it wasn't apple cobbler. After reading lots of reviews i decided to reduce the amount of zucchini and did four cups instead of eight and i also decided to prebake the bottom layer of the cobbler to make sure it wasn't soggy. what a great way to get your vegetables in with delicious flavoring! i will definitely be making this again.

The only thing I changed was to decrease zucchini down to 6 cups, and add 2 cups of rhubarb. Fantastic!

What a great way to help get through the late summer zucchini monsoon!  You Must give it at least 3 bites:  First one, you taste the zucchinia a little and it's odd; so sweet but zucchini?  Second bite, kinda tasty... Third bite just runs straight into the rest and they're all great - in my humble, sweet-toothed opinion.  My husband (he who only grudgingly eats anything green) wasn't so easily seduced, so after I polished off the first pan, I threw a cup of frozen blueberries in the next and he surrendered to its obvious goodness.

Surprisingly close to the flavor of an apple cobbler. Great recipe if you're looking to do something unusual with zucchini.

Very good as is. I used a 9x13 pan and wanted to use up my zucchinis. So I had more filling. I also
did not peel the zucchini.  It turned great. I work with 8 men & one other woman. The guys just looked at me like... it's what? Once I made one of them try it - it barely lasted about an hour.

Wow, that's a lot of sugar!  I know that zucchini is not naturally sweet, but it's not THAT bad!

First, drain the zucchini: peel and chop into 1"-2" pieces.  Put the zucchini pieces in a colander in the sink and sprinkle salt onto it.  Let it sit for 20 minutes to 2 hours, then rinse off the salt.  When you do this, you are reducing the moisture content of the squash and pulling any bitterness out of it at the same time.

I added a whole cup of sugar to the zucchini mixture.  I only added 1.5 cups of sugar to the crust, but it's still massively too sweet.  I actually find it too sweet to enjoy much at any one time.

It really does taste very similar to apple cobbler.  Even my highly skeptical husband was impressed.

This calls for about twice the amount of flour it should. It produced thick, floury glop.  Still think the idea is good but I'll try a different cobbler recipe next time.  Sorry!

I have to admit I made this with a lot of hesitation ha ha.  But I had a huge zucchini that I needed to use.  I am so glad I did make this it is fabulous.  My 5 year old twins gobbled it up.  I did use brown sugar and did cut the quantity of sugar and it was still great.

AMAZING! This is the best dessert  it anytime recipe. I have huge zucchinis from my garden and I could not imagine a better way to eat them. I added some oatmeal and walnuts to the flour mixture which gave the cobbler a little more hardiness. I also took all of the seeds out of the zucchini. So delicious!

I love this recipe.  NO one thinks it is Zucchini!  Wonderful surprise and tastiest dessert ever.  There is ALOT of crumb, so you might want to add more zucchini, it seems to disappear a bit, after it cooks!  I also add a little more sugar!  That is ALL!

This was great! I made the cobbler first, then I used the filling reciepe to make a pie!  Everyone loved it. I now chop the zucchini and freeze it when the garden is bountiful with zucchini so I can make the cobbler during winter months.

This cobbler is surprisingly delicious. I was low on white sugar so i added 1 cup of brown sugar to the zucchini. It turned out great. My husband likes it better than apple cobbler. It has more texture.

I made this for my g/f and I. It is awesome good!!! She was very skeptical since zucchini to her is salted. It truly passes for apple cobbler, she says it's better than apple! Her grandmother (81y/o) tasted it and loved it also, she said she'd never had it either. Thanks so much for the new and fantastic dessert!

Outstanding!!!!  My husband was a skeptic until I forced him to try it.  He was blown away!!!!  It tastes exactly like apple cobbler. The key is definitely to peel, remove the seeds, and instead of chopping...slice thin!!! I took some other reviewers advice and added some oat meal, reduced the butter and added some applesauce, and I had some Sweet Apple Sprinkle from Pampered Chef that I added too. A permanent addition to my recipe books

I used my food processor to slice the zucchini which worked out very well.  Also, I used about half cup lime juice because I had no lemon.  In the zucchini mixture itself I used half cup white sugar and a little less than half cup of brown.  I only had 3 cups of flour so thats all I used which came out to be plenty.  Overall this was very good but still wayyyy too sweet.  Next time I will cut down more on the sugar.  Oh, I also left out the nutmeg since I dont like it.

This recipe is fantastic! I was skeptical when I was making this recipe, but it smelled absolutely delicious as it was baking. Had a hard time waiting for it to cool down before we tasted it. Yummy! You would never know that it is zucchini and not apples. Will be making again.

OMG- this was one of the best Cobblers I have ever had. I brought it to work & gave out the recipe several times. No one could believe it was Zucchini.

This was an awesome way to use up the zucchini I have been harvesting everyday.  I did'nt tell my husband it was zucchini till he ate two servings.  I can't wait to make it for everyone at work.  Thank you!

I read other reviews, so reduced the amount of topping I made for this -- I made half and actually only used half of that, as I put it only on the top.  It was terrific!  I took it to church potluck and didn't tell what was in it until after everyone started asking me what kind of apples I had used.  They liked the tartness and the slightly firmer texture of the slices.  I used yellow squash, peeled, seeds removed, and sliced thinly to look like apple pieces.  It was a hit!  Many requests for the recipe.

Crazy!! I was skeptical until the first bite. I had 5 huge zucchini sitting on the counter and was running out of ideas. This was delicous and we liked it better than the apple crisp I usually make. Can't wait to take some to a family function. Thanks a bunch for this recipe.

Did not fool my family into thinking it was apple cobbler.  But terrific.  Grew over 250 zucchini and needed recipes.  This one I have made several times.  Goes every time.

I, too, took the advice of other reviewers and substituted oats for half of the flour.  Hubby & younger son really liked the "apple cobbler"...then I told them what it really was, and they were surprised.  Hubby even told some friends about this and suggested I give them the recipe -- that doesn't happen often.

I have had this same recipe for years and it is a highly asked for dish during Zucchini season. I use about 10  cups of squash. I showed a young womans group how to make it. They made it for a scout Court of Honor. A scout told me later that He was not sure how it worked but it really tasted like apple.

This is really good.  My kids even liked it.  We had fun fooling people.  They thought it was apple cobbler.  I will make this again soon.  I de-seeded a large zucchini and added oatmeal to the topping. I also added more brown sugar as others suggested.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it!!

I'll be honest...I had my doubts that this would pass for apple cobbler. But it is AWESOME! My boyfriend, who hates cooked squash, tried it and thought it tasted just like apples.

Anybody that didn't like this recipe must have made it wrong!!!  It is wonderful.  I gave my grandmother a piece just after she was saying how she hates zucchini.  I let her tell me how good it was before I told her it wasn't apples!

Awesome recipe....my kids just LOVED it!!!  I do  think that there was too much batter and plan on modifying how much I make next time.  Cutting the zucchini like apples also helped.  Make sure you get all the zucchini softened though....if you get a bite with one that didn't get all the way softened, then it does give away the zucchini secret!

This was great. I don't make or eat apple cobbler often so I can't say if it tastes exactly like the real thing, but it is very close in my opinion. I cut the recipe in half but followed it exactly just scaled down. I think the key to this recipe is to cook zucchini until it is tender. It took more than the 15-20 minutes for my zucchini to be tender. I had to add a bit more lemon juice too. It was great plain but I also served with vanilla ice-cream. Now I have a new recipe for all the zucchini in my garden. Will definitely use again. THANKS!!!

I have to say, I was intrigued by this idea, and after going out into the garden yesterday I had to do something with those baseball bat zucchini that had sprung up overnight! This turned out amazing! LOVED it! My husband said, this is zucchini? I did add the 3/4 cup oatmeal to the topping as suggested by someone else. I also used my food processor to make my crust. I topped it with some New York Vanilla Ice cream! Yummo! Will definately be making this again and bringing into work to "fool" other non-veggies lovers. Thanks Don & Mary!

I cannot believe that a zucchini can taste that wonderful i love zucchini as a veg and in savoury dishes but i would never have thought to use one in a sweet dish like this i have made the zucchini brownies and they were great but this was something different to try and I am so glad i did because this cobbler is so excellent the taste is out of this world.Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

My family ate this zucchini cobbler and they thought it was apple cobbler. They were surprised it was zucchini.  I've made some for other people and everyone who tried it really liked it and wanted the recipe.  Delicious!!  A good way to use zucchini.

Wow! I've never really had an opinion on zucchini, but this dish is magic!
We, like so many others, had huge quantities of zukes, and you can only deal with so much bread!
This was amazing! Next time I make it, I'll try the oatmeal in the topping; we also gave it a couple of minutes under the broiler to zap the topping a bit.
A great recipe... thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe.  I tried this because I was so curious to see if the zucchini would actually taste like apple....and it truly did.  Everyone was fooled and asked for a copy of the recipe.  I did find the topping (4c. flour) made a bit too much for my liking. I ended up only putting about half the topping on.  Next time I may cut that portion of the recipe in half.

This recipe was great, the 5-star rating was not overstating the taste.  I did, as one rater suggested, add some rolled oats to the topping, and drizzled a little butter over all.
Absolutely nobody could guess this was zucchini, even when I revealed that the dish was zucchini, they kept saying - but it's mostly apple, right?

Excellent! I've made this a few times using this recipe and it turned out just fine BUT you MUST use the larger 10X15" pan or the crust/topping is too thick and doesn't bake well. 
I also sprinkled the top with a cinnamon/sugar combination instead of just cinnamon. Perfect! No one has EVER guessed that this is zucchini! It's amazing!

I used brown sugar instead of white for the sugar that went into the zucchini.  For the crust I used white sugar.  Also baked the crust about 10 minutes before putting zucchini over it.  It is perfect and I can even cut them into little bars.

The first time I made this I did not take the seeds out of the zucchini and I could taste them after they were cooked.  I also thought the recipe was way too sweet and called for too much sugar. 
I just made this again with seeding the zucchini and I cut the sugar in half and it was perfect!  Tastes just like apple cobbler. Yummy with some vanilla ice cream!

Outstanding! My garden is cranking out zucchini like crazy and I was looking for new recipes besides zucchini  bread or soup. It tastes just like apples to me. I think the trick is to skin the zucchini and cut into small (1/2 in.) cubes. Stir constantly while cooking in the lemon juice and let it get tender and absorb completely. I followed  the recipe exactly and it came out great.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't use 8 cups of zucchini because I didn't have that much.  I adjusted the lemon juice as well, I only used 1/2 a cup for 5 cups of zucchini and it was perfect.  My husband who is a picky eater was fooled by this.  He thought this was the best apple cobbler he had ever eaten and was shocked to learn that it was zucchini.  I removed the seeds and peeled the zucchini.  Doing that, I think, helps mimic and apple.

Everyone thought it was apple cobbler.I did it exactly as the recipe said.I will make this many times again.Best Zucchini recipe I ever had.I did peel the zucchini and used a spoon to scoop out all the seeds.Nest time I think I will add instant cinnamon oatmeal pack to the recipe.

So delicious!  Tastes just like I used apples.  Great warm with vanilla ice cream!  A family favorite!  My only change the second time I made it was to use 1/2 cup of lemon juice to make it a little less tart.  Try it .  I'm sure you'll like it!

Took it to a potluck and everyone who tried it loved it and had no idea it wasn't an apple cobbler.  Will definitely make again as my garden it going nuts with zucchini. I may even just make the "apple" filling to use in other things.

This  ended up being very good.  We had a Chopped contest at work where we had to make a dessert with zucchini, maple syrup &  apple cider.  I substituted cider for the lemon juice and  substituted one of the cups of sugar with 3/4 cups of maple syrup.  It tasted close to apples.  Side note:  To the reviewers who said it was bitter and to remove the seeds from the zucchini to remove the bitter taste, YOU ARE NOT USING ZUCCHINI, YOU ARE USING CUCUMBERS!!!  ZUCCHINI DOES NOT HAVE SEEDS, LEARN YOUR PRODUCE!!!

Most important is to remove the seeds.  The only thing I did differently is cook the zucchini a little longer and added a crispy topping.  It was so delicious, even my family loved it and most of them hate zucchini.

i made this recipe on a lark. i was sure people would know its not apples. i served seven very picky people . Two would never eat zucchini.  I was absolutely amazed. I knew it was zucchini and could not tell from taste that it wasn't apples! All the guests not only couldn't tell the difference but raved it was the best cobbler they ever had!

I picked this recipe as it had the most reviews & stars.  However, I did alter it slightly according to what I had in my pantry.  
    I was given a huge zucchini so, I peeled, seeded and thinly sliced it.  Resembling apples.  I followed the instructions to sautee with lemon juice.  Till just tender.  2 cups seemed to be an awful lot of sugar so I used 1 cup brown sugar.  Added 1 tblsp cinnamon, tsp nutmeg, pinch of salt and splash of bourbon vanilla.   It seemed thin so i added a bit of cornstarch to thicken.  Cooked until tender. Set the filling aside.  

    I didn't have much flour so I used about 2 cups quick oats, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 stick of butter.  Cinnamon and nutmeg.  I Combined till butter was pea sized & coated..  I pressed 1/2 the mixture onto the bottom of a 9x13 glass casserole dish.  Sprinkled the rest on top & bakes 350 degrees for about 40mins.

  It smelled delicious!  I served it up to my family & everyone thought it was apples!!  They were shocked it wasn't.  My anti-veggie son said, "This is an outrage!" as he ate another bowl!  All this recipe needed was a scoop of ice cream!

I really liked it, the crust is quite thick compared to the zucchini layer so I might even use 10 cups next time as they do cook down. My son has a dairy allergy so I had to make it with smart balance spread. It worked perfectly and was the right crispyness on top and chewyness on the bottom. I baked the bottom crust by its self for 10 minutes before adding the last two layers and baking the recommended time. pre baking the bottom crust kept it from getting soggy.

I have been making this for years. The only thing I do different is I add more cinnamon. I love it, my family loves it and my friends hate me when I tell them the cobbler was zucchini! Just put it down and say here is some cobbler....not my fault you thought it was apple.

This is great, hot,  warm or cold from the fridge.  I already had my zucchini sliced and ready to cook and realized I did not have any lemon juice.  I made a rather unconventional sub, but it seemed to work just fine.  I used a drink that one of the grandkids left...it was in a little foil bag that has a straw attached that you stick in a hole in the bag to drink it.  It was supposed to be 100% juice and was some citrus flavor.  I used the whole bag.  Tasted great to us!  Can't wait to make this with lemon juice.  Oh, I also threw some oatmeal in with the flour mixture.  Yummy.

I would recommend cutting back on the sugar. The flavor of the zucchini should not be completely hidden by the taste of sugar.

I probably wouldn't have tried this if I hadn't had a bumper crop of zucchini in the garden. It was fabulous. Definitely one of the best cobblers I've ever had. Squash or fruit. It looks, smells, and tastes exactly like apple.

Loved this recipe! My husband and daughters (ages 4 and 5) had no idea it was zucchini until after they had finished.  Taste exactly like apple.  A great way to use up extra zucs out of our garden ??

I made this recipe after reading MANY REVIEWS, because I was skeptical of using a zucchini as a dessert such as a cobbler. I know it works great for bread but was leery to use it in a dessert usually made with fruit. Glad I made this, it will be a staple dessert in my home. I took some of the tips posted by other reviews. I seeded an overly HUGE zucchini and quartered it making it look like Granny Smith apples that were chunked. It fell short to the 8 cups, so I adjusted the amount of lemon juice I used ( I got a measuring cup marked 2/3 and fill it about 3/4 of the way to the 2/3 line). The rest I did exactly as the recipe directed, only if sprinkled cinnamon sugar ( store pre mixed kind) over the top before baking, it turned out so very good!!!! I will make this over and over and over again. Love it.

Loved it.  My son was the only one who didn't want to eat it because it zucchini-and he's super picky.
Since we have. A lot of zucchini right now, I'm going to make several batches of filling for later, and freeze them.  YUM!

The first I made this for the kids and told them it was apple cobbler. After they ate it, I decided to come clean and told them it was zucchini. They didn't believe me! To this day they still think they're eating apple cobbler. Great recipe!!!

This was amazing.  I used the 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 flour and 1/2 quick oats as suggested by others.  I also peeled  and removed the seeds from the zucchini.  No one could tell that it was not an apple cobbler.  Took it to work and the same results, everyone wanted the recipe.  I will make this again!

The easiest and favorite zucchini receipe ever. I did not alter it at all. Did what the receipe called for except I forgot to spary my pan. Came out DELICIOUS. I've never been a fan of warm pie with ice cream, but this is so good warm with ice cream. Thank you Don for sharing this with us! Stay in the kitchen and keep them coming!

Phenomenal recipe!  Can't think of a better way to use the abundance of zucchini from our garden.  Taste EXACTLY like it was made with apples, in fact my father in law didn't believe me it was made with all zucchini.  Followed the recipe exactly, (I did remove the majority of the seeds) and it turned out perfectly.  Definitely going to add this to my top favorite recipe box! Thanks for creating this!

This was incredible!! The lemon gives it the tart of apples. With every bite I take, I cannot believe that it is zucchini. I can't wait for everyone to finish eating the batch I made so I can tell them what they ate! GENIUS recipe!

This cobbler is AWESOME.  I don't know what the people did wrong that said they didn't enjoy this because if you followed the directions exactly there is no way you didn't close your eyes and think heaven. Don't change a thing. Best zucchini recipe I have tried from this site so far and I have tried several. Excellent. Thank you

This cobbler is excellent. What a great way to get your veggies and also have the wonderful experience of having an apple cobbler. I made it but cut the butter to 1 cup and then left everything else the same. After adding the top flour mixture I added 1/2 cup of milk on top and mixed with the top flour  and gently worked it in only the top flour so it would not be dry on top. I then added cinnamon/sugar over the top. It baked up with a very nice top crust with a sweet crunchy top and then the caramelized faux apple interior was absolutely divine. We will definitely be using this a lot in the future. I am going to also try adding flavoring to the zucchini mixture or maybe 1 box of flavored jello before baking. Thank you again for this nice find.

This is awesome and it totally tastes like apples, but don't let the zucchini fool you, this is not a "healthy" dish, lol!  Tons of sugar and oil, but it is good, especially with some ice cream on top :)

Pretty good! My kids ate it up and didn't even know it was zucchini. I've made this twice and once I added one apple in with the zucchini, and we couldn't really tell the apple pieces from the zucchini ones. The seasonings hide the zucchini well. You should definitely peel the zucchini if you want to disguise it.

This was very delicious!  My garden is overflowing with zucchini right now and the family is sick of eating it.  This cobbler was a great alternative!  My kids couldn't believe it was zucchini not apples inside.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and removed the seeds.

I absolutely LOVED the zucchini filling.   I am not so much a cobbler "crust" lover, so next time I will make it like a fruit crisp with a cinnamon/oatmeal topping instead, but that is must my own liking.   The recipe is great!

I was looking for a recipe to use all of our zucchini from the garden and was thrilled to see one with 8 cups! This was wonderful and my kids loved it. I was worried the zucchini mixture was to runny but it turned out great. We couldn't believe we were eating zucchini and not apples.

I have had a recipe like this I got from my grandmother years ago.  It does not have the bottom crust & to help cut the super sweet taste, I added chopped walnuts to the topping. I took it to work & was gone in 15 minutes. Then I asked, " how did everyone like their vegetables for breakfast". They truly could not believe it was Zucchini.

I have made this cobbler 4 times and every time I LOVE it. I follow the recipe exactly, worried that I might not "mask" the zucchini enough if I cut back, and then every time its done I realize I should have either 1) cut back on the crumb topping, or 2) added much more zucchini (because they do cook down quite a bit when you are cooking them in the lemon juice). 
***For me, this a perfect way to use up the HUGE zucchinis I find too late under my zucchini plant. (the larger ones are more dry and have a less pronounced flavor). For example, I made this recipe yesterday using just ONE GIANT zucchini! You must peel and then seed/core the zucchini, then slice thin with a mandolin. Preparing the zucchini this way will make them very hard to distinguish from apples.*** 
Also, I like to add a cup of rolled oats for texture. And dont be afraid to overcook them like apples, they are better that way, particularly the larger ones need to be cooked longer to break down the tough texture.

We had a zucchini invasion in our garden and had to do something about it and I love trying new unheard of things! This recipe was great but being the non-baker that I am, it took me a little longer to get everything prepped up before it headed into the oven. As a general rule, I learned that 8 cups of zucchinis = 5-6 medium sized zucchinis. When I was cooking the zucchinis, I only had 1/2 cup of white sugar on hand, and I substituted the other 1/2 cup with brown sugar... no problems at all and if anything it may have helped mask the bitter taste others were talking about. Also, I'm not sure if others encountered this problem but the amount of flour in this recipe may have been too much. I may cut it down to 3 or 3 1/2 cups of flour because I eventually had some flour residue on top of my cobbler. Despite this though, what a fabulous recipe and a fantastic way to get ride of all the extra zucchinis popping up at the end of summer.

After reading all of the reviews, I did the obvious! I made the suggestions of cutting down the sugar, sliced zucchini like apples, cut the topping in half, baked crust for 10 minutes before adding filling, and added half oats to the topping. Wow! What a good recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This recipes is simply amazing. I may be a great cook, but rarely bake. But I had a HUGE crop of zucchini and my neighbors and family are hiding from me, so I was hunting for some new recipes. This recipe sounded intriguing..  I do think making sure the zuch's are tender is key and I used a bit more cinnamon. (I had some cinnamon/sugar mixed together for toast and just dumped that in, so I'd say a good tablespoon.) Everyone who tried ate it, refused to believe it wasn't apples. Even after I them, repeatedly.  It was great fun and amazingly delicious.

Everyone that tried this raved over it.  They could not believe I didn't use apples too.  The second time I made this I added raisins in with the zucchini mixture right as the zucchini was starting to get tender so that the raisins could plump.  Delicious!

Delicious.  My family didn't believe me when I told them there was not even one apple in it!  I had no problem with seeds but can see you could if you used an older zucchini with the larger seeds, so I would recommend taking the seeds out if this were the case.  Followed directions exactly and it was great.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I admit I was skeptical, but it was delicious and really did taste like apple cobbler -- my husband LOVED it and licked the plate clean.  Texture of the zuchs was not a problem -- cooked down into a sweet apple pie-like filling. Fantastic!

This is a great way to use an overgrown zucchini from your garden! Taking out the seeds and slicing the zucchini thin makes it look just like apples. I did reduce the cobbler part by half, and skipped the bottom crust to cut down on fat, but it still tasted great. We told everyone that was apple cobbler, and no doubted it! We had a good laugh after everone had finished and we told them the truth, and hey the kids have never eaten their vegetables so happily.

Very tasty but a little heavy on the crumb mixture. Could use more zucchini and instead of chopping,I would slice like apple slices.

Everyone enjoyed it and couldn't believe they were eating zucchini.  It's a great use for all those extra zucchini in the garden!

This one's a keeper!  I plan on making it again this weekend for a family cookout.  Can't wait to trick everyone!  I will try it with the oatmeal and brown sugar.

Delish!  I made this in a pie shell I had in the freezer using the cobbler topping.  I also used some oats, half whole wheat flour, and less butter.  I ate the whole pie.  I am going to make the cobbler tonite for coworkers tomorrow.

I was intrigued by the reviews, I had to try it. Just as everyone said, those that had some were amazed and surprised. The looks on their faces was priceless. Thanks!

Wonderful, very tasty. Hubby and I loved it. Next time I'll double the recipe. I did toast the bread as reccomended and microwaved the zucchini for about 5min.Will make again very soon.

This is WONDERFUL! If you peel the zucchini everyone will be fooled and think this is apple cobbler! I have had so much fun with this....people never guess they are eating a green vegetable! I even used a very large zucchini that was had out grown the size of what I would normally use (in fact it made the 8 cups by itself) and cut out the seeds in the middle so that all was left was the flesh and cut it is apple like slices. So don't throw away those monster zucchinis.....make an 'apple' cobbler!

I love this recipe. No one can believe that it's made from zucchini.  It tastes as good as apple cobbler to me.

This was amazing!  I really was sceptical about it tasting like apple, but my picky teenager just told me she loved it.  This will go fast.  It will be a great way to use up my zucchini.

OUTSTANDING!!!!Took to a camp out with 30+ people.  Everyone thought it was apple filling-the kids were floored when they realized they were eating zucchini.  Will definietly make again but will bake it a little longer.
