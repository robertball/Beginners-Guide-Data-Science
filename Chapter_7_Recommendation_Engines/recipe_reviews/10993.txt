I thought they were delicious! My students made these in class and did an excellent job. You should not use an electric mixer to make the dough. Use a bowl and a wooden spoon- mix by hand.

they tasted pretty good but they were a pain in the butt to make. the cookie dough was so thick it broke the mixer. i probably won't make them again.

I put the dough on plastic wrap and rolled into a log. After refrigerating for two hours they cut into circles easily. Didn't love the filling but will try it again with some changes.

I wasn't crazy about these cookies. I thought the cookie was too cakey and the middle needed to be moister.
