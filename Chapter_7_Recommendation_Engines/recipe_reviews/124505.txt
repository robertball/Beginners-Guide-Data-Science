This is a phenomenal recipe!  The only thing I changed was the topping.  Instead of using cornflakes I made a bread crumb topping.

This was the first time making this recipe.  I made it for a weekend trip we were taking with 3 other couples.  I elimated the almonds (one of our group couldn't have nuts) and added broccoli instead.  I doubled the recipe and to my surprise there was only about 1 cup leftover.  Everyone raved about this dish.  This will certainly be added to my recipe collection.

Very easy to make. I cooked the chicken, celery  and onions together.I also added garlic powder, season salt to give it more flavor. I didn't have cornflakes so I used crushed up plain potato chips and didn't add any butter, I figured the potato chips had enough grease in them already. Not very appetizing visually though, I think I will add broccoli or asparagus next time to give it some color. I do recommend eating this while it's warm/hot, the mayo flavor comes out too much when it cools off.

This was a great, easy, hearty casserole that was pretty easy to make. I would have added more celery. I also made sure to add plenty of poultry seasoning to the saute pan which added great flavor. Make sure to mix all of the ingredients before putting in the casserole dish, my ingredients were a little too separated.

Very good.  I made adjustments simply to accommodate and eat what i had in our cupboard. I didn't have celery so i sauteed onions but next time i think i will add the celery.  I didn't have corn flakes but used corn chex with the butter and i added a little Thyme to the mix.  My only complaint is that the rice on top didn't get cooked.  so i don't know if it's from lack of liquid or topping.  Even with the flaw it was DELISH!  Thank your mother;).

I sauteed the celery, onions, and a little carrot w/poultry seasoning first then followed as directed.  Liked the results, but as another reviewer mentioned a strong mayo taste comes across shortly after cooling and forget the leftovers...the mayo taste is strange. My husband (who eats everything!) wouldn't touch it.

I made this recipe for our bible study group. Everyone loved it! I was in a time crunch making it, so I pulled chicken off a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I ate the very small portion that was leftover the next day for lunch and it tasted even better than the first time. Will definitely be putting this recipe in the regular rotation.

Family loved this, although I made a few changes based on previous comments and what I had available. I sauted onion, some red pepper, garlic and carrots. Added 1 can of soup, 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream. Mixed it all together, and didn't use water chestnuts.  Will keep this recipe for leftover chicken.

Absolutley delicious! I recommend sauteeing the chicken, celery and onions together until the chicken gets a little browned. I didn't have any mayo, so I doubled the cream of celery. It was wonderful! Everyone in the family loved it and that is VERY rare! Thank you and your mother for this wonderful recipe!

I've reduced the mayo and used lower fat soups and the taste is still terrific.  Extra topping, always!

Great comfort food! I used about 1 cup of cornflakes instead of only a half a cup...it made it more crunchy!

We are not celery fans so we did without them. Just browned the chicken with a little oil and water added garlic/pepper and mixed all ingredients, my husband and I loved it. We will make this again.

Absolutely one of the best casseroles ever and so easy.  I put sweet potato chips on top for lack of cornflakes.  This will become a staple in our house.

Delicious, in my opinion, but my family didn't seem too impressed by it. I used brown rice, because that is the only kind of rice I buy. They may have liked the white rice better, as they are not into eating as healthy as they should.

This was just "ok".  It served the purpose of a hot meal for the family using leftover roasted chicken, but it was lacking in flavor and texture.  Possibly some Velveeta cheese to the mix would have helped.

Delicious casserole. My husband (who does not like chicken) said "this is good!" -- which is high praise. The only modification I made was I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken.  Additionally, for the cooked chicken I sauted chicken tenderloins in extra virgin olive oil with rosemary, thyme, and season-all salt and then chopped them up.  The rosemary and thyme gave a nice flavor to the casserole that complimented the celery and almond.  This is sure to be a regular at my house. Thanks to you Blanche and to your Mom!

I liked this recipe but the rest of my family just didn't care for it(but they are picky eaters!)..I'd probably half the recipe and make it as more of a side-dish(for myself) rather than have it as the main course..

This recipe really didn't do it for me.  I did everything exactly as the recipe said and it tasted like mayo.  We had to go to Olive Garden just to have anything that tasted good that night.  I won't make this one again.

Very good and creamy, but i did use miracle whip light instead on mayo, and added in about a tablespoon and a half of chili garlic sauce. I didnt really serve it as a casserole, i waited for it to cool a bit,, placed it in a sandwich with some pepper jack cheese. Great for a weekend lunch! side it with some bbq chips, yum

Excellent!! My wife says to make this a part of our monthly menu. Make it and you won't regret it. The only thing I did different was not to add the water chestnuts and almonds (didn't have on hand.) I will try those the next time though. Also I used Cherrios instead of corn flakes because that was all I had. It's a keeper.

My mother made this dish growing up and this one is just like it.  Wonderful on a cold night with bread.  The only difference I made was that I sauteed my onions along with my celery.  But a great recipe!

Excellent.  Followed recipe except I added some diced green pepper, red pepper or pimento, serrano, anaheim etc. Adds a little color. For topping I used Ritz crackers instead of corn flakes. Thanks for another great recipe.

I thought the recipe was a little bland, but generally good. It's definitely one of those yummy comfort food type recipes. Best of all, my son who is a picky, picky toddler loved it! I didn't use the celery, but it was still good! Making it again tonight!

This was very tasty. The only complaint was my one son who doesnt like celery but got past the looking at it and said he liked it. I only did a few things different. I cooked the onions , celery, and garlic with the chicken. Boiled the rice which I wound up with around 4 cups. I used all of it in the casserole. Due to others remarks about the mayo I decided to only use less than 1/2 cup. I used everything else in the recipe and it was delicous. Oh , I didn't have corn flakes so I subd with dried bread crumbs and sprinkled w/almonds and a dash of butter on top. yummy!

Loved the crunch; the flavor, not so much. Too bland for my taste.

The was by far the best chicken casserole I've ever tasted.  My husband said and I quote, "I think i've died and gone to heaven".  I had to change a couple things though because I didn't have the ingredients.  I didn't have celery, so I used a half a can of cream of celery soup.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I used the buttery round crackers and drizzled the butter on afterward.  Just for the record, my husband is a hard person to please with Chicken casserole because he says they all pretty much taste the same to him.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!!  We'll be doing this again and again.

We are not "casserole people" but really enjoy this recipe.  The recipe I use only uses 2/3 cup mayo and 1 cup of rice.  Also, I just add the celery raw for super crunch.  For the topping, I usedpanko with a little Italian Seasoning and garlic powder with the butter.  Used low fat/low sodium soup too.  Next time will add peas or broccoli to get more vegetables.

My family LOVED it.
I used cream of chicken with mushroom.
And I added more of that than the recipe calls for.
The only critique I have is the water chestnuts.
My family thought they were underdone potatoes.
Next time I will leave them out.
Or chop them a little finer.

Sounded good - but was only ok. I used Honey Bunched of Oats Almond which helped liven up the blandness.``

My 84 year old Mother loved this recipe, she had 2 servings!   Made it exactly as is excepting reduced calorie mayo.
