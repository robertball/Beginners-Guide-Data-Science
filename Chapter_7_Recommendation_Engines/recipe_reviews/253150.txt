This came out great. I only made half a recipe (because no one else likes this type of casserole in my house--crazy, I know!). So, it only took about 35 minutes to cook. I made one change, which was to use wheat bread instead of French bread. I liked that it wasn't too sweet, and the glaze was enough for me, so I didn't need to add any extra maple syrup. I couldn't tell any difference in using Lactaid instead of regular milk.

All four of my family members really enjoyed this for breakfast-supper tonight. The glaze on top was delicious. I had to cut down the bread slightly (I could not get it to all fit into the pan it called for) but otherwise it cooked up great. Definitely cook it until its done all the way through else you'll end up with an eggy taste (that was on my end for pulling it out too soon - impatient!) My husband said he'd love for me to prepare this again (although I may try it without the raisins) :) Thanks for the great recipe!

I've never tried making a breakfast casserole before, so this was a new experience for me! When I attempted the recipe, I made it a little too thick and if I were to attempt this again I would certainly use a smaller pan size and I would possibly cook it longer. But the flavors were all great! I reheated some this morning for breakfast before work in my toaster oven and sprinkled some sugar on it and that made it even better.

What I liked the most about it was that I couldn't even tell there wasn't any "real" milk in it! Lactaid was a great substitute here and made for a very good recipe. While it wasn't my favorite thing I've ever made, with some tweaks I think I'd gladly make it again.

I decided to follow the instructions in the Cook's Notes for the cranberry orange casserole. My husband and I really enjoyed this breakfast casserole. I loved that all flavors came through and didn't compete for attention. The orange and the cranberry  complemented each other very well. I'm already thinking of occasions to make this dish...holidays, breakfast pot lucks, teas, early morning church gatherings...the list is endless!

I made this for a family brunch. It turned out good. I should have cooked it longer. Most in my family liked it (some loved it) and I will make it again some day.

This recipe was fabulous - I did change it because I had a package of raisin danishes to use up, and I have some lactose intolerant people in my house! So I cut up the danishes, omitted the raisins because there were already some in the pastries, and used oat milk instead of dairy.  It was absolutely delicious and we will make it again! A great Christmas morning bake!

I made this with whole wheat cinnamon bread and it was the bomb...like a nutritional cinnamon roll for breakfast.   It was wonderful with sausage and fruit on the side.

I used brioche instead of french bread and it was very yummy, but a tad sweet for my taste.  My guests loved it, though, and what did't get eaten was happily taken home to husbands!  Easy to make, and a crowd pleaser!

This was so good! I can see this being a favorite in this house, it did not take long for it to disappear.

7.11.16  Love the convenience of breakfast casseroles, and this is a nice one.  Plenty moist and not overly sweet (as many are). The glaze was a nice finishing touch and provided just enough sweetness for us. Followed the recipe except for substituting dried cranberries for raisins and adding a bit more maple syrup and cinnamon to the glaze.
