I've made this for years, and it has always been a hit no matter the season.  I use 3/4 c. sugar instead of a whole cup and I also use 1 cup of pecans.  When I make it for my diabetic grandmother, I use nutra-sweet, low fat cream cheese, strawberries and pineapples with no sugar added, and low fat cool whip.

Great dessert dish. I did lower the amount of sugar and used fresh strawberries as I don't think one should freeze them, thaw and refreeze them again.  I put them in individual brioche cups (like cupcakes) and then when it was time to serve popped them on the plate about 20 minutes before time to eat them.  These were a very big hit! thanks for sharing!

I get many requests from family members for this delicious salad.  I make it for many of our get-togethers.  I have frozen it in cupcake liners and also in a flower shaped tube mold.  It is very pretty and yummy!!

I tried this recipe because of all the great reviews. I however found it to be too sweet for my liking. I think a whole cup of sugar added to 8oz. of cream cheese is just too much. I don't think I will ever make this again but if I did I would definately cut back on the sugar.

This is a great recipe.  I like to freeze it in individual plastic cups.  It is easy to just take out how many you need so you aren't thawing the whole thing.  I have also served this in the individual cups at a brunch and got rave reviews.

This is delicious!!!!  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and low fat cream cheese and it was still super.  Have served it at two different gatherings and everyone wants the recipe.  Thank-you Michele!!!!

I don't know what it is about this recipe but it just didn't knock my socks off!  My husband thought is was just okay.  I didn't like it frozen and it was too mushy not frozen.  Won't make it again.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at a wedding I catered last summer.  Helpful hint - freeze flat in zip-top bags.  This will thaw faster than a thick glob at the bottom of a bag.  Enjoy!

I have made this recipe MANY MANY times for holidays and parties over the past 1-2 years and I am making it again for a baby shower. Everyone ALWAYS raves about it and asks for the recipe.  My husband absolutely drools over this one.  One tip - DEFINITELY make sure the strawberries are completely thawed out, it will make things MUCH easier!

A hit with most everyone!  I followed the suggestion to cut the sugar to 3/4 and then used neufchatel (low-fat cream cheese)and frozen raspberries undrained. I accidentally purchased only 8 oz. whipped topping (lite).I don't know yet how the original recipe would taste, but it looks like this one lends itself well to modifications!

This recipe was pretty good!! It was great for company and pretty as well.  We did make a few changes to make it lower in carbs.  We used a mixture of whipped topping and whipped cream, used splenda for the sugar, pears for the canned and fresh fruit, and frozen raspberries which gave it a beautiful pink color.  The only frustration I had with it was the advanced planning needed to eat it since it really needed to thaw beforehand.  Other than that, it was a great dish!

Yummy. Although the name 'salad' is a bit misleading, cause it's more like a frozen
ice-cream dessert. But it's definitely delicious! And also - you can prepare it a day in
advance and have it ready when guests arrive. Very convenient.

I made this for two parties and it was a hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I think it would be good to change the recipe a little, take out banannas, add more pineapple, other berries, etc.  Combinations are endless!!  Great Job!!!

This is very good, I could taste the cream cheese.  I forgot to thaw the frozen fruit and it was hard as rocks.  The batch is much too big, however and i've had this stuff in my freezer quite a while.

Yes this was a good one. I got many compliments on this. Will make again sometime. Just be careful about the thawing after it has been in the freezer. It has a tendency to separate into liquid and cream. But has a totally fantastic taste.

This was very good. I cut the sugar and cream cheese in half, and used fat free whipped topping in order to cut calories and fat, and it was still very good. I will use this a lot. Thanks

This was really good, but it needs to be made in at least a 9X13 pan and it melts pretty quickly when you take it out of the freezer.  The good news is that this will re-freeze beautifully.

This was EXCELLENT!!  I didn't add the walnuts (and I'm not sure why...maybe I had some momentary brain lapse Thanksgiving Eve because I don't remember seeing walnuts in the recipe.  Bummer!!!).  But, anyway, YUMMMMMM!!!!  When my husband likes a fruit dish, it MUST be good.  We served it in little plastic martini glasses with our Thanksgiving dinner and it was pretty as well as delicious.  My kids absolutely LOVE it (my 4 year old daughter keeps asking for more of the "ice cream").  This one is SUCH a total keeper!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was very good, very easy and extremely refreshing! I made it the first time for company and they loved it. My husband did too and he doesn't eat desserts. I highly recommend it.

This recipe is wonderful. I am always looking for a dessert or entree that is different from the ordinary and this one is a real winner. I have made this twice in one week, the second one I have just placed in the freezer. Like another reviewer I put it in plastic cups so we could take out as much or as little as we want. If you are looking for something to take to a dinner party or serve at home that will have everyone raving, I recommend this one.

Oh my goodness!   This is SO good!   I've made it a few different ways now because I might not always have the ingredients on hand.  This is great!  Thanks for the recipe!  :-)

I have made this for years for holidays, and now my mom does too.  The strawberries can get very hard when frozen, so cut them small.  I often use cranberry-orange relish instead.

I've made this salad before, but I know it as "Banana Split Salad".  If you leave it out for only a half hour prior to serving, you can slice it like a cake.  Very good!

We made this recipe in my 8th grade home economics class 15 years ago and I have been searching for it forever! This is the BEST dessert! If I remember correctly, my teacher used cherries instead of strawberries. I think either would be equally as delicious.
