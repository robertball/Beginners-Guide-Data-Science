This is great! I made a graham cracker crust, and even though it was hard to spread the mixture in it, it still came out great after being frozen. I didn't add in the lemon juice, because after tasting the peanut butter mixture, I thought it was too good to add that in. Great!

Super easy to make, and fun to play with.  I did not follow the recipie exactly because I was going for a dense, very peanut buttery creation.  I skipped the lemon juice entirely and used only about 1/2-3/4 of a can of sweetened condensed milk.  I also used about 2-2.5 cups of extra crunchy peanut butter.  Finally, I started with a layer of hot fudge then alternated with the peanut butter.  Make sure the fudge is really hot when you spread it on the crust otherwise it makes a mess.  If you have the time and inclination, you may want to freeze the pb layer before putting on more fudge if you're concerned about making it look perfect.  A great recipie!

This pie is very light, fluffy, and creamy. Though I do suggest using creamy
Peanut Butter. This Pie is the perfect sweetness and oh soooo good! Everyone 
who tasted it loved it. This is a really good pie!! A keeper to my list!

This was pretty tasty, but really rich and sweet to where you could only eat a tiny sliver.  I would make this again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get the stuff to make this.

This pie is wonderful, I'm not crazy about crunchy peanut butter so I use creamy.  I don't add nuts or fudge because my hubby just loves the peanut butter.  I love it most because it's so easy too.

Such an easy pie to make and so tasty!
I used creamy peanut butter instead of chunky and I completely omitted the hot fudge as I don't care for it. I will definitely make this one again.

My son loves peanut butter and for his 14th birthday wanted to try this one.  Super easy to make. I used creamy peanut butter and juice from half a large lemon.  It added a great tang like a "sour milk" taste, it cut the sweetness a bit, too. I put the whole thing in a 13x9 inch pan. Will absolutely make this at the next potluck!
