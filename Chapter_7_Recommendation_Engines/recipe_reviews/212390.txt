I just made them and OMG they are sooo good.  Instead of waiting 30-45 min to rise. I placed in a 130 degree oven to let them rise, and then cooked them.  Glaze:  1 cup powder sugar, 1/2 milk and vanilla extract to taste.  Great Recipe.

So good and really easy!  This was my first time making doughnuts so I was actually shocked that they came out as well as they did.  I did everything exactly as stated in the recipe except the order of the dry ingredients.  I put the sugar and salt in before the flour because that's just how my other breadmaker's recipes have it.  It probably doesn't even make a difference.  Afterwards, I dipped the doughnuts in a glaze I found in a review of another recipe.  It's 1/4 cup milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 cups powdered sugar.  Yummmmm....
UPDATE-----I just made these for a second time and they were SOOO much better!  Make sure the wet ingredients (butter, milk, egg) are room temp or sligtly warmer.  I placed the egg and the milk (in a cup) in a big bowl of warm/hot water to speed things up. Also, I turned up the temp on the deep fryer.  It seemed the hotter, the better.  Last time the taste was very similar to funnel cakes you get at the fair.  This time they DEFINITELY tasted like doughnuts.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!

The first time I made these doughnuts I used plain flour as the recipe called for and put the ingredients in my bread maker in the order that the recipe said but my dough did not rise, so I started over.  The second time I used bread flour and put the salt in the flour because I used bread machine yeast and read on the lable not to let yeast come in contact with salt.  My dough did great the second time.  I also put it in my propane oven with a standing pilot so it would stay warm.  First time making doughnuts and they turned out great.  I used a doughnut glaze that I found on recipezaar.  My family loved these.  Next time I will try using a biscuit cutter and filling the center with jelly.  Good recipe

Follow your bread machines instructions!  DO NOT PUT THE YEAST ON TOP OF THE SALT!!! Salt and yeast do not like each other, the yeast will never rise....that being said I've made these twice.  The first time following the recipe and they came out tasting good but definately not all light and fluffy.  The second time I followed the order that the bread machine recommends, liquids first then dry ingrediants followed by a small well in the flour for yeast.  They came out super fluffy like at Dunkin Donuts.  Yum.

I had tried this as directed a few times. It wouldn't rise though they puffed up nicely when frying still my results weren't doughnut like. I recently saw another doughnut recipe that was very similar ingredient wise. Using advise from there and only a slight change in ingredients I got very good results. First melt the butter, combine it with milk, sugar, and egg make sure this mixture is warm but not to warm. Add this mixture to bread maker mix salt with flour add to maker. Put yeast on top. I ended up adding an extra 1/8-1/4 cup of flour while the dough was kneading as the dough was way to soft other wise. The other recipe was a refrigerator recipe so you may be able to yet away with the soft dough if refrigerating but the extra flour is a must if you are not. I just made a batch last night I doubled the recipe cooked a third of the dough right away and refrigerated the rest and cooked this morning. To refrigerate add a little oil to a glass bowl roll the dough in the oil to coat cover and refrigerate. Last nights doughnuts where good much better then previous efforts with this recipe. this mornings were great. With this mornings I took the extra step of letting an oven heat up a bit then adding a pan of hot water to help hold the temp and letting them rise in there. It may account for the difference in quality between last nights and this mornings.

Okay recipe but leaving the doughnuts in 350 degree oil for 3 minutes insures a burnt product. I found a minute and a half to be just about right.

Best donuts I've ever had, let alone made! I altered the recipe a tad- I wanted apple donuts, so I grated 1 med apple and added it to the wet ingredients. I also didn't worry about finding something to make the holes, I just stuck my finger through and spread the dough to make a hold, and it worked out fine with much less hassle!

I relied on other reviews for "tips" before making this recipe, and it turned out like doughnuts from my favorite doughnut shop - Great!  Others' tips that I used were (1) melt butter, combine it with warm milk, sugar & egg & make sure it is "warm" - Placed it in a cup in a bowl of hot tap water.  (2) Made glaze with 2 Cups powdered sugar + 1/4 cup milk + 1 tsp vanilla extract.  My bread machine takes 1-1/2 hour for the dough cycle, so total time was about 3 hours.  End of wooden spoon also works great for removing from oil and handling.

Is the dough supposed to rise?  I made this twice last night.  The first time I ended up with just a ball of dough sitting at the bottom of the breadmaker.  Took it out and rolled them into balls (I was making filled donuts) and they didn't rise, and looked a little greasy.  So I thought I did something wrong, trashed them and started over.  Same exact result.

These were easy to make but had no real taste, even after being sprinkled with powdered sugar.  So-so.

Very YUMMY!  Mine came out a little darker than expected but were still light and fluffy...based on the way they looked coming out of the oil, I thought they would be cakey but no way, they were delicous :)  Just added some glaze and they were good to go ( I was too scared to try the chocolate frosting yet) Thank you for sharing!! :)

Had the same problem with not rising, but made them anyway... even without the rise, they come out pretty good and taste about the same as a DD cake donut..will try again using warm water to active yeast and not milk... would still recommend these, they are good

Just made these this morning for our New Year's breakfast and they turned out beautifully.  Light and fluffy and perfect with cinnamon sugar.  We shared some but I think next time we'll keep them all for ourselves :)!  I did let them rise in a warm oven to speed things up a little.  Can't wait to try them again and I think we will try them with glaze next time.

This was genius! Soo easy and soo delicious. I had a lot of fun decorating them. The only thing I did differently was use lactose free milk and butter for my husband's milk allergy. Thanks sooo much for the recipe!

I don't even know how these turned out so wonderful. I'm terrible with yeast, but I have made these three times now. Every time was a success, and they were all gone in no time.

These were so good and easy to make.  I've never made doughnuts before and my son wanted them for his birthday breakfast.  I used 1 egg instead of half and it worked good.  Also, my frying time was maybe 1 min. per side.  These were definately light and not greasy.  I plan to make them again!

These were awesome! A keeper for years to come, my family loved them. I made several different varieties...sugar, cinnamon sugar, powdered, powdered cinnamon and honey glazed. The sugared ones won in our house but the rest were a close second. The only thing I would change is I will cut down the cooking time for a softer outside next time.

Great recipe! These were easy and delicious. My kids were seated at the counter waiting for another to come out of the fryer! I topped some with a simple glaze of powdered sugar, water and vanilla extract, some with cinnamon sugar and some with melted chocolate chips.

Whipped these up this morning...excellent recipe and very easy. They don't rise a lot after cutting, but will "rise" in the grease. For those of you who had doughnuts that were too dark, your grease was probably too hot.  Keep your grease at a low temp, flip the doughnuts when they rise to the top, let them brown, then they are done.We did put a glaze on them, but my 8-year old loved them plain as well. Will make again. Thanks!

LOVE this recipe! Super easy, and very tasty!  I liked that it was specific to the breadmaker, which saved me a lot of time and counterspace to make other things.  Typically in breadmakers, the ingredients go into the pan: Wet ingredients /Dry Ingredients (I usually mix mine together first, then place into the pan)/ Yeast on top.   We liked to top these with some storebought whipped frosting and sprinkles.  Took some of these to work the next day, and people SWORE they were Bakery! :)

My first attempt at doughnuts - baked or fried - and my second time to use our deep fryer in about a decade.  That being said, I thought the finished product was a little heavy, but this could have been part of me trying to rise the doughnuts in a slightly warm oven with a cup of water inside.  However, once the glaze was on, my crew took the doughnuts down quickly.  I did double the recipe since I did not see how many the recipe made (16) until a little late. To cut my holes, I used a tea kettle whistle. In my Presto Fry Daddy, three minutes would have burnt the doughnuts as another reviewer stated.  I found 30 seconds on each side was about right. I also fried the remaining holes, using my metal slotted spoons to keep the bundle under the oil most of the time for a more even finish.  I made a chocolate glaze using the chocolate frosting recipe on the side of the Hershey's Cocoa box, adding more milk for a glaze consistency.  I halved the recipe, but it could easily be quartered if you are making a single recipe.  Even with a double recipe of doughnuts, I still have glaze left over. For the "plain" doughnuts and holes, I made a basic glaze of 4 tbsps butter, ~3/4 cup powdered sugar, and ~2tbsps fat free milk.  My kids and husband enjoyed these, and the oldest child (5) thinks we should open a doughnut shop.  We made this as part of our homeschool curriculum after reading the doughnut story in Robert McCloskey's "Homer Price."

The doughnuts did not rise at all, the dough ball was just sitting in the bottom of the pan. I cut them and fried them up anyways, they were edible but really dense. I would not make this recipe again. I tried again (another recipe) and used a yeast mixture with warm water, as well as scalding the milk.

My kids loved it! The only difference I did was add one whole egg not half. I also did a glaze over the donuts. My family has almost ate all of them. Will definitely use this recipe again!

My go-to recipe for  glazed doughnuts.  My grandson says they are better than KK's!
I doubled the recipe, except added 6 TBL of butter instead of 8, also added a pinch of Nutmeg.

What a waste of time, please update this recipe. Salt should not go in with yeast:(    ignore the directions,  mix salt with flour or it will not likely rise. Mine did not, there goes my morning, will try again later,  bleh....

This recipe was not accurate.  It only made 8 bready, heavy donuts.  When I cut the dough into 16 pieces, they were too small to make even a donut hole.  I cut the dough into 8 pieces.  The recipe should have read to roll these pieces into a ball and then cover them.  They never doubled in size.  I made a new batch using a different recipe and they came out really well.  I would not use this recipe and I would not recommend anyone else using this recipe.

I use my bread machine a lot to mix and do the first rise on my bread, so making these donuts seemed a natural step, but I had a heck of a time with the recipe as it is written. Putting the yeast on top of the salt kills the yeast and I ended up with fried pucks. I had to switch some things around. I proofed the yeast in the bread machine bucket for 10 minutes with 1/2 cup of 110 degreeF water  and a tablespoon of sugar. I combined 3 tablespoons of dry milk, the remainder of the sugar, salt and the flour. Separately I whisked the egg with the softened (not melted) butter. Once the yeast finished proofing, I added the flour mixture, made a well in the top of the dry pile and added the egg/butter. Then I hit start. The yeast had a chance to proof so the dough would rise nicely. To make the recipe work, I had to rearrange the order of the ingredients like I make bread: water/yeast/sugar then dry ingredients then fat/wet ingredients.

I have made these 4 times now. They are wonderful! The first time I made them I followed the directions exactly but they didn't rise at all. I didn't think they would because of the salt and yeast touching.. But I didn't want to change anything without trying it first. Since that first time I have mixed the salt into the flour then followed everything else as written in the recipe and they have turned out wonderfully.

Really hit the spot! I melted the butter and added the wet ingredients first ( following my bread machine's instructions). Everyone loved them and the second batch is mixing now. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing! :)

I melted butter, added plenty of sugar and a little vanilla. After taking the donuts from the pan they got a good coating of this glazing. 
Recipe worked first time, great

I lost my famous bread maker donut recipe and this one was the closest one to what I remembered.  Substituted half the butter for extra milk. (Why have extra fat, right?) The dough was supple, pliable and was perfect with 1 tsp vanilla bean paste added. Very flavorful dough because of the extra salt and sugar. My company responded with "You should sell your donuts, Jen."

This was my first foray into sweet yeast dough and from what I read after the fact, sugar retards the growth of yeast. So next time, I will just add one tablespoon or so of sugar and maybe up the yeast a bit. As written they were very dense and I let them rise a couple of hours. Good flavor dough though, just a little technicality to fix.

this is easily the worst recipe I have ever found on this site. I made them exactly as the recipe said and the result was absolutely inedible.
