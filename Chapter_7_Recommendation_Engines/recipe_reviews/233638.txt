I feel like you have to make this a day ahead and let the lemon juice and pineapple enzymes do their work to soften and remove bitterness from the kale.  It's decent the first day, but amazing on the next!  So if you have time, MAKE AHEAD.  Cheap, tasty and sure to please lots of folks.  I sub some pepitas (roasted pumpkin seeds) for the sunflowers for variety.  Love this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! Massaging the kale really did cut down on the bitterness. The recipe itself is a nice change. I had a lot of kale to use up and needed something different to alleviate flavor fatigue. It held up well in the fridge so the leftovers were good as well. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is awesome!  By far the easiest and best tasting kale recipe I've found so far.  I can't stop eating it!
