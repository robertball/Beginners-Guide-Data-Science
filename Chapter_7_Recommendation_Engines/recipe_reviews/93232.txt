Made this about a month ago and am making it again for dinner tonight. Few changes I made were I browned the beef, then the onions and peppers and put it in the crockpot. Added the rest of the ingredients, used one large can of tomatoes instead of fresh, added a small can of chopped green chilies and just let it sit and cook all day.  It was fantastic. I did omit the water this time, b/c it wasn't necessary when I made it the last time. Also, the next day, I put the leftovers on the stove and addeda a can of black beans and it was a chunky meat chili. Served it both ways with cheese and sour cream. Big hit in my house and a great go to when I'm shuttling kids between baseball and dance this time of year!

This is "sorta" my recipe.  It was changed quite a bit after it was submitted.  Add some green bell pepper.. or if you're feeling lazy.. just add a can of Rotel (medium) to the meat as it's cooking along with the spices and extra onion.

I've rated this recipe before but changed one thing, which I believe, makes it really special.  Add a splash ( or two ) of red wine while simmering.  This deepens the flavor and complements the beef well.  This probably doesn't make it "authentic" but you won't be disappointed if you decide to try it.  Either way, this recipe is a keeper!

I used to live in a town named Del Rio, Texas, and there was a wonderful restaurant there called Don Marcelino's.  They served breakfast burritos with Guisado, beans and cheese.  This recipe is the closest to guisado I've ever found.  It was incredible, and my husband agreed!  The only thing missing was a can of Big Red soda on the side!  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll be making this a LOT!

I made this for my gang when they were all home for Christmas – and I was nervous.   Two tablespoons of cumin seemed like a lot when I read the recipe, smelled like a lot while it was cooking, and tasted like there was too much of it too.  I thought perhaps the taste of the good sirloin steak I used would be all but lost.  I plowed on, reheating it the next day, and hoped for the best.  To my surprise, the cumin had mellowed, and once everyone added their accoutrements of choice, it all seemed to blend and meld and complement perfectly.  None of us could get enough.  I prepared this using fresh tomatoes as well as the suggested Rotel, and green pepper as well as red.  I served this with toppers of sour cream, shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped ripe tomato, fresh guacamole, sour cream and chopped iceberg lettuce.  Side dishes were cilantro lime rice and Frijoles a la Charra.  There couldn’t have been a happier group (who happen to love Qdoba and Chipotle)

We are from West Texas and eat Mexican food regularly 6+ days a week. I LOVE carne guisada. It is how I judge any cook or restaurant. Unfortunately this is NOT carne guisada. This recipe makes up no gravy and has way too much tomato in it. This are the two main elements of carne guisada! While it has a nice flavor I will not be making it again; well, not under the pretenses of carne guisada.

This is THE one! I was so pleased with this recipe, that I became a member just to rate it! I followed the recipe, using stew beef (had it already) and tomato sauce equivalant of a small can and admit I hesitated at the amount of fresh and dried garlic. and also at what seemed to be a large amount of cumin( love it but it can be bitter if overused), you were RIGHT ON with it. the recipe I have been trying to get! I did find though that as it continued to cook on low it only got better, it was eaten at 2 hours simmer time. My mexican husband, and his mother thought it was the BEST. and the 14 year old (who is in a pizza fast food only phase ate it and then ate some more in a bowl sans tortilla about an hour later!) an oddity in our family we enjoy the taste of green pepper onion jalapeno and chopped tomato added shortly before serving wilting slightly, so that they retain some texture and great flavor. there is nothing better on a tortilla, Thank you, this one is now a staple for the chilly upcoming days!

If you are looking for excellent flavor without heat, this is the recipe for you.  I was delighted to find that, even tho I did not have all of the ingredients on hand, the recipe adapted beautifully to my substitutions.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes, and had no bell pepper.  I browned 2 lbs of beef stew meat instead of the sirloin, and simmered slowly for about 2 1/2 hours.  The result was heavenly, and palatable to even my 20 month old grandson.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I love beef and buy sirloin frequently on sale for cooking in allrecipes.com recipes.  This site helps me tremendously to make interesting meals on the fly.  And this was good stuff - and called for just the right amount of cumin!  Flavors are great together. If you're using a cheap cut of meat, cook it right or it'll be tough.  This recipe is also a great starter for green chilie stew.  I added chopped, boiled potatoe to stretch it, but it definitely took away from the flavor. Recommend making as is.  Wrapped it up in flour tortillas, served with shredded cheese and sour cream. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing recipe. This is identical to the Carne Guisada I ate in Mexico. I wouldn't change a thing with the recipe.

Delish! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. We served it in soft shell taco shells and topped with cheese, lettuce and sour cream. My husband loved it! He had the leftovers for lunch the next day and called me from work and complimented me on how good it tasted ...again! The only thing I would change is to not add the water, had to drain it before we ate it in the soft shells. I will definately be making this again according to my husband.

While I have no idea what guisada is supposed to taste like, I thought this was really good.  I used stewing beef instead of sirloin, a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh, green peppers instead of red and ordinary oregano instead of Mexican oregano.  I also added half a teaspoon of chili flakes to give it just a little bit of heat.  I browned everything off and put it in the slow cooker for 5 hours and it was great in tortillas.  Will definitely make again and again.

I'm from South Texas and this is a very good basic recipe for Carne Guisada, but any guisada worth having takes hours, not minutes to cook. It's a traditional mexican stew, so you have to STEW it. I usually cook mine for at least 3 hours, low and slow, no matter what cut of meat I use. This is also perfect for a crock pot and is a nice hearty meal to have waiting when you get home. I usually use a 3 pound roast cut into chunks, and a can of mild rotel on top of the fresh tomatoes AND water. Carne Guisada is supposed to have gravy so you want the liquid in there. Also, use masa instead of flour to thicken your gravy for a more traditional flavor. I also add a bunch of fresh cilantro.

Terrific flavor!  I have made this several times.  The only substitutions I make are one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes per pound of beef instead of fresh tomatoes and fresh cilantro instead of the dried Mexican oregano.  If you want more spice, use canned tomatoes with jalapeno peppers and a little cayenne.  I really like that you can shop for inexpensive lean beef (bottom round, etc) and make something fabulous tasting like this for a better price than a Mexican recipe using fatty hamburger!  Also, even though it is ready to eat after 30 minutes of cooking, it is even better after 2 hours.  Last time, I made a batch with 5 pounds of beef because of the ease of prep and great flavor.

This is really good. I found that I had to cook mine quite a bit longer for the meat to get 'tender.' I used canned crushed tomatoes instead of fresh (I have a tomato texture-hater in the house)and I did add green pepper as the author suggested. I'll make this again, but will probably use a cheaper cut of meat, as I ended up stewing anyway. Thanks for the recipe!

I was originally kdelash, and reviewed this recipe on September 4, 2007!  How fun to come back here and see all the reviews, and how many people have saved this recipe.  I have now made this for two years, and I occasionally "visit" this recipe to read new reviews and get ideas for changes people have made.  My daughter raved about this recipe, and it is now a regular menu item in her house.  I have recently moved (and forgotten my old AllRecipes credentials, hence the name change here!), and I plan to introduce this recipe to my sister's family.    I'm an old Air Force wife, and as I said in the previous review, I found this "guisado" at a restaurant in Del Rio, Texas, way back in 1983.  Ever since we moved away in 1986, I had dreamed of locating a recipe like this.  Thank heavens for the internet, and sites like this!    What a yummy meal!  If it wasn't so close to Thanksgiving, I'd make it right now.  I hope you enjoy this recipe.

Excellent aroma, great flavor, DS and DH want it from now on instead of beef fajitas!  I only changed three things:  first, tomatoes are not good right now, so I used two cans of chopped Original Rotel (medium), well drained; I used smoked paprika instead of plain; and I didn't add any water.  Do not cover the dish after all the ingredients are added.  After 30 minutes on medium heat, I continued stirring at least another 10 minutes so most of the liquid would cook away.  I served this in flour tortillas, with lettuce and sour cream as a garnish.  The sour cream was a perfect complement to the spicy beef.  If you want a little less heat, use the mild Rotel, or plain chopped tomatoes.  Excellent!  Will make again!

I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time!  The beef was tender and flavorful!  It is flexible as well - for use in tacos, enchiladas and burritos!  I didn't quite have all the ingredients on hand - like fresh tomatoes - so I used stewed tomatoes instead.  I also thought the recipe needed more liquid so I added extra water to it and I covered it with a lid and let it simmer until all the other stuff I was making was ready.  Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe!
(P.S. it goes great with the Mexican Rice II recipe on this site)

My husband loved this! I used canned tomatoes and regular oregano. I also used stew beef but ended up cooking it much longer trying to get it more tender.  I think if I had used the sirloin, it would have been tenderer.  So next time I will use the right kind of beef. I served it in flour tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, grated cheese, sour cream, and salsa (Frank's Hot Sauce for my husband).

Omg, this was fabulous! I followed the directions exactly and even used the toppings suggested. My meat was probably closer to 1.5 lbs by the time I was done trimming, but it didn't seem to be a problem. I was still chopping after I added the first vegetables and probably added the garlic, water, the seasonings, and half the tomatoes when about 15 minutes of cook time was left. I am not sure what Mexican oregano is, but I just used regular. This recipe seems to be pretty forgiving. I used corn tortillas and put the homemade guacamole on top, along with a tsp. of lite sour cream, and a sprinkling of grated hard Spanish cheese. Yum!

Awesome! Tasted like it had been slow-cooked all day! I ended up using canned tomatoes cuz I used my fresh tomatoes during the week--I should've known to not add the water, so I'd skip that next time... Served on tortillas with queso fresco cheese, avocado, sour cream, beans, lettuce. This would be great for a casual, build-your-own dinner with friends or family. **Also, I had leftover sirloin from some satay skewers I made... I really liked how thinly sliced it was--I'd do that again next time too vs. cubes. Plus it cooks more quickly.

This was just ok in our house, nothing outstanding. I did add a green pepper as suggested, used beef stew meat and added 2 jalapenos.

Mmm Yummy. Made t his for dinner tonight and the family enjoyed it. First time we've had this. I added green bell pepper along with the red and used a can of Rotel instead of chopping tomatoes. I was being lazy. Left out the water and simmered this on the stove for 2 1/2 hours. Meat was tender and flavorful. Served with tortillas and rice. Thanks for the recipe!

I use any meat that is on sale and i substitute 1tb chili powder for 1tb cumin. i also add tomato sauce instead of water and add a can of black beans, and roll them into burritos. this tastes better the next day. i cant get mexican oregano here, so i  use oregano. And sriracha hot sauce. is great for a get-together when you you can add cheese, guacamoli, sour cream or hot sauce and roll them as people want them. Awesome recipe. I learned the name of this recipe from a resturaunt i love close by. there version is good, but this is much better. its very easy to change to your taste. Tyvm rhonda35 i love it.

This is really good.  I am constantly in search of a recipe as good as my grandma's.  It isn't quite as delicious as hers was but then again she has been dead 10 yrs. and had alzheimers before that so my memory could be fading! Probably been at least 15 yrs.  That said, this was very good and easy. I used round steak because that is what I had. Only other change I made was I omitted the water. I figured if it needed it, I would add it later. Never was necessary. I would highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

We fix it much like this in Corpus Christi, 185 miles from the Mexican border, although I personally like to do it California style, adding chunks of carrot and potato.  For one thing, it extends the servings -- important during a recession.  I also think it tastes better that way.  The authenticity of the recipe is guaranteed by listing as an ingredient "Mexican" oregano.  Believe it or not, it is quite different from European oregano: stronger, with more bite.  I always shop for it when I am in Mexico, e.g. at a Soriana.  Almost any carne guisada is good, but this one is excellent.

This was very tasty, both as a stew over rice the first serving, and as leftovers spooned into tortillas as a quick burrito. We we definitely add this to our regular lineup.

Absolutely the best carne guisada I have ever eaten. I live in London and have to make all my Mexican food at home. I'm so glad to have found this recipe from back home here in this forum! Mmmmmm delicious!

I didn't need the water since I used canned tomatoes.  I also didn't cook it as long as it stated because my family does not like well done beef.  This was SO good as taco filler!

This is 5 stars but needs more spice.  I added some and it was great.  Thanks!  I may try one less tomato next time and throw in some spicey Rotel.  Really good, though!  Thanks.  As other reviewers said...no water needed.  It seems like you'll need some early but it doesn't take long to have enough liquid.

Yum!  This is Tex Mex at its best!  If you like fajitas you will LOVE this dish.  The flavors are great.  I did take the recommended short cut and used canned diced tomatoes and green chilies.  It still tasted awesome.  Also, I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers just to make it more colorful.  I served it with sour cream, cheese, and pico de gallo.  The spices are just right.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This was good. It is very similar to the other carne guisada that I made, but this has more of the extra stuff that I would throw in it anyways, so I think I will move the other one out and keep this one. I did have to add some corn starch to thicken it up. I could have just taken the lid off and let the moisture evaporate off, but I wasnt sure how much time I had left. I added cilantro and used reg. oregano.

This was absolutely delicious! The meat came out very flavorful. The dish was fast to make and was a huge help on a night I hadn't any idea what to make. I put it with rice cooked in Sazon con achiote and homemade refried black beans. Delicioso!

Great recipe, added a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis instead of the 4 tomatoes and red bell pepper. Also omitted the 1/3 cup water and simmered in a crock pot for a few hours. Amazing!

I made this tonight for my wife and her sisters family.  Everyone loved it.  After dinner everyone ate popsicles and I asked if I could have their sticks so that I could make myself a guisada popsicle.  It was that good that I wanted to eat more for dessert.  This will be a regular go to when we get that craving for Mexican.

I increased the paprika to 1 Tbsp, cut the powdered garlic to 2 tsp, added one yellow bell pepper, and DID use flour to thicken at the end.  I also added a handful of fresh cilantro at the end.  Served over rice with cheese, sour cream, and cayenne.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, which I think is the duty of any reviewer.  While I love cumin, this recipe has far too much of it.  With each bite, my first thought was "cumin."  Also, as a Texas boy, I find this recipe lacking in heat.  After eating my first guisada-filled taco, I added powdered jalapeno to the remainder.  The ratio of tomatoes to everything else is way too high; I would cut the number in half.  Finally, this recipe makes a huge amount of guisada.  I recommend cutting it in half.  Overall, it is quite tasty, if overpowered by cumin.

Scrumptious! First of all, I made this in the crockpot. I used beef stew meat which I didnt brown in the oil,  a 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes and subbed the water for beef stock. Served with tortillas, shredded cheedar and sour cream. The meat was so tender. Will definately make again!

My aunt is a wonderful cook, and has been making this for years. When she makes it, she simmers it in an iron skillet then puts skillet and all in the oven for 30 min or until the meat is  really tender and serves it with home made pinto beans. It is a family favorite.

Tastes just like home! 

I'm a Texan in London and was missing fine Mexican cuisine. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. 

I did do a few things differently though. Believe it or not you can find Ro-Tel tomatoes in England at a few specialty stores. Instead of the vegetables I added two cans of Ro-tel. Skipped out on the cumin and added a generous helping of chili powder. Yum!

One of our favorite Mexican restaurants in Denver serves this and this recipe is somewhat similar to what I was looking for, but very lacking in flavor if made as posted. To start with the one I get in Denver has sliced onions, and red peppers, not chopped, which is better for scooping onto a tortilla or eating with a fork. It also has sliced jalapenos for some heat. I used petite diced canned tomatoes, drained, and a cup of beef broth, some ancho chili powder, and cut the cumin way back. It only needs about 1 tsp. in my opinion. Thicken it slightly with a couple teaspoons of cornstarch in a little water to make a light gravy.

This is an awesome base recipe, with many options of substituting or tweaking to your liking. I used very lean, fresh venison instead of sirloin, olive oil, green peppers, and a spice mix by Bolner's (Fiesta brand) called Extra Fancy Carne Guisada Seasoning. I didn't use fresh garlic because I didn't have any. I cooked it all in a cast iron Dutch oven on the stove top, but simmered for about 2 1/2 hours to make the venison more tender. The finished dish was awesome on top of Mexican rice, with homemade flour tortillas, and frijoles a la charra on the side. A Classic Coke in a glass bottle from Mexico made this meal almost emotional for me! It took me back to my abuelitas kitchen table back in the '80's. :) Delicious recipe!!!

My BF was brining over homemade flour tortillas so I wanted to make something that would go great with them!  And this recipe was pretty darn good.

I am also from West Texas. Born and raised. I now live in The Rio Grande Valley. 15 minutes from the border of Mexico. Let me just say, unless everything in Odessa has changed, West Texas doesn't know Mexican food. This recipe is great and resembles a lot of restaurants in the Valley.  The food here is amazing. Never heard of half the things you can eat here. Try the recipe, you'll love it :)

This is the REAL DEAL!!  Thank you for this recipe! My husband is a Texan and he gives this 2 thumbs up!! :)  The only things I added was a bit of Adobo and put some fresh jalapenos split in the middle and placed in the center of the pan.

My family and I did not like the flavor of this recipe.  It was kind of bland for what we are used to.  I may try it again with some customization.

Very good recipe. We enjoyed all the fresh veg in meal. Our family eats a lot of Mexican food, so we are used to more spices in food than most. Next time i will add more seasonings. I did the way the recipe called for. It was a bit plain to us.

Great base recipe.. (ditto on the Big Red Soda!)  I halved the cumin, doubled up on everything else.. Used beef broth rather than water. I added some chili seasoning and a Goya sazon packet. Served with homemade tortillas, cheese, cilantro, green onion, fresh salsa, sour cream.. side of rice as well.. YUM!

I have made this twice with great results.  I followed the recipe the first time almost to the letter. This time I did it for convenience frozen pepper mix fewer tomatoes with canned sauce a packet of Goya sazon and diced potato. Still a keeper.  Next time I will add some heat- jalepeno.  Thanks for the recipe

Real easy to make and taste great!  I used green bell peppers as it adds a pepper taste (the red bell adds a sweet taste).  It's your call though.  You should simmer this (like a braise) for at least 1 1/2 hour.  The meat will be SO tender, you will beg for more.

I really liked the flavor of the meat.  There is not much heat, but when you are eating it with a guacamole that is authentic, a salsa with heat, and Best Black Beans from this site, you cannot go wrong and will want to eat the whole pot.  Of course, you must serve this with authentic corn tortillas and not the ones from the grocery store......It is an absolute party in your mouth!!!  This is going into the regular rotation for the south Texas fare.

Loved this.  I also used canned tomatoes and a green bell pepper as that's what I had on hand.  Also added a chopped jalapeno, as we like the heat.  HOWEVER, I used left over grilled steak for the beef and since I'd used a bit of mesquite when I grilled the steak, the meat had this smoky flavor that was WONDERFUL in this dish.  thank you.

This was a nice change from the ordinary!We never do anything different with our steak, just season and broil. I recall my mom making fajitas when I was a girl, but she used a package mix that just won't cut it in our home. This was better than the fajitas from when I was a girl. I would recommend one change, next time we will cut the cumin down by 1/2( it really over powered). Other than that this was yummy, and filling :) We added extra sharp cheese and some lettuce to the finished guisada, and this added more bulk. I made some white rice with beef broth, used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth to 1 cup of rice. A nice subtle side dish to the meal.

I loved this recipe!  I had been vigorously searching the web for an authentic carne guisada recipe.  I had not had any since growing up at my best friends house who is Mexican.  Turned out great, I did add two jalapenos chopped up because I love it spicy...I will prob even go for 3-4 next time.  Instructions were very helpful, especially about adding extra flour to thicken the gravy.  Thanks!

Wow this was great! I used canned tomatoes with green chilis instead of fresh and added some jalapenos but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it turned out to be delicious. Definitely a recipe I will cook again!

This was great!  I only made a couple of changes for my kidney stone free diet.  Beef is high in purines so I added a stalk of celery chopped, 3 T lemon juice and reduced water to 1/4 c.  Also added corn starch to thicken sauce.  I have a sour cream mixture that was great with it.  It is 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c real mayo, and 2 - 3 T taco seasoning.

This was a great foundation for my Carne Guisada..I was raised with all the women cooking w/o measurements..so i didn't measure anything!..I used chunky salsa instead of canned tomatoes and diced up my own..I DID use the recipe and added  comino, salt, pepper, and the chopped garlic..for a kick of flavor i used Sazon Goya seasoning..and simmered it for 30 minutes..it came out great!

This was the BEST.  Made it for a discriminating family, it turned out excellent.  I pretty much went by the recipe for the most part but added some mexican spices for a little saltier taste.  Will surely make again.

My husband and I really liked this, and we've had our share of carne guisada. My only changes were to use beef stew meat and a green pepper instead of red. Oh, and I didn't have fresh garlic, so omitted. After simmering for about an hour, it wasn't as tender as we like it, so I put it in the slow cooker overnight on low, with about a 3/4 c. of water.

I scaled this to 4 servings and made as directed, except that I made this in my InstantPot® rather than on the stove. I browned the meat on the saute function, added the rest of the ingredients and then cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes. When I released the pressure and opened the pressure cooker, there was quite a bit of liquid, so I switch it to "slow cook" mode to evaporate off some of the liquid. This worked well, but in hindsight, I'd skip the water completely if doing this in the IP. The flavors in this are amazing, and we really enjoyed this, served exactly as the submitter suggested (on corn tortillas with sour cream, cheese and guac). Thanks for the recipe! I'll be making this one again!

We're from San Antonio Texas and absolutely adore Carne Guisada. This isn't like any carne guisada I've ever tasted and I was very disappointed. I checked the recipe over many time to see if it was a mistake on my part. Certainly not. The recipe is very tomato-y and has no "gravy" flavor that I'm so familiar with in carne guisada. I think I'll ask my mother for her recipe next time.

Had canned crushed tomatoes in place of fresh and used flour to thicken sauce.  Came out great!

I have always made the recipe as written. 

First time changing this recipe up, and I am so happy I did !! I wanted the meat to be fall apart tender so naturally cooking it low and slow was the answer. I cut up a “mock tenderloin roast”. Chuck roast the butcher has trimmed/cut into a tenderloin look alike.  Salt and peppered the meat let it rest an hour. Browned the meat cubes in batches. Threw those in the crock pot. In same pot cooked onion and garlic. Deglazed the pot with 2 splashes of red wine. Added all ingredients to crockpot. Subbed beef broth and added a can of green chilies. Cooked for 8 hours on low. There is no going back after you’ve tasted this version!!!!!

This was really good. I have no idea what the authentic dish tastes like but we all enjoyed this.  The only changes I made were to use a can of stewed tomatoes, I added a bit of jalapeño cuz hubby likes the heat and I added the juice of 1 lime.  I don't think the lime is typically in this dish, but it really brought all the flavors together.  Yummy!  I added a little extra water as I simmered it for about 2 hours until the beef was very tender.  Served over rice the first day and had the leftovers in warmed tortillas.  Some fresh cilantro on top would have been good too, but I didn't have any.  Definitely saving this recipe to make again.

I used green bell peppers and added tomatos when it was almost done. I did thicken my gravy and put chili powder in mine and didn't really measure my spices lol. My husbands asks for it regularly. The leftovers got mixed with rice the next night and we put it on tortillas ??

It's a good recipe.  I used pork instead of beef and I put a couple of tablespoons of flour to make the gravy really thick.    Cooked it for three hours.  I think I used more water than the recipe calls for because I like a lot of gravy.  Oh, I also used ground cumin AND the seeds.    It's perfect.  It tastes a lot  like Joe's Bakery in Austin(they make theirs with pork too).  YUM.

Was worried about amount of garlic and cumin but came out petfect!  As far as changes to original recipe I didn't use bell peppers or onions.  I did add 1 tsp onion powder for flavor. And instead of fresh tomatoes I used one can petite diced tomatoes and then 1 can of water. Stewed on low simmer for 2 1/2 hrs then added a little corn starch to thicken gravy. Tender and delicious!

Very nice flavor profile. I could go for a little more heat, but that's an easy change to make. Also, the meat should probably be seasoned while it's browning. I served mine atop a corn tortilla with avocado on the side and garnished with cilantro. Some fresh jalapenos would make a nice topping as well. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

The only recommendation I would add is to let the meat simmer for at least 3 hours.  Otherswise it is too tough.

This was fantastic!!  I used beef stew meat, so I cooked this for about 2 1/2 hours adding more water as needed.  Also upped the spices some.  Served in corn tortillas with a little sliced avocado and salsa, SO GOOD!!

This recipe is just fantastic!! I changed a few things, like I used fresh tomatoes but added a can of rotel plus a can of green chiles. I used 1.5 tsp of cumin and regular oregano ( because I had no Mexican oregano). Additions to the finished product: guacamole, cheese and sour cream.. Not to mention some delicious tortillas!! Everyone ate everything!!! Will use again!

I am from Alice, Texas and I now live in Tampa, FL. Good Tex-Mex is really hard to find here in Tampa so I crave the flavors that I grew up eating.  This is a great recipe--enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for posting!

I just made this, and as usual for me, I used this recipe as a base, and tweaked it as I went along. I was very pleased with how it turned out. I floured the meat to help thicken the sauce. I didn't have 4 large tomatoes, so I ended up using the 3 plum tomatoes and about half a container of grape tomatoes that I had on hand. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water, about a cup. I also added a couple beef bouillon cubes and a cilantro bouillon cube. Because the meat I used was really tough, and because I used more liquid than was called for, I ended up letting it simmer for closer to an hour. I will definitely be making this again!

This dish isn’t the traditional Carne Guisada but it is delicious none the less.  I modified it to make a bit of gravy.   I will make this again.

I have made this a few times, each time tweaking it for my family’s tastes. Make it in my InstantPot, browning meat on sauté, then throw everything in on Stew/meat for 20 min, and letting it depressurize in slow cook mode for 30 min. It’s still done in an hour!  Meat is fall-apart tender. This time I added Serrano and jalapeños- perfect! It is truly even better on day 2!

GREAT recipe and authentic South Texas. Carne Guisada has always been my standard for an authentic Mexican Restaurant. So many places it just tastes like beef tips and gravy. This recipe is the real deal. I used Round instead of sirloin and I did a mash up with an Instant Pot recipe   but really good and this was the base

To anyone that doesn’t like this, this could be make 100 different ways and someone wouldn’t like it. This a perfect base recipe!  Add japs, avocado, rotel tomatoes, extra onion, potatoes or whatever you’d like to make it like your moms or to your taste. With the base recipe, create your own family recipe!  I added more garlic, onions, japs and cilantro but that’s how I like it. My mom would disagree with me but I still love hers too!

This was very good but  I believe that everyone adds their own touches depending on what they have and how spicy they like their food.  In this case instead of fresh tomatoes I added a can of Rotel.  I drained the juices from the can and used it in place of the water.  I also don't like cumin as much so substituted 1/2 of it with chili powder.  I grew up with potatoes in my carne guisada so added some (about 4 small red) to it as well.  I chopped the potatoes about the same size as the meat.  Lastly I added cilantro and jalapenos.

I made this but I browned the meat and sautéed the onions and peppers then I put everything in the crock pot.  I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and a can of green chilies and omitted the water. It was really tender and flavorful but the next time I make it I will reduce the amount of cumin.  Way too much cumin for my tastes in the original recipe.

Wow was this really good. I browned the meat and threw everything in the slow cooker. Everyone in the house loved it.

Excellent!  I've lived in South Texas my whole life and eaten a lot of carne guisada, but never could replicate it in my kitchen.  This is the real deal.  Thank you, Rhonda35!

UPDATE: I followed the recipe exactly a second time because I always try recipe's twice to make sure I didn't mess it up.  It was much better.  The ONLY thing I did differently was I used tenderized round steak and a small can of green chili's.  My husband said 4 stars...not 5 though. 
Follow the recipe EXACTLY...because I don't think I did...and it was not good at all.  Not sure where my mistake was...but my husband told me to stick to my other carne guisada recipe.  ;-)

This is really great base to start with or leave it as it is.
