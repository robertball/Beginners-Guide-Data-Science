Love this simple and versatile recipe. After a few tries - my edits are to increase the curry and turmeric, eliminate the cream entirely and add a full tsp of salt and pepper before blending. Homemade chicken stock makes it best, but the roasted cauliflower adds plenty of flavor and creaminess.

This soup is amazing! I used milk instead of cream, and used a few potatoes to thicken it up. My son keeps asking me to make it again, it's a real hit!!

This recipe was so delicious. Ive been wanted to make something out of cauliflower for the longest because Ive never worked with it before. This was perfect. It was so flavorful and tasty. Towards the end, because I didnt have that puree thing, I decided to mash it with a potato masher and then I threw 3-4 cups in the blender. As for the rest I left it alone because I did like those little bites of cauliflower in the soup. It is pretty spicy but I liked it that way. For those of you who want a little kick, but not too much I would cut the cayenne down to 1/2 teaspoon. Overall, Im in love. Definitely making this again sometime soon.

Very good.  As others suggested, I increased the curry and turmeric and deceased the cayenne.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used a can of light coconut milk and some greek yogurt instead.  Very tasty.

I used whole milk instead of cream and would cut the cayenne down to maybe 1/2tsp next time.  It was fantastic and will make again

I made this tonight. The flavor was delicious, salty, spicy, buttery, and not too heavy. I did think the texture was far more thin than the picture indicated. I substituted coconut milk for heavy cream, because I don’t like extremely heavy cream soups. It added just a little touch of sweetness. The cayenne was the perfect heat. Next time I’ll try with coconut milk again but also add a second head of cauliflower, so there is a guaranteed amount of purée and chunks.

Great soup!  When I tasted this soup I couldn't help but smile.  I so enjoyed each spoonful.   The ONLY thing I changed was instead of plain curry powder I used Ocho Rios brand Jerk Curry Seasoning because that is what I had on hand.  I will continue to make this soup and  try adding mushrooms, chicken, broccoli,  whatever I feel would compliment the ingredients.

Only thing I changed was I grilled a chicken breast and diced it and added to the soup.  I would use less cayenne pepper the next time.

Very good base.  I add chicken and leftover veg - spinach, mushrooms, carrots.  Used more broth, less cream, or milk.  Didn't purée.

Amazing.  I ended up using an extra teaspoon of curry, kept the full teaspoon of cayenne (we love spicy), and more or less caramelized the onions in a bit more butter as the cauliflower was baking.  I put the cauliflower on broil for 5 minutes as I mixed up the spices into the onion because the cauliflower didn't brown up fast enough.  
The first time I made it, the head of cauliflower was so big it ended up filling almost my entire 6 quart pot, compared to the second time around when I used a smaller one and it only made just half the pot.  Next time I'll be doubling the amount!  Family loved it!

This was delicious!!!  I will definitely make this again.  I did reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp since I don't like things too spicy.  And, I used whole milk instead of whipping cream.  It turned out just fine.

This is the best cauliflower soup I’ve ever made or eaten. I like the spiciness of the soup. I’d make it again and not before to long. I floated some high quality butter-garlic crotons as a garnish.

Omg, I’m finally able to do a review on something I’ve made. Not because the recipes weren’t good, but because I usually mess something up. This soup is impossible to mess up. So easy.  The only thing I did different was use milk instead of heavy cream, due to calories. It is truly the ‘best’ soup I’ve ever made! I will be adding this soup to my regular recipes. It is so worth trying!!

Doubled the recipe. No Changes. Rated top soup ever made by my son in law. Everyone liked it.

Only suggestion received was cut the heat a little. 

Second day even better.

Excellent flavor! I followed the recipe nearly exactly, didn't use quite as much cayenne as called for. It was plenty spicy for me with just a quarter teaspoon of cayenne.

I was amazed at how much flavor this soup has.... wonderful and even better heated up the next day. I didn’t have any cayenne pepper (too spicy for me), so I substituted a bit of chill seasoning. I will be making this again soon!

Like the other reviewers, I definitely recommend using less (or even no) cayenne pepper - it’s far too spicy otherwise! Other changes I made included substituting turmeric with nutmeg (because I had no turmeric), adding two extra teaspoons of curry powder, and since I only had half a cauliflower I added two large potatoes and used less of the stock too. I also don’t have a blender or anything like that, so after the vegetables were soft enough I just used a potatoes masher. Super yummy served with garlic bread!

Roasted cauliflower is now on my favorites list. I did break out in a bit of a sweat eating this and I mean that in a good way!

Vegetarian/vegan method.  Toss the chopped cauliflower, a chopped shallot or onion ( I used a shallot)& minced garlic in Olive oil and salt. Roast veggies in oven for approximately 25 mins stirring half way.  Melt butter/oil (I used butter) in a pot and toss in the seasoning and stir for about one minute. Stir in 2 litres of vegetable broth.  Add the roasted veggies and add one cup of rinsed lentils.  I used red and they were delicious.  Cook until lentils are soft. 
 The family loved this and I quote "this one is a keeper".  Enjoy!

Added more pepper than in the recipe - OOPS just a little hotter than planned guess I'll be eating this batch alone.   Easy to make and added a new kitchen appliance to my arsenal.   

This is nearly as good as I've had at restaurants, I'm sure it was me I'll just have to try and try again until I get it right.

This is a very tasty soup! I added more curry and shredded cheese for protein, as well as sliced mushrooms. Definitely a keeper!

I tossed everything into a slow cooker for four hours on high. At the end, I blended all of it. Easy, tasty, and perfect with garlic toast. And the next day over rice.

We love this recipe. I doubled it by adding a whole broccoli and a couple small  peppers and we grilled them as well. We added a couple cups of shredded cheddar cheese but used a lighter cream.  Next time we will half the cayenne pepper and double the curry powder. It’s a great recipee for using up the vegetables in your fridge.

This was very good.  Used skim milk instead of cream. Made a small pot and just covered cauliflower with the broth.  Didn’t need to thicken. Added Swiss cheese and bacon bits when serving

This is by far the BEST soup recipe I've found. I've made it a few times in less than a week and can't get enough.  I've had curry in North and South America, Asia and Europe and even in India and never had better.  I've even substituted potatoes and it was still good

Very tasty soup, indeed. I substituted Greek yoghurt for the heavy cream, which gave it a different flavor twist (and significantly fewer calories).

Love it, love curry!   :)  My husband and two kids (11 and 9) LOVED this and were already saying I needed to make it again whilst eating it for the first time.  
Tip:  This was very spicy with having 1 tsp of cayenne in it so if you prefer mild or medium curry/temps, I'd start with less (maybe 1/4-3/4 depending on preference) as you can always add more after tasting, etc.

Outstanding!! The only change I made was to cook the onion mix after adding seasoning for 1-2 mins. I was afraid that he seasoning had absorbed too much moisture and would burn. Also, I added chopped chicken breasts (3) after purée for extra protein. Amazing flavor!!!!!

This was really good. For me, 1/2 tsp cayenne was enough.  I have also used 1/2 butternut squash and 1/2 cauliflower and that is wonderful, too.

I didn’t have any turmeric so I just eliminated it. And I used condensed nonfat whole milk instead of the cream. I reduced the amount of cayenne but it was still very spicy. I like spicy but if you don’t perhaps reduce even more. I used about 1/2 tsp.

I made no changes this time.  When I make it again,  I will try it using milk instead of heavy cream.  Definitely cut back on the cayenne by half.  This soup has a kick to it that I wasn't expecting but also a great flavor.

Took this to a Soup Night celebration and it was a big hit. Used more curry and less cayenne.  Also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth (to accommodate my vegetarian friends) and half-and-half for the whipping cream.  Really tasty!

This soup took a bit longer to make because of the step of roasting the cauliflower in the oven but it was worth it to get that roasted flavor. I cut down on the pepper as other cooks did and put in more curry . I will be making this again!

Great winter soup! I made some minor changes - I cleaned out veggie scraps from the fridge, so I also roasted some left over broccoli florets with the full head of cauliflower florets.
I also added some yellow, red and orange peppers to the onion mix, substituting Canola oil for butter.
I kept the spices the same measure.
I didn't use cream, but added milk which was fine but in after thought, would consider light coconut milk instead. 
All in all, very tasty with the right heat of spice for my palate.

This was a great soup! I added a couple of peeled red potatoes, and chicken bullion. I didn't blend it with an immersion blender, just mashed everything up with a potato masher, which gave it a nice creamy texture and left a lot of nice chunky veggies. It was spicier than I expected, but really good.

I found this super yummy. I cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because the rest of my family does not share my love for all things spicy, and this was a perfect compromise. A quick, easy and delicious recipe. I will be making this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and found the soup to be too spicy for my family.  Next time, I'll use less cayenne.  Other than that, this turned out to be delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

Think we made this exactly as directed; well, maybe a bit more curry than called for. The quality of the curry powder's going to be important in this recipe. Spicy and creamy: all kids and adults loved it.

Very flavorful and hearty soup. I found it to be a bit too spicy and my husband thought it was way too spicy. Next time I will make it more mild. Great soup to have during a cold, I suspect.  Also, I had no heavy cream on hand and couldn't justify a trip to the store for it; so I used half cup of milk and about a third cup of sour cream instead. Thank you.

I started one recipe then switched to this only change was 3/4 cup grated carrot and 2 stalks of celery. As with one other reviewer I like spicy but I did find it a tad to hot, will cut cayenne to 1/2 tsp next time, and there will be a next time. Thanks

This recipe was delicious and I will definitely use again. I only made a few adjustments. I used less than a full teaspoon of cayenne and found that it was still pretty spicy and I love spice. I changed the amount because I know my curry powder is spicy so just be caustious with that. I also added carrots which added a touch of sweetness and celery. Pretty much whatever vegetables I had in my fridge that I needed to get rid of. Soo tasty. Thanks Allyson.

I LOVE this recipe.  The only changes made were due to my not having some of the ingredients.  It is very flavorful and I will make it again and again.  Thanks for posting.  :)

A definite keeper, with one sub: 1% milk plus a blended potato or two instead of cream. Served with coconut yogurt and croutons. Heavenly.

Used whipping cream instead of heavy cream. This recipe had lots of flavor. Very satisfying!
