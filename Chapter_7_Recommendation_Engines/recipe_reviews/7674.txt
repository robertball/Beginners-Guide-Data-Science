I made this to top the "Best Brownies" recipe on this site. It was great. I used a little less vanilla, because I didn't want to run out.  For the coffee, I used one single serving instant coffee package mixed with the three tablespoons of water.  I melted the butter completely in the microwave.  The icing came out thick and spreadable, and tasted great on the brownies.

I was looking for something to go on tope of a chocolate birthday cake and found this recipe. I am pleasantly surprised. I varied the recipe by using 2 tablespoons of Mexican Rum and Expresso Coffee Powder instead of Strong Coffee. Jackpot!!! This recipe has potential in that a lot of variations of the theme is possible. I could try Whiskey, Maraschino, Amaretto, . . . 

The reason that I did not give it a high Kid Friendly rating is because Coffee is an ADULT taste. Kids do not like coffee that much. Of course, I also discounted this on my overall rating. . . .on the other hand, my son liked it.

This is great on Chocolate Cake, and a good recipe to experiment with!

This recipe, as is, has an odd consistency.  I even made sure not to add the entire amount of coffee at first, and to only use more as needed to make sure it wasn't too runny.  It has a very "foamy" consistency, once applied to the cake.  I made a second batch and lightly melted the butter, and added about a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder.  Perfect!  The color was also much better, and the texture was creamy, fluffy, and wonderful!  It's a good base to work from, which I appreciate! :)

great tasting and good consistency! I used 2 15ml spoonfulls of coffee and used half a mugfull of boiling water.
Ended up using a few tablespoons of coffe mix until just right flavour and consistency.

Wow! really great icing recipe! I added some cocoa powder in it to give it a deeper tone, made it as directed and it came out a bit thin, but that was perfect for what i was using it for... drizzled over chocolate filled crossionts, it makes a pretty presentation and looks like you did alot of work. Thanks for this, it's really yummy!

even better than regular coffee, dump about 5 servings worth of instant coffee in with 1-2 tbs of boiling water to make a coffee concentrate paste, then add milk as needed for texture. gives it that extra kick!

Not that much cofee tasting, but a nicely flavored icing nonetheless.  It came together perfectly, even though I had literally only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar in the house (I realised at the last moment).  Made it for the Mocha cake as suggested.  This is _just_ enough to properly frost a layer cake.

Use milk instead of coffee or any other flavored liquid and you have the perfect icing recipe.

I liked the texture of this frosting, nice and fluffy with a great coffee flavor.  I did add a little cocoa powder to get a nice tan color, but I don't think it made much of a difference to the frosting.  I refrigerated it before piping onto my cupcakes and it's possible that is what kept it from being runny like other reviewers said. (doubled the recipe of frosting for 24 cupcakes)

Really easy to make and hardened in the refrigerator for easy cutting. The frosting was a hit with chocolate cake.

I didn't think it would taste as much
 like coffee as it did. It didn't take
 long at all to make. You don't need 
that much butter.

Excellent...except I wish I read the reviews before I made it. The consistency was too watery. I wound up needing to make more so I added more butter and a bit more sugar, but instead of adding liquid coffee I used some instant coffee with as little water as I could and added some unsweetened cocoa. I didn't melt the butter completely and I then refrigerated it for a little.

Very tasty recipe and very easy.  DH, DG, and I like really strong coffee flavor so I boiled 1/4 cup of water and added a 1 1/2 tablespoons of instant coffee; I only used about 3 tablespoons of this.  Also, I only used about 3 tablespoons partially melted butter instead of a quarter cup (I thought I had a quarter but apparently not).  Whipped up nicely and spread pretty well on the chocolate cinnamon sheet cake I made.  Will definitely use again!

Doubled the recipe to use with chocolate mocha cake. Was just enough to cover the outside with a tiny bit left over. I Sifted the icing sugar. Also, I used decaf instant coffee to make it more child friendly. Everyone loved it. Perfect for piping decorations onto a cake as well. Delicious and easy! Thanks!

I followed a review that said to melt the butter and I used just a little extra sugar and a tbls of cocoa. I refrigerated after mixing and then spread on a chocolate cake and then refrigerated it until ready to eat. Thanks Carol!

An easy to make frosting for a pan of Coffee Chocolate Brownies (from a 'gently used' Canadian Living Chocolate Cookbook I picked up at a  book sale over the week-end - what a find!). I took the advice of other reviewers and added a tsp of expresso powder to the vanilla before adding it to the mixture, and it did enhance the flavour of the icing. A chocolate covered coffee bean on top of each brownie made this a fancy addition to a dessert party.

Based on another review- I melted the butter completely- and it wasn't the right thing to do.  I have a delicious, but ugly mess of a cake waiting for us for dessert tonight.  I added 1 Tbsp of instant coffee granules to the butter and it really added a depth of coffee flavor to the icing.    I will try this again because it tastes delicious!  I just need to work on getting the consistancy right!

This is a keeper. In fact I want to make anything that needs frosting just to taste it again! With other reviewer's suggestions the changes/additions that I made were: 3 Tbsp butter, 2 Tbsp strong brewed coffee, 1 Tbsp cocoa powder to deepen the color.

I used this recipe to frost Christine's Coffee Liqueur Cookies from this site.  It turned out great!  Instead of 3 Tbsp. coffee, I used 1.5 Tbsp. coffee liqueur and 1.5 Tbsp. milk.  Came out very flavorful and a great consistency!

Used it on the puffs (at least the one that had coffee-flavored custard cream in them :) ) to make my wedding cake (croquembouche) - it took a while to make. Out of the three icings I made (chocolate, coffee and vanilla), it was the longest. But It was worth it!!

I rate this recipe 3 star because it isn't very beginner-friendly recipe though the proportion of ingredients seem to be correct. I made this icing in two batches. In the first batch I didn't know how long to beat so it turned out a little less fluffy. For the next batch I beat it somewhat longer and it was fluffier. I still don't know if the next time I should beat longer than that.

This icing turned out terrible. It was very runny, and the color was not appealing at all!!!! I ended up mixing in more coffee, than cocoa, then more butter, etc. It is extrememly sweet. I would not make this again. I am sorry to offend, because the other reviews are very good I was shocked that it turned out so badly for me.

This did not turn out well for me at all. It was too gritty, too sweet, and wasn't smooth at all. I followed the directions precisely but I could not get this recipe to work!

I doubled the recipe and it was the perfect amount to pipe onto 24 cupcakes.  Tastes great, and not greasy.  I'm definitely printing the recipe so I can use again.

Very, very nice!  Even using very strong coffee (it had legs...ugh) it wasn't quite strong enough for me in the mocha department so I added a tablespoon of Kahlua.  I had to force myself not to lick the daubs of frosting off the counter.  Man, this is soooo good!

delicious! i make frosting like this (minus the coffee and not as much butter) all the time for everything from cinnamon rolls to sugar cookies, but i never considered using coffee instead of milk for the liquid so im glad i found this recipe! i put it on chocolate fudge cake mix cookies and they are fantastic with this frosting!

I think coffee goes well with a lot of things. I put this on a spice cake and the combination was very good.  It was a little too thin though . next time i will use butter instead of margarine because i think the flavor would be better.

Yum. I replaced one Tbsp. of the coffee with a Tbsp. of Patron coffee liqueur. I used this to frost a small pumpkin cake which, surprisingly, tasted pretty good. It was like having a cup a joe with a slice of pumpkin pie.

This wasn't bad. I stuck it on top of some deep dish brownies I made, and it went nicely with them. I had to add more powdered sugar to make it less of a glaze, but it was nice enough. I subbed 3 T milk and 1 t coffee granules for the hot coffee.

This is definitely thinner like a usual icing (not as frosting-like as the picture shows), but the flavor is really great. I used it as icing for a sour cream coffee cake and it was amazing.

I added bakers cocoa powder, and followed the recipe completely.
It was more of a thick glaze, which was perfect because I'm putting it on top of a banana nut bread.

Also noting, you could easily add cinnamon and rum instead of vanilla for the upcoming holidays.

I gave this 5 stars because it really is a good base for icing.  I made almond butter cream icing and it was delicious! I just substituted 3 Tablespoons of milk instead of the coffee and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract.  For the coffee icing, I substituted 2 teaspoons of instant coffee (which dissolves quickly) for the brewed coffee and kept the vanilla extract the same recommendation in this recipe and I also added the 3 Tablespoons of milk.  And then for mocha icing do the same with the instant coffee and milk substitution and then add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa. Of course you can add more or less instant coffee and/or cocoa to suit your taste.  Double the recipe for good amount of icing on cupcakes.  *I do like a cherry flavor in my mocha so I do use almond extract instead of vanilla for the mocha icing.  

I read other reviews where the icing is runny, but for me, it was perfect in thick spreading consistency for cupcakes and cake. Even using the brewed coffee, just make sure it is not hot and beat in the tablespoons of the brewed coffee one at a time. That helps for me with the original.

I made the recipe exactly the first time and it was a bit runny for my liking. The second time I omitted the vanilla (you don't miss it) and the consistency was right. Both times the strong-brewed coffee (from our French press) flavor came through. Easy and tasty!

I didn't get a lot of the coffee flavor.  It was exceptionally sweet.  I may need to adjust that a bit next time.  Thanks though!

Double the recipe if you want enough for a double layer round cake, and even then it is barely enough.

I did not like this icing. It was too strong and too runny!

yes, the icing is runny, but i just topped the cake and let it sit in the fridge for a while, and it worked out just fine.
