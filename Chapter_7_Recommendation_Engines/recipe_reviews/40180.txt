WOW!  What a wonderful cookie.  I just made these last night for a cookie tray and they were the best of all five varities I tried.  I did make a few changes to the recipe: *I added 1 1/2 tsp of zest like some of the other reviews suggested. *I used fresh cranberries and sliced them in half (not chopped).  I thought they were the perfect size when the cookies baked.  *Some of the other reviews suggested adding vanilla extract, but I think that almond extract and cranberries are made for eachother, so... I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp. almond extract. *Instead of walnuts, I added almond gems to accompany the extract. The gems are small enough so they don't stand out too much -- perfect for nut lovers and perfect for the rest of us! *I decided to try the cookies w/o the frosting first because of some reviews stating that the cookies were too sweet. I thought the cookies were perfect w/o the frosting, so why hassel?!! *Also, if I left them in the oven one second longer than 12 minutes, they were overcooked.

These cookies are a huge favorite of ours! I've made them a few times and always have to make two changes - add 1/2 to 1 cup extra flour and chill the dough a little, and bake them at 350 instead of 375.  As no one else has mentioned doing that, I blame it on high altitude; however, the flour thing is a little strange to me - I've never seen a cookie recipe with a cup of butter need less than 3 or 4 cups of flour.  The first batch of these cookies I made (with the stated amount of flour) spread all over the pan in one big flat gooey cookie, so I made the above changes and have absolutely loved every batch since.

Oh my goodness these are THE BEST!  I usually make cranberry orange bread during the holidays, but from now on I'm making these cookies instead.  I added a splash of vanilla extract, pulsed the fresh cranberries in my food processor and used 2 T. orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice and they spread out beautifully and have the perfect texture and balance of sweet and tart.  I didn't even make the icing and my 3 year old loves them!  Thank you Meg!

omg whoever submitted this, I LOVE YOU. i tried making seven different types of cookies in the last 3 days, because I have a cookie party tomorrow night and nothing would turn out right.. and then i stumbled on this just because I had bought (dried) cranberries for another recipe and I had allthe other ingredients, so i was like, ok lets give it a go. THEY TASTE FABULOUS!. they look adorable, very appropriate to give as gifts, they are sooo easy to make and yeah, just brilliant. but DO NOT overcook them. take them out when they go golden around the edges and it may well be befor e 12 minutes is even up. THANKYOU to whoever posted this on here!!!!

I grated one whole orange and used all the zest as it tends to have a better kick and presentation.  Also instead of orange juice, I squeeze all the juice of the grated orange.  Use 1/3 of the juice mix into the cookie batter (to give a more citrus-y taste) and the rest for the frosting.

VERY good! Chewy. a bit on the sweet side with the glaze, I preferred it without it, and I REALLY like my sweets! I'd also suggest adding 1/2 cup of flour, which would produce a slightly softer, less sweet cookie. But, over all, the taste is great! Definitely made it into the family favorites!

Like everyone else, I thought these cookies were very good.  I read the reviews before I started and took the advice of "Brooke Salt" and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of orange zest, cut fresh cranberries in  half, addded 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  After baking the first tray, I found out "Loves Cheese" was also right!  The first tray flatted out too much unless you like really, really, thin cookies.  I had the next batch ready to go in the oven and threw them back in the bowl and added about a half cup more of flour.  The next thing I saw she was right about, was baking at 350 instead of 375.  I am selling mine on cookie trays and don't want dark brown edges!  If you like dark brown edges, bake at 375!  They were sweet and didn't need frosting, but since they were going on cookie trays, I felt they needed to be dressed up a little and didn't want the added sweetness so I melted some white chocolate and drizzled on top.  Now, all that being said, isn't it amazing that over 300 people rated this cookie, most of them with 5 stars and so many of us still find fault with it?  :)

I made these cookies for some friends last night, who were surprised to love a cookie didn't have chocolate, but rather had fruit in it! The orange topping came out a little runny with 3tbs orange juice, so I added a bit more confec. sugar to the mix. The cookies turned out much sweeter than I'd imagined, and I'll definately be making these again.

A tasty and nice holiday cookie.  As a previous reviewer said, these are a "soft" type cookie, and they have a nice orange flavor.  Make sure you add enough cranberries - mine could've used a few more.  I might add a touch of vanilla to the cookie batter next time and a smidge more orange zest.  The icing was fine - I added a bit more orange zest to it.

These are family favourites in our house.  My 2 year old son even loves them.  The frosting on the top make them look more fancy than your everyday cookie.  It is great to put in a cookie exchange as it makes a lot of cookies.  THANKS!

These are delectable cookies! I used a 12-oz bag of fresh cranberries which equaled 2 cups, some left whole and rough chopped. I wanted a stronger orange flavor so I added an extra 1 tsp. of orange zest to both the batter and the glaze. Instead of walnuts I chose to use chopped pecans. I added a ½ cup extra flour, used ¾ br. sugar, added ½ tsp. of almond extract, chilled the dough a little and baked them at 375 degrees. Each batch baked up in 12 minutes producing 48 beautiful light golden brown cookies. They were light and thick cookies with bright red cranberries peeking out. This produced a wonderful citrus-y fruity aroma in my house which I absolutely loved. Cookies were soft, sweet, tart and simply delicious. The pecans are perfect with the cranberries and added a nice crunchy texture to the cookies. The specks of bright red cranberries made for beautiful cookies underneath the snowy white glaze. The orange glaze tastes wonderful adding another wonderful layer of a light sweet flavor and makes a beautiful presentation (see my picture).  This is the perfect balance of sweet and tart! This has become one of my favorite holiday cookies to bake and eat. It is easy to make with great results and makes for a wonderful holiday gift. This is one cookie recipe I don’t want to lose!

Yum yum yum! Thank you so much for this recipe.  It reminds me of the scones I get on campus and was craving so badly during break.  I doubled the recipe and brought some to the Chirstmas parties we had and everyone liked them.  I upped the amount of orange zest in both the cookies and the icing.  Also, I used dried cranberries which were soaked in orange juice while the butter softened to help them get a little plump. Thanks again this is my new go-to cookie recipe!

very good cookie alternative to the usual one that has some form of chocolate in it.    i added the 1/2 cup extra flour like others' suggestions.  since i didn't have fresh cranberries on hand (also, that i would be too lazy to de-pitt them) i soaked 1 cup of dried Craisons in orange juice over night and it produced just under 2 cups of juicy, orange infused cranberries.  i added 3-4 tbls of this cranberry infused orange juice instead of the suggested 2 tbls.  i used the zest of one large orange.  I also  added 1 tsp of almond extract.  it complements the orange nicely. i didn't use any glaze and it was perfect.  it did start to get a bit hard quickly while cooling on the rack, so like one of the other suggestions, i put a slice of bread in with the cookies when i moved them all to the cookie jar.  they are all very moist and delish.  thanks for sharing the recipe and thank you everyone for sharing your feedback!

MADE LOAVES:  i made the batter as above, but then had to stick it in the fridge for a day because i had errands to do.  when i made then they were flat.  when i put it in the cookie jar with the slice of bread they all melled together(too moist).  So i stuck the rest into mini-loaves pan.  Yummy!

good flavor but they came out extremely "cake-like" and fluffy. Not really the consistency you want or expect from a cookie. You mind as well pour the batter into a loaf pan and make cranberry orange bread.

This cookie is delicious & very pretty. The only thing I changed was I added a splash of almond extract to the batter & after tasting the end result, I think the orange zest (which I accidentally added 1tsp) over powered it. I used a big cookie scoop, probably 1/4 cup & cooked for 16 mins. Perfect! It made 21 cookies. Perfect for the holidays. Thank you!

Everyone in my family--including my young granddaughters--gave these gems a 5!  Talk about delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except to add 1/4 teaspoon of almond flavoring.  A 12-oz bag of fresh cranberries equals 2 cups, cut in half.  I need to make another batch of these again this weekend!  They are not lasting!  YUM!  Thanks for posting this!

Five stars for flavor, for sure! Bright, fresh flavors of orange and cranberry that need no additional flavorings to mask it! The cookie itself, however,I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about - too soft, almost bendable, and for me anyway, a little on the greasy side (which is probably why they're so, I mean TOO, soft). I think you could work with this to correct it - perhaps adding another 1/2 of flour might be a good fix. But as it stands I cannot vouch for the dough as is. The flavor of the cookie coupled with the delicious. refreshing orange glaze, however, is worth toying with the dough a little to get it just right.

These cookies were AWESOME! I followed the recipe excatly and they were perfect. I froze the extra dough and just made a few to test and I was shocked how great they were, even without the glaze. These are going on my cookie trays this year, and will be a favorite in my house!

Good, chewy, moist cookie. The tartness is a nice contrast. I reversed the white/brown sugar amounts (1/2 c.white & 1 cup brown). This made a nicer, golden cookie with richer flavor, otherwise the cookie has stark white appearance.  The cookie spreads quite a bit when the dough not chilled.  Pull it out of the oven when it is still a little wet in the middle to keep it chewy when cooled.  Have added white chocolate chips to this too with great results(reduce cranberry to 1 cup).  And definitely use fresh cranberries or else the cookie has a flat taste.  The light drizzle of glaze gives a nice flavor contrast to the tart berries as well as more visual appeal.  A fall favorite in our house.

I made seven types of cookies this Christmas and these were the most raved about!  I followed the recipe as written except I used half butter and half Crisco instead of using all butter. (I do that with all cookies.)  The food processor works great for chopping up the cranberries.  Also, I chilled the dough before baking.  It is a fun surprising little cookie worth the effort.

DELICIOUS!!!  I upped the orange zest in the cookie to pretty much an entire large orange (it was almost 2 teaspoons) and in the icing I upped it to about 1 tsp.  You will need a bag of fresh cranberries to get the 2 cups chopped. I chopped most of the cranberries by hand and then realized I was an idiot and tossed them in my food processor. MUCH better - but don't over chop.  Chill the dough for a bit before handling - it will help get the shape right. The batter doesn't spread, so go for the mounded spoonfull and form them as you want them to look later.   I baked mine on parchment paper lined trays for about 14 minutes. You will notice they are brownish, especially on the bottom - don't over bake them. They will feel pretty soft, but the cookies will set as they cool.  GREAT recipe - everyone is raving about them!

Because I don't have the time to sit around waiting for batches of cookies to bake, I nearly always make bar cookies out of drop cookie recipes. In general, if a recipe makes three to four dozen cookies, you can transfer the cookie dough to a 13x9 pan and add about 50 percent longer to your baking time. 

I made these cookies as directed using 1 cup dry cranberries (Craisins) since that's what I had on hand; I soaked the Craisins in orange juice for about 15 minutes to plump them and infuse them with flavor. I added about 1/2 t vanilla to the dough as well. I also added the zest and juice of two oranges (more juice and zest than was called for), and they were not too "orangy." In fact, I wouldn't have been able to taste the orange had I not used as much zest as I did. 

I also added more zest to the glaze. 

I baked in a 13x9 pan for 20 minutes, and they turned out perfect, very chewy and moist; the glaze is a must - it adds an extra layer of orange flavor.

Outstanding!! All my coworkers agree so this review represents and extra 5 people who think it's 5-Stars-Great. Ever the skeptic, I made 1 batch with 1/4 tsp almond extract and one without. Yes, definitely include- it adds a great extra touch. The first batch I drizzled glaze, put in refrigerator to harden glaze, then stacked between sheets of waxed paper. Then I got tired (because it was midnight after all), didn't stack between waxed paper and they stuck together. Hopefully you'll learn from my mistake. Also used my magic bullet to pulse the cranberries to make that step easier- it worked well. Enjoy!

These cookies are fantastic!  I have made 3 different kinds of cookies this week, and my husband says these are the best.  I followed the advice of reviewer "Eleisa" and used dried cranberries that were soaked overnight in orange juice.  I too added more flour, orange juice, and orange zest.  We like them with the glaze and without it.  Thanks for this recipe!  I will definitely make these cookies again and again.

Each year I bake cookies for the Holidays and each year they turn out dry. I think the 2 sticks of butter help here but don't tell anyone ;) This recipe is incredible; The cookies turned out so moist. Color/texture is exactly what you would expect. Usually, if you want a little color, they tend to be dry. Not those cookies. I love that fresh cranberries are used and add kick to the sweetness of the cookies. I did not do the glaze and I think they are moist enough to enjoy like that.  Thanks!

Very good recipe I made it as per the recipe only used all organic ingredients and skipped the glaze. Everyone loved them even my 5 year old who does not like cranberries. Only problem was we couldn't stop eating them!

Use 1 cup Craisins instead of fresh cranberries.  Small Pampered Chef scoop: 8 minutes at 350 F. on heated stoneware sheet.  They come out like a delicious, small cookie!

Yum! The mixture seemed overly moist so I added an extra half cup of flour. Keep a close eye on the cooking time, you may need to shorten it depending on your oven and they can burn fast (I found 11 minutes to be optimal). I would definitely reccomend using FRESH cranberries if possible, they are more tart than dried and such a wonderful complement to the sugar frosting.  The cookies were so good on their own I was tempted not to add the frosting but I'm glad I did. Put the glaze in a plastic sandwich bag & cut off a very small corner to swirl the glaze on - it looks really pretty (the first time I just spread the frosting on and the cookies looked kind of boring).

These cookies are absolutely scrumptious!  And a hit with my family who usually turn their noses up at anything with fruit during the calorie-filled holidays.  I used whole wheat flour and chopped the cranberries from frozen so that they wouldn't make the mixture pink.  I like to freeze them and pack one with my lunch as the perfect dessert--satisfies my carb/pastry craving and sweet tooth!

I just won 1st prize at a cookie exchange with this recipe!!!  It was fabulous!  

The only change I made was to use orange juice concentrate in both the cookies and the glaze for a more intense orange flavor.  

These cookies look so beautiful with the red cranberry pieces.  I chopped mine pretty finely in a food processor and it made them look like little jewels in the cookies.  

Also, the icing very thick and opaque - you can't see the cookie through the icing.  I think I would prefer a glaze so you can see the beautiful cookie through the glaze so next time, I'm going to use more orange juice concentrate and thin out the icing a bit so that it's more translucent and glaze like.   

But really, these cookies are terrific just as they are.  Not overly sweet with a hint of tart and beautiful and very festive.

Great cookie recipe, a nice change from the usual greasy chocolate chip cookie.  I only had tangerines instead of orange so used this zest and juice, not sure if this was an improvement or not, but certainly no complaints.  I pulsed cranberries in the food processor and although dough was wet it was not unworkable at room temperature. I baked at 350 degrees since I also had another cake in the oven (an incredible Cranberry Spice Cake from Epicurious/Bon Appetit Nov 2011 - if you like these cookies you will love this cake!) I iced half the cookies but found the iced ones became very crumbly (no problem with the taste!) so next time I will probably skip the icing all together.   Its a shame you can't get cranberries all year around because it would be great to have these cookies all year around instead of only around Thanksgiving/Christmas time.

WONDERFUL! This is a great cookie!   I followed a few of the other reviews:  I used fresh cranberries, cut in half. They were perfect! And I think they added elegance to the look of the cookie.  I added Almond Extract (1/2 tsp)  I did not make the glaze for the topping, my family thought they were sweet enough as is- so we just skipped it.   I found that baking them at this high of a temp for so long did not yield best results. I am at a high altitude, so I added 1/4 cup more flour, turned the heat down to 350, and found that 12 minutes was perfect.  Thank you- these are keepers!!!!

the flavor of these cookies was great, but I didn't care for the consistency, the dough was very sticky the first batch was flat.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added more flour, but they just didn't turn out to be a "cookie" consistency.

OH MAN! This is the best cookie Ive ever had! Its buttery and crispy on the edges and has a zesty taste to it, but not over powering at all. Wonderful! I added pecans instead of walnuts and I halved the recipe. There is no way half would have made 24 cookies though. I should have done the full recipe.

I made these for the first time this holiday season (I do a LOT of baking / various things) and this was voted at the top of this year's treats!  I'll definitely be making these again.  Also, I substituted 1 cup of white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose (i.e. I used 1 cup white whole wheat and 1-1/2 cups all-purpose).  Awesome!

I think these cookies are delicious but 375 is too high and 12-14 minutes is way too long.  I baked them at 350 for 10-12 minutes and they came out much better.

Very good.  Not a crispy cookie, soft and flavorful, sweet with the occasional tang of a cranberry.  I didn't use the frosting-I'm out of powdered sugar-but DH rates these a five and I agree.

These were incredible!! They are very tasty and not that hard to make at all. The statement is right - they did not stay around long. I took a batch of various cookies in to work, and these were the first to go. And they were the most highly acclaimed ones, too.   I think that I didn't let my cookies cool enough before I put the frosting on, so next time I will let them cool fully (and keep my hubby away from them as they do) before I frost them.  OMG they are so good. Yummmm! I don't like nuts so I excluded them. Otherwise I followed the recipe as-is

I think these are fantastic! I can see how they might not be a hit with everyone, but I loved them. They are delightfully tart and sweet at the same time. I doubled the orange zest in the cookies and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, which gave them a wonderful flavor. Thanks! :)

So, so yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to use a tiny bit less cranberries, because I didn't have enough on hand. These were beautiful for the holidays! They were devoured! The only thing I would recommend is to use less milk in the icing. That way it makes a pretty drizzle instead of running all over. Would make these again for sure!

This is the best cookie!  I try to use fresh cranberries when they are in season but frozen work well.  I pat dry the excess moisture and they are almost as good as the fresh.  I put the frosting in a piping bag with a small tip to make a consistent design.  ENJOY

THese are great.  I used CRAISINS instead of using fresh cranberries and that made it a lot easier.   I'm not sure the batch I made is going to make it to Christmas.  I'll have to make another batch befor the holidays.  A great change from the standard sugar cookies or butter cream cookies you usually have during the holidays.

FABULOUS!! Like tiny bites of cranberry nut bread. Nice, soft cookies. The dough does not spread out a great deal. Here, we like the cranberries only halved, so that you get that nice, tart little kick with each bite. I chopped them at first, but you lose a little of the tartness that way. Made a buttery glaze which really made the flavor pop, using 1-1/2 Tb softened butter, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1-1/2 Tb frozen orange juice concentrate and enough cream to make it relatively thick, then brushed on the warm cookies, letting melt and it drizzle down lazily. As pretty as they are flavorful. Spectacular taste and presentation. They're a big holiday favorite  here.

These were surprisingly delicious.  I sub. almonds for the walnuts and chopped them up to crumbs. I also added a bit of almond extract.  I didn't end up adding the glaze.. but I think white chocolate would be a delicious drizzled on top.

These are sooo good! I'm worried they won't last until the holidays! I did add about 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Chopped fresh cranberries in the food processor; cooked for 13 minutes at 350. They are delicious without the frosting/glaze, but they don't look that pretty. Therefore, I did the glaze - used 1 cup confectioner's sugar, put it in plastic baggie and snipped a corner. They look great! Waiting for the glaze to set and I plan on freezing them until the holidays.

These are delicious!  Had a Christmas party and they were devoured.  Had people putting them in their pocket to take home.  The dough did not come together very well with the mixer so I used my hands to bring it all together.  Added a little orange extract to emphasize the flavor.  I used 6 oz. bag of Craisins in place of the cranberries.

This is the third year I have made these cookies. By mistake this year I bought sweetened cranberries and the cookies turned out okay but I prefer fresh cranberries--the tartness is an outstanding contrast to the orange. Last year I used dried unsweetened cranberries. By far my favorite is with the fresh unsweetened cranberries which I will make sure I use next year!

Have been making these cookies for years! I usually add a more orange juice and for extra flavour, I throw in a dash of either Gran Marnier or Triple Sec. Another reviewer used OJ concentrate and this is also good. I usually chop frozen cranberries and lightly coat them with a little sugar for those who don't like the tart taste. Haven't tried these with chocolate chips yet.

Oh my goodness! I love the combination of cranberries and oranges, so I was excited to try this recipe. I used fresh cranberries and I followed the recommendations of others by adding almond extract (1/2 tsp) and extra flour (1/4 cup). I also left out the glaze and baked them for 13 minutes at 350. Thank you!

OMG!  BEST COOKIE I EVER ATE!  I used 1 cup regular chopped cranberries and 1 cup Craisins soaked in warm orange liquor.  I used Cointreau, but Grand Marnier would work nicely also.  Soooo good!  Thanks for this recipe, I will make it every Christmas!

Delicious cookies, I've never made anything with fresh cranberries and made these for a gathering this past weekend where I had to bring the dessert. They were the hit of the party. Only thing I did different was to change the sugar to 3/4 cup white and brown, which gave the cookies more of a golden coloring. I also put in a teaspoon of almond extract which goes very well with the other flavors. I didn't put the glaze on them because I had no time, but think they were just perfect without it. Oh and many reviews said a 12 oz. bag is equal to two cups of chopped cranberries, not true it is three cups. I only put in 2 1/2 cups since I left out the nuts and think anymore would be too much tartness....you would certainly need the frosting to even out the tart vs. sweetness if you use the whole 12oz. bag.

These cookies were very good but not the best I've ever had.  I'm glad I chose to make less cookies than the original recipe called for.  I reduced the serving size to 24 cookies and somehow only got 13 out of the recipe.  I can't imagine how small they would have to be to make a full 24.  I would make it again but I wouldn't tell my coworkers, "These cookies will blow your mind up!"... Instead, I'd just say, "I made cookies- yes, they are free and no, they are not poisonous."

Thic cookies is really really good! I agree that the frosting is a bit much as the cookie is already sweet enough. I also agree with some users that it needs more flour to the recipe. I made two other variations i used a whole orange(for juice and Zest) and I used pecan only b/c that's all i had and they worked out great! yummm, i've also added craisins and white chocolate chips and cut back on the white sugar a bit so instead of a cup I've used a little over 1/2 to 3/4 cup. But the recipes as is- Is abosolutely delish and great all on it own. Thank you thank you thank you

One of my favourite flavours is lemon cranberry, so I tried replacing all the orange parts in this recipe with lemon, and it was fantastic!! To combat two tart tastes (the lemon and the cranberry), I cut the fresh cranberries to 1 cup and then used 1 cup of raisins. Delicious!

Very good cookie.  This recipes combines the taste of the cranberries and oranges really well.  I chopped frozen cranberries to equal the 2 cups and squeezed an orange for the juice.  I like the tartness of the cranberries in this recipe.  Will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Has it's own unique taste.  Delicious.  Received many compliments.  :-)  I too had to add more flour, the reason for the 4-stars.  I made these last year and used Craisins but this year I used fresh cranberries.  The fresh cranberries made it a little more moist.  They are yummy either way.

Absolutely Delish!  Like other reviewers, I added an extra 1/4 of flour and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. The flavors of this cookie are wonderful, but I was most impressed by the consistency. They're just soft enough but not chewy. Best of all, they maintain a beautiful shape when baked. Most of my cookies flatten like pancakes, but these held their shape exceptionally well. I added the drizzle for decorative reasons, but it was not really needed. I'll make this cookie again and again.

BLOWN AWAY!  These are very, very good and a nice change from the usual Christmas cookies!  I burned my first batch but we still ate all of them!  The unburned batch was given out to our neighbors and I think they'll love them.  As others mentioned, we didn't bother with the icing.  They really are perfect without it!    I'll make these every year!  And our daughter totally loved them!

i didn't add any vanilla extract at first and thought they tasted off (more floury taste) next batch i added the vanilla extract and they tasted much better... so make sure you do add the vanilla extract

This is a wonderful holiday cookie.  I made this recipe as written.  If you are dribbling the frosting, you can cut that in 1/2.  I think that cranberry juice as an alternative to the orange juice would be just as good in the frosting.  It was great!

These cookies were so delicious. The picture attached to this recipe is quite misleading because it does not look at all like how the cookie actually came out.  The cookie comes out a little puffy and is more cake like in texture where as in the picture it looks like it would be chewier and flat.  This is definnitely going to be a must make at the holiday time.  I will definitely be make these again and again!

OMG! Just made these and they are incredible. I did make a few changes. I added 1/2 tsp almond extract. Increased the amount of orange juice (fresh squeeze) to 3 tbs, increased grated orange to about 2 tsp and used 3 cups flour. I didn't have any fresh cranberries so i used craisins. I didn't make the icing since i don't think i need that much sugar in me :) They are just simply amazing. The extra almond extract gave it a nice kick. I already ate 4 and am ready for more :)

Very good cookies!  I used a bag of fresh cranberries and pulsed them in the food processer.  I baked mine at 375 degrees and baked for 12 minutes not a second longer!  For some reason one of the last trays burned at 12 mins.  So the very last tray went in for only 11 minutes and came out perfect.  I think this cookie needs the glaze it gives it that extra pow!  I used the zest from an entire orange in the dough  and just squeezed the juice from the orange into the dough mixture,  I forgot to save some zest for the icing so I just used about 1 tsp of orange extract.

My fiancee discovered he LOVES cranberries so I cooked these up for him Thanksgiving morning.  WONDERFUL cookie.  I left the icing off and the flavor was perfect without it.  The tartness of the cranberry and the sweetness of the orange really complimented each other well. I've now frozen about 2 bags of fresh cranberries to be able to make this again!

Made this recipe Christmas Eve.  This is by far the **best** cookie recipe I have ever tried.  My friends all agree too.  I will make these every year from now on.  Use the bagged cranberries in the produce section of the store.  Chopped in my hand processor.  Very easy.

Wow!! Even my picky 5-year-old loved these, so maybe they could be for kids too!  I swapped the sugar measurements (more brown sugar, less white) because I like a chewier cookie, and I subbed oatmeal for 1 cup of the flour because I was craving that oatmeal cookie texture - delicious. I made these just for fun but they would make a wonderful Christmas cookie.

I loved these cookies, as did pretty much everyone else who had them. Reminded me so much of cranberry-orange bread. My only "problem" with them was I don't think I let them cool long enough with and without the icing 'cause they stuck to the wax paper I put them on. Oh well.

Will definitely make these again.

I've made these a few times and they are a hit. I just use crasins -- no extra water, no liquor, no problem. I don't add the nuts (too many people with allergies) and I've done the glaze but I think that makes them too sweet. I might follow suggestions to cut the sugar a tad -- it does end up a little "grainy"

I'd have to say the best cookie EVER.  Buttery rich and sinfully delicious.  I didn't change a thing, but I didn't add any nuts because I don't care for them.  These are made every Christmas and are gone by Christmas Eve.

A very nice, light alternative to all the heavy iced sugar and chocolate cookies at the holidays! Went over very well with both genders and various ages.

I followed this pretty much exactly, except that I added a little extra orange zest to the batter (1 1/2 tsp) and added a little more flour (1/4 cup) as some reviews advised. I also used fresh cranberries, pulsed in the food processor, and about a tsp of vanilla. 

DO NOT add more flour if you're not at a high altitude. Yes, the batter will look a little greasy, but it'll be fine. More flour makes it taste, well, floury. 

They're right about overcooking, though. This is a light cookie, almost cake-like. As soon as the edges turn brown, take them out. 

Also, if you really want 4 dozen cookies out of this, forget "rounded tablespoon" size. Try a big rounded teaspoon - about walnut size. They cook better and more evenly and they're still plenty big. 

I didn't do the frosting, but might next time. I don't like super-sweet cookies, but these aren't anywhere near super-sweet. They're tangy and light and very good.

These were very good...took everyone's advice and added 1/2 cup more flour plus 1/2 tsp almond extract along with the egg. I also reduced the amount of white sugar from 1 cup to 3/4. Used slivered almonds for the nuts, but will probably use toasted walnuts or pecans next time I make them for more flavor - and there will definitely be a next time! Good recipe!!! Adding it to my Christmas cookie arsenal! :)

Followed the recipe as is and came out just fine.  Nice blend of cranberries and orange.  For my preference, I would make the sugar mixture to drizzle over my cookies although some reviewers were okay without it.  It helped balance out the tartness of the cranberries.

Spectacular cookies. WOW, such amazing flavors. 

I used the juice of one whole orange (for the batter and icing) and all of the zest from the orange, using most for the batter and about a half teaspoon for the icing. Otherwise, I followed the directions, cooked about 12-13 minutes until browned and put them on a cooling rack--came out perfect. Didn't really need the icing, but it's tasty too. Also tried adding dark chocolate chips to a fourth of the batter--they still tasted good but the original flavors by themselves were AMAZING just as they were..

Delicious! The glaze really puts these over the top. I added a bit more orange zest to both the cookie and glaze, but I am an orange zest fan. Also, I had orange extract at home so I put just a titch in. They really were so good. I took them to a party and everyone wanted the recipe. They were a huge hit with my family too!

I made these yesterday and might I say that the dough was delicious, the baked cookies were delicious and the frosting was delicious. I frosted some and left others plain. Other than using Craisins I followed the recipe to a "T". Very good recipe. Will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.  And easy. I had all the ingredients on hand. Very easy and accessible recipe.

Fantastic, delicious, and surprisingly easy! I would have liked them a little looser, so next time I will probably use a tiny bit less flour. The only other modification I made was to add some cardamon. These are amazing cookies! I wanted to eat them all!

OMG !!!  These are soo freakin' good!  I was making these for my dfaughter before she returned from work.  What can I say, I left her a couple!  Made no changes to the recipe, except a smaller portion/batch (my mistake).  These are definately a homerun and will be added to my recipe box.

Holy cow, Holy cow, HOLY COW!  Made these for a couokie exchange this weekend, they may not make it there!  Good thing I have enough of everything to make another batch! I used just a splash of orange extract, because my oranges weren't  very vibrant, but otherwise left everything the same, used fresh cranberries. Haven't even made the glaze yet, and half are gone! Used my food chopper (you know the slap chop thing) to chop the cranberries and it worked great.  Loved these will be part of my rotation!  Thanks for posting!

Fabulous, yummy AND easy!  More orange zest is needed, I used 3tsp and thought I would use more next time.  I used the juice from the orange I zested  and that worked great.  Add more zest to the glaze as well. I used dried craisins for this batch and I don't think I'd ever bother with fresh cranberries.  Everyone from my 2 year old all the way to grandpa LOVED these cookies!

Very good.  I did take other reviewers advice and increased the flour by 1/2 cup.  I also used orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice, and increased the amount of zest in the cookies and icing.  I'm really glad I did this, because the orange flavor was still quite subtle.

So yummy! I know lots of people skipped the frosting but I think it adds a lot, especially if your cranberries make the cookie a little tart. I added a little almond extract like others recommended. They turned out beautifully. Next time I think I will bake them at 350 since they seemed to get a little overdone if I did not take them out a few minutes early at 375 for me.

Great flavor. Easy to make. Instead of fresh cranberries, I chopped a cup and a half of craisins and through them in. The glaze adds a nice sweetness to the cookie. I might cook for only 10 min next time, as I like my cookie more on the chewy side.

Amazing cookies!  My family loves when they are still soft the next day, so this was perfect for us.  They were great the first time I made them according to the recipe and I was telling my class about how good they were and decided to make them again that night for them!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and they were even better.  My class of 4th graders thought they were delicious also.  Thank you for a new favorite!!!

These were pretty good. My family loved them.  I did add some almond extract to the icing to bring out some of the flavor and next time (and there will be a next time) I will try adding some almond or vanilla extract to the cookies too.

I made these cookies and they everyone loved them.  They definitely taste better on day two after all the flavors have had a chance to blossom.  The first time I made them, I felt like the cookie alone didn't have enough orange flavor, so I doubled the orange zest the second time around.  It definitely made for a tastier cookie.  The walnuts also really enhance the cookie and flavorings.  (I made them once without and once with).    Be careful not to over do it on icing.  I quick drizzling slung across the cookie from a pastry bag is all it needs.  Otherwise it's a sweet overload and the cookie is overpowered.    Great cookie!

These were enjoyable.  Made them over the holidays.  I was going to try and use fresh cranberries and then chickened out after tasting how tart they were, I was a little unsure how they would be because I've never used fresh always dried.  I had some dried cherries on hand so I used those.  I liked them as did several guests, I think the orange flavor might not be for everyone.

I can't explain how good these are!!! I created this account just so I can tell everybody. I'm typing with my pinkies because I just finished glazing them(not mentioning eating them as well). So yummy! Freezes well, just thaw for 2-3 hours. I improvised and used clementine juice and zest for the glaze due to the lack of orange in my house, still turned out well. It does look AMAZING!

YUM! These were soooo good! I used 1 1/3 cup craisins rehydrated overnight in 1/2 to 1 cup fresh squeezed oj.  I also used 1 cup pecans instead of walnuts.   And instead of the glaze I drizzled with melted white chocolate. I needed them to be firm on top so I could stack & ship them & the hardened white chocolate did the trick.  They were beautiful!

These were incredible and easy to make. I used the fresh cranberries and cut them in half. I also used orange juice concentrate instead of just orange juice because I had a can out for another cookie recipe. We normally do not prefer icing on cookies, but it helped balance out the sweet and the bitter cranberries. Incredible!

These cookies were a major Christmas hit!  I made them for 4 different parties and received rave reviews at each of them.  I really wanted the orange flavor to pop, so I used half orange-flavored dried cranberries (from Henry's Farmer's Market) and half Craisins for the cranberry portion, and used a tad more orange zest than the recipe called for.  For the glaze, I used more orange juice and zest.  As other reviewers suggested, I placed the glaze in a Ziploc bag w/ the corner cut off and zig-zagged the glaze onto the cookies.  I made the cookie dough in advance and refrigerated it, so I could just bake-and-go on party days.  Thanks for the recipe...I will definitely make these again and again!

Totally followed the recipe but the cookies turn out flat in shape. No idea why this is the case. I like the tangy taste of the orange. Probably would cut back on the sugar as it is too sweet for my liking.

A very good cookie, although I made some changes to the recipe. First, I doubled the amount of orange zest. I also substituted the walnuts for almonds and added a splash of almond extract. I think the almonds compliment the carnberries better. I also found reducing the temperature to 350 made for a tastier, chewier cookie.

This recipe has to be one of the best cookie recipes I have ever made (outside of one involving chocolate or peanut butter). the only thing I did different was added about a half a bag of white chocolate chips to the recipe with the nuts and cranberries, and added about a cup of melted white chips to the frosting recipe. It got rave reviews from my co-workers (I even got a hug from one girl)I will keep this recipe for sure.

I made this because I had most of the ingredients on hand, except the walnuts which I substituted for chopped almonds.  I also used Craisins (dried cranberries).  I added a bit more orange zest than it called for.  They taste quite good, but at work where I sell cookies I've had to try to convince people to try them. This is not the recipe's fault, but I can't give this recipe 5 stars when I have to beg people to try them.  The good news is, people who try them really like them.

Used margarine instead of shortening, dried cranberries, and chilled in the fridge over night. They came out perfect! Chilling is the key. I didn't change any of the measurements except for a bit more orange zest =). These are hard to mess up and they're soooo good!

I thought these would be too tart with all of the cranberries (it DID look like there was a ton) but they actually turned out OK. The cookie dough actually is quite 'melt in your mouth' and the lemon and cranberry flavors go very nicely together. I think the glaze helped this cookie along a bit, but it was a very pretty addition to my holiday rotation.

These cookies are absolutely delish!  I couldn't believe how fool-proof the recipe was.  I cut down on the baking time (took 8-9 minutes till they were done) and added the icing.  I can't wait to make additional batches for Christmas!  (Note: I make larger cookies, so the recipe only yielded 3 dozen for me.)

Delicious cookie. Sweet and tart at the same time. I didn't add the icing as they tasted great without it. Definetly a hit this holiday.

Followed directions as written but found they stuck to the ungreased cookie sheet. Those I could scrape off were too soft & fell apart & tasted like flour & butter. Will not repeat. I do not understand the 4.5 star rating

The taste was good with the combination of orange and cranberry but I didn't like the texture of the cookie.  Mine also kind of spread out while cooking and the cookie was very soft almost cake like.  I had trouble picking them up without them wanting to fall apart.  I am going to try to find a recipe with cranberry, orange and oatmeal.  I think the texture will be a lot better. I used the almond extract like another reviewer suggested and I thought it was overpowering the orange zest so I added all the zest from one orange.  If I were to make this again, I wouldn't use the almond extract.  The flavor was good but the rest, eh!

These were perfectly yummy! An excellent addition to the Christmas cookie collection. I went a little heavy on the orange zest and took the advice of another reviewer of cooking them at 350° rather than 375°. At 375, they were starting to brown but were undercooked in the middle. At 350, they came out perfect at 12 mins.

Loved these. Nice, soft, tart cookie. Absolutely needs fresh cranberries versus craisins. Using others recommendations, I did cut back a bit on the sugar, added about 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 tsp of almond extract.

I read many, many reviews before baking these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are a true culinary delight.  I did make sure my teaspoon of zest was packed in good and tight.  I think they need the 375 degree oven to soften up the cranberries.  I used fresh cranberries which if in season I highly recommend.  The next time I make these I may add almond but I won't rate the cookie with the almond because it is not the same cookie!!! That's for all you chef's out there that make your own recipe then rate the one you didn't make!  Also, my cookies did not come out flat but nicely unison and beautiful. I used a small melon ball scoop and made sure to pack and scrape on side of bowl to make flat on one end.

11.17.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/40180/cranberry-orange-cookies/ ... Ooops, only added 1c cranberries. Too sweet. Maybe using 2c, that would partially be corrected; but I don't think completely. The last tray, I added some white chocolate chips & they were way too sweet, but I could tell the combination would be fabulous with less sugar in the cookie itself.  Reminds of blueberry drop cookies somewhat.  I used 1/2c margarine & 1/4c shortening. Think 1/2c whatever fat is probably enough.  They don't spread crazy, but they're flat.  OR, & this is probably the better choice than using less fat, add more flour.  That would bulk it up to not spread & would lessen the sugar factor.  For juice & zest, I subbed 2T frozen oj concentrate.  Forgot to add the 1/2t almond extract suggested - next time!   Mine done in 14.  I liked these & was pleasantly surprised that cranberries would cook that fast.  I was a doubter.  :)

Soft and chewy.  Sweet but tart.  I loved these.  I substituted the walnuts with chopped pecans and I used the icing sparingly and will probably use more cranberries next time but these are great cookies.  What a tasty way to use cranberries!

This is the best recipe ever! I don't put in the nuts, but otherwise make it exact. These are so good, especially at Christmas.

Wow, these cookies are so amazing!  I did cheat and used dried cranberries but got the juiciest dried fruits I can find which was at Trader Joes.  I also used 3/4 of butter and I did not drizzle my cookies because the dried cranberries were sweet.

After making these I noticed that I had accidentally used bread flour(!), so I just called them "scones". Regardless, these are refreshing and attractive. So festive looking for Christmas. I did add the extra half cup of flour that so many reviewers recommended and am glad I did. The dough was still somewhat sticky. I also baked them at 350 instead of 375. I grated the zest of an entire orange and squeezed extra juice in, adding a little bit of almond extract as well. I shaped them into one ounce balls (got 40 this way)and froze the dough so I could pull them out and bake up just enough to enjoy at a time. I did add the glaze-just a touch. The fresh cranberries are delicious in these; the tartness is perfect against the sweet cookie. My boyfriend also liked them. Can't wait to share them with others (and try them with the right kind of flour)! Thanks!

Taste-wise, these are very good. I made one tray according to the recipe (except I added 1/4 tsp almond extract and used the walnuts), then added bittersweet chocolate chips to the remaining dough. I liked the ones with choc chips better :) But the texture is VERY cake-like, not at all like a cookie - and don't store them in an airtight container or they start to go mushy! I didn't bother with the glaze as they didn't seem to need it. I'll probably make them again but play with the ingredients to get better texture (like adding more flour as other reviewer suggested).

I am nearly finished making these cookies and they are delicious.  I read other reviews and added an extra half cup of flour, 1tsp of vanilla and the zest of one medium size orange along with an extra 2tsp of the orange juice from the orange. I used fresh cranberries and used the whole bag which is approximately 2 1/2 cups. The next time I make them I'm going to increase the walnuts to 1 cup as some of the cookies didn't have any in them. This recipe is definitely being saved in my recipe box.

I have made these a few times and these are so amazing.  Of course I am a fan of anything that has a citrus flavor to it.  The cranberries add a nice touch.  This is definitely a go to cookie recipe if you want a break from the traditional cookies.  Will keep for the future.

Added dark chocolate chips (chocolate, cranberry and orange...yum!)and did not use glaze.  Great just after they cooled but my husband and I both thought that the consistency changed within hours to a more soft, cake-like cookie.  Found that they were a little better if kept refrigerated.  Excellent flavor - just an odd change of consistency.

Ive made these twice now and I always get rave reviews on them. I dont change it by much. I think i add a bit more orange juice to the icing recipe bec it comes out so thick but other than that, this is a perfect recipe. The first time i made them i used fresh cranberries but the second time cranberries were not available so I used dried. Both options are great. The dried result in chewier cookies.

These cookies are as beautiful as they are delicious!! I used shaved almonds b/c I had them on hand & they didn't add anything at all. I will try the walnuts next time or just skip the nuts completely. But, still - amazing!! Cookies are great, glaze is really great! Fantastic in all ways!

These cookies made me famous after the last holidays.  I decided to bake for family/friends instead buying presents... and guess what!?!  It took me less time i guess, and everyone fell in love with the cookies.  
I need to say that I am a complete begginer in this art... so it amazed me the simplicity of this recipe. 
The first batch lasted minutes in a 5 people household... and since them I've done it about 20 times for everyone. 
KIDS VERSION: no cranberries.  It amazed me too to notice that they are tasty as well without the cranberry touch... which my girls don't like. 

The bad part... I just made this recipe MINE!! And wont tell anybody I found it here!! ;)

Pretty good. I soaked my dried cranberries for an hour, then drained. I also used all rapadura sugar (not white/brown) and did 1/3 whole wheat.

I'm always looking for new recipes for cookies, as an after school snack for my 2 Grandsons, and this one is a keeper for sure. They loved them, as did my husband and I. Have used raisins when out of cranberries, made with and w/o nuts or glaze...they always come out wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing a real 'keeper'!

These cookies are amazing!  Interesting my 7 year old son who doesn't like most cookies gobbles these up and my 21 month old loves them too!  They do not need icing added extra zest and 2 1/2 cups of dried cranberries!  No one in my family can stop eating them!  You will not be disappointed in these.

I usually read the reviews first and add some of their comments into my cooking, so I didn't think twice about adding a dash of vanilla and half a cup more of flour.  The vanilla was great, but the flour caused me to have puffy, dense cookies. I used dried cranberries because that's what I had, and they still lend a great flavor.  I like the glaze, I added 1/8 tsp of ground ginger to it, it added a really yummy interesting twist to the taste of the cookie!

I loved this recipe all the cookies were gone in two days, The frosting is really the icing on the "cookie". I used fresh cranberries that I chopped using a food processor and they were perfect. I have added this to my holiday cookie collection.

I gave this 4 stars because they cookies turned out very cakey. Not at all cookie-like. The only thing I changed in the recipe was to change the temperature (down to 350F, as someone had recommended) and added some almonds. I think the problem might be in the amount of cranberries. "2 cups chopped cranberries" is 2 cups cranberries after they have been chopped, but "2 cups cranberries, chopped" is a very different amount. I wonder if the recipe is calling for the latter but is written incorrectly. 

As for taste, I have to disagree with the "too sweet" claims. I tried the cookies without the glaze, and (especially with the cake-like texture), it tasted just like cranberry orange bread. Too tart for a cookie. The glaze (when added in moderation, such as the picture above, not slathered all over it like a sugar cookie) adds just the right amount of sweet to make it a cookie. Just wish the texture was better. I will definitely make these again, although I will try to tweak it next time. These cookies are much easier to make than the cranberry orange pinwheels we usually make every Christmas.

These cookies are heavenly.  I tried these for the first time this holiday season and did not change a thing!  Perfect as written!  Tastes like I am eating a cran-orange scone from whole foods!

These were quite possibly the BEST cookies I have ever had!  I was so impressed!  Everyone that tried them absolutely loved them!

The only thing I changed was to add a little more orange zest and juice into the cookie dough.  I didn't have any confectioners sugar either so I made an orange sugar glaze and brushed over the top of the cookie.  They were awesome!

Thanks so much for the recipe!

Delightful surprise!  Splendid cookies with a slight crunch that tastes similar to cranberry bread...yummy!
Used fresh cranberries and pineapple juice.

Oh my goodness, these are so good!  I chopped (by pulsing several times) up one 12oz bag of fresh cranberries in the food processor and then added about 1/4 cup of sugar and tossed with the cranberry pieces.  I measured out a good 2 cups of the cranberries and had just a little left over.  Made the rest as written, using walnuts (a little more than 1/2 cup).  The glaze is spot-on to add just that bit of sweetness it needs.  My very picky hubby said these were a winner!  Now that's saying something!!!

Great cookie.... the orange flavor is so present. My came out on the sweet side, next time I will use less sugar. Other than that, they are so good. Even my mom loved them... definitely will make them again..

These were delicious! I didn't add the walnuts, but I think I might try it next time just to cut the overall sweet/tart flavor of the cookie.

They had a great flavor, but they are a bit too soft for me. Soft cookies usually end up soggy after a day. The icing is essential- otherwise it is a bit tart.

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've found in a long time. I'm a huge fan of cranberry orange anything so this was definitely right up my alley. They came out super moist and absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was substituting Splenda and the Splenda brown sugar blend and I did not top it with the icing. :-)

I love these cookies!  I divided the batter into 3-did one batch with just cranberries, one batch with cranberries and walnuts and the third batch with cranberries, walnuts and chocolate chips.  I actually like the cookies w/ the cranberries and walnuts the best.  Definitely making the cut for the cookie swap!

These are delicious!  I made these cookies for Christmas last year, gave some as gifts along with other cookies in a tin.  Also had some out on a platter for Christmas Eve and my family raved about them.  My dad couldn't stop eating them!  These are a fantastic cookie and a nice change from the Chocolate Chip cookies I always make.  I will be making these again this Christmas, and every one after it! Thanks for posting this!

First time I've made these and they are certain to become a regular in my cookie baking rotation!  They turned out quite cakey and fluffy which is exactly what I was hoping for.  I only slightly changed the recipe by cutting back to 3/4 cup of white sugar, more zest, 3 tbsp. juice from the actual orange, no walnuts and I cut the cranberries to 1 cup and chopped them very fine in my 'magic bullet' so that my kids would like them more... don't think they'd like the big chunks of cranberry but with them chopped so fine they barely noticed them and they were a hit.  They didn't spread very much so I found the best was to shape them into balls and then flatten them about half way down.  I had no trouble with the amount of flour as listed.  The glaze makes them very attractive but really isn't needed to add any flavour.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Absolutley a 5 star cookie!!  I didn't have any fresh cranberries so used dried instead....cookies turned out just as good.  For something different and a bit more festive, I melted white chocolate and added finely grated orange rind, then drizzled this over the cookies...INSANELY good!!!

I tried this recipe twice and the results are fantastic. It keeps pretty well too...and somewhat ended up tasting like shortbread....nice and delicious buttery taste. My colleagues couldn't get enough of the cookies!!!! I added some chopped pecans into this recipe.

I like to make cranberry orange scones at the Holiday's (a great recipe I got from this site!) but stumbled on this recipe and decided to give it a try. I thought they were delicious and very easy to make. I didn't make the frosting but thought it was fine without. Definitely a dessert for adults and not children (the non-picky adults - husband didn't care for cranberries). My kids didn't love them.

I didn't like them :( I used frozen cranberries and they tasted really bitter in the cookies (maybe I should of coated them with powdered sugar first). I felt the cookies needed more sugar and I had trouble making the glaze. I give them three stars because my other family members really liked them. It's an acquired taste I suppose.

Very delicate texture and they just melt in your mouth. Has a great flavor with a lot of different things that come at you.  I found the kids didn't care for them at all, but the adults liked them pretty well.  I can see them being ideal for work or church gatherings.  CHANGES: Pecans instead of walnuts. Next time I will chill the dough for a while due to some thinning during baking.  I always like to give the original recipe a chance before I adjust.

Really really good cookies!  Going to try them with macadamia nuts.  1 1/2 cups of cranberries is plenty for our taste, and I don't use the glaze.  Excellent!

Well, I read all 400+ reviews, and mine isn't going to reveal anything new, but I will confirm others' experiences and how I followed many of their suggestions. Overall, I think these are just lovely cookies--in terms of how they look, their soft texture, and their wonderful, Christmas-y flavors! I would definitely include these on any Christmas cookie tray or in any cookie exchange.    I do think they are a little on the sweet side, so I might try pulling back on the white sugar by a half cup next time.  And I doubled the orange zest in both the dough and the glaze, and I thought the cookies ended up with a very pronounced orange flavor. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the dough. I used pecans instead of walnuts, though I think either would be good.   I used a regular cookie scoop and got 42 cookies (3 1/2, not 4 dozen), and I baked them for 13 minutes at 350 degrees, and they came out perfectly done. I also had plenty of glaze to do all the cookies with some left over (using the snipped baggie trick). You really don't want to overdo it with the glaze, because they are plenty sweet as it is!  Bottom line, this recipe is a winner!

Fabulous grown-up cookies that my husband won't leave alone. Tart, flavorful and a lovely texture. I didn't add the frosting, it wasn't missed. Fresh orange juice, plenty of zest and fresh cranberries makes these cookies special.

Wonderful holiday cookie.  I had a hard time getting them off the pan, even after cooling for several minutes.  By the second batch I figured out that lightly greasing the cookie sheet makes a big difference -- no crumbling upon removal!  In my opinion, frosting is optional as the cookies taste great even without it.  Thanks for sharing.

OMG! These are fantastic so delicious the orange and cranberry go perfect.  I baked these cookies at 350 for 11min and they were perfect.  I also pressed them down with a fork before baking so they would be flat as opposed to thick.

Super easy and delicious. My kids like them! I used cherry-flavored Craisins because its what I had on hand. Followed recipe to a T, including the frosting...but I just drizzled it like in the picture. Yum! Nice to have a pretty holiday cookie that doesn't require a refrigeration step or lots of time.

Made these as one of 5 assorted cookies I give as gifts. They were my "new flavor". These were the most commented on this year. They are buttery and perfectly sweet. The only changes for me were adding a teaspoon of vanilla (out of habit, really), and using craisins, equal measure. They are delish! This recipe is a keeper.

These were cakey, but very good. I did like them without the icing, but thought they were better with it.  I used more zest in both the batter and the icing and they were just right.

These cookies are great!!  They have officially made it onto the annual Christmas Cookie List.  They are a bit soft, but I like them that way.  I added the zest of the whole orange as I like they extra "zing".  I also used an uce cream scoup and they turned out great and were not flat at all!!

Wow these are great! I made them as is with fresh cranberries cut in half. I also just squeezed the orange I zested for the orange juice.  I think they are a nice change of pace from the over-sweet cookie and don't think they need the extra sugar drizzle on top. They are wonderful, tart, and slightly sweet without. However, a little extra drizzle of sugar was fine too.

These are so quick and easy to throw together and turned out great. I only had Christmas oranges so because they didn't have a strong orange flavour I decided to add 1 tsp of lemon extract and used dried cranberries since I didn't have any fresh. Yum!

It's definitely a keeper!  I agree with others, make 2 batches.  One dozen was gone before the kitchen was cleaned up.  Hint - Unless you have a more efficient way of chopping up the fresh cranberries, I suggest you do this the day before. Cutting them into quarters with a knife....all 300 of them.....took me about an hour.  The tartness of the cranberries counter balances the sweetness of the frosting to make a cookie that you just cannot eat one of!  I'll make them again next year!

Got rave reviews from my "taste testing panel" here at work. I used probably 2 tsp. of orange zest just because I had that much and didn't want to waste it. I also used pecans because I had them on hand already. I would suggest doubling the frosting recipe as I had a dozen cookies without frosting.

Fabulous! Just fabulous! I added about a half cup more of flour and used craisens. The drizzle is a nice touch, but not necessary. These are a must for the holiday season. ENJOY!

Wonderful flavor and presentation great!  I took a reviewers recommendation and used 1/2 tsp. almond extract and chopped slivered almonds.  Used 1 1/2 tsp. of zest and fresh cranberries.  Didn't bother with the icing.  Outstanding!

I made these for a cookie exchange and loved how easily they turned out great! I only made 3 batches and I had well over the 10 dozen that I needed. The only thing I changed was the amount of cranberries used. I only used 1 Cup of chopped cranberries and that was certainly enough. Also, I modified the glaze a little and used orange juice concentrate straight from the can. I needed to add a little water to get the consistency right, but the colour and the flavour was much sharper.

Maybe I just have bad cookie-baking karma, but these cookies were a disappointment. Another reviewer said hers needed more flour than the recipe calls for. I agree. Mine spread quite a bit and turned out really flat. They were over buttery, almost greasy, and needed a stronger orange flavor. I did do one thing different, I used dried cranberries instead of fresh. Maybe they'll improve when fully cool and iced. They taste like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate.

I made six or seven different cookies last year during the holidays and this one was everyone's favorite.  It looks as good as it tastes and it keeps for quite a while in a sealed container, if you need it to do so. It is the quintessential Christmas cookie in my opinion.

I made these last year as gifts for my neighbors. They went over very well. My brother said it is his new favorite cookie. I did find the frosting a bit on the runny side and added a bit more 10x suger. I used a baggie with a tiny hole cute in the corner to drizzle the cookies. They looked good and tasted even better!

Mine did not turn out flat like the picture but more 'rustic' looking.  They taste great though and I didn't change a thing from the original recipe....why change a good, simple thing?  Thanks!  Bringing them to a bridal shower tomorrow!

10/5/10 Fabulous, just the way they are. I zested two oranges to get enough orange zest for the recipe and the juice from both of them was enough for the recipe. Followed the recipe exactly. I also tried baking them at 300 to ensure they kept their shape but it took to long, about 25 minutes, and was unecessary.

Quite possibly the best non-chocolate cookie ever. I used the almond extract (1/2 tsp.) as suggested by others. I also made some substitutions, according to what I had in the cupboard: 1/2 Cup Smart Balance and 1/2 Cup Spectrum Naturals Shortening instead of butter, dried orange peel instead of zest, and Craisins instead of fresh cranberries. No icing. Delicious! I can't wait to try them with fresh cranberries...

Not your average cookie!  The combination of cranberry and orange flavors makes these cookies slightly tangy.  A nice change from a strictly sweet cookie.  I have made these cookies at Christmas for the past few years and am often asked for the recipe.

These are pretty good cookies, but I was a bit underwhelmed by the orange flavor.  I doubled the zest, but maybe next time I'll triple it.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine only because that is what I had.  I did not add the nuts since I don't like them, but added white chocolate chips instead.  And I used Craisins (not chopped).  The cookies came out in texture and appearance just like a chocolate chip cookie (flat and chewy), but maybe it is because I used both baking soda and baking powder.  The recipe doesn't call for the baking powder, but out of habit I used an equal amount of both.  I also only baked them for 7 minutes, so that may have made a difference also.  I didn't make the icing since I used the Craisins and white chocolate chips.  I might consider making it anyway next time just to intensify the orange flavor.  Overall though, a very tasty cookie!

WOW!!  What a delicious combination of tart and sweet.  The cranberries add just the right amount of tartness and the glaze is a must to add just the right amount of sweetness.  I made these for a cookies exchange last holiday season and they were very well received. Will definitely be in the cookie rotation when fresh cranberries are in season.

These were pretty good. They taste just like a orange/cran muffin you would get at dunkin (just in cookie form). I used dried sweetened crans because that is all I had. Never bothered chopping them. Turned out fine.

A different cookie.  I used 1/4 cup less white sugar, did not pack the brown sugar, and did not use icing, and still, these were super sweet.  Next time I will definitely try using only 1/2 cup of sugar for more of a tea time cookie.

These are one of the best cookies I have ever had. They taste just like an orange cranberry scone that I have become addicted to but much easier to make. I made them just as the recipe stated except for I used 1 1/2 tsp of orange zest as others said. I cooked them for 14 minutes and they were great.

I saw the recipe and have been dying to make it. I finally did tonight and they are the best cookies I've ever had. It's the perfect blend of the cranberry and orange. Simply delicious and refreshing. Wouldn't change a thing. Don't need the glaze, perfect without it.

These were delicious, I made them without nuts. I think they were probably better with the nuts. Hit and miss with the audience. My mother wanted bigger pices of cranberry.

A wonderful addition to the Christmas goodies I sent to collegues! I love cranberry orange bread--using the combination in cookies is just as tasty. Adapting slightly to what I had on hand, this recipe turned out fabulous. I used grapefruit zest in place of orange zest, and used fresh, chopped cranberries for a FRESH burst of cranberry flavor that craisins just do not provide. I omitted the icing for easier shipping (didn't have enough time to putter around with icing that might make a mess if not dried properly). --This recipe is a keeper!

These cookies were very tasty, although I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used Craisins and added white chocolate chips to the batter. I used orange extract instead of orange juice and orange zest.

Absolutely incredible. The only change I made was to create a thicker icing (so they iced with a knife rather than drizzle); and according to all five who were served, this is "one incredible cookie." As an added touch, I placed three or four dried cranberries in the center of the iced cookie, and they looked stunningly beautiful.

Loved these cookies! We had to freeze them to stop from eating them all! I used frozen cranberries which I defrosted then chopped. I didn't feel the need for the icing because they were just perfect without it. They are a soft, almost cake like cookie - not what I expected, but very good!

I agree with everyone who raves about these cookies. They're terrific. The one mistake I made was to put too much frostingon them. I ran out. Next time I'll either drizzle (not spread) the frosting or make one and one-half the recipe for the frosting. Even without the frosting they're divine.

Wow, wow, wow - that sums it up!  These are probably the best cookies I have ever had/made.  I added about 1/4 cup extra flour over what the recipe called for and although I thought the dough was a bit on the dry side, the cookies turned out perfectly and spread just enough.  Don't know what other people are talking about when they say that their cookies spread all over the pan, mine barely expanded at all.  Baked them for exactly 12 mins at 375 and they are slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside - perfection! I should add that I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract and I used Oceanspray Craisins as well.  I don't find the cookies too sweet at all with the glaze.  As for whether the cookies flattened out during baking, mine didn't flatten at all, they actually came out like thick, fluffy cookies, which I preferred.  I think part of the trick is to not let your butter get too soft before using it in the mix (certainly don't melt the butter as this will cause the cookies to flatten for sure).

I modified the recipe based on reader reviews. Instead of using 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter crisco and 1/2 cup butter. No need for extra flour! I increased the orange zest to 2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp vanilla (I didn't have almond or would have used that). Also, I didn't use the icing. The cookies were sweet enough.  Oh yea, and instead of cranberries, I used Oceanspray Craisins.

These are the best cookies I have ever made. I brought these to an office food day last year, and I recieved the following comment "I am going to slap your mother these are so good!!". I highly recommend this recipe. I do recomment doing small drops for the cookies as the cookies stay more moist, and hold the flavors better.

These were awesome! So so delicious! The only thing I did differently was to add some vanilla extract and they came out perfect! Next time I make them I will either add white chocolate chips into the mix or melt some down and drizzle it over the cooled cookies! You have to try this one! You won't regret it!

These were great. I made them for my father (the self appointed "Cookie Monster") and they didn't make it to dessert. He just popped open the container and started eating them before dinner! I made them with and without the glaze. Both ways are very good. No changes, these are great just the way they are. I used fresh Navel oranges for the juice rather than the store bought juice. I baked these for 11 minutes and the bottom was browned perfectly with the tops just toasted. These really are the perfect holiday cookies.

LOVE these cookies, can't stop eating them. Followed recipe as is, got a soft center drop type cookie.  Delicious orange flavor. Nice presentation w/glaze, but doesn't need it. Next time, less sugar, & no glaze will do.  Yum!

Perfect cookies for a holiday assortment - a nice counterpoint to all the chocolate goodies that are served.

I couldn't imagine fresh cranberries in a cookie..I thought they would be too tart - but they aren't.

I made the recipe as written except left out the orange zest. I ran short on glaze by "spreading" it on the cookies...maybe "drizzle" would be a better word. Anyhoo the ones without glaze were good too...they would make good tea cookies.

Amazing cookies!!! Even if people did not like cranberries they loved these cookies.  I added 1 tsp almond extract and 1/2 c sliced almonds instead of the walnuts.  Like the other reviews advised, i added about a half cup extra flour.  I thought the cookies tasted perfect out of the oven, so I didnt frost them. Cant wait to make them again!

I made this recipe as noted but it did not turn out at all. i amde it four times till i got it to be what i wanted it to be.  I skipped all the orange zest and orange juice and added orange juice concentrate instead. about 6 oz. I increased the flour to 4 1/2 cups. I made icing with the rest of the can of orange juice concentrate.  I also added a bag of white chocolate chips.  Everyone is begging me to make these. Even the kids love them.

Made them for a cookie swap, what a fab cookie, didn't need the glaze, why mess with a good thing. Hubby loved them, wouldn't stay out of the batter or the cookies. I added about a tsp more of oj and a little more orange zest as I like the bold flavor, turned out perfect! Made 16 dozen of these little pieces of heaven...... what a breeze!

These are surprisingly delicious!  I had to try them after so many good reviews, and wow! A new favourite to add to the Christmas cookie collection.  I like to try at least one new recipe every Christmas, and am disappointed by most ... but these are a definite keeper!  I used frozen cranberries, but as these are a little piddly to chop, I might try cheating with dried ones next time.  The cookie batter is plenty sweet with the unsweetened cranberries, so I'd definitely cut back on the sugar if using Craisins.

Good as the recipe is written.  Second time I used lots of Craisins and extra orange zest.  I think I like that better.  I don't think they need the glaze. Good with or without it.  Good cookies!  I only cook them for 7-8 minutes.  You definitely don't want to overcook these.

Since I was making these for the first time, I decided to halve the recipe. I made some changes and omitted the frosting. I had an orange at home but did not want to juice it so I used orange essence instead. This is what I did -                                   1 cup + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour mixed with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking powder. I creamed 1 stick of butter with 3/4 cup brown sugar. Added 1 egg, zest of 1 orange and 1/2 tsp orange essence. Added the flour+salt+baking soda. And then I added 1 cup of dried cranberries + 1/2 cup of slivered almonds mixed in with 1 tbls of flour. Refregerated this dough for 30 minutes. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes. And a new cookie tradition is born. This is my new favorite cookie. Very yummy, very classy.

EXCEPTIONAL recipe.  I used orange juice concentrate in place of juice as recommended by other reviews.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon cardamom because I love the flavor.  I used the glaze, made with more of the orange juice concentrate and added 2 tablespoons butter.  I drizzled this on the cooled cookies.  I think that these cookies can stand alone without a glaze, however when glazed they really popped out when placed on the cookie platter.  I took these to a cookie exchange so I wanted them to be really pretty. If you make these you will not be sorry!

These are my one of my favorite Holiday cookie recipes!! I love Orange and Cranberry together and this is not only delicious, these cookies are just different enough to really stand out and wrapped in some clear cellophane, they make a beautiful hostess gift. Their is an elegance to these tasty treats. Easy to prepare and so good!! I also use an orange flavored sugar sprinkle instead of the icing a lot of the time.  Lightens the cookie up a bit.  Just Orange zest and sugar does the trick!

Loved this recipe!  I think on of my favorite cookie recipes so far on AR.  Yummy holiday cookie.  One large orange give enough juice and zest called for in recipe.  Chopping the fresh cranberries in the food processer worked great.

I made the recipe as listed and I really loved the cookies.  I later realized that I had used dried cranberries and not fresh.  They were a little chewy (Delicious flavor though), maybe re-hydrating the berries first would have made them easier to chew.  I didn't care for the frosting, thought it was much too sweet.  Would make them again, no frosting needed.

These cakey cookies are wonderful! I put the zest of two oranges in, used fresh cranberries cut in half, and the cookies are very tasty. I didn't glaze them but I don't think it would be too sweet unless you coated them in glaze. Thanks for the post, this recipe is a keeper!

I used 1 1/2 tsp zest, fresh squeezed orange juice, ALMOND extract (it tastes better than the vanilla), and an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  DO NOT skip the icing, even if you just drizzle it on.  The icing makes the cookie complete and complex.

I replaced the cranberries with Craisins.  I added a little extra orange zest but decided the batter wasn't "orange-y" enough, so I added about a half a teaspoon of pure orange extract to kick up the orange flavor a little bit.  It turned out a little flat and not very pretty (which is very important since I'm making it as a Christmas cookie to give away), but it certainly was quite tasty!    I think I may add a little extra flour next time to help make them puffier.

I can think of only one problem with these cookies - they are SO good I won't be able to stay out of them!! Love the sweet/tart combination of orange and cranberry! One of my favorites. I used the food processer to chop the cranberries and my small scoop to portion them onto the cookie sheet. Perfect. Will definitely be a favorite.

I used this cookie recipe for a holiday cookie exchange.  I tried this one b/c of the great reviews.  I am a VERY picky eater and didn't think I'd like them...BUT, I was wrong.  They were delicious!!!  Everyone that had them loved them too.  I didn't bother adding the icing, I just used the cookie without it.  Thanks for posting the recipe, it was wonderful and I will be making them again next year!!

These cookies were amazing!  They were very quick and easy to prepare, and turned out beautifully.  I did a cookie exchange with these cookies and they were GONE before any other cookie.  Great for holiday cooking because of color/taste, will definitly make these again.  Thank you!

Fantastic recipe!  These cookies turned out beautiful and soooo delicious!  I'm not the most experienced cook in the world, so I value a recipe that is straightforward and that actually turns out like it says it will!  Taste, texture and appearance were all perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  These are the best cookies I've made in a long time.  Wonderful sweet-tart combination with the orange and cranberries, and they look pretty too.

Good and tart, and the icing is nice but optional for the cookie.  I used orange oil in lieu of zest, which worked out fine.  Used WW pastry flour for 1/3 of flour, but that seemed to take it a little too far to the soft side, not needed.

I thought this cookie was good, really moist.  I used fresh cranberries, which I think I could have used more.  I also used the juice from an orange and fresh orange zest.  I also think I needed more zest like another viewer said.  I did not use the glaze.  But overall this recipe is a keeper.  It will add an extra touch to my cookie trays this year!

I am known as the Cookie Lady - I give cookies to the UPS guy, the Landfill Guys,  the car dealership staff, the Maintenance guy at work, etc, etc. But I have to say these cookies take top honors. I have gotten a 'Wow !' from everyone. They are a bit labor intensive with chopping the fresh cranberries and grating and juicing the orange,as well as drizzling the glaze,  but so well worth it.
The combination of sweet and tart iswonderful. 
I think I have just found The Perfect Cookie !

I added an extra teaspoon of orange zest and used 5 tablespoons of natural orange juice (straight from the orange) and it did not overwhelm the cookies at all. They were soft and had a mild taste of orange. They were a bit on the sweet side so I would recommend using 3/4 sugar instead of a whole cup.

We had our family Christmas party with best cookie contest. I couldn't win because I was hostess, however they were the hit of the night! I was going to make cranberry white chocolate chip but decided on this recipe instead. I did add the white chocolate chips. Wow! They were perfection!! Thank you for this recipe, it's now a regular

I've made these for a bake sale at church, a cookie exchange, and now just for us, because they're so good.  Considering the reviews, I thought about adding additional flour but the dough was just fine with the amount called for.  The only "modification" I made was to add a bit more orange zest and orange juice.  Just a little more of a good thing.  These are delicious cookies!

This is going to be a long review! I made these for a party so I figured I’d read the comments and make adjustments instead of first trying the recipe as is. Most of the suggestions were spot on, but not the additional 1/2 cup flour. This is a temperamental cookie - so things like the pan used, etc will affect them. First the sweetness issue ~ if you use dried cranberries they usually have added sugar. I used 1/4 cup less white and 1/4 less brown sugars but because there were 2 cups of sweetened cranberries in the dough they were still quite sweet - without the glaze. Maybe the amount written works if you use unsweetened dried cranberries? Also I upped the orange zest in both the cookies and glaze - I love citrus so that was a plus. Could’ve also increased the nuts. The suggested 1/2 cup extra flour made these stay round and I had to smash them down near the end so the middle wouldn’t be raw. The rest of the batch I flattened. Bottom line is they were still really good even with the extra flour (without the glaze).

Followed recipe exactly except substituted pecans for walnuts cuz that's what I had....also used fresh, not frozen cranberries.  
These cookies do spread a lot but what I noticed is that when I used a cookie pan (one that has a double layer of aluminum) with a layer of parchment paper, the cookies didn't seem to spread as much as when I used a regular cookie sheet.  Added parchment paper to the regular cookie sheet and that seemed to help a little with the spreading and sticking.
In my opinion, the cookies are so much better the next day as the flavors meld together.  The cookies are more like cake but the flavor is outstanding!  Will make these for Christmas.

 Update: 10/29/15 -  Froze them with icing applied and they freeze incredibly well!  They even taste good frozen....and taste fresh when thawed.  Will make these often.

Update: 11/22/2015:  Just made these again today and made one minor change....added an additional 1/4 cup of flour.  This helped minimize the spreading and worked incredibly well.

The only thing I added to the recipe was a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the dough and a few drops of vanilla extract to the glaze.  They were really good.  My family ate them up quickly.

Very good cookie.  I made a little icing just to try. You really don't need it. I did not want to throw away the icing so i put some on a cookie and then topped it of with roasted almonds. Perfect!!!

WOW! These are now in my top 3 of cookies.  The changes I made were very minor and based on other reviews.  I used an extra tsp of orange zest in the cookie dough.  I also used fresh cranberries, about a cup and a half, and I did not use any walnuts.  I made the icing as is, and it is AMAZING.  I agree with other reviewers, the cookies are great by themselves, BUT the icing puts them over the top. LOVE these.

I tried this recipe and fell in love. I used fresh cranberries that I pulsed in food processor and added white chocolate chips. So for this Christmas season I made 3 batches! Also my daughter loves them which is a high compliment. She doesn't eat cooked fruit at all. She is the reason I have made 3 batches. Whole family agrees it doesn't need the icing.

I recently found this GREAT recipe!  Excellent and delicious.  I did not have enough cranberries, so I replaced the missing cranberries with golden raisins.  I also did NOT use any nuts as these were a get well gift and I wasn't sure about nut allergies.

These Cookies looked great and what I expected, however, I replaced the walnuts with dark chocolate chips and added about 1/4 cup of orange juice and the rind of one full medium orange.. cooked at 425 for 13 minutes on a stone and.. perfect cookies.. crispy outside and tender inside... even my 11 year old liked them and he doesn't like raisins/cranberries so much!.. Thanks!

Tried this recipe and after reading other reviews, decided not to go with that glaze. And they were right it is super sweet on it's own (in a good way). 12 minutes is the perfect amount of time. The only complaint I had was the consistency, it probably would have made better for cupcakes, I would just suggest adding more flour.

Amazing. When I told my boyfriend what I was making he said they sounded terrible, then tasted them and loved them. I didn't make the glaze, sweet enough as is. I also ran out of regular flour so I used a half cup of cake flour and they had a lovey fluffy texture. I'm sure I'll make these often!!

A very tasty cookie. I followed other reviews and added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and baked in a 350 degree oven.  I also added lots of orange zest - like maybe 3 tablespoons - and omitted the glaze. Next time I make these, I will substitute oats for some of the flour. Thanks for an easy, awesome recipe!

Every time I make these delights they come out tasting better and everyone loves them! They run out in minutes! I even made some without the cranberries for my little nephew who doesn't like the texture and they still had a great taste.

Every year I like to try a new cookie recipe and this one did not disappoint.   The taste of cranberries and orange just brings out the holiday cheer.   I like soft cookies and these are a very soft, cake cookie.   In order to get them done, I had to bake them a few minutes longer than suggested.  I’m always afraid of over baking cookies, but because of the cake like texture, this particular cookie is better over baked than under baked.   They will maintain their softness.  I should also note that I used fresh chopped cranberries.  Great addition for a holiday cookie tray.

4.5  Couldn't find fresh cranberries so thawed and drained frozen ones.  Less white sugar and only glazed half of the cookies.  Took them to work and all gone!  :)

@Lovemuffin: you can use either, but I used fresh cranberries. Hope this helps! :-)
For my review, I agree with many others - great cookie with a few tweaks. I also added about 1/2 cup more flour and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Very good cookie and a hit at our neighborhood cookie exchange! I made half with the glaze and half without. Both went equally fast, so I guess it's just a matter of taste.

The cookies were very flat and tasted somewhat greasy. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour because the dough seemed very soft. Fresh-baked, they were not too bad. We didn't even ice them. Next day, though, they were completely soggy and gross. As written, this recipe would probably rate 2 stars, but I'll give it 3 stars for potential. I think it COULD even be a 4-star recipe, with a few tweaks. Maybe increase the flour, cut down on butter by at least 1/4 cup. Maybe use half baking soda and half baking powder, too. I definitely want to try it again someday, because we love anything cranberry.

This is not a bad seasonal cookie. I followed others advice and added a little more flour (I could have even used more because they were very moist/soft and fall apart easy. I also cooked them for 12 minutes at 350 like some suggested and this worked well. I used a chopper to chop up my cranberries so there is a decent amount in every cookie. The recipe for the glaze is way more than needed so cut it in half. I added a little more orange juice to the glaze to give it more flavor. Other than that they turned out nice.

Totally addictingly delicious! I needed to use up leftover cranberries from our "Early Thanksgiving," and found this quick and AWESOME recipe. SO good that I made it twice in the same week! I took the advice of others and used a bit less white sugar, and a little extra flour. I also did not make any frosting, and they were plenty sweet. I used the juice from the same orange I grated, and I added chopped hazelnuts to half of each batch too. I tried the first batch at 350 to be safe, but ended up baking the next batch at 375 and they came out just as good. These are phenomenal, and will definitely definitely DEFINITELY become a regular on my holiday baking list!

The recipe called for 1 c chopped cranberries...I chopped then measured and it seems like too many. Maybe measure out a cup of cranberries then chop would be better.

These are *the best* homemade cookies. Even if you're in the mood for chocolate cookies, these will turn you around. Definitely opt for the walnuts, and the icing isn't necessary. And they keep for longer than the average nonrefridgerated baked goods.

It is a wonderful recipe! I used the zest of whole orange, and substituted one cup of cranberries to one cup of dried apricots. I roughly chopped apricots(in a food processor) into a size of pine nuts(in general, the apricot does not have to be chopped evenly). It gives a jelly-like and chewy texture.

Although I personally didn't care much for these cookies,pretty much everyone who tried them over Christmas raved about them.  So I'll think I will make them again.

This is an excellent cookie. Both the orange and cranberry flavors have some zing to them. Yields more than 60 when using small size scooper. Gets crunchy when cool. No need to put more zest in the icing - easy and perfect without it. The recipe makes much more icing than necessary - don't double if doubling the recipe. Freezes beautifully. Really lovely addition to my holiday baking! Thanks!

This is great - everyone loves them!  You may want to reduce the amount of zest you use - it does have a strong flavor - but very good either way.  Definately top with the drizzle!

These are awesome without the glaze, but the glaze does give a better presentation. I made them with dried cranberries, pulsed in food processor with very small amount of water to rehydrate. They came out GREAT! So, they can be made year round.

This is the best cookie ever! I made it as a Christmas gift for my co-workers 2 years ago for the first time, and since then I didn' t even have a chance to give them anything different: couple of months before xmas I am getting " orders" that they want nothing else but cranberry orange cookies!!!! All my family is in love with them too. As for me, I love anything with cranberry orange combination, but these are the best of all!!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe! P. S. I follow the recipe exactly except for the glaze- i use orange extract for flavor instead of zest and add tiny amount of yellow coloring to make it " pop". It looks very beautiful with golden drizzles...

I just finished baking my first batch of these cookies and they are absolutely fabulous!  They are delightfully sweet with a tart ending...perfectly balanced.  I used a bit more flour and a bit more zest after reading the reviews (just to be safe) and they turned out just right.  I also used a food processor to chop the fresh cranberries which seemed to work great.   These little gems will find their way to the top of my holiday cookie list :)  
Oh, and my 16 year old picky eater approves as well.

Definetly need to use more flour....they spread even after I kept them in the fridge to chill.  Or, instead of 1 cup of butter, next time I will use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine.  I ended up adding 4 total cups of flour.  Also added white chocolate chips to the dough....YUMMO!

Made these last night and my husband (who is NOT a dessert eater...) ate 4 in a row!  They are outstanding!  Followed recipe exactly except added a bit less than 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring.  They puffed up beautifully and were simply amazing!

I absolutely loved this cookie, and usually i done really eat the cookies I make. However, for these i use a whole bag of frozen cranberries which was about 12oz total. To chop them I ran them through the food processor for a second or two.  In addition to that i add a tablespoon of orange zest. These cookies are so fragrant .

I like to try a new cookie every year, I wish I found this one a long ago.  The cookie dough was so good I had to hurry and bake them.  They will be here every Xmas and in between.  They are SSSOOOOOO good.  Thank you.  By the way I really don't usually leave a rating.  You are the first.   Carol

DEEE-lish! Nummy to the tummy! These are DELIGHTful flavors to have this time of year.  The bready part has a more subtle flavor, leaving the sweetness up to the cranberries, the orange and the icing, which I appreciate & in my opinion is what makes a good cookie.

I make these cookies every year.  Sometimes I use craisons - but increase the liquid by 1/4....better with fresh cranberries.  These are my favorite cookies, very light and refreshing and "grown-up"...I also like to think they are good for me!

These are fantastic!  People at work are saying these are the best cookies they have ever had!

Some recommended changes:  use a little extra flour because the cookie spreads, make small cookies, use only a non-stick cookie sheet, go light on the icing if any.

OMGosh, so delicious!!!  I made them exactly how the recipe said, however I made a 1/2 batch and they turned out PERFECT!!!  One side note, I did have to leave them in our oven for an extra 3 minutes (total 17 min).  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I'm not much of a cook/baker, but I'm trying and recipes like this just make it so much more fun.

They are not my favorite cookie, but they were pretty good. There was really nothing to complain about besides that I've tasted better. I might add some extra spices to it if I ever make it again to enhance the flavor.

Amazing cookies!  These are delicious!  We added a small amount of brown sugar to the frosting as we have done with other frostings.  These can be frozen and saved for a later date if needed!  Wonderful- thank you!

I never have oranges on hand so I never use the zest and these cookies still come out fantastic. I love them with the icing, but it's definitely not a must. I've used raw cranberries and dried ones and enjoyed both. My husband, who likes things sweeter, prefers the dried cranberries, but my mother, a lover of all things tart, preferred the raw ones. This was a big hit in the cookie packages I handed out for Christmas this year!

I'm not sure how these got so many great reviews.  I couldn't get people to eat these.  I made them just as directed.  The fresh cranberries were a nice taste, but the cookies spread out until flat.  They were cake-like and crumbly and very unappealing looking.  I did bake mine on a silicone mat.  Maybe that was the problem?

These cookies have been the star of the holiday season at my house.   Everyone loves them.   They might be o-k with craisins and no frosting, but I followed the recipe exactly and will never change a thing.   My husband took a tray of all of my different cookies to the mechanics who service our cars.   The tow truck driver at one of these, said "This is the best darn cookie I ever had," then ate the rest of them without sharing.   I don't blame him.   Thank you, Mordavia.

My kids wanted me to write and say that they loved these cookies.  They are 7 and 11 and obviously have discerning palates (sometimes)!  I substituted macadamia nuts.  These cookies were fantastic!

Absolutely delicious! Highly recommended!!  I did use 3 cups flour as reviewers had recommended below, and I used 1 cup dried cranberries (craisins) that I chopped up a bit more instead of fresh which probably makes a sweeter cookie.  They were done at exactly 12 minutes.  I did end up leaving them on the cookie sheet for about 3 minutes after I took them out of the oven to firm up a bit before moving them.  The glaze was delicious too, and definitely a necesity to complete the cookie.  If you like Starbucks cranberry bliss bars, you'll LOVE these cookies!

The most amazing cookie ever!  I used 3T fresh squeezed orange juice. And I also used 2t of orange zest. These cookies do not need the icing!

These turned out quite good but I think I did something wrong though because they came out a little too soft and fluffy but I couldn't keep them in the oven for longer or else they would have burn. Having said that, the flavor was great and my husband seemed to really like them too. I doubled the organge zest. I also didn't bother with the icing because this was my trial batch.

Love this recipe except it's too sweet, I cut off more than half the sugar, using only brown and black sugar and it's still too sweet, mainly due to the fruits. I added more zest and orange juice to add extra zesty flavors. Otherwise, yummy!!

Great recipe! Received lots of compliments! I like things flavorful so I added extra orange juice and zest. I also added 1 cup white chocochips and left out the nuts and left off the frosting. I aso used 1 cup craisins instead of fresh crans and it worked well! Don't overcook - mine only needed 11-12 min. Will make again!

I made 3 batches to give away as gifts at work. Everyone loved them! Instead of walnuts, which I find bitter, I substituted coursely grounded cashews. Make sure the cookies are completely cooled before glazing them or the glaze will melt. It does set hard though, allowing you to place them together in a bag or stack them. These are a sure hit Christmas time winner!

I have made these cookies a few times over the past few weeks and every time they turned out amazing! The last time I made them it was for a friend who is allergic to nuts, so I substituted the walnuts for Skor toffee bits and they were amazing - I think I liked them just as much if not better!

These cookies are amazing!  I used frozen cranberries.  Cutting was easier.  I love the tart of the berries and sweetness of the icing.  Nice hint of orange.  These will be a regular christmas cookie from now on.

I Loved these cookies, although i found that the dough was very soft, even after refrigerating it for at least 2 hours, next time i would probably out it in the freezer.

I discovered these cookies last year when I put together cookie plates for gifts last year and these are one of the few I chose that I have made many times since because they are so delicious! The only thing that I do is chop the cranberries up into very small pieces so that you can taste them in every bite and I also add double the orange zest for both the cookies themselves as well as the glaze. You won't be disappointed!

all my friends loved the cookies~!!!  I purposely added more orange juice and orange zest and cranberries just to kick up the flavour.  I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and the cookies still tasted GREAT~!!!

Excellent! I made these cookies for a cookie party and they were an instant hit! A much needed and refreshing change from all the other "classic Christmas cookies." I used the juice & zest from an entire orange and cut back on a sugar a bit. Also added a bit of almond extract. This one is a keeper!  Thank you for posting it!

This is a great seasonal cookie! DONT add chocolate chips...LOL. They take away from the tangy sweetness. I forgot to add the egg and ended up adding it after I added the chopped fresh cranberries then I mixed. I liked the flavor. I might add vanilla or one of the other extracts that others have added next time. I am sending some of these to my son overseas. Thanks for helping me use cranberries in a cookie!

Delectable and so simple to make!  These cookies are a keeper.  I saw the 'not really a favorite of the kids' description and wonder if that was a typo because I'm not sure what there is not to like - my girls LOVED them!  Note: mine were pretty soft and chewy, so you have to be a chewy-not-crispy cookie person.

These cookies are super yummy!!  Left out the walnuts, and did use the icing, they were delicious - very buttery and creamy, the orange and cranberry were not over powering at all, complemented it well.  Will definitely make these again.

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  Very simple cookie.  I skipped the topping.  I used craisins.  Wasn't sure if that's what was meant.  They are wonderful, thanks for the recipe and thanks for the 10#'s (just kidding)

These cookies are the best cookies I've ever made.  And I've made lots of cookies!  Chewy and not overly sweet.  Based on the reviews, I opted to skip the frosting and I still loved the cookies. Thank you for a brilliant recipe.

Very good, everyone loved them and I got a lot of requests for the recipe. To get them flatter, press gently with a fork after you roll them out on the pan before baking.

Loved them...they won't be around for very long. I used Craisins instead of fresh chopped cranberries and they were delicious. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla since I wouldn't have the juice from fresh cranberries. I didn't do the icing, but I would if I was preparing them as part of various desserts for the holidays.

This recipe was just wonderful! I put some almond shavings in and used substituted all sugar with brown one to reduce the sweetness. I've made it twice already this week and everybody loves it! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These are the perfect holiday cookie. Nice change from fruitcakes and gingerbread men. When I make them, I replace the walnuts with white chocolate chips.

These turned out great and they were so fun to make! A surprisingly complex flavor of sweetness and tart in a little cookie. I just made a small test batch, but my family loved them and they were gone in no time. I'll definitely make them again, but their flavor I think is more suited to the fall and winter (I'll be sure to make them for Thanksgiving) than the summer, when I tend to prefer lighter, simpler tastes.

I used fresh cranberries and the tartness was great with the sweetness of the cookie.  I felt that they needed the icing with the tart in the cookie.  If you use craisens you probably would not need the icing.  Very good recipe for something different.

these cookies were simple (im a rookie at baking), beautiful and delicious! out of the 12 cookies that i made for family cookie boxes this christmas, these were the unanimous favorite!!! great recipe!  next time, i think i will add some cranberry juice to the cookies and the glaze (maybe half oj/half cran) just to give them a little more cranberry flavor. the walnuts added a great flavor! the cookies wouldn't be any less delicious without them tho, for those who may be allergic.

Excellent!  These cookies had wonderful texture and flavor. There was a nice balance of sweet and tart that makes it hard to stop eating them. I will be making them again and again!  Thanks for a terrific recipe, Mordavia.

OMG these are really good! i can see why everyone says they don't last long. i think i'll consider these in the category of "health food". i did find the glaze a bit too thin, so next time i'll thicken it up. the biggest problem is that cranberries are seasonal, so i bought several bags and tossed them in the freezer. thanks for a great recipe, that will be more than a christmas cookie. just the right blend of sweet and tart.

Wow!  Wow! Wow! oh and did I say WOW!  This was sooo yummy.  I added the almond extract as others suggested, fantastic addition.  This recipe will not disappoint.  Oh, and I didn't add the icing, totally not necessary, the cookie is plenty sweet and flavorful without it.

Delicious cookies! I added a little bit of almond extract and used orange juice concentrate. Husband was skeptical (he doesn't care for much fruit or anything tart like cranberries), but he loved them. My kids (3 year old and 1 year old) also loved them. In fact, everyone who tried them liked them. My only complaint is that they seem just a little bit greasy to me, as I usually make cookies with canola oil rather than butter. I think I may try again substituting 3/4 cup of oil for the cup of butter.

These cookies were by far the best I have ever cooked.  I did reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes as the first batch did get a little too cooked on the bottom, other than that I followed the recipe to the T.  Everyone loved these cookies and placed orders after Christmas.  Thank you Mordavia

I Love these, especially with the orange icing! I used fresh cranberries and the suggested additions (extra orange zest, etc). They remind me of muffins though..not cookies, but still good. i didn't think they were too swet at all, they were just right. They may be a bit too sweet if you use dried cranberries.

These were by far the favorites in the gift tins this year! Tart & sweet and something 'different.' Followed the recipe - I did use 1/2 bag of cranberries right out of the freezer - and made a batch with nuts & a batch with out - both were great.  I will certainly make these again. Thanks for sharing!

A truly phenomenal cookie (and so pretty too)!  Added these to my Christmas baking this year and am really glad I did (hubby raved about them)!  Thought it would be nice to bake  something in without chocolate!  The combination of orange and cranberry is classic and I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract which goes so nicely with these flavours.  Also used about 1 1/2 tsps of orange zest.  Left out the walnuts and used fresh cranberries.  The icing is a must....mmmmm!  Will make these again hands down!

this cookie in fantastic!  I did make one addition to it however.  When adding in the cranberries and nuts, I added about 1 1/2 cups of white chocolate chips. Of course you can them to taste. That just boosted this cookie to one of our families favorites!  This ones a KEEPER!!

A really wonderful, festive cookie.  I've never baked with cranberries before, so I was really happy these turned out completely ace!!  The glaze is definitely a must though.  Without it they were good, with it they're fantastic!

A wonderful holiday cookie!  These are easy to make drop cookies and I don't alter them in any way except for the frosting, which I drizzle on instead of spreading on.  Everyone loves the way that they look and taste.  I made these last year for the first time and again this year.  These are now part of my regular Christmas cookie rotation.

Great cookies. But 12-14 is too long--at least in my oven. My first batch started to burn at 10 mins.

I had some leftover whole cranberries I wanted to use from Thanksgiving. I chopped them in half and added the listed amount. I used more zest than called for (in both the cookie and the icing). These turned out to be my favorite cookie of the season. Not too sweet, a little tange from the berries, stayed mosit for awhile. The orange taste and the cranberry tase really go well together.   try using fresh berries cut in half!

These cookies are gorgeous!  So nice and soft (not chewey though) and colours are pretty.  Used tangerine juice and pecans instead of orange and walnuts as that's what I had at home.  thanks for a great recipe!

Very good cookie.  I did not frost them, but they were delicious without them.  Quite easy too!  Even my picky husband liked them.  I will decorate them and try them that way, too!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very cake-like with a flavour punch from my fresh cranberries. The zest really made them! Definitely a staple recipe for me.

These are a great not too sweet cookie. Being that I have always made cranberry orange bread at christmas and served it with cream cheese spread on it I did not use the glaze and opted to make one with orange juice, powdered sugar and cream cheese.

I loved these cookies! Quick, festive not too sweet! It was such an easy recipe and I only made one change. I used orange flavored cranberries because that is what I had on hand. I think it actually enhanced the orange zest and flavoring. This is a keeper for sure.

These are exceptional in flavor.  Not real sweet, but just sweet enough with the icing on top.  The only changes  that were made was I used pecans instead of walnuts and zested an entire orange and used all of it.  Half in the batter and the rest in the icing.  The only problem I experienced was removing the cookies from the sheet.  The underside of the cookie wanted to roll and stick to the spatula. Once placed on the cooling rack though  the cookies looked great.

I like this cookie, however, I did chop the cranberries very fine and only used 1 cup. I also  added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

Yum. The cranberries are really tart but since it's in a cookie, the sweetness balances it out.

These were fabulous!! I used frozen whole cranberries.  (I did not dice the cranberries or thaw.)  The cookies were wonderful bursts of cranberries.  Orange and cranberry are a wonderful pairing always.  My 5 year old grandaughter loved them, so at least in our home were a childf favourite!!

A great cookie to enjoy with a cup of coffee or tea.  My cookies turned out a little flat but that's my fault.  I think I added to much orange zest.  No one complained though.  You have to use fresh cranberries.  I pulsed mine in the food processor.  I also used orange concentrate for the glaze and added powdered sugar until it reached the consistency I wanted.  The flavors in this cookie are amazing.  Tart and sweet, delicious!

This recipie is great!  Though when I made this recipie the first time my cookies collapsed.  So, I tried the recipie a second time and put the cookies in the refrigerator for 1 hour before I put them on the my baking sheet.  This solution solved all my problems and now I make this recipie for my family on a regular basis!

These were delicious half an hour out of the oven. A crispy outside. I used sweetened dried cranberries and thought there was too much of it in the recipe.

I got rave reviews for these cookies! I used dried cranberries instead of fresh because that's all I had on hand, and I added a teaspoon of orange extract to the batter and a teaspoon of orange extract to the icing to kick up the orange flavor. These were soft and chewy and amazing. They'd be delicious without the icing too!

I'm normally a chocolate freak, but this year wanted to add a new cookie to my cookie trays-I make them for sale each year for a church fundraiser.  Decided to add these...and oh my gosh they are incredible!  followed the recipe EXACTLY, and yes, be careful not to overcook them.  Add this to your holiday cookies, youwon't be dissapointed!

Delicious!  Fresh cranberries give the cookies a nice chew & zing.  I probably added twice as much zest to the icing & you could really taste the freshness of the oranges.  I baked them & then stored them overnight in between sheets of parchment paper.  Still moist the next day.  Thank you for this recipe!

Fabulous. Works well with white rice flour to make it gluten-free, too! Use xanthan or guar gum if you don't want cookies that are too delicate.

These were very good, and the fresh cranberry gave them a delicious flavor!  I did not make the icing as I was going for a "not-so-sweet" taste.  
Now, I guess I shouldn't have done this, but I left them covered in an airtight container overnight, and my the next day they were VERY soft, OVERLY soft, and falling apart like crazy.  I would recommend only covering them loosely.  Otherwise, they were great!

Made these last night -- my dough was very moist and sticky so I think I'll add another 1/2 cup flour next time.  I think they are good as is but my boyfriend finds them quite tart (fresh cranberries) so I'm adding the glaze to 1/2 the batch.  Bec. the dough was so sticky I only got about 36 cookies out of this...

One word . . . Awesome!  These are sooo good!  I used Cranraisins and only had 1 cup, but that was plenty.

Amazing!
These cookies are delicious, my husband and I loved them. The flavor is such a nice change from the sweetness you would expect when you first see them.

This cookie recipe is a keeper! I like to try new cookie recipes every year for my cookie platters I give out to friends, family and neighbors during christmas time and this is by far my new favorite cookie recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews, and I wasn't let down! The only modification I made was to add 1.5 teaspoons of orange zest, other than that it was as written. Someone mentioned to only bake them for about 10 minutes or so as to not overcook them. I followed this advice for the first batch, and while they tasted delicious, they were so crumbly and delicate that it made it hard to keep them in one piece. So the second batch I baked a bit longer, maybe 12 minutes or so until a little bit more brown. These held together much better, had a bit of a crunchy-caramelly edge and I thought they were much more preferable. Determine what is right on your first batch and follow this on batches moving forward. PERFECT holiday cookie!

The flavor is great! My husband loves that they are chewy. I followed the recipe exactly except I only baked them for around 10 minutes, they tend to brown on the bottom very quickly. They were a big hit with my kids too, they liked the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the orange.

This is a very good recipe. The cooking time is a little long. I only cooked them for 10 mins and they were perfect. Also, I refrigerated the dough before baking. I used Craisins instead of fresh cranberries....still turned out great.

Great addition to my cookie recipe collection!  Perfect mix of sweet and tart.  I followed the recipe exactly and drizzled the frosting over the cookies.  So pretty!  And delicious!

YUM!  What a great idea for a cookie!  These are soft and delicious.  The only problem (sort of) is that they tend to stick together a little when stored.  I will definitely be making these every Christmas from now on, but will probably bake them a little longer next time to keep them from adhering to one another.  :-)

This is a beautiful cookie, especially for the holidays.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but cut the baking time down to about 10 minutes since they seemed to be browning on the bottom to quickly.  I used a cookie scoop to get even sized cookies and finished them with a swirl of white chocolate instead of the glaze.  They are so pretty!

I made these last night and they are so yummy! I did add a half cup more flour and a bunch more orange zest in both the cookies and the glaze. I also sprinkled a little bit of orange zest on top of the glaze for a very pretty presentation! My boyfriend loved them! I will definitely be making these again!

Nice orange-y bite with tartness.  I used orange craisins and also put a couple drops of orange extract in the batter.  I used orange peel from a spice jar and it was quite potent.  I was too lazy to add walnuts but next time I make it I will.  I think that will definitely add to the rating.  Overall, a very good cookie for times when you want a different taste.  I'm just more into fudge-y chewy chocolate type cookies than cakey/bread-y fruit cookies.

My five year old is trying to sneak them when I am not looking. We make cookies together once a week and we are always looking for new recipes. I took this one, added a splash of almond extract, used finely chopped almonds instead of the walnuts, and cut my berries in half. My family went crazy. I know that this has already become one of the cookies we will make on a regular basis. YUM!

These are very cakey cookies. I ended up adding probably another 1/2 cup of flour to make the dough the right consistency and also used more orange zest. great flavor but i prefer fudgey cookies.

These are so fantastic.  The only changes I made were adding more orange zest like others suggested and Crasins.  I did not made with the glaze since I didn't have powdered sugar.  Still excellent.  I can't wait to try the glaze next time. Yum!

Not quite as pretty as I had expected, but they taste very good. I always use a bit more orange zest than required. A nice drizzle of the frosting is all that's needed. These may just make the Christmas cookie list!

I made these cookies for my office cookie exchange.  My husband tried all the cookies and liked this one the best.  He and his buddy decided to bak cookies and picked this one to make.  It will happen tomorrow.  Can't wait to see the results.  The only difference I made was to add white chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts. I drizzled icing on half and left half uniced.  All tasted great.  The icing makes them more attractive.

These are very tasty.    Just the right amount of sweet and tart.  The icing added the finishing touch.  Can't stop eating them.

My sister made them for a cookie exchange, and they were the "hit" of the party.

THANKS for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I made a few batches for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit. Perfect just out of the oven, and equally as good when microwaved later. In fact, I'm about to go bake some more.

Oh man!  These are so good!  They have already become a family favorite and the first batch just got finished!  Hubby didn’t want nuts in the cookies so I swapped them for raisins and dates.  Yummy!

I've made these cookies quite a few times and they are wonderful.  I also have made some changes by adding all the zest after reserving some for the glaze.  I don't understand how some people need to add more flour.  I reduced the flour to 2 1/4 cups and they come out perfectly.  Also reduced the cranberries to 1 cup as 2 cups is too much.  My family as well as the children all love this recipe.

These were a big hit! I added just a touch more sugar and  a bit more fresh squeezed OJ and zest. Tangy and sweet at the same time. Even my 2 hard core sugar lovers were total thumbs up. I will definitely make these again.

I, and all my large Italian family, love this cookie. Each year I bake with a friend and both our families went bonkers for these cookies. No drizzle necessary, but I decided to make it and put it in a squeeze bottle next to the cookie platter. A few people tried it and enjoyed it, but the overall consensus was it was unnecessary because the cookies were so awesome without it. The left over drizzle was used at brunch the next day on my multigrain pancakes. It was so very delicious, I had to make more-twice!!! I’m looking forward to trying it on French Toast for New Years Brunch. These cookies are delicious and the drizzle is too! The drizzle recipe stands alone and has multiple ways to add deliciousness to a variety of breakfast/brunch foods.

Great cookies! I used fresh cranberries, almond extract and slivered almonds (chopped up) as others suggested. They weren't too sweet with the icing either.

I gave 4 stars because the variations that others suggested were needed. I added 1/2 cup more flour and lowered the temp to 350. I cooked them for 13 minutes at the lower temp. I didn't use the glaze because they were already sweet enough.

This recipe is delicious but I did make a few changes to it. I only used half a cup of white sugar and added three quarters of a cup of white chocolate. I also added a little over two cups of cranberries (chopped), the more the merrier and a little over one tablespoon of orange zest. It was so good. I ate ten in the first half an hour of them being baked. I totally have to make them again.

Can't beat the flavor of these, but mine were very soft and never crisped up.  Suggest adding an extra 5-10 minutes to baking time.  I baked mine for 15 total.

Quite good soft cookies, nice flavor! Minor adjustments, as several reviews suggested. *** FRESH cranberries (lightly pulsed in chopper) ***Fresh squeezed orange juice, using bits of pulp plus zest. *** Added about 1/2 C more flour *** Skipped walnuts - next time I’ll use chopped almonds, and perhaps some Almond flour. *** My only addition was 1/2 tsp. Almond Extract; next time I will use a little more. *** Had no time to make the glaze, but my cookies were good without. *** Chilled dough before baking; first batch, some bottoms burnt when I allowed the edges to get just a little browned, so I pulled them out before they looked "done". Had to quickly, gently nudge very hot cookies off of the ungreased baking sheets - they were sticking and cracking if I let them cool on the sheets- Next time, I’ll make sure to have parchment paper! *** Will try a light drizzle of white chocolate over cookies next time. (I’m not a baker, but these cookies were really delicious and I’ll definitely use this recipe again.)

These are festive & delish! The dough was very thick & mixing in the chopped cranberries was a little hard. I can’t imagine adding another 1/2 cup of flour. My edges did thin out a tad, so next time I’ll refrigerate the dough. I may try lowering the temp from 375 to 350, also.  I used the small cookie scoop.

Extra wow! So delicious! I used only 3/4 cup of sugar, since our family are not big sweet eaters. I  added 1 1/4 tsp zest and an extra 1/2 cup of flour as suggested By others. Cut fresh cranberries in 1/2 and placed in orange juice for 15 min and drained. 375 deg in gas oven, middle rack for 13 min. Perfect outcome! Thanks for sharing this recipe. A big hit with the family and at the girls cookie party.

These were good, but not nearly as tasty as the citrus cranberry shortbread cookies.  The first batch was made exactly as the recipe stated. However, I made a lot of changes to my second batch that I felt made them tastier.   I used 1 c. oatmeal and dropped the flour to 1.5 cups.  (I preferred the texture with the oatmeal added) Increased the orange juice to 1/4 cup, added 1 tsp almond extract, and used the zest from a full orange.  Those changes made it a soft chewy, slightly tangy treat!

This is delicious!  The only difference I made was I used black walnuts instead of English walnuts.  The flavors were wonderful.  I added a little more confectioner’s sugar to thicken up the glaze a bit.  Otherwise the recipe was perfect!

Everything was great until the frosting. It was way too thick!! I followed the recipe to a T so I don't know what happened. I was so disappointed and it made half my cookies look sad and ugly when I tried to put it through a pipping bag into the cookies and it just bust out of the sides of the bag.  My bad for using a cheap bag, but dang was it thick. I wish I'd skipped the icing all together.

I made the cookies yesterday, made quite a few. Change the recipe a bit I use 2 tablespoons of concentrated orange juice instead of just plain orange juice I used fresh cranberries chopped. I used chopped almonds, also a tiny bit of almond extract and I left them in there 10 minutes longer than you were supposed to next time I do this I’m not gonna put in the baking soda it makes them very Cake like. That part of these cookies I’m not a fan of other than that they’re delicious.

Super delicious. Because of a son's tummy issues, I experimented by using ghee instead of butter with 1:1 substitution and it worked without difficulty. I also subbed chopped pistachios since I don't like walnuts. Otherwise followed other's guidance of adding a bit more zest, 1/2 cup more flour, 1/4 tsp of vanilla, and watching the cook time closely. The split cranberries were tart but they offered an interesting counterpoint to the sweetness.

The glaze is a very sweet orange and tasty. It brings the needed sweetness to the cookie for a perfect balance. I took advice from other cooks, added 1/2 cup of flour more and lowered the baking temperature to 350. I probably should have added an extra full cup. I did add a little more after the first batch came out thin. Cranberries don't melt, so they need a little puff around them.

I love these cookies. They are go to for any holiday  bake sale donation and gifts for teachers etc. One thing I would change is the amount of icing. I find I really don’t need 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 3 tbsps of juice. 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of juice is plenty.

I made it more or less according to the recipe except tried adding 1/4 tsb almond extract (not sure it added much, but certainly didn't hurt it!) As others, I also used fresh cranberries cut in half/thirds.

I will say, as others have said, the base cookie is REALLY sweet, but I think skipping the topping because it is sweet is missing the additional layer that helps balance the sweetness. IMHO, anyway, adding the topping took an almost unbearably sweet cookie and mellowed and deepened it.

It's admittedly probably a taste thing, though. My son loved it and I was "eh" until I added the topping then he was "eh" and I loved it :)

This was a test batch and I'll be making it again for an event this weekend.

Made this recipe for a cookie exchange my group is having.  Liked the sound of the ingredients but they did not turn out as pictured and were so poor, my husband will have to eat them.  No way I can take them to the exchange.  What a disappointment!

The flavors were spot on. Everybody at work said they were great and I am my own worst critic, but I think they came out a little tough. They are still tasty enough to retry around the holidays.

I sent these cookies into an office party.  Comments were overwhelmingly positive.  People who like cranberry orange muffins said they were their favorite.  I agree with those saying the cookies were too flat.  A bit more flour will make them more fluffy without sacrificing moistness.  I did not add walnuts due to concerns about nut allergies in the office, and I used orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice.

I used Craisins, since I had a bag that needed to get used up. I think that was a mistake- they made it too sweet and chewy, but the cookie itself was really good- nice, light orange flavor. I’ll try again with regular cranberries  and I suspect it will be great. That said, I have a child staying with me who complains about every food put before him and he liked these.

Absolutely delicious. This is my second time making these cookies. Just love them. First time I did it as written. This time I did things a little differently. Some good. Some not. I added twice the zest. And added twice the orange juice. Added a little more flower to make up for it. just a little bit. I added vanilla. Adds to it. I toasted the walnuts. That is a must do in my mind. I used a small food chopper to do the cranberries and nuts. I did them a little to much. To small. Chop them by hand. Much better. next time I am going to try using  craisins and just soak them for a little bit. Thinking along the lines of a oatmeal raisin cookie. Think the bite of the craisins will be a nice touch. I have not done the icing. I don't think it needs it. This time I did also add a 1/4 cup more sugar. Just to counter the tartness of the cranberry's. I think it was perfect. Still a little tart. But a good mix of the two. I am taking these to a party tonight and I am anxious to see their response to these. But my wife always comments on these cookies being so good. And that does not happen very often. So that says a lot to me. :-)

I have made this recipe twice and put them into the cookie gifts I give to family and friends at Christmas.  The only change I have made is to use the raisin like cranberries. I chopped them with my hand chopper and I use about 3/4 cups (or to taste).  Everyone seems to enjoy them because they go fast. Leftovers get frozen to bring out when unexpected company comes or if you want a treat with your afternoon tea.  These have gone into my Cookies to make collection of recipes.

Holy moly, these were outstanding! The flavor on these is strong but well-balanced between cranberries and oranges and is a song of sweet and tart at once. Texture is a little cranky — these benefit from being chilled and from say a 1/4 c. extra flour, no more. These were a big hit with my castmates and friends backstage and have just been added to my list of Christmas cookie staples.

As others have said, extremely cake-like texture! They stay soft and moist forever, but if you're searching for a cookie with more of a crunch then I would modify this/go with a different recipe. Really, really good and very sweet. Next time will try with the glaze and might even stick into a cake/loaf tin.

These are really delicious but I think they would be even better with white chocolate chips. Also, the dough should be chilled before baking to prevent them running into each other.

With  so many reviews saying to add flour and reduce heat, that is whay I did.  The first batch were not cooked...so I upped the temp.  The added flour kept my cookies from spreading much at all... So I have little round cookies.  Still tasty, of course.  Difference in ovens and flours, perhaps?

There are very good.  I made one batch as the recipe directed adding Almond Extract & Walnuts - very good.  After tasting, my husband and I decided to make another batch omitting the walnuts, switching the almond extract with vanilla extract, and adding 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts - YUM.  The latter version doesn't need the icing, but it does look nicer if you're taking them to a party (as I was).

The cookies were a hit.  I first had my husband try one without the icing.  He thought they were great.  Then without offering up any of the feedback I have read I put the icing on and right away he said the cookies were perfect without the icing. The icing was too sweet.  I took the cookies to an exchange this morning, but it was one where there was a brunch and the cookies were taken home, not eaten there. We only indicated what kind of cookies, not who made each one, so I may not hear more feedback.  I made a batch  with Splenda (both white and brown sugar) and my husband, who is pre-diabetic, like them, too.  I am new to using Splenda to bake, and see that it makes  for more crumbly cookies.   Their website has some adjustments to make when using the substitute and I'll work on incorporating those in the future.

My cookies did not spread as others described. However, I used some of the tricks in the suggestions: an extra cup of flour and 350F. One other trick I used, I made the dough late afternoon and then put it in the frig overnight. In the morning I pulled the dough out and let it warm enough to work with. I followed the 2 inch spacing recommended, but I did not need it. The cookies hardly spread. I was able to get 4 x 7 arrangement of the cookies on the sheet. I let the cookies cool for 5 minutes before removing them from the parchment paper.  The cookies are soft and delicate. Last batch is in the oven at the moment. I also used a mixture of halved cranberries and minichopper-minced ones to distribute the cranberry flavor. Even after using a bit extra orange peel and juice (the dough was a bit dry with the extra flour), the cookies without icing do not taste of orange.

I am in the process of making these at the moment.  I think there should be a bit of a tweak to the ingredients.  The video shows what appears to be two cups of cranberries, that are then chopped.  The recipe says two cups of chopped cranberries.  Those two amounts are vastly different!

Also, while not yet frosted, these cookies are puffier than the thin ones in the recipe photo.  I am a bit disappointed.

I used Gluten-free all purpose flour in place of basic flour. Followed the recipe as written and added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Baked at 350 for 14 minutes. Great flavor and soft texture, sweetness was just right with out added sugar glaze. Guest had no idea the cookies were GF.

Made these last year & they were good. But this year I had a terrible time. I again followed reviewers notes. The only thing I did different this year is that I now own a stand mixer. Dough was very dry, hard to work with. Would not work with cookie scoop. Had to drop by hand. Baked ok but they are so very wet- cannot keep them in a container

All together a good cookie. I did have to add an extra 1/2 cup flour as mine too spread out. I probably should have added 2/3 cup. I used dried orange flavored cranberries (craisens) which kicked up the orange flavor. I like the almond suggestion and would likely try a bit of almond extract next time.

These cookies are amazing! They were a huge hit with the fam. I had all the ingredients on hand with the exception of the fresh cranberries so I used dried cranberries and cut the baking time down to ten minutes (do this if you like your cookies soft and chewy).

I absolutely loved these cookies! However I put the cranberries in a gallon size ziploc and crushed them with a rolling pin to release more flavor and boy they were a hit! I took the advice and put in almond extract but I didn't put nuts in them. I used the zested oranges and juiced them into the dough with a little orange extract. I did use regular arange juice and zest for the glaze. You really can't go wrong with oranges and cranberries unless you try to tame the flavor. Keep it balanced and it's a match made in heaven!

I squeezed extra oranges into the batter, as well as adding coconut flakes. For the glaze, I melted white chocolate and orange, which I topped with coconut. It was a big hit!

Lovely light cookie with the orange and cranberry coming through!  I increased the amount of orange juice and zest in the batter to that of an entire large orange.  Also, per other suggestions, increased flour by 1/2 cup.  Yum.  I didn't have to frost them.  Next time I may even increase the OJ a little more.  Nice surprise in a light cookie.

Needs more orange flavor. Next time I will put in twice as much orange rind and juice. Otherwise, a nice little cookie. Be sure not to overbake. Take them out just before they are brown on the bottom. Otherwise they get too crispy.

These cookies turned out great and I didn't add the glaze.  I liked the suggestions of Brooke Salt.  I used fresh cranberries hand-cut in half.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 tsp almond flavoring, and a tablespoon of orange zest (from a fresh orange, then squeezed juice from said orange. I, also, used pecans rather than walnuts, my preference.  I cooked them on silpat and baked at 350 for 15 minutes.

I made these cookies and they are amazing! Perfect orange & cranberry mix! I didn’t substitute or add anything extra. I left them on the cookie rack and they are still soft - NOT hard! So yummy! I’ll be making them again! I also didn’t have orange juice, so I squeezed a large orange instead & got more than enough for the recipe! The whole family loved them!

These are so cute and yummy. I named them bunnybutt berry cookies to give away. One trouble was that the icing does not stay solid and end up sticky on top of each other, so I had to give up icing. I wonder if anyone has tips! I’m a lazy baker and didn’t enjoy chopping up cranberries haha, but oh it is worth it! :)

These cookies are awesome!  I use Craisins and soaked them in orange juice overnight prior to using.  Also, I use frozen orange juice concentrate for the juice and add 1/4 tsp almond extracts.  Have made them several times and they are always perfect!

PERFECT blend of cranberry and orange in a delicious drop cookie!  I added extra orange zest to both the cookie and the glaze...in my husband's words "These are a MUST-bake every year.".....I'm thinking it will be more often than that.

These are really tasty for a non-chocolate recipe. I didn't have access to fresh cranberries so I used dried ones which I partially rehydrated and did not chop. Yummy!

This is a keeper...absolutely the best!!!
However, I did not make the the icing...I felt they were sweet enough.
These cookies were so flavorful and soft. I highly recommend!!!

I used 1 full tablespoon of orange zest for the cookies, and I added 1 teaspoon each cinnamon and ginger and 3/8 teaspoon cloves with a teaspoon vanilla.

The sugar to butter to cranberry ratio is perfect! Just enough tartness, just enough richness, just enough zest and freshness from the fruit. Best ever recipe! Congrats!

I also did not use the glaze, to cut down on the extreme sweetness. Convection oven, 14 minutes, perfect! I did not have fresh cranberries, so used dried and rehydrated them in some boiling water. Seems fine. The orange and cranberry flavour is wonderful!

Made these for a cookie exchange, and I’ll definitely be making again. They were the hit of the party and I only walked away with four, which wasn’t nearly enough for these gems. I used the fresh squeezed juice from the orange I zested for the frosting, which turned out fabulously. Also added 1.5 tsp vanilla, halved the cranberries, and placed rolled cookies in the fridge for about 10 min before baking. Couldn’t have asked for a more perfect cookie.

I made the cookies...they are very good. Not too sweet a bit chewy but the texture is nice. The orange drizzle on top adds just enough pow. I made this to go with other homebaked goodies for co-workers for Christmas. Thanks for the recipe!

Great cookie, baked like a chocolate chip cookie. Next time I'll add more walnuts (closer to a cup, rough chopped). Tastes great with or without glaze, we did half & half. After storing overnight we noticed that the cookie got very soft/moist (which was a little disappointing).

Excellent easy cookie recipe! I made it because I had leftover cranberry sauce, so instead of dried cranberries, I used cranberry sauce. I added two tbsp extra flour to combat the extra wetness, and the cookies turned out tasty and beautiful! I also added extra orange zest, as everyone suggested. More of a cakey than a chewy cookie, but the tanginess from the cranberries and orange are so lovely. My cranberry sauce also had ginger in it, and gave it a nice spice feel! A beautiful, tasty cookie for the holiday season.

I made these into bars as I was short on time, I also used lemon instead of orange as I have an abundance of lemon right now for some reason. The lemon worked out great they are more tart but that seems to be fine with those I shared them with!

I used dried cranberries, other than that I followed the recipe. The texture was good. The flavor was ok, but not as good as I was hoping for after reading all of the reviews I thought they were very sweet and very bland. They lack something but I'm not sure what.Not a bad cookie but not great either. I probably won't make them again

Will definitely make this again. Really liked the flavor. I did use 3 1/2 cups of flour, they turned out nice and soft and they did not spread too much. I chose to use dried cranberries and to add extra orange zest. This made 34-36 cookies for me.

Love these cookies!  Made them several times for parties and gifts.  They are a nice "different" cookie. Really adds something to the  cookie platters I bring as dessert .

These are absolutely amazing. I did add a little extra orange zest to the dough to taste, and chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Also threw in a cup of white chocolate chips - incredible!! The glaze will need an extra tablespoon or so for the consistency in the picture (that marbley look) be careful with the glaze if you use white choc chips, it gets super sweet. I did half with the glaze and half without for my Easter gathering. Everyone loved them !

Sorry, this is WAY to sweet, the dough was too loose and I had to add almost another cup of flour.  I doubled the orange zest, and still had no orange flavor to speak of.  I baked these at 350 for 13 min on an airbake cookie sheet.  These are like another reviewer said, like a cranberry bread with too much sugar.  Sorry, I'll keep looking until I find a cookie, not a cake.  Thank goodness my husband will eat anything with sugar and fat.  come to think of it, I think I will make the chocolate chip cookie recipe and just add the cranberries instead.

This is a great recipe.  I only made a few personal alterations by adding a tsp of vanilla and two tsp of fresh thyme for more of a spring flavored cookie vs a winter one.  I also omitted the walnuts and icing and used a honey simple syrup on top with some blanched almonds instead.  I used a fork to press them down a bit and then basted the tops with the honey and threw some almonds on before baking them.

i made these with 3/4 rye flour and 1/4 spelt.  i prefer a heavier & healthier cookie and it worked well.  used mixed dried fruit and they were wonderful.  in future, if i waned to glaze them i would use less sugar.

So I had these Girl Scout Cranberry Orange Almonds, and they had the taste of a cranberry scone, so I thought they would be delicious on a cookie. I used this recipe as a base,  adding these chopped nuts in place of the orange and walnuts. I did add extra craisins, well, because we love them! 
These are delicious on their own, with out the drizzle. I think I am going to melt some white chocolate and drizzle that on. Yummy!!

Great cookie. I love the flavor. I didn't have and oranges so I added extra orange just in place of the zest and didn't frost them as we liked them plain. Will definitely make these again soon!

This is one of my favorite cookies to make. The recipe is easy to follow and they are delicious!!!
Note: The last time I made these cookies, I used a blender to chop the cranberries and I should have squished some of the juice out. The juice turned the cookies a little pink and the juice gathered at the bottom, making the last few cookies a bit sticky. Make sure to stir so the juice doesn't settle!

This was a hit both times i made it! I read in another review to do 1 1/2 tsp. of orange juice... I misread as 1 1/3 TBSP. and they came out beautifully. I also used the juice from the oranges instead of storebought OJ

It was OK.   Flavors were definitely good.   I followed the recipe exactly, but mine turned out flat which also made them crisp.  Don't know what I did wrong but I would give it another try.

A nice, Christmas-y cookie.  I made without the glaze and these were part of treat-trays I gave to people. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour, and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. They smell lovely whilst baking!

I didn't have an orange to zest so I added 1/4 tsp of orange oil instead.  They turned out wonderfully.  The orange flavor and the cranberries go together so well.  I also left off the glaze as I don't like glazes.  Will definitely be adding these to my list of go to cookies.

The recipe looked good so I took a look at the pros and cons and made some recommended adjustments. I used 1/2C
more flour, used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco and baked at 360 for 10 minutes and I have perfect cookies.

OMG! MY NEW FAV COOKIE!!

On the advice of others, I increased Flour to 3 C. and added 1/2 tsp Vanilla.  I was also generous with the orange zest, and used Pecans rather than Walnuts.  I used a small cookie scoop and rather than roll them in my hand, found that pressing firmly into the scoop helped the finished cookies hold together. Sooooo gooood you don't need the glaze so I left it off. Thank goodness I mean to give them away so I don't eat them all myself!!

My favorite cookie to make for the holidays!  The cookie dough is not overly sweet and balances so beautifully with the tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the icing. Perfection!

Awesome cookie.  Used becel gold instead of butter to cut down on fat.  Refrigerated the dough for 2 hours and then baked only for 9 min total.  Flatten the tops and reshaped them into circles as they do not spread as much.  Will definitely be adding these to my christmas cookie list.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and will be making them again soon. It was hard to only eat a few so the rest could be put in the freezer for holiday gifts. Lots of flavor, soft and wonderful.

Made exactly as recipe stated.  The directions does not specify to flatten a bit, first pan left in balls, however in next pans I flattened them a bit.  Did not put icing on top as I'm on weight watchers so I wanted to keep the sugar content down.

I will make it again.  I added 1 t. vanilla and used 1 C of broken pecans.  The recipe shows these are "drop cookies", so I expected them to spread out.  Recipe also said to space 2 inches apart.  They did not spread out, so the second batch I flatten out some.  The 2 nd batch was prettier.

Followed the recipe as was presented. I got 3 doz cookies with my medium cookie scoop. Th prep time is off as it takes longer to chop the cranberries. I did use frozen not fresh and kept the chopped ones frozen until I needed them in the bowl. i think I will cut back on the ctanberries to 1 1/2 cups next time. I will also make 1/2 cup less of icing
This is indeed an adult cookie as they are tart and as I like things on the tart side this is a keeper for me

Super yummy cake-y cookies! I used craisins which I microwaved for a hot second with a little bit of water to plumpen. I also added extra orange juice and orange zest to make them more flavorful... found that the glaze was unnecessary.

I have been making this recipe for years now, and it is, by far, my most requested cookie. If you ever want to enter a cookie into a contest, this is the one that will win! I make it exactly as directed and it is perfect. The texture is light and the level of sweetness can be customized by the amount of glaze you use. However, it is quite a lot of work. I've never found a suitable alternative to hand chopping the cranberries, and always end the day with bruised finger tips (but I do tend to make large batches). Regardless, they are worth the work!

I loved this recipe.  It makes a lot of cookies.  These were the best I made over Christmas.  Good flavor.  I did not add nuts which was the only deviation I had from the recipe.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!  My family and co-workers absolutely adore these....we call them "scone cookies".  Breakfast treat more than a dessert?  We are happy to eat them ANY time of day!!  LOVE the fluffiness!  I wish my other cookies turned out like these.

SO DELICIOUS! That orange zest really makes it. I added a bit of extra flour because the dough seemed too thin, and didn't add the nuts. I found in my oven that the cookies needed a shorter bake time, 8-10 mins. I made them to add to cookie trays to give away, but maybe I'll keep these ones for myself...

These are fantastic! I added more zest to the batter as suggested by other reviewers. I tried some with the icing and some without, it was delicious either way. This was such a hit at my Christmas party's cookie table I will for sure make it again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made these Gluten-Free using the posted recipe to a tee, and  added 1.5 teaspoons of  Xanathan Gum and increased the baking soda to 1 tsp.  They came out perfect!  I used dried cranberries I found in the baking aisle at the market and they were fantastic.  They were perfect consistency and I did put the icing on, however they are very sweet with the icing, definitely needs to be consumed with plenty of milk!

I just finished making these for Santa, who I think will thoroughly enjoy them! I had to use some substitutions, since I realized I didn't have some of the right ingredients.  I didn't have cranberries so I put a couple of tablespoons of cranberry juice in.   I also didn't think I would like walnuts so I used pecans which I grounded up in my food processor.  I also added chocolate chips.   Received two thumbs up from the husband and kids!

Amazing! I added extra orange zest and almond extract like the best review said and they came out perfectly! They didn't taste too sweet to me so I will be trying them with the icing.

Great cookie!! However if you use a darker cookie sheet I found that you need to grease pan. Also, had to put oven temp on 350 not 375. I also added 3 tablespoon of orange juice, vanilla extract, about 2 teaspoons of orange zest and a few mini chocolate chips.

I added the 1/2 cup more of flour to recipe and cut the cranberries in half.  This recipe was very frustrating.  The dough was dry and crumbly and very difficult to form into a ball to put on the cookie sheet.  I tried compensating by adding more sugar and butter.  The cookies looked nothing like the picture which appear flat.  These cookies stayed raised and were very doughy.  Not very sweet and too much cranberry.  I could hardly taste the orange.  I grew annoyed and through the batter into a bread loaf pan.  Hopefully that turns out better.

I've made this now for a number of years. It's my mom's very favorite. I used fresh cranberries chopped in the food processor. I didn't change a thing. This is a cakey cookie. I didn't make any changes to the amount of flour. I found you have to use softened butter....don't melt in the microwave it will change the consistency of the end product. In addition, if you double the recipe be sure to mix them seperately, one at a time. You can't leave the batter sitting around for too long, before you bake, that too will change the consistency. I just mix one batch, follow the recipe, and voila, perfect little button cookies.   I always make two batches, throw half of them in the freezer unglazed and just glaze them when I take them out later. I get asked for the recipe all the time. Just this year it dawned on me, they might be really delish with white choc chips....may just have to try that!  If you don't have an orange you can use orange extract. Yummy.

First time making this cookie and I read the reviews before starting as there were several good call-outs that helped me make this perfect the 1st time. 1 1/2 sticks of butter is plenti and if you like a chunky cookie, you could use 1 stick of butter but the batter will be very crumbly. I added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract and am glad I did- terrific enhancement. I also cut back my oven 10 degrees. Crowd pleaser cookie!!

I made them to bring to work and people loved them!  They are not too sweet and the flavor combination is unusual and good. Next time I will try adding an extra half cup of flour as one of the reviewers stated; every time I've made them, they tend to spread out a bit too much.

Not a bad cookie, but  if I make them again I will definitely change a couple of things:

- they turned out a bit too sweet, so I would reduce an amount of sugar.
- I nearly burnt the first batch after only 10 minutes. With all this sugar they tend to brown very quickly, so make sure to watch them carefully after about 8-9 minutes in the oven.
-You can further enhance the orange flavour by adding a handful of candied orange peel.
-I would definitely recommend chilling the dough a little before baking. 
-I also found they they don't  spread too much if you roll the dough into balls and just let them flatten as they bake.

I substituted pistachios for the walnuts as I think they go better with cranberry,  I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of extra orange juice to the icing.

This had great flavor, but it was NOT a cookie at all. Mine turned into one big puddle only two minutes after being put in the oven. I recommend you but this in a baking dish to make a cookie/bar/cake like dessert. It simply is not a cookie.

Made these (without the icing) and the cranberries turned out tart but good! Doubled the orange zest and I would still add more. Added about 1/2 cup of flour to the recipe and they were still very soft. Also, I used 1/2 the amount in whole wheat flour. I used crushed pecans as well instead of walnuts. Would be good with almonds and almond extract as someone mentioned.

Overall, this recipe needs some tweaking and dressing up to be good. I used 1.5 sticks of butter and added 1/2 a cup more flour. This resulted in a cakey and dense consistency. I also used about a cup of cranberry sauce in place of the grated form resulting in a mauve color. Because the texture was so cakey I cut the cookies apart and filled oreo-style with more cranberry sauce. This and the glaze moved the cookies from mediocre to pretty good.

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding walnuts. I also added currants and pumpkin /sunflower seeds for a delicious healthier version!
Also added an additional tbsp of orange juice to icing to help with piping onto cookie! DELICIOUS!!

Made as directed. Cutting 2 cups of cranberries took at least 30 minutes. Next time I will use the food processor. Left the cookies in for exactly 12 minutes, which was perfect. I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5, only because I didn't care for the frosting. Recommend this cookie without the frosting--they are a bit soft and cake-like, but refreshing with the cranberries. I was skeptical about this recipe, but really enjoyed them!

These are the best cookies I've made in a long time.  Added almond extract, white chocolate chips and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. Left cranberries whole.  The contract of the sweet and sour is amazing and the hint of orange combined with almond is just a delight.  Made them two days in a row and will be part of my yearly holiday cookies.

Made this as a treat to take to work for our thanksgiving lunch and for our church fellowship. My one tip is to make the icing after all the cookies are done. 1 it keeps from having to add a little more juice to keep it thinned and 2 it might cut down on the sampling. ( it won't ).

Delicious cookies!  Not as much of an orange presence as I expected, but still a very nice subtle orange note.  Also, I will add more walnuts next time I make them, because it added a nice texture to the cookies.  I will definitely be making more for the holidays, as they made me feel like Christmas.

Made these cookies today and they are Great!
My husband doesn't like cranberries but loved these cookies.  The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 tsp. orange flavoring to cookie dough and also to the icing
just to make sure we could taste the orange.
I will make these for our next church potluck.

Great cookie! I just made these yesterday.  I used butter (not margarine), chopped fresh cranberries, zested an orange & squeezed the juice.  The frosting was a little thin, so I added more powdered sugar & drizzled the cookies. Really good, plan to do it again during holidays. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were so delicious! I had to stop myself from eating them all at once. I made these during the Christmas holidays and sent them out as gifts and everyone loved them. I ended up making additional batches because everyone wanted more. Will definitely be using this recipe again. The mixture of cranberry and orange is a wonderful pairing. I think I may have found my new cookie craving. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Awesome cookie that is a nice change to the normal sugar or chocolate chip cookie. I did make the glaze and ended up adding a 1/2 of lemon juice to cut the sweet taste. I WILL make these again.

I absolutely love these cookies! They are so amazing with or without the frosting. I used frozen cranberries and hazelnuts. Due to the liquid in the cranberries, the dough was still sticky at the end. I used 1/2-3/4 cup more flour. They still came out perfect!

These cookies are fabulous!!!!  Not too sweet.  I chopped the fresh cranberries in the processor and it was so easy.  I had to bake them longer then suggested to get them light brown and crispy.

Loved this and will make it again! I added 1/2 cup more flour, used half cup less sugar since I don't like too sweet, and used fresh cranberries instead (maybe a cup or so). Didn't need to do the glaze since it was yummy without! So good!

We loved these cookies. I added a 1/2 a tablespoon of orange juice over what it called for and 1/4 cup of flour because of previous comments, came out great!! I didn't use the glaze, found them more than sweet enough without it. I might try them with the glaze later but only if I cut the sugar in the recipe.

I used Craisins for the recipe since I had no fresh cranberries to use and to be honest I didn't even think about it!  I used 1 cup Craisins and added 1 tsp of orange extract to the recipe.  I'm sure the recipe would be delicious as written but I like really "orangy" cookies.  Other than that I made no changes and they were perfect.  I didn't add the icing to the cookies.  I tasted one and just felt they were perfect as is.

Really a good cookie!  Made some changes based on preference, other reviews and on-hand items.  Used 5 oz. package of dried cranberries(soaked in o.j. for a couple of hours), added a bit more orange zest in both the cookie and glaze, 1/2 c. macadamia nuts and half almond and half vanilla extracts.  Baked at 350 for 13 minutes.  Used the oj that the cranberries soaked in for the glaze.  I realize that I made several changes but the basic recipe is very good.  Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor; but needed to come out of the oven in only 8 minutes.  First pan cooked 12 minutes were way too brown.  Mine were not at all cake-like or fluffy, more thin and crisp.

The cookies were the hit of the Party. Birthday girl(55 and still alive), just had to have the recipe. ;)....

Just for presentation, layer the plate with a bed of coconut, trimmed in cranberries, twists of orange rind and a sprig of rosemary.  Very festive and keeps cookies a bit moister.  (if they last long enough to dry out)

I made these this morning. The only change I made was...I only had Pecans so that's what I used. I, like another reviewer, preferred them without the glaze. Just perfect, sweet, a bit tart and chewy. Thank you Mordavia.

I just made these cookies and they are delicious.  My daughter, who might be allergic to nuts (she's being tested), tasted a half cookie and said "Please make them again without the nuts, they are delicious".  I only used 9 ounces of cranberries because that was all I had and less than a half cup of walnuts for the same reason and they are still delicious.

I won a cookie contest with these.  The flavor is outstanding...however I do use dried cranberries as opposed to fresh.  When I tried it with real cranberries, they were too bitter for our taste.

Used 3 cups flour, zest from entire orange, baked at 350 for 12 minutes.  These are delicious!  Don't even need the glaze.

This has turned out to be my husbands and my favorite cookie. Only thing I changed was I use craisins that have been soaking in cranberry juice to reconstitute their plumpness and I dont add the glaze. these are perfectly sweet without it.

Absolutely a six star recipe.  I chilled the dough before scooping the cookies. . Made them with and without walnuts and both ways are great. As did  others, I used the juice from the grated orange.  I used a hand spinner chopper which coarsely chopped the cranberries and also
left some whole.  My favorite cookie recipe of all time. Make it as is and you will more than enjoy the result. In my opinion if it ain't broke don't fix it. BUT some of the suggestions do sound intriguing. Love, love this cookie. I can't wait for my cookie exchange party where this recipe will make me a star!

I had really high hopes for this recipe and the cookies were just alright.  There is a lot of butter in the recipe and my husband commented on the fact they tasted buttery.  I would recommend using more orange zest for sure.

This cookies is really fun to make and people really value the alternative to traditional chocolate or peanut butter-based cookies.  The key to this cookie's success is the frosting for a few reasons: 1. Who doesn't love frosting? 2. It adds excitement to the display of the cookie; and 3. It makes the cookie balanced between the tartness of the the orange zest and cranberries vs. the sweetness of the frosting.  I really like this recipe, but I know a few people that have knocked it for being inconsistent (chewy/crunchy/doughy). Still worth a shot regardless.

Just tried these for a Christmas cookie and never gave it much of a chance and they became MY ALL TIME favorite cookie, bar none. No matter who or where, this is my favorite cookie. If I was given the last meal request, this cookie would be one of the things I have.
 I have taken them to work and given them away and you will find a strange reaction. They are either the best cookie  by some while others or just okay, so the reactions are so different.. .This is just one awesome cookie!

I like cranberries so was happy finding this, I added white chocolate chips and omitted the icing. It got the sweetness in there without being too sticky.

Oh my goodness.  These cookies are so good.  I love the flavor and the texture of these cookies are awesome. Crispy and chewy at the same time.  I couldn't even use the glaze  because they were already gone within 1 hour. Thanks for the recipe.

These were the bomb...I subbed craisins for cranberries. I only used 1  cup of them though. I cut the glaze recipe in half it was just enough.I rolled into balls which yielded a more chewy vs. crispy cookie just my personal preference. Real butter is a must also.

This is a fabulous recipe! I followed the recipe, but I also added one whole finely chopped orange and one extra tablespoon of orange juice. Before I added the cranberries into the batter, I soaked them in some orange juice for 30 mins. They turned out great!

This cookie is my new favorite! I've made it for our big Holiday Party for the last two years and it gets rave reviews. The first couple times I made these, I chopped the cranberries by hand, but this time. I used my Pampered Chef chopper and that saved so much time. Another helpful hint, would be to buy large navel oranges. One large one, should be enough to get the zest and juice that you will need. I bought small ones this time and it was a hassle and took longer, because I had to zest and squeeze two oranges. I have even made some without cranberries in them and then just added more frosting for flavor. There are some that see or hear cranberries and don't want to try them.  It's silly, because they are excellent.  Just took two dozen to church and am taking another dozen to school, plus I'll make more for Christmas.

These cookies have become one of my standard contributions to holiday parties, birthdays, and baby showers. Everyone loves them and they are an excellent way to bring more variety to the cookie platters!

I prefer them without either the frosting or the walnuts. Otherwise, I don't change anything about the recipe!

This was just what I was looking for.  As I'm not a chocolate person, this cookie was amazingly good.  My hubby who isn't a fruit person even loved it.  I'm going to take the advice of others and add more flour as it did have a cake like texture.  Overall a great recipe.

Awesome recipe!  These could possibly be the best cookies I've ever had.  I didn't have walnuts but I used pecans and it was excellent!  Great recipe!!

Yuuuuuummmmmmy! These cookies are soooo most and delicious! At first I thought is would be a little too much to add to these already sweet cookies but it ended up making a good thing become great!!  I used confectioners sugar as opposed to powdered sugar which actually gave it a nice crunch.  These cookies are definately the newest addition to my top 5!!

EXCELLENT! These were fantastic....like my favorite cranberry orange scone in a cookie.  Better the 2nd and 3rd day after baking!  My husband loved them too.  Skipped the glaze this time as they were sweet enough, but they look so good glazed I may try it next time!

These are incredible! Made them for Christmas and they were inhaled.  I used a food processor to chop up most of the cranberries, and added some rough chopped pieces as well for some differing texture.  I followed the advice of others and just went with a whole orange's zest.  They turned out great!

I will definitely make these again but with modifications. 1-1/2 c. sugar made the cookies WAY too sweet for me so next time I will cut back on sugar. I also used a lot more orange zest than what the recipe calls for. I zested 2 large oranges and the flavor was great. I did not frost the cookies since they were already too sweet but will try the frosting next time when I cut back on the sugar in the cookie. I only had dried cranberries on hand but they were great. All in all this is a great recipe and I can't wait to try it again.

This are really tasty and a unique treat to give out for Holiday gifts.  I make scones with the same added ingredients but also add white chocolate chips, so I did that with this cookies!  It is especially good right out of the oven when the chocolate chips are melty :)

Although they did not come out like the picture, they were delicious!  Due to time constraints, I skipped on the icing, but they were pretty, sweet little cookies without.  Fresh cranberries really even out the flavor of the orange and sugars!  Definitely one I will use again!

These are beautiful! Great for the holidays!I used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the whole cup, just cause I thought that a whole cup of white sugar plus the brown sugar plus the glaze would be too much. Overall they were great! I loved the orangy taste to them :)

Absolutely love these cookies.  Used freshed squeezed orange juice instead of concentrate, Craisins for the cranberries, and pecans 'cause my DH is allergic to walnuts.  Taking them to a Christmas Cookie Swap in the morning.

I made these for a bake sale, and all the health nuts at work went... well nuts!  These cookies are super tasty and I cut down on the sugar for a healthier option.  These cookies are great even without the walnuts! Big hit and super easy!

these were really good. i did add the almond extract as someone suggested, and i probably could have added a little more flour as the dough was sticky but once i chilled it it was much easier to work with. i think next time i will try orange extract. i also added half a cup of choc chips instread fof the walnuts, and 1 cup of dried cranberries (did not chop them). I skipped the glaze, and i prob could have reduced the sugar by at least 1/4 cup as these are quite sweet. But they are really tasty :)

These were delicious! They turned out denser than I expected but I ended up liking it better that way, anyway! I let the zest sit in the orange juice overnight and added an extra tablespoon of juice to make it more of a glaze. I put the glaze in a plastic baggie and snipped of a tiny bit of the corner as a makeshift pastry bag.

these cookies are light & so tasty! perfect for a quick on the go breakfast snack or any other time of the day.. perfect combination of tart & sweet.. cookies were very moist & some broke apart so next time i will leave in the oven an extra minute or two. Minor changes: i didn't use the nuts & substituted the cup of butter for a crisco butter flavor shortening stick which cuts out some of the fat but still tastes great & I added almond extract which compliments the cranberry.  I didn't attempt the icing I liked these cookies just the way they were out of the oven :)

These are REALLY good. I made my own mistakes because I used shortening instead of butter, and mine actually came out fairly dry because of that and adding extra flour. They still TASTE good though, so I will not (like so many others) dock the rating of this cookie based on my own mistakes. Don't change the recipes at all if you want to make sure you are ACTUALLY getting the same cookie that the recipe says. Either way, these were STILL delicious, regardless of my own faults, and I WILL be making these again! Fantastic recipe!

Wow. These are the first cookies I've ever made that turned out fantastic. Normally I bake dessert that is NOT edible. I didn't get my cookies to be round with a perfect drizzle like the ones in the photo, but despite their funny shape they taste delicious.   I'm very excited to bring with me to the Christmas Eve party.   I followed the recipe exactly, but I used the zest of almost a whole orange, probably 3/4 of it, and squeezed all of the juice from the orange, and used fresh cranberries.. only a tinge more than the recipe calls for. I also added slivers of almond since I don't like walnut.   Other than that I followed it exactly. Mine were done in 11 minutes at 350. My oven is old and doesn't heat up right, so have to keep it below 350 or it quickly turns to 500 in there.   Thanks so much for the recipe, I love these cookies.

Absolutely delicious!  I used frozen cranberries and ran them through a food processor until they were in pretty small pieces. It worked out great!

Everyone loved these cookies! I made them without the frosting and they were still a hit for our cookie exhcange at work. Next time I make them, I think I'll use the frosting, just because I love the orange flavoring. I also used homemade vanilla in mine. thank you for sharing. These cookies are delicious and pretty!

I made these for my family's annual Cookie Day (the ladies bake from sunrise to sunset and we assemble assorted cookie platters for friends) and they were wonderful and fun to make! Everyone enjoyed the "healthiness" of these cookies, with the orange zest and cranberries. I am keeping these on my recipe list for next year!

I just made these cookies to take to a cookie swap and they are amazing!  I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews.  I added a 1/2 cup more flour than it originally called for and chilled the dough in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking at 350 for 12 minutes.  They look light in color when you pull them out of the oven, but do no keep them in longer.  I will definitely add these to my cookie recipe collection!  So yummy!

OH my goodness I am still baking these and I had to rush over to the computer after the second batch came out.....if you are on the fence you simply HAVE TO give this cookie a try!!!! I did use BUTTER, fresh cranberries and chopped them in half.  The only change I made was I subbed 1/2 splenda (still used another 1/2 cup white and brown sugar).  They are really good without the glaze...but wow are they incredible WITH the glaze! I find my oven runs hot so 10 minutes was enough. Oh...one more thing...I used one orange in the batter (zest from the whole orange, and all the juice)...then in the glaze, I used the juice from half an orange.  I personally liked allowing some of the pulp to fall in the bowl for both the batter and glaze. AMAZING!

Tried these on a whim and they have become a new favorite. This will easily be the best cookie on my cookie tray this year. I did make a couple alterations after reading other reviews. I substitued 1/2 cup of butter flavored Crisco for 1/2 the butter and I added a tsp of orange extract. I also threw in about a cup of chocolate chips. I would recommend that you don't skip the icing, as others have suggested. I tried 1/2 a cookie without the icing and the other half with. Definitely better with the icing. Enjoy!

Amazing - Unbelievable - My new favorite cookie!! The only change I made was instead of 2 T of OJ I used 1 T Cointreau & 1 T OJ in the batter and then added a little Cointreau to the icing - just because I have it in the house and never use it.  I used frozen cranberries since the recipe didn't specify.  I let them sit out on the counter for about 30 minutes and then chopped with my PC chopper.  I think the coldness of the cranberries helped the cookies stay during the baking process. I made these a few days ago for my Christmas cookies and I now have to make another batch - and everyone asked for the recipe.

Made these over the weekend during my Christmas cookie-baking marathon, and they're super yummy! These are a nice complement to all the chocolate cookies I make. They'll have a permanent place in my cookie repertoire. I used dried cranberries instead of fresh and skipped the icing, but used a fresh Louisiana orange in the dough. Maybe that's what made it extra yummy. :-)

Fab-u-lous! The perfect Christmas cookie! The icing brings them from a 9 to a 10, so not totally necessary, but worth the effort (and they really look pretty drizzled with the icing).  The only changes I made were to use some orange extract instead of the zest (since I didn't have any oranges on hand) and I swapped out 1/2 cup of flour for 1/2 cup of rolled oats - that was on a whim, I thought it might give the cookies a little extra body, and it really worked.  Try these - I just made my first batch and have instantly decided that these are going to be my give-away holiday treats this year :)

Amazing cookies. Made last year (followed recipe exactly) and they were everyone's favorite. Delicious and refreshingly different. Made the highly-rated pumpkin cranberry cookies this year to mix it up and wish I hadn't...I miss these cookies...

These cookies are wonderful.  My husband hates cranberries, however, I decided to make these cookies anyway.  He thought they were amazing!  After reading many of the reviews, I did change a few things.  Since I did not have cranberries on hand, I used cranraisins instead.  I also used  1 tsp of orange extract instead of orange zest and added 1 tsp of almond extract to the recipe.  I took some cookies to friends and they could not stop eating them.  I will be making these cookies all the time.

I've made these for the past 3 Christmases and people can't get enough of them! I definitely recommend using fresh cranberries over the dried.  The tartness is a nice balance with the sweet.  I also added 1 tsp almond extract, increased the orange zest to 1 tbsp and drizzled white chocolate over the cookies.  Perfection!  This is definitely a Christmas staple in our home! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These are delish!  My husband said he liked them without the glaze (before I made it) so I left half without and glazed the other half...now he can't decide which is better.  These were a hit in our household as well as our neighborhood!

This is a great recipe and an interesting cookie. I burned the first batch on 12 minutes at 375 degrees. Maybe it's because my oven isn't very good, and I wasn't watching them carefully enough. I found they turned out much better at 350 for 11 or 12 minutes. :)

I tried this recipe the other day without the frosting and it was very good.  I usually use a recipe that is more like a chocolate chip dough with dried cranberries.  I like the fresh cranberries used in this one, they are more tart and obviously fresh tasting.  This cookie is a little more light and delicate sort of springy cake like than the other one, can't decide which recipe I like more, but either way I go I'll definitely be using fresh cranberries from now on!

I'm still baking.  These are a real keeper and will be an all year favorite. I should have doubled the recipe; but will next time. I followed the recipe exactly; but did add just a dash of vanilla. I have an orange tree just outside my door; so the orange flavor is fresh.

This recipe was VERY easy and came out great!  I got a little nervous with some of the reviews saying not to overcook so the first batch I undercooked a bit, but the second batch was great.  I used dried cranberries and only used about 1 Cup.  Will definitely make these again!

These were delicious!  I am a bit of a "make do" cook and I didn't have enough butter so I substituted with half shortening and they turned out perfectly.  Also, I didn't really measure the orange peel and I think they turned out marvelously!  Will make again!

The cookie is good.  My cookies are flat, not sure why.  I had to cut the cook time down to 9 minutes, and had to bring down the temp to 325 after trial and error each batch through the oven.  I would like a bit more orange flavor, so I will add more OJ next time.  Maybe the acidity is why they're flat?  Debating whether to add frosting.  After trying each batch, decided to add a bit of vanilla extract, which perfectly evened out the flavor.  The cookie is quite festive looking.  I don't like it fresh out of the oven, but once cooled, is quite good!

Exceptional cookie for a soft cake like cookie, along with a balanced taste not to tart or sweet, it is perfect for the holiday.  Color makes it festive! While I followed recipe and a few comments to add more flour which came to 3 cups of flour, I only had unsalted pistachio nuts to use.  Will be making these again for future holidays.

I was shocked at how good these cookies actually are!  I don't really like cranberry but wanted something different for my holiday baking. I had a hard time with the orange zest, so I added extra orange juice & some orange liqueur (Cointreau) to both the batter and the glaze.  Also, I found the batter very sticky, but once it was on the baking sheet for a minute, I was able to mold it into a ball shape.  I baked them for about 11 minutes and they were perfect.

Pretty good.  I wasn't so sure of these right out of hte oven, but the next day I really liked them.  I didn't put the icing on--maybe I'll try that next time, but didn't want to deal with that this time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was unsure about trying these but like orange and cranberry so i gave it a shot. They have been a hit in my family ever since, even those who were skeptic about the orange and cranberry enjoyed them. I made them with out the glaze. But plan to try it next time

We loved these.  Did not make the icing - they were great just as they were.  My 2 year old loved these the most out of all the Christmas cookies we made, which was great because they were probably the healthiest cookie on the tray!

I couldn't find fresh cranberries so i was forced to use the dried (do they only have fresh cranberries in the fall)? These cookies were great right out the oven but a little dry the next day. Might be because of my cranberry dillema! Will try again in the fall.

I made these about an hour ago and they're almost gone. I used dried cranberries & added a little bit of vanilla, and cooked for 13mins. My husband, who isn't typically a dessert guy, has eaten most of them. They are the perfect blend of tart & sweet. If you want more tart, don't bother with the frosting. They will still be great

I changed up this recipe to make it "Semi-homemade" by using a sugar cookie mix. These are by far the BEST cookies I have ever had! When I make them they don't even last 2 days. Hubby and I eat them all! For that reason I don't make them as much as I would like.

I have had to make multiple batches because every time I take them to work there is someone who whines because they were gone too fast! This is an unbelievably good cookie. I used dried  cranberries instead of fresh but there is still plenty of tart.

Well my 2 year old son loved them (he loves all cookies) but me and my husband were not to impressed with them. I used fresh cranberrys and they were to tart. would probably be really good with dried cranberrys. will try again with dried ones.

I cooked some of these for the holidays this year and they turned out great! I did use some vanilla extract and some extra orange zest. And it didn't make 48, closer to 30. and it doesn't really require the icing. Still a very good cookie!

These are fabulous! The orange and cranberry combo was a great blend. I did add more zest than called for and used fresh squeezed orange juice. I think that makes a difference. These are definitely being added to my yearly Christmas cookie list.

These were yummy and easy to make.  I used dried cranberries and only 1.5 cups, I didn't want them to overwhelm every bite.  I used the zest of a whole orange plus some extra OJ and it still was a pretty mild orange flavor, but I didn't make the icing and that would have increased the oranginess.

I made 6 different varieties of cookies for Christmas this year, and these cookies were the favorites, hands down.  Everyone fought over them, will have to make twice as much next time.  I ended up using Craisins, worked really well.  So goooood and very easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are fabulous!  A++++++!  I didn't even bother to put the glaze on them because they are fantastic without it.  Totally yum-acious!  I'm at a high altitude (7000 ft.) and I didn't need to change a thing in the recipe.  Baked them for 14 minutes and they came out perfectly.  THANKS for this recipe! :)

Scrumptious!  I was mixing the butter and sugars when I realized I didn't have fresh cranberries, but do not despair, dried cranberries work fine.  I also added chocolate chips.  Yum.  Just a little sweeter than fresh cranberries.

I made this cookie for a cookie exchange and it came out great. Not being a big fan of icing I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, added a drop of orange extract and thinned it with orange juice and dipped one end of each cookie. Terrific!! Looked great too!!

Great tasting cookie, even if you don't top it with the icing ! I cut the fresh cranberries into halves, but next time I'll chop them into smaller pieces. I didn't add the optional walnuts on this first attempt, but if I do next time, I'd cut back the amount of cranberries to 1-1/2 cups. I'd also consider buying a cookie scoop, to obtain a more uniform size.

These are some tasty cookies!  I reduced the butter by two tablespoons and they tasted just as great. I only had tangerines so I used tangerine zest instead.

These are terrific cookies! Used dried cranberries and just lightly drizzled the icing- that was plenty. A "gourmet" tasting cookie. Will definately make these often, especially around the holidays. Great change of pace from the usual chocolate chip, oatmeal, etc.

I made these cookies for the first time this weekend following the recipe exactly.  I used my food processor to chop the cranberries.  Based on other reviews, I decided to try a cookie before frosting them and decided to just put a drizzle of the frosting on them instead of frosting the whole top of the cookie by putting the glaze in a plastic sandwich bag and then I cut a little piece off the corner of the bag....worked perfectly.  I'll definitely be adding this cookie to my recipe list every year!

These were yummy, particularly the next day.  I gave it four stars because I only give five stars to those recipes that are so good, I'm willing to sacrifice friendships by spamming the recipe to everyone in my address book.  These were good, but I'd just made a five-star molasses cookie the week before and these just didn't measure up to those bad boys.  However, I didn't have time to deal with the icing (I've got newborn twins in the house), so I added a cup of white chocolate chips instead.  The extra texture was nice.  I also chilled the batter to prevent it from spreading, but I've found that if you're careful not to over-grease the cookie sheet, you won't have this problem anyway.  Enjoy!

Awesome! I used whole wheat flour instead so I added an extra egg and a couple splashes of milk since whole wheat flour usually ends up dry. It turned out great. Everyone loved it!

Wow!  What a great recipe!  My 5 year old loved them.  I used craisins instead of fresh cranberries and skipped the glaze and these cookies were the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely be keeping this one as one of my favorites.

One word: WOW.  This is one of the best cookies I've ever baked.  Light texture, nice depth with the sweetness of the orange and the tartness of the cranberries.  My husband couldn't stop eating them!  Will definitely make again during the holidays.

My oven burnt the first batch, and I burnt the second! They were still good, even though I usually hate crispy cookies. They are probably amazing when not burnt! I used orange flavored "crasins" (dried cranberries) and I would highly recommend those.

Love this recipe. I substitute pecans for the walnuts. Worth the extra effort required. They look and taste very gourmet. I look forward to making them every Christmas.

These are very good.  I put in Crasins instead of the fresh cranberries.  As I didn't want to fuss with cutting the fresh cranberries in half.  They kept there shape while baking & they turned out yummy.  I went without the frosting as these are good just on their own.
My Mom has a similar receipe, but with no orange juice or zest in it.  When growing up in Alaska we would pick fresh cranberries to use for cookies & breads.  They were as small as a pea, so they were great to bake with.

I ran out of all purpose flour and used bread flour and I didn't make the glaze, but out came these cakey, tasty cookies. I loved them. My fiancee thought the cranberries were too tart, but he doesn't usually eat fruit/ berries in general. Excellent! I'll be making them for my sister's holiday cookie party.

These cookies are awesome.  I made them for a cookie exchange tomorrow and I just hope there is some left to bring!  Nobody's fingers can seem to stay away from them!  I used Craisins in place of the cranberries and used fresh sqeezed OJ.  YUM!  Perfect and SO easy!

If you like this flavor combination, these will surely please. Love them! And, I haven't even put the icing on! I added more zest and a touch more oj. Really pretty cookie for the holidays.

These had a great taste, but mine turned out really flat.  I wish they had more substance.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, the only difference was that I left out the nuts.  Will try again.

It wasn't bad but wasn't that great, either....  Could be because I used the fresh cranberries that was frozen....???  It took so long to bake and cookies were like between cookies and cakes...

These cookies were excellent. They are very simple to make. I preferred the cookies without the frosting. When I made the frosting it came out too watery. The cookies are very flavorful.
