A wonderful and flavorful way to have eggs. I make my own tomatoe sauce so i used that, other then that i followed the recipe.We had it over penne pasta, delicious. 
I have also had it for breakfast over toast.

Yum!! This is very good. The sauce recipe is a keeper all on its own. I served these over creamy polenta for breakfast and it was a hit. Thank you for the recipe.
