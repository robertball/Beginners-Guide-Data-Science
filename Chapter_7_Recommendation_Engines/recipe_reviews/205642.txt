To really get the good mint flavor, use 1 cup of mint, and instead of boiling it (boiled mint is not the tastiest in any recipe) bring the sugar and water to a boil, turn off the heat, add the mint leaves, and let it steep for 30 minutes before straining out the leaves and cooling the syrup.  I also cut the lime juice to 3/4 cup.  I liked it, a lot like a real mojito :)

I have trouble rating this one.  I made it just like the directions but I felt it was a little too sour for my liking but I shared it with my mother-in-law and she loved it.  It was very sweet and sour so much in fact that I could not taste the mint in it.  I plan on making it again but I think I am going to cut the amount of lime juice and lime zest.  By the way, to make this recipe according to instructions you will need 5 to 6 fresh limes.

Not the best I've ever had.. I used more mint than it called for and I still can't taste the mint.  I love sour, and this is even too much for me.. its hard to eat without puckering! I probably won't make it again.

Yumm! I used even less lime just over 1/4 cup and more mint 1 cup like the other reviews it was awesome (I was looking for more of a sweet effect) plus I added another TBSP of rum and it was Perfection. It is such a great palate cleanser, nice and refreshing!

Perfection! Great balance with mint/lime by using 1 cup mint leaves.  I followed someone else's advice and added the leaves after boiling the simple syrup.  I also only used 3/4 cup of lime juice.  I'm very happy w/the result! So refreshing!
