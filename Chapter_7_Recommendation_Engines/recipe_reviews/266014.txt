While the dill pickle is not an ingredient I have had alongside falafel in the past, it is fresh and delicious and very good in this recipe.  Easy to make and yummy!  My only regret is purchasing store-bought frozen falafel and not making it myself (easy!) but in a pinch it's a fine shortcut.  Very good!
