This recipe as written is kind of bland.  Here's my tips to spruce it up.  The key to this recipe is the POTATOES.  Don't use the instant!  Make the potatoes exactly like you would to make your regular perogies (add the cheese directly to the potatoes and whatever seasonings).  My family is Ukranian and we serve perogies with fried bacon and onions, so that is what I put on the top.  When you cut into this to serve, what you are going to taste ultimately is the potatoes, so if you're expecting it to taste like perogies, you have to make the potatoes like you would if you were doing it the old fashioned way.  This is a good way to get that taste without all the work!

Try using  large sea shells and velvetta cheese (and real potatoes of course) Simply cook the shells according to package directions, mash potatoes, add milk velvetta and butter, stuff shells,put in baking pan, cover with melted butter and (cooked onions if you wish), cover and bake at 325 for 45 minutes. Yummy!

I too have been making a version of this for years - if I have real mashed potatoes leftover, I use them, but mostly I use the instant mashed potatoes, because its quick.  While I learned to make this using the lasagna noodles, I have altered it over the years to save time on cooking the noodles.  In a pinch, I use elbow macaroni - one layer of elbows, mashed potatoes, cheese, another layer of elbows, and then covered with the sauteed onions.  This is the only butter in my recipe.  I don't put pats of butter over the potatoes.  This is also a great way to make a single serving as well.  I always use American Cheese, but have added cheddar on occasion.  My one last variation on this recipe - when I make it as for a covered dish affair, I use large pasta shells and stuff them individually - a small ice cream scoop of potatoes, 1/2 slice of American cheese are perfect.  Then I lay them all out in a pan and pour the sauteed onions over.  This makes serving a whole lot easier, since there is no cutting involved.  Just pick up the entire shell.  Salt and pepper to taste and you're good to go.

This is really truly a delicious, easy, fantastic recipe.  I've made it many times in varying ways.  You can simply layer any cooked pasta and mashed potatoes in the same manner as this recipe and get awesome results.  By following this recipe as listed, I recommend cooking at least 4 pieces less of a pound of lasagna...otherwise, there's too much pasta.  Additionally, I never think that I have enough cheese with just one pound.  

This is always just soooo good and a total pleaser.

Like many reviewers have said before me, as-is this quite bland. Definitely don't use the instant mashed potatoes unless you already have them on hand (why would you?!). I made my own mash; since I was low on potatoes I used a medium-sized bag of frozen vegetables to make up the difference. I used whipping (heavy) cream, margarine, salt, pepper and dried chives in my mashed potatoes. I would also use garlic powder next time. I added the cheese into the mixture; we used a marble cheddar.I chose to use whole wheat lasagna noodles (a full box is too much; only use about half depending on the size of your pan). I sprayed my baking dish with PAM instead of greasing with butter. We topped the casserole with fried onions and used a full pack of bacon (okay, maybe that's a bit too much, but it gave lots of flavour). The end result was a little greasy (our fault, I'm sure) and tasted very similar to traditional pierogies. This is great when feeding a larger number of people without all the fuss of the individual dumplings. We would make this again.

I found this recipe quite tasty and it was a huge hit!  I used the no boil lasagna noodle& homemade mashed potstoes.  In my potatoes I used a bit of garlic powder, salt & pepper.  I also added French's fried onions to my potato mixture, and added them to the top along with the cheese!  I will be making this again!

My family, especially the hubby, really liked this.  We love pierogies, but never seem to have enough to satisfy the family, so this recipes does the trick.  It really does taste like pierogies.  

I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used parmesan, so it didn't have a cheesy enough flavor.  Next time, I will use cheddar, and also may mix a little cottage or cream cheese into the potatoes to add a little tang.

DO NOT use potato flakes! Trust me--make your own mashed potatoes just like you would for thanksgiving, and add a thin layer of ground beef between the mashed potatoes and cheddar. It's great.

Very good recipe, is a crowd pleaser.  I used my own mashed potatoes.  I also used the no boil Lasagna noodles, which I will not do again.  The top and bottom layers of noodles were hard.  Next time I will use the boil noodles.

This was a great recipe I found while trying to find a meat free meal for Lent. I did make some adjustments. I used real mashed potatoes and didn't mix my onions into them(the kids would have had a fit). The onions I sauteed with garlic cloves in a TBS. margarine and a 1/4 c. vegetable oil. These were absolutely fantastic served on top. What a great meal!

Edited 2/26/17 - This is still a fave in our house. My family asks for this throughout the year.

This is pretty good!
I used real potatoes (leftover mashed, seasoned with onion powder), added cheese directly to the potatoes, and cut the serving size down to 2. The butter was already in the potatoes, so no need to add more. I used two single-serving sized souffle cups sprayed with non-stick spray and carefully layered pieces of lasagna noodles with my cheesy potatoes. I topped it with some more cheese and bacon bits. Sooo tasty!

Delicious.  I made shells and used instant potatoes...it turned out just fine.  I'll definitely make these the next time I have left over mashed potatoes and probably even if I don't.

Delicious! I followed the recipe in almost every respect, the one thing I did differently was use real mashed potatoes that I had left over rather than instant.  Its a great alternative to making pierogies.  Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good. Tasted just like Mrs T's frozen pierogies which I love and can't seem to find anymore.  I did change the recipe a little. I cut the onion down to one and a half. Four seemed like an awful lot. I forgot the pats of butter between layers but I think there was enough butter already. I also used Betty Crocker 4 cheese potatoes and less shredded cheese.  Overall I really enjoyed it but I think next time I would take the suggestion of several of reviewers and stuff the potatoes into shells. Seems easier and neater that way and will taste just as good.

Yum..Yum..Yum!  I would easily give this 4-1/2 stars. I was surprised how much this tasted like pierogies!  As suggested by other reviewers I made homeade mashed potatoes and mixed my ingredients into the potatoes before layering with the lasagna noodles.  I used a mixture of vermont white cheddar and yellow extra sharp cheddar.  I also added some sour cream to the potato mix along with butter, salt & pepper & milk. I only used 1-1/4 large onion.  I guess it depends on your onion size - but, 4 seems like a lot!  I then layered between lasagna noodles as instructed - but ended with mashed potatoes and some grated cheese on top.  I don't like to top any type of lasagna with the noodles - they tend to get too brown and "crunchy" around the edges.  Really good and I will definitely make again.

I've made this many times. If I don't have homemade mash potatoes I use instant. The last time I made it I used instant 3 cheese potatoes and put it in large shells. It turned out great.

I left the onions out cause my bf doesn't like them. He loved the pan pierogies, I thought they were a little bland. I will add cottage cheese or something else to make the potato filling taste a bit better

Very, very good. Made almost 5 lbs worth... a bit more prep work required but well worth it. I would have added more onions because we love them and if you don't they get lost in the potatoes and doesn't flavor them much. I also added garlic powder to the instant potatoes. Very very good for parties!

I love pierogies, and this was a great recipe.  It was a big hit with the family.  I would use a little less butter than called for next time.  It made it a little too greasy.  But this tastes great!

This was a great time-saving idea! I used a layer of plain macaroni in a greased 9x13 then a layer of sliced American cheese, followed by real mashed potatoes, followed by carmalized onions, garlic, and cabbage, I sprinkled some shredded 4 cheese blend on top of that. It was delicious and filling!

I used real mashed potatoes and added garlic salt and pepper for a little extra flavor. This is such a great side dish, or it could be used as main course with a salad on the side. Serve with a dollup of sour cream. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good for fast and easy taste of pierogies. I like others will use real potatoes and I will also brown my onions to carmelize next time I make this. Cover to protect the top layer from drying out for most of the cook time. I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe

We call these Poor Man's Pierogies in my family...a staple dish.  Lots of butter and sauteed onions make it.  Easily punch it up to your tastes with a blend of cheeses (I like colby jack and cheddar).  Great for large gatherings and a snap to make.

I don't think this recipe comes anywhere near replacing a genuine Pierogie recipe or is even in a Pierogie category. It is not a "keeper" for me.

This was a GREAT recipe, and couldn't be any easier! My husband doesn't like onions, so I left out the onions, and just made some for the side.  I also used colby cheese instead of cheddar, and it was DELICIOUS!! This will definately be a meal I make all the time.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a delicious dish! This web site just keeps on kickin! I had a quart of leftover mashed potatoes and did a ingredient search for mashed potatoes and this was my choice from many. I sauted 2 onions in margerine, added to the potatoes along with 4 oz. creamed cheese and garlic. I used oven ready lasagna noodles. I covered the casserole with foil while baking. Very quick and easy for a great after work supper, served with leftover seven layer salad. Will make this again for sure!

This was pretty decent.  I was a little skeptical - especially since I was serving it to my neighbors who are from Poland!  They said it was good though and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

My Family loved it. I made a few alterations. I did not have noodles so I used tortillas, and I also added ground pork to the sauteed onions. I also added 1 clove of crushed garlic. My son had 3 helpings!

This recipe was good. I also used homemade mash potatoes for this recipe. I thought this recipe would lack a little something so I added bacon to one of the layers (pre cooked it) and thought it was a yummy addition. Overall a pretty good weeknight recipe.

Very tasty! I used homemade leftover mashed potatoes. One thing I did not like was how hard the top turned out. Ending with noodles and cheese, it was  crispy, and a bit dry. I wonder if I covered it with foil most of the baking time if that would help?

I used 12 medium (4lb) red potatoes to make mashed potatoes, I added 1/2c of sour cream and 1/2 of cream instead of butter.  I didn't use all the noodle or all the potatoes.  The casserole was delicious.

We didn't care for this recipe too much. I make alot of layers recipes with weird funky ingredients and this one just didn't cut it for me or the kids. It was edible but they said next time just make piergoies if that's what you were going for because this didnt taste anything like them.

It was alright. My expectations may have been to high, but I was a little let down. It really had a powered-potato taste to it. If I were to try again, I would use real potatoes. However, I don't think I'll be trying it again. Not for me.  -- After having this dish again the next day as leftovers, I must come back and give it another star. It was much much better! This is great, considering the recipe makes quite a bit so you can make it sunday and enjoy it throughout the week very quickly.

The closest thing I can get to real pierogies.  I added a little chopped jalenpeno to the onions while cooking them.  It added a little kick to the traditional taste.  Best with real taters and boiled noodles, too.

Pretty good alternative, I probably won't make it again.  I like pierogies fried in butter until they're crispy, this was very mushy.

I made this last night for dinner and I was the only one who ate it.  Hubby wouldn't even look at it, and my son took a bite and said he was all done.  Since past reviews said it tasted better the next day, I tried it again for lunch, but it wasn't any better.  I'm sorry but we really didn't care for this.  Maybe not use real onions, and reduce the amount of mashed potatoes.  I will stick to my frozen pierogies.  Thank you anyway.

I really want to love this recipe because I like the idea.  I found it did not have enough flavour for me.  I am going to make it again and add some bacon and onions to the potatoes and see if it improves.  It did taste a lot better the second day.

Very good recipe and not difficult to make. I used the frozen mashed potatoes since we don't care for the dehydrated flakes.

Kids loved it and it was a snap to make.  A little too rich for me, but very good.

I made my own mashed potatoes with 6 medium potatoes, about 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder and enough milk to get them to "perogie" consistency. I also mixed the cheese into the potatoes instead of laying and omitted the butter. My family loved it!

I loved it! I added sausage to the layers as well and garlic. That way it helped season those bland instant potatoes.

The beautiful thing about it is it's a great base recipe. It's a little bland, but you can add anything that you want to make it better and it really does make a world of difference. We have had a lot of fun experimenting with new "pierogi" flavors.

I make tis with freshly mashed potatoes, crumbled bacon, carmelized onions and cheddar cheese.  Layer it like a lasagna.  This recipe truly tastes like a pierogie and you won't be dissapointed!

We really like this! Don't listen to everyone saying you can't use instant potatoes; obviously none of them are working single parents with active teenagers! You just have to spruce it up a bit. We use different kinds of cheese (and lots of it), add garlic, chives, bacon bits, mushrooms, corn, peppers, or whatever else we happen to have on hand, and serve it with salad and garlic bread usually. It never disappoints, I'm making it tonight for my daughter's birthday dinner!

I mix the cheese with the potatoes and some of the onions.  Then I layer the noodles and potato mix.  I top with more of the butter and onions.  I also make extra butter and onions on the side.

I loved this recipe. I did use 4 cheese instant Idaho potatoes for the potato part but it was a BIG hit.  Used a bit more butter to sauté onions in and added bacon bits on top. LOVE IT and will make over and over.

1/2 recipe in 8x8 pan used 2 bags of instant potatoes, 1/2 box of lasagna noodles, 2 cups of cheddar.  Added 1/2 block of cream cheese to the potatoes, extra onions.  Consider some green onions in potato mixture?

Was looking for a recipe for a casserole using frozen pierogies. Found this one and followed it, but instead of lasagna noodles and potato flakes, I boiled the frozen pierogies and layed them out in the baking dish and followed the recipe. I did take other reviewers advice and added bacon and used velveeta cheese.  Served with a salad and my family of eight was pleased!
