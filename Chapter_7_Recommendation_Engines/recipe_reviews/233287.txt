Great recipe!  Resulted in a rich, creamy egg dish.  I was the only one eating so I scaled this down to one serving and baked it in a large ramekin.  I did add a little garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper.  Next time will also add some cheese to the egg mixture.  This would also hold up to other mix-ins, like sausage pieces or veggies.  Yum!

Pretty as a picture, whether it’s in or out of the individual (10-oz.) ramekins I baked this in. (These unmold VERY easily)   Baked as an omelet makes the same old scrambled eggs look just a little more special.  And just as with any omelet or scrambled eggs, there’s a lot of flexibility to make this “your own,” or to make use of whatever meats, cheese or vegetables you have on hand.  In this case I used Canadian bacon, finely chopped bell peppers, onions and the cheese of course!

I love this recipe, I've made it every day for breakfast for the past 4 days or so. I had to scale it way down and used 2 eggs, just 1 tsp of sour cream, and 1/2 tbsp to coat the dish, but it came out perfectly. I also tried cooking it at 375 degrees and the cheese came out all nice and golden, so if you prefer it that way, I would definitely say give it a shot. Also, be sure not to use too much butter to line the dish that you're cooking it in or else it all pools at the bottom when it comes out of the oven.

Just the idea I was looking for, but downsized it for the two of us. Used a 5" baking dish for each portion with butter flavor baking spray and baked in my toaster oven at 325. Used only 5 eggs, added grn & red pepper to veggies and some crumbled bacon (instead of ham). Cut back on the milk accordingly and added 2 Tbls ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Also added some salsa to mine; and omitted the cheese on his (he added catsup). Customized for our tastes!

This was very good. I did add a little garlic powder, and onion powder because I didn't have any green onions. I mixed in a bag of frozen broccoli which I microwaved first. It wasn't near done by 30 min (most likely because of the broccoli), so I ended up baking for almost 50 min.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I have had some epic fails with other recipes on this site, but this one was a breeze and turned out great! I used a small casserole dish for the eggs so I had to extend the cook time (but covered it with foil midway through to prevent the top from drying out) and it turned out light, fluffy, and delicious! We had company over and everyone loved it - even the kids!!

4.5 stars for a tasty (modified) recipe!
Decided to make amendments based on other egg dishes made previously.  Love to do a stovetop omelet in a bag, as well as fritattas of all types.
Always halve a recipe (for two of us) when making the first time, just in case it doesn't pass muster so we don't waste anything.
Worked nicely in an 8" skillet, baked about 20 mins. Sounded a tad bland so chose to saute bacon in the skillet first.  After removal, sauteed chopped onion, tomatoes and jarred roasted red peppers in the same skillet with the bacon grease.  Terrific!  
Added a dash of hot sauce to the eggs, and also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (a norm for me).   Yes, a bit time consuming, but worth the effort and will make it again.
Thanks Sarigal!

Tried this tonight and both my grandson & husband went back for 2nds  & then split the last bit in the bowl. They declared it tasty.  Husband said I could make it again tomorrow. (That's his rating system -- if he doesn't like something, he tells me I can make it again in a year or two). Added some Pastrami to the oven mix and topped it with a combo of mozzarella and cheddar.  Had to cook it 10 extra minutes as one reviewer also stated.  Very good -- easy to dish up as it did not stick to pan at all and was very fluffy.

We had this for dinner tonight, and the eggs were very fluffy. I had to bake them about 10 more minutes in order for them to set up and fluff back down. I added more cheese on top, which created a crispy crust. Hubs went back for seconds, so I'd call this a winner.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because that is how much I liked it. The dish was fluffy and light.  I was at a loss because NixieKnox gave it a one star because she said, "So basically a frittata. Let's just call a spade a spade here."  Does that mean you didn't like the taste of the dish? Or maybe for you it was just a common dish.   You see, I've never had a frittata before, and to make a comment like that is just unkind and ignorant.  I made the dish as directed and it was delicious.

I've already  made it 4 times. There are only two of us, so I cut  it in half, using 5 eggs. It is so light and fluffy. There is actually enough for 3 servings, so my husband has a portion the next day. I didn't have scallions, so I just put in a little chopped onion the last time.  
We've got it down to a science and make it in a very short time.

SUPER EASY way to make eggs for a group/family.  I had to make eggs for 20+ people and wanted to keep it simple.  We were doing pot luck and had bacon and sausage already planned.
So, I made two 9x9 square pans of this and it was a hit with the adults and kids.  Plus it was inexpensive and fast.  
I did eggs, sour cream, milk, garlic salt, onion flakes, a tiny bit of paprika, little salt and dried chives.  Cheese on top at the end.  I sprayed pans with baking butter spray...whipped up each batch (only had an average sized bowl) and poured all in...baked the 2 pans next to each other and it was done in 30+ minutes.  I choose two smaller pans because I figured they bake more evenly and faster...which they did fine.  But they Puffed up and then came back down at the end. :)  
 I had a few left over pieces, I left them in the one pan, covered them with the lid and stored in fridge, reheated great the next morning. :) 
It's hard to please a group of kids and adults...but this was great for our "breakfast for dinner" group dinner. 
I think I'll make it Thanksgiving weekend for my family gathering to.

I substituted plain nonfat yogurt and lemon juice for the sour cream. I think I may have cooked this dish a bit longer than the recipe called for. Maybe 20 minutes longer, as I recall. It definitely turned out amazing, and went very nicely with a hearty crusty bread and fruit for breakfast with company. And, it made excellent leftovers!

Being dexterity-impaired I've never made an omelet--I can't even flip a fried egg without sending it to the floor--so I thought this would be a good way to enjoy a home made omelet.  Am I ever glad I found this recipe!   I used just 1/3 of the ingredients since I was eating alone and the eggs were fluffier than I've ever had in any restaurant.  Interestingly, it took 30 minutes even with just 1/3 the ingredients, possibly because I baked it in a bowl rather than a baking pan so it was more like a 3-inch egg cake than an omelet.   I also found it very salty which is unusual since I love salt and usually add extra salt on my food so I will cut back on the salt next time.   As many others have said, you could add almost anything to it and I will try that next time, as well as use a flatter baking dish to make it look more like an omelette.   I will also use spray butter or cooking oil in the pan as I could not get regular butter to coat the pan as no matter what I did it wouldn't dissolve into a coating and it was difficult to clean.  (However, I did end up with perfectly coated butter fingers!)

This is fabulous! I made it as written and loved it. The eggs are so light and fluffy! My hubby and son loved it too. That said, this recipe definitely lends itself to adding your own ingredients like veggies, ham and sausage. You could also try different cheeses. So, 5 stars for the basic recipe and 5 stars for versatility too!

This was very tasty and fluffy.  When I looked at the recipe, I decided to add a tablespoon of Fines Herbes since it seemed it might need more flavor and it is, after all, an omelette, and an omelette aux fines herbes is classic French.

This was so quick and easy to put together. Unfortunately, I had no green onions so I chopped up some onion. Also, I halved this recipe and I added some ham that I had that was leftover.  Even halving it this had to bake for 30 minutes (at 325) before the center set up. I'm not the best at scrambling eggs but I've been adding a good Tbsp of sour cream to two eggs which makes them nice and fluffy.  So be sure to add the sour cream.  Will do this again!  Thanks for posting.

I needed to cook this longer as the middle was not cooked through.  Next time I might use a slightly bigger dish to cook it in. The versatility of this recipe is great. And the eggs came out so light and fluffy.

I just used Pam spray for the dish.  Added spinach, bell peppers and a little bacon.  It increased the baking time by about 5 minutes.  The sour cream really makes it fluffy

Great recipe! I usually add some more veggies (tomatoes, broccoli, etc) to it and it’s always a big hit with the family.

I also fried several bacon slices, crumbled it and stirred into the eggs before cooking. Very flavorful, the bacon did the trick so no salt was needed! Added black pepper instead. Delicious. I freeze portion sizes and take for a quick breakfast! Great hot protein breakfast fast!

I saw the recipe this morning, and as it is a soggy, chilly , gray Sunday, I made it for our lunch.  I have never baked an omelette before, always made it in a covered fry pan.  I will be doing it in the oven from now on although it takes a while longer to cook.  I made half the recipe.  Fried some bacon, sauted half an onion, some red pepper, and three or four mushrooms.  Added that mixture to my egg.  The cooking time was dead on  with a light, fluffy result.  I may add garlic and either tarragon or rosemary next time.   The bottom of the omelette was lovely, and came out of my pan with no trouble.  for some reason when I make omelette on the stove,  the bottom is always burnt  before the omelette is done.  maybe the cooking time was spot on because I  sauted everything before adding to the egg mixture.

Made it again for lunch.  I used 5 eggs as there are only two of us, four mushrooms, half an onion, and some red pepper.  It was a bit bland.   As I am away tomorrow my husband has lunch he can zap in the microwave.  Next time I make this, I will add a little salt, garlic and a dash of tabasco.  I like this recipe as there are no burnt bottoms.

I had the same experience as another reviewer with the oven time and luckily used the 1 hour, instead of 30 minutes to make this.  It came out perfect with delightful simple flavors.  I did add 1/4 cup more cheddar as when I opened the oven at the 30 minute mark, I added the cheddar and noticed that the inside of the souffle was still liquidy.  I added another 1/4 cup of cheddar at the 55 minute mark and left in the oven at 350 degrees  for another 5 minutes.  The texture and the flavors were perfect for this cold, raining morning.

Note for if you add mushrooms and substitute more milk for the sour cream - you need to add 10-15 minutes (I did 13) to the cooking time to let the eggs finish setting. It's probably mostly because of the milk rather than the sour cream, but the mushrooms might play a bit of a role as well.
As you can guess, I added mushrooms to the recipe and substituted 1/2 cup more milk for the 1/2 cup of sour cream.

Made this for dinner alone as Hubs was out of town. Made it exactly as written but scaled down to 2 servings. - Wanted a quick breakfast next morning.  Ohmy - so good. Making again now for brunch . Cant wait to share with my dear - I know he will love it.  Eggs are a big fave.  This will be added to our recipe box. So good. So easy. Very budget friendly AND you can clean the fridge to make it. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe.

This was good.  It would be a good fit for a few people for breakfast.  I didn't give it five stars because this is my first review and I didn't think it was like a top chef dish.  I am adding it to my personal cookbook.

I now only make my omelets in the oven! This recipe is great and the omelet turns out moist and fully. I make sauage and bacon a head of time so that I can crush it in the mixture. I love adding the sour cream and diced green chiles....so good!

I made it exactly as written but had to add about 10 minutes as middle wasn't set. It is easy and fluffy and everything you would want in an omelet.  Next time I will add some roasted red peppers, Canadian bacon and Gruyere to the eggs before baking.  I used lower fat sour cream and evaporated skim milk and it was rich and wonderful.

I really enjoyed this.  The texture was lovely and it was very tasty.  I added some chopped back bacon and it really made a super breakfast.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding bacon bits. It was moist,  fluffy and easy to put together. It did need a bit more seasoning--perhaps garlic or onions in the egg mixture. Mushrooms would also be good. I also liked one reviewer's idea of adding some cheese into the egg mixture. I had to bake it about 45 minutes before it was set. I reheated some in the microwave for dinner the next day and it reheated well.

I made this the first time for overnight guests. Everyone (including the kids) loved it! The next time I made it, it was only my husband and me, so I cut the recipe  in half, and added diced ham and fresh chives! I added some breakfast sausage on the side. There was enough left for breakfast the next day! It's simple to make, and takes no longer to make than any other egg  breakfast. Next time I'll add peppers and mushrooms for my husband!

Very delicious. I would recommend baking it the full 30 minutes. Also throwing a little meat in there like some sausage or bacon. Also a little pepper would make it good. I doubled the cheese also. Overall I think it was extremely delicious and I would highly recommend!!!!!!

Added chopped black forest ham, touch of brown sugar, sautéed garlic, onion and mushroom and used combo of swiss and parmesan cheeses instead of cheddar.  Will definitely make it again trying different 'filling' ingredients.

YUM - EEE!  I made it for a Light Lunch, when the Wife was @ TiChe.  She luvd it... ME 2! ...  SURPRISINGLY LIGHT - PLAIN - DELICIOUS! ...AND We are ANXIOUS to try Variations on the THEME ... Thinking of Limitless Combos: Bacon, Sweet Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, & LOTS More... We Like The BAKE, instead of Frying...

I'm going to make a habit of having this on Sunday mornings. As a matter of fact, I'm eating it  while I type this review. 

Turned out really well. It reminds me of something you'd get at a bed & breakfast.

Used dried chives as that's what I had on hand.

Great inspiration!
Added a few additional items to suit my tastebuds, i.e. 5 different grated cheeses, feta cheese and yogurt. Reduced quantities to ? for a light meal.

Great recipe. Had to adjust recipe for fewer servings and came out great. My husband loved it. He likes potatoes so I cut and boiled a potato and added it in the dish.

I made it my own by adding Red Bell Peppers and One Jalapeño.    It came out a tad runny but I cooked it a few minutes longer and it did the trick!   Good easy recipe for Sausage Egg and Cheese casserole Lovers!

An excellent dish!  Added some chopped ham, paprika, garlic powder and extra shredded cheese to the egg mixture before placing in oven.  Baked for about 45 - 50 minutes to firm it up though.  A wonderful dish!

Very light.  We added some cilantro to it & when baking it smelled sooooo good.  We didn't have any ham, bacon or sausage out of the freezer so just did as listed plus the cilantro. Hubby didn't measure out the cheddar cheese either because we love our cheeses. Will make again & easy to warm up leftovers in microwave without it getting soggy or anything.

THis dish turned out very light and fluffy. I omitted the green onions, added bacon bits and mushrooms. Way better than trying to make an omelet in a pan on the stove.

Great easy recipe. My family loved it. With the addition of sour cream it makes it very fluffy. I used sliced ham, mushrooms & a little red onion. If I get a lot of company I think if I doubled the recipe & cooked it on a big cookie sheet, this would feed a lot of people.

Great taste, easy prep, and easy to add extras to your liking! I added chopped tomatoes. The cooking time was more like 50 min instead of 30 min, though.

Love this recipe. My whole family loves this recipe. I have been making mine with greek yogurt instead of sour cream because thats what I had in the fridge. Works just as well. Very simple to flavor as you like and very easy to make.

I never write reviews on here but this dish blew me away. The texture was amazing, It was extremely flavorful, and it was just as good reheated in the microwave over the next few days. One change - I added maybe 1/8 cup of shredded cheese to the egg mixture. Oh, and I had to cook it longer but that might have been due to the container I cooked it in. Thanks for the recipe!

I scaled this down for 1 serving, using 2 extra-large eggs. I forgot to grease the ramekin, and I forgot the milk. It looked fine before going into the oven, but my thought was it would do just great in the microwave at far less time. It came out okay, but I will use more seasonings next time. It was bland.

Oven omelette was awesome! I sautéed some green peppers, onions, and some sliced beef links. Added a pinch of some black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and Adobo Seasoning to it and a little to the egg mixture. I used 5 eggs instead of 9. Some milk, sour cream and cheddar cheese. Mixed it all together and baked it for 30 mins at 355 degrees.

The recipe as published sounded a bit bland so I "kicked it up" a bit by adding mozzarella, sliced mushrooms, ham  and paprika to the egg mixture, then topped it with cheddar AND tomato/pasta sauce. YUMMM!!!!!

This was really yummy and easy.  I cut recipe in half but still needed to cook longer than recommended 30 min.  The dish I used may have been too deep.  Either way will bake longer until center is firm.

I made the recipe just as is and everyone at my brunch loved it. It is light an airy and so easy to make. I will make it again. I will also make this for dinner some time.

I only had four eggs, so I cut all ingredients by half, making about 3 average servings, or 2 generous servings.  I added some red bell pepper, and didn't add onion...it's a great dish!  Definitely put it on the 'for when we have overnight guests' lists. Next time I might add some dijon mustard, as I think it would add an interesting twist.

This is a great Sunday brunch recipe! It took about 45 minutes to bake for me but that may be due to me adding diced ham, I'm not sure. Will make again!

I stirred in 1/2 lb. crumbled sausage and 1/2 cup cheese to the basic ingredients.  At 30 minutes I sprinkled more cheese over the top and baked an additional 15 minutes.  The cheese was crusty on top, which we loved.  If you like it softer, just add during the last few minutes.  The omelet was light and fluffy.  I used a round casserole, which required additional baking time and thick serving wedges.  If you use a casserole that is not as thick, it will be done in less time and result in a thinner serving.

It was very light and fluffy. I added a bit of green pepper for additional taste with the onions. Might put a bit of mushroom and ham in next time. Great recipe for company.

Great recipe, quick and easy. I had left over shrimp dip so I added that instead of the sour cream and shredded cheddar.  Everyone loved it and asked that I make it again

I didn't have any green onions. so, I added in minced onion. I would like to add basil and diced tomatoes in this next time I make it. Otherwise, it was simple and easy.

Scaled it down to two servings (3 eggs) and made as directed. Perfect! Will definitely make again on days I don't much feel like cooking.

Very easy.  Just a little bland.  I'll add some spices and a little cheese to the eggs before baking.  I made the recipe for 2 people.  It still took about 40 minutes to bake
