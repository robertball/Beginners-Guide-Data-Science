I've prepared this recipe a number of times, and I've made some changes that we think improved it.  First, I omit the sweet potato (we don't like them). I add one chopped apple for each person (instead of one apple/two persons).  I use baby carrots and cook them on the stove until they're about halfway cooked through, then drain them and toss them with the chopped apples.  I omit the onion because it upsets our stomachs, but I season the apples and carrots with onion powder and pepper.  A few times, I've added small red potatoes that I've quartered (depending on size) and tossed with the seasoned apples and carrots, but the last time I made this I baked potatoes (not sweet potatoes) to serve alongside.  One thing I do now that I think is crucial to making this dish moist is to add some apple juice approximately halfway through baking. I pour it into the apple/carrot/potato (if using) mix in the bottom of the pan and stir it around. I check it again about 10 minutes later and add more juice, if needed. This keeps everything from drying out.  I also use dried cranberries instead of fresh, and the apple juice helps a lot with 'plumping' them.  All in all, both my husband and I really enjoy this dish in the winter.  It's easy to prepare and compared to many other recipes, fairly healthy.

I chose this recipe because I was looking for something tasty that my family would enjoy that had a "red" theme for Valentine's Day. My wife & I have 4 daughters that have grown up and their taste pallets have matured but they are not big red meat fans. Chicken fit the bill. I used whole chicken breasts instead of halves. After reading several other reviews, I noticed many concerns about the cranberries and general dryness of the dish so I used the canned whole cranberries which would increase the moisture content. also Besides just brushing the breasts with bbq sauce, I used honey BBQ sauce and increased the amount to 1 1/4 cups & poured the remaining sauce over the dish. the result was fabulous. It not only increased the moisture content of the chicken, but it melded nicely with the onions , apples, carrots and sweet potatoes and made a delicious semi-thick sauce that could be spooned over the chicken at serving. Although I love onions, I will decrease the amount to one onion for a yield of six servings next time. Carrots were a bit much as well. I used 8 rather than the 9 that the recipe called for. I will decrease these to six. The sweet potatoes presented enough orange color and flavor for this dish. I needed 2 baking dishes to handle the large chicken breasts. (we love left overs) I served this with long grain and wild rice, a perfect compliment. All in all, this was a very tasty, well received meal and a keeper. I will make this again when we have guests over.

Next time I make this recipe I will use more BBQ sauce (use Head Country if you can, it's the best!) and I will choose a smaller sweet potato than the one I did. I ended up needing to cook this for about 55-65 minutes but that was because my chicken was not as thawed as I thought. Also..... I left the apple peels and potato peels on in order for the fiber, and I enjoyed this dish just the same, I forgot I had done that in fact... So leave the peels on :D  Overall, VERY tasty, very unique recipe, that is what I think.

I'm confused. All the other reviews are stellar, but my socks weren't knocked off. It needs something-like a sauce. There is little to no moisture when its finished cooking, and makes the overall impression of the dish less appealing. I will make it again however. It was tasty, easy, and healthy. I think next time I will pour 1/2 C. apple cider over everything befor baking to create more of a juice/sauce.

Perfect for winter nights. My only problem was the sweet potato dried out a bit. I used dried cranberries--careful to place them on top of the chicken/veggies, if they are on the bottom they burn too easily. Quite a different type of dish for me, I liked it!

I LOVED this recipe. The flavors were amazing and the chicken turned out perfect. I didn't have carrots on hand so I used red and yellow peppers. I also served with rice and it was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to make it again.

Oh my goodness, this is a great recipe! The chicken is tender and juicy,and the whole dish has a great taste. I only made a few minor changes... I added less than half a head of red cabbage instead of the onion (it's what I had, so I used it!) Also, I went ahead and boiled the carrots with the sweet potatoes, and then I used canned whole berry cranberry sauce instead of plain cranberries. The recipe wasn't specific about what kind to use, but since there were a couple of reviews that mentioned the dish was dry, I went ahead and used the canned. My husband and I love to cook, and we agree that this is one of the best recipes ever... perfect for a cold winter day!

I made this recipe for 2 adults who like chicken, sweet potatoes and cranberries. I really liked the whole dish, the other person did not appreciate the cranberries with her vegetables. I used a lg. sweet potato that I peeled, but did not precook and my chicken breasts were added right from the freezer to the recipe. I put the chicken on top of all the vegetables. and covered the casserole dish. Everything was ready in 60-75 minutes and the chicken was not dry because it was cooked covered. I will certainly make this again. Because my sweet potato was quite large and both carrots and sweet potatoes are orange starches, the carrots were omitted this time.

Very tasty! I didn't realize that it was scaled for two, so I only used one sweet potato and one apple for my family of 6...still, it was delish! Next time I will definitely add what I left out:-) I sprinled some garlic powder, cinnamon and chili powder on top, used dried cranberries, and served over brown rice. I was very happy with this dish!

Great, flavorful recipe. It's a little like Thanksgiving dinner without all the work! I used Famous Dave's Devils Spit Barbeque sauce which gave the recipe a little extra kick and it also provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the sweet potatoes, cranberries and apples. I also used whole canned cranberries (couldn't find fresh) which worked out really well!

I can't think of enough adjectives to describe how yummy this is. It is colorful, flavorful and comforting. I made it exactly as the recipe says and it came out perfect. I'll be making it many more times and I've emailed it to friends.

I added a cup of chicken broth to the bottom and extra honey to the top of the veggies. Smothered the tops of the chicken with bbq sauce. Turned out decent. Might make again.

I finally got a chance to make this recipe.  It turned out great.  I only gave it a 4 star because a whole cup of cranberries is way to much.  Next time I make this I will cut the amount in Half.  Overall the recipe is easy to make and very tasty.  Did not deviate from the original. Will make again.

Written as is, something didn't turn out quite right: the fresh cranberries just lay there, tart, and there was nothing sauce-like, as other reviewers have said. The next time I made it, I used home-made cranberry sauce instead of plain cranberries.

I used Michelle's Famous Washed Cranberry Sauce from this site, subbing all the sugar for Splenda (which works beautifully and makes a huge difference if, like me, you try to avoid real sugar --- no one could tell the difference, either). That really raised the level of this recipe. It was delicious with the home-made cranberry sauce. The sauce is ridiculously easy and quick to make, btw.) With that sauce this recipe is super healthy and easy and tasty. 

This recipe is in our weekly rotation now. Highly recommend, with the change I suggested. I rated only 4 stars because it did need that change.

I thought this sounded good, but it just didn't work.  I precooked the sweet potato and carrots but the chicken was done well before the rest.  The apples and onions were still slightly hard.  Maybe cooking it in a slow cooker would be better.  The flavor just wasn't good enough for me to try it again.  I am amazed that there are so many good reviews.  I had to apologize to my family for this meal.

Hubby and I loved this recipe. It had all of my favorite things: sweet potatoes, chicken breasts, cranberries.. and the apple/onion/carrot mixture was really yummy. Here is a hint - slice the sweet potato lengthwise and put it flesh side down when microwaving. I followed the recipe as written and used Craisons(cranberry raisons). I saved all the leftover veggys and had them for lunch today - what a treat! I think this would be great with pork tenderloin also.

With a few minor changes, this recipe is AMAZING!! Me and my husband could not get enough of this amazing dish. It tasted like heaven! Boil the carrots first or they will still be firm! We did not peel the apples, and we did not have an onion on hand so we omitted it.  I doubled the barbecue sauce and tried to spread some on the veggies, not just the chicken. What I did was instead of using 3 cups of cranberries, for moistness I added 1 1/2 cups of fresh cranberries and 1 1/2 cups of canned cranberries! Perfect combination because you are still getting the fresh taste without the pure bitterness or dryness! Next time I will make my favorite homemade fresh cranberry sauce (You can find the recipe by searching) and that will make it even better, because anything fresh is always better than canned! I feared lack  of moisture would be an issue, but I counteracted this by adding half of a can of chicken broth to the dish halfway through baking! When it came out, it was so flavorful and moist!  The chicken broth and using half canned cranberries just added the moisture and the canned cranberries and extra BBQ sauce also added to the flavor. I was hesitant to use BBQ sauce because it doesn't sound right with these ingredients, but when combined with the cranberries/sweet potato etc. you would NEVER know. It tastes like thanksgiving spices and brings the dish together. I would recommend using chicken broth instead of apple juice for the extra moisture during baking, because the apple

This was great.  We ate every bit.  I too made 2 small changes after reading the vegetables may become dry or burned.  1) I caramelized the onions first and 2) since I didn't have cranberries on hand, I used about 1/3 cup crushed pineapple in natural juice (not syrup) to add moistness.  FABULOUS.

After reading reviews I did alter a little. Boiled the sweet potato, carrots, and onion in salted water for 5 minutes before putting in the casserole. Simmered 3/4 cup cranberries in equal amount of orange juice until cranberries popped and put that on top. Husband loved it.

I changed it so much I don’t know that it’s the same recipe. I poured a can of golden mushroom soup over it and used pineapple and mandarin oranges in place of the cranberries. I am on Coumadin and am not supposed to eat cranberries. We really like it and I will make it again. With my changes.

Was looking for sweet potato recipe that wasn't overly sweet & this deliciously fit the bill!To really improve this recipe, make it quicker & add moisture, you might try what I did: Omit carrots. Substitute some chucks of a whole store-brought baked seasoned chicken w/ some of the broth. For cranberries, substitute enough whole berry cranberry sauce to taste. Prepare as directed by recipe EXCEPT heat in microwave.

I love all the ingredients in this recipe, so I thought I would try it. The chicken came out amazingly moist! I was worried that the precooked sweet potatoes would be mushy, but they were fine. There were no fresh cranberries available, so I used sweetened dried. The carrots did not cook through. I'll try slicing thinly and putting them on the very bottom next time. Intrigued by other raters using canned whole cranberry sauce as a sub for the fresh. Looks like it made a nice sauce, from the pics posted. I would add a little something to the bottom layer next time, maybe a little garlic and cinnamon, or toss with a little barbecue sauce.

Excellent! As luck would have it, a friend had just shared part of her bumper crop of sweet potatoes, and I had lots of cranberries left from the holidays. I never would have thought of baking those together! I minced one very large clove of garlic and sprinkled it over the first layer, and I did use boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I made a quick batch of BBQ sauce from a recipe here. I was ready to pop into the oven, when I decided to quickly cook another sweet potato to add to the top! It was a complete dish and was excellent the next day cold for lunch! Will definitely make this again!

This is so good. I steamed the sweet potatoes and carrots for 10 minutes and sauté the onions. I didn't have fresh cranberries, so I used dried cranberries. Since I was using dried cranberries I added 1 cup of chicken broth. I mixed it all together with the apple in a 9x13 baking dish. I made my own honey BBq sauce from this site called Honey BBQ Sauce and just made half of the BBQ sauce which was all I needed. Excellent!

This was so easy and so outstanding, I'm ready to make it again tomorrow! I made it with a yam instead of sweet potato and for the barbecue sauce, I used some Jamaican Jerk I bought when I was there. This was just the perfect meal on a rainy November Monday night!

The different elements of this dish didn't seem to gel together. It was a strange combination of flavors while simultaneously not being very flavorful. Edible, but not something I'd make again, nor did anyone in my family want me to.

I will make it again but I will precook the carrots. They were not fully cooked when I served it. Otherwise I love the combination of flavors, especially not having to add seasonings.  Great for leftovers; one of those dishes that taste even better the second day.

Will definitely make again. I did not microwave the sweet potato for 10 min. I did it for 4 minutes. Added a 1/4 cup of water to keep all moist. Sprinkled on some salt for added flavor and covered the dish 1/2 way through the cooking time with foil.  Did not have cranberries so used a packet of salad topping that had cranberry & pecans.  Delicious and easy.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.   To those who thought it was dry,  or needed a sauce of some kind,  I just baked this covered.  I didn't see any direction for covered/uncovered in the recipe.    The juices from the veggies and chicken plus cranberry made it delicious and definitely not dry.   Also,  I used white sweet potatoes as opposed to yams.  I believe they are a little sweeter than yams and along with the apple,  they perfectly balanced the cranberryI served it with cranberry sauce as well,  perfect.

Only thing I did different was I used baby carrots instead. Boiled them for about 10 minutes before placing dish in oven. Was really really good.

I loved the flavor of this dish!  
I used a package of chicken tenders and made a good sized dish.
I omitted cooking the sweet potatoes ahead of time and used two instead of one.  They cooked just fine in the 70 minutes the entire dish took to cook.
I used leftover chunky cranberry sauce that had some bits of pineapple in it instead of the cranberries since I didn't have any.  It turned out great with a sweeter flavor.

I followed other suggestions and added apple juice half way through to keep the chicken moist.  I think I poured too much, but it was tender (and I usually find white meat too dry).  I also steamed the carrots and sauteed the onions first.  I used a more BBQ sauce than called for.  The chicken was very bland.  The individual tastes were fine, I like all the ingredients, but it tasted like bland chicken with some side dishes.

Excellent. It's like chicken with chutney. I should have thought of it this way before I diced the chicken; the chicken should stay whole fillets. I will peel the sweet potatoes before microwaving them next time - they were too difficult to peel hot. I sauteed the onions and carrots before adding them to the dish and that worked well.

I was looking for something quick, comforting, and healthy, and this was perfect! I was a little skeptical because I'm not a big fan of sweet potatos or apples used for dinner dishes but the whole meal was fantastic! I couldn't find cranberries, so I used dried cranberries, and they turned hard and crunchy; I wouldn't recommend them.

I thought that this recipe was good.  I didn't have any cranberries to add but I did add some celery. I also added some water based on another reviewers comment about it being to dry. I may of added too much water but I thought that it was still good. I think the best part of this meal is that it is easy and helthy.  I had a thought of possibly adding a little bit of water or maybe chicken broth or OJ.  I also served with brown rice.  Will make again.

Hmm... this is an odd one.  It did not taste bad, it just did not have much taste at all.  It only cooks for a short time and with no juice the tastes do not combine.  Over all a solid "Meh".  
I would suggest cooking your chicken plainly (baked, grilled whatever) and then serve with a side of baked sweet potato.  

The only good thing is that it inspired me.  I think I am going to try and create some sort of apple and sweet potato bake side dish (with NO onions).  

Also, the carrots did not cook at all.  Still hard.

I was excited to make this recipe after reading some rave reviews of it.  It looks very festive and sounded delicious.  I made it last night, and was very disappointed.  I used fresh cranberries (maybe this is where I went wrong) and it made the whole thing extremely tart.  The apples lost all of their flavor and everything just tasted like carrots.  I would recommend trying this one out for yourself before making it for others--my husband did not appreciate being the guinea pig for this one! :)

Ilove this easy recipe.  I used dried cherries instead of cranberry (what I had on hand).  I have lots of friends having babies, and this is the dish I'm taking them.  Liked that it calls for so few ingredients, but has so much flavor.  I did use a little more BBQ sauce than what it called for.

I was prepared for sweetness but not that sweet! I wanted to use whole frozen cranberries but the store was out so I ended up with whole canned ones... perhaps this is why it was too sweet? For sure I will be making it again though and here's why: I blended the left overs with the juices into babyfood for my son... he LOVED it!!! Couldn't get enough... and he's a tough boy to please.

I like this recipe, but with small changes. I would definitely suggest only precooking the sweet potato for 5 min (if at all) & that you precook the carrots at least a few minutes. Otherwise they're too crunchy. I use more BBQ sauce than the recipe calls for. And I season the chicken as others suggest (S&P, cumin). I also put the apples on top vs under the chicken to avoid them becoming mushy.

To avoid dish drying out, I suggest covering with foil & only baking for 30 min (or until chicken isn't pink). I also made a small mixture of extra BBQ sauce, apple cider vinegar & garlic powder & poured that over everything about halfway thru the baking time.

I think next time I make this I'll use canned cranberries vs fresh as the fresh are a bit too tart. Overall, this recipe isn't too hard & the colors look nice on the plate. Plus it can be a complete meal in 1 pan!

Just okay. I made this as the recipe called for and found the dish colorful, dry and lacking taste. A very bland mixture but  I would probably try it again a kick it up quite a few notches.

It was good BUT:  surprised no seasonings add; precooking sweet potatoes (?) and peeling them afterwards (?) but not precooking the carrots.  That didn't make any sense.  I added fresh thyme, oregano, salt & pepper to the dish.  Used chicken tenders instead of breasts-they were still a little frozen which added moisture to the dish.  Won't be precooking or peeling the sweet potatoes next time I make this dish; will cut the carrots in half so they will cook through.

I think it needs a bit of salt. The cranberries were extremely tart! Chicken was very juicy and tender.

Great flavor- I would maybe omit apples. I added apple cider vinegar and some chicken broth to the pan after reading reviews about how dry the ingredients were and it turned out wonderfully!

We really enjoyed this meal. I started with frozen chicken breasts and inserted a meat thermometer to 165 degrees. The chicken was very moist and perfect. I did add about3/4 cup of Apple Cider to the veggies and a can of whole cranberries. I forgot to precook the carrots, so they were crunchie. I served it over Quiona, brown and red rice microwave side. I saved/froze the leftover veggies to use maybe for pork chops another time. I will definitely make again...two thumbs up!

This was a hit.  We loved it.  I used more bbq sauce than the recipe called for and I had to bake it an hour for the chicken to be done.   I might try it with butternut squash next time and add a few chopped pecans on top for crunch.  Thank you for a great one-pan (easy clean up) recipe!

I made it exactly as the recipe. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews and the changes that others made which I usually do. It was just OK, lacked some flavor. I wished I had used dried cranberries or cranberry sauce as others had suggested as well as adding apple cider. I probably would not make it again.

Decided to make this as I had all ingredients on hand which needed using.  Added some honey roasted cashews to it.  Those eating it said cashews were a good addition as they added a little crunch.  Would recommend salting the chicken.  Also would recommend par boiling the carrots with the sweet potatoes as they were a little crunchy even though the rest of the dish was done.  Overall, everyone liked.  Good flavors and colorful dish for winter.  Will make again.

It was OK.  My favorite ingredients but quite bland causing me to want to add more BBQ sauce.  Not a good idea.  Next time, if there is a next time, add some spices.

Great concept, but really lacked flavor. I would suggest seasoning the entire dish with seasoned salt and pepper to make it simple, or use your imagination and add your favorite blend of spices. Another suggestion is to cover the dish with foil, so it doesn’t dry out.

This was delicious, and the family loved it!  I microwaved a couple of sweet potatoes until about half done and steamed the onion wedges and carrots until half done.  Then put carrots, onions, and apple on the bottom.  Seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and dredged both sides in about a half cup of bar-b-q sauce before putting on top of the vegetables.  Scattered the chunks of sweet potato then  topped it all with a cup of fresh cranberries cooked in a 1/3 C of O.J. and about 1/8 C sugar until they popped.  Covered with foil and it was all done and ready to eat in about an hour.  The chicken was moist and the whole dish was delicious!  I'm going to try it again with boneless skinless chicken thighs.

Carrots need to be par-cooked, as the sweet potatoes. I found this really needed a boost of seasoning and some salt. Still, worth  making again, as an easy weeknight dinner. I'll add chopped garlic, maybe toss veg in olive oil and herbs, with a shake of liquid smoke next time.

This recipe is simple and delicious! I sliced the chicken breasts into filets horizontally across the middle, and then brushed them with the barbq sauce, which made them extra tender. Perfect for 4 servings. Perfect balance of sweet and tart. So easy! So good!

It was delicious. I added more sweet potatoes and apples than the recipe called for. I think I will leave out the onion next time.

This was delicious.  And the chicken was so tender. Was not dry at all, as some of the reviews said.  The only thing I changed was, I added one small potatoe.  Boiled both sweet and white potatoe together (Added white potatoe after sweet boiled about 7 minutes). I will make again for sure, minus the white potatoe.

I thought this recipe was oddly appealing, so I decided to try it. However I immediately converted it to crockpot because I had no desire to cook things separately.  

Skipped carrots, put onions, diced sweet potatoes, frozen cranberries (I discovered not I, not 2,but 3 partial bags of cranberries in my freezer). Also added a cup of apple cider. I cooked them on high for two hours because I know how long it takes to cook sweet potatoes. After 2 hours, I added chopped apple, then boneless chicken thighs slathered with BBQ sauce on top. Cooked all 5 more hours on high cuz the thighs were partially frozen.

Totally delicious and moist. Will make again.

I made one change. The recipe calls for using an apple. Forgot to buy apples today. So I opened a can of Mandarin oranges.  Even my husband cleaned his plate, and he is one fussy man about food! I will make this for company too. It was DELICIOUS!!

I made the recipe as directed.  I will make it again but 10 minutes in the microwave for 1 sweet potato is too much time.  Also I covered the dish with foil while it cooked.  For all those who complained about the dish being too dry, cover it next time.  It cooks in about 35 to 40 minutes and the chicken and veggies stay moist.

The overall taste of the dish was good but it was very dry.  It definitely needs more moisture. Next time I make it I will add apple juice and use dried cranberries to sweeten up the taste.

I think this is so tasty.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, onion salt and Craisins.  I soaked the Craisins before adding them so they were a bit juicy.  I also covered the baking dish with foil. The dish’s wasn’t dry at all.  I’ll definitely make this again!

I used 4 chicken thighs (instead of cutlets) and one extra sweet potato. I also added washed fresh broccoli florets rubbed in olive oil, salt and pepper along the outside of the baking dish for the last 15-20 minutes. The green or added to its beauty and taste.

Used this recipe with 8 chicken thighs. Adjusted potato carrot apple and onion amounts. Sweet baby ray “sweet vidalia” bbq sauce and a little fresh chopped sage(just because I had some to use up). Big hit. And everyone remarked at how juicy chicken was, that it actually popped when pierced. Very good recipe, fantastic meal. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious. I would bake it  a bit longer next time - the carrots and chicken were slightly underdone.  Lots of prep work time, but definitely worth it. My husband said it could use fewer carrots and more sweet potatoes. You can really tailor the recipe to your likes. The cranberries and barbecue sauce really make it great.  Everything said, I would definitely make it again - have to use the rest of those cranberries!

I added olive oil to the vegetables, garlic and salt and pepper.  Otherwise it would have been boring.

Prepared this with chicken breast with skin on and bones in,  I decided many years ago that boneless/skinless weren't worth eating and I don't use a microwave so I just parboiled the sweet potato and one medium white, other wise I followed this recipe and it was great, a lot of flavor and very moist.....Oh, I also used canned whole cranberries because I love the flavor!  This turned out much better than I was expecting after the first quick read of the recipe.

Haven’t made this, but it sounds good.  One question - I rarely have cranberries on hand. Do those of you who have made this think blueberries might work instead?

The website "suggested" canned sweet potatoes, i've never used canned sweet potatoes but was looking for speedy option,  they were very stringy. The cranberries were too tart and took over any of the flavors of the vegetables. The chicken cooked perfectly but overall the whole dish was not very tatesty, I was disappointed.

Easy to make but with a WOW on the taste!  Pretty great looking too. Everyone wants a recipe like this, right?  I would definitely make this one for company. Loved the tartness of the apples and cranberries in contrast to the chicken and sweet potatoes. The only thing I did differently was to add salt and I gave the chicken a more liberal application of barbecue sauce.

This was a surprisingly good combination that I am sure to make again.  I par-boiled the vegetables the night before so that I only needed to assemble everything when coming home from work the night we had it. Followed the suggestion of putting the sweet potato under the chicken and only the cranberry sauce on top.  Next time I make it I might marinate the chicken overnight and try to think of someway to have a bit more "juice/gravy"...   other than that it is a keeper!

I would probably give it 3-1/2 stars.  It was good, not great. I cut down the onion amount, but that was the only change I made. I loved the cranberries and sweet potatoes together, but the bbq sauce seemed a bit out of place with the other flavors.  I noted how many people complained about dryness so I baked it in a covered dutch oven. The real problem is that the things in the dish need different cooking times. I baked for the minimum time and the chicken was slightly overdone, the sweet potato, cranberries and carrots were perfect and the apples had all but turned into applesauce.  Covering it did retain the moisture however.  I probably won't make it again, at least not as written.  (I might try using applesauce instead of bbq and see how it turns out.  It just needs something else I haven't figured out yet...)

This is my first review.  I had to write one.  This was the moistest chicken I have ever made.  (I am 68!)  And it’s surprisingly tasty, too.  The cranberries and barbeque sauce don’t sound like they would go together, but they do.  I read other reviews and made the suggested changes.  I'm giving it five stars anyway because it was so good.  The changes were:  1)  Made homemade cranberry sauce using maple syrup.  2)  Used a little over 1/2 cup barbeque sauce.  3)  Skipped the carrots.  A good suggestion from other reviews.  The sweet potatoes provide plenty of orange.  5)  Used a whole onion (not chopped but cut into quarters) and peeled apart the layers.  6)  Steamed the sweet potato and onion until they were half done.  7)  I put all the veggies and apple on the bottom, brushed the barbeque sauce on both sides of the chicken and poured the cranberry sauce over it all.  There was plenty of moisture.

My family loves this recipe! I omit the carrots and use a can of whole cranberries, and it is delicious. I made as directed the first time and have added garlic and rosemary since. It is also very good with pork chops or tenderloin.

loved this easy recipe....as written it is very tasty.  I tried it again with turkey breast tenderloin and added one box of stuffing with a bit of chicken broth...yummy.  I recommend cooking the carrots a bit before putting into the dish if you prefer them kinda mushy :)

Didn't care much for it. Followed the directions to a t.  We found it  bland with a hint of saukraut ( I know right? )  and the chicken was watery.  Might have been better if the chicken was grilled first but wasn't impressed enough with the other flavors to try this one again.

Made this recipe on a cold Montana day using all the ingredients listed except the BBQ sauce. (I didn’t have any). Instead of BBQ sauce, I added my own homemade Cranberry/Orange sauce, maybe 1/2 cup. I put a small amount of water into the bottom of the pot before adding the ingredients. I loved the texture, color and taste of this dish...Thanks for sharing!

This is the tasty dish but I would definitely add at least double the barbecue sauce. Also a little salt on top of the chicken breast might be a good idea. I used very small carrots but I guess I should’ve cut them up because they did not cook in the 50 minutes I had the dish in the oven at 375°

VERY filling, great balance of flavors.  Next time I might use a little bit more BBQ sauce, as that flavor was totally lost.

Just back from vacation and the fridge was a little bare but I had all ingredients needed for this and it seemed like just the ticket for a winter dinner.  I only added some cranberry juice per some comments about lack of moisture and because I did have dried cranberries.  Served with a wild rice/grains pilaf and peas.  I think important to halve the chicken breasts especially if large to ensure cooked in the 45-55 minutes.Some good leftovers too!

Unusual and delicious flavor combination. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because that's what was in the freezer. Would be a good company entree for the crowd that wants something different.

I made this dish as is and served with barley.  It was very high in moisture, but lacking in spices I believe.  The only thing I exchanged were whole cranberries from a can, because I could not find fresh.

I wanted to love it.  I didn't. The apple disappeared, carrots were hard, potatoes were dry, cranberries shockingly sour in the mix. "Sauce" was just like water.  Chicken was very moist, but I don't think I will try this again.

Healthy and colourful, but underwhelming in taste.  It would have been better if cooked separately, or if combining the ingredients, a sauce would have helped.

Added a bit of chicken broth but it still turned ou with no sauce.  If I make it again I will use a rub on the chicken (to give it more flavour) and try canned cranberries to give it a bit of a sauce.

I made it with chicken tenders,  2 apples and 2 sweet potatoes and all other ingredients as listed.  My husband said the chicken was 3 stars and veggies were 5 stars.  Chicken was a little dry.  Going to try it again.  He suggested chicken thighs...they are is favorite.  I also would like to try with half a turkey breast.  I will also try with whole canned cranberries as suggested in another comment.  We used sweet baby rays original bbq sauce.  Usually our favorite, but think it needs one with a bit a heat.

I did add apple juice since others suggested it unfortunately my potatoes were a bit underdone but that was probably because I did 2 potatoes for 10 mins...

It needed more barbecue sauce, but next time I will use a sweet and sour sauce or cranberry sauce. It was on the dry side.

This was REALLY GOOD!! I will definitely be making this again! After reading reviews, I took a couple suggestions. I used 2 small apples (lunchbox size) and used a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce to add a little kick to the plate. I also poured a little extra barbecue sauce on top of the dish once everything was in so that it didn’t dry out. I also covered the dish with foil and cooked for 50 mins. The chicken was extremely juicy!! I loved the crunch of the carrots! I also used a can of cranberries (other reviews said fresh cranberries dried out). All in all, this is definitely a winner and I will be sharing this recipe with friends and family!!! Thanks All Recipes!!

Very nice flavor.  I did add about half a cup of apple juice to the vegetables in the bottom and soaked the dried cranberries in apple juice before adding them.  Cooked covered for about 45 minutes, then uncovered for another 15 minutes.  It was plenty for two people, with some left over.

This is a great base recipe. I didn’t have chicken breasts so I substituted skinless boneless thighs. I used two carrots  (only had two) and two stalks of celery. I followed some of the suggestions in the previous review such as using whole berry cranberry sauce and more BBQ sauce (about a half cup) and after slathering the thighs poured the remaining sauce over the vegetables. The only thing I would add it to season the meat slightly. I think this recipe would go great with pork chops.

I tried this tonight. I thought the different ingredients were an unusual combination. It wasn't outstanding, but it was good for something different.  I used 6 sweet potato tails and cut them in quarters before microwaving them.  I also added more BBQ sauce on top of the chicken.  The result was more juice.

Used skinless boneless thighs that I had on-hand.   Easy to make in one dish.   Plenty of moisture..  I drained it off after cooking.   Left overs were good too also.

I made this recipe and was very disappointed.  It smelled great while cooking but the vegetables  on the bottom were still uncooked when the chicken was done.   I needed to cover the chicken and keep warm and continue to cook the vegetables and apples.  I finally took them out of the oven and microwaved.  The cranberries were too tart for our taste.  We threw most of the vegetables and fruit away and just ate the chicken.  Will not make again.

Excellent!  I added baby red potatoes, used already peeled baby carrots and added a bit of chicken stock to the dish and didnt' microwave the sweet potatoes, just peeled and cut them into approximately 1/2" chunk .  The tartness of the cranberries really off set the sweetness of the apples and carrots.

I read the reviews.  So this us what I did.  I cut up two southern yams in not to thick slices. I used an apple corer slicer on two gala apples.. I used a can of jellied cranberry and about two dozen baby carrots.  Put it all in crockpot, mixed it up, put chicken on top and turned on high.  I checked it about two hours in and added a cup of trop cal OJ and a cup of water as it did seem kind of dry.  Also thru in some frozen cranberries.  Checked on it a couple times and stirred. 3 hours later I cut the chicken into chunky pieces, stirred and test tasted.  I  removed the crock from the pot.  My husband fixed himself a bowl about half hour later and went back for more!  And can't say enough about it!!  
I have another crockpot recipe that has the cranberries and apple but not other stuff.  Both are good.  This one I don't have to fix a side dish with since it has veggies and fruit!  Definitely would make again.  I omitted the onions simply because I am not an onion fan.  Great recipe!  Jill S

This meal was a bit out of my comfort zone (not a fan of cranberries or sweet potatoes), but the taste when it all came together was incredible.  This is definitely a keeper and one we'll enjoy again.

Great winter dish.  I put the sweet potato on the bottom with half a sweet onion chopped up and used honey barbeque sauce and just a sprinkling of dried cranberries.

Excellent flavor. I will cook this again. Because some reviews indicated this dish was dry, I added a half cup of low sodium chicken broth and also brined the chicken for a half hour. I was very happy with the result.

This was incredible!!!  Ended up cutting the chicken breasts in chunks and then stirring the BBQ sauce in the bowl until the chicken was fully covered.  I will make it again for sure!

Use whole berry cranberry sauce vs dry cranberries.  The dish will be moist vs dry.

I see no reason to pre-cook the sweet potato in this recipe. The chicken bakes long enough that the sweet potato is fully cooked without pre baking. I thought the overall dish was OK, a little on the dry side and definitely under seasoned. The chicken needs to be seasoned first with some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of salt and pepper wouldn’t hurt the veggies either. I often make fresh sweet potatoes or butternut squash as a side dish with bbq. They compliment each other very well.  Also, I think it needs more than 2Tbls of bbq sauce. Maybe mixing 1/4 cup of bbq sauce and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and pouring that over chicken would work well? Also baking it covered for most of the baking time would also help make it a moister dish with juicier chicken. Next time I will lower oven temp to 350, season chicken & veggies, mix the bbq sauce with a little chicken broth and bake it covered and uncover it for the last 10 minutes. Bet it turns out a lot tastier!

Haven’t tried it yet but you definitely want to boil the carrots first and the adding of apple juice half way through is a good idea. chicken is done but still waiting on veggies to finish cooking.

I appreciate one pot meals (I did not pre-cook the sweet potato) and I like that this one is not drowning in canned cream of whatever soup.  This is healthy comfort food. I added seasoning  with Ras el hanout and ate it over couscous.

All in all, both my boyfriend and I thought this was a tasty, hearty dish for a wintry night. In an attempt to ensure that the chicken didn't dry out as noted in other reviews, I only cooked it for 45 minutes The chicken wasn't overly dry (although you could tell it was on its way), but the carrots were still slightly hard, and I prefer them fully cooked. However, the rest of the flavors and textures were excellent, especially the apples. 

I made this dish with the following changes/additions:

1) added garlic powder, paprika, black pepper and salt
2) drizzled extra bbq sauce (Hunt's hickory and brown sugar, which was really good) onto top of dish as well as on the chicken
3) kept the skins on the apples

My family loved this. It is quite easy to make. I substituted whole berry cranberry sauce for the fresh cranberries. I made my own BBQ sauce using the cranberry sauce. This is truly a delicious meal.

I really want to love this dish.  It has all the flavors I love plus it's so easy, but after several tries with different alterations I still feel it is lacking flavor or richness or something every time I make it.

Wonderful combination of vegetables ! after reading the previous comments about dryness I decided the cooking method was the problem and not the recipe in itself. So I just steamed carrots,sweetpotatoes, apples and fresh cranberries, while my chicken legs (rolled in lemon pepper-paprika-chili-caraway seeds) were broiling in the oven... and it was just perfect ! Also I think you can skip the onion but the FRESH cranberries are a must have in this recipe.

EXCELLENT!!! I followed the reicpe and doubled everything to make a bigger batch.  This is the easiest and very delicious dish.  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh. I also did not cook the sweet potatoe as instructed - I cut it up and tossed it with the other vegetables.  This will definitely be part of my winter rotation meals!

While we both love cranberries, we did not like them in this recipe.  Otherwise, I plan to make it again.  I used white potatoes and did not precook them, just put them on the bottom.  The potatoes were delicious.  I used frozen chicken and followed someone's suggestion to cover the dish and cook a little longer.  That worked.  Next time I will use more onions and put them on top of the chicken to flavor and moisten it.

Wonderful. I used one apple per person and did not peel the apple. One sweet potato for two ppl. Used canned whole berry cranberry sauce. Added 1 can pineapple chunks with juice. (maybe use less juice next time?) Baked in 9X13 dish covered the whole time with foil.

This was just OK. The flavors were compatable but not fantastic.
I made as directed except for pre-cooking the sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were plenty tender just slicing and cooking with the rest of the ingredients. I wish I had pre-cooked the carrots though. They were a bit crunchy for my liking.

This recipe was fantastic! So easy, healthy and most importantly incredibly tasty! Prep time was minimal considering the amount of veggies in this dish. I made recipe as is. It was enough for 4 people without over filling. Highly recommend!

It's not a bad recipe, but it's also not outstanding. It's the sort of thing that I'd make if I already had the ingredients on hand and didn't quite know what else to make for dinner. The chicken was a little dry. It's pretty easy to prepare, though.

On a cold Ohio winter day - this was a perfect meal!  My husband and I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for tomorrow!  (*for all of you non-cookers out there - this is a simple recipe to follow and if I can make it - so can you!*)  I WILL be making this again!!

Great idea, but didn't work- these veggies (and fruits) cook very differently. some were mush, some burned, and some were not close to done. If I knew how to fix this I'd try it again.

This wasn't at all what I was hoping for. The potatoes got all mushy, and the cranberries dry. The chicken didn't get any flavor from any of the other ingredients. Overall, I wasn't impressed, and the hubby asked for something else for dinner.

This was very tasty. Based on other reviews, I took these extra steps: I steamed the carrots for 10 minutes before baking, and I sauteed the (sliced in strips) onion in olive oil. I baked for 25 minutes, added 1c chicken broth, covered with foil, and baked for another 25 minutes. Everything was tender and juicy. I really liked how the green apple flavor mixed with the onions and sweet potatoes. Yum!

The best part of the dish is the chicken - it's very tender and tasty.  Other than that, it just wasn't what I thought it would be.  My husband said the it was "too chaotic" - the flavors just didn't blend well at all.  I make another chicken bake with sweet potato and onion in a honey-soy-ginger sauce that's incredible... this recipe just doesn't compare.

Fantastic.  I used a generous amount of BBQ sauce and added dried cranberries instead of fresh.  The combination of the onions and apples tasted wonderful.  Also added salt and pepper to the top.  Overall, the type of meal that has me thinking about it well after the dishes are done.

The flavors in this dish are mild and subtle. Nothing that really reaches out and smacks your taste buds around (except for the cranberries.) I felt like it was missing something......maybe some seasonings since there aren't really any. It definitely needed salt. I might end up playing around with it a little, make it more suited to my family's taste.

This is a great recipie. I decided to make it in a clay pot to see what would happen and it was wonderful. It was delicious tasted more like a desert then a main. It takes much longer in a clay pot but worth the wait.

This was very unique tasting, we enjoyed it. I would love to have given this a 3.5 rating, because it was good and tasty but not the best thing I've ever had. I made the recipe as described but I doubled the recipe. Definitely worth making, but probably will be for special occasions of when I have that Winter Chicken Bake craving.

this is a nice concept, but the bottom layer was less flavorful and more dry than we liked.  If I tried this again I would just place the fruits and onion in the dish and bake a whole sweet potato on its own.

The cranberries were a little tart for me, although my husband liked it. He also added some barbecue sauce to his chicken. Next time, I will add BBQ sauce and nix the cranberries.

I loved this recipe! The sweet potatoes were great, and the cranberries added a nice tangy taste. I'll definitely make it again.  I also added a dash of Montreal Steak Spice to the chicken, just because I like it on chicken. :) Thanks!

This dish was just okay to me. The cranberries made it too tart, with nothing to balance it out. If I was going to try this again (I don't plan to), I think I'd add more apples and fewer cranberries. I didn't think the onion did anything for it either.

I doubled the recipe except for the onion and thought this was tasty but still a little oniony for my family. The chicken came out super moist and we liked the other veggies. Wasn't sure whether to use fresh/frozen cranberries or dried?
