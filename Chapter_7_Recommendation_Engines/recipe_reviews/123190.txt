Way good. I changed up the recipe, adding cinnamon to the crumb
topping, and cinnamon AND nutmeg to the apples. Instead of dicing
the apples, I cut them into thin pieces. I also drizzled the 
top of the hot pie with caramel sauce. Great recipe.

This is my favorite apple pie EVER!!!!!  The first time I made it, I made it exactly as the recipe specifies. Though it was a very good apple pie, it needed some spice.  I now add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust mix and 1 tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkling of nutmeg to the filling.  NOW it's to die for!!!!

This recipe was good, however, I think I will stick to Grandma Ople's apple pie from this site and use the crumb topping from this recipe.  The apple filling from this had too much of a flour like taste and there are no spices in the recipe??  I added some apple pie spice, but it still needs more flavor.

Excellent dutch apple pie, everyone loved it! Perfect crust and streusal topping, especially combined with the tart apples.  I did slice my apples as suggested by other reviewers and I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg to both crust and filling as others suggested as well.  Next time I would only add it to the filling so the delicate brown sugar flavor of the streusal could be appreciated more, I may even leave out spices as original recipe states. This is definately a keeper recipe!

The topping to this recipie is great! It makes it taste like Apple Cobbler. However, the filling isn't my favorite. I take the filling from Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and put this topping on it. Fabulous!

This Dutch Apple Pie is great. I did add a touch of cinnamon to my crumb topping. My daughter begged me to make it with a pie crust bottom and it turned out to be delicious. I'll use this filling for my apple crisp and my pies. Thanks Brenda

This was a perfect Dutch Apple Pie! I made this for Thanksgiving, and it hit the spot. I am making it again for a Christmas Party coming up. I'm sure it will be a hit again, and it is super easy to make. My favorite kind of recipe...quick, easy, and delicious!!!

I made this for my husband last night. He loved it! I added the nutmeg and cinnamon to the filling like the others suggested. Very good. I'm not a huge pie fan, but this was fantastic with a little vanilla ice cream on the side. Also, I used a pre-made pie crust and cut the topping recipe in half since I wasn't using it for the crust.

I used this recipe to make mini tarts in mini muffin cups.  They were fantastic!  I just diced the apples into very fine pieces.  I only needed about 2/3 of the filling and it baked for about 12 minutes (though I did put it under the broiler to bring more color and crunch to the topping).  It made 48 tarts.

Very good recipe. I did as some had suggested and used the filling from grandma ople's pie and this crust and topping. It was the first pie I have ever made and turned out wonderful. Brought to my family christmas and everyone thought that I had made the "Dutch" very proud.  I did have to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than the recommended time

My husband is an apple pie/crisp/cobbler fan and he LOVED this recipe!  It had plenty of "crunchy stuff" he said! :0) I added a few pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar mixture while it was on the stove.  I also added 1Tbsp tapioca to thicken.  Served with caramel spooned over the top with scoops of vanilla bean ice cream.  Made for a gorgeous presentation.  Will definitely make again.

Made this last night.  Very easy to make.  I used about  2 1/2 apples, next time I will use more.  Needs I think a little more butter in the crumble for on top, so I may dab some on top.  Crust turned out GREAT!  Also needs a little bit of spice, like apple pie spice in it.  Otherwise turned out great.  Texture was wonderful, directions easy, and there wasn't anything overpowering.

My husband and I both were very dissatisfied with this dish.  It seemed to be too much topping/crust versus the amount of apples in it.  Also the lack of cinnamon made it fall short.  There is just something missing.

The crust/topping of this pie is absolutely to die for, so rich and tasty.  I was a little less thrilled with the filling - for my taste there was just too much goo and it made the pie a bit too soft and mushy.  I will definitely make it again, and either just mix the apples with some sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, or perhaps reduce the filling goo by half.  Thanks for the recipe, it's an excellent pie that everyone liked.

This was just okay.  It tasted pretty good, but turned out more like an Apple Crisp than a pie.

The only thing I did different I sauteed the apples in butter, brown sugar,nutmeg,cinnamon until the apples are caramelized which cuts down the cooking time about 15 minutes and sauteing it in the butter and brown sugar it develops a light caramel sauce/

I made this pie yesterday for my mother-in-law and followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't taste it, but my husband said it was awesome, but a little runny.

I made one today for us and tossed the apples with a little flour and it held together nicely.  And I completely forgot the vanilla extract, but didn't miss it at all.

The crust was awesome, but more of a cobbler than a pie to me.  

I also did as others suggested and added a little cinnamon (to the apples).

This is a keeper!

As written, I find it too watery; however, I use about 6 cups of diced apples in place of 3, a pinch of cinnamon, and this recipe is outstanding! I use the apples and the topping to make apple crumbles in single-serve ramkins, and freeze them until I'm ready to eat.

FINALLY!  A nearly-perfect applie pie!  This was the dessert the family fought over this Thanksgiving.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed, and we all LOVED it.  I will, however, change a couple of things next time I make it:  I'll use a regular pie crust on the bottom to cut down on the "sweetness factor", and will add a tsp of cinnamon to the cornstarch mixture before adding to the apples.  But the recipe as written is FABULOUS!

This was delicious.  The only thing I did differently is I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to the filling.  It had just the right amount of spice to me.  I made this for Thanksgiving and the family raved about it - especially the crust.

This was a fun recipe to make.  Liked the crust being made from the same crumble used on top.  Seemed really thick though in my standard pie plate.  Next time, I'll use my deep dish pie plate & I'm sure it'll be just right.  When I peeled & diced the apples, I just filled the empty pie plate with as many apples as it took to fill it nice & full.  That way, I knew there'd be enough filling to go with the crust.  Good flavor but I might add some apple pie spice to the crumble next time.  Easy as ... well I guess pie.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was amazing. I'm not a fan of pie crust so I was excited that this recipe had a different type of crust than your typical pie. I used Granny Smith apples and also added cinnamon to the apples. I poured a caramel/butterscotch syrup over the top of it when it came out of the oven. I had a million compliments and no leftovers to take home with me. I will definately make this pie again.

AWESOME!!!...I too made this into tarts with the mini muffin pan. cooked them for 14 minutes & they came out fantastic. I added spices cuz that's just how I roll :) to pack it into the muffin pan, I used my bottle of vanilla extract upside down to press a well in the center then packed around it with my fingies. Thanks for sharing this recipe...I really am not a fan of regular pie pastry so this is absolutely perfect! Oh yeah...had to double the crumb recipe...still had filling left over after 57 tarts. I used a piping bag to put the filling into the wells.

Good.  very easy.  My daughter and her friend made 5 tonight.  Not as sweet as my normal apple pie recipe but it was still very good.  I did add cinnamon to the topping and a teaspoon of apple pie spice to the apples.  The filling was so good we could have eaten it over icecream.  It was sure easier than rolling out pie crusts.

This pie was excellent! I took a few of the others' suggestions and added cinnamon to the crust and cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I did find the pie very sweet so i'll probably cut back on some of the filling sugar for next time. Other than that, everybody ABSOLUTELY LOVED this recipe! I will definitely be making this again.

Not the best pie. Not a bad one, but it has some quirks. The recipe doesn't call for cinnamon on the apples which I thought was strange, the crust is kinda starchy, and the apples are a bit under cooked. I don't think I will try this one anymore.

This pie is DELICIOUS!! I usually add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple mixture for extra flavor. I made it at least 5 times last summer. The oat crust is perfect and so easy. Everyone that tasted this thought it was the best pie ever. Highly recommended.

I thought this pie was pretty good.  I found that the crust was more sugary than buttery.  It was fairly easy to make since I didn't have to roll out the dough for the crust.  I did add some cinnamin and nutmeg just a pinch of each. I did think there was too much of that liquid sauce, it was overflowing in the pie dish, maybe next time I will try a deep dish pie plate.  Other than that it is a good basic recipe worth giving a try.

This is the ultimate lazy person's pie.  I love pies but hate making crusts, so this is a nice alternative.  I'll leave the home-made pie crusts for my mother on law, this is the pie I bring to all the family functions!  I've made this pie with peach filling also.

This recipe is wonderful. I especially like the crust. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cause there weren't any spices in the recipe and lemon juice is needed to mix with water to store the apples until they're ready to cook so they don't turn brown. I added nutmeg, cinnomon, ground ginger and cloves to the corn starch / water mixture while it was cooking. That made it a 5 star recipe!

One of our very favorite desserts.  I too added a tsp of cinnamon to the apple mixture, found the vanilla a bit too bland.  Also makes great apple crisp. Just add the apples to a 13x9 baking dish and top with the crust mixture.

The only complaint I've ever had about this pie is that there is never enough! My whole family loves it!
I do add cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple mixture as well as the crumb mixture.

A very similar recipe was in the circular years ago and has been my favorite. It's always the talk of every gathering. In the other version, it has 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts in the crumb mix,and is used for the top and bottom crust. MY FAV!!

I threw in some frozen blueberries with the apples and it was amazing.  Top it off with some vanilla ice cream and you have a huge hit.  I also included some white sugar and cinnamon for the top crust - yummy!

This recipe was awesome!! I have never been a gifted baker and pies have always eluded me.  This was easy and turned out amazing, my family loved every bite.  I used a frozen pie shell and I would have to admit that this recipe has inspired me to attempt a home made pastry shell... Great stuff!

Delicious! I will start bringing this to potlucks, etc.  My daughter even asked me to make this for her preschool class snack!  I added some cinnammon, nutmeg and a little lemon juice to the filling because I like a little tartness.

The dutch apple topping was really great. We didn't like the sugar, cornstarch and water sauce that was used in the filling. We decided to use only two thirds of it and were glad we did. Overall a good recipe - I would recommend doing the topping and making a traditional apple pie filling.

The first time I made this pie it was a complete hit, everyone loved it. I have made alot of apple pies in my life, but never one that went together like this. I did add spices of my liking. I was concerned wether the pie would come out of the pan alright because it was quite sticky around the edges, it cut and came out fine. Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did add some cinnimon and nutmeg, but I don't know if it would've made any difference.  The recipe is simple and the results are wonderful!

I used a shortbread crust and a different crumb topping, but the apple-y part from this recipe. Simple, delicious and took no time!  This is now part of my family recipe box!

I'm not a very good pie crust maker so I always use this as my apple pie.  I, too, add extra cinnamon to my filling and a little bit of vanilla.

This pie was just okay for me and that was with adding extra cinamon to the filling and the crust It's a little flavorless will try other reviewer suggestion to add caramel sauce to the top. Also it made a ton of extra streusal topping which was ok I put in into a ziploc and saved in the freezer for a quick crisp topping.

Good Good Good! I only made a couple changes.  I like pie crust so I used my favoite pie crust and made half the crumble filling for the topping.  I added a little extra brown sugar to the topping, my husband insisted it needed to be sweeter.  I also added some cinnamon to the apples.  This was so good with all the fresh orchard apples there were this summer.  Galas!

I made this pie using a bottom crust. I can't imagine apple pie without cinnamon so I added that to the topping. I used Jonagold apples. It baked up beautifully and was wonderful served with vanilla ice cream.

I just made this and it turned out pretty good! I used apples from the apple tree in my parents backyard. It was very simple to make. I added a little bit of cinnamon to the apples before putting them into the crust. While I didn't like the bottom crust (it cooked up too hard), the apples and the top were perfect! I will definately be making this again!
