This was a very tasty way to prepare my shark. Husband loved it, I thought it was a little too salty for me so next time I will switch the garlic salt for garlic powder. I did make one prep change and added all the ingredients to a plastic bag and marinated in the fridge for one hour.

OH MY! This was a great "rub"...I wasn't prepared for how thick it was and we had to actually scrape it off before eating it..but it produced the GREATEST flavor EVER! I will not change a thing to the recipe, just make sure to scrape before serving :)

This was so quick, so easy, and SO GOOD!  My husband is a big fan of shark and said this is the best he has ever had.  My 9 year old (who had never eaten shark before) said it was just OK - but he still cleaned his plate!  I did make some minor changes: marinated in a bag, used garlic powder (figured there was enough salt in the sauces), finely minced a bit of onion (no onion powder), and omitted the thyme.  I look forward to trying it as written - except I stand by the garlic powder decision!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I would not make this again.  The marinade is overpowering even on shark.  I use Worcestershire often when using lamb or beef, but I thought it was terrible on fish.  2 Tablespoons of pepper was too much, and I am a pepper lover.  In my opinion, this is a very poorly conceived marinade, and anyone who cooks fish regularly should be able to do much better.  Try salt, a little pepper, lemon, and some tamer spices like a little dill.  If you want to go Asian, soy sauce, ginger, orange juice, some sugar, and there you go.

Amazing !!! I did change it up a bit, as I had more shark than called for, that had to be cooked. Doubled the soy & worcestershire sauces, 3 Tbs. garlic salt, 3 Tbs. chili powder,, 3 tbs. black pepper, minced onion, didn't have onion powder, and omited the thyme. Turned into a " marinade" instead of a "rub". Results were exelent! Let marinate for 2 hours in a freezer bag in the frig and baked as per recipe. Thank-you for sharing a great recipe !!!!! (Will try again, as written. when I have all the ingredients)

Very tasty. My husband said it was a keeper. I grilled it on the BBQ on a small holed grill, basting it toward the end of the cooking time with the leftover marinade and it turned out delicious.

This is the first recipe I have felt compelled to come back and review.  It was FANTASTIC.  It has minimal ingredients, is quick to make, and is my new favorite recipe for shark!! My family of 6 ate it up and even the little kids liked it.

Before trying this recipe, I will admit that I had never had shark before.   I soaked the shark steaks in milk for a couple of hours beforehand to reduce the "fishy" smell (after coming across this tip online). I rinsed the steaks and patted them dry. I made the rub as directed, using dried thyme instead of the fresh. I grilled the steaks for about 15 minutes on non stick foil over medium heat. The thicker steaks failed to cook all the way through, so unfortunately they had to be nuked. They turned out pretty well. As mentioned in a previous review, we did have to "scrape" some of the spices off. Good flavor though. I will definitely try this rub on other types of meat, but I don't know that I will be doing it again with shark.

I chose this recipe for my first time having shark, and I was not disappointed.I did cut down to 1 tablespoon chili powder and black pepper as I don't care for too much hot spices. I will definatly make the rub to try with other meats.

I added half of all the spices to make a more liquid marinade, and it was still strongly flavored. I will make it again but I think if you add all of the spice quantities it would be overpowering. We were in a rush to grill before it rained so I only marinated probably ten minutes on the counter and we still loved the results. I had never cooked shark before and appreciated the cooking instructions, we got great results. These few pantry ingredients give a very complex and pleasing flavor to the marinade and I look forward to using again, thanks very much for sharing.

Oh my goodness, this was sooo amazingly awesome. The shark simply melted in my mouth and the soy sauce carmelized into the fish. I will make this again and again.

I tried it myself and and had to make an account on this site to point out how bad this recipe was. I should've known better than to add 2 TABLESPOONS of garlic salt in addition to the salt from the soy sauce. The meat came out far too salty for any sane humans' tastes. In hindsight, 2 tablespoons of actual garlic would've worked much better than 2 tablespoons of garlic salt.

In lieu of the spices, I opted to marinate in prepared low sodium Teriyaki sauce. Cooked it in an air cooker for approx. 15 minutes on 375. The piece I had was almost 2 inches thick. You'll want to find a nice piece of shark for this. Some can be quite chewy. I try to find Thresher shark when available. Usually the butcher can't even tell you what they have, so do some research first so you know what it "should" look like in the case!

delicious!!! it was too salty, but that is easily remedied by cutting out the garlic salt and adding minced garlic. the flavor was amazing besides that. we like things a little more spicy, so i added some thai chili sauce. yum!

Shark often has an aftertaste. To make it milder, soak it in milk for at least an hour (longer is better) and then give it a rinse. That being said, I cut the soy sauce in half as the marinade seemed very strong and likely to overpower the taste of the shark completely. I found it just right and not overly salty.

Great recipie! My entire family loved it, including my 2 year old. Like everyone else I cut down on the salt. I eliminated the soy sauce and sub Jamaican sweet pineapple sauce by Nells Old Time. I also added 1 tbsp of fresh basil.

Delicious! My husband, who never had shark before and is generally hesitant about new things, actually requested this again! I found it a little too spicy for my taste, so next time I'll probably halve the chili powder and black pepper, but otherwise I thought the flavor was fantastic.

Way too salty of a recipe. Was worth a shot, but could barely pit down one bite. It's a shame these steaks will have to go into the garbage. Entirely too salty, even after scraping the paste off.

I tried this recipe. It was overpowering. The seasonings are more suited for steak or beef but not shark. A simple salt pepper garlic lemon and butter will do.

Reduced all seasoning by 50% and increased liquids 100% to make mine more of a marinade, soaked Mako Steaks in it most of the day and they came out amazing.

My grown son loved this even though I made the big mistake of not using shark steaks but shark filets that were very thin.   The seasoning really over-powered my tiny filets and I think garlic powder would have been a better choice than garlic salt as it was VERY salty.  I did not use all the marinade in order to accommodate the small filets but it was still too strong.  Also, the marinade did not make a paste for me.  But I gave it four stars because my son really loved it despite my goof on the size of the shark.  I can taste its potential for a really fantastic dish if one follows the recipe's call for the eight ounce steaks.

I hate to be the first to say I didn't like this, but its true.  I followed the recipe, except cut the ingredients (all but shark) in half.  I still felt the spice overwhelmed the fish and I could even taste it.  I will not make this again. Guess I like my thing with less POW!  I just wanted to taste the fish and I didn't at all.

Way too salty!!!  We soaked the black-tip shark in milk and used this recipe; it was too salty.  We grilled the shark.  The last time we made shark we used a blackened seasoning and fried it in the pan.  It had more of a rubbery texture making it in the pan, but my son liked it better last time, than this time.  I enjoyed the shark better on the grill; it had more of a chicken texture.  I rinsed off the shark and tried it with a peach BBQ sauce and everyone liked it better.  We are going to try smoking shark next time.  Then we will try basting a couple of different bbq sauces on the shark.  I'm not a shark fan, BUT believe that I come up with the right method of cooking and flavor that we will be happy with it.

I was very happy with the results of this recipe. I had never cooked (or eaten shark before so I had no idea where to start. I made this for my boyfriend's family and everyone cleaned their plate. (Even mom who doesn't like fish!) I did do a few things differently. I soaked the steaks in milk over night prior to cooking and I grilled it instead of baking it. The milk soak was recommended by our charter boat guide in order to reduce the strong gamey flavor, so that's just a personal preference. Lastly, next time I make this I think I will tone down the Chili powder a bit. Although 2x2x2x2x2 is awfully easy to remember I found the chili to be a tad over powering.

Shark newbie. Soaked the fish in milk for a couple hours to reduce strong flavor. Dumped the milk and rinsed the fish in the same ziplock. Cut the dry spices in half and added a tsp of sesame oil and two tbsp of olive oil to the marinade. Back into the bag for about 90 minutes. Baked it for company with no promises, it was delish. Served with sweet potatoes whipped with butter cinnamon and brown sugar to compliment and roasted asparagus. Yummilicious with 60 minute ipa.

Great recipe! I made it for a dinner date with another couple and they enjoyed it.

One thing I changed: I saw no use for added salt with soy sauce. Way too salty otherwise. I also added lemon juice to tame the flavor a bit.

This was incredible! I made this for my wife and I and had 2 steaks about 9 oz each. I had so much extra marinade, I would cut it in half next time as I had allot go down the drain! I did cut some of the dry ingredients down to a little less than half, but would just cut the whole recipe in half. We REALLY loved this and it had a nice zing to it too! I ill make this this again very soon!

I was really quiet surprised with this recipe. Although I didn't think I would like it, I am surprised that I enjoyed it.  The one change I made related to my concern about saltiness other reviewers posted.   So, instead of using garlic salt, I used minced garlic.   The worcestershire and soy sauces had enough sodium, so the additional salt from the garlic salt was really unnecessary.   I'll defiintely make this again!

I had to check the recipe afterward to ensure I didn't read it wrong. It was so spicy I assumed I must have misread the chili powder as TSP when it should have been tsp. The seasoning completely overpowered the shark. A person who I cooked for who has heartburn couldn't even eat it. If you like cajun food it has a great flavor - but if you are adverse to the spice cut it back a bit.

WAY too much rub and too spicy (we like spice too).  Had to remove the entire rub in order to eat it, which was still hard to do.  Would not recommend.

OH MY!!!! This is AMAZING!  I actually could eat the paste by the spoonful.  This recipe is easy and one of my new favorites.  Where I live in the UK, shark is only sold if one is accidently caught, therefore I have also used this on cod, salmon and chicken.  All wonderful.  My next will be pork tenderloin!  I do add a wee bit of salt though.

Simple and delicious!  I only used 1 T. of each spice b/c I wanted it more like a marinade rather than a rub.  I'm glad I did that. I also used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and still thought it was a little on the salty side (used low sodium soy sauce as well).  Made homemade tartar sauce to go with it.

It was really flavourful...as others said, it is quite salty, so garlic powder is a must instead of garlic salt. Next time, I would water down the wet ingredients some.

Not bad, but not great either.  I was very disappointed that the rub/marinade completely masked the flavor of the shark.  I felt like I was eating a chicken breast.  Next time, I plan on decreasing the amount of spices by at least half, and increasing the liquid (possibly with orange juice or red wine vinegar) to make it more of a true marinade.  Also, I found the cook time to be too long, but that may have been because my shark was cut about 1" thick.

I cut the spices in half to make this a more liquid marinade for grilling. I give this four stars because had I left all the spices in, it would have been very overpowering.

I really liked this, the marinade=amazing, I think this would be so good over maybe chicken or in shrimp stir fry. I used fresh garlic though, chopped it super fine. and mixed it in with the other stuff. I also did use a touch more soy sauce, because I'm not to thrilled with the tasted of worcestershire sauce. Oh yeah, I had no more chilli powder so I used red pepper flakes. All in all this was really good. But 40 minutes over cooked it a bit, next time I'll probably put it in for 15 minutes on each side, maybe even slap it on the grill then drizzle a butter-lemon sauce on it when it comes off. This was my first time eating/making shark and I'm very happy with the results!

The first time I made it I thought it was too heavy on Worchestehire sauce, chili, pepper, salt.  I substituted the garlic salt for garlic powder, reduced the following: 3/4T chili, 3/4T pepper, and 1/8c of worchesteshire and lime juice and water to equal 1/8c. I didn't have fresh thyme but used dried. I used 1T of that then grilled it.  It had a great southwestern taste.  This is a GREAT recipe base and can be altered many ways.

What's up with all the WOW reviews and 4 stars. If you like it, give it 5 stars. I meant to use it on shark but I got to it too late and the fish spoiled. But I used tilapia instead and let me tell you, even my 18 month old and my 4 year old ate every single bite. Will definitely make it again (with garlic powder instead of garlic salt- just to make it a little healthier). AWASOME!

My daughter and I tried this out tonight. The whole family loved it. Marinated it over night, but other than that only add 1/4 cup sesame oil it was wonderful. First time doing it. Can't say how much we enjoyed it. The spice blend was fantastic.  Will do again

I used more liquids so that it became more like a marinade. I used fresh pressed garlic and no salt. Left it 30 marinating 30 minutes. It was great! We will make this again. No photos because we ate all of it before I remembered.

I will try marinating it for an hour next time!

The paste was excellent, however I would use it for Anything but fish! Talk about overpowered. Wow! I will be marinating some beef and lamb in the leftover paste and put it all on the smoker. But for fish, I'll find something a lot more tame so I can actually taste the fish.

I could eat the paste from a bowl!!! Which I have been known to do.  I love this recipe.  It also works beautifully on cod and haddock filets if shark is unavailable.  Thanks so much.  Oh...maybe grilled chicken!  Hmm......

Didn't care for thyme and it was too spicy with the chili powder ... after we scraped everything off the fish, then it was edible.  Will not make this again.

I did like the paste mixture - lots of flavor and a breeze to prepare!  I would caution that 40 mins at 325* is probably a little too long for these steaks (mine were about 1" thick).  I did cover them for the 2nd half of the time after turning them over once.  Perhaps covering them for the duration or reducing the cook time would help.  I dont regularly cook shark steak, so I was relying on the recipe recommendation.  I would definitely mako these again!

Never having Shark before, gave this recipe a try and I thought was very good.  We will be doing this again as well as using this recipe with some other fish.

I like spice, but would decrease the ratios by A LOT. I love the ingredients but the combination of garlic salt Worcestershire and soy sauce made it way too salty.

This was my first time having shark. As it turns out, I am not a fan of shark, but I'm giving this five stars for the flavor of the marinade. The marinade was excellent and I imagine would be great it you really enjoy shark meat.

This was very delicious. Like some others we used it more as a marinade for about 2 hours. It was a tiny bit over powering so maybe we'll marinate for just an hour next go round, but it definitely made me a shark steak lover!

Delicious!!! I used Mako shark steaks and added olive oil so it coated the steaks better. I also grilled it for 30 minutes. My wife and kids loved it too.

My husband and daughter are NOT FOND OF FISH. They LOVED this recipe! Score!!! I put mine on the bar-b-q on top of non stick foil on low with the lid closed for about 30 mins. (Put a fork in the center and give it a twist. If it gives way so you can see inside and is not pink, it is done)The flavor was wonderful and the texture of shark was "more like beef" they said.

This was good, but definitely too salty. But it's easy enough to reduce the salt next time. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it still made way too much. Didn't need much to cover the fish, it was so thick I had to scrape some of it off so as not to overpower it. Hubby thought it was pretty good; he likes things spicy. But this one just wasn't to my liking for fish.

YUM!!! I only made some minor adjustments to the recipe. I halved the worcestershire and soy sauce and added in a 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce. Then I halved the spices, too, since I was only using 2 shark steaks instead of 3, and the rub looked REALLY thick with even half the spice. Still, delicious!

I loved it - Perfect for me, although my girlfriend said it was a little overpowering for her.  This might sound weird, but if you put the steak on a potato roll, with some lettuce and tomato, and eat it as a sandwich, it is DELICIOUS.

I had high hopes for this recipe. But unfortunately, my husband and I both thought it was too strong & too spicy. It completely overpowers the shark. I was going to try the leftover paste on other seafood, but honestly, I threw it out because I don't think we could stomach it again.

I did not like this recipie at all.  The flavors of the rub did not work well with the fish taste of the shark.  It was like eating a fish hot-dog drenched in chilli.  The seasoning was thick and dry and the smell of it baking was awful.

I made this and it was just OK for us. Maybe I used the wrong kind of chili powder or something because it tasted really strong. Other than that, it was fine. I will probably make it again and modify a little.

This is an exceptional marinade - I say marinade because I simply mixed all the ingredients together and poured it over the fish.  In addition, I used 2 tablespoons fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder and oregano instead of thyme.  I then grilled the shark steaks on medium-high heat 7-8 minutes on each side.  It was fantastic!

I had never made shark before this.  The recipe was great.  It was very strong in flavor though.  I actually marinated it in a bag with double the soy and Worchestershire sauce. I added about 1/2 cup water to the marinade.  I let it soak for about 3 hours.  The spice seemed to be very thick still so I wiped off the steaks with a paper towel.  They still had lots of seasoning flavor so I might either not marinate them as long next time or even cut down on the seasoning in some way.  I would be interested to try these on steaks or chicken.  It is similar to the marinade that I usually use for my steaks.  Great recipe!

This turned out so well - we hadn't had shark in some time, so were looking for something different to try.  The flavor this rub gives is great, but pretty intense.  We put them on the indoor grill, and they came out beautifully.

This was a pretty good rub.  Like other reviewers, I ended up scraping off a lot of the rub before eating, but the flavor was good.  I still wanted a little more flavor, maybe even a sauce or something to liven it up a little bit.

flavor was very good, & spicy, so cut back on the chili powder if you want less heat.   cooking time was pretty accurate also. everyone seemed to like this one.

I wouldn't want to have this recipe often, mainly because it's strong, but talk about a great way to spice up an otherwise average meal. This combination of flavors rocked big time. It's more of a rub than a marinade, but whatever you call it, you will enjoy it. I bagged my mixture and let it refrigerate for seven hours. I forgot how much I enjoy the texture and flavor of shark! Awesome.

Five stars are based on my family's reviews - I wasn't feeling well, and didn't try this myself. My kids never, but never eat fish if I make it, but they all went back for seconds on this one! As shark is so much more affordable than most fish, I'll be making this again.
