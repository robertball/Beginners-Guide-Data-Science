I agree with the others that the sauce was too thin, I had to reduce it separately. Next time I also would eliminate the chicken broth. But the flavors are exquisite. Will definitely make it again, and for guests.

this was the first time using my new Instant Pot and the chicken turned out perfectly.  I did not care for the lemon taste and the sauce was too thin so I reduced it as much as I could.  I would probably eliminate the broth next time and perhaps thicken the sauce.

Decent taste, but sauce was thin and didn’t taste of lemon. I spent 10 minutes trying to reduce the sauce. Any longer and the chicken would get cold. I’m going to cut the chicken broth and wine in half next time.

I read the suggestions of the other reviews and I eliminated the chicken broth totally! I squeezed a whole lemon, not sure how many Tbsp that was. The sauce was good, it still was a little thin, I had to sauté it in the Instant Pot for a long time after I added the cream. But in the end the flavor was good.  I found that most recipes with sauces in the instant pot turn out runny.

I followed what some of the reviewers said about the sauce, I used 3/4 C of bouillon for the 1 C of bullion and left out the wine.  I also added 1/2 t of lemon peel to increase the lemon flavor.  It was great.
