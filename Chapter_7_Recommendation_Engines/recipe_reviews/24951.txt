This is good, and certainly a quick and acceptable substitute for the real deal made with heavy cream and sugar, but with all the brown sugar, corn syrup and sweetened condensed milk it is more "sweetness" than caramel-y as it should be. I let it come to a boil, then boiled it gently for about 2 minutes to make sure the sugar was dissolved.  Making a half recipe of this as well as a half recipe of "Hot Fudge Sauce" was perfect to use a full can of the sweetened condensed milk, and both sauces complemented my homemade banana and vanilla ice creams (for Turtle Sundaes) nicely.

I stirred this constantly on medium heat and it thickened for me perfectly right as soon as it started to bubble.  My family raved about it.  WONDERFUL  Thank you for the recipe!!

this sauce was really good when it was just removed from heat, but when it cooled, it tasted like plain sweetened condensed milk.

Whoa baby...this is a KEEPER! Perfect for dipping caramel apples! I originally made this by cutting the recipe down and stored in the fridge as an ice cream topping. When I took it out of the fridge I noticed it had a thick consistency. Warm it up slightly in the microwave and dip apples! Great caramel/toffee taste.

This is very delicious and very easy.  I was looking for a caramel sauce recipe for ice cream, so I tried this and was very pleased.  It is much better than store bought and much more economical.  This is a keeper.

This was very good.  I served over pound cake and vanilla ice cream.  Everyone really liked it.  I did not drench the cake and ice cream.  I just drizzled a little toffee sauce.  This recipe makes a boatload of sauce, so if you are heavy handed with the sauce you should be ok.  If you are just "accenting" your dessert you can probably cut the recipe in half.  I fed 8 people and there was lots of sauce left.  Great recipe!

I recently made the Toffe Sauce and served it with fresh fruit at a murder mystery dinner that I hosted.  Everyone just loved it!!!  Although there were other appetizers, dinner, and desert, everyone kept going back to the Toffee Sauce.  No doubt this will become one of my favorite appetizers.

This was very good...especially  if you have a sweet tooth such as myself and my husband. I did notice that it did have more of a carmel flavor than toffee. So the next time I made this I did replace the condensed milk with cream and used dark brown sugar - ( instead of the light brown sugar ) and found that it had more of the toffee flavor. Absolutely nothing wrong with the original recipe if your looking for a delicious carmel recipe,  just try replacing it with cream and dark brown sugar....hope my suggestion helps. But really you should the original first....

Since this makes a large amount, after cooking, I took half and added a couple of tablespoons of creamy peanut butter to make peanut butter sauce.  My kids love it on ice cream and pancakes.

I always like trying new dessert sauces and seen this under the new reviews. I used the calculate button and changed it to 5 servings, instead of the recipes 20, and still got more than 1 cup of dessert sauce which was plenty. This REALLY IS SWEET! However, when I first made it I was worried about the texture when it was hot. It had a soft grain like texture and the butter kept rising to the top. Once it cooled down I strained it which didn't seem to do much alone. Then, I let it cool further and whisked it in a bowl, to smooth it out, and it seemed to work. It turned glossy and caramel toffee like. However, the only thing I would be able to use this for is to maybe flavor or sweeten a cup of coffee, hot chocolate, or something similar. I just can't imagine it being used with anything else sweet! I put it in a one cup container in the fridge and will use it for recipes calling for caramel in drinks.

Sweet and simple, but very good.  I made one small addition to the recipe by adding a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  My kids loved this sauce served over vanilla ice-cream.

I made this so I could use up some sweetened condensed milk I had from a recipe yesterday, so I adjusted to the amount of the milk I had on hand, and it was so silky smooth and yummy, it would be great to dip apples in, bananas, on ice cream, or over a plain cake.

As the others have said this is better then store bought, I will make this again.

Sadly, this did taste like thickened sweetened condensed milk to me.  The kids liked it-it was ok, but not the buttery carmel-toffee sauce I had hoped for.

This is the best sauce!  I made a half a recipe and it is so good I will never run out of this.  It's delicious warmed up over vanilla ice cream and I can't wait to try it in my caramelitas.  It is creamy and not gritty at all and thickens up beutifully!

This sauce is a great ice cream topper. Although, I would consider it to be more of a caramel sauce then a toffee sauce. It tastes very homemade, but is quick and easy to make.

I used dulce du leche instead condensed milk..  Added it to a batch of my coffee ice cream---Coffee & Toffee.  I used a squeeze bottle to dispense.  If you use a squeeze bottle make sure to add cooking spray before you pour in toffee sauce.

I made this as a topping for cheesecake. I added 1 cup of chopped pecans in the last 2 minutes of cooking. I allowed the caramel to cool for 5 minutes in the freezer and then poured 1/3 onto the cheesecake and spread to the edges. I chilled the cheesecake for an hour in the refrigerator and then served. Wow! It was so good. The remaining 2/3 were placed into two small containers. One to be used "right away" as ice cream topping. The other I'm going to freeze for later use. (We'll see how that goes and report back.)

I made this to use on my scalloped sweet potatoes and it came out great! The only change I made was using a sweeten condensed milk that is Carmel flavored already it's just like the regular one only it has been cooked down longer and had a rich Carmel taste that def made the end result perfect if you can find this kind I recommend using it instead

I made this right to the recipe.  I wasn't impressed.  It tasted like sweetened condensed milk after it had cooled down enough to eat.  I then boiled it a bit longer and it was a bit better but this isn't a keeper recipe for me.

I love this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for. I was planning on filling cupcakes with caramel and this was perfect. I also warmed it up and put it on frozen yogurt. So yummy. Definately making this again.

As is I give it four stars.  It just tasted sweet and lacked flavor  I added a little sea salt and butter extract to give it some flavor.  It now tastes like a gourmet sauce!  Great way to use up leftover sweetened condensed milk.

WOW! Made this with dark corn syrup (was out of light) and it is truly to die for.  This will certainly be used again and often. It is certainly not for the calorie counter, but who's counting.  Heavenly.

This sauce will not disappoint. Creamy and glossy. Tops off gingerbread cake to make a decadent dessert. It makes a lot though, and is very rich.

I made this sauce for the sticky toffee pudding recipe that is also offered on allrecipes.com.  I took the whole thing to a dinner party and it was a smash.  The sauce was good enough to eat like candy.

I cooked until sugar had disolved, and added a pinch of salt.  It brings out the flavors.

Such a yummy recipe and easy too but wow it sure makes alot! I halved the recipe and it still came out plenty. I drizzled a little over the Mini Cheesecakes III recipe found on this site right before serving and it was divine. I'm gonna use the rest on ice cream or maybe I'll make a pound cake. 
Very easy and wonderful recipe.

Used this topping on poundcake, but I am sure it would be great with ice cream too!  Very good recipe. I followed it exactly - I did use double-strength vanilla.  I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and waited just until it bubbled and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe in a quite a few times in a dessert fondue with apples.  It was very good and people really liked it. It reminds me kind of a carmel apple type dip but not as thick.

Made this toffee sauce for my family's Christmas Eve fruit fondue. It was a HUGE hit... my brothers DEVOURED it. It was especially wonderful with pears and apples. Thanks
