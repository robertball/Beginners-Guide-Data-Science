I loved this recipe!!! I slow cooked a london broil roast to make BBQ sandwiches but found this recipe and gave it a try. I used cans of corn, green beans, and potatoes since I didn't have mixed vegetables on hand. I loved how easy this was because you really didn't have to follow the measurements exactly, you can do it to your taste preferences. And since I had the broth the meat cooked in I didn't need any broth. I will make this again.

Very good use of leftover roast.  I really liked it.  I followed the recipe, but I did use frozen corn instead.  I'm planning on making it again tonight, but I'm using less BBQ sauce this time, was a bit overpowering last time.  But very good overall.  Thanks for the recipe Amy!

I only gave it 4 stars, because if I used the full amount of bbq sauce, I know I wouldn't have liked it.  I chopped the roast as it wasn't moist enough to shred.  I first put the roast cubes in the crockpot and then squirted in the bbq, stirring, just enough for decent coverage.  I also used frozen vegetables instead of canned as I just don't use canned vegetables.  This is a good recipe to use up a dry roast.

This stew was awful. I should have known better than to make something with jarred BBQ sauce as the base.

Surprisingly my family liked this stew and wanted to have it again.  Looking for a different use of leftover roast.  I adjusted it by using a can of corn and can of green beans but I only used about 3/4 cup of hickory bbq sauce.  Be sure to include all of the liquid from the veggies.  I only had chicken stock so I added beef cubes to it and cooked it on high for the full hour.  I took the suggestion of serving over rice and it was awesome and just as good as leftover for lunch as well!  I wouldn't have tried something like this on my own.  Even my picky son liked it!

We really liked this. I don't use canned veggies, so used frozen instead. I added a cup of water to make up for not having water from canned corn, but it was a bit too much, maybe 1/2 cup at the most. I also didn't have much bbq sauce, maybe about a cup was all that was in my bottle but it was plenty, giving it just enough flavor. Used beef boullion cubes instead of beef broth.

I used all my leftovers up including the vegs that were in the roast itself. So I didn't use canned mixed vegetables. I did take out more than half the bbq sauce and added canned sweet corn to it. It came out great. I will make it again when I have leftovers from a roast!

This was great! I DID use the sweet barbeque sauce, but didn't use as much -thus it wasn't too sweet! I used a can of corn & found that this is very tasty, but much better if put over some rice or a piece of toasted bread. -Will make this again.

I love this recipe, what a great way to use up left overs! I used my leftover carmelized onion roast, scalloped potatoes, canned corn and some fresh celary, spinach and tatsoi from my new farmshare, it's amazing! I used the leftover barbecue sauces I had in the fridge, so there was a little sweetness, but not all if was sweet sauce. I might use less Worcestershire sauce next time, as i forgot it and added that last minute.  Over all, a great recipe with flexibility.

Sweet & Sour Version
Used only one cup of BBQ sauce, but it was still a bit too sweet. So I added one TBSP of vinegar. Set the slow cooker on low and four hours later the beef was very tender and tasty.

I had no idea what to do with leftover cubes of kind of dry cooked beef and pork, but this recipe headed me in the right direction.  I only had about 1/2 lb meat (leftover from a restaurant meal) and put it in a small crockpot with 1/2 cup water, 2 beef bouillon cubes, 1 T Worcestershire, 1/3 bag of frozen peas, one raw potato cut into small cubes, and a squirt of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  As directed, I cooked for about an hour on high.  Then added about 2T of flour mixed into a loose paste with water.  Cooked another 1/2 hour.  It was delicious, cheap, and a great way to use up dry beef and pork.  Thanks for this idea.  Wish I'd taken a photo.  It looked great too!

I used half the bbq it calls for and it still tastes like bbq...which isn't bad per-say... just not what i want stew to taste like.  Not my favorite, however it was something different for leftover roast...
