I tried this recipe as I was looking for a finger food to add to my christmas eve snack collection. I did not make mine into knots but rather rolled it into a log after filling and folding in half. I then sliced it into 1/2 to 1" slices and set side ways on parchment paper. I drizzled a little extra cheese ontop of each piece. 
Overall this may be a do again but i'm not sure if it tastes as good as the picture looks or recipe sounds. Maybe next time i'll add a hint of marinara sauce before rollling.

I enjoyed making these. I thought they needed a bit more flavour as they tasted a bit bland. Friends and family loved them. The pastry made them nice and fluffy.
