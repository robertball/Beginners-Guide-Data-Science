Our family was extremely skeptical about this combo. After overcoming the idea of such an unusual match and trying them they received rave reviews. I will make these again!

I thought these were different (in a good way), little guy thought they were just ok, and hubby didn't care for them. I liked the soft banana with the crispy bacon, but I think that's what turned hubby off (he has a thing w/ textures). I would probably make these again for myself if I had extra ingreients around to use up, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty good. The banana will come out slightly mushy which is great, but the bacon is too, which is not so great. The recipe needs a longer cooking time at a low temperature to make the bacon crispy for the mouth feel and flavor.

I was doubtful about these, and my sister wouldn't even try them, but they're actually really good! We were afraid that the toothpicks would burn, so we didn't use them. Instead of dipping the bananas in marinade before baking, we just drizzled/spooned it onto them. This resulted in a messy pan, but that's better than an oven fire, right?

The banana over-powers the taste of bacon.  The mushiness of the banana does not work too well with the bacon.  It was okay.
