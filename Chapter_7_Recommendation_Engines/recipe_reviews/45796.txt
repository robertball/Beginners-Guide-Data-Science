I've used this recipe a couple of times. I used it as a dipping sauce for thai salad rolls and as a marinade for grilled chicken salad. Both meals were delicious.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday bash and I doubled the recipe. It went much further than I expected and brought half of it to work the next week. I can't tell you how many people asked for the recipe! And they all had ideas for other ways to use it - salad dressing, add coconut milk and pour over chicken, etc. They kept coming back for more. I served it with veggies (snap peas are perfect) and pretzels. I will definitely make it again. It was so easy too.

I used half of this recipe to marinate chopped chicken breast which I then stir-fried with asparagus and mushrooms.  I served it over rice.  I warmed up the other half of the sauce and drizzled some over the chicken and rice.  I also served it as a dipping sauce for Schwan's Pork Potstickers.   It  was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a bit on the thin side for a dip, but it's GREAT as a marinade for chicken or tossed with whole wheat noodles for an awesome Thai pasta. I substitute some of the peanut oil with sesame oil and chili oil--yum! Oh, and use lime juice, not lemon, and reduced sodium soy sauce--trust me!

I LOVE this.  It's a bit runny as a dip, but delicious!  Very strong flavors, though, so be certain you like them all.  I taste the red wine vinegar most prominently.  I ate with some sliced cucumbers I had, and can see how it would be wonderful as a marinade too.  It does make a lot if you are using as a dip, so I think I might try it with some pasta or as a marinade as well.  I dumped it all in the food processor at once, and it was fine, although still somewhat chunky, but I don't mind it that way.  Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe!! Great with raw sugar snap peas, celery sticks, carrot sticks, etc. I used left overs as a stir fry sauce with lightly cooked veggies.  This one is a keeper!

This dip tastes just like one I found at one of my favorite natural food stores. Creamy, sweet and a tad spicy, I love it on fresh carrot and celery sticks!

I hate to be the voice of disent but I found the recipe very salty (and I'm a salt person).  If I make it again I would cut the soy sauce in half.  I also cut the garlic down to 2 cloves and added more cilantro than the recipe called for.  I served it with plain, grilled scewered chicken and fresh snow pea pods for dipping.

This is so yummy! I doubled the recipe and served it with the Grilled Salmon II. It went really well with the fish and people also dipped vegetables and bread into it. YUM!

This sounded wonderful with the exotic flavors melding and fresh cilantro from my garden.  Except flavors did not meld much and I totally agree with other reviewers that this would be much better as a sauce than a dip.  To thicken it up I added garbanzo beans (2 cans) which by definition probably diluted the stronger flavors but I could not bring it to the party as the liquid it was.  Bottom line, it's edible but not something I will make again.

Excellent!  Made this for Christmas to go with kabobs and it was the most popular dip with my family.  Will definitely make again.  Also was good with veggies.

I had rated it 2 stars: I am not a picky person. I love peanuts. I love a little kick to foods. I really didn't like this. I made it to bring to a friend's and am debating whether to go empty handed or bring this. I'll probably bring it just to get others' opinions. I didn't alter the recipe at all. It is very vinegary.

Now it's a 4 for me and here's why:
I had forgot to add the lemon juice and added it well after I made the sauce. I tasted it straight away and then reviewed. I guess the reactions hadn't taken place that should have or something. I was awful. Well after refrigeration for another few hours it was really good. Like other said a little thin maybe for a dip but very tasty. I made it again last night with half the red pepper (to suit the kiddos) and used it as a marinade. I didn't have time to marinade it long enough but the chicken was good. Next time I'm do the same (half red pepper) and marinade in the fridge for hours. Yum....

This dip was completely overpowered by the vinegar, soy sauce and garlic. It tasted more like a marinade than a dip. I made it for a party, but was embarassed to serve it, so I tried to re-do it with only 1 Tbs. vinegar, 1 Tbs. soy sauce, and 2 cloves of garlic, and some cream cheese to make it more dippy.  Too bad because peanut/cilantro is a really nice combination.

I made this recipe in a blender- very easy. It was SO flavorful. It was a little bit runny so I added about a cup of mashed chickpeas. It added texture and took the bite off. There are so many strong flavors in this dip that it needed a bit of toning down.
