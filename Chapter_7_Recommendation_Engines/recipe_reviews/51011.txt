Very good!  I took a big shortcut though, made the meat mixture, shaped it into oval 'burgers', browned on both sides, topped it w/fresh mushrooms, then the gravy mixture.  Then I covered it, brought it to a boil, turned it down to a simmer, and let it cook for 15 minutes.  My teenaged boys and husband loved it!  YUM!

this recipe has amazing potential! i made it the first time exactly as the recipe listed and it turned out ok.  the second time i changed a few things and it was amazing!  first, you must pat off the grease before moving the meat to the baking dish.  if you skip this step the gravey becomes a greasy yucky mess.  second, add an egg, some parm cheese, and bread crumbs in place of the crackers.  it makes everything stick together better and is more flavorable than just the saltines.  this is definately worth a try... delicious!  thanks for sharing.

I just love this baked fake steak with gravy but I do something a little different. I use the George Foreman Grill to cook the hamburger steak. Then I put the hamburger steak and gravy mix in a crockpot for 6-8 hours on low.

Nice Salisbury Steak substitute... I like to add extra mushrooms and serve over mashed potatoes. Downside - I tend to eat waaaaay too much of this recipe based on the goodness factor.

This is a fantastic recipe! This is a keeper because everyone in the family enjoys it every time I make it, which is about once a week. I have been making it for several years now and I have perfected it for my family. I add a slightly beaten egg and parmesan cheese to the ground beef mixture, use ground up butter crackers to bind it all together, use beef broth in place of water, golden mushroom soup instead of beef and mushroom soup, and top it off with sauteed fresh mushrooms. Browning the steaks in butter over medium high heat (to get a nice brown without cooking it all the way through) then placing in baking dish, pouring the gravy over them and baking uncovered at 300 to 325 for about an hour makes the best, most flavorful, juicest beefy steaks, but I have also just put the raw patties in the baking dish and covered with gravy and baked uncovered at 350 for about an hour. Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans or corn on the cob. Delicious!

MADE THIS UNDER AN HOUR--CHANGED MY MIND DIDNT WANT JUST HAMBURGERS FOR SUPPER--MIXED INGREDIENTS(SCALED BACK TO 4 SERVINGS) AND ADDED JUST ONION DICED W/SPICES OF YOUR CHOICE WITH THE SALTINE CRACKERS--BROWNED ON STOVETOP AND THEN PUT A MIX OF 1 CAN CREAM MUSHROOM SOUP AND 1 CAN(KROGER BRAND) MUSHROOM OR BROWN GRAVY OVER TOP OF MEAT THEN PUT IN 400 OVEN FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES--QUICK AND COMFORTING I SERVED WITH MASHED POTATOES AND PEAS.  WILL MAKE AGAIN .

The flavor of the meat is good.  However, the grease makes it almost unedible.  I used 80/20 ground chuck....my mistake.  I might try this again with super lean ground beef.

My family and I absolutely loved this! I made patties like some of the other reviewers,used the egg/parmesan cheese/breadcrumbs mix and I doubled the gravy. Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Excellent! I will be making this a lot I am sure. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this for dinner last night and my husband and picky 4yo really liked it.  I followed another reviewer's shortcut adivice and made in on the stove top (electric skillet actually), and topped it w/mushrooms.  Also added an extra can of soup and gravy packet - the gravy wasgreat over mashed potatoes!  Good recipe!

Sometimes my wife wants what she calls "plain food," and this makes the grade in that category. Next time I'll double the amount of gravy, though.

Very tasty.  Made exactly as recipe said.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to double the sauce.  Everything was delicious.

My entire family loves this recipe--even my step-son who hates mushrooms (he just picks around them).  This is definitely one of my favorite recipes for those nights I just want something easy to cook.  Plus the leftovers are great for lunch the next day.

I tried this recipe as written.  I have a guest at the moment and my daughter has been going on and on about my cooking abilities, and though he has seen most of them, they were very POORLY represented in this dish.  I recall reading the reviews and thinking this would be an easy dish, and though it was easy to prepare, it was a very disappointing dish.

I found this recipe delicious! It also pleased my boyfriend and 3 year old daughter, who are very picky. I did the shortcut the first reader suggested, and instead of beef and mushroom soup (since we don't like mushrooms) I used french onion. It was great! Thanks for the spectacular recipe, it became an instant favorite in my house.

For flavor everyone gave it a three star, but it is getting a one because of the amount of work involved.  I should have followed another reviews suggestion of patting off the grease after cooking.  Too much grease involved.

This was good but not great. My husband thought the hamburger was too dry. I used extra lean ground round so that might be the problem. Again as with most of the recipes that have a gravy with them it should be doubled. My family LOVES gravy. I made the dish with butter noodles and I thought it was just fine. I will make it again and pass it on to my daughter.

I followed advice from other reviews and skipped the process of pressing the meat mixture into the pan. Instead I made hand pressed patties. I also skipped the oil, and fried them in a nonstick pan. To thicken the gravy before pouring over the patties, I added 2 Tablespoons of flour. I changed the recipe to serve 20, so I could use 5 lbs of meat. I then froze half of the uncooked patties for a future meal (saves time). This would make great meatballs as well. Thanks!!

I honestly can't tell you how the "fake steak" tasted. Seriously, the whole batch disappeared literally in front of my eyes and I got told it was AWESOME! I can tell you my family wants this again and says it's a keeper. I did taste the last of the gravy and that was great.  This recipe was really neat to put together. I followed to a T and I worried about so seasonings to the flour, but because I didn't get to taste the steak...it must have turned out great the way the family went to town over it. I will say, I'm making the gravy this way for other salisbury steak recipes or just over some mashed taters. Because it was the best salisbury gravy ever. Thank you very much. My family appreciates it! The recipe was really simple. And I like the fact of pressing it out into a jelly roll style baking pan.

This is one of the very best recipes that I have tried for ground beef.  I made this according to instructions but also added a tin of beef broth and ommitted the water.  My family loved it - will make it again thats for sure.

This made an ok salisbury steak.  The reason for only 2 stars is the amount of prep work that goes into fixing it.  By the time I put the steak together, chilled it overnight, browned it, and then baked it, it just wasn't worth it.  It's just as easy to buy the frozen salisbury steak, the taste is about the same. (which I like, by the way.)  :)

This is a great recipe!  These patties are so tender and flavorful, I was really surprised at the light texture.  My kids and my husband loved them over egg noodles!  It will be a regular in my kitchen.

As mentioned before, this is nothing like steak but more like a cross between salisbury steak and meatloaf. The flavor is good but I didn't feel the results were worth the hassle of making this.

My family loved it, especially my teenaged cousins and my own teenagers, lol.  I did use a little gravy flour to thicken the gravy.  It was a cross between salsbury steak and meatloaf.

Simply delicious!!! Why does an awesome recipe like this one has only four stars?!  If I could I would give it 10 stars. I followed other reviewers suggestions and after browning the meat on the stove I added the rest of the ingridients along with some chopped fresh mushrooms and simmer it for 15 min and voila! ready to eat, it's 108 degrees outside and the last thing I want to do is turn on my oven for almost an hour to heat my small kitchen for the rest of the day.....

Finally got around to making this...it's really tasty! I added some additional sliced onions and sliced mushrooms when baking, as well as made my own gravy instead of using the packaged stuff...
Cut into 12 large squares, so essentially 12 meals...like the other lady said, don't let the time scare you...it's really simple to put together and well worth the time!

It is a lot like Salisbury Steak. I used beef broth and it worked well. I made mashed potatoes with it.

I knew this wasn't going to be gourmet, but I was hoping for a little more flavor. I think I prefer the slow cooker Salisbury steak recipe on this site. Thanks, anyway!

very good indeed. One of the spices i used though was lawry salt. we love that spice. and i forgot to buy the br. gravy so i just used a big square of beef consomme and a few shakes of maggi seasoning for gravies. and it turned out excellent. the 3lbs of hamb. was a little too much, only had room in my pan for 6 patties. i also didnt get to keep it in the refridgerator like i was sapposed to. but it didnt hurt it. So instead of messing with the jelly role pan i just made large patties. but it turned out well. I ran a search on the "serve with ideas" and found a hash br. recipie that i also made with it. it went well with it except u couldnt put it on the same plate because of the juices or gravy. i will review it also, i believe its called "potatoe caserole II" bye Bea. my whole family enjoyed this recipie. will make it again.

Very Good !  A nice alternative to use ground beef.  I used cream of chicken soup and it was great.  As mentioned above, you can shape in to patties and make in one skillet on the top of the stove.

My family loved this!!  I have a little guy who is very picky, and getting him to eat meat is like pulling teeth.  He DEVOURED this, and asked for seconds.  It's a nice simple meal, with a good taste, even if it's not steak :o)

The name may not be quite right,(it in no way reminds one of steak), but the flavor wasn't bad. I could not find the mushroom soup with beef, so I used the mushroom soup and some beef granuels,which worked fine. I won't make this again though...sorry....

This was awesome!  The only problem we ran into was that the gravy needed to be thicker and more gravy like.  But the taste was great (we added a bit of cayenne) and it was a filling meal!

This recipe was pretty good. When I make it again I will use 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 can and 1 1/12 cups water. The gravy was quite runny, but the flavor was good.

We changed the servings to feed 70 people for an appreciation dinner and got lots of great comments on it!  We served it with rice and the gravy went well with it!  Many people asked for the recipe!

I made this tonight and the whole family loved it! I used bread crumbs and a package of lipton onion soup mix instead of crackers. After reading all of the reviews, it seems that this recipe is one that is easily modified per personal taste-and it still tastes great. I will make more gravy next time!
