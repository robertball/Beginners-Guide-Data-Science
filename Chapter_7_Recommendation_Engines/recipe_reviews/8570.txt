I really liked the relish, it was delicious! However, the spices didn't permeate our chicken as much as I'd hoped for. We marinated for a couple of hours, but perhaps overnight would be better.

Very tasty. Cucumber and pepper relish is a nice contrast to the spice of the chicken.

I made this last night and it was a hit!! I sliced up the chicken breast after grilling them and used them in wraps with the salsa.  Served Mexican Rice on the side with red beans and corn.  Delicious!!!

EXCELLENT!  I used thin sliced breasts, so that we could put em' on a bun topped with the relish.  SOOOO good, and not to mention low cal.  I used the extra relish on brats the next day & it was equally as good.  Good recipe, thanks Fiona!!

This is the first recipe I tried from this website and now I am hooked!  I grilled the chicken on my Weber and it was so juicy and tender.  The cucumber relish added a fresh, crunchy zest to the dish.  A definate "keeper"!

I marinated the chicken for 24 hrs.  Grilled for about 6 minutes per side.  Chicken was delicious and moist.  I added a little salt and pepper to the relish and a little italian dressing.  Keeper.

The flavors in the salsa just didn't mesh.  The chicken would have probably been better if it had been marinading overnight. I don't think I'd make this again.

I thought this recipe was okay; My husband liked it.  The relish needs something;  I think next time I will add chopped pinneapple.  IT's good with fresh sald and  corn on the cob.

I liked the idea! I added a provolone slice on top of the grilled chicken, changed the relish by adding diced radishes, subbed jalapeno for yellow pepper, substituted the parsley by adding cilantro, sprinkled with lemon peeper and 1 t of lime juice! Very good! Thank you!

Great dish.  Add some salt and pepper to the rub.  Also make a little more and inject the chicken breasts with the mixture.  I didn't change the relish at all, the cool cucumbers and peppers was a nice contrast to the spice of the chicken.

Not too impressed with this recipe.  The salsa worked after some major doctoring (added more onion, cilantro, pineapple, rice vinegar and a splash of lime juice).  But very boring without help.  The chicken was nothing too special.

This was very good!  I made it as stated, but sliced the chicken after it was done and served it in wraps with the relish.  I also grilled some corn on the cob to go with it.  The family loved it and it was very healthy!

I didn't think the salsa had enough flavor.  My husband thought it was spicy.  If I make it again I will add cilantro.

this was awesome, i changed it up a bit and added cajun spice and black pepper to the rub, the relish added a nice crisp fresh taste.  My husband gave it a 5 out of 5 saying it was a party in his mouth.  I will definately try this dish again maybe with pork or steak.

I liked it alot.  I did seasons the chicken breasts and relish with fresh ground pepper (you gotta have it...lol...) and garlic salt in addition to the other spices.  I did serve the relish right on top of the breast.  I served it with Rice Pilaf and it made a great meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

Even with a few tweaks, this was still pretty mediocre. I marinated the chicken for about 16 hours (added a little garlic powder to the mix), used fresh cilantro instead of parsley, and also squeezed half a lime into the relish. I probably should have pounded the chicken thinner so that it absorbed more flavor (also could have added some Chipotle powder), and some fresh jalapeno would have been a nice addition to the relish. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

This is a great base recipe. The spice of the chicken meshes well with the cool relish. However, I did wind up making some changes to add more of a kick to the dish. To the relish I added - 1 finely chopped jalapeno and juice from 1 lime. I also substituted the parsley for fresh cilantro. It gave the dish a slightly southwestern flavor, but it really went well with the chili and cumin flavors in the chicken. I also recommend making the salsa ahead and letting it chill for a few hours so the flavors have enough time to blend.

I loved this recipe.  Only changed one thing, we love our chicken marinated in Italian dressing, so I added a couple of tablespoons of that to the marinade.  Gave it great flavor.  I recommend trying this recipe.

After reading reviews I added italian dressing both to the meat marinade and the relish.  I used pork chops rather than chicken and broiled them in the oven.  Very tasty!

The chicken was good, but not a whole lot of flavor.  I thought the relish topping was just out of place, it didn't really bring the meal together.  It was fun to make though!

This recipe is a bit bland I double the cumin and chili but it didn't work for me. I added a bit of garlic salt to give it a little more flavor. For the relish I added a bit of cider vinegar and it was fairly okay. I am not sure if I will this again.

Delicious and healthy! Just what I was looking for! Hubby (not a health nut) loved it as well.
I added a tsp of oil to the relish, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Just from looking at it I can tell it needs vinegar or emon juice to add to relish.  Just oil is too plain

My instincts told me this dish was going to be bland.  I should have listened to myself -- or better yet, looked at the second page of reviews...Very bland. I had to add lime to the relish and salt. It looked pretty, tho, but definitely not a keeper for me.

I was just not impressed with this recipe. I thought the relish was bland and the chicken simply a little flavored with the cumin rub. Marinade works better.

I enjoyed the pairing, but I needed just a tad more seasoning for the relish. A great combo though! And I was able to make chicken salad by grinding the leftover chicken and blending with the relish. Refreshing!

Cucumber and perpper relish was so delicious! So refreshing - it wasn't too filling, Definitely recommended!

The rub for the chicken is is good as shown, but I like things a little more spicy.  I especially like the Cucumber and Pepper Relish.  I've added as a topping to sandwiches & chicken sausage.  The recipe is mild in flavor, but easily can be adjusted to taste.  I increased the amount of cumin and chili powder and also added a 1/2 a jalapeno.

This was easy to prepare. I used cilantro instead of parsley because that's what I had available and glad I did since the flavor is a little underwhelming (even with thin chicken breasts).  I like, however, that it's a healthy meal and low in sodium.  I'll make it again just for those reasons alone.

I made a few additions to suit our tastes.  I added 2 jalapeno peppers cut finely as well as 2 mango's and then added juice from 2 limes.    I also substituted cilantro for the parsley.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing.

It was a nice change for grilling. The rub was very mild flavored, and I think needs to be kicked up some... maybe some garlic or salt? The salsa was a nice option, especially in the summer.

What a lovely fresh idea for some new flavors. Cilantro would be good too but I use that for many things so the parsley was a refreshing change. I did throw in some lime and a touch of sea salt to the salsa. Yum! Great Whole food recipe.

The chicken itself was good, and the relish added a helpful touch.

My family and I LOVED this recipe. Made exact to the recipe....Not only was it easy but had a small "zip" to it-like it took me a while to make...very nice. We will make this again for sure!

I added a tablespoon of olive oil, a tablespoon of white balsamic vingegar, a tablespoon of dill, and one packet of truvia (sweetenter). My fiance and I were eating it with a spoon! Will definitely make this again.

My husband gives it five stars of excellence! Although he's more of a sauce person he absolutely loved the relish! I was worried it might be bland, but it packed a punch! The chicken was juicy and the dish came together quickly and easily.

Incredibly tasty. Chicken was very juicy and tender and the relish was a nice blend of spice and cool refreshing cucumber.

I didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh cilantro, then added some lime zest, and the juice of a lime.  Fabulous!!  I also used this relish to serve with flatbread and hummus.  Everyone raved!

I liked the relish concept, but I felt it was too dry. I added some rice vinegar and lemon juice to pep it up and keep it moist. Since I didn't have time to marinade, i wrapped the chicken in foil with the rub and it got nice and juicy. The chicken flavor was very subtle. I will increase the amounts next time and maybe add some garlic. Overall pleasing and easy recipe.

I love cucumbers so I thought I would try this relish.  I bought the ingrediants without reading the reviews.  Once I got home and tried the relish, I thought it tasted a bit dry.  I added some fresh squeezed lime juice and threw in some peaches as I was making some white sangria anyway.  I can't wait to surprise my husband with this when he comes home.  I know he is going to love it.  It is so fresh and just a bit sweet with a nice kick at the end. I love a dish that entertains my tastebuds.

I really enjoyed the cucumber-pepper relish, but the chicken lacked ANY flavor after 3hrs marinating.

REALLY good. I made a few exceptions--I made it with boneless thighs, because they have more flavor and aren't dry like the chicken breasts. Everyone shoves chicken breasts down my throat for "calorie-saving" purposes, but there are only a few more calories than chicken breast in thighs and they're much moister and not tough. I marinated them for a day and a half, and they were AWESOME. The marinade, combined with the cucumber relish, is REALLY a new and interesting flavor!!! And the cucumber relish is SOOOO refreshing! I can't wait to make this again. ?
