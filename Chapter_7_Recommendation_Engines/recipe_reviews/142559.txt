The only changes I made were to use McCormick's Chipotle powder, and I didn't bother with the lettuce. I served it over plain white rice, and although it was a bit too spicy for me, Husband especially enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was a truly fantastic dish! My husband said it was the best pork dish he's ever had, and my picky daughter even loved it. The only thing I changed is that I used fresh carrot ribbons and green onions instead of the peppers and onions, just because that's what I had on hand. We used Naan bread and ate it like a wrap.

Very good! The only change I made was to cube up sirloin pork chops that I had to use up instead of using tenderloin. Has quite a bit of kick to it, but full of flavor. Yum. Thanks :)

I give this 5 stars for the spicy pork mixture. I really didn't like it parked on the lettuce but that is minor. Also great as a leftover for quesadillas.

I actually cooked this back to back when I did pepper steak another night (had to use up some peppers and onions), and I was impressed. I didn't use a tenderloin, I picked up a pack of chorizo sausage and cut it up into small bits. The amount of meat was too much, but that was my own mistake. As far as everything else I stayed faithful to the recipe and it tasted great! My 2 year old has developed quite the taste for spicy food and she cleaned her plate.
