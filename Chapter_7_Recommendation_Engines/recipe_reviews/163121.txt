Yummy!!! I'm enjoying one right now and it's awesome. I do like my Cosmo's a bit more sour so the pomegranate and lemon combo is just perfect. I used just plain top shelf vodka, otherwise followed recipe exactly. I will definitely be making this one again!

Very tart and tasty - made an oversized batch to take to a Halloween party (I was dressed as a martini, and drank this out of a huge martini glass) - certainly did the trick! I used triple sec in place of cointreau.

Amazing. Didn't change a thing. It is the first martini I've ever made. I've made them 3 times in 2 weeks.I know, I know, 3 times? I feel like it's good for me with the pom juice!   I add a sugar rim. I always love a sugar rim, but that's just my preference. It's not too sweet or too strong, and it goes down pretty easy, so be cautious.  It's a beautiful color and would be great at Christmas or Valentines Day.

Excellent! I've tried this with plain pomegranate juice and with pomegranate-blueberry juice, which is now my favorite drink.

Made this for a holiday party and they were a HIT!  A lil potent but so yummy!  I used a liquor called Bauchant...cheaper and as a mixer you cannot tell the difference!  I also dipped our rims in lemon juice and then in a pomegranate sugar that I found at my large liquor store.  Thanks for sharing this great cocktail!

I was pleasantly surprised by this martini, delicious! I don't enjoy sweet or fruity drinks much so I was a bit skeptical of this one, but it is fresh and tart. Oh, it's quite potent too! I'll be making these often, thanks Kim!

I placed this martini in my recipe box, some time ago. I just tried it today with some guests. It was a hit. The mixture of the Cointreau and pomegranate juice are excellent.

Used this recipe over new Years and was a big hit. Although I did alter it a little. I only used 1 oz. of vodka. I think it would have been to strong for us with two ounces. I also added fresh pomegranite to the bottom of the glass and rimmed the glassed with sugar. YUM! I can't wait to make these again.

It tasted too strongly of Cointreau and the pomegranate juice was a hassle to squeeze. The juice was also to tart, so this was not a good recipe for me.

A bit bitter from the pom juice. I may add a little more Grand Marnier and a splash of Seltzer next time.

Citrus ends up being the predominant flavor if you follow the recipe exactly.  For the second round, we added more pomegranate and less Cointreau, and some fresh pomegranate seeds.

I hesitated because of the lemon juice but this was awesome and very easy, love 5 ingredients or less!! I think this is the perfect Christmas cocktail!!! I can not handle a martini that is all alcohol so this was great because you can have 2 without feeling like you are overdoing it!

First things first...Not a Martini...The martini is a cocktail made with gin and vermouth, and garnished with an olive or a lemon twist (Wikipedia definition), don't get me started on the various libation's that are referred to as "Martini's". 
Now that I got that out of the way, this is a very good mixed drink, my friend and I both agreed that a little less orange liqueur would be better other wise very tasty and will make again!
