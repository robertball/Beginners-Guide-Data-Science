Followed recipe exactly.  Moist and delicious!  Next time I might add cranberries for a bigger fruit punch, but would not change basic recipe.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I made a second batch as mini muffins and added cinnamon, raisins, and Flax seed meal. Baked in mini muffin tin for 14 minutes (Note: I used spray oil in tin and no wrappers). Came out moist, sweet and delicious! I posted a picture. Thanx for posting this easy peasy fabulous recipie!

11.7.17  Made one substitution, used all purpose flour instead of whole wheat (we just don’t care for it), otherwise, followed the recipe.  The muffin texture was a bit different than other banana muffins I’ve made, but they they were plenty moist and flavorful.
