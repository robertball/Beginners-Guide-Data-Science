We loved it. Very simple.  I halved the recipe....but didn't trust the 30 minutes of reduction was sufficient.  The glaze seemed very thin.  So, I cooked it another 10 minutes...and ruined it.  I quickly remade it...but this time I halved the half (so 1/4'd the recipe).  I simmered the glaze for about 15 minutes, which was plenty of time for the small amount of liquid.

This worked great in a Blue Apron recipe calling for soy glaze (Black Garlic-Shoyu Ramen).  My recipe only calls for 2 tablespoons, but the rest kept well in the fridge for about a month until I used it.  I did reduced the sugar a little.  Delicious & easy.

This sauce is a simple way to add a ton of flavor to any dish.  It's  a perfect complement to get that sweet and spicy flavor with other sauces like sambal oelek or gochujang.  As others have said, a slightly longer cooking time may be required, I went to about 35 minues on my first batch.  The sauce will thicken considerably once cool.

I wasn't able to find soy glaze at my local supermarket, and the price to order it online seemed a bit silly once I knew the exact ingredients.  Overall a great, easy recipe.

I can't believe this incredible recipe only has 3 reviews.  I made this 6 months ago and a dozen times since.  I usually double the recipe and keep a jar in the fridge for quick meals after a long day at work.  I didn't make any changes--the ingredients are simple and things I always have on hand.  I'm making oriental bowls this weekend and of course...I'll be using soy glaze on my tofu and veggies...yum!

PERFECT!  Thanks for posting!  Blue Apron uses "soy glaze" in a lot of the recipes we enjoy the most

I made it with only changing the cook time.  I have an older flat top stove that seems to take longer to heat than coils, or gas; the stove top cook time may vary.  Yes, you must be patient - I wouldn't make this if  you want it fast.  It's a process and when followed according to this recipe, you can't go wrong.  I made a full recipe and put the leftover in a glass jar.
The next timer I want to make a Blue Apron recipe that needs this ingredient, I'll be prepared instead of having a panic attack.

If you have a gas stove (like me), I recommend you simmer at low, vs medium-low as the directions indicate. Mine ran over and made a bit of a mess when at medium low, but simmered beautifully once I brought it all the way down. Regardless, it tastes amazing and I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Fabulous base to start with, but cook time is too long. I cooked it for 10 min and it thickened up nicely within 15 min. 
I say 'Base' because i used fresh grated ginger instead of powdered and added sesame oil. Went beautifully on my grilled broccolini, topped it off with sesame seeds and chili flakes. A hit at my thanksgiving table!

Made this with 1/2 cup homemade date paste instead of the sugars. It needed additional liquid, used some beef broth.  The sweetness was mellow, but there.

This glaze is fantastic! I substituted blackstrap molasses for the white sugar because I liked the consistency and wanted to make it healthier, and cut some of the brown sugar.  I didn't wait for it to thicken as it dressed my chow mein stir fry. Perfect! Will make again.

Finding this in the store was such a pain, I decided to make my own.  Came out perfectly. Thanks!

Easy to make per recipe and is great as an add for many dishes.  As with several others, I went looking for recipes after using Blue Apron for over a year.  This hit the mark perfectly.

Really legit soy glaze. Used it on a meatloaf and it was fantastic.
