I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times now. A few tips... 1. The amount of water sounds small, but it's genuinely all you need for this stew-y dish; if you like a more soupy texture I recommend waiting until the end of cooking since the cabbage will sneakily release a lot of liquid. 2. It seems a little under spiced to me as written so I tend to add a bit extra of everything. 3. The recipe can easily handle less oil--it worked great recently with just a tbsp (it's not QUITE as deliciously rich that way, but it does work). 4. It tastes better the longer the leftovers mingle in the fridge, so I always make a big batch!

This was excellent. I don't know if I would have ever thought of mixing these ingredients. I did add about twice the amount of Tumeric and Cumin. My husband and I have become quite a lover of indian food. I added a minced garlic clove when adding the seasonings. Even better the next day. Thanks for this recipe! Have already made it 4 times.

I added green beans, white beans, garam Marsala,and dash of cayenne. I also added more liquid: water and abt 1/3 c V8   I think one reason mine was so dry is that I used only a little bit of olive oil.

My husband and I loved this dish. I didn't have any ginger and it still turned out delicious. I did use more water during cooking. I have recommended this to a friend and I will definitely be making it again. The dish had a sweetness to it that I didn't expect.

This was good and easy! Four stars, because it is a tad bland.  We didn't have carrots, so I used a cup of garbanzo beans, and I also didn't have ginger so I just left it out. Was very good and would make again!

Extremely delicious, added a pinch of red pepper flakes to kick it up.  Also made some spicy lamb meatballs to have along with it.

I cover when cooking on medium low. That keeps the water from evaporating. This is very good even though I usually don't have carrots.

Very good dish kids and husband loved it. I added a bit more turmeric and cumin. Also added fresh ginger not ground ginger. I think the next time I make this dish that sweet peas will be added for that bit of color and taste it needed.

This was very tasty, similar to restaurants and easy with clear directions. I added some salt and cumin seeds along with cumin and extra spices. Super easy to reheat. This probably makes 8 servings if you are having it as one of several stews with injera.

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I added one tiny change, and that was to add 1T honey to the onions and carrots as they cooked. Yumm!

I love trying new types of cuisine and enjoyed this.  I added extra spices, as many suggested.  I used more carrots and less potatoes.   It is economical, quick and quite good.

Yum! Served this with Doro Wot (recipe also posted by Twin Cities) and it was a hit! I did have to add more seasoning than recommended as I cooked - including a bit of salt. I also had to add a bit more water and cover it once the potatoes were added. The cabbage does release liquid as it cooks, but it wasn't enough to keep the veggies from sticking to the bottom of the pot. More water was an easy fix though, and it still came out delicious. Will definitely make again!

I discovered this dish because I had some left over packaged cole slaw mix.  Loved it.  I bought a head of cabbage and carrots to make it again, the real way. I use fresh ginger.

I loved it. I only had 3 carrots so I used 1 parsnip and the result was so delicious .
I added more water when needed and covered the pot once the potatoes were added.

It turned out great, though I recommend adding small volumes (around 1/4 cup) of water to the dish throughout the 30 minutes in which the potatoes cook to prevent burning.
