This is to die for!  Mix everything and put in a zip lock bag.  Cut a small hole on a corner and dispense and cut with a kitchen scissors.

This is sooooo....good with Sauerbraten I here on this site.

Thank you so much for a taste of Bavaria!

I usually do not give out 5 stars, however, this recipe deserves it - as far as spaetzle goes.  I spent 6 months in Germany last year and personally, could live without spaetzle.  This recipe however is better than any I had in Germany or Austria.  I did crisp up some bacon and added the onions to get them nice and caramelized.  I sauteed the spaetzle in the bacon and onion mixture before adding the cheese.  It really was good!  My husband loved it (he grew up in Germany eating tons of spaetzle) as did everybody else, including the kids.  Thanks for the recipe - am making again tonight for an Oktoberfest dinner party!

To the reviewer below this, Emmenthaler is Swiss cheese.  Just use whatever swiss the grocery store has and it will turn out fine.

I was a foreign exchange student in Austria a few years ago and love Kaese Spaetzle!  We have it for dinner often.  I use a different Spaetzle recipe that has more milk and fewer eggs, but the procedure with the onions and cheese is just like how I do it.

As an American living in Stuttgart, I can say that this recipe is authentic.  I loved it!  I did something just a little different because I like mine with bacon, which omits the requirement for butter.  Fried .5 pound of bacon, reataining the grease in the large skillet.  Sauteed a small chopped white onion in the grease, then added the spatzle/emmentaler and crumbled bacon.  Yum!

I was NERVOUS to make this since we had just spent time in Germany and my kids' expectations were high!  But... the recipe did not disappoint!  I did have to scale up the recipe in order to use it as a main dish.  I also used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of 1 full one.  Making the spaetzle was FUN!

My kids love this.  I use a clothes pin to secure the flat cheese grater to my pot, so I do not burn my hand.  I chopped the onion and sauted it.  I then added the spaetzle and sauted it in the butter for a few minutes before I added all the cheese.  I have used various types of cheeses and my kids love it each time.  They like this better than homemade mac and cheese.  It is well worth the extra effort to make.

If you like this recipe, I suggest you invest in a Spaetzlemaker.  Any specialty cooking store should cary it.  This tool makes it so much easiert to convert plain dough into perfect little dumplings.  I am from Austria (the original Spaetzle country) and Kaese Spaetzle are the ultimate comfort food for me.

This sounds wonderful but where do you find this type of cheese. Is there anything similiar to it that I could substitute. My grandparents were german and we always had spaetzle and sauerbraten for Christmas. This would be special. Thanks.

Ok, lately I haven't been able to get my kids to eat anything I have been making for dinner but finally we have found a WINNER! This is really good.  I lightened up on the onions so the kids would eat it but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I couldn't find my ricer (it doen't get used very often:)so I used a cheese grater and my Pampered Chef plunger measuring cup.  I just held the measuring cup against the back side of the grater and pushed the batter thru as I slid the grater back and forth.  Made perfect dumplings.  I will definitely be making this again!

Spaetzlemakers make life way easier! I have been on several long trips to Germany and Austria and I love this--it's great comfort food. I also tried making this with Gruyere, as a previous reviewer recommended, and it's delicious that way, too! Great recipe! I normally can't stand onions, but I love love love this recipe.

My family loves this, my daughter spent some time in Germany and said this was just like the recipe her friends mom made. I dice the onions small (personal preference) and just use whatever cheese we have on hand. Always great! Norpro Stainless Steel Spaetzle Maker on Amazon is under $15. and worth every cent for this recipe!

I'm 15 and picked a random recipe to make for my family cause my mom was about to make plain old spaghetti again. This one looked easy enough and I had all the ingredients. If it isn't obvious already, use a sweet onion. Also, I don't think the kind of cheese you use matters at all. I used whatever was in my fridge (some swiss, mozzarella, cheddar, & parmesan) haha and it worked out well. Yum, I would definitely make it again!

Oh man, this was wonderful! I didn't have the cheese it called for, so I used half colby and half fontina (I know, I know), but it turned out GREAT and it would have been better with the original cheese. I would recommend that people get a spaetzle press/maker because using a colander is a pain. Good recipe!!! None left.

This was sooo yummy!  I took the suggestion from another recipe on this site and added a little vinegar and parsley at the end.  It really woke the recipe up!
I lived in Germany and spent a lot of tome in Salzburg, which has the best spaetzle, so was prepared to be a little disappointed.  But I wasn 't!  Really excellent!

First attempt at making Spaetzle and it turned out pretty good.  I wish the directions stated how the dough should look before letting it sit since 3/8c of milk is an odd measurement.  I ended up adding more flour after it sat because it was pretty runny and was still runny when I pressed it through the potato ricer. The ricer worked pretty well except the dumplings clumped quite a bit.  Next time I think I'll use a ziploc bag with a hole in the corner as another reviewer suggested. I sauteed the onions in bacon grease (using the bacon for the German-style Green Beans recipe on this site) then added the spaetzle. I didn't shred my Emmenthaler, although I wished I had.  I cut in very small chunks hoping it would melt well, didn't. My husband loved it especially when combined with the Bohemian Pork Roast on this site. When the 2 are put together, it's a better taste than either on it's own!

Just okay. This was our family's first time havng spaetzle and not so sure we liked the conistency of the noodles.  It may have been my attempt at this recipe that went wrong, but I follwed it exactly...the texture of the noodles nad the blend of the flavors were not quite to our liking.

I only made the spaetzle from the recipe but I just wanted to say it was GREAT! I was a little worried about how potent the amount of nutmeg was but it turned out to be a great flavor in the finished dish. Thanks for sharing! Update: Made with whole wheat flour and it was a lot drier than the all-purpose flour spaetzle. But it was still pretty good. I also made the whole wheat spaetzle according to the recipe (with the butter, cheese, and onions) and it turned out so good! I may add more cheese next time, but that's just b/c my family is full of rats. :) Thanks again!

One of my favorite dishes. The whole family loves this stuff. I like to cook bacon and onion and then fry the spaetzle after boiling it, then I smother it in a fabulous mushroom sauce.

We have been to Germany and tasted the real deal.  This meal is as good if not better than any kaese spaetsle that we have had in Germany.  Must try for anyone with a taste for German dishes.

Not bad, however I add some fresh bacon bits, and lots of cheese.  BTW, any cheese will do for Kaese spaetzle as long as it has some flavor to it....

A few modifications; I used extra old white cheddar instead of emmentaler (swiss) cheese because that's what I had on hand, added sliced bacon and some dried parsley. This smells oh-so-good! Turns out spaetzle is basically what we Hungarians refer to as galushka, minus the pepper and nutmeg though it is usually served as a side to chicken paprikash. A nice alternative to regular mac 'n cheese.

I made this exactly as the recipe called. In my opinion the nutmeg was a bit overpowering. I used fresh ground nutmeg so that may have been the reason. Next time I will cut back to 1/2 tsp. I used a spaetzle press and I can't imagine not having one for this dish. It fit perfectly over the pot. The holes were large enough for the spatula I used to push the dough through. I used Softex pastry flour. The bulk food store recommends this one for noodles and pastry. The texture of the spaetzle was great. I will make this again and use other suggestions with bacon and other spices.

I'm Chinese, but my husband is Luxembourgish with a definite fondness for German food. I would have no way of knowing how authentic the spaetzle was, but he absolutely raved over it and ate far more than he probably should have. He even FB'ed his happiness over having a "taste of home" ... A definite keeper! Thanks for posting the recipe!

Very good recipe...it tastes just like what my husband and I had in Ettal, Germany.  I didn't use the Emmentaler cheese but used a sharp white cheddar - it tasted delicious.  The challenging part was pressing the batter through a strainer.  I will have to invest in a Spaetzlemaker as one reviewer suggested because I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

This was pretty darn amazing. My Aunt sent me a Kull spaetzle maker I was dying to try and the batter was the perfect consistency and my spaetzle came out beautifully.  The recipe itself was delicious, buttery and decadent.  I added some bacon but I'm not sure it needed it as the dish was already so rich.  It came together beautifully and made a perfect side dish for marinated steaks.

This was an OMG moment for me.  Absolutely delicious, and not nearly as difficult to make as I had imagined.  I used "swiss & rye" cheese (it is swiss with carraway seeds) from my local grocery store--perfect compliment to the nutmeg in the dough.  I  used my round colander to make the spaetzle with a bowl on top to push it through.  Messy, but they turned out just fine.  I will definitely make this again!

Well, this was ok. I probably wrecked it on the first try as I only had cheddar cheese. But the spaetzle was good, just be sure if you use a collander, that you use one with large holes otherwise trying to force the dough thru is a pain. It was filling,that's for sure. But for a middle of summer lunch experiment, it didn't crash and burn. The 3 year old ate it but the 6 year old didn't. I'm not sure I'll make it again though.

This was amazing. I wanted to do it right so I ordered a spetzle maker off of Amazon for cheap and I am glad I did, it made making this so simple. I used Italian blend cheese instead of swiss because we don't like swiss, and the whole family loved it! This will be added to the permanent rotation!! Great recipe.

OMG; Absolutely delicious, and just like the homemade varieties we had in Southern Germany (Swabia). . . . using a spaetzle maker (try amazon.com for a few varieties and price ranges) makes life much easier. Frying bacon first, then sauteeing the onions in the bacon grease then adding the spaetzle and cheese makes it even more hearty, comforting, warming, and main-dish worthy. YUM! Thanks!

I found this recipe as a way to get rid of my milk and emmental. Having never made nor even eaten Kaesespaetzle before I decided to give it a go!   I cooked it as instructed (man was it difficult to get the dough through the colander) but then decided to bake the finished product to brown the cheese on top.  Turned out very good even though I am not a fan of swiss cheese :)  My roommates enjoyed it as well!

This is a GREAT recipe, both easy and tasty.  I would recommend using a potato ricer or spatzle maker if you can get your hands on one because the dough is very sticky.  I used an Oxo potato ricer I bought on amazon.com and it was super easy...you can also choose to make long or short strands by continuously pushing dough through or shaking it until the dough drops. This recipe makes about a 2 quart casserole dish amount...plenty for 4.  I cooked the onion while boiling the dough to save time. The dough cooks very quickly, almost immediately. Next time, I will cut the butter in half, it was too much. After finishing the dough, I added it into the pan with the onions to crisp everything up a bit. Then I added 1 cup of shredded swiss cheese and let that cook another minute. I then transfered everything into a 2 qt casserole dish, topped with the remaining cheese and covered until serving. This dish would be excellent as a side, but tonight it was the main dish, so I threw on some chopped chives and a few pieces of Quorn Chickin Nuggets (I'm vegetarian, but any meat or meat substitute would be good). I love this recipe though because it is easy to change for a different taste...like change the nutmeg for curry or cayenne pepper. Also, this dough recipe is great for a "funnel cake" type dessert if you crisp up the dough after boiling and drizzle chocolate or caramel sauce over or fruit. Yum!

Only three stars because I must have done something wrong. Had to make it twice because it was too runny to handle at all. Second batch came out better but I didn't have a press, so just tore off pieces by hand. Ugly but very tasty.

I have made this recipe many times now, and it's become one of our favorites. Of course it makes a huge mess (or maybe that's just me!), but the dumplings can be made an hour or two ahead of time and sauteed right before serving. I usually use gruyere because I find it a little more mellow and nutty. And always freshly grated nutmeg. Fabulous recipe.

Good recipe for the dough. Mine didn't fit through a colander at all though, had to cut it into pieces. I did change the preparation by putting the spaetzle, butter and cheese into a casserole dish and baked it.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I made it for my father (who's German and LOVES spaetzle.  He said it was the best he's ever had.  He loved the "new" take on an old classic.  I'm making it again for Christmas dinner!  My husband and I have been craving it since we first served it in June. Thank you!

We live in the Netherlands/Germany/Belguim area and I  try to get this dish in the restaurants when we go out. My whole family agrees that this is just like eating out.  It was also very easy to make. Recommend highly.

I was very intimidated to try this recipe but I’m so glad I did. It was time consuming but it turned out great! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. It made enough for 4 smallish servings. I bought a cheap spaetzle maker off amazon for the 3rd time I made this recipe and it made my life a Thousand better. So much faster and less mess.

The only reason I didn't like it much is that I didn't have a spaetzle press, and that's on me for not being prepared. Otherwise, it's a neat little recipe.

I've made this several times now. Very similar to the spaetzle that my (Swiss) Mom used to make, although the spaetzle maker I have isn't the same as Mom's and my noodles are much skinnier than her were. 
But I use the same cheeses and make sure the onions are nice and brown and buttery. I layer the spaetzle with the cheeses and the onions to help with the blending process. 
Just made it for our Swissmass gathering. Everyone loved it!

Living in Germany I found this recipe to be pretty authentic but my family and I didn't care for it.  The cheese was not to our liking so I may just experiment with various cheeses or pay attention when I order it in restaurants so I know what to buy.

Jan 2019 - Super easy and fun to make - my colander made very small noodles so I would use a larger one next time or get the spaetzle maker from Amazon.  This was very good but needs to be served warm, otherwise it's very clumpy.  I cannot wait to try other spaetzle versions!

This is as authentic as it comes, exactly what you would find in restaurants in Schwaben in Germany.
Very tasty, and you really can play around what you put in it, adjust it to your taste buds.

This is a great recipe!  I bought a spaetzle maker, and it makes this recipe amazingly easy.

Not having a spaetzle maker I used one of the suggestions on this site, and a baggy worked pretty well after a couple of tries.  It was delicious!  It  is going to be a side with brats and sauerkraut with Dutch potatoes.  It's a lot of work without a spaetzle maker but will purchase one..  I did add some garlic to the butter and onion.  Thank you,  my German grandma would be proud!

They were absolutely delicious! My only problem was that I used a ricer, and that was a disaster. I think I’m going to invest in a spaetzle maker as this was a big hit with the family and I will surely make it many, many more times!

Made it for my daughters german class food fest.   I used baby swiss because that's what I could find locally, and a plastic spoon with medium size holes to push the dough through.  Worked fine.

This was a good recipe. Perfect texture for the dough. Needed a little something, not sure what. Salt helped. I might try to play around with some herbs/spices next time. I had difficulty browning it, just burned off the bottoms.

I haven't had spaetzle since I lived in Germany many years ago, and this is *exactly* the way I remember it! Thank you! Now if I could just find a Sauerbraten recipe that yielded as tasty a dish as the one I had in Germany---- still looking for that one. It's a long way to fly just for good Sauerbraten. ??

Emmanteler cheese was labeled as fondue cheese in the supermarket and it was pricey. We just used the more reasonably priced swiss cheese and it tasted great! Authentic recipe, all the right textures! Though I did end up adding ~1cup of water to help the dough through my spaetzle maker.

I plan to make this multiple times in the future, it was a very good recipe and reminded me of the Austrian restaurant's Käsespätzle near me. I was also craving it but not wanting to pay a lot of money for it. The only thing that I'll change next time I make it is the amount of butter. After I cleaned my plate there was just so much grease left everywhere. Other than that, a very good recipe. Thank you for this.

I LOVE this recipe!  I used Swiss cheese in mine because its what I had on hand and is a logical substitute for the emmenter cheese called for.
It's much like my grandma made it.

Exactly like I remember from trips to Germany - If you like the recipe I recommend investing in a spatzel press I got mine for $10 on amazon and it makes the dripping process so much easier

This recipe is SUPERB and tastes like the wonderful kaese spaetzle that I used to eat at my favorite German restaurant when I lived there. Yum! So glad I can now make it because I've missed it! The only changes I made were the cheese and onions. I couldn't find emmentaler at my local store so I subbed monterey jack and it worked perfectly. Also I prefer my onions crispy and piled high on top (like Langasthoff Schnauss served it!) So I breaded some thinly sliced onions in seasoned flour and deep fried them til golden. I've made this recipe at least four times in just the last few weeks since I found it and am making it again tonight. It's a Keeper and Sharing it!

Made this for Oktoberfest- my husband loved it! Has kept asking for me to make it again. I couldn't find the cheese  in the recipe so I used Gryere. Dumplings were delicious and turned out perfectly- used a spätzle maker and the recipe worked beautifully!  Next time, I'll  carmelize onions the onions for a more softer onion flavor.

Wonderful Spaetzle recipe and I loved the addition of the nutmeg in the batter...it gave the noodles a great flavor.  I also added crumbled bacon bits and some bacon drippings to it....yummy!

Really great recipe. In my opinion the nutmeg is key, it adds a depth of flavor to what would otherwise be a bland noodle, plus it complements the cheese wonderfully. I don't like Swiss cheese, ironic as I am Swiss, and used an aged cheddar instead. I always make this with beef stew.

This took longer than 1 hr. Maybe I was just slow, but I got it done in about 2. Cooking the pasta took a very long time. But it tasted really good and was super easy; I did as 1 reviewer suggested and cut a little hole in a plastic bag and squeezed the dough out of that like it was icing.

This is the real deal. After several trips to Germany we were addicted to Sauerbraten and Spaetzle. This recipe takes us back every time we have it. We change nothing the recipe is right on. We use a stainless steel Spaetzle  press and a spider to pull the noodle/dumplings from the boiling water.

Every time we make it we complain about the cheese sticking to the pan. We keep saying, next time we won't add the cheese until after we fry the Spaetzle with the onions. But we haven't yet. Just made it today. We had Sauerbraten made in our pressure cooker and the only Spaetzle we use.

I tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  The only change that I made was to substitute Fontina and Parmesan cheeses as I did not have Emmentaler and added sliced grape tomatoes and chopped fresh parsley as a garnish.  Making spaetzle is easy and much better than boxed macaroni.  This will now be my replace my macaroni and cheese recipe.  There is nothing like fresh homemade pasta!

I tried this and it was very good. I had hard time melting the Emmentaler cheese. I bought the cheese from a gourmet food store so I doubt it was because of the cheese. I will try next time some stinky muenster cheese. Stinky cheese would work well in this recipe as it will loose most of its strong aroma. 
Thanks for this recipe. The Spaetzle is fluffy and great tasting. I used a Spaetzle maker. I suggest using one. Search amazon.

In all fairness, I usually omit the cheese/onions and use this as a butter spätzle side for pork schnitzel, but this is SUCH a fantastic recipe. I've spent, in total, about 6 months in Germany, and this measures up against (maybe exceeds in terms of texture?) anything I had there, down to the perfect amount of nutmeg. It needs no adjustment--just toss with a tablespoon of butter and sprinkle with salt after it's finished...or, you know, follow the recipe and coat it with delicious Emmentaler cheese. :-)

I made this for an Oktoberfest Party. It was the hit of the party.  I had a little trouble pushing the dough through the cheese grater so I used a grill basket which worked good but now I will get a spaetzle maker! This is a great easy dish, I will be making it often!

First tasted this dish in Garmisch, Germany at a quaint little cafe and loved it.  This recipe comes very close to that one.  Sort of a German mac and cheese.

My family gobbled this up! They loved it! I served it  with tenderized pork cutlets & broccoli/cauliflower/carrot medley. We didn't have Swiss cheese, so I substituted a mix of Monterey & Sharp Cheddar for the emmentaler, and sprinkled Parmesan on top before serving. Delicious!

Delicious. Bought dry spaetzle and made it for the first time. Simply boiling and touching with butter wasn't exciting enough for my family, but this was a total hit.

Only a minor revision-I'm not a HUGE fan of swiss/ementhaller so I usually add some butterkase or farmer's cheese to mellow the flavor a little bit. Serve this with red cabbage or sauerkraut. Delicious!

it didnt taste bad but i was expecting something more like macaroni and cheese....it is really dry and basically just cheese and dough bits. waaaayy too much onion for me. a big gloppy stringy mess basically not creamy at all. i did get swiss emmentaler cheese too. i guess it tastes ok but dont expect the macaroni and cheese we are used to. and it was too hard to use a cheese grater so def use something else

I am an American living in Germany and I usually buy pre-made spätzle. After being gifted a proper spätzle-maker, I decided to give it a shot. This recipe really does taste like the homemade stuff I've had. I don't think I'll ever buy it packaged again!  FYI: Emmentaler cheese is known as Swiss cheese in America (for those who don't know) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My family liked this, though I didn't enjoy it as much.  I didn't use the whole onion, and there was plenty of flavor from it, almost too much. Also, the nutmeg was a little much. But that was just me, and my family still enjoyed it.

Great basic recipe for spaetzle.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the only change I would make would be to reduce the cheese next time.  It was a bit overpowering for me, and I am a cheese lover.

Quite good.  I used a potato ricer on the smallest holes.  Found the dough quite wet and mushy, but product was good.

I love this recipe. It takes a bit of time to make because I don't have a spätzle presser, but the extra work is worth it in the end. For years I wondered if spätzle could be something other than just plain German noodles.   I love to sprinkle different types of herbs and try out different cheeses with it, and I've gotten a variety of good results. I certainly find it better than the typical macaroni and cheese we are all used to eating.

Good! I used a colinder to press put the noodles.  What a mess!  Next time i will try the baggie idea.  Thought it tasted wonderful and am putting it in my rotation!
**EDIT.  after this sets for 30 min, I pour into a ziplock bag, cut  the corner and squeeze into the boiling water.  SUPER easy clean up that way. **

I prepared this for our Oktoberfest with our neighbors.The kids loved this, although a bit challenging without a spaetzle press.We ended up using a cheese grater as suggested, it didn't look very pretty, but there was none left by the end of the evening. I used Gruyère instead of Emmentaler cheese.

This is really good! I sliced the onions very thinly and probably added more cheese just so I wouldn't have any leftover. This is a perfect accompaniment to the Jaegerschnitzel on this site. Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at making spaetzle and it was a great success.  I split the batch, tossed 1/3 of it with cheddar cheese for my 4 year old (who can be finicky) and she declared it much better than macaroni and cheese (you know, the blue box).  The rest I served as a side to our New Year's Day pork and sauerkraut.  My very Polish husband stated it was as good as his mothers and I intend to make this a regular side dish in my house.

Pretty Good. I used swiss and cheddar cheese, then baked it so it was crispy on top. Needed a lot of salt.

This was awsome!!  This was my first try at making a German meal,  I made Rouladen, fried cabbage, and this spaetzle and it was a meal to die for, especially since I'm on a diet.  Needless to say I only took a bite of each, but WOW  it was good!!

Really tasty. A spaetzlemaker would make life a lot easier (so my dish looked like crumbled scrambled eggs). Would add bacon next time. Very good!

Really really good. I attempted using a colander, and I didn't work out very well. I ended up just pinching off little uniform pieces, and it worked out fine. In the future, I would get a specific spaetzle maker to make the process simpler. A delicious recipe!

This was interesting.  Could not find the cheese that was originally called for in the recipe so I used Muenster cheese.  I did not have any special gizmos other than a colander and the holes were too small so I actually ended up making what could be described as ugly dumplings and after I cooked them I cut them up into tiny pieces.  Taste, was really "interesting" and I could really see how this could be a comfort food. I could see myself making this again but only if I have the proper equipment.  Really made a mess without it!!

Delicious!  Thank you!  I used to live in Germany and this was one of the only dishes I missed.  Now that I'm pregnant I HAD to have it!  I used gruyere since I had it on hand and it hit the spot.

EXACTLY as it tasted when I had the "real" stuff in Germany!  I had so much fun with this recipe - I currently don't own a spaetzle maker, but you can bet I will invest in one since I found this recipe.  I improvised, using a flat bottomed colander even though it didn't fit perfectly over the pot, it worked well enough.  I am soooooo happy I stumbled upon this recipe; can't say enough good things about it.  Thank you so much!

Delicious comfort food! Easy to make. I made the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing.
