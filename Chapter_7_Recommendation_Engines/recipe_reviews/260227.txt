This is my first recipe review ever, but I just had to share how great this recipe went! Two important notes: I doubled the onions and celery, and I also cooked it for 40 minutes in the cooker after realizing that the turkey was slightly pink inside at 30 minutes. I also added 3 cloves of garlic because we love garlic. What a wonderful recipe!! Can’t wait to trot this out at Thanksgiving again next year.

This was so easy and good! I did extend the cook time to 40 minutes because I had a 9-pound turkey breast. But I didn’t even turn the juice into gravy. After we had made a couple of meals from the whole turkey breast, I cubed the leftover turkey and tossed it together with the juice as is. I’m going to make turkey-vegetable-barley soup for cheap work lunches. Very practical recipe for a family!

What a great recipe! I set the time on the instant pot to 40 minutes & did a natural release for 10 minutes.  I did not use poultry button —I hit pressure cook button insead!
When I thickened the gravy I scooped out the celery & then  
turned on the saute button to thicken gravy! 
Served boiled potatoes & steamed broccol!!This is a keeper!

I simply followed the instructions. I let the wife have the first slice. Her first comment: This is the most moist turkey I've ever had. I took the second bite and I had to agree with her. 
Very tender. Very moist. Very good. 

I may try a little paprika the next time I make it to spice it up just a tad.

Excellent and fast!  I cooked mine for 40 minutes based on some of the reviews.  It seemed done, although it had a button on it that did not pop up.  I took the drippings and just combined them with a box of stove top stuffing along with some extra bread cubes - perfect stuffing!

The turkey breast that I used was a 3 pound Butterball, so I adjusted the cooking time to 20 minutes. I was surprised at how juicy it was. When I’ve cooked it before in the oven or a slow cooker, it was a little dry. I’m doing it this way from now on.

really good I just needed more time on my pressure cooker xl.  Next time will use the medium 30 minute button instead of the white quick button.

Got an instant pot for Xmas and didn't a base recipe to work with--this was perfect! I placed the onion soup mix under the skin and placed 2 cups of chicken broth into pot. 30 minutes later----6lb turkey breast was done and so moist!

It was tender, it was moist, it was delicious ..... the ONLY thing I missed was the crispy skin the comes from oven roasting.
I will make this again EXACTLY the same as written.
Gave me additional faith in my Instant Pot!!!

I'd been researching cooking a turkey breast in an Instant Pot all day, and all the recipes seems pretty complicated. This one caught my eye due to its simplicity and use of onion soup mix. So glad I chose it!! So easy! Definitely the most moist turkey I've ever made. And the gravy from the drippings was fabulous. I will definitely be making this again and again. (I followed the recipe, except I added garlic.)

Other than the turkey breast was 4..8lb rather than 6 lb, I followed the recipe. I've used pressure cookers for years, this was my first time using Instapot.  I was not impressed, the turkey breast was not moist, it lacked flavor & was still pink in the center.

Hmmm, not sure why my review isn't showing. I had a small,  2 pound, turkey breast that was partially frozen so I cooked it for 20 minutes, I wasn't sure what the submitter meant by "Poultry" hight/low setting so I used manual pressure. The turkey was incredibly tender and moist, even the family member that doesn't usually like white meat loved it!  I did find the gravy very salty,  probably the turkey breast and not the recipe! This will be a repeat at our home, easy, moist and tender. Thanks for sharing Tammy Lynn.

My turkey breast was 7 1/2 lbs. Cooked of for 38 mins, depressurize for ten mins, and than manual to complete.  I used stock and one tablespoon of homemade onion soup mix from this site.  Turned out very tender and juicy.  There were three eating and we all enjoyed. But for me personally I just love roasted turkey. This didn't do it for me. I gave it four stars as it was easy, good and everyone liked it. Just me personally, I would roast in the future. This would be great for me in the future if I was going for turkey sandwiches or soup.  But for me, I just can't give up on my roasted turkey.  Still a great recipe.

This turned out tender and juicy. The gravy had great flavor. The entire family gobbled it up with no left overs! Keeper for sure. It's great to make turkey so quick.

I made this recipe as it was described and it was great. I also sprinkled  on some poultry  seasoning  as suggested. The simplest way is sometimes the best. I'll be making this a lot for the holidays.

I wasn't  a fan of the gravy, but the turkey came out perfectly.  It was moist and juicy.  My Instant Pot didn't have a poultry  button so I used the pressure cooker button.  I will always cook the turkey breast in the Instant Pot from now on.

Followed the directions exactly!  Then took the breast out, poured some melted butter with sage over it and crisped up the skin in the oven for about 30 minutes.  Family LOVED it!

I used a three pound butter ball turkey breast.  I followed all the directions but cooked the butterball for 20mins.  I will cook it for 23 mins next time as it was just a little pink in the center.  My husband loved it .

This was THE best turkey breast I have ever made in my 54 years of marriage.  It was moist, tasty, gravy & all.   It was so tender not dry at all. The flavor was incredible. I wasn’t too sure with the onion soup but I ended up putting it in anyway and I am so glad I did.   Ours was 7 lbs.  it took 30 min.  Once pressure came up.  ????
 Today was an unexpected record break up with the weather of 75 and above here in Massachusetts therefore I did not have to have my oven going all the time either. Fabulous 
 Another five star recipe  for allrecipes.com.   You always hit it out of the park.    Keep them coming all recipes !!!!

The easiest and best turkey we’ve ever made! We have an 8 qt.  Ninja Foodie and cooked a 7.5 lb. bone in breast. Since it was a bigger bird we cooked it for 40 minutes and it came out perfect

Very good and very simple.  I cooked on high for 30 minutes (manual) with 20 minute NPR, and the turkey button 'popped' so I knew it was done.  It was a 5 lb. bone-in defrosted turkey breast.  I don't usually like white meat, but this was pretty moist and tasty.  I thought the onion soup mix might make it too salty, but it really didn't.  I did use about 1/2 cup extra broth just in case, so needed more cornstarch in order to thicken the gravy.

6 lbs. bone in turkey breast, no soup mix or broth, just 2 cups of water, one onion, 3-4 celery stalks cut up in large pieces, a handful of baby carrots and a red bell pepper cut up.  Rubbed the outside of the turkey breast with a small piece of butter, sprinkled paprika, black pepper, oregano, basil, thyme and salt, put everything in the Instant pot (on the trivet), cooked on high pressure for 32 minutes and it turned out perfect, juiciest ever.

The turkey was delicious. Maybe my turkey was bigger - I didn't check that. It took about 15 minutes longer with a 5 minute release time.

I followed the recipe as written.  This was my first Instant Pot attempt.  There is a lot of seasoning in this recipe but the turkey breast was tasteless.  I 'm not sure I am sold on this appliance.

It was excellent. So juicy and tender. It just fell apart. Will make it again. It was a hit.

This was pretty good. The turkey was dry but that is not uncommon when cooking breast meat. The gravy was delicious and helped to cover the fact that the meat was dry. I'll make it again during the year with chicken.

I used a 4.5 lb. turkey breast.  It was my third try with my pc.  It came out dry.  I used chicken broth, about 1-1/2 cups.  Chopped celery, chopped onion, and I put dry onion soup on top of the turkey breast.  I cooked on chicken setting, I don’t have a poultry setting.  30 min. With a 20 min. natural-release.  The gravy came out like turkey juice.  What did I do wrong.  I’m trying to like this thing.  Everyone else seems to.

No changes made.  Browned on the oven.  It is ok.  The plus is the time saving but I still prefer oven roasted.  The onion soup mix threw me off I thought.I
