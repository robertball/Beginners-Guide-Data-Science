I noted some of the other reviews comments and came up with these edits to make them really healthy. My family loves them.  Edit recipe using:
1/2 cup whole wheat flour,
1/2 cup reg flour,
1/2 cup brown sugar,
1/4 heaping cup of applesauce instead of oil,
2 cups of frozen small blueberries OR 1 cup of large blueberries,
lower the oven temp to 425 for 15 minutes

I made the recipe with 2 cups blueberries like the other reviewer did.  I made my muffins in the evening for breakfast the next morning.  A nice quick simple recipe with healthy ingredients.  Out of the oven the muffin I tasted was eager to fall apart.  However, I placed them in the refrigerator over night and then heated in the microwave the next morning and had a perfectly firm moist muffin.  I was a little hesitant to put in the 1 TBSP of baking powder but was very pleased to find no taste of it in the end.  And we all loved them.  Keeping this recipe because it has great taste and nutritional value.

Fantastic! These muffins are hot out of the oven and i have a third batch in right now. The house smells incredible! I like this recipe alot because of the high propotion of heart-healthy/good carb oatmeal and the low amount of oil (as opposed to magerine). I made some modifications - i added some shakes of cinnamon and some vanilla extract. I substituted orange juice for the milk (i wanted to keep them non-dairy and i did not have soy-milk on hand). I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup (i might not do that next time...) and i added a stuesel topping - a mixture of oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and earth's balance light margerine (i was pretty surprised the light margerine held the struesel together and kept it crunchy!) i baked it at 400 for about 20-22 minutes. I like the batter of this muffin recipe - i see myself using it to also make strwberry muffins, apple muffins, or just plain coffee cake muffins (no fruit inside - and alot of brown-sugar struesel topping! Spectacular.  UPDATE: I substituted chopped apples for the blueberries - and they came out great!!! I tossed the apples with some lemon juice and a bit of sugar and cinnamon. I topped each muffin with a cinnamon-oatmeal struesal made from a mixture of oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and some low fat margerine. I baked my first batch at 400 -but the struesel started to get too dark quickly, so I baked my second batch at 350 - and increased the baking time by 5 minutes. They came out great and they freeze really

I liked these a lot, and the reason may be the same reason some other reviewers did not - I wanted a MUFFIN, not a little cake masquerading as one (although there is certainly a place for that too). That's just what these are.  These are good and oaty, and just sweet enough.  Like a comforting bowl of oatmeal topped with a little sugar and fresh blueberries.  Other than adding 1/2 tsp. of vanilla I followed the recipe with no changes.  What I found confusing is that with a tablespoon of baking powder and the high heat, that these didn't rise or dome quite as I had expected.  Maybe there was too MUCH baking powder!  No matter, this little muffin is just so pleasant I couldn't bring myself to docking it a star for that. Nice, homey, old-fashioned MUFFIN.

Awesome! For our tastebuds, these are just the right sweetness (not cloying). Nice hearty texture, too. An excellent way to get cholesterol-busting oats into our diet.

I've made several batches of this recipe with slight tweaks -- dried fruit in lieu of fresh blueberries, soy instead of dairy milk, egg replacer instead of egg -- always with great results. Try adding lots of cinnamon (I add about a tbsp.) to the batter, and sprinkle the tops with a few extra rolled oats and a bit of turbinado raw sugar before baking!

As others have mentioned, it seems 20-25 minutes at 400Â°F works well.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar for a diabetic version.  They were absolutely delicious.

They did fall apart fresh out of the oven but firmed up overnight.  However, the flavor is better when warm, kinda dry and "healthy" tasting when cold.  Best served with butter/margarine because they aren't very sweet on their own.

I've made these a couple of times.  I really like them, but others have said they're good but not great.  I think they are best straight out of the oven.  By the next day, they aren't quite as good. A minute in the toaster oven does wonders, though.  I substitute applesauce for the oil for a lite muffin.

These muffins are tops for flavor,nutrition, lightness and a minimum of sugar.  I used wild blueberries and added a small amount of cutup apple.

Easy recipe to follow and I like the small amt of sugar and extra nutritional value from the oatmeal.  I added a tblsp of lemon juice to the milk and the zest of a whole lemon.  Lemon/blueberry such a great combination.  Also I let the batter sit for 8 minutes to get the baking powder working.  I like a raised muffin and this usually does the trick.

These were fantastic! What I thought were frozen blueberries turned out to be frozen blackberries but they still turned out fabulous.  I upped the sugar to a half cup and made 1/4 white and 1/4 brown.  They baked up well and were the perfect hearty breakfast muffin for winter.  Will definitely make these again

Like Lynn, I altered this recipe to make it healthier.  But instead of swapping apple sauce for oil, I omitted the oil and swapped 1/2 cup of the flour for 1/2 cup of finely ground flaxseeds (rich in omega 3 oil, fiber, and lignans, a chemical compound that helps build the immune system and has antioxidant and anticancer effects) I used only whole wheat flour and 2 cups berries. I baked them for 15 minutes, and these came out great!  

Moist, rich without being heavy, excellent texture and flavor.  Coming right out of the oven they are keen to fall apart, but after they cool they keep together well.

Some people are put off by the idea of flaxseeds, but if you (and your kids) already like the somewhat nutty flavor of oatmeal, you (and your kids!) will probably like the light nutty flavor of flax!  Each muffin works out to having about 800mg of Omega-3, which is 80% of the 1 gram minimum RDA experts are leaning towards :)

Very good recipe that seemed to be missing a few ingredients, namely: ~1 tsp of vanilla, a generous shake of cinnamon, and a small mashed banana. The muffins would have been a bit too dry without the addition of the banana, which didn't overpower the recipe

These are great hearty muffins that we love!  I have made them several times over the past year or two.  I always double the receipe (I like to freeze them) and have made some modifications.  Here are my changes based on 24 muffins - use 2 1/2 c. of blueberries (frozen), 3/4 c. of unsweetened applesauce, 1/8 c. of oil and 2/3 c. sugar, leaving the oats, flour, baking powder, salt, milk and egg as indicated, only doubled.  I also bake them at 375 for 15 minutes (maybe my gas oven cooks very high!).  Anyway, thanks for yummy recipe Sue!!! **********UPDATE************* Still make these often and have tried using all Nutri-blend flour (great!) and 2/3 cup light brown sugar (as I double the recipe) as well as i egg and 3 egg whites.  I now add some cinnamon and vanilla bean scrapings.  For me, baking these at 375 for 15 mins is the perfect time and temp!

They are so great!!!  I made a few just to try and they are gone with in two days, and it is just me eating them.  I added a little bit of cinnamon and raw sugar for the top, and it just made them pop.

11.18.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/6766/oatmeal-blueberry-muffins/... Yes, yes, changes; but, yes, yes, that's me.  Even with the changes though, I feel my review is valid since the original muffin itself wasn't that far off - meaning I can imagine blueberries instead of cranberries, etc.  It's okayyyy.  :)  So, I'm thinking a cup and a quarter oats.  Yowza, Oat City - & I have to disguise them for "some of them" to try the muffins (or whatever).  Fair enough, I'll soak them as I have in the past; but, this time, in orange juice.  That's a first, but why not?  I put the oats - not quick, old-fashioned - in a bowl with half cup orange juice & let it sit for half an hour or so, stirring a couple times.  Then, added the wet ingredients.  Also added 1/2t orange extract.  Combined well & added the dry ones; folded in a generous cup fresh cranberries.  Today, they stick to the paper a bit; but I think tomorrow they'll be better.  Tastewise: pretty yummy.  A soft-but-not-too-soft, sweet-enough, gently orange muffin with cranberries.  I think lemon-lovers would maybe like lemon extract instead of orange & maybe, just maybe, soak the oats in a not-too-sweet lemonade?  I dunno.  The orange combination was good though.  'Wonder how soaking in cranberry juice would be?  ... Someone's going a little too far with this - meaning me.  I'll stop now.  :)  PS The oats went unnoticed.  :D  Next day: 'Better the first day by far.  The wrappers did come off easier though.NOTE:Gotta sa

Loved this recipe! It makes moist and tasty blueberry muffins. Although, I did make some changes to the recipe. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and baked at 400 degrees for 15 mins. They were perfect!

I LOVE these muffins.  Please note that they are a healthier muffin and don't taste anything like the out-of-the-box muffins.  If you like sugary-dessert style muffins these are not for you.  I love the texture and also used whole wheat flour but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Make sure to get BIG blueberries for the best flavor.  Add a 1/4-1/2 cup of sugar to make them sweeter but I liked them just how they were listed!

These muffins were excellent, even my super picky hubby enjoyed them! I made a few changes. I replaced all of the flour with whole wheat flour, added a heaping 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and about the same amount of cinnamon, if not a little more. I also used egg substitute. I sprinkled oatmeal on the tops and baked at 400 for 25 mins. Very good!!! Next time I think I will add some raspberries . . . . . mmmmm! Thanks for sharing!

I added more blueberries and used a quarter cup brown and white sugar each, also added some cinnamon,  nutmeg, and vanilla.  It still could have used a little more sugar.  But, everyone enjoyed them.  We will make these again

These muffins were good and not sweet at all. Tasted healthy but delicious. HOWEVER!! The temp stated is WAY too high. I learned the hard way. I found the perfect temp was 375 for about 17 min. 

The recipe says 425 for 20-25 min and mine came out way too dark after 22 min. One min longer and they would've been inedible.

I used all whole wheat white flour, about 2 tbs. flax seed meal, honey instead of sugar, dried blueberries (about 1/2 cup), and 1 tsp lemon extract. They were probably some of the best muffins I've ever had.

These are so good my five yr old daughter ate it up and said to give this recipe a five star. I read other reviews & did 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all purpose flour, a heaping 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce to replace the oil and used brown sugar instead of white.

Could these be any more easy? I did some slight modifications that others suggested - added tsp of vanilla and some generous shakes of cinnamon. I also substituted about 1/4 cup flax meal for some of the oats/flour, for some extra nutrition. My 4 and 6 year olds love these and do I!  I made mini-muffins, cooked them for about 14-16 minutes at slightly less heat, about 415 degrees.

These were moist and not too sweet- just the way I like them.  Just be aware that the batter is a little more runny than usual muffin batter because the oatmeal doesn't soak up the liquids like flour does.

These muffins were fantastic! I changed the recipe to make it healthier by substituting apple sauce for the oil, and using soy milk instead of regular milk. Instead of using 1 c of all purpose flour, I used 1/2 c whole wheat and 1/2 c all purpose. They were great!

I enjoyed these muffins. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp vanilla,1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar,1/4 cup coconut oil, one container of egg beaters- egg substitute (they say thats two eggs) and 11/2 cups blueberries. Delicious, Nutritious and filling breakfast. Will definitely use again. I also imagine it would be delish with banana in place of the blueberry

Think "HEALTH" muffins and you won't be disappointed.  5 stars on presentation and texture but flavor was distinctly oat'ish.  Must be eaten same day after cooling for about 15 minutes.  Anything over that and it goes dry.  I'll move on to another blueberry muffin recipe or just go back to my favorite on this site called Blueberry Cornmeal Muffins by Shelley Albeluhn.  Sorry they are so bland because they really look beautiful out of the oven!

Tasty.  The oatmeal makes them moist and chewy - not overly sweet.  Nice!  I use two cups of blueberries, lemon zest and sprinkled a pinch of cinnamon sugar over each muffin before baking.

I made these last night.  They are delicious!  The only change I made was the mixing of the ingredients.  I soaked the oatmeal in the milk for 15 minutes.  In a sep. bowl I mixed the oil, egg, sugar.  In another bowl I mixed the dry ingredients.  I combined all the ingredients and saved some flour to cover the blueberries in and added them last.  The muffins turned out light, tasty and full of bluebberies!

If one wants a sweet muffin, keep looking.  This is really strictly a breakfast muffin, or healthier snack.  I didn't have berries so used 1 cup of chopped canned apricots.  Added tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger to the batter. Used brown sugar in lieu of white because I wasn't making a blueberry muffin.  Made 6 Texas-size muffins.  Texture is light and not dense or dry at all, thus the 4 stars.  Could easily be made more sweeter by adding a streusel topping.  Very nice recipe for a healthier breakfast or snack.

These blueberry muffins were quite tasty!!  I substituted splenda for the sugar, applesauce for the oil, and 1/4 whole wheat flour for some of the regular flour, and they turned out great!  A little dry, though, so it might be worthwhile to use the oil instead of the applesauce, or try pureed prunes.

I am always grateful for the reviews and the helpful insight/hints. I loved these with quite a few changes - although I don't think they're critical and there are probably lots of other possibilities. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 regular flour; Vanilla-flavored almond milk which I think did wonders for the fat content and the FLAVOR; increased the berries to about 2 c and used a combination of blackberries, blueberries and strawberries which was tasty and BEAUTIFUL; and based on another review - I added 1/2 t of nutmeg and about 3/4 t of cinnamon. I will definitely make these (or another variation of these!) again. My husband loved them.

I absolutely love these muffins!  I tried them with raspberries the second time I made them and also substituted apple sauce for the oil and egg substitute to make them very low fat.  They are yummy either way!  I'm guessing you could use pretty much any berry!

These were okay - tasty enough, but nothing special. I made them exactly as written. Since I live at a high elevation, I'm used to baked things taking longer than the recipe says, and to things being wetter than expected. Surprisingly, baking these for 20 minutes was plenty of time - they were nicely browned, and not soggy at all; they had a firm-enough muffin texture. They were not very sweet at all (a plus or minus depending on one's tastes), but reasonably healthy, I suppose. I shared them at a meeting, and while they were almost all eaten, and I was thanked, there were no "wows" that I heard, and none from me either. They are quick and easy to make, maybe for "everyday" muffins, but these are nowhere near some fabulous muffins I've had in the past.

Very good!  I made with 1/2 whole wheat four...next time I will try all whole wheat.  They are not super sweet, but they are wonderful, and if you use fresh sweet blueberries these muffins don't need any more sugar!  Love that these can be modified and made very healthy!

These are SO delicious ! I did add about 1/2 cup extra blueberries- any more would be too much for me. Thank you for shaing this !!

Very good healthy muffin.  Just sweet enough.  Loved that it is low fat low sugar but it still retains the muffin texture.  So easy to make!  I used frozen bluberries because that is all that I had.   Baked at 425 for 20 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Next time I will add bananas instead of blueberries or apples!!!!! YUM!!

Yum. Five stars for simplicity and healthiness. The muffins are hearty. I didn't use quick cooking oats, I used rolled oats, and I used hazelnut oil instead of vegetable oil. The only danger is leaving the muffins in too long (I left them in probably two minutes too long and so they were slightly brown). But yummy nonetheless!

I make these all the time.  My family & Co-workers love them.  They are best warm.  I also use frozed blueberrys in the winter.  I like to srpinke some oats on top of each muffin.  Then you know what you are about to eat.

Great flavor! I used whole oats, instead of the quick oats. I found this added a little more texture. I read another reviewer that mentioned soaking the oats in the milk while mixing all of the ingredients. I will try that next time to see what affect that has on whole oats. I also used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of the white sugar and doubled the amount of blueberries to 2 cups. Finally, I added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 Tbsp of vanilla. This really seemed to make the muffins pop. My husband wasn't particularly thrilled with these, but that's probably b/c they are healthy--no fault of the recipe!

I really liked these, but I made some changes.  I used powdered milk mixed with water to make one cup because we were short on milk.  I used applesauce instead of the oil.  I think this combination made them more moist so I had to double the flour.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.  I used 1/2 Splenda Brown Sugar blend instead of the white sugar.  I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon like others suggested.  I also cut the baking powder down to 2tsp.  I baked them for 20mins at 375 and they came out great!  They are not your usual bakery type muffins but a more healthy version.  My husband and I are both bariatric patients and these are "sweets" that we can actually eat without having a reaction to the sugar.

I know when rating a recipe you should make it the way it is , but I didn't and it came out great!! Added 1/2 wheat germ, increased applesauce to 1/2 cup (did not use oil), added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  The BEST healthy muffin EVER!!  P.s. Just out of habit, I mixed the wet ingredients first then added dry ingredients, I folded the frozen blueberries in last and the texture was perfect.

I kept all of the ingredients the same, but I soaked the oats in the milk while I combined the rest of the ingredients and added them just after the wet ingredients. I find it makes them softer in the muffins. Overall, an excellent recipe - the whole batch disappeared!

they are a strange texture and don't have much flavor. Most of the reviews have like 20 alterations, but I just followed the recipe. I think they could use a bit more sugar, and I usually think baked goods are too sweet. They are on the small side if you make 12 traditional sized muffins.

I just made these and they are yummy, I as well substituted apple sauce instead of the oil for health reasons, and used real sugar. I also made a second batch and substituted apples for the blueberries and they turned out very good as well so I am pretty sure that any fruit will do.

I found these to be quite tasty. I wonder if the people who said they came out too dry maybe mixed the batter too long? W/ muffins you really have to mix quickly and only until just mixed otherwise they can become too dry during the cooking process. You also need to fold in the blueberries, not stir them in. At any rate, I substituted whole wheat flour and they still came out well. I'd make this again.

I can't give this five stars because I made so many changes, so I don't know how they would have turned out, but with my "mods," they were pretty delish. I used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar instead of 1/3 white. I didn't have quick oats, so I ground 1 cup of slow oats in my mini-prep to make oat flour, and then tossed in the remaining 1/4 cup whole oats. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Instead of oil, I used 1/4 cup of fresh applesauce. Last, but not least, I doubled the blueberries. Turned out perfect blueberry "explosion" oatmeal muffins.

This is my "go to" for healthy blueberry muffins. I've managed to cut back on the calories even more by replacing the oil with applesauce, egg with ground flax seed, and replacing half the flour with whole wheat. Very yummy!

Great recipe!  Good blueberry flavor and a very nice texture, my daughter and I both had two muffins as soon as they came out of the oven.  I added 1tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla because I love those flavors with blueberries.

I also love this recipe and have made it my own! I use 1/2 sugar with 1/2 splenda; 1/2 oil with 1/2 applesauce. the cinnamon/vanilla is a nice touch. I lower the oven temp to 375 when using frozen berries and bake them longer. I found my muffins stuck to papers when I cut the oil way down so I switched to using Bakers Joy spray and don't use papers any more. Great baking spray btw. Love everyone's reviews. Very helpfull! Thanks

I loved these moist and hearty muffins...I added a tad more sugar and baked at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  It could just be my oven...I rarely bake muffins at over 400.  I also found 1 cup of blueberries to be plenty.  This is my new favourite blueberry muffin recipe!

I substitued several ingredients to what I had on hand.  Instead of blueberries, I used frozen mixed berries (blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries).  I used egg substitute for egg and Rice milk for milk.  As suggested I added some cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla.  These came out FANTASTIC!  Also baked at 4oo degrees for 20-25min.  Will definitely be making again.

These were very easy to make (one bowl) and turned out light and fluffy, even with a little whole wheat flour thrown in.  I used one heaping cup of frozen blueberries, and it was plenty.

Very, very good -- nice and moist (and I even used the applesauce instead of oil) and substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the 1 cup of flour.  The batter seemed too runny when I was pouring the it into the pans, but it baked up fine.  You will not regret making this recipe.  Enjoy!

This is a superb blueberry muffin recipe. I like that it's low in sugar and uses oil instead of butter. I used olive oil and Splenda since I'm watching the calories, and olive oil is very healthy, as are the oats. I soaked the oats in the milk as recommended as I was afraid they might be too dry otherwise. I am not sure if this made a difference but they did turn out fantastic. The tops were nicely browned and crunchy from the oats, but the insides were tender and fluffy. They were plenty sweet so I might reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup next time. Definitely a keeper.

This are quick, easy and nutrition!  I used applesauce in place of the oil to make them a bit healthier. I also used old fashioned oats because that was what I had on hand. They turned out perfectly and I did have any problem with them falling apart as was stated in other reviews.

I tried to make these as healthy as possible so I substituted white flour with whole wheat flour, white sugar with 2-1/2 Tbs. Splenda brown sugar, oil with a litle more than 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, used fat free milk and egg substitute and added 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon. I had extra batter so I filled it almost to the top with no problem. It did get stuck to the cupcake liners but peeled off easily the next morning after being refrigerated. The bottom was a little overdone so I'll try lowering the temperature to 400 degrees next time. Overall it came out quite good.

This was a really good recipe but a little bland, I made the following changes and they turned out great! My three year old loves them!
 I added about a half teaspoon vanilla and a half teaspoon or so of cinnamon,(didn't really measure). I also used robin hood nutri flour in place of the regular all-purpose flour but instead of just using a cup of flour I used a cup and a quarter. I added a streusel topping (1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of flour, three tablespoons of butter, and a quarter tsp of cinnamon.
Put the oven on 350 degrees and cooked for about twenty two minutes.

This recipe is fantastic! I used 2c blueberries and whole wheat flour and everyone loved them! I made 2 batches in one week!!! Also, my mother who has diabetes tweaked the recipe a bit and makes them for herself as a snack she actually enjoys!

Great muffin!  A tasty, good-for-you version of the old blueberry muffin.  Great with flax seed meal added and some chocolate chips if you don't have enough blueberries. I also a small amount of brown sugar and a few drops of vanilla.

I really love these muffins (as did my husband, who happens to dislike most muffin recipes!)  Instead of 1/3 cup of white sugar, I added 1/2 cup, as well as 1/4 cup brown sugar, one tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/4 cup of cinnamon applesause and a combination of raspberries and blueberries.  I paid close attention to the other reviews in here and decided to sweeten things up with a crumb mixture of brown sugar, soft butter, finely chopped pecans and flaked coconut.  Prepare alot of this crumb mixture and make sure you press it onto the top of the batter so it doesn't come off when you eat them.  These came out so moist and delicious that they're almost gone -- and I just made them yesterday! :)

This is a winner! Super moist & not too sweet, not even crumbly. I have been baking these muffins in three batches already! Although i made some alterations to fit into 12 muffins cups. i halved the mixture into 3 & used different flavors: cheddar cheese, blueberry pie filling & chcoco chips. my daughter says YUMMY!!! =). I altered the recipe to by using 1 cup flour, 1 cup instant oats & added a tablespoon of vanilla extract. I'm gonna try using cream corn style this weekend, I wonder how it will taste like, i'm pretty sure, YUMMY again! A sure hit!

These muffins are okay. However, they have very little flavor. They are definitely a healthier option than some other recipes, but taste is sacrificed. They are good muffins to drink with a cup of coffee, but I would not make them for guests.

Love these muffins! The only thing I changed was used grape seed oil (all I had!), and slightly less sugar.
They don't last the day! If using paper liners, remove to rack to avoid sticking

So easy to make.  I sprayed the muffin tins with flour baking spray and the muffins came right out of the tins, no liners needed.  I always look for new ways to add oatmeal to my recipes and this was a great way.  These muffins were wonderful, but next time I am going to try using baking splenda and oil substitue to try and make the recipe even healthier.  These warm muffins with a little immitaion butter spray fulfilled my blueberry muffin craving.   One time I was out of blueberries and used 1 cup drained crushed pineapple.  I think it came out sweeter and more moist than the original.  They were a hit.  I will make again for sure.

These are delicious! Just what I was looking for. They are not too sweet nor too tart, and have a rich texture to them from the oatmeal. I cooked them 20 minutes at 425 in an electric oven), and then cooked them 3 minutes more for a deeper color and crunchiness on top that I like.  I appreciated the low amount of sugar, especially. I thought the batter was a bit soupy, but they came out perfect. This goes in my permanent recipe collection to be made again & again! I'm going to try this with apricots and cranberries next!

PS: I was out of vegetable oil so used olive oil with no noticeable taste.

This recipe was yummy!!!  I did make a few changes, I added a cup of whole milk vanilla yogurt instead of the milk (no milk handy at the time) and I added a tiny bit more sugar.  ANd I didnt use paper cups, rather I just greased the muffin cups so I didnt have to worry about the muffins sticking to the paper (I noticed other members said this happened).

My family love these muffins, I never have leftovers and my kids has never questioned the ingredients. I did make several changes based off other recipes I've used in the past. I used whole wheat flour, used 2/3 cups of sugar, instead of 1tbs of baking powder, I used half and added baking soda, added cinnamon, vanilla extract and a splash of lemon.

Love these muffins!! I substituted with unsweetened almond milk, coconut oil and brown sugar and it tasted so good! I love that it's healthy, not too sweet/oily and I can eat it for breakfast! I think 1 cup of blueberries is perfect; I used 2 cups for the first time and muffins turned out to be too watery/runny in the center. Thank you for this recipe!!

I used quick cooking steel cut oats I had on hand and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. I think we have a new favorite in our house! We liked them better than our normal go to muffins. They are healthier too. Very Yum!!

Wow. This is a great, quality muffin recipe. It lends itself well to healthy substitutes. For an almost no fat, low sugar recipe, I made the following substitutions for a muffin with less than 150 calories: whole wheat flour instead of white flour; 2 egg whites instead of 1 whole egg; honey instead of sugar (or no sugar at all! ); 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil, and skim milk for the milk. I found that 1 & 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries worked well for me. I fill 12 baking cups pretty full, definitely more than 3/4. Also, baking at 20 minutes almost burns the sides. I take them out at about 18 mins for a lighter colored muffin.

Always moist and yummy.  Bake at 400 for 18 - 20 minutes as the higher temp and longer time dried them out too much.  Instead of 1/4 cup oil, use a second egg measured in cup and top off with oil to the 1/4 cup.  use 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1/4 cup re-constituted dried blueberries makes for a fruit explosion in every mouthful.  Real hit with family and have to make a batch every week!

i did this recipe to the letter the first time but i ended up eating them alone. the second time i ground the oats into oat flour because i have a picky toddler. i did what others did with half whole wheat flour and half AP floor. i used 1/2 cup brown sugar and downed the temp and time to 15min at 400degrees. picky toddler approved!!!

Yummy.  Will use this for other oatmeal fruit muffins in the future.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg because I like them with oatmeal and blueberries!  Used only brown sugar.

I made these with whole wheat flour instead, and cut down the amount of blue berries but threw in 1/2mashed banana, 1/3 cup of dried cranberries, a strawberry cut into tiny pieces and a handful of raspberries cut in half. So delicious.

This made 12 smallish muffins for me. I liked the taste. It didn't have too much sugar or oil I thought. I made it just as written. They came out tasting like a muffin, not a cake which I wanted. I used large fresh blueberries. I think small or frozen would've been better but it was good for me. The kids aren't going to like the huge berries though. This was a very easy recipe. Will definitely make it again and maybe try different berries or apples and add a topping.  I couldn't tell there was oatmeal in them once they were cooked.

I NEVER do reviews but had to on this one!!! I recently lost 80 lbs., started a new job, and was looking for ways to pack a healthy breakfast and lunch due to my hours. I took the advice with some of the edits: sub 1/2 wheat flour, omit oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce, doubled up blueberries, traded out sugar for 1/3 cup of brown sugar and these were FANTASTIC. Thank you for making my hour commute bearable dare I I say tolerable.... :)

Really good blueberry muffin.  The only changes I made were adding 2T extra flour because I live  near Denver, CO and the elevation is 6500 feet.  I used Splenda instead of sugar (equal amounts).   Because, again, of the high elevation, I changed the temp to 400 degrees and baked them for 17 minutes.

The amount of sugar is perfect and I love the fact that it calls for oatmeal.  I do agree that the receipe is pretty bland.  I've made these twice and the second time I added a tablespoon of cinnamon (this may be too much for some but I love cinnamon!), half teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla.  MUCH better!  No problem with texture or dryness.  Both times they came out moist and fluffy.  Will be making these again.

I made these this morning, and did substitute apple sauce for the oil, as some other users had done. I was very disappointed with the way these came out, almost burnt! I only had them in the oven for 10 minutes, and they were almost burnt by then. The recipe calls for 20-25 minutes. I don't ever have issues like this in recipes, so not sure what happened, but they came out quite dark and the taste isn't all that great either. Disappointed. Was looking forward to some great tasting muffins!

I added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries. Everyone adored them! If you have the over-sized muffin pans, add an extra cup of blueberries and bake them in those pans. It's the best breakfast on the go.

Sorry, these just did not work for me.  I really wanted to like them, but they were very bland and stuck in my muffing pan.  I feel as though I wasted a number of ingredients, and will not be making again.

these are pretty good, I am eating one fresh out of the oven as I write this...I love the texture and size of this muffin. Great flavor also, although I like my muffins a little bit sweeter than this so I think I'll try some brown sugar as someone else suggested and a slightly lower temp. maybe 400 for 20-25, in my oven I had to shut it off with 10 min to go because the bottoms were all browned up but the top, nothing and they appeared to be done but I wasn't sure, but they are very good with a little butter on them!

Perfect amount of sweet for a muffin - you can really taste the blueberries. I added a tsp of vanilla for personal preference - but otherwise followed recipe - baked for 13-14 mins at 425. Yumm!!

yummy! i love healthy, fruity muffins and always look for good recipes to make for the kids. i did sub apple sauce for the oil, added 1/2 a cup of wheat bran, and loaded in more blueberries (prob 1.5 cups) and i'm sure they will love these when they get home =) (i've already eaten 3!)

As written this recipe is a little bland, but I do like the texture. I think with a few minor changes it could be really good. Next time, I'm going to try it with brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and extra blueberries.

I didn't like it.  I put in extra fresh blueberries too.  My husband liked it because I made a healthier version.  Cut back on the sugar and used applesauce instead of the oil.  Will look for another recipe.

Delicious!  My husband and four children (under 5) all loved these muffins!  I substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil, as it is a much healthier alternative, and they turned out wonderful!  I found that it is best to allow the muffins to cool a bit before serving so that they do not fall apart.

I used old fashioned oats and it seemed to work just fine.  They only lasted 4 days and there are just two of us!  I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, the oil to 1/3 cup(canola), and used 1 1/2 cups blueberries(tossed in flour). The blueberries were too many.  I will also sprinkle sugar on the tops next time because I like them a little sweeter.    Very easy recipe and quick.

I read some of the other reviews and took their advice on using 2 cups of blueberries. I found this to be just a little too much blueberries. I would suggest 1 1/2 cups instead. Other than that they were great and really easy to make!

I like the fact that this is fairly healthy.  I did substitute applesauce for the oil like I do in most recipes.  I didnât care for the texture.  My kids really liked them and because of that, I will make again.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and subbed applesauce for oil; brown sugar for white and used whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour (did not do the half & half as others did).  I also used 2 cups of frozen blueberries as others suggested but found that to be WAY too many.  Will try 1 cup next time.  With changes, this is a good recipe if you want something healthy for your kids - which I did.  I am also going to try to sub Â½ of the milk for maple syrup and leave out the blueberries to try to make maple/brown sugar oatmeal muffins.  Hopefully that will work since too many blueberries do bad things to my 2 year old's diapers :).

This is the 1st Allrecipes recipe I've rated below 3 stars! I should have trusted my gut on the following: - not enough sugar - sugar added with wet ingredients, not dry - cooking temp too high - pans need to be greased AND floured Even with those corrections, the texture will still be wormy and the taste, one-dimensional.  I even added 1 tbsp lemon zest and it didn't make a difference.

I used whole wheat flour and added cinnamon.  1 1/2 cups blueberries.  Next time will try using applesauce instead of oil and decrease the amount of sugar.  good recipe for basic muffins.

These were not sweet enough for me. I liked the texture, but it definitely needs more sugar to suit me.

Delish! I used applesauce for half of the oil, added extra blueberries, and 1 t vanilla. This turned out fabulous! I am baking another batch tomorrow, maybe with even less oil. Yum!

these were very delicious! I also baked them at 400 and added 2 cups small wild blueberries with good success. After I was done mixing all the ingredients, the batter was extremely runny, so I added about 1/4 cup more of flour. They turned out great. the runny batter might be why some said to wait till the next day to serve them. But with the added flour, I was able to serve them warm out of the oven. I also added my special topping of brown sugar & cinnamon.

Thought these were bland.  I altered the recipe a little by substituting dark brown sugar for white, whole wheat flour for regular, adding cinnamon, and using 2 cups blueberries (admittedly, that was too many - I just had a bag of frozen blueberries from the summer and didn't realize it was 2 cups not 1). Not sure I'll make this recipe again.

Great base recipe.  To make them even lighter, I used Splenda instead of sugar, unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and skim milk.  I also used about a cup and a half of wild blueberries and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter.  They taste awesome and everyone in the house gave them 2 thumbs up.  Not overly sweet, I like that about them but if you like sweeter muffins I would add more sugar or sweetener.  Definately a keeper!

Absolutely fabulous!!!!!  I agree with another reviewer:  This is the perfect muffin base.  I didn't stray away from the blueberries, but I did ad 2 loose T of brownsugar, and dusted cinnamon in with the dry ingredients.  I also added a splash of vanilla to the wet ingredients.  I made 3 dozen for work, and they're already gone!

I really liked this muffin! It's not very sweet, so I wouldn't make this if you prefer a lighter, cakelike muffin, but it has very good flavour for being pretty healthy. I used between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup of applesauce instead of oil to cut calories, and it still tasted good. I sprayed my muffin pan well with cooking spray and skipped the liners, then filled almost to the top - no problem getting them out, and they rose nicely. I also mixed about a tablespoon each of sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it on top before baking for a little extra crusty flavour on top. Very tasty!

The oats give this muffin a very nice texture. It's not very sweet at all--I added a little brown sugar to the batter and it still was just a little less sweet than I like. I also added a couple teaspoons of grated orange peel, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon of grated nutmeg to the recipe. The orange peel added some needed sweetness. A very good recipe!

This has become my new muffin base.  Replace the blueberries with mashed banana, pureed pumpkin, or diced apples and you have a delicious, healthy treat.  To make this the most healthy and universal muffin, I reduced the oatmeal to 1 cup, substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose, and added 1/4 cup all purpose.  I reduced the baking powder to 1/2 tbsp.  I also use Splenda for baking instead of sugar.  Instead of oil, I use applesauce, unless I use pureed fruit, then I just add a 1/4 cup extra puree, like 1 and 1/4 cup pumpkin.  This is such an easy recipe to modify for all tastes.    I do have to mention that if you use muffin liners, they will stick to the liner right out of the oven.  Leave overnight and they are perfect; the paper peals right off.  They stay fresh for up to 4 days and will freeze well.

Except for my local newspaper; I use this site more than anything on the net. It is so nice; I have always found great recipes that I use over & over. Thank you

Changes: 1/2 cup brown sugar replacing 1/3 cup white sugar. Add 1 tsp vanilla. Used frozen blueberries.

These are very good and hearty muffins.  I made them as a healthy treat for my toddler and they were also a hit with my husband.  I am not a big fan of greasy, cake-like muffins.  These delicious little morsels fit my definition of a perfect muffin.

Good Muffin, though since not concerned with the health issue, I did increase the sugar to 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cups granulated..adding a touch of nutmeg to bring out the flavor of the berries a bit more as well.  husband and children including one very picky 8 yr old all loved them.

These muffins were super moist and delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I used vanilla soy milk, I put in 1/3 c wheat germ and 2/3 c flour.  I used Splenda in place of sugar and I added 1/3 c of brown sugar splenda.  I will defintly be making these again.

Low in fat and sugar and high in fibre and fruit - these muffins taste great and are healthy enough to be eaten often.  Although I tend to increase the sugar to 1/2 a cup (and use dark brown sugar for flavour), I think the proportions in this recipe are good.  The texture of these muffins is lovely and easy to achieve.  Although "healthy", my boyfriend asks me to cook them often.  A keeper!  Thanks Sue.

I was looking for a low cholesterol recipes that would add some oatmeal to hubby's diet.  These are great. In reading the other reviews, sweetness seems to be a problem.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and added an additional 1/3 cup of brown sugar Splenda. Also substituted applesauce for the oil.  You need to reduce the cooking time, mine took 10 minutes at 400.  Overall one of the best "good for you" muffins I ever.  Can't wait to try with Craisens and other fruit, maybe a few nuts!!

My daughter (13) made this recipe and added cinnamon.  It was delicious; the muffins were moist and tender.  We saved one to see if it would stay moist for several days, and it did!  A good recipe, even for a novice.

Pretty good - not overly sweet. A sprinkling of sugar on top before baking would be good.

I have a son with food allergies so I substituted Ener-G egg replacer and rice milk.  I also doubled the sugar and used 1.5 cups of blueberries as others had suggested.  They turned out moist & delicious.  I, too, baked at 400 for about 15 minutes.  I love having healthy muffins to give the little one for breakfast!  Thank you.

We added one more egg, and substituted 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. honey for the sugar.  Also, we used 1 1/2 c blueberries.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, they were moist and yummy -- lightly sweet.

These came out nice and moist. They taste like a breakfast muffin and have the crumb of a cake muffin (but not the sugar). I used frozen blueberries that I thawed by running them under  cold water. I used aluminum liners and had no troubles with sticking or crumbling. I enjoyed these muffins as a nice change of pace, but I doubt I will make them often.

I added 1 egg and upped sugar to 2/3 cup and the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups (I used a whole pint of fresh). 
I think these are pretty good--definitely not the normal sweet bakery-shop type muffins--but definitely tasty and healthy. I think the extra  sugar helped a lot, and divided over 12 muffins doesn't add too many extra calories. I am on a popular weight management program, and these muffins are only 4 points each.

My husband did not care for these.  I thought they tasted good, BUT they stuck to the paper liners.  I sprayed the liners but that didn't help.  So by the time you took the muffin out of the wrapper there were like 2 bites left.  I think I will look for another recipe.

Easy and delicious and moist!  After adding a little more sugar (1/2 cup total), and we always use applesauce instead of oil when baking, my hubby and I loved these.  Great the next day too, especially if you pop them into the toaster oven!

I wouldn't recommend making these muffins.  I found them bland in taste and they fall apart easily.  Thankfully, I thought of putting a topping (butter, sugar, and cinnamon) on top before baking - and they tasted somewhat good because of the topping.  In my opinion, if I hadn't thought of the topping, the muffins would have been really plain.  The recipe needs some sugar in it.

These are excellent.  I didn't have enough blueberries on hand, so I added a few blackberries & it was delicious.  I loved the taste of the oatmeal, too.  I also took the advice of another reviewer & used part whole wheat flour/part all purp. flour.

These were pretty good.  I halved the recipe and only made 6.  Only change I made was adding a little bit of lemon juice, need and about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

Use coconut oil instead. Batter seemed very thin so we added more oats to thicken it up. Next time will used 2 cups of berries. Cooked for 22 mins.

I substituted vegetable oil for coconut oil and white sugar for coconut sugar. It was so delicious! I will definitely be making again! I did what majority have suggested: bake overnight for breakfast to avoid the muffin from breaking apart.

Canât remember...and yes! I doubled the recipe and started looking at a different recipe because I couldnât print this one for some reason. Basically, I added the oats to the milk to soak while getting other ingredients ready. As mentioned, muffins are a bit dry after cooling but very tasty!

I've used this recipe a few times now and love it. I use a jumbo muffin pan so I increased the baking time by a few minutes. I also used whole wheat flour, and reduced the amount of milk a bit so I could add the juice and zest of one lemon because I love the pairing of blueberry and lemon.  They are divine!

This recipe is not bad but I was hoping that it would be more tasty.  I did add cinnamon, vanilla and 1/3 cup brown sugar based on what I saw in the reviews.  I definitely recommend these additions.

Made this with our own fresh pick blueberries replaced 1/2 cup oil with 1/3 cup Applesauce,  &  replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, I also sprinkled a pinch of course cane sugar on top, baked at 400 degrees about 28 minutes or until lightly brown on top.   It held together warm just minutes from the oven hubs & grandsons (7&9)  eat them up with butter so fast none were left for cooling!  All gave a thumbs up & our 7 yr old said it was a hundred out of ten. lol, It will be a regular at our house, lots of frozen blueberries.

I really like these! They arenât really sweet, which I like. I used old fashioned oats instead of quick oats because I like the chewier texture. I put extra blueberries in also (why not!). Like others, I baked at 400 for 20-22 minutes. The second batch I made I chopped up a Granny Smith apple and tossed it in cinnamon (I didnât want additional sugar) before replacing the blueberries with it. I will go back to this recipe again and again because it is quick, easy and they taste good.

Great recipe.  Not gummy or dry.  The oats really give interesting texture without toughness.  I did add a little wheat germ and more flour, about 1/4 cup.   I used frozen blueberries.  Will be my 'go to' for blueberry muffins now.

Tripled the receipe .switched 1/2 white flour for whole wheat and  changed white sugar to brown and halved it and added more blueberries which required a little more cooking . The Taste  is 1/2 blueberry crumble and 1/2 muffin .Thumbs up in my house .

These are great, especially because they have so little sugar.  Our cook time was shorter; 8 minutes, turn and another 8 for a total of 16 minutes, at which point the internal temp was over 200.  Be cautious - these can dry out quick.  12 small (not mini) muffins, 6-8 medium.  We also added the zest of one lemon, which really took these over the top.  Fantastic low sugar option for tastey blueberry muffin!

Great recipe-easy to substitute ingredients. My version here, with what I had on hand for a rainy day bake session :) I kept all measurements the same but used long cooking oats, half flour, half almond meal, used a fake sugar/sugar alcohol, cashew milk & frozen blueberries. I added a cinnamon streusel on top because I love it! Kind of reminded of coffee cake-I think the almond flour dried it out a bit, may add a little more oil or another egg next time. The oatmeal added a nice texture. The muffins were easy to get out of the sprayed tin, stayed moist in a plastic container. Next time Iâm doubling the recipe and trying freezing them. Very good!!

This is a great, healthy, muffin recipe and made a few modifications to mine. I used almond milk instead, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, a little vanilla, and two cups of frozen mixed berries (sliced strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries). Everything else was the same and, within a few minutes, the house smelled wonderfully and they taste amazing.

Great recipe as is. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon  because I love cinnamon and a shredded apple in place of 1/2 of the oil.
I have also substituted frozen (thawed) cranberries for the blueberries and they turned out good too.
Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for my motherâs birthday breakfast, and everyone loved them. Iâm giving it 5 stars because it turned out perfection. That said, I made 3 changes: I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, I took out 1/4 cup of sugar, and I used a mixture of whole wheat, white, & coconut flour. Will make again & again!!

I made this according to the directions without making substitutions and it produced a not too sweet muffin with a good texture.  It was a little bit dry and the muffin didn't have a lot of flavour but, for a simple recipe, it produced respectable results.  I would make this recipe again possible with a few minor alterations.

Good.  Like the other reviewers said, they are crumbly.   I did make them gluten free however,  so that may have led to the texture.   Will make again and experiment with ways to make  less crumbly.

Really good considering fairly low sugar and oats.  Not a 'dessert' muffin.  Great for breakfast or throughout the day.  I added a good pinch of cinnamon the second time I made these and I also filled the muffin tins closer to full than 2/3. Baked for 25 mins. I do a double batch and it makes 24.

I made this following the recipe without changing the ingredients.  I would make these again but next time I might add cinnamon for added flavor.  The muffins were a little bland.  These are not too sweet and very soft and fluffy.  Thank you for sharing.

I always make this and my family loves it. They are usually gone within 24 hours of coming out of the oven. It is even a great treat for breakfast. If you have a big family I totally suggest doubling this. If you have a small family totally double it and freeze some. Another thing that I haven't tried, but intend to is make mini muffins with this. They are a quick bite when you are on the go. If you do that note that they will definitely cook faster. Let me know how it goes if you try it. You can also use other fruits. My favorite besides blueberries are whole cranberries. They are a bit tart so you can add the whole amount of sugar. When using blueberries you can substantially lower the amount of sugar. You can't taste a big difference and it is a lot healthier. The blueberries give it a lot of sweetness, so if you like it sweet just add more blueberries. Even using the recipe the way it is adding more blueberries keeps it from being dry. Hope this helps and would love to hear more suggestions!

Very disappointing.  I made these and they had very little flavor.  My husband, who usually isn't picky at all, said "these aren't your best". :(  
Not sure if they need butter, or vanilla extract, or cinnamon (or all 3!!) but they definitely need something!  Bland, dense, and sponge-like.  Even warmed up with butter doesn't really help.  It also seems like the a majority of people who rated these 4-5 stars made several modifications.

Made these this morning and made only a couple of changes--used old-fashioned oats, substituted equal amount of applesauce for oil, and added the zest and juice of one lemon.  The muffins turned out very nice.  I can't imagine using 2 cups of blueberries--a healthy cup was more than enough.  We liked them very much and I will certainly make them again.

The only change I used was using white whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour. This may be why, but mine didn't rise very much. That being said, they are delicious, slightly sweet, and super easy and cheap to make with things I always have in my pantry.

They didn't rise as I had hoped for fluffy muffins. My baking powder is fresh so it wasn't that...anyway, hoping the kids will still eat them even tho they look like cooked blobs.

These turned out great! They taste like muffins instead of cupcakes, which is a problem many "muffin" recipes have. 

The original recipe is great, but I made some changes. I added some cinnamon, used a quarter cup of sugar instead of a third cup, and replaced half of the oil with applesauce.

I didn't make any changes. I will definitely make it again. My parents thought they were great too. I loved how easy they were. This something to make a bunch of and freeze so I can have some ready to go.

YUMMY. Notice it was all Caps!! 
I did make quite a few changes, but only to be a smidge healthier and Gluten Free... I used 1 cup GF All Purpose Baking flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar to replace the white sugar and then  1/4 cup applesauce to replace any oil. I only used the egg white and  I also added 1/2tsp of vanilla, used Almond milk, and used organic blueberries . Then cooked at 425 for only 15 min.

This muffin had a bitter taste, I'm thinking, due to the large amount (1 TBSP) of baking powder. The texture was nice, though. Any ideas on how to mask that bitter flavor?

I made this recipe as is but doubled the blueberries.  Delicious!  I'm a huge blueberry lover, pregnant and watching my weight so this recipe is one I will be making again.  Perfect for my craving without any guilt.

They are sweet and moist with the majority of the flavour coming from the berries.  Can you ask for more in a muffin?  Recipe made 18 muffins.

Loved these muffins, a few did fall apart, but I suppose it's because there is more oats than flour. They tasted great and they made a great breakfast for my picky kids. I will make these again.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (because that's all I keep in my house) and used about 2/3c. of cream mixed with 1/3c. of water because I realized we had finished up the milk earlier in the morning (oops).  I also added chocolate chips to make them more fun for my girls and they turned out great! We just took them out about 15 minutes ago, the texture is phenomenal and my oldest daughter said, "they were two thumbs up!" Definitely worth a try.

This recipes was perfect, not to sweet, hearty... The only change I made was I added a bit of vanilla extract and used unsweetened vanilla almond milk. I'll definitely be making these again soon!

I had fresh blueberries to use up from our produce co-op and decided to try this recipe. The reviews were all good, seemed easy to put together, had semi-healthy ingredients and was basic enough to customize in the future . . . I made these with gluten-free flour and oats (both from Trader Joe's) and organic cane sugar for a gluten-intolerant co-worker and daughter. I used 2 cups of berries because I had them, but one would've been fine too. I also added 1/2 t. of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. I baked them in silicon muffin cups for 20 minutes at 400. My husband and I had some for breakfast hot out of the oven. They were just OK. I think the gluten free ingredients just tasted "weird" to us. . . Next time I'll use regular flours and oats.

I've made these several times and each time I've tweaked the recipe a bit.  It's a great recipe to play with and most recently I used almond milk instead of dairy milk.  It was yummy!

These muffins are not too sweet but very moist.  I used regular oats and NOT quick oats.  I also used almond milk in place of dairy milk, and added about 1.5 c. of blueberries.  The muffins did not fall apart like some others have stated.

I just took the muffins out of the oven and eating them while typing this review......they weren't dry at all or dense! I cooked them at 400 for about 18 minutes and maybe could of been taken out at 16 minutes........I used half white flour and half whole wheat, used brown sugar and added a bit more, applesauce instead of oil, and non fat Lactaid milk, I also added more blueberries, which I won't do next time, it  was a bit too much. I put in some cinnamon which I don't even taste, and some vanilla.   Next time I will put in flaxseed which I had out but forgot to add. They aren't super sweet but definitely not bland. I am trying to figure out why so many people said they were dry, maybe over mixed? I will make again because I feel they are healthy with the changes I made.....enjoy!!

Followed recipe exactly.  The batter was very thin !!!  I would have added more flour, but thought the oats might absorb some liquid, si I let it go.....  IF I were to make these again.... I might add 1/2 the milk to the oatmeal and soak first.   Then add some flour if still thin.  Also, because of the batter, my huge berries sunk to the bottom.  
I was not as impressed with this recipe.  Will go back to plain blueberry muffins.

These are disappearing quickly as I rate them. I substituted honey for the sugar, used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour, and used old-fashioned (large-flake) oats. Also used frozen mixed berries, coated with a little flour instead of the blueberries. Wonderful!

These muffins don't last in my house! My toddler asks for them several times a day. 
In my version I replace the oil with applesauce, I put slightly less than 1 cup flour, and I double the blueberries because they are so yummy! I also bake them for only 20-22 mins, as I found 25 mins dried them out too much to my liking. 
I have also tried this same recipe with chocolate chips and chopped walnuts instead of blueberries...Delicious!

My first time making blueberry muffins from scratch and they turned out great! I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon per other reviews for added flavor. I also sprinkled a little oats on the top to make them look nice. I cooked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and they came out perfect! They're not dry at all and taste delicious! I will definitely be making them again!

Delicious! Used Traditional Oats instead of quick oats, almond milk instead of cow milk, and fresh marionberries instead of blueberries and they turned out amazing! I love that they don't taste like the little sugary cakes you buy in a grocery store bakery, and something that is actually quite nice for breakfast. If I made it with blueberries I would probably add a bit of apple sauce or banana though, because they are a tad on the dry side, especially without the berry juice mixed in like with my marionberries.

I followed the substitution of others... using apple sauce instead of oil, using half whole wheat flour, and brown sugar. Doubled the recipe. Cooked at 400 for 20 minutes.  Next time I will definitely add cinnamon.

I was looking for a muffin recipe that used oats.  The only change I made was I substituted fresh strawberries for the blueberries, since that's what is in season right now, and I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  I'm making them to take to a friend, but I wanted to try one out of the oven to see how they turned out.  It was so good, I had to have a second.  Thanks for sharing!

These are definitely not for the cakey-muffin lovers - but they're delicious!  I added some ground flax and a little bit of agave for some extra sweetness.

at 20minute in a dark nonstick pan (425 degrees) these were VERY brown on the top and not done in the middle.  Don't think it's my oven because I don't have issues with other recipes.  Next time I'll bake at 375.

Very delicious! I only made 3 adjustments to the recipe: 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (1/2 cup reg flour), 1/4 cup brown sugar (1/4 cup white sugar), 1 tsp of vanilla :-) yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly, doubled it because i have teenage boys in the house, with the exception of adding a frozen mixed berry combination instead of just blueberries and they turned out FABULOUS... Within a half hour of coming out of the oven they were half gone!!!!

Definitely a keeper , gonna try a peach version tomorrow!!! Will keep you in the loop lol

This is a very good base recipe, I was looking for something to use in order to substitute with what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup oats and 1/2 cup bran, whole wheat flour, I didn't have enough milk or any oil, so I used 3/4 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup applesauce, and about 4oz of yogurt.  I added cinnamon & pumpkin spice.  I also had some blueberry/marmalade compote leftover so I used that along with some frozen blueberries.  I basically ended up with a new recipe, but will definitely make again.  Because of all the changes, my muffins were not "light + fluffy" more hearty.

To die for, or rather, TO LIVE FOR muffins. I followed the recipe, took suggestions and made very few changes: 1)I used 1/3 C white whole wheat flour as part of the white flour measure (I always use King Arthur flours) and sifted it once. 2)Added a generous 1/2-2/3 cups more blues, to make it just under 2 cups that someone else suggested, 3)added about 1 TBSP of flour to them as they sat, 4)filled texas style muffin tins half way & baked closer to a full 20 mins on 350. Also added cinnamon.  Last of all, I will add a bit more sugar so you barely notice it. I used fresh picked, frozen blues from Springtime, made them in June & they were fabulous!
I just bought frozen ones and will try them. The 1/3 cup of WHITE whole wheat flour is perfect, and not too heavy.I ate 5 of the good sized muffins, of the 8 the recipe made. YUMMMM.

This was good for a healthy muffin and they stayed fairly fresh for at least a day after making them. I substituted half of the white flour for wheat four, half of the oil for unsweetened applesauce, and half of the sugar for stevia sweetener.

We subbed whole wheat flour and added a few more blueberries. They were a hit with the whole family. My husband ate 4 right off and took some to work for snack and my 2 year old ate 1 1/2 which never happens.

These were really good! I used more than the recommended amount of blueberries and used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. They still turned out great! It probably made them a little bit heavier and not as fluffy but the taste was great! I will definitely make these again!

These are perfect to have with yogurt for breakfast or to have as a snack mid-day. I used applesauce instead of oil for a healthier alternative. Will definitely use this great base to experiment with other kinds of muffins in the future!

I love this recipe, have made it several times now. My boyfriend loves it as a breakfast snack alternative to regular boring oatmeal. I use brown sugar rather than white, and increase the amount to 1/3 cup as I found them just a touch bland. Also I add a tiny pinch of cloves and cinnamon for a little extra flavour. Delicious and reasonably healthy!

I just made these muffins, they are cooling on my counter. I found the recipe easy and trust me i am no baker! I havent made anything from scratch in a long time. Because I didnt have any vegetable oil i subsituted butter. I also added Vanilla and subbed in whole wheat flour for all purpose. They smell great but they didnt rise much ( prob because i dont know what im doing so not a concern for me. :)) For the topping I just sprinkled a little brown sugar. I do plan on making them again!

These are so simple and so delicious! I love that they aren't too sweet and the oatmeal makes them very hearty and adds great texture (I used quick cook steel cut oats). I used two cups of blueberries and had to substitute for the milk and baking powder because of allergies, and they still turned out soft and yummy and full of flavour!

Great easy recipe with things I already had on hand! I did use 1/2 wheat flour per other's suggestions (since I had some to use up) and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Love that it makes one pan-worth but could easily be doubled or more. Will be making these again and freezing them for breakfast for me and my baby girl!

I have made this batch of muffins twice already this week, and both my husband and I adore them. I substituted the all purpose flour with SPELT flour and the milk with SOY milk, due to my husbands milk and wheat intolerance... and I also made one batch with frozen berries, which was just as delicious. 

So if you have milk and/or wheat intolerance, it is a great recipe for substitutions!!!

Loooove these muffins, I've made them so many times and they're always fantastic. I substituted the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour, and I cut the sugar to 1/8 cup, because with the blueberries I don't think it's necessary. The result is a hearty breakfast muffin, so delicious and warm in the morning. :)

I used a cup of peaches instead of blueberries. I also used splenda instead of sugar and I used half whole wheat and half white flour. I enjoy the wholesome flavor of the muffins. It was a bit too salty so next time I will reduce the salt. Also the edges were slightly to brown for my liking so I will turn down the temperature next time too, Overall they were very tasty though.

I make these all the time - slicing them in half the following mornings and toasting them.   Changes that I made were using white wheat flour, adding 1/4 c. splenda and 1 packet stevia.  Don't try using just stevia-- it won't work.

These were ok.  Nothing to really rave about, but not bad either.  I added a little cinnamon to the recipe.  I think they could use to be a little more sweeter, maybe some brown sugar.

Healthy idea for muffins but very bland even after adding more sugar and using evaporated milk instead of regular milk. Will try again using less oats and adding a touch of brown sugar and maybe some vanilla extract.

I used dried blueberries as I like to keep the fresh for eating plain! Because of this, I added a splash more milk. The muffins were very good, but crumbly. They needed butter as they were a bit dry, but I would definitely make them again. I will try with Craisins next!

I found them a little dry so I added more milk. I also made them with raspberries, raspberries and blueberries, and chocolate chips. All turned out very good.

Very good recipe! Sweet enough with a good texture. I added 2 cups instead of the 1 because we love blueberries so much. We love them at our house!

Great considering their nutritional values and low fat low cal options. Definitely not a sweet muffin, some strusel topping would probably help. Not the best muffin ever but can't get much better for the calories! Try it with raspberries too!

LOVE! I have made these before, and am making them right now to take a bunch on a long road trip tomorrow for a healthy snack.  I used whole wheat flour and fat free milk w/ a Tablespoon of Lemon juice.  Made a WONDERFUL muffin.  I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.

Taste and texture were good, however the muffins stuck to the papers and they did not rise very well.  May try recipe again with some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

Although,I do not feel comfortable rating this recipe at all since I made it using the suggestions of others and the muffins turned out really bad -- I did give them three stars because they have the potential to be good if you do NOT read and follow the suggestions. I followed the suggestion about brown instead of white sugar and applesauce instead of oil.  They came out really dense and without any real flavour (even my four year old, who LOVES muffins didn't finish one).  If I ever made these again, I would follow the recipe and use the "high calorie" ingredients!

It'd give about a 3 1/2.  Used all applesauce instead of oil and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Also added 1 tsp of lemon zest which was nice.  Moist and tasty, but lacking a little.

These were not sweet at all. I think they need more sugar, maybe some brown. I added a little bit of flax seed, but I doubt that's why they were so bland.

These are good, but a little dry. The only variation I made was to use 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour with 3/4 cup regular flour. I also used a shallower tin and ended up with 17 muffins rather than 12. Next time I'll try a little brown sugar and possibly another egg.

Excellent recipe! Only thing different was I added approx. 1/8 tsp. of almond extract, chopped walnuts for crunch, & a bit of cinnamon.  I soaked the oatmeal in the milk like others suggested.  Baked in cupcake pan & turned out to be just the right size for us.

I made these with several substitutions and managed to not mess up too badly...  ;)  I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and I used banana instead of oil (similar to how some will use applesauce instead of oil.)  They came out textured and moist and *hopefully* healthy.  I also like to use mini-muffin pans for making muffins.  They come out perfectly bite-sized for snacks.  My husband loved them.

I made some modifications to this recipe as recommended by some other reviewers (used 1/2 wheat flour, and used 1/2 C brown sugar instead of white sugar). I also used 1 mashed, overripe banana instead of the oil. I used 3/4 of a cup frozen blueberries, about the same amount of frozen cherries, and then a handful of dark chocolate chips. They turned out quite well, and are still relatively healthy.

Good recipe, was looking for a healthy muffin recipe to use with my fresh blueberries. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of regular sugar. I will try soaking the oats in the milk next time to soften, that's a great idea. I will also add the vanill and cinnamon and maybe try the struesel topping sometime. Thanks again for a great base recipe.

this recipe is simple and delicious! I followed it to the letter and it's the first time I have used a recipe without having to reduce the amount of sugar in it.  I did add a dash of vanilla into the batter, and sprinkled the tops of the muffins with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  I baked them into mini loaves and my friends really enjoyed them!

I just baked a batch and these are very good!!  I tweaked the ingredients to match with our food choices.  We do not use refined sugars, flours, or oils in our home.  So, I used whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. sucanat (unrefined sugar), and 1/4 c. cooled melted butter (instead of oil).  I also took the advice of adding more blueberries.  I also added 2 tbs. flax seed meal.  

I baked the muffins at 400Âº for 20 minutes.  These turned out moist and yummy!!

These muffins are super.  I love the oatmeal in them.  It gives a great texture and they are moist.  I did bake them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, not 425.  My Jenn Aire wall oven tends to be a few degrees high.  They were perfect.  Maybe those who have complained they were a little dry, could try a slightly lower oven temperature.  Overall a great recipe!  I made 12 last night and have 3 left!!  Will definitely make many more times in the future.  Thanks for sharing this recipe on line!

They were good. I followed others' advice and sweetened it a bit to 1/2 c. sugar and 1/4 c. extra blueberries. Even then they were not that sweet.

This recipe works really well for a super low fat treat. I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and old fashioned oats instead of quick, increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and used frozen blueberries, and 1 tsp cinnamon. You won't get a light muffin making these changes, more chewy but if you are trying to cut fat and increase fiber it works really well.

Well, I just made these tonite and they seemed to turn out pretty good!  I used soy milk instead of regular milk and I used olive oil because it was the only oil we had, but they still turned out really yummy :-)  I also added some chopped pecans - a delicious lil' extra!  Thanks for this recipe!  I'll definitely make it again.

These were okay.  I am going to try them again with some adjustments.  I used oat flour instead of white and my husband said they tasted like playdough.  I think I will use white/wheat combo and see how they taste.

I suppose this is as good as a healthy blueberry muffin can taste. Better warmed up.

This is perfect.  Was looking for a healthy muffin for snacks for my kids.  I used 2 cups of blueberries and coated them in 2 tbls of brown sugar before folding them in.  This recipe is flexible for modifications - will try next time with apples.

Fabulous!  Thank you for this yummy healthy recipe.  The only change I made was to add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, but otherwise perfect and so quick and easy.  My 2 yr old daughter loved them - without additional sugar. This is exactly what I was looking for, but like the other reviewers said, if you're looking for something more like a supersweet box recipe, this is not the muffin recipe for you.

Average. These do not really taste like muffins.  Seem more like a bran muffin.  I made for my boyfriend and he was expecting a muffin and was disappointed.  I think he was expecting something much sweeter, more like cake.  On the positive side, if you are looking for a muffin that is lower in calories, you would like this muffin. Overall I would rate these as "not bad" but nothing special.

These muffins are great. I was looking for a recipe for my son (14 months) who decided he didn't like oatmeal! I will admit that my hubby thought they weren't sweet enough, although it didn't stop him from eating a few. My son and I both loved them. The only changes I made was that I used 1 1/2 c of frozen blueberries. This was the perfect amount. I will def. make these again!

I made mini muffins with this recipe and they turned out great! Baked at 350 degrees for about 16-17 minutes.  I also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil to make them healthier. I thought the muffins tasted great, but my husband and son thought they needed more sugar.  Perhaps I'll add more next time.

this is a nice muffin.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and almond milk due to a milk allergy.  They still came out great.  I took the muffins out of the pan and let them cool on a wire rack, as another reviewer suggested. The liners didn't stick to the muffin at all.  Be sure to use all the berries it calls for.  That way you'll get the sweetness they need since there's not a lot of sugar.  I'll definitely make these again! Oh, I should add, my 2 1/2 year-old daughter liked them too!

These are pretty good.  I used 1/2 c. wheat germ and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and on the advice of the other reviewers I used 1/2 c. of (cinnamon) sugar and 2 c. of frozen blueberries.  I think the frozen blueberries I buy must be the big blueberries because there are too many blueberries in this with 2 c.  But they are good nonetheless.

I tried this recipe and they looked great when they came out of the oven.  However, they had no taste to them at all.  I even added cinnamon, thinking it would give them an extra boost of flavor.  They tasted so blan that I got ride of them, I just couldn't eat them.

Something about the ingredients do NOT come together very well in this recipe.  I am a pretty experienced baker and the result I got from this recipe was an overly chewy and tasteless muffin....  Save your blueberries for something else.

This is very good.  I followed some of the advice already mentioned.  I turned down the heat (though mine was in the oven about 17-18 min), I added a bit of sugar to the top and cinnamon and vanilla to the mix.  I really like the oatmeal in the mix and will make this again.

These muffins were very bland to me.  I like sweet & nutritious-tasting muffins & these weren't even close to my expectations.  Like other reviews I only cooked them for 15 minutes.  Since I love the combination of blueberries & oatmeal, I will try another reviewers suggestion by adding extra sugar & blueberries to see if more sweetness comes out.  For now, I will probably just add tons of butter to my current batch when I eat them.

This makes a nice moist, light but hearty muffin.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries (didn't even thaw them and they turned out fine).  I also used only 1/8 cup of oil and replaced the other 1/8 a cup of oil with yogurt.  Oh, and I added about a Tbsp of dried candied ginger.  This gives a nice contrast with the sweetness of the blueberries.  A great recipe.  Thanks!

Yes, lower your oven to 400 degrees and bake 15 minutes.  They will be on the brown side.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of honey instead of the sugar.  They were lightly sweet and hearty little muffins. I dig it!

Pretty good recipe for plain blueberry muffins.  I baked a second batch for only 15 minutes, and will probably lower the time again in the future.

This is an excellent oatmeal muffin recipe, but you might get more than 12 muffins. I used 1/4 c. yogurt instead of oil, and I can't taste any difference. Also, I used raspberries instead of blueberries, and of course they work just fine.

This recipe was pretty good.  I would just bake it for 15 minutes maybe, check to see if it's done, and then bake it longer if need be.  I felt like I baked mine for too long.  Other than that, these were delicious and healthy!

These muffins were pretty good. I used dried blueberrries instead of fresh, they needed to be reconstituted first, though. I will definitely make theses again. I adjusted my oven by 25 degrees lower and baked for less time and they still were a little overdone.

These are good muffins.  They are not overly sweet so you can really taste the blueberries.  I substitute applesauce for the oil and save 40 calories and 4.6g of fat per muffin (based on 12 muffins).  I prefer them "Texas size".  I did find that I had to lower the temperature by 25 degrees(and shorten the baking time for 12 by 5 min) in order not to burn the tops.  Fresh from the oven, the papers do not remove well, but the next day they come off just fine.

A perfect blend of healthy ingredients, texture, and taste.  I highly recommend them for anyone who likes oatmeal and/or blueberries.
