All I can say is WOW! I was a little nervous about making this as I have never cooked flank steak before, so I made sure to marinate it for as long as I could to ensure it would be juicy and tender (48 hours, to be exact!). Instead of grilling, I broiled it in the oven for 4 minutes on each side, then seared it on a frying pan to get a nice crust (for about a minute in total). I also put the marinade into a saucepan and boiled it, then poured a bit over the steak while it was broiling, and then poured some more over it when it was ready. It turned out absolutely amazing - my husband just loved it and I have deemed it good enough to serve this Sunday at our family dinner!

I've been naking this recipe for over 20 years and it is THE best BBQ recipe around.  It feeds a huge crowd for very little money.  Here's a tip I discovered about 7 years ago....when flank steak is on sale, buy several and freeze in the marinade.  All you have to do is pull one out an the 24 or so hours it takes to defrost in the fridge makes it tender and moist at grilling time.  The rarer it is, the better it is.  And cold the next day is heaven!

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  Leave it at least for 10 hours in the bag in the fridge.  I just poked at the steak repeatedly with the tip of my knife along the grain all over the steak so it wouldn't affect presentation.  Like anything its good to practice this recipe before trying it out with the crowd you aim to please but it went well on the first time around marinated for about 10 hours.

This is unbelievable...I let this marinade about 2-3 days. My kids ate it up like candy and asked for it at least once a week. I had a good flank steak marinade I'd been using, but this tops it! Thanks.

I have been using this recipe for years and it is fantastic. For the prople asking what kind of wine to use, I use any red I have in the house. If you don't have wine the recipe is also good with pineapple juice.

Really good! The first time I made this, I didn't use the sugar, I didn't use the wine replacing it with Rice Wine Vinegar and I let mine marinate for 2 1/2 days. It was great! The second time I made this I followed the recipe to a "T" and let it marinate just overnight. It was fantastic as well! Really great recipe!Very versatile! Thanks!

I change things around some...try adding Worshestorshire and sliced onions, with sliced ginger. I use this with whole flap meat. Try it with a 2" plus thick blade roast. Marinate for a longer time, in a plastic zip bag,at least 1-3 days..remove, blot roast/meat dry, cover with moist cloth towel,  and keep in fridge for another 24 hours..remove meat 1-1/2 hours prior to cooking. By slicing the ginger and adding onions changes the teriyaki flavor. If I want to go for Teriyaki, follow it more closly. This is great for larger cuts of meat. The dry resting in the fridge really starts the tenderizing process. I use red wine. & throw in a bay lief too!!

This is a great recipe.  I made the following changes due to what I had on hand:  I didn't use any wine and I used ginger powder instead of fresh ginger.  I also only marinated it for 1 hour and it was flavorful and tender.  My boyfriend loved it!!!

Love this one, it reminds me of my Mom's flank steak.  I like to make a half batch (easy on the soy)of the marinade and simmer/reduce it as a "steak sauce".

First time i ever had this.  It was so juicy and went perfect with the white rice we had.  all I did differently was make some of my own teriyaki sauce for a topping.  1/4 cup soy sauce, clove of garlic crushed, few sprinkles of ginger powder, tbsp Molasses, and a couple tbsp of brown sugar (to taste),  then I put them in a small sauce pot and heat.  Then mix 1 tbsp cold water and 1 tbsp corn starch to get a white slurry mix.  Pour it into the heated teriyaki sauce and cook on high, mixing until thick...  Thats it..  Will be making this again.

This was easy and yet so delicious! I marinated for 2 days. I seared it to get those great grill marks then stuck it in the oven for about 4 mins each side. Came out great! I also added some green onions to the marinade and also reserved some of the marinade to drizzle on top. Served it on top of brown rice and it was awesome.

Great use of a flank steak. I combined this with "Sweet and Spicy Green Beans" along with white rice and it was a hit. For the wine, I used Sherry, and I swapped out olive oil for sesame oil in the hopes it would give it a bit more asian flavor. I think it was a good choice, as it had the slightly nutty aroma of sesame and just a hint of flavor from it. It would have been just as good with olive oil, so you don't miss out on anything by following the recipe exactly. The only other variation I've made was using low sodium soy sauce. Took about 8 minutes per side to cook on my grill to perfection and about half that to make it disappear off our plates.

Good flavor. I boiled and reserved the marinade to use as a sauce over this and rice. If you do this: be careful to only drizzle a little bit. I made the mistake of pouring almost all of the sauce over our 4 plates at dinner and you could have eaten it with a spoon! Drizzle a little and have the rest at the table for those who want more.

Fabulous. I recommend  long marinating, preferably overnight. The flavor is very nice, though I prefer a low sodium soy sauce.

A red wine is what is usually used with red meat. Not a dessert wine, however. And use a good quality. No cooking wines, please. For those who can't have garlic, use shallots. Tastes just as good. The marinade is also cook with chicken.

I usually don't bother to review recipes, and I don't even like steak that much, but this steak was fantastic! Followed the directions exactly except marinated for about 36 hours. The taste was indescribable...more than the sum of its parts!

Been making this recipe for more than 25 years.   No matter how I tweak it, it is always wonderful.   The secret is marinating long enough.   24 hrs. Is the minimum in my house.   36 or 48 is best.   Broiling or on the grill are both great.   Must slice the flank steak against the grain.  If you don't it will be chewy.  It should literally melt in your mouth

The only way too cook a flank. Very tender and yummy. I didn't change a thing. Had it with Jasmine rice and broccoli.

Awesome marinade for Flank Steak. Only marinated for 6 hours but it worked perfectly!  I only had Extra Virgin Olive Oil...I would not use that again because of its strong flavor.  Perfect!

Very easy and amazing. Instead of discarding marinade, boil it and use it as a side sauce. I will make this over and over and over.

Very tasty. I let it marinate for 48hrs. I seared it first then baked it. It turned out great, but i definitely want to try it on the bbq.

WOW~! This was amazing.  We actually used chicken instead of flank steak, marinated it for a couple of hours, and the flavor was out of this world.  Pair it will a bed of rice and some steamed bok choy, and you have yourself a healthy, tasteful dinner.

This is our favorite "Japanese" dinner. The marinade works great for chicken and even marinated turkey burgers stay moist and flavorful. I skip the oil in the marinade to cut calories and fat and it doesn't affect the taste at all. Great recipe.

A wonderful marinade and very easy to make.  I use it for stir fry and use rice wine.  I think the recipe is fine as it is, but if you want a stronger flavor just increase the garlic and ginger root.

This is the best marinade I have ever made!  My family loves this and now is on the weekly menu!!  Grilling is definitely better than broiling!  It works great on chicken too! Will try on pork chops next!

This was awesome, I think the red wine really makes it. I pounded my steak so it was even, then poked holes in it wih a fork for better absorbtion. Marinated it 8 hours then grilled each side 5 minutes. Perfect and pink! I reduced the sauce an served it on the side, also served with rice and grilled veggies. Everyone loved it..my go to summer steak recipe now! Thanks

This was an okay recipe.  I think the marinade is good, but I prefer to cut my steak into thin strips to put on skewers.  Doesn't seem as chewy that way.

WOW!!!  I made this for my husband, sister, and brother-in-law a few weeks ago (when my newborn was only a few days old - needless to say an easy recipe!)  My sister and her husband are grilling freaks, so I'm always looking for recipes to one-up them.  This did it!!  The ginger really makes this special.  The meat was perfectly tender, cooked perfectly after the time mentioned.  I will make this again and again!!  (Although I tried it with a cheap steak the other night.. not recommended.  Spend the extra $5 for the flank steak and you won't be sorry.)

This was better than I expected.  I didn't add ginger, since I'm not a big fan, but loved the combo of flavors. Got raves from all our friends last night. I scored the flank steak and then let marinade overnight - super tender (esp for flank).  If I wanted more of an asian flavor I would add some sesame oil and sesame seeds.

I really enjoyed this marinade. I used about half the ginger recommended and marinated it overnight. The meat was tender and had just the right amount of ginger and saltiness. I broiled instead of grilled and it was marvelous!

DELICIOUS ! ! !  My entire family loved this.  I followed the directions almost perfectly.  I did throw in one more garlic clove.  I did mince my garlic.  I used white cooking wine.  This recipe is so simple and good.  We ate this like we never ate steak before in our lives.  Thanks for such a super recipe.

I make this every time flank steak is on sale. I’ve never done it on an outdoor grill but instead use the griddle that came with my stove. The only change I make is to sub rice wine vinegar for the wine, and I usually leave it to marinate for 48 hours. I flip it 2-3 times and cook to an internal temp of 135 for a perfectly succulent medium rare. Thanks for a great recipe for one of my favorite weeknight dinners!

I made this as listed except I sliced the flank steak thin and marinated only 2 hours. Then I cooked the marinade and cooked the steak the last few minutes in the sauce. Served it over rice and it was excellent. The marinade/sauce had good flavor  definitely a keeper.

I loved it and so did my husband.  I did not put the wine in the sauce, but I used everything else. The meat was so moist and tasty.  Will make it again.

It was a hit for company. We all agreed it was just enough flavor!  We removed the steak and marinade from the refrigerator for quite awhile before it went on the grill. Cooking it 6minuted a side was a little too long. It was medium to well and a little too done for our preference but it was still amazing!

No need to say more than is already states. Tasted great even with only being able to marinade it for a couple hours.

Excellent! I added 1/4 cup sugar to the marinade after the flank steak was removed.  I then reduced the marinade by 25% over medium heat on the stove top.. It was a great sauce passed around the table to pour over the flank steak.

I used the base recipe but used a splash of rice wine in place of the wine, and a tablespoon or so of honey in place of the sugar as I had these on hand. I marinaded it, flipping occasionally, for about 3 hours and did a flash grill over high heat on the BBQ until it was medium-rare. Let it rest for about 8 minutes, tented, and then thinly sliced, bedded on Jasmine rice and it was DELISH and oh so tender.

This turned out wonderful.  I subbed dried minced onions, added a little sesame oil & let it marinate overnight.  Cooked it on the grill at 400 F for 7 minutes per side...it was so flavorful & tender that we could cut it with a butter knife at the dinner table!  Cannot wait to try the leftovers on a salad tomorrow.  Great recipe that transforms a tough peice of meat into something moist, juicy & delectable!

I did not change any of the ingredients and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband commented on how tasty and tender the meat was.   I do have a small recommendation:  Use a sharp knife to stab holes in the flank steak (both sides) before putting it in the bag..  That helps the steak soak up the marinade.

I butterflied my flank steak and lightly scored it to add more flavor. Also added more garlic and ginger as recommended by another review. It was delicious!

This came out absolutely amazing and was incredibly easy. Even with only marinating for five horus and chunking the ginger instead of grating (I had no idea grating ginger would be so difficult) it is by far the best marinade recipe I have ever used. Also, we served it over white rice with some Frank's Red Hot and Sweet Soy Glaze...amazing. BF and I agreed it could be our weekly Sunday night meal.

Made a flank steak for dinner on Friday night and had half of it left over. Made this marinade for the rest of the steak using Amino's, instead of soy for health issues; used all the other ingredients and sautéed the steak on a non-stick pan. Hubby loved it and so did I. Next time I'll try this with chicken or pork. Great recipe.

Great flavor!  Our steak was a little tough though...  I only marinated it for 8 hours.  I'll have to marinade it longer next time.

My boyfriend grilled this up last night and it was SO tender and delicious. He said the trick is to marinade for 24 hours and not the 8 indicated in the recipe. This was so flavorful and tender, my mouth waters just thinking about it. It would be great served with asian inspired snap peas with bambooshoots or water chestnuts. Maybe some asian lettuce wraps for an appetizer! Highly recommend!

Wow! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger (about a teaspoon because I didn't wan't too overwhelming of a ginger flavor). I sliced a cheaper cut of meat (london broil on sale!!) and let it marinade all day  (included a sliced up onion with the meat) and then broiled it for dinner. Everyone, kids included, loved this recipe. Thank you!

Although this turned out to be pretty tasty, I was disappointed that the marinade flavor wasn't stronger.  I marinated the flank steak over night, and it still wasn't very flavorful. Not sure if I did something wrong, but I will give it another try anyway!
