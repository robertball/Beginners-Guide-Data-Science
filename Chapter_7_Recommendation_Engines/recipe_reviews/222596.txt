I did my best to cut this recipe in half and only use a can and a half of biscuits. I only cut back the biscuit amount and butter--I kept the spices the same. I did not add the parmesan to the butter mixture, I sprinked it over the knots after brushing on the butter mixure before baking. Very simple, simple enough for my youngest child to help me make. Four and a half stars.

These were ok, a little oily. I didn't brush on the oil/parmesan mix after baking because the parmesan wouldn't be melted enough. So I rolled out the dough as the recipe suggested, but put the parm mix IN the middle of the dough, rolled it up and made the knot, placed it on the sheet and put another dollop of parm mix on top before baking instead of after. This way the parmesan would melt, the seasonings would meld in the dough more and the outter parmesan would get crispy. Next time I'll use less oil since store bought biscuits are usually oily/buttery enough on their own.

These are a good, fairly quick accompaniment to soups, chowders, pasta, etc. Whenever I make these, I use measurements to taste, including the oil, since I only use 1 can of biscuits to make these. I've also subbed out a small amount of melted butter in lieu of oil with success. I omit the oregano (not a fan) in favor of basil and instead of parsley, sometimes I'll use chives. Either way, these are tasty!

These were great! Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and added a sprinkle of cheddar cheese the last minute of cooking. They turned out awesome - a nice change to our typical garlic bread!!!

These were delicious.  I did however  substitute  crescent rolls as others have done as a prefer them over biscuits. Used butter instead of oil.  Prefer a little less oregano.
