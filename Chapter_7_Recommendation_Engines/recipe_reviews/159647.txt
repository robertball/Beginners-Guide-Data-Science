Awesome. I used Neuman's raspberry lemonade. That was the only change I made. SO good.

Delicious. It gives a great buzz at the end of a long week too. I didn't have cranberry so I used 100% grape juice.

Wasn't my most favorite.  I couldn't find light lemonade, so I used regular and  it was too sweet to me. I had better martinis than that. I guess it is all about taste preference.
