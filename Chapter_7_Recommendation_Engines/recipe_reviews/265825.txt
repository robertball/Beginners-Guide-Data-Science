Made as written and this was super fast and simple. On a side note, I realize the recipe submitter was using what they had on hand. Laughing cows are $4 a wheel in my area so it made the dish a little expensive. It did make the eggs nice and creamy but I imagine any cheese you had on hand would work including cream cheese. With that being said, this is super east, fast, and filling. Don't forget the Sriracha!
