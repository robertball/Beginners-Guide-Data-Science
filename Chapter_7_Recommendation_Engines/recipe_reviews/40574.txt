Great recipe but I did want to post a caution. I see  a number of recent reviewers have said they used left-over marinade for a sauce. Be very careful if you do this as marinades used with raw meat need to be boiled for a few minutes (not just brought to a boil) to be safe to eat (because of possible bacteria in raw meat-samonella in the case of chicken.) It is safer to make extra marinade and reserve some to be used as sauce as some reviewers have said they did.

I printed out this recipe on 11/6 and I've made this recipe 5 times!  I made it while visiting a friend and everyone raved about it.  It's easy and delicious.  It combines just the right amount of salty and sweet. ****Note, if you don't have pineapple juice on hand, I used orange juice and it came out just as good.

Yummy! This was great.  I marinated this for 2 days.  I grilled the chicken instead of baking.  I also made another batch of marinate and boiled it with about 2 tsp of cornstarch and served it as a dipping sauce.  The whole family loved it and ate every bite.

Very good! I added minced garlic instead of powdered, added some ground ginger and used sesame oil in place of the vegetable. I think that really added to the dish. Also, at the end I placed pinapple rings on top of each chicken breast & took the marinade & mixed corn starch on the stove top to make a sauce for the chicken. Ate this with white rice & a salad. So good!!

I made this recipe with chicken tenderloins and baked it in the oven with the sauce for approximately forty minutes at 350 degrees.  I marinated it for about seven hours and it turned out very yummy!  It's an easy recipe that I will definitely make again.

This teriyaki sauce is delicious!!!  I added a little fresh ginger to it and fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also cut the chicken into chunks, marinated them and then pan grilled them with a little of the sauce.  Absolutely wonderful!!

Fantastic!  I will be using this marinade for many different dishes in the future.  Like a previous person wrote, I will never buy Teriyaki sauce again.  I boiled the leftover marinade for 5 minutes and used it as a sauce. ..added a little cornstarch in water to thicken. I also cooked the chicken in a frying pan because I wasn't confident the chicken would cook under the broiler in 5 minutes and I didn't have time to bake it for 30.  It was great!  The edges carmelized a little from the sugar in the marinade. We ate it with white rice and steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm just starting to dabble in the world of cooking and I tried this last night. I put in a little more garlic powder, stabbed the chicken fillet with a fork, marinated it for about 40- 50 minutes and broiled it for 5 min.  My husband kissed me on the lips and thanked for me for such a good dinner he enjoyed it so much. It turned out really well.  I'm not sure how I'm going to top it. Thanks for the recipe suggestion!

This was really yummy Kate.  We used our chicken for salads and instead of vegetable oil, I used sesame.  Thanks for sharing.

My boyfriend and roommate loved this - and so did I! The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. I will *definitely* be using this one again.

2 hours is plenty of time to give the chicken a great flavor, but next time I am going to try to marinate it longer.

I was rather disappointed in this recipe bc it did not 'penetrate' the meat as much as I would have liked.  I followed it as listed...placing ingredients in a ziplock bag and placing in the fridge for 2 days.  What flavor we could detect was great...but once you were past the outside of the meat there was zero flavor.  I did use breast meat that had the skin removed and they were large.  Would recommend thinner cuts or strips to allow for better penetration of the marinade.

This was delicious flavorful chicken and we loved it! We grilled it and served it with steamed jasmine rice and veggies. I did change some things- added mostly vegetable oil but measured it a little bit under and added sesame oil to make the 1/4 cup, added 1/2 cup Kikkoman's teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce, used fresh minced garlic and gingerroot, and threw in some chopped green onion and toasted sesame seeds too. I used white pepper instead of black. I had enough marinade to do 9 small breast portions. I marinated for about 5 hours. I also only marinated in half the mix and basted the chicken with the other half while grilling. It was so tender and juicy and smelled so good on the grill. I think the pineapple juice is key. I was craving grilled chicken and so glad I chose this recipe. It reminds me of the grilled chicken that comes with rice bowls when I go those Flame Broiler type places. I liked this better! Thanks so much for the recipe !

I made this a couple of weeks ago with 8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.  In a word, Excellent! I grilled them with pineapple rings.  Just an FYI a 20 oz. can of pineapple slices has 6 oz. of juice.  So this time I put two cans on my shopping list so I can make the dipping sauce as someone suggested.

This is one to make for company!!!!  So delicious.  I used juice from a large can of pineapple chunks for the marinade, and pan-grilled the pineapple after cooking the chicken.  Served over a bed of rice with steamed broccoli. I'm still floating after eating this last night!

This was a great recipe. Thanks to another reviewer, I used orange juice instead of pineapple, and minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours, then cut it up into cubes in cooked in a skillet on the stove with ALL of the marinade until the sauce reduced by about half. Served over rice...delicious!

DELICIOUS!
I made the chicken in a frying pan after marinated for 1 day.I made extra sauce with the same amounts for the marinade, but adding 5 tbs of water+1 tbsp of cornstarch to the mix and boiling until it has the consistency I wanted.

MOM loved so much the sauce! while she was cutting some chicken ,she added some of the sauce . Then she said it was so delicious that she wanted more =) . THANKS for this recipe!

By the way.For side dish, I made chinese noodles(this and the chicken where a combination of asian recipes, both really good).
With leftovers, I made chicken teriyaki sandwiches.

This was an extremely sweet chicken. Not salty as the submitter has written. It tasted more like a Hawaii style marinade then a teriyaki, having said that, my kids raved at how much they loved it. Served over soy sauce and buttered rice. Pretty simple. I placed it in the oven at 375 for about 20 or so minutes until the thermometer read 160 degree internally. The sauce could have easily marinated 6 to 7 chicken breast. Even though this was a good recipe, I didn't find it tasting like teriyaki. Will make again for the kiddos.

This was fantastic! I took the suggestion of some other posters and used fresh garlic, ginger, and some sesame oil. I also threw some canned pineapple chunks in the marinade and under the broiler with the chicken. They turned out delicious!

Great teriyaki sauce!  I am using it for other things besides chicken, but it made great chicken.  Not too sweet, perfect amount of sweetness.

I added just a little bit of ginger and I made a second batch (without the oil) for after cooking.  We cut up the chicken and put it on skewers and grilled them.  I cooked up some veggies and rice and used the extra sauce to pour over.  It turned out great.

I marinated these only two hours and liked them.  next time I would marinate overnight, I think the flavor would be more intense.  Good recipe.

Very good! Added ginger to the mix and used minced garlic. I also used half veggie oil and half sesame oil. I made a separate batch of the marinade to use for the sauce, as others had done. I did have to broil longer...about 7 minutes a side, but chicken came out very juicy!

It was ok i find its better if you bake the chicken in the sauce b/c it comes out a lot more tender. This is a good base sauce to work from, next time i'll add my own stuff to it.

this recipe has so much potential for variations...
Use pineapple chunks and perhaps green peppers.
i add fresh ginger and cornstarch to the juice to simmer with after a stir fry...
or just skewer the pieces with the juice as a baste...
this is a classic in my book...

O-M-G this is DELICIOUS! I marinated the chicken overnight and hubby grilled them. I doubled the recipe and used this on 6 large breasts. I did add a little teriyaki sauce and about a tsp of ground ginger. We also grilled pineapple slices and made Fried Rice Restaurant Style from this site. What a wonderful dinner! The chicken turned out super moist. I cannot recommend this highly enough if you are in the mood for oriental food. Kate, thank you for posting this recipe. We were thankful to have it grace our dinner table.

Marinated for about 6 hours. Liked it much better than the bottled teriyaki sauce my husband sometimes uses. Much lighter and fresher taste. My picky 16 year old son had seconds and asked me to make it again soon!

The flavor was amazing. I marinated for 24 hours and it really soaked up a lot of deliciousness! I added 1 tsp of minced garlic and about a tsp of red pepper flakes for a lil spice! My bf loved the flavor and raved about it. Served it on a bed of brown rice with a side of broccoli. We can't wait to try it on the grill, maybe some kabobs with pineapple and peppers...YUM! Only 4 stars because we found the chicken a little tough, I'm thinking from the broiling. Oh and I had to open the kitchen window in the dead of winter from the smoke of the burning marinade. I think the grill will make this recipe 5 stars for sure!

Let chicken marinate for about 5 hrs and it was delicious! Next time I'm going to set some aside to pour over chicken and rice before serving. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Best Teriyaki I have had. Just as good and better than restaurant. I let it broil just a little longer to get get the grill look and taste. Also added a little more sugar and soy sauce and it was perfect.

This was lovely! I cut chicken fillets into bitesize pieces and marinated them for about 24 hours. Then I baked the pieces in the marinade in the oven for about 25 mins and finally gave them a quick 5 min roast on a pan before serving with boiled rice, fruity curry, and pineapple. The taste was delicious as is but next time I think that I will add a bit more garlic.

this recipe is a nice change. i did go by some of the reviews i had read. i used fresh garlic, and fresh ginger, tablespoon lemon juice, i also added sesame oil instead of olive oil, like another reviewer  had suggested. marinated for several hours. cooked on the grill with mesquite chips. AWESOME!! i have to tell you , i have never used sesame oil, and it is great. it gives a different taste then the average oil. you should try it sometime. and it is near the Chinese products in the grocery store. i marinated my chicken for four hours, and it came out very good. but next time i shall marinate it even longer. this is a nice change, thankyou.

This was great!  Easy too.  As I always do with recipes, I altered this one by using 1/2 can crushed pineapple and 8 chicken thighs (cause that's what I had :) I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 2-3hrs.  Served with brown rice and broccoli.  Kids loved it!  Yum!

This is a great teriyaki sauce recipe! I added a splash of vinegar and instead of garlic powder I used minced garlic. I marinated chicken breasts and barbecued them and it was GREAT! BBQ gives such a great flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you :)

A wonderful marinade!  It does taste just like what I've had in restaurants.  First time I made it, I didn't have pineapple juice so I subbed with a mixture of orange juice and apple juice.  This time I will grill the chicken w/ pineapple slices, and use foil on the grill.

I tend to taste as I go and that way made it taste salty. I used it to dip my steak in and it gave it good flavor. I tried to thicken it with flour, but it didn't work. My fault.

We liked this. In the future I would halve the oil and add rice wine vinegar. I cut my meat into strips and strung it on shish kebabs, so as to coat more surface area with marinade. We grilled this recipe instead of broiling it. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW. I love teriyaki chicken and I fell upon this recipe today and tried it. I followed the recipe exact, except I didn't have pineapple juice so I used the juice blend I had in my refrigerator of pineapple, banana, and orange. I also cut the chicken breasts in half because I was afraid that the outside would burn before it was finished cooking.

This recipe produces a somewhat sweet flavor, which adds a lot to the flavor of the chicken.  I marinated for 4 hours and broiled for about 6 minutes per side.  I boiled the marinade for 5 minutes then added a little corn starch and water to thicken and continued heating on low for about 5 additional minutes.  I put a little marinade on the chicken before broiling and then a little additional marinade when I turned.  I served this and the marinade with Basmati rice and red onions.  For the marinade, which I doubled, I used orange juice instead of pineapple juice as I cannot have pineapple juice and I also added a little ginger paste to the recipe.  This and a nice tossed salad make a wonderful dinner.  Thanks!

The flavor was great but when I broiled it, the chicken was not cooked so I had to bake it the rest of the way. I will make this again since it went over so well at my house but next time I will just bake it. I did thicken the sauce with corn starch on the stovetop and yum.

Teriyaki is usually too salty for me, so I only used half the soy sauce the recipe called for, and they turned out delicious. Sweet but still tangy. I also omitted the pineapple juice completely, and the sauce still tasted delectable.

This was a wonderful recipe!!  I pounded out my chicken breasts before marinading them... and left them overnight.  Then I cut them up into small strips and stir fried them.  Boiled the remaining marinade and added a little cornstach to make a little sauce to put over it.  Yummy!

I made this for the first time on SuperBowl Sunday. It was amazing and so easy. I marinated chicken breasts and pineapple rings then grilled them. We served them on ciabatta rolls with a side of pineapple salsa. It was a true hit with our guests who all asked for the recipe. I've missed "real" teriyaki since moving to Dallas and this really hit the mark.

These tasted great, however it was not done in the recommended amount of cooking time, so we had to microwave them for a few minutes. I think part of the problem was that the chicken was too thick. It should be pounded first!

This is easy and delicious. I usually have to increase the broiling time, maybe due to using large chicken breasts. Turns out great anyway, does not dry out like with some recipes. Goes great with jasmine rice and pineapple slices.

Excellent flavor, but after 24 hours of marinating a whole chicken it barely penetrated the meat. Will use on a batch of wings becauswe the flavor was so good.

I would recommend cutting up your chicken so that the marinade really gets all over and it cooks more quickly.  Also, boil the remaining marinade for a while and add some flour.  This will kill the germs and create a wonderful sauce.

Yummy! The first time I made it I marinated it for 7 hours but didn't taste much flavor then I decided to leave it overnight and it was DELICIOUS! 

The ONLY problem when broiling it in my stove...the marinated mixture burns and since the chicken is sitting in it, that burns as well. Don't use the broiler!

I tried it as the original recipe says and it was absolutely wonderful, everyone loved it. I tried it again after reading a review about putting sesame oil instead of vegetable one.. IT WAS TERRIBLE, a disaster! So I'll stick with the original one - serving with basmati rice.. just great!

GREAT marinade!  I have used it two ways:  1. marinate for 4-5 hours then grill and serve with a sweet barbecue sauce and grilled pineapple rings, 2. marinate chicken tender strips for 4-5 hours then stir fry with broccoli and carrots in a pre-made ginger teriyaki sauce over rice.

My daughter said this was the meal I've ever cooked. She's 8 and picky! The breasts I had were really thick so I had to keep flipping every 5 minutes but well worth it.  I took advise of the other reviews and made a side of sauce. My parents had rave reviews to.  So easy and delicious!

My family loves flavo & this recipe lacked some for us.  We felt something was missing.  I marinaded the chicken for about 30 hours.  We did cook this on the grill instead of the broiler, so maybe that had some impact on it?!??!  This would be a kid friendly recipe, I think!

This was alright. The marinade was extremely tasty but I guess it didn't soak that well with the chicken because the chicken wasn't that flavorful as the marinade. I might try and leave in a lot longer than one day next time.

I only marinated for about an hour so maybe that played a part on the flavors not coming through the chicken. Overall the whole family enjoyed and will make extra sauce next time for dipping/topping.

I opted to do a stir fry with this adding in onions, green bell pepper, bamboo shoots and snow peas and served it over Jasmine rice. The marinade was perfect and delicious. Thank you Kate!

This was good, really good! I made kabobs with this, using pineapple and red pepper for the kabobs. I marinated for about 4 hours and it was perfect. I used fresh garlic, about 3 cloves instead of powder and we were so please with the results. A definite keeper!

I didn't bake it, I threw it in a pan with some veggies and added a little teriyaki glaze from Sprouts, but I marinated the chicken over night using this marinade.  Really flavorful.  I definitely intend on using the marinade again.

This was really really good!  Followed the recipe for the marinade, and let it sit overnight.  Broiler is on the blink, so baked at 350 for 40 minutes and it was cooked perfectly... really good flavor, but the sauce didn't really caramelize for me since I baked it.  Next time will definitely try this under the broiler like the directions say.  Served with rice and cooked the marinade down as per other reviews.  Will make again.

I  love this recipe.  It has so much flavor.  I grilled it and it even made a nice glaze over the chicken.  One thing that I did that I thought worked well is that I used a 20 oz can of pineapple slices.  The  pineapple juice in the can is the amount needed for the recipe but then you have the slices of pineapple to grill with the chicken. It makes a great side. Thanks Kate for the recipe.  It is wonderful

I was craving teriyaki chicken and found this recipe.  I already had everything for it.  I get it ready the night before we are going to have it for dinner.  It is nice to already have dinner waiting in the fridge.  We grill it on our George Foreman grill along with some pineapple rings.  Then we serve it with rice.  I also strain the leftover marinade and cook it on the stove with a little cornstarch to make a gravy to put over the chicken and the rice.  YUM!!

This recipe is very good. It is not bursting with flavor, however the sauce is great. I usually don't like sweet (pineapple juice) with salt but it came out great. I will do this again. I left it marinating for two days and I cooked it on a skillet. My husband added a bit more terayaki sauce when done and it was very good.

This recipe was great everyone loved it! I did a few things differently was to add fresh chopped garlic, and I added an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple and blended all the ingredients in the food processor. I didn't marinate them at all I just flipped them in the sauce for about a minute then broiled, and I added some marinade when I turned them over. I did add a little salt when it came out of the oven. Next time I will add about a teaspoon of salt to the marinade.
Other than that it was great.

We didn't have pineapple juice on hand so we used Sweet & Sour and splash of Teriyaki Marinade -- but my husband still loved it. He thinks this is as good as 5-star restaurants. We're very young cooks (21 year olds) but this recipe was very easy to make and great. Will definitely be making this one again!!!

Add a little ginger and this recipe is flawless. I have made this so many times I can't all of them. It is absolutely delicious, and the flavor gets stronger the longer you marinade it. It is so delicious!

This wasn't bad.  Probably not my favorite way to eat chicken, but it had a lot of flavor, and it was pretty moist even though I overcooked it.  Next time I'll try using fresh pineapple juice, marinate it for a day, chop up some fresh garlic and put a little grated ginger in.  That should liven it up a little.  My husband and kids liked it.

This was the juiciest, most tender chicken I've ever made!! The flavour was outstanding - just like teriyaki chicken you would get at a restaurant (but better!).  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Excellent!!!  Marinated the chicken around 30 hours and it was delicious!! Also reduced the oil and increased the soy sauce equally. Will definitely be making it time and and time again.  Hubby loved it too!!

I marinated the chicken breasts for a full 24 hours turning every so often. I broiled it and it was tender and juicy! It was one of the best chicken meals I have made. Thanks for Sharing!!!

A precious find. My oldest kid loves his sauces and dips, so he is very picky about what he likes and dislikes...and he absolutely loves this one. There was plenty of marinade left, so we added a little cornstarch and boiled it along with some pressed, spiced tofu squares and carrots for a complete dish. Thank you very much for posting. Will make again and again.

I made this for my parents...it was very good.  Instead of broiling the chicken we put it on the grill...very good.  My mom made the leftover sauce into a gravy but adding flour and heat.  Will make again.

A very good marinade.  Chicken was tender and juicy after 15-20 minutes on a medium-high barbeque.  I had marinated it for 2 1/2 hours.  Will try broiling next winter, and will also try on pork chops.

This is an excellent marinade for grilled chicken!  I used apple juice instead of pineapple because that was what I had.  I also used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce and added about 1 tsp of sesame oil for flavor.  Chicken was very moist and flavorful!  Will definitely make again.

3 out of 3 people said that this recipe was a keeper. I couldn't find pineapple juice at the store so I put a large can of pineapples juice and all into the marinade. 3 hours didn't give as much flavor as I was hoping even poking holes in the chicken so I'd say marinate it overnight.

I also came across pineapple slices in about 4oz of pineapple juice and used that as a marinade blended ingredients and also set aside marinade I made from juice before putting in the chicken; also, I used some 1:1 of Worcestershire to that of soy sauce. Broiled the chicken and used left over sauce.

This recipe says that the chicken will finish cooking in 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side. However, I ended up needing to cook the chicken in 20 minutes. 10 minutes on each side. I guess it depends on the thickness of the chicken breast. I might flatten out the chicken so it spreads more evenly and thus cook more easily next time.

I followed the ingredients exactly. Instead of broiling, I cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes and stir fried it. Then I tossed them on top of rice and veggies. Delicious!

Light and refreshing. I wish the sauce would have gotten into the meat itself some more, but overall it was good. Might make for a good lunch due to the refreshing quality of the meat.

Although I marinated the chicken for much longer than the recipe called for (24 hours total), the flavor did not seem to penetrate the meat. I used chicken breasts and the smaller and thinner pieces tasted better. I would advise using thinly sliced chicken breasts for this recipe. Also due to the consistency and oil ratio, I found that the leftover marinate could not be used as a sauce. I did like that it was very healthy and easy to make.

The marinade was simple yet delicious. It tastes surprisingly similar to teriyaki chicken from a restaurant. However, the chicken did not retain much of the flavor from the marinade. Next time I will make an extra batch of marinade and add thickener and pour over the chicken. Also, broiling for 5 min each side was not nearly enough for me - I ended up broiling the chicken for 12 mins on each side to cook it thoroughly.

I served it with caramelized pineapple slices, broccoli, and white rice.

I made this for my family for dinner last night and even the young ones loved it.!
I marinade the chicken for 6 hours then threw it into a fry pan and made it into a stir-fry with vegetables and noodles!
Absolutely delicious, will be making again and again!

I love this recipe. I like to cut the raw chicken into bite size pieces and marinade for about 8 hrs. I then cook for 2 minutes on my indoor grill, put on a bed of lettuce, and add mandarin oranges, chow mein noodles and Ken's Asian Sesame Dressing with Ginger & Soy. I think this is better than the Asian Salad at Chick-Fil-A! My whole family eats it for a meal, including my 3 young kids.

My husband won't eat most of my cooking, but he LOVES this recipe and asks me to make it a few times a month.  I just leave it to marinate in the refrigerator, and he cooks it up when he wants to make himself an easy meal.

I had no idea how often this recipe would impress people. I made it the first time only because I happened to have my April/May 2014 allrecipies magazine open on the counter when I was making apple cider with pineapple juice - 1st ingredient it called for and no other dinner plans. It was fate!!

substituted OJ for pineapple-as I didn't have any
substituted boneless chicken thighs 
served it when friends came over and they are not fond of thighs and loved this!!Used to buy frozen marinated thighs from a big food warehouse-but these are now in my freezer as they taste just like them and cheaper. thank you...

Wow. This was sooo good! I just finished the leftovers and wanted to say thank you for sharing your amazing recipe. I marinated the chicken on a Sunday night, poking it several times with a fork to make sure it soaked up the marinade. The next day I turned the pieces over a couple of times to keep them evenly coated. Then Monday night I cooked them on my George Foreman grill. Like other reviewers, I used a can of sliced pineapple for the juice, and grilled the pineapple slices too, to serve with the chicken. Served with white rice and steamed broccoli. Just, flavorful and delicious. I cut a few of the pieces in half to make them  thinner so that the insides would get done without drying out. Even cold out of e fridge, the leftovers tasted great. This would be really good over a salad, too.

This was really good and reminded me of restaurant style Teriyaki. The only change I made was I used gluten-free soy sauce. I made extra marinade and thickened it with corn starch on the stove, then served it on the side so people could add as much to the chicken, rice and veggies as they wanted. Without the extra sauce the chicken was good, but didn't have a strong flavor from the sauce (but I only marinaded it for about 3 hours.) One thing I noticed is that the oil was lighter than the rest of the sauce ingredients so it didn't seem to mix well; it kinda hung out at the top. Maybe I can cut back on the oil next time? Will definitely make again, and will try cutting the chicken into smaller pieces and then marinading.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except that I marinated it in a freezer bag and turned it whenever I had to get in the fridge for something. I also marinated it for about 3 1/2 or 4 hours. The longer, the better!

I replaced pineapple juice with orange juice, and it was pretty good that way too. It needs a creamy sauce.

The soy sauce and pinapple juice gave the chicken a flavorful taste. I couldn't help but feel that there was something missing. The second time I made it I added some sake and miren (sweet cooking wine), but I think that maybe it needed some salt or pepper or something. But I will try the recipe again and see what I can do.

This recipe is perfect. I used to work in a steak house and they served the best Teriyaki chicken i have ever eaten. This is the exact same recipe they used. They used to soak the chicken for 48 hours in the marinade turning it every 2 hours to keep the marinade mixed properly. Thanks for the recipe i have been trying to remember it for a long time.

This was really good, i used sesame seed oil instead of the vegetable oil and it has a really nice taste, but a little too strong. Next time i will use less sesame seed oil than called for. I also used the excess marinade as extra sauce to pour over the chicken and that was definitely a good idea. I think without the extra sauce the chicken would have been very bland. All i did to the marinade was drain out any pieces of chicken, added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch and heated it until it boiled. Turned out great!

It was pretty simple but SO flavorful and delish. My boyfriend (though coached to say everything is great) said it was EXQUISITE. I used pineapple/orange juice mix and tweaked it a bit but generally followed the original recipe. Thanks for this memorable dish!

Absolutely delicious! When i first tasted it right after making, I was not so sure. But it turned out wonderful! I used sesame oil and doubled the recipe ( next time, when doubling I will use a bit less oil), used half as a marinade and then boiled the rest with cornstarch to make a dipping sauce for the chicken and tempura veggies. The family loved it, and I even had enough left to bottle for another use. I will definitely be making this again!

I had a friend and her 2 daughters over for dinner and I made this recipe.  It was very easy to make and absolutely delicious! My friends 11 yr old daughter does not eat meat (never has for reasons unknown)loved it!  I do recommend marinated the chicken over night but delicious all the same.  Thanx!!!

Very easy recipe. Pounded the chicken breasts thinner and marinated for a little over two hours. Added some ground ginger. Grilled some pineapple alongside the chicken.

This is the first main dish I have ever created without anyone's help.  It was easy and turned out great!  Cooking time varied from that of the poster, but I guess that's normal =) .  I will definitely cook this again!

This is a good recipe for the grill this summer.  Three of four people I served it to loved it.  The fourth thought it was good but a little too sweet.  I'm wondering if adding a little white vinegar would help?  Also, for a fuller flavor I would recommend marinating the chicken 4 hours instead of 2 (but 2 will definitely work in a pinch).

Delicious!  I marinated chicken in it for 4 hours and it was seasoned throughout.  It has a definate orangey taste when orange juice is used but it is definately a good thing.  I think next time I'll try a little vinegar like others have suggested.

I loved this recipe. I had a Christmas dinner party for all my friends. I am not a great cook, so i was really apprehensive about cooking. I looked and found this recipe. In any case, i marinated it overnight, served it with pinapple, white rice and a tangy italian dressing salad, and it was loved! People said I, ME!!! that i could cook. Anyway, now my family is dying for me to cook for them. And maybe i will, because i enjoyed it myself, being both of a tenderness and flavor that was very agreeable.

This was GREAT - the aroma alone, while it's cooking, is enticing. I grilled the chicken and served it along with long grain rice and grilled pineapple. Yum!

This was very good and very easy. I added a piece of swiss cheese and ate it as a sandwich. I will make this again.

This was very tasty and I cannot wait to make it again. I served it with a thick slice of mozarella cheese on top (nicely melted on the grill). Your guests will love this delicious meal.
