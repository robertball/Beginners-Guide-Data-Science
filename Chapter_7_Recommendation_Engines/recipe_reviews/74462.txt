Very good.  Just be careful to watch the garlic, or it can burn and be bitter.  I had one pita round left, so I halved the recipe and tried it that way.  I liked all the flavors together, but I didn't like how the garlic didn't all stick to the pita.  I think I'll make a garlic paste next time to see if that makes me happier.  Thanks for sharing!

We were very disappointed in this recipe, which I followed EXACTLY. It was edible but the taste was lemon, not garlic.  Sorry for the poor rating but I won't make this again.

I'd made a similar recipe before but never thought of adding the lemon...it really brightens it up. I only cook about 5 mins though.

Mabye a bit lemony. More instruction required on how to get them to fry up without burning chopped garlic. Remember to slowly sprinkle in garlic powder to keep it from bunching up.

I LOVE pita chips!! A more simple version...cut pockets into 2 rounds. Spray both sides of each round with olive oil/sprinkle w/garlic salt & whatever other spices you favor. Cut into wedges & spread out on cookie sheet. Bake at 325 for 10 min-flip them over & bake till golden. GRRREAT with chunky salsa!

Thumbs up. I always have healthy intentions when grocery shopping but find pita is something that usual gets tossed. I used wheat ones and seasoned with Italian mix.  Not a one got thrown away!
