My whole family loved these.  I especially loved the sauce.  I did find that they took a bit longer to bake than the recomended time.  And, because I loved the sauce so much, but hated all of the bacon grease, what I did was cook them with half of the sauce first.  Then, a few minutes before they were done, I transfered them into another pan dabbing off any grease onto a paper towel.  Then I poured the remaining sauce over them in the new pan.  It got rid of them sitting in the grease and the sauce didn't just bake onto the pan, it stayed on the wraps.

Dont forget, the easiest way to bake these delicious treats is on a broiler pan, so that the grease drains off naturally (foil lined, of course)!

NICE combination. This took a little time to wrap but well worth it. I took them to a party and got only 2.  Now I have to make them again so I can get some for myself. Great reviews. I baked them in the oven and then drained them before putting the sauce over them.  I turned the oven off after putting the sauce on and left them sit in the oven another 15 minutes. I only made a half batch of the sauce and it was perfect for the amount of pineapple. After draining the bacon fat off, this is the perfect amount on top of the pineapple. My family loves these and request them often.

Absolutely wonderful.  Used fresh pineapple.  Placed wraps on a broiler pan(as suggested), spooned some sauce on each, baked for about 20-30 min at 375, transferred to another dish (stoneware) poured rest of sauce over and baked another 20 min or so until the sauce was carmelized.  YUM, YUM, YUM.  Never again will a pineapple go bad in my house!

Very, very good, and oh so easy. I was looking for a recipe to use up the last bit f fresh pineapple i had, it worked perfect. Although i would not think that it would turn out as well with canned pineapple, fresh is a must! but great fun snack to go with anything

This is a delicious recipe.  Also for a change, instead of using the brown sugar and mayo sauce, try maple syrup.

My mom made this - sans sauce - when I was a kid and I loved it. I started making it for my ex-boyfriend when I got tired of baking him cookies (he's such a picky eater I couldn't make him actual meals). He was suspicious (and usually hates bacon) but he loves pineapple so was willing to try.

He loved it! Everyone I've made it for since has only tried it to humor me, and then gobbled it down! A great way to inflate a cook's ego! ^.^

Note: I always put either a half-slice of bacon around each chunk, or a whole slice around two or three chunks together.

The flavor is excellent, but I did make some modifications.  First, I cooked the pinapple wrapped with bacon in the oven without the sauce for 30 minutes.   I used 3/4 cup chili sauce to 1/3 cup brown sugar, and left out the mayo.  The bacon made the dish greasy enough.  After thirty minutes cook time, I drained the pineapple wraps on a paper towel.  Because of the grease, I refreshed the foil liner in the baking pan, then returned the pinapple wraps and brushed them with the sauce.  I then broiled them for about 5 minutes to get a little more "crisp" going on.  Hubby was my guinia pig.  He LOVED them.  I also experimented by wrapping whole water chestnuts, and also wrapping shrimp.  Nice contrast to the pinapple, and also adored by my guinia pig.  I do have to say that these are a little time consuming to make, but can be made ahead, then reheated before serving.   I plan to serve all three at my daughter's engagment party.   Great base of a recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

This was good, but maybe not my personal preference. I prefer bacon wrapped water chestnuts. But those at the BBQ raved about them and said they were their favorite thing wrapped in bacon! I marinated the pineapple in the sauce and then wrapped the chunks in bacon that had been partially cooked in the microwave. Then I served the remaining sauce for dipping. The dipping sauce really made it good.

I took these to a potluck.  They disappered rather quickly.  I cooked these on a cooling rack placed on a cookie sheet.  I baked them longer than was called for.  Delicious!

Baked bacon and pineapple w/o sauce just because I need to serve later.  I put the sauce on the bottom of crock pot then put the bacon/pineapple on top---worked great(the sauce is awesome!!!!) thanks for a fun recipe--you can never have too much bacon!

These were awesome!  Made them for a tropical themed party--they were just perfect!  The only thing is they were a little too spicy for me--I used chinese chili sauce so I think that may be spicier than regular chili sauce.  I love spicy food but I may have to cut back on the chili sauce next time.  But such flavor!  I will definitely make these again!

These were awesome!  Definitely a big hit at our small group get-together tonight - this platter was the first one emptied!  I would suggest halving the sauce - it made way more than I needed.  And definitely use a broiler pan (lined with foil) to bake - I actually broiled mine for 2 minutes after the timer went off to make sure the bacon got a little crispy.  Perfect!!

These are yummy! Be sure to use a broiler pan though....otherwise they're swimming in bacon grease.

I was skeptical of how many super-positive reviews there were - the ingredients seemed a bit too simple to yield such impressive results. I was wrong! People raved about how juicy, flavorful, and "addictive" these were. We even had a dedicated vegetarian guest try them (and then eat 7 more afterwards!!!). 
They're not overly pretty, but they taste fancy. The only thing I did differently was that I made the sauce and marinated the pineapple and bacon in it for a couple hours, then pulled them out, skewered them, and cooked them on a baking sheet. I didn't like the idea of them simmering in the greasy sauce - and they still turned out juicy and delicious!

Excellent! They went fast at my party and everyone loved them. I did use the suggestion of baking them on a broiler pan or on a wire grate with a baking pan under. After 25 min. I transfered them to a corningware dish, poured 1/2 the sauce and cooked another 5 min. I used the other 1/2 of the sauce as a dip. I highly recommend this dish!

I haven't tried these yet, but I think I would love to take these to a Luau we're having in August.  I also think I'll partially pre-cook the bacon and drain to prevent some of the grease.  They do sound delish!

YUM. I had originally planned to make this with water chestnuts but bought the wrong kind so I pulled this recipe up and am so glad I did.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Delicious.

Made for New Years day potluck.  The bacon I used was poor quality and rather fatty so when cooked it fell apart on the pineapple.  This is no fault of the recipe and reviews I got were great.  Next time, cut bacon larger to wrap around pineapple 1.5 times and make sure bacon is meatier.  Easy to prepare recipe and will make again.

Absolutely excellent.  I'm not sure quite how long they cooked for, but about 30 min + I broiled them at the end for about 3 min.  They turned out great and were gone almost as quickly as I put them out.

Good dish for a beach theme party.  Next time, I would not use the mayo, but add a hoisin and honey sauce.  Dont forget to use a broiler pan to drain off the grease.

These were ok.  I made them for a fight night party with about a dozen guys and figured they would get gobbled right up.  Most people only ate one or two and left the rest on their plates.  It just seemed like the bacon didn't get very crispy, even though I baked it for extra time after the edges were crispy.  The flavors were good so I will try again maybe broiling instead of baking to get the crispiness.

This was a hit!  I baked it on a broiler pan to keep the grease off the pineapples - and I baked it until I thought the bacon looked perfect.  That took an extra 10 minutes, so keep that in mind.  It all depends on the type of bacon you use.  I plan on making this again - and again and again.  Yum!

These were okay but didn't get rave reviews at my Easter table.  I had issues with the sauce burning before the bacon was crisp.  I couldn't really taste much of the chili sauce in those areas where it wasn't burnt.  I may try tweaking it to resolve those issues as I think this is a great idea. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are amazing! Everyone loved them and they went fast. I made everything ahead of time and the sauce thickened up but I think it was great since the sauce covered each piece very well.

My family really liked these.  As per another reviewers suggestion I think cooking on a broiler pan would be great as they were sitting in alot of grease.  Sauce was great...just the right amount of kick.

This recipe was so good, and I cannot wait to make it again. I made two small changes, I used pineapple rings and cut them into fours so the chunks were a little bigger, and I used applewood smoked bacon because it is a little sweeter then traditional bacon, and I think it completed the recipe well. Thank you for the great recipe! Will make this again, for sure!

I tried the recipe using fresh pineapple as it grows locally and the bacon and the pineapple flavours just don't go together.

I made this last week for a holiday lunch at work. I wrapped the pineapple chunks with bacon, secured them with a toothpick and put them on a broiler pan. I cooked them for 30 minutes at 375º. Then I made the sauce using another's comments of 3/4 cup chili sauce to 1/3 cup brown sugar, and skipped the mayo altogether. I also added some cinnamon to the mix. Pulled the pan out and brushed on the sauce. Then back in for about 20 minutes more. Then pulled out and let cool.

Took them to work - all 20 or so (I had to taste a couple!). I was worried that folks might pass them by. Ha! They lasted all of 10 minutes; gone in a flash. 

I would definitely make them again, but here's my lessons learned. Instead of cutting the bacon strips in thirds, I'd cut them in half. This would give more bacon to wrap around and overlap. With the thirds, sometimes the ends barely met. Also, I opted to go with the applewood smoked bacon and that made it even tastier. I saw another's comment about getting sliced pineapple in a can and then cutting it into quarters for larger chunks. I might try that. The chunks from the can worked fine, but sometimes they can be small. When I pulled them out to put the sauce on, there were some that were stuck to the pan, so I might try PAM or moving them to another pan or dish for the final cooking stage. And aluminum foil in the broiler pan made cleanup so easy. At the end, I used a spatula to get them off the pan after they cooled. Next time, I would do that while

So easy and so good. I've made these for two parties now and everybody has loved them. After baking, I toss them in a slow cooker under the "warm" setting, but they never really last long. :)

I wrapped these the night before and the bacon seemed to disappear.  I don’t know if the acid in the pineapple disintegrated the bacon fat or what, but a word to the wise - don’t wrap a day ahead!!  I’m sure with the bacon intact these would taste totally different but with only a little bacon left on these the pineapple with the sauce was not a tasty treat.

This did not work for me. I tried to use fresh pineapple, maybe that was a mistake.  The bacon fell off the pineapple during cooking and there was a ton of juice in the bottom of the pan making everything soft and mushy. The bacon just broke apart and slid off the fruit.
