I got the thumbs up from mis7up to make small changes to make it a little lighter. I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream in place of the mayo (I'm low on mayonnaise until we go shopping again) and my own homemade taco seasoning. My husband and I really liked this--the kids were kind of lukewarm about it. For them it was a little too hot. My husband ate most of this himself. I think next time I'll throw the ingredients for this (minus the parsley) in the oven or my little crockpot and try it as a warm dip. I think it would be great that way, too. This was a great way to make a quick "dip" for the boys on the weekend and use up the last bit of cream cheese I bought cheap around Christmas and a half-full jar of pickled jalapeno rings. Thanks for another winner, mis7up!

Very tasty and perfectly spicy. Super easy to whip together. I used cilantro instead of parsley on the outside of the ball.

This is a firecracker of a cheese ball appetizer. With blends of mexican cheeses, taco seasonings and pickled jalapenos, the taste is creamy smooth and fire hot....My husband will eat it all gone. What makes this a great app is the fact I make my pickled jalapenos fresh and not use store bought canned.

I dont know if I did something wrong, but this came out really gritty. I used low fat cheese and a food processor. Maybe that had something to do with it.

I found this recipe wayyyy too salty.  Maybe it was the seasoning mix I used.  I used the Old El Paso mix. Boo.

Very good flavor and super easy to make.  However, after rolling one into a ball and in the parsley, I decided to just put it all in a dish and use a cheese spreader to serve.  Not as pretty, but I didn't like the idea of all that dried parsley.

Very good cheese ball. I rolled mine in cilantro to give it even more Mexican flavor. It was just a little salty for my taste.

This recipe definitely has come kick. I really liked it. It's different then the more smooth cheese balls I'm use to. It was an awesome change to the norm!

I have made this now 3 times for 3 separate parties and guests....A+++++! This has been a hit every time! I will say that I did alter the spice packet to a standard Taco Seasoning instead of the extra spicy. I highly recommend this recipe.

We loved this at Christmas!  I think when served with salty tortilla chips this cheese ball does seem salty.  We chose low salt crackers and it was really perfect.  We also did not use all that dried parsley.  We toasted sliced almonds and coated it with those.  Guests raved about it!

I followed recipe exactly. It was too salty for my taste. Maybe less taco seasoning?
