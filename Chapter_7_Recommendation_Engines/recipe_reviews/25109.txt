This is a similar recipe to the one my family has been making for years. Our recipe calls for three cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar and an added tsp of almond extract. Other wise the rest of the ingredients are exactly the same. What we've always done is this, we bake it in a jelly roll pan, which is about 10.5 by 15.5 inches, a little larger than a 9x13 pan. Also we don't even try to cover the top of the cherrie pie filling completely, but spread the remaining batter around in a sort of blotchy, swirly pattern so that some cherries are covered and some aren't.  The batter spreads even more as the bars bake. Bake at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes. Then we sprinkle on powdered sugar after the cake has cooled. Makes a very pretty and tasty cake dessert.

These are delicious, but I agree that 40 minute cook time isn't enough in a 9 x 13 pan, and that they are a little too "cake-like" for my taste.  After discovering that, I made it again, only  in the cookie sheet I normally use for bars.  Way better, not mushy after 40 minutes, and definately a BAR.  The topping doesn't cover well at all however, next time I may increase the recipe just a little to have more for the top.  I also sprinkled powdered sugar over the top after baking, it looked amazing, all white and red, perfect for the holidays!  Yummy!

Thank God somebody else knows the recipe for this.  My mother used to make these all the time when I was little but lost the recipe.  I now have a family of my own at the age of 24 and I like the convenience of this treat.  I do remember, as a rule of thumb, my mother putting a toothpick in the middle to make sure her bars were done (as we do with everything else).  I know it takes longer and I'll be doing the same thing.  Easy recipe!

I made this Christmas Eve as a last-minute extra for the dessert table. I used three egg yolks I had left over from another recipe as a replacement for one egg, and had to add a little milk to compensate for Arizona dryness. (The flour dries out horribly here). I think it's going to taste good, what with a cup of butter, vanilla, and lots of eggs. A can of pie filling was PLENTY. It took about an hour to cook. I think it should be re-named, as it is a cake. I love that this is a no-chocolate, non-cheesecake cherry idea. I may try reducing the sugar next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy to make! Baked for 50 min and it was perfect! Next time I will try it with whole wheat flour and Splenda.

Great recipe, and I agree with previous review of using 3 c. flour, and the almond extract - 1/2 to 1 tsp.  I also used 2 cans of cherry pie filling (premium if you can find it, since it has more cherries).  The glaze that I use is 1/2 c. powered sugar, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp almond extract, and 1 Tbsp. milk - then drizzle over the top.  This recipe is also great with ice cream.  Good stuff!

This is a very good recipe. More like a cake than a bar. Takes a little longer to cook than 40 minutes. Top is not enough to cover cherries but I swirled it in with the cherries and it was great.

I needed a dessert in a hurry for a school function using items in the cupboard and this fit the bill. As suggested before, I used an 11x15 jellyroll pan so that it was more bar-like.  It worked fine; however, one can of cherry pie filling was a stretch although two cans would be too much. The taste is a subtly sweet cherry bar/cake.  The kids liked it.  I would suggest sprinkling about 1 tbsp of sugar over the bars just prior to baking. Also, I wonder how almond extract would taste in place of the vanilla.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it. The batter has a wonderful flavor so I sometimes use it in other recipes. To avoid mushy middle, use an 8 x 8 pan and use the surplus to make pretty mini-cupcakes with one cherry pushed down into each. Another tip I have is to  spread plastic wrap sprayed with cooking oil over your first layer of batter to spread it evenly. just slide your fingers over the wrap to move the batter around. You can reuse the  same piece of wrap to even out  your cherries or top layer of batter.

This is a quick & easy recipe.  If you have pie filling on hand, you are good to go.  As some in our family are not chocolate lovers, this cherry bars is great.

I don't know about these Cherry Bars. I cooked them for 45 min. and they were still mushy in the middle. The parts that weren't mushy tasted really good though. Next time I'll try cooking them a little longer.

The batter for these bars is thick so "spreading" the top layer over the cherries was almost challenging for me. They came out pretty I thought. The texture is more like a coffee cake than bars in my opinion so for me this begs for a buckle type topping with toasted almonds for a bit of crunch. I am not a big fan of canned cherries but certainly could have used another fruit pie filling. These were ok.

Very similar to a recipe I have used often. That recipe also called for the 3 cups of flour and only 1 cup sugar,plus 1 tsp almond extract. We make with cherry & blueberry pie filling together. Bake in a 10.5 x15.5  bar pan. I have used glaze or the powdered sugar. this is a big hit at anytime of the year!

I've made this same recipe since I was a kid. I used to make it weekly for Sunday morning coffee at church for my mom to take. It was always a hit!  Tweak the recipe a little by putting 2/3rds the batter on the bottom of a jelly roll pan, not 9x13. Then smear on the cherry pie filling. With the rest of the batter drop random spoonfuls all over the top of the pie filling. Do not spread out. As it bakes it will spread leaving beautiful sections of cherry peaking out. When cooked drizzle with a powdered sugar glaze. So yummy!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for, same taste as my mother used to make.  They turn out beautiful when you really swirl the top batter with the fruit filling.  Also awesome with lemon pie filling!

1c sugar and 3c flour with a little almond extract. It was good but super cakey in a 9x13 pan. Next time I will follow other suggestions and use a jelly roll pan and double the pie feeling. I made it with half the pan cherry and the other half blueberry. It was good, but will be perfect with the suggested changes.

I made two changes:  added 1 tsp almond extract and sprinkled half a cup of thinly sliced almonds on the top. I think the almonds really enhanced the texture. My very picky teenager loved this.

This recipe didn't come out well for me, I had to bake it extra long, nearly an hour, and then it got gooey and soggy in the bottom quicker so half of it had to be thrown away. I am chalking it up to user-error and no fault to the recipe at all!

This was really good. I was using a 10x15" jelly roll pan so I increased the recipe by half.  After reading the reviews, I decided to double the filling by combining a can of pie filling with a 28oz jar of sour cherries. Doing so reduced some of the overall sugar content.  Was perfect.  Lovely crisp top, delicious centre.  24 servings from a 9x13" dish is pretty small servings.   Out of my pan, I got 24 good-sized servings, could have stretch it to 28. I'll make this one again.  Good for dessert, snack or brunch.

Just like my Mom's Cherry Squares.  My mom added on can of sour cherries, drained, to the cherry pie filling.  Yum

I cute this recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  And while it is much more like a cake than a bar it was good.

This was not a bar at all.  it was more like a cake. with cherry filling in the middle.
