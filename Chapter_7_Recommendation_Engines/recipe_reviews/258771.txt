I have to admit one reason I tried this recipe is because no one had reviewed it. I really enjoyed this broccoli cauliflower salad. I cut back on the sugar and bacon but still it was very delicious. Since I did not say what kind of vinegar to use our used white wine vinegar.

I didn’t have bacon but it tasted great without. Used red onion and only a couple tablespoons of mayo.
