This was a great take on the regular Chex Mix.  I have small kids so I used half the amount of tobasco that the recipe called for. I also sprinkled garlic powder over the mixture before baking and added a little more nuts, cheez-its and pretzels. Everyone loved it and I had two requests for the recipe which is always a great sign!

Definitely needs more spice.  Add much more tabasco and use Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning.

this is a good basic recipe but I thought wasn't near spicy enough.  I sprinkled extra red pepper and some more seasoned salt (I used Tony's so it's a little spicy also) and then it was perfect.  I also added wasabi peas which were a big hit!

This is good but where is hot and spicy? I used 3 tsp of hot sauce, but it was not spicy at all and I hate spicy meals. You need to add a lot more hot sauce or you might as well make the original party mix rec.

Tasted nothing like the "real thing" I trashed the whole batch, don't waste your money on ingredients because this is pretty expensive to throw away.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I would add a little more tobasco sauce.  I like it a little hotter!! It was good!
