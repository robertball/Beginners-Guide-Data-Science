I cheated and used store bought gnocchi. But other than that, I followed the recipe and my sauce was more of a soup. I added 1-2 tbsp of flour to thicken it up. It tasted nice and I would definitely make this again, but with alterations.

I tried really hard on this.  I made the gnocchi exactly as the recipe says, but it didn't stay together at all when I boiled it. I added some heavy cream and cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. The sauce was really good.  Maybe I did something wrong with the gnocchi, but I don't know what.

Well, I spent thirteen dollars on three large morel mushrooms so I wanted to do something special with them.  The gnocchi turned out good.  I didn't bring the water to a rolling boil because I knew that would break them apart.  They were much like dumplings.  As soon as they rose to the surface (about three minutes) I put them in the ice water to cool.  I was not happy with the sauce.  It was just to flabby.  It needed some creaminess so I added a bit of butter, but it just needed some cream and maybe a dash of nutmeg.  I will try that next time.  Other than the flabby sauce, the dish had possibilities.
