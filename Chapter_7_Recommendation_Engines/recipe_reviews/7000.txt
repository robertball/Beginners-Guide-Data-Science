Oh Yay!  I've never made any kind of bread from scratch before, and I was really nervous about this one.  I was simply ASTOUNDED by how easy it really was.  Particularly rolling out the dough.  And it rose so beautifully.  I feel so accomplished and they taste wonderful! LATER NOTE: After making these several times, I accidentally discovered that letting the rolls sit an extra hour before putting them in the oven actually makes them significantly better. LATER LATER NOTE: I wanted a wheat roll one evening, so I substituted half the white flour for whole wheat flour, and the results were still excellent.

These rolls are wonderful. I had to bake them at 325 degrees because the 400 degrees that the recipe calls for burned them at the bottom while failing to cook the top. Like other readers, I had to extend each rise for about an hour. I also substituted butter for the shortening (because of the health risks associated with shortening), and they still tasted great. I served them hot with honey butter, and they were a big hit! These are more dense than a croissant, but less dense than, say, a yeast roll. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was made for a group of 120 in a commercial kitchen.  We substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour it calls for.  The rolls turned out wonderful!  Very delicious and easy to make.

WOO HOO.. I did it with the help from my fellow foodies support.  These were wonderful.  I divided the recipe as there is only two of us.  I made crescents for dinner.  Then I made Cinnamon Rolls for dessert.  I put butter, cinnamon, brown sugar on the dough after rolling out.  Rolled that up and sliced, put in round pan to raise.  When they came out I topped with cream cheese frosting II from this site.  I had some in the fridge, it keeps very well.  It melted over these very nicely.  Thanks so much!!

These are great!! Not a croissant, but much lighter than an average roll. I've made them 4 times now, and they're fairly "fool-proof", as I've made mistakes (letting them sit too long) and they still turn out fine. 

Highly recommended, dough works great in a bread machine.

I have tried many roll recipes on this site and others and this is without a doubt my favorite. My 5-year old rated it as such "5 fingers plus one thumb on the other hand so it gets 6 stars!" :) It was incredibly easy to make. I used my bread machine and set it to the dough cycle. I used a pizza cutter to cut the wedges and placed the rolls on parchment-lined  cookie sheets. IMPORTANT NOTE: I have to believe this baking temp of 400 is incorrect. I took the advice of other reviewers and lowered my temp to 350. My rolls were perfectly golden brown in exactly 9 minutes. I brushed the tops with melted butter as suggested and these are absolutely heavenly. I'm not even sure if I'll ever bother with another roll recipe after this. They're so pretty and so tasty, unbelievable. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it is without a doubt a keeper. I've already printed it out and put it in my 3-ring binder...only the best recipes go in there! :)

This recipe completely impressed my inlaws (which is not easily done). My MIL is an extremely good cook and she even gave me compliments! I used half the recipe and made crescent rolls and with the other half of the dough I made cinnamon rolls for dessert. You can do both with this recipe!!!! Thanks for this diamond that will be a staple in our family!!

These rolls were VERY good and VERY easy to make! I brushed a little egg white on top of each roll which added a nice browness. They were a hit at my family Christmas party. I will bake them over and over! A+

They're good rolls, but they don't taste like croissants- they're like normal rolls and not flakey.  They look nice though.

These are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  My husband thought for SURE they were the brand name crescent rolls you pop out of a can!  For the reviewer that said they don't taste anything like croissants, that's because there is a difference between croissants and crescent rolls.  This is not a recipe for croissants.  Enjoy!  Dough will not appear to have risen at all during each rising but they turn out perfectly!

I think this is the first recipe I have rated all five stars.  It is AMAZING!  I piled all the ingredients into my bread machine to make the dough and it couldn't have been easier.  The dough came out big, fluffy and silky smooth.  I used it in place of Pillsbury crescent roll sheets, which my local store does not carry, in order to make pinwheel appetizers (pepperoni/provolone and mozzarella/fresh basil/sun dried tomato) for a party (this recipe makes enough to replace four cans of crescent dough).  Boy, were they a hit!  They were the first tidbits to completely disappear from the table.  I got many compliments and several people told me it was the bread that really made them special.  I totally agree, it is far better than the store bought stuff.  I will be using this recipe over and over.

Wonderful rolls!  I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I shaped half of the dough into the crescent rolls and the other half I rolled out, coated with softened butter, then sprinkled liberally with a brown sugar, cinnamon and chopped walnuts mixture.  I rolled them up long ways and cut into 9 cinnamon rolls.  I put the rolls into an 8x8 glass pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and covered them with plastic wrap.  I put them in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I took them out and let them come to room temperature, rise a while then baked them in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  They were heavenly!

This was so simple. If you have a bread maker use the dough/pizza dough setting. I just dumped all 4 cups of flour, sugar, salt, softened butter, eggs and shortening into the bread machine bowl, mixed the water and yeast and poured on top of all other ingredients and hit start. 1 hr and 40 min later I had dough. I took it out, halted the dough and rolled into 12in circle. Cut with pizza cutter, brushed with butter and added a little turkey smoke sausage. Rolled them up and baked. No additional rising time or anything. 12 min in 325degree oven and they were perfect. Was making them for breakfast for the week and kids all walked into the kitchen at 11pm to see what that "really good" smell was. Best and easiest recipe for dough. Can't wait to try it as cinnamon rolls and just plain rolls. Gonna be a family favorite for years. :)

This is very similar to ur family recipe. Only diff is that we use butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup each of milk and water (for proofing). We bake at a lower temp too cuz the rolls get a little Oklahoma brown if you bake too hot.

I was dubious at first because that is a LOT of yeast in a little bit of water, but I committed myself not to change things (this time!)  The recipe didn't say how long to knead, so I chose around 8 minutes in the kitchenaid mixer. I punched down twice and then rolled them. I rolled them out on wax paper which not only kept my counter clean, but ended up using a lot less flour (I just added a bit to the rolling pin).  These were light and just a bit sweet.  (I ate 3 when they came out of the oven!!)  This made up the bulk of what I ate on Thanksgiving!  Delicious, a keeper and super easy.  Even a beginnner can make magic with this recipe.  Mmmmm, maybe I ought to start another batch.  I bet they'd freeze really well.

I was concerned when this dough more resembled cookie dough than bread dough, and then again when it didn't rise during the first hour. I went ahead and rolled it out (by the way this rolled out BEaUTIFULLY!!) and formed it into crescents. I preheated the oven to 150, shut it off once it was heated, and let them rise in there. That worked well and they rose great! I omitted the butter before rolling and didn't miss it. I also found that 3 cups of flour total was plenty enough for this dough. These turned out very delicious! They far exceeded my expectations!!

Yum yum, I halved the recipe and it made 12 crescents that looked like they were on steroids!  I did make them in my bread machine but I proofed the yeast with the water and 1 T of the sugar before putting in the BM.  Soft, fluffy, and so tasty after just 12 minutes in the oven.  Be sure to place the points down on the baking sheet as they will separate from the roll and look funky.  Still tastes good though :)  I didn't grease my baking sheet before and they browned quite nicely and didn't stick at all.

Sooooo good! I love these with honey butter. I like to rewarm them by covering with a damp paper towel  and putting them in a 275 oven until the towel is dry, it help them to have that fresh from the oven taste and texture again.

These taste really good, but they don't rise very well for me.  I've tried three times and just not that impressed.  Maybe the salt ratio is off or something?  Anyway, think I'll keep looking....

Great, with a light texture, and slightly sweet taste.  I adjusted the recipe only to start the dough in a bread maker.  And I did have to let it rise (after cutting and shaping the rolls) two hours to reach the desired size and fluffiness.  Can't wait to serve them with Thanksgiving dinner!  I always make my rolls ahead of time, freeze them, thaw the day before on the counter, and reheat in the over just before serving.  Saves SO much hassle!

Fantastic dough!  I did modify it to use rapid rise yeast everytime I've made it.  I really like it with a little oatmeal to replace some of the flour and half of the sugar replaced with honey.  Can we say honey oat crescent rolls!!!

Be warned: this is a very rich dough recipe for rolls, not for anybody on a diet. I only used a small amount of butter to coat dough before rolling and skipped brushing them with melted butter. As is, this recipe calls for over 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar - this is verging on doughnut territory. Be warned!  That being said, it's good. They will get stale quickly, put leftovers in freezer so they are fresh for the next time you want them.  I only gave 4 stars as I think sugar could be cut back, they are noticeably sweet and may not go well with some dinners. Also, and more importantly, at 400, they burnt on the bottom (even on the middle rack of oven) after 5 minutes. Bake them at 350, I think you will be happier with the results.

VERY GOOD!! Although the name implies that these are just like crescents, the submitter warns you that they are more dense. So you must expect that before starting this recipe. I halved the recipe and they turned out excellent. I let them rise (both times) longer than the recipe states but the result was soo tasty and went well with dinner. Served with "Cinnamon Honey Butter" (from this site) and they were great!! Would make these again! Thanks Mike!!

I read through several reviews and didn't see this point covered... It's a tasty recipe, but rolling them out to 12 inch circles left my cresent rolls thick - more "roll-like" than the typical cresent consistancy. Next time I'll make them, I think I'll split the dough into 4 balls and roll each of those out to 12 to make them flakier.

While home for the holidays, the family requested I make crescent rolls for Christmas dinner, which I had not made before.  This recipe was incredibly easy and tasty.  I made 30 rolls for 5 people; none of the rolls actually lasted to dinner.  Fresh out of the oven, brushed with butter they were amazing.  Technique notes: I made the dough the night before and let it rise overnight.  I then proceeded and let the rolls rise for 2-3 hours (this can even be longer as I discovered with a batch of cinnamon rolls I made from this base recipe as well).  My step mom's oven must run pretty hot; on 350 F, 10 minutes nearly burned them (caught them in the nick of time).  Keep a close eye on your first batch and I agree with shooting low with the temperature.   Makes a nice not too sweet cinnamon roll dough too; I'll add some lemon zest to it next time for dessert applications.

Very good, not like the ones in the can at the store....soft, chewy, and delicious! I accidentally ended up letting mine rise for almost 2 hours, and they were HUGE! I made garlic butter and spread it on before rolling up. These were very thick as well, I will try for 3 12-inch circles next time. These went VERY quickly!! Certainly will be making again!!

These were marvelous!  I made a few minor changes, I used half the sugar, and I only put in 3 1/2 cups of flour in the dough.    My husband really loved them, he ate three later after dinner as snacks!  They are yummy and tender even the next day.  I sliced them in half the morning after and put ham inside for a wonderful breakfast sandwich.   I'm going to make them for the holidays now.

We loved this!  They were soft, buttery rolls, and my husband really enjoyed them with strawberry jam.  The only changes I made were to sub 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat & mix the dough in my bread machine.

I never actually made this into rolls.  When I make this, I just use the dough for other things after it has raised the first time.  I have used it as the crust for a breakfast pizza and as the "pie crust" for a tomato pie (recipe found on this site).  It is soooo good!  If you want to use the dough as a pizza or pie crust however, make only half of the recipe.

I used this recipe in my bread machine on "dough" setting, changing the order of ingredients to match the  manufacturer's directions.  Even though I was 40 minutes late getting home to take the dough out, roll it, shape it and do the second rising, the rolls came out superb!

Awesome! I made half of them into crescent rolls and the other half into mini cinnamon rolls. Both are delicious right out of the oven.

Wow! The taste and texture of this dough is amazing! Of course, instead of following the recipe perfectly I changed it a bit. I used 3 and 1/2 cups of white whole wheat flour (with added vital wheat gluten - 1 Tablespoon for each cup) and then half a cup of ground flax seed. I used my bread maker to mix the dough, then let them rise and baked in the oven. Wow! These are soooo yummy! I'm making these again!

This is a good dinner roll -- light and fluffy, but NOT a croissant!  I brushed egg on the rolls before putting them in the oven -- for a more golden color.   I used canola oil for the shortening.

I am looking for a good recipe for some kind of homemade roll to make for Thanksgiving this year and I think this may be it.  I made half a batch for my husband and I today to try them out.  They turned out quite good, although next time I think I will make the following modifications:  A bit less flour since they are quite dense and a bit less sugar since they turned out sweeter than what I was expecting.  I may also layer the dough with butter as I roll it out, to try and make it slightly more flakey.  I baked these for 12 minutes at 350 degrees and they turned out perfectly golden brown.  I think 400 would be too hot.  EDIT:  I had to reduce my rating of these from 4 stars down to 3, as after they cooled for a few hours, they became like bricks and took on a very yeasty flavor.  My husband still loves them, though.  They are good right out of the oven and would probably be okay if you re-heat them in a warm oven or in the microwave.  Not very good cold, though.

While not said in directions, use your pizza cutter to cut your rolls

A tip from my mother in law years ago on this type roll.. keep this dough really soft, don't add in too much flour when kneeding the dough.  I often divide this receipe and make mini crecents.. Big kid and adult favorite over and over again

Very good.  I agree with another reviewer that says that it needs more time to rise.  Also, I did brush it with egg whites in order to make it more flaky.  These taste much better than store bought.  These went so quick that I almost didn't get to grab one.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent! I had only one pkg of yeast so I dissolved it in 2 tablespoons of warm water 110 degrees with a tablespoon of sugar. I let that sit until it was foamy on top.  Added that into bread machine before mixing.  Also, in lieu of shortening, used 1 stick of butter softened and sliced and replaced the water with warm milk.  To cut calories, I did not spread the dough with butter before shaping rolls.  They still turned out rich and buttery and rose beautifully! Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

came out really well. once you make once, very versatile to add jalepanio, cheese, or anything. These are crescent rolls, not croissant rolls. Croissant rolls are folded with butter in between each layer many times, which causes the flakeyness, crescent rolls are not.

A similar recipe has been made in my family for over 50 years! 
We use 1 cup scalded whole milk, a stick of butter, 3 eggs, and 41/2 C flour.The milk just makes a richer bread. I also divide the dough into thirds, and get 36 rolls.
My kiddos love these with an orange glaze- mix OJ concentrate (never drinkable OJ) with powdered sugar- voila! Nice breakfast treat, or serve plain for dinner. Soo good, and pretty easy and foolproof, even for the beginner.

These were fantastic! Like most other reviewers I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the shortening. I also left out the additional 1/4 cup of butter at the end because I figured 1/2 cup was plenty. The dough was very easy to work with, and they turned out so delicious!!

OHHH YEAH! These are GREAT!! Very easy to make and always a big hit. I took others advise and let rise another hour (the bigger the better). I found that the more you knead the dough, the fluffier they are. I also used butter flavored shortening. They turned out wonderful. Next time I think I will just use butter as one view suggested. Serving suggestion: These would be fun to make with "Little Smokies" sausages for the Super Bowl. I have yet to try it, but they would be good. Just be sure to cut your cooking temp.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving.  On one batch I sprinkled some parmesan cheese before I rolled them up... DELICIOUS!!!  I will definitely be keeping these around!

Made these rolls for our chicken packets. I've always bought the crescent rolls for this dish, but decided to try my hand at homemade rolls this time. They were so good!! These rolls are so easy to make. I'll certainly make again! Thanks for sharing.

Used this recipe in my bread maker turned wonderfully! I only had one envelope of yeast and they still made HUGE crescents!  I made them in to garlic herb crescents by adding some oregano basil and one crushed clove garlic to the mix. Then made a mix of 4 cloves garlic, oregano, basil and parsley to 1/4 cup melted butter and brushed on top before putting them in the oven. They were a big hit at the potluck.

Excellent rolls...the key is letting them rise for a lot more  time before and after you roll them out!!! I turn my oven down too.

These are great tasting and easy, my only problem is that I had to lower the oven temperature or the bottoms were burnt.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm not sure why, but my dough never raised.  I make homemade breads all the time and do not have this problem, but this dough was rather dense.  It did not raise in the bowl (1 1/2 hours), in crescent form (1 hour) and hardly raised in the oven as well.  The taste was good.

These were a great change from regular buns. Made dough in KA, next time I will add flour slowly, could get by with 1/2 cup less.

The rolls I made did not turn out at all.  (This could be due to the fact that I have never baked rolls before.) If I could I would give it zero stars.

This is my go to recipe when company shows up: very quick and easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I use about 1/4 cup sugar in this dough and roll a cocktail hot dog into each crescent, and bake at 350 for about 25 minutes, my five year old LOVES them, so thanks for a great easy recipe!

I was so excited to find this recipe!  These rolls have been a Thanksgiving tradition for as long as I can remember, in fact they are right up there with the turkey for must-haves!  They are so easy, you don't even have to knead them!  They are NOT croissants, they won't be flaky, but are just a wonderful, special dinner roll.

This recipes is such a quick and easy recipe for a light, buttery melt-in-your mouth roll.  My family just loves these rolls.  If get an early afternoon I can put together a batch for dinner, and they also heat up really nicely.  I have also used the dough to make great cinnamon rolls - you roll the dough out as directed and then spread with cinnamon, sugar, and raisins.  You can then either cut into wedges and make cinnamon crescent rolls or roll the whole sheet, slice, and bake in a pan or on a sheet.  If you bake it in a pan, you may have to adjust baking time and/or temp.  I find that the cinnamon rolls in the pan do better with an occasional spritz of water, or with a pan of water on the bottom rack, since they seem to need longer in the oven to bake.

These are awsome!!!!! I let mine raise for 7 hours and they turned out to be very fluffy.  My family loved them.  When they were hot we sliced them open and put scrambled eggs, ham, and chees in them.

These are easy to make and have great flavor but they need much more time to raise.  They turned out pretty dense.  Also I would brush them w/ a beaten egg before baking to attain a golden/brown color.

Very close to an old "dinner roll" recipe from the 40's...a little richer, sweeter and with water vs. milk.  Results were quite good.  The ppl who said they needed to cook at a lower temp might want to have their ovens' thermostats checked for accuracy...mine is spot on and 400 degrees was perfect.  Same w/the ppl regarding rise times:  they might want to make sure they are letting their dough rise in a warm enough spot.  Rise time was spot on as well.

This is very good!  I did not make it into crescent rolls; instead I used it to make a sopapilla cheesecake.  It worked perfectly for that purpose- a lovely crust!  I will be trying these out as rolls soon :)

Wow.  This was the first time I've had rolls turn out light & fluffy.  Hooray for that!  
Otherwise, the recipe was a little sweet for me, which kind of overpowered the butteriness of the roll.  I'll cut back on the sugar next time.  Otherwise, 4 stars for the perfect texture!

Fantastic! Just a tip. Put the dough in the oven to rise after turning it on for one minute, just to warm up the air inside. It makes the dough raise much faster.

The rolls were moist and had a nice crunch on the outside. I would make this again, maybe even do crescent dogs.

I LOVEEEEEE this recipe, made it last night for my birthday and everyone was amazed! The roll was very soft, much softer than a dinner roll. I left mine to rise for about an hour and a half, and I got way more than 20 and they were huge! I also baked mine at a lower temperature of 360, therefore it didn't get too dark at the bottom.
What I would say is if you don't like sweet bread,you should either put less sugar or a little more salt. Love this recipe!

These were pretty tasty.  I made the first batch from scratch and they came out very dense (but that could be because my boyfriend got nosy during the rise process).  I took the advice from other viewers and lowered the oven temp.
 I ended up making a second slightly modified 1/2 batch in my bread machine to use for a pot pie crust and came out pretty good!  I'm going to try another batch of the crescent rolls next weekend :)

Oh my gosh these are the best rolls ever !!! I was a little worried at first because the dough was a little dense, thought it was too much yeast, but they turned out terrific. Way better than store bought crescents !!!

These crescent rolls are so very good.  I would definitely make them again.  Made 24 so have some to freeze for later.  They did not take very long to make either.  I am just learning how to make bread and this was a good confidence booster.  Loved Them!!!!

So yummy and soft and flaky on the inside!  Reminds me of the inside of the Pillsbury Flaky Biscuits.  I wanted something that really was a crescent roll and not just a roll in the same shape and these are as close as they get!  We moved to Hungary and I can't find shortening here so I used butter instead and they turned out great.  Threw everything in my bread machine.  Seemed a little sticky and soft when I took it out but in ended up fine.  Makes really big crescent rolls!  I had to tint them with foil the last 3 or 4 mins. or else they would have burned on top.  Will def. make again!!!

I've made this several times now and it's my go to recipe for crescent rolls.  I use my bread machine and substitute butter for the shortening.  It also makes great cinnamon rolls.  On one occasion, I didn't brush the dough with butter before rolling up and they were a little dry and not as tasty.  Other than that...it's a home run every time.

My husband loves this recipe.  I've also made it with wheat flour and the rolls turned out wonderful and they are so easy to make.  The only thing I do different is put it in a bread machine to mix and then bake it on 350.  I agree with the earlier post that 400 tends to burn the bottom of the rolls.

oh what can i say about this recipe? its fool proof. i've messed it up adding double the shortening, replacing shorteneing with olive oil. for me it rises within half an hour. i've put garlic and parmesean cheese inside, brown sugar and cinnamon, the possibilities for this dough is endless and they are so cute. i end up cutting each circle into 16 for mini crescent rolls for potluck dinners and they always disappear. dont know what i'd do without this recipe. its fast, easy, delicious.

these were fantastic and I agree with the other reviewer, a great place to start for first time yeast users.  I'll make them again for sure!  Wish I had this recipe years ago.

This is a great recipe, that I have been making for the last two years. As other bakers have suggested, I have decreased the baking time on this recipe. I baked my crescents at 350 for 12 minutes, and have found that they still are more brown on the bottom, than top, but at least they are not burnt  (like the last two times I have attempted THIS recipe). I gave this five stars, first of all because even though I burnt them the last two times I have made them, everyone still ate them, (they just peeled off the bottoms) and still said they were delicious!! Thank you Mike A. for sharing these!!!

I mixed the ingredients in my bread machine, however, I used Crisco for the shortening and it did NOT mix in with the dough..next time I will try melting it first. These rolls rose very nicely, however, they taste like they need more salt. I baked them at 350 in my convection oven for 12 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I will make them again and update this review using the melted shortening.

These are super!  I wrap them around hot dogs and bake them in the oven, and they work SO well for that.  They're good plain too!

I was tired of spending money on grocery store crescent rolls so I went looking for a recipe to make at home.  This was the first and last recipe I will try.  They were easy and turned out so yummy!  I love the slight sweetness the sugar adds.  Like some other reviewers, it took an hour longer for my dough to rise.

I made these since I was out of potatoes and could not make my favorite - Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls - from this site.  I still prefer the potato crescents, but these are pretty good.  I will keep them in my recipe book for those days when I don't have potatoes on hand.  I reduced the oven temperature to 325 so they would not burn and let the crescents rise an extra hour.

I wanted a dough for pigs in a blanket that didn't come from a can and I was very impressed with this! I used half butter, half shortening and put the dough in the oven to rise with the light on. It wasn't really rising so I turned the oven on to it's lowest temp and the dough puffed right up. Then I braided the dough around some of the dogs. I also rolled out long thick strands of dough and wrapped them around some dogs too. Let them rise in the warm oven again. Brushed them with an egg wash and presto! They baked up beautifully! Thanks for the recipe.

Completely wonderful! I was going to use a different recipe til I found I was short on eggs. Only had one egg to use and no shortening (used margarine). Used a pastry blender to cut in the margarine to the dry ingredients before adding the eggs and yeast/water. Don't know if that made a difference, but the end result was fantastic: soft & light roll, and pleasantly sweet enough.

These were a delight.  I was so busy when I made it that I just let them rise for longer than stated but it was just fine.  Excellent.  I'm not sure that it makes it better or not to sit rising/resting longer but they turned out light and yummy.  Not so much like a crescent (that is more the shape) but a great roll.  The butter in the middle adds a lot to it.  Thank you Mike.

Made according to the recipe. The taste was fantastic, the kids enjoyed them fresh and reheated the next day.  They were not as fluffy as I would have liked. I will make them again and try to keep the dough more elastic and add rising time. The flavor makes it well the extra attempt.   UPDATE: Made it again keeping the dough much more moist and the rolls rose better and were much lighter.  Incresed from 4 to 5 stars.

This turned out great. I used the dough for the veggie pizza on this site instead of the canned crescent dough. The only changes I made were that I halved it, used butter instead of shortening and used some whole wheat flour. I will definitely use this dough again and will be making the original rolls soon too!

Simple & Perfect. I'm glad I didn't halve the recipe, as these turned out so good--we keep going back for more. It had been awhile since I baked yeast breads, so after a quick refresher course from the site, I got to work! 
I used my stand mixer to knead the dough, (On low speed, it took about 20 minutes to reach the correct elasticity) and was rather generous with the rising times. (about 2 hours for first rise and 1-1/2 for second) I brushed the rolls with a light coat of melted butter, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder before rolling them up. I noticed that the baking time had to be reduced to 6-8 minutes, but the final result was amazing! The rolls were huge, fluffy and tasted great. I can't wait to try these as cinnamon rolls or "pigs in a blanket." I don't think I will ever buy the refrigerated crescent roll dough again! Thank you!

I'm not sure if it was due to the metric converter, but i needed a lot more flour. Otherwise these were ok. I had to freeze half of the dough and it thawed beautifully.

These are really good and easy to make. The dough took longer to rise for some reason. Also, I baked them for 15 minutes and they were golden brown on top but the bottoms were overdone. I will be making these again, but next time I'll be sure to raise my oven rack.

Absolutely wonderful. Easy, versitle. It is now my favorite recipe for dinner rolls and also for any of the sweet breads I make, like cinamon honey (my family's fave). I also substite butter for the shortening and the rolls turn out perfect every time.

i think i'm one of the few people who didn't really like these. they were too sweet and *very* dense, the dough didn't rise well for me but that is probably not the fault of the recipe. i prefer something less sweet and more light. i wouldn't call these crescent rolls at all.

For all those Nutella lovers out there, here's something you can try: Before rolling the rolls, spread Nutella on them, then roll them so the Nutella is on the inside. When they come out of the oven, they're awesome!

I will definitely make these again, they are delicious and better than store-bought!

I made these cresent rolls for Christmas this year and was quite surprised! I was a litte worried when the dough didn't rise as muchbas I thought it would (considering the two packets of yeast) but tbe dough was fine nonetheless. I would add that the dough is very sticky so a floured surface is key. I did add a small amount of honey to it, just for additional flavor.

I have a small food business and I love to cook. I REALLY love to bake tho. A very simple recipe and easy to pull off. I cook with kosher style salt and always add more than the recipe states. Probably 1.5 -1 for this. I like that they are a bit sweet. Makes them great for rolling with savorys. I saw one post having problems with rise of the new dough. I usually make a point of leaving yeast based douhs overnight. It usually is very beneficial. Under many circumstances, yeast doughs need more time and more time = better rise. You will also see a better "second" rise and when it goes into the oven, good things happen. Baking is time and patience. Im doing a batch for a small party and rolling them with ham and cheese. Like I said, these are great for svaory finish. I did them with hot dogs for the kids and they were pretty darned good. Again, I let the dough work overnight and got excellent results. More salt wont hurt. Just decide how you are going to use them before adding. One other thing, never, ever trust your temp dial on your oven. Get a good quality oven thermometer to hang in your oven. I have two and I tested them with my electronic bbq thermometer system and they were dead accurate. Get em, test em use em. Oven dials are notoriously off.

Lessons learned with this recipe-

Do not use rapid rise yeast.

Add 2 tablespoons of sugar. Yeast are sugar monsters according to a chef I took a cook class from at Sur La Table

Yeast will take longer to rise for some reason on this recipe. My experience was over night. Tried both wheat and white flour same result...long wait.
Overall my recipe came out great. See my pic. It's the heart shaped bread. It rose greatly while baking. Due to the sugar, had a nice "sweet" flavor almost like Hawaiian bread.  I also ran out of regular flour and used cake flour so that was probably a big no-no.

turned out pretty good! Still had a little bit of the yeasty flavor so I will add more butter next time, but overall these were a winner with my family. They puffed up quite large so I didn't see a need to add extra time on the pan.

for those of you wanting a more croissant like roll...you have to add another 1 cup of butter sliced up and kind of chunky then work the layers...croissants have layers that are only acheived by folding the dough on it self many times while still having the butter kind of chunky.  great though..

Mine raised fine (I always use a slightly warmed oven), but they were dinner rolls and not flaky pastry-like rolls the title would lead you to believe

Light and delicious!  Perfect for company dinners.  But be sure and keep an eye on them during baking; requires less baking time than stated.

Very Good!  I have baked rolls for 50 years, and this is a keeper.  To beth,  Crescent rolls refer to the way they are rolled.  You can make crescent rolls with any roll dough that is shaped before raising. Croissants are completely different, and not easy to make!  To Camas Mom,  did you proof your yeast first?  No matter what the new yeasts say, I always proof it to be sure it works.  This recipe does seem to take longer to raise, but they were worth it.  I put mine in a really warm place after they were shaped.  They are very light and fluffy.

These are a homemade version of pillsbury's crescent. Super easy to make, I made a half recipe and I used the dough to do sausage roll. A great hit with my husband. I will reuse this recipe in the future.

I've never had much luck with bread but decided to give this a try. I cut the recipe in half. I let it rise for about 2 hours the first time and I think it wound up being about an hour the second time. We just kept checking every 10 or 15 minutes to see if they'd doubled. On the advice of other commenters, we baked at 350 for 12 minutes and they came out perfect. The bottoms were nicely browned but not burnt and the tops were golden. Between my husband, my toddler, and me, we ate most of the pan right out of the oven! They're a little sweeter than the ones you get in the can but otherwise, pretty close. The kids love making pig-in-a-blanket with those so I can't wait till they get home to make up a batch with this recipe!

Amazing every time. Make sure you do have a definite warm spot though, or they will not rise. It is a great recipe for your first time making bread from scratch.

Have been making these delicious rolls for several years. I always use butter rather than shortening. 
Get  many compliments. The dough freezes well, I make it into 4 discs and wrap in wax paper and foil.
Awesome!

I made the dough for these in the bread machine then rolled them out into two pies, cutting each into 8 pie pieces.  My children wanted cheese in them.  So, we rolled some sliced cheddar into half of them as we rolled them into the crescent shapes and sliced cheddar plus a thin slice of turkey breast into the other half.  They were great little sandwiches for our lunch!  All of the children want me to make them again soon!  Thank you for sharing!

My mom has used this recipe for years. We get requests to take them everywhere. The original recipe (Lowell Inn Crescent Rolls) uses 4 cups sifted flour. We never sift so we use less... about 3 3/4 cups, your dough will be very sticky. This is the way you want it. The less you work with your dough the lighter and fluffier they will be. Don't knead,use a mixer or a bread machine, a spoon will do. We also use all butter no shortening... we just prefer that. This is a wonderful recipe AS IS. You can roll your rolls out put them on a sheet and freeze them. It will take about 3 warm hours for them to rise but they are very good.  Once you get the hang of it you won't be sorry.

These turned out pretty decent... better than the ones you buy in the store... this is a great recipe, however I am still not a huge fan of crescent rolls because they are a fat heavy bread.. but they do look wonderful and everyone else seemed to enjoy them...

I used my yeast straight out of the freezer and after 2 hours, the dough had only begun to rise. I left it while i went to church, came back three hours later, and it had doubled. I was relieved. So allow yourself plenty of time to rise, or make sure you use room temp yeast. The dough isn't sweet or overly flavorful, but is the perfect soft golden vehicle for honey butter! I easily got 32 out of the batch. I baked mine at 375 for 10 minutes and they were perfect.

This is a great recipe, but it's basically a really good dinner roll in the shape of a crescent roll. It's much denser and drier than what you might expect. But if you're looking for a thick bread to serve with dinner, this is your recipe.

Totally AWESOME rolls!  My first time baking bread and they were so easy.  I was afraid I had done something wrong when they didn't seem to rise.  I punched them down and let them rise once more than rolled them out.  When I checked on them a little later, they were the perfect size.  So happy with this recipe.  I will be using it a lot!

Yummy!  This was my first attempt at crescent rolls.  They turned out delicious.  I used my bread machine to make them, and used half of the dough to make cinnamon rolls.  The dough was so easy to roll out and cut.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe for a top and bottom crust for a Hoagie Bake on allrecipes.  I used a portion of wheat flour.  It tasted amazing.

My kids LOVE these. They even request them. I even forgot to butter them once, and no one noticed. I want to try mixing melted butter and honey then spreading on top just before they are done to see what that would taste like. I make them for every holiday. When my daughter-in-law was expecting, she couldn't keep anything down... except these. Thank you for sharing.

I thought these were excellent.I used a 5/16oz packet of dry active yeast and followed the recipe for everything else.Only difference is,I did not allow the second rising - i was using these for a pampered chef recipe - i rolled the dough and cut it like a pizza and added my filling and rolled them up like a regular crescent roll and baked them - they were golden brown and had great flavor.best of all is I had everything to make these on hand.Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!! Awesome!! I used this recipe to make homemade rolls for the first time...turned out perfectly!! The only modification I made is I used softened butter in place of the shortening.  I also used other reviewers' advice and doubled the rising times (for before rolling & after).  I also did as some others as well and divided the dough in half and did crescent rolls for dinner, and made cinnamon rolls with the other half of dough.  I rolled them out & prepared them at the same time as I did the crescent rolls, and let them continue to rise while the crescents baked. Since I didn't have any cream cheese with which to make a frosting, I whipped together a quick glaze oh 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp milk, and 1 tsp vanilla. Drizzled  it all over the cinnamon rolls after the finished baking and they look divine!  Now my husband and I can't wait to try them for breakfast tomorrow morning!

These are SO GOOD, but I haven't made them in awhile, and was going to make them again today.  Has anyone else noticed that the recipe calls for a stick of butter, but the instructions don't tell you when to add it?  Does a whole stick of butter seem like a lot?  I don't remember what I did about the butter last time I made these.

WONDERFUL recipe!! Best dinner rolls I've ever made. And they freeze really well too! Better than any I've tried. I made half a recipe and froze half, but now I wish I'd made the whole recipe. I will next time for sure. These taste just like the small dinner rolls my friend used to get and gorge on. I'm thinking I'll keep this a secret from her or I'll be having company every day LOL.

Yum! I mixed in the bread machine on dough cycle. Very easy dough to handle. I also followed recommendations and let rise for two hours before baking. Make sure to tuck the point way under -- some of mine came out and the rolls looked like birds! Still tasted great, of course :)

Followed recipe exactly. Next time I would use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. The recipe was extremely easy to make. I just rolled dough out into as much of a circle I could. This recipe is great in that if you don't roll out into a circle but a semi-circle (which is what I do) the rolls still work out perfectly since it is cut into long triangles. They were okay tasting but again since I only used shortening. I will update when I use the butter and shortening way. I thought the store bought crescent rolls were much better than these until I made some just 2 days ago and could not eat them. They were horrible. I think my palette is so used to homemade few now! Will definitely make again. I think these would be good with spices, cheeses, etc mixed in.

I like that the dough is a bit heavier. It is still flaky and very good.  I served them with honey butter and raspberry jam. Excellent recipe!

Crescents, NOT Croissants!! Don't be confused. They are nothing like Croissants. These were very good with a touch of sweetness. Served with jam and cheese (sweet and savory) Both delicious!

These were perfect and so easy! I had a recipe that called for canned crescent roll dough but didn't have any on hand.  I had to add a little extra flour to the dough to get the right consistency (about 1/8 cup) but otherwise I followed it exactly. I baked them on a stone for 13 minutes. Goodbye Pilsbury:)

THIS RECIPE IS SO DELICIOUS AND EASY TO MAKE. I HAVE USED IT FOR JUST REGULAR CRESCENTS AND I HAVE ALSO STUFFED IT WITH EITHER MEATS,CHEESES OR DIFFERENT PIE FILLINGS. THIS IS HIGHLY VERSATILE AS A BASE FOR MANY A RECIPE. KUDOS TO THE CHEF. MY HUSBAND INSISTS ON MY MAKING THIS RECIPE. HE SAYS IT'S THE BEST HE'S HAD. BETTER THAN GRANDMA!!!!

Way too dense, although it had a good flavor fresh from the oven, it was a crumbly mess when reheated. Will not make again.

I didn't make these entirely, as I made the dough to use for the chicken broccoli braid (also on this site), so I made the dough in my breadmaker, let it rise, then rolled it out for the braid.  It was a very good base for the braid.  I'll have to try it again as actual crescent rolls.

AWESOME recipe! Not only was this my first time making any type of bread from scratch, it was for Thanksgiving dinner! The rolls turned out so yummy! The only discrepancy I found was they only needed to bake for 5-8 minutes. Any longer and they got too brown/burnt, but that could just be my oven, so just make sure you're watching them and you'll do just fine! Thanks for submitting this recipe! It really is easy, and can be done by a rookie baker!

My family raved about these. I've had a hard time finding a roll that I can make that's nice and fluffy. These were perfect. The dough was very easy to roll out and work with.

I made and reviewed this recipe a couple years ago. The rolls turned out a little dense, but very tasty. I made them again for our Christmas dinner this year. I used half the dough for cinnamon rolls (turned out fabulous!) and the other half for crescent rolls. To make them flaky, you need to roll the dough out and spread some butter on the dough. Fold it in half, roll out, spread butter. repeat this a couple times so you have buttered the dough at least four times. Then you continue with the recipe (roll into a round, cut, butter, roll up). I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of yeast so the dough would rise more, and I used the bread machine to make the dough. Very good, super-flaky! Thanks for sharing, Mike!

This was my first attempt at making fresh rolls and they came out excellent. The yeast flavor really comes out and      makes the roll.

I've been making these rolls for a long time now. I didn't get to rating them until now. But they are the best! People ALWAYS ask for me to bring them, or make them! I HIGHLY recommend this easy to make roll! I also wouldn't change a thing!

Easy, no fuss recipe. The dough is easy to roll out and work with, and you only have to let it rise once!

The rolls come out almost perfect every time, and my whole family loved them.

These rolls were alright.  They tasted fine, but nothing out of this world.  The recipe worked great, I had no problems making them, they baked up just fine, but it seemed like a lot of work for OK rolls.

These were great!  I have tried many times to make rolls and always they come out yeasty tasting or hard, but these were perfect.  I let them rise about 1 hr more than the recipe called for for each rising so they would be truly doubled.

Like all bread, these were time consuming.  Pretty easy overall and the taste was pretty good.  Not spectacular, and maybe not worth the effort - but okay.

Edit: The family *really* loved these, so maybe they are worth the effort!

Very good rolls.  I made two batches for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  They also reheat well.  I made the recommended Cinnamon Honey butter (from this site) and it was the perfect pairing.

Very nice recipe. To make the rolls a little lighter and fluffier, I used 3 cups flour and 1 cup cake flour. Much easier to make in a hurry than traditional croissants.

LOVE these rolls.  I have made them dozens of times and they are always a hit. To save time. I sometimes do balls instead of crescents - perfect every time :).

I made these Crescent Roils for the first time. Very delicious and light, a little sweet like a dinner roll. Everyone in the Philippines enjoyed these rolls.  With that said, I believe the recipe say's to roll out half of the dough into a 12 inch round. I had enough dough to roll out into a 20 inch round, so the dough was thin enough to roll into a Crescent Roll. I ended up making more Rolls, then what it said it would make. But hey we love them. Also I sprinkled some garlic powder on them after brushing the butter and before rolling them into the Crescent Shape. My other thought, I could make these into light fluffy Cinnamon rolls, by putting sugar and cinnamon inside of them.

I let it raise longer like others suggested and added whole wheat and a tad more butter. Did the dough in the bread machine and it came out lovely. I'll be doing this again soon as I also wanna try it as a cinnamon roll. I'll reduce the sugar a bit for the bread rolls next time though...a bit too sweet for me but hubby loved it.

It was ok. Very sticky and had to add more flour. Didn’t say how long to knead. Did bake at 350 for ten minutes. Will look for better recipe.

Was hoping that these would turn out like my mother-in-law made long ago. They are good but lighter than hers were. Good with butter spread on them. Had them at Thanksgiving.

I loved it. I reduced the recipe to half. I actually left the first rise overnight. The second I left it for almost two hours. The results were astounding. I ended up making it for my family two nights in a row, as the first patch disappeared in no time. I give it five stars. I am already recommending it for my friends. Thank you for the beautiful recipe.

Best recipe I have EVER made and I have made a lot of bread! I turned mine into cinnamon rolls. I used bread flour and they are so soft, so fluffy and they rose so beautifully! I will be using this recipe from now on. Thanks to whoever shared this. It’s a keeper ??

Not really like a traditional crescent roll. Similar in texture and taste to a butter roll. Still very good. Next time I plan to put a lot of butter in the roll.

Very good crescents.  I added a little more flour while it was coming together/kneading because it was really sticking to the bowl, but I realized, although it needed more, not near like I added.  They would have been a bit more moist.  But they were still very good the way I made them.  I will make again, this time with 4 cups flour instead of 5.

This dough is really simple to make and comes out with a great texture. I used it for pigs in a blanket and cinnamon rolls. It was delicious in both!

I haven't made these yet, although they look really east. I just have one question; can I freeze part of the dough to use another time? There's only just the two of us and that looks like it makes a lot of rolls.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very dense and bland. If I made these again I would add some butter and garlic salt to the dough, and maybe some other seasonings as well.

I love this recipe, super simple to make and you really can’t screw it up! I have made the original for savoury scrolls but have since halved the sugar amount. I’ve also tried with whole-wheat flour-this was halved from the original amount to keep it nice and airy. Fantastic base recipe!

I used this recipe to make pizza pinwheels. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as well as the butter, and the salt to 1/2 tsp because  the filling I used was Parmesan, Mozzarella, and pepperoni. Turned out great, and now I don't have to buy canned crescent rolls to make the pinwheels. Thanks!

I've made a lot of different recipes for rolls. This was the best! The dough was wonderful to work with. After reading several reviews, I decided to reduce the heat to 350. Highly recommend.

I had to add more flour after the recipe amount to make the dough manageable to knead, and additional flour to knead.  All together I use about 5  1/2 cups, not 4.

I thought that these crescent rolls were amazing. The only ting I would change would be the cooking time to 5 or seven minutes.

Ommmmmm num num num!!!!
These are soooooooo good. Terrible for the waistline though because all you want to do is eat them. I also like to throw all the ingredients in my bread machine on dough mode and finish it in the oven. And it worked perfectly for these. I made a chicken cordon bleu wreath, and used the balance to make croissants. So, so good.

I have made this quite a few times and here are a few tips that always work for me: never use off-brand (grocery store brand or generic) bread yeast. Fleishman's is what I use, or King Arthur Flour. I have found the cheaper versions are pretty disappointing and not worth the savings. Also, I first mix the very warm water with the yeast and sugar and and let that sit for a bit until it is bubbly and frothy looking, then proceed with the recipe. It gives the yeast a head start. These are wonderful and perfect for those who are afraid of bread baking.

A family favorite, every Thanksgiving for > 50 years. Originally brought to us by a family friend, hence known to our family as "Uncle Artie's Rolls."
After forming crescents and final rise on baking sheet, we always brush with water and sprinkle with poppy, sesame, or celery seeds before going into oven. Three seeds make a nice variety, although plain rolls are great on their own.

They had no flavor. I let them rise for 4 hours total and they were still so dense. They didn't taste like anything except dense, greasy bread. I tried putting honey on one and peanut butter on another but the bread was too dense. I will not make these again.

This was a good recipe. Very soft and pliable dough. I thought much more dense than canned crescent dough, but I'd prefer that way. I did not use quite 4 cups of flour; if I had I think it would have been a bit dry. I added that last cup little by little to ensure I did not use too much and dry it out. Ended up using about 3 1/2 cups, or slightly over. Worked really well in making a cheeseburger roll. Thank you - I will definitely be using again, and for crescent rolls.

I made half the recipe. Used bread flour. Added egg after initial cup of flour. Only baked for 10 minutes. Used dough to make 12 resurrection rolls. Skipped brushing with butter. Still good.

I will certainly be making these again. Instead of using 1/2 cup of sugar, I used a 1/2 a cup of honey and just added more flour to compensate for the honey being a wet ingredient. If you don't have a proofer (I just use the WRM setting on my oven and stick the dough in there I then turn the oven off and on periodically, always works fine--no fan on of course) then I would recommend heating the honey first, else wise the dough will be too cold to rise.

Perfect way to start...This was my first try in my Mommy Kitchen :p Awesome output... even I was shocked. Only thing we can add up to this is we can stuff in some cheese to it while rolling up for added taste. Thanks a ton :) ;)

I made these for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas, and everyone loved them! I don't know why people are saying they substituted the shortening, because the recipe says nothing at all about using shortening. Unless it's been edited. Perhaps some are not kneading enough to get them fluffy, because they turned out perfect for me every time!  No they are not like croissants, because they are crescents.........

I made pigs in a blanket to go with our Mac n cheese & made some "desert" crescent rolls. Market Basket stopped carrying immaculate baking company's crescent rolls & I'm allergic to all the others (swollen tongue) so decided to try making some. Recipe isn't as easy as I was hoping but a lot easier than others I looked up. They came out fantastic! For dessert I made some with butter, cinnamon and sugar (didn't put enough inside so I just poured some on top), some with peanut butter chips, chocolate chips& mini marshmallows & some with just marshmallows & chocolate chips (I'm allergic to the peanut butter chips).

These are so good and super easy. Threw everthing into my bread machine, used the dough cycle and finished off in the oven. Made 2 batches for Thanksgiving and not a crumb left over.

to me, it kind of tasted like a dinner roll at a four star restaraunt but honestly, those kind are way better than a five star resteraunt because otherwise, theres no heart... still, this recipe is TERRIFIC!!! even with inferior ingredients and sloppy measurements, it still turned out great... and, it was my FIRST TIME MAKING BREAD... i plan to make it again very soon and will probably experiment with different shapes such as rolls or loaves or even pigs in a blanket....(by the way... the trick is to envelope the little smokies completely in dough...) i absolutely LOVED this recipe and will cherish it many more times.... just, perhaps not in the shape of a crescent... ;-) either way... imagine all the money you'd save as opposed to cans of dough...

These were excellent!  Easy to make and they turned out perfect.  For a variation, you can also mix together 1/2 Cup Sugar and 1 Tbls Cinnamon and sprinkle a little on each wedge and then roll them up.   They are like little cinnamon sugar crescents and taste amazing!

I made these as a hamburger pastry, I added a little honey (for me the yeast works better with honey than sugar but I used both)  I rolled out the dough,cut it into squares and filled it with creamy cheesy hamburger, then folded it over and sealed it.  I sprinkled them with cinnamon after I put on the additional butter and cooked at 400 for 20 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS!!  I do not have good luck with bread recipes so I am very excited about this recipe.  Thank you for posting this 5 star recipe

I made these so I could make pigs in a.blanket. I didn't let them rise and just rolled them out and rolled the hot dogs inside. They were incredible. Tasted just like the crescent rolls from the store.
It was a quick spur of the moment snack.

Great recipe and instructions, have made this multiple times and is never a bad batch. You can also add a simple butter or sugar glaze to the rolls when half-way baked and change the flavor however you like. Very adaptable recipe!

They are great for pigs-in-a-blanket.  Here in southern Costa Rica, we don't have any tubes of biscuits or rolls.  But, these are every bit as good.

DELICIOUS! Made pizza stuffed crescent rolls using this recipe because the crescent rolls at the store were just too expensive. I let the dough rise for an hour and a half, and after separating, I let it sit for 30-45 minutes to rise again. The end result was WAY better than store bought ... soft and buttery and flaky. I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they were a perfect golden color. I'll be using again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought they came out very good.  The flavor was excellent, nice a fluffy too.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it took a lot of time but I'll def use this one again for special occasions!

This was very yummy and pretty.  I would like it to be more dense, or maybe more buttery.  I will tweak it a bit but I loved it overall.

I used this to make pizza pinwheels as I usually would make with Pilsbury cresents. (great make ahead and freeze lunch items) These taste very similar, but better!! I used 40% ww flour and substituted the butter for the shortening, and shortening for the butter as it was a ratio I was better with.  Still turned out great!  even better knowing I know what went into them vs. the pastry in a tube!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've made lots of rolls and I love this recipe! They are easy to make. You can even make the dough in the bread machine. Just layer it according to the directions that came with your machine. Then roll and let rise. Fantastic!

This was a great recipe as I usually make a similar one with canned Pumpkin for Thanksgiving but was looking for a good crescent roll recipe without the pumpkin and this is definitely it.  I did substitute 1/2 cup of milk heated with 1/4 cup water to equal 3/4 cup warm liquid.  Also used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 2 Tbsp. Wheat Bran in addition to flour.  You may have to add more water.  It's all in the feel of the dough. These turned out as light as air and freeze well also. We loved them :-)

The texture was nice but lacking in flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I make these I will add half butter and half shortning to the dough, to achieve the buttery flavor.

Mine just did not rise like they should have.  They tasted more like a roll than a crescent roll.

This dough is fabulous to work with. I made exactly as instructed and used the dough to make sausage crescent rolls. They were delicious.  Can also use 1/2 whole wheat flour. I will be making this again and again.

This was my first attempt at making bread and it was pretty easy! I made the dough and then rolled cocktail smokies, bacin and cheddar cheese inside and baked. YUMMY. I think out of the 2.5 dozen I made there was only 2 left! We will make this bread again, next time in a garlic form for spaghetti. On a side note, some have said that these are not as 'light and flaky' as they were expecting, crescent rolls are not supposed to be light and flaky, they are not croissants but more like a diner roll.

I didn't follow this recipe to completion but used the dough for another recipe that called for pre-made crescent roll dough. It was by far the lightest dough I've ever made, and it was delicious as well.

I served this for Christmas dinner. Neither I or anyone else finished our first roll, much less go back for seconds.  The only positive thing about this recipie is how easy it was to make. Pretty bland and unremarkable. I got about 20 rolls out of the recipie.

Made great crescent rolls, although mine took more time than usual to rise.  i gave them an extra hour during seocnd rise (2 hours total for second rise).  I also wanted to thank Suzy for her review.  I'm just cooking for my bf and me so half the dough made 8 good sized crescent rolls and I used the other half to throw together cinnamon rolls for dessert.  Brilliant!

Not as good as the recipe I have, however the time savings can be worth it!  My recipe takes 3 days, so this is great when time is limited.  The taste wasn't bad to me, others really liked them.  I will probably use again but will stuff them with cheese & little smokies.  Thanks!

Just what I was looking for! I did do this recipe in my bread maker and it turns out excellently. I made little hot dog piggies in the blanket for a fun treat for my kids with half of the dough and made cinnamon rolls with the other half. For the cinnamon rolls I spread butter all over my dough rolled out as directed in this recipe except I shaped into a rectangle. I mixed 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and sprinkled this all over the dough, rolled it up, cut into 1 inch slices, placed them in an 8x8 pan and refrigerated overnight. Pulled them out only as long as it took my oven to preheat and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and iced with a combination of milk and confectioners sugar. I liked that one half the recipe is enough for meal with my family and I can have a simple solution for breakfast as well.

Perfect crescent rolls! Slightly sweet, soft inside, perfectly crisp and buttery outside. I halved the recipe since I'm a single girl ;-) and used half whole wheat / half white flour (I like heartiness in breads), baked on pre-heated stoneware for 12 minutes exactly and they were wonderful. Any longer would have been too long I think, so be sure to watch them like all quick baked goods! Puff up very very nicely, and are impressively pretty for being hand done!

This was an easy recipe but I'm sorry to say I didn't love these.  I'm going to stick with my other much loved roll recipe.  I think the 2 eggs and the shortening make these heavier & more dense than what I usually make.  They were fun to make though, thanks for the recipe.

I was disappointed in these.  The flavor was fair, they took longer to rise than stated, and the texture wasn't particularly light.  I have made similar rolls from this site (Blue Ribbon Overnight Rolls) that are much better.

This recipe worked great as a wrap for little smokies cocktail sausages. Instead of spreading the butter after rolling, I just melted and included with all the other ingredients. Then rolled the sausages in them after cutting the wedge.

**Using the recipe this way, they are much better reheated in the microwave before serving....not straight from the oven!**

These were the best crescents I've ever tasted!  My family loved them and we just kept eating them.

This is a great recipe!! The dough is a delight to work with!!! I had to let it rise longer, but they come out wonderful!! And very easy to roll out!! this will be on my table often. Have already made them twice in two weeks! Thanks!
