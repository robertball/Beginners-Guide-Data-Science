Classic Martini recipe...I even prefer to bump up the gin / dry vermouth mix ratio to 50/50 for my 'perfect' martini. Add a dash of bitters, stir quickly on ice and strain... not too cold or you'll deaden your tastebuds. You won't want to miss this one!

Followed the recipe ratios...used Grey Goose and Martini vermouth. I did vary the olives though and used jalapeno stuffed olives...gave it a little pizazz.
