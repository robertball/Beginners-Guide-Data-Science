My husband and kids loved this, though I wasn't overly fond of the strong  rosemary flavor.  I thought it overpowered the rest of the flavors.  I will definitely make it again, but will either use unseasoned pork chops or add my own rosemary to regular chops to control the flavor.  I think bringing more garlic flavor out would be good as well.

Made it with regular fresh pork sirloin (much less sodium) than pre-packaged marinated ones.  Added fresh rosemary when adding the chicken broth.  Came out delicious!  A Big Hit!

I don't care for meat, but this was simply delicious. I'll look forward to making it again.  I did add a tablespoon of flour in a small amount of water to make a thick yummy gravy.

I did not have any Smithfield rosemary seasoned pork sirloin so I made my own using fresh rosemary and pork steaks.  I have no idea if mine was like Smithfield's or not but it was good.  I blended finely chopped fresh rosemary with about 1/3 cup olive oil.  I let it sit.  While the bacon was frying I coated the chops with the oil and rosemary mixture.  I suppose for a stronger rosemary flavor letting them sit overnight would have been good but I didn't have time for that this time.  I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written.  My family thought it was very good.

As a single person,  changed the recipe to accommodate a 2 pork chop meal, recipe  seemed bland.   Everything was great, awesome kitchen smell, downsized recipe.  The only problem noted is flavor of the pork chops. Was afraid to brown meats  as per recipe.  Served with pesto & noodles

This was delicious. I made it exactly as the directions except I used boneless pork chops instead of the marinated pork loin. I added a sprig of rosemary to add that flavor. Will definitely make again.

Really good but I think that the cooking time was a bit long, 1 inch thick pork chops were a little dry and tough

Didn't change anything but I did omit the mushrooms because I didn't have any on hand. The most tender and delicious pork chops I have ever eaten. Anxious to prepare again and add mushrooms.

I made a lot of changes because of what I had on hand.  I had a bone-in pork sirloin, so I decided to cook it in the crock pot first with garlic, onion, soy sauce and bay leaf ( as instructed in the savory recipe from the Fix-It and Forget-It Cookbook).  That made it tender and pull apart easy.  I sectioned it into large pieces, then followed the recipe with the following substitutions because of what I already had: white mushrooms instead of cremini, adding 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and only three precooked large pieces of bacon instead of six.  It turned out pretty good--maybe 3 or 4 stars.  However, I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because I think the right flavors were all there.  I think the secret that I missed out on was being able to sear the chops in bacon grease before cooking.

Fantastic!  Made as directed but I forgot the Balsamic Vinegar and it was great without it.  Does not need salt if you use regular chicken stock.  I LOVED IT!

Amazing! Easy to make, pork chops were tender and extremely flavorful. We ate it too fast to take a picture! I made with thick cut pork chops and added dried rosemary to pan when searing. My husband insisted I make this for our next holiday he loved it so much, and I was more than pleased with the outcome. Highly recommend!

This was a great success.  The pork was garlic and olive oil marinated and I added the rosemary. Otherwise followed the recipe. My family is begging me to make it again!

I was out of balsamic vinegar so used red wine vinegar and a little sugar instead.  Followed everything else  as written.  The family and our guests loved it.  I will make again.
