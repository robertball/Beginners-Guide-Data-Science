I doubled the marinade and left the pork loin in for the full 24 hours.  It was great.  First time I've ever had marinade penetrate the entire roast.  I served it with Hawaiian sweet bread, a salad with raspberry vinaigrette, and Honey roasted red potatoes.  The meal was a hit.  Thanks

This was wonderful!  I used 2 small pork tenderloins and it was done in less than an hour.  The flavor was wonderful and it was very moist and juicy, not dry at all.  I will use this again!

My husband loved this. I'm not a pork eater, and didn't try it...but going on what he said, I could make this again. I didn't think it looked appetizing, what with the green marinade, and it didn't smell tantalizing to me; I wasn't even tempted to try a taste.

I made a 4.5 lb pork loin for 10 people, and doubled everything in the recipe. I figured it would take ~3hrs to cook based on my (limited) experience with other recipes for pork loins of this size. However, It cooked fully in less than 1 hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My sister claims that the acidity of the marinade caused the protein to break down, and that's why it cooked so fast. I marinated it for about 10 hours. After keeping it warm and frequent basting for 2 hours until my guests arrived, it turned out great! My guests were a little scared of the green sauce, but in the end everyone really liked it! Will definitely try again!

Using the pork tenderloin made the recipe even faster to make, and the flavor was to die for!

This was good.  Not outstanding, but good.  Didn't have lime juice, so subbed lemon juice.  The marinade smells a bit wierd and not sure if we cared for it served as a sauce after cooking.  The pork is left with a good flavor and subtle crust, if a tad dry.  Not bad, but won't be in a hurry to repeat.
