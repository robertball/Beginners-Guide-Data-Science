I am sorry to say that this recipie was awful.  My very polite boyfrind even threw his out, he has never done that before.  Although the texture was great it tasted really pruny... I will try it with some other sort of fruit.

I have made this cake twice now and both times it came out great! It's very moist and tastes chocolatly without being too overpowering. It's easy to make except I modified the recipe by using 2 whole large eggs (including the yolk & whites) instead of the 4 egg whites and used 2% milk. I think this is what helps cut down the prune taste. The first time I made it I paired it with a vanilla cream cheese frosting & filling I made. The second time around I made it with a butterscotch/caramel combined with heath bar pieces as a topping & filling which I brought to the office. My coworkers all enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. It also seems to taste better the 2nd or 3rd day stored in a covered cake stand at room temp.

We made this recipe for our wedding 5 years ago. We made a total of 8 cakes and 4 pounds of whipped butter icing, with BC red raspberries scattered over the top. We had 80 people at our wedding Reception and not a crumb was left.  Great recipe, although I used whole eggs.The cakes were very heavy, moist and chocolaty.

I halved this for the two of us and baked it in a loaf pan. I used apple sauce because I had that on hand and I used a whole egg to replace the egg whites. Very tasty cake. Will def make it again.

This is a VIRTUALLY fat-free chocolate cake that is very moist and tastes like a boxed-mix (in a good way).  I find the powder sugar "melts" on top, so don't sift it over the top until just before serving.  If I'm using this for a birthday party, I use the Vanilla-Chocolate frosting for it and people can't tell that it's low-fat!  You can also put the whole egg in but that changes the nutritional info (as does the real frosting). Don't tell finicky eaters about the prunes though, they'll reject it on principle. As for the 1-star reviewer whose boyfriend threw it out--  she HAD to have done something like make her own puree, reduce the amount of coffee or cocoa because you cannot taste the prunes if it's made CORRECTLY.

For us this is a lovely cake because we like prunes.  Have to cut back on the sugar (we are trying for less sugar in our diet).  For those of you who do not like prunes suggest you use baby food plums.
