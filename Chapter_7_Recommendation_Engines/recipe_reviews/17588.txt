I used to make this exact cake years ago. I do have a tip though... after you prep the crust... bake it for 10 minutes. Don't overcook it however as it will turn hard as cement, but the baked crust makes the dessert.

Great!  Just like the one Mom used to make, except without the raw eggs.  I substituted Neufchatel for the cream cheese and added 1 tsp vanilla to the cheese/butter/sugar mix.

Delish!  Easy to make, I used a prepared graham cracker pie shells and made 2.  I didn't have glaze but really didn't miss it.  Also canned real whipped cream and Hershey's chocolate sauce.  This will be a summer favorite, everyone loved it.

I have used this same recipe with one alteration. It is easier and less fattening. Rather than making a graham crust, just place a lyer of graham crackers in the bottom of the pan and make a day ahead and refridgerate. This dessert is also a great make ahead and freeze for unexpected social events. Love it!

This is a very good recipe. I didn't use the strawberry glaze, but used chocolate syrup and nuts on top like a sundae. It was a big hit with my family.

Good for a kids party but I wouldn't recommend it as an adult dessert. A little messy and not at all attractive when served.

Thanks so much for sharing!  I have been looking for an eggless version of this recipe! Changes:   I used the canned whipped topping (instead of CoolWhip)to add to each piece just before serving AND I drizzled warm ganache (using the all recipes Pro Ganache recipe).  I toasted pecans to throw on there, too.  What a hit! This recipe will be made again and again!

I guess I'm in the minority. This was just way too sweet for my taste. My husband and daughter-in-law loved it but they love their sweets. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not sure I like the cream cheese filling. It reminds me of frosting. As I said, just too sweet for my sweet tooth.

This cake was incredible!!  Whole family raved about it.  I baked only 1/2 of the cake mix in my 13 x 9 baking pan, as I needed room for the other ingredients.  I also added 16 oz. of defrosted, sliced frozen strawberries over the cake before I spread the pudding/cream cheese mixture.  YUM

I wanted this cake instead of a regular cake for my birthday and it was so delicious!  So yummy! We left of the strawberries and strawberry glaze(didn't have on hand).  It came out so good! You won't be dissapointed.

This recipe has great potential... and I'm glad I listened to my baking/cooking instincts. The cream cheese layer as posted is way too sticky and overpowering sweet.  I fell back on my staple cream cheese/powdered sugar recipe and doubled it for this cake.  I'm glad I did!    I used the remaining of the stick of butter (6 T) to make the crust and baked it like suggested.  I also added chocolate chips and walnuts to the top.  I got rave reviews and a request for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing an eggless version!

Yum! Chopped fresh pineapple and sprinkled chocolate chips on top as part of deco and it was delish! VERY popular with bro-in-law and teenage nephews.

Use chocolate graham crackers for this and cherry pie filling instead of strawberries.  It's ALWAYS the favorite dessert at any function I take it too.

I cheated a little bit - got the pre-made individual-serving-size graham cracker crust pie shells.  Also made two slight modifications. I did not use the strawberry glaze, and instead of the frozen whipped topping, I made real whipped cream and piped it on.  Also, I drizzled with fudge sauce before sprinkling with chopped peanuts and the cherry.  YUMMY!  Will definitely make this again!

Nothing but rave reviews! I put the crust in the freezer instead of baking it or putting it in the fridge. I added a bit of caramel on top as well. A+++ all the way!

I followed someones suggestions and used 2 cups of sugar, 2 cream cheeses (low fat), low fat cool whip and no butter to cream cheese mixture. I also did not use strawberry glaze, neither chocolate glaze or marashimo cherries (did  not have any of that). My husband did not like it (he doesnt care much about sweets) but everybody else did. Plus it did not hurt our diets :)

I made this dessert to offset all of the rich cakes and pies made on Thanksgiving.  I used neufchantel instead of regular cream cheese, as well as the lite cool whip to cut the fat.  You can't really skimp on margarine, but all in all it made an excellent lite and fruity dessert that left those heavy cakes and pies untouched on the kitchen counter.

I made this "cake" dessert for my son's 2nd birthday.  He's a big strawberry fan and loved it.  He also enjoyed helping make it.  I cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups and it was still great.  Terrific and fun recipe, Terry!  Thanks!  Oh, my Mom wants me to make it for her birthday too!

Okay this recipe is awesome. Of course I did a little tweaking to it to fit my taste. I left out the strawberries and strawberry glaze. Then I added chopped pecans on top. I made this for Christmas and it was gone in no time. I have already made another batch for our house. Love it!

I made this for my sister's birthday, my whole family loved it.  My dad said it was the best dessert I had ever made, everyone went back for seconds, which is unusual for my family.  I used low fat graham crackers & fat free cream cheese too.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. I have made it for 3 cookouts, and my guests always love it. It is definitely a keeper in my collection of recipes. The only change I make is regular strawberry glaze, instead of sugar free.

I've made a variation of this cake for at least 30 years. I still like my version more. I use a combination of vanilla yogurt and instant pudding for the filling instead of cream cheese, sugar and butter. It's just lighter and more refreshing. I also omit the maraschino cherries. Those things are nothing short of plastic with a few chemicals thrown in. Trust me, you won't miss them in this wonderful summer dessert.

made this in cupcake form for my husband's birthday and we loved it, though i didn't have any pineapple for it nor did i use a glaze. It tasted like DQ's banana cream pie and strawberry cheesecake blizered smooched together.

WONDERFUL RECIPIE BUT I USE THE FROZEN SLICED STRAWBERRIES FOR EASE (AND SOMETIMES THE FRESH ARE NOT SWEET) I ALSO SOMETIMES PUT KIWI IN IT TO GIVE IT A NICE ZING :)
