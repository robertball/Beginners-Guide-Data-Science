I didn't have jumbo eggs, so I added another egg white. Ended up with 7 muffins, but I ate one so fast it shouldn't count. Think I could have fit in 6 cups, but I figured they would expand more than they did. This isn't a runny batter, more the texture of a meatloaf, but it worked out great. These are delicious, and my new favorite way to feed my husband a better breakfast.

I thought these were great. I had them for lunch.  I had to use fresh spinach as what I thought was frozen spinach was really green beans and I used peppered turkey bacon. I did add a dash or Sriracha.. yum

A good concept, but much too 'savory.'  Used 3 large eggs and I think I got the texture right for the recipe.  It made 1 dozen, loosely spooned into cups.  You can tell by the recipe that this is not a batter.  They were somewhat greasy.

I suspect I will try it again, because it is a good idea, easy, and something new for a quick breakfast.  Will not add Worcester sauce at all.  Did not use garlic and won't use any of the spices listed. Will make more like baby quiches. I think the quinoa will make baby quiches have enough texture and chew to be filling.  Will mix 3 eggs and maybe a cup of milk into the quinoa, spinach and cheese, then put into parchment muffin cups.  I'm thinking the bacon didn't do much for it, so unless I have some just waiting around bored, I'll probably leave that out also. 

Anyway, I still think this is a good idea and could be excellent once adjusted to my tastebuds.  This recipe as written is too 'savory' for any time of day, especially breakfast. 

I took pictures and will try to upload them. If it works, one photo is before baking, and one after.
