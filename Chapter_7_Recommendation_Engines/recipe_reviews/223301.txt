I combined this recipe and another one on this site to make my favorite harissa ever.  Instead of the fresno and habanero, I used fresh jalapeno peppers (4)and did NOT roast them, and instead of lemon juice, added fresh cilantro.  Very very good harissa.

This is my third try making harrissa and I'm sticking with this recipe. I also used fresh jalapeno peppers instead of Fresno and it turned out great.

Background:  grew up in Texas, travelled the world in the military and after, and grew up to love all things hot.  THIS is the best hot sauce I've tasted bar-none.  Only had one red bell, no mint, and no Fresnos, so instead of traipsing to the store for them I used a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers (less the juice) plus the red bell I roasted.  Substituted 4 jalapenos and about a Tblsp Sriracha to get the heat up, and used Basil rather than Mint.  Not quite what you may have intended  with my substitutions but WOW--Chef John my hat's off to you.  A great balance between taste and heat.  Thanks for your efforts as your recipes are always winners.  Been cooking for over 40 years--still learning!

We used Tunisian bak louti peppers from our garden instead of the Fresno chiles, and it was so good.  Thanks for all your great recipes and videos, Chef John!

YUM! I had a hard time getting the membranes off the peppers though. I might blanch a little longer next time. I also need the coriander and caraway seeds. I looked up substitutions and was able to use cilantro, dill, and parsley. I can only imagine how much better it would be with the exact recipe.

We love this sauce, goes great on eggs or meat.  I upped the habanero peppers and substituted olive oil.  I also use fresh cilantro instead of the coriander seed because I grow this.  Plus I will use lime if I don't have any lemon on hand.

Thank You Chef John for another wonderful recipe. I usually don't write reviews if I change the recipe but this absolutely was amazing. I didn't have caraway seeds so I used cumin and it worked just fine. kept everything else the same. 
my hubby and 13 year old daughter loved it too.

Wow. Spicy for sure and not for the faint of heart and we eat Hatch, NM chile! Next time I think I will add half a habanero and more red peppers than green chile. However, I do like the spices that are used.

I fell in love with Harissa after buying a 'Harrisa salsa' last week. I wanted to try a simpler one, but couldn't find the birds-eye chili peppers it called for. This one balances the sweet and heat and earthy depth of spice. A perfect marinade for chicken or dipping sauce. I left out the habanero, as I didn't have any available.

I’m addicted to this - mine came out a bit more liquid than I anticipated - but the flavor is amazing and I’ll be making it again and again playing with different peppers.  The slow heat is just what I was looking for!  This was also fun to make!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is so delicious! I had to use different hot peppers and fresh mint, but all the same seasonings. It's super good. Thanks again Chef John!

This was wonderful.  I made this to serve with Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce. 


I've not been able to find harissa hot sauce where I live, but this tasted fantastic.  I upped the amount of chiles because I like spicy food.  I will make this to go with all med dishes I make in the future until I find a better recipe (I'm not holding my breath).

First time making Harissa and as usual, Chef John's cooking techniques made it relatively easy for this novice to pull it off.  I could not find the fresno peppers so instead used one habinaro with 3 Jalapeños and the two red bell peppers.  It was spicy but not overwhelming and tasty.

This is an amazing yet different sauce from the usual.  I love hot, and it's hot, but in a really nice way. The texture is wonderful as well. A very unique and hot flavor that tastes fresh - that is, other sauces and spiced dips etc often have a 'preservative' component, but this is obviously fresh and clearly unique.

This sauce may not be traditional, but it is AMAZING on almost everything - pizza, meat, rice, you name it. I added 2 habaneros with all the seeds because I really like spice and it was good, although I would have liked it spicier. It has a gorgeous color and flavor (the sauce is nothing without the spices) and it reminds me of the spicy sauce at a Himalayan restaurant nearby that I was trying to recreate.

This is the second time I made it. This time I substituted one red pepper with a glass of roasted piquillo peppers. Really loved both versions! This is is by far one of the best chili sauces. So flavorful and well-balanced! I  like to pair it with couscous and greek yogurt but it really goes with everything! 
Thanks for another excellent recipe, Chef John! Keep up the good work!
