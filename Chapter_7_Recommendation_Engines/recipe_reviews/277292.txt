Instead of syrup I mixed the following:  1/2c sour cream, 1/2 c granulated sugar, 1/2 lemon juiced, a little leftover zest and a few drops of vanilla. Whisk together well and serve from creamer pitcher. Pancakes are also delicious with some vanilla chips and chopped unsalted macadamia nuts folded in prior to frying.

11.29.19  The only thing that I did differently was to fold the blueberries into the batter rather than dropping them onto the pancake batter and then adding more batter.  The blueberries pop in your mouth, there’s just a hint of lemon, and this had just the right amount of sweetness for us (basically, not too much sugar). Using a 1/4 cup measure, I ended up with 8 good-sized pancakes (so two per person). I've made a lot of pancakes, and this batter texture was spot on.  Very tasty recipe, and I’d make again.

These were pretty good.  I would definitely make them again.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I just folded the berries into the batter and added a little vanilla.  Next time I would add more milk because the batter was a little thick.   I would add more vanilla and a little nutmeg to the batter for a flavor kick.

I thought the batter was a little thick and I added more milk to thin it down a bit.  I also added 1/2 t of vanilla, just because I like vanilla.  I used a Meyer lemon because they are in season and I love them.  But, overall, we enjoyed the pancakes very much.

These were so good! I followed recipe exactly but used a light maple syrup. The pancakes were very good! The lemon zest gave the batter a touch of lemon which really gave this recipe an extra boost.

They were really good! definitely a switch from regular old pancakes. I felt the batter was a little too thick, so I just added a tad more milk which is  the standard for regulating the thickness. I used half gluten free flour. They turned out nice and fluffy, tangy and flavorful. Butter and real maple syrup add just the right balance for tangy and sweet. Will definitely make these again.

If you like the flavor of lemon and you like blueberries then you’ll love the combination of the two together.  A really delicious change for breakfast.

I made it two ways.  Once according to the recipe and once by adding blueberries into the mix.  Both tasted excellent, but the frozen blueberries I had turned the mix blue. So although they tasted excellent blue is not my favorite color for pancakes.  With that said, they are the best pancakes I ever had.  My wife also loves them.  Very flavorful.

I’ve been making similar recipe for a few years. I just use the ultimate pancake recipe from Bisquick and add lemon zest. I did learn from this recipe to add the frozen blueberries on top of pancakes while cooking. Thanks for the tip. Lemon Blueberry Pancakes are the best.

These fluffy lemon blueberry pancakes were delicious and worth the little extra effort to zest a lemon  I sprinkled cinnamon on top of the batter and mixed it in before cooking. It was a nice addition and did not take away from the lemon flavored batter. Paired with Chai Blue Turtle Tea was a winning combination. This recipe is one I will look forward to making again

These were very good, however, they were a lot thicker than I would’ve preferred. Next time I will try adding a little more milk.

I have to try this again.  Not sure what I didnt do but I found the pancakes to be very dense and bland beyond the blueberry. I was hoping for a more fluffy pancake.  The lemon rind smelled good when I mixed the dry ingredients, however there wasn't even a hint of lemon when I ate the pancake.   I like the idea of this recipe, I just need to figure out how to cook the pancake I'm looking for.

Absolutely delightful burst of flavor. Our family loved them and begged for me to make them again. We used maple syrup from our own trees.

Pancakes did not cook well and followed the recipe exactly. They were okay, not a big hit with my family.

Great! I only added about 1.5 tsps of lemon zest that I had frozen and next time add more, maybe 3 tsps.

Very disappointing.  Followed the recipe to a T.  Blah and some a little doughy tasting.  The first batch turned very dark waiting for bubbles to pop before turning.  They didnot have a burnt taste but just had very little flavor.  I usually use the pancake recipe from this site Sunday Morning Lemon Poppy Seed.  Flavorful light and fluffy.  Always have curdled milk on my recipes

This was a really good recipe! I used half wheat and half white flour! I had some frozen lemons and zesting them was hard, so I peeled them and used the magic bullet to chop them up super fine! They were  super good!

I made as stated and there's only 1 left out of a double batch. Served with absolute best syrup on site. I did wear a  plastic glove to handle blueberries. Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed the flavor of these pancakes but they were very thick. I added 3 cups of milk instead of  1 and it was still super thick.

I enjoyed these pancakes but my son and husband did not care for the lemon zest. I would also recommend cooking on a lower heat to keep from burning them or thinning out the batter a little. They were so thick that at the higher heat they would start to burn before the center was done.

Used gluten free flour and 1tsp xanthan gum. Added extra egg and milk. Dough too thick. Would use Blueberries as a topping rather than add in with batter
