I started this recipe without reading the reviews...However I changed it a bit and it turned out wonderful!!! I mostly followed the recipe but only cooked it for 45 min (1/2 batch) and added only 3/4 cup sugar. Then I strained the rhubarb pulp out. This left me with a beautiful pink colored liquid. The cubes were delicious in tea and great in lemonade as well!!! Thanks Stephanie great idea!!!

Tried it as described.  Doesn't taste good to me.  4 hours is too long to cook. Turns brown and tastes like molasses.  Doesn't freeze solid. Use a spoon to get it out of ice cube tray. Stays on the bottom of the glass and melts then there is all the rhubarb pulp. Better off putting the cooked rhubarb in a jar and freeze or refrigerate and use as a spread on toast or english muffin.

I thought was a decent iced tea.  I didn't use as much sugar for the tea part since I am not a big sweetened tea drinker.  I also didn't make the rhubarb ice cubes since I threw away my trays when I got my new fridge. I pored a little bit of rhubarb syrup into the glass and mixed it.
