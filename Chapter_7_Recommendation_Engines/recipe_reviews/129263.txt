My husband absolutely loved this recipe!  The first words out of his mouth after he swallowed his first bite was "you should make this again!"  The only thing I changed was instead of wrapping the chicken mixture in lettuce leaves I used whole wheat tortillas and just added the lettuce to the wrap.  I definitly recommend this.

I really liked this dish - simple and quick as well. I added walnuts for crunch, and roasted garlic sauce for taste. Plus I had shrimp readily available, so I used that instead of chicken - and it was very tasty!
