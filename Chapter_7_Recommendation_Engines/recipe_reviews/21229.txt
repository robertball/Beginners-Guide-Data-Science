I was really disappointed with this recipe, it didn't set up. I ended up with applesauce.  If that is what you are looking for then it's pretty good.

This is the best apple butter, I use this recipe every year.  It makes about 8 -10 half pint jars, maybe more.  You need to cook it for at least six hours to achieve a spreadable consistency.  Not 1 1/2 hours like the recipe states.  Just use your own judgement.  Also the best apples to use would be, Jonathans, Macintosh, Honeycrisps and my new favorite  Jonagold.  This is the first year that I have used Jonagold for baking and everyone raves about everything that I have made using them.
