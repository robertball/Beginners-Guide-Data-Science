A wonderful thick smooth soup, I made it as written except for cooking my onion and 3 cloves garlic in approx a teaspoon of olive olive oil first, then adding chicken stock/broth in place of veg broth. I used a food processor to chop up my veggies, so it was super easy!! While my first load of veggies and stock was cooking, processed the zucchini and broccoli and placed in a bowl with the dried basil and pepper, then processed the spinach and placed in second bowl.  I used a spoonula for stirring soup as well as scraping my processor bowl. Seasoning was perfect, remember to use ripe veggies for full flavor!! This is a keeper, I'll be making more tomorrow! :)

I added 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro and parsley, added ham, doubled the split peas,and used chicken broth instead of veg.broth.  This was so wonderful that my family asked me to make it again and my mother-in-law and sister-in-law begged for the recipie.  YUM!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  I have recently started a path towards a vegetarian lifestyle and my husband is supportive but not that jazzed up about it.  After I made this soup he said if eating veggie was like this he was more than willing to try more recipes.  I added a small amout of sour cream to each bowl before serving it gave it a creamer texture though it was great all on its own. I also doubled the split peas like suggested.

Healthy, hearty and very very filling soup! I used 1/2 of broccoli, 1/2 cauliflower, 6 cups of fresh spinach, 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp black pepper and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I sauteed 1 onion, 2 cloves of garlic and a tsp of grated ginger with 1 tbs of butter then added in the celerys, stems of broccoli and potato until tender before adding the broth. It was a tad too thick and salty after blending (but tts bcos i put in 1 tsp of salt, not knowing tt the chicken stock was rather salty!) so i added 3/4 of water and 1/2 cup milk before bringing the pureed soup to heat. This created a nice balance of flavours. The soup had a nice lightly spicy kick to it!

This was very, very good. I used frozen spinach instead of the fresh because that was what I had.  I also left out the zucchinis because I didn't have any.  I was surprised at how creamy the soup tastes without any dairy or oil.  I used this recipe because I figured that the recipe would help disguise the fact that I had let the broccoli go well beyond it's prime - had to chop off quite a bit of the flower portion. It did.

Anyway, the soup is delicious.

Made the soup for the first time, I thought it was delicious!  I only used 1 small potato and I sauteed the onion and celery first with a little minced garlic in olive oil before adding the fat free chicken broth.  Half the batch I pureed with hand blender and the other half left as is, my husband and mother in law preferred it without being pureed, I liked it both ways.  Can also top off with a little grated parmesan cheese.  Would make again, hardest part was the chopping :)

Wow. This was super soup. So easy: just dump the first group of ingredients into a pot, simmer an hour, dump the second group, simmer again, puree. Simple. And really really tasty. Healthy, too!

I thought this was great until the step when you add the broccoli, zucchini and spinach, and then I didn't really like the taste anymore. Everyone said it was good, but I kind of think they were just being polite. I guess I will make it again, but just as a split pea and potato soup. I sauteed the onion and added some garlic at the beginning. I think that helps a lot.

I've been making this soup for years with just 2 changes -- add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the soup with the other spices.  More important, stir a dollop of plain nonfat yogurt into the soup before eating.  It makes all the difference, since the soup begs for a little tang.  I've managed to decrease overall cooking time to an hour or less by sauteeing the onion, celery, and potatoes for 5 or 10 minutes, then adding everything but the fresh spinach.  I add the spinach during the last 5 minutes, just long enough to wilt, before pureeing with an immersion blender.  My husband isn't a plain yogurt fan, but even he agrees the soup tastes better that way.

I cut the recipe down to 2 servings, sauteed the veggies in EVOO for a couple of minutes first (it helps adds flavor) & I used a half a can of Campbell's split pea soup w/ ham & bacon instead of dried split peas. I had to add quite a bit more broth than called for as the soup was pretty think. I forgot to add the basil but I thought it had great flavor & couldn't believe it was so healthy. I garnished it w/ a swiggle of sour cream & sprinkled some dried parsley on top. Thsi made a wonderful  first course to our St Patrick's day dinner...thanks so much for the recipe!

My family really liked it.  The flavor is really good!  Its a mix between a split pea, broccoli, and potato soup.   I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and some onion powder and garlic salt to taste.   Next time I might add a red pepper as well.   Oh and I didn't use zucchini because it was too expensive right now.  Still GREAT!

The flavor of this soup is excellent!  Even my toddler who hates veggies seemed to enjoy this.  Although I love garlic, I'm glad I didn't add it in - it would have altered the flavor too much.  Changes: I used homemade chicken broth and added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl.

Pretty good soup recipe. I added an extra 1/4 cup split peas and extra broccoli because I didn't have any zucchini. When I ate some the next day I added a couple drops of liquid smoke which added a nice flavor.

I would rate the original recipe at 3 stars, I added some garlic and adobo powder which majorly amped up flavors....shredded parmesan would also really improve things, but I made this for someone who can no longer eat solid foods and didn't want to add anything that would make it more difficult for her to digest/swallow.

Delicious!  I was out of bay leaves, but even without them, this soup was excellent.  I'll definitely make it again, and I may play around a bit--I'm thinking maybe a few fresh jalapeños or some mascarpone/cream cheese if I want to make it unhealthy. ;)

I love rich, hearty soups, but hate all of the fat and calories that come with them. So this soup is perfect! It has a wonderful, creamy texture and is a wonderful way to pack in some veggies. I used a combination of homemade chicken and vegetable stocks and served it with some crusty whole-grain bread. Even my three-year-old loved it!

I made this soup, as directed, but as I was pouring bits of it into the blender, my husband caught up to me and asked if he could have his portion, unblended. So, he ate it as a hearty soup and it was just as yummy as my blended portion. This is a keeper and so healthy!!

I added 1 1/2 cups of green lentils as per other reviewers...thought it was a little too much, became more thick than I had anticipated. Next time I'll try it the recipe way for a lighter soup. Otherwise worked great - added the 6 cups of veg broth - at some point during the cover and simmer part, I noticed the water was going away too fast added a cup of water. Great recipe - pleased with results...def needs some salt at the end or some 1 1/2- 2  tsps of salt close to the end when u add the pepper. Buen provecho! Thank u

Very creamy and beautiful. Made as directed, tasted very veggie. My kids weren't huge fans, but they don't like soup in general. With some french bread--yum! Happy about the nutritional content, too.

Oddly enough, this soup gives me and others in my family a burst of energy so we only eat it for lunch. It's good as written but tastes even better with freshly grated parmesan on top. It's colorful, creamy (even though it's dairy free), and nutritious. We've tried adding carrots and other vegetables we had in the refrigerator and it was still good. It's a versatile recipe that easily absorbs just about any vegetables that need to be used.

This soup is sooo very good for you.  The reciepe makes enough to feed an army.  The only drawback I could see is the texture, after you puree all that green stuff it looks ....well it looks like something you should not be eating, but it tastes great.

Very versatile, very tasty.  I used more veggies, added carrots, cauliflower, and garlic, used frozen spinach.  I did not use zucchini or bay leaves as I did not have them, and used herbes de provence and several shakes of red pepper flakes to add more flavor.  I also used homemade veggie stock and turkey stock as that's what I had.  As suggested by other reviewers, this soup was greatly improved by topping with fresh parmesan.

Very good soup!  I don't puree it anymore, as I like the texture of the veggies and such, but I do follow the recipe exactly.  It fills me up for a long time too, which is a bonus!

Delicious recipe! I love the fact that it has flexibility as far as ingredients and their quantities (but still easily keeps great texture). Also, the color green comes out really pretty, unlike the "poopy" green color of a split pea soup :)

Delicious!  I really liked this vegan soup.  The recipe is pretty forgiving (I used vegetable bouillon, not broth, only had one potato and used frozen broccoli and spinach).  I added a handful of frozen peas (because I had them). For me, the flavor was good, but needed a little enhancement, so I added garlic a little adobo and increased the basil and pepper.  Still, I think the recipe was great and will make this again!

I made two servings of this soup at my annual  St. Paddy's Day party this year for my long-time vegetarian friend, as most of the dishes I serve have meat in them.  It was delicious!  It was difficult keeping my meat eating friends and family away from it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My only tip would be to keep the soup in the blender for as long as it takes - you definitely want the end result to be super smooth.   I also made it the night before, and simply heated it in a pot before serving.  Yum.  Thanks Astrophe.

I used this as a base recipe and changed it beyond recognition. Recipes like this are best using home-made stock, and if you find it tastes a little weak/ vegetably, try adding a teaspoon of your favourite chili sauce. This is also great for lettuce that you aren't goping to get around to making a salad with, just put it in with the spinach. Noone will tell when it's blended! I spiced mine with cayenne pepper, oregano, tarragon, basil, chicken salt, and garlic stock.

The only adjustment I do to go from 4 stars which is what you see posted to 5 stars is to add some Mrs. Dash seasoning of my choice.  The exact flavor of Dash varies.

It was quite nice, we had a split pea, lentil and grain mix sitting there so we used that and it turned out good, needed a little kick some herbs maybe but other wise we all enjoyed, will definetly make it again.

I substituted canned split pea soup for the pea soup base to save time so we could have this on a week night.  Worked out beautifully.  Cooked broccoli, onions, potatoes in veg broth (enough to cover).  Added zucchini and pea soup and pepper after a few minutes.  When they had cooked through, gave it a whiz with my immersion blender ... and viola ... great soup!  My toddler even loved it!  Served it with big soft pretles for dipping.  Deffinitely a keeper!

This soup was great for feeding a mass of people quickly. I added several carrots to the mix and a dollop of hot sauce to liven it up a little, and it was great. Some people added a bit of sour cream on top, and enjoyed it that way, too. A great, versatile recipe!

For a cram in the veggie soup, this one tasted great.  I didn't have zuch or celery on hand, still enjoyed the flavor of it!  My kids call it Leprechon soup!

Unbelievable.  I made this because I just don't eat green vegetables that much, and I was going to eat a bowl to start being a little bit more healthy.  I was astounded.  This is delicious!  I anticipate making this often.

Deelish!  I didn't have spinach, so I used kale.  I added the kale when I added the broccoli, since kale is a little "coarser" than spinach.  I also omitted the basil and added some curry.  And a touch of agave nectar.

I made it with home-made chicken broth and no broccoli, and I increased the amount of split peas to 1 1/4 cups as well as the amount of celery.  This is a very very good soup.

Surprisingly delicious.  I used chicken broth and I didn't puree the mixture.  I thought it was very good to taste the different vegetables and it was such a rich, smooth flavor.  Perfect comfort food, especially when sick. I cannot rave about this enough, my boyfriend LOVED it.

My rating is more for the nutritional content this soup has, rather than for its flavor which was quite bland. Following the recipe as it was yielded a flat, slightly salty flavor. What I did was add sliced  portobello mushrooms (150 grams?), a touch of balsamic vinegar, worchestershire sauce, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. The flavor turned out more layered that way, and the Balsamic (I think) probably highlighted the taste of the greens.

Yummy, and I feel so good about eating this -- can't beat this for getting in your veggies!  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it may be a bit bland, so I added some extra basil and red pepper flakes.  I love the color -- adding the spinach at the end without cooking it really contributes to the bright green color of the soup... it's gorgeous.  Someday I will come up with a fun use for this in a themed meal... "Swamp Soup" or something.  I think you could have alot of fun with this!

We liked this soup, but it was a little lacking in flavor. When I first read the ingredients, I was expecting a more "green," earthy-tasting soup.  I think the potato is what made it more mellow than I was hoping so I think I'll cut out the potatoes next time.  I added about twice the bay, basil and black pepper. Lastly, I added about 1/3 c. of chopped fresh parsley.  I will make this again, but omit the potatoes.

wow, this soup was amazing!  my fiance didnt like it as much as i did, but he doesn't like pureed soups much.  he did say that the flavor was really good, though.  if you like pureed soups, this one is definitely a keeper!  i wish i had brought some of my frozen leftovers to work today, as i'm really craving it.  the potatoes make this soup surprisingly creamy.  i bought some half and half because i really wanted it to be creamy.  i didnt use any of it.  the soup was perfect just as it was.  really easy to make, too!  the hardest part is the chopping, but i enjoy chopping vegi's.  very healthy soup.  i'm SO glad i have leftovers!!  this may be my new favorite.

This is an amazing soup and I make it several times each winter. My rating is based on making the recipe exactly as written. For variety, I have substituted half of the spinach for kale, and there have been times I left out the celery and just added a little celery seed. Make sure to blend this soup really, really well. I use my food processor, and process in small amounts (let the soup cool so you don't get an exploding mess).

Great base — the combination of multiple green vegetables and split peas makes for a filling, healthy, easy and very lowfat soup soup. But it IS bland, as others have said.  It’s better with a lot more spice (garlic, extra basil, cayenne), but the only thing that really improves it is a couple of spoonfuls of plain regular yogurt per bowl. (I also tried lemon and Asiago as at-table condiments, but the lemon changed it too much and the cheese was just ok). I did add additional spinach for a brighter color. The only downside to the yogurt is that it makes it taste a lot richer — I used low-fat, but maybe nonfat would be better — and of course it’s no longer vegan. It’s worth playing more with the recipe, but it needs a fair bit of playing.  I made it in an instant pot, which sped things up, but I did cook the split peas etc first, then did a second, brief pressure for the broccoli and zucchini, so it still took awhile.

I made it just the way the recipe was written.  I love broccoli soup but it has a strong after taste.  With the split peas in the soup, there was no after taste.  Great taste and very easy to make.  It is my new and only broccoli soup recipe!

This was a really delicious soup.  I made it exactly as written, but without the celery. I made it because it sounded like a great way to get my 1 1/2 year old daughter to eat vegetables again after she entered her "picky stage." It worked like a charm! She just gobbled this up. Thank you!

I did everything this recipe called for except I used chicken broth and left out the zucchini (didn't have any).  Looks drab but tastes great if you like veggies.  Next time I'll add a dash of red pepper flakes for some kick.  Great way to get in your veggies.

This is a fantastic soup, very flavorful and healthy! And I like the fact that it uses a lot of different vegetables. I used chicken stock and substituted swiss chard for the spinach. Yum! Some people may be put off by the healthy green color :)

a definite restaurant-worthy soup! i added some hot sauce for a little added zing and it turn out perfect.  couple this soup with a fresh, local, herbed baguette and some sour cream or creme fraiche and voila! a great soup to make the day before a party too.

I left out the split peas and added a little Romano cheese at the end. My nine year old daughter ate it and is taking it for lunch today in her thermos. I also used red potatoes. This tasted a lot like a califlower puried soup that I make, but it took a lot longer. Thanks for the recipe...it is a good way to sneak in an abundance of veggies.

This was pretty good.  Not fantastic, but like another reviewer, I too am rating this more for nutritional value.  My husband and I felt so full after one bowl, and you just can't beat all the veggies that are packed in there.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, and I did need to add more basil (fresh and dried) and more salt at the end.  I'll most likely make this again, but remember to add a bunch more seasoning at the beginning.

This was the nastiest soup I have ever had the displeasure of making.  My family called it "Shrek Soup."  I gave the leftovers to a friend who is vegan, and her family hated it as well.  They fed it to their dog, who got sick.  This was BAAAAAAAD.  Sorry.

Very creamy and flavorful! Also freezes very well.  I loved the color and texture.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I will surely make this again.

This was very good soup, rich in color and very creamy.  On my last bowl at lunch I got it too hot, so added some fat free 1/2 & 1/2. Oh, it was fantastic! It really mellowed the flavor.

YUMMY!!! Much better than it sounds.
Both my husband and my kid (4 years old) ate every bite.
Somthing a mama can feel GREAT about serving.
