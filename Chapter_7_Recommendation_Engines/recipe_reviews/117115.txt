WOW THESE ARE GOOD!!!   After reading the reviews, I made the following changes:

First you need to double the recipe, because they really are thin and if you need them to be a bit thicker, then do the recipe 3 times for a thick batch.  I used Stop & Shop Cooking Spray with Flour, I covered the baking dish with this and I had NO PROBLEM getting the bars out of the dish.

Also even though I doubled the recipe I used 1 & 1/2 sticks of butter I did not put in the flour a little at a time, I just dumped the entire amount in, I have a Kitchen Aid mixer, worked great.  I also baked the bottom for 17 minutes. 
Inside of all white sugar, I used 1/2 white & 1/2 dark brown sugar, 5 table spoons of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I baked this for 35 minutes, it needed it.  I dusted with confectioner's sugar right away, I waited until the bars were cool before cutting.  I sprayed my knife with the cooking spray, however the I did not need it as the bars came right out with a fuss or mess.  I also cut my bars small as this is a rich tasting bar and I found myself eating and eating them, YUM :)

When i made these I doubled the recipe and baked it on a cookie sheet. i melted the buttercomletly when i made the crust it made it very easy to spread out, I used lemon juice from a bottle and i used a small amount extra and some grated lemon peel. they turned out EXCELLENT! they were gone in a day. thank you for the recipe. My family really enjoyed them.

Awesome. I made these for my boyfriend’s trio recital reception.
Really delicious. Tart, sour and very sweet. Perfect crust. 
My advice: I added actual lemon zest (~1 tsp) in addition to the lemon juice...and I used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of the stuff you keep in your refrigerator door for six months. Whenever making a crust like this, I use a kitchen object (mug, bowl, whatever) to really press the dough hard into the pan after spreading it out. A word of caution, my bars were a little messy looking when cut (they didn’t stay together very well and the edges were not smooth when cut and placed on a plate) so I just scattered fresh berries around the plate and in between the bars and it looked beautiful!

These bars were awesome : ) I grated some lemon rind as suggested by other reviewers and added extra lemon juice (fresh) as I really wanted them to taste lemony.. Also, I doubled the recipe and ended up baking it in a round pie tin as there still wasn't enough to spread out on a cookie sheet like I was hoping.. Other than that they were perfect (think they'd work great as a pie too!). I found melting the butter as also suggested really helped make it easy to spread. Loved the base, I think I'll be using it for other recipes too!

IT WAS TASTY, HOWEVER I MADE ADJUSTMENTS DOUBLING THE RECIPE AND DECREASING SUGAR. TO AVOID BARS FROM STICKING TO PAN I WOULD SPRAY OIL OR SHORTENING. THE RECIPE INDICATES PLACING ON UNGREASED PAN. PGUCCI,R.D.,M.S.

This recipe was a total flop for me. I followed the recipe to a T and the bars never raised. They were maybe a 1/4 inch thick. I will not be making this again. Sorry.

This recipe is excellent.  I think the crust is what helps these stand out from lemon bar recipes.
I thought the recipe was fine as is, except I also double it, because there was not enough for my family as they loved it.  :-)

Have made a very similar recipe to this for years and always gobbled up.   I too double crust ingredients and topping - otherwise they are too thin for our liking.  ALSO, for special treats, I ice them with cream cheese frosting flavored with lemon juice and lemon rind.   This makes a very sweet and rich square, but cutting into small pieces a sumptuous taste.   Always line the tin with your choice of lining and grease well - or use Pam.

These were delicious!  I had to bake them a bit longer than stated, but they turned out wonderfully.  The only change my husband asked me to make next time was to make a larger batch!

Very lemony! Definitely triple the recipe esp if you use a 9x13 glass dish as I did. Otherwise you need a smaller baking dish. They are not quite firm enough after cooling for an hour...maybe better after going in the fridge for a little while. I wanted to use pecans in them so I pressed chopped pecans into the batter after spreading...kind of like a pecan sandy bottom layer.

It was a little too sweet for me so next time I will cut down on the sugar. DEFINATELY DOUBLE YOUR RECIPE!! I would even say triple it! It really needs it. Go easy on the powered sugar on top as well. I think that made it too sweet. I also would add an additional TBSP toatl of 5 Tbsp if the recipe was doubled. Also added lemon rind. Other than that super easy, and looks very gourmet. Definately will be making this again.

These were very delicious! Just the perfect amount, because I usually always make too many baked goods! I added a little extra fresh lemon juice and some lemon zest.

I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe (however I did add some freshly chopped lavender leaves from my garden). This recipe is quick and easy, and the bars taste great!

These are very good but I recommend adding more lemon juice to the egg mixture to give it more of a lemony flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this as written. They tasted ok, but I think they are too thin and didn't seem to rise enough. They fell apart easily when trying to cut into neat squares.

Yummy tasting bars (a bit on the buttery side though).  I liked how easy the recipe was and the quantity, but taking them out of the loaf pan was difficult.  Next time, I'll use parchment paper and maybe use some lemon zest, too.  Overall, pretty tasty - thanks!

I absolutely loved these lemon bars!! They were so delicious and gone in one evening. I added a pinch more baking powder to the lemon mixture just to experiment and I think it may have helped the liquid mixture to rise a tad bit more. Nothing bad to say about these lucious lemon bars!

Like others here, I suggest doubling the recipe and adding the zest of a lemon to it. Extremely tasty. Lots of people ask me for this recipe.
