OMG!  This is so good.  We have been trying to eat vegetarian a few evening a weeks in an effort to be healthier.  So far most of the dishes have either failed or been so-so.  This is a keeper.  The only changes I made was to use balsamic vinegar (no wine vinegar in the pantry), add carmalized onions, roasted garlic and summer squash because I had all on hand.  Took others advice and added extra garlic and herbs.  Can't wait to make again.

Fresh spinach is nice veggie in this pasta because of the vinegar sauce.  I added the parmesan and tossed with the pasta before serving so the flavor would be in every bite.  Very tasty.

I cooked this recipie for the girls in my scholarship hall for lunch today, and all I got were rave reviews.  I reccomend adding a bit of either garlic salt or salt to the recipie to enhance the flavor of all the veggies.  Pepper works well too.  If I had made it for a small group of people, it would have been very quick.

Great to be so healthy!  To make it a full meal, I threw two chopped up chicken breasts in with the veggies.  I really felt it needed flavor, but after adding healthy amounts of lemon pepper, seasoning salt, and Oregano (don't forget to taste to make sure it's salted and peppered to your liking), I was quite pleased.  Try stirring sour cream (I use fat-free) in with your leftovers for an even yummier version.

I read all the reviews and followed the advice to add garlic, Italian seasonings, etc., and to pour off the excess liquid. We were pleased with the result.  A very good cook and friend says on her cooking blog (Banging On Pots And Pans) that you should never change a recipe and rate the recipe based on your changes, so this rating is based on the original recipe.  After the suggested changes, it becomes a 5 star.

This is a great simple pasta dish.  I did add a bit of diced onion out of habit (EVOO, garlic, onion...I was chopping and adding on rote!) and enjoyed the addition.  I'm not sure how many mushrooms I added; I purchased a *tub* of the pre sliced baby bellas.  I will double them next time.  I also added a few dashes of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  This is a super quick & easy meatless meal.  I enjoyed the combination of the red bells and zukes.  THANKS, for a great recipe, Patricia (and thanks RE user AZ for steering me towards this recipe!)!

Not so great- I used only 1/2 the box of pasta and I still didn't feel like there were enough veggies. It was dry, bland, and unexciting, even with extra additions of salt, pepper, and more garlic. Maybe it's better after it sits and all the flavors blend? I won't make this again.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.  *****  Very simple, healthy and delicious. Didn't add the parm for cooking, but provided on the side to add at the table.

This was pretty good and healthy for a simple dish. I made it exactly as written, and this was the first time I'd ever cooked with portabello mushrooms. I was a little bit surprised at a pasta dish with no sauce (other than the little bit of red wine vinegar), but it worked nicely. I hardly noticed the cheeese, though; I love cheese and wouldn't have minded a lot more here. I did find that, unlike some other recipes, reheated leftovers of this dish were not nearly as nice as fresh, so I'd recommend that it be shared and eaten right away. (I did get a little confused by a glitch in the directions; I wondered why the veggies were being sauteed "dry"; then noticed that the directions never mentioned using the olive oil that was listed in the ingredients.)

This wasn't bad but probably one of the most underwhelming recipes ever.  Pricey portobella mushrooms are better used elsewhere.

This recipe was tasty and easy to make but best of all, after I had it over the pasta, I put the left over veggies on a frozen pizza. It made that frozen pizza healthier and it tasted gourmet!

It was a splendid combination of tasty vegitagbles. A snap to make. Would be tasty with a good tomato sause, but was also good as it was. Be sure not to overdo the olive oil as it may cause excess internal gas =).

This was a very good, easy, light vegetarian dish. Like others, I also added red onion and Italian seasoning. I only had a half a box of the bowtie pasta, which ended up being plenty. It made 3 large servings, or 4 small portions.

I would give this a 6 out of 10.  There was very little flavour and it was quite watery.  I am surprised it has gotten as many reviews as it has!!  I consider myself a very healthy eater, but I had to add TONS of Parmesan to make this dish work.

I made this tonight for dinner and at first my husband thought it was weird that it didn't have a "sauce". But he tried it anyway and really liked it! It's yummy, and I like all the veggies :)

I made this without the bell pepper and with fresh spinach. I added some pepper. It was very good. Next time I'm going to add some garlic powder and it should be perfect.

Great recipe!  Like another reviewer I used balsamic vinegar instead of red.  Either would be delicious.  I also used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash.  Had white button mushrooms so used those.  This is a great base recipe for summer vegetable pasta.

I prepared as the recipe stated but also added a little onion for texture/flavor.  I wasn't very impressed by the warm dish, but I did thoroughly enjoy it as a next-day chilled pasta salad after generously adding grated fat-free parmesan.  As a main dish, it just didn't seem flavorful or saucy enough, though I did like that it consisted of healthy ingredients.

This was really good.  I made two adjustments-mostly because I had some other ingredients.  I added some crumbled bacon and a few sprigs of fresh sage. It disappeared fast in our house.

This was just OK. Not anything that I'll make again. The red wine vinegar taste was too overpowering, even though I did let it cook down in the pan. To get it to taste halfway decent, I added a lot more cheese (see photo) than what the recipe calls for and probably quadrupled the calories of it. Oh well. Dinner tonight will be better.

Very good pasta dish. I was worried that it would taste strange as I had never used vinegar on pasta but it worked very well with this combination of vegetables, particularly the red bell peppers. I added some chopped onion and the red wine vinegar I used was garlic infused. If you have plain red wine vinegar, you might crush a couple cloves of garlic and let it sit in the vinegar for an hour or so before you use it.

I rated this a 4 star only because I felt a few mods were necessary.  I added fresh rosemary from the garden, onion, and put it all atop spinach fettuccine pasta.  Was very colorful with the yellow zucchini, too.  I will make this often from now on!

Very tasty and flexible recipe.  I substituted some sliced asparagus for the zucchini because that's what I had in the house.  I also added some seasonings (onion powder and Italian seasoning).

THIS WAS VERY GOOD.  IT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ARE NORMALLY USED TO SO IT WAS A NICE CHANGE.  I DIDN'T USE FARFALLE...I USED 8OZ. OF ANGEL HAIR..WE LOVED IT.  I DID ADD SPICES LIKE OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTED (ITALIAN SEASONING AND BASIL).  THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS TO DRAIN OFF THE LIQUID FROM THE MIXTURE BEFORE YOU TOSS IT WITH THE PASTA, WHICH IS WHAT I DID.  PERFECT!

I didn't find anything special with this recipe.  If I should make this again, I think I would try adding basil, onion powder and maybe a little oregano.

As with another reviewer, my own husband saw me making this dish and thought it was weird that it didn't have a "sauce".  But despite that, we both found the dish to be quite flavourful.  I chopped the veggies in the food processor, and added red onion and a tomato chopped by hand.  I also added cracked black pepper.  I am making an effort to eat vegetarian a few days per week for health reasons, and this receipe will definely remain on my radar.  My only complaint is that one would have to add a ton of parmesan cheese for it to make an impact.

I loved the premise of this recipe, but I did end up changing it a bit to fit what we had on hand. Cooked veggies in EVOO and crushed garlic, then added yellow squash and diced onion, plus salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder and extra red wine vinegar at the end.  Substituted spaghetti squash instead of pasta and served separately (instead of adding pasta to veggies in skillet). Added shrimp (sauteed separately and added to skillet at the end). Because of my changes, I will rate this the same as the recipe's current rating, which is 4 stars. We really did love it as prepared, though.

The vinegar gives this dish a sour taste, not very pleasant.

It was ok... A little bit too much red wine vinegar taste for me. Admittedly though, I didn't include zucchini since I didn't have any on hand.

Didn't have any zucchini - which would have made it better.  But I did add garlic salt, rosemary, and basil as it was cooking.

Really tasty.
