I used it to fill and cover Dark Chocolate Cake I and it was an instant hit!  I also used a splash of coffee rather than the coffee powder as we had some sitting in the jug going cold.  The coffee really intensifies the chocolate.

I'll rate this four stars, even while I had some disappointment with this recipe.  First, and most important, the coffee flavor is fairly potent and because it's so prominent, I believe it should be mentioned in the recipe's title or you're in for a big surprise.  In other words, the coffee in this recipe is more than just enough to intensify the chocolate flavor!  Second, the frosting is only mildly chocolate and very light in color.  If you want a deeper chocolate frosting, both in color and flavor, check out "Rich Chocolate Frosting," also from this site.  So it wasn't what I wanted or expected, being light in chocolate flavor and heavy in coffee flavor, but it was still very good.  Light, creamy, fluffy, and piped nicely.  Perhaps if this was named more aptly, like "Mocha Buttercream," I might have been inclined to rate this higher.

I did add butter as this was to frost a cake and another review suggested that.

This frosting was DELICIOUS on my chocolate cake!!  A hit all the way around.

Excellent recipe but to frost a cake you need to double it.

I added a little more butter because we used it to frost a cake.  The family loved it, but it was a bit sweet for my taste.  Great with white cake.

Yummy frosting, covered 9 in round cake.  I didn't put coffee crystals so I used 1/4 c. cocoa.  I dumped it all in the middle top of cake and it spread out and set up fast.

Very nice. Sweet with the just the right taste of chocolate.  Did not add the coffee as I did not have any instant granules.
Was a little soft, but maybe it was because I cut the recipe in half.  Was perfect for 9x5 vegan cake.
Thank you for sharing.

Instead of using 1/4 cuper butter i used 6 tbsp. since thats all i had left. so i just used it all. and it came out perfect! i used these on my sugar cookies so delicious! Also, i didnt use the coffee granules, just cocoa powder. once again, very delicious. the frosting will become thicker if you let it sit for about 10 minutes or so. great recipe!

I added 3 times as much sugar to thicken it up because it was so soupy, but nothing was thickening it up, so I had to toss it out.

The frosting was good, overall, but I think that the butter needs to simmer at minimum heat.

This is a wonderfully moist and flavorful chocolate frosting! I used it on Grandpop's Chocolate cake; Chocolate and coffee are the best dessert duo!

Thanks for the recipe, I am addicted to cream cheese, so I added about 2 tbsp, but it's delicious without it.
