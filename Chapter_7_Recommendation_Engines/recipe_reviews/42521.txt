My family loved this!  It is an everyone pleaser!  For a bit of a differet take on this, add your brand of 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend cheese as a substitue for the American Cheese and a bit of garlic and basil to your taste.  You could also substitute cooked bacon(crumbled)in place of the ham (If using bacon and/or garlic salt vs fresh garlic, reduce or delete salt from the original recipe) You could also use Italian green beans in place of the peas. My family loved this one too.  Thanks for this great recipe. It is so versitile P.S.  Please use the bread crumbs   ??? Tomatoes.  Any take?

This was great.  I put more ham and noodles than the recipe called for and when I mixed it up it was a bit dry.  So I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also did not add the breadcrumbs.

Great recipe.  I did use a blend of American, Cheddar and a bit of Swiss cheese.  I think it rounded out the taste of the sauce beautifully.  I also sprinkled on the bread crumbs without using butter--it's an easy way to cut back the fat.  I also cut back the fat by using Smart Balance spread and 1% milk.  Feel free to experiment with different pastas as well.  My kids like it with a standard penne.  Thanks for this contribution--we loved it!

This went over very well with my family (2 kids and a hubby).  Minor changes I made: used shredded sharp cheddar instead of processed cheese, drizzled the remaining butter over the bread crumb/parsley mix instead of mixing the butter in with it, and used canned peas instead of frozen.  Also, the type of "medium noodles" wasn't specified in the recipe, so I used medium egg noodles.  I didn't add extra fluid as others suggested, and it came out just hot-dishy enough.  Almost all of it got eaten at dinner, and my hubby took the rest to work with him the next day.  Definitely a good "simple" way to use left-over Holiday ham.

I tried to stay true to the original dish, but had to change a few things based on what I had in the house. I wasn't sure if it was 1 1/2 cups cooked or to measure the noodles before cooking. So, I measured and then cooked them. I left out the salt, because I thought it was plenty between the ham and cheese. I started making it before I realized I didn't have frozen peas, so I used cooked green beans. And, I don't care for bread crumbs, so I used buttered crushed Ritz type crackers. I had some leftover American cheese I didn't know what to do with and this worked good for a quick meal to use it up.

Very yummy recipe! I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of American, and topped with corn flakes cereal. I might add some black pepper next time.

I actually really liked this! I did put some chicken in it, and I think the chicken and the peas go great together! If I make this again, I would might add a little bit more cheese to the mixture. But other than that, I really liked it!

This recipe was good but wouldn't have been as cheesy without my additions.  I doubled the recipe and used cheddar cheese for the sauce and it was lacking in the cheesy flavor I was looking for.  So I added 1 cup of low fat sour cream and 3 packets of dry cheese mix from the macaroni and cheese boxes (those are the noodles I used).  I also topped the top with cheddar french fried onions and subbed the peas for a green bean (frozen) and corn (frozen) combo.  I ended up needing more sauce because I doubled the veggies and used 3 cups of uncooked noodles, which I cooked and drained (the recipe didn't seem clear to me on that).  I also added black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Overall the result was great but I did make quite a few minor changes.

good and simple.  I made homemade bread crumbs by cutting up cubes of bread, toasting them in the oven, spraying with oil, tossing them with parsley, marjoram, and thyme and parmesan and baking again for a few minutes...this added some needed flavor to the dish....made it more savory.

My go-to recipe for leftover ham adds egg noodles, peas and cream of mushroom soup with milk.  My family doesn't really care for it, so I thought this recipe would be a good compromise.  It was really good!  

I used a 2 qt casserole because it was the smallest I had so I doubled the topping.  That was a mistake, but my mistake.  I also used Italian bread crumbs and the taste was not ideal.  I will use plain breadcrumbs and parsley next time, as instructed!

I used shredded cheddar cheese for the cheese because that is what I had on hand.  I also used Ronzoni Smart Pasta to sneak in some extra nutrition. 

I will make it again next time I have leftover ham, but next time I will follow the instruction for the topping.  :)

My husband loved this recipe!  If you are looking for something to use leftover ham this is the one.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream to make it even tastier.

Great recipe.  Easy to whip up with a moment's notice.  I used macaroni pasta.  Omitted the salt since ham is already so salty.  Used sharp cheddar instead of processed American cheese.  Lastly, crushed saltines rather than using bread crumbs.  Thanks!

I used canned peas, shredded cheddar cheese and more ham than it called for. It was dry in the sense that it wasnt soupy, but it was full of flavor so I didnt mind it at all. I loved it that way and healthier.  I also omitted the bread crumbs.  Just before putting in the oven I topped with Parsley, garlic salt and minced green onions. Baked as directed. Then 3 mins b4 done I put on French's Fried Onions. Turned out perfect and even my kids had 2 helpings. It was great and light on the stomach.

Quite yummy. Was looking for a way to use the last of a ham leftover from Sunday dinner. Made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Used a whole bag of frozen mixed veggies in place of the peas, also added some diced celery and garlic to the mix. Used egg noodles and loved the topping. It was super quick and easy to make and my kids ranging from toddler to teenager loved it. Will definitely make again!

I used low-fat milk and low-fat shredded cheese to make it a bit healthier, and left out the salt as the ham adds enough salt. It was very tasty, the kids liked it, but my husband added chopped salami and some chilli sauce to his for a bit more kick.

Well all I had was either spaghetti noodles or lasagna! So I broke up the lasagna for a different shape. I also added sliced American and shredded extra sharp cheddar and a little Muenster! A sprinkling of pepper and it turned out great! Good recipe for leftover ham definitely!

I didn't understand if it's 1 1/2 C measured dry noodles cooked or 1 1/2 C cooked noodles. So, I put in 2 C & that worked out well. Used Cheddar cheese instead of American & plain Panko breadcrumbs. This was easy & delicious. Will be making again soon.

A great and simple way to use up ham leftovers!  I substituted shredded sharp cheddar for the American cheese and I used crumbled round crackers with melted butter for a topping instead of the bread crumbs.  I was going to saute some onions, but forgot.  It was great without them, anyway.  Will definitely make again!

Was a nice change from our usual with leftover ham. My only complaint is that there was not enough cheese sauce. I cooked some chopped onions add the ham and peas to the onions before adding them to the sauce. I took the advice of another reviewer and added some sour cream. It was tasty just a little dry. Will make again.

I found this to be pretty good and the family all enjoyed it.  I used a combination of shredded 2% sharp cheddar and fat free American cheese, plus skim milk for the sauce, and whole wheat noodles to make it a little bit heathier.  It was a tad salty, so I could have left off the salt and it would have been fine.  I left off the topping also and just sprinkled some paprika on the top for color.

Fast recipe the whole family enjoyed!  Next time I might use all cheddar instead of American.

I doubled the recipe and added real cheddar cheese instead of processed American. Very good!

I thought this was OK, and has great potential with additions (some onion or garlic powder, maybe; some extra cheese, and Parmesan added to topping). I agree that the salt can be omitted, there's enough sodium content in the ham and cheese for me. Requires a lot of dishes to prepare. I also recommend using a deep casserole dish. I used a flat one and it came out a bit dry.
