Many pork chop recipes I've tried end up with dry chops but not this one.  They weren't dry and I loved the taste, especially with the dried apricots (I added the whole bag!).

I don't eat pork, but I made this for my Mum, she said it was very good.  Although I didn't have apricot nectar I disolved some apricot preserve in some hot water and made a thick syrup.  It worked quite well, the sauce had a good texture.

Very tangylicious! On the sweet side so do not skip or skimp on the chix bouillion or the oh-so essential shallots to balance out the flavor. I used a non-descript white this time around but I think a fuller-bodied sherry would be a better choice for next time. I'd bet the sauce would be spectacular over a side of julienned carrots as well.

The combination of maple and apricot with the pork is absolutely fabulous.  I am not a fan of "the other white meat" but my husband is so I'm always trying to find recipes so I can enjoy it.  I plan on trying this sauce with chicken, too, I'm sure it will be great.  In all honesty, I skipped the chicken broth & sherry... The combination of the shallots, maple syrup (make sure you get goo maple, not the kind your kids put on their pancakes) and apricot nectar/preserves is wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty and not a lot of work. I used home-canned apricot puree instead of the nectar.
