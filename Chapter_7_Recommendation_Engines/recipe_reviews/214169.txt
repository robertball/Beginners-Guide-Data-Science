Flavor is good better on veggies than on crackers I think. Mouth feel wasn't what I had hoped for... Next time I might add an avocado and some red pepper flakes to cut the acid of the capers and spice it up a bit. I could also see blending in 8 oz of cream cheese.... hummmm.... As is it's just ok for me but a great base starter for something different and unique. I'm sure I'll play around with this one and see if it will fit on my table sometime in the future.
