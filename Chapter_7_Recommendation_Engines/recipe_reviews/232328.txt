Made this last night, and my family and I loved it!  I added taco seasoning to the meat, along with a little garlic salt, onion powder, and cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Also, I mixed the Rotel into the meat mixture instead of layering it on top.  It did come out a bit soupy because I think I used too much Velveeta, but it was still yummy, and I will definitely make it again.

Not bad at all.  Kids loved it.  The only change I made was adding taco seasoning to the meat.  I will make this again!  Was easy to make early in the day, so it was ready to cook when they were hungry.

So this rating is based on a modified version, which I'll post below. I used the original as a springboard and went from there. Whole family ended up liking it.

cook 1 lb beef, 1 onion (diced), and taco seasoning
(then add)
15 oz can corn (drained), 15 oz can black beans (drained), 28 oz diced tomatoes with seasonings, 10 oz cheddar cheese soup
(separate layer)
2 cups rice cooked with 1 tbsp adobo seasoning added
(then)
layer with tortillas, top with shredded cheese before baking in the oven.

I used 2lbs of ground beef sautéed with one onion. I added a can of rotel to the sautéed mixture along with the cheese and soup. I then added chili powder and garlic. I recommend using extra tortillas and less velveeta cheese. Would make a great appetizer with tortilla chips!

Very good. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and taco seasoning to the beef and onions. For less spice of the rotel (my kids don't care for spicy stuff) I added sour cream to them. And I also topped with cheddar cheese.

overall it was a very good recipe. I'll make it again for sure.

Obviously this isn't the most nutritious recipe, though it tastes great! I made some changes to try to use less red meat and add some veggies. I halved the ground beef and used a can of black beans. I diced onion, green pepper, and mushrooms, adding those after browning the beef. Then instead of using a packet of taco seasoning, I added cumin, paprika, chilli powder, garlic powder, black pepper and red pepper flakes to taste. This mixture of spices has no salt, as the cheese has plenty. Next time I think I will also half the cheese. I agree with the suggestion to use flour tortillas.

As I was preparing the dish, I realized that, other than the royal, there was absolutely no spices in this dish that would give it a Mexican flavor. The ingredients alone do not make this dish worthy of the name “enchilada”. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I went completely off the grid with it. I sautéed an onion with the ground beef. I added a ton of chili powder, cilantro, and cumin, and red pepper flakes for more heat. Also, 1 can of Rotel is laughable unless you want only a minimal amount of tomatoes per layer. Without any of the spices, it’s pretty much cheeseburger corn tortilla bake.

I found the recipe to have lack of season so I cooked up my beef like taco meat and then also added taco cheese to the top. Still very bland and I think the tortilla layers need to be doubled in thickness.

It was great! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added taco seasoning. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a hit with the entire family!

We made this tonight and it turned out very good! We didn’t make any changes to the recipe, but I think next time we might add some black beans or maybe use taco seasoning like some other reviews have said. Even with no changes my family still very much enjoyed this meal and we most likely will make this again!

While fixing this I noticed that there was next to no seasoning for this dish, so I added taco seasoning to the mixture while browning the meat.  I'm also not a fan of Velveeta Cheese so used a Mexican Blend of Cheese.  It was alright, but would have liked more of a flavor explosion considering what  the dish was.

The flavors were ok. I didn't realize how much I really don't like the taste of velveeta cheese. But the real issues was the corn tortillas get soft and mushy and the whole dish really feels like your eating the inside of a burrito. It desperately needs a crunch factor. I'm thinking our leftovers will be served in taco shells tonight.

I loved this!! I added taco seasoning and the Rotel to the meat mix as well, and then I did add Mexican shredded cheese on top in the last minutes in the oven just to make it extra cheesy, so good! Even my 1 yr old liked this!

My husband and kids absolutely LOVED this recipe. They devoured it. Me however, I just liked it. But, I am not a huge fan of velveeta cheese.  I think I'll try making with chips instead of tortillas. I think it'd give it a nice crunch.  Great for a family meal! I'll be making this again.

Well this a recipe with husband's approval not mine. Unfortunately, to please him, I had to use flour tortillas...I liked that it was not soupy but still the texture of the flour tortilla was not of my likeness. I am very sure I would have loved this recipe with corn tortillas but hubby does not like them....bummer! Anyways, I still did what others suggest: add a bit of spice or taco seasoning. In my case, I added garlic powder and cumin. The taste was indeed good it is just me who did not like it
