Very flavorful, very easy to prepare.  If you are a "blue cheese" person, you will love this recipe.  If anyone in your group is not, I probably would not make prepare this as the blue cheese is extremely prominent in the flavor profile.    Recommendations to improve this recipe (while staying true to the mega-blue cheese flavor" is as follows.  Prepare exactly as in recipe but add this. In a pan with a pat of butter, toast until golden brown 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs. Cool bread crumbs then add to meat/cheese mixture.  Also, add one egg white to meat/cheese/bread mixture as binder.  This recipe would also be excellent with Parmesan Regianno substituting for blue cheese.

Cook the sausage before stuffing in the mushrooms to reduce the grease and oven time is cut to about 20 to 25 minutes. Otherwise a great recpe

DD made this recipe today. We both love sausage and blue cheese, but were disappointed in the flavor. Will not be making this recipe again.

These are so flavorful! Everyone loved them.  I trippled the filling because I used mini portobello mushrooms.  Next time I am going to try soaking the mushrooms in the vineger & worcestershire sauce because the filing was so flavorful the mushrooms felt a little lacking on the thicker parts.

Made this recipe today.  I love sausage and blue cheese is a favorite.  My only change was I made a half of batch.  I was very disappointed.  I found the stuffing was salty and did not stay together.  I won't be making these again.
