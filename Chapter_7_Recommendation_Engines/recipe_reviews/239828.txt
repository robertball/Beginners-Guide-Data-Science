I made this and was very good except next time make hall of the sauce. Was to much for one head of cauliflower.

I grew up eating CC in the UK, and I occasionally get a hankering for it. This recipe is just ok imo. I found the sauce to be a little on the thick side, and not nearly cheesy enough. Also, there really wasn't enough of it to smother a decent-sized head of cauli. I added more milk and extra sharp Cheddar, and also a bit of Coleman's mustard. Didn't have a lot of breadcrumbs so I made up the difference with Panko - worked well. Served it with British-style sausages. Fab!

This resulted in a really thick and rather flavorless cheese sauce. Next time I will add extra cheese and thin a bit with milk. A good base for cheese sauce.
