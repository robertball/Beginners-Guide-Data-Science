I made this for my friend who loves mushrooms.  It is a wonderful tart but boy it seemed like a lot of work.  I say that because I've been using frozen pie crusts for a couple of years.  That's what happens when you get to 76 year old.  I've been cured - I will be making this again.  Loved it.  The remainder of the tart was taken home by my friend.
