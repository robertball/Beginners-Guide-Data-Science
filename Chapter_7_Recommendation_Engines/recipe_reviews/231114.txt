Excellent! I had to use what I had on hand which included regular butter, celery, red bell pepper (we don't like the green) and regular salt. All other ingredients were the same. Served over blackened redfish. It was delicious!

I went with cooking option #2, added shrimp along with my crawfish tails, a few drops of liquid smoke with the seafood in lieu of smoked salt, and a dollop of coconut oil instead of the crawfish fat. 
Hit it with a shot of pepper sauce and a dash of "Slap Yo Mama" and you have a great, rather easy dish that tastes wonderful! It's even better then next day, spooned over an omelette.
