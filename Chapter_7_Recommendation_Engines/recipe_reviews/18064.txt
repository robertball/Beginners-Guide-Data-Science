I think this recipe was good, but I think it needed more directions.  You don't fry the shell per say... you place it in the pan with oil for a short time until it's plyable and easy to fold.  I only had mine in for 7-10 seconds on each side.  Plus I added taco seasoning to the beef just like if you were making tacos... I don't think this would have had near enough flavor if I wouldn't have done that... it would have been bland, especially since the recipe doesn't call for any other spices, onions, or garlic.  But in the end, with some minor changes it turned out good and everyone liked it!

Mmm, Mmmm Good!  Smells awesome, too!  Just a few changes to make it even better.  Definately use corn tortillas (dipped in hot oil so they will roll without cracking) instead of flour.  I make the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site.  What a difference homemade makes, and it takes just minutes.  Finally, add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat.  I think this recipe is waayy to bland without.  I even add a small pinch of crushed red pepper and a few diced tomatoes.  Top with sour cream, black olives and shredded lettuce for an authentic mexican enchilada!  Both my parents and my husband give two thumbs up on this recipe, as well.  THanks Donna :-)

This was a good basic recipe.  To create a more authentic taste, I used one onion, chopped small, and 6 cloves of garlic, shredded, and sweated those down with a little butter first.  I reserved that while the meat browned.  I added those two mixtures together and just enough canned red enchilada sauce to moisten the meat up real well...along with a little onion powder, granulated garlic, chili powder, mexican oregano, red pepper flakes, minced chilies (canned), and some spanish paprika.  After that simmered for a few minutes I assembled the enchiladas using corn tortillas.  Instead of using the red enchilada sauce solo on top, I used one can of that mixed with about a half a can of Wolf Brand chili (best if you heat that up to thin it out for easy spreading).  Then cheese was added to the top and baked.  I will tell you, this gave it such a great authentic flavor, like the chili-gravy you find in some good mexican restaurants.  Thanks for the head-start, now I just keep thinking of ways to rev it up and make it a little different each time.  I have a strickly meat-and-potatoes husband and 3 kids that are picky eaters...they ask for this at least once a week!  Ole!!

Have made these three times now, as written, and have made the Ten-Minute Enchilada Sauce, found on this site, ahead of time. You'll need a minimum of 3 cups of sauce for a 9 x 13 casserole dish, for 6 enchiladas. Spread a layer of the sauce on the bottom of the dish before inserting the enchiladas, to prevent them from sticking. Don't leave more than an inch of the ends of the enchiladas uncovered by sauce, because exposed areas will become crispy.

ooooo!  These are YUMMY!  Forget the canned sauce, use *Red Enchilada Sauce* also from this site--the 2 cups it makes is just right for this recipe.  It is made with stuff on hand and beats the canned junk for taste.  I also used only 1lb of turkey and had plenty.  My 5 year-old devoured this (even though he thought there were too many *yunions*) They only thing I think I will change the next time I make them (soon) will be to add maybe 1/4c of the red sauce to the meat mixture.  I also used sharp cheddar, but that is merely a personal preference.

This recipe was very good but took other reviewers advice and added some taco seasoning to meat.  Also only used 1/2 onion with beef mixture & used the other half with sauce (used red enchilada sauce from this website instead of canned sauce).  Another suggestion that makes the enchiladas extra creamy is to add a sliver of cream cheese to each enchilada before rolling it up. YUM!

I've been making enchiladas similar to these a long time.  The hint I would offer is that you place the tortillas in a damp kitchen towel, place in microwave oven and heat for approx. 1 to 1 1/2 min.  Much easier than method recommended and much more figure flattering!

I changed this quite a bit...chili powder, salt and cayenne.  As previous person suggested in her review, I used the red enchilada sauce from this site also, instead of canned--what a difference that makes.  I also added cheese and 1/2 cup sauce to filling.  Pretty tasty indeed!

This is a good recipe, I would say follow the advice of people adding seasoning to the meat and onions.
However, being a mexican and eating enchiladas my whole life long and living right next to Mexico. 
I have NEVER EVER had enchiladas made with flour tortillas no one makes them like that in fact the thought is kind of gross. 
If you make this recipe use corn tortillas I'm sure it will taste so much better, that's how real authentic enchiladas are made with CORN tortillas.

Five stars with improvements; two stars without. When heating the tortillas, I do not use ANY oil, I just "warm" them in a non-stick pan if they are  flour, if they are corn tortillas I just wrap them in a clean dish towel and nuke them for a minute till pliable. I used corn tortillas.  I used a small can of chopped green chilies and a small can of sliced black olives and a packet of taco seasoning with 1/2 cup water to my ground beef as it was browning. I also added about a cup of the enchilada sauce to the meat before filling the tortillas.  They turned out very well.

I only had a pound of ground turkey so I cut the recipe in half. 
(I still came out with 11 corn tortillas, enough to fill a 9 X 13.) 
I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic, taco seasoning and a small can of green chiles. I also poured half a can of green chile enchilada sauce into the meat mixture and poured the rest into the bottom of the casserole dish and over the enchiladas. 
VERY TASTY!!!

As others have written this is a good basic recipe and like them I also have added extra ingredients. To the cooked beef and onions I add low sodium taco seasoning,chopped green peppers,extra cumin, garlic and spicy chili powder. I add mashed, bottled jalapenos to regular enchilada sauce,warm the flour tortilla shells wrapped in film for 30 seconds in the micro. I oil a casserole with 1tbsp canola oil,then some enchilada sauce,add enchiladas.(I have found adding only sauce can still make enchiladas stick) After 10 mins in a 375 oven,liberally top with a 3 cheese medley (jalapeno,cheddar, mozzarella,)return to oven for 10 mins.  Let stand for a few mins then serve with sour cream etc.

I was raised in So. California and have had plenty of "authentic" style enchiladas. Of course this is not that authentic. But I love it. My Irish mom made it and called it Gringo style. I prefer the flour tortillas over the corn. I also put minced garlic, 1 small can of chopped mild green chilis cooked with 1 pound of lean ground beef and onion. I mix sharp cheddar cheese and sauce inside with meat mixture, used burrito size flour tortillas. It made 7 large enchiladas. I put sliced olives on top of the cheese before baking. Yum!

My enchilada recipe is similar- but I add rice and sometimes refried beans in each enchilada.  I also use only one pound of hamburger, a medium size onion and cheddar and jack cheese. For those having problems with bland meat: I mix a half of a can of red enchilada sauce (i use old el paso) in with the beef.  I then cover the enchiladas with 2 cans of green enchilada sauce (same brand) and the rest of the red.  I garnish with the usual taco toppings. My friends and family love this dish and will come over just for leftovers if they hear I've made it.

These were good, need some added spice for our taste. Next time I would highly season the meat. I like to combine cheddar and white american cheese. The white american really adds something to tacos and enchiladas

Basic recipe, but use corn with beef enchiladas and flour with chicken enchiladas, much better and adding taco seasoning to your beef works in a pinch ( Tastier to me )

Very Tasty! I improvised like the others. Added fajita seasoning to the meat, 4 cloves diced garlic and added some sauce and cheese in each wrap. Garnished the top with green chilis and diced olives and topped each serving with shredded lettuce and sour cream. A side of mexican rice topped it all off. Turned out great!

Soooooooo yummy.  I also used corn tortillas and used the recipe for the Red Enchilada Sauce (which was super easy and definitely worth it).  My husband's exact words were "WOW".  It really felt like we had ordered authentic Mexican food and brought it home.  I can't wait to make it again!

I kicked it up a notch by adding peppers and onions and cilantro and taco seasoning to the meat.  It had great flavor! The next day even better.  I will assemble them a day ahead, when you get in from work just pop in the oven.

My son DEVOURED these enchiladas, and my husband declared them fantastic. I had to use ground pork instead of beef, and substituted a blend of Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses instead of just cheddar. I also used "Mrs. Espy's Enchilada Sauce" from this site instead of canned. This is the beef enchilada recipe I will use from now on. Thank-you!

Delicious! If it weren't so unhealthy (no judgement against the chef submitting the recipe- far from it) I would eat it every week.

This is a fantastic base recipe. I used the suggestions from others and put in a packet of taco seasoning (hot and spicy), minced garlic, salt and pepper and some of the enchilada sauce. We stuck with the flour tortillas as it was our preference and topped it with sharp cheddar and chopped green chilies. It was a successful and very filling dinner. I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. :)

Very nice recipe. I used corn tortillas and did not fry them. No need for extra fat and calories. I added a bit more seasoning to give it that little bite. This is a great recipe to play with.

This is a good, basic, enchilada recipe. I added Spanish rice to the enchiladas, subbed White Queso cheese for Colby, drained the fat from the beef then added a can of tomato soup to the meat with the seasonings. No enchilada sauce needed but I did use some salsa afterwards. Customize and experiment -- this recipe is good for that!

Very good recipe! I love this recipe because it is a very quick and easy way to make enchiladas. And it is a plus that it doesn't require an extravagant amount of ingredients. I thought it was very good and I added olives on top and mixed taco seasoning in with the meat when I cooked it. I would recommend this recipe to all of my friends!

Didn't fry them, softened them in the microwave and just rolled up to save calories. Used Ground turkey and speedy enchilada sauce (on site)GREAT

These were excellent. My boyfriend claims them to be the best enchiladas he's ever had. I used the "ten minute enchilada sauce" from this site for the enchilada sauce. I strongly recommend making this recipe with that sauce. It was so good. Thanks!

Wow!  Let's start by saying this recipe makes alot of enchiladas!  A good basic recipe, but the meat filling definitely leaves something to be desired.  I doctored with fresh garlic, cumin, chili powder, and cayene pepper.  I also added a couple of scoops of the salsa and a 4 oz can of chopped chilis.  Next time I plan to use corn tortillas (store was out today), and add some chopped spinach to the meat mixture.  Oh, and I used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site, wonderful!  Thanks previous reviewers, and thanks for a nice recipe submission.

These are great!I did spice it up a bit as some suggested, which I think it needs. To the ground beef I added 1 package taco seasoning and a lot of garlic. On top I put 1 small can of chiles. And the salsa I used was Med. instead of mild. My family LOVED them, thanks!

I asked my daughter to please fetch me an enchilada recipe off of the site and this is what she gave me. As written, this would have been very bland. I browned ground turkey and then added chili powder, cumin, garlic and onion powders and a can of refried beans. With these additions and homemade enchilada sauce, the dish was fabulous! Thanks Donna, for a really good start!

This recipe is very good. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour.  Soften them in hot oil for about 10 seconds before adding the meat and cheese mixture. Other changes I made were adding taco seasoning to the meat, used a combination of colby and monterey jack cheese and also used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe that other reviewers suggested. My husband thought this tasted as good or better than his favorite mexican restaurant.

I took advice from someone else's review and used the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe in place of the canned enchilada sauce, YUMM!! It took a total of 30 minutes to prepare and was done within the 30 minutes suggested to cook. My family loved it, my 7 year old asked me to make it all the time and even my picky 'meat and potatoes' husband ate seconds. You gotta try it!

Yum Yum Yum. These enchiladas combined with Mrs Espy's Enchilada Sauce(allrecipes.com)was delicious. I used corn tortillas instead of flour and replaced canned sauce with homemade. My husband kept commenting how good they were with every bite.  Will make again and again.

This is a great basic recipe that you can dress up according to you and your families taste.  I add the spices of our choice (garlic, onion powder, a bit of spanish paprika, green chili powder and whatever else happens to catch my attention in the spice drawer).  Yellow corn tortillas are our favorite and popping them in HOT oil for a few seconds makes them rollable and gives a much more authentic taste.  When I'm in a hurry, instead of rolling each enchilada I will layer them, alternating each layer with the meat mixture and finishing off with homemade green chili sauce, Mexican blend shredded cheese and some diced onion (big onion fans in our house!).  Before serving, a fried egg is placed on top of the "stack" and then a garnish of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, a dab of sour cream and a side of homemade guacamole.  These are always a big hit and if we have leftovers they freeze well. Note:  I make these with ground beef or Elk "hamburger", YUM!)

I used one pound shredded beef that I made last month. (I'm working on cleaning out my freezer and save money by using what I have on hand.) I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, used a homemade enchilada sauce, 2% Colby cheese, low-carb tortillas and I warmed the tortillas in a non-stick skillet without oil to cut down on calories/fat. To make them a little more filling, I used a little homemade mexican rice that I had from last night. Looks so pretty, I'm sad I won't be having any of it. Half a recipe made six large enchiladas, more than enough for my ravenous husband and two boys. GREAT recipe using on hand ingredients and made even better using homemade ingredients when possible.

My first enchiladas ever, and they were tasty!  Heating the tortillas first is KEY (my first 2, unheated, seemed pliable initially, but then cracked after they were in the dish.)  But, you don't have to use oil, just throw the tortilla in a hot pan for ~10 seconds each side.  My small recipe mods were: used 10-minute enchilada sauce instead of canned (easy!), and added a little bit of taco seasoning to the meat (not a lot, maybe a tablespoon or 2.)  I was able to get 8 enchiladas in my 9x13 dish, but that was it.  Maybe I wasn't rolling them tight enough?  We therefore had a lot of meat leftover, which made great nachos the next night.

Good base easily made into a delicious dish. I added a couple cloves of garlic while browning the meat, seasoned the meat with cumin, chili powder, and crushed red pepper, and added a can of diced green chilies to the meat. Thanks :)

Excellent and easy, everyone in the family loved it!. My son worked at a Mexican restaurant for years and gave me some tips...Before stuffing the enchiladas, mix the meat and cheese together(we added a lot extra cheese), mix in some salsa and some enchilada sauce too then stuff the enchiladas. Cover with sauce and bake as directed.

Very good basic recipe.  I add minced garlic and use taco seasoning when browning the meat.  I also put some of the enchilada sauce in a frying pan, bring to a low boil and dip the tortillas in that (using tongs) rather than frying in oil.

I have been using this recipe for years. I add taco seasoning to the meat. The tortillas warm well without using any oil in the skillet. Before you fill the tortillas coat both sides in the enchilada sauce to keep them from drying out while baking. Add shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese before you bake. You only need to bake the enchiladas 25-30 minutes if you bake them immediately.

As it is, this tastes nothing like enchiladas.  I should have known, but was fooled by the 4 stars rating.  This recipe needs chilies, cumin, cilantro, red pepper, some paprika, the usual seasoning in mexican food. A packet of Taco Seasoning will do the trick if you don't have any of these on hand. Otherwise it is very bland even with the enchilada sauce.  I recommend cooking the meat, draining if necessary, and then adding the spices right before you package the enchiladas

I've always thought of enchiladas as being made with corn tortillas so that's what I did.  I'm glad that I took the advice of others and added an envelope of taco seasoning otherwise this would've been low on flavour.  Next time I would use a spicier taco seasoning and spicier enchilada sauce as it was still a bit bland for my liking.  I had also added WAY more garlic powder than the 1/8 tsp garlic salt suggested here.

I liked that this recipe was simple, but after reading reviews knew I had to add to it. I only used 1 lb. ground beef. I used half a small can of green chopped chiles 8 corn tortillas and 2 cans of enchilada sauce--one mixed in with the beef, and the other for dipping tortillas in, with a bit leftover for the top.  Topped with plenty of shredded cheese. Whole family loved 'em.

I made this as written and it was very bland.  I'm giving 4 stars because it's easily spiced up.  Second time I made it:  to the beef and onions I added 1 minced garlic clove and fajita seasoning (taco seasoning would've worked as well).  Before filling shells, I added about 1/4 cup enchilada sauce to meat mixture.  I then separated the meat into 2 portions and added a small can of green chiles to one of the portions to spice it up for my husband and myself.  I also used corn tortillas for us, but used flour for the kids.  Both turned out well.  To make the shells easy to roll, I heated a nonstick skillet on med. high heat and warmed each shell a few seconds on each side or until it loosened up.  I would quickly stuff the warmed shell while the next shell was heating.  Very simple.  Spicing this up a little made a huge difference!  I served this with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and refried beans.  An easy and complete meal!

I've added taco seasoning to the meat because i think this would have been bland without it. Other than that, a good and quick recipe: I will make again!

My husband really liked these. I ommitted the onion, as my husband doesn't like it. I added taco seasoning as others have suggested. I think next time I might add chili powder & cumin. I used a mixture of Colby & Montery Jack cheese. My husband liked them fine with flour toritllas but others have suggested corn. I also made the Red Enchilada Sauce on this site that everyone recommeded. I think next time I will cut the recipe in half as it was too much for my husband & I.

A good basic enchilada recipe, these are nothing fancy, but they are filling.  I cut the recipe in half and had more than enough for four people.  I added green pepper, garlic, chili powder and cumin to the filling.  They were quick to make and easy to assemble.  I did not fry my tortillas in the oil, but had no trouble assembling the dish.  I served with refried beans and spanish rice.

I reduced this recipe to four servings and used six ten inch flour tortillas.  I also added taco seasoning to the meat, as recommended by others, and added approximately eight ounces of refried beans to the meat mixture (instead of adding additional beef).  I topped the meat mixture with salsa before rolling up the tortilla and made homemade red enchilada sauce (from this website).  I'd definitely recommend making your own enchilada sauce.  It really makes a difference!

This is a good recipe  however I found the meat to be a tad bland.  To liven up the meat mix I added salsa, vegetables & spices from the Red Sauce!  Making these additions turned this recipe into a 5-Star Dish!

5.5.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18064/enchiladas/ ... I changed things a bit - subbed half a package of tofu for half or more than half of the meat; added a taco seasoning envelope; mixed the cheese in with the meat, but reserved a little to put over the enchilada sauce.  I didn't have cumin - for the sauce - so I'll probably make it again someday & like it more.  I added a little sauce to the meat mixture, too to help moisten & hold everything together.  Also, instead of using oil to soften the tortillas, microwave them - about three at a time for thirty seconds.  It's faster & doesn't add extra oil to an already calorie-laden dish.

Excellent!  I used refried beans instead of beef (my hubby's favorite) and I topped with Red Enchilada Sauce from this website (Hubby absolutely loved that!!) and monterey jack.  Baked covered for 15 minutes and this was the best meal we have had since moving from San Diego to TN.  Ole Donna!

I tried this recipe last night...and my family loved it! I made a few changes...instead of adding just salt and pepper. I added Vegeta, plus the fresh ground pepper to season the ground meat. I also added fresh minced garlic. Now I know you're going to think, that adding Coconut Oil is a bit greasy considering the ground beef. But, I don't care. The coconut oil was drained after it was placed in the flour tortilla. Therefore, I did not use the Vegetable Oil. My family loved these!... and I will probably make them again.

Great, simple recipe. Made them for 30 people, and everybody loved it. I also made a "hot" version with hot chili sauce mixed in with the tomatoe sauce and the filing...served along homemade guacamole dip with fresh bell peppers and celery. YUM!

This is definitely a 5 star recipe w/ a few modifications. I added taco seasoning to the meat, a little bit of the enchilada sauce and more cheese to the mixture. I did not soften the tortillas in oil. I put a little bit of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the 9x13 and rolled my tortillas up.  Once assembled, I covered in foil for 25 mins and then took the foil off for the last 5 minutes. This was so good even my picky 9 year old who only likes restaurant cheese enchiladas inhaled it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe!  While making this recipe I accidently mixed it up with the recipe for enchilade sauce, also found here, and added 1 table spoon of Cumin, onion powder and garlic.  It was delicious!  Since I have never made it as posted I am giving it a 5 because we loved it any way.

I did this recipe, and it was just a GROSS result, unedible. Don't even think about trying it: it is a HORRIBLE result of soggy, tasteless . Please: don't even try it. My result: a huge loss of good food and money. PLEASE, disregard the positive reviews, they are soooo wrong. This is just a result of really bad food results. Just awful.

So I threw out $10 in ingredients (plus the electricity for the oven) on a garbage bag of . Go away!!!

This is a good recipe to start with and you can play w/it to suit your taste. I brown meat w/taco seasoning.  I use corn tortillas and fry them for a few seconds in oil.  I put a little bit of the enchilada sauce on bottom of a 9x13 pan.Dip tortilla in sauce (I put sauce in pie plate) I add refried beans, meat, chopped olives, onions, cheese, whatever you want...and then roll them up. Fill up pan and then pour remaining sauce on top and top w/cheese. Some of my kids don't like the same thing so some will have different ingred.  depending on child.  All in the same pan....

Loved this recipe, super easy and tasty! It makes a lot, so I usually cut in half since I'm only cooking for one or two people at a time. The full recipe would be perfect for a family.

Loved the quick and easy recipe but I'm only giving four stars because I feel it really needed something in the meat mixture.  I added taco seasoning to the meat and coated both side of the tortillas with sauce so they wouldn't become dry.  Delicious!  My family couldn't get enough!

Definately need to add taco seasoning to the beef and I also cooked the beef with crushed garlic (not pressed). Then quite tasty.

These were easy enough, but severely lacking in taste. I used canned enchilada sauce which was a bad idea as it was thin and watery. (Make ten minute enchilada sauce or Mrs. Espy's sauce, it's worth it). This was edible and maybe if I wasn't used to real TexMex food I would have liked this better. I thought it was so bland and needed so much more to make it tastier. Sorry for the poor review. This just wasn't my thing.

Very good.  Frying the tortillas gave them a nice crispy outside.

This is an extremely easy dish to make.  When we have tacos for dinner, I always make extra taco meat to use in this recipe.  I first spread a heaping tablespoon of refried beans on the tortilla.  I use Chi-Chi's flour just as they come.  Then add your taco meat, and roll.  Place in a baking dish, pour your taco or enchilada sauce over them, and top with mexican or cheddar cheese, and bake as directed.

Very easy and very good! Not a fancy meal, but for a quick mid-week meal it works great. I love finding a recipe with few ingredients and that tastes great! I recommend buying a quality enchilada sauce, because that makes all the difference.

As others mentioned, this needs some spices. By the way, when rating a recipe make sure you are rating the right one. One reviewer subbed cheddar cheese for mushroom soup. No soup is in this recipe.

As some of the other posters suggested, I kick up a notch the flavors of what is both inside and on the outside of the enchiladas.  I serve with sour cream, guacamole, shredded lettuce and tomato slices.

I also use shredded chicken.  I add about 3/4-1 cup of enchilada sauce and some chesse to the mixture, then roll them up and pour remaining sauce and cheese before baking.  Serve with shredded lettuce and sour cream.

Made this last night for the first time.  Added a few things:  Instead of garlic salt, I added some minced garlic when browning the beef.  Also added a can of green chilies and some taco seasoning to give it a little more kick than just ground beef.  Used Mexican mix cheese instead of Colby.  I made only 1/2 recipe as it was just me and hubby eating them and I easily got 8 that were stuffed plenty full.  Turned out pretty tasty.  Had a side of mexican rice with it and I'm thinking of just adding some of the rice into the filling next time.  Hubby said he liked this really well.  This one will go into the menu rotation.  Thanks!!!

This was a good basic enchilada recipe.  It was somewhat bland, but that was a plus for my young boys.  I did add taco seasoning to the meat, used corn tortillas, and used a "Mexican" blend of cheese.  Again, very easy, no brainer dinner that I served with refried beans and Mexican rice.

I've only tried making enchiladas twice.  The first time was such a dismal failure that it has been quite a while since I tried it.  The first recipe I tried was one with cream cheese and chicken soup, it was so rich we could barely eat it and it went to waste. For this recipe I took the suggestion of some other reviews and added taco seasoning to the meat, it worked very well and is a must I think! I didn't bother heating up the tortilla shells in oil because I bought the big gordita ones, they were fresh and didn't crack so it worked well for me. I didn't make my own enchilada sauce, I used La Victoria and it turned out just wonderful. One other thing, I halfed the recipe and it made 6 big enchiladas that filled a 13 X 9, if you make the whole recipe you're cooking for an army!  Oh, don't forget the sour cream, YUM!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I like this recipe and have made it several times. The only thing that I do differently, is cook the ground beef mixture in taco seasoning. I think this gives the filling a ton more flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I have used a similar recipe for a few years now, the only real difference is that I don't do anything to the tortillas before I fill them and place them in the pan to bake. I continue to do it this way, and I love the results! Just made this last night and I got surprised compliments from someone who doesn't really like Mexican food. This is a good recipe for picky eaters, as it is simple, not too spicy, and you can still get your fill on some yummy Mexican style food! Also, i add some of the enchilada sauce with the beef/onion mixture before filling the tortillas, I think it gives it a bit more taste, and it keeps them nice and saucy inside. Serve them with sour cream. yum!

Yum! I modified it a little, though. I halved the recipe for my husband and I. I only had fajita size tortillas, and they (6 tortillas) filled the 9 x 13 pan. I can't imagine making this full recipe and using a 9 x 13 pan. Also, I threw a little sour cream in with the cheese and meat. I used real garlic when I sauteed the onions and beef instead of garlic salt (love garlic so I threw a huge spoonful of canned garlic). I used a whole 8 oz bag of cheese for half a recipe. Just a reminder, the recipe calls for 19 oz cans of enchilada sauce. I only had a small can on hand and my husband pointed out that it needed more sauce. So make sure you get the right size can... I fried the first two tortillas in the grease from the meat (mmmm, super healthy!) instead of using vegetable oil. Once it was dried up, I poured a little oil in the pan.  The recipe was a big hit with my husband.

This recipe gets five stars with modifications, four stars without.  I made some of the modifications suggested by other reviewers and a few of my own.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and added diced mushrooms (I didn't have quite 2 lb of ground turkey so the mushrooms provided extra substance), a can of green chiles (drained), chili powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes.  I also used whole wheat tortillas and reduced fat cheddar/monterey jack blend.  They came out REALLY well :).  Very flavorful.  An easy enchilada recipe that you can modify to your liking!

I used corn tortillas as others suggested, added fresh garlic (love garlic!) and instead of taco seasoning, I added chopped green chilis to the beef.  Gave the dish great flavor and the 'red enchilada sauce' is outstanding.

Great tasting! I only used 1 pound of hamburger, added taco seasoning to the beef, and used corn tortillas as others suggested. I also made the enchilada sauce using the recipe on this website. Turned out great, and plenty for my family of 4! Topped with chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, black olives, and sour cream. Served with refried beans and rice.

This was pretty good.  I prepared it with chicken instead of beef.  I used 1 tbsp less of chili powder, which was perfect.  I did not used canned enchilada sauce, I made the enchilada sauce by Anna Marie on this website.  My only complaint is this was a very time consuming receipe!

These were great!  I'm from Arizona, & these brought back memories of high school trips to Mexico!  Next time I think I will season the ground beef with taco seasoning just to give them more flavor, but they still tasted great without it!

A great recipe! (hard to find because it's in the "Holiday Recipe" section, though!)
I, too, used a little less ground beef and added a very sharp cheddar to the Colby mix.  This
is a very easy recipe to modify to your own family's tastes - less beef, more cheese, less onion,
add some chopped chiles, sliced black olives, etc.

We followed the recipe but added a little taco seasoning as suggested in a couple reviews.  We also cut back on the onion as it seemed like too much for the amount of meat.  The meat was still bland on its own but as long as you take a bite with everything its tasty.  My husband said that these were better than the enchiladas he gets at his favorite Mexican restaurant.  We used the red enchilada sauce recipe from this app as well, it was so good!  We would double the sauce recipe the next time.

I rated this 5 stars with some minor adjustments.  First off, I use the ten minute enchilada sauce found on this website (I find the enchilada sauce "chili strong" so I triple the other spices and add a 680 ml can of tomato sauce-makes 4 cups-freeze 2 cups for next time). We are a family of 4 with 2 teenage boys and find these very filling when served with a side of mexican rice.  Therefore, I use 2 9x13 pans with 5 enchilada in each (cook once, eat twice!).  I omit the garlic salt and use 4 tbsp of my homemade taco seasoning as well as 1 cup of salsa.  I use flour tortillas (personal preference). After cooking the meat mixture, I divide it up into 10 portions and roll each portion in a tortilla with 2 tbsp of cheese in each.  I use a scant 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce on the bottom of each pan and spoon another 1/2 cup on top of each enchilada making sure to coat them entirely. Sprinkle any remaining cheese over top and bake for 15-20 minutes only.  This is ALWAYS a hit with EVERYBODY in our family.

Other than portions, I made three modifications:  I used ground turkey (85/15), I used more seasoning (pepper, seasoned salt, garlic salt) and I added a can of cream of chicken soup to the meat while simmering.  It was a huge hit at my house!  Prep was quick and easy, and the enchiladas were flavorful.

I added a chopped jalapeno and this was still bland to me.  Also, 2 cans of enchilada sauce were way too much.  Next time I'll add taco seasoning and/or Tabasco to boost the flavor, and maybe give it a shot under the broiler for the last couple minutes.

I used a hot picante enchilada sauce which was way too hot for me but my husband loved it.  I put the flour tortillas in the microwave for a few minutes which softened them up and made them easy to roll.  Will do this one again.

It seems to be a very Americanized recipe for enchiladas. Next time I'll make my own sauce because the canned was too heavy on the chili powder. Husband loved it though!

I add chili powder in with the beef, and a few cloves of garlic with the onion.  I also use the red enchilada sauce from this site (and I don't put the tortillas in any oil, no need).  Delicious!

I took some of the advice of others and added some additional spices, i.e., chili powder, cumin, s&p and about 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I also added a defrosted (and drained) pkg of frozen chopped spinach.  Like the previous rater I also put some of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan before baking.  This is the second time I've made this and my family really likes it.

This is the same recipe that my mother in. Law gave me only we add taco seasoning and chopped bell pepper to the meat. We also coat the inside of tortilla with sour cream and add enchilada sauce to the meat before rolling. The sourcesm keeps them from drying out.

This is totally delicious and easy to make.  There is no need to fry the shells though.  They roll up easy and it's less fattening to leave the oil out.  You can make these quickly and it looks like you spent hours.  Add black olives, refried beans...or garnish with sour cream when finished...and it's a real winner!!  It's a winner without adding any extras as well.  I plan on trying the Red Enchilada Sauce from this website like another member suggested!

These were super yummy!  As other reviewers suggested I added a little enchilada sauce and taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I'm not sure how two pounds of meat only makes 12 enchiladas...I made 20!  Next time I will either use one pound of meat and the same amount of sauce or two pounds of meat with double the sauce.  Mine turned out a little dry because I didn't have enough sauce.

I'd never thought of using flour tortillas.  I'll have to try it this way.  I always use corn.  I'll give it 4 stars since I haven't tried it yet.  But, I will!  Thanks!

made this for years with some changes I got from the in-laws and a few of my own.  Sub the mushroom soup with cheddar cheese soup, double the meat and add 1 chopped onion and lots of garlic when you saute.  Double the tortillas in each layer, and it will help the consistancy(sp?) if you lightly fry them first.  Everything else is pretty much the same.  I agree that unless you are in and out or it's the middle of summer you might as well use the oven and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hr.  Very easy to customize to your own taste.   Also great with chicken and green enchilada sauce.

I agree with other reviews, in that you need to add spices or taco seasoning to the meat.  Otherwise, a very good recipe.  Will definately make this one again.

I give it 3 1/2 *'s because it was an all-around great dish that is sure to please people of all ages. However, I with that I had read some of the reviews before making it, as I would have taken some of the suggestions made by other reviewers. (e.g: adding some sauce to the meat, adding taco seasoning to the meat, etc.) It was really only the meat that I found slightly bland, although the sauce that soaked into the tortilla camouflaged this. (BTW, I used the 'Red Enchilada Sauce' recipe from this site, which worked great) Overall, I would say that this is a keeper, as it is easy to prepare and caters to everyone's taste buds. I'll be making it again, with changes! Thanks! :)

Everyone loved them...I added to the taco seasoned meat, green chilies from the can, onion and fresh chopped tomatoes.  Do use part of the enchilada sauce to coat the bottom of the pan, just don't use too much, mine started to get a little soggy!  I did put a little bit of extra cheese in the meat mix and a little extra on top.  Topped with sour cream, can't beat it.

Everyone seemed to like them. Made a vegetarian version for myself, using veggie ground round (no need to precook) and it was delicious too. Made Red enchilada sauce from this site, as my grocery store doesn't carry enchilada sauce. Used corn and jalapeno tortillas, which added a nice spiciness to the dish. The only problems were too much meat, and difficult to get out of the dish. Next time I will use less meat and spray the cooking dish with nonstick spray. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night.  I thought it was very good, but I added seasonings to the beef (garlic power, onion power, chili powder, paprika, oregano, red pepper flakes, garlic salt, and a little enchilada sauce (suggestion by another cook)).  I didn't make my own enchilada sauce, I used Jose's Enchilada sauce (I think)...it was really good.  I can't give it 5 stars b/c of the seasoning I did.  My fiance loved it.  He even ate it for breakfast this morning.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone and I will for sure make it again.

This was sooooooo good! I did make a couple of changes to it according to what I had on hand. I used 1 lb beef, mixed in some wild rice and added 2 tsp crushed garlic, instead of the garlic salt, 1 4.5 oz can of chopped green chiles, a pinch of cayenne pepper, 1/2 packet of burrito seasoning (added while cooking the meat and onions) mixed all together with half a can of red enchilada sauce.  We also used twice as much cheese (we love cheese). I served it similar to rolled tacos, with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and onions with a little chuky salsa on the side. Turned out GREAT! I don't remember ever having enchiladas that tasted so good. We will definately be making this again.

I didn't have Taco seasoning so I kept adding garlic salt, season salt, and pepper to the meat to taste before baking. These enchiladas turned out wonderful. Definitely a keeper.

Not really sure what was off but these were not a big hit with my family. I used the red enchilada sauce recipe on here. Since I am not sure it if is the sauce or the enchiladas that went wrong I am going to have to make them separately and see.

This recipe was an excellent "guide" but that is about it... it would have been sooo bland if I had followed it! I used taco seasoning as some others suggested and I made the Red Enchilada Sauce from this website rather than the canned stuff. Also used the "Nacho" blend of grated cheese... very yummy.

Great recipe. I added a few other things: in my ground beef, I put only one package of taco seasoning and also a can of enchilada sauce. I also added some cooked white rice in each burrito. I used low carb tortillas, they are so soft that I didn't need to heat them in oil.

With just a couple of modifications, this recipe was amazing!  In fact, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this as I am not fan of ground beef in any type of mexican food.  Use Hatch Brand Enchilada Sauce, it will make a huge difference!  I used flash fried corn tortillas in place of the flour tortillas, added a couple of cloves of minced fresh garlic to the meat while it was cooking, added a couple of handfuls of sharp white cheddar to the meat and poured a little enchilada sauce into the drained meat, and topped with sharp cheddar, and a monterrey jack/cheddar mix.  We served with dollops of sour cream and fresh chopped roma tomatoes.  Wow!  This is a new family favorite.

I made some changes to this recipe and we liked it!  I halved the recipe, using only 1 lb. of ground beef and 6 large flour tortillas and 1/2 can enchilada sauce.  I also used taco seasoning for the ground beef as mentioned in previous reviews.  I still used 8 oz. cheese.  Simple, quick and a crowd pleaser!

I used one lb of beef and 1/2 lb of sausage. It helps flavor it a little bit.  I used the ten minute enchilada sauce from the site for it.

Very simple and easy recipe to make.  I used the red enchilada sauce like many suggested and it was really good. I also added a few spices like a little cumin, chili powder and garlic to the beef. Will make again.

For these I halved the recipe and used about 2/3lb. ground turkey and threw in a 14oz can of black beans.  I also added a tablespoon of chili powder and they turned out great.  Next time I might try and make my own enchilada sauce, I wasn't completly satisfied with the brand I chose.

I followed previous suggestions and used taco seasoning. I used 8 12" inch tortillas and didn't fry them. I also used almost 3 cans of enchilada sauce. My husband and I liked the enchiladas, but my 4 year old didn't care for them. He loves tacos and burritos, but I don't think he liked the enchilada sauce.

My kids loved this as most kids love mexican food.  The bigger surprise was that my fussy husband enjoyed it also.  I made this with the 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe from this site.  I did add a package of taco seasoning powder and fresh crushed garlic in with the ground beef.  I was worried it would be very bland without it. Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. Can I suggest using a food spray to coat the tortillas instead of frying? I find they still do the trick of not turning mushy, but are also not as heavy. Not too traditional, but still very good.

Great taste and goes together very quickly for a fairly fast home-cooked meal.  I did add a package of taco seasoning to my ground beef, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Both my husband and my 13yo eating machine loved this!

Delicious!  I made a few changes based on suggestions of other members and this has turned out to be one of my favorite dishes.  I use spicy everything because we like it hot and also add a can of spicy refried beans to the meat mixture. My very picky boyfriend loves these enchiladas.  Thanks!!

These were excellent AFTER my additions. It's a good base recipe, but it needs your creativity. 

I used pepper jack cheese instead, and used green enchilada sauce. I took a bunch of the recommendations of fellow reviewers:
- mixed into the ground beef - fresh cilantro, cumin, frozen chopped bell peppers, some enchilada sauce
- mixed into the enchilada sauce to pour on top - a can of turkey chile
- sprinkled on top - chopped green onions, sliced olives, extra cheese

These were "better than in a restaurant" said my BF :-)

very good!  i cut the recipe in half and used a small casserole dish.  this worked well to keep everything together.  i added a lot more spices to the meat and some sliced black olives to the sauce too and topped with guac and sour cream... definitely a keeper!

My husband loved this recipe and wanted me to rate it a 5 but I rated it a 4 because I did make some minor adjustments.  I love saucy things so after adding the meat and cheese to the tortilla, I spooned enchilada sauce over it before rolling it all up.  After I had rolled up the tortillas I drenched the whole thing with more sauce and topped it all with cheese.  Also, I probably won't fry the tortillas next time, just microwave them as suggested by some others.  I also cut the recipe in half because it is just my husband and I.  I used cheddar and a little of mozerella cheese because that is all we had in the house and it still turned out great.  Thanks!!!

5 stars after some changes.  I made my own sauce using a recipe found on this website to which I added minced garlic, minced onion, Mexican oregano, chili powder and cumin.  I also used lo carb tortillas and Mexican cheese and omitted the garlic salt using taco seasoning instead.  I cut the recipe in half for a family of 4 and this was devoured by all!! Thanks for the other reviews and the sauce recipe.  Very helpful!

I make this often, but I agree with other viewers that the meat can be a little bland. I doctored it up the second time around per other reviewers' recommendations and enjoyed it much more.

these were very good, I used this recipe mostly for how to do the tortillas (which was perfect-thank you), it was just the right ammount of spice for us, my husband loved them, added it to his favorites list.

This was very good.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and put a little cumin in with the meat.  I also used a packet mix to make the enchilada sauce, tasted much better and was cheaper than the premade canned.  I also used whole grain tortillas.

This was pretty good. I thought they were a bit bland and needed some kind of spice. But it is a good classic enchilada.

These were very tasty!  I used fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.  Also, I only used one can of sauce because that's all the store had.  They still came out great.  Next time I may use a medium (instead of mild) sauce if I can find it.  These were great for the kids, because they don't like too much spice.

Great Recipe to make your own.  Easy to spice up and great for the whole family. Delicious with ground beef, onion, and green chile. I  used the packet sauce and spiced that up a little too.

These were ok, nothing spectacular but a good basis to start with.  I added cumin, chili powder and more garlic to give the meat some flavor and mixed some cheese in with the sauce to make it easier to assemble.

Very adaptable -- for example, I don't like onions much, but the recipe doesn't seem to suffer at all if I leave them out. I always have leftovers when I serve this, but this is one of the few things I cook that I can guarantee will be eaten before it gets fuzzy -- it even tastes good cold!

Yummy!  I give it the fifth star based on easy-to-get ingredients and simple preparation.  Next time I'll serve it with some refried beans and some sour cream on top, I think.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe, everyone at my house liked it!  I did make the Red Enchilada Sauce (found in allrecipes.com) as some previous posters suggested & I think it would not of been as good without it---much better then canned Enchilada Sauce.  The homemade sauce added a lot of flavor.  I also added a package of Taco Seasoning to the meat.  I put 1/2 the recipe in flour shells & 1/2 in corn shells--both where good!  I will make this again.  Simple to make!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, and he was especially pleased.  I used 16 ounces of Cheddar cheese and corn tortillas, rather than the type and amnt. of cheese and flour tortillas specified in the recipe.  It took me about an hour and a half to make, however, much longer than the time specified in the recipe.

This was an easy recipe.  I added 1 can of beans and corn and layered the enchiladas w/corn tortillas.  My husband thought it would have tasted better with crushed chips instead. I used only one pound of ground turkey and made the powder enchilada mixture instead.  Overall I liked this receipe. :)

Very quick and easy recipe. I was suprised at how authentic it tasted.. tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen. Hubby absolutely loved it.. We will be making this again.

P.S. I cut the recipe in half and used Colby/Jack mix.. I think I will try a little more enchilada sauce next time around. 5 stars!

The flour tortillas were mushy when cooked and this disapointed the children.  I will try this again, but I'll use corn tortillas.  Maybe the kids will like them then.

As simple as these are they are really good. I only used 1# of gr. beef and only 1/4 c. onion (my kids aren't big onion eaters)and 1 can of sauce. Will make them again. Thanks for sharing the recipe. The 20 min. was a bit long in my oven. Carrie

A good starter recipe, but needs to be tweaked or else it will be bland.  I used shredded venison steak only because I didnt have ground beef on hand.  I added diced green chilies to the meat along with garlic and onions.  Also, I used flour tortillas but next time will use corn.  Doctor it up with more cheese and serve with sour cream....yum!

I didn't have the time to fry the tortillas. Should have waited till I did. They ended up soggy. Otherwise they were very tasty! I'll make them again.

I never leave reviews.  This recipe was fantastic!!!  Super easy.  Only change was adding taco seasoning to the beef like many others suggest and I tossed on top some left over Spanish rice to use it up.  We all ate it up, even the ever picky children!!!  Thank you!!!

My son's friend requested enchiladas for supper tonight, and this recipe did not disappoint. It was really good. The only thing I did differently was add some taco seasoning to the ground beef/onion mixture. I will be making these again.

This was very good!  I used shredded chicken instead of ground beef.  I added some chili powder and paprika to add some spice to it.  Next time I think I’ll add some green pepper.

I cut this all in half. 1 Lb of Hamburger and so on. Used minced onion instead. Also added a taco seasoning mix, crushed red peppers, chipolte black pepper & diced tomatoes. It made 8 tortillas instead of 6. Just my wife and I so i didn't need 12.

Best recipes are simple. This is both! I used corn tortillas instead of flour and only about a quarter of the second can of enchilada sauce. Cooked uncovered for 25 minutes and sprinkled some more cheeses on top and back in to brown for 5 minutes.

Loved this recipe! Took some advice from other reviewers and added taco seasoning and green chiles to the ground beef and onions. The 10 minute red enchillada sauce found on this site was completely worth the extra step! Would absolutely recommend.

This is a great recipe...I just made a few changes. I used ground turkey, low carb tortillas, crushed tomatoes, spinach,olives, low fat cheese, and low sodium taco seasoning. Also, added a tablespoon of plain yogurt when I plated them...healthy. :)

The only thing I do different is I use corn tortillas, which being from Texas that's what works for us.

Great shell of a recipe to start with... had to tweak it a bit for flavor adding a pinch of cayenne as well as chili powder to the meat mixture. Also chopped some tomato and added it to the meat. Also added some fresh spicy oregano from my garden... Once again, a great recipe to begin with...enchiladas are an easy and fun spin on a weeknight dinner!

I was not going to try this recipe because I tend to prefer chicken enchiladas. Since I only had ground beef on hand, and the recipe seemed quick and easy, I decided to give it a try.  It was excellent and the kids even asked for more!  The only modifications I made was to use a mexican blend cheese instead of colby and I added black olives.  I also added taco seasoning mix to the ground beef as other reviewers did. This recipe is a keeper!!!

My husband liked them.  I have never had them before and I didnt like the flavor of the enchilada sauce.  I used Old El Paso(hot).  I also added 1 10oz(drained)can of rotel original diced tomatoes and green chilies, to give the meat some more flavor and a bite to it.  I will make it for my husband again, but I'm not a enchilada fan.. Thank you for the recipe

Big hit with husband. I sauteed the onions in a separate pan with garlic powder and salt, then added to ground beef (followed previous reviews and added a package of taco seasoning to the beef.) Quick and easy...will make again.

I used a sliver of sour cream inside of each enchilada, corn tortillas, some ground beef and some chicken. Could try other meats suck as carne asada or pork. Used red pepper flakes, cumin onion powder instead of onions. Served with homemade Spanish rice found on this site and refried beans.

I couldn't love Mexican food more but enchiladas are usually not my favorite. Something about the vinagar-y flavor in the sauce? Anyway, this recipe was good but I took other reviewers advice and boosted the flavor of the meat with 1/2 a package of taco seasoning. I also added about 2 tbsp of HOT salsa to spice it up. The husband loved it! Served with rice & beans. Will make again.

My picky 16 year old son enjoyed this recipe!  I made a few adjustments; I added taco seasoning to the beef along with some of the enchilada sauce (?3/4 cup). I also didn't cook the tortilla prior to baking--don't think it affected the outcome!  very easy recipe; will definitely make again!

Thank you, thank you for this recipe. I just got married a few months ago and I have been trying new dishes to make for my husband and most of them were just ok. After I made this recipe I was nervous but my husband loves them and he asks for them almost every week. Thanks.

I substituted one can enchilada sauce for one can chili, and put that in with the ground beef.  I also put in one can mild chopped green chilis and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Seasoned beef with cumin, garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper.  EXCELLENT!  Very fast and easy, too.

I made these last night and they were great. I used Taco Seasoning 1 from this site, and 2 cloves of garlic. We've put the other half in the freezer it made so many!

This was mediocre recipe that didn't have much flavor. It might have been the canned enchilada sauce I used. I much more prefer the Betty Crocker recipe that I've used in the past which skips the canned sauce and uses a more homemade sauce. But this recipe is quicker.

I've never made Enchiladas before and these turned out GREAT!  I did use taco seasoning on the meat to give it more flavor, also used 1 can of Enchilada sauce and 1 jar of taco sauce to keep it on budget for my wallet.  Will make again!

This recipe needs more flavor...  maybe try adding taco seasoning to the meat.  And I tried the "ten minute enchilada sauce" which added to how bad this recipe turned out for me.  Needless to say, we were lucky that I thought to prepare a side salad, which became our meal.  My husband and I took 2 bites and decided that this had to be thrown out of my recipe book.

My family really enjoyed this one.  Though this recipe makes double what we needed- we had excellent leftovers all week!  Next time I will make the whole batch and split it into two pans and put one in the freeszer to have on hand for a quick dinner later.

These were great.  I cut the recipe in half though since it is just my husband and I.  I did keep the 1/8 garlic salt though.  My husband grew up on mexican food in SoCal but loved these.  Will definitely make again (probably once a month).

Really good enchildas.  I took others' advice and used the Red Enchilada Sauce Recipe, substituting a chopped tomato for salsa (less chunks).  I also added taco seasoning to the beef.  If you like spicy, you definitely need to add some spice of your liking.  Following the recipe it is kid friendly, except for the onions (depending on your kid)!  Overall, delicious and a great recipe!

I liked these enchiladas pretty well. My bf said they were "alright and okay" Like another reviewer suggested, I made the 10-min. enchilada sauce from this site. The sauce was really good. For this recipe I also added more spices to the ground meat and also a can of mild green chiles. I think the chiles really added a nice taste to the enchiladas. I most likely will make this one again.

I liked this recipe alot, and I like the fact that I can make it in Hungary and the ingredients are available. I did not fry the tortillas in oil the last time I made it and it turned out just as good, and healthier.

Delicious!  My husband loved it!  I had leftover taco meat (turkey) so I used that instead of the ground beef and garlic salt, and since I had less than a pound, I also added a can of black beans.  I had some poblano pepper so I threw a little of that in as well.

I should have added taco seasoning like others suggested.  I did use corn tortillas instead of flour because flour tortillas seem more like a burrito.  But maybe I should have tried flour anyway...maybe next time.

this was very good. I took the suggestions of others- and made them with flour tortillas ( and I think thats what made it so good. I also used a packet of taco seasoning in the meat- next time I will use two. It took no time at all all- and I will be making this again. Thanks!

This was a great recipe!  It was easy and it didn't take all day to prepare.  I took the suggestions of others and used the taco seasoning and corn tortillas.  I will definitely be making these again!!

Great recipe Donna. My husband loved them. I did use corn torilla's instead of flour ones.I added taco seasoning in the hamb as others suggested. Will be a keeper at our house.I used the red Enchilada sauce recipe found on this site with them

This was my very first time making enchiladas. Every one in my family said it came out great! I am very pleased to have served such a delicious meal to my family! Only thing I did different was adding more seasoning. Great Recipe!!

This was a good starting recipe. I followed several of the suggestions. I added the taco seasoning pack and I only had 1 lb of ground beef so I added a can of refried beans. I also used the red enchilada sauce that a lot of you talked about. I also added some cream cheese to the tortillas when I added the filling!  It was soooo good!!!  Will make again!!!!

this was incredibly easy, even for an ammatuer like me.  i took other reviewers advice and added taco seasoning to the meat, as well as some of the enchilada sauce (i used the canned stuff--it worked just fine), used real garlic instead of the powder, and lots of green chillies.  also put a chunk of velveeta (for melty cheese) in each role with some sour cream for some extra creaminess.  will be making these again for sure!

Very good and easy.  My only suggestion would be to 1/2 (or less) the amount of meat, otherwise it was to thick and meaty.  All I could taste was the hamburger.

Something needs to be added to the meat.. it seemed somewhat bland.  I mean you saute' it with onions and that kind of gives it the mexican feel but there just needs to be something added.  Not sure what it needs. :)

This was a very big hit with the family.  If were to have added anything, it would have been abit more onion, but thats just for my personal taste.
Excellent, and will make again.

What can I say I was very worried when I made this recipe because the best I can do, is too get my husband to eat a taco when it comes to Mexican food...But he loved them. They were simple and had a good flavor. I'll be making this one often. Thanks for the recipe Donna

My 5 year old LOVED it. My husband said it was good, and asked to make it again (but didn't have the enthusiasm that the 5 year old did). I think next time I'll play around with the recipe, using corn (yes, the flour tortillas were a bit soggy) and maybe some olives, mushrooms or ??
