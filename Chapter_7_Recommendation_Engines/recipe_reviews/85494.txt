I like lemon chicken, but this recipe is a joke.  I always try recipes as printed first and then alter to my tastes if necessary.  By the time I alter this one it will barely resemble the original.  There is far to much lemon zest.  I would also replace the vinegar with white wine, reduce the amount of oregano, add some basil, garlic and about 1/4 cup of oil.  I would then grill rather than bake.

I love lemon, but 1/2 cup of zest is definately a typo.  I used about 1 tablespoon, and the chicken was still almost too lemony.  I also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and a little olive oil as we grilled the chicken after marinating for several hours.  It was very moist and tangy.

do not use 1/4 cup of zest as stated. I used 1/2 tbs and it came out with a great zip to it.  my fiancee thought it was perfect! I will make this again.

Moist and flavorful.  I did use less lemon zest than called for and next time would add a little salt.

These are great! I cooked them in the oven for about 20 mins covered with tin foil, in the marinade, and then removed them and finished them off on the BBQ. That way, they soaked up all the yummy flavour from the marinade, plus they had that fab grilled taste. Yum!!! :)

The lemon and oregano was way too over powering. I'll stick with my own recipe.

The lemon zest and oregano are absolutely over-powering!  I added some garlic and a little olive oil, and would definitely recommend reducing the oregano to 3 tsp at most.  Not memorable at all.

The oregano and lemon was too overpowering.  The vinegar really wasn't needed.

It was most certainly very eatable and fairly tasty. It states very clearly in the recipe that the zest used is in one long strip, so I took my knife and sliced a big spiral of zest off my lemon. It worked wonderfully. For me it was the oregano that was to much. I will scale that back or omit it next time (not a favorite flavor) but will probably use this marinade again. :)

I agree with the comment that 1/2 cup of zest seems like a lot.

How much lemon zest do you actually use?  1/2 cup sounds like an awful lot.
