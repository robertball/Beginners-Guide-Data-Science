Wow, is this a very good, rich, dessert bar.  I made exactly as written to take to Girls Night Out tonight.  Hubby just got home from work and proceeded to eat three of them.  He said after the third one, "I definitely need a glass of milk'!  The combination of the scm, chocolate, almonds and toffee work really well together in this recipe.  Because they are so rich, I cut mine in smaller pieces and I got 48 rather than 24.  Thanks, Mama Mona for sharing your recipe.

Worth every calorie! So good! I substituted the butter with Coconut butter and the chocolate bar for chocolate chips. I also added coconut flakes. Easy to make and it was a hit at a dinner party I attended.

I subbed butterscotch chips for caramel bits - but otherwise followed the recipe. It's an amazing, easy, sinfully good fix for sweet cravings!!

These were ok.  I like the idea of adding coconut.  Would also increase the nuts and chocolate.  Cook time was too long for my oven.  I think I would try 325 if I made them again as the edges tended to be overcooked more than the middle.  Also I used a non-stick pan.  The middle was fine but the edges and sides really stuck.  Lost about a 1/3 in around.  I would grease the corners and sides.

Excellent!
I used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup almond flour. 1/2 bag each dark chocolate chips, and toffee bits. 1/2 cup flaky coconut.

This is so yummy! I have made it several times since I found it! I like it best without the almonds and with toasted coconut! Highly recommended.
