I gave this a bit more of a coconut flavor boost by using 1/2 the amount of milk and adding coconut milk..  It was a hit with my family.

I was looking for a quick and uncomplicated recipe for pie and boy did I strike gold!!  I have cooked this pie 3 times in a little over a week!!  Since my grandmother passed away I haven't had a good home cooked coconut pie.  My son who is sooooo picky nearly at the first pie right by himself.  I couldn't believe it.  I took one pie to work and it was a huge hit.  It's so simple.  Be sure and use the deep dish crust!!  Thanks!

This is an excellent coconut pie.  I made it exactly as directions specified, and it turned out perfect.  It set up beautifully, and to our taste, the custard/coconut ratio was just right.

Really good.  I used a refridgerated pie crust, a regular 9" pie plate (no need for deep dish) and added 1 full cup of coconut and buttermilk in place of milk. The extra tang of the buttermilk was a great contrast to the sweetness. I baked mine an extra 5 min. for a firmer pie.  I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. coconut extract in addition to the vanilla. Such a quick, simple delicious pie. Great warm or cold.

Delicious!!!  As many others have said, a little more coconut makes this great pie even better.  I add between 3/4 and 1 cup.

Great pie.  Reminded me of an old fashion coconut pie.  Added 1 cup of sweetened coconut but it was a little too stiff.  Next time I will add only 3/4 cup to the recipe.  Very easy.  Love it!

As a busy Mom, this was a breeze to make! It was different than the usual pudding pie recipe my Mom had always made, but I prefer this one better. Rich and creamy, be sure to add more coconut!

This recipe is wonderful, even with significant modification. I'm diabetic so I tweaked it trying to reduce the carbs. First of all, I used 1/4 c. Splenda brown and 10 Splenda with Fiber in place of the sugar. I added another egg, used whole wheat white flour, and used half-n-half for half of the milk. I also threw in a little extra vanilla. I had a little more filling than the pie crust could hold so I poured it into well greased muffin pan and put a frozen strawberry in the middle. The pie itself was amazingly good! I'll make it again and again. My kids, husband, grandma, everyone loved it and couldn't tell that I'd subbed out the sugar. The muffin thingies were good, a little wet for me, but probably because of the frozen strawberry.

This was a really easy, good recipe.  I used mini graham cracker crusts.  This recipe made about 2 pkgs of the crust (There were either 6 or 8 crusts in each pkg.)

I loved this pie and so did my family. If your looking for an easy delicious coconut pie recipe, try this one. I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 tspn of vanilla. I also slightly prebaked my pie shell at 350 for 10 minutes. Baked the pie for 1 hour and the last 5 minutes, it put a little coconut on top for toasting. Turned out excellent.

So fast and easy to whip up. I had fresh coconut milk in my fridge to use up, so I used 1 1/2 cups of that instead of milk. The second time I used milk as stated and I liked it better actually. I use 1 cup of UNSWEETENED coconut flakes and kept the amt. of sugar as is, sweetened coconut is overkill in my opinion.  I also used 1 tsp. of pure coconut extract instead of vanilla extract, it gave it extra flavor.  The only thing this pie needs is a dollop of whipped cream on the side, but even that's not a true necessity. I also liked that the pie shell didn't need prebaking. All in all, a quick pie to whip up in a pinch. And very delish too.

This was my first attempt to make a coconut pie and I must say that I am completely satisfied with how this turned out.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I did substitute a 1/2 cup of milk for a 1/2 cup of coconut milk to give it a stronger coconut flavor.  Great recipe!

Great recipe!  It was a bit sweeter than I prefer.  Otherwise  it was good.  I made it a second time  and did 3/4 cup a sugar and like  most recipes for coconut pie I used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, a 1/4 is way to little  of an amound.   Im  also a unhealthy butter  fan so I used 2-3 table spoons of butter  the second time around.  but I rate the  original a 4 star.  great  recipe.  And also I read  one review  that said it was soggy, runny.  try  letting it cool and settle first.  Real coconut  pie will be moist  as it  it suppose to be.

The custard like center tasted best after chilling in the fridge for a couple hours. I threw in a cup of chocolate chips to the mix which gave a chocolate layer at the bottom of the pie.

I made this pie for a dinner we had with just another couple.  We ate the ENTIRE pie.  It is the simplest pie to make and it is YUMMY.  Making another one today but I'm going to add more coconut and an extra egg.  You cannot go wrong with this pie!

It was a delicious pie. My little brother loved it and he's very picky. I tweaked the recipe a little. First I used the recipe for the basic flaky pie crust. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. I didn't add the flakes because they make my brother choke.

I was VERY pleased with this recipe.  I baked tart coconut pies for a friend and this recipe was very easy and delicious.  I did make a few minor changes per other reviewers' comments.  I used 1 cup shredded coconut, 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1/2 cup of condensed milk.  Very sweet to the taste, which is a huge plus for me!!!

excellent!  I used a cup of coconut milk like another reviewer and I'm glad I did. I also only used 3/4 cup sugar and no one missed it.

I LOVED this recipe. I had tried several and this one by far is the best. I did however add 1/4 cup of shredded coconut to the top before baking and also only added 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of coconut milk.

I used a frozen deep dish pie crust, added a TBSP or two more flaked coconut and replaced the milk with an equal amount of canned coconut milk (found in the Asian or Hispanic food aisle of your grocery store).  My Southern husband said it tastes just like his Grandma used to make.  Delicious and addictive!

This recipe is very easy and really good.
Next time I may use a little less coconut and add coconut milk for more flavor.  Also, this recipe is enough for 2 9inch pie crusts...there is no need to double the recipe.

Everyone really loved this pie.....very coconutty. I did use coconut extract instead of the vanilla for more flavor. Very easy to make. My first time making a custard pie and it was a success. Thanks!

WOW! This was very tastey and a snap to throw together.  I don't even like coconut and I loved this pie.  I do like custard and the filling on this is like a custard with coconut.  It really can't get any easier than this recipe and it baked up picture perfectly.

I was looking for something quick to throw together for dessert and this was perfect! Took me less than 5 mins prep time.  I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup. And I didn't have time to make a pie crust so I did it crustless. It was soooooo good and so simple!!!!

I added more coconut (about 1 1/4 cup) which is probably why I had to bake this pie longer than the recipe called for; nevertheless, it was delicious.

Excellent! I added a half teaspoon of rum extract and let it cook for 1 hour. The taste and texture were perfect.

It took closer to 90 minutes to cook. I even raised the temperature to 375, for the last half hour. The flavor was OK but my husband asked me not to make it again.

the filling came out kinda eggy-tasting. maybe the eggs were approaching expiration; i'm not really sure. maybe i'm just not that big on custard pies. everybody else seemed to like it, but i probably won't be making this again any time soon.

I was surprised how easy this was to make. It turned out very good. I had never had a coconut pie before. Always coconut cream. It was nice to change it up a little. It was best when it was warm from the oven.

Not bad!  A may cut down the sugar a bit next time and it didn't fill my 9" pie.  I would double it next time.  Great and simple pie though!  I needed something in which I already had the ingredients on hand.  I think it would be good with some caramel sauce.

This pie is the "bomb".  Exactly what I wanted for guests.  Doubled it to make two---one for me and my husband to enjoy.  I added more vanilla (always do) and I did bake the pie shell a little before adding filling to bake--my oven does gooey crusts if not.  Other wise totally followed recipe.  So yummy!!

This recipe is amazing!  Took it to a BBQ over Memorial Day and not a crumb was left!

I used buttermilk and fresh grated coconut.   Mmmmmmm

BUT there's more: the next day, my significant other asked me to make another for us.   I cooked 4 stalks of sliced rhubarb, 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water.  Cut buttermilk down to 1/4 cup and Added the cooked rhubarb to the pie and baked it   

WOW-spectacular combination.
