Good and sweet! I added chopped onion instead of the powder. We enjoyed it as a vegetable dip!

It was much less creamy than hummus and didn't have much flavor. I would add a tablespoon of tahini next time and maybe more garlic. Otherwise a neat alternative for those who cannot tolerate legumes.

Very yummy! I used chickpeas another time I made this and added some extra virgin olive oil to make it a little smoother. But love the cashew flavor with it!

I brought it to book club today and a few people raved about it. I used the water from the can of corn to thin it out until the Vitamix could process it. I also added a half teaspoon of curry powder because I thought it would be great and it was. I skipped the onion powder because of an allergy and used a fresh clove of garlic.
