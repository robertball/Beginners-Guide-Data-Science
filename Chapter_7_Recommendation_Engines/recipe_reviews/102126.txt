I can't wait to try this recipe!  I use Young's Chocolate Stout when making corned beef and cabbage in my crock pot.  YUM! I also grow hops and now have my neighbor addicted to making his own beer so will run a copy of this over to him.  Thanks for posting! :).

This was an excellent recipe! I normally don't use recipes for beer or cider from recipes sites like this (usually get them from forums or friends), but I happened across this and liked the combination of ingredients.
I just cracked open a bottle now and am very happy with the flavor. It's a nicely rounded beer, that, if made with a dark extract, is very dark and pleasantly "roasty." The hops don't make it as bitter as an India Pale Ale, it's just shy of that, but the bitterness is just right. It's perfect for a cool fall day here in New England- a good dark and roasty tasting beer. I imagine it would be good too if made to be a lager. Thanks for posting this great recipe!
