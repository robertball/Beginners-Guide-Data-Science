This is a great basic Sausage and Gravy! My husband grew up eating this stuff and introduced it to me about 10 years ago. It is a family staple now. A note on the gravy: DO NOT DRAIN THE SAUSAGE. You need the grease inorder to bring the gravy together, adding butter will drastically change the flavor. We use red pepper flakes and toss it in as the sausage is cooking. You can also use the "hot" flavored sausage to get an extra layer of flavor. Make sure that you completly stir in the flour and alow it to cook with the sausage and grease for a minute or two before addin the milk, this will take out any "pastey taste". Add the milk slowly, I have used skim, 1%, all the way to cream, usually whatever I have on hand. I have found that the less fat your milk has, the less milk you will need to create the gravy! Great on biscuts, toast, cornbread, mashed potatoes, and more...yummmm :)

I didn't have Jimmy Dean crumbles but I did have a roll of the ground sausage I used. I couponed a couple days ago and had a few canisters of whomp biscuits so this was perfect for that. I did add a little red pepper flake. Whole skillet? Gone. Great winter snowy morning breakfast. NOTE: For most white gravy mixes, I use equal amounts butter and flour and make a roux in the skillet before I wisk in the milk. It makes for a better gravy.

This is exactly how I have been making it and my husband and I love it. Caution... eating biscuits and gravy at resturants will not taste as good anymore. :)

We had this last night for dinner; real comfort food for a cold night.  The only thing I do different is remove the sausage when done and set aside, add 1/4 cup butter to the pan, make the gravy, add back the sausage and often add a fried egg on top, or fry some crushed hashbrowns until crispy to top off the dish.

Cheater's recipe!  LOL...the instructions for the gravy were good, and I suppose if you are pressed for time, refrigerated canned biscuits are okay....but homemade are so much better, especially since there are recipes for the biscuits that can be mixed the night before and cooked in the morning.

We make our own bisquits and use half and half cream instead of the milk. There is no other sausage that we use but Jimmy Dean's!  The recipe listed is a decent quick peparation. We double our recipe since we always seem to gobble more!

Ever since I started using this recipe years ago, I can't eat anyone else's biscuits and gravy (neither can my kids!)  Be prepared to increase the quantity if you have extra people, many will want seconds! Also, stick with Jimmy Dean, (I use the raw ground kind in a tube, HOT is great!) whenever I try a different sausage, I always regret it! I also like to add a couple Tablespoons of butter before the flour.  If you're like me and only have skim milk in the fridge, you can add a can of FF evaporated milk to make it creamier!  I sometimes make huge batches for big camping parties, Just make at home, freeze in gallon ziplocs and reheat at the campsite (take a big bag of pre-baked bisuits).  Good over scrambled eggs too! Tabasco or Cayenne is a nice condiment for me!  Try these, you'll find out that it's easy to make gravy!

Wow. This was my first time ever making biscuits and gravy and it came out awesome, which doesn't happen too often when I try a new recipe. I'm 4 months pregnant and have been really craving this so I found some nitrate free Jimmy Dean ground sausage (in the roll) and used Grands frozen buttermilk biscuits. The only downside was that because I used a whole roll of sausage I had to double the recipe and it made tons - guess I'll be freezing some as my husband won't eat it. Also, it of course took me longer - about 45 mins to make. I used others suggestions and did not drain the sausage but I did add a pat of butter before the flour. Also, I added the flour slowly and cooked for a bit before the milk, then did the same with that. Great consistency, no lumps! This is just as good if not better than the local diner's and no nitrates!

This was my first time making biscuits and gravy.  My family loved these.  I may add a bit more flower next time to make the gravy thicker.  Great flavor and easy to make!

Made this recipe for our ThanksGiving Breakfast! Really simple and quick and by the time I was done, everyone was awake and hungry. I'm just an adolescent sooo yea(: Earned me some points for the day. I had exams the next week, so with another package of sausage crumbles I fixed it up again for my first exam day. Extremely filling, and rendered me capable of concentrating throughout the day. Best breakfast I've had for any school year and a pleasant change. Family loved it!

This has been one of my favorite recipes for years! My mom used to make biscuits and gravy like this for me as a kid, and gave me the recipe so I can make them myself a few years back. Now I make it at least a couple times a month :)

WOW!! So quick and easy and DELICIOUS!!!  I used Jimmy Dean TURKEY Sausage Crumbles (after all, it is Thanksgiving!) and it turned out great. I didn't need to add any fat, it was fine without.  Will be making this again and again.

Great recipe!  I just make three small changes.  First, I use turkey sausage instead of pork.  Because he turkey does not produce as many dippings, I add about two tablespoons of butter before making the roux. I also use buttermilk instead of regular milk because it really enhances the flavor of the gravy.  And, contrary to popular belief, it doesn't have to be fattening.   I will also agree with the addition of red pepper flakes if you are looking for a bit of a kick in your gravy.

Very similar to McDonald's sausage gravy - I like it a little spicier though plus i think adding butter prior to the flour is an important step

I used this as a basis for the gravy.. I had buttermilk to use up, so I made biscuits from scratch and I also had 2 large country sausage links already cooked up in the fridge. I diced them up and heat them in the pan, sprinkled them evenly with flour (no measuring) and then added milk until it was the consistency I wanted. Seasoned with salt and pepper to my liking, and there you go.. super quick, delicious meal!

Perfecet! Easy! Delish! Comfort food!  I had a roll of Jimmy Dean sausage that I used.  I did not drain (really not greasey) put the flour in after sausage was cooked and stired until all the white was gone then just poured in the milk and stirred.  I put my temp on med high heat the whole time and did not stir the whole time.  That makes this recipe really fast and really easy.  will for sure make over and over

In a way, I didn't really make this recipe because I couldn't find the crumbles at my local store, so I used Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and cooked it myself. I have to say, though, that the recipe is so easy to follow, so easy to make perfectly, that I am giving it five stars. I'm not good at gravy, but this came out so smooth and creamy. Loved it! It reheats well in the microwave, too.

Perfect! I used just over a half roll of Jimmy Dean Sausage and cooked the rest in patties. We had lefotvers for dinner the next night! Also adjusted to 2C of 2% milk and 1/2 C heavy cream and added a lot of pepper, but otherwise just like Grandma used to make!

Instead of using the sausage crumbles, I cook a roll of JD Sausage.  I've used the rest of the ingredients as listed and it's the best biscuits and gravy!  Very easy, too!

This was super easy.  I made it with plain store-brand sausage, and drained it.  I also made homemade biscuits; I got the recipe off a package of Kroger self-rising flour and those were easy too:  2 c. flour, 1/2 c. veg. oil, and 3/4 c. buttermilk, mixed together and dropped by tablespoons on a cookie sheet, bake at 450F for 10 minutes.  I'm more of a health-food person, but my husband loved this b-fast.  Thank you!

I love and will only use Jimmy Dean Sausage. Just found this recipe, but have been making my Sausage Gravy this exact way for many years. I use the original roll sausage and after it is browned there is just the right amount of fat in the skillet, you don't have to drain, just stir in flour and go from there.  I make this for my kids everytime they come home for a visit. Sausage Gravy, Biscuits & Scrambled Eggs: great for breakfast or supper.

So easy! I didn't think about it and bought "reduced fat" sasage so I had to add in a little olive oil to stir the four into. Sounds weird, but it still tasted great. Thanks so much. My husband was very impressed!

Instead of flour try using Wondra. It is a very fine flour especially made for gravy. First I added the milk, then sprinkled in Wondra, and mixed everything in the pan using a whisk. I also used fresh pork sausage patties and broke them down with a fork while cooking them in the pan.  Yum.

This was my first gravy-making attempt and it couldn't have gone any better!  All I have to say is: WOW.  I used a whole roll of sausage and threw in a healthy-sized glob of butter before flouring.  This is now my go-to recipe for gravy!  No more envelope mixes for us!

I grew up eating biscuits and gravy and enjoy them very much. I have until now never cooked the sausage gravy myself so I was not too sure how it would be. Since my lovely wife was not going to cook it for me, I decided to give it a try for myself. I am glad I did! The gravy came out perfect. I did modify the recipe slightly by adding a small chopped onion and ended up adding a stick of real butter because the sausage didn't produce enough fat. The end result was very tasty as easy to prepare. I believe the can of biscuits took longer to cook than the sausage gravy. I know this was a bit long winded but all in all great recipe, thanks!!

This was so easy to make! Just a few ingredients and a delcious gravy! I made, "Teena's overnight buttermilk biscuits" from this site to go with the gravy! Yummy! I had a roll of sausage and just used 1/4 of it cooked. While cooking the sausage in a pan, I also had a small saucepan with the milk and flour on low heat cooking and thickened. Once the sausage was done, I dumped it into the thickened milk and added salt and pepper.  Will be making again! Thanks!

My advice is to take the sausage out once browned, add more oil as needed and then add the flour to the hot oil to cook. Literally the best biscuits and gravy comes from allowing the flour in the pan to cook until it is a dark brick color. Then add back in the sausage and add the milk! The flavor from the darker cooked flour cannot be beat, I wouldn't eat it (or make it) any other way! Sometimes the gravy won't get thick as fast with the sausage, so sprinkling a little more flour on the sausage when you put it back in the pan will help it thicken even more:D

Had a couple changes but it turned out great - didn't get to take a picture before the plates were scraped clean! I used Jennie O turkey sausage and added a little butter once it was done cooking, before adding the flour. Only had 1% milk, but didn't reduce it so the gravy was a little runny and had to cook it a little longer. Still didn't have enough gravy for a small can of biscuits, so I might have to make more gravy tomorrow morning!

I like the idea of removing the sausage while you finish the gravy and then add the sausage back. I have found it gets really thick. Oddly, Skim thickens faster than whole or cream. Sausage gravy is always better with a homemade biscuit; however, this is a good recipe for gravy.

my wife put her own spin on this recipe. The gravy needed a little more flavor, so she added a beef bouillon cube. We used Hatfield sausage instead of Jimmy Dean, it was less fatty. Maybe that was the reason it needed to be tweaked. But it was fantastic. Unfortunately, we ate it before we even thought of taking a picture. But I am sure we will be making this recipe again soon.

Excellent, simple recipe with delicious results.   Used all natural pork sausage and organic half and half instead of milk.  You would not think that something so simple and easy would taste so good.  So much better than the biscuit gravy mix you get in the package.  This tastes like what you would get at a good breakfast type restaurant.  The other thing that made it so good is a seasoning blend I use that is called Reese All Purpose Steak Salt.  It is a blend of salt, pepper, garlic powder and celery seed.  The garlic is very subtle, all together, the way they blended them has enhanced many a dish I've made.  As for this gravy, my whole family loved it!  Because it is so easy - no more packages of gravy for us.

Cooked this for my family this morning and they absolutely loved it...I had not seen this recipe here but had seen it used in a military cook-off MANY years ago...using Jimmy Deans sausage.  I added some sliced mushrooms to the gravy, fried eggs atop of the biscuit before the gravy.  Couldn't believe it...we ate the whole thing!

This was a really good basic sausage gravy. To make it even better and spicier, I added chili powder and a little bit of cayenne.

Super easy!  With 5 teenagers who are STARVING when they wake up - I am all about quick and easy.  I do use our own sausage as we live on a farm - but the gravy portion is great tasting and did I say EASY!?

My grandmother taught me to make sausage gravy and I usually just wing it with no recipe, adjusting the proportions of ingredients until it is right.  But I needed to make about 5 cups for an office function so I needed some certainty on the yield so I used this recipe and doubled it.  Used one pound of sausage in a tube and crumbled it as I browned it.  

It came out really well.  I had to add a few TBS of butter and oil as I mixed in the flour to get the right roux consistency, otherwise it would have clumped up too much.  Came out very nice though.

I love cooking this for breakfast!  However, I prefer mine to be seasoned a bit more.  Especially since I use the sausage that comes in a "tube".  If I am using the mild version, I add paprika and a couple dashes of cayenne to give it a little spice.

Delicious! The recipe call for 9 oz sausage, but I used the whole roll, which was 1lb, so I added more flour and milk. It came out with a lot of gravy. I used HEBs Whataburger sausage and it's good!!! Also, I didn't need to add any salt pepper because sausage had enough flavor.

I am not much of a cook (probably why I am single) LOL.. I never learned how to make a roux.. this was easy to follow and I didn't mess it up. My daughter who is a picky eater asked for seconds :) I added some red pepper flakes for a little more kick.. beware.. this makes a lot. I have left overs for tomorrow or dinner tonight..

I used homemade sausage that was light in fat so I added a 1/4 cup of butter to it. It might have thickened a bit quicker than making the gravy separate from the sausage so I'll probably keep making it like this in the future.

We've searched a long time to find a good biscuits and gravy recipe.  This is now our go too recipe. Perfect thickness, not to peppery, and hard to stop at one serving!

I made this for an office breakfast and it got rave reviews.  I added a couple good shakes of crushed red pepper flakes and it was fantastic!  Made it again for the family the following Sunday.  It takes just a few minutes that it makes going out to breakfast a thing of the past!  Yummm!

EASY, FAST, and DELICIOUS!  Just like grandma used to make!  We used the whole wheat biscuits, turkey sausage and lowered the amount of milk a bit as we used fat free, lactose free milk.  I only suggest you double the recipe as two adults and two toddlers ate all of this and were still asking for more!

Super easy and tastes great!  Feel free to get spicy sausage if that is preferred.    Also this recipe is not low fat or gluten free.

Of all the biscuit and gravy recipes I've tried, this one is is our favorite because it is super simple and tastes great!  

We always use flaky biscuits and HOT sausage.

This is exactly how I make mine and it is the best sausage gravy! I like Tennessee Pride sausage. No butter is needed as long as you don't drain your sausage and the grease helps to season your gravy. Make sure to cook the flour for about a minute before adding the milk. This a great "stick to your ribs" winter breakfast. I also make it for dinner.

Great basic recipe. Much better if you make the biscuits from scratch, but this is pretty good. The only change I would make is to include some fried hash browns on top of the biscuit halves, then cover it all with the gravy. My grandmother always made biscuits & gravy this way. She called it a Haystack.

My whole family loved this!  Great basic milk gravy and is wonderful as is :) I did add a little milk at the end because it thickened a little overmuch waiting for dinner to finish...but was great!

I followed the recipe and used fat free milk.  My husband couldn't stop raving about them.  I made biscuits from scratch because I didn't have any others on hand.  We will definitely be making this again!  They were so easy to make and very tasty!

wonderful recipe-I didn't have sausage crumbles but did have a pkg of Jimmy Dean sausage which I browned up while bisdcuits were baking.  While it didn't seem like there was a lot of fat/grease in the pan, it worked perfectly with the amount of flour and milk mentioned above.  Delicious!

This was really great. I did as some others suggested and melted 3Tbsp of butter with the flour to cook out the flavor. I also used vegetarian sausage wondering how it might work. It was wonderful. Brand matters tho. I used Lightlyfe Gimme Lean Veggie Sausage (14oz). I used olive oil to brown a s break up the sausage then melted the butter added flour stirred the paste for two mins. Then added the milk salt pepper and red pepper flakes and finished the cooking. For biscuits I subbed homemade and used the E-Z Drop Biscuit recipe from All Recipes. Super easy quick and tasty. Next time I will add some sharp cheddar to the biscuit mix!

Ok...here’s the deal..I’ve made biscuits and gravy before but it was NOTHING compared to this recipe. Sunday’s i usually make a big breakfast for my family and slave over eggs, bacon, pancakes and whatever else we are in the mood for. I had six high school boys that woke up at my house ready to eat and they polished this off! This literally took 29 min to make and was the easiest, most delicious recipe! I basically tripled if not quadrupled this recipe as I just fed 9 men and there barely any left for me :(  bit that’s ok bc seeing these guys eating like rockstars

Made this just as written, except cooked my own package of Jimmy Dean pork sausage rather than using a pre-crumble bag because I couldn't find one.  Taste was great and it was very easy and quick.  My only thing is the serving number - no way we could have gotten eight out of this.  If you only give each person one biscuit and a little sauce, maybe, but my kids each took two biscuits and we served 3.5 people.  Great recipe though.  I'd make extra sauce if you have more people.

This is so quick and easy and really delicious! We can't have dairy, so we use almond milk instead of milk and it is delicious. We put it over Pillsbury Grands biscuits. One of my hubby's favorites!

Easy sausage gravy that is practically foolproof. I have also used this recipe for making bacon gravy for which my mother was famous for. Just use cooked bacon bits and a little of the cooked bacon grease. I also make from scratch biscuits,or ones I make from Bisquick.

This turned out great.  Will make it again.  I made just a few changes by using some real butter, 1/3 of the milk I substituted with buttermilk and continuously stirred over medium low heat.  Everyone was impressed and the leftovers will not go to waste.

I love biscuits and gravy, but I add cheesy scrambled eggs to it. Make as stated, but scramble eggs with 1 slice of American cheese per egg to the biscuit before topping with gravy. Also, I use Maple flavored sausage! Mmmm Good!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe since I used homemade whole wheat flour biscuits for myself, and regular old white bread with a side of scrambled eggs for my son. But the major part of the recipe is the gravy anyway. It turned out good, as expected. After it thickened, prior to adding salt & pepper, I tasted it and decided to add some pepper and garlic and onion powder, and omit the salt. But that's personal taste preference, I tend to not like salt. Such a basic recipe that turned out so well and is easily costumizable. It's also great to make ahead and reheat in the morning for a quick and easy hot and filling breakfast. Will definitely make again.

The only thing that would make this better is to use homemade biscuits. To the person who thinks that you need to add grease to this... you must have a cast-iron stomach! This recipe calls for pork sausage crumbles that have already been cooked, yes you can make this and cook the sausage, but you DO want to drain the grease! The flour and milk will thicken without the need of grease.

Usually double the gravy. So good! Perfect consistency. Watch how much salt you add because it can get salty quickly.

Great basic recipe, with a few additions & changes this gets a 5+star rating on our opinion.  using my cast iron fry pan: first I added 8 slices of thick cut bacon, drain the grease from the 1st. 4 slice batch, retain the grease from the 2nd. batch, add to that 1 small chopped onion cook until just about translucent, add the sausage cook though and set aside. Add 2 pads of butter to pan, whisk in 1 tablespoon at a time up to 1/4 cup flour, cooking until just golden brown, then add cream/milk about 1/4 cup at a time, add salt & pepper as needed bring to slow boil. in the meantime chop the bacon into small crumbles (the smaller the better), add the bacon crumbles back to cream/milk sauce cook 2 to 4 minutes, then add the sausage onion mixture back to pan, cook another 6 to 10 minutes. make sure you continuously to whisk cream/milk sauce and once you add the meats back stir often. Serve with gravy mixture on top baked hafed cut biscuits.  OMG SOOOO VERY GOOD!!!! the only problem at the portions above this would not serve 8 adults, more like 4.

Very tasty!  Couldn't believe how easy it was to make gravy that way! My sausage was from a butcher, so not much fat!  Added a little olive oil before I added the flour!  Very nice!  I will make again!!

I made this gravy recipe this morning it was good, but I used to much flour so it was to thick. I will not use as much next time.

Delicious! I followed the advice from other reviewers and added 1/4c butter (mixing it with the flour before putting it into the pan). I also removed the cooked sausage from the pan, made the gravy, and then added the meat back in.  Yummy!!

Hubby suggested I could open my own restaurant with this gravy. I added a couple shakes of chili powder (couldn't find the red pepper flakes as others have suggested) and even my picky four year old asked for more. Next time I'll make homemade biscuits!

This is a good basic recipe. I am not big on biscuits and gravy but my husband loves it. He rated this a 7/8 and said there was too much sausage relative to the gravy. So I think, if I make this again, I will use half of the sausage in the recipe (but all of the grease) and all of the gravy called in the recipe. Overall, a good base recipe.

I am new to cooking and don't typically order Biscuits and Gravy for breakfast, but we have "Breakfast Adventures Friday" at our house and all 4 kids and my husband seemed to really like it.  The only thing was that the recipe barely served 5.  Maybe the biscuits I bought were too big, but I had 3 left over from the package of 8..but in the future I will double the gravy portion of the recipe

This recipe is perfect. I've made it with turkey sausage as well-- just add 1 Tbsp butter for extra fat content. This gravy saves great in the fridge for leftovers. Just add a little milk when reheating to thin out the texture.

This was very good and only takes like 10 minutes.  I don't eat it over bisquits since I can't eat bread.  I add two over medium eggs and shredded cheese.  It's delicious!

This was my first time making a gravy, and it was so easy! I read some of the reviews which told me not to drain the grease (Thank You Guys!) and it turned out really well. I agree with some of the other users that it may be beneficial to use spicy sausage or maybe more seasoning, but this was really good. Thanks!

I was hungry for biscuits and gravy and this is the first recipe I found.  I was happy to see how easily the gravy came together in a short amount of time.  Before serving, I added some cayenne pepper, red pepper flake, and a little seasoned salt. It totally hit the spot.  I will be making these again.

I made my own gluten free biscuits with Bisquick Gluten-Free baking mix.  The gravy was good though I wanted more gravy in ratio with the sausage.  I will make this again as it was quick and tasty.

Great and simple recipe. For a twist on the classic we added sweet curry powder to the Greeley and made it a curry or herb biscuits. Yummy

I used 1/2 roll of Jimmy Dean sausage because that's what I had.  It was great! Even my picky husband liked it! 
I did need to add about 1/2 Tbsp of butter after adding the flour because there was not enough grease from the sausage alone. Next time I will make more gravy as we like more gravy to sausage ratio. But the taste was spot on!
Thanks for the recipe.

If you add a cup and a half of non dairy creamer, before thickening it up and after you come to a slow boil, will give your gravy a richer and a slightly sweeter flavor.

only differences:  almond milk since I never have cow's milk in my house and I had to use about 1/3 cup of flour to thicken it to the right consistency.  I made homemade biscuits rather than buying the canned.

Super simple. Used Pillsbury Grands Buttery biscuits and a lb. roll of Jimmy Dean Hot sausage with 3/4 C. flour and about 5 C. milk. a bit of salt and probably a T. pepper. Quick, Easy and Yummy.

Super-easy and tasty.  Added a sprinkle of sage when adding the flour.  Use hot Italian sausage meat for a kick - although it may be necessary to drain off some fat before adding flour and milk.

Made this tonight for dinner for my husband and 4 kids.  They all loved it.  So quick and simple to make.  Love that the sausage crumbles are already prepared.  Very easy for me as my family is very active and dinners together are hard to come by.  Will definitely make this again.

Love how easy and basic this recipe is!  Tried other biscuit and gravy recipe(using bacon) and it did not work out well.  But this one tastes the best to my liking, just like my favorite restaurant.   Mahalo post poster!

So easy, though once I'd got the flour and milk in I played it by ear with the gravy. Roommate gave it rave reviews, which is always nice!

Great recipe did this for tea on saturday and all my family loved it! The Biscuits (like plain British scones) were so light and fluffy and the sausagemeat was yum! I added a tablespoon of cream cheese to the gravy and it was really creamy. Also a tip, don't bother to use cutters to cut out the biscuits! Just roll into 10 equal balls and place on baking trays lined with greaseproof paper, then flatten slightly and bake! Really great recipe, def a keeper! Served mine with sweetcorn/corn on cob!

I cooked a 16oz roll of Jimmy Dean sausage instead of the 9.6oz because I wanted it to be a little more hearty.  Turned out great I will be making it again.

Great easy tasty recipe.  I use the regular ground sausage though, and brown it in the pan first.

This was delicious. I added some bacon grease to the sausage before I added the flour and it made it that much better. Paired it with flaky layers buttermilk biscuits. The whole family loved it.

Very simple yet very delicious sausage biscuits gravy recipe that the whole family gobbled up. Will be very easy to make healthier next time with using my own biscuit recipe and fresh ground sage pork sausage and barely taking very much longer to prepare.

Delicious. I grew up eating my stepmom’s biscuits & gravy and came to crave it on my weekends home from college and military leaves. This tastes exactly like hers. ???? My mom loves it, it’s definitely on the make again list.

If you need a quick and warming recipe it works! I found it a bit bland until I added some sage, thyme and cut the milk with chicken broth. Even with a whole lb of sausage in there my husband and oldest son cleaned us out and now there’s none for lunch tomorrow!

Great recipe! Important step to avoid LUMPY gravy... after browning sausage, remove the sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the grease in the pan. Add flour to the grease... cook a few min then SLOWLY add milk while whisking to avoid lumps. After all of milk is added... then return the meat to gravy.

I substituted for homemade biscuits. Which I had to find a different recipe for.  Cause “buy biscuits” is not a recipe for biscuits. Good gravy though.

Used a bit more flour and milk and it came out thicker then planned and used a roll of Jimmy Dean's sausage. So thicker and neater and still turned out great. Hit it with some red pepper flakes and woke up the house..

This is such an easy recipe and turned out perfect. I used a 16 oz roll of sausage cooked and broken up. The rest of the measurements stayed the same. The gravy was thick and flavorful.

This is a great basic recipe,  I use it all the time (when I make biscuits and gravy anyways). I like to change up the type of sausage and add some sage,  unless it's maple breakfast sausage...then I might add some nutmeg! very good!

It was AMAZING!!! I did add more milk as i found the mixture too thick for my liking, but i guess thats a personal preference.  My husband said it was way better than any gravy hes had in a restaurant,  and i agree. Its a home run!

It was delicious. We actually used a full pound of pork sausage, 1/2 cup of flour and used 2% milk (2 1/2 cups) and it was fantastic! Glad I made this.

OK to use more sausage if you like it meatier.  I like half spicy/half regular sausage.  Tasted a little flour-ey the second time I made it  So good, cant' stop eating it!

Very good, quick and easy. I used almond milk and only had to add  about 1 2/3cups. Did add a Tbs butter after cooking sausage and before flour. Originally measured out 2cups of milk, but added slowly as another reviewer suggested and it worked out great with less since my milk had less fat. Used rolled sausage about same measurement

Every year I go on a golf outing with 8 guys and everyone is responsible for making a dinner or a breakfast. I upscaled this by 4x and had to use 2 pots and it came out great. The only gotcha was it took longer than I expected to thicken the gravy up - I didn't want to burn it but ensuring it gets up to that low light bubbly boil and just stirring a lot and being patient paid off. I added crushed red chilli flakes for a nice little kick as well - the guys loved it! This recipe is doable for any amateur - just follow the instructions.

My husband absolutely adores this recipe!  Biscuits and gravy is his favorite breakfast  food, and this recipe is a great one!  We made it as stated the first time, the second time we altered it just a smidge.  We felt like we wanted a little more gravy for the amount of sausage so we now use 1/3 cup of flour and 4 cups of milk.  Consistency is the same, but you've got what I think is a better gravy to sausage ratio.  I swear we've started making this 2-3 times a month!  Delicious!

I've made this recipe numerous times and each time the sausage gravy turns out a touch different as I always kick it up a bit.  This is an easy comfort meal and is always a go-to whenever I'm short of time, especially in the wet and cool days of Fall here in Vancouver.

Soooooo good. Wish I could have gotten the flour lumps smoothed out but tasted amazing and wasn't an issue with all the crumbled up sausage log in there anyway. Removed sausage after browning so not to overcook, not much grease left so added 1 T butter with flour then gradually added milk (plus extra cup). Salt, pepper. Thickened, added sausage back in. Delicious.

When cravings hit, this is a fantastic filling meal that hits all the right spots.
Quick and easy to make and delicious.
I use the Jennie-O turkey sausage instead of pork and it comes out great!

Simple delicious recipe.  I used a 1.25 pounds of breakfast sausage from our local store.  Ended up using 1/2 cup flour and 3 cups milk.    Use enough flour to soak up grease and enough milk  to thin out mixture.  I had no idea it was so easy to make sausage gravy this way!

This has become the only way I make sausage gravy,  and it has ruined getting it in restaurants.   This recipe works every time and is absolutely delicious!!!  I use maple sausage, as we like the sweetness.   Also I add a little extra milk to thin it a little bit.

I have been using this particular recipe for 40 years. However, when I pour in the milk I also stir in a teaspoon of either fresh are ground sage. It really brings the flavors together! Also, I use the Frozen Pillsbury Grand biscuits let them thaw out a little bit. The biscuits rise and tastes just like homemade with the same texture!

I made the gravy in a cast iron skillet and used hot sausage instead. Split the biscuit, added a fried egg, topped with gravy and shredded cheese for the most satisfying, scrumptious “country eggs Benedict”.

Super easy meal to prepare.  My mom always made this when I was growing up.  My dad loved it in the AF.  So it was kind of a staple, or go to when things got a little lean in the budget.  We always keep Jimmy Dean sausage, in the freezer for last minute meals.

I’ve been wanting to make this since we love sausage gravy over biscuits.  I finally had the ingredients on hand except I had sage sausage instead of maple sausage.  This recipe is so easy to make and I have enough left-over so that my husband will be able to enjoy it for breakfast later in the week.  What a great easy and very tasty meal!

This recipe is awesome and easy! I used less milk and added a tablespoon of butter after browning the hot sausage. Takes almost exactly the same time to bake the biscuits and make the gravy. Thanks for this one!

I made one small change. I fried the bacon in the pan and then cooked the sausage in afterwards.
Other than that it was amazing!! Super easy and in no time at all.

Easy to follow recipe and it turned out perfect! I used all the same measurements for the gravy, but used low fat milk, deer sausage, and homemade biscuits. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this using some frozen sausage I had on hand and added maple syrup to it during the cooking process before adding the flour and remaining gravy ingredients. We poured it over J.P.’s Big Daddy Biscuits - recipe on this site. My family of four thought it was very good.

To try and keep down the calories and add some flavor I made mine with 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup almond milk. Try it. You will like it!

First time I made this on a craving whim at 2am. Smelled so good it rose the husband out of bed! It's really good, needs a tad bit more flour than 1/4 cup but maybe that's just me?

This is a super easy recipe that I’ve been making for years when all the kids and grandkids come home. One addition I make that sends this over the top - a tablespoon or two of bacon grease! Yes, it adds calories but the taste is worth it! And I make it for special occasions and not as a weekly breakfast.

My man friend asked me to make biscuits and gravy.  I had never made it before so I needed an easy recipe that was similar to his grandmother's.  This  recipe is super easy and so tasty- a real comfort food.  He loved it!!   And now asks for it.

It was a good and simple sausage gravy. Tasted alright but I took it upon myself to add 1/2 tbsp of cayenne to it, and the spice took it to another level for me.

I have made this many times, and I found that I enjoy substituting sausage crumbles for Great Value brand Hot Sausage, and use honey flaky buttermilk biscuits for a perfect blend of sweet and spicy.

I used a breakfast sausage recipe (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16359/breakfast-sausage/)  since Jimmy Dean  is not sold in Japan. As well as hand made biscuits since pre-made are also not sold here. Learned a lot! American classic!

This was the first time I've ever made gravy, so I was a tad nervous. It was a last minute decision to make it, so I just used the sausage patties I already had. Unfortunately, I made too much sausage (8 patties), but it was still good. I just have to make a note next time not to cook so much sausage. I will definitely be making it again!

I used 1 cup buttermilk (since I had it on hand for the biscuits) and 1.5 cups whole milk but that was a mistake as it made it a little sour. Otherwise excellent recipe!

Fantastic basic recipe!  I was initially concerned that there wasn’t enough flour to thicken this but it ended up the perfect thick gravy consistency without becoming sludge.  Would also recommend you add your own seasoning to this as it can be a bit bland.  I added 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning and 1/8 tsp each of marjoram and thyme.  I also added a few red pepper flakes but omit if you use a spicy sausage.  Enjoy finding your favorite flavor combo!

I made this for breakfast this morning. It was delicious! The only thing I did was add a teaspoon of minced onion and I used Johnsonville Italian sausages that I took out of the casing. I did drain my sausage. You don’t need that much grease! I used 1% milk and it bonded just fine. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is the easiest and most delicious breakfast recipe I have ever made. I was worried that the biscuits wouldn’t be as good as homemade but I was pleasantly surprised with the Grands biscuits. We love to put a sunny side egg on top of the biscuit and then cover with the gravy. Oooooh it’s so good!

First time making sausage gravy. Store only had Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage Crumbles, so I opted for that. Added a little butter to the pan for grease factor so the flour would stick. I made sure the flour was on all the turkey sausage before pouring the milk in. Followed the rest of the directions for cooking. Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, and a little crushed red pepper. Used Pillsbury Buttery Biscuits. Turned out perfect.

Made this for my son who was home on leave, he closed his eyes and said so good.  Momma Bird* feels so good to send him off with a delicious meal in his belly!  Thanks for helping with creating a memory that will last a life time.

Made this as stated and doubled it. It was great!  I made it for a brunch I was going to. I just cooked everything and then dumped the gravy into a slow cooker to transport and keep warm.

This is the recipe I use every Christmas morning. Super easy and delicious. My son-in-law loves it.  Although I use Bob Evans breakfast sausage.  I  am sure it is just as soon using Jimmy Dean sausage.

I really like this method of gravy making and this has been my go to recipe. I like to make it with chub sausage. My tips: don’t drain the sausage and let the flour cook for a few minutes with the sausage before adding the milk. It cooks out the floury pasty flavor and I think makes the gravy taste even better. This gravy tastes even better the next day, so if you’re making it for a party you could make the night before and refrigerate it and then just heat it back up on the stove in the morning. I made it for Christmas breakfast and it received a thumbs up. It makes a lot of food without a lot of effort. If the gravy gets too thick just add a splash of milk to thin it back out.

Best ever and so simple! I tried adding butter like some other reviewers, my husband really likes it, but I think it’s just great without. Tried this for the first time several months ago and now it’s a family favorite!!!

Been using this recipe for a few years now. I did not grow up eating this stuff so using canned biscuits doesn’t hinder this dish for me. Simple, yet so flavorful. I like to add a few dashes of cayenne, or use spicy sausage for an added kick.

It was a good basic recipe to get the consistency right, but the flavor was severely lacking.  Will try adding herbs and spices next time...the only flavor was in the sausage.

This is absolutely delicious!  It's a quick, GREAT breakfast treat!  I never heard of "sausage crumbles", so I just bought the regular bulk (raw) sausage in the roll.  Since then, I've read that the sausage crumbles are already cooked.  My question is, how do they generate enough grease to mix with flour?

As it turns out, this is the exact recipe my mom taught me years ago. I've been making it for years but it's been a while since the last time so I looked it up. The only difference is that I've always eyeballed the ingredients. This time I used the measurements from this recipe and it tasted just like it always has so I guess my approximate measurements were very close to, if not precisely the same as this recipe. This is a recipe I can memorize so now I can fool people into believing I'm a pro.

Mixed reviews in my house on this one.  My husband liked it, me not so much.  I didn't care for the canned biscuits or the flavor of the gravy.  It was easy.  Might try it again with some changes.

Five star rating because not only is it good by itself, it has room for improvement! The gravy has a good taste to it, but left alone, it kinda tastes like water. However! That can be improved ^^

Fantastic! I add a little maple syrup to my sausage before cooking. The right amount of salt is key. If you add to much it’s hard to bounce back from. I make this for my bf whose never had sausage gravy and he loves it.

Overall it was ok. I probably wouldn’t make this again. I think you should make a roux before adding the milk. I found this to be a little bland. I even added some red pepper flake like others recommended. That was probably the only thing I liked about this. It was worth a shot.

So I didn’t have biscuits or Jimmy Dean crumbles but I tried to make it work with sage sausage and bacon. Salt and pepper was definitely not the best seasoning for this dish! Not sure what I could do to up the flavor profile but the bacon definitely helped. Oh, I toasted bread since I didn’t have biscuits!

I loved this recipe, I did make one change, I used 1/8 of a teaspoon of white pepper instead of black! It gave the gravy a little kick

Easy and quick. Did not realize making Biscuits and Gravy was so easy, if I did I would of been making from scratch long ago. I do not use the refrigerated biscuits. It is best to make your own or buy the frozen biscuits. I also cook 1/2 a roll of spicy breakfast sausage versus the pre-cooked.

I made this today for breakfast. It was amazing! I didn’t even need to add salt, only pepper. I years 2% milk so I think that’s why I needed to add about a tablespoon of flour at the end to finish the thickening process.

I did include the bacon and I prefer my gravy without.  I  added lots of pepper which I love, but for the picture, I didn't add any to the top which would add more interest to the photo.  It is a good recipe and as usual, Chef  John did a great job providing the method of how to make Sausage Gravy.

Fast, simple, and delicious!! Just be cautious when adding salt/pepper to taste....my sausage already had lots of salt in it so the gravy needed very little (if any) added.

We used 16 oz package Jimmy Deans ground sausage, bumped flour up to 1/3 of a cup. And about 3 cups of milk.
All we had were Hawaii'n Sweet Biscuits, but it still came out very good. Was nice to a little sweet and savory flavors together. We really liked it. Also, this is very QUICK AND EASY to make!

The recipe was super easy and doesn’t call for a lot of ingredients. The only issue was that even after adding salt and pepper the gravy was bland. My recommendation and what I did was to add a tablespoon of salted butter during the simmering process. Once I added the butter, the gravy was absolutely perfect.

Excellent recipe! Changed it up a bit and used butter prior to adding flour. Added the milk just a little at a time. Then, after seasoning to taste added a pinch of cayenne. Wow!

I finally got it right. I grew up in Texas with chicken fried steak as a staple but still have not been able to make a perfect white gravy...until now. Well, it wasn't perfect as I needed to add more milk and could still taste a little more of the flour than I wanted but otherwise it was good. I added more milk to thin it out and next time will cook the flour a little longer before adding the milk so the pasty taste gets cooked out. Thanks for the recipe!

I always season my sausage with crushed red pepper, black pepper, and garlic salt. Do not drain the sausage. Add equal parts of butter and flower before slowly stirring in milk to get your desired consistency of gravy. Season again with another shake of garlic salt, Black pepper, and crushed red pepper!

I use Italian Sausage, Cut it from the casing and fry that up.  I would eat all Hot, the one who I must obey says no, add half with no heat.  The use 1% Milk and Rue I have made in a cast Iron Skillet and refrigerated, is added as needed.  I am Canadian who found this dish in Waffle Houses down in the southern USA and fell in love with it.

I made it for company and it was good and easy, when making for just home folks I much prefer home made biscuits.  Jimmy D sausage over the decades is still a quality product.

This is soooooooo simple to make and so good! It's fun to improvise on some points, like different seasonings in the sausage... try maple Jimmy Dean! 
Follow the recipe though... adding milk before flour will give you different results in consistency.

Great recipe, one time I did use a cheaper sausage, don't do that...it was no where near as good. 
Stick with premium brand sausage! (And don't drain the grease)
Also when you add the flour, get it mixed well before adding the milk. And then make sure to turn off the heat BEFORE the gravy gets as thick as you want, because the gravy will continue to thicken in the pan.

This is a great recipe. It says biscuits and gravy but it seems like it's more for the gravy part and you can use any kind of biscuit you want. Homemade or premade biscuits.

This recipe is great!  There's a restaurant in my town that has the absolute best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.  I've tried many, many places and nothing even comes close to it.  I think what makes it stand out is in addition to the sausage they use some sort of bacon in it.  So with this recipe I added 1 strip of bacon to the sausage.  That's the only thing I changed, and I'm sure it would be perfect even without the bacon.  I air fried some frozen Grands biscuits to complete the dish.  So good!

This is our family favorite breakfast.  I made the Sausage and Gravy in our Instant Pot and it turned out fantastic.

Prepare biscuits according to directions.

Turn the Instant Pot to the saute setting,  add the sausage.  Break up the sausage as it browns.   Do not drain the grease.

Cover the Instant Pot and secure with the lid.  Have the valve set on "sealed".  Set the manual button to 5 minutes.  Then quick release.   Open the lid, stir in flour (we use gluten free all-purpose flour).  When paste, add in milk, salt, pepper and stir well.   Turn the Instant Pot on saute, stir until the gravy is bubbly and thick.   Fantastic.     

I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.   They make great leftovers.

The ratios are perfect! This is such an easy and basic recipe just ripe for additions and little tweaks, if you feel like being adventurous. I spiced it up with some chipotle chili powder and used andouille sausage, bacon, and ham to make a triple threat gravy. I will always go back to this recipe as a base for more breakfast gravy ideas.

I learned to make this in college ; I still make it for my family.  I only use 1/2  roll of the Jimmy Dean sausage.  (Jimmy Dean is my favorite too) It's plenty for my family of 4 (I have two tiny teenage girls).  If you have boys then you probably should make more.  I never measure anything.  I add a couple of large spoonfuls of flour after I cook my ground sausage.  This is a recipe that I always make in my iron skillet.  Brown the sausage - I don't drain the sausage because there really isn't ever any grease to drain.  Add the flour  and stir. Cook the flour coated sausage for another minute or two to get rid of the raw flour taste.   Then add the milk until it's the consistency that you would like it to be.   The gravy will get thicker as it cools too.   Add salt /pepper and a few dashes for Louisiana hot sauce.

This was extremely easy to make. I wanted a little bit more depth of flavor so added a little bit of paprika, red pepper flakes, cayenne, sage, rosemary, onion and garlic powder to the recipe. There were no leftovers :) I also let it simmer on low for longer than the recipe called for (and added are milk if I felt it was getting too thick).

Perfect easy sausage gravy recipe. I grew up eating this and since there were so many of us, with not a whole lot if money, we would add some water to make it more plentiful, it tasted just fine. So if your low on milk you can add a little water without ruining the flavor.

Follow the recipe!  I made the mistake of not using enough milk to make a thicker gravy.  Didn't have enough gravy =(    I also prefer the hot JD sausage roll, but the regular crumbles are good too.

Love this very easy recipe. It always turns out great. I would have given it 5 stars, but I never give anything 5 stars. Do try it. Quick, easy and delicious.

I have made this gravy for many years and everyone loves it. However, I add to a double recipe 2 T. of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, a dash of garlic powder, a sprinkling of either rosemary or Italian Seasoning, and a few crushed red pepper flakes in addition to seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper! I also use the Grands biscuits.

This is exactly how my mom makes biscuits and gravy. I’ve been doing it this way for over 15 years. Try using sage seasoned pork for a nice flavor. Make sure u break up the pork into tiny crumbles in the frying pan as it’s cooking, before you add the flour and milk.

I used half a roll of sausage instead. When your cooking it, it looks like you won't need all the milk (if you're a thicker gravy fan, like myself), but you certainly need it all. Tastes great!

Great easy gravy recipe.  I make my biscuits from scratch though, so I don’t need the info about how to make canned ones.   Overall, good info and easy to follow.

OMG, this is SO GOOD!!   I followed suggestions to set aside the sausage after cooking and melt butter and make a roux, then adding back the sausage and the milk. It came out fabulous!  Also, I didn't have the Jimmy Dean "crumbles", so I used a half package of Jimmy Dean sausage and broke it up in the pan while frying.  That comes out to 8 ounces of sausage instead of the 9.6 the recipe calls for.  Came out perfect!  This is going to be a favorite until the day I die!

BOOM! I haven't made sausage gravy and biscuits in probably 20 yrs. Yesterday at our new elite grocery store I saw "BUTTERMILK PORK BREAKFAST SAUSAGE". What?  Gotta have me some. So, I found this recipe and as usual altered it a little.  
After I browned the sausage, it was dry so I added 2T butter. While it melted, I added the flour, and stirred until the flour cooked. Taste it, if it tastes like flour cook more. Then slowly add milk. Next time I will increase milk to 2 3/4 cup.  WONDERFUL!!!!  Worth the calories.

I loved this recipe and so did my family!  Doubled the recipe since I had a pound of sausage, and ate it over biscuits with a sunny side up egg on each side, open faced.  I'm amazed that so few ingredients can produce such a tasty result!  Will add this recipe to my menu rotation.  Thanks for sharing it!

One suggestion for the gravy. I always use Jimmy Dean SAGE sausage it gives the gravy just that little extra taste that makes it so good.

I love this recipe, I make it quite often. You could totally make homemade biscuits and what not but sometimes you just want to whip up something quick and get on with your life. This is that recipe and it's really good! I make it with a roll of jimmy dean country sausage instead of the crumbles but other than that I make as is every time.

I used whole milk and store processed pork sausage. It's a family hit! I also made biscuits from scratch~they're super easy and taste so much better!

Just made this. Very good. Throughout I had to make 2 small tweaks. 1. I used 1/3 cup of flour. And 2. I used 2  1/4 cup of milk. This calls for a slightly more thick gravy as it was a little to thin at first. Overall a fast great meal.

I made this in my cast iron skillet using THRIVE sausage crumbles.  2 cups of milk was plenty, any more and it would've been too thin. This tasted good and I would make it again.

Delicious and very easy. I didn't even have to add the milk gradually, just tossed in the flour stirred a little and then added all the milk. The gravy was really runny at first but once it started to boil it thickened up nicely. I replaced the jimmy Dean sausage with Alpine Ranch sausage.

DH and I enjoyed this as a lazy Saturday breakfast. Added red pepper flakes to the turkey sausage as it browned. I used whole milk and as a preference I will probably add more milk very slowly to get a little more liquid consistency. Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was an excellent base for me to learn from. I made a few changes, though.

The only difference I make is I use bacon for 1/3 of that 9.6 oz of meat so 6.4 oz of sausage and 3.2 oz of bacon. If you're going to make it semi-regularly, what I do is take 2 lbs of sausage and 1 lb of cut up bacon (be sure none of it has been frozen before) and split it up into five 1 quart freezer bags with 6.4 oz of sausage and 3.2 oz of bacon, press it flat, and freeze it. Then it's ready anytime you want it.

The other change I made was adding about 1 tablespoon of butter. Oh, and if you're using bacon, cook the bacon about 3/4 of the way before you add the sausage. Otherwise you'll get undercooked bacon and overcooked sausage.

Last thing, it's really best to use freezer biscuits over refrigerator biscuits. I think they taste way better, almost as good as fresh if you get Grands freezer biscuits. I brush a little vegetable oil on the top and bottom of the biscuit before I bake them. It gives them a slightly crisp edge.

We love this recipe. No matter what sausage I use, it doesn't produce sufficient fat for the roux. So, I always add butter to the drippings from the sausage (for this amount of milk, you'll need 3T of fat). 

I'm trying to be more health conscious, so I substituted a lean turkey sausage, 1% milk, and reduced fat cheese (I add cheese to the gravy before serving), and it was still great.

I don't eat biscuits and gravy, but my husband loves it.  I made it once and he complained there wasn't enough gravy, so the next time I made it, I doubled the recipe of gravy. The second time, even with a double batch, he complained there wasn't enough gravy. I ended up making four batches of gravy, using 4 pounds of sausage. Asked him why he doesn't just ask for a bowl of gravy. 

Personally, I'm never make this again.

I made this for breakfast this morning before leaving for work. The recipe is very quick and easy to throw together, which is a plus when we're trying to get 3 kids up and ready, along with ourselves! The most time consuming part of the recipe is cooking the biscuits themselves. The gravy was very simple to make. My only compliant with this recipe is it was very plain. I'm hoping if I make this again, I can add in some more flavor to the gravy!

Tasted great and easy to make.  I found a not so lean sausage, like Farmer John's, produced more fat, and made a tastier gravy.

Used to take me an hour with the gravy in one pot and sausage in the other, and the gravy was never the right consistency. 15 minutes following this recipe and it was THE BEST BATCH I've ever made!!!

This is an easy and tasty recipe. I made my biscuits from scratch,  using the basic biscuit recipe on this site. The only changes I made to the gravy recipe was that I melted some butter in the pan before I put the sausage in. Plus, I added garlic powder to the seasoning. Then topped it off with a couple of fried eggs to serve.

This was the first time I have ever made biscuits and gravy (believe it or not). I really liked the simplicity of the recipe and my family loved the finished dish!! I kept the sausage grease in the pan and also added some butter when I made the roux. All in all it turned out great!

my husband loves a good biscuit and gravy.. my in-laws are from the south.. my mother n law taught me how to make biscuit and gravy. hers is good but so time consuming! so I thought there has to be an easier faster way... I found this recipe and everyone loved it, the first time was a little thick and I made again and"perfect". my in-laws even loved it!! I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe!! so good and comforting!

Followed the recipe, except only had skim milk so shot some whipped cream from the can into milk and beat  it in. Seemed to work okay. 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I though the 1/4 cup of flour was way too little and added about 1/8 of a cup more; 1/4 cup would have been  fine. Delicious, comforting and totally in disagreement with everything my cardiologist is telling me to do.

Excellent! So much better than the stuff in a can or at many restaurants. Very easy too, although it takes a good 30 minutes not 15. Cook the flour down for 3 minutes to avoid the floury taste. And to the reviewer who said "too much sausage"- no way, it was perfect. But you could definitely add another cup or 2 of milk to thin it out

I've made this twice now. I brown the sausage and add chopped onion and garlic. Then I throw in some red pepper flakes, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. The sausage I use doesn't give off much fat so I add about 2 tbsp butter and sprinkle flour over the entire mess. Cook and stir for a bit to ensure the flour is cooked through and add milk. Taste and add S&P to taste. Fast, easy, and delicious :)

I have used this recipe  more times than I can count. Seriously easy to put together. I know traditionally it takes longer and the flavors will be richer, but when you gotta get your day going but want some of this classic breakfast to kick start your day, you just can't beat simple and easy. Like I said I've used it before and I'll keep on using it. Some purists might not like it but... deal! *drops mic*

Delicious!!!  My 15 year old made it for a brunch we hosted and everyone loved it!!  To help flavor up the gravy, buy the coarse ground black pepper - it makes a big difference.  And add lots of it!!!

I have been looking for a good recipe for Biscuits and Gravy like my grandpa used to make.  This recipe had really good flavor, though I did add a lot of pepper. It was super easy to make, and I will make it again. 

That being said, I will absolutely switch it up.  I thought the ratio of the sausage to gravy was really off.  I plan on using half the sausage next time.  I hope that won't make it taste too bland, but it was just way too much sausage for me.

This is a good start to my recipe.  Probably lower in fat as well.  Once in a while treat on holidays or other special occasions.  

I started off with melting butter in my pan,  so the two (2) the sausage wouldn't stick.  I used Country Pride or whatever is on sale.  (Jimmy Deans sausage is too spicy for some who have ARD.)  I heated half and half in the microwave and stirred in the flour with a whisk.  To the milk  and flour mixture I added a couple squirts of Sriracha hot sauce.  This allows for even distribution and avoidance of flour clumping.  In addition,  I added sage and onion powder along with two shakes of salt.   In the past I used two(2) mild and on hot sausage and didn't add hot sause.  I fell in love with the taste of Sriracha.  If it's too spicy I add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to tone it down a bit.

This is a pretty decent recipe, especially when you need something that is pretty easy and simple. I didn't follow the recipe exactly and cook more by "feel" to get the kind of gravy consistency that I am looking for but still a great place to start. Just beware of what type of sausage you use. I accidentally ended up using a sweeter sausage and while it wasn't bad, it added a sweetness to the gravy that was unexpected.

Yum! I follow this recipe exactly and love it. I was never a fan of biscuits and gravy but this recipe has completely changed my mind. My fiancé and I enjoy eating it for breakfast on the weekends. Sometimes I make this with Bisquick biscuits instead of the premade ones. Either way, so so good.

Excellent recipe.  I like I can use heavy whipping cream, half & half, or milk, and it turns out great no matter what.  If you use Tennessee Pride original sausage, you don't even need to add salt & pepper.  Great recipe!

I made the recipe as presented and love it.  It's a classic southern comfort-food.  I use the "Regular" version of the Jimmy Dean sausage, but you can use any of them.  Just don't make the mistake of draining off the small amount of fat from cooking the sausage.  It's needed for the flour to make a roux, and as every good cook already knows, Fat = Flavor!

Wonderful and easy basic recipe. I made a double batch (you'll want to!), added diced red pepper and onion to the sausage while it browned, and added butter to the mix right before adding flour (gives you a better gravy). I make this at least once a week. It's delish!

This is one of my family's absolute favorites. I use maple flavored sausage and "butter tastin" Grands flaky layers. As said before, DO NOT DRAIN THE GREASE.

I mean, this is basic gravy and some cheating biscuits.   -1 star for the cheating biscuits.   -1 star for making the gravy sound easy to make.

I have made B&G for years and the gravy is definitely the hard part.   Remember, you can always make it thinner....not the other way around.  

I should give it another -1 for saying that a serving is 1/3 of a cup.....shoot, this whole batch is my serving.   :)

This was exactly what I was looking for! My late grandma used to make B's & G's this way & it tasted great every time. You also have most ingredients on hand & it's easy. I used Jimmy Dean hot roll sausage. Yumm! This will probably feed 4 adults. If you're out of biscuits, try toast. This is great too!! Will be using this recipe often. Thanks for sharing, Jimmy.

Nothing wrong with this simple gravy. 
Home made bisquits are even better. I've done both. 
I've done this many times.

These are the easiest and best no changes needed. Even my other half likes them and he is a fussy eater when i first made them he asked if there was any more?

Fantastic!!!!  

I added a TBS of cornstarch, and a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash seasoning, and it made thick, luscious tasty gravy !  My husband (who is the one who usually makes this) was very impressed and said I outdid his recipe!  I used homemade biscuits--he made those!

I made this gravy to put over JP Big Daddy's biscuits.  Maybe because I'm at high altitude, it thickened in about 2 minutes and I had to add more milk, but the taste and texture were absolutely perfect, and super-easy to make.  This one's a keeper!

This is my most Favorite!!!
The first time my husband complained because he really don,t like sausage & he said something about using dinner biscuits??...  But when he sat down to eat it,  he was done before the others and was up and got seconds. 
    : )         I've made this a few times with no changes..
My sister n her husband are coming up for a visit this weekend and I'm going to make it again but a double batch. Hope it comes out great && I really hope they like it....

Easy and delicious.  Used 1% milk and cooked the sausage in a little olive oil.

YUMMERS!  Sausage/gravy and biscuits are a rare treat in this household, so when we decide to splurge, we want it to be worth it. Of the 3 sausage gravy recipes I've tried, this one is the winner....I'm not even going to keep looking for a better recipe. Sadly, the kids devoured their helping, so there were no leftovers. Will consider doubling the recipe next time!

Finally, I learned how to make a decent sausage gravy!! I used Tennesee Pride sausage that comes in the rolls ( half a tube of mild and 1/2 of a hot)  which is about double what the recipe calls for, but we like our gravy not so runny so we did not double anything else.  The comment to make sure I stir in the flour for a few minutes before adding the flour was SO helpful! For the first time ever it did not turn out tasting like flour. Sooo yummy. Both my son and I like it a bit spicy and this was perfect. I have never liked it in restaurants since having homemade years ago and now I can finally make my own! Thanks SO much for the recipe!!

My husband doesn't like the spiciness of packaged or jar gravy you can buy at the store, so I searched for a recipe I could make from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly (except used a regular roll of sausage), and it was fantastic!  It was easy to make, even for a beginner like me, plus it's cheaper than buy it from the store.  Best of all, hubby and the kids loved it!  I've made this several times now, each time using regular sausage.  Don't drain the fat if you do it this way.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I've tried this one & enjoyed it. Have also used this gravy on Country Fried Steak & it was rather tasty. Definitely will keep making this one.

Thank you for adding it to this site. :)

I just made the biscuits and sausage and gravy. I altered the recipe almighty. I used whole wheat flour and spicy chicken sausage from Trader Joes and I must say the changes I made were awesome- especially with the sausage. Definitely recommend this recipe.

I have now made this several times. The only thing I have done different is I use home raised and home made sausage. 
This recipe turns out great every time. 
Thank you for this!!

Basic but good, I will make it again vs. buying a pre-made can gravy. I think I will add extra seasonings,  maybe some finely chopped onions and fresh garlic.
