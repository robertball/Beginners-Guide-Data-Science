I doubled this recipe. I used Turkey Hill Vanilla Bean ice cream, I cut back on the milk by half (for a thicker shake) and added a touch more mint flavoring. The kids and I drank every bit of this.

This was great! I didn't measure the milk, just kept adding until it was the consistancy that I wanted.  Great flavor and very pretty to look at. The girls loved this for a treat today after lunch. I will be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this twice this weekend!  Some recipes say not to use peppermint extract, but that was all I had on hand and it worked just fine.  As others stated, I added less milk...probably 1 cup of milk per 2 cups of ice cream.  I will never again buy a Shamrock shake from McDonald's!   Last year when I got one, it tasted a bit odd and I think it was the dye they used.  And...for about $6 I was able to make about 10 shakes for my family.

Wow! I loved this recipe! I didn't have any mint extract so I put in a bunch of after eight chocolates and blended them along with it and it gave it a nice minty taste. I also added a bit more ice cream to make it thicker. Thanks so much for the recipe! I will definitely make it again!!

THANK YOU! Our local fast-food chain's shake machine was "down", and I really needed my annual Shamrock Shake fix, FAST! This reminded me that, yes, I am capable of making my own shakes, and I can also control what goes into them, too! I didn't measure anything, but I used approximately equal amounts of milk and ice cream, a splash of mint extract, a couple drops of green food coloring, and it came out perfectly! I will be making this every St. Patrick's Day, and any other time the mood strikes me!

These are so good! I used less milk, start with 1 cup and add more as needed. But I like these thick. Who needs to go to McDonald's now?

I just made a ton of this stuff. Everyone loved it. I would use less milk though. Maybe start off with one cup (which was perfect for us), and add more if you need to.

Definitely use less milk. I used only 1 cup and it was still too much. Very watery shake. And don't doubt the mint for peppermint. It tasted very good.

I made this with these two exceptions: 1/2 teaspoon of mint flavoring, and heavy cream instead of milk. So much thicker and creamier. Yum!

Made this before, but without the chocolate. This sounds great, going to try this on St. Patricks Day. I think Joe BDA used creme de menthe and had a few of these shakes before adding his review.

As many other reviewers posted, this recipe called for too much milk. I tried this recipe as written, but next time I will try less milk and maybe double the mint extract. Otherwise, it was very good and it has the potential to be great with a few tweaks.

SO good! We used 1/2tsp of peppermint, which would be the minimum for our tastes. This recipe made 2 glasses full, but they were a bit much for my teens.  Next time I'll break into 4 servings.

I like it with more mint flavoring so instead of only using 1/4 tsp I put in 1/2 tsp instead which made it more of a "shamrock shake" for me. I also added 2 tbsp of sweetened condensed milk which made it more creamy and added just the right amount of sweetness for the kiddos :)

Made these last night for our annual St. Patrick's day party and everyone loved them. The recipe says mint but I would suggest using peppermint extract I made a different recipe with the mint extract and it ruined it it was like eating a toothepaste flavored dessert.

This is perfect with my homemade ice cream and I intend on making it for many upcoming events. I found that if I use my homemade mint ice cream, it was one of the most delicious deserts I've ever consumed.  I highly suggest making this (not everyday) because it's way better then what you will or will ever get somewhere else.
