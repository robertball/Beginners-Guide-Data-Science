We are popcorn lovers in our family, so I liked this popcorn.  It is similar to a popcorn ball and it was eaten up in minutes.  I was expecting a toffee taste, but I think brown sugar would need to be added.  My grandson loved the popcorn because he didn't have to bite into a big popcorn ball.  I added the syrup to a large bowl to mix the syrup and quickly mixed the popcorn. Then,  I poured the popcorn  on a parchment lined baking pan and broke apart into chunks.  I think next time, I would add some peanuts  and maybe some food coloring to make the popcorn more festive.

I love this recipe! Great job! I added a little red food coloring to make it Pink for Valentine's Day and the texture of the butter toffee popcorn was just right... in fact I couldn't stop 'tasting' it :-). Nice and crispy. Thanks for a great recipe!
