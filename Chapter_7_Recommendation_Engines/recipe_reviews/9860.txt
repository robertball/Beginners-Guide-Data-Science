This recipe is super!  I have been making this one for years.  When you press the cereal mixture into pan, use a flat metal lasagna spatula sprayed lightly with cooking spray and press mixture down firmly.  Another good tip is to spray cooking spray into measuring cup for adding corn syrup!  It slides right out!  Also, line measuring cup for peanut butter with plastic wrap and there is no mess!

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is extremely sweet!  I only gave it 4 stars because my recipe differs just a bit.  I use 1-1/2 cups peanut butter which makes it far less hard.  For the topping, 2 cups chocolate chips and 2 cups butterscotch chips (doubling this recipe).  Makes a nice thick topping!  Make sure you use a double boiler for melting as the butterscotch chips just don't melt very well in the microwave.  Very good but try my version!

Exactly what I was looking for!!  Be careful not to cook the syrup & sugar any longer than just reaching a rollign boil though -- they get HARD if yo ulet it boil too long.  I had walked away to answer the phone and the first batch I made were like ROCKS!!

I use 1 1/2 c of peanut butter, add 2 tsp of vanilla as I stir in the peanut butter, and use 10 c of Special K. On a tip from my grandma, I used 12 oz of chocolate chips and 12 oz of butterscotch chips. With those changes these are my favorite bars ever!

Delicious!  I was paranoid about letting the corn syrup mixture boil too long, so I didn't even let it reach a rolling boil.  As soon as it started to boil, I removed it from the stove and added the peanut butter.  It's perfect.  Not too chewy and definitely not too hard.  I'm having a hard time saving some for my kids to eat!

These are an old family favorite and super easy but DO NOT let the corn syrup come to a bubbling all-over boil. That's what makes them hard! Just let the sugar melt with tiny bubbles around the edge of the pan then remove from heat & stir in peanut butter. I always use super crunchy peanut butter and 2 C. semisweet chips and whole bag of butterscotch chips for the topping. Don't pack it too hard in the pan either or they will be a challenge to cut. Thanks for posting this "oldie and goodie" recipe.

This is a decent start for this dessert but I think the following changes make the bars gooey-er (softer and chewier) and the "frosting" to bar ratio more proportionate:
For the Bar:
~Use 2 c. of peanut butter
~Add additional corn syrup as needed because the extra peanut butter can dry out the bar

For the "Frosting":
~Use 2 c. of chocolate chips
~Use 2 c. of butterscotch chips
~Use 1 c. of peanut butter (this will improve the peanut butter taste even more and help make microwave melting easier)

These bars are spectacular.  The first time I made them, I pressed them in the pan too hard and it was torture to cut them!  Make sure to lightly press so that they're easier to cut.  Great recipe!

I've been making these from my own recipe (which is pretty much identical) for over 20 years.  A few of my own tips: add the peanut butter with the syrup and sugar BEFORE you turn on the heat and then just barely bring to a boil (this ensures you don't make rock candy), use pam for baking to grease the dish, use waxed paper to press the mixture into the pan, and, lastly, use a double boiler to melt the chocolate.  These all guarantee a perfect result every time.

This is my favorite desert bar recipe!  I found that melting the chips in a double boiler results in a smoother topping than melting them in the microwave.

These were so good, so quick and so easy.  I love no bakes!  I used all rice krispie cereal. Instead of using all corn syrup, I did about 50/50 with honey. Also used about 50/50 Splenda with the white sugar. Then when I was stirring in the peanut butter I also stirred in about 2 Tbsp. of cocoa powder.  I had only one bag of chocolate chips, they were actually the chocolate/caramel swirl type.  I microwaved them and drizzled it back and forth on top of the bars. This recipe is not too different than the No-bake granola bars I make all the time, the only difference being there's no quick cook oatmeal in them.  Definitely Yum Yum Yummy!

Fantastic recipe! My only suggestion would be to let the butterscotch melt a little before mixing in the chocolate chips, as the butterscotch seems to have a slightly higher melting point.

I love this recipe! Have made several times. I have made changes based on my lazy cooking ethics: I melt the chips & added the syrup & sugar (all in one pan). I wait for this to boil, then add the peanut butter, take off the heat & add the cereal. I also added pecans this time around (1 cup of sugar coated pecan pieces, recipe from this site), and used only 5 cups of cereal. Reduced sugar to 1/2 a cup also. Love, love, love this recipe! Thanks so much for the post! PS Made this time around for a teacher luncheon. Really well-received & easy to transport!

I love this recipe!  I've been making this for more that 40 yrs.  The only differences in my recipe is mine calls for 3/4 c white corn syrup and 2T butter and 1c sugar.  1 1/2 c peanut butter 6 c Special K.  One package chocolate chips( 2 cups) and 1 c butterscotch chips.  Directions are the same.  These are always a huge hit!

These have been my favorite dessert since I was young.

To avoid the problem of overheating, I never let the corn syrup/sugar mixture get to a boil.  Once it reaches the simmer stage, the concoction is warm enough.

These were awesome! I actually combined two other reviews. I put the sugar and syrup in together, stirred, then turned the stove on. While it was heating up, I added the peanut butter. Once I saw it boil, I immediately took it off the heat and added the rice crispies. I then doubled the chocolate/butterscotch mixture. These were soft even after I took them out of the fridge! Excellent way to wow your guests or your fiance, as I did!

Finally! I found this recipe! I used to make these a LONG time ago and they sounded good recently, so I'm so glad you posted it. I ate these growing up and used to make them around Christmas time. I always used the entire bag of both chips. More frosting = more yummier! LOL Thank you for posting! :)

These were delicious. I got this recipe from the dessert department of a fancy steakhouse!  I used only 3/4 cup white sugar the first time around and they tasted great. This 2nd time around I used only 2/3 cups sugar and 2/3 cup corn syrup and they still taste great! Everyone LOVES these.  Clean up tip: I line my pan with foil and then after I put in the mix, I put plastic wrap on top and press on it with my hands to pack it in. No clean up on the pan needed and you can remove the whole thing to cut it more easilyl too.

This is the same recipe I always use, and it is the best!  I get the same comments every time I make it, "I don't know what you do, but your scotcheroos are the best".  The ingredients are perfect as they are.  I think the key is take the sugar/corn syrup mixture off the heat as soon as it comes to a boil.  If you let it boil too long, your bars will be a little hard.  I also don't press the rice krispie mixture real hard into the pan; just even them out and press them a lightly.  This is a family favorite!!

quick simple and always a favorite... the trick here is to remove from heat as soon as the corn syrup starts to boil... otherwise they will end up hard.. good recipe... as recommended by a friend who owns a catering company I will try using brown sugar instead of white sugar for better flavor!!

I have been making scotcheroos for years, and this recipe is by far a simple best!! At the suggestion of other reviewers, I increased the Peanut Butter and removed the corn syrup mixture from the heat when I first saw bubbles around the edges of the pot. I also doubled the choc and butterscotch chips for the topping (2 cups of each). I thought 1.5 cups for each would be sufficient next time, However, everyone that enjoyed one thought the top was nice and thick. These were soft, chewy and gone quickly!! Great recipe!!

This is a recipe that my family has been making for at least 15 years. We love it and so does everyone else. If you really like peanut butter you can add a little more. I usually use Kelloggs Rice Krispies, I find it tastes better as well as Nestle chips. I make them in the microwave, 3 min for the sugar and corn syrup, stirring 1/2 way through and then 2 minutes for the chips, also stirring 1/2 way through. They are a great hit for any gathering and very easy to make.

My family has used this recipe forever!  Yes, definitely don't boil the sugar and syrup, they will end up too hard, just enough heating so the mixture is clear and warm, you can do this in the microwave too, just heat it 1 minute at a time till it's clear.  Tip to save on the pots and pans cleaning--I sprinkle the chips on the top of the rice krispie mixture and put in a warm oven-300 degrees or so and watch until the chips all get that shiny look-then they are easy to spread around and you get every last bit of the topping too.

I couldn't believe how fast these are.  Boiled in no time flat.  I used up the odds and ends leftover cereals in the pantry and finished the measure with cheerios.  I sandwiched chocolate chips between two layers of the warm cereal candy and they melted themselves.  Next time I'll try it when I have butterscotch chips on hand.

These tasted good but were hard as rocks. I followed the directions and don't know what went wrong. Next time I will try a different recipe.

The secret to not having hard as rock scotcheroos is to not boil the syrup and sugar too long just to a good boil then REMOVE from the heat and stir in peanut butter. They do have to be refrigerated to harden then you can take them out of the fridge for awhile before serving so they soften again. I use all kinds of leftover cereal, corn flakes, chex, rice krispies, or Special K whatever you have such as these is good and several of the same types mixed together work well too.

Excellent recipe. Been making these for years and the kids just gobble them up! Word of caution - don't neglect the pot when cooking the sugar/corn syrup combo. If you cook this mixture too long, you will get very tasty paperweights. Been there!

I have been making these for years, but never thought to put butterscotch chips with the chocolate. So tasty!!! Stay away from reduced fat peanut butter for this recipe - bad consistency.

I doubled the topping for mine (a bag each of chocolate chips and butterscotch chips). It turned out great...just the recipe I was searching for.

4 stars only because I felt it wasn't enough chocolate topping--I had to make another batch of it to sufficiently cover the pan.  Other than that, excellent!

This is a favorite recipe from childhood.  It's easy to make and almost everyone loves it.  The only difference from my childhood recipe is to subsitute  peanut butter for the butterscotch chips in the frosting.

These are so heavenly - the butterscotch and chocolate chips melted on top are SO good.  They turn out better for me if I melt in a double boiler or in a big heat-safe bowl over top a pot of boiling water on the stove.  It heats more evenly and is really easy to spread.  I would suggest letting this cool for at least an hour or two to let the topping set. Never met a person who didn't LOVE this - kids and adults alike!

My mom has been making this recipe (sort of) for years, but cuts down on the sugar, PB, and choc topping to decrease calories.  When I make it, I follow this recipe to a tee (and say forget the calories!), because it is so yummy sweet and delicious.  I don't know anyone that doesn't love these!

Wow! these are great and so easy to make!! Would be perfect for a potluck so you dont eat them all yourself ;) I used about half a cup to a cup less of cereal to make them a bit gooey. I also only put them in the fridge long enough to cool a bit (15 min) cut them,  then left them on the counter covered with plastic wrap so they dont get too hard.

Yummy!!! These are essentially candy bars. My family's been making them since before I was born, and they only rarely last until the morning after they're made. We used to fight over who ate more than his/her share. (Did I say "used to"? Who am I kidding? We still do.) 

Be careful with the sugar/corn syrup though: as soon as the mixture is boiling, remove it from the heat. Otherwise, as it cools, it becomes too solid and makes cutting difficult and chewing even more so.

Very sweet and tasty.  Probably my favorite use for butterscotch chips.  I use a piece of buttered waxed paper to press the cereal mixture into the pan and a pizza cutter to cut the bars when the chocolate/butterscotch mixture has cooled, if everyone can wait that long.  I have also used 1/4 or 1/2 cup peanutbutter with great results.

Wonderful bars!  I didn't change the ingredients; however, I did not bring the sugar/syrup to a boil.  Bars had a great consistency; they were not hard at all.  Thanks for sharing!

These are really good! I have made it as written and have also used it as a "crust" for an ice cream cake. I sprayed a spring form pan with pam, spread a thin layer of the chocolate schotcheroo on the bottom, spread a layer of soft ice cream on top, placed the spring form pan in the frezzer for about 15 minutes until the layer set. I then sprinkled another layer of the chocolate schotcharoos over the ice cream and spread a second layer of a different ice cream on top. I used the remaining chocolate schotcheroo to decorate the top of the cake, placed it in the freezer for 24 hours. the cake was amazing and the chocolate schotcheroos were delicious and added a really nice crunch to the ice cream cake! yumm!!!

Okay, I wasn't sure whether to rate this a 4 or 5, but since everyone loves them, I'll go with 5 stars.  I'll admit, I didn't think I'd like them, let alone anyone else, when I tasted the bits left over from making them (you know you do it too--licking the bowl!) I thought they'd be too rich.  Then, I was distracted by my kids while melting the topping, so instead of one cup each, I use a WHOLE BAG of each, chocolate and butterscotch chips!  After sitting in the fridge to firm up a bit, DH tried them first.  Let's just say, they're a hit!  I cut them into 1 inch squares (since they are rich), but the kids and I each had two, and DH, who cut his own first, had the equivalent of 6!  The next time I try them, I might try just chocolate on top, or corn flakes instead of rice krispies.  Oh, and the extra topping--worth it!!

Excellent!  I made these for a bake sale which was a huge disappointment to my husband, because I had to keep smacking his hand so he would stay out of them!

Whatever you do DO NOT over boil!!! I went to cut them after they cooled and couldn't even get a knife through them! I finally pried 1 out and microwaved it and the flavor was awesome but they're not eatable when they're concrete. Great recipe as long as you don't over boil.

I got rave reviews from everyone who tried these.  They were also very quick to make.  One way to make it easier is to microwave the sugar/corn syrup (but be sure not to let it boil too much).  After pouring it into the pan, melt the chocolate/butterscotch in the same microwave-safe bowl.

EXACTLY the recipe I was looking for.  I have had these bars at potlucks and other functions before, but could never find the recipe.  It is unbelievably easy and quick to make, and is so sweet and delicious.  My husband could barely wait for them to cool!

Very addicting and super sweet treat.  Best eaten the same day they are made, but that hasn't usually been a problem for us.  I have made these successfully  with less peanutbutter - 1/4 to 1/3 cup.

OMG!!!!!!!!! Soooooo good! I made a double batch and put in a jelly roll pan. Only had 1 bag choc. chips and 1/2 bag choc./peanut butter swirl chips. So could have used some more topping on a double batch, but still great. Can't wait to mke these with the butterscotch!

Very yummy, sweet bar. I found it kind of hard to chew, though, so I just added more peanut butter and less corn syrup and that seemed to do the trick. Definitely a fun, delicious concoction!

Awesome!! If you like Rice Kripy treats, these are far BETTER! Once you try these you'll be hooked. I would definately use rice cereal, though I haven't tried Special K. YUMMY!!! An absolute keeper.

Excellent easy recipe. Didn’t change anything ingredient wise. I don’t bring the sugar and corn syrup mix to a boil but cook u til it’s no longer grainy. I then add a dollop of peanut butter to the butterscotch and chocolate chip topping. I find it blends better. My husband loves these! I’m sure half the pan will be gone by tomorrow!

My mom made these all the time when I was growing up - she still does and now I do too!  This is the exact recipe I use... the ingredient ratios are perfection, please don't mess with it!  The only thing I've changed now that I make them myself is to substitute milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chocolate chips - personal family preference.  My daughter even requested these instead of a birthday cake last year.

This was just what I was looking for!  Delicious, even tho I had to sub some honey for the syrup, as I was low.  I lined my pan with foil and then lifted the hardened candy onto my cutting board, which made the cutting job much easier.   Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, simple and fast. Made with 1.5 c PB in bars, used 1/2 rice krispies and 1/2 special K. Good texture. Doubled ingredients for the topping (1 bag of each) and added vanilla and 1/2 c PB to the topping. Also have made with reeces pieces in the bar-amazing!

Always a family favorite! My mom (over 90 yo) has made this for as long as I can remember (I'm almost 60 yo). We always merely melted the base ingredients, topped the warm bars with chocolate bars, let them get soft from the heat of the cookie base and then spread the chocolate over the bars. Warm, gooey, and delicious!

This is a great basic recipe. However, for me it is much too sweet. I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup, added 2 tbsp of butter and a dash of salt. In my opinion, the salt really adds to a better flavor. To further make it less sweet, next time I will make the majority of the topping semi-sweet chocolate chips, and add in lesser amounts of milk chocolate and butterscotch chips.

Everyone loves these bars. My 93 year old mother has been making these since the 1950s. I made them for the first time in many years and I won't wait that long again. Highly recommend these.

This is a "go-to" winner!   I made some of these at Christmas, to give out to my favorite neighbors.  My kids were jealous!  Between the neighbors and kids, I had to make several batches because of their popularity.  I always add about one extra cup of rice krispies.
Make sure you check for peanut allergies!

This recipe has been around since the early 1960's. My mother made them every single year when we were growing up,  it is part of our Christmas tradition.  I have been making them for 26 years.  My 18 year old son has to have them.   We love them! I also double the topping recipe ??   Delish!!    Merry Christmas everybody  ??

Made these for a friend from the MidWest for a taste of home...delicious! I only had peanut butter without sugar/salt added and I think it was as sweet as I could handle! Recipe also reduces well so you don't end up over-eating and forgetting to bring them to the pot luck :) I do wish I could find a substitute for the corn syrup as I try to stay away from it as much as I can...

Simple, chewy, and tasty.  I recommend doubling the chocolate and butterscotch topping however.  And best to eat when at room temperature.

This recipe is so simple and so good!  I used peanut butter chips since I was out of butterscotch chips but both are great.

This is the same recipe that my mom has used for years. They came out great, but I do like to use a whole 12 oz bag of both the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. I scoop the rice krispie mixture into the pan with a wooden spoon and then use the flat side to beat it flat and even. Gets out your frustration too :)

These scotcheroos are fabulous. I made a couple of small changes to amounts: 8 cups of rice crispies cereal instead of 6, 3/4 cup butterscotch chips instead of 1/2, and 3/4 cup MILK chocolate chips instead of 1/2 cup semisweet.

These were good and I used all butterscotch chips for the top.  My chips did not melt very well, so I added some Crisco to make it more spreadable.

I give the recipe 4 stars.  While I personally can't stand the things (I don't like butterscotch AT ALL & don't like PB flavoured sweets), I do often make them to take to gatherings and they're a hit with most everyone else... never any left, even when I make a double batch!

Great bars !  I added a little more peanut butter because we just like peanut butter. I had issues with the chips melting in the micro though they just got hard and wouldn't melt so I had to add a little milk. I've never had that happen before, it was weird.

be very careful that you dont pack these down into the pan very much or else they will be like rocks.  good taste, esp. if someone else makes them for you and you dont know every unhealthy ingredient in it :)       thanks for the recipe.

"Very sweet" was an understatement in describing this.  It was way too sweet for my taste, and way too firm of a texture.  I was expecting Rice krispie treats that tasted butterscotchy.  Instead of a light treat I came out with a pan of rock hard sugar bombs.  I guess they would have been ok served as a candy, not a real dessert, but that's just me.  I took about three bites and didnt eat the rest.  I'll stick to the normal rice krispie treats with chocolate drizzled on them.  These just aren't what I expected at all.

These are a family favorite! No on in my family actually needs to look at a recipe for these, but I wanted to tell everyone else how wonderful they are. You can actually do everything in the microwave. Just microwave sugar and corn syrup together until it just starts to boil (if you boil for too long the bars will be hard), remove from microwave and stir in peanut butter. Add rice crispies, then simply press into a pan with your hands, they won't get messy, really. The melt chips in the microwave. 
We make these for everything. They are so simple and delicious. And if you run out of rice crispies you can you corn flakes, or we even used cherrios once (not recommended, but it worked!)

I used Special K cereal with the chocolate bits. I've been making variations of this since learning how to make it in Summer Bible School. My oldest son and I made this together today and had a blast. Not something I'd make everyday, as it pretty much puts you into a diabetic coma but everyone seemed to like them.

I have been making this recipe for 30 years.  My friends call it my "special bars".  My son even requested these for his graduation party.  We had 14 pans of them.  I usually use an  11 x 13 pan and use a 12 oz box of Special K and 1 1/2 cups of each sugar, peanut butter and Karo syrup.  I also double the choc chips.  It is the best!

My great grandmother used to make these and no one can beat hers!  These are a good second place though.  Next time I will use a little less peanut butter and just use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch.

Scotcheroos are one of my family's "must haves" of the holidays.  They are sooooo good! As someone else said, I always double the amount of chocolate and butterscotch chips to a bag of each (or 2 cups each).  Also, if you melt about 1/2 a rectangle of paraffin wax in the double boiler before you add the chocolate and butterscotch, the topping will be smoother and shinier.  Yum!

These bars were rock hard when I was through with them.  I read some of the other reviews and will try again using some of their suggestions.  These were tastey, just tough to bite/chew.

A couple of things: after the scotcheroos have been in the refrigerator for about 50 minutes to an hour, I take the pan out and cut them into squares while they are still soft.  Then I place it back in the refrigerator to finish hardening.  For those people that don't like to eat the scotcheroos when they are hard as a rock, I take mine out and let them soften at room temp before eating them.  I also use an entire package (12oz) of both the butterscotch and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Someone I know uses more chocolate than butterscotch.  So, about one package of chocolate chips and 1/2 package of the butterscotch, but I really love the butterscotch flavor in these!  Yummy!

I was a little dissappointed.  They were VERY hard to cut so leave extra time for that.  They weren't as crewy as I expected, but still good.

Outstanding taste...I should have tried making the recipe as it stated rather than trying the "easy" route of doing it in the microwave...not so easy! Next time I'll do the stovetop way, making sure I use a very large pot (6 c. of cereal is a lot to stir in!)My chips turned almost hard/powdery in the microwave (probably b/c I had already cooked the first part in the same pyrex bowl in the microwave)so stirring them over a med-low heat on the stove worked to smoothen it out. Crazy addictive and surely easy if you do it right (hindsight...!)

Just like Grandma's.  My kids love them so much that Great Grandma makes them  whenever we visit.  She is now known to my kids as Grandma Cookie.  I was so happy to find this recipe, so we can have them, even when we are not at Grandmas!!  Thanks!!  Oh and I did double the recipe for the frosting, but I think that it would have probably been just fine to do it as written.  If doubling the frosting it makes it about 1/2" thick.  Really yummy!!

I've been making this for years too (found this when making sure there weren't duplicates of my recipe), but I call them Kris Kringles. My whole family raves abt them. I usually end up making 3 or more pans of them at Christmas, and am told I have to have them w/ me on Christmas Day in order to get through the door, lol.

Yum!  I love the texture of these in comparison to regular Rice Krispie treats.  I usually double it for a nice, thick bar but I don't think that you need to double the chocolate topping.

We had these all the time back in college.  They were the most popular thing served by the dining service!  Don't bother measuring the cereal, just pour in enough to leave the bars gooey!  These work well when you need a sugar/chocolate fix.

I've been making a version of these for a while. I just use the sugar, butter, corn syrup, peanut butter and corn flakes. 
They're called Pick Me Ups and they're dropped by the TBSP full.
I sometimes use rice cereal but corn flakes are better. 
I can just sprinkle the chips over the warm treat.
But, this version is great, too.
I love the marriage of peanut butter and chocolate.
But, with either treat, a little bit goes a LONG way. And, both can 'pick you up' from the sugar and protein from the peanut butter.
I'm going to try different nut butters for some variety and see how they turn out.

This has been a favourite since kindergarten, so for 44 years.  Mum made it for me to take to share on birthdays first year of school and continued to send it in care packages when I left for college.  Super easy and super popular at work.  
If you like it stiffer, boil the sugar syrup a minute or two longer---makes it great to shape into logs to drizzle w/caramel, roll in nuts (or pretzels!) then dip in chocolate.  Best homemade candybar ever :)   Also good with dark corn syrup & brown sugar!

This is a go to recipe for me! So simple and makes such a delicious dessert. For a gooier, less crunchy version, add extra peanut butter! I usually put in 1.5-2 cups peanut butter so the rice crispies are better coated and softer. Plus the extra peanut butter flavor is never a bad thing in my books!

I make this all the time, however I put it in a 9 x 9 pan. There’s hardly enough topping if you spread it across a 9 x 13 pan. So at least this way, I get a thicker layer of the chocolate butterscotch topping. Also, I’m not shy with the peanut butter! I add a heaping Cup of peanut butter to the recipe.

These are so good. I could have eaten the entire pan. Dangerous. 

We did make one change and used SpecialK cereal. We crushed the SpecialK first. I prefer the recipe with Rice Krispies.

One other change was that we sprinkled the chocolate and butterscotch chips on top of the warm bars, covered with foil, and then spread them around in 10 minutes or so after they had melted.  So much easier this way.

I've made these bars more times than I can count and in my opinion, the sugar is totally unnecessary.   Between the corn syrup, the peanut butter and the chocolate and butterscotch, these are totally sweet enough.   The only problem with these is how totally addicting they are.

A great recipe but don't boil the corn syrup and sugar,  that is what makes the bars hard, if you want a soft gooey bar only heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves, remove from the heat before it boils then stir in the peanut butter.

I brought the sugar and corn syrup just barely to a boil before adding 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 10 cups Rice Krispies, and full packages of chocolate and butterscotch chips. The bars came out much thicker than I would have liked.  Next time, I will stick with the original recipe for a thinner bar.  Either way, the taste is fantastic.

Love these! So easy and people go crazy for them. I use the entire bag of chocolate and butterscotch chips for a thicker layer of chocolatey goodness.

Really really good - Only reason missing one star is there really ought to be a good THREE cups of chips for topping - Two just doesn't spread far enough unless only using a very very thin layer

Classic recipe.  Don't boil the corn syrup mixture too much or it can cause the bars to be hard.  I also decrease the cereal to 5 1/2 cups so they are not so dry.

These are straight out of my childhood, but we called them "Special K bars." The recipe basics are spot on but the proportions give you an extremely sweet bar. I used the recommendation to reduce the sugar and corn syrup to 2/3 cup each, and increased the cereal to 7 cups. I did use 1.5 cups of semisweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and felt that there wouldn't have been enough topping without the extra chips. 

Still, next time I would use 8 cups of cereal rather than 7 or reduce the sugar/corn syrup mixture further. 4 stars since it still needs some tweaking.

NomNom!  I should have read others' comments first so I would know how to make them easy to cut.  But my biggest problem was that the chocolate chips melted easily in the microwave and the butterscotch chips did not, and I ended up with a burnt batch.  So when I redid it, I used a double boiler on the stovetop.  The butterscotch chips still took a lot of mashing to blend them well with the chocolate.

An old favorite, although I had lost my recipe so I followed the one here.  My only quibble: melt the entire bag of chips--the butterscotch and chocolate--instead of just one cup each.  We melted the amount stated in the recipe, and it wouldn't cover the entire pan--we ended up melting the rest of the bag(s) and then there was enough.  Next time I might even up the peanut butter by a half cup or so.  Otherwise, delicious, and EASY--my son, who is hopeless in the kitchen, made these for a class party and they turned out perfect.

Loved these; only thing is, when I pulled the recipe up on my phone, it was different.  It had 1 1/2 c of peanut butter, which was ok, but only 1/2 cup each of the chips (butterscotch and chocolate).  It also had instructions to put the peanut butter in with the syrup and suger all at once, in the begining.  Lastly, it had instructions to melt the chips in a saucepan; I always think its easier to melt chips in the microwave.    So 5 stars for the recipe I pulled up on my laptop, 3 stars for the one I got on my phone....both allrecipe Scotcharoos.

I made these for a bake sell, and people kept buying more and ranting and raving about them. I did what one reviewer suggested and used 1 1/2 c. of peanut butter, and doubled the chocolate, so a full bag of semi sweet and a full bag of butterscotch chips. Only thing is if your a new cook like me, I had no idea chocolate burns in the microwave, i stuck it in the first time for 5 minutes it wasn't melted put another 5 min on it and it burned, i'd do 5 min, then check it every minute, or just use a sauce pan. Also something I may try with this later on is instead of butterscotch chips, get a bag of andes mint pieces u can find in the baking section, and add a bag of those with the semi sweet choc chips, for a mint chocolate peanut butter treat!

My mother used to make these when I was growing up and I had forgotten about them until this recipe popped up one day.  I made them for company and they were gone in no time.  My mother's used to turn into bricks as they sat, but mine didn't do that.  Maybe it's because they didn't last long enough to harden too much, but I thought this recipe was perfect.

Very good. I made them with Special K (personal preference). A little to sweet and a little too much butterscotch for my taste. But still good.

I've been loving these things at potlucks for years and never new what was in them and that they were so easy to make.  I make one change, though.  I really, really have a sweet tooth, but I've found that if you cut out a lot of the sugar (I quartered it this time), you can't taste the difference at all.  Between the corn syrup and the chocolate on top they were still plenty sweet and perfect.

This was a "very sweet" treat, but I really liked it. My 3 year old daughter loved it even more! The only thing I altered was I used 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and 1 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips b/c I am not just a huge fan of butterscotch. This gave it just enough butterscotch flavor, but not too overpowering. The extra chocolate kick was great! I used rice krispie cereal. May try Special K next time. I also used extra crunchy PB. I'll use this simple recipe again for church functions.

used 1.5 c peanutbutter, brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup and a bag of semi-sweet and a bag of butterscotch chips. Yummy!

This is one of my favorite treats!  My grandmother used to make these and passed the recipe down.  They are also good without the chocolate on them, if you're not big on chocolate.

This sugar-bomb is the exact recipe my family has been using for years and years.  My grandmother used to make them for us, and now I make them for my children. Everyone who has ever tried them, raves about them. They are awfully sugary, but hey, it's not about healthy; it's about summer and picnics and yummy chocolate-butterscotchy goodness. :-)  Oh, and I think super chunky peanut butter adds a nice texture.

I bring to a boil for 1 minute.  When you put the chocolate chips/butterscotch on you can just pour over warmed mixture and they melt and you can spread from there.  My daughter can't have chocolate, these are great without the frosting too

I messed up and let the corn syrup boil to long and they were hard! But overall, an easy recipe that I will try again.

We love this recipe. I only use chocolate chips in the topping (with 1 T. of oil to help with the melting) and it's great. Make sure to cut the bars while they are warm since they get hard to cut once they set.

Mmmm, these are so good they are BAD, (can't stop eating them)!  I have found in the past an equal mix of butterscotch and semi-sweet chips to be too sweet, so I used 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet, 1 cup butterscotch chips.  Unfortunately, I am sure I will want to make these again!

these are great. turned out a bit hard, but were worth the effort - the taste was great. I think next time I'll follow other users' suggestions of taking the mix off the heat getting it situated right away. hard or not, the taste was great! easy too.

I did something wrong the and topping was a little weird but definitely double the amount of chocolate chips you use for the topping.  Mine didn't stretch all the way across the top.

These had a great flavor but turned out really hard- like chip your teeth hard.  Would definately make again with a few modifications, I would probably use a traditional "puffed rice treat" recipe and top with chocolate rather than using the cornsyrup & sugar version.  Once you get past the very hard texture, the taste was great.

Very good!  Topping is thin as made, but definitely SWEET enough!  If you'd like a thicker coating, double the topping.

Very easy to make and they dissapeared very quickly at a pot-luck that I recently attended. In fact, my family never did get to taste them so I had to make some for them. I will be using this recipe again and again.

This recipe tied for first place at my office's dessert bake-off!  We raised $177 for our local food bank!  The only thing I changed (thanks to my husband's suggestion) was I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the peanut butter/sugar/krispy rice section.  To my surprise - this was a huge hit!

These were good.  I used Cheerios (needed to use them up) instead of rice cereal.  My guys realy like these.  I added a bit of vanilla to the mix and some half and half to the topping to help with the spreading.  Worked out great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

My husband loved these when I made them for our anniverssary.  They are really sweet though!  I also added more of the semi-sweet chocolate chips because the original 2 C amount did not cover the top of the bars completely.

This was good and an easy recipe to make. It made a lot however, I think I may cut the ingredients in half next time. 

I think next time I make it, I will try adding some marshmallows.

These things are amazing! I ruined my diet because of them :) I originally made them for my little sister and ended up having more of them myself than anyone else.

I replace the syrup with honey because I'd rather avoid corn syrup entirely. Also, I used a touch less sugar. I used puffed rice cereal as well.

These are always a hit at family parties, potlucks, etc.  I also add a cup of dry roasted peanuts for added texture and flavor.  Great recipe!

I've made chocolate scotcheroos twice in the last 2 weeks.  The first time my topping was dry, but the second time I added half and half...and it turned out yummy.  Easiest no-bak recipe I've ever made.  Simple, fast and good!!!

These were really tasty, but I apparently boiled the corn syrup too long, which is why they were pretty tough to cut and chew, according to the other reviews.  I guess I should have read more reviews before making these. :)  I think I might add a little extra peanut butter next time, too.

excellent! i added 1/2 cup more crispie rice as suggested and they weren't soggy at all. i didn't have wax paper but a wet spoon worked perfect to press it down. thx for the recipe ( i couldn't find it on the box either!)

I love this recipe, a twist on rice krispie bars, but WAY better.  I always make a double batch and just use a large cookie sheet - you don't need to double the topping unless you want to, I make 1 1/2 times the topping.  I also think it's easier than measuring peanut butter, one small jar of peanut butter is two cups, just use the whole thing!  Yummy

These are wonderful! Not healthy at all, but really good for an occasional sweet. They are better when they have been out on the counter for a while; that makes them soft and chewy. My sons sold these in a bake sale and sold out before the day was over!

These are great. I have made them without the butterscotch chips, and still are really good. I have also made it without the chocolate and they are rally good. I add an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter.

These are very good, however, I used 1-1/2 cups of organic peanut butter and 1/2 cup each of butterscotch and chocolate chips, as previously suggested.  Tasty!  :)

Awesome! So very tasty, it completely eclipses any regular rice crispie treat. I had a LOT of topping and made a nice thick layer. Next time I might consider halving the chocolate/butterscotch chips and drizzling over top. But, there's definitely a "next time."

This was an okay recipe. It is very very sweet, and the butterscotch flavor doesnt blend well with the chocolate, at least for my families taste. Also, don't chill this for too long because it will become extremely hard and difficult to cut unless you thaw it for awhile.

I just had to make these.  These are not your ordinary rice krispie treat - DELICIOUS.  I remember my friend bringing them to girl scouts and I lost the recipe that she'd given me.  I remember them being a bit gooier, but all in all these dissappeared in a flash.  I plan on cutting them into teddy bear shapes for my daughter's "Teddy Bear Picnic" birthday party.  The kids will devour them!
