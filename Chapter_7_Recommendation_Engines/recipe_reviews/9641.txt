Did I do this right?  It's tasty but it seems a little flat to be called 'bars'; and I even put it in a smaller pan than the recipe called for.  I'd double the recipe if I was going to make this again.

I made this recipe because we had the ingredients on hand and because I love chocolate! This recipe was even a little much for me. Perhaps incorporating condensed milk would make it more moist. I would also suggest using half a cup of chocolate chips instead of a full cup.

this recipe mentions two size of baking pans which has me in confusion. I don't know if I should use a 9" or a jelly roll pan??

Fantastic. Very chunky. We used almonds as we're allergic to peanuts, & added white choc chips. Can't wait to make it again!

Thought they sounded good, but was disappointed in the final product.  Looked awful, tasted okay. Won't make them again :(

So much chocolate. Next time I would double or even triple the recipe, but not for the chocolate chips or marshmallows. We cannot cut these into bars. We just tried it between graham crackers. Yummy!

Not enough ingredients to make a single batch, even if you make a double batch.  Should have more information.

I don't know what I did wrong! The bars were bland except for the extreme sweetness of marshmallows and chocolate on top. Will need to try out another RR bar recipe, haven't given up yet!

The topping was great but the crust was not so good.I tripled the crust recipe like other reviewers had said to do but still I may try something different.
