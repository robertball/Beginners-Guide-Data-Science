What an easy recipe! I used whole boneless chicken breasts, and covered the casserole dish with foil for the first 40 minutes of baking time. I also topped the chicken with olive oil for more moistness. I served the chicken with garlic dill potatoes.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Deeeelish!  The curry powder makes this dish special.  The whole house smelled great.

This was EXCELLENT!  Such a quick and easy recipe! The chicken smelled great while cooking....drove us crazy having to wait :) Followed recipe as written, only I used boneless chicken breasts, (frozen)& added 1 TBS honey per breast, covered and baked @ 375 for 50 minutes uncovered 10.  I thickened the juices w/ cornstarch and poured the sauce over the chicken.....YUMMY!! Very moist and perfectly seasoned.  Definately will make again and again!  Thanks for the recipe :)

WOW! This chicken was wonderful! Very easy to make, and a definite crowd-pleaser! I used some of the previous reviews to tweak it slightly: I used boneless/skinless breasts (6), and I added 6 TBSP corn syrup to make it a little sweeter, as the lemon is very tart. I cooked it for about 35 minutes covered, and uncovered for 10. When the chicken was cooked, I transferred the juices to a saucepan, and thickened it over med/high heat with some cornstarch. I served it with a simple California salad and rolls to sop up the extra sauce. Absolutely wonderful, this is on my weekly menu for sure!

This was okay--you gotta make sure to get it before it dries out--I think I'll cover it next time until the last few minutes for browning.

This preparation of this recipe was so simple that I we were all surprised at how wonderful it tasted. (I used chicken thighs and baked them in an oven bag)  My husband works for a chicken company so we eat chicken all the time, but this recipe really stands out from the rest.  It's now become a family favourite!

This was a very simple recipe, but had a TON of flavor!  My family all liked it, even two teenagers :)  I did brush on some olive oil after adding all ingredients, as someone else suggested.  Also, I covered it with foil until the last ten minutes.  It came out very juicy doing it this way.  I will surely make this one again.  Perfect for busy weeknights! Yum

With all the lemon and garlic, it tasted similar to fish.  A good side with pesto pasta.

This recipe was delicious and very, very easy.  I did cut back on the lemons a bit and used 3 lemons for 9 boneless chicken thighs.  Cooked covered for 50 minutes, off for 10 then broiled just to brown.  Definitely will make this again!

Loved it! Was really moist, however I varied the recipe a bit. Added a little olive oil and white wine. Only used 2 lemons but found that it was still very flavorful and the curry was just enough!

This is a fantastic and easy recipe. The flavors are subtle and a little amount of curry goes a long way.  I also added a bit of grated ginger as well to add a different flavor.  You can also make this with chicken breasts, or thighs and legs to reduce prep time in cutting up the chicken.  Any way you make it, excellent!

I followed the recipe, but added a little olive oil over the chicken before baking as one of the reviewers suggested.  The chicken still needed a little something. I sprinkled a little soy sauce on it to give more flavor.  Next time I'm going to do that before baking it.  Will make it again with the tweeks.

Moist and flavorful. I used about 2 T. of lemon juice which was a tad too much - next time I'd use 4 tsp. I covered the chicken for the first hour and then uncovered for another 20 minutes.

i was excited about this recipe after reading all the reviews, but my experience was not as positive.  we thought the dish was just okay.  the chicken was moist (i did cover it for a while)but other than that, it was pretty unremarkable.  also, my curry powder was sort of in clumps on top of the breasts.  we were very disappointed and i probably won't make this again.

We did not care for this chicken. I gave it three stars because it was easy, the chicken came out tender and juicy, but the flavor was not to our taste. It may just be personal preference. It seemed lacking in something, but I can't think of what. I did discover that I like curry though. I will not make again.

Maybe I didn't use the correct amount of spices, but to me, the curry & garlic canceled out the lemon and the chicken tasted just like chicken. I still give it four stars for the easy preparation of the recipe. I cooked it covered for 40 mins and uncovered for 10 and the chicken was still juicy

I'm giving this 2 stars for tenderness but the flavor was nothing worth making this again. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and covered for 45 min. (they were partially frozen) then uncovered for about 10 min. They sliced wonderfully. Maybe if I'd thickened the juices to make a sauce it would have been better.

I thought this was really good. The lemon is a bit overpowering, but I love that. My husband, on the other hand, didn't like the strong lemon flavor. (He's very picky.)

I did a much smaller version of this recipe since I was the only one eating it and I had a chicken breast I didn't know what to do with.  This turned out very well!  I think I must have not used enough lemon juice because it was more like a hint of lemon in the chicken rather than LEMON chicken but I still thought it was great!

I used chicken legs and garlic powder. This was fabulous for a easy weekday meal. I ate it with fried plantains and honeydew melon. Would go good with a rice side dish too.

3 lemons halved is plenty. could use peppers for a little bite, which is the reason for 4 stars.

Easy, straightforward. Lemons happen to be cheap here just now, so's chicken. A fine recipe and is easy to prepare (unless the chicken has dripped down into your vegetable bins - yuchh).

I was so excited over the simplicity of this recipe. Boy, was I disappointed!  Maybe it was just our taste buds, but the overwhelming sourness of this recipe was too much. I used large 1-pound breasts and only baked for 30 minutes. They came out perfect. But I had to fix everyone a ramekin of honey to combat the tartness of the lemons. I thought I might be able to tinker with this another time and it be successful, but my family said not to bother.

This was simple but very tasty. The only change I made was to substitute ready made chicken spice for curry powder. The lemon flavour really came through wonderfully.

I agree that this was pretty dry as posted.  Some of the other suggestions of covering or adding some liquid are a good idea.  The addition of curry to the more traditional lemon chicken was great.

I didn't like this recipe very much, the chicken came out very dry and the flavor was just too bland.

I used less curry powder, it was easy and it was satisfyingly lemony!

We put added just a little bit of olive oil to the bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts we used and it was great.  A simple, easy meal that smells and tastes wonderful.

Sorry but I added olive oil and a little soy sauce to tops of chicken pieces, still was pretty bland and not visually appealing.

This was good, but not spectacular.  I used drumsticks and garlic powder.

Maybe I did something wrong with this one...I did 6 boneless/skinless chicken breasts as another review suggested and baked for 45 minutes covered (at 350) and 15 minutes uncovered, also as suggested by a review. The lemon was pungent and overwhelming and the chicken tasted and looked really yellow and strange. I ate a piece because I hate to waste food, but it was not good and my husband and two kids didn't like it. Sorry--won't be making this again.

I did not taste any lemon. Instead, the curry overtook this recipe and my entire family (of 10) thought this was disgusting (unless you have a love for curry). I gave it 2 stars because it was slightly better as leftovers, but it is more a curry chicken dish than a lemon chicken dish.
