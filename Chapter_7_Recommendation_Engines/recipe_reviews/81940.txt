These were a huge hit! I'm too lazy to stack everything up, so I just mixed all of the ingredients together (except the bread), using diced corned beef and shredded cheese. Then I dropped a tablespoon or so on each slice of bread and broiled. Easy and delicious! They also tasted good at room temperature, so you can make them ahead if you want.

We thougt these were pretty good. Next time I will toast the mini rye bread first as it was a little soggy.  With that in mind we will make these again

I love the classic Reuben sandwich, but these appetizers are even better!  Since they have less bread, you can taste the other flavors better, and they are healthier since they are broiled rather than grilled with lots of butter. You can serve them anywhere from a Super Bowl party to a shower (although I would recommend eating with utensils at the latter since the sandwiches can get messy).

I have been making these for years, and usually I by the cheap corned beef (Budding brand) and use siccors to 'shred'. the beef. I also use some shredded swiss cheese. I mix the beef, cheese and kraut together - adding enough dressing to make it creamy. Then I scoop a tablespoon full onto the mini rye slices and top with a small square fo swiss cheese... and bake! SOOOO GOOD!

I make these, but not open faced. I use a small amount of yellow mustard in place of the Thousand Island,serving the Thousand Island on the side. I lightly butter the top and bottom of the rye bread and place butter side down on a cookie sheet, cover with foil and heat in a 350Â° oven until heated through. They turn out like grilled reuben sandwiches

We have made these several times and they are ALWAYS a huge hit.  Tips: Toast the bread a bit first or they can get soggy. Also, I think using thinly shaved corned beef makes them easier to assemble. If the meat is too think it doesn't want to stay folded. (I guess you could just cut it into little pieces and stack them up but then that adds another prep step.) The biggest problem with them is if you make a ton of them you need a really LARGE tray for transporting them. They don't do well stacked on top of each other.

I loved these. The only thing is, I use my favorite reuben dressing, which is 1/2 thousand island and 1/2 russian dressing. Tangy and zippy. It's perfect!

The bread needs to be lightly buttered and put in the broiler for a minute before assembly.  Then assemble on the non butter side. That is all this is missing from the real thing.

Love These Little Sandwiches! Made them for some friends for a big football game viewing party. Everyone of them, and I made a bunch, were gone! Even the ones who didn't like Reubens had to try them cause they looked so good. Easy to make and look like something gourmet. Only drawback, they are much better right out of the oven. After they sit a while, definitely reheat a bit.

Didn't want to mix all the ingredients together like other reviews suggest.  Just stack the sliced meat and cut into squares that fit.  I used 3 layers of meat.  Also made with turkey - use mustard rather than dressing.  Took to a neighborhood block party with tons of great food but these were the 1st gone (I made 2 loaves!).  Easy to handle and mingle at the same time.  What a great idea!

These are a wonderful appetizer, I've been making them for years and everyone loves them. I don't measure any ingredients, just squeeze 1000 Island on from the bottle and then pile the rest of the ingredients on till it looks right. Try it, you'll love them.

I thought these were very salty, and would not make them again. I am not a big fan of Ruebens, so I gave it an extra star to be fair.

We love these. Instead of using sauerkraut, you can use one slice of dill pickle. Easier to assemble and tastes great!

I brought these to a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved them! I broiled them at home then just warmed them up at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes once we got to the party.

I love this quick and easy appy!  I make some with turkey, too.  I also add some mini open faced ham and cheddar cheese sammys, spread the bread with honey mustard, and cheese and tomato for the vegetarians for a nice mixed platter.

This was the best!  My store said it wasn't getting the cocktail rye bread for another few weeks. So I bought a dark rye bread loaf - lightly toasted and then cut into 4 pieces - then followed the recipe exactly.  AWESOME!

These are delicious!  Of course, they taste exactly like the full size sandwich; the only disappointment was that you really need a fork and possibly knife to eat them - I was hoping they could be "finger food" but they get a bit messy when trying to eat with the hands.

Fantastic idea, thanks MRSCANUCK! I used marble rye, toasted it, cut in half instead of the cocktail rye. Was a great tasting addition to my appetizer Christmas Eve, they went over really well.

I got this recipe from my sister some time ago and have made it at least 3 times.  Everyone seems to love it.  You can also vary it by using deli turkey and provolone on pumpernickle, or roasted chicken pieces with meunster.   Use your imagination.  These are just small versions of regular sized sandwiches, so go for it.

These were a hit at my parents 60th Anniversary party. It was held at the assisted living facility where they live. I mixed everything together the day before, then assembled and cooked them in their apartment, and ran them down to the community room where the party was. Worked out well.

These were pretty good, though I used low fat thousand island and low fat Swiss cheese. I think I'd use the full fat varieties if I make it again though. Why scrimp when making something like this?

I threw these together in no time and they were very tasty!  Great if you need something quick and easy, although I had to make a few w/o the sauerkraut because not a lot of people like it.

These were a huge, huge hit!  Everyone loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I didn't measure the Thousand Island dressing--I just spooned some on each one.  Really good!

Yum! So simple and quick to stick in the oven before guests arrive! I love them using shredded cheese, half swiss and half provolone.

These were a huge hit at our Superbowl party!  I couldn't make them fast enough!  They were fun to make, too.  My brother and a friend (ages 19 & 25) helped make them and they had so much fun! (They'd kill me if they knew I told anyone they were COOKING!) The only thing I did differently to make things easier for me was I cut the corned beef into squares to fit the bread instead of folding it.  Great recipe!  Thank you!!!

These were really good, everyone liked them a lot, they came together so super fast also. They seemed to be a little too soft for me but some people said they liked them soft. I ran out of corned beef and they weren't even all that bad without it. I'm planning on making these again for a baby shower, the dad's name is Rueben :)  it will be so cute. Thanks for the recipe :)

I use a recipe that is very similar to this, but with a few changes. Instead of deli corned beef, my recipe calls for left-over cooked corned beef brisket and instead of thousand island dressing, I use mustard.  (I know, I know, a traditional reuben uses thousand island, but I like mustard) And, instead of broiling to melt the cheese, I microwave it for 1 minute. (I also top it off with another slice of cocktail bread, which turns it into a mini-slider.) I love my version and have never tried broiling it, but I think I will.

awesome appetizer.  I used sliced corned beef from the braised corned beef brisket by mauigirl, and regular rye bread, since I could not find the cocktail rye.

Use really good swiss.  It got a little firm on top, not very cheesy.  Otherwise, the flavor was great!  Ended up making full sandwiches the next day with the left over ingredients.

These were good, but with a little tweaking, they can be great. Next time I will toast the bread a litle first, so they don't get soggy. I won't rinse the sauerkraut either. afer rinsing it was missing the sour bite that we like so much. And I will probably cut the meat into strips to make it easier to eat. It was still the first dish gone at the party!! Will definitely make again though.

This was a huge party hit! I substituted pastrami for the corned beef and also toasted the cocktail rye before putting the ingredients on and then broiled. This made it a little firmer.

These were definitely fast and easy.  I thought they were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  The three stars are for the recipe as-is.  I like the taste and texture of reubens that have been pan fried so the bread has a nice buttery and toasted taste to it.  I do plan to make these again, only I will lightly butter the bread first and place just the bread under the broiler to let it toast slightly.  After it is toasted, I would then follow the rest of the recipe as-is, with the exception of possibly adding another slice of bread to the top and toasting again.  The second slice of bread would be for no other reason than to make them easier to bite into without everything sliding off.  (This is coming from a mom of four young children, so you may not find this last step necessary.)  ;)

I made this recipe to use up some cocktail rye bread we had on hand.  The best thing about these was that you don't butter the bread like you would on a regular reuben.  But, I would rather make regular reubens unless it was for an appetizer because these seem to  make a bigger mess.

These were just wonderful.  An oldie but a good one.  I did broil each side of bread first so I could prepare these in advance.  I did not a lot of dressing on the bread.  They were just enjoyed by all.  Thank you for sharing.  Nana

I'm trying to find some good & easy appetizers for the upcoming holidays, and this recipe fills the bill. I had some pastrami, so I used that and provolone cheese, and a good sourdough bread instead of the rye, and it was an excellent appetizer! My husband loved it. It will definitely go in my recipe box and I will make again!

They were a huge hit. I did change a couple things. I used miniature Jewish rye instead of pumpernickel which I grilled  first to prevent soggy bread. also, instead of putting the thousand island on the bread I drizzled it on the top after broiling.  YUMMY!!!

Delicious. Rather than an open faced sandwich I made a "closed" sandwich spreading the cocktail bread with Russian dressing, then corn beef, cheese, sauerkraut, cheese then another slice of bread with the dressing. I brushed the top of bread with melted butter then used a griddle to cook. I put parchment paper over the sandwiches on the grill then placed a cookie sheet on top weighted with 2 full tea kettles to compress sandwiches while cooking and flipped to cook other side while weighted down. I chilled in freezer for 30 minutes then cut each into fourths making bite-size appetizers. you can freeze after cooking and reheat in the oven then serve. Great do-ahead appetizer.

Lightly toasting the bread in the oven first then putting the ingredients and broiling gave a better texture to the bread.  Too soggy otherwise.

This was outstanding.  I did follow some of the other readers suggestions.  I could not find party rye so used marble rye, cut it into quarters, sprayed with pam and broiled for just a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also used regular corned beef instead of deli corned beef.  Everyone raved about it.  So easy to make and such a great addition to the appetizer table

Made several times, always a hit.

But the ingredient quantities on the recipe are way off.

 I only needed 
1 1/2 pounds of Corned Beef...10 slices will do. Like wise,  I only needed 6 slices of Swiss  Cheese...

These were good. For some reason just not great. I would make again though. Always need something different for a occasion and this could be it.

Made these for a party and they were a HUGE hit. I did toast the bread which did keep them from being soggy. I also used less dressing.

Took this to Thanksgiving Day as another appetizer but when I got there the broiler was taken and no toaster oven so I mixed all the ingredients together, put in microwave till cheese melted and put on the rye, it didn't look as nice as when done in broiler with cheese melted on top but it was a HUGE hit. Will be making these again real soon.

We served these at a party and they were a hit, even amongst people (like me) who don't normally like reubens. Instead of using deli corned beef though, we put a corned beef in the crock pot all day. We used the Stout Slow Cooker Corned Beef and Veggies recipe from AllRecipes (minus the veggies), and pulled chunks from that for the mini reubens. It was amazing!

I wasn't sure how these would go over at a St. Patrick's Day party, but they were a huge hit with people of all ages!  I didn't change a thing- they were great.

I made these for a family get-together and they were a big hit. Delicious! I couldn't find cocktail rye bread, so I used a loaf of rye and cut each slice into 2 or 3 pieces. It also makes a great easy supper served with chicken noodle soup.

I made these last night for the boyfriend and I for St. Patrick's Day and they were perfect!  I cooked corned beef beforehand and used that as I could not find sliced deli meat corned beef, and it worked just as well.  I tried a recipe for a Reuben casserole that I believe I found on this site recently; although that was pretty good, these were much, much better.  Thanks!

I made these for a Christmas "finger food" party and they were a big hit.  I used turkey pastrami in place of the corned beef and everyone loved them.  Not much left on that tray.

These are amazing! If you like the flavor of a regular reuben sandwich, you will LOVE these. They are the perfect appetizer size, and are easy to prepare and assemble. I'm making these again next weekend for my cousin's baby shower. I could eat the whole platter!! Thanks for sharing a wonderful, easy, impressive appetizer!

What's not to love about these delicious little reubens?! I just made these and forgot that I should have broiled the bread a bit on both sides first, but will remember to do that next time. Perfect little party appetizers!

Wow, great appetizer.  I made them for a cook-out and they were gone in no time.  A little messy though so if you're going to pass them around, be sure to bring napkins :)
