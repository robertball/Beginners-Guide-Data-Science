The meat turned out very dry for being in broth and the peas turned out very mushy even though I followed the recipe exactly. Ok for a one timer but wouldn't fix again.

I think this recipe has potential. I cut it in half and used three leg quarters rather than a whole chicken because that's what I had. To the broth I added 1 celery stick cut into big chunks so I could remove it easily salt 2 crushed cloves garlic 10 peppercorns a bay leaf some dried thyme and the juice of one lemon. I omitted the peas and onions because I had none. At the end of cooking I strained the broth and thickened it to use as gravy. As is I have to give it four stars because it needed a little something extra but with the added ingredients it's a 5. Many thanks to Cindy to providing this recipe!

This a delicious basic recipe. My family does not care for peas so I added green beans. In this economy recipes like this go far.
