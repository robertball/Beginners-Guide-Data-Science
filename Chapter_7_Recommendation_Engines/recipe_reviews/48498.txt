My entire family is Italian (the older generation native to Italy) and I have never heard of these stuffed olives.  Thought I'd try them anyway - too much labor for not a lot of taste.

My father is from the region where these "olive ascolane" or "olive all' ascolana" originate from. I usually love them (believe me, they're delicious), but I think you're using way too much tomato (it's usually just one or two table spoons) and the vegetables are not part of the stuffing once they got fried with the meat. They're just there to give the meat a bit more taste. I've never heard of a version with chicken breast either. The olives must be watered for a few hours before you start cooking.

This is the absolute reason my family loves Christmas dinner!! Our variation, which has been passed down to me from my Mother, from her Mother, from her Mother, etc., we have a grinder that we use to grind the meat after its cooked, when grinding the meat, we add the lemon zest then and when all through, its that point we start stuffing and the rest of the recipe is exactly the same.....Bellisimo!!! A staple among italian holiday dinners!!

My Nona passed away with her recipes in her head, I was the first child born in the US and regret not knowing her recipes. I have been looking for a recipe for stuffed olives for years! This was great, I loved it, almost exact!I read some of the other reviews, to my knowledge soaking the olives was also what she did, I made them by hand(A LOT OF WORK)and wish I had a grinder but overall I LOVE them, and they were WONDERFUL, my family loved them, they weren't like nona's exactly but definitly came in second place!!!!

I just finished making these for family who hadn't had them in a long time and they were great.  Instead of mincing meat, run the meat through a grinder.  The review who mentioned that she never heard of them must understand that this is a micro-regional dish from Ascoli Picena.  It is a lot of work, but for special occasions worth it.
