I used these last night to make Snowman cookies.  They were absolutely delicious.  I'm a very impatient baker and I never can wait for dough to harden in the fridge, so I cut them out immediately by rolling the dough between two sheets of wax paper and then dipping the cutter into sugar before cutting.  It worked very easily.  Definitely a recipe I will use often.  Oh, and by the way, make sure to space the cookies far enough apart.  These babies really puff up--but keep their shape beautifully.

These are delicious!!  I rolled mine thicker than 1/4 inch & baked them for 6 & 1/2 minutes so they would be nice and soft; they were still soft days after I baked them.  I am giving them 4 stars because you have to work with care if you want to use cookie cutters (roll between wax paper for easy transfering).  Place them on a cookie sheet & refridgerate or freeze for a few minutes; they will bake better if cold.

I have been searching and SEARCHING for the perfect soft sugar cookie recipe and I think this is it!  The key is them still being soft the next day.  I rolled them fairly thick and was careful not to overbake them, and I think that helped.  I also substituted grated orange rind for nutmeg because I'm generally not a huge nutmeg fan.  I iced them with cream cheese icing and they were a huge hit!  Thanks, Eileen.

P.S.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine becaue I was out of butter and I think that may have helped them hold their shape.  Just a thought.

I've been on the hunt for a great sugar cookie recipe for years. Even my grandmother's fell short. Either the cookies baked hard and flat, or too crumbly/grainy in texture, and all of them were totally flavorless - like cardboard.

This recipe has flavor, the texture is perfect, and it really puffs up when you bake it. I took everyone's advice and decreased the nutmeg to about 1/8 of a teaspoon, plus a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I paired it with the Sugar Cookie Icing by Janice Brubaker, and it was a smash hit. 10 out of 10. I've found my sugar cookie recipe for life!

Very good sugar cookies. I added 1 1/2 t. cream of tartar, as it sets sugar cookies apart. The sour cream made this cookie extra special.

This is an excellent sugar cookie recipe that I have been using over a year.  I figured it was time to write my own review after reading some of the recent surprising negative reviews.  My kids always request this cookie for their holiday party snacks at school.  There is definitely not too much flour in this recipe.  If you were to use any less you would be left with a gooey mess that wouldn't be able to be rolled out.  I have made this recipe so many times and never once did I have a batch where the dough turned out crumbly.  The directions say to use softened butter and I place the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds to basically have it melted before starting on the recipe (maybe others don't have their butter softened enough to begin with).  Next, I add all the ingredients but the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and nutmeg and cream them.  Then I add half the flour (2 cups) and mix again.  After that is well blended I add the remaining 2 cups of flour with the other dry ingredients and mix.  Personally, I like the nutmeg in these cookies and don't find it to be too much at all and find it hardly noticeable.  Also, I saw someone mention these don't brown up on top.  I have never wanted my sugar cookies to brown up on top and have been known to take them out a little early to make sure they don't.  I use the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this site by JBS Box and it works excellently with these cookies.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Super sugar cookies!  I made jumbo Christmas ball cut-outs (similar to the picture within the site which advertised "christmas cookies").  I made the dough a day ahead of time and refrigerated it in 2 "logs" wrapped in waxed paper.  The chilling was necessary, as even while working with it cold, it got a bit sticky.  I rolled each log out on my silicone baking sheet and cut cookies out directly on it, peeled off the uncut portion as the cut outs remained...this allowed me to not have to "move" each cut out to a baking sheet which would have been tough as the dough was soft/sticky (as mentioned above).  They turned out delicious...and stayed soft.  In general I detest making cut-outs, as I find them ot be WAY too much work but after tasting this recipe, it was worth the extra effort.

I thought that these were great soft sugar cookies.  Even the next day they were still soft.  I left out the nutmeg and used cream of tartar instead.  I frosted them with buttercream frosting and they were excellent.

This sugar cookie recipe is fabulous!  I had been looking for a recipe for soft and chewy sugar cookies, and this is it.  My husband loves them!  I added 1/4 tsp. or cream of tartar, and I left out the nutmeg.  I didn't refrigerate mine, I just rolled them out w/ a little flour between wax paper.  Yummy!

These were delicious! Soft and chewy. And, everyone that tried them loved them! Once, I substituted the sour cream for yogurt and they still turned out great!

This deserves absolutely no stars.  I made it as stated except cut the nutmeg in half.  Disgusting.  I like nutmeg, however it was still overpowering.  I made another batch without it altogether, and they still tasted like nothingness.  Just Ick.  No frosting could save them!!!

I've been searching for 10 years to find the perfect sugar cookie recipe...and this is it!  When I've made them as written, there were just two minor problems: they turned out fairly thin, no matter how thick I cut them, and the flavor was a tad bland.  But I knew this was a great base recipe for what I wanted and these changes fixed the flaws: I live at 4,500 feet in elevation, so I added 1/4 C. extra flour, which fixed the flatness; I also added a couple of drops of almond extract, which added a little kick but did not make the cookies taste like almond.  These adjustments produced thick, incredibly soft but sturdy, flavorful cookies.  Thank you!

I was going to make a fruit pizza for a BBQ and all the recipes either called for store bought dough or minimal ingredients that just bored me.  So I gave this recipe a try as the crust.  I was VERY pleased.  I used the full recipe for a 12 inch pizza pan and next time I will definitely just halve it b/c it was a very thick crust.  I omitted the nutmeg and used a bit of cream of tarter in its place.  Baked it for approx. 15 mins, which if I were to halve this I'm sure would take less time.  Took out of the oven as soon as the edged began to golden.  Completely cooled before I added icing and fruit.  The crust was firm yet still soft and not crisp.  Can't wait to use this recipe again!

Awesome sugar cookies. I started rolling them at an (accurate) 1/2 inch because the 1/4 inch ones were dry. Do not over bake! They leave kind of a sour after taste - but they are honestly worth it. I LOVE them, and the dough is a DREAM to work with. Just be sure to make them thick and don't bake too long. Better with a little sugar sprinkled on top before baking.

These are wonderful!!  I use a little powdered sugar when I roll them out (instead of flour).  Soft and delicious.  They store really well too.  Our new Favorite.  Thank you!

This has been my go-to recipe for sugar cookies for years. The only change I make is omitting the nutmeg, mainly because I don't like it. Everyone always looks bored when I tell them I've brought sugar cookies, until they try these and then they are converts. What I really love, is that the cookies themselves are not exceptionally sweet, so adding icing to them doesn't make them so sugary that no one can enjoy them.

This was fabulous! Soft, perfectly sweet sugar cookie. I made as directed but made sure that I made the butter and sugar mix really fluffy and then once I added the egg and sour cream - made sure it was very fluffy. I didn't put it in the fridge overnight but rolled it out and cut it into cookies. After the first batch came out a little firm with the recommended time- I decreased bake time to 6 minutes at 375 and let them cool on the pan for a good 5 minutes. Perfect. Soft, not brown on the bottom at all, no crispy edges- just soft and sweet. Fantastic recipe! The next time I make them I will make them thicker (getting only 2 doz or so), add a couple minutes to the bake time and ice them. They have the soft bakery feel and taste. Mmm!

This has to be the best sugar cookie recipe EVER.   I love Lofthouse cookies, but don't buy them any more, these are just as good.   I add almond flavor and other flavors to the cream cheese frosting I put on top and got great raves.  I tried rolling the batter into balls and flattening with a glass and that worked as well as cookie cutter, once I got the size right.

Finally found the best Soft Sugar Cookie. I made exactly the recipe and they were the best. I wanted to put a good icing on them but my sister is eating them as fast as they come out of the oven and by the way, we are not kids, I'm 58 and my sister is 68 and we don't eat a lot of sweets unless it is something really special and these are.

We're gluten free, so ii substituted namaste's perfect flour mix in place of the flour, and substituted cream of tarter for the nutmeg, per another reviewer's suggestion, and these were amazing! They puffed up nincely, but still kept their shape! Just a suggestion, i placed a sheet of partrament paper on the counter, put the dough on the a paper, then covered the dough up with wax paper, then rolled on top of that. I dipped the cookie cutter in sugar, then pressed it in, so the dough doesnt stick to the cookie, then peeled away the excess dough. then i picked up the sheet of parchment paper and placed it on the cookie sheet to bake. This way nothing sticks, you dont mess up the cookies moving them, and your counter stays clean!

These were the best Sugar Cookies I have every made…let’s say the only sugar cookies I have made.  I will keep this recipe for years to come.  I did take another’s cooks suggestion of adding cream of tarter.  I also add lemon zest to the wet batter.  I was able to get 69 cookies out of two batches of dough, using butterfly and flower cookie cutter.  These made a great addition to my daughter’s 2nd birthday party.  I made a cookie bouquet with them.  I found that it was easier to cut out all of my shapes, place them a cookie tray with wax paper and pop them back into the refrigerate until they were firm {25 – 30mins}.  This made transferring them to the baking sheet much easier; didn’t have to worry about them falling apart.  As they cooled, I used a bamboo skewer to make the hole for the lollipop stick.  I placed a small amount of the cookie icing on the lollipop stick and inserted into the cookie and decorated from there.  I will be making more of these for my niece’s birthday party this weekend.

By far, this is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried and I have been on the hunt for years!  Perfect for cut-outs - retains shapes nicely.  The sour cream adds an excellent flavor and keeps them extra soft and moist.  Baked three batches for valentine gifts and got rave reviews.  Be sure to roll them to at least 1/4 inch and watch them closely during the last few minutes of baking.  Remove them once a slight golden color appears. As with all cookies, they continue to bake once removed from oven.  You won't be dissapointed with this one!  Thanks Eileen!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Several years ago a friend had given me a similar recipe for cutouts, but I lost it.  I used the advanced search option and found this.  The sour cream and nutmeg make these cookies taste amazing!! I made a double batch for Christmas and my husband liked them so  much that he was a little stingy with them (didn't want to share). This will be my "go to" recipe for cutouts from now on!!

Finally! I found a recipe that is comparable to my grandma's sugar cookies! ... with a few changes. I don't know how much nutmeg I used, but I grated it in myself. I also added about a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and about a 1/16 of all spice.

I didn't chill it overnight - just left it in the fridge for an hour or so while I made another kind of cookie - then instead of rolling them out, I made about 1" balls and rolled them in a mix of granulated sugar and sugar in the raw - then baked them as is (not flattened) for about 11 minutes - transferring them to a wire rack after about a minute. They were very fluffy!

Aside from leaving out the nutmeg (not a fan) and adding a dash of cinnamon I followed this recipe step by step and for some reason my cookies didn't turn out right. They didn't puff up at all..not how other people have described their cookies. They are soft and chewy but look "caved in". I can't figure it out! Any input from others would be great. This was my first attempt at sugar cookies and I feel so annoyed at my result. I'm sure it's not the recipe..I must have gone wrong somewhere! :-(

I like this particular recipe because it uses sour cream.  If you want a plain vanilla sugar cookie, just omit the nutmeg.  In my opinion, this is the best "from scratch" recipe if you're looking for a copycat for the Lofthouse cookies. Of course, you would want to omit the numeg for the Lofthouse.

These cookies are super tasty, and super chewy delicious. I accidentally over baked the second batch, (don't let these cookies brown at all!) but they were good after I left them in a container overnight with a piece of bread. I also didn't add the nutmeg, as I wanted a flavored frosting, but they were tasty plain too.

I'm always looking for new and tasty new ways to make cookies and this one was excellent. Very true, it stays nice and soft, and uniquely has the nutmeg flavour to add some spice to your batch. Very yummy! For mine, I decided to have fun with dipping it in chocolate and it turned out awesome! Highly recommend :)

I have made this recipe many times.  Overtime the nutmeg has doubled.  It is also better if I only refrigerated it about 4 hours.  Overnight, it was rock hard and I had to break it up and beat on it to roll it out.  At about 4 hours, it still soft enough to roll without being sticky.  I put the dough back in the fridge while I roll out the first batch.    The cookies had a better texture when I didn't have to beat on the dough.

These DELIVER the SOFTEST cookies ever! My search has ended, these are stellar! They are exact duplicates of the frosted cookies found in the in-house bakery section on holidays at Jewel-Osco. I have tried other "soft sugar cookie" recipes.. and wound up with soft out of the oven, semi-soft by that night, and no longer soft at all the next day. I baked these on a Sunday, and they have stayed beautifully soft and moist in the refrigerator for 4 days running. I did however, only make 24 cookies out of this b/c I wanted them big. I also added an additional 1/4 cup sugar. Did not use a cutter, thus only refrigerated for an hour or so before I rolled them into ping pong size balls, and pressed to 1/4" with the bottom of a big mug. Was in a citrusy mode, so topped them with a half-batch of the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting on the site. The one that uses zest. These cookies are fantastic, and very filling! RAVE reviews!

I made these cookies for a meeting, and everyone loved them! I was asked for the recipe! They were so soft, and they were really tasty. I had seen a few reviews say that they were bland, but I put extra vanilla extract in them, and they were absolutely delicious! You won't regret making these!

Editing my original review to say:  Try replacing the nutmeg with 1/2 teaspoon Pumpkin Pie Spice.  OMG.  You're welcome! ?
 Beautiful cookies!  Not only do they NOT lose their shape, they are also PERFECT for shipping!  After years of searching, finally a cut-out sugar cookie recipe I'm keeping.  My cookie dough was perfect and not flimsy at all.  Miraculously my cut-outs did not loose their form when transfering to the cookie sheet... wow.  That had been a big problem in the past using other recipes.  These were simple to throw together in a pinch, I had most all ingredients on hand, and the result was a very soft, chewy, buttery cookie that held delightfully.  I am so happy with these!  Thanks!

Best sugar cookie of all time. My sweetie chooses these over his previous favorite, chocolate chip. Spice to your tastes, I added a little pumpkin pie spice along with the nutmeg. They freeze well too and remain soft. Make extra batches if you want to freeze some, they won't last long!

Easy recipe and cookies turned out great with a few changes. I replaced half of the nutmeg with cinnamon and I reduced the amount of flour to about 3 and 1/3 cups and used a cookie scoop to shape them into balls. Then I flattened each cookie with the bottom of a sugar coated glass. The first sheet I baked for 10 minutes, but they were a little rare for my taste. The second I baked for a little longer and they turned out great. I think these should be baked for at least 10 minutes, but maybe my oven is a little off. Thanks for a great cookie recipe that helped me use up some sour cream!

Bland. Granted, I am a sweet-tooth, so perhaps that just doesn't suit my preference. But my husband doesn't like sweet things, and according to him, these cookies are "tolerable." Please do not ignore the other bad reviews on here like I did. If you like the sweet type of sugar cookies you buy at a grocery store bakery, you ill not like these.

EXCELLENT!!!  I had no problem with the dough, and I did NOT chill it.  I just rolled it out on waxed paper.  Use a long strip of paper, and roll the dough out the length of the paper.  It works great.  You can roll this dough out again and again until all your cookies are cut.    The nutmeg is overpowering though - decrease it to 1/8 tsp.  I used the full 1/4 and wow, it tastes like pumpkin pie cookies.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar.  I might even eliminate the nutmeg next time.   These are excellent with a sour cream/cream cheese icing.  WOW WOW WOW!

These are good. Made them for Easter.  It's soft and cake like, but not very sweet and it lacked in flavour.....Untill I tried one the next day! The flavours seems to "come out" overnight. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it tasted! I didn't add the nutmeg, but did add 1 TSP.of almond extract and 1 TSP of butter flavouring. I chilled the dough overnight so therefore I had no problems rolling and cutting the dough. It baked in 8 minutes as the recipe indicated.  Thx.

This is the first time I've made sugar cookies. I didn't use them for cut-outs (my dough was too soft for that), but I decorated them with halloween colored frosting and sprinkles. It was soft, delicious, and definitely a recipe to keep. The baking time for me was a little longer though because my cookies were bigger.

I made this without the nutmeg because I don't like it.  The dough was SUPER EASY to work with.  I didn't even refrigerate my second batch and it was very easy to use.  The cookies are still soft after 6 days.  I iced with Sugar Cookie Frosting submitted by Katy Brandt and they are perfect!

BEST EVER!!! I have been searching for a good sugar cookie recipe and my trail ends here. They are so easy to manage and hold their shape well when cooked. The best part is how soft they are. I despise crunchy cookies and these are moist and tender, even a few days later. I've used plain yogurt in place of sour cream and half splenda and they turn out wonderfully. I've tried more splenda and I don't know if that ruined them but they came out bland and weird. Can't rave about these enough!

Are you sure it's four cups flour and only 1 1/2 cups sugar? These cookies did not turn out for me at all. They are very bland and not sweet at all. They taste almost like playdoh or over cooked pancakes.  It's nice to see that other people had this same problem.

These cookies were great!!  I stuck them in the freezer to chill for about 45 minutes and used powdered sugar to help roll them out.   I added a bit more vanilla than called for and also put about 2 tablespoons of zested orange peel. They were so tasty and sweet we didn't even frost them, but a cranberry frosting would be awesome with the orange peel, I'm sure. I might cut the sugar back a bit next time and frost them.

These cookies were not very good at all. :( The were bland and they had a very belch taste. I don't think it was me though, I took every step with caution as I always do and double checked every move i made. I was super excited about them too. What a shame. I will just have to try a different recipe.

My girlfriend has a sugar cookie recipe that she got from this site that contained sour cream so I tried this one.  A very good sugar cookie and very easy to decorate but not quite as good as my girlfriend's recipe.  I'll have to ask her for her recipe.  Still, this one is going into my recipe box.  I really enjoyed them and it was super easy.  I had even left the dough in the fridge for 2 days (too tired to make the first day) and it was still really good.  Thanks.

I made the cookies with yoghurt instead of sour cream they came out GREAT! The dough was so soft and stick so I couldn't roll it out to use cookies cutters. I just rolled the dough into small balls and flatten them out. The cookies puff right up when cooking. My husband loves these move than the soft cookies sold at supermarkets.

Simply amazing! I made 6 batches this past Christmas and everyone loved them! Getting ready to make them for Valentine's day now. They freeze great without frosting, so I make them ahead and frost them when I pull them out of the freezer. When short on time, I use a cookie scoop, roll them into balls and mash them down to my desired thickness with a glass dipped in flour and bake as directed. Less mess and much faster than rolling out and using cookie cutters!

These sugar cookies were exactly what I was looking for. They're soft, moist, and delicious! I used the nutmeg in the first batch of cookies but chose not to use it in the second batch because I didn't care for the taste. My husband isn't a sugar cookie person but thought these were great. They were perfect for my son's 3rd birthday. They were a little dificult to use for the cookie bouquet but I made it work and it turned out great. This is now my go to sugar cookie recipe.

OK, so when I first made these and tasted them they were hard! I couldn't believe it, I was so disappointed because all the reviews raved about them being soft, I didn't know what I did wrong! But not having time to frost them that night, I stored them and frosted them the next evening (for the kids sake) I'm so glad I did because they were soft and tasted good with or with out the frosting!! Day three and they still are soft and almost gone! I still don't know what happened (I followed the recipe exactly) but they are now wonderful and will be the only ones I make in the future!!  The only thing I plan on doing differently is not roll and cut them out, I'll just make balls and flatten so they are even thicker!

These really were soft! Excellent idea, to use sour cream for texture in a cookie! The dough was a bit difficult to work with however, it was really sticky and it stuck to the cookie cutters and my fingers. Overall though it was fun to make and had great reviews for the party i made them for.

We used this recipe to make Valentines cookies this year and the results were delicious.  The dough was not easy to work with, but not impossible either.  That seems to be the case with all sugar cookie dough from all the recipes and reviews that I've read.  I worked with one-third of the dough at a time, keeping the remainder cold in the fridge.  I used a big cookie cutter, which I think added to the dough being hard to deal with.  Next time I will used smaller cookie cutters.  The flavor of the baked cookies was great and they were so nice and soft.  We topped the cookies with the Decorator Frosting from this site and they were a great combination together.

These cookies are absolutely delicious just on their own.  Combine them with "Decorater Frosting" by P Oakes and they are fantastic.  Everyone loves them!

great cookie!  I have a wedding coming up soon and we are making house shaped cookies along with a donation to Habitat for Humanity.  So I needed a good soft cookie recipe and after I tried 3 other recipies, my whole family and friends agreed that this was the best cookie.  Make sure to make the dough thin enough to mainain cookie shapes, but otherwise a great cookie!  Plus, I used freshly shaved Nutmeg and it makes a world of difference!

I am on the hunt for the perfect sugar cookie recipe. My ideal cookie is one that is thick, chewy, and soooo delicious, it doesn't need frosting (Kind of like the ones they sell just out of the oven at Catalanos in Fresno).  Anyway, these cookies were good, a little cake like though and definitely needed frosting or sprinkles.

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was to add grated orange rind to the dough.  It was easy to handle, did not stick to my rolling pin - and my family raved about the cookies.  I iced them with a regular powdered sugar icing and decorated them for Christmas.  Thanks!

These are hands-down the best sugar cookies I have ever eaten. I just substitute the sour cream for cream cheese and they still taste amazing. I’ve also found that they still stay soft in an airtight container for days. They have just the right amount of sweetness to complement my royal icing. Definitely recommend this recipe everyone devours my cookies!!

Finally found a keeper!  Exactly what I have been looking for.  These rolled out like a dream.  Most other roll-out cookies are simply way too sweet to add frosting to.  These are perfectly sweet to eat on their own, but not too sweet so you can add frosting, glaze or sugar crystals and it will not be too overpowering.  They baked up thick, soft and hearty.  Not a single broken one! I did add 1/2 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract to add more flavor as others suggested.

Used this recipe to make snowflake cookies for my daughter's Frozen birthday party. Made the dough exactly as the instructions stated but omitted the nutmeg and added a teaspoon of almond extract. Chilled the dough overnight and even frozen the cut outs before baking them. The first batch came out a little brown on the corners so I lowered the temp to 350 for 8 mins and they were PERFECT! The dough did puff a little despite the freezing and lost a little detail in the cut outs but not much. I frosted them with royal icing and just had one after leaving them in a Tupperware all night and they are SO SOFT and yummy. Maybe the best recipe for sugar cookies I've ever used. Thank you so much!!

Wonderful recipe!! Been looking for a soft sugar cookie and I believe this is it. Excellent texture, and not too sweet nor spicy. I added 1/4tsp cream of tartar, and added and extra tsp of vanilla ( personal pref.). Only chilled dough for 15/20 mins ( no need to chill really). I decided to roll the dough for Xmas shapes, worked out great, but guess my cutters were too big?? LOL... I have very large cookies, which turned out to make 30 cookies in all. Used coloured sugar on some and will icing some later once cooled. Definitely keeper !! Thanx so much for this great recipe.

Great recipe. Tastes wonderful like shortbread/sugar from the bakery. Didn't change the recipe except added a little extra flour (about 1/4 cup).I cut out with a water glass, it made two dozen (minus one we ate the raw dough). Split into 3 baggies put in freezer for an hour, they cut and baked perfectly. Baked about 8 at a time on parchment paper and kept dough refrigerated in between. Used "sugar cookie icing" on this site. They look very close to bakery style. I have a feeling I will get requests for these. Next time I will ice them prettier I was in a hurry and had to go with Red/Blue for our school colors.

Very soft, but not very sweet. Don't make them too thick... they'll end up tasting like biscuits!

Made exactly as recipe stated and they came out delicious. Made them for Easter, so I used springtime cookie cutters and pastel icing.

I liked the idea of adding sour cream, but I would not follow this recipe again. There is too much flour in this recipe. My dough and cookies were very dry. Considering the picture of this recipe has frosting on the cookies, I am assuming you are supposed to ice them because the cookies are not sweet at all by themselves. I only baked half of my dough and for my second batch, I am going to roll little dough balls in sugar and bake them like snickerdoodles. Hopefully that should get them sweet enough.  If I were to make these again, I would only use 3 cups of flour. Maybe even less. I am surprised to hear that people didn't like the nutmeg because I loved the nutmeg hint. Always use fresh nutmeg because the pre-ground stuff tastes awful.

Yummy! The sour cream makes it soft and the nutmeg is the secret to the great taste. Unfortunately, it is not sugar enough to be great like the sugar cookies in the stores. I use this recipe for parties. Every body loves it and thinks it is more of a sweet donut or cake because of the texture and taste. Bummer~oh will, it's good. You should give it a try.

amazing.  i cut back on the nutmeg-just a small dash will do- and added 1 teaspoon cream of tarter.  these cookies are really nice when they are a bit thicker.  yummmm, the sugar cookie recipe i've been looking and looking for.

SOFT COOKiES!! Just what I have been looking 4! even though I didn't read the recipe clearly(ran out of sugar so halfed the recipe,didn't refridgerate dough overnight made just an hour or less)  Rolled out great,don't bake too long and they actually seemed to get softer with each day,I eyeballed the nutmeg so a little strong but it gave it a different flavor that I really liked! Try this it is a great soft rollout recipe!

i've made 3 different sugar cookie recipes recently (all top rankers on allrecipes), and this one beat all of them. it produces soft "cake-like" cookies similar to the texture of the ones at the grocery store. it's exactly what i wanted, and the only adjustment i made was reducing the nutmeg a bit!

This is THE BEST sugar cookie recipe I've ever used. If you REALLY want to knock your guests/ family/ boyfriend off their feet, use the "Butter Frosting" recipe on top. I used red  food coloring for Valentine's Day cookies and they tasted better AND looked better than anything you could buy at the store!

If you like thick, soft, delicious cutout sugar cookies, this is your recipe!  They remind me of the good cutouts in the mall stores but they taste a lot better!  Good with icing or just with sprinkles (LOTS of sprinkles).  The dough is really easy to work with.

Absolutely delicious!  These cookies were flavorful, soft (even a few days later) and easy to work with.  I didn't even chill the dough a long time.  I just rolled it out, put it on a cookie sheet, and set it in the freezer for 1/2 hour. Then it was well-chilled and easy to work with.  This is a great sugar cookie recipe if you're bored with the flavorless ones you usually get at holidays.

I just made these and they turned out fabulous. I did not change anything. The dough did not stick when I rolled it out which is why I have dreaded making sugar coookies in the past.  They tuned out soft and perfect.  I will use this recipe again.  Thanks!

My only note about this recipe is that for us, it only made 20 cookies.  I rolled them out a bit thicker than 1/4 inch and I guess all cookie cutters are slightly different sizes . . . I used the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe with no dye, added colored sprinkles, and they turned out so perfect, delicious and beautiful!

The texture of these are amazing with the sour cream, they stayed moist for many days.  My boyfriend and his friend liked these a lot.  the only thing I would try next time would be adding a bit more sugar...not quite the perfect taste.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! it is wonderful!  I have used this recipe and it has replaced our family sugar cookie recipe! I take these cookies to work and EVERYONE wants the recipe! They are really that good! I do suggest that you put them in an air tight container after you are finished with them cooling and they will stay soft for over 5days! Thank You so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Was really disapointed with the first batch - WAAAY too much nutmeg. The cookies were potent & that's all you could taste. Made a second batch with just a shake or two of nutmeg...then a third and fourth batch! Once you take out the overpowering nutmeg, they are scrumptious!

These were so yummy. Like one of the other reviews, I did not chill them as I didn't have time. The first batch I rolled out on wax paper and used my cutters. Then I pulled out the dough between the cookies and left them on the paper so they wouldn't tear or stretch shape. There was steam when I opened the oven, but they came out great. The rest of the dough was able to chill enough while I did my first batch. I suggest cream cheese frosting and lots of sugar sprinkles.

This is a wonderful tasting sugar cookie.  The only complaint I have is that my cookies were flat....however, my baking soda and powder have been around for a while so it just could have been that they were no longer any good. Since they didn't puff up, they also were a little overbaked. However, even with the cookies being flat and a little overbaked, there were still good.  I love nutmeg and it gave the cookies a different taste.  Icing covers a multitude of sins they tasted pretty darn good!  This recipe is a keeper.

Next time, mental note, have fresh baking soda and powder and I am sure these will be five stars! :)

I was very careful to follow the recipe closely, but the cookies didn't turn out very well.  Although the cookies really are soft (not chewy, just soft), the taste is just okay.  It's a little bland.  The dough was very difficult to work with.  When it's chilled, it's very hard and very crumbly so it didn't roll out smoothly.  Once it softened up a little, it became very sticky even after I floured the surface, the rolling pin, and the cookie cutters.  I really like the idea of a soft sugar cookie, but it's just too messy to work with the dough, especially when I am hoping to do shaped cutouts.  I would recommend people who are trying this recipe for the first time to just make little balls of the dough, maybe roll it in some sugar, and flatten it with the bottom of a glass.  If you find the dough workable for you, then you can try to do cut-outs the next time.

This wasn't a good recipe at all.  I followed the recipe to the T except I added 2 tsp vanilla instead of 1.  The cookie tasted very bland and very doughy texture.  I won't make this ever again.

I hadn't made cut out cookies in over 4 years, and the last time I did, they lost their shape after baking and weren't the soft, chewy texture I craved for. So, I decided to give this recipe a shot, since I need to bring some to a cookie decorating party next week. I followed the directions as listed, omitting the nutmeg (since I didn't have any on hand). Chilled the dough overnight in the fridge. I took it out at 6 am the next day and was worried because it got REALLY hard overnight and I wondered if this would make it too difficult to roll out. Amazingly, after warming up the dough a bit by kneading it (by hand), it rolled out fairly easily and cur outs were clean. I tasted one as soon as it came out of the oven, and it was not too sweet and pretty soft. I froze all of the cookies since the party is not for a week..so, I hope they stay soft once I defrost them. They aren't quite the soft cookie I was expecting (I was hoping they'd be like the soft frosted ones you buy at the grocery store), but they held their dhape nicely and will do well with frosting.

These cookies were amazing. I loved that the website automatically altered ingredient measurements for you when you changed the amount of servings. These are the best sugar cookies I have ever made!!

Great cookies, not overly sweet but that is what we prefer.  Freshly grated nutmeg was a great addition.  I frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. Will definitely make again.

WOW!  This is the perfect sugar cookie!  I took others advice and omitted the nutmeg and added 1/4 tsp. almond extract.  I couldn't wait to make them, so only chilled for 3 hours, then sprinkled wax paper with powdered sugar and added a little to the dough. Rolled out great and very easy to work with after that.  Also baked for about 7-7 1/2 min.  Used Really Good Frosting recipe from this site to top the cookies and they were de-lish!!!  Thanks a million.  This is my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on.

This is the first time I have ever written a review for a recipe, but this one was so good I was compelled to comment on it. This was excellent!!!! I changed it a little but I was extremely pleased with the outcome.I added lemon zest and lemon extract to the batter and I also frosted it with a simple lemon frosting. My family raved about this one!! Thank you so much. I loved it!

I am not a big sugar cookie fan (baked these for hubby), but these are really good.  I love the nutmeg flavor so much (which I usually hate) that I add a little extra, and I also added 1 tsp (could add more) of butter flavor extract, which really put it over the top.  Make sure you do not overcook, and these will stay soft until they're gone.

This recipe is wonderful!  I did not use any nutmeg as my young children aren't big on it, but it was still wonderful.

It is now 5 days after making the cookies and they are still soft.  I think the key to soft cookies (versus crunchy) is to take them out of the oven as the bottom edge begins to turn golden brown.  I only baked them for 7 minutes and they were not underdone.

Will use this again and again!

I didn't use cut outs with this dough, so I had no reason to refrigerate it. I made balls and rolled them in sugar, and baked them the maximum amount. The time was perfect, the texture and softness was perfect...but they just weren't sweet enough...they seemed more cakey than soft and chewy like sugar cookies should be I think. I will try this recipe again, but I think I will add and extra 1/2 C of sugar and see if that helps.

These cookies were so good and so easy to make.  I love a soft sugar cookie, and I've never seen cookies disappear so quickly.  I skipped the nutmeg just because I don't really like it.  I did not have any trouble with rolling out the dough. In fact, I did refrigerate my dough for a few hours before and didn't even have to use flour to roll them out until the dough warmed up.  They do get puffy like others said, so don't use a real detailed cookie cutter.  I will definitely be using this recipe in the future!

For this recipe I made a few alterations. I added some brown sugar, a teaspoon of lemon extract, an extra teaspoon of vanilla and switched the sour cream to about vanilla yogurt as I had read in another review, but only added about 1/3 cup. The dough itself tasted amazing to me, and the cookies came out pretty well. I'd have to say that they really do need a frosting on them though, and they do get pretty stiff, but that could be from using less yogurt instead of the sour cream. I like the touch of lemon flavor the extract added to it.

My husband is NOT a sugar cookie fan, but absolutely LOVED these.  They are soft and stay soft, and they also have a great flavor!!  I did have to roll the dough out between two pieces of wax paper but it was really easy, and I didn't let them chill over night either.  They worked great!!  And yes they hold their shape very very well!!

My boyfriend, another cookie monster, had some soft sugar cookies with frosting on them in Florida.  He tried a cookie that looked somewhat similar at our local bakery but he said it was horrible - like a muffin top with frosting.  Being both pretty obsessed with cookies in general, we decided to try to make the same cookie he had in Florida.
I read all the reviews of the various Soft Sugar Cookie recipes and decided this was probably the closest based on his description.  We used the 7 minute frosting recipe from this site (by the way, it took way over 7 minutes by hand beating so we switched to an electric mixer).  We also made a black and white using this cookie and the 7 minute frosting plus for the "black", melted Lindt Bittersweet Chocolate. This was a good, clear recipe and my cookie monster said it was close to the Florida recipe but what I realized is that I personally prefer my sugar cookies crispy and very buttery (I use a recipe from the International Cookie  Cookbook).  Thank you for this recipe - I noticed on other sites that this is a modification of a southern recipe which might explain why Cookie Monsters can find the soft sugar cookies in Florida.

These were just perfect.  Easy to roll out, easy to cut, baked up soft yet retained the butout shape.  These  have just the right sweetness for adding a little frosting on top.  Great recipe.

I used more nutmeg (because I love nutmeg) and had to sub yogurt for the sour cream (I was out); I don't believe these have quite the texture I'm looking for in a sugar cookie, but they rolled out nicely. I'll give them another try with the sour cream.

This is, hands down, the BEST sugar cookie recipe I have ever found. I was having a ferocious craving for soft, frosted sugar cookies. I stumbled upon this, and made them. The only variation I did was instead of nutmeg, I used Pumpkin Pie Spice- Mmmmmm, delicious! XD I used the Cookie Frosting Recipe, and it was wonderful. These cookies didn't last very long, here- we ate them all! I shared with my friends, and now people are asking when I'm going to make them again!

Made these yesterday...the dough is soooooo good!  If you undercook them a little, they will be very soft....if you overcook them (I overcooked 1 pan and had to throw them away) they will be crumbly.  The cookie itself is good - although I think the nutmeg is a little overpowering - and will use a little less next time.  My son and husband love them.  They're worth the effort and I will make them again!

I thought this was a really good soft sugar cookie recipe.  It has great flavor.  I do agree with another reviewer that these are not good for detailed cookie cutters.  They poof up way to much to show fine detail, but the basic heart and pumpkin cutters work nicely.  And for any others needing to substitute nutmeg....please use cinnamon or allspice, not cream of tartar! :)

Ok, I substituted cream of tarter for nutmeg because I didn't have any nutmeg (read that someone else did that), BIG MISTAKE. Cookies tasted like playdoh, they were awful. Don't know if it's because of the substitution but I'm not trying them again to find out. Dough rolled out nicely though, made nice looking cut-outs.

These cookies are not personally one of my favorites but my family LOVES them and this recipe. If you have a simple cookie cutter the better. This recipe tends to puff up alot obscuring small shapes with alot of detail ( I used a lamb 2 1/2" cutter and it did not work well.)  However, It  worked wonderful for the bigger more simple cutters that we used that didn't have as much detail. (pumpkins) I would use the recipe again.

i made these for my sisters bridal shower and used a heart shape cutter and hard icing colored pink.  they were a huge hit - i even printed extra recipie cards to pass out.  this is the best recipie i have found for a soft sugar cookie.  they are also great for cutters.  thank you.....

I have tried many sugar cookie recipes. They all turn out the same. Too brown, too hard. These are teriffic! The sour cream really makes them soft. Wonderful recipe. I used almond extract insted of vanilla for a different taste.

This is by far the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever used. If you do not over bake the cookies they turn out perfect every time! They have a great flavor and will stay soft for days! I like to frost them with buttercream frosting dyed with food coloring to fit the occasion! Thanks

I just started putting nutmeg in my sugar cookies and love the flavor it gives.  I made these cookies using my convection oven.  It automatically set the temp to 350 degrees.  Normally, I decrease the bake time by a minute or two.  For these, the optimal time (at 2500 ft in elevation) was 5 minutes!  They were soft through;  the ones baked longer (max time was 7 minutes) just are crispier; still tasty!!

These were tasty and soft!  We added almond extract as that is our favorite flavor in sugar cookies. We cut them out thick as some recommended and they kept their shape. I must say though, that they rolled horribly. They kept cracking and flaking and even after attempts of getting the dough cold again it doesn’t go back together seamlessly. It took a us hours of freezing and rerolling the dough before I gave up and said were going to make these into regular (non-cut-out) sugar cookies. And they were even awful to roll into balls without separating and cracking. The flavor and softness was on point but I will be trying other recipes for ease of rolling. This did NOT fit that bill for us.

I decided to try this recipe d/t the reviews and the fact that sour cream is an ingredient. I figured this must be the magic ingredient that propels it from the boring, avg. sugar cookie recipes one usually finds. I live in AZ and followed the recipe exactly. The dough turned out silky smooth and tasted delicious w/ a delicate sweetness. I refrigerated overnight and used minimal flour and sugar to roll to 1/2" thickness and cut w/ large Christmas cookie cutters. I convection baked them close to 10 min d/t thickness- I did not find they baked puffy rather they retained their shape very nicely. I attribute this to 3 things: cold dough, fresh baking soda and real butter. They cooked slightly golden and were perfectly balanced; not too chewy or crunchy. I used a royal icing that included cream of tartar and vanilla extract. It complimented the doughs low-key sweetness well. Once iced they looked like glass- this type of icing made layering colors easy giving the cookies dimension. My family and I love this recipe. It's a keeper and repeater for sure.

We loved these--soft, but not too soft. I left out the nutmeg, and they had a great flavor. The dough was very easy to work with, and I only let it sit in the fridge maybe 10-15 minutes.

Held it’s shape well but the flavor wasn’t quite what I was wanting for a sugar cookie. Cooked them less than noted, but might just be my oven.

These are disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly. No substitutions, subtractions or additions. They came out soft, this is true, but also bland and flavorless. 

These taste just like cake mix cookies. They do not taste like cookies made from scratch. 

I suppose they might be a good base for cut cookies with icing.

Super soft and delicious. I doubled the recipe and used half almond extract and half vanilla extract. I only refrigerated the dough for a few hours, not overnight. I baked for 9 minutes. My kids decorated with sprinkles before they were baked instead of frosting them. Definitely using this recipe each year!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe. I followed everything to the exact measure but for the nutmeg. Instead, I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of ginger. I rested the dough overnight and cooked for about 6 minutes. They had such a great flavor, like cookies from a bakery. My family loved them. Merry Christmas!

Made this with my son last week. Over all it was easy to understand and make. Though my son is impatient and he refused to wait for it to refrigerate, I did put it in the freezer for a bit and it did help. They tasted great! The nutmeg was a little over powering but with the icing recipe I used it helped cut through the nutmeg. I THINK I may have baked mine a little too Lin as they came out a little dry but still soft. Even a few seconds over or under does make a HUGE difference. I believe he and I will be trying this recipe again today, will let everyone know how they come out this time around.

Makes perfect cookie dough.  Easy to work with.  Bakes up very well as thin or thick cookies.  Nutmeg adds the perfect taste.  I make my icing with sour cream as well, which cuts down the overly sugary taste of the icing.
You must try this recipe.

My son and I made these cookies last night. He begged and begged for Pac Man cookies. I have to admit once they were baked I was a little worried about how they tasted. They were good but missing something. The icing! Borrowed a really simple and delicious icing recipe I found in Pinterest and I have to say together they taste AWESOME! I will def be using this recipe again.

Soft sour cream sugar cookie perfection. Look no further, my friends. For those who might want a little more complexity in their cookie, I added a dash of cardamom and a tiny dash of anise. Wow. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have used this identical recipe from my old McCalls cookbook for many many years. I always omit the nutmeg and roll them rather thickly (at least 1/4 inch). They are my kids favorite. I usually frost them with a type of cooked fondant icing flavored with mint, for Christmas cookies.

We LUV these cookies but after making this recipe for many years... I read that adding oil makes them even SOFTER!  I did just that (1/2 oil &1/2 butter) & after baking the cookies,  that one change made a BIG difference! 
Try it.. I know u'll be pleasantly surprised!!!

Perfect sugar cookie! Followed recommendations and only used 1/2c oil plus 1/2tsp almond extract. I didn't even have to refrigerate before rolling out and dough was easy to work with and kept shape.

Absolutely one of the best! Have made them over and over. They are always soft. I don't usually add the nutmeg, but that's preference, not necessary. The best is that they don't crumble as you eat them either!

Lots of rave reviews from my co-workers.  I made these cookies for Valentines Day. I have two kids at college and needed to find a cookie to mail. I stuck to the recipe but took the advise of others and added 1 tsp of cream of tartar. I omitted the nutmeg as a personal choice and instead added 1/8 tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla. Before refrigerating, I divided the dough into thirds, patting each third into a flat circle, wrapped each in plastic wrap and refrigerated.  Each circle was ready to roll out that way. I will use this recipe again.

I thought these cookies turned out just OK. I made them for me and my family and the general consensus was that they weren't sweet enough, they were bland, and the texture was a bit off. They make a decent cookie if you don't like too much sweetness, but don't make these expecting a traditional sugar cookie flavour and texture.

Did not enjoy this recipe at all.  I used real butter and real vanilla.  The cookies were BLAH, the predominant flavour was baked flour.  Ignore the bad reviews at your own peril 8(

I made sugar skull cookies out of these and they came out great. They were for a kids party and everyone loved them. They gold their shape best if you chill the dough before you cut am then roll them. I also let them sit in the freezer for about 10 mins before I baked them. I made a simple royal icing using pasteurized egg whites and decorators sugar. They were perfect

Made these cookies with my daughter and was a little let down. The dough was on the dry side and the cookies had a floury taste to them. I think they would be better with less flour...

These cookies were surprisingly delicious! Similar to another reviewer, they may look like your average sugar cookie, but everyone who tried it was always surprised by how good they tasted. They loved the texture as well! My husband brought them to work and they were a big hit! I did roll them extra thick and then hand cut the hearts with a knife. (I didn't have a cookie cutter that shape.) I split the dough in half and wrapped each half with saran and put in the freezer for an hour and they were easy to roll. Could have left them for less time actually. I also reduced the cooking time to 5mins because I have a dark pan. And definitely keep the nutmeg. Delicious!

I really loved this recipie. However I got half way through creaming the butter and measuring out everything before I realized I was out of eggs. I substituted one tablespoon ground flax seed for each egg. I also didn't have enough sour cream so I substituted cream cheese for the remaining amount, It was about 1/4 c. I also let the dough sit over night. They rolled out and cut great. I rolled them in powdered sugar and baked for 5-6 mins. They held their shape and have great flavor, not too sweet. They are slightly nuttier because of the flax seed, But they taste just fine to my family. I will make this again next year.

Kind of blah...I was looking for a soft, roll-out sugar cookie that tastes great, and these WERE soft; however, they were somewhat bland-even with the nutmeg.  I think I'm looking for something that doesn't exist! :(

These cookies were definitely softer - almost cake like.  My husband liked to eat them all by themselves with no frosting. I on the other hand did not think they were sweet enough - the nutmeg seemed strong to me.

I did not refrigerate the dough overnight - instead I placed in the freezer to harden to make cutting shapes easier.  Lots of flour also helped.

I would try another recipe before coming back to this one...it was not bad, but I am looking for a different flavor and texture - even though this was soft.

These cookies are absolutely perfect!!  They stayed soft until the last one was gone!  The dough is super smooth, the baked cookies have a delicate sweetness, and I wouldn't hesitate to give these as gifts, that's how great they turn out!  I substituted the nutmeg with a few drops of lemon extract!

Very happy with this recipe. I have been using a different sugar cookie recipe for years, and my husband asked me to find one that was "softer".  I make LOTS of Christmas cookies, and I had high hopes for this recipe. It didn't disappoint.  I topped it with Icing For Sour Cream Cookies from this site and it was a nice balance of a sweet topping on this cookie.

Best soft sugar cookie recipe I've tried to date! Puffed up beautifully and stayed soft; didn't run thin like many other recipes. I personally liked the nutmeg, but definitely leave out if you don't--it's noticable. Will certainly make again!!

I just finished my first batch of these and I followed the recipe exactly. 1/4 tsp of nutmeg is definitely too much!  Next time I'll try half that amount, but otherwise, they're pretty tasty.    My little niece asked for strawberry cookies, so I have a batch of dough chilling in the fridge right now where I replaced the nutmeg and vanilla with 4 tbsp of powdered strawberry Nesquick and used only 1 cup sugar (since Nesquick already has a lot of sugar in it). I'll let you know how that turns out...

These came out very nice, had a puffiness to them. but still flat enough to decorate. You need to think ahead and have them sit in the fridge for a day, I let them sit for two. Then let them thaw most of the day since the dough was rock hard. But they rolled out wonderfully with not alot of flour and baked nicely.  the taste was more appealing than the Valentines sugar cookies so will stick this recipe unless there is something better.

I would give these three stars...because I liked them, but I will not make them again. To me the cookies were a little too hard/tough, and the flavor just wasn't there. I was able to save them with some really good frosting. But I will stick to my old cookie recipe from now on.

These turned out, just as expected.  I baked my first batch a little too long, and the cookies weren't as soft as I hoped.  So definitely watch them closely.  The nutmeg was really delicious.

After losing my great grandma's sugar cookie recipe this Christmas, I was in need for a replacement. This recipe is perfect if you love soft sugar cookies - and they stay sooo soft when stored in an air tight cookie tin. I only used a pinch of nutmeg and added a pinch of cream of tartar after reading other reviews. Also I did not let the dough chill in the fridge, as I didn't have time, but they still came out wonderfully. I'll keep this recipe in my arsenal for years to come.

Just the texture/puff factor I was looking for.  I froze the dough for several days before rolling and baking, and found it extremely easy to work with.

If I had it to do all over again, I would have omitted the nutmeg.   I did add a splash of lemon extract, but I liked that touch. These cookies taste like what you would find in the bakery section of the grocery store.  You know, the ones that are in the glass case and are usually decorated with a glaze icing- round smiley faces or christmas tree shaped. Not my favorite, but I love the crumb.  I would make this again, but perhaps with no nutmeg, no lemon extract and a bit of almond extract. The dough gets stiff fast. I baked these on the top rack so the bottoms wouldn't burn on me( like in the picture)

With only two small changes these cookies were exactly what our family loves in a sugar cookie...Very soft, almost like a tea cake.  I added 1/4 c. extra sugar to the dough, and used lemon extract instead of the nutmeg.  Definitely a keeper.

These were pretty tastey.  You really need to watch the cook-time as if you over bake them they are no longer soft.  I'll probably make these again.

Delicious and lots of flavor.  The sour cream makes it moist and taste like more. These are a fun favorite and so easy to make.  We try to leave the cinnamon dots off of some for those who don't care for the spice and add peppermint flavor to part of the batch and add white dot candies.

These are AMAZING.  Officially my new sugar cookie recipe.  I followed the recipe with the nutmeg and thought it was good, but you could definitely taste it so if you aren't crazy about nutmeg you can use half or none at all and the cookies would still be good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies tasted very good! The only reason I didn't rate them 5 stars is because they're not quite the right texture...I want really thick, fluffy, chewy sugar cookies. 
 Made a very tasty snack, though...and fun to decorate!

I hate to be negative, especially when everyone else raved about these cookies, but I was very disappointed. I made them for my fiance, who loves sugar cookies, but they had very little flavor and a very cakey consistency.  However, they are true to their name and remained soft.

My husband made these last night and we found them to be quite good. We had them without a sugar cookie glaze last night but since I love frosted sugar cookies, I couldn't go without it today. Made the Sugar Cookie frosting from this site. Delicious, very similar to Firstlight's Frosted Sugar Cookie sold at finer coffeeshops.

These cookies are great. They stayed soft overnight and into the next day. By then they were all gone. I also froze some and after defrosting they were also still soft. I used Decorator Frosting, which was a great frosting for the cookie.

The sugar cookies I've made in the past have always been rock hard. These were super soft and stayed that way for a couple of days. I halved the recipe somewhat easily, and they were delicious. I used the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe from this website and we gobbled them up!

These did stay soft but did not have alot of flavor. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg which you could taste.  Rolled about 1/4" thick & baked for 6 minutes or so.  Very filling.

These were so-so. They turned out nice and soft, stayed tender for days and the nutmeg addition was good. I rolled them out and used a cookie cutter, and they kept their shape during baking. I don't know though - I think I'll keep looking for a better sugar cookie. These seemed kind of bland, even with sugar sprinkled over or with icing. I might be used to a more buttery flavoured sugar cookie, and these weren't.

These cookies were absolutely wonderful! They stayed soft for a week and a 1/2 till the last cookie and they were an absolute hit with the family. The nutmeg definitely gives it the christmas touch and you can't eat just one! Thanks so much!

This is not my favorite.  The cookies are soft, but they lacked in flavor, even after adding lemon extract and lemon juice.  It could be that I'm used to whole wheat flour, but I think they could have used a bit more salt.

Yes, I have to agree with another reviewer that mentioned that this cookie is more cake-like. I hoped to make a denser, more flavorful cookie. This cookie lives up to its name, but lacks flavor and density. My cookie dough was near impossible to roll- even after refrigerating for hours. I'm not clear if it was the humidity or if the butter was too soft. I finally gave up and rolled the dough into balls and flattened them 'snickerdoodle-style'. I made a royal icing and added a little almond extract to compensate for lack of flavor.

Cookies were really good. The nutmeg added a great little flare and I also added almond flavoring, which made it really yummy
