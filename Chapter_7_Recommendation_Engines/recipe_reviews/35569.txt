An excellent Korma but not what I would call a curry.

Our family loves this recipe - even the non-fish lovers.  We use Talapia however since it's what we generally have on hand and it's less expensive.  We also use coconut milk/cream since we have one allergic to milk.  It carries over perfectly.  If we need to extend the milk a bit, we use some chicken broth without losing flavor, but it does thin it out a bit.

5 star inspiration. 

I varied so far from the original recipe I wonâ€™t say much. But it was a launching point to something yummy.

This turned out great. Used fresh garlic, extra tbsp of curry and shrimp and coconut milk instead of cream. Winner for sure.

I added some white rice, yellow pepper and fresh corn off cob. Plus added  tad more oil and a little bit of sugar. I substituted crushed red pepper for the red Chile pepper.  I also added water to make it more of a soup than stew. Turned out beautiful!

Delightful! I used dry peppers, as I didn't have fresh or canned chilies or pimentos. I also added a carrot and a few stalks of asparagus.

Really loved this recipe and how easy it was to make.  I made a few changes, I almost tripled it so I could get left overs.  I put in 2.5  pounds of swahi (white fish filets) a pound of shrimp and used coconut milk instead of cream.
