Excellent Quesidillas! Just wanted to gives a heads up on two issues. First, most fajita mixes contain MSG (some people are adverse to this, understandably) Here is a good mix recipe: 3 Tbsp. cornstarch
2 Tbsp. chili powder
1 Tbsp. salt
1 Tbsp. paprika
1 Tbsp. sugar
2-1/2 tsp. crushed chicken bouillon cube
1-1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp. cumin
Preparation:
Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Pour into an airtight container.Makes the equivalent of 3 packets of commercial or purchased Fajita Seasoning Mix. 
Also, to crisp a tortilla; spread tortilla with butter before baking or wet with a bit of water. Awesome recipe!

Pretty good, but I made these again and changed things a bit and liked it better.  I omitted the bacon, instead of green peppers I used green chili peppers, used green onions and made my own fajita type seasoning that was not as spicy. Used two tortillas instead of folding one, brushed lightly with butter then grilled on the griddle about 3-4 minutes per side.  Turned out perfectly browned and crispy, not dry at all.  Served with a mixture of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole.  Thanks for the initial idea.

Here's the answer for crusty tortillas - wet them before baking.

My family loves these. I also had the soggy bottom problem, so I brush a little olive oil on the tortillas before I pop them in the oven. That makes them nice and crispy!

O MY this was great! I love quesadillas and it turned out just as described! One thing I did was use a little less fajita seasoning as too much overwhelms the mild taste of the cheese and green peppers, then I used 2tbl. of italian dressing while cooking the chicken to give them a little moisture because we like our quesas saucy. Delicious!

Super good, but need to add a note for those using low-carb tortillas. These work so much better on a grill pan than baked in the oven. I've tried baking them in the oven with and without brushing with oil and/or butter, but the tortillas always come out very hard. Suggestion: Spray a frying pan with veg. oil spray and grill them at med. heat for about 4 min. on both sides -- they turn out tender and crispy. Also recommend sprinkling some cheese on the tortilla before adding the meat mixure, and then the rest of the cheese on top. This helps hold everything together.

These were wonderful!!  Though we did make some changes.  We added about 1/2 lb of mushrooms (quartered) to the veggie mix and we only used 2 chicken breasts (there are only 2 of us) and we turned them into wraps and my husband added sour cream to his.  Even with only 2 chicken breasts we had 6 wraps in the end (plently for the 2 of us for dinner and for lunch the next day!)  very nice of the wallet.
Thanks for posting it!

Oh sooo yummy!!  I love quesadillas and this was just a wonderful and simple recipe for them.  I didn't use the full packet of the seasoning mix because I don't think I used as much chicken as the recipe calls for. I used 8 tenderloins and half of the packet seemed to do the trick. I cooked these on my George Foreman and served them with homemade pico de gallo and guacamole.  Will definitely be a repeat.  Thanks Heather.

To make your Quesadillas either spicier or milder there are a couple of things that we do. First I never broil my chicken. I cook my chicken in a skillet, cutting it into bite size pieces about half way through. It gets the nice browned flavor. I season it well w/pepper, garlic powder etc. beforehand.  I get my peppers and onions going, then put them all in one skillet, adding a tiny bit of water and taco seasoning. Depending on how much seasoning you want will depend on how much water you should add. For more heat, I add Crushed red pepper flakes. My husband likes his food "hot", so his quesadillas also get the jalapenos and diced green chiles.  Once you let your chicken mixture sit for a few minutes you'll get a thickened little sauce. Even that you can control, again by how much water you add.   In a large skillet, I add a little bit of oil, add one tortilla, put chicken filling on one side adding shredded cheese, fold over. I flip when it gets a little golden brown. Is always crispy because that's how we like it.   I'm only cooking for 3-4) people so it might take me 10 minutes (at the most) at the stove with the skillet/tortilla part. I'll cut up one for everyone while I'm cooking the others, sometimes the next with another variation. If you had a lot of people to feed, using the oven method might work a lot better. I just had never tried it.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I didn't need as much green and red peppers as called for and I chopped and sliced all my veggies very thin. Thin I just prepared them as the fajita packing instructed. Also I would recommend brushing them litely with butter or water so they aren't so crispy. All in all though a wonderful recipe with lots of flavor.

I though these were tasty.  I would also recommend a little more chicken and green onions.  Good and easy! Thanks!

I make something similar to this recipe, but shred a supermarket rotisserie chicken to save time. To make the sauce, I use medium taco sauce and chili powder blended with the chicken and cooked veggies. I spray a baking sheet, add a tortilla, then fill with chicken/veggie mixture and cheese. Top with another tortilla, then etiher spray with cooking spray or spread with melted butter and bake. I use a pizza cutter to cut into wedges for serving

Very good by the TRACYCOOK review.  I made the fajita seasoning from her review.  I made some mexican rice with it and it was good together.  I did brush some butter on the outside of the tortillas before baking, helping them to crisp up.  I didn't add the bacon piece, I don't think it needed them.

I also have a similar recipe. I use all three colored peppers, red, green and orange and purple onions sliced. Also subustitute regular taco seasoning for the fajita, we find the fajita mixes to be bitter.  Its a hit every time.

This was very good.  My kids all liked it.  I didn't use packaged fajita seasoning though.  I used my own marinade of juice of 2 limes, juice of 1 orange, 2 minced cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp chopped cilantro, 1 tsp cumin  and 1 tsp salt.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours and then grilled it.  I reserved some of the marinade and sauted the bell peppers and onions in it.  I used a red onion.  I only used shredded Cheddar and I left out the bacon bits.  I would make this again with these changes.

We love these quesadillas, but it is very important that you use the right fajita seasoning mix.  I used a generic store brand and hated it.  But the McCormick brand fajita seasoning is amazing.  Totally delish!

So good!!  This was an amazing dish and the entire family loved it.  It was so simple and easy to make...I agree with the other reviews about brushing oil on the bottom of the tortillas when putting them in the oven.  I also used the Mexican cheese blend which tasted delicious...will definitely make this again!

Okay, I cheated and bought a cooked rotisserie chicken from the supermarket.  I deboned it, added chopped green onions and the fajita seasoning to the pan and cooked on med. for 5-6 minutes.  Then I followed the directions to the recipe.  They were great!  2 people said they were the best quesadillas they ever had.  I have to agree....thanks for the recipe.  Maybe next time I won't be so lazy and actually cook the chicken myself =)

Skipped the bacon bits. Used chicken tenderloins with fajita seasoning in a frying pan with olive oil for a few mins.  Added green and red peppers and then onion.  Folded ingredients into a wheat tortilla and added chedder cheese and black olives.  Folded in half, and cooked on a George Forman.  Served with Salsa and Guacomola Sauce.  Excellant!

Super yummy!  I was so excited to make these, then my 2 teenage kids and husband ended up being gone for dinner tonight. I made them anyway for me and my 5-year old.  They were fabulous!!!  My husband ate leftovers when he got home- he loved them too.  Now we'll have great leftovers for tomorrow.  I'll definitely make again.  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but left out the bacon.  Don't need bacon- lots of flavor as is!

One thing I like to add to my quesadillas is a special sauce. I add one part sour cream to one part salsa con queso (the cheesy salsa) and stir it up well. I spread a thin layer over one side of the tortilla before adding the chicken mixture. It really helps the quesadillas from tasting too dry. Great recipe though!

This was great and made for a lot of leftovers. We heated on the stove top instead of the oven to keep the bottom tortilla crisp. We had a lot of wonderful leftover filling which was great in a wrap. We'll do this again!

We add yellow pepper as well.  Our grocery actually sells a frozen vegetable mix of red, yellow, green pepper plus onion.  Sure cuts down on prep time.  Try habanero cheese for a great kick.

Great recipe but with some changes.  I put frozen chicken tenders in the crock pot overnight with fajilta seasoning, water, canned tomatoes with jalapenos, fresh onions and garlic.  Let it cook overnight, about 20 hours actually, chicken was shredded by the time I got home from work, then it was just saute the peppers, put them together and enjoy.  For a busy mom who doesn't get home from work until 8:30 most nights, we were able to eat "earlier" than usual.  Leftovers were great for lunch the next day as well.  Thanks.

A couple things make this recipe even easier...grease the cookie sheet and place your tortilla on the cookie sheet before filling it. Saves the mess of having to transfer it AND lightly greases the side of the tortilla that you'll be folding over the meat/veggies.  Keeps the tortilla from getting too hard when heating in the oven. Use shredded Mexican cheese so you don't have to buy multiple cheeses.  Deelish and EVERYONE in my family loved it. Goes into the rotation.

I made these the other night for my boyfriend and we both really liked them. They didn't beat some of my favorite mexican restaurant quesadillas but they were still good! I ended up marinating the chicken and grilling it which had great flavor. I added jalepenos because I like spicy food. I also used the tip of brushing the tortillas with olive oil which made the tortilla crunchy. I was so happy to learn that trick!

I liked this quick and easy meal with a side dish of Mexican rice.  The only ingredient change I made was instead of Fajita seasoning I went with Taco, as per other reviews. I chose to assemble mine differently (pie-shaped) - brushed one side of tortilla with EVOO and put in 10" skillet, sprinkled with a bit of cheese, topped with chicken veggie mixture, and then sprinkled with more cheese (cheese to act as glue to hold two tortillas together), an then topped with another tortilla brushed with EVOO.  When bottom was golden, I flipped tortilla over to cook until golden. Cut into wedges and served with sour cream sprinkled with sliced green onions.  I will make again.

I made this for a quick lunch and used canned chicken breast that I wanted to use up. I also used a taco seasoning mix from this site. Quick and yummy! Thanks for sharing!

The seasoning was too strong and the tortillas didn't crisp--even though I brushed them with oil like some people suggested. I'm going back to my old recipe-it has an extra step of crisping the tortillas in the pan before baking but it turns out better.

Excellent. My whole family raved about this dish. Brushed the tortillas with just a little olive oil and they were perfect: crispy and light. The mixture was fantastic!  We will eat this again!

Loved this! Smelled great while cooking, too. Maybe a little too much cheese (can't believe I said that - is there such a thing?) and to me, the bacon bits didn't really make-it-or-break-it. Really good recipe that I will use over and over!

Very good, quick and easy. Took the advice from others and cut the chicken first. Next time, I'm going to include jalapeno's for some kick.

I don't use fajita seasoning.  I use worcesteshire sauce n a little Liquid Smoke to marinate the chicken breasts.  Marinate the chicken for about an hour or two,  then grill it, dice it up, put in on a very large flour tortilla with shredded cheese, whatever kind you like, (you can also add sauted onions, bell peppers, fresh chopped garlic and mushrooms without any liquid so the tortillas don't get soggy.  Fold it in half, spread top w/butter and pan fry it like a grilled cheese sandwich, then slice it into four pieces...serve w/salsa, sour cream, guacamole...YUMMY

These were easy to make and very tasty! However, I had to add additional spices to the chicken since the fajita seasoning was bland. In the future I will omit the fajita seasoning and use cumin, garlic, pepper, little chili powder and salt instead. I also didn't add as many peppers as the recipe called for.

These were a hit at my Super Bowl Sunday Buffet! I, like many other cooks, layered them like a true quesadilla, then cut into fourths for the serving platter. I added more green onions, used less green and red pepper than called for. And didn't use quite as much fajita seasoning. (too overpowering). Oh and one reviewers idea of wetting them before baking to prevent crispy edges...GREAT IDEA! Everyone loved them! Thanks Heather.

I gave it 4 stars, but done as instructed, it ended up being 3 1/2 stars: First off, broiling the chicken, then cooking chicken breasts for an additional 10 min with the veggies made the chicken dry, the seasoning was not hot enough for me, and the chicken could have used some initial salt and pepper. Next time I will add some serrano chilies to the veggies for some added heat, season the chicken, add more chicken thighs than breasts and add some cayenne pepper to the mix for that heat. Having said that, it's a great idea for parties or potlucks, and kid friendly.

Very good and very easy.  I made the fajita seasoning recipe another reviewer mentioned because I had none and it was great too.  I cut some calories by not cooking the chicken in oil, but instead used some chicken breast that I had boiled previously and then just cooked the peppers, onions, fajita mix in a pan with a little water, then added the chicken and mixed well.  It was terrific.  I'm really glad I tried this recipe because it's a keeper!  The bacon really added to the recipe, so don't let that out.

These were really good. I did tweak it to my tastes by leaving out the bacon and the red bell peppers. To cut down on prep time, I used frozen, pre- chopped onions and bell peppers which worked great. To brown and crisp the tortillas, I put a small amount of vegetable oil in a non- stick pan and they came out perfectly!!! These are great with chips and salsa too. I love this site! No more eating the same meals week after week.

These were very yummy. I think using either taco seasoning or one hot pepper would add to the flavor. I'm not a spicy fan, but these were a tad too dull. My other complaint is that you have to use so many dishes. Otherwise, the idea is great.

This recipe seems like it would work for any fajita, burrito etc.  I used whole wheat Pita Bread to stuff the ingredients into.  My quesadilla maker doesn't tolerate large volumes if you were to use one of them. As usual I adjusted the ingredients...Less peppers, more onion and added mushrooms because I like 'em and garlic because I add it to most meals. I used less than a full envelope of seasonings due to using less chicken. It did have good flavor and the pocket bread made it easier to heat, flipping easily,  I also used less cheese.  A tasty and flexible recipe for sure. Update: I got rid of the quesadilla maker. Now I put all the insides on one burrito and top it with another. Flipping it goes pretty well or just kinda push the stuff that fell out during flipping back in w/ the spatula. put some cheese down first, rest of the ingredients, and more cheese on top...helps it stay together. Cut it in quarters if it's big enough or half if using smaller tortilla's. Freezes well, taking up little freezer space and makes for great snacks on the go. I call them "Caseydilla's" :-).

Fantastic! These were a nice change from the ordinary dinner rotation. I served them with a cool, guacamole salad and all I can say is, "Mmmmm Mmmmm Good!!!"
I par-boiled the chicken first, then cut it in chunks. Also, I only used 1 green and 1 red pepper... One of each was plenty! Brush the tortillas with a bit of olive oil before baking to make them come out crisp. Thanks for submitting this one... we loved it!

These came out great. I deviated slightly from the recipe: Instead of grilling the chicken, I sauteed it with the fajita seasoning. I mixed the seasoning with 4 oz of Corona beer before combining it with the chicken. I also only used one green and one red pepper. (With a little over a pound of chicken breast, this made about six quesadillas.) I coated the tortillas on one side with oil, put in the filling, folded the tortilla in half, and fried it until the cheese was melted and the tortilla was golden brown on one side. Once the cheese melted I flipped it over and browned the other side. Then I sprinkled some more cheese on top and put them in the oven to keep them warm (could only cook two at a time in the frying pan) & so the cheese on top would melt. Came out great & the whole thing was very easy to put together.

Really awesome recipe- it was so yummy.  I didn't have peppers and bacon bits so I left those out. And I cooked the chicken in the skillet instead of broiling it. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions of making them sandwich-style instead of folding, wetting the tortillas when assembling to prevent crisping, and using parchment paper.  They came out fabulous.  Thanks.

Very good and very tasty!  We'll definitely make these again.  Next time I will spread olive oil on the tortillas when baking them to keep the them from getting crunchy/dried out.  I also topped them with salsa and sour cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

My 10-year-old son is usually pretty hard to impress with meals, but he actually came over and hugged me when he tasted these quesadillas!  I had an over-abundance of fresh tomatoes, so I added some and they were great.  Be sure to use some kind of topping or dip like salsa or sour cream or else they taste kind of dry.

I have made this recipe several times and everybody in my family likes it. I am wondering though, am I the only person that thinks that 4 peppers to 1 lb. of chicken is too much? When I make this, I only use two peppers. Also, I dice the chicken while it is still partially frozen so that I have nice even cuts. Just personal preference. All and all this is a keeper!

This is a good, easy recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the bacon bits. I brushed the tortillas with olive oil instead of water. I only used 1/4 pkg of fajita seasoning. I plan to make the homemade version of the seasoning in Tracy Cook's review for next time. I used two tortillas instead of folding one over, then used a pizza cutter to cut them into wedges for the kids. This recipe made a huge amount. One made with ten inch tortillas would easily feed two people. Very filling! And the leftovers are great, too.

This recipe is so good! I put a little bit of canola oil in a skillet and brown the tortillas instead of putting them in the oven, it makes them crispy. My husband LOVES these! I didn't use exact measurements earthed, just eyed it.

Huge hit! Took these to a margarita party and bought home an empty plate! Substituted green onions and canned diced chiles for the onion and green pepper, omitted the bacon and used two stacked tortillas instead of one. Couldn't find fajita mix so used chili powder, red pepper, paprika and cumin. Served with salsa. Very tasty; definitely a keeper! FYI, found that a pizza cutter was the best way to cut these.

Great recipe!  Made a couple of minor edits by using yellow and orange sweet peppers instead of green peppers (kept the red).  Did not go with bacon bits and used low sodium taco seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning.  Buttered one side of the soft taco shell.... turned out great!

Hubby said these were the best he's had... even compared to a restaurant!  We have found that we like our chicken shredded rather than cubed.  I use the crock pot to bake my chicken and I use about a half cup chicken broth with it.  It shreds so easy and comes out so moist!

Very good and filling. This would be great to make for casual company. I also cooked Best Spanish Rice from this site and it was a good pair.

This is one of my favourites. I like to make this with spinach tortillas for a little extra flavour and I usually leave out the bacon bits because unless I have real bacon, it only distracts from the flavour. These will turn out well even if you only have cheddar cheese. They are better than any restaurant quesadilla I've ever had!

This dish was really easy to make and very good.  My husband loved it! Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time would add more bacon bits and cook with sour cream in the quesadillas.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is delicious...I used a packaged fajita seasoning mix and tossed the chicken in it..then stir fried it in my skillet..I roasted the bell peppers removed the skins and julienned them...I stir fried the onions after the chicken was cooked...I used a Tex Mex shredded cheese mix and the Jalepeno Monteray Jack shredded cheese...My husband kept saying how delicious it was and wished he could eat more that was after 2 large Quesadilla's...

As written, I have to give it a 4, but I followed a few recommendations from other reviewers and these turned out great!  I cooked the chicken in a skillet instead of under a broiler, used my own blend of seasoning and added mushrooms.  I also brushed water over them right before baking so the tortillas were crispy.  Yum!

I'm giving this a five because I think the recipe is good as written; my changes were only due to personal preference.  I omitted the onion and bacon, used a Mexican cheese blend, and used half a pack of taco seasoning.  I followed the directions for the chicken/pepper mixture, but I used two tortillas instead of folding one and heated them on my griddle at 350. It only took a minute or two before they were ready to flip.  They were an excellent main dish for our Cinco de Mayo dinner.  I served them with salsa and a cheesy rotel dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good.  I used frozen red and green peppers and onions and it worked out great.  Just be sure to defrost them and pat them dry first.  I bought fully cooked Southwestern style chicken strips and used those instead of cooking the chicken separately.  Also added a little bit of chili powder for some extra spice.  Everyone loved them!

This is a great recipe! I changed a few things.  I added olives and used some hot pepper sauce because we like heat.  One suggestion - try baking these on parchment paper.  One reviewer said to spray Pam on foil, but I used parchment paper and had no problem at all.

Absolutley amazing!! These were super and very easy to make.  I used about 5 slices of bacon- but thats preference!  I've been making the Fresh Salsa (by Kaylene) from allrecipes.com-- I served that and sour cream with the quesadillas and dinner was a huge hit.  I had two leftover and they were just as good the next day!!! VERY YUMMY!

Very tasty recipe. I used almost 2 lbs. of chicken instead of one, and it didn't seem like too much with all the peppers and onions. Instead of folding the tortillas, I put one on bottom and one on top and then cut them in quarters, like quesadillas. Hubby loved them!

I wished the shells were a little browner and crisper. I thought it was excellent.  I am freezing the insides for a later time to make more quesadillas.

My family loved this recipe and I didn't change a thing. When I told my husband I was making chicken quesadillas for dinner he was a little skeptical. After...he said that's what he wants for his birthday dinner. I'm not going to lie, I kinda felt like the bomb.com after serving this :)

I would give this recipe 5 stars, but I changed it a little to prevent them from being too dry and to improve the health factor. I make my own taco seasoning to avoid the MSG in the packaged mixes. I added salsa that I had on hand, and used shredded Mexican cheese instead of the Monterey Jack. I cooked them on a grill that has plates for quesadillas and divides them into sections. I think the recipe needs something for moisture. This can be added with your favorite salsa, canned diced tomatoes, or diced tomatoes with chiles. Without some kind of tomato thing, they would be too dry.

Very yummy, I brushed oil on the outside of the tortilla as suggested earlier to make crispy, shredded the chicken, overstuffed the tortillas-so it made 6 of them.  served with sour cream and salsa MMMM.

This was easy and delicious! I changed the directions a bit. I boiled 3 chicken breasts in water-i sprinkled some chicken boullion in. once cooled, i shredded the meat, added the fajita seasoning, and veggies and cooked until veggies were soft. I left the bacon bits out. Instead of folding the toritllas in half, I topped 4 tortillas with the mixture then placed another tortilla on top. I took the advice of others to wet the tortillas for to get a cripsy crunch. It worked for the top, but the bottom was still soggy. I think a george foreman or quesadilla maker would work much better! Served with sour cream and I made a black bean and corn salad as a sidedish

Quick and easy! Our store was out of green peppers (imagine that - during the summer)! Anyway, I forgot to pick them up at another store and used only the reds. Came out yummy anyway! Not sure I would change anything. Simple and tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out pretty good, although I think next time I would use more of the fajita seasoning as we prefer a little bolder flavor.  Otherwise the proportions seemed fitting.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Heather!

AWESOME! Cut chicken in strips and cooked on stove top. veggies sauteed separately. used the  suggested recipe for fajita seasoning. phil and kim said a little to spicy but i liked it. will also try mushrooms. good just as a veggie quesadilla. recipe did not make as many as said could be because we did chicken in strips instead of diced.

I made this for a big group of people and they loved it. Best quesadillas i've made yet. The only thing I did differently was I brushed some olive oil on the tortillas so they would be crispy. But other than that this was  a very easy and awesome recipe.

Great recipe and easy to make too. The fajita seasoning makes a lot of difference. I make these about once or twice a week now.

My recommendation is to at least 1/4 the chicken bullion if not leave it out totally.  I give it 4 starts because I think the base is very well done.

Love Chicken Quesadillas. Avoid the soggy by grilling them on your bbq  just enough on each side to melt the cheese. Add some cilantro, chilis or jalapenos to the filling. Cut into wedges and dip with guacomole, sour cream and or homemade salsa. Ole!! MamaJo

Good recipe!  I omitted the bacon, and sautéed some garlic with the rest of the rest of the vegetables.  Next time, I may substitute chili peppers or jalapenos for one of the bell peppers.  I used the chicken and vegetable quantities as stated, but I only had enough mixture to fill seven (rather than ten) tortillas.  Tasty!!

My family really enjoyed these. I did wet the bottom of each tortilla with water. The tortillas crisped nicely.  I served with salsa and avocado. Next time I might add some mexicali corn or black beans. This is a keeper!

This is an awesome recipe!! Thank you... I have made them twice and both times they were delish! I did not use bacon. I also brushed a little water on the tortilla before baking to make it crisp. These are so good, I had to write my first review!

These were great.  My kids LOVED them.  I used cooked grilled chicken (cubed - from Aldi's) and added after cooking peppers/onions in olive oil with the fajita mix.  I also cut the wrap in half like other reviewers and did a couple on the stove top with a touch of olive oil in the pan.  Liked these better on stopvetop than in the oven but still good either way.  A keeper for sure!

My daughter loves these, I omit the bacon and cook them on a dry griddle until the tortilla starts to brown slightly. Top with sour cream and extra salsa. A family favorite.

Yummy yummy! This meal is family approved. I left out the bacon & pan fried the chicken in olive oil instead of broiling. And guys, wetting the tortilla really works!! No soggy-ness!!

I made these last night for a party with my girlfriends and everyone loved them.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet, then cooked the quesedillas on the stove instead of in the oven.  Everyone loved them and asked me to make again next time.

Very good.  Only change was to bake them under the broiler which only took a few minites on each side and gave the outside a crisy lightly brown texture.

these needed a little something.they was to dry.me and my family love taco bells quesadillas.so what i added to this one is omit the onions and add a can of tomatoes and green chillies and refried beans.BUT the main ingredient is cheese wizz.cover the flour tortilla with cheese wizz and put it on top of the other one after you toped it with the other goodies or fold it if you like and spray your pan befor you put them in the oven with pam.and i also freeze the left overs.

Another 5 star rating!   We used this recipe as the base for a "build your own" dinner.  Each family member customized his/her own before the cooking step.  We had sliced black olives, salsa verde, chopped chile peppers, and hot sauce as "add-ons."   Served with salsa, sour cream and refried beans.

This was the first time I had ever made quesadillas, and they turned out great.  I omitted the bacon bits, and instead, I spread a layer of refried beans before the cheddar cheese.  The melted cheddar and the beans made a great combination!  I will definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe and I added a little extra's. I used real bacon since I did not have bacon bits.  I also used cheddar, colby and monterey jack cheeses blended.  I also used Tumaro's flavored tortilla's, Jalepeno and Cilantro flavored (green), and Sun-dried tomatoes with Basil (red) and put a little butter on top.  I also added some jalepeno's to hubby's and mine for a lil kick.  I served it with sour cream, salsa and guacomole on the side.  I had Spanish Rice and refried beans to compliment this dish.  This is a keeper.  I read someone elses review about their son commenting that they should have it everynight, and coincidentally mine said the same.

Great recipe.  I used leftover chicken fajitas.  The onion and pepper add a great taste.  Next time I wil cover when baking since they turned a little dry to my taste.

I enjoyed them as a change from fajitas.  I took one reviewer's suggestion and put one tortilla on the bottom, put the filling on the tortilla, & put a 2nd tortilla on top.  I cut it into quarters after cooking.  I was a litle confused on the brushing water or not brushing water suggestions, to make them crispy or not make them crispy!?!  Well, I wanted them crispier (as opposed to fajitas) so I brushed the top tortilla with water, & I think the quesadillas did become crispier.  Also I left out the bacon & used my own seasoning, instead of fajita seasoning. I also put cheddar & jack in the filling.   You really can make this to order.  My son doesn't like peppers & onions so I just left those off his quesadilla psuedosandwich.  One last tip...  I put the tortillas on a foil lined cookie sheet.  If you do this, be sure to spray the aluminum foil with Pam.  The second time I made these, I didn't use Pam & they stuck to the aluminum foil!

My boyfriend loves quesadillas when we go out to eat, so he decided to try making them at home. these are now his absolute favorite, and they are better than most found at restaurants.  we varied the recipie somewhat, use roasted pepper tortillas, scallions instead of onion, a hot pepper in addition to the others, and probably add a bit more spice, also have tried using jalapeno jack cheese which works well. they freeze or refrig and heat up great. have made them many times for company and have always turned out perfect

This one is a keeper. I had the same problem as another reviewer ... crusty edges.  Does anyone have any suggestions for that problem?  I will still make this one over and over again.  Served with sour cream and salsa, it's GREAT for Friday nights or for guests. Thanks for the great recipie!

I made this recipe for a Cinco de Mayo celebration that I hosted.  Every one loved them.  I made a couple of extras. Heated the next day. Still great.  My Sons thought they were great with sour cream and salsa. Would definitely make this recipe again.

These were SO good. I have never broiled before and didn't have time to set that up (or learn how), so I just spread the diced chicken pieces with the seasoning on an oiled cookie sheet in the oven and took them out when they were no longer pink. I served the quesadillas with sour cream and guacamole on the side. My husband said the only thing he would do differently is add some salsa next time.

These were pretty good. After i take the chicken out of the broiler, I like to shred it in a food processor to get a more even spread. Very quick and easy meal.

We thought these were great! I tried to take a short-cut and do the chicken in the frying pan with the seasoning before adding the veggies. Most of the seasoning congealed in the frying pan so lost a bit of flavour and made myself more work (take heed & learn from my mistakes!!, LOL)  They were still fantastic, but looking forward to the extra seasoning being on the chicken when I do it the way it is written :)  I did them in the small tortillas, more like a sandwich instead of folding over the bigger ones.  I sprayed a small amount of olive oil on the pan which gave them a tiny crunch and served with pico de gallo, sour cream & avocado.  Definitely will be making these again & again!

Sauteed the chicken with the onions and peppers since it was easier, used taco seasoning based on what I had and other reviews, and skipped the bacon. Delicious!

These were Awesome with the changes I made which were more on how I made them rather than changing the ingredients. First  I cubed my chicken and placed in a ziplock bag. I made my own fajita seasoning from this sight, I mixed 2 Tbs together with a 1/4 cup of evoo and two Tbs of lemon juice along  with 2 cloves of minced garlic and poured over chicken and marinated in the fridge for a few hours. I sauteed the onions and peppers first then removed from skillet and added the marinated chicken and sauteed until no longer pink, then added the pepper mixture back in and heated through. I then sprayed a large skillet with Pam over med/hi heat. I lightly brushed one side of a tortilla with evoo put a layer of cheese, then the chicken pepper mixture along with real bacon I cooked and crumbled earlier, then another layer of cheese and topped with another tortilla brushed with evoo. Cooked for about 4 minutes and flipped over and cooked another 4 minutes. Cut into wedges with a pizza cutter. Served with sour cream and salsa. Came out perfect. It made 4 large quesos this way.

I tried this recipe a few years ago and it's a big hit with my family!  I omitted the green peppers and only used red peppers (personal preference) and didn't use the bacon bits.  Instead of baking the quesadilla, I buttered the outsides of the tortillas and browned them on the griddle (you could use a skillet on the stove) until the cheese melted and the results made for a beautifully, golden brown, tasty quesadilla! Easy recipe and definitely a crowd pleaser!  I highly recommend this one!

I was looking for a good Salmon or Halibut Quesadilla recipe but there were none to be found so I decided to try this one and substitute. The Halibut was phenomenal I haven't tried it with the salmon yet but I will be soon. I grilled it on the George Foreman so they could be made to order which was good since my family just kept coming back for more.

I tweaked mine a fair bit but based it on this recipe.  I made my own tortillas, then I fried red & green peppers and onions together in a spoon of bacon grease.  I made my own fajita seasoning something like paprika, garlic powder, sugar and cumin & dumped it all in there along with some left over roasted chicken from last night.  I also gave it a healthy dose of diana sauce and mixed it all together.  Spread some sour cream on the bottom tortilla, dump a scoop of chicken mixture and some shredded cheese on top then the top tortilla.  I didn't bother reheating them all together since the tortillas were still warm from cooking.

These quesadillas were really a hit in my house. The only thing was the fajita seasoning was a little strong for my liking. I am definitely making them again, but without the fajita seasoning.

Very good. I use taco seasoning and only put about half a packet. Haven't tried it with bacon yet. Also, I like to use pepper jack instead of monterey jack for an extra kick. If you freeze and re-heat quesadillas, heat them on the stove or griddle- the microwave will make them soft & greasy.

I've been looking for healthy new recipes and with just a few lighter alternatives I think this one will become a family favorite.

I used red, green and yellow peppers, the taco seasoning as someone else suggested and a lower fat cheese. We had no leftovers and the family asked me to make sure I don't lose this recipe. It was quick and easy to prepare and tasted great.

These were VERY good! I started off making fajitas but changed my mind. Had everything but the fajita mix (made my own without salt) and bacon bits (can't have anyways.) I froze the leftovers to take to work. I served with no fat sour cream and salsa. YUM!

Turned out awesome! Used a quesadilla maker, sautéed the pepper & onion beforehand, and used rotisserie chicken that I had on hand.

Just finished these for lunch, i had to make a few changes only because i did not have most of the ing. but the ideal of fajita seasoning was perfect. I added corn to the quesadillas were great. My toddler loved them and ate a whole one. I did not cook them in the oven i used a pan on the stove top. My mother in law taught me to lightly spray the tortilla with pam and it will crisp uo nicely.
thanks for the supper fast and yummie recpie. I will make again.

I really appreciate this recipe.  Although I used leftover rotisserie chicken and seasoned it with what I had that was similar to fajita seasoning (chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper), and didn't use the bacon or Monterey Jack cheese, I would still rate it a 5.  The peppers and onions were awesome with the rest of the ingredients. I served it with Jasmine brown rice, refried bean, salsa, and avocado.

These quesadillas were so good! The vegetables definitely give it a really good flavor instead of just using cheese and chicken! It was really easy, and if I can do it, anyone can do it!

I used left-overs from a roasted chicken.  First I diced some onion and bell pepper and sauteed it.  I added the chicken that I had cut into small dice and seasoned it all with taco seasoning and additional cumin, ancho chili powder, and some hot taco sauce.
I put a tortilla on a griddle, covered the bottom with a mexican cheese blend, added the chicken. veggie mixture, then put another layer of cheese on top.  Cover with another tortilla.  (Repeat with as many quesadillas as you want) Fry until cheese starts to melt and the tortilla is lightly browned; flip it over and fry on the other side to make sure it is heated through and all the cheese is melted.  Cut into quarters and serve.  I served these with a Mexican rice and re-fried beans with sour cream on the side.  YUM.  We loved it...it was easy and a great way to use up that leftover chicken.

Everyone loved this recipe and it could not have been easier!  I dampened the outside of the shells with my hand as suggested and they were lovely and crispy.  Definately a keeper.

this is close to how i make my quesadillas. instead of fajitas seasoning i use Weber's Kick'n Chicken seasoning (the kick'n will depend on how much seasoning you use---great stuff!!) and a few dashes of crushed red pepper.

This was a great meal! I grilled the chicken first and then cut it up, left out the bacon and then used my griddle to cook the quesadillas. For the fajita mix I mixed it with about a 1/4 cup of water and then mixed it in the the veggies and chicken. The water trick really works for getting them not to be soggy. I think I'm going to find a chipotle sauce of some kind to spread on the toritilla to give it a little more kick.

So so good! I doubled the recipe since it freezes well. I used TRACYCOOK's recipe for the homemade fajita seasoning (found it here in the reviews). I did omit most of the table salt since it calls for bouillon cubes and it was absolutely delicious! The seasoning recipe makes enough for 3 lbs. of meat so use accordingly. I also lightly ran a stick of butter around the outside of the tortilla before putting it on the baking sheet, it got nicely crisp without being greasy. Before serving I cut into 3 wedges with a pizza cutter and dolloped a little sour cream on each wedge, then garnished with green onion.. yumm. Thank you so much for this recipe and for all the helpful suggestions!

These tasted great! I had no intentions of buying fajita seasoning, so I made a marinade out of a few of my favorite spices and cilantro, and grilled the chicken instead of broiling it. Everything else I remained faithful to the recipe and it was perfect. I served this with a can of mexicorn. Even cutting the recipe in half this made more then enough for 2 adults and a toddler, but there's no complaints about having quesadillas leftovers  for lunch this week.

Easy to mak and w/o a doubt the best  quesadillas I ever had.  Use corn torillas and bake the quasdillas on the same pan you used to broil the chicken and it really adds to the taste of the quasadillas.

This was very good and easy!  Like others I skipped the bacon and heated the chicken (I used some leftover roasted chicken) in the pan with the veggies vs. in the oven.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Made them with two tortilla soft shells and fried them on the skillet with butter on the outsides. I didn't use red pepper and had enough with one green pepper and an onion. Good dish!

This was a lot better than I expected. I had no pre-made fajita mix, so I found a fajita marinade recipe and used that. Next time, I might try to find a dry fajita mix recipe. Even so, they were quite tasty!

Wonderful recipe. I use wheat tortillas, and add some garlic powder as well. I have also used american cheese to cut down on the fat. The original recipe is great just the way it is, though. Thanks!

I'm no cook, but this was EZ. I eliminated the bacon, too much extra work. I wondered how chicken breasts could cook in a broiler for 5 min and be done...well...I forgot to pre-chop the chicken and I over broiled it a bit. It was fine. I brushed the tortillas w/ oil so they wouldn't be soggy. They turned out GREAT!

We did not like the flavor of these. They were not like the restaurant kind. My kids did not like them either. They were very easy to prepare though. I guest they are just not our families taste.

Delicious! I changed a few things though-- omitted bacon and onion (which I should have kept the onion), sliced the veggies instead of chopping, and used fiesta blend cheese. I added jalapenos to some of them as well.  I also diced the chicken after broiling and cooked the quesadillas on the stove instead of the oven. They came out crispy and golden.  There's still something missing from it though, I don't know if the onion would have made a big difference but it's just not spicy enough or the flavors just aren't as strong as I like. Will still be tweaking this one but it's still yummy!

I made these along with the veggie fajitas. They were quite tasty. I would say you don't have to have the bacon bits. I used the "real" bacon bits though and overall they were great!

My husband and I both really liked this recipe!  We did change it bit though- we didn't have any bell peppers and we used 6 slices of real bacon.  We cooked the bacon and the chicken together in a pan then added the fajita seasoning and grilled them in a quesadilla maker.  I didn't really taste the bacon that much so next time we probably won't add it because its just extra fat.  Overall- it was good!

This recipe ,as is, is just ok. Most reviews who gave it 4 or 5 stars, had altered it in some say. This needed something. I sauted the chicken with peppers, onions, mushrooms, seasonings and then added a good salsa to the mixture and let simmer for a bit to thicken it up. Pesto sauce would work as well. I used a little olive oil on the outside of the tortillas. Place cheeses on the one half, added chicken mix, then more cheese (added Feta too) Folded in half and put into oven. Letting the quesadillas sit for a bit after taking them out , helps to 'set' the cheeses and holds them together much better for cutting.

The only reason I didnt give this a five was because they fell apart so easy we had to eat them with a fork and knife. I used the taco seasoning because I like the flavor so much better than fajita seasoning and it was the right thing to do! After reading reviews, i cooked the chicken, cut in pieces, in a skillet with a little heated oil and then just when chicken was pink added the peppers and onions until veggies were soft. This made the chicken and veggies stay moist and yummy insead of dry.I sprayed the wheat tortillas with Pam on both sides and placed an entire tortilla down, added mixture and cheese and then added another tortilla on top.I think next time I will try olive oil or water and just do one side of each tortilla and see if they hold the inside together better. I also used light colby shredded cheese, omitted bacon bits, and added light sourcream on top. Even my picky 9 year old loved them as did my 15 year old, and hubby. We will make it a regular recipe and I like forward to changing things up like adding hot peppers to a few of them or mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  My family loved it!  I changed a couple of things - I diced the raw chicken and cooked it in a skillet on the stove with a Tbsp. of olive oil, then added the fajita seasoning, then the veggies.  I also wet the tortillas and they ended up crispy!  Instead of folding them in half I put on whole tortilla on the bottom and another on top.  The leftovers heated up well in the microwave, but they were no longer crispy, but still just as yummy!!

Loved the tip about moistening the tortillas, they crisped nicely - should have put some Pam on the sheet though, they stuck like a bear!  Taste was delicious - thought about skipping the bacon bits but went for it and it added a really nice smokey flavor.  Glad I did!

This was awesome. I used 3 chicken breasts, one green pepper and half of an onion. I omitted the bacon b/c didn't have. It made 7 quesadillas, but probably could have made 8. I didn't make the chicken in the broiler. I diced the chicken and cooked in a skillet. Will be adding to the regular menu. Thank you for the great recipe!!

I skipped the step of putting the chicken pieces on a baking sheet & broiling...not sure why that would be necessary. I stir fried the chicken in the hot oil just until not pink, added the vegetables and continued to cook until the vegetables were softened, then proceeded with rest of recipe.  I also made my own fajita seasoning, which I found online, not this site.  Definitely use SMOKED  paprika, it is worth tracking down (found mine at Marshall's!)lends a nice, subtle smokey flavor. Overall a DELICIOUS RECIPE.

I don't normally like Quesadillas. I was not even going to try them. But as I was preparing them they looked and smelled good. While cooking it got to me. The kids loved them, the hubby loved them & I loved them. Made them 2 nights in a row they were that good

Awesome!!  I marinaded the chicken in Grill Mates Chipolte Pepper all afternoon, then grilled them on the foreman.  Then cubed the chicken and mixed it in with green and red peppers, diced green chilies and one can of rotell with green chilies.  Used a mexican blend of cheese.  Turned out awesome and now I have lunch for the week as well!!  They reheat wonderfully!!

The BEST Quesadillas I have ever had! I cut this down for our family of four. Used 2 chicken breasts, about 1/3 cup each of red and green bell pepper and onion. Used the fajita seasoning mix that is suggested instead of buying my own and just coated the chicken with that and threw everything in the fry pan at once. I didn't see a reason to make 2 messes by broiling the chicken! I spread both sides of tortilla with butter and cooked them in the pan. We will definitely be making these again as my almost 1 and 3 year old loved it!

I loved this simple supper recipe. I took the advise of various cooks about heating the tortilla's! They turned out just like a restaurants. I also used the advise to make my own seasoning mix. It was fabulous. I will never buy another package of seasoning again!

These are really good as written.  However, we like to play with the ingredients, as this is a very versatile recipe.  The combinations are virtually endless!  The rating is based on the original recipe.  However, our favorite variation...season the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, & pepper instead of fajita seasoning.  Then, instead of the onion and peppers, we add bacon and green onions and LOTS of cheese!  Thanks for the base recipe!

This is amazing... I made it just as stated and it was just like eating it from a Mexican restaurant!!
One note however, for the cheese, I bought KRAFT's Mexican Four cheeses, which has quesadilla, cheddar & Monterey Jack cheeses mixed for u :) so u dont need to buy separate cheeses! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

We loved these!  I used taco seasoning instead of fajita, and just cooked the chicken and vegetables in the oil instead of broiling the chicken.  Very easy and yummy!

I used chicken I had baked previously and Sargento Mexican cheese, along with sauteed onions.  I brushed the tops of the tortillas with butter and baked them - they were fabulous!  Husband still prefers grilled, but for a quick and easy meal, these were great.

Wow, I wont be ordering these out again...they taste so much better made at home, and really aren't a lot of trouble to make!  I also add in some fresh sliced mushrooms, and always use real bacon (not the bits)...throw a couple of slices in the microwave, and wallah!!!  I serve it with fresh homemade salsa and guacamole!

Really good!  I used shredded pre-cooked chicken that was already seasoned.  I used 1 red pepper & 1 green pepper also.  Good flavor.

These were really, really good.  We used only one pepper each instead of two and real crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits.  We topped them with sour cream and mild taco sauce.  Excellent!  Thanks!

Wonderful!! My family devoured these quickly. We used whle grain tortillas and I accidentally forgot to add the bacon bits, and they were great! I will definitely make these again, so much better than bland, greasy, plain-cheese quesadillas.

I thought this was merely okay. I made these for a party, and they were probably my guests' least favorite appetizer. A previous reviewer who claimed the oven dried them out too much was right. It probably would have been better to stir fry the chicken with the vegetables, rather than broiling it.

My husband can't get enough of these.  I used a bit more chicken and only a red pepper but added a tiny bit of green onions for color.  I had a little trouble getting the tortilla to stick together so I might brush them with a bit of oil next time.  Will make again.

Lots of prep, but once that's done, the assembly is quick and easy. I made this as-is for the kids, and a spicier version (with jalapenos and spicy cheese) for the grown-ups. The only substitutes I made were to use low-sodium fajita seasoning and a de-boned and shredded (by me) store-bought rotisserie chicken for the meat.  Great  recipe. Will make again.

I made recipe using rottesierie chicken and precut peppers from the produce department.  Sautéed with the onions in olive oil, adding cilantro and lime juice. I chose Lawry's fajita seasoning which has NO MSG. I cooked it on the stove top for an hour and the veggies were soft and caramelized. I assembled  the quesadilla after spraying the tortilla with cooking spray. Baked on a baking pan lined with foil and cooking spray. It  came out perfectly with this preparation.  Topped it with salsa, sour cream and avocado. Was delicious!

We add rice, black beans and sometimes corn. I also use my own seasonings rather than prepackaged mix. Garlic, cayenne, paprika, cumin, black pepper, dash of salt.

This recipe was very good.  My family really enjoyed it.  It was a blessing to have left overs to have for lunch the next day.  I used my own spices instead of the fajita seasoning.  I used garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, chili powder and salt.  This was a hit in my house!

Thought it was unbelievable good.  My whole family loved it.  I made a small change:  I used the allrecipes.com recipe for the fajita mix instead of the packet.  I also omitted the bacon and used 2 whole tortillas instead of 1 folded in half.  Made 6 quesadillas.

Made this for my boyfriend last night. He said out of all the things I have made for him, this is by far his #1! I didn't think it would be THAT good. I was very wrong, it was amazing. Broiling chicken was GENIUS. I always have had trouble keeping chicken moist. This was the trick! I used 1.5lbs of chicken breast, 1 green bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, 1 onion. It was the perfect amount of veggies to go with that amount of meat. It made a total of 5 quesadillas (big ones) plus enough left over to make breakfast burritos with egg the next morning for him and myself. DEFINITELY saved to my favorites and will make again!

I cut the chicken into small bites and made it according to the package directions of the fajita mix, then assembled as directed (with mushrooms added), and YUM!!  Everyone ate until they were stuffed.  If you don't have bacon, that's ok too.  The quality of the fajita mix is key though.  Very easy, filling, and budget friendly.  Thank you Heather!

These were very good. However, I gave it only a 4 star because baking them didn't crisp the quesadilla enough for my liking. I was able to fit three of these on my baking sheet. I have a quesadilla press so I used that for the remaining items and to spruce up the three that I put in the oven and the results were very good. I topped them with homemade guacamole, homemade pico de gallo and sour cream.

These came out pretty good, but I did make a few changes. I left out the oil, both peppers, onion, and bacon bits. Also, we grilled the chicken, mixed in the fajita seasoning, then put that on the tortillas. Then we put the cheese on, then grilled all that together until the cheese melted and the quesadillas browned. However, I think this called for WAY too much cheese, and we are a SERIOUS cheese-loving family. Other than that, I liked them. My husband LOVED them.

We all loved this! I used leftover bacon and shredded chicken from a whole chicken and I made the fajita seasoning recipe from this site. I also sauteed the peppers and onions in a combination of coconut oil and butter.I think put a pat of butter on my griddle and cooked them that way, keeping them warm in the oven until we were ready to eat.

This was wonderful! I cooked chicken in a skillet instead of broiler and used thin cut breasts. Like other reviews, I only added half the fajita mix. Then pressed in a Quesadilla a maker and they turned out fabulous!

I only had taco seasoning, so I used that (although not a full package), and I only had one third of an onion.  I used cheddar and a mexican cheese blend, and it was delicious.  Even the kids liked it.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I mixed the fajita seasoning with lemon juice and added diced green peppers, red pepper, onions and let it set in the fridge over night. I used a wok to stir-fry the chicken and pepper mixture and it turned out great. The chicken really absorbed the flavor. I read that some people's torillas came out crusty. I sprayed vegetable oil on it and that resolved the problem.

I go a little lightly on the fajita mix as we don't like things too spicy and we prefer a crisper crust, so I don't use the oven.  Instead, I prepare everything ahead of time, then using a 12" skillet, with a bit of oil/margarine I place one tortilla in, scoop filling, cheese, and spread to 1/4 inch from the sides, place a tortilla on top and heat on a medium heat.  When the bottom is browned, I place a similar sized plate over the skillet and flip it onto the plate, then slide the uncooked side back into the pan with a little more oil, margarine...easy peasy and I don't have to turn my oven on. Slide onto a plate when cheese is melted and bottom crust is browned, cut up like a pizza and serve with salsa, sour cream, bacon bits, chopped green onions (optional) or whatever you choose really,  and a side salad.  Great easy recipe for nights when you don't have a lot of time.  Takes about 1/2 hour in total to prepare from cutting/prepping to serving.

Loved this recipe. First time I used taco only because I did not have fajita seasoning.  Second time around I used the fajita.  I preferred it with the taco seasoning, but that is just a personal preference.  Recipe is tasty in its original form and it has become a family favorite.

I am a mexican food fan and this recipe was alright but I've had better. I wouldn't make it like this again. I would try taco seasoning or something else to add flavor and this particular recipe made too big of a serving size. Now i have unwanted leftovers.

I am a beginner cook and this recipe is so easy to make. These quesadillas were very, very tasty. Great as a snack or as a main dish along with some pinto beans and roasted corn. Thank you for adding this.

I made a couple of changes. Instead of bacon bits, I used fresh bacon and then added it back in when I was cooking the chicken/onion/bell pepper mix. And before I cooked the chicken, I marinated it in lemon juice.

These were pretty good.  I preferred to use a blend of homemade seasoning.  We put a bit of water on the tortillas before baking as we heard this helped them crisp up, seemed to work fine.  I liked the meat/veggie mixture in just a tortilla but unheated, my husband seemed to really like them though.

This was great!  I started ordering this in restaurants and wanted to make it at home.  Really easy to make... one of those recipes you read and say I thought so!  Also there is a great fajita mix recipe in the reviews below... by TRACYCOOK.. I wish I could thank her too! And yes it would be easier to use the packet.. I just really have been trying to do the made by scratch and I am thankful I found this Its better than the "Old El Paso"  Thank you Tracy and Heather!

I loved this recipe but opted to use olive oil on the tortilla outside, fold it and put it in the George Foreman.  It was excellent.  I even tried the same thing with steakums.  This will be a weekly menu item for a few weeks.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I especially liked the addition of the MJ cheese.  We didn't use the bacon bits (because we didn't have any on hand) and only half the peppers.  That was a good ratio of chicken to veggies for us.  My only concern was that there are probably certain fajita packets that are better than others.  We got McCormick's and weren't very happy with that particular blend.

Awesome recipe, the only change I made was I sprayed the tortillas with buttery pam, bottom first then I filled them and then sprayed the tops.  Made it crispy and less fat then using melted butter. Thanks for the recipe.

These were incredible. Loved the fajita seasoning. We call them fajita quesadillas. Next time I will try this with steak. Mmm, mmm.

All the elements were battling for center stage, and in the end none of them win but you lose. I would suggest making your own seasoning. I used half the bell peppers but it was still too much. Even after mashing these down they were about 3/4-in. thick. The cheese sat in my stomach like a brick. Grilled chicken and less cheese by themselves would have been better. The bacon really didn't add anything.

Very good.  I made them ahead and threw them in the oven when company showed up.  I also cooked the chicken, then diced it and added the spices before putting it in with the veggies.

Good recipe, though mine came out pretty soggy on the bottom. Next time I will cook on a wire rack over a baking sheet to prevent that. Otherwise, very tasty!

These are so awesome!! I did however change a few things that made it just as delicious but easier yet. I omitted the bacon bits, my family prefers none, and I used Rotel instead of chopping the peppers and onion. It's all in the Rotel. You can also buy it mild or spicy for a little extra kick. I layered a thin slice of cheddar on the bottom, chicken, Rotel, then the monterey jack. The cheeses on both sides keep everything together nicely. These work great on the George Foreman machine too.

This was a fantastic recipe, and although using simple ingredients, it has a really great flavor.   The only two things I did differently was leaving out the bacon bits (all I had were simulated ones and they're way to salty) and before filling the tortillas and folding them, I sprayed a frying pan with pam and warmed up/toasted each side of each tortilla for about 4 - 6 seconds each.   This made it WAY easier to fold and keep everything in and when they were put into the oven to bake, they came out slightly crispy around the edges but also ever-so-slightly chewy. It was delicious!  Well done!

I make this almost the same way only I use leftover rotisserie chicken. I put refried beans on the bottom.  Black is best. The beans work like a glue & holds everything together.Then meat, sauce & cheese.  No bacon bits.  Personnel choice. I wrap them individually in foil & freeze. When I want one. I put it in my toaster oven @350 degrees about 40 or 45 minutes. This recipe is also good for emptying the fridge.  Be creative!!  Beef & pork also work well.  I make my own seasoning using a recipe from this site.  If you like your tortillas browned on top lightly spray the tops with a little Pam.

These were great the whole family loved them and I didn't change a thing, I've made twice now and the 2nd time I used pita pockets and I'd have to say the tortillas are better but the pita are easier to hold except the cheese melts out a little. Other than that the recipe is very good.

Followed the recipe exactly. Only change was to brush olive oil onto the tacos before putting them in the oven. They were great.Believe it or not, I think they're even better as left-overs.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed eating these quesadillas but I must admit that I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I didn't sprinkle the whole packet of fajita seasoning on the chicken as the directions suggested just because I don't really like the fajita seasonings at the store and I was worried that I may not like the taste so I sprinkled just a little seasoning over the chicken and a little over the veggies just give it the flavor with an extra pinch a salt and pepper.  I also don't like bacon bits so I just omitted it.  I may not have experienced this recipe as it was intended but it was still good.

Made this recipe yesterday.  I made a few changes.  There were 6 of us, so I baked 6 chicken breasts in the oven the day before, and cut up the veggies also the day before (2ea. red& grn peppers & 1 onion).  I put the whole package of seasoning in.  I found Monterey Jack cheese with hot peppers in it, and grated some of this up along with the chedder.  This made enough for 8 quesadillas (16 tortillas, I did not fold them over, but just spread the chicken mixture on top of one and covered with another torilla.  When you take them out of the oven, let them sit for 5-10 minutes, as they taste much better when they have cooled a little, and even better the next day.  I also brushed the tops with veg oil to make them a little crispier.  They were a big hit with the family. But I think the next time I make them I will use taco seasoning, I think it would give it more taste.  Great & easy recipe!

Very good.  Husband and the kids loved it.  Buttered the shells to make them crispy, but might want to turn over during cooking for crispy shell on both sides.  I used Hormel real bacon bits.  Also warms up well for leftovers.

Very good! I cooked the chicken first, on the foreman grill, then diced, and added to the pepper/onion mix, only then adding the seasoning (which,it's super easy to make your own). I didn't fold them in half, I find it much easier to just use two, and layer them. The kids like these because "they're like taco pizzas!"

This is very close to the recipe I use to make quesadillas. My family likes "heat" so I use a chipotle seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning. I also use chiles instead of green peppers. I have never tried cooking these in the oven. I usually spread a thin layer of margarine on the tortillas and then cook them on my nonstick griddle on the stove. I've never had any soggy quesadillas using this method. I serve these with sour cream, salsa, and fresh guacamole. Delicioso!

There is no way I could have stretched this  to fill 10 quesadillas.  It was very good though.  I will make this again.

Delicious recipe!  I used a rotisserie chicken already cooked but I added the shredded meat to the pan with the cooked peppers.  I also sprayed cooking spray on my baking pan and used water on my tortillas and they did not turn out soggy…they were perfectly crisp after 10 minutes or so.  Next time, I may throw the meat mixture with peppers into a crock pot so all I have to do is add it to the tortillas later.

I made this to freeze and take to work for lunch during the week. I used the fajita seasoning recipe that TRACYCOOK gave on her review (thanks tracycook!)It's much easier to broil the chicken and your house doesn't get all smokey if you were to saute it. I did brown the quesadilla on a frying pan rather than baking. I only used one green pepper, one onion, one zucchini and some corn,and used pepper jack cheese. So good!

Heather,
Thanks for the great recipe!  I had to make some changes as I only had taco seasoning, red peppers and cheddar cheese in the house.  I fried the chicken with the seasoning; added onions and red peppers.  Wet the sides of the tortillas; added the chicken mixture and grated cheddar cheese; baked in 350 for 10 minutes.  Served these with no fat sour cream and salsa.  Fantastic!

I don't much like spice, so I used a package of mesquite marinade mix and a little honey instead of fajita seasoning.  Delicious!

Great recipe--my boyfriend said it was one of the best I'd ever made!  Like others, though, I made a few modifications.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil instead of broiling (seemed like broiling skinless, boneless breast would dry it out too much) then added  salt, pepper, adobo & red pepper flakes.  Mixed with the sauteed onion & peppers then added about a half cup of salsa.  Delicious!  I left out the bacon & the jack cheese (only had cheddar)but I'm sure with those original additions this recipe would be even more amazing.  I did the "fold" method and it came out fine--I've only seen them done that way in restaurants anyway. Great with sour cream.  Don't forget to brush the outside with oil or water to prevent sogginess.

We've made this twice in the last week.  Two of three boys love it (I forgot that the step doesn't like cooked onions, so wouldn't eat it).  I used a spicy taco seasoning instead of the fajita seasoning the first time because I found I was out of fajita seasoning, the second time because the first time was so good!  In the future, if I don't have something with a bit of heat in it, I'll be sure to add a little Hatch green chile to the chicken.  I also found (as others mentioned) that pan-frying the chicken in the same skillet that I did the veggies in worked beautifully, and I didn't have an extra messy pan to clean up.  Oh, and I left out the bacon bits, but will try them another time.

Very good but fallowing other reviewers advice is a must with this recipe. To prevent soggy bottoms brush with a little olive oil before putting in the oven. Also add a little extra chicken not a lot just a little and one to two fresh jalapenos.

Thanks for the recipe. I loved it. I used extra chicken & only 1 red & 1 green pepper & no bacon. I lightly oiled 4 tortillas, as others suggested so they'd get crispy, and put oil side down onto 2 cookie pans. Then I put the chicken mixture on top & covered with another tortilla. After cooking, I sliced like a pie into 4 pieces. I froze the leftovers & microwaved & they were just as delicious. This one is a keeper in my recipe book!

Very good.  It's basically making a chicken fajita filling then baking it like a quesadilla.  I ended up frying on the stove because I had run out of room in my oven & they worked great.

We thought these were yummy!  I used one green one yellow and one orange pepper.  I also didn't have any fijata seasoning so I made my oun.  With chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, lime pepper, onion powder and a few other things.  The result was a very tasty dinner that the whole family liked.  Thanks Heather!

Freakin great, I loved it and I used simulated chicken. First time having it and making it. I used Kraft's Mozarella Singles for cheese and it was sooo good. Use the Quesadillas Jalapeno Spread from allrecipes.

These were great, and very easy! I don't think broiling the chicken is necessary. I just sauteed the chicken n the pan with the onions and peppers. I also added some diced tomatoes to the filling. Yummy!!

Really good recipe Heather, but I did play around with this a bit. I sauteed the peppers and added green onion instead of the white. I then added the chicken to the pan rather than broiling. Just because we love them, I threw in a can of refried beans to the mix. From there I treated this kind of like a Mexican grilled cheese sandwich. Topped one tortilla with the filling, placed another tortilla on top and fried in a tiny bit of oil in the skillet. Kids and hubby garnished with homemade guacamole, sour cream and taco sauce. "Sweetie Pie" immediately declared this a four star recipe and that's coming from someone who's not overly fond of Mexican food. Thanks so much Heather!

These were so good!  Instead of a package of fajita mix I used the sauce from Lime Chicken Soft Tacos from this site.  I also tossed some fresh mushrooms in with the peppers and onions.  Yummy!!

The flavour of these were great, but the bottoms of my quesadillas were soggy. Next time I will cook them in a hot dry frypan to make sure both sides of the tortillas crisp.  Served them at a tex-mex dinner with Corn and Avocado Salsa recipe from this site, sour cream, guacamole, salsa and shredded cheese.  Yum!

These turned out awesome.  On top of everything else, I added sliced olives to the filling and served the quesadillas with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  They were a hit at my Spanish-themed office party!

My husband said he loved these!  That was a first!  Im a great cook but he is very picky!  I even forgot to put the fajita seasoning in the chicken and they turned out great!  Some changes I made:  I covered the entire tortilla with everything then topped with another tortilla, sprayed with butter flavor pam and then placed under the broiler.  I flipped them over after 2 minutes or so, sprayed the other side.  I also added green tabasco before I topped it with another tortilla.
FAST AND EASY!

I'm so surprised I didn't like this recipe more!  I prepared as directed except cooked the chicken in the skillet rather than the broiler, (and used 1 less of each pepper).  I didn't care for the fajita seasoning flavor, and thought the filling was slightly dry, although it tasted better when I added salsa and sour cream.  I think different seasonings (possible cumin) and some mexican cheeses may have made a difference.  Maybe even some diced tomatoes or salsa in the filling would help.

This was also my first time making Quesadillas and they turned out wonderful!  I omitted the bacon bits as well (just not crazy about them).  My husband the picky eater, criticizes everything new I try to make, but this recipe he loved and wants me to make it again!  Thanks Heather!

EXCELLENT recipe! I made these for fellowship night and they were a hit! I made them without the green peppers since I don't care for them and I added some mushrooms. Definitely fold these and cook as the directions state instead of one tortillas covered by another; by folding the tortillas your filling won't melt out of the tortillas. Great recipe!!!

I served these as an appetizer at my party.  My husband said to me, "Where did you buy these, they're fantastic!"  Need I say more.  My only comment is I would add 4oz more each of the MOnterrey Jack and the Cheddar cheese.  I like my Quesadillas swimming in cheese.  Also, instead of folding a tortilla in half, I just spread the mixture on one tortilla and placed another tortilla on top, like a sandwhich.  Cut them into triangles and served with salsa and sour cream.  I only yielded 3 sandwich like Quesadillas (or I only used up 6 of the 10 I bought.)

Yummy!  I made these for a Mexican themed party & they were a hit!  I don't care for red or green peppers, but I added them anyway, for color & I think they made these quesadillas.  All the flavors blended together so well.

An absolutely wonderful recipe!  My fiance LOVES Mexican food and he really complimented me on these!  I basically kept the recipe the same, except I didn't have any pepper so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I drained the tomatoes because otherwise it would've been too runny.  I folded them and fried them in a pan.  Thanks Heather!

Yum! I decided not to add the Bacon Bits-the recipe didn't need them. I also marinated the chicken and peppers according to the package mix. Since it's just my husband and I, there was a ton of leftovers. I froze the extras. My husband insised that I thaw the leftovers one week later! He just can't get enough of these! I made it with spanish rice. Great recipe and soooo easy to make!

We are HUGE quesadilla and fajita fans. However, we were tired of the same old flavor from the premixed store bought fajita packages. I used this recipe, along with Tracy Cook's suggestion and recipe for the homemade fajita mix (minus the awful MSG), and this is by far the BEST quesadilla recipe we've ever had! It even beats all our favorite restaurants. The broiling method  did an amazing job cooking the chicken in about 7-8 minutes. This alone saved me an hour of time, as I usually pan fry it. I have a large family, so I cook 5 lbs at at time. With 5 lbs of Chicken, I multiplied Tracy Cook's recipe times 2 for the fajita seasoning. I then sauted 2 yellow onions, 2 red peppers, and 1 green pepper together, before adding it to the cooked meat. It was the PERFECT combination of all the stuff! I also use bowl butter to coat one side of a large tortilla so that it will brown and get crispy. I then place the tortilla, butter side down, on the frying pan, but ONLY half of the tortilla should be on the pan. Hold the remaining half upright in your hand while you fill the inside. First, place a layer of cheese, then a layer of the meat and veggie mixture, then another layer of cheese. Then, lay the remaining portion of the tortilla over the top (this will be butter side up) and wait for the bottom to brown. Once brown, carefully flip the quesadilla over so the other side will brown. The cheese will be nice and melted and will hold it all together very nicely! Thank you so much.

The flavor of these is good, but the soggy baked approach to the quesadilla is not a winner. I was very annoyed trying to get these things off of the baking sheet in a single piece. I ended up gingerly pulling each one off and skillet frying them to harden the outer shell. I wouldn't ever follow the cooking steps laid out here again. Use a skillet or other pan to brown the tortillas so that they have some structure and can be eaten like a quesadilla, not a casserole.

These turned out great. I cut the pepper and chicken into strips rather than chop them.  I sautéed the peppers and onions first, then cooked the chicken in the fajita seasoning and then combined. Had plenty left for lunch the next day. Will definitely make again.

I never ate quesadillas in Mexico or a Mexican restaurant so I don't know how it compares to the real deal. My husband said they tasted great though.
I did change some things in the recipe.  I baked the onions and peppers separate from the chicken. I also only spiced the chicken with fresh made fajita seasoning. I thought if I would spice it all, it would be to much.
I used one tortilla as bottom and one as top, with the food and cheese in between. And as said by other people, I added some water so the tortillas wouldn't dry out.

We ate them with fresh made guacamole and sour cream... I'll will make it again.

Made with spruce and ruffed grouse from husbands hunting. Made with from scratch fajita seasoning (recipe on this site). Used “habanero heat” shredded cheddar cheese only. Family dish of approval. Internally calling this “grouse-adillas.” Craving them writing this review.

The only change I made was to lightly butter the outside of each tortilla and then toasted the quesadilla on a griddle or in an iron skillet. The grandkids loved them!

Did the chicken in a sauté pan, added mushrooms and then ‘baked’ them in another pan lightly coated with Pam. Added sour cream and mild salsa on the side and everybody told me I could make them again. I think the chunks were too big, next time I’ll do thin slices, so the wrapper folds tighter.

Love these.  I don't have bacon bits and use 1/2 the cheese.  The first few times, I use packaged seasoning, but now I'm working on making my own seasoning using recipes from this site too.  They do take a while to prep-lots of cutting and chopping, but yummy when they're done!

I made it. Used some McCormick's Mexican seasoning instead of fajita mix, used some canned chicken breast in water that was sitting in the cupboard instead of fresh raw chicken breasts, and added a small can of mushrooms. Could've used just a little more of the seasoning, but all in all I really thought these were good, very easy and quick to make, and I'll definitely make again. The chopped peppers add a nice flavor and texture. I also adjusted the recipe to make 3 quesadillas.

Yes, I usually cook extra chicken  breasts when I make a meal and freeze them for later use.When I made this recipe I used  the frozen chicken {after  thawing and shredding it)ALso used a packet of taco seasoning instead o fajita seasoning and used a four Mexican cheese blend.Love this recipe since it is versatle. It was a great hit at our neighborhood gathering.

Absolutely fabulous (and surprisingly easy)! The only things I did differently were that I used leftover roast chicken, chopped into 1/2-inch cubes, instead of fresh chicken and I substituted Taco seasoning for the Fajita seasoning. Also, I baked the quesadillas for about 13 minutes instead of 10. My family LOVED this recipe and it will become part of my regular rotation. Thank you Heather!

Delicious! We used yellow, red and orange bell peppers. Flavorful and delish. Cooked down veggies about 30 mins to get them really soft. Spray baking pan with cooking oil and also spray top of quesadilla before you put in oven to bake.

I tried brushing the tortillas with olive oil but were still a little soggy.  I added a chopped jalapeno.  Overall were pretty good.  I will make again.

These were probably the best quesadillas I’ve ever made. I followed the reviewer Tracycook’s recipe for Fajita mix and that was incredible, although I did leave out the heat due to my toddler. And don’t skimp on the bacon bits, I think that was what tied it all together and made it awesome! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very, very tasty.  Okay, full disclosure - initially, I usually follow the recipe to a "T", but it's late and we needed something super fast for dinner tonight.  And, I always hate when someone completely changes the posted recipe, but as I said, we were in a hurry.   I'm hoping this will help another poor soul faced with the same situation.  So, I used canned chicken, drained, 4-cheese Mexican blend, my own blend of fajita seasoning, jarred salsa and bacon I had leftover from breakfast, diced.  Preheated a skillet on low to med-low, added a very small amount of olive to skillet, used a paper towel to spread evenly.  On one half of a flour tortilla, layered cheese, chicken, fajita seasoning, salsa, bacon and more cheese - - popped in the microwave for about 30 seconds; removed from microwave, folded in half, added to skillet.  Cooked on one side until golden and crispy (about a minute or so) flipped and cooked on other side until golden and crispy.   Smiles and happy faces all around!!!    Thank you, thank you, thank you for the original idea.

Oh emmmm yummm!!!! I substantially reduced the quantity (I cook for one) but no changes otherwise. I used a fajita seasoning mix sold by the savory spice shop. I am devouring these quesadillas in between writing this review. I served it with a dollop of sour cream and sliced avocado. Yum yum!!!

Delicious! I had pulled pork to use up and followed the rest of the recipe. We used a bbq tray to melt the cheeses and brown both sides. This will be a regular in our house with whatever meat we have!

Overall,while reading this recipe I found it to be quite boring.  I used 8 chicken breasts and cut them into thin strips. I added1 small teaspoon of garlic, a 1/2 tsp of Chipotle Chili Pepper and one taco seasoning pack plus s&p to taste and sauteed them in butter. Once the chicken cooked, I added thin strips of red, yellow and orange peppers and mixed well.  I put spread sour cream all over the tortilla, added my chicken mix, Roma tomatoes, corn niblets, black beans, diced green chilies, jalapeño peppers and cheese.  I folded the tortilla in half and gently cooked it in the frying pan until crisp.  I added sour cream, avocados, and pico de gallo on top.  If you want the mix slightly less spicy, dial back the Chipotle Chili pepper seasoning.  With my changes, it’s a 5 star rating.

I grilled the chicken instead of broiling as instructed. Then I cut up the chicken to add to the sautéed veggies. Very good quesadillas.

A healthier idea. I steam the chicken in  one can rotel type tomatoes first pour off half the liquid. If the breasts are thick I cover for a few minutes then take off lid and turn up heat until the juice is gone. Adds great flavor too.

This was a simple and wonderful meal.  Made the fajita sauce from scratch which added an explosion of taste.  Will become a staple at our house.

Turned out great. Half the cheese down first, then the chicken mix, then the rest of cheese to hold it together better. Wet the tortilla to get it crispy. Also added a green onion.

Great flavor! I added guacamole to the toppings. I didn't care for the results of baking, rather than cooking them on the stovetop. Baking dried out the wraps too much. I prefer my usual method of heating in a frying pan, using a spray or very thinly spread oil, to make them moist but with some crunch.

This recipe also worked well with Rotisserie Chicken.  
I sautéed the vegetables until soft, about 5 minutes, added the Rotisserie Chicken and homemade fajita seasoning with a little water and simmered for a few minutes then followed the assembly instructions.   Enjoyed the Quesadillas.  

 Some reviewers commented that the chicken was too salty but by making your own seasoning blend (found anywhere on the web) one can easily control the amount of salt.

I forgot the seasoning, left out the bacon, and they still tasted great. I used frozen veggies. Next time I'll use my homemade taco seasoning to keep the salt down. I used whole wheat tortillas and cheddar cheese, which is what I had on hand.

Don't use the entire seasoning packet. And a more savory cooking method is to spread butter on one side of each tortilla and fry them on the buttered sides in a good non-stick  pan. I don't fold mine but instead leave them whole and then slice them like a pizza.

It was quite easy to make and turned out pretty good. I would make it again with a few twitches. I would flip them halfway so both sides get crispy and I might cook them for maybe a little extra time about 5 mins each side.

Absolutely delicious! Had no green peppers, so used red, orange and yellow; had no Monterey Jack cheese, so used an Italian cheeses blend; made my own fajita seasoning via another Allrecipes offering as opposed to using store bought seasoning ... in short, the recipe is very amenable to substitution depending upon one's pantry, and that's an awfully good thing. Many thanks for this one -- it's a keeper!

This is a family favorite! Delicious and easy! I did make a few modifications to the recipe. I use a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning instead of fajita seasoning. I only use 1 green and 1 red pepper, and I omit the bacon bits.

I did not use Fajita seasoning because I didn't have any. Instead, I used  Taco Seasoning, and much less than the recipe  calls for ,  and I added more cheese. I used the Mexican blend of  shredded cheese ( in a pkg. ). Also, I used  2 tortillas instead of folding one  and spread sour cream over top tortilla, to aid with  holding the tortilla and all the contents underneath, together.    It turned out great!!!!

I made this spur of the moment when my sister came to town and it was delicious.  We used a homemade taco seasoning instead of fajita mix on the chicken and really piled the cheese on.  My three-year-old liked the chicken and cheese part, even if she wouldn't touch the peppers, but the rest of us ate every bite.

This recipe is excellent.  I used the Fajita Seasoning recipe by trmeeds on this site omitting the salt .  I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of that mix for this recipe.  Next time I will cut back to 1 1/4 tablespoons.

I actually opted to go the most popular route and do the seasoning mix myself, following others direction of ingredients. I also skipped the bacon bits, wrapped the tortilla in aluminum foil and placed it in my Lean Mean Grilling Machine to use as presser (for crispness). I love cheese, so I was extremely generous ??   My family loved it. Will be making it again soon.

This was a great recipe. I did change it a bit, because I hate broiling anything. I just cooked up some cubed chicken breast with the seasoning in a covered skillet(I made the seasoning that someone else suggested on another review, since I didn't have the little packet things). I added the peppers and onions after a few minutes. They cooked up nicely together, then I spooned the mixture in the tortillas, added some cheese on top. I did brush the tortillas with olive oil like someone suggested, and that worked perfectly. They were nice and crispy. My family loved it and I will be making again!

Added some spices per another review and brushed tortillas on both sides with canola oil. Flipped over after 10 minutes, so I cooked 10 minutes on each side at 350.  Delicious and the tortillas were wonderfully crispy!

These turned out delicious! I mostly followed the recipe. Except...I didn't have peppers or fajita mix on hand so I used leftover mushrooms and taco seasoning instead. Since I chose not to fold mine, I also picked up on other reviewers tip to brush the outer sides of the tortillas with olive oil. To save time, I used my Griddler/Panini press for some of the quesadillas. Others I cooked in the oven, as prescribed.

Cooked the chicken in the pan and then added the veggies. Quicker and one dish to clean ;) And used Taco Seasoning vs Fajita because I didn't have that. 
Great recipe! Kids liked it too.

I made this for my boyfriend and I.  I added peppers, onion, and tomato to his.  He absolutely loved it!  I did not measure anything.  I simply guesstimated what ratio would work best.  Instead of baking in the oven I placed all ingredients on the tortilla (I cooked the chicken in the mix before doing this), folded it over and cooked in a cast iron pan.  They came out beautifully.  I prefer to cook in the cast iron skillet then in the oven.

I put the veggies on the side for topping choices as not everyone in the house is a fan of certain veggies, and/or spice levels. I also slow cooked the chicken breasts on low for 8 hours before I shredded them, combined the shredded chicken with the corn tortillas and cheese for the oven. I served it with salsa and sour cream as a side option. Turned out wonderfully. Highly recommend this recipe to busy moms.

I used Ortega low sodium fajita seasoning, so it was not over powering at all. I grilled the chicken breasts and then diced them before tossing them in the seasoning. I put the fajitas on medium-ish heat on the grill. I kept them on the grill until the shells turned slightly golden. The cheese melted perfectly and the shells were slightly crispy. These were a big hit!

Delicious!!  Would be perfect for a large gathering such as Super Bowl parties or holidays.  I made a few changes, such as using mild taco mix instead of fajita, a red onion (because that's what I had) and I added a little garlic and leftover yellow corn to the onion and pepper mixture.  I also used a pre-mixed, pre-shredded cheese mix, "Mexican cheddar jack."  My tortillas crisped up perfectly.  Served with salsa and diced fresh tomatoes.  Yummy!!

My first time making quesadillas and I thought this recipe was great.  I didn't have the fajita seasoning on hand so followed advice posted; 'Thank you, Tracycook!'  Will definitely be making these again.

I made this two ways, one where I followed the recipe exactly...which is the 4 stars...and one where I used a cast iron skillet to finish the quesadillas.

Per the recipe the taste is very good but the texture isn't quite there.  putting the quesadillas in the oven to melt dries them out too much.  If you have time to melt them on a skillet and turn one side over when they are about half melted and remove immediatley to a plate to finish melting the texture will be restaurant quality.

Made these for dinner and loved them! I cut up the chicken into cubes and cooked it on the skillet with taco seasoning and a little beer. I cooked up a red, yellow, and orange pepper and towards the end I added a drained can of corn and a drained and rinsed can of black beans. I used the folded method as this gave me more space on my baking sheet. Thanks to one reviewer's suggestion of wetting the tortillas, they came out crispy. I will definitely make these again!

My family and I love this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was that my chicken was left over from dinner the day before so it was already cooked and seasoned.  I sauteed the onions and peppers first then threw the chicken and fajita mix  in to warm it.

I love this site!  Not only do you get wonderful recipes (thanks), but a multitude of tweaks in the reviews. I had some left over pulled chicken so I used that. I followed the recipe but did add green chilies, then red and yellow sweet peppers for color. I used the recipe for fajita seasoning that was offered as a review to this dish. It was wonderful!  My guy actually wants it again. That's a first!

These are fine, but I prefer my simple quesadilla recipe (chicken and green pepper - cook tortilla in a skillet with olive oil).

This was delicious.  Added sour cream, guacamole, and salsa as topping options. Also used the fajita seasoning from Tracy Cooks review. Loved it!

Loved this so much!  Great taste and super easy to make.  The bacon is a must and really gives it that necessary extra pop of flavor, so even if you are health conscious try at least adding turkey bacon.  A definite keeper in my house.

Just made these and they were yummy!!  I used 1.5lb chicken tenderloins and broiled on low.  They were very moist.  I added green onion as well as some red cayenne pepper.  I brushed the tortillas with some oil so they would get a little crispy.  Hubby is loving them too!

Great for parties!  I actually cooked the chicken and peppers together.  Rather than 4 total peppers, I used two (red and green).  I also added a can of black beans and used regular bacon instead of the bacon bits.  It was a hit!!

It was DELICIOUS!! I would have never thought to put the chicken in the oven. Husband and the kids loved it!! They've been asking for me to make it for a couple weeks now so this will definitely be one of the family go-to meals.

"The best Quesadillas I've ever had were the comments!  Made this for football night for eight of us.  I used two large chicken breasts and followed the recipe, cutting all ingredients into very small pieces. I also followed the suggestion to use half of the McCormick fajita packet.  These were great suggestions.  I also added garlic, as I seem to put garlic in almost everything that will embrace it.

I put the mixture in half of the tortilla, with the suggestion to put the cheese first, then the mix and then cheese to hold the quesadilla together, and folded to close.  Sauteed
in butter on both sides for that crisp yummy finish.  

So easy, so fast, have already made it again.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I've made it a few times now and we leave out the peppers because we don't like them. But this is something we make every other week.

Chicken Quesadilla Haiku: "Little too salty, from the fajita packet. Good recipe though!" My only deviation from the recipe was using spinach/herb tortillas instead of flour and putting one on top of the other rather than folding in half. I like baking rather than pan-frying quesadillas b/c it's less hands-on, and they're all ready to serve at the same time. I think the fajita seasoning and the bacon bits were definitely the culprits of the end result being a bit on the salty side, so next time I'd drop the bacon altogether and exchange the fajita seasoning for just a blend of Mexican-inspired spices again like AR's "Taco Seasoning I" which is always a win when used in any recipe.

Chicken quesadillas were awesome last night and we have plenty of chicken/pepper filling left. There were quite a few steps, but you can readily change this recipe to fajitas and save time. Also, I learned something new: broiling bite size chicken pieces takes about 10-15 minutes.

If you fry the chicken with oil it the cook the quesadillas on a griddle with the remaining oil they taste even better.

I made them this morning - turned out excellent! Thankyou so much for this recipe and also the tips from other reviewers. In addition to the onion and green peppers I added mushrooms and hot chilli sauce. I also added ginger and garlic paste, red chilli pepper flakes and some vegeta salts. After cooking the chicken and all the above well I stirred in some cream. I also used some cheddar cheese to bind the tortillas which I wetted a bit. I will definitely make them again!

This recipe was PERFECT for our tailgate!  It was easy to make, and everyone loved it.  I didn't use the red peppers and used only one green pepper.  I'm planning to use it again this weekend for a big playoff party.

Tried this and it tasted really good! I skipped the jack cheese and bacon bits and it turned out to be just fine. Also, it is better to make just enough servings because they don't taste as good after the microwave. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this last night. Super easy and super fast! I left out the bacon bits just because i didn't have any. I brushed the tortilla's with olive oil to make them crisp. I also took the easy way with the onions and peppers and just used the frozen bags of them you can get for $1.00 at the grocery store. I only used half the fajita seasoning mix and then added my own spices. Will make again :)

If you don't put them in the oven, you can brown them the way you want to in a skillet. I also prefer making them in a skillet because it gets that buttery taste on the shell. When it comes to seasoning, it's all about personal preference. Sometimes you can use just enough or too much. You also don't have to follow this recipe. It's like a Build Your Own Quesadilla.

I love this recipe, although I tweak it to my own standards. For starters, I don't like fajita seasoning so I use a packet of taco seasoning and cook it as the package instructs with cooked chopped chicken. I also omit the bacon bits, as in my opinion has no place near Mexican dishes. I also don't bake them in the oven but instead serve them inside warm rolled tortillas like a chicken taco! I also add sour cream and salsa to them. Very good!

I just made this for lunch. It is a wondeful, easy recipe. I tweaked it a little for our own tastes. I used the homemade fajita mix recipe which someone else posted on their review. I didn't use the garlic powder as suggested. Instead, pressed a fresh garlic clove into the veggies as they were cooking. I only made enough for the two of us. I added chopped green chiles and sliced black olives. My hubby loves it too and said he will eat it anytime I'm willing to make it.

Loved this recipe. I used one packet fajita mix and added red pepper flakes for some heat. So easy to throw together and very filling. I was surprised at how much flavour this quesadilla packed for such a simple recipe! 
I didn't bake mine, instead I brushed EVOO on one side of a tortilla, tossed it onto a hot skillet, spread the top with a bit of sour cream, sprinkle of cheese (dent have anything but sharp cheddar on hand) spread of chicken mix and another layer of cheese. I then covered it with another tortilla brushed the top, let it brown on one side and flipped it to brown the other. Came out perfectly crispy but not hard. Thank you for this, my whole family loved it!

Kids and adults give this a thumbs up.  I didn't have peppers so replaced with a can of corn sauteed in onion until slightly brown, then I added the cooked chicken per recipe and black olives and sauteed for about 4 minutes to get flavors throughout. I layered the tortilla shell with the chicken mixture, black beans and sweet potato.  The recipe works well with what you have on hand.  Also, watch the video. I've never prepared chicken this way, so much better.

These were very good and very easy.  Never thought to dice the chicken and bake.  Quick and yummy.  I didn't add peppers or onion - only wanted chicken and cheese quesadillas.  I did add about 1/4 of water over the chicken to keep it from drying out.  Will make again.

These were okay, but they're fajitas not quesadillas. Quesadillas have chicken, jalapenos, onions, black olives, tomatoes and cheese in them.

I do this recipe on the large flour tortillas and spread butter on the outside of the folded halfs before placing in the oven, and turn once halfway through the 10 minutes.  The lightly browned quesidilla has MUCH more flavor, holds the contents better, and is visually pleasing and appealing.

I pretty well came up with my own rendition of this recipe.  I had a bag of frozen chopped onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes and cooked them with my chicken only seasoned with seasoning salt.  I didnt have any other seasoning.  Then assembled them on a cookie sheet and baked as suggested.  Turned out yummy.  I'm not one for a lot of seasoning so did my own.  Thanks.

OMG this was so easy and easy to make. I used real bacon instead of imitation bacon. I also cooked the chicken and vegetable mixture in the bacon fat. If you like sweet and spicy taste use sweet red, orange and yellow  peppers and a sweet yellow onion.  I served this with refried beans and yellow rice. My family could not get enough of this meal.

Very yummy and easy to make! I used taco mix as I didn't have fajita seasoning, and omitted bacon bits. It came out pretty good. The next time I will try making fajita seasoning following the direction in Most Helpful Positive Review :)

Followed the directions basically, but I used Cumin and Adobo in place of the Fajita seasoning, and instead of serving individually, I added a layer (1/8 in.) of sour cream on one, and then topped it with more shredded cheddar. On top of this I put a second quesadilla to make a multi-layered dish. Rave reviews from the family!
I also had no boneless, skinless on hand, so I simply trimmed the skin, and boned some cheap frozen thighs I had in the freezer, then I cut them into strips (raw, seasoned them, and broiled them in the convection oven on 375 for 15 mins before continuing with the recipe.

Made this tonight and served it with a dollob of salsa con queso and sour cream. Poor dogs waited patiently for left overs but there were none. I overstuffed them and it was a bit messy. Next time I may use less inside and roll it up like a cigar and serve it as tailgate food without the mess.

Love this recipe because it is easy and timeless. I made this chicken quesadillas for my family and they love it. One thing I did different is that I did not put too much fajita seasoning.

I needed to cut the slices of chicken smaller. It was really easy to make and yummy to eat. I used my quesadilla maker to press it all together. Great idea for an easy supper. We added salsa on top, it was excellent!!javascript:void(0);

I was nervous about making quesadillas. These are usually something I would only order if I went out to eat, but they couldn't have been better! I didn't use the onions, but the peppers and chicken were just right. I used a mixture of colby jack and cheddar cheeses and we really enjoyed it! I think this is a recipe that I'll continue using!

These are outstanding!  I made everything on the stovetop because my oven was in use and it all turned out great!  I brushed the tortillas with oil before putting them in the skillet like others suggested and they were perfect.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

The quesadillas came out VERY good!! They were a little spicy so if you don't like your food spicy I would recommend choosing a mild fajita seasoning.  Overall these were very tasty and the recipe was was easy to follow. I would recommend making these for a movie night to snack on!!!

These were amazing.  Next time I make them I will make the full amount for freezing, because I would love to have them around, maybe for a quick snack.  The only changes I made are I used regular taco seasoning, and I used precooked chicken breast strips from the store.  I just pulsed them in my food processor to make them shredded.  I really don't think either thing really changed the flavor much, just made it a little easier for the time I had.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

Awesome and easy to put together. I cooked them on a flat griddle and they came out great (opposed to baking). We paired this with LuvAnn's  Guacomole (on this website) for a perfect condiment .

Next time we will add chopped jalepenos. I added extra meat which took away from the level of spice, won't do that again unless I have more fajita spice or I will make my own from this site.

I am not a cook, but I've been trying to cook more lately and this is the first recipe I tried -- it came out great! Super, super easy and just as good as the chicken quesadillas at my favorite Mexican place. I changed a couple of things: I marinated the chicken breasts overnight in fresh lime juice, a little olive oil, garlic and cilantro and I used red & yellow peppers (instead of red & green) and I added some chopped portobello mushrooms. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent... I followed this recipe and its directions to the T. Nothing was changed.  However, I don't know much about cooking... and the pan I cooked the chicken on was layered with canola oil, and then sprinkled with red pepper flakes and garlic powder...   I really don't think that did anything.  Please, someone find a recipe for that fajita seasoning, so this recipe will be truly home made.

This recipe is super easy and my family loves it.  We made it even faster by grilling chicken breasts on the grill the night before.

This was so good and very healthy!  I saw the recommendation to put a little water on the outside of the tortilla to make it crispy...dont forget to pam the pan otherwise your tortilla will stick!!  I used two large chicken breasts, one red and one green pepper, half an onion, added mushrooms, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I  boiled the chicken with 1/4 of the taco seasoning. Then, cubed it and added it to the vegetable mixture as well as another 1/4 of the taco seasoning on the skillet.  I used whole wheat tortillas for an added healthy alternative. I also left out the bacon bits.

Made this with some cooked shredded pheasant that I had. Fried the quesadillas on our griddle for 3 min. each side. Skipped the bacon. Very good twist on fajitas! Should be equally good with chicken.

I know how people feel about changing and then reviewing - however - I just want to point out that the only thing dif. I did was use a ginger marinade for the chix. instead of fajita seasoning - I marinaded for several hours (about 4) and I cooked the chix. in the marindade as well then let it rest and cut up! Husband and I were very happy - knew the kids would be a no go so we gave them something else - Will keep this one for sure!!11

Great recipe. I used the homemade fajita seasoning suggested by one reviewer, which was good, except too salty. I would reduce the amount of salt used the next time I make the seasoning. Also, I would shred the chicken a bit the next time I make this recipe. We really enjoyed the flavors and it was visually very appealing! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were OK. Not bad - I just didn't really care for the fajita seasoning. I added some cumin and another cup of cheese, but that didn't really "fix" them for me. Next time I'll probably make them the way I have in the past, which means just chicken and cheese, done in the frying pan.

SOOOO GOOOD!!!!, I halved the recipe, but now I wish I had done the whole thing. These were very simple to make. I used the southwestern flavored chicken strips and added the fajita seasoning as per the recipe and they were just perfect. My boyfriend raved about them, which is rare. I will be making these again.

Good, but really heavy on the cheese. I'd probably do a little less cheese than the recipe calls for next time. But if you like cheese a whole lot, leave it as is.

Very good and very filling recipe, I used a water spray bottle on the outside of the tortillas before I filled them and they crisped up perfectly. We halved the recipe using 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1 each green and red bell pepper, and 1 very small onion. It made 4 quesadillas using 10 inch tortillas. Prep was actually pretty easy since I have a veggie slicer from PC. I cut the chicken into small strips, about a 1/2 inch wide and maybe 2 inches long. We used a mexican blend cheese bag (from CostCo) instead of separate cheeses. Served with guac and salsa. Very tasty!

i thought this was pretty good.  i only used one red and one green pepper.  i also just bought a package of mexican mix cheese rather than combining the two different kinds the recipe called for......and i mixed both the fajita mix and half a pkg of taco seasoning mix to give it a little bit more of a kick.  no bacon for us in this one though.  easy, easy to make!

These were so easy, I used Fajita Seasoning, added some Cumin and Taco seasoning, just used green pepper and onion only. I put some Hot Pepper Jack and Cheddar cheese on them and when they were done we used sour cream and salsa. They were very very good. A Keeper.

I made this pretty much as written, but we cut down to one of each green and red peppers, and added two cans of green chilies. Instead of bacon bits I added 3 strips of cooked bacon. Incredibly good!

Top notch recipe - very easy and quick.  I made these a couple of days ago and they were a big hit.  I served them with a side of re-fried beans with green chilies and cheese.  I made only one small change by leaving out the bacon bits.

I made these quesadillas a while back with my boyfriend and they turned out amazing! We did make a few changes: omitted the bacon and changed up the cheeses, we used a mexican blend that has quesadilla and monterey jack I do believe. We also added a few spices to the chicken, but I couldn't tell you what: my boyfriend has a habit of getting 'spice happy' and adding whatever he feels would be awesome. They turned out really great though! Definately will make again!

These quesadillas are delicious.  I make them exactly as the recipe states except I omit the bacon bits ~ we're not fans of bacon.  When we're done with dinner I always wish I had more for lunch the next day, as there are NEVER any left overs.  Next time I'll have to remember to make a double recipe!  Oh ~ It is only my husband, 3 year old daughter and I so I half the recipe as stated to accommodate our little family.  Everyone loves it, even my daughter gobbles these quesadillas up!  Yummy!!!

Not as memorable as we'd expected. Kids indifferent, as was I. Wife enjoyed quite a bit, however. 

If I did make again, would simply insert ingredients in soft tortilla, and eat like a taco.

Excellent! I made these and they tasted SO GOOD! I sauteed mushrooms, peppers, and onions then toppede the ready to bake quesos with jalapeno monterey jack cheese. I made chicken and spinach ones for my son as he doesn't like peppers. Topped them off with sour cream and fresh salsa! Gotta try em no sense ordering them at Mexican restaurants when you can make them at home....they taste so much better!!!! Great recipe THANKS!

This recipe worked really well. I followed the tips about olive oil on the tortillas and it definitely made them crispy. I have made this twice now and love it every time.

I made both chicken and steak quesadillas - I cooked them separately using a fajita mix.  This was a big hit.

This recipe was so good. I made it for my family. I altered the recipe slightly but it was just delicious. I recommend this for a good mexican night. I made Goya spanish rice for a side with ole de paso hot sauce.

Perfect! I changed it like the reviews suggested:

- One can of Ro-Tel Toms 
- Doubled the sauce

It's become a permanent meal with me and my husband!

This was quite bland, and no one in the family found it to be very reminiscent of a quesadilla. We tried dicing the peppers and chicken much smaller afterward, adding jalapenos and extra cheese; but it still left something to be desired. Would not make this recipe again.

Probably the first AllRecipe I have ever done exactly according to the  recipe. I thought it was great.  I would note if you want your tortillas to be crunchy maybe heating them in the skillet first would make a difference. I couldn't seem to bake them to a crispyness I liked. Maybe if it was hotter?  Anyway they went quick. My friend's response, better than the catered lunch I had today.

Great! Nothing else to say. Just follow the recipe (although it also works well if you choose to grill the folded tortillas instead of cooking in the oven).

With chicken leftover (white meat), a bit of garlic and fresh seasonings, it was very good.  I will surely continue to browse on your site. It is a comforting recipe for the winter like we have in Québec.

These were good, but probably better for a snack than a meal. Also, I might use taco seasoning on the chicken next time instead of the fajita seasoning that gave it a little bit of an aftertaste. Otherwise, though, we enjoyed this recipe, and I am glad to have made extra for lunch tomorrow.

These are THE BEST quesadillas I've ever made!  I used to make the Campbell's soup recipe but these were so much better and everything stayed together and there was no mess!  I add a little red onion for color and flavor but that was it!  Loved it!

Great recipie, did a quick marinade for chicken with lemon and adobo seasoning instead of suggested seasoning.  Used real bacon.  My guests raved - it was the first appetizer gone on the table.

Nice change of pace.  I changed this a little.  I cut the recipe in half, used chili seasoning and baked the chicken in the oven for 40 minutes in foil.  I used only 1 red pepper and did not use the bacon bits.  You can just adjust this recipe to your taste.  However, this is not something I am going to go out of my way to make

SOMETHING SO SIMPLE, YET SO GOOD! I DID LEAVE OUT THE BACON BITS! ADD A DOLLOP OF SOUR CREAM AND GUACAMOLE ON THE SIDE AND WOW, THESE QUESADILLAS TASTE GREAT! AND THEY ARE VERY COLORFUL! I WILL FOR SURE BE ADDING THIS ONE TO MY RECIPE BOOK AND THIS WILL DEFINITELY BECOME A FAMILY FAVORITE!

These were great.  I subbed real bacon for the bacon bits (of course) and served these with a side of refried beans, a dollop of sour cream and a jar of salsa.  There were no leftovers!

I made a change after making it according to the recipe.  I heated them in an electric skillet (or a frying pan would be fine too) rather than the oven.  The oven dried them out too much.  I added a little butter to toast them (like making a toasted cheese sandwich).  This made them much tastier!

I made these last night and they were gone in an instant. I've been looking for something different to cook at home and this is one of many recipes that I wanted to try. I added Spanish rice, chips and salsa with avocado as a dip. This was a wonderful meal. Thanks for the recipe Heather.

Used no oil whatsoever. Left out the veggies as my kids only like chicken and cheese. Used a colby/jack finely shredded blend and served with sour cream on the side.

I made this along with the 7-layer dip I for a football party. I followed the recipe for half of them and added some diced jalapeno peppers in the other half. Everyone loved both with and without the peppers. Great quick and easy recipe.

Yum!  I added a little cumin and halved the recipe.  I also only had small tortillia shells, and they worked fine.  This might be good with a little jalepeno pepper.  I also used fresh bacon cooked and crumbled.  Serve with a little yellow or spanish rice, and you've got a meal!

These are absolutely delicious!!! I cut the recipe in half except for the cheese because well, we LOVE cheese and I left out the bacon bits. Even with the recipe cut in half we still had tons left over! They are so easy to make and not too spicy at all. They're just spicy enough to give a great flavor. And they are so filling! Perfect!

These were great! I mixed the cheeses instead of putting any on top. I'll probably use more onion next time and maybe some jalapeno.  I also dipped had sour cream on the side.

Great recipe for quesadillas. I used both chicken and steak that I grilled first and then added to the tortilla. There were even left overs that I used to make fajitas the next day.

Very good.  I used shredded mexican cheese instead of the monterey jack and cheddar seperatly.  I also didn't use red peppers (because I forgot to buy them) but I'm sure it would've tasted just as good with them.

I have made these several times before and I love them. I made them again a few days ago and tried what a few other people suggested - not folding the tortillas but having one on the bottom and one on the top. I didn't like it as much. This is probably because I like to have lots of stuff in them and they are then too fat - if the tortillas aren't folded over you can't pick it up to eat. It falls apart. I used 1lb of chicken and thought the fajita seasoning was a little strong. I have used more chicken in the past - 1.5lbs - and it was fine.

I made these for the Superbowl.  They were really good!  Only problem I had was I baked them about 8 minutes and the edges of the shells got too crispy.  They weren't as soft as ones I get at restaurants.  If anyone has any hints, I would appreciate it!  I will make these again though

Everyone (including the kids) loved it!  I made two batches - chicken and beef, which worked out well because half the people liked beef, and the other half liked chicken.  LR
