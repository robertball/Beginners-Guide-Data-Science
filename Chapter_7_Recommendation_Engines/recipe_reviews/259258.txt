Ditch the sandwiches and do this for your next lunch on-the-go. I added the optional ingredients and suggest using them. I added avocado on top squeezing the lime over it to keep them from turning brown and added sour cream on the side in a separate compartment. I made this 16 hours before eating. It held up to 10 hours in the fridge and 6 hours in a thermal bag with only ice packs to keep it cool. So thumbs up for your lunch box! Thank you for your recipe.
