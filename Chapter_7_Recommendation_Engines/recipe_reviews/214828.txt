Great, tasty sandwich with lots of flavor. I recommend making the following adjustments to the recipe: season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Instead of using dried onion, I chopped a medium onion, minced four cloves of garlic and added 1/4 cup of molasses to 3 pounds of flat iron steak, allowing it to cook for six hours. The end result is a sweet, tangy bbq sauce with fork tender steak. Wonderful!

Yummy! First time I've tried a flat iron steak, and I followed the recipe exactly. So tender and delicious. Just the right bbq flavor too. I'll be making this often. Thanks for sharing.

This is just an OK recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly even used the dried chopped onion, I know some people have opted to use fresh onion instead but I made these for my sons dinner tonight and my youngest son refuse to eat it!  I found the steak dry, the taste I personally did not like.  Just did not taste like BBQ to me, my kids thought it was ok.  I don't think this is a recipe I will be using again.

My hubby proclaimed this a definite keeper.  So that's it!  I followed the recipe with the exception of the onions-- I used a half of a fresh chopped onion.  I made Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls and Sweet Restaurant Slaw from this site to round out our dinner.  The only thing I'd do different is to double the recipe and freeze some if it doesn't all get eaten!  And I would try cutting the whole onion in slices rather than chopping so it'd fit better on the sandwich.  I myself would really like this over rice rather than a sandwich, but however it's made would be just fine!   Very easy recipe except for the job of cutting off the fat from the meat beforehand.  I lost a pound of the meat purchase just from that, and it takes a little cutting to get to the slowcooker!

Could not find flat iron steak so I used a different kind of beef.  Came out nice and tender, falling apart.  I also seasoned the meat with flour, salt, and pepper and used thin sliced onion.  This is not a recipe that I would say is awesome BUT it was so quick to put together (10 mins start to finish), one bowl and the crockpot to clean,  and when I came home from work dinner was done.  Could not get any easier. The coleslaw added a nice crunch. Used Sweet Restaurant Slaw from AR which is also very easy and served it with rolls and white rice.  Will make again

Ridiculously easy and ridiculously delicious!  I used 1/4 cup chopped onion instead of the dried onion, and served for dinner with mashed potatoes,  Yum!

This recipe fell short for us.  While the meat was tender, there simply just wasn't enough flavor in the sauce for our tastes. I ended up adding bottled BBQ sauce which made it much more flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe for us to try, Linda!

This was very good.  I did add a bit more molasses and a squirt of honey (my bf and I like our barbeque a little more on the sweet side), and I seasoned the beef with some spices.  I also didn't have time to put it on high and then low, so I just kept it on low for about 6 hours, and it still turned out great.  The only thing I would do differently next time would maybe be to add a tablespoon or so of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce a bit.

I came across a flat iron steak for cheap at the store and figured I'd find a way to cook it.  This recipe surprised me.  It had a different flavor and was easy to prepare.  Instead of dried onion I added half a medium chopped onion.  Not sure about using this on a sandwich since it was pretty "wet" in the crock pot.  I served it over mashed potatoes with a side of green beans.  Will definitely make again!

Deeeeelicious!  This was terrific.  I forgot all of the reviews said it was kind of salty and I salted my meat before I placed it in the slow cooker and it tasted just fine to me.  Maybe it wasn't salty because I used low sodium soy sauce...  This was perfect as it...but who doesn't love garlic?  I added some garlic powder when i salted the meat at the beginning.  this was great try it!  oh I did have to use flank steak as I was unable to find a flat iron steak but  next time i make this I want to find flat iron steak

This was really good. It didn't look appetizing at first but it tasted quite good on nice soft kaiser rolls. My husband liked it so much he ate some in a sandwich then a bowl of just the meat.  Easy to throw together too. I will make this again and again.

This dish was delicious, and I do not say that easily. Very nice taste and it is so simple to make. I added a fresh onion in place of dried minced onion and it was a hit with the whole family. I will definitely make this again.

My family just loves this!  I've made this several times for sandwiches and over mashed potatoes.  I'm rather generous with the molasses.  It's fork-tender every time!  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy!  Also used fresh onion instead of dried, and I served it over yellow rice (granddaughter's fav thing).   This is a keeper.

YUMM!! Whole family loved this! Used fresh onion and garlic and lil more molasses plus part of bottled bbq sauce leftover in fridge. Forgot the soy sauce but used lil wosteshire. Thickened it with lil cornstarch in couple Tablespoons cold water on high at end while cutting the meat. 3 1/2 hours was perfect for medium rare.  Next time is will use bigger roast and make more sauce, it was so good. Didn't need coleslaw.

This recipe deserves 10 stars! It was the most tender meat, and had good flavor. My favorite thing I have ever made in a crockpot.

made  some changes  used spicy ketchup instead of reg.  and used Kraft zesty Italian lime dressing because I didn't have any reg. Italian.  I also sliced up one onion and one yellow pepper and added these. Really tender and very tasty , will make again.
