I made this dip for a bbq with a bunch of friends.  It went over really went as something very unique on the table.  I prepared a large bowl of ice and then placed the dip inside that in a smaller bowl and that kept it nice and cold.  There were some people there from Holland and they preferred to eat it straight like a custard.  I guess that it because of the cottage cheese. It was a big hit.

This dip is great.  I also tried it using cream cheese instead of the ricotta. Both versions were tasty and terrific if you're looking for a light dessert to serve.

I love the almond flavor of this dip. The texture of the cottage cheese was a little unusual and distracting though.

I made this for a ladies poker night and we barely touched it.  The cottage cheese gave it a weird lumpy look and it had a very milky/almondy flavor.  We thought it might look better if the cottage cheese was pureed too.  I ended up dumping the whole thing out and we just ate the fruit by itself.
