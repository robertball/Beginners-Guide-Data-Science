This was a very simple drink to make. I made this drink at a bachlorette party and it was a hit. I had finely grated lemon zest to the sugar to use on the rim of the glass it tasted great. :-)

Very good, but try adding equal parts citron vodka and limoncello liqueur in place of any sort of sour mix for a true professional lemon drop martini.  mmmmmmmmmm.

I've tried several lemon drop martini recipes and this one is the best by far!  It's great as-is, and I've played around with it for variations too.  I rarely zest the lemons, because I'm just too lazy, and it's still great.  Sometimes I use Skyy ginger-infused vodka.  Once I replaced the lemons with limes, used ginger vodka, and replaced half the simple syrup with ginger shrub.  Lots of things you can do for variety, or just drink it how it is.

I cut the lemon to 1 1/2 and it was PERFECT for me! Even w/ this small change it made me want to pucker up - not overwhelming in tartness but still packed the pucker power!

I had 4 !arge lemons in the freezer from when we left on a 2 week vacation. I defrosted them in the frig intending to make some lemon bars or cookies. I juiced them, began pouring over recipes and by the time I found a candidate, I didn't feel like baking anymore. Heck with the cookies, I wanted a cocktail! This was perfect! I didn't add any simple syrup. Cheers!

This was pretty good but it was very sour. I ended up doubling the syrup and cutting the lemon juice in half due to the extreme tartness. I also added a mint leaf to my glass to increase the flavor.

Loved this!  Halved the lemon and upped the vodka a tad. A great way to end Memorial Day weekend.
