I made the non-alcohol version as I didnt have any of it on hand and the soup was amazing. It is a light version of French Onion. On many levels it was more enjoyable. I stuck with tradition and put bread on the bottom instead of apples--Very good! I do recommend pureeing the soup for more of an even consistency as there are a lot of onions. Enjoy!

Friends made this soup for me.  It was outstanding.  I will make it for friends.  Ill serve this soup with a salad.  Great.   My friend did substitute Green Apple flavored vodka instead of the applejack brandy....Make it, you won't be disappointed.

I made this soup for Christmas Eve dinner for 9. I made it exactly as called for except when tasting, I found that it needed a tiny bit more apple so I put a little more apfelkorn in. I strained the soup into tea glasses for a "cappuccino" as a between course in a 5-course meal. This soup was the hit of my dinner! Next time I would make a crouton to float in it. That's all. Make it!! Your friends and family will love it and ask for more.

The only way this could be better is if I baked it in French Onion Soup dishes with swiss cheese on top. Very delicous!
