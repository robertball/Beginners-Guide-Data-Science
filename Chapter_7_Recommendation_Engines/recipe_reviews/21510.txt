I'll be the first one to review this great recipe! I did not have the pandan leaf & I revised it a bit. I rinsed rice, 2 cups in rice cooker with almost 4 cups water. Meanwhile I took one 14 oz can 'lite' coconut milk, 1/4 c brn sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 t salt cooked on stove simmered about 5 mins. Individual rice servings, add sauce on top as desired. The rice cooker makes it so easy to get the rice perfect. Thanks for the basic recipe...delicious!

Good texture, but too sweet. I reduced the amount of brown sugar, and added cooked mango with the sugar.
