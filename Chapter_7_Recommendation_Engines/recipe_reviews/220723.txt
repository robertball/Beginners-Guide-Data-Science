My family loved this recipe.  Instead of using cream of mushroom soup I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes (which my family also loves)

Very basic affordable recipe that anyone can expand on. If you have a family, this is the perfect base for a recipe. There is plenty to entice the entire family with leftovers. I would take this recipe as a canvas for family creativity.

Quick and easy to prepare and very tasty.  I added a splash of white wine after the cabbage was introduced to deglaze the pan but other than that, I changed nothing.

I came across this recipe while looking for something to make with a half head of cabbage left over after making a small coleslaw.  It is delicious!!  I've made it a few times and I'm sure I will be making it many more times.  We really like it!

This is excellent and adaptable, great basic to build for your family's taste. I have used bulk turkey sausage instead of ground beef, always use 1/2# of meat, trying to use less meat all around, still great taste. We use a clove of minced garlic, sometimes a beef bullion cube (which takes care of all the salt needed), and a couple of tablespoons of Lite sour cream.  Great LO's for tomorrow!

I am really slow in the kitchen and this did not take long at all. I've made this several times already, it's so easy and comforting. I like to add a little cinnamon to it and also some paprika.

My husband and I loved this. I added diced tomatoes with green chilies and celery to the recipe. Turned out great and moist.

Really good, I used a entire head of cabbage and 1 16oz package of light egg noodles.  I may have to add a 2nd can of cream mushroom soup for the 2nd day to re-heat, a good meal and inexpensive.

My husband is not that crazy about cooked cabbage, but he really loves this dish.  I made it as written, and it was amazingly easy and very tasty.  I will definitely make it again!

This was good, but a little bland.  We did use extra cabbage, noodles, and milk.  Filling comfort food.

well, it will get you through in a pinch but this was so flavorless! I mean I should have known but still...I ended up adding a few strips of bacon crumbled and some frozen corn sauteed in the bacon grease and some garlic salt and then it was pretty good and we finished it off but as is we would have just thrown it out.
