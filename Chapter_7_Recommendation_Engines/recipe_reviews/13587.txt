This soup is not only easy to make, but incredibly good!  I didn't have whipping cream - just used what I had on hand - skim milk. Flavor was still great and felt better because it was less fattening.

Based on other reviews and personal preferences I modified this recipe as follows: 6 cups reduced salt chicken stock  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  4 cups pumpkin puree  1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley  1 cup chopped onion 1 chopped red pepper  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 2 clove garlic, minced  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream Â½ tsp fresh ground pepper Dash nutmeg  I pureed the peppers and onion with a bit of stock prior to cooking. I added the parsley and nutmeg prior to simmering for the last 30 minutes. This soup was so delicious that even the biggest skeptics helped themselves to more. I have made it twice and served it to all ages 2yrs to 85 yrs and everyone LOVED it! So yummy even for people who do not like the taste of pumpkin.

This was great! A bit of nutmeg really sets the flavors off, but do it at the end and just add small amounts at a time or else it will overpower the soup. I would also recommend adding an extra clove garlic as it really brings out a bit more flavor. Serve this with a good quality french bread stick (should be very hard on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside).

I must say, I am quite surprised by all the stellar reviews.  Some have said that they are not fans of pumpkin, and they loved this, so, perhaps that's the issue.  I love pumpkin!  For once, I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the soup to be quite watery and bland.  It tasted more like chicken stock with cream.  I attempted to thicken it with a potato, cornstarch in water, and, finally, canned pumpkin.  It tasted fine, but, not great, and I couldn't get over the thinness.  If I were to play with this recipe, I would definitely do two things differently:  I would cut the stock in half and add more if I thought it necessary, and I would roast the pumpkin (as opposed to boiling it in the stock) for a more robust pumpkin flavor.

Decided to make this recipe, but didn't feel like going to the grocery store.  Luckily, I had two cans of pumpkin.  I just minced my onions super fine since I wouldn't be blending the soup.  Also, I had to sub half & half for cream.  Turned out delicious.  I had some zucchini bread leftover from the day prior that I sliced and toasted.  Made a great topper for the pumpkin soup.

We tried this soup and even the sceptics loved it! My husband had to make a second batch just to get some! It's very savory, very creamy. Try using 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 veg stock. Nice variation.

Delicious! This will be the appetizer for Thanksgiving. I added a dash of red pepper and some nutmeg, boy did that kick it up a notch! Also cut the pumpkin in half and baked it at 375 for 10 mins first just to make cutting and peeling it a little easier. Definately 5 star.

Excellent, with a wonderful and complex depth of flavor - in other words, there's a lot more going on here than just pumpkin.  Maybe it was because I cooked the onions low and slow for a looooong time, until they were good and caramelized.  Maybe it was using a good, rich chicken stock. I took the easy way out (and why not?) and used canned pumpkin, saving both time and effort for the same, delicious result.  This was very thick, so I found I needed to use considerably more chicken stock to get the desired consistency.   I used half-and-half rather than heavy cream and it worked just fine. I garnished this with a little plop of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh parsley and cooked and crumbled bacon. Deeply flavorful, satisfying and very gourmet!

Neither my wife or I like pumpkin but I know it's good for you so I have been looking for a way to have and like it. Finally, here is the answer. We both really loved this soup and our 4 year old liked it too.

I will definitely be making this again but I will probably be making twice as much next time.

This was sooooo good. I thought it was yummy and my mom absolutely loved it. It was very thick and creamy. Easy to make, except removing the seeds from the pumpkin..I loved the fact that the recipe called for fresh pumpkin, though. I added red pepper for a little kick. Highly recommended, especially for cold, rainy days. Would be delicious with grilled cheese sandwiches, but definitely enough on its own for a filling meal. Yum yum yum

I had lots of leftover pumpkin after Halloween last year and I was determined not to let it go to waste. I looked around for recipes here and decided to try this one. Glad I did! It was delicious and heated up well. I know I'll make this again next year.

Great soup!  Just a little helpful suggestion.  If you have one of those submersible wands you can avoid the tedious task of running this through the food processor 1 cup at a time.

This was so easy to make!!! I added 2 potato's to make a bit thicker & didn't add the salt as I thought the stock was salty enough.To cut down on time, after I pureed the pumpkin I just added the cream.Turned out great!!!

Very good!  I used canned pumpkin instead.  I halved the recipe and used one can of pumpkin (15 oz I think).  My friend had some too and liked it a lot.

This is a fantastic soup. I added 1/2 and 1/2 cream because it was what I had on hand, and added  approx. 1 1/2 red pepper and freshly graded pepper instead of peppercorns after reading the reviews. I also used dethawed fresh pumpkin i had previously frozen cubed. As a final point , I did puree the pumpkin and garlic prior to adding it to the chicken and vege stock. Excellent!

Sieve your soups, people.   I found this to be stock heavy, so on the second try I halved the stock and got a much better consistency. Also, rather than small blending portions, I threw the whole thing in a large blender and then poured it through a sieve. It was perfect consistency after that.

I picked this recipe because of the lower calorie/fat content compared to most soups of this nature. I followed the recipe except for one thing...I used fresh butternut squash instead of pumpkin. We only get pumpkin from India here and it's not as nice. I served it with a swirl of whipping cream and parsley on top. I then cut circles of a small baguette and made a notch in them to sit on the edge of the bowl. The ladies at my luncheon all enjoyed the taste and appearance.

I used all ingredients accordingly except significantly reduced the amount of water and simmering time. The first time I made it with the liquid amount in the recipe and it just took way too long to reduce. Pumpkins don't need that much boiling anyways and I thought it retains flavor and nutrition better if not over cooked. I suggest using enough liquid so it's just covering the pumpkins (plus a bit more).

Awesome recipe!  Canned pumpkin works well, and it's delicious with a dash of nutmeg, as other reviewers suggested.  Also had to use dry thyme, but did not affect the flavor.

Excellent soup, and a good way to use up home-cooked pumpkin that came out, well, soupy.  I added half each of red bell and poblano peppers simply because I had them, but the soup would have been fine without them.

This was a great soup! The only problem I had was that it was too peppery for our taste.  It was almost spicy there was so much.  I will make this again, but cut back on the pepper next time.

This was "OK" but kind of bland. I toasted some pumpkin seeds and sprinkled them on top for presentation which helped. Probably will not make again.

This is great soup! It was the first time I attempted to make Pumpkin soup. I altered it slightly based on other reviews. I added pepper, 4 garlic cloves, a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. The extra pepper and garlic adds a little zing. I didn't add any whip cream to keep the calories down. Very Yummy!

Yummy and simple. No cream needed! The pumpkin alone makes this seem thicker than I figured it would.  I added cooked quinoa to itand it was a perfect consistency with that extra protein and filling-ness!

It doesnt have a very strong pumpkin flavor, but that is ok.  I like that this recipe isn't sweet.  We enjoyed this a lot.

Wonderful soup. I doubled the amount of pumpkin, used ground black pepper, dried thyme, and green onion. Fresh parsley didnÂ´t improve the flavor of the soup; itÂ´s better leaving it creamy instead of having little herb pieces to nibble on between spoonfuls.

This was a nice change to try and I will make it again. I made a slightly different version: 4 cups chicken stock & 2 cups chicken boullion, 1/2 cup vitamin D milk instead of whipping cream (to make it lower fat) & 2 small cans of pumpkin. Even when using the canned pumpkin, be sure to blend in the blender. It helps the onion blend into the soup and not be so chunky. This seems like a great recpe to freeze in a freezer bag, so I did! :)

DELICIOUS! i cooked this soup for my boyfriend and his roommate, who was skeptical to taste it.  he ended up eating two heaping bowls!  i had to beg them to save me some leftovers!  i baked the pumpkin in the oven first, so it would be easy to cut.

I love this savory pumpkin soup recipe. I also like to add rosemary and a dash of red pepper. Sometimes I'll use greek yogurt or sour cream and some milk or half and half instead of the heavy cream to make it tangy. I also learned that it's easier to get the pumpkin from the skin if I half or quarter it and put it in the oven at 350 until it gets soft enough to easily peel.

This is a great recipe for pumpkin soup, although i did make some adjustments to my personal taste. It was DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe and used 3 cups chicken broth (from bouillon cubes, did not add extra salt), i minced some onion and red bell pepper and sauted it with the garlic before adding the broth and pumpkin (probably used about 3 cups pumpkin puree). also added 2 bay leaves, some ground ginger, and cayenne pepper to up the flavor, before i did i thought it seemed like it still needed something.  I also used milk instead of heavy cream and it was the perfect consistency. I will definitely make this again!!

I agree a little with another reviewer that the chicken flavor was too strong as the recipe stands, so I think next time I will substitute vegetable stock next time.

We do not like this recipe.  We used a "Chickenless" stock that has been very, very successful in the past.  We followed the recipe.  We added the bay leaf and the peanut butter as per the comments suggested.  The soup did not taste good.  We tried adding various spices and sugar for a pumpkin pie flavour, but that didn't work.  By the time we added curry and cumin--our usually successful resuscitation of all soup recipes--it just tasted bad.

It was OK.  Not the best I've ever had.  I've had fresh, organic pumpkin soup from a very reputable gourmet food company and it was literally "to die for".  I couldn't keep my husband and his friend from hogging it all.  This recipe did not hold a flame to that.  My husband and his same friend had zero interest in this soup.  I will keep looking for a pumpkin soup that will get me closer to heaven.

Very easy, tastes amazing! I left everything the same except no whipping cream because I do not eat dairy. Instead I soaked 1 c. cashews for two hours and blended with the soup in the food processor then cooked with the soup for the remainder of time. Love this recipe, thank you!

I did the lazy girls way of making this. Combined 1 can purÃ©ed pumpkin, 2 cans chicken stock, 1 tbls each of salt, parsley, onion powder, and garlic powder. Whisk all together over medium heat (whisk occasionally while cooking ) and let
It boil off long enough to get as thick as you would like it then add in a couple spoonfuls of sour cream (that's what I had on hand). 
It was delicious! The only thing that would have made this better would have been some pumpkin seeds added to garnish and put some chunk into the bites.

I have had a 10-year-long craving for pumkin soup ever since I tried it on a cruise in 2001!  I had been meaning to try and make it myself, but thought it would take too long.  I finally tried it and it wasn't too hard afterall.  I thought that the soup was delicious, although not *quite* as good as what I remember it being.  I added some allspice, cinnimon, and nutmeg to this recipe, but I think that I might have gotten a little bit carried away on the amounts.  To try and tone it down, I added more half and half.  Unfortunately, my husband (who is lactose intolerant) got sick everytime he ate it.  Oops!  At least that meant more for me. :)

I really liked this soup.  I cut the recipe in half since my husband doesn't like pumpkin, I used canned pumpkin, skipped the thyme and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I put a pat of butter on top.  Very good! Thanks for sharing.

I agree with those that used less stock.  I used 4 cups for a smaller, thicker batch.  Simple, tasty recipe!

I had a lot of leftover pumpkin innards after halloween, so I thought I would give this recipe a shot. I did a few things differently- sauteed the onion before adding pumpkin and stock, used half vegetable and half chicken stock, and added extra garlic and peppercorns. It is absolutely fantastic. This is definitely going to be my official after halloween use-up-the-pumpkin recipe. :-D

This recipe is awesome if you enjoy creamy potato soup but would like to switch it up a bit. The pumpkin taste is only slightly noticeable. If by any chance you're apprehensive about trying this recipe because you worry you'll feel like you're eating a pumpkin pie or heck, a watered down jack-o-lantern for that matter, you've got nothing to worry about (I myself can't stand pumpkin pie, but I love this stuff!). My fiance and I both agreed this recipe is awesome, but might be even better if there were cubes of potatoes added in at the start of the 2nd simmer to give this a bit more substance and something to bite into.  If you don't have plans on using the other 1/2 of your pumpkin or the other 1/2 of the pint of whipping cream, it'd be in your best interest to double this recipe to save more money and possibly have left-overs for later if your family doesn't eat the whole pot in one sitting. I only made a single batch because the recipe writer claimed this made 9 servings (HA! The max for a single batch is 4 servings in my opinion). In addition to using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and totally eliminating the salt, I also used a potato masher rather than pureeing the soup in a blender. This gave the soup a little bit of texture and meant fewer dishes for me to clean later. ;)

This is very good.  I had to make my own veg stock, instead of chicken and otherwise, did it like the recipe said.  It is yummy.

Decent recipe, though it'd be wise to modify the amount of salt that goes into this. The first time I made it, I used normal chicken stock without the added salt - and it was so salty it was undrinkable! Definitely go for the salt-reduced stock.

I have been making this every year for Thanksgiving.  Everyone initially says "yuck, no thanks". But then they try it and love it, even the kids.  Instead of the fresh pumpkin I use two cans of pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling).  And instead of transferring it to a blender I use an emulsion blender right in the pot.  A lot less messy.  Make extra for the next day!!

Bland. Mediocre. We completely followed the directions. We then added some curry powder. It was a little better, but it was nothing to write home about.

I did a cup less of the stock and some extra pumpkin and I loved how it turned out! I also carmelized the onions in the pan before adding all the other ingredients. My fam loved it!

I used canned pumpkin and doubled the recipe. I ended up using 10 cups of canned and used half vegetable broth for the recipe. The texture was great but this was the most tasteless pumpkin soup. I added dried cloves, nutmeg, red pepper, allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, sherry, brown sugar, more salt, dried thyme, onion powder and probably some things I have forgotten and it was delicious. I wouldn't recommend this recipe as is.

So I made this last year and it was pretty good. Seems bland though and I'm not sure what's wrong ! Also, it is very gritty ! I'm a very "clean" cook so I don't understand why it would have this texture. I would be up for some comments if anyone could understand why this did not turn out so good :(

Before you make this, visualize what it will taste like with the excess amount of chicken stock it calls for. This soup is not creamy.

Came out thinner than I expected. I added extra cream. Taste was so-so. I doubled the batch and didn't have enough chicken broth, so I put in vegetable broth. I think the latter added an unwanted flavor.

This is an easy to make, flavorful, soup.  If you'd like to make it ahead simple stop after pureeing the soup and store.  When ready to serve reheat the soup, add the cream, and wha-la!

This was bland and had a weird texture. Maybe it was because I used baked and mashed pumpkin instead of fresh, but no one liked this soup.

I had never had pumpkin soup before and decided to give it a try. Me and my boyfriend both enjoyed this soup. The pumpkin flavor is very subtle. The soup creamy and hearty. It's just a lot of work cutting up that pumpkin.

Oh yes, very simple & very tasty! The little dash of nutmeg at the end - as another reviewer suggested - was the perfect finish. Also used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream. I had white pumpkin frozen in packages, so it was easy, and instead of using the traditional blender I used my favorite kitchen tool, my hand blender, right in the pan, so clean-up was a breeze.

I love this soup!  I have altered it slightly to cut down on the fat and sodium by using 1% milk, and 4 cups of chicken stock/ 2 cups water.  This also due to having these items on hand.  I do add a bit of cayenne pepper.  It freezes great, so I pack up individual servings to take to work.  Perfect for cold Alaskan winter days!

This was wonderful. I did make a few changes. First, I added 5 cups pumpkin, 1 tsp ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon, and about 1 1/4 cups cream. It came out great. Finish with ground pepper and can't stop guzzling this out of a mug on a cold rainy day. Yum!

Really yummy soup with some additions.  I added several healthy shakes of nutmeg, roasted some pumpkins seeds for the top and drizzled with balsamic reduction. It was tasting a bit "pumpkiny" before the garnishes.

I found this recipe did not have much flavor - pumpkin or otherwise. For a nice, bland, creamy soup I guess it would be ok. I noticed a lot of reviewers said they did not really like pumpkin soup; I happen to be a huge fan and am always trying new recipes. This one could have used some harvest spices like allspice and a dash of cloves or some red pepper or curry powder - anything to give it some oomph. I won't be saving this one.

My husband and I made this for our Halloween party and everyone loved it. It was also great as leftovers. The only change we made was to use dried thyme instead of fresh. Even a guy who said he didn't like pumpkin liked this soup!

Really like this recipe for it's simplicity & wonderful result. This is what i call cooking. I did add 2 potatoes & 1 more cup of water as per earlier review even when i scaled down to a half portion because it was only for me & husband. Worked out fine.  Thanks for the recipe.
