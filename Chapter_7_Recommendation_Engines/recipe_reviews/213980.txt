Made the cups with a mixture of fruity pebbles and Rice Krispies. I found that if you cut a buch of pieces of waxed paper before starting helps. It is a must to mold cups. I filled my cups with my sons girlfriends favorite candies and made cute little signs. She just won a cheer leading competition and he crongeatulared her with the treats. It was a big hit. Worth the time it took.
