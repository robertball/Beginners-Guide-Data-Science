I marinated this all day in ranch dressing and think that made a big difference in the moistness and flavor of the chicken compared to other reviews. I didn't have cornmeal so after marinating, I scooped up the chicken with a lot of the sauce still on it and just rolled it in italian flavored breadcrumbs with parmesan per the recipe. I made this for my Dad (I don't eat meat) and he loved it. The baking time was great too. Crunchy on the outside, fairly juicy on the inside (might check it a few minutes earlier next time though) and he said it had a wonderful flavor. Plus how easy can you get! Pour on dressing, let sit, roll in bread crumbs, bake. No brainer. My photo doesn't do it justice. This was a good one, and definitely a keeper. Thanks very much Bearandy!!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, only adding more seasonings like Accent and Creole for a light kick. next time I think Im going to try marinading the chicken in the ranch for a few hours then baking. But it was easy, fairly fast, and the hubby and I enjoyed it :)

11.06.16 ~ I had four chicken thighs thawed, looking for a new recipe. This recipe fit that bill, nicely. I made as written, but did bake on a cooling rack placed on top of the cookie sheet. I wanted the bottom of the chicken to be crunchy. It worked, perfectly. This chicken was very moist with a nice outer crunch. Served it with a tossed salad and fried potatoes with green peppers, onions and jalape√±os.

I've made this chicken twice now and my husband loooves it. He says it is better than "wedding chicken". You definitely have to use chicken thighs, they make it really moist. I plan on making this whenever I have family visit :)

This was a pretty good recipe.  It was absolutely delicious with the chicken breasts, but not so much with the thighs for some reason.  If you are using flavored bread crumbs, I would eliminate the Italian seasoning.  It makes the spices over powering.

I was asked to make this again! It was really good. The only thing I did different was I only used breasts and I added an egg to the ranch dressing, just because I felt it would help the breading.

It was just average.  I marinated the chicken in the ranch dressing for 6 hrs.  I couldn't taste it at all. The chicken thighs were very moist, with a nice crispness.

Just tried this last night with skinless bone in chicken thighs and it is really good. Only thing I changed was that I laid each piece of chicken on a rack and pan so it drained when baking. Came out very crispy. Will try with boneless breasts soaking them overnight in dressing instead of three hours. So easy and so good.
Thanks again

Have cooked many versions of this recipe.  Sorry to say, this is not significantly different from any of the others.  Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special about it.

I did not have corn meal on hand at the time I made this. I used 2 tablespoons of Jiffy mix instead and it was fantastic! I will make again and just keep using jiffy mix.

This was very good and it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I did place the chicken on a rack, but I think it would have been just as crispy if I hadn't.

I marinated the chicken in the dressing for 24hrs.  I came home from work and pressed the chicken into Italian
seasoned breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. I only used chicken thighs.  Turned out amazing.  Family loved it.
Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Very yummy. I have made this twice. Once with boneless skinless chicken thighs and once with chicken breasts. Delicious and juicy. My family ate every piece I made. My measurements weren‚Äôt precise, but followed what seasonings were used. The second time I made this, with the breasts, I ran out of bread crumbs. I substituted about half with cornflake crumbs. That gave it extra crunchiness. Highly recommend. Simple and delicious. Thank you.

These were ok. I followed the instructions completely and I  soaked them in the ranch sauce for 10 minutes. The texture was great but the taste was very bland. If I do them again I will season them differently.

These turned out soo yummy! I followed the recipe pretty much as is, with the exception of marinating the chicken in the dressing for a few hours before baking. It was crispy, juicy, and not bland at all with just enough flavour.  I don't usually like Ranch dressing, but now, I won't mind my husband picking it up when we go shopping! Thanks for the great idea!

I used potato chips instead of the bread crumbs. Turned out well. It was simple and easy to make. All my kids gave it a two thumbs up.

I used packaged Italian-seasoned bread crumbs & skipped the cornmeal and Italian seasoning. Also, I saved washing a few extra dishes by putting ranch dressing onto each chicken piece, and spreading on both sides with a basting brush. Sprinkle the bread crumb mixture onto each side, place in pan and bake.

Found this recipe when I was looking for something to make with ingredients on hand and I will now put it in my regular rotation.  I didn't have the time to marinate it for too long but it was sealed in a plastic bag with the ranch dressing for probably an hour or so.  I didn't have Italian Seasoning but improvised by using dried basil, oregano, parsley and some garlic powder.  Turned out great and the chicken thighs were moist and tender.  Will definitely make it again.

This was just okay.  Our family ate the chicken, but all decided it was not worth making again.  It didn't crisp up in the oven, so it had a unappetizing appearance.  The flavor was blah. It was easy to make, that much can be said for this recipe.  I removed it from my favorite list.  No plans to make it again.

Pretty good but not the best, next time I think I'll try it with a little buffalo seasoning.

Not sure if I did something wrong but it was really soggy not crispy at all. I even put the chicken on a baking rack on top of the cookie sheet but then I had to broil both sides just so it wasn't spongy. My toddler ate it with ketchup but I didn't really like it. Maybe I had too much ranch dressing or something.

I also could not taste the ranch dressing in this recipe--big disappointment.  True, the chicken was very tender and moist, but without much flavor--even with the spices I added.  I don't believe I'll try this again, without alot more alterations.  So sorry.

I chose this recipe but my husband cooked it before I had the chance.  We used boneless chicken breasts instead if bone-in. He changed nothing about the recipe and these were sooo good he has made them several times since then. They were juicy and flavorful, in addition to being easy to make.
