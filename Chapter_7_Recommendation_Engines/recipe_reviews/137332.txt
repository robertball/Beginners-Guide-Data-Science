Absolutely delicious!!! I added an extra dollop of whipped cream since I like things really sweet. Also since I didn't have any espresso at hand, I substituted it with 1/4 cup boiling water added to 3/4 tsp of instant coffee (I halved the recipe). This latte was absolutely heavenly, plus it's so quick and easy to prepare! And you can make lots of variants to boot, by replacing the white chocolate with milk or dark chocolate or something else you'd like try. Make sure you chop up the chocolate well or it'll end up as melty lumps at the bottom of your mug.

This is definitely the perfect latte recipe :) !

Good.  It's easy to make and turns out really well.  I skipped some of the steps.  I just placed the choc. chips in the pan with the milk and they melted as I stirred.  Then I added vanilla, etc. and poured espresso in once it was ready.  It was a snap.  I tried reg. choc and my husband liked it even better.

I was surprised that this was really good! I made only one serving. I didn't have espresso and just used a strong brewed coffee. I have bakers real white chocolate in the cubard and one square equals 1 oz, or 2 Tblsp., making it easy to use. I didn't have heavy cream but had ff half and half in the house and subbed that. I topped it with whipped cream and white chocolate. What a treat, delicious!

yummy! very good! i left out the cream because i didn't have any (but def. would have used it if i had!) and used 1% milk. i took hot milk, the sugar, and vanilla and blended it in the blender until frothy instead of putting it on the stovetop. this is a wonderful recipe! thank you!

Delicious! I made this with regular chocolate chips and it was just as delicious. Also added a bit more cream to make it thicker and frothier.

I'm drinking this now as I type. I can not believe how good this is! I didn't have cream, just used milk 2% and didn't have espresso, just brewed strong Maxwell house. And still it's one of the best cups of 'coffee' I"ve ever had! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  A little sweet but good and EASY.  I only used whole milk, which was fine.  All the guests at my party thought this was pretty great.

I been dying to find more creative ways to drink my coffee and this is perfect!! I saw the recipe and fell in love with it and had to try it. It is probably the best coffee drink I have ever had! I did everything in the directions except after I added the vanilla and sugar to my frothy milk/cream mixture, I added the white chocolate chips in the sauce pan too and then poured it into my cup with espresso in it. It is heavenly! I sprinkled a little cocoa powder on top for decoration ;). I know what my new favorite drink is! You deserve 10 stars for this! I hope you make more delicious recipes!

This. was. amazing.! It was rich, creamy and frothy with the perfect balance of chocolate and coffee flavors. It definitely does not need the extra sugar. Just leave it out, the chocolate provides the perfect amount of sweetness. Regular chocolate chips would work just as well in this recipe too. If you don't have any espresso on hand just substitute regular, strong black coffee (a great way to use up leftover brewed coffee). I found that I didn't need to chop the chocolate chips. Just throw them in and whisk really well until it's all melted. It may take a couple seconds longer but that's not bad at all considering you don't have to spend that time chopping the chips up and dirtying a knife and chopping board. Just make sure the espresso/coffee isn't at boiling point. Top the latte with a dollop of vanilla whipped cream for the ultimate latte experience.

This latte is great!!! I double brewed my coffee using a regular coffee machine since I don't have an espresso machine and it works just fine. This recipe is a keeper :)

This is my husband's hands down favorite drink at Starbucks he loves it so much he will still get it during the summer, but Starbucks can be quite pricey on a Military members salary, so I made this for him along with a big breakfast on Veteran's Day, he was soo shocked it tasted exactly like Starbucks! Absolutely going to keep this in my recipe box!

Awesomeness! This turned out very well for me! I used two squares of Baker's White Chocolate, used homemade vanilla syrup in place of the pure vanilla extract and added some homemade whipped cream to the top. I can taste a hint of the white chocolate in this recipe, excellent, and highly recommended!

YUM! This was amazing and it sure woke me up this morning. It was easy to make (except for the cut up chocolate chips part) and definetaly worth the few minuites! But instead of white chocolate chips i used normal semi-sweet chocolate chips, added a little wipcream on top, and a dash of cinnamon to finish. If your bad at cooking or really good, this is still super easy to make.

I'm not a big coffee fan, but WoW! So rich and smooth. And I didn't even follow the directions to a T. I subbed Silk brand vanilla soy milk + heavy cream and Nescafe instant coffee. Yummers ;)

I used 2% milk and cream, semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. It was very yummy and my mom and I both loved it! Thanks!

Delicious! Added some hazelnut coffee creamer to the milk and it contrasted pretty well. This is a wonderful, rich, easy latte that I will now love forever.

Great ingredients. I do have an espresso machine so i brewed my espresso first then poured it into the mug, added chips, and instead of the vanilla and sugar, i just added a tbs. Of vanilla syrup (which is sugar dissolved into water with vanilla extract ), steamed the milk and cream together in a frothing pitcher then added it to the mug. Stirred it all up and put a cross cross pattern of chocolate syrup on top of the foam!! Yum!

This was really good.  I did things a little different as I was not totally reading the recipe.  I put the choc chips in the blender and chopped them all up, and put the milk (i used fat free) in the microwave to heat up.  I did not use cream, and used Starbucks Expresso.  I know this receipe  says it makes two servings but i drank both of them :)  It was very delish!

This was delicious!  I really don't like expresso so I expected it to be too strong.  The combination of sugar, milk, cream, vanilla and chocolate chips, it was perfect.  I drank all of it so I expect to be awake most of the night.   Totally worth it!

Oh my, this was sooo good!  I have never tried to make coffehouse drinks at home, but when I saw this recipe, I had to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I made one for me and one for my daughter and we both loved it.  You can adjust the sweetness or creaminess to your taste.  No need to chop the white choc chips.  I just put them into a cup and used my Keurig to brew a strong cup of coffee on top and they melted fine. Give it a try!

This was FABULOUS!!! I thought it was the perfect blend of coffee, cream and sweetness. And the great thing about this recipe is you can play with it and put a little more coffee or sugar. Whatever your in to. This will definitely be made over and over here. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not much for measuring so I just threw everything in the pan and whisked it together (minus the cream since I am out) but this is a fantastic latte.  A bit  on the sweet side, I could have left out the sugar, but still an excellent drink for a cold Wisconsin, winter night.

This was really good. I changed the serving size to 1. I used organic 0% milk and half&half in place of the heavy cream. I used 1 teaspoon of sugar (plenty sweet since the white chocolate is already sweet), and brewed regular coffee (hopefully I can find some espresso K cups!). I combined everything in a sauce pan (except coffee) and let it melt/combine. Then I poured it in my coffee cup with the coffee. So easy, and really good!

MMmmmmMmmmm.  So good.  Easy to modify too!   I added some banana flavouring and a big dollop of whipped cream (heavy whipping cream mixed with a bit of icing sugar and a touch of vanilla).  So good.

Im giving this 3 stars because although it was good, I didn't find it great. I had to add tons of white chocolate chips in order to give it the flavor, and it already had enough.  Probably for more of a basic coffee drinker, but I like my stuff a little sweet.

This was not as good as I expected. Too much milk, not enough espresso or white chocolate flavor. I melted the white chocolate chips with the milk, cream, and 2 packets of Splenda. Once it was simmering I added the vanilla and poured it into a coffee mug.  I then placed it in my  Ninja Coffee Bar for a layered latte.  If I ever make this again, I will try it with only 1 cup of milk.

I've made this numerous times, adding vanilla Torani syrup in place of vanilla extract. It's an excellent drink.

OMG, thank you so much for this recipe!!! I have an espresso machine with a steaming wand, so I used that to steam the milk and chocolate chips until they melted and the milk was nice and hot. I added a bit of Vanilla and then brewed two shots of espresso into my humongous mug! I didn't add any extra sugar, because I don't use it in regular coffee and didn't want the drink overly sweet. This is the perfect drink on such a cold day like today.

Pretty good. I made half the recipe,left out the sugar didnt think it would need it with the choc chips. I wish io was creamier I would prob add more cream(or half and half) and reduce the milk, just enough for the froth.

This is like liquid dessert! Veeery sweet. I liked the flavor, but I'm not sure I would make it again just because of how sweet it is. My sister tried a sip and made a face...she said it tastes like maple syrup. So, in summary...the sweetness factor took away from the good flavor. But I'm glad I tried it.
Three stars seems like too little for this, but four stars seemed like too much...so I just went with three. But let's say I rate it a 3 1/2. :)

I halved the recipe and used strong instant coffee and a little extra cream.  I found this WAY too sweet, and I love sweet!  I may play with this a little, and see if I can't get it to work for my taste.  Great idea, though..

This is great! I was a bit skeptical about the flavor and how trouble worthy it is to make at home... but this is it, the white mocha I've been craving! The espresso melts the white chocolate nicely and simmered milk is frothy. I'm going to adapt this to try make some milk tea too. One thing - 1 tbsp sugar is too much for me. With sweetened white choco chips, I'd do 1 tsp. Thanks for the recipe!

All hail Abbey! This is a dessert more than a drink. I made half the recipe and it gave me a full "latte" mug. I also made a child friendly version using orzo instead of coffee. Not too sweet, this has that white chocolate taste distinguishing it from the regular mocha coffee. Thank you hugatunity for making this for your sister and sharing it with us.

This sounds sooo good.  I unfortunately used coffee and bulk vanilla chunks.  It therefore only had a 3/5 result.  I bet with quality ingredients, it would be scrumptious..... Don't settle for less than the best. I will be making this again however!

Wow!  This is so good!  I literally just found this recipe, made it, and am back in my chair sipping it, in less than fifteen minutes.  I had already brewed really strong coffee since I planned on making a latte. I used less milk and more cream, to make up for it.  It eyeballed it, so I would say I used about 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream.  
Overall, very good taste and pretty simple to make.  Thanks for sharing!

I ended up having to modify it a lot to be able to taste the chocolate fully, which then made it way too sweet.  Probably coulda used less milk and more coffee to help prevent this. Over all it was pretty good, though, but not astounding. Probably won't be using it again. But it was nice to try.

This was so good!!! I can’t believe how smooth and creamy it was with how easy it was to make! I didn’t have any heavy cream on hand, so I used a little bit more milk and a bit of butter (I don’t know how much though >.

This is a coffeehouse drink you can make at home! Since I don't have an espresso machine, I added a Starbucks Via packet to 1/4 cup water (1 serving). I used mostly almond milk, added just a little half and half, and then added the amount of heavy whipping cream called for. I totally forgot to add the vanilla and the sugar, but it didn't seem to matter! The white chocolate chips made it plenty sweet for me. Such a great coffee treat!

Delicious! I used my Kureg coffee and doubled everything except the plain milk - this gave a little stronger flavor and made a little more. I also mixed it all in the pan at once - I was too impatient to wait! Anyway added cool whip on top and yummy!

Whoever said this deserves 10 stars is right!  I'm enjoying a cup right now and I can assure you that it's even BETTER than the overpriced coffee shop variety  (I think everything homemade is  tastier, personally).  I suggest subbing coconut oil for the cream (healthy and adds another layer of flavor) and topping with a sprinkle of powdered sugar (I never have whipped cream in the fridge).  I used my stick blender to whip the milk and white chocolate chips in the pan and poured it over my regular cup of coffee. From reading other reviews it's clear that this one can be tweaked easily with excellent results.  THANK YOU for creating my new addiction!  Now back to sipping...

I made this recipe without alterations and it wasn't an indulgent coffee.  Tastes like regular coffee with creamer, but with 5 minutes of extra work and triple the calories!  Also, I halved the recipe and it was still enough for two coffees.  To try and get the richness that was lacking, I tried adding an extra tablespoon of white chocolate chips.  That took away the decent coffee flavor and it became hot liquid white chocolate.  If you find yourself having made the same mistake, a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice saved the day.

Absolutely delicious! The whisking of the milk & cream substituted the steaming very well. I used 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of milk instead of espresso & it turned out well!

I have tried several recipes for white chocolate lattes and I can't seem to find one that tastes like the coffee shops. I've bought the white chocolate syrups and I find they have a chemical taste. This recipe on the other hand is great! I dont have an expresso machine so I just use double strength coffee. I passed this recipe to my sister and she loves it as well!
