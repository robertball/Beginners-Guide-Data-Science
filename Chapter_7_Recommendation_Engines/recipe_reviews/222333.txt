Excellent recipe as is. I chopped up 4 slices of bacon and sauted them until light brown. Used the rendered fat with less olive oil to saute the garlic and 1 chopped onion.  At the end I added 1.5 tbsp. red wine vinegar and 2 tsp. sugar.

This went over really well with my family.  I cooked my own beans instead of using canned.  My anchovy did not fully break apart so I would recommend mashing it some before adding it to the soup.  I would also recommend that you reduce the stock until you like the flavor as this will be the main part of the soup.  Not all stock has the same intensity.  My only real change is that I used spinach instead of escarole.  This soup came out great and I would make again.

"I grew up eating my family's escarole and beans but never wrote down a recipe. Sorry mom but this recipe is better than yours! I rarely say that! :-o) Do NOT omit the anchovies; they're included for flavor and you won't taste "anchovy" but you will taste wonderful rich, creamy deliciousness.  The only changes I made to this were to add sausage at the beginning before the garlic and to increase the anchovy fillets to three (yes, 3, try it, dare you to!).  Thanks Chef John! Amazing!

John

You have no idea how much you have improved meal time at our house. Your recipes are simple but profound and very delicious. I love anchovies but had some honey baked ham I had to use up, so that was my protein for this dish. I will use anchovies next time. Keep 'em coming. And thank you.

These are delicious!!  I didn't have an anchovy fillet so added an extra pinch of salt but it really didn't need it.  I added a big pinch of red pepper to while cooking and an additional pinch to the finished product and it was great!  served it with fresh French bread which was SOOOO yummy dipped in the juice.  will 100% be making this again...and again...and again :D

O.M.G. DELICIOUS!!! The best soup/stoup I've ever made. Only tweek was I added a small minced onion and cooked that with the garlic I minced as well (via the food processor) till onion was soft. When adding the anchovy mince for optimal distribution. I used homemade chicken stock and didn't want to waste the good chicken so I added some of that just because. This is now my #1 hearty soup recipe. Thanks Chef John. A winner in my book!

This is the most delicious greens recipe I have ever tasted. I am using turnip greens.  In the last month we have had it three times.  The lemon jest adds just the right amount of snap and the usual addition of bacon grease to greens is not missed. As Chef John says, you don't realize you haven't had meat.

Like someone else here said, she grew up eating this as a child and my
wife learned to make it from my mother. Well, sorry to say, both died and i never knew exactly how to make this. So thanks to Chef John for this
recipe, i made it and it tasted just like when i was a kid and when my wife used to make it. So, again Chef John, thank you.

Chef John I've enjoyed playing with this recipe! This time, I rendered nitrate free bacon.  After removing the bacon from the pan, I removed the fatty parts and chopped the lean pieces to add later.  I sauteed 1 yellow onion, 1 tsp curry powder and the garlic in the fat.  Once the onions were caramelized, I added Trader Joe's low sodium vegetable stock, seasonings and liquid smoke. After reducing per your recipe, I added the beans, a can of Glory seasoned collard greens I had on hand and some leftover (cooked) turkey meatballs.  The chopped bacon went into the pot in the final few minutes.  Yum! Talk about amazing flavor and pretty healthy to boot.

Loved this although I did modify it a bit to be totally vegitarian by leaving out the anchovy and using vegitable boullion instead of chicken. I needed a new way of using escarole instead of the traditional Dutch way of mashing it into hot potatoes. Another reviewer mentioned using turnip greens, I think this would also be wonderful with kale or even spinach.

We all liked this. I had turnip greens and no anchovies, but I will definitely make this again when I have anchovies.
Oct 2013 Second time making, this time using anchovy paste and escarole. I dunno about the rest of you, but it was a quest to find this veggie. I made as stated. After tasting I think more lemon peel and red pepper is in order.

This looked so simple I was expecting bland. But I am trying to eat healthier so I made it. I made it as written except I used vegetable broth. I also couldn't find Escarole so used a blend of baby kale amd Spinach. What a surprise. Lemony and a little bite from the pepper flakes. I will be making this again and again. Thanks again Chef John!

We love Chef John's recipes, and we have made this several times. So good and so easy! I use a very low sodium organic chicken broth, and rinse the beans well to remove any extra salt; otherwise I make it as directed (except the salt at the end), but I do put a bit of fresh Parmesan Reggiano grated with a microplane over the top instead. This also works with a flavorful veggie broth, and spinach in place of escarole.

This recipe is delicious and simple - love it! I really think letting the stock reduce adds a wonderful richness to the soup. I didn't dislike the lemon zest, but it was a bit strong for me. Next time I might leave it out and add a splash of red or white wine vinegar at the end instead. The anchovy, not surprisingly, added great flavor! But will someone please tell me what to do with the other anchovies!?!? They always seem to go to waste. Overall, this soup is definitely worth making and putting in your regular rotation of recipes.

Healthy, easy, inexpensive and versatile.  I have tons of spinach from my garden this year so that was the greens I used.  I say versatile because I had some leftover sautéed turkey italian sausage  that I used in place of one can of the beans.  Delicious!

I really loved this recipe and I'm sure it would've been wonderful as is.  However, I know that my hubby wouldn't have liked it without some kind of meat in it.  So, I just sauteed some turkey lite kielbasa right before putting the garlic in.  He ate two bowls!  Also, I served it with warm Naan bread (garlic flavor) for dipping. The kids even ate this.  If it seems a little too thick, just add a tad more broth.  Definitely a keeper!

Another winner from Chef John. No escarole on my trip to the store. Baby spinach turned out very nice. This is a simple and inexpensive recipe. Looking forward to experimenting with this one, thinking chard next time.

I grew up up with "beans and schkadal" as a staple. This the the grown up version with more complexity of flavor.  Perfect, healthful and soul satisfying as published.

This was a very satisfying soup with a great blend of flavors.  I couldn't find escarole, so I used kale.  I also used anchovy paste (1/2 tsp) instead of an anchovy filet.  Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  I thought about adding bacon, but decided to be healthy and leave it out.  I'm glad I did - bacon is not necessary to make this a delicious dish.  I served it with a pork tenderloin.  I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe as presented and thought it was excellent. I had two bowls late in the evening and was full but not uncomfortable. Nice light late night meal. I suppose you could add sausage or an egg if you are looking for a more hearty dish.

This is soo good. I made 1/2 a recipe but since i loved it I made the other 1/2 too. It is now in my refrigerator as I want something quick and easy for several days. Since my store does not carry escarole I used spinach. I used 4 cups total for the whole recipe

Make sure you don't overcook the escarole or use kale instead.  If you want to make it a main dish, add some store-bought rotisserie chicken (especially if they have garlic roasted) shredded.

This is easy to make and delicious.  The only changes I made were to use a bit of bacon fat with the olive oil. I also added onion with the garlic.  The fresh oregano and lemon zest add brightness and I used anchovy paste which added depth.  Wonderful!

Excellent recipe as written.Worth saving.. My own twists include, a just pinch of dried rosemary leaves ,thyme leaves,and dried basil instead of fresh oregano to 1 small  to medium onion diced. Then use fresh herbs at the end
I never used anchovies before, b/c I do not like them on pizza. However, I do agree with reviewer Alliegeekpi  that if you mash / mince them before adding in ,you will not have that fishy taste.....just more richness. The only direction change I use is to add the escarole in with the onion and herbs and briefly saute, so the escarole picks up more of the flavor.  Did not try the lemon, but may next time.I also add parm cheese and fresh herbs to taste during last few min of cooking ALWAYS serve with crusty bread....The kind with roasted garlic bake right into the bread is my personal favorite.
I am also submitting my own family recipe for Escarole &  White Bean Soup with  Italian Turkey Sausage.....Check it out if you are looking for a hearty quick meal,that also lends well to make ahead.

This was a pleasant surprise. I thought it was just be a plain bean soup but it was so much more. No escarole so I used bok choy and swiss chard and added more anchovie because I love them. My house stunk and my husband had no idea he was eating the fish. delish !

I've made this recipe exactly as written, and also experimented by substituting different greens. It always turns out beautifully.  It's a fast, easy, healthful weeknight supper. DO NOT SKIP THE ANCHOVY!!! It is essential to the flavor of the dish. Try with kale - our family favorite.

We loved this as a soup. The only changes that I made were due to my not wanting to go to the store. I soaked and then cooked the beans in the pressure cooker. I used Kale and a handful of mixed "Power Greens" from Costco. I used anchovy paste rather than a anchovy. I almost added a slice of bacon but I decided to trust Chef John and follow his recipe as closely as possible. This will definitely be a regular on our table. Thank you Chef John.

Used anchovy paste in place of an anchovy. I squeezed out a few inches of paste. Could not find escarole anywhere, used Sprout’s super greens blend with spinach, mizuna, chard, & kale.  It turned out fantastic! Did not need to add any salt as the anchovy paste provided plenty.  The lemon zest, paste & red pepper flakes made it super good

I didn't add the anchovy, oregano or lemon zest. I like old fashion Italian greens and beans. Reduced the chicken broth to just 2 cups. Sauted the beans in 5 tbsp EVOO with 6 cloves or more of chopped garlic. Added in the part of the broth, brought that to a simmer then added the escarole a little more EVOO and chopped garlic and the rest of the broth, 2 pinches of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. I also always have end pieces of the rind from Romano or parmigiano cheese so put that in while on simmer for the greens to finish cooking. This was AWESOME!!

I found this recipe on this site several years ago and have been making it ever since regularly. I use whatever greens I have on hand from the garden, and later the freezer chest: kale, chard, spinach beet, beet greens, turnip greens... I also, like some other reviewers, decided early on to add the chicken I used for making the broth, but only the back half, chopped, saving the breasts and freezing them to use in other recipes.  Other than this, I do use more anchovy than called for here, as I love the flavor. I use whatever dry white beans I can get my hands on, soaking them overnight and cooking them up in a big pot, about doubling the recipe here.  Wonderfully satisfying - and freezes well, too!

Delicious!! I am vegetarian, so no anchovy, but I substituted a strip of kombu seaweed for a salty/fishy taste, and it worked great! I added it in the same step as the anchovy was called for in the recipe, and removed it after the escarole was almost done wilting. (I also added some diced onion in the first step.) It was fast, filling and nutritious!! I will make this again, for sure.

Loved the recipe but also love to add some of my own ingredients from time to time.  I personally love Italian Sausage with my greens and beans so I skinned and crumbled/sauteed ~ 1/2# sausage first, removed it then left the drippings in the pot.  I eyeballed about how much additional olive oil I'd need to get to 2 TBSP. From there I followed the recipe EXCEPT added some leftover white wine (sweet, Moscato, ~ 1/2 cup) to the chicken stock before reducing by 1/2.  I followed the recipe to the "T" from there and added the sausage back to the pot to simmer before adding the greens.  LOVED IT!!!

Hands down, the best ever beans and greens I have ever made.  I try not to modify recipes that I find but I can't do anchovy so I omitted it.  Also, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken since I served it with Italian sausage.  Didn't want the tastes to clash. Lastly, I've been putting turmeric in just about all my soups lately and so added about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of it.  Excellent dish, I want to make it again very soon

No Changes. Creamy garlicky goodness. Family raved over it. Do make sure you spin the greens as they will dilute the delicious creamy sauce if you don't.

I love this!  I used anchovy paste.  I made this for a dinner party of lamb shank as a starting course.  I made a salad for those who questioned the idea of "lettuce soup" those who opted for salad quickly regretted it after the yummy noises they heard from the other guests who tried it.  It is a great starter for a heavy/rich lamb meal.  The salt of the anchovy and the crunch of the greens create a light and beautiful starter.

wow!!   Chef John, once again a winner. so light yet hearty.  I did double the amount of broth using 1 chicken and 1 veggie and used only 1/2 head escarole while adding 3 small back choys. I also used   1/2 tsp of colitura di alici (Italian fish sauce)  instead of anchovies but that's all.  Awesome with a crusty piece of ciabatta.

This was not bad but not great either. Both my husband and I thought so. Will try another recipe.

I was trying to duplicate this recipe from a local restaurant that I enjoy. Here are some of my changes. I cut the chicken broth in half. I added 1 small onion, increased the red pepper flakes to 1/2-1 tsp. but the most important change was I added 2-4 T of Parmesan cheese to the beans and greens and sprinkled more before serving.  Just as good as my local restaurant!!

On the fly while in the grocery store I looked up recipes that had beans in them and I came across this recipe. The narrator wasnt kidding about this being an easy and hearty meal. The parm crisp add this delish dish that extra wow! The store disnt seel escarole so I subbed in baby spinach. A great dish.

I fry up some panchetta and the insides of one link  of Italian sausage before continuing with the recipe. I omit the anchovy and use whatever greens I have on hand (usually kale). Excellent.

Sooooo favorable and delish!! Don't reduce too far down, like I did,  or you will be adding more chicken broth. Serve in a shallow bowl, like in the picture, or it will be runny.

These were the best beans & greens I've ever had! I cooked a few strips of bacon, chopped it, used the fat with a little olive oil to cook the veggies in, and left out the anchovies.  

It turned out great. Will absolutely make over & over again!

Seriously awesome!  I substituted brussel sprout greens and a can of red kidney beans because that's what I had. Will definitely make this again... And again.

Hands down one of my favorite meals. I don't know what escarole is and can't get it at my regular grocery store, so I just use arugula. The kid get's her serving before the greens are added and she loves it too.  Only problem. . .there is never enough!

Very good. I liked the citrus flavor. I didn't chop the escarole small enough. I added the juice of a half of lemon at the end when I added the escarole

Not bad for escarole and beans!

This isn't a dish I would normally make, but since I saw Chef John's name on this recipe, I figured I'd try it.

Made recipe as written, and as shown on the video.  Recipe was easy to make.  I found it to have a little too much garlic for my pallet, but otherwise, it tasted OK.  Froze some of it, and, when reheated, taste was also OK.

If I make it again, I'll reduce the garlic, and I may skip the anchovy.

Son came back from college a vegetarian.  Found this recipe. We ALL loved it! Cooked  verbatum, except the anchovie.  I've made it several times now, and our local grocery store seems to have better and better selections of escarole.  Maybe I'm not the only one who found it?
