Real creamy and delicious! I was surprised that this was so good! I only used one avocado and had to add more milk to get the blender moving, and it still came out very thick. I also found that for my tastes, it needed a little more sugar. Good way to use up those very ripe avocados! Thanks for the idea.

Surprisingly good flavor with a thick milkshake texture.
