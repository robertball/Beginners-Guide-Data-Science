I added the Lobster chunks into the skillet then I loaded up the two boats..Absolutely delicious..And plenty cheesy...Defintely will make many times. Thanks Chef John. 
By the way, after going through the reviews  concerning Chef Johns Lobster Mac and Cheese, and people had the nerve to completely tweak Chefs recipe, and then only give it 3-4 Stars? Don't understand..
So basically you change the recipe, like using Crab Meat versus Lobster, and then you give it 2 -4 stars..People give me a break..

I loved this recipe and I am a huge Chef John fan. I'm not a chef by any means but I do love to cook. One concern I had with this recipe was the lack of lobster throughout the dish. The second time I made this dish I used a little more lobster and mixed it into the mac and cheese. In my totally unprofessional and extremely humble opinion the changes I made improved the dish. But I realize everyone's palate and style is different. It just didn't make sense in my mind to have all the lobster on top of,  and none throughout, the dish.

Excellent recipe!  Nice flavor!  I made a couple adjustments along the way; I used half n half instead of milk and I added an extra 1/4 cup to ensure the pasta didnt get too dry.  I didn't put it in small dishes to bake, just put it in a large Pirex dish.  I also doubled the panko/parmesan topping to cover the entire dish.  I will definitely make this again but am going to try it with crab next time.

I love this classic! Especially appreciated the tip on adjusting the vollume of pasta to customize the creaminess of the sauce!! I've been trying to get a creamier texture for years and I have been going about it all wrong! Thanks John!!!

Always turns out perfectly. Nice balance of mild spices to balance out the creamy cheese sauce and keep it from being bland. Don't skimp, go with a nice greyure cheese in the cheese blend if you can. Photo taken before baking)

Could not find gruyere at the grocery store (don't shop on Christmas eve...) so substituted havarti. Not a great substitution, the sauce was yummy but the texture was not creamy. Otherwise a total success, easy to prepare, spectacular and delicious. Putting the lobster shells in the pasta water was a great technique, gave the pasta a subtle lobster taste and aroma.

I didn't make any changes and it came out delicious! I'm a huge Chef John fan so I'm not surprised. Since I had never cooked lobster before, it definitely helped to watch the video first.

Doubled the recipe for me and my 3 kids. They pretty much licked the pan clean. Weren't even done and were asking if I could make a second pan so we'd have leftovers for the next day!! Will make again!

Of course I used boxed Kraft Mac and cheese deluxe and used all lobster instructions, tips, topping parts of the recipe. Love Chef John.  Adding the lobster shells to the water while cooking the elbow macaroni was incredible.  Would have never thought to do that.

The only change I made was using sharp cheddar instead of white and Conchiglie pasta. We had it for Christmas and nobody wanted to eat anything else but this. It was fabulous!

Chef John does it again!  Another 5 Star recipe!  This was delicious & a huge hit last night at NYE party!  I doubled and put in larger dish & a little extra on the red pepper,  but other than that, changed nothing.  Stick to this recipe, you won’t regret it.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this for Xmas Eve dinner to accompany beef tenderloin to give my vegetarian daughter in law a nice option for her meal.  Made w crab instead of lobster because that's what my family prefers.  Doubled the recipe and baked in 9X13 pan.  Made earlier in the day, refrigerated and had oven ready when we came home from church.  Advice should be heeded to make sure it's saucy enough.  I added more milk to make saucier after i turned into baking dish because didn't look saucy enough and was very glad i did.  Wish I had taken a picture.  Breadcrumbs browned beautifully.  It was a delicious, beautifully presented dish.  Will definitely make again!

I sautéed the lobster until about half done and then added it directly to the cheese mixture. It finished cooking as the recipe cooked to perfection. I used larger pieces of lobster because the last time I chopped the lobster and it came out overdone.

I thought this was very easy to make and my family enjoyed it. I used crab meat instead of lobster and just tossed in a full pound at the every end. I also doubled the recipe and put it in one 13x9 dish. I accidentally used 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of paprika so mine turned out extra spicy but that didn't seem to bother anyone. They really liked it. I will make it again.

I had high expectations for this recipe. I went to our local lobsterman, a guy from Maine who knows lobster like few others (outside coastal Maine, of.course). While I waited, he steamed up, cracked and picked some fresh lobster meat for me. I folded it into the mac & cheese, and baked it, according to the recipe. Now, it was good, but it was not wonderful, befitting the fresh lobster meat that went into it. Suffice it to say, I will not waste any more lobster meat, nor foul up any more mac &  cheese, by putting them together. Each is wonderful, in its own realm, but the two are not meant for each other, in my humble opinion.

I had crawfish in the freezer and decided to try this recipe.  Since it was snowing and I didn't want to go shop, I used yellow sharp cheddar instead of the white.  All other ingredients remained the same.  L Ike some others who made this, I mixed in the seafood and baked it in one small casserole pan.  SO GOOD!!  Don't be afraid to experiment...You would have to go really wrong to make this a bad dish!

Oh, this was superb! I had quite a bit of lobster that my kids brought down from Boston, so needed to find a way to eat it before it went bad. 
I had no idea that mac and cheese would be enhanced so much by lobster!  It was absolutely delicious when I first made it and I wasn't sure how it would hold up on subsequent days, but it was still delicious!! I will definitely make it again, either when I go home to Boston, or when my thoughtful kids load up their car with shrimp, lobster, and scallops and take a trip to see their and dad and me.

This is probably my most-made of Chef John's recipes-- because even without the lobster, it's the best mac and cheese recipe I've ever tried. Not too heavy, not boring but still comforting--and no one I've ever fed it to has even *tried* to break out the ketchup. Amazing all around.

We made some changes out of necessity. For example, we made one medium glass dish of the macaroni and cheese rather than 2 small ramekins. Also, we had purchased ( on sale) already steamed and shelled lobster meat, so I cut the lobster meat into small chunks and buried it in the macaroni before baking the mac 'n cheese in the oven. I used a combination of Gruyere and Manchego cheese. Other than that, we made the recipe as directed. Baked for about 15-18 minutes and it was very cheesy and delicious. Thanks Chef John, for a great recipe!

It is phenomenal- I liked the tricks of the recipe like underpinning the lobster so it doesn't dry out during baking, and I never mixed melted butter tin with my panko before applying. No wonder it was always so dry in the past! Cooking times were spot on, and it was enough to fill 3 good sized ramekins for us. I did have to sub normal sharp cheddar for the white cheddar, and we had a nice creamy wine flavored cheese to sub for gruyere. Used all spices as called for, and flavor was spot on. Much better than the bland Lob Mac usually served in restaurants

I made this recipe pretty well as stated. I used a single dish to bake it in which worked out fine. The crumb mixture was a real success.

Loved this recipe - very easy to make and turned out great!  We used medium shells instead of elbow macaroni so we needed about 1.5 cups of dry pasta, but everything else was the same.  Will definitely make again!

This will be my second time making this dish. The first time was amazing. The family loved it. I could’ve stop eating this dish until it was all gone. No leftovers with this meal.

The flavour was nice and cheesy, the Atlantic lobster was juicy and sweet..a perfect not no Valentine creation on a sunny fall day. Make it as is people and DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING! Thank you chef John another WINNER indeed!

This recipe is a lot of work. It was just okay. But I think that’s because I’m a bad cook. Not the recipe. I won’t be making it again because it was a lot of work.

Great recipe although I may have to adjust how long I bake it for, I managed to dry it out just a little but it was still great

I followed his recipe EXACTLY.
I'm getting a bit of flavor that just doesn't compliment the ingredients.
I think it's the worchestershire. Which I normally love.
I think I will do a bit more searching for a better lobster mac recipe.
I was underwhewlmed.
