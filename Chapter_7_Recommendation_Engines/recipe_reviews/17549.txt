I made this for my husband's birthday, omitting the white chocolate chips.  He absolutely loved it!  (so did I!)

I have never seen my son's girlfriend eat an entire slice of cake...until now!! She's very petite and mindful of calories. Well, let this review serve as a warning. This cake will break down your will power...but what a way to go!! Perfection on a plate.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding fresh peel of one orange, grated. Try it, you'll like it!!

Great cake and so easy to prepare.  For easy pan removal, grease and flour pan and allow cake to cool in pan at least 45 minutes before removing it.  Can also add a glaze when cake has cooled for a beautiful presentation.  Cake is done when it springs back to the touch.  Texture was perfect.

This cake is awesome! I've made it a few times and it's gotten rave reviews every time. It is very moist, has a great flavor and is extremely easy to make. No need for icing -- just dust with some powdered sugar. Delicious!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It looked great until about 10 min. after I took it out of the oven to cool. It fell flat, would not come out of pan and tore into several pieces.  Maybe I did something wrong.  It seems to me 2 cups sour cream is a lot but the taste is ok but it looks terrible.

Yummy - I made it twice in two weeks. I used the vanila pudding but use semi sweet chocolate chips and a little orange zest.  In the glaze I used cointreau and orange extract to give a bigger orange flavor.

This cake is awesome!  What wonderful flavor and nice and moist.  I made it for my husbands birthday and everyone loved it.  Instead of the icing sugar, I put on dream whip with orange flavoring and then sprinkled more white chocolate chips on top.  Nice presentation.  Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

I love this cake!  I've made this recipe twice now, once for a work luncheon & once for a family gathering.  Both times I got rave reviews and was asked for the recipe.  This is one of those great flavorful & moist cakes that needs no icing.  I'm going to try this recipe with Midori Melon liqueur next time I make it.

Fabulous!  My cranky but cute 1934 Gaffers & Sattler gas oven makes baking a challenge, and I'm not a great baker anyway, but this turned out like a dream.  I baked it longer because the oven is slow, but it turned out moist, rich and delicious.  I couldn't taste the orange, but others could.  Next time I'll add zest.  Because I was making this for guests with small children, I substituted orange juice for the orange liqueur.  I can't believe I baked anything this good!

The easiest cake I've ever made! It is simply
delicious and my friends and family love it.
It really looks pretty when cooked in a decorative bundt pan.

Gorgeous light moist cake...I did change the ingredients a little.  I used a Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix, sugar free Vanilla pudding mix.  I used apple sauce in place of the vegetable oil, and used a mixture of Orange Juice and Orange Liqueur (I thought my very strong liqueur would be too much). Also added 2 drops of red and 2 drops of yellow food colouring to help to bring out an orange colour.

Always a hit at baby showers and parties!  I usually omit the white chocolate chips and I love to serve it frosted with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" found here on allrecipes.  It is also delicious with glazed fruit on top of the frosting as well.  Every time I serve this I am always asked for the recipe and it receives MANY compliments!

the cake turned out well, it's easy and quick enough. I didn't use orange liqueur but an almond one. Only, the white choc chunks disappeared when cooked, so you coundn't detect them. I'll try with something in the batter that remains...

Absolutely Fabulous- Easy to make.  I brought it to work- and was gone in no time- had to share the recipe.   I made a powered sugar glaze with a bit of orange juice added for taste. MMMM- GOOD!

Excellent! I made this recipe and what a wonderful recipe it is. Although, I made the mistake of putting in the sugar in the cake mix, but it turned out really great. My whole family loves it. Definitely a new favorite.

For the chocolate lover, replace the cake mix and pudding with chocolate, along with making the white chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate. For a glaze, I melted chocolate chips and orange liquor, poked holes in the cake, and drizzled the chocolate sauce over the cake. If you like chocolate, you'd love this cake...very moist and rich even without the sauce. My aunt, the chocoholic in the family absolutely loved it.

I took this cake to work today as a planned contrast to the excess of chocolate we always have.  It was a hit!  The only cake mix I found at the store had "double pudding" added so that's what I used.  Granted, it was moist, but I predicted that.  Also, I warmed a tub of vanilla frosting and added a touch of orange extract and poured over--wonderful addition!  This one is a keeper!

Followed the directions.  Perfect end to a nice meal.  Guests loved it.  Served with (Ben & Jerry's recipe) homemade orange dreamsicle icecream  Next time will go with a different flavor icecream--something nutty.  The orange's were so complementary.

I tried this recipe twice because the cake came out dense and looked uncooked the first time, but the flavor was good and you can taste the orange liqueur.  Still came out dense the second time even with additional cooking time.  Maybe because it's too moist?

This cake is absolutely fantastic.  It is so easy to prepare, and the results are heavenly.  It is rich and decadent, a real treat.  I always make it for company.  It doesn't need frosting, just a little powdered sugar.  YUMMY!

I made this, mostly following the recipe, but tweaking it just a bit.  Because some reviewers didn’t think this had much orange flavor, I added the zest of one orange and a generous 1/2 t. of orange extract.  That did the trick!  I meant to dust the white chocolate chips with flour to prevent them from sinking, but I forgot.  No problem, the chips disappear into the cake and they’re not at all visible once the cake is baked.  This cake is nice and moist, and mine had great orange flavor.

My husband and I love this cake. I've made it at least ten times in the last year. I omit the white chocolate chips and make an orange buttercream frosting to top it with. Great recipe!

Wonderful! And yes, two cups of sour cream is correct. (I was a little worried about the amount, before baking). Moist, rich and no need for frosting or glaze (unless you REALLY wanna gild the lily!) Oh, yeah...easy, too Thanks for this lovely recipe!

The taste was great. Only substitution that I made was to use orange juice instead of liqueur and the zest of one orange. But I think all of my white chocolate chips sank to the bottom and melted there. Like I said, it tasted good but looked kinda weird and the melted chips made it seem like it was not done even after the hour cook time.

This was ok.  I subbed the liquer for orange juice and added orange extract.  It could've used some orange zest too since it's very vanilla-y (orange was hard to detect).  I skipped the white chocolate since I didn't have any, but it still tastes a lot like yellow cake mix.

This cake smells amazing, and is delicious! Served to kids and adults and everyone had a second slice! It is so easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly, I would recommend having the sour cream be more room temperature as opposed to cold, combined with the pudding it begins to set up fast.  Stirred Orange zest into 4 Tbsp Vanilla frosting and let it melt over the top of the cake to glaze it.

This was super easy and really moist and delicious.  I omitted the chocolate chips and added the zest of one orange. I made a glaze of melted white chocolate, juice of one orange and chopped walnuts and drizzled on top.  It added a little sweetness, but looked fancy.

A great cake.  I have made it several times and carried it to work.  Folks just love it.  Very moist.  I did substitute orange juice for the water which worked just fine.   Yummy!

Fabulous indeed, both by taste and ease of preparation. There is one remark, though: I kept testing for doneness with a toothpick and I had to keep the cake in the oven a lot more than the recipe indicated. As a result, when I turned out the cake onto a wire rack I noticed that in a lot of places on its surface the white chocolate chips had been turned to coal. I don't know how one could prevent this... Oh, and the chips I used were white choco chips mixed with macadamia pieces. Wonderful cake.

This was a supremely moist cake and easy to prepare but I didn't taste the orange.   I used cream cheese frosting with grand marnier mixed in the frosting as well as the cake. 
People at work said I outdid myself but that they didn't taste the orange either.
I might try orange zest next time.

I really liked the texture of this cake.  Bundt cakes to me always seem so dry but this one is nice and moist on the inside.  I used the chocolate cake mix and also the chocolate pudding.  I then used the mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  I only gave it a 4 star rating because even though I used grand marnier I still did not taste the orange in the recipe.  Next time Im going to add some orange oil or perhaps some orange zest.

I made this as mini-cupcakes instead of cakes, and chopped up the chips so they weren't overwhelming. The cake is extremely moist, and I would reccommend no icing or topping at all, just serve hot with vanilla ice cream to complement the flavors. Also, I put a whipped cream cheese frosting on half and a fluffy, mild chocolate frosting on the other half of the cupcakes, and everyone enjoyed both variations. However, I did make a change to the recipe as I could not get Liqueur; I just substituted an equal amount of unsweetened orange juice concentrate, plus 1/4t orange extract for a little extra orange.

I loved this cake. I used Grand Marnier orange liqour which is the best!
The white chocolate chip??? Hmmm, I used them, but not sure If I would like it better with or without.

I made this cake yesterday - I added orange rind, used the Peach Schnapps, but didn't have white choco chips.
How delicious - it will be a definite 'do again'
Thank you

Delicious.  Left out the white chocolate chips, used oj concentrate instead of liquor, added the zest of an orange and a tsp of orange extract to the cake batter.  Frosted with a chocolate buttercream. Hubby and daughter loved it!

Devoured by dinner guests who helped themselves to seconds!    This cake is fast to make and truly fabulous.  Cake appears yellow when cut, so bring out the orange with drop of orange food colouring if desired.

Awesome recipe but not a very bold orange flavor.! Will definitely add to my arsenal. I did sprinkle some crushed pecans on top and added a white chocolate glaze with a hint of orange extract. This recipe should have way more hits.

This is my go to cake by family request.  Make it exactly as the recipe states and it is perfect every time.  For a topping I have used a chocolate glaze, powdered sugar and a vanilla icing.  All are excellent.
