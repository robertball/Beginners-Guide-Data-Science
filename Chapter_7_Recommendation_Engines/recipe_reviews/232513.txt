Just what I was looking for.  Made the asparagus and dressing about 4 hours before serving.  Added the dressing and cheese to the asparagus just when serving.  Have to watch the asparagus to see when it's done right but it kept in the refrigerator staying crisp/ tender and brightly colored.  My guests loved the dressing and cheese,  I served this with Beer Boiled shrimp and they were dipping their shrimp in the extra dressing on their plates,  Thanks!

Tasty! Easy to make and a healthy change from regular tossed salad. I did screw up  and added the zest to the dressing. Didn't  hurt it though!  Next time I made it, I tried it with blue cheese  crumbles and we liked that just as much.
