This recipe was wonderful and super easy to make.  Hubby and kids loved it and really only took minutes to make.  I did however add alittle more chili powder and brown sugar the second time for a little more zip and to make some extra "juice"  the juice is where this alot of flavor and we really liked it poured over the chops.  I've already made this twice.

I thought these chops were delicious, and the kids loved them too! I omitted a bit of the brown sugar because of some of the reviews, but I wish I hadn't. I thought they would have been even better with it! Don't change a thing, try it first and see what you like. Oh and I grilled them only because I had the grill going. They were still great!

These were great! The only thing I changed was that I added garlic powder, but I add garlic to everything! My son who is a very picky eater and not fond of Pork Chops, said he gave these a 4.5 out of 5. This is one I will do again thank you!

These were the best pork chops I've ever had. So good! I plan on making them again with a little more spiciness. They were a little sweet for my taste, but still, the best chops I've ever had. Husband and kids loved them as well.

The only changes I made to the recipe were to brine my chops first (to ensure a tender, juicy chop) then I rinsed them & patted them dry & followed the recipe. I topped them w/ Caramelized Onions & Bacon & served them w/ a summer blend of frozen veggies. Loved them...thanks!

This is my favorite pork recipe!  It's so easy to throw together and the results are wonderful! Thank you Lisa for such a yummy recipe!  The only thing I've changed is to add a dash or two of garlic powder to the rub and omit the chili powder b/c of the little ones.  A tip I learned the first time I made these is to do all the chops at once if you can.  The sugar will burn if it sets on the heat too long...lol...

This came out pretty good - moist and tasty, but the brown sugar seemed to overpower the other flavors. (I used cilantro and cumin instead). Next time I'd use less brown sugar to cut the sweetness.

Just be sure not to have your pan too hot. The coating will turn to candy with all the sugar!  Otherwise this is the perfect pork chop recipe!

It's hard to find a good recipe for pork chops that satisfy everyone, but this one did it. I didn't change a thing and will use this over and over as it was absolutely fabulous! Great meld of flavors.

Tasty---more sweet than spicy. Increase chili powder and reduce cook time to 5-6 minutes a side.

This recipe was quite the tasty treat!  I didn't have chili powder so I used 1-tsp cajon seasoning instead (and, I didn't use salt).  I seared the chops 2min on each side and then I put the lid on the skillet and cooked it for another 3-4min.  They turned out so moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. We put ours on the grill so they weren't too sweet since a lot of the sugar was burned off. I'll definitely make these again.

All I have to say is...wow! This recipe is great for wanting to try something new with your standard old chops! I made this for my fiance and myself and it turned out superb. Of course, being me, I had to put a little twist on things. I left the original recipe as was, but before putting the basil rub on, I coated the chops with my own sea-seasoned salt and a bit of black pepper to give it a bit of balance to the sweetness of the brown sugar. Also, I stuffed those bad boys with some homemade stuffing, but before I did I put the basil rub on the inside of the pouch to give it a bit more flavor. Cooked on each side for about eight minutes and they looked and smelled divine.

I must say, this was one of the most savory pork chops I've ever had. It was sweet, but not overpowering, and it was just all around fantastic for anyone looking to make a quick meal with a bit more of a kick than usual. Fantastic!

This is a keeper! The whole family loved it, and it was so easy.  I did season the chops with garlic powder first and then made the recipe as is. It was delicious!! I think next time I will add more brown sugar and bit more chili powder to make it more robust, but it tastes great if you follow the directions as is. Thanks for sharing an easy, delicious weeknight recipe!

I think this name is kind of misleading...I couldn't taste the basil or chili powder at all...only the brown sugar, which kind of burned on top of the pork. But it tasted good anyway :)

Not a lot of flavor and I even added more chili powder.  The sugar burned quickly, even at a low temp.

I really enjoyed this and what a fast, delicious weeknight meal!!  I think anyone would be making a big mistake cutting back on the sugar as it's intended to help glaze the chop and most of it gets left in the bottom of the pan, anyway.  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I served them with roasted red potatoes and fresh green beans.  Fabulous meal!

quick prep time is great and has pretty good flavor.  Used olive oil, but didn't run into the sweetness that a lot of people talked about when  Cooking with a cast iron skillet on the stove. I Might add some more spicyness next time, but overall a good quick meal.

Pretty good recipe.  More of a sweet flavor than salty.  I marinated for two days and pork chops turned out very tender after we cooked them on the grill

Really great taste! One of the best pork chop recipes i've made.  Used thick boneless chops which are normally dry!  I browned them in a pan and then let them cook for another 10 mins in the oven at 375.  After taking the pork out of the pan, i threw in some onions and they carmelized wonderfuly in the pan juices! Definitely recommend that. Also used olive oil in pan & rub instead of vegetable oil.

My husband and I love this savory rub and use it on porkchops and chicken breast. I want to try it on grilled ribeyes as well. Made this with homemade mashed potatoes and used remaining drippings in my fry pan for a gravy on the potatoes...yum!

Made these for the 1st time for my family last night, and they were scrumptious! I used thin pork loin chops.  I should have cut the cooking time down, but I live and I learn.  The taste was yummy, even my 17 month daughter liked it!!! Next time I think I will add a dash of cayenne and a little more chili powder, to add a little more kick.  Thanks for sharing Lisa!!!

YUM!!! My husband and I really enjoyed this dish!! I did not have any Chili powder or cayenne/cumin powder to use to make my own chili powder. So I used the smoky maple McCormick spice mixed with Oregano and Basil and the brown sugar. mmm mmm good! I loved the sweetness! Served with homemade Sweet Potato chips and broccoli.

a hit!!!  and so easy!!!! the brown sugar makes a nice caramelization on the chops.  Also, it is fine to use thin pork chops as long as they are not over-cooked.  The good thing is it is hard to overcook them because the brown sugar will start to burn.  Also, splenda brown sugar blend works well here.

Quick and easy--- and tasty too!!!  I wanted to broil them, so followed the recipe exactly except put them in the oven on broil about 4 inches from the top for 5 minutes each side (4-7 min depending on oven and thickness).  They were tasty--- and I didnt change any ingredients.

Excellent tasty pork dish!  I followed the instructions as followed and it turned out great.  I would however reduce the amount of brown sugar by 1/3 or even by half to reduce a bit the amount of sweetness and to accentuate the taste of the chili and basil.  May I suggest to include cumin to the mix or replace the basil with cumin or even include fresh mushrooms to the mix although this is not a must.  It's tasty as is.

This recipe is phenomenal! I dreamt about these pork chops the night I cooked them...they were so tasty! The only thing I did differently was that I used Rapadura instead of brown sugar. I let them carmelize in the pan because the ones I made that way were much tastier than the ones that weren't carmelized. Extremely simple and so quick, this recipe is being added to my "go-to" list.

A very good recipe for one with a sweet tooth, but not for my taste. I am more of a spicy person when it comes to meat, so I didn't really enjoy it as much as other recipes. But if you don't mind the sweet taste, this is for you.

We didn't care for this.  Maybe it is just personal taste, but this seemed to have way too much basil.  I don't think I will make it again.

Really good taste - juicy and flavorful.  No advanced marinating required, which is a great time saver.  I might try grilling chops next time.

My husband made these last night while I was at work and even re-heated, these were so good.  My younger fussy daughter who usually is the last one to finish eating, was the first!  We will be making these again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made the recipe exactly as stated, but grilled the chops because it's that season. Juicy, sweet, crispy, and with a little kick---not too much. This was amazingly fast to prepare and cook. I was surprised that it tasted so good!!

I've been cooking pork chops for over 20 years.  This recipe is by far the best I've ever run into.  I don't think you can find an easier pork chop recipe either.

I thought this was great.  Pork was very tender. I'd rate the taste as 4.5 and ease as 5.5 so that makes a 5.  Made as written and thought the sauce was not sweet-just right.  Used my fingers to pat the coating.  I did add a small onion cut in half and then sliced very thin and thought it added something to the dish.  I think you could add mushrooms, too.  The base recipe is fine, though.  It is great to have something quick and good for weeknight dinner.  Thanks!

We liked this recipe; it reminded me a little bit of a teriyaki sauce in flavor. I thought it would have a little more kick to it, but it was predominantly sweet in flavor. Very easy to make for a weeknight dinner.

Loved these chops and also decreased the sugar a little and added some granulated garlic.  Do heed the warnings not to get skillet too hot.  I got them a little too dark but will watch better next time....there will be a next time.

LOVED these...I used pork chops that had the bones so my cook time was longer but I still didn't get the burnt coating like some of the other reviews have been. I used olive oil instead of vegetable. I also didn't have chili powder so I substituted cumin, cayenne pepper, and oregano.

Wow!  I should give this 5 stars for simplicity and flavor, but I felt there was something missing.  I am not quite sure what it is yet.  Aside from that, this is a great recipe and my kids LOVED it, as I did too.  I cooked it with rice and corn.  I followed the recipe exactly (well, I always eye my seasonings as I pretty much know how much a teaspon looks like now, lol).  Thank you for the recipe.  When I figure out what I think was missing, I will update, but for now, excellent recipe!

This was great. I did up the seasoning in the mix by about a half a tsp each. I'm slightly obsessed with spices. I didn't add the oil but I did coat my chops and let them marinate in the fridge for about 3 hours. The sauce after it cooked was perfect addition. thanks for sharing!

These were amazing!! A new favorite in our house! The brown sugar really made a great glaze and gave the perfect amount of a sweet flavor. Next time we will use little more chili powder for more of a kick and not so much oil in the pan.

I made this for my husband and he loved it! I don't usually care for pork chops but these were good.

I didn't change up the recipe at all. Although If you like a sweeter taste then I'd suggest adding more brown sugar (I found the sweetness to be slight) and if you like a little more spice then I'd suggest adding hot pepper because there isn't a spicy kick to it.

These were pretty good, was nice to have something different.  Little too heavy on the basil for my tastes, I give it 3.5 stars.  BF really liked it though, and he's fussy, 4 stars for him.  The brown sugar and chili powder worked great on pork.  Will make again with just a little less basil.  Also, as others have suggested, will try adding a little garlic.

I made these last night, as I wanted something different than the typical breaded/mushroom pork chops and they were DELICIOUS.   The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and these were by far the best pork chops I had ever eaten.

I couldn't believe how good this was. I used pork loin cutlets, which made the cooking time a little shorter. The brown sugar caramelized and the seasonings worked so well together. Whole family loved it!

These chops have become one of my families favorites. They taste great grilling them or baking them as well. Thank you Lisa!

The chops cooked up nice and moist.  The sauce was different.  Everyone liked it and thought it would make a good wing sauce if it were thicker.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I did not have any dried basil so I used Italian seasoning instead and it turned out awesome! Definitely a recipe my husband and I will make over and over again.

Yummy!!  I asked my hubby if this was a "keeper" recipe, and he replied... not only was it a keeper, it was a keeper-close!  ;)   Can't have higher praise than that!  :)   I did not change a single thing, made the entire recipe exactly as written.  Delish!!

These were good, not great but quick. I rubbed the mixture (as written except i used slightly more chili powder) on the chops and left them in the fridge for a couple of hours until ready for them. Don't like to fry to much so broiled them in the oven which is also faster

I've made this dish twice in the past two months!  My husband loved it!  The combination of the basil along with the kick of the chili powder is great.  And the brown sugar that caramelizes into a sauce is so delicious. The first time I made this it came out absolutely perfect.  The second time I accidentally bought the chops a little thinner, so they cooked down smaller - but still tasty. This is now a permanent dish in my recipe roster!

Very moist, tender, delicious pork chops, and a nice alternative to braving the chill outside and putting them on the grill. Followed the recipe exactly (halved the brown sugar though), but I up'ed the EVOO a bit, and marinated the pork chops in the sugar/seasoning mixture for several hours b4 cooking them. The timing was accurate (7 min. per side) for my skinny, boneless pork chops. The flavor was subtle (not necessarily a bad thing), but I think next time I'll go w/ more chili powder, and possibly some garlic, but overall, the recipe was very good indeed, and one that I'd gladly make again.

These were tasty but still a little too sweet. I think its the combination of sweet basil and brown sugar. I followed as written. I will try again and maybe add more chilli powdwr and less of the sweet ingred.

These were good.  I paired them with caramelized onions and some mashed potatoes.  For me, the brown sugar overwhelmed the flavors of the basil and chili powder.

OMG! These were GOOD! We substituted fresh basil(6 leaves)for dried,cayenne powder(1/4 tsp)for chilli powder, and grilled outside instead of skillet. My 16yr old son always helps and he said this was the easiest so far. Thank-you!

This was okay, but did not knock my socks off.  Maybe using a thinner pork chop would offer more of the flavor from the rub.  My husband liked the flavor, but again, for those of you who don't like thick pork chops, switch to thin for sure.

This is a fast delicious recipe-- savory, spicy and sweet. I didnt have brown sugar in my pantry so I substituted natural sugar and added a tablespoon of maple sugar in place of the oil--and now we eat it that way all the time!

Yum!  The whole family liked them - and I did use a little extra of the rub ingredients as it's the sauce that makes the dish.  I think I would call them Brown Sugar Chops though.  This will be added to our regular rotation here.

Super easy and good. I added black pepper (a must-add for me, helped balance out the brown sugar), and a touch ground ginger, garlic powder, and coriander.

absolutely love this! we have made it so many times. I use thin pork chops and so cook for less time (4min each side) but every time they come out delicious. My hubby isn't a big fan of pork chops but LOVES THESE!!! Make sure not to cook at too high a temp or for too long as they sugar will turn into candy. Sometimes I add more chili powder for more of a kick but as is this recipe is great!

This was a winner!  I omitted the salt and added Thai Chili sauce in place of chili powder to give it a sweet kick and it really worked well!  Even the kids liked it!

The only thing I changed was the oil.  We don't use vegetable oil because it's "soybean".  We use either coconut or EVOO.  I used coconut oil this evening.  Other than that, I made as directed.  It's a definite keeper for our family!  Thanks!

I made these for dinner last night and they were FANTASTIC! They're just the right mix of sweet and savory flavors, and so moist and tender! My husband kept raving about them and was really surprised by how quickly they came together. We all thought it was just the right amount of sweet - especially my super picky 4 year old. I will certainly make this again!

Made exactly as directed...it was a little on the sweet side, but excellent.  If children were not eating I would add a little more chili powder.

I thought I was going to have to make a replacement meal as I was cooking this because of how burnt the brown sugar seemed to be. But after it was finally cooked through and we sat down to eat, it was surprisingly good! I did add a little garlic powder and lessened the chili powder as my husband is a wimp but over all it was a fairly decent meal. I only give it 4 stars because of the horrible clean-up from the burnt sugar.

This was so good! It was sweet, a little spicy and savory. I also added a little garlic powder about half a teaspoon only because I add garlic to everything!

This recipe was great. We eat low carb so this was very easy to adjust, just used a brown sugar substitue and I used Olive oil. The pork chops turned out delicious.

These turned out really well. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some Cayenne and a little extra chili powder since we really like spicy food and a few other reviewers recommended it. They still weren't very spicy, but they were very very good! Will be making these again.

These were yummy, yes they have a sweeter flavor but I don't think it is overpowered.  I followed the recipe precisely and they turned out great!  Because these are so quick cooking and are a new favorite in our home, I've already made them 3 times...in like 2 weeks :)

Very moist, however, the brown sugar makes them a little too sweet. I may make this recipe again, but I think I will keep looking for a better one.

This came out pretty good. I added minced garlic and chili powder, but it still seemed to lack seasoning. The chops were very juicy though.

This was delicious!! I did make a few adjustments. My husband and I don't like spicy, and I didn't have any chili powder anyway so I added some onion powder and some lemon-and-pepper that I had and also upped the salt to one teaspoon instead of just half. We loved it!! I will definitely be making this again!

Quite possibly the best pork chop I've ever had.  I think I over cooked it a bit, but that was my fault.  Still, everyone, even my picky daughter who won't eat meat ate it.

What a disappointment.  (I was really looking forward to this.)  I only altered the recipe by adding some cayanne and garlic powder as others suggested.  None of the flavors were noticeable except for the brown sugar which carmalized too much (I cooked a little higher than I should have).  I will probably try this recipe again with more spices, and a bit less brown sugar (and of course on a slightly lower heat setting).

I've used this recipe so many times since finding it.  It is simple and quick, yet the rub is so versatile with all kinds of pork and different cooking methods, including baking and grilling.  Great on pork tenderloin on the grill.  The rub gives the pork a wonderful sweet and smoky flavor.

This was a great recipe!  My whole family even my 15 mo old enjoyed eating this.  Since I am a new cook I thought I would let other people know that the brown sugar makes it look like it is burning but it is just a delicious sweet crust.

This was an excellent recipe.  The only thing I did different was that I baked them.  Aside from other reviews I think the brown sugar was just right and next time I am going to only use 1/2 tsp. of basil.  I think it overpowered the sweetness a little bit.  Otherwise these were great, and I will definitely be making them again.

Wow!  I tried this recipe on my hubby tonight, and was really surprised when he said 'This sauce is spot on!'  It was especially surprising, since he rarely likes pork chops.  However, even he said we need to keep this recipe.  I did however make a couple of changes.  We enjoy spicier foods, so I changed the recipe as follows:  I omitted the chili powder.  I doubled the recipe, and in place of the chili powder I used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (doubled = 1/2 tsp).  I also used 1/2 tsp garlic powder (doubled = 1 tsp).   I used thicker cut chops, and baked them.  The only thing I needed to do was put the sauce in a pan and thicken it on the stovetop as the meat was resting.  Thanks for the amazing recipe, Lisa!

My wife & I both liked it. It was not the best pork chop we ever had, but it was very juicy, and completely acceptable. Another advantage was that is easy to prepare and quick to cook.

Such a great easy recipe! I was searching for something new to do with chops (sick of breading or the mushroom ways) and decided to try this. Glad I did! Made it just how the recipe says and it was perfect. Juicy tender and not too sweet.

Good recipe.  Very quick preparation and cooking time.  I added some garlic pepper as well.  Overall, I think it could use some more salt, so I'll add more next time, but it was quite good.

This is one is a keeper.  Usually grilled or pan fried pork chops are dry...not these.  Very moist and delicious!

Good, but chili powder is not spicy, so don't expect a spicy taste.  This will be so much better with some added cayenne pepper or chili flakes.  Also, my brown sugar really carmelized in the pan, almost to the point of burning, and I was being really careful knowing what the sugar would do on direct heat. Did not even taste the basil.   This one will be worth playing with to get it right for my tastes.

I made these some time ago, and I don't understand why I haven't made them again until today...because I like them so much.  The sweetness of the pork mixed with the brown sugar and savory spices is delicious.  Yes, the sugar does caramelize quickly so watch them carefully.  I found that an inexpensive bone-in pork chop worked just as well as the boneless.

Yum!  These turned out great.  The brown sugar creates a wonderful caramelization that really makes the chops a great blend of sweet, savory and spicy.

The more I use this recipe, the better it tastes. I use more chili powder because the brown sugar can over take the taste of the basil and chili powder. I tried it on the grill but enjoyed it better in the skillet! It is one that everyone will enjoy :)

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. This was definitely a nice surprise. I decided to make this even though I don't usually like my meat "sweet", but wow, these were so delicious...just the right balance between sweet & spicy. The only reason they are not a five in my book is because I have been searching for the perfect pork chop and this isn't it, but it sure is close! Yummy!!

Delicious!  I recommend leaving it as is, with the exception of maybe adding a little garlic.  It's not too sweet at all and it looks, smells, and tastes great.  I made w/ mashed potatoes, but FYI, it doesn't make gravy.

Delicious and super easy.  I grilled on a grill pan for 14 minutes (4 minutes each side, 3 minutes each side) on med-high heat, so I only needed 1/2 the oil called for in the recipe.

Made exactly to recipe and served with sweet potatoes. Very, very tasty. The chops were a bit dry - so maybe I'll reduce the heat of stovetop.  My son ate every bite!

Decided to try this on a limb because I was making pork chops for my picky nieces and nephew.. Not one complaint! My whole family loved it. I had to "make" my own chili powder, which had a bit of garlic powder in it, which added to the taste I think. The rub was easy and they cooked up well!
