This pie is heavenly! I tried it for the first time on my brother and his family. Everyone, even my niece who was visiting from the culinary academy, said it was the best pie they had ever tasted. My brother even asked for a second helping! The fact that there's no top crust didn't appeal to me, so I added a lattice top crust which made the pie look even more luscious. This is definitely a keeper!!!

I recently made this recipe for a family gathering and everyone loved it ! A previous review said that this pie was too sweet..she's crazy. What would you expect when the creator said that this was a version of pecan pie which is very sweet in itself ? As for the macadamia nuts...yes they are on the pricey side, but no one ever said that you couldnt substitute them for another cheaper kind of nut. I have made this twice - once with macadamian nuts and the other 50/50 with macadamian and toasted pecans. Both times this pie was sweet, rich and oh so yummy !! You definitly want to have a big glass of milk to drink with this heavenly delight !

This pie was delicious! I am 20 and have been making pies since I was roughly 13 and my own pie crust since I was 16. So I made my own pie crust instead of a store bought one and added a small amount of coconut to the pie crust and it just gave an extra interesting flavor to the pie! I highly recommend making your own pie crust!

I made this pie for my dad for christmas. My dad is pretty honest and does not tell me what i want to hear (on anything). 
he said to give this pie 20 stars, i said sorry dad only goes up to 5 lol. He said his favorite pie is pecan but now that has changed to this one. I am a beginner in this and making this pie was very easy and it came out perfect.

Much too sweet and very expensive. (Macadamia nuts were $6!)  I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one.  Some people at Thanksgiving dinner said it was good, but I think they were just being nice.  My close relatives said YUCK.

I had high hopes for this recipe as I love pecan pie and the idea of a tropical twist was intriguing. I followed it to a “T” and took it to a friend’s house for an Asian/ Tropical inspired dinner party. All agreed it was beautiful. There was no doubt it would be a rich pie based on all the ingredients plus the melted butter poured over it but all 6 of us were overwhelmed. I guess “rich” and “sweet” are relative terms but this tipped the scale for us.

This came out amazing!  I wasn't sure it was going to bake correctly as the mix is very wet, but the finished product texture is like that of a pecan pie.  I made 2 of these in  7 in springforms with a graham cracker crust, and the recipe makes just enough. With a few small changes, this could be a perfect Passover dessert (make the crust from coconut, very fine matzoh meal instead of flour.)
