This recipe is awesome!  I'm not much of a fish fan; I used cod and talapia.  I also used cayenne pepper (1/4 to 1/2 t) which really spiced it up!  I found out at the last minute that I didn't have any cream, so I mixed in a can of cream of celery soup after browning the onions, and it was just awesome!  We will make this recipe again and again!

This pie is excellent, I have made so many times.  A friend who came for lunch loved it and then told me he didn't like fish. I  sprinkle some of the cheese on before I put the potatoes on, I also don't use as much cheese as called for.  Thank you soooo much for this recipe

to make this dish low carb friendly, simply substitute brown rice for the potatoes.  YOu can also substitute shrimp for the fish if you'd like, or use both!

Super yummy! Everyone ate it up. I added spinach, peas and 2 cloves of garlic, and also subbed a very small amount of grated parmesan for the cheddar, and red pepper flakes & paprika for the chili powder. I made the potatoes very dry so mine was not soupy in the least. Delicious!

I sauteed thawed frozen spinach with the carrots. Left out the parsley. With swordfish I added a chunky marinara mix.  I dont eat fish often as I cant seem to cook it. This was fantastic. I will make again and again I'm sure. Wonderful recipe and very flexible for changes although I'm sure even if you made it to the exact recipe it would be great also.

Great.  I added more fish and fewer potatoes.  Also, used FF half and half and you couldn't tell the difference.

this is very good.  granddaugher said 5 stars, hubby said it was good, but too many potatoes.  i liked it because it was different and was a good way to get fish in our diets.  i did listen to other reviewers and used more spice (old bay).  will make again.

The leftovers were the best part where the somewhat wet top got all dense and potatoey (is that a real word?). I did sprinkle the fish (Tilapia) with seafood seasoning, mixed some cheese into the sauce, used paprika instead of chili (feeding wee ones), and added garlic pepper to the potatoes. Without the spice additions, I could see how it would be veeeery bland. So my suggestion, season every layer to taste and you have a wonderful dish that makes GREAT leftovers.

I did this exactly as the recipe called for and my family thought it was good. They didn't rave but they ate it all and didn't complain. Also easy prep.

The original version was bland.  We sprinkled the top with some lemon juice and salted and peppered it.  The texture was great...next time I will add a little more flavor and twice the chili pwdr.  I used tilapia and added extra carrots.  The fish flavor wasn't overpowering and that was nice for the kids.

I'm no fan of fish at all but I quite enjoyed this. I used 6oz cod and 6oz sole - I wish I'd used all cod because the sole had a really strange spongey texture. I used slightly less parsley too as we aren't that keen on it. Nice, easy recipe. Thanks!

I incorporated just about every suggestion from the comments and it came out delicious.  It would be a 5 star if the recipe included all those suggestions.  To wit:  I used 1 lb of fish (rubbed some olive oil, salt and pepper on it) and 2 1/2 lbs of potatoes, added peas and an extra carrot, used less cheese than the recipe called for, added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I also didn't have heavy cream, so I ended up using 1/2 cup of half-and-half and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was nice and flavorful, but I certainly wouldn't call it spicy.  To help with texture, I coarse-mashed about 2/3 of the potatoes (yukon gold, left the skins on), layered that on the fish and vegetables, then sprinkled the cheese over that, and riced the remaining third of the potatoes (obviously, you need a ricer for that) over everything.  When it came out of the oven (30 minutes at 400), the riced potatoes on the top were golden and crispy.

This is a tasty, hearty dish! I halved the recipe, because there are only three of us at the table, but it turned out well. The gravy/stock ends up being very flavorful. Of course I added a bit of my own seasonings to taste, didn't have olive oil, just used regular canola. I think I used a big tilapia filet as well. Turned out great. A keeper!

So came home late with fresh cod fish, wanted something fast but different. So when I came across this recipe, I went for it. But strapped for time, so I used instant mashed potatoes, my mistake = my bad! I know better with shepard's pie, to use the real deal when it comes to mashed potatoes. It came out a little bit on the watery side, but the TASTE was AWESOME!!! It was hearty, filling, but light. The flavors were great. So good we made it again ( actually as I am typing this, we are enjoying the meal, it is that good!) with a chunkier mashed potatoes base, chopped celery, green onions, peas and goat cheese. Again it turned out really yummy. I love this recipe for the ease, flavor and the hubster keeps asking for it. Thank you for the share Stripeland & the Hubster says"Good stuff" as he helps himself to seconds....

Coming from a non-fish lover, I thought is was a decent meal.  A tad on the bland side (not sure where the spicy part came in).  I felt like the sauce should have been thicker (maybe next time make a roux and thicken it?) and more flavor added to the entire thing.  However, it was a good hearty meal.

I was intimidated by how many carbs and calories were in this dish but it sounded sooo good, so I lightened it up. I subbed 1lb of potatoes with 1/2lb frozen cauliflower, boiled them and mashed them together using my hand blender. I didn't add the milk to the mashed potatoes since using cauliflower added moisture. I also seasoned the mash with a liberal dash of seasoning salt and the result was awesome! I didn't have any cream on hand but since I have a one year old I always have homo milk so I used a big cup of milk and kept the fry pan on the stove on low for 10-15 extra minutes to reduce the sauce. I also used about 1/2 as much cheese. On the more decadent side of things, I thought that if you subbed out some of the cream and added cream cheese to the sauce it might play well with the rest of the flavours. I will definitely make this again UPDATE: It's April 14th and it snowed today (sarcastic YIPPEE!) so I was in the mood for something warm and comforting for dinner. I subbed the cream with fat free sour cream and added a handful of frozen peas and frozen corn to the cream mixture. It gave this dish that bit of kick in flavour it needed. I also squeezed half a lemon over the fish before I added the cream mixture which also helped add to the flavour. I did have to step out while this was baking and since I was concerned dinner would burn, I decreased the heat to 350 and covered it with foil which was a huge mistake. I ended up with Spicy Fisherman's Soup, but it was yummy

Years ago in England I had a seafood pie that I still can't get off my mind. This recipe looked similar to what I remember. I did make some changes--instead of hot chili pepper I used Old Bay Seasoning.  For fish we used Cod and Shrimp. Next time we'll make more adjustments since it a bit runny.  Might add a bit of corn starch to thicken.  Also would heat thoroughly before spreading potatoes on top since they sort of melted into the rest.  Will add potatoes and  later turn heat to broil.  Hubby wants to add scallops next time too.  A good Dubliner cheese on top might be nice to try also. Overall, flavor matched my memory. Great after a day of skiing.

Its so good on time and ingrediants, My husband raved about it the whole time during dinner. I loved this because it doesnt take too long and I can use that extra time watching my 2 month old. I added some spinach to the vegetables for variety.

Yum!!  This was delicious!  I can't give it 5 stars though b/c without adjusting the seasonings it would be pretty bland.  I seasoned the fish w/ salt and pepper and increased the chili pwdr to 1/2 t and it still needed additional salt and pepper after it came out of the oven.  I also added about 3/4 c of frozen peas and doubled the carrots.   Took others' advice on the potatoes (used 2 lbs) and only 4 oz of cheese.  This will definitely be going into our dinner rotation.

My 5 kids said to give this one "ten stars".  I can not remember the last time a meal got such RAVE reviews.  There were no leftovers!   Followed the recipe exactly, it is perfect just the way it is!  Thank you!

I ran across this recipe after having my first Fisherman's Pie in Ireland this past fall (the same recipe concept but slightly different because it was made with mainly cod, a couple pieces of salmon and a few shrimp.  I have made this recipe several times using various fish including catfish, hallibut, talapia (really any preferred white fish is fine).  After making the recipe as directed the first time, I found a little tweeking (added preferred seasonings to family taste) it really is a great recipe. It works well with additional preferred ingredients such as sliced fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, etc.  To save time, I use the Country Crock Homestyle Mash Potatoes (these are real potatoes and are a quick fix (5 mins) in microwave.  I also prepare in small individual casserole dishes for easy serving.

I changed quite a bit. I used Orange Roughy and Catfish. I also added a cup of mixed veggies to the onion and carrot cooked in oil. I also sprinkled the veggies and the fish with Slap Ya Mama seasoning. The meal was really good.

this recipe is fantastic.  Unstoppable.  The color of the carrot, onions, and parsley mixed with the cream is beautiful.  You will want to eat the sauce.  I used tilapia with mine, and I added a lot more chili powder and salt.  My taste..  It bakes up wonderfully with the cheese and mashed potatoes.  Congradulations.

Made this last night and it was delicious. My 5-yr-old son found it too spicy though and ended up eating toast for dinner. I used 3 smoked cod fillets, plus I added about 250g of chopped spinach, which really did help. I left out the parsley as I didn't think it needed it. It was still fairly runny after baking for 45 minutes, but not sloppy. In response to one of the other reviewers whose husband didn't like mash on top... I only semi-mashed the potatoes so it wasn't 'sloppy' and it was a good texture that resulted. I think you could add a lot of great things to this recipe and really adapt it to suit your own tastes. My husband suggested kumara...!? Thanks for this beauty!

This is my second time making it.  Although I like the original recipe I like it better this time.  I did use grouper instead of cod this time.  That, I didn't like but other than that, I added peas and celery to the veggies and instead of adding the parsley and chili powder to the cream, I added Old Bay seasoning and a dash of nutmeg.  I also browned some panko crumbs in butter and mixed in the cheese with the panko mixture and topped the potatoes.  Overall I did prefer the way I made it this time around.  Thanks Stripeland for the recipe.  I never would have though to do this with fish.

We'd give it a 4.5. We upped the spices and it still could use a kick. Great recipe! Easy and delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

great recipe. perhaps being a bit more liberal with the spices (cayenne, salt, pepper and add some minced garlic) will make it more tasty.  I've done this recipe with both cod and a combo of tilapia/shrimp.  I would suggest seasoning the seafood with salt/pepper/olive oil to bring out the flavor of the seafood, which can get lost in the potatoes and veggie mixture. give this one a try - it's a winner.

That recipe was really good. I have nothing bad to say about although I do have one recommendation, replace Cheddar cheese with Feta. For one, it's healthier.

We enjoyed this recipie.  We tend to like our food a little on the spicer side, so I will add more chili powder next time.  It would be a great fish dish for those who are not so found of fish.

Not a big hit with the family, it was mushy and no spice. I wish I would have strayed from the recipe and done differently.

This was fairly bland. The fish gets lost in all the potatoes. If I made it again, I'd halve the potatoes and put the cheese on before the potatoes.

I agree with the other reviewers that this wasn't spicy at all.  But overall it was pretty good for a fish dish.  I had recently accidentally bought some Whiting fillets thinking they were Tilapia fillets because they were in the same type packaging and I was in a hurry and didn't look at the package closely.  ANYWAY, I used those and the fish flavor was pretty strong but my family still ate it and thought it was pretty good.  I also substituted a cup of chopped fresh spinach for the parsley since I didn't have any parsley on hand.  If I make this again I will make sure I have the Tilapia on hand as we prefer it's milder flavor.

I LOVED this recipe. Next time will make more so that I can freeze it for easy cooking. I used jack cheese on top and it came out SO GOOD!! I will try Gruyere next time and might add some thyme for more flavor.

This dish had good flavor but my husband says that fish and mashed potatoes shouldn't be mixed together.  He thought the consistancy was to much like baby food.  If I make this again I may just cube the potatoes and see how that goes over.

Comfort food that was actually pretty good.  Kind of like a Shepherds Pie with fish.  Doctored up the mashed potatoes with more butter, milk, s & p and garlic.  Added cheese to milk sauce.  Used half&half because that is what I had.

I had dental surgery a few days ago, and was looking for something - ANYTHING - other than soup to eat that didn't require me going to the grocery store, and this fit the bill.  

I used cod, which was excellent.  Next time, I will consider adding a little shrimp for textural and taste variety.

I used frozen mixed veggies - a mistake, I think, because the beans and squash in the mix stood out too much.  I do think I'd use onions, carrots, corn and peas next time.

I didn't have cream, so I made a white sauce, which I'll probably do again as I'm more likely to have the ingredients on hand.  I added "Old Bay" seasoning to the white sauce.

I didn't put the cheese on top because I don't really like cheese and fish together, but I think I'll grate some parmesan on top next time.

All in all, easy, yummy, and easily modifiable for preferences.  We'll have it again.  Thank you!!

made this (gazillion?) times - i like to replace fresh cilantro with 1/2 tsp each  rosemary, thyme, onion powder, & sage. Throw in 1-3 Tbsp dried parsley flakes for extra herbal kick.
 if not a chili pepper fan, crack some black pepper( 1-2 tsp) and squeeze lots of fresh lemon.  thanks to chef for great recipe!

I love the base of this recipe. I supplemented the potatoes with cauliflower to make the mash and agree with the rest of the reviewers that it can use more salt and chili powder. I can see a range of substitutions that could be used to make a similar recipe.

Really great, but we did cut back on the potatos and the cheese by about half, using full amounts of butter and milk when mashing (can't imagine it as written -it'd be nothing but cheese and really dry mashed potatos!).  Instead of all the cheese on top, mixed about half in with the veggies/sauce.  Had a small amount of frozen green beans to use up, so added those to the sauce as well along with a clove of garlic.

This recipe is fantastic!  Everything came out perfect.  I halved the recipe since I was the only one eating and it was lovely.  I didn't have any milk so I used the heavy whipping cream in the potatoes.  Additionally, I added some seasoning on the fish.  Will make again.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but tailored it to my family's tastes. Added peas to the carrots and onion and used cream of mushroom soup mixed with a little fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream. Added small sized shrimp to the sauce and used paprika instead of chili powder. Poured over fish, topped with brown rice and sprinkled small amount of monterey jack cheese on top. Baked according to the recipe. Very tasty, going into the rotation. Thank you!

This was delicious!  We've had to give up Shepherd's Pie due to some allergy issues with the common ingredients, so this was a wonderful surprise.  A word of warning though, don't over cook the potates, or it will turn into a soup/stew, and it may not need the full 40 min baking time.  My oven usually cooks a little slower, so I just set the timer for 40 min and walked away, and didn't check it.  That was totally my fault, but when I came back, the chese had browned, melted and sunk.  Still amazingly tasty as a stew though :)

This was really delicious. I had to substitute with cream of chicken soup and tilapia but it worked! Also added chopped celery and dried sage instead of parsley to make it taste a bit more like chowder. Definitely adding this to my favorites, especially during the cold winter months.

I am not a fish fan but I enjoyed this. I have to get some fish into the diet and I found this was warm & tasty. It was almost more soupy than a pie, so we scooped and served in bowls with rolls. I added some garlic powder and salt, and used basa filets. we like spicy so we topped with a little tabasco. thanks for the recipe :)

This was very good! I only made a couple of adjustments. Taking a tip from another reviewer, I added broccoli. I used White Ruffy fish (very mild) and instead of adding milk to the potatoes, I added about 1/4 cup of the heavy cream. I have to agree with others that it did not have much flavor. I ended up adding some kosher salt and seasoning salt. Would defintely make it again!

This was okay. I used tilapia since it was what i had in my freezer, and added some cayenne for a little more kick. The dish just wasnt that flavorful to me though. Needed something more, but I am not sure what.

Excellent, particularly with some changes. I thought the fish/potato ratio sounded skewed, so I used two pounds of fish (Nile Perch) and two and a half of potato and it was perfect. I also sauteed two cloves of garlic with the onion, and used three carrots rather than one. Lastly, I put the cheese (only three ounces) on top of the cream mixture and under the potatoes, rather than on top of them where it would dry out. I sprinkled paprika on top of the potatoes. This was a big hit with my family, even the ones who don't like fish.

I used this recipe as a guideline to create a similar dish, but using what I had already in the fridge. I needed to use up some cauliflower, celery and dill; I threw in a little onion and frozen spinach. Used a can of cream of mushroom soup, and some seasonings. Thawed some flounder filets. I also used instant potatoes. I liked this recipe because it was a great combination of ingredinets and the method of preparation worked well.

My family and I thought this was a great dish.  I did add some pea's in with the carrot and didnt mash my pots up very much and they absorbed the cream from the and did not make it too soupy at all.  I used some taco sauce on the top as I didnt think it was spicy at all.  Very tasty though.  Will definately make this again.

This recipe was more than just a keeper. My wife and I were oohing and aahing with the first few bites. It's truly outstanding.
I stayed with the recipe but added a little more of some things.  First and foremost, I used a whole pound of cod. I used a large onion rather than a medium.  I used two carrots rather than one. I poured in the cup of cream and then added enough more until it "looked right."
It smelled wonderful in the oven and tasted even better than that.

I used 2 pounds of pollock and that seemed to be about the right amount. Any less and you won't even find the fish. During the saute I also added a package of thawed chopped spinach, which made a big difference. Not sure why this is called spicy, even after doubling the chili powder I barely tasted it. Maybe the original recipe called for cayenne instead. In any case, the end product was delicious, and smelled great while it was cooking. I recommend it, and will make it again.

This recipe was ok, but the sauce and fish cooked far too long. Next time I will add the sauce the last few minutes of cooking so it doesn't curdle. There is way too much cheese, and it should be added the last few minutes, too. Overall, it tasted good, but it definitely needs some changes to make it a five star recipe. I used a salmon filet because that's what I had on hand. Didn't bother cutting it up. The fish itself turned out a little dry from the long cooking time. Fish doesn't need a long time too cook. About 20 minutes per inch of fish otherwise it becomes dry.
