Ohmigosh this is fabulous! It is so easy and has that homemade comfort food factor--perfect for a cold night. I used the juice of a whole lemon (about 4 times the amount called for) and left out the peppers. Instead of cooking it on the stovetop, I put it in the oven in a covered casserole dish for about an hour at 325. I doubled the water called for to increase the sauce, and served it with steamed broccolli and plain brown rice. The sauce made a fabulous gravy for the rice. My husband called this a home run!

This was good! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. My husband suggested the addition of some other veggies and then serve it over a bed of rice. I think next time I'll try that.

This was so easy to make and delicious. My very picky 2 yr old even cleared his plate. I made few changes because I didn't have fresh parsley  so I used dry parsley flakes and I doubled the lemon juice. My Husband said it is his new favorite chicken dish. Thank you for this recipe.

Really enjoy this recipe... have made it a few times and have finally taken some advice and some of my own tweaks to make it even better. I use double the lemon juice, add a teaspoon and a half of Italian seasoning, a T of honey (makes it the BEST), and a pinch of red pepper flakes for another layer of flavor... Its quite a few additions but surely all things everyone has already in their kitchen

I would give this one or two stars as the recipe is written.  I gave it three stars after I added some additional seasoning as others suggested.  As written, it seemed very bland.  I seasoned my chicken breasts and also added additional seasoning to the lemon sauce.  I am not a huge fan of soup based sauces but my husband liked it.  Next time, I will definitely use fresh lemon juice and grate some lemon zest to go in the sauce.

I took the advice of a couple other reviews and used the juice of a whole lemon.  Served with wild rice and crusty french bread for dipping - this was a big hit with the boyfriend!

Great recipe.  We enjoyed this dish for dinner tonight and found it to be very tasty.  I did not have fresh lemons so I did not add the lemon slices.  I did, though, double the lemon juice and water that I added.  I did not have fresh parsley but the dried I had on hand was fine.  I also added some chopped up onions in addition to the green peppers.  The sauce spooned over the side of brown rice was delicious.  I baked the chicken for 45 minutes at 350 degrees after first browning the chicken on the stop top.  I'm sure this would be just as good in a crock pot.

This did not taste all that much like lemon, as 1 tablespool of lemon juice can only go so far, but other than that was amazing! very rich and comforting taste. My family dipped break in the sauce and wiped their plates clean!

The sauce was a little over whelming alone, but added to pasta with the chicken, it was tamed and delicious.

This was fantastic!  Didn't have parsley or peppers and it was still really good.  Served with lemon cucumber rice is really good and makes a good replacement for the peppers.

This was pretty good and talk about easy.  Mind you, I didn't even use the pepper because I didn't have any.  I think a required ingredient though.  I used dried parsley and bottled lemon juice.  I can't wait to make it again using the exact called for ingredients!!  Also may add some finely chopped shallots.  Too easy I tell ya.

This was WONDERFUL!  I did make some changes by adding more fresh lemon juice, a little chopped onion, some chicken broth and some half and half to make it a bit more creamy.  I seasoned my chicken with a chipotle seasoning mix and served it all over angel hair pasta.

I'm not a huge fan of lemon sauces but my boyfriend is and after following the recipe I thought it was kinda sour and not too much flavor. I added half and half, basil, garlic powder and pepper. That really helped and made it a delicious final dish.

This recipe was very tasty.  I only made 2 chicken breasts however since it is just me and my husband.  I used a whole can of cream of chicken soup and 1/4 cup water to make the sauce creamier.  I also added a little extra lemon juice and I cooked it on the stove top for a total of 15 minutes.  Prior to covering it, I sliced a lemon and put 2 lemon slices on each chicken breast.  My husband loved it!!

This was good, but I had thought the sauce would be thicker for some reason.  Mine was like sitting in a soup.  I baked it all together for an hour at 325 like one of the reviews suggested.  Definitely still good, but would try leaving out the water next time.  I also squeezed a whole fresh lemon per the reviews.

It is a lovely dish to go with rice and a salad but you must add more veggies to the sauce, lemon juice and something to thicken a bit (I used a bit of corn starch).  I find adding the lemon juice JUST before serving makes sure the taste doesn't get cooked out.

Did not care for this at all.  Made it with a couple breast and a couple thighs and served it over rice.  Just didn't like the flavor of it.  It was edible but, I would not make it again.

We love this recipe. I cut the chicken into chunks before cooking as I have bad luck with browning whole breast pieces. I also add some sundried tomatoes (not packed in oil - just the dry ones) for a little extra flavor and WOW - so good! We have tried this over rice as well as couscous and either one tastes really good. I also add garlic because I think I'm a garlic addict - it really adds something to this dish! Oh, and use real lemon juice instead of the bottled stuff - it just doesn't compare.

This was just okay.  I may have used a little too much paprika (I just estimated instead of measuring, but I thought I was pretty close)?  Not sure, but it was just "okay" and not great.

Made this tonight for dinner. Did everything as called for in the recipe, however I seasoned my chicken with black pepper, all purpose seasoning and garlic powder. Also added lemon pepper in the sauce. Served with mash potatoes - DELISH!

This was excellent, the only thing I did different was added fresh garlic to the sauce and 1 whole lemon and my family LOVED it.  They are very picky and don't like much.  Two teenage girls and husband loved it.  I will be making this again and again.

We loved this recipe. I will make sure to take the advice of other reviews and double the lemon juice though.

Not bad. I made a few changes - I used chicken thighs with bone and skin and browned them for longer. I also used twice the liquid and replaced the water with 1/2 sherry, 1/2 chicken broth. I liked the flavor, but it had just a bit too much lemon. Definitely needed the sherry/broth in place of the water because it would have been too bland without it.

I liked this recipe although I believe that I will add more bell peppers next time.  Really like the lemon in it.  Served with the colcannon from this website and it was a very good combination.  Will make again.
