I like that this recipe is so easy and doesn't require biscuit mix.  I've made them three times and tweaked the recipe to make them even better.  I added salt, dried basil, baking soda, and used only one egg (the first batch came out more eggy than puffy!).  Instead of shredding the cheddar, I finely diced it and that gave me little wonderful cheese bursts instead of it being more incorporated into the dough.  They only needed 15 minutes in my oven, and I only managed to get 12 itty bitty biscuits out of this recipe.  I'll double or triple it next time and drop them by tablespoonful.

These were good, but they definitely need more garlic, as we really couldn't taste it with the amounts called for.  I also added oregano and parsley, as well as a bit of salt, but left out the pepper and the onions.  In addition, after reading other reviews that they did not puff up, I added 1 tsp of baking powder and they rose nicely.  When they came out of the oven, I brushed them with melted butter.  Pretty good, but need more garlic, I'll make them again and play with the recipe a bit.

Great biscuit1 My family loved them. I did make a couple of changes from the original recipe.  I doubled the recipe, did not add onion...then added 1/2 cup chopped bacon bits. Delicious!

I have used this site for a few years now, and have not come across a recipe that was worth putting in a review, but this one was wonderful. I only used cheese, since I didn't have any onion or garlic, but they were still tasted amazing!

Great recipe! They didn't look much like biscuits for me, maybe more like high cookies. But delicious nonetheless. I used Gouda cheese, and the onion complemented it really well.

I doubled this recipe & it turned out great.  Only thing I'd change is add 1/4 t. salt (or instead of garlic powder use garlic salt).  They flattened out more than I expected they would after coming out of the oven, but still tasted great.  Make sure the pan is well greased, mine stuck somewhat where the cheese bits touched the pan.

Quick, easy and small!  I didn't add the onions, instead did 1/8 tsp. onion powder, also only used 1/8 tsp. garlic powder.  I only got 8 puffs and only cooked for 20 mins because there were small and didn't want the bottoms dark.  Frankly, this dough is quite like creme puff dough!

These were pretty good.  A little too much pepper I think.  I decided to make regular sized biscuits instead of the smaller puffs.  I adjusted the cooking time and they looked done when I took them out of the oven and I even stuck a toothpick in them but they ended up having an “eggy” texture.  I’ll try them again and make them smaller next time.  Hopefully they’ll be better that way.

My family calls these flatscuits because they don't rise at all but they love the taste.  Have made these several times and each time get rave reviews and requests to make them again.  Also, I only get about 10 biscuits - nowhere near 24.

Delicious and so easy!  The flour substitution worked great.  I took the advice of others... more cheese, garlic powder and thyme. Also sprinkled the top with Parmesan Cheese. My daughter devoured them.  Can't wait to try them on Sunday Family Dinner.

Very good - but I highly recommend adding a little salt and about 1 tsp baking powder to get a real puff out of it. With the salt and baking powder, this recipe is a 4-star.

These are similar to cheese aigrettes - a cheesy version of profiteroles - as they are basically choux pastry you have to take them out of the oven, slit them (removing any surplus uncooked mixture if necessary)then return them to the oven with the door open for a few mins to dry out. Can be filled with a cream cheese mixture for an appetiser!

2 eggs to 1/2 c flour was more like an omelet.  Not making these again.  And nowhere near 24 biscuits...

These suckers will NOT puff!!! I threw in a tsp of baking powder and the first batch didnt rise, so I added another 1/2 tsp to the other half that hadnt gone in yet and they didn't rise either. The only thing I added was oregano and I doubled the garlic. Taste great..but flat.

These tasted very good but they were not flaky or rise as much as I would have liked.  I added a tsp. of baking powder as recommended by another reviewer but even then they did not rise as desired.

I made this recipe as listed and added 2 slices of precooked bacon. They do not have much flavor, i added bacon and that is all I can taste. Also they got very flat, and only made about 6-7 biscuits. I will not make these again.

I found that these biscuits were bland and tasteless. I added a tsp. of salt which seemed to help. Also, this recipe does not yield 24 biscuits; I got 9 out of it. And even they were quite small.

I really liked these biscuits. I tripled the recipe because the recipe does not make the 24 biscuits that it states it will make. These are very heavy on eggs, but it adds to the great texture and flavor. I already got a request for the recipe!

I love these biscuits!  They are not exactly what I was expecting as an accompaniment to pasta, but on their own, they are absolutely delicious!  I will make them again for sure!!

I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out exactly as I would expect from puff pastry and they were tasty. They aren't really what I would expect in a biscuit though(more of a tangy-salty cream puff dough), they were extremely small (bite size) and I too found them a little 'eggy'. I will be keeping this recipe for making bites and will stuff them with tapenade for the Holidays.

I didn't think they were that bad but my boyfriend did not care for them at all...he said they tasted like eggs. I added baking soda for the rise effect. I think I will try them again.

I thought these were pretty good while my husband absolutely loved them (which is how they got 4 stars). I was a bit disappointed that they didn't "puff up" more than they did. I threw in some Bacos for some added flavor.

Fine, but not overwhelming.  Added 1 tsp baking soda and reduced to 1 egg based on other reviews.  Skipped the onion based on personal preference.

Just made these and they need salt. I like bursts of cheese, so used small cubes instead of shredding, but I wouldn't recommend it. The cheese sort of burns. Overall, I was not terribly impressed...

They were sooo good.  We finished the whole batch in one night.  :)  Will definitely make again!

I wasn't crazy about these.  I liked the taste overall, but they were flat and lifeless.  I might have to add some baking powder next time, and less liquid.

This is not a good biscuit recipe at all.  I followed the directions perfectly and cooked it for the amount of time indicated on 350, and the middle did not cook at all.  This is very disappointing.  I doubled the recipe and still only got 6 decent sized biscuits..I dont know why it says 24.  I will continue my search for a good biscuit recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and the biscuits were not edible.  The biscuit smelled great but I knew it went south when I started adding the eggs.  Not sure what went wrong but I was so disappointed.

I'll rate this recipe 2 stars since they weren't very good (my boyfriend says he'll eat them, but only with lots of butter on them). I did add 1 tsp baking soda to help them rise, which they did a little. I doubled the recipe, and therefore doubled all of the ingredients EXCEPT for the egg since other reviewers said they were too "eggy". However, I found that mine were still way too "eggy" tasting. It was kind of like eating yucky cream puffs, or yorkshire pudding.  :O(

This recipe was fantastic, besides the fact that the butter, milk, and flour burned. It didn't hold together very well, but it tasted great! Thanks for yummy recipe!

Not terribly impressive.  I only used 1 egg per others' suggestions and swapped the garlic powder for 2 garlic cloves.  Good combination of flavors-just not enough "biscuit".  I eeked out 10 biscuits and they were very small--no where near the 24 of the serving size.  Not a repeat recipe.

These were really good. Next time I make them I will take the suggestion of adding salt. It didn't occur to me while I made them that Australian cheddar is less salty than american, so it was missing a little, but I'm sure they'll be delicious when I make them again in the states!
