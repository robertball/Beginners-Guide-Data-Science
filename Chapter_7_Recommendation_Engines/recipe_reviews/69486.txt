The cheese adds a nice flavor and makes the dish more exciting than my similar recipe. The cheese has to be added when the pot is simmering lightly or when turned off, because if you have the pot boiling away, you will get cheese goo!! The cheese melts best when it starts out at room temperature, not cold. I always brown the sausage first in the soup pot, and then the onion, because it adds a layer of flavor. If there is too much grease for your taste after browning the sausage and onion, you can remove it with a paper towel before the liquid is added. I also add a can of diced tomatoes, with juice, but that is because I like the combo of cabbage, potatoes and tomatoes with the cheese. Thanks, this is a great winter warmer-upper!!

I thought this chowder was awesome.  I sauted 2 cloves of garlic and two chopped onions.  Then I added the potatoe, sausage and cabbage to the pot.  I used one 48 oz. can of chicken broth and simmered for about 30 minutes.  Then added the cheese and milk and lots of fresh ground pepper and thickened it a bit.  The swiss cheese gives it a great flavor.  I will make this again.

I made this for a german feast and everybody loved it! I took someone else's advice from another review to make a cheese sauce before adding it to the rest of the soup. I just made a little bit of rue, added the evaporated milk and melted the cheese and when it was all melted, I added it to the rest of the soup. It came out great and there were no problems with the cheese getting gummy or not mixing well.

I crumbled the sausage and cooked before starting. I read the reviews while the vegetables were simmering. After seeing that most thought it was watery, I took out 3-4 cups of the broth. I turned down the heat so it wouldn't be boiling when I added the cheese, and added it slowly, but it still got clumpy. It was really tasty, but still more watery than a chowder should be. I will use these ingredients again, but maybe make a cheese sauce to add instead of the cheese alone.

This soup was DELICIOUS!  I used chicken broth base instead of water and bouillon.  Also added garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste (more than a pinch).  We liked it a lot and I definitely plan on making it again!

Really good! I used fresh polish, it didn't specify, and I prefer fresh to smoked. Take note, this soup is gassy, don't eat too much if you are in a no-fart zone for the next 5 hours.

This chowder turned out PERFECT I didn't read the reviews until just now, but it was wonderful. They only thing I did different was add instant mashed potatoes (butter flavor) instead of whole potatoes, and because my boys like them I threw in some carrots. All 3 kids (3,4,&7) ate more than I expected, and hubby loved it!

This is really yummy comfort food.  I didn't have potatoes so I used egg noodles instead.  I will dice the sausage next time and put the shredded cheese on top (it was gummy mixed in the soup) but otherwise it was great!

I added too much water at first and took some of it away while the cabbage was cooking.  The sausage lacked a little bit of flavor, but I will try a spicier sausage next time.  The chowder still turned out a little bit too runny, but when we reheated the left overs the next day it was absolutely perfect.  My fiancee loved it. One of his favorite dishes now.

I did AncestryDNA and found out I’m not German. I’m British AF.  But I made this recipe and I feel German like a mo fo.   Like... Uber German.  Like lederhosen and brats grappling out of the ceiling type German.  Uber German!    Highly recommend for anyone that wants a great easy meal and wants to Oktoberfest your steins off.

Made this tonight for dinner. It came out delicious. Nice flavor. I sautéed the kielbasa and onions in the soup pot first then I  used chix broth as a base instead of water and bouillion. I did add some "better than bouillion " chix base for additional flavor though. I didn't add any salt. It had plenty. I I used half a small red cabbage and half a small green Savoy cabbage and added some dry mustard as some people called for in the reviews. I didn't cover the vegetable with water either. I added enough broth to sit about an inch below the veggies so when the cabbage shrunk down it was all covered nicely. I also melted the Swiss cheese in the evaporated milk over low- medium heat, stirring constantly, and then blended that in just before serving.  This prevented any clumping sticky cheese. I used some  cornstarch and water to thicken it at the very end. It was perfect!  It was thick like chowder should be. My family liked it served with a dollop of red beet horseradish. We at it with yeast rolls and butter. Super good!

I don't typically review recipes I haven't made as written, but in this case I'm going to because I think this recipe has potential, just not as written.  I made it with 2 boxes of low sodium chicken stock instead of water and filled the pot to an inch UNDER the veggies.  They give off water as they cook so when I pulled the lid (oh yeah, I cooked the first 15 minutes with it covered), the liquid was just right.  I still added the boullion.  I added 2 onions and 2 cloves of garlic.  I too like the combo of tomato and cabbage so I threw in a can of diced stewed tomatoes with their juice - it could have used one more. I also added quite a bit of dry mustard as someone else suggested.  I liked this recipe and with the adjustments I made, I'd give it 4 of 5 stars.  I heeded the advice of others who had issues getting the cheese melted in and made a sauce of sorts with the evaporated milk, a little hot broth, and the cheese and whisked like mad to get it to come together. it sorta did, but not well.  

If I made this again, which I will, I'll probably saute the veggies first in some butter, add flour to make a roux, then add in the broth.  The broth tasted good in it, but it left me wanting it more creamy style rather than soupy.

Great base, but made a few changes...and turned out a seconds-worthy meal! Skipped the cheese. Instead, added 10 oz. of high-quality (Bubbies) sauerkraut, which was not only well-drained, but I squeezed out almost all liquid between paper towels. The acidity from the sauerkraut rounded out the soup, and added an interesting texture (a slight crunchiness). I also added 3T powdered mustard (from someone else's suggestion.) This one's going into the permanent online file!

Wonderful recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe is the first time, and I liked it okay...but the second time, I used shredded cheddar/monteray jack blend cheese instead of swiss, and added a can of rotel tomatoes, and a can of cream of mushroom, believe it or not...really liked it (for me and the family's taste) much better. Thanks for the ideas!

This was very good.  I will definitely make it again.  I think I used a little too much water in mine.  I also got distracted by a visitor and cooked the potatoes and cabbage way too long.  But it still turned out good.  I definitely needed more than a pinch of salt.  And the swiss cheese was a bit stringy, but I loved the flavor.  Hubby enjoyed it too.  GREAT cold weather meal!

Very, very good! I just tweaked it a little- about 2 tsp ground mustard and probably the same of garlic powder. I also added celery and used canned chicken broth (because of broth and cheese no additional salt was needed). The swiss gave a lot of flavor but clumped up in the soup and added a lot of fat on top. Probably can just add it on top of each individual bowl. I will definitely make this again.

I have to try this! A german friend of mine once made me something similar but instead of onions she used finely chopped leeks, and no cheese. Was fragrant and deeeelicious.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this, it was really yummy and hearty on top of it.  To avoid it being too watery we used one can of chicken broth, and about half as much evaporated milk.  Also we used cheddar cheese which waas cheaper.  It came out really well, our only complaint was that there was too much cheese sauce left at the end- we felt (as college students) like that was a big waste.  Would use less cheese next time for sure.  Great with garlic.

Everyone in my family (kids included) LOVED this recipe!  I only made a couple of changes:  I added another pound of kielbasa and sauteed it with a few cloves of chopped garlic.  I also added another cube of bouillon and a can of chicken broth with the water. Thank you so much!

This is a great wintertime recipe! I used bratwurst instead of kielbasa (sliced and browned before adding to the pot), but everyone took seconds and loved it.

This is an awesome chowder!  I happened to have knockwurst on hand, so I used it instead of kielbasa and used the cheddar cheese and we loved it!  Next time I'll use the kielbasa and I can only imagine that it'll be even better.  Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe, Allie!

Very Tasty.  The kind of sausage you use will make all the difference.  Used less water than what it called for and half the swiss cheese.  Also used non-fat evap milk.  Was thin but very good.  Had shredded red cabbage available and used it.

Has potential but too watery and the Swiss did NOT blend at all. It  STUCK to everything in globs, definitely NOT like a chowder.  I it would have tasted better if the onions and Kielbasa were browned in soup pot first to add flavor.
   It sounded good but too expensive to experiment with this again.

Thank you for this super easy, delicious recipe!  Had all the ingredients on hand except for the swiss cheese, so I used a blend of cheddar and monterey; it did not come out lumpy at all!  I was expecting it to be a little thicker and creamier, though, but it was fine.  The potatoes broke down a little and "thickened" it.  Served it with a side of corn bread for dinner.  Hearty and delicious, my boyfriend loved it!

This is really good. I did follow the advice of another reviewer and made a cheese sauce with a rue and then added it to the soup. It came out perfectly.

I substituted brussels sprouts for the cabbage because that is what I had on hand. Also I used heavy whipping cream in place of evaporated milk. again, what I had on-hand.

This was a win! Next time I make it I will take some of the tips I have read here and sauté the kielbasa first. also, maybe cut the slices in halves. 

This was a great chowder! Thank you for the recipe!

My batch came out too thin so I added a bag of cooked egg noodles at the end.  Also added an extra onion and three garlic cloves to the recipe.  Instead of adding the shredded cheese to the soup pot, we sprinkled it on top of each serving.  It was delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  It completely filled my stock pot so next time I think I will tr y cooking/steaming the cabbage first.  I followed another reviewers advice and made a roux in a separate pan by melting 3 Tbsp butter and adding 3 Tbsp flour.  Slowly added in the evaporated milk.  Then I added 2 packages of shredded swiss cheese.  It melted into a smooth fondue like cheese sauce that I incorporated into the soup and so there were no issues about cheese goo.

Loved the idea of cabbage, potatoes and kielbasa but it was lacking in flavor.  Used chicken broth instead of bouillon and added about a teaspoon of caraway to add flavor but it just didn't come together like I expected.  Sorry.

I made this on a nippy night for supper and it was great. I used Chappell Hill Pecan Garlic Smoked Sausage and 1 T. Penzey's toasted granulated onion. Used chicken broth to boil the green cabbage & gold potatoes. Forgot to buy cheese at the store, so no cheese was added, and the recipe was still very tasty.

My second son was born on Halloween and we have celebrated his birthday every year with trick or treating and a family costume party. This recipe over the years has become a family tradition and a tasty way warm up after gathering the neighborhood treats.  I do occasionally make personal changes, but ultimately a wonderful tradition with some Sour dough bread..If you add a couple tablespoons of flour or some corn starch it will thicken the broth for more of a chowder effect. I add garlic, parsley and a few spices and occasionally a pinch of Cheyenne it gives it a delightful kick

A great way to get your family to eat cabbage. This reminded me of a "Cream of Cabbage" chowder.  I added a bouillon cube for every cup of water I used. I also used garlic salt and white pepper for the salt and pepper. Finally, I used the very finely shredded cheddar cheese. I added the cheese a little at a time (maybe 1/4 cup at a time) and stirred until it melted before I added more. The cheese melted pretty quickly so this didn't take very long.

Very tasty dish. I know maybe I shouldn't reveiw unless I made it according to the recipe, but I'm going to anyway, so here's what I did. I sauteed the sausage, added the onions and sauteed a little more, added the cabbage and sauteed a  little more. Also, I love to cook my soups with wine, but that didn't seem right with this, so I added half a bottle of a harvest beer along with chicken broth and finished the recipe as written. Both kids liked this a lot, as did I, and I'm having the leftovers for lunch.

This was okay-- a bit watery, but also rich from the cheese.  Just didn't quite find a balance for our tastes.

After reading the recipe and the rewiews, I thought this would turn out bland, so I added 6 bouillon cubes (I realized there was way to much water for only 3 = flavorless).  I substituted cheddar for the swiss cause that's what I had and I added a touch of cajun seasoning for a little kick.  This soup was really delicious, but it made SO much!!!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I thought it smelled good while it was cooking, but ended up throwing away most of it.  My husband and 2 kids complained that it was watery and bland and would not eat it.  I would not make this recipe again as written, but I wonder what would make it better--definitely more seasonings, and maybe a cheese sauce base to make a smoother, thicker chowder.

Well, the potential for great flavor is definitely here, so I'm not giving up on this one yet.  However, there has got to be a better way to incorporate the cheese so that you don't have goops of it in a rather watery broth, which is what happened for me.  Also, you need more than a "pinch" of salt to bring out the flavor in this soup.  Was hoping for a velvety-textured soup with the cheese well incorporated.  A swiss fondue recipe I have suggests adding a bit of lemon juice so the mixture comes together better--tried it here with no results. Ideas?
