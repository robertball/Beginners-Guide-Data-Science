These were just ok for me. I left out the xanthan gum otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. I think the amount of vinegar should be decreased. It overpowers everything, smell and taste. Thank you to The Beaver Family for sharing your recipe.

These turned out SO good!! I may never go back to regular pancakes. After reading other reviews, I only used 1/2 teaspoon of Xanthum gum and added a 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla extract. The batter was perfect!

Be careful with white vinegar as some are grain based not making this entirely GF if you use the wrong kind.

Made these this morning. Halved the recipe for the two of us, and it was enough. My flour had Xantham Gum added, and i added 1T vinegar to 1C milk, otherwise I made as written. The pancakes were super fluffy, light and tasty. Much less dense than wheat flour pancakes. I’ll be making these again!

These were the best gluten free pancakes I've tried so far.  They were a bit thick but they cooked up fine.  If you find a gritty texture, use the America's Test Kitchen trick and let the batter stand for a few minutes to hydrate the gluten free flours.

I didn't have xanthan gum, and made it without, adding an extra egg. They were more like a crépe and delicious! The second time, I added a mashed banana and blueberries. Tasted awesome!

Great recipe,  yummy pancakes! 
 My family couldn't tell the difference.  I read other reviews and decreased vinegar a little,  increased milk slightly.  I also added blueberries.  we absolutely loved them. Thank you for your recipe.

WOW, this didn't go well!  I used Arrowhead Mills  all purpose baking flour.  It does contain xanthum gum, so I suspect this was my problem.  As soon as I mixed my wet and dry ingredients, the batter turned into one boulder of goo.  I bet I added 3 cups of milk AND a third egg to get  semi-workable batter. I still  had to use the back of a spoon to help it spread on the griddle to cook sufficiently.  The result tastes okay.  I will try without any added xanthum gum next time, and probably add a tsp vanilla.

I have been asked which flour I use, the flour I use is Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour (Gluten Free).  You really need the Xanthan Gum, otherwise the pancakes are way too thin.  Sometimes I need to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk if the batter is too thick.  Bob's Red Mill also carries Xanthan Gum, it's pricey but you use so little the 8oz package will last a very long time.

I used a gluten free flour that already contains xanthan gum. This batter was very goopy as written, perhaps because of the added xanthan gum. Next time I won't add it. I had to add an extra cup of water to this to make it pancakes instead of English muffins--the batter was way too thick otherwise. I used buttermilk powder instead of the soured milk. They tasted great to everyone at the table, gluten free  and not.

Followed the recipe and added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla. Texture reminds me of Cracker Barrel style pancakes.

They were pretty good—made them according to the recipe. It did take them a long time to cook at the temp suggested in the recipe, so I did turn it up (and it was still slow cooking.)

This was a hit with the five people who came for breakfast. Served it with maple syrup and whipped cream.and bacon. The next time, I will add fruit. The only change I made was using half and half instead of milk since I needed to use it up. You need to add a bit more liquid to make it more pour-able. I am going to try it as waffles the next time.

While these pancakes are ok, they are not your typical fluffy pancake. The amount of vinegar  should be reduced, I used 2 TB. I also omitted the xanthan gum because my gluten free flour blend already had it.

I liked that I could use GF flour blend that I already had on hand. I thought the vinegar sounded like too much but I didn't notice the taste in the pancakes. Next time I may reduce that amount just because I think you can without a
affecting the results. And because perhaps others would notice a vinegary taste even though I did not.  The mix was thick, really thick but I went it for the first batch on the griddle. Turned out fine in the end, started our really thick but once off the heat deflated to normal. I did however add more milk and thinned it a bit (abt 1/2 cup more) just to make it easier to  but onto the griddle. They came out just fine also. I liked the taste, I believe most of  a good pancake may start with the cake itself but then it's the good syrup and real butter you put onto it, as well as any fruit topping. So I will make them again. These are for my gluten intolerant grandson who is 5 . I plan to freeze some for quick breakfasts for him.

I started off making the recipe exactly as the recipe states but it was too thick!  I added about 1/2 cup more of milk to thin it out. The kids liked them, me, not so much. Weird gritty texture from the GF flour.

I made these exactly as directed but for a serving of two. Delicious!  I absolutely love these. Will definitely make again.
