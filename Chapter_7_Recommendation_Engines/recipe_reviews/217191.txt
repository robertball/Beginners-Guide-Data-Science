Very tasty combination of flavors, but definitely more "ranch-like" than a true ranch flavor. However it's delicious nonetheless and a great way to perk up your popcorn. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and doubled the recipe. I would definitely make this again and maybe add some dried chives to the mix. Perfect for a low fat snack!

I quadrupled this recipe for a huge family bowl of popcorn and I used half EVOO/half melted butter instead of vegetable. I tossed the air-popped popcorn with the melted butter/EVOO, then sprinkled the seasoning over the top and tossed again. Not quite ranchy but tasty nonetheless. Next time, I'd add chives along with onion powder or Beau Monde. Great for Movie Night made a little healthier.

This is amazing .... so love it....as I eat it and type this review.  Did not add the oil....really don't think it needs it. Added to a bag of Orville Redenbackers Naturals popcorn lightly salted. Added the seasoning to the bag of popped corn and shake away! Nice flavor w/o all of the calories and fat. Hubby and I love it! Thanks!

TASTY!  It only took minutes to put together.  I was worried the vegetable oil would make it too moist but I measured it carefully and mixed it in very thoroughly.  Once the seasonings appeared that they would sprinkle, I added them to a popped bag of microwave popcorn and shook the bag.  I used the whole recipe on one bag of popcorn and it seasoned it nicely.  It was a new TASTY snack for tonight's ballgame that we really enjoyed.  Thank you Leo M. Lalande for sharing your recipe.

i agree with the first reviewer with the taste is very "ranch like" to me anyway my bf said it tasted nothing liked ranch to him but he really liked the flavoring. He told me to make some more tomorrow night! I made a small amount of popcorn and i made the seasoning as is with the oil the spices clumped up and didn't stick to the popcorn that great. i made another batch of seasoning and left the oil out, and just sprayed the popcorn with butter spray and then tossed in the seasoning worked alot better.

LOVE this!  I omit the oil, as I pop on the stove and just add a little extra while popping.  I added a few dashes each of chives and thyme like a previous reviewer suggested.  It's so good that I'm about to make a 25 serving batch and put it in an empty herb container to sprinkle on.  I figure it will be much more convenient this way since this is now a staple for me!

I used air-popped corn and tossed it in melted butter before adding the seasoning mix (omitted oil).  Next time would leave out the pepper and maybe the salt - they overpower the other spices.

Sad to say, didn't like at all! It was very "herby" which is fine. It isn't like the Ranch packets it claims to imitate.

It was great! I would probably leave out the pepper or at least use less since I am using fresh ground pepper. It wasn't clumpy but also didn't stick to the popcorn. Next time I will leave out the oil and put it on the popcorn. I also add extra dill for a more ranch-like flavor!

This is SO good! I added a lot more dill (I'm a dill junkie)and a little more onion powder but even as-is it's delicious. Also I was a little curious about the oil but it gives it the perfect texture to stick to your popcorn. I love this so much I make a huge batch and keep it on top of the microwave at all times. Thank you!

Here is the ultimate combination: garlic powder, cayenne powder, season salt and sometimes premade ranch dressing mix.  I always eyeball it so I don't have a ratio to share.  I would approximate 1 part garlic, season salt, and ranch and 3/4 part cayenne.  Play around with it for your specific tastes. Pop the popcorn, we use the spray butter but use whatever floats your boat, then add as much or as little of the seasoning you like.  There are lots of season combos we've tried but this is my personal favorite.

Definitely didn't taste like one of those popcorn shaker ranch seasonings, and I loved that about this recipe! It was much lighter, and not as tangy as ranch dressing. It had more of a fresh flavor to it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE ranch dressing, but always thought the powdered version was way too overbearing for a popcorn seasoning. I did this without the oil, and put it over a bag of microwave popcorn. Fiancé and I loved it, and will definitely be making a bigger serving to sprinkle on popcorn from now on!

Yummy! I used all spice ingredients with a buttery microwave popcorn so I omitted the olive oil. Will make again!
