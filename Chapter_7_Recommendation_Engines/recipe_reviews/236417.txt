I manage the kitchen in a sports bar. I scoured the internet for recipes for a Superbowl food special. I was a little worried that this burger wouldn't go over to well, I mean who orders a burger with arugula, and aioli in a sports bar? Despite the poor turn out due to crazy weather the burger was a huge hit, I'm running the special all week. (Even though they lost)

Very mellow flavors that compliment each other well. I toasted my bun with a smear of butter. Would definitely make this again.

Great burger!  I added some minced onion to the meat before cooking and also toasted the bun.  The aioli was a huge hit with my husband and daughter. Go hawks!

I used sweet chili sauce, dried shitake mushroom and instant coffee because thats what i have in hand. I didnt put urugula cause im not a fan. layered with cheddar cheese and i used toasted wholemeal burger bun. My husband already asked for another burger this week. Thank for the recipe

My first time making burgers, and what a recipe to start on. Even though I had to substitute some of the ingredients because you can't get them here, it tasted absolutely phenomenal.

So I didn't use the Washington state products but Im sure it would have turned out way more fabulous.  My east coast substitutes sufficed and it was a touchdown in my house.

Delicious! I used low fat mayo and kaiser rolls as a personal preference.  I used both beef and turkey burgers. My husband could not stop saying how great they were. So simple to make, tastes like something that you would order in a restaurant and LOVE!
