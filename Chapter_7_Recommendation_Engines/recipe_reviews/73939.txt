This makes a wonderful hostess gift, especially for those who might otherwise not be familiar with feta or Greek cooking.  A good start for developing those pungent taste buds!  I think I would  include a recipe using feta cheese with this gift, such as spanakopita triangles!

Get ready to pucker because this is pungent!  Great topper for a big old Greek salad.
