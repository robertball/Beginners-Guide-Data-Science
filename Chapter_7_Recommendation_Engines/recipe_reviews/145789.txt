This is great, but I did change the recipe up just a tad.  In place of the fruit juice, I used skim milk w/ a tad of fatfree vanilla pudding mix.  All else remained the same and we loved it as well as the idea of getting in our vegies.

Made as is and it tasted great. Added collard greens for more nutrients. Mint covered up the taste!

This was awesome! We made it with 2 big leaves of mint instead of the suggested amount and it didn't get overpowered by the mint.  This was a refreshing recipe.

Very refreshing! Substituted cran-pomegranate juice for passion fruit & added a tablespoon of orange blossom honey...loved it!

I didn't have passion fruit juice, so I used pink lemonade instead. It tasted really good. I also added some fresh lime juice, which was quite tasty!

My smoothie separated a lot and I had to keep mixing it. I might try blending less or differently next time. 

Tasted great and it was a fun and refreshing way to enjoy fruit & veggies!
