Great recipe for Easter Dinner, we really enjoyed it.  Only comment I would make is 175 is somewhat overdone. However it was still moist and delicious.  Next time I will go for Medium Rare.

Really tasty rub- I used it overnight, and the flavor was just wonderful. I'm going to use it anytime I make lamb.

This was a lovely recipe which went down a treat with all the family - even those who said they didn't like lamb. I didn't change the recipe very much except to insert a couple of cardamom seeds into the slits with the orange peel and also I mixed a little orange juice into the dry ingredients before rubbing it into the lamb - it did marvellous things to the gravy. Also instead of using powdered cardomom I shelled whole cardomom and used the seeds - much more aromatic. Will do this again and again!

Great recipe! I served it yesterday for Easter dinner with Chutney With Mint (from this site). I did all the prep work on Saturday and let it marinate in a zip lock bag overnight - that way, I just stuck it in the oven on Sunday and served. Also, I didn't have seasoned salt and so I used kosher salt instead - it was great!

very easy and tasty lamb to make! I didn't have seasoned salt but it still turned out to have a very flavorful taste. I added dried thyme to the spice rub on top and stuff the lamb with fresh thyme sprigs.  I love cardamom and wished I had tasted that more so next time I make this I will take the advice of a fellow reviewer and stuff the slits with whole cardamom seed. I also didn't taste much of the orange flavor surprisingly unless I was biting into an actual orange peel so I will also top the lamb with some orange juice like the reviewer did.  I also agree with another reviewer - it is definitely done at about 140 degrees. 175 would have been way too overcooked. Once the lamb is removed from the heat, keep in mind the temperature still rises a bit. To give it a little extra crispy crust (because I love crispy outside and tender inside), I broiled the lamb on high for no more than a minute. Hmmm! Perfect finish

I don't know if it was the lack of orange peel (I had run out) or whether the lamb was a strong cut...this was not my family's favorite.  We ate it because it was food I had prepared, but no one wants the leftovers.

I made this, as is, for our New Years Party and everyone loved it!! A few of our guests even said they were worried because they've had bad lamb in the past, but went back for seconds; even the picky kids loved it!! I took my leg of lamb out when the meat thermometer read between 135-140 and it was medium.

This recipe was a big hit. I made it for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was great.

Great combination for spice rub and the orange adds nice floral notes, but don't cook your roast to 175 degrees unless you want a dry, tough peice of meat, 130-140 on an instant read thermometer will give you a perfect medium rare as lamb should be.

To the person who said the lamb was too strong for her family...when you buy it make sure it isn't mutton and not real lamb.  The growth plates on the leg bones should not be calcified yet.  Someone might have passed off mutton on you which is cheaper meat.  Also you might try leg of young goat.  It is milder than lamb even and that is what I used in this recipe.  Only thing is that it doesn't have as much fat on outside so I added some olive oil to the rub and let it sit in fridge over night.

Absolutely fantastic! I made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. I added orange juice to the rub as another reviewer suggested and marinated it overnight. Also, 175 degrees is way overcooked for lamb. Take it out of the oven at around 140 because it will continue to cook after it is taken out. So pleasantly surprised with this recipe. Will definitely make this again!

Very delicious lamb. My family especially enjoyed the citrus kick from the orange peel. I did find a slightly more desirable doneness to 140 degrees F for rare to medium-rare and it was done (from rub to table in less than two hours). Will definitely use this recipe again the next time I roast a lamb.

I used this recipe to cook my first lamb. There were no legs of lamb at the store, so I made do with a lamb shank. It couldn't be easier to make and the lamb was so tender and flavorful! The orange peel really added a nice, subtle extra flavor to the dish. I served it with mint sauce and it was a hit for Easter dinner.

The combination of spices on this was just delicious.  I will probably increase it the next time that I make it, because they gave it such a good flavor.  I plan to use that blend for lamb chops as well.

Made this for Christmas last night. My lamb of leg was boneless and 6lbs. I ended up doubling the seasoning (1 for each side),followed another reviewers advice & squeezed the orange juice & cooked it until the the thermometer read about 145-150 degrees. I also added 2TBS x 2 of olive oil (since I dbl the seasoning) to form a paste for the rub. It was perfect, the taste & texture was just right & compliments all around the table. First time making lamb of leg for me btw. Will be my go to.
