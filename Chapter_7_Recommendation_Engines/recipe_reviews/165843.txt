The only change I made to the recipe was using beef broth rather then chicken. 
It was wonderful! ;-)

You could add drained cooked hamburger to this instead of beef and I chopped my veges in a small quisinart.  I also used rehidrated onion as I forgot onion at the store and 1 T. fresh oregano, fresh parsley. 1 bay leaf.  Made a double batch w/ large crushed tomatoes, I will only use one can next time.  It made two pretty good sized pots.  Next time I will use my 9qt. cast iron pan on low.  Cooked for about 2 hours and could not keep the kids away from it.  It freezes beautifully.

My "I hate vegetables because I'm sure they'll kill me" 11 year old helped make this soup.  He and his 9 year old, "I'll eat SOME veggies unless they're green" brother both loved the smell as it cooked.  I had my 11 year old "try the soup" to see if it was done and he LOVED it.  I added more veggies including chopped fresh spinach and a can of beef chunks from Costco instead of the regular beef.  I'm trying to eat more legumes and this will be on the top of my legume recipe list now!  If the kids will eat it, it's all good!

We absolutely loved this. I modified it only slightly - using part chicken broth and part beef stock, because that's what I had on hand that needed to be used up.  I did not use the cilantro - only parsley.  I only added 1 cup of lentils, which was plenty for the amount of stock that I added.  In the end, it was more like a stew.  I served it over ditalini pasta with crusty french bread on the side. Delicious!

A fantastic combination! The beef and lentils go so well together. This recipe is a real winner - no changes needed, although I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth like many other reviewers. As with many soups/stews, it's even better the second day.

I followed other reviews and used beef and vege broth instead of chicken.  I added some frozen corn and peas as well as about 2T Worcestershire.  Also, I didn't have enough lentils on hand so I did half lentils/ half barley.  I'll definitely make it again.

This was a great Fall dinner.  I changed the recipe up a bit and used Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of the beef.   I did cut the garlic back to 3 cloves (my garlic cloves were really big) and used beef broth instead of chicken.  Everyone loved it, so much so that I had trouble saving a bit for lunch the next day.  I thought the family was going to start licking the pot.

I did not make the soup exactly because I had different ingredients but it came out great. I used crushed tomatoes instead of fresh diced tomatoes. I also added a beef bouillon cube. I also added about 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and two bay leaves since I had them. Lastly, I threw it all in my slow cooker for 5 hours on high.

One of my all time favorite soups! I do make a few alterations when I make this but I stick pretty close to the over all idea of the recipe (I use veggie broth vs. chicken, do not like cilantro or celery, use veggie meat instead of real). This recipe shows me that some of the real winners on this site do not necessarily have hundreds or thousands of reviews. This is a real hidden gem!

I am not a usually a lentil fan, but this is spectacular! I use extra lean ground beef or ground sirloin instead of the chuck. I also use a combination of beef broth and chicken (about a 2:1 ratio). Brilliantly flavourful. Thanks so much for sharing!

Yummy!  Omitted celery.  I used a pound of dry lentils, only because when I measured out 2 cups it only left about 1/3 cup in the bag, and what am I going to do with 1/3 cup dry lentils?  Used beef broth.  Did not have oregano or cilantro; used thyme and marjoram instead.   Next time will probably add more meat, less liquid, and serve more as a stew.  Lentils were good, but the meat was outstanding.  Will make beer bread next time - seems like this would be a great pairing.

This recipe is truly a hidden gem! I made it to the specifications except for the fact that I used beef broth as all of the other reviewers mentioned. While it was so delicious the day I made it, it was even more delicious the day after!!

40 minutes to cook lentils in a simmer just wasn't long enough.  The soup was tasty, but with kinda hard lentils, it bombed...

Very good. First time I used lentils. I used beef broth and Ground beef because that was what was available and added a box of frozen spinach. I also added a dash of chili powder. It was perfect on such a chilly day! definitely a keeper.

I use beef and veg broth instead of chicken and barley instead of lentils. I didn't have lentils on hand the first time I made it and the barley is perfect! I love this recipe and it's a definite staple in my house.

I loved this soup! It was full of flavor! I will definitely be making this a regular. I did not change anything except I did not have cilantro or oregano, so substituted dried parsley and marjoram and omitted the fresh parsley at the end. So worth the wait!!!!

My family LOVED this recipe!  We followed others advice (and the picture!) and put it over pasta, which we enjoyed.  The meat was tender as were the lentils and the flavor was absolutely wonderful.  We will be putting this in the dinner rotation for sure!

I made this soup with my leftover standing rib roast from Christmas dinner.  It was hearty, tastey and easy to make.  Like others suggested, I used beef broth instead of chicken. I also left out the celery.  I would make this again.

Perfect for a cold January night! I made some of my own beef stock w/ my leftover Christmas Prime Rib roast. I didn't have lots of meat, but the flavors were great. A can of crushed tomatoes worked well since I was out of diced. I also used fresh cilantro and a splash of red wine in my bowl just because I had some. A good Balsamic vinegar would also be tasty. The parm on top was excellent. Leftovers for tomorrow! Yeah!

Yum! When I read the recipe, it seemed like an odd combination of herbs, but it was really good.  I used ground beef, just because that was what I had on hand.  I'll add some more broth to the leftovers, though, because it doesn't seem to have enough left.

I gave this 4 stars because it took about 12 hours on "hi" for my lentils to become tender.  I actually had to scrap this for dinner that night because it wasn't done.  (Next time I will follow another reviewer's suggestion to add the tomatoes later in the process.)  I saved this in the fridge for another night and the leftovers were definitely 5 stars!  This is the best lentil dish I've ever made.  Next time, I will either cook it on the stove, so I have more control over the heat, or I will boil my stock and water before adding it so it doesn't take so long to start cooking the lentils.  The smoky flavor of the kielbasa really blends with the spices and lentils to make a delicicous stew!

My husband and I really like eating this soup, but we made some changes to it that we think make it taste MUCH better and have more flavor. The changes we made are as followed: 1. We changed the chicken broth to beef broth (why chicken when you are cooking beef?) and added 2 cups more since the lentils absorb so much of the broth.  2. We also halved the lentils put in to make the soup more liquid and less lentil thick. 3. We added kale and red cabbage at the end to add some really nice crunch and texture to the soup.

Thanks for this recipe, it is Delicious!  My changes were:
Reduced lentils to one cup and cooked them separately in water and beef broth.  Add lentils with liquid to beef and tomato mixture later.  
Upped beef to 1 1/2 pounds
Changed chicken broth to beef broth and only used one 32oz box.  
Cooked beef, tomato, broth combo for an hour before adding cooked lentils, then cooked on slow simmer another half hour, uncovered.  
Increased garlic and oregano amounts.

I made a half batch, tossing all ingredients in the slow cooker for about 5 hours.  I also used beef broth instead of chicken and things turned out wonderfully!  Reheats very well so it's great for lunches.

So great! Made it twice it was so nice. I used my pressure cooker to make this and in half the time!

Pressure cooking instructions: After browning meat, cooking the veggies, seasoning, adding stock and lentils; close lid and get to pressure, rocking for 4 min. Cool immediately. Remove veggies and lentils. Put meat in stock and build to pressure. Rocking for 15 min, let pressure drop on its own accord. Then put the veggies and lentils back in the stock and you're done!

Cheap, tasty, and easy. I used beef bullion and water in place of chicken broth. My husband said I could keep practicing with this one, and went to get another bowl. :)

Made as recipe stated with exception of using beef broth instead of chicken broth as other reviewers had suggested.  Meat was tender and the flavor was nice but nothing spectacular.  I would use about half the lentils called for - there were definitely more of them than anything else - and increase the veggies.

It was super delicious, but i had a problem with the liquid. In 30 min after the beef etc were added the soup became too thick and started sticking to the pan, so that i had to add water twice. Also added cumin which i love.

Good base recipe....just needs a lot more flavor than just salt pepper and oregano...I ended up putting thyme, Italian and a little bit of creole and cayenne to give it some real flavor

Came out great. I did use beef broth instead of the chicken. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  The recipe made a big pot of soup and since it's just my husband and myself I froze the leftovers and will get at least 2 more meals out it.

Reminded me a lot of what my mom used to make so I added whatever else she did put like chorizo and potatoes, and I have to say that a lot of the flavour comes indeed from the chorizo. Use fresh cilantro for a stronger herby flavour, and please do not add cheese when you serve it, it might overpower an already tasty dish. Very simple to make!

I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth and diced up a couple of fresh jalapeños with the veggies. We like everything with a little heat.

I made this last winter and am excited to be making it again. Used half chicken half veggie broth, sirloin tips, minced garlic instead of fresh, added a bit of onion powder, some bite size potato pieces, and a dash cayenne, and will add fresh spinach and arugula at the end or  mix it in as I serve it. would have added a beef bouillon if I had one. Great recipe!

Delicious! I’ll make it again. I didn’t have broth, so I used water and used a package of lentils trio. I also replaced the salt & pepper with Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning blend, couldn’t use cayenne pepper :(, added some turmeric and anise seeds and used leeks instead of onion. Made some Bisquick Cheese and Garlic biscuits, and of course ate too much, lol!

I wonder if this would do well in a crockpot all thrown in at once. Its too late to wait for opinions because the deed is done. I will have to see how it goes. I also added some mushrooms, and beef boullion , fresh tomatoes instead of in the can.

Turned out very good.  It makes a lot. I froze half and plus had lunches for 2 days.  I made it according to recipe except used sirloin steak that I need to use and beef broth made from my leftover bone rib roast from christmas.  I did not cook the first hour as had a more tender cut of meat but added all the ingredients at once.  I also did not have the cilantro.

Amazing and flavorful beef lentil soup! I did what another reviewer suggested and added a beef bouillon cube, used beef broth and added 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Love this recipe! I did substitute beef broth for the chicken, used browned and drained ground beef instead of stew meat, (first time I made it I used browned and drained ground  venison, it was AMAZING!), We are not garlic fans so I left that ingredient out, I found that I needed to add about 20 more minutes to get the lentils tender enough. My husband said it was possibly the best soup he'd ever had !

Everyone that I shared this with loved it as a warm comfort food. But this has amazing flavor and just enough beef to make the lentils meaty and the dish a great main dish as well.

This soup was so good that we have made it a permanent in our table. My family has requested so many time that now I over make the soup and freeze it so that we can eat it again the following week.

Delicious! Only change I made was all fresh herbs and I added 2 parsnips and splash of Worchester shire sauce.

I love this beef and Lentil soup and my husband did also. That is a huge deal since he is very picky.

Very nice flavours.  I was looking for a veg or chicken soup and liked the ingredient combo for this recipe, so used chicken instead of beef and instead of lentils about a cup of mixed grains/beans I had on hand.  Also skipped the cheese.  It is a great base for a soup and I will try the exact recipe as I like lentils.  This should be great for beef barley as well,

5 stars for the flavor!  So good - one less because it is not 8 servings- way more.  Maybe treble.  I added 32 oz. of chicken broth to make it more like soup.  I will definitely make this again.  It's a great recipe to make and share!

I made a few changes to spices according to my taste.  My kids actually asked for seconds!
