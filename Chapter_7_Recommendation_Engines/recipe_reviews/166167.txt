This was delicious and very flavorful! I tripled it and used whole wheat couscous and reduced fat feta. I ate it warm for lunch and served it cold for a side at a BBQ. Perfect both ways. I didn't have dressing so I just did 2 parts olive oil to like 1.5 parts balsamic vinegar and a couple cloves of minced garlic. This was pretty garlicky so I wouldn't suggest you doing that unless you don't have dressing :) Thanks for a truly great recipe ~ this will be a staple this summer.

overall I enjoyed this dish. The combination of feta and cranberries is wonderful however I did not care for the balsamic dressing. Next time i may try some olive oil and maybe a splash of lemon instead of the balsamic

Very wonderful flavor. You need to cut the water in half though, it should be a 1:1 ratio between cous cous and water, even with the dried cranberries. Also, I subbed cropped spinach for cucumbers and it was delicious.

Delicious!! I used Trader Joe's Harvest Grains blend with Israeli couscous, orzo, baby garbanzos, and red quinoa. I added walnuts for a little more protein, and used just a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

This was a really nice side dish to have with some chicken. Next time I will add a bit more balsamic and serve it alongside a lamb main as I think the flavours would meld together nicely.

Delicious, super easy and colorful. Made about 6 times the recipe with one large cucumber. That was enough cuke for us. Used fat free feta (about 8 oz.) and 3T lemon infused olive oil and 1T pomegranate balsamic vinegar. The pomegranate blended with the cranberry and the lemon gave it a punch. Added 1/2 cup toasted pecans for crunch. Will be on my "make again" list.

Ths is a "first cousin" to the classic Tabouleh... Excellent. I added some chopped walnuts and a little lemon juice.
Great side dish for moorish style chicken kebabs!

I made this recipe as presented. Although my family enjoys couscous, and I make several different couscous salads, the flavors in this one didn't please our palates at all. I think it was the dressing. The balsamic vinaigrette seemed to overpower the whole dish. Maybe it would be better for us with a lighter dressing.

Extremely easy, healthy dish. I've made it a few times in the last few weeks and eaten it cold for days after making. It's simple and good. Not AWESOME, but definitely worth a try.

I tossed the cranberries with the feta/cucumber because I wanted to keep them chewy, and I added some sliced almonds for more texture.  Good side salad or I ate the whole serving for dinner.

My family loves this dish. The first time I made it I noticed that it was quite dry so I added a decent amount of garlic infused olive oil. That made it 5 stars!

I am new to couscous and have tried a couple recipes - I absolutely loved this one!  BF said he could have gone with fewer cranberries, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing!  And SO easy to throw together - this is staying in the recipe file, definitely!  we did agree it was screaming for some kind of acid or brightness, may try adding something next time...

This was ok.  I think I may have not made the coucous wront but I just did not think it had enough flavor.  I am going to try again with a different kind of coucous and see what happens.

This recipe had good points but also tasted plain. I liked how the cranberries plumped when cooked in the hot water with the couscous. I got dried cherries and cranberries mixed and that was great. I added chickpeas to this to make it a more main dish type of salad and add protein. I used lemon juice instead of balsamic. Overall, however, it did seem plain and we would not make this again, but did eat it all up.

Served as a side dish for a Thanksgiving dinner- needed something I could serve cold since I was camping with a large group.  Maybe it was because I made it early, but it was tasteless and very little of it was eaten.

This is a great couscous recipe. I don't like tabouleh and was looking for something to do with couscous other than cooking it in chicken stock.  I like the way the flavors pop.

Easy and delicious! Next time I might add a bit of finely shredded carrot. Only tip is to be sure that your cuke is diced quite small, to match the size of the raisen bits, otherwise it's a bit awkward to chew. Thanks for the great recipe!

Sorry.  I've never given a bad review before, but I really didn't care for this recipe.

Thank you for a rockin' recipe. I love the light, fresh flavor of this dish. This one has quickly become a family favorite, especially for me because I LOVE how easy it is to make.

I love all the component parts, but the feta/dried cranberry combination didn't taste right to me.  I will make it again & sub sliced almonds for the cranberries.

I enjoyed this and served it over spinach. I'd make it again as I love how easy and fast it is. I made my own dressing with balsamic vinegar, olive oil and garlic salt.

This was a great recipe.  I added some roasted almonds for crunch, a bit of fresh basil.  I used a balsamic glaze from Wegmans and a bit of olive oil.

I add half a fresh squeezed lemon and I used basil infused olive oil and strawberry balsamic because I had it. I eat it hot or cold and enjoy the leftovers for days.

I really like this recipe. To add more protein, I added some cannellini beans and drizzled a balsamic reduction over this yummy dish. SO. GOOD.

This was surprisingly delicious! I used a whole box of couscous but only about half of a cucumber. The cranberries gave it a perfect amount of tart sweetness and the feta balanced it all out. I tried this warm, without the dressing and it was amazing. I served it cold, along with butternut squash soup and applebutter glazed pork loin and it was amazing! I made my own balsamic vinaigrette that I drizzled on top after serving it so that it didn't drown and overpower the flavor of the couscous. It was eaten by all but 1 of my 5 kids and the adults all had seconds. This will definitely be a regular on my menu.

We just made this for dinner at my bf's mom's house. We, too, substituted Spanish for cucumber and it came out great! We are going to let everyone put their own dressing! Thanks for a great recipe!
