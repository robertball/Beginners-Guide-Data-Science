As written, definayely four - with a few minor changes 5+++!

I sauteed the onion until deep golden brown, (we LOVELOVELOVE carmelized onions) plus sauteed the zucchini a little - it's crunchy otherwise.  I also added more cheese than was called for.
The "impossible pies" from the back of the box call for 2/3 c mix, 3/4 c milk and 2 eggs - so that's the topping that I used.
I've made this 1000 times with 1000 different fillings - any cheese wotrks, most any veggie in most any combo.  It's also good with chopped cooked meats!  This is a terrific basic "starter".  Thanks!

This is a very nice dish to make!  I sliced my garden grown zucchini, sauted them a few minutes with onions, garlic and shredded carrots.  I then added the parmesan cheese, the spices I put in are: paprika for colour, fresh parsley, celery salt, onion powder and black pepper.  The smell is heavenly when it's baking!  I sprinkled some grated cheese on the top for the finishing touch!  Great hit with my family!

This is a very simple recipe that is helping to use the abundance of zucchini that we have this time of year.  I added fresh marjorum, fresh basil & a chopped jalapeno pepper for added flavor.  Delicious!

This was a quick and delicious recipe. I added a little bit of dried basil to spice it up a touch and used Asiago cheese instead of the Parmesan. Highly recommended!

i read all the reviews and sauted-ed(?) onion, garlic, succhini and tomatoes,adjusted spices but the bottom line is: it's very dry....i guess that's what you can expect using a bisquit baking mix.  will not make again.

Followed everything to a tee and ended up with soggy veggies and a giant biscuit like thing on top. Would never make again.

I followed the recipe ingredients, but I sauted the vegetables first, as suggested by other reviewers.  It turned out OK, but I wouldn't make it again.  For my taste, there were not enough vegetables in the recipes for the amount of the breading.  I might consider doubling the vegetables and adding additional spices, but wouldn't recommend the recipe as written.

This recipe was very easy and very quick! My husband LOVED it!! I didn't care for the onion-y taste, but I'm not an onion fan. Next time I think I will cut down on the amount of onions and put more tomatoes. But is was tasty and a good idea.

This was very easy and tasty! I added fresh mushrooms and a little cheddar cheese but that was the only change I made. I, too sauteed my onions and zucchini beforehand like others suggested. Good idea;it was really a nice, meatless supper.

Great base recipe.  I rated it four stars not for flavor (you can't screw up garden vegetables or call them bland in my opinion!) but method; I think it's necessary to saute onions and zucchini before putting it in the oven.  I added red pepper flakes and garam masala and am glad I did.

This was great!  It was a quick, delicious and meat free meal.  I used canned plum tomatoes, they worked well, they tasted so good with the Parmesan cheese. I cooked veggies in a fry pan before adding to pie pan.   Will definitely make again.  Thanks VEGAS

Did not have any red tomato's on hand so made with a yellow one.  Also did not have a pie pan so i made in a regular square one.  Added some garlic as i thought it seemed like it could use some.  Very easy and tasty!

Very good!  I sometimes use pepperoni bits or sausage that I have sauteed in this pie.  ALWAYS saute your zucchini first to take some of the liquid out of it.  Mozzerella is a nice addition, too.

This was not earth-shattering, but very good!!  I'll make this again.  I used the "easy biscuit mixture" recipe on this site for the baking mix.  I sauteed the zucchini (of which I used about a cup extra) and onion prior to cooking with about a clove's worth of minced garlic.  I also combined everything in a bowl, plus parsley and paprika, before putting it in the pan so the veggies would be mixed well.  It turned out great!

I think this is a good recipe for breakfast-- it is very much like an omelet 
and would be good if you had several people to feed for breakfast.  I added
italian seasonings and Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning, a little bell pepper,
a little cheddar cheese; served with hash browns.  Good breakfast!

5 stars - we added 1/2 c shred Monterrey jack in addition to the Parmesan cheese; 4oz sliced can mushrooms. Red onion. Tossed in some dry spices: garlic powder and onion powder.  Pouring the egg / milk mixture caused it to run over the top so I dumped the whole think in a bowl, mixed lightly and then poured back into the pie tin. Sprinkled with dry parsley & S&P. We are at high altitude and had to cook it an additional 7-8 minutes to cook the middle fully. *** not strong flavors, so it complimented entree well.

Good creamy texture, but could use a little more flavor.  I'd consider adding some diced ham next time.

With some modifications, this recipe is easily 5 stars.  I saute the zucchini and onion until slightly browned.  This makes the veggies not as crunchy, which is what I prefer in this dish.  I also add more seasoning: I sprinkle the top with Italian seasoning, pepper, and a little salt.  I use the Bisquick box recipe for the dough portion.  I also sometimes make a double batch and put it in a 13x9 pan and cook it until it's golden brown on top.  Great to take to work for lunch throughout the week!

I've made this twice. Made slight changes the second time. The bisquick mix was bland when not eaten with a bite of vegetable, so I added the parm cheese salt and pepper to the mix after I beat it. (rather than on the veggies). I used frozen chopped onions (defrosted before adding to dish. 1/2 cup was to much, so I decreased second time.) Much "lighter" than a quiche.

This was incredibly good and easy.  I keep getting huge tomatoes and zucchini from our CSA, and am always looking for different things to try.  My daughter and I added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 5 strips of crushed up crispy bacon, and we added about 1/2 cup mixed shredded parmesan and asiago cheese.  A definite keeper!

I used frozen, grated zucchini I had in my freezer to make this dish.  When I measured, it was not 2 cups worth, so I added chopped broccoli to make up the difference.  I also used the Heart Smart Bisquick.  This made a very light, low-cal dinner for our meatless night.

This is going to be called "garden pie" at my house. I had broccoli from the garden and added that (chopped) to the vegetables. I used swiss cheese because that is what I had on hand. It made four very generous servings. One adult male who swears he doesn't like zucchini ate it and one adult male who swears he doesn't like swiss cheese ate it. Together they finished off the pie for dinner.

I love this recipe, because you can play around with it and add different veggies and spices.  Some suggested sauteing the veggies first, but I liked it much better adding them raw.  It's important to monitor the cooking time the first time you make it.  For me, 30 minutes at 400 was too long.  I had to turn the temperature down to 375 halfway thru, and even then, it only took 25 minutes.

Agree with the others. Saute your veggies first, add some herbs. And double the amount of veggies, or you're left with a really bready dish.
I think next time, I'll add some cooked potatoes to this. I think that would be great.

Excellent!  Great to bring to work for a healthy lunch.  I sauted the veggies first as others suggested, and added some fresh mushrooms.  Will definately be adding this one to the keeper file. Thanks!

So disappointed in this recipe! I really liked the idea of this dish. I had a ton of zucchini and a ton of tomatoes, so why not bake them into a delicious pie, right? Wrong! The biggest thing that made this recipe not good was the tomatoes. I didn't like the texture of them or the taste once they were baked in. And the rest of it together was just pretty bland and meh.  Since, like I said, I really loved the idea of this recipe, I tried it again with some changes. First, I left out the tomato. I replaced them with mushrooms and sautéed them with the zucchini and onion with a little olive oil and some garlic pepper. I added crumbled bacon to the veg mixture and then baked with the crust/cheese as directed. After that, it was a top notch recipe! But as is, not good.

Add garlic and shredded cheese (in the batter and on top) and this is excellent.

I just made this for dinner tonight since I have an abundance of zucchini in my garden. My husband and I both loved it and I would definitely make it again. The only change I made to the recipe was adding some fresh herbs to the vegetables. I added some fresh basil, oregano and rosemary and stirred it up with the veggies. Great recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe. There weren't enough vegetables to me and the biscuit layer was very bland. I would not make this again.

This recipe is certainly very easy to make. I made it with shredded cheddar rather than parmesan. It was bland, so I served it with pico de gallo which livened it up a little.  I would make it again, but would add a little jalapeno next time, or shredded "taco" cheese.

Fantastic recipe. Used squash but sautéed it with onions and garlic first. Also, followed the 2 eggs, 3/4 c milk and 2/3 c baking mix tip. Delicious and easy to make!

This was pretty good. I used up zucchini and tomatoes from my garden to make it. It is a light, tasty meal.  The only thing I would do differently is I would add more spices, it needed a bit more flavor.

Excellent!!  I could not stop eating it.  Good thing it's not too unhealthy.  The only change I made was to cook the zucchini slightly beforehand.  Oh and I also forgot the cheese until the last minute and had to sprinkle it on top of the batter but I don't think that changed anything.

Love this recipe.  If you chop your veggies, no need to waste time precooking as some have suggested.  I make as is and add a cup of cheddar in addition to parmesan.  Very quick and easy and tastes great.

Not bad but not great...a little watery and not much flavor...needs seasonings. I'll have to try this one again with some changes, nice starter though.

I sauteed the onion & zucchini until browned.  I also stirred chopped fresh basil (about 5 large leaves) into the batter, as I had some leftover from something else.  Everything else I left alone, it didn't come out dry as some said, it was like a cross between a biscuit and a quiche texture.  Yummy, will do again, perhaps add browned sausage and make it the whole meal.

Very Good. Instead of biscuit mix I used the Homemade Pancake Mix also found on this site.  I also followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the veggies and added mushrooms. This recipe is a good base with endless possibilities.

Tasty stuff - I used cheddar because we were out of parmesan, also added thyme and rosemary.  Would love to try this with goat cheese added.  This recipe is super adaptable - and easy as pie.  Ha.
EDIT: I just made this again with tomato & mushroom.  AMAZING!

This was a really yummy and attractive side dish.  I made a few changes as per other reviewers' suggestions...sauteed the zucchini, onions and really good garden tomatoes in olive oil with plenty of dried basil, oregano, salt & pepper.  Also added a cup of old cheddar cheese to the mix, then sprinkled some on top and put a few thinly sliced tomatoes on top as well.  The result looked and tasted great.  Loved the texture.  This is a simple recipe but there's a lot you could do with it...I'd love to try it with mexican spices another time.  Will make again.

This is great! I used crumbled goat cheese instead of parmesan which gave it a rich tangy flavor.

Pretty good.....I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil, then added the zucchini and tomatoes, salt,pepper and a sprinkle of oregano. Placed the veggies in a sprayed pie plate and covered with about 1c. of a 4 cheese pizza blend, and used reduced fat bisquick with the wet ingredients. I also added about 10-15 fresh basil leaves chopped to the wet mixture. The basil definately makes it. Hubby thought it was kinda dry....maybe because of the low fat bisquick......I thought it was pretty good. I will add more veggies next time, but the flavor was  great. Will make again.

Really good way to use up all the zucchini and tomatoes in the garden, even my husband liked it.  I added 1 clove of garlic too, because I love garlic, and it was really good.  I sauted the zucchini, onion & garlic as recommended first before putting in with the tomato too.

This is really good, although the first time I made it we thought it was a bit bland.  When I made it the next time I added some crumbled bacon and finely chopped jalapeno pepper.  Oh my, what a difference!  I will be making this again and again.  There are probably endless ways to adapt it to your family's taste buds.

Made it many times. Love it.  You can add pre-cooked ground beef or sausage if you like to make it more hearty.  Also you could add some shredded cheddar  or top it with french fried onions or I like french fried jalapeno pepper topping.  LOADS of ways to dress this up

I adjusted this down to a 4 serving pie and was amazed after weighing and measuring out all my ingredients it came out to only 136 calories per 1/4. I ate 1/2 the pie for lunch and I'm stuffed. I would give it over 5 stars if I could. The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 Tbsp of minced garlic to the veggie mixture. It was truly amazing!

WOW!  We had some family over for dinner and my original plan was lasagne with homemade sauce but the "guest list" grew.  I decided to try this as a nice side dish.  The tomatoes really did the trick!  I will say that I added one cup of parmesan cheese and used pancake mix instead of biscuit mix.  Came out wonderfully and none leftover!  Cannot wait to make this again!!

Used fresh veggies from my garden. Also added some fresh herbs for flavor. Didn't have biscuit mix so made my own. I should have cooked a little longer at a lower temperature since I use a convection oven.

I used fresh tomatoes and zucchini from my neighbor's garden and it was delicious. Using the biscuit mix made it really easy. It was fluffy and delectable.

Zucchini Tomato Pie Haiku: "Too bread-ey, too dry. We love to eat zucchini, it was lost in this." We felt that the zucchini and tomatoes were over-shadowed by a thick poofy layer of biscuit mix; I made the recipe as directed except I used a can of diced Italian-style tomatoes that should've added more flavor or moisture, but overall this dish was just a-OK, but required hot sauce and salt; glad we tried!

Sautéed zucchini, onions, garlic and carrots.  Added shrimp and tomatoes.  Put the bisquick mixture over the top (in the same skillet) and popped it in the oven.  Realized I forgot the cheese, so added it to the top in the last ten minutes.  Yummy!  We ate the entire thing!!!

Liked the concept but it was a bit "breadier" than I had imagined.  Good flavor though.  I baked it about 20 mins longer than recipe stated to fully solidify the center.

I added shredded cheddar, extra leftover veggies we had, extra egg, herbs and did as others suggested - I sauteed the onion and zukes in olive oil with 2 small minced garlic cloves. The result? EXCELLENT. My tomatoes were sliced thin instead of diced and I also sliced my zucchini after taking all the seeds out first. So happy it turned out so well b/c this is going to be a meatless dinner for my meat-loving husband!

You can make this recipe gluten free by substituting the biscuit mix with instant corn masa mix and baking 10 minutes longer.

This was so good! Made a great brunch item. I sautéed the veggies first to cook out some of the water, added a clove of crushed garlic and some bell pepper. I also used a bit less of the baking mix and eggs - 1/2 c each of baking mix and milk, and 2 eggs. You do have to let it sit 5-10 mins to help it firm up.

A little bland but could easily be perked up by adding another ingredient.  Mine baked well...not too wet or dry...and had a beautiful appearance.  Followed directions but lightly patted tomatoes with a paper towel before mixing with other ingredients.  Rate 4 stars.

I wanted to love this, I really did. It's just so bland! At the very least it needs some melted cheddar or mozzarella on top or mixed in. But mostly, it needs alot more herbs & spices. Maybe some Italian seasoning, or something. I didn't have time to read all the reviews, but this same recipe is on Betty Crockers website so I figured I couldn't go wrong! I probably will make it again, with some tweaking. Thanks for the recipe, though..we still ate it, so that says something I guess!

I grated 2 zucchini and sauteed with tomatoes, onion and garlic.  Used 1/4 cup parm cheese and 1/4 romano cheese.  Made homemade bisquick mix from this site.  Used southwest style egg beaters.  This was fantastic!

This was really tasty! Only 4 stars because I had to tweak it for the consistency I liked.  I sauteed the onions in olive oil (butter would also work), then added the zucchini so it wouldn't be crunchy, and added some fresh garlic to the sautee. I squeezed out the excess moisture too once it cooled a bit, so it wouldn't be watery as some people noticed.  I didn't have parmesean so I added flavors with herbs instead - fresh basil and I wasn't too shy with the salt, plus I added an egg and used a tbs of lemon juice with the milk to make it "sour".  Baked it in mini muffin tins to make personal sized pies. It disappeared within minutes of serving it at a party!

This was ok.  The idea is good and I think I'll play around with filling ideas.  I used a previous reviewer's suggestion and followed the box for incredible pies for the crust.  It was ok, good for a quick meal but just not something I would ever rave about.

This was very good, but next time, I'm going to add some fresh basil (forgot this time) and maybe other herbs, too.  It was just a tad lacking in flavor, but not irremediably.  I used a biscuit mix recipe from this site, and that worked well.

I'll be keeping this one. As written it's good, but has worlds of possibilities for additions. I added some shredded cheddar. My husband suggested adding some chicken next time. Thanks for a keeper!

I added some garlic and red pepper flake, I think it would have been bland without adding something.  Next time I think I will add some cheddar cheese... nice side dish though.

This was good, but the zucchini wasn't done enough to suit me.  I would steam it quickly before putting it in the pie.  Also, sprinkled some parmesan on top before baking.

I really liked this dish.  It was very easy and tasted quite good. I used cheddar cheese instead of parm and mostly summer squash, cause I had more. I've made it a couple of times since--works nice as leftovers.

This was a very interesting way to use up zucchini. Would be a great side dish for a brunch. Will make this again and possibly shred my zucchini.
