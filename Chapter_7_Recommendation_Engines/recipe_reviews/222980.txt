I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  For the shortbread crust I mixed 1/2 cup of softened butter with 1 Cup flour and 1/4 powdered sugar until it was crumbly then patted it into a tart pan.  Bake for about 25 minutes at 350.  The cream cheese layer needed a little sweetening - I would add a couple of tablespoons of powdered sugar to it.  As for the glaze, I didn't want it chunky so a used a hand held blender to puree the strawberries in the pan - it was still to chunky so I ran the sauce through a fine mesh sieve and the glaze was perfect and glossy.  I will make this again - it is beautiful.

Hi!  This is like my mom's recipe from '70s.  The mashed mixture of cooked strawberries isn't suppose to be smooth.  This is different from the packaged strawberry glazes that you can buy.  A little more rustic I guess.  After the glaze is cooked, it will look like strawberry jam.  Hope everyone enjoys this pie because I sure do!

I loved this and it was a big hit after a summer bbq!
I followed the review that suggested adding icing sugar to the cream cheese - added about 1/3 of a cup. Also used sugar cookie dough to create the crust.

My husband has fond memories of this pie from a previous neighbour. I had to make some changes for my family's preferences though. I live in Canada, I couldn't find a premade shortbread crust, I used the Joy of Baking's recipe for it. I don't have a tart pan, I used my 9 inch springform instead. My son doesn't eat cream cheese, I used President's Choice Dark Chocolate sauce instead. I had to add about 3/4 cup of water to the strawberry sauce, it was way too thick, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup which was good for us, I used my immersion blender to puree. Next time I will use 1 tbsp cornstarch and sieve the sauce as Baking Nana did for a nicer presentation. It was enjoyed by all but I didn't like the cloudiness of the sauce.

I love this recipe! I used to make it from a Pies Recipe book from WAY back but I can’t find the book after our major renovation. One thing we love about this pie is the chunky glaze- (make sure to boil it until it turns from cloudy to clear and add water if it’s too thick) and the plain unsweetened cream cheese base which keeps this a mildly sweet dessert!  Another variation that’s even better than the strawberry version is made exactly the same way but with blueberries. (Purée the sauce with an immersion blender). And I just make a regular tender flake pie crust.

OMG this is so good.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I only changed one thing and that was to add 1/3 c powered sugar to the cream cheese as someone else suggested.  It was perfect with fresh strawberries.

I first made this pie in 1972.  It was a  big hit every time I made it.  I somehow lost the recipe and just recently found it on All recipes.  It is a so good!

This pie tasted really good but I had trouble with the cooked strawberries setting. I may not of cooked it long enough so make sure that if you make it that you cook it long enough so that it gets thick . Delicious .
