Stupid good ! Cut everything in half, and it still worked great ! Added some large chunks of celery and a small can of tomato paste for more savory flavor - will add carrots and some soy sauce next time. Served over rice, delish and so easy !

I tried this recipe for Father's day and it was a hit!  I used pork ribs instead of the beef, and threw them on the barbecue grill for 4 minutes each side before slow-cooking.

Most recipes on "allrecipes.com" are excellent. Made this one according to recipes, but was not great.

My family didn't like this recipe enough for me to make it again.  The meat was very tender but the sauce wasn't very flavorful and was very runny.

I made it with pork ribs also, which I don't eat, but my boyfriend does and he absolutely loves this recipe.  He liked it so much he requested it again, which is amazing for a man who's generally indifferent about how his meat is prepared.

It was delicious!! My whole family loved it, even the 5 year old :) I will definitely make it again!! I served it on rice. Also the dog loved the bones and the leftover juice over his dinner ;)

This was so quick, easy, and tasty.  I also used pork ribs, like the last reviewer.  Well make this gain for a crowd.  Thanks for sharing.

A great change to standard ribs. Everyone loved them.
