This was exactly what 3 stars says, "It was OK".  I was looking forward to this combination, but found it to be a bit sweet for our taste.  Everything in this recipe was screaming for me to add cheddar cheese.  I DID add the cheese, but not until after I'd sampled it as written.  The cheese didn't change much, but I did prefer it WITH cheese as to without.  This is definately worth giving a try to use leftover ham, it simply wasn't our taste.  THANKS for the recipe!

I can't rate this recipe based on these ingredients given - since I made a few changes that wouldn't be fair. 
I had leftover ham that needed to be used, so I improvised.  
I wasn't sure if the mustard was prepared or dry, so I opted for dry since I didn't have brown.  I used cracker crumbs and butter for the topping (no breadcrumbs) I also used probably 3/4 c more milk then called for. I omitted the apples as I thought the combination wouldn't work, but after tasting it I think it may have added another flavour dimension.
The flavour was interesting, good but not like anything I've tasted before. I may make it again if I find myself with more leftover ham.
