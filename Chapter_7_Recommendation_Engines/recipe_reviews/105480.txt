These cookies were incredible!! A few alterations: we used the Splenda brown sugar instead of the regular brown sugar (1/4 cup, as the conversion chart says) and we took a suggestion from another review and added 1/4 cup of boiling water to the batter. Putting the boiling water in after everything was mixed together caused some of the chocolate chips to start melting. My mom said that next time she was going to put the boiling water in before the chocolate chips. After eating these cookies where the water was put in after, I say use your best judgement. THESE COOKIES ROCK!!!

Really good - at least on the first day, we'll see how they are tomorrow!  I used butter instead of margarine, melted it and stirred in the peanut butter for more chewiness.

My boyfriend is Diabetic. I made these for him and gave some to my dad too, who is not Diabetic.  They both LOVED them.  I did vary the recipe a little.  Instead of peanut butter I used reeces chips in the same amount, and dark chocolate chips in place of the baking choc, in the same amount.  I also used Splenda brown sugar blend in place of the brown sugar and butter in place of margerine.  I am making them again for Valentines Day.  Hope you love them as much as we do!

Although I am a confirmed chocoholic I decided to make these without chocolate.  I also used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of using half margarine.  I found it too dry so I added 1/2 cup of boiling water to the dough and they came out great.  I was just in a peanut butter mood today and I'll definitely be making them again.  Thanks.

I too thought the 1 T of egg was strange. I had Egg Beaters on hand so used the 1 T, but when trying to add the chopped chocolate, it really wasn't coming together, so added a couple T's of milk.  Think it was suppose to say 1 egg. It said to use 1 heaping Tblspn of the "batter."  Well, I didn't use a measuring Tblspn, I used a table spoon and so I didn't get the 24 cookies it said you would get. A little crumbly, but delicious.

My friends and family LOVE these cookies. As most cooks do, I experimented with the recipe because chopping the chocolate was messey & time consuming for me. If you like moist and chewey cookies here is a simple alteration. Instead of chopping the chocolate squares, I melt them in the microwave with the peanut butter and light margarine (stick butter). Then I add 1 whole egg (when I printed this recipe last year it said 1 egg, not 1 tablespoon of egg) and vanilla. After adding & mixing in the dry ingredients, the mixture cools down & will be like the batter of old fashioned "No Bake Chocolate Oatmeal Cookies", but without the sugar & less fat. I wear latex cooking gloves & mold little balls to drop on the cookie sheet. While baking they spread out into perfectly shaped cookies. I only bake on 350 for 8-10mins. As an added bonus, I have also taken the 2 chocolate squares left over, and melted slowly on low heat in a pot & drizzled on top of the cookies. Chocolate will harden once the cookies cool. Hope you enjoy as much as we do!

These cookies were very yummy. However they were very crumbly cookies. So if you like chewy these are not for you.

I saw this exact recipe(except that whole tbsp of egg thing, which I agree with scotbo is definitely weird and unnecessary), using real sugar, on another website, so I thought I would try this one as I try to reduce sugar in my baking whenever possible.  Boy am I glad I did, as my friends and coworkers loved them! My only regret is that reviewers on the other website seemed to think the cookies were too "peanut-buttery" using the recommended amount, so I reduced the PB in my cookies to be safe.  They would have been SO MUCH BETTER if I had used the amount called for in the recipe (and maybe even a bit more).  Great cookies!!!

I'm diabetic,so concerned about the sugar thing-These came out perfect. Used an egg in place of the tablespoon of egg, as I wasn't sure what that meant-seemed kind of weird.
