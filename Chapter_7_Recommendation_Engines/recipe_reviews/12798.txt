The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent.  The second time, however, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD making the following changes:  Instead of broiling, melt the butter in a saucepan over med/high heat.  Add the remaining ingredients (except the lemon) and sautee the scallops for approx two minutes on each side.  Pour the scallops and the sauce over pilafed rice, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top, and garnish with a little parsley and a tiny bit of paprika for color.  My fiance says this is the best seafood recipe I have ever made!

I have made this recipe over a dozen times.  It's the best.  One suggestion, mix the liquid ingredients all together and then brush on scallops.  Then sprinkle with crushed black pepper and parmesan.  It's great for a weekend meal as well as for company.  thank you to the original subscriber!

Absolutely excellent!   Only limited by the quality of scallops used.  We used cheap-o Sam's frozen scallops because that is what we had on hand..similar to another reviewer, and they still turned out good. (I halved the garlic salt and added garlic powder as another reviewer recommended).  My husband often eats scallops when we eat out, and can vouch for the great taste of this unassuming recipe.  I rate it 5 for ease and he rates it 5 for taste.  A winner!

Absolutely terrific recipe! The only change I made was that I heated the butter and added some smashed garlic (like a cream consistency) to the warm butter and then brushed the mixture over the scallops. It was just amazing and my boyfriend and I are going to make and eat them this way again tonight. Thanks very much!

This is absolutely delicious! It is a classic recipe that is simple to make. I will definitely be making it again. I did deviate from the recipe a bit as I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops (this requires tripling the butter and lemon, and broiling for about 10 mins). I also took the suggestion of brushing on the mixture before pouring it into the dish, and I sprinkled some chili powder on top before broiling. I was going for paprika, but the chili actually gave it some added spice, which turned out very well!

The only changes I made to the recipe was using Old Bay for the garlic salt & sprinkling just a bit more lemon juice on top before serving them. Very good & very easy...I actually think this rated higher than a four but not quite a five. I wasn't in the mood for pasta so I served these w/ a steamed artichoke (also dipped in the butter), lemon pepper zuchinni & sauteed mushrooms w/ white wine. Pinot Grigio went really well this meal.

These were just okay.  Sprinkle a little parsley and paprika over them.  Use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as the salt will draw moisture out of the scallops.  Would be better using sea scallops.

For us, 1 tablespoon of garlic salt made the dish too salty. Tried it again and slightly warmed a minced clove of garlic (or more, depending on how many scallops) to the butter before sprinkling the top of the scallops with it. Topped it with the lemon juice and it was 100% better. This is also great sauteed with the above ingredients. I've also sauteed the scallops in just butter and lemon, adding white wine close to the end of cooking time. Yum!!

These scallops are excellent! Also very quick and easy. I go a little lighter on the garlic salt and add a tiny bit of parmesan cheese on top... helps them brown. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an easy recipe to put together and to cook, and it really complemented the flavor of the scallops.  I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops.  The only difference I found was that mine didn't cook in the 6-8 minute range (it was closer to 10-12 minutes).  My husband and I both loved this recipe, but we had to bribe the kids (ages 6 and 4) to eat them (and they are usually not picky eaters).  Will definitely keep this one even though the kids may not approve!

Fish and other seafood is generally best mildly seasoned  with a little salt, lemon and butter.  This recipe for scallops is perfect. Understated and complementary seasoning, excellent recipe directions and perfect cooking method. Submitter has this nailed - they were perfect.  I used dry pack scallops and was lucky to get some that had been flown in the same day I cooked them.  It made a remarkable difference – they were deliciously mild, sweet, and very obviously fresh as can be.  Served them over “Potluck Rice Pilaf,” recipe also from this site.

“Dry packed” or "day boat" vs “wet” scallops really allow this recipe to shine.  Managed to get my hands on the dry packed and so looked forward to trying this recipe.  The seasonings were light enough they didn't overpower the delicate flavor of the seafood and allowed the natural sweetness of the scallop to come through.  For those of you who might not know:  Wet scallops (usually found in the grocery store) are commonly treated with Phosphates which is a preservative.  When scallops are soaked in phosphates, they absorb water making them weigh more and thereby costing you more.  The absorbed water evaporates during cooking and shrinks your scallops leaving them smaller, dry, and causes their normally sweet flavor to all but disappear plus the added water does not let scallops brown properly. It is easy to discern treated scallops as they will appear snow-white in color.  Dry scallops are wild and natural.  They are not treated with any chemicals and are harvested directly from the ocean, shucked on deck, and frozen on the boat to capture their quality.  Dry scallops caramelize naturally during cooking to a golden brown color and generally have a natural vanilla color.  Served with a simple saffron-scented risotto studded with peas for a 5 star meal.

Great recipe.  The Husband loved it - but then I am the Husband.  First time I made it I thought it was a bit salty, so the second time I cut the garlic salt in half and added 1/2 T garlic powder.  Significant improvement in my mind.  Also served over spinach wilted in garlic and olive oil.

Using dry pack scallops makes all the difference in the world in terms of the end result. Still, while this requires minimal clean-up,this method of preparation is a distant second from pan searing them for that desirable golden "crust."

Excellent recipe with a few modifications.  I used 1/2 TB garlic powder (NOT garlic salt).  You can use fresh garlic too.  I also added 1TB of vermouth.  I think adding wine to scallops makes it so much better when cooking, so use what you have on hand.  Also sprinkled fresh pepper on top, with a thin layer of parm cheese.  Broil about 6-7 minutes near heat and be careful to not overcook scallops.  If you are cooking past 10 minutes, you are overcooking.  Scallops should be opaque in middle (medium rare).  Serve over couscous and drizzle extra butter sauce.  Yummy.

This was great and easy, although I did modify it. I placed scallops in broiler pan with olive oil and drizzled with lemon juice.  I had large scallops so I had to broil them on high for about 10-12 minutes. I drizzled minced garlic sauteed in small amount of olive oil and bacon drippings over the top of each scallop when they came out of the oven.  They were great! Served with mashed cauliflower and asparagus. Seemed like a very gourmet meal.

This recipe is delicious and simple. You can adjust the garlic/salt/lemon ratio to suit your taste, and the end result was even better than I expected! Served with herbed butter noodles on the side & asparagus vinaigrette...my husband had 3 servings of everything!

I have never broiled anything n my life, so I thought I would try it along with it was my first time cooking scallops. I recommend adding a lot more seasonings to the scallops because they are pretty bland with just the lemon and salt and butter.  And they weren't cooking very nicely in the broiler, so I moved them to a saute pan for a few minutes.  They were pretty good.

This recipe was "melt in your mouth good"!  I used fresh sea scallops straight from the wharf in Cape May.  Because they are bigger than bay scallops, they took a little longer to broil.  I used garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  I only used half the amount as I didn't want to mask the flavor.  The scallops were so tender, dipped in butter, they just melted in your mouth.  Thank you Gail New for sharing your recipe.

My favorite kind of recipe:  relatively few ingredients, easy and tasty!  Goes very well as a topping for the "Sicilian Spaghetti" recipe on this site.  You can't go wrong with butter and garlic!

Thanks for the recipe.  My changes:  I used sea scallops, fresh garlic and marinated the scallops in the garlic, butter and lemon juice, before broiling.  The salt wasn't missed.

This turned out pretty good.  I changed the recipe by using sea scallops cut in 1/2 (because that is all I had) and reduced fat butter.  I tossed the cooked scallops in angel hair pasta with a little extra butter, parsley and parmesan cheese.  I will make this again.

Perfection in a pan. Very easy to make too.  The only thing I did differently was use bay scallops.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I was not sure that so few ingredients would work, but they do. This is so quick and easy.  I have tried this recipe many times.  It's the best scallop recipe I have found.

I can't believe this recipe!  Wonderful and super easy!!  

I used sea scallops which seemed to fit the cooking time better.  But keep an eye on them since they cook quickly.  I shared this recipe at work and other people have tried it and raved about it too.  This is so simple yet delicious.  

I just went out to buy more scallops so I can make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, this is a definite keeper!

I really liked this recipe because I was making scallops for a dinner party of 7 and I just don't have the commercial capacity to have all of them seared perfectly at the same time.  So, this will be my go to recipe for when I'm cooking for more than just my husband and myself.  I did use fresh garlic- of course- and the large sea scallops, so left them under broiler for 11 min total - and that's about it.  The quality of the scallops will make a huge difference, but this is a great recipe for a larger batch.  Really lets the scallop show through.

I made as one other reviewer suggested - seared in the butter/garlic sauce (my oven was in use for another dish, so I could not broil). Delish! Served over the asparagus risotto recipe, also on this site.

i have made this recipe a number of times and it comes out amazing everytime. it should be noted to use unsalted butter or if all you have is salted to cut the garlic salt in half and replace with garlic powder. Gail's husband is right though, these are considered the best scallops ever in my household as well, and we have a self proclaimed scallop aficionado. even the kids, 6 & 7, love these scallops. simply amazing and worth all 5 stars if you ask us.

Absolutely delicious!  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also melted my butter and then added the lemon juice and garlic powder to it and adjusted the amounts to suit my taste.  Then I dipped the scallops in the melted butter before putting them under the broiler, and i turned them over about halfway through.  The butter mixture that was around them on the pan got nice and brown and was delicious poured over the finished scallops.  Yummy--definitely as good as any restaurant!

Made these last night and they were a hit! Even the kids home from college loved them. 
The only things I changed was to use garlic powder instead of salt (on low sodium diet) and added black and red pepper. I also topped with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

So easy!  I impulse bought 1/3 lb. of scallops and wanted something easy and fresh -- set them in a ceramic pie pan, sprinkled a little garlic powder (lost the garlic salt!) + a little salt + fresh cracked pepper, squeezed half a lemon over everything (and the excess in the bottom of the pan), and sprayed a good amount of butter over everything (I was out of butter! except for the spray kind my hubby loves).  Broiled for 8.5 minutes -- tasty, delicate, perfection.

I've made these a few times following the recipe, but the last time I changed it a little. I melted the butter in a frying pan, added the garlic salt then put the scalops in. I cooked them for about 4 minutes on each side or until they turned brown. Then... I had some ritz crackers that kind of had went stale, and crushed those over the top and flipped them and more ritz then the lemon juice. I let them hang out in the pan to let the ritz soak up the sauce, for about a minute and they turned out AMAZING!!!!!!

Very good, yet mild. If you have very fresh, wonderful scallops and you want their mild taste to shine through, this is the dish for you.

I used a tablespoon of minced garlic and little more butter. I also used the sea scallops instead of bay scallops. It was still delicious and oh so easy.

Absolutely fabulous recipe. I would not hestitate to make it again ... or even to try it with shrimp. The only tiny complaint I have ... I cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon (as opposed to 1 tablespoon), and it was STILL too salty (and keep in mind, this is coming from a salt ADDICT). Before sticking under the broiler, I also sprinkled the seafood lightly with dried parsley and sweet Hungarian paprika. Fab-u-lous.

I have to say I was skeptical, as I've tried so many ways of sauteing or baking scallops with little success.  So here it is scallop season in Maine, with the most divine daily catch every day, and I came across this recipe.  It is Fantastic, Perfect! The only two refinements that I made were to combine the Garlic Salt and Butter before melting; and I also sprinkled a Tablespoon of Panko (Kikkoman) Japanese Style Breadcrumbs over the top before broiling.

Lacked flavor.  I don't tend to over-season seafood because I want to taste the seafood... but following this recipe as written results in a bland, boring dish.  Easy and simple for a dinner for my husband and myself, but I would not serve this to guests.

These scallops are awesome. I have made them about 4 times now. The recipe is excelent as is. I would not change a thing. I made these last night for dinner and served them along with marinated salmon, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, steamed carrots and garlic cheddar biscuits. My husband said it was a restaurant quality meal. We all enjoyed it.

FABULOUS!  Not only is this really good-my husband LOVED them, this is so easy that you can wow anybody with very little effort.  I added parmesean cheese on top and cracked pepper.  Could  have done without the cracked pepper and just used regular b/c cracked is pretty strong.  Scallops have such a mild flavor, and I think the less you add to them the better and that is why this recipe is so good b/c there is not 500 ingredients.

Great recipe! I followed other reviews and mixed the butter and garlic together first and mixed in the scallops. I put them on a baking pan, sprinkled parmesan cheese & pepper and baked for about 10 mins. I used sea scallops because it is what I happened to grab at the store.

I thought this really needed more flavor. It was much too blah. Not tough at all and to the person that wrote that baking toughens scallops, it doesn't. Overcooking, no matter how you cook them, toughens scallops.

Scallops were great. I sauteed them using 1/2 TBLS garlic salt and 1/2 TBLS of garlic powder. After putting them on the plate I squeezed the lemon over them. I really enjoyed them. I will broil them next time to see which way is better.

These were very good.  I used fresh (and by fresh, I mean came off a boat that morning ;)) sea scallops.  I used minced garlic rather than garlic salt...I always make that substitution because I do not care for the taste of salt overwhelming good ingredients.   Nice, simple recipe that let the taste of the scallops shine through.

Hmm. Not a big fan. I think they'd be better seared. It wasn't anything special... I did use garlic powder instead of salt, as it would've been WAY overpowering (salty). Won't make again.

I made these last night, and was a little disappointed. They tasted OK, just not outstanding. Next time, I'll try sauteing instead of broiling, and use some Old Bay instead of Garlic salt.

Trying to stick with my New Years resolution, we tried this recipe. After reading the many reviews, I used fresh minced garlic and garlic powder. I added a dash of paprika. They came out very tender and light. Left us full but not weighed down. Served on a bed on rice pilaf with steamed broccoli.

These were really quite good, I'd rate them a 4.5.  I'd cut the garlic salt to 2 1/4 teaspoons instead of 1 tablespoon as they were a tad salty.  After tossing the scallops in the butter/lemon juice mixture, I sprinkled some black pepper and paprika before putting under the broiler.  The paprika makes the finished presentation more attractive.

Easy, simple, and most definitely delicious. We add more lemon juice and cut the butter back a little, otherwise following the recipe to a 'T', and it has turned out delicious each time. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipie was very good, but my boyfriend loved it! I took someone else's suggestion on here & used old bay seasoning instead of the garlic salt. The only problem I had was that the entire apt. ended up smelling of "old bay" until the next morning. I'll definetly be making this again - but with the windows open :)

I, too, tried this recipe as well as the pan-seared variation written by another reviwer. I found that the timing provided wasn't enough for a "seared" or even slightly brown texture. And, the garlic salt was too much salt for the only spice. I'm still searching for a great scallop recipe. Sorry.

Excellent recipe and so simple to make too! I used Old Bay seasoning instead of the garlic salt though. What makes this dish is just the ratio of butter to lemon juice. There's just a hint of lemon to the sweet scallops. Dipped in butter, it's heavenly.

Made this for dinner last night.  I thought they were great after I modified the recipe just a bit by melting  1/2 stick of extra butter in a small saucepan and then mixing in about 1/2 cup of italian breadcrumbs.  I took the scallops out of the oven with about 3 minutes left and topped with the breadcrumb/butter mix. Then I let them finish broiling.  Served with brocolli and rice pilaf.  Yum. My house smelled like Cape Cod! Next time I also think I'll cut back on the lemon juice a bit.  Thanks.

These are wonderful, and so easy to make. I would suggest that no one make my error by trying to distribute melted butter onto refrigerator-cold scallops, though. Let them sit out for at least a few minutes, or the butter won't stay melted long.

These were wonderful.  I used sea scallops and a dab of chopped garlic that you can buy in a jar.  Also added a little salt and pepper and they were incredible.  The best part is that you don't have to wait long for a super meal because their done in a flash.

This is a solid, easy recipe for scallops.  As someone else mentioned, it's pretty standard fare, but it really does taste wonderful.  I used sea scallops, and their full flavor holds its own- you don't need a lot of fancy ingredients to prepare them well.

Excellent, I agree with her husband.  Used  crushed garlic and sprinkled some kosher salt.  Used frozen scallops thawed overnight in the fridge.
It took about 9 minutes on the 2nd rack under the broiler.
Thanks for a new favorite!

This is not my prefered way to cook scallops.  I found the scallp[s were very dry and we were not able to eat them like this. Too dry and too chewy.  After I removed them from the oven, I ended up putting them in a pan with extra butter to saute.  I won't use this method again.  That made them edible but not wonderful.

Best scallop recipe I've found yet.  I took the suggestions of others and mixed the ingredients first then poured them over the scallops.  I topped it with a little parmesan and black pepper.  AMAZING!  I made a simple rice pilaf and poured the sauce from the scallops over the rice and put the scallops on it.  I highly reccomend!!

As written, they really didn't brown. Once I took these out of the broiler, I seared them in a pan to brown the tops and bottoms. The flavor was very simple and perfect for scallops.

I should have read through all the comments before making these...  I also found them to be a bit bland and kind of soupy.  I did make one change, I used garlic powder and regular salt instead of garlic salt, which I don't keep in the pantry.  I think these scallops need the boost from the salty garlic salt, otherwise they are just kind of bland.  I used a good amount of garlic powder, salt, and pepper, but it just didn't wow me at all.  Mine didn't really brown, though I left them under the broiler for several extra minutes.

Pretty good, except the garlic salt made it too salty for me. Next time I think I'll use garlic powder instead.

These were so delicious as the recipe is and simple to make ...I added a little bit of Cajun seasoning as other reviewers suggested.  As a few other readers commented, my scallops did not get golden brown even though they were cooked all the way...They were so yummy though we didn't even notice the lack of browning. My husband gobbled them up and commented that he would like to have them again soon.

Delicious! Took another member's tip and sauteed on the stove instead for about 7 minutes with some stirring. Turned out with extra liquid, would have been great served on plain rice. Even my three year old loved it!

Delicious!  I have made this numerous times and each time it is wonderful. Tonight I made with lemon, butter and a spice mix (salt, pepper, garlic and paprika). Using large scallops, I broiled for 7 minutes then sprinkled with shaved Parmesan cheese, broiled 2 additional minutes.  Lovely.

These are simply fantastic. I used Sea Scallops since thats what I had on hand so I went ahead and tripled the butter mix, totally not necessary.  Next time I would only double it. I served the butter mix from the pan for dipping and it was soo soo good. Simple, quick, and fantastic!!!

I sauteed fresh garlic and shallots in the butter, then seared the scallops instead of broiling them. Turned out great! 

Just a quick tip for those complaining of sandy scallops, soak them in milk between 30 minutes and overnight. It will help get out any sand left in.

GREAT!  I followed a few of the suggestions- used sea scallops, melted butter, 1/2 of the garlic salt recommended, added tsp minced garlic & 1/2 tsp. garlic powder & then the lemon juice and brushed it on top, then added the rest to the dish.  sprinkled tops with pepper and little parm ch.  broiled for 10-12 min.  added a dash of paprika and parsley at the end.  served with roasted brussel sprouts and rice pilaf.  AMAZING.  best scallop recipe I've had.  Usually my home cooked versions don't turn out so well, but I order them all the time out to eat.  I will be making this again and again.  Even my 4 year old loved it and was dissapointed when all the "gallups" were gone. Thanks for sharing this!

These were fabulous!!  So easy, too.  I followed others' advice and put them in a skillet on the stove, sauteeing for 2 minutes on each side.  Would do that again!  I bought only 1 lb. of scallops, so I used fewer ingredients:  1 Tbl. butter and 1 tsp. garlic salt, but did use the full 2 Tbl. lemon juice.  Perfect!  I serve with a rice pilaf with carrots and peas, and wilted Swiss chard.  Colorful meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really lovely recipe.  I mix the garlic salt, lemon juice and melted butter together, then toss the scallops in it before broiling. A light dusting of paprika or cayenne just before broiling is also nice, both in taste and presentation. Rather than serving with additional butter, I prefer an extra squeeze of fresh lemon just before serving.

I tried it tonight I split the garlic recommendation 1/2 garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder.  My husband LOVED this and actually ate the rest of dinner too!  I served it over a bed of rice for something different. Thanks for the recipe.

Made with sea scallops and used 1 tbs. Old Bay seasoning instead of garlic salt.  Ended up cooking just a little longer.  Yummy

Made these tonite, and husband liked, said he would eat again.  I'm not a big scallop fan but they were pretty good and sooo easy to make.  Next time I will try with sea scallops, which I generally prefer to bay.  I did replace the garlic salt with powder and was happy with the result.  I think that the garlic salt would have made them too salty.

We made this dish using sea scallops and garlic powder instead of the salt. This was part of our "seafood festival" dinner celebrating hubby's birthday while we were on vacation. They came out so sweet and so delicious. Thanks Gail!

Very quick, very good.  My changes:

Cut Sea Scallops into halves, use lots of butter, lemon, and fresh garlic and a little freshly ground salt. 

Broil; check after 10 mins and then again every 5. 

While we ate the scallops a la carte, they would be AWESOME as a topper to fresh-pasta primavera for Carbies.

Broling must be the best method to cook scallops! I used chopped fresh garlic and parsely, and substituted bay scallops with jumbo sea scallops. Light and very flavorful dish! Keep an eye on the scallops while broling; you don't want to overcook them.

The scallops were very good, probably not the best I have had and I am not sure what I would do to change them.  I used sea scallops and they melted in your mouth. I sprinkled them with Johnny's seafood seasoning and not quite as much garlic.  I have already bought more to make this again.

This recipe was fabulous!  I never cook scallops or seafood for that matter, this was really easy and tasted unreal.  I used the huge sea scallops and had great success.  I would have loved to know how to thicken the butter/garlic/lemon juices after the cooking for a sauce, if anyone has any suggestions post them!

I have made this recipe a number of times and love it each time!  As with other reviewers I have made some modifications.  I use bay scallops and double the butter but do not change the amount of lemon juice.  I put crushed garlic cloves in the butter while melting and remove them.  Once the lemon juice is added, I brush the butter mixture on the scallops and then pour the remainder in the pan. Broil for only 6 to 7 minutes since we don't like over cooked scallops.  Served on wilted spinach with mushroonm risotto and a salad this has become our staple dinner for Christmas and New Year's Eve.  Great company dinner as well.

Fantastic!! I used 6 large sea scallops between a friend and I and they were cooked so perfectly we were both left wanting more, especially with the leftovers, but I went along with another rating and pan seared them in butter instead, 2 minutes on each side and then sprinkled butter on top of them after I placed them on the rice pilaf!! Simply divine!

Easy and delicious!! I have to watch my sodium intake so I chopped a clove of garlic and put it into a pan with the butter on low heat. While it was melting, it infused the butter with the garlic. I added a pinch of sea salt at the end. I served it over fresh spinach and the sauce created by the butter, garlic, lemon and scallops, I poured over the spinach so it wilted just a bit. AMAZING!!

These scallops cooked beautifully. However, I thought the taste was slightly bland. I would follow other reviewers suggestions of adding a bit of fresh parsley, or fresh garlic.

Absolutely the best!! Just like you would get at a restaurant. I also used a little Parmesan cheese right at the end. As someone else said you are only limited by the quality of scallops you use. This is a keeper!! Thank you for posting it!

I halved the garlic salt and this recipe was still too salty. Next time I'd use regular garlic powder. I also doubled the whole recipe because I was making sea scallops but found I had too much sauce.

I made the recipe with no modifications. It was very quick and easy and my husband loved it!  For me though, it was just a little too salty. Next time I will either reduce the garlic salt by a teaspoon or use unsalted butter.

We really liked this dish.  I followed someone's suggestion to saute the scallops in butter and fresh garlic (rather than garlic salt) instead of broiling them, and then I served them over a homemade rice pilaf.  I then put some fresh squeezed lemon over the top. It was yummy!  I do think I will try broiling the scallops next time just to try it!

They were good--surprisingly so.  I was skeptical since I started with little frozen "bay scallops".  I used some Old Bay with the butter and lemon juice and just broiled for about 8 minutes.  will make a gain

I made this exactly as it described it to be made in the recipe, but instead of in the broiler, I pan seared them...  They were to die for!!  Thanks for sharing!! :-)

I never cooked scallops before but my Dad loves them and I wanted to surprise him with a seafood dinner he would enjoy.  I used sea scallops and then followed the recipe.  It was so easy and a total success.  Thanks

I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops and they were delicious!! I put all the ingredients in a bowl and dipped the scallops in the mixture, put on a baking pan and baked in the oven for nine minutes... Sea scallops are larger and take a little more time to bake than the bay scallops.  Either way, this is a great way to prepare delicious scallops!

5 stars for ease 4 stars for taste I used sea scallops and tossed them in the buter/garlic/lemon before broiling. A lot of water came out of the scalllops - I need to adjust the heat? So simple and I love that the taste of the scallops comes out and is accented.

Good. I did use garlic powder rather than salt, otherwise followed recipe to the T. I love scallops so I feel they can never be bad but I would have liked more flavor. Mine did take a bit longer to broil as well.

This was my first time on this website and my FIRST meal EVER cooking for my new husband! Used the large scallops from costco and was afraid they'd be over cooked but not only were they tender, they tasted amazing and looked beautiful. He was so impressed and so was i! Thanks for this website!!

This is such a simple way to make scallops but is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I do differently is to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  This is the only way i make scallops now.

I loved the concept of the recipe because I wanted to try bay scallops under the broiler rather than using my usual Ina Garten recipe for sauteed scallops provencal.  (Which is delicious, by the way.)  IMHO, as written, there was way too much garlic salt and lemon juice.  Why disguise the beautiful flavor of delciously sweet, fresh bay scallops with so much of those two ingredients?  After adjusting for that the second time I made this, the results were great.

First off after you rinse the scallops you should dry them off, if you don't all the water leaks out of them & will burn your pan under the broiler. That's what happened to me. The scallops took forever to cook, I had to leave them in much longer than the time stated. The overall taste was very mediocre. I suggest sauteeing scallops. Sorry, to be so harsh but I wish I never tried this recipe.

Both my husband and I thought these were great.  I liked the fact that it was quick and simple and I had all the ingredients on hand.

Yummo!  These are out of this world.  The only adjustment I made to this was that I added three diced cloves of garlic to the mixture.  We are big garlic lovers in this house.  Tasted just like Red Lobster.

I only had the giant Sea Scallops available.  After reading the reviews, I opted to saute mine.  They were wonderful!  Fast, simple, and wonderful.  My picky 4 year old even ate them.  I did add a little bit of Old Bay seasoning before cooking.

Love scallops.....did not care for this recipe! It was very salty, and the combination of the few ingredients didn't work for me.

I don't use/eat much salt. This recipe was so salty I couldn't eat it. Maybe with half that much salt it would be better?

Simple enough...Instead of Broiling I put them out on the grill on a piece of foil...after they were done I let them set in the remaining butter mixture until served..they were a hit..

This was okay - the seafood guy at Harry's Farmers Market recommended that I use sea scallops instead, stating that bay scallops are generally used in soups, etc. - not as the maid item.  I used the bay scallops, according the the recipe, and wished I hadn't.  They shrank considerably and were somewhat tough.  I gave my portion to my husband, who LOVES scallops, and he wasn't thrilled with them either.  Not bad, but I won't make it again.

Instead of garlic salt, used fresh minced garlic, a tad of salt and some fresh cracked black pepper. Served with a parmesan risotto.

These are great, and easy to prepare. My husband told me that they were a keeper and to next time double the recipe. I couldn't get a hold of any bay scallops so I bought the Sea scallops and cut them in half. I also, not that it needed it for flavor, sprinkled them with bread crumbs. This is definitely a keeper.

used sea scallops.  served over a bed of the garlic and cheese albino pasta (see recipe on this site).  Garnished with fresh parsley and ground pepper.  Used all-garlic powder.  Next time will decrease the amount of lemon juice (too tangy) and possibly pan-fry instead of broiling.

This recipe at first seemed too simple. However, I was mistaken. The flavor is robust and rich and the scallops did not dehydrate and firm up. They were extremely tender and moist. Excellent dish.

These were wonderful and tasty. I chose to pan cook them, since it is faster and I was using the oven for something else. 
A key is to make sure the scallops are dried off with a paper towel, as others have noted. Since I didn't have fresh garlic I used powdered, and they were still delicious. If I use the powder again, I will put it on the scallops first instead of in the pan, however. Near the end I added a little sea salt after adding the lemon. I will be making this again and  again!

Very, very good! Melted butter in a sauce pan and added the garlic.  Tossed scallops in it and then added them to all the dry ingredients which were in a large baggie.  Tossed them until coated and placed in baking pan.  Drizzled remaining butter over the top with a little lemon juice.  Served over Pasta Roni garlic and butter noodles.  Cooked at 400 for 20 minutes.  Perfectly done.  Would make again.  Hubby really enjoyed.

Wow, what an easy way to fix scallops! This recipe was delicious. To get the crispy, broiled look in the picture I turned the pan after 4 minutes under the broiler, again at 7 minutes and broiled for a total of 9 minutes. They were tender and so full of flavor!

I followed the recipe except that I used 1/2 Tbsp garlic salt and 1/2 Tbsp garlic powder as others suggested. I also added a little ground black pepper and parmesean cheese to the top. This came out delicious. My 11 y/o daughter even liked it. This is a quick and easy recipe that tastes great.

It was Great! I changed it just a bit; I melted the butter in a pot with smashed fresh garlic with lemon zest, and then poured it over the scallops right before I placed them under the broiler. Fantastic!

Hmm mm girlfriend!!! I know I told ya bout these tiny little balls of fish are F-E-R-G-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! I packed in six...and my girl ate them up like it was nobody's business.  Recommend serving with fried okra and if you're feeling fancy throw in a few collard greens.

wow!  I didn't know such a simple recipe could be SO good!  I used bay scallops and took the advice of another reviewer so I wouldn't have to use the broiler.  I melted butter and garlic salt in a pan and sauteed the scallops (added a little old bay too) and then squeezed on some lemon at the end of cooking.  YUM!  I served these over a bed of steamed green beans.  Thanks!!

Very good recipe, but I like more bold flavors, so I added sweet paprika and a little bit of chipotle chili powder to liven things up a bit and it was awesome!

I followed the recipe as is and these were mediocre.  We ate them, but weren't too enthusiastic.  I think it would be better with the larger sea scallops and you might want to add a little more seasoning...

Excellent!  I did mix the butter, garlic salt and lemon juice all together before pouring over the scallops.  Kept the measurements on those the same, however, next time I may double or triple them to make a sauce to pour it all over some pasta.  Thanks!

I've been making scallops for a while now, but I've always sauteed them. Broiling them instead makes a HUGE difference, in my opinion. They were so much more tender! This was delicious!

Delicious.  I used large sea scallops, and added a sprinkle of Old Bay.  Broiled for 4 minutes, turned, and cooked for an additional 3 minutes. I also broiled 26-30 count shrimp on the same sheet, and they tasted great too.

This was fairly disappointing, since I love scallops and had high hopes for this recipe. I made this twice, using frozen scallops that were thawed in the fridge. I'm not very experienced with broiling, and the first time I had the dish too far from the broiling flame. Even at 11 minutes, the scallops were only a tiny bit "golden". Plus, I guess I hadn't thawed/rinsed the scallops well enough, as the remaining ice crystals added quite a bit of "juice" to the dish, making it a little messy. So the second time, I broiled for 10 minutes, closer to the flame (per my oven's manual), and the scallops came out a lot more golden, even slightly browned. And there was a lot less "juice" this time, since the scallops were thawed longer and rinsed better. My main problem with this dish was that it was quite salty, and the salt overwhelmed the lemon and butter flavors. Both times, I served this on a bed of cooked white rice; the first time, I also used 1 T. melted butter on the side, as suggested. I'll keep looking for an awesome scallop recipe, sorry. (I usually read all prior reviews after writing, but before posting my own, but I'm going to skip the 234 previous reviews this time.)

Made this last night and changed a few things, but kept the spirit of the recipe the same. I had sea scallops on hand so I used those, and tossed the ingredients all together before putting it all under the broiler. I did add a sprinkling of paprika and grated Parmesan on top to help the appearance, and it needed to cook more like 10 minutes because we used the bigger scallops. Good taste, and very simple to prepare. I served with whole wheat couscous and a green salad, and the whole dinner came together in 15 minutes, so that was really nice. 4 stars instead of 5 because it was a good simple dish, but there was nothing really "WOW!" about it. I'll definitely make this again.

Worked out perfectly.  I had salted butter so I added a little ground garlic sea salt, lemon pepper and garlic powder when making the sauce.  This base sauce is also good with a little fresh basil

These are great! Instead of sprinkling the garlic (I don't use garlic salt, just powder) and butter, etc. on them... I mix it all in a bowl, throw my scallops in and then just pour the bowl into a baking pan.

Really easy, fast and delicious! Served over plain large pearl couscous, husband wouldn't shut up about how good it was! Textures went great with the large pearls. I did make it stove top, adding the lemon last, and cut the garlic salt a little (not a big salt person).  Added paprika for color.  Will make again anytime scallops are on sale!  Better then restaurant, and cost me only 6 dollars total for the scallops, everything else was in my pantry.

THIS WAS A DELICIOUS AND EASY MEAL. I SUBSTITUTED THE GARLIC SALT FOR MINCED GARLIC. I ALSO ADDED A TEASPOON OF OLD BAY. I SERVED IT OVER RICE W/ A TOSSED SALAD ON THE SIDE. NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO DOUBLE IN THE SAUCE AND SERVE IT OVER PASTA. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE...IT'S A KEEPER!

I liked how quickly scallops cook up and this recipe seemed very basic as it was my first time.  I followed the suggestions for sauteing in a skillet and served it over WW pasta with some italian dressing on the noodles.  My husband really liked them as well.  Will use again, but only as a treat, as scallops were a bit pricey...  :)  thanks!

I thought these were great!  I followed some others' suggestions and added old bay seasoning - but kept everything else as is.  This is an easy, quick and healthy recipe - I'll definitely make again :-)

This was great. I didn't have garlic salt so I just salted the scallops (by eye) and added granulated garlic.  Be careful not to overcook the scallops in the broiler, they'll become tough.

I love it! I have a 2 month old, so I don't really get that much time to prepare meals. But this was so quick and easy, and best of all it tastes great! I serve it with white rice and a few breaded shrimp.

I didn't change anything from the original recipe, but I think the next time I prepare it I will adapt the recipe according to the other suggestions. It is a very quick and easy supper. The scallops did not brown very much under the broiler, so don't use that as your guide for readiness!

I use 1 tbsp garlic salt, 1 tbsp garlic powder.  I let the broiler get up to full heat and I put the scallops about 2" from the elements....they cooked perfectly.  The did, however, taste artificial due to the garlic salt I believe.  Next time I'll use fresh garlic.  I added parmesan cheese and cracked pepper as recommeded...this salvaged the dish.  I would try this again with fresh garlic.

This was very good. I also used garlic powder instead of the salt. The garlic butter sauce I put over noodles and they were very flavorful. I really enjoyed the scallops, but my husband thought they were just okay. I would make this again...

These scallops were just ok.  I'm rating this recipe 3 stars based on the ease of preparation and not on flavor or taste because there was none.  I followed the advice of others and cut back the garlic salt and substituted garlic powder but the scallops didn't taste like anything.  I'll only be making this recipe 1 more time if I don't find a better recipe (have been looking for a low fat recipe) to use the rest of my uncooked scallops.

Works well with lime juice instead of lemon and I use 1/4 table spoon sea salt and 3/4 table spoon of crushed garlic. For a south of the border touch sprinkle a little chili.lime seasoning on the scallops after cooking

This was one of the many appetizers I fixed for a grilling party.  I've made them twice, once broiled, the second time grilled.  Try them on the grill, they came out just as tender and scullent!  My only recommendation is to use garlic powder instead of  garlic salt.

Good for a quick and simple recipe. I would think that this one would be better with sea scallops and that the little ones are best for tossing in a pasta - haven't tried it though. You also really don't need the extra butter to dip it in - there's plenty of butter already

This was very good.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I served it with couscous.  I also changed it per other suggestions by using 1/2 T of garlic salt and 1/2 T of garlic powder so it wouldn't be salty.  I will be making this again.  Thank you!

Very good and easy to make. For a low fat version, I substituted with butter spray. My husband didn't know the difference! I also added some pepper. It was so good that we didn't need any extra dipping sauce, but I served with some lemon wedges.

My husband loves scallops and he agrees that these are just as good if not better that any he has had at a resturant.  I didn't use as much garlic as called for--and my husband said it could have used more than I used.  I asked him to rate the recipe from one to five--he gave this recipe a six!!!

Delicious and so easy to make. Used sea scallops and 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Scallops must not be my family's thing.  I thought they were okay, my husband and almost 3 year old picked at theirs, but our 15 month old loved them.  I mixed all of the ingredients together and brushed on before broiling.  It was very fast and easy.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these scallops turned out intolerably salty.  It could have been that my scallops were fresh and retained a high salt (water) content.  I even tried cutting the garlic salt as per the reviews on this site.  I'd suggest garlic powder over garlic salt.

Wonderful!! I am now a scallop lover! I have tried to cook them several different ways - but none bring out such a rich flavor. I made them with "Absolutely the best shrimp scampi" from this site (also terrific) and served it over rice. My husband thinks I am now a gourmet chef!

I have tried at least a dozen scallop recipes in the last six months.  This is the best yet.  I BBQed & they were the star of my Good Friday dinner.

The scallops were really yummy and easy to make.  Took longer to broil than I expected...maybe because I kept checking them to be sure they didn't get too brown. Treated my son and husband to this on day after Christmas and they said 'Bravo' so looks like I'll make them again.

I have made this several times, it is always a hit, and definitely as good as restaurant scallops.  My kids are very picky when it comes to seafood, but I am sure any seafood-eating kids would love this.

Excellent--tasty, easy, fast.  Who could ask for more?  I was a little bit disappointed about how 1 1/2 pounds of scallops (about $10) shrunk, but the flavor was wonderful.

Simple, tasty. Others have said it but I'll concur - melt the butter, add lemon juice and brush over scallops first. Also prefer garlic powder to garlic salt. So easy and if you're scallops are fresh, even better - doesn't over power.

Tastey but I prefer Sea Scallops as they are much bigger. I also prefer the frying pan as under the broiler it seemed there was a lot of steam pouring out of the oven.

I can't have butter, so I changed it to a drop olive canola oil. I put it on top of fettuccine alfredo.  I don't usually like cooking, but this was so easy and really yummy!!!

Will definitely make again. I melted the butter in a small cast iron skillet, mixed in the other ingredients, spooned over the scallops and put the pan in he broiler while I cooked corn on the cob.

Delicious!  Living in Maryland, I took notice that another reviewer substituted Old Bay Seasoning for the Garlic Salt.  I microwaved 4T butter, 4 sliced garlic cloves and 1oz lime juice, then let it stand while I rinsed and patted dry 1.5lb of Sea Scallops.  I brushed a large fry pan and the scallops with the butter mixture, put the scallops in the pan and dusted them with Old Bay.  I saluted  them 4-5 minutes on a side at medium to medium-high until golden brown.  They were great!

I have made it many times and added different  seasonings.  It takes my oven longer to cook the scallops to perfection.  Everytime it came out absolutely delicious.

When paired with a vegetable, this is a quick easy meal, which is what  I am usually in the market for with my hectic schedule. I normally  steam asparagus or some other vegetable right in the store brought bag it came in, and plate it up with these broiled scallops. These have a subtle, yet "just enough" taste. Just watch your  broiler, as broilers tend to normally burn your  food if you don't pay close attention. Try it! It's EASY EASY EASY!

Made no changes very tasty, even though I would use Sea Scallops next time as I prefer them over the small Bay Scallops.  I will try again being careful of timing to not overcook.  Overall I would do again and will as my wife loved them and she prefers her seafood cooked a bit more.

Recipe is good, as written - but I would never use either powdered garlic or garlic salt!  The late James Beard  deplored them.   Rather than broiling - which can be unreliable, I sautéed  fresh minced garlic in my cast iron skillet - heated very hot! - using a combination of butter & olive oil.  Remove the garlic before it turns brown, then add the scallops.  Cook very quickly, remove to a serving dish, sprinkle with  salt, the lemon juice and the pan drippings.

Delicious! Be sure to buy dry scallops if you can. If your market only has scallops soaked in water, you can fix them by wrapping in a few layers of paper towels and gently squeezing the water out.  A hot broiler is a must and keep the scallops about 2 inches from the flames.  You should rotate the pan after a few minutes for even cooking.

They were ok but cooked before the surface was nicely browned. The recipe doesn't say how many inches from the broiling elements. At 500 degrees, my sea scallops we're done before the tops browned. I prefer pan searing the scallops.

Super easy, and you can play with different spices.
Broiled for 5 minutes, and the 2 pound tray was empty  in less than that.
We had 13 people over, and although 2 lbs looks like a lot at the store, it really wasn't enough after cooking them due to shrinkage.... Just something to think about as your planning.

I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers to saute' the scallops in a skillet over med-high heat. It was delicious and I will make it again. Next time I will try infusing the butter with whole garlic cloves and then smashing the clove once it is soft. I think I will like the more subtle flavor with the delicate flavor of scallops.

Phenomenal recipe! Made exactly as written and then made it again with a couple changes which were also incredible: I added a splash of white wine to the butter and pan-seared at the end for the last minute for a nice crust! So easy, and a classic go to for future seafood craving nights!

It was amazingly simple! All we had to do was get the scallops, and we had the rest at home.I recommend to save the extra sauce after the scallops have been broiled and serve it with rice on the side. It is also great with lion fish. These delectable scallops simply are better than any restaurant I've ever been to, and this is a MUST TRY AGAIN dish.

I followed the directions, no substitutions or changes to cooking method. Excellent. Husband likes bland food, however, seafood is the exception. The tastes were blended nicely and the scallops almost melt in your mouth.  If they aren't, it's you not the recipe.

I sprinkled a tablespoon of garlic salt over 1.5 pounds of sea scallops, and then drizzled melted butter and lemon juice over the salted scallops before broiling.  The end result was WAY too salty.  Next time, I will mix the garlic salt in with the butter and lemon juice.

Finally a scallop recipe we love. Short simple  and to the point. Great as is or topped with a light scampi or even hollandaise sauce. I use pretty much every recipe as a base and experiment until I make recipes my own!

My family loved this.  I made no changes to the ingredients.  However I did melt the butter with the seasonings and brush it on them before I broiled them.  Very good and VERY easy.

I followed some recommendations of others that had already made this dish by cutting the garlic salt and also using garlic powder along with black pepper. I used sea scallops, mixed the butter with the lemon juice, drizzled the scallops with the butter and lemon mixture and broiled 10 minutes. I rotated the pan about three times during the cooking process for even browning. After plating scallops, I drizzled them with melted butter. Absolutely delicious. This will be my go to scallop recipe because it is so simple and quick.

The first time I made this recipe I used scallops. It was the best scallop recipe. But the second time I made it,  I decided to use flounder. I used this same recipe on two flounder fillets and added a little more lemon juice to each and broiled them for 6 minutes. It was an amazing meal and definitely restaurant quality.

The only problem with this recipe is making enough! The bigger the scallops I find the better, I made it with real diced garlic rather then garlic salt....MMMMMM! I can't wait to make it again!

I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops. I also sauteed them rather than making them in the broiler. The recipe was delicious! My husband liked them as well :) Served it over rice pilaf and asparagus with lemon squeezed over it and a dash of parpika. Included a side of garlic bread and a salad. Yummy!

After reading all of the reviews, I used this receipe and tripled the butter and lemon juice amounts, as I  also used dry sea scallops. In stead of the garlic salt, I used 2 cloves of crushed garlic.  Also pan seared for 3 minutes +/-  per side until browned, instead of broiling.  Served with easy rice pilaf....probably one of the best new dishes I have made.  It is truly out of this world.  PS add the pan drippings to the rice pilaf. Amazing.  Thanks for posting.

As others recommended: 1/2 garlic powder and 1/2 garlic salt, sprinkled with paprika and a tiny bit of parmesan. I used sea scallops and cooked for 9 minutes.  My one recommendation- take off of the  baking sheet right away or they keep cooking!

The only changes I made were melted butter on top mixed with quite a bit of garlic salt w/parsley and a little lemon juice. I also used sea scallops instead of bay so had to cook a bit longer.

WAY too salty. I didn't even use the amount of garlic salt called for in the recipe. Good base recipe but in the future I will omit the garlic salt all together and use fresh garlic instead.

This was very good. Both kids and husband enjoyed it. I followed recipe...used the small scallops, whichever ones those are. The flavor was very light and didn't overpower the scallops themselves. I made the Sicilian Spaghetti recipe from the site that someone recommended (followed that recipe except for anchovies).  Nice flavors.  I can't say they were the best I've had, but they were really nice.

I thought this was "tasteless". With the cost of scallops these days, I was highly disappointed. I would have given it a 1 but we ate it due to the cost.

Loved the outcome! Used this recipe as a foundation for sea scallops and shrimp combo. I melted the butter in a skillet added dried minced garlic and simmered for one minute. Added sea scallops for 2 minutes before adding shrimp as these scallops were very large. Continued to cook for 4 more minutes. Won't be ordering seafood in a restaurant any more. Scrumptious.

These were "ok", but I won't be making this again. I prefer sautéed scallops with garlic and parsley but thought this might be a nice change. Followed the recipe exactly. Adjusted the broiling time to 5 minutes. They looked nice (see photo) texture was ok, but the taste was rather bland. I agree with a previous reviewer about garlic salt not being the best seasoning choice for scallops. Sticking to my sautéed scallops but thanks for the recipe. Might turn out better with larger scallops, fresh garlic and a sprinkle of Old Bay :)

Excellent!  I modified this recipe using Meyer Lemon infused olive oil, 2 tablespoons of butter and fresh minced garlic (no salt).  I added a small amount of fresh ground pepper at the end.  With olive oil, the scallops needed a couple of extra minutes in the broiler but wow!  Amazing!  The liquid/sauce created was better than any restaurant scallops.

Very tasty! I melted butter and chopped garlic in the microwave. Dunked scallops in it before broiling. Came out great!

Clearly something went wrong.  For me, this wasn't very good at all and I LOVE scallops.  I don't even have any tips on how to improve it.

I use garlic powder and a pinch of sea salt to control the sodium. I have served this over rice with and without vegatables and it works great. My husband loves this.

We used real garlic and served it with the quinoa with peas recipe.  It was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  In the summer, we grill them.

This was good. I think it would have been better with fresh not frozen scallops which is what I used, but I looked at the nutritional info after I made it.  If you follow the recipe it has 2232 mg of salt per serving.  That is 149% of my daily requirement.  Next time I make it I would use fresh garlic not garlic salt.

I made these for my husband.  I used fresh garlic rather than powder.  They didn't brown under the broiler like ixpected so I put them on the stove on high heat to brown them up quick.  He really enjoyed them.

The recipe was good, but I found the scallops to be too wet. Next time I will try brushing the butter mixture on, rather than drizzling it, as another reviewer suggested.

This recipe is amazingly easy and just as tasteful.  I used sea scallops instead of bay since they were on sale at my market.  I also substitued garlic powder for garlic salt and added a sea salt.  I sprinkled both over the scallops and then drizzled 1 tbsp of light butter over the top.  To finish I sprinkled black pepper and shredded parmesan cheese over the butter.  It was my first time cooking scallops and it turned out wonderfully.  I tossed them with a green salad and served with citrus balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

The flavor was okay, but the salt pulled all the moisture out of the scallopa and made a big puddle in the bottom of the dish.  They never really browned, but if I had left them in the oven any longer they would've been so rubbery they were inedible.  I'll loook for another scallops recipe next time I'm in the mood.

Very tasty!!!! I messed it up a bit because I let the scallops dry out and I didn't use garlic salt, I used garlic powder and salt separately which required me working to find a tasteful blend. Other than that its definitely a quick and tasty dish!!!! Sig other approved!!!!

First time I've ever made scallops in my life.  It was so easy- didn't take long.  My boyfriend loved them.  Said they were just right!

Like many others, I used crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, and used a little Soul Seasoning for the saltiness, because all I had was unsalted butter. The salt level was just perfect for my taste (I imagine 2T of garlic salt would be too much.) These were great (though not browned) with a lot of liquid, but the taste was fantastic and we sopped up the juices with fresh bread. Thanks for another great - and simple! - scallop recipe to add to the recipe box!

This was my first time making scallops at home, and they were okay but not nearly as good as the ones I've had at restaurants. The flavor was fine but I would have preferred a firmer, almost crispy texture all over the outside of the scallop. As is, only the top got firm/crispy and the bottom was soft and kind of mushy. I think searing would help the texture and I might try that next time instead. I picked this recipe for its simplicity and I was not disappointed with that aspect. This is an easy way to try scallops and then branch out depending on your tastes.

These were outstanding. Exactly what I was looking for when I made dinner for my husband and I last night. It was simple and delicious. I was worried about it being too simple, but they came out perfectly. The scallops were not overdone, the flavor was just right. The three other ingredients do not take away from the natural flavor of the scallops at all. The only change I had to make was with the garlic salt. I did not have any, so I substituted with onion salt and it turned out to be delicious. This is one of my all time favorites and I hope to make it for family/friends next time.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought these were good, very simple, but I like a more robust, flavorful sauce. Seemed too plain for me.

I made this and the only thing I changed was adding parmesan cheese to the top so it would make a crispy crust on the scallop while broiling. I served it to my boyfriend who now requests it almost every time I ask him what he wants me to make. It's so quick and easy to make on a busy night but still absolutely delicious!

Just made it!  Slight variation...I sauteed 2 tbsp of i can't believe it's not butter...added 1 full tsp of minced garlic...sauteed for a minute or two.  Added bay scallops (frozen store brand), about a tsp of garlic powder, tossed a bit.  Added about a tsp of essence of emeril (original) and a little paprika.  Let sautee 2 minutes, flip around in pan, sautee 2 more minutes.  Add more essence and toss.  Off the heat, add parmesan, toss and throw it over rice!  Add 1 lemon (I like lemon and it helps with the fishy flavor).  Tasty, fresh flavor and quick!

My boyfriend made this last night and it was pretty good.  Made as is except added 2 cloves of minced garlic as well.  We ate the scallops over salad which I would NOT recommend.  Serve over warm pasta to keep the scallops warm throughout the meal.

I love scallops, but have always been afraid to cook them myself. Finally decided to give it a go...WOW! Other than a sprinkle of Old Bay followed the recipe to a T and they turned out perfect! Thanks for sharing.

To me, these were just OK. The scallops I got were still frozen, even though they were from the deli counter, so I am sure that didn't help. When I rinsed them, I rinsed them in hot water to dethaw them a little. I ended up having to cook them for about 15 mins, not the recomended 7 mins because they were cold on the bottom so I flipped them and baked them longer. Again, that is probably from them being frozen. My husband didn't like them because they were "too fishy" tasting. I definetly prefer them grilled on the BBQ. Just brush them with some oil and season with some Johnny's salt. They are not fishy tasting that way and have the smoked flavor, and they are not so heavy with the butter cooked in. I don't think I will make this again. I am sure I would like it more if the scallops were not frozen, but I spent $22 on the scallops and don't want to risk spending that much and not liking them as much as grilling them.

I had mixed reviews on this.  I didn't care for it.  But I'm not a big scallop fan.  He liked it and our friends loved it.....so I think if you like scallops you will love this.  Make sure you get good quality scallops.  Otherwise it's a winner for our family.

Refined seafood taste and texture.  Pleases the adult taste buds. The secret is (In a land-locked state) to find a fishmarket or vendor who regularly receives fresh merchandise. Great, simple, straight forward recipe.

This was an average dish for us.  I used lime with the suggestion of someone else, and I think it was just a little too much on the citrus side.

I added a few red pepper flakes and a little more seasonings, but my husband and I thought they turned out very tender, full of flavor and we will be saving this recipe to make again.  Thanks so much!

I really didn't care for these all that much. The ingredients didn't do much to enhance the flavour of the scallops. It might be because I used large sea scallops instead of the small bay ones, as instructed. I will try this again, though, using the bay scallops and see if it's better because I love scallops and so many reviewers have raved about these.

This was good, however I thought it would have a stronger flavor. I'll still make it again, but I might put in a touch of cajun seasonings for a little kick.

This is a very easy recipe and yet it tastes like you put your entire heart and soul in it. I added more garlic than the recipe called for and served it with a rice pilaf and a salad.  The family loved it.

I didn't have lemon so I used lime instead. I just sprinkled the garlic salt on.  I probably didn't use a whole tablespoon.  My husband agrees these are just as good or better as any you get in a restaurant.

The scallops were very tender, however, WAY TO SALTY.  I will use Garlic Powder next time I make this recipe.  I also added fresh chopped parsley before I broiled them.
