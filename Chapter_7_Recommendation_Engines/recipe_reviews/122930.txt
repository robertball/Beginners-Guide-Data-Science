AWESOME -- just like my family in Alabama makes -- some tips I picked up watching a "behind the scenes" at Bob Evans:  Over-work the dough -- let it mix in the mixer for 5 minutes -- really works up the gluten so the dumplings stay firm -- also, drop dumplings in rapid-boiling water, leaving all that extra flour on the dumplings -- helps thicken the broth and keeps them from sticking.  Thanks for the great recipe -- my family loves it!

This is a very nice recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening and the dumplings turned out great.  My husband loved this recipe.

This was great!  For Shiloh that wants a recipe like CRACKER BARREL's,mix 2 c flour, 1 c milk, 1 Tablespoon baking POWDER, 1 teaspoon salt. Let rest 10 min , roll out and cut into 1/2 inch squares. REAL simple, and delicious!

This is a good recipe for strip dumplings, the only ones that I care for.  What I do differently as taught to me by my mother,father, and grandmother is to make sure not to "over-work" the dough, and to roll out the dough as thin as possible.  Doing this allows for a very tender dumpling that melts in your mouth.  Remember to sprinkle a little more flour on the dumplings as you are rolling them out to prevent sticking and as a base to thicken the gravy. One additional tip is to add these strips to rapidly boiling broth.  You will love the difference the extra work produces.

one must remember when trying this recipe,it does state that it is a "strip" dumpling and not the "fluffy" ones.  Recipe is very good! Thanks!

I made this on a snowy day in Boston- perfect for a southern girl missing home. 
While cooking the chicken, I added carrots and celery. As I was making the dumplings- I realized we needed more- so I made a second batch- and my kids gobbled them up-
A great recipe for strip dumplings

If you use about 3 tablespoons of self raising flour to this (in addition to the flour called for) you will have fluffier strips.

I've been looking for a recipe for dumplings like the ones at the Cracker Barrel restaurant.  It seems like most recipes make fluffy biscuit-like dumplings, but I prefer this type that's more like a noodle.  I've made these twice (with my own recipe for the soup part) and they're yummy, but rather dense and not really like the ones at Cracker Barrel.  I'll continue making this recipe until I find one like Cracker Barrel's!  Thanks for submitting!

My family thought this was terrific. I also used butter as I had no shortening. I plan to double next time because me, my husband and daughter went through the pot quickly! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe. It's is just like a remember my mom's. Sooooo much better than biscuit mix dumplings that have that same flavor. Thanks for the memories! Will definitely make again. My boys loved it!

I don't know what I did wrong but we didn't enjoy this. The dumpling strips were SO heavy, stodgy and glutinous. I ate a few bites, and honestly, got tummy ache. Oh well, you can't win them all. Thanks anyway.

I didn't have any shortening so I used real butter instead.  The dumplings turned out good and I will make them again.  I used my own recipe for the chicken broth, adding chicken bouillon cubes, sea salt, pepper, butter, and poultry seasoning to the water that I boiled the chicken in.

These were easier than I expected.  I didn't add seasoning to the dough to avoid the extra salt, and I needed a little more flour if I was going to roll it, otherwise this recipe was perfect. I also didn't need to roll it out. I just took a ball of it, and used my fingers to flatten and tear each piece.  They come out fine this way (not perfectly shaped, obviously), and it was faster & cleaner than rolling. Light & delicious.  Thanks!

I used butter, and added sauteed celery, onion and carrots to the soup. I also doubled the recipe for our family.  I love your dumpling recipe!  My family loved this, I think it will be my new "go to" dumpling recipe!  Thanks!

I finally made dumplings! This recipe worked great for me. I have tried and tried drop dumplings and usually after simmering them, when I picked up the lid the dumplings were gone! Again, these were great! Thanks and thanks again!

It was easy but the dumplings (and I followed the one reviewer who said to let them mix for 5 minutes) were sort of rubbery. The chicken and broth was good. Probably could use some sauteed onion, carrots and maybe potatoes?

So true about the dumplings being so tender!!  YUMMM!!  I doubled the recipe because I like lots of of them!  I did have to thicken the broth using 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and same measurement of milk.  Love, love, love these dumplings!!!!!

This review is for the dumplings, only.  I did my own version of the chicken and vegetables.   These dumplings are excellent!  Do not expect fluffy, light dumplings and come on here complaining that these were not - we don't want to hear it!  These are the old-fashioned cross between a noodle and a dumpling, and they taste just like Grandma used to make.  I replaced the shortening with butter for an extra flavor boost, and found that you don't need to roll them out...just take 1" balls of dough and flatten them in your palm, then drop in the boiling liquid.  Saves time and mess!

I love this type of dumplings.  My Mother learned this from my Dad's mom and had the same type of problem as Coconutheather.  An easy fix is to make sure the broth is at a hard boil as you drop in your dumplings.  Then after they're all in, turn the heat down, cover and wait.  Hope this works out for you!

Very good dumplings!  Much like what I grew up eating.  I did not make the "broth" part of the recipe, instead just making up my own, but I had no idea how to make the dumpling part before now.  Only change I made was to add pepper to the dough.  This took A LOT of flour to work with after mixing, and made a big mess, but the end result was worth the trouble.  Will make again.

Yummy!   I do this in all my chicken soup recipes now....  Even my father who said "those aren't the real kind of dumpling, like my mother used to make" came back for more.  When I told him I was making these again tonight, I was asked to bring a bowl to his house!  My 8 year picky eater and husband, also picky, both gobble these up.  Thanks for a keeper...

My family and I love this meal. The only thing I changed was using butter instead of shortening, and making them more of "drop-style" dumplings; the strips never quite worked for me. But it tastes really, really good, and I've gotten a lot of compliments every time I make it!

Was not light imo - I think drop fluffy dumplings are better and easier to make. I know I prefer them. But enjoyed giving it a try.

My family was not even impressed by these. They were expecting a more biscuit type fluffier dumpling. These were flat and dense like a pasta noodle. They ate them anyway, but just weren't "wowed" like usual with this recipe.

This was simpler than I thought it would be. Kids really liked the 'square' dumplings. Used leftover cooked chicken and veggies (cooked onions, celery, peppers, carrots) for the soup.

Best dumplings ever! With so few ingredients, I was skeptical, but they were fabulous! I was out of shortening and eggs, so I used butter and Egg Beaters egg whites with no problem. These are what some cooks call "tough" dumplings as opposed to the fluffier dropped style. My 5yo loved it and can't wait for me to make it again!

After a meal of chicken and dumplings at our nearby Cracker Barrel, I came home and decided I was going to learn to make yummy chicken and dumplings at home.  I used this recipe for the dumplings.  I still use my mom's recipe for the stew.  This was, easily, as good as what I had gotten out at C.B.  I have learned that they are best when allowed to stew slowly for maybe a bit longer that the 15/20 minutes recommended.  After their initial simmer time.  I turned off the burner and let the dumplings sit for an additional 15 minutes.  They are a hit with our family.  hope they are a big hit with your family as well.

A great recipe and even better after I modified it a bit. I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 carrots sliced, 2 stalks celery sliced and 1/4 cup chopped onion to the chicken broth before adding the chicken and dumpling strips. When the dumpings were ready I thickened the broth with a mixture of 2 Tbsp. cornstarch and 1/4 cup water.

This recipe was Easy to put together. Had all ingredients, but the poultry seasoning. Did add diced onion, carrots and celery.The instructions where right on with cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Family loved this for its all gone and that is a great sign of job well done. Will make again with the poultry seasoning. Thank You for posting Taste of Home.

I made this for the first time using your recipe, It was great! My husband family loved it and I made it two days in a row. I added extra dill weed and made my own broth. Also added dry sherry and potatoes.

Have made it many times since then, and everyone loves it! Id be lost without this recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for!  My Texan husband complained about others tortilla idea and I became determined to get it right for him.  The rolling out seems like a lot of work, but so worth it.  Thanks so much for sharing!

The dumplings were very good, but reading the salt content, I cut back to 1/4 teaspoon for the amount of flour used. when working with your dough use a light hand, they were tender and light. With the broth, I was in a hurry, so I  sauteed  three diced carrots, celery, onion to soften stage then added broth cooked through, added rotisserie chicken from store, cooked dumplings then thicken broth slightly. Yum! I will make again, also to the other reviews you need some salt in your dough just like pasta this is the only flavoring it will get

This was a nice recipe for chicken and dumplings. Since I'm a vegetarian, I used vegetable broth and soy chicken strips. I also added celery salt and a little ground mustard seed to the dumplings for added flavor.

This is a good recipe, but needs more seasoning to make the "soup" better.  The dumplings turned out well,but after cooking beyond the initial 15 minutes, some of the smaller ones fell apart. I used chicken theighs ( cooked,seasoned & shredded) and seasoned the broth with onion, more salt & pepper, seasoning salt and I added corn starch to thicken it up a bit. This was a good basic recipe, just not what I was hoping to find.

This recipe was Okay, the chicken & the gravish part was very good. The Dumplings were Noodley (Which was good, we liked that.) But there seemed to be too many of them, and hardly any chicken. Also I think the poultry seasoning gave the dumpling a funny flavor, we didn't care much for that. Good recipe though, next time, less dumplings and less or no poultry seasoning.

I added celery and carrots, also made extra broth as others suggested. The kids loved the texture of the dumplings, the wife not so much. I will try them a bit thinner next time and see if she likes that better.

This was a great comfort-food recipe, especially on a winter night. I, too, used butter instead of shortening, and the dumplings were delicious. Everyone in my family loved it, and there were no leftovers.

Really, really good and easier than it may seem!  We are vegetarians so I used veg bouillon cubes and a bag of Morningstar Farms MealStarters "chiken" strips.  I doubled recipe and used 3 bouillon cubes to make 6 C broth, then added 4 additional cups water.  Don't skip the poultry seasoning--it adds a great taste to the dumplings.  Similar to the chicken and dumplings my Mom used to make!  Thanks Gay!

I followed this recipe exactly as originally written, and by the time I took the lid off the pot, I had no gravy, half done dumplings, with nearly burnt chicken on the bottom. I wish I knew what I did wrong b/c I was really looking forward to this :(

My husband was looking for a dumpling recipe "just like Mom used to make" and this one is the closest.  It is WONDERFUL!  Comfort food for both of us and easy to make.

I actually like the old stand-by using Bisquick much better. I know it's a mix and not from scratch, but to each their own. These were not bad, but for the extra work I think I'll stick to Bisquick until I find a dumpling recipe that knocks my socks off.

This was a great recipe!  Next time, I will probably cut the dumplings a little smaller so they're more "bite sized" but my husband and I both loved them!

My mom puts the seasoning in her broth, and no eggs in her slicks, but I was pleasantly surprised at how close this was to hers!  I confess, I used gluten-free flour since we are wheat-free, and I think the eggs played a major part in binding them together in the cooking process. Fabulous!

I followed the recipe to the letter and these dumplings didn't rise at all and were like glue.   Maybe a little baking powder would help. Will not make this again.

I had never made dumplings before and I think these turned out pretty well.  Don't be scared off by the rolling, it was really easy.  I added some carrots and mushrooms to my broth and dumped the whole thing over cut chicken that I had leftover from a roaster (did not cook it in the broth).  The broth needed a bit of thickening but was tasty.

Was easy and quick but a little soupy.  I prefer creamy and thicken soup.  I added 1 can cream of chicken soup and it was perfect.  My first Chicken and Dumplings and eveyone loved it.

I am about to try this recipe and I'm so happy! My grandmother, who emigrated from Poland in 1904, never spoke English. She made chicken dumpling soup that was awesome, and this recipe sounds like the dumpling part. I'm not sure about the poultry seasoning, but will try it. I'll tell you how it turns out.

These taste just like my grandmothers dumplings. I changed a few things though. I used wheat flour instead of regular and I used margarine instead of shortening. I also added chopped carrots and celery to the broth and cooked them before adding the cooked chicken and dumplings. The excess flour on the dumplings is crucial to make the broth the perfect consistency. This is also a great recipe for freezing. It holds up great when frozen and reheated, so go ahead and make a few batches at once while you are making a mess anyway!

I was wanting to try a different kind of dumpling, like the kind I get at Cracker Barrel.  I was very disappointed, I used a different broth with carrots, celery, onions and chicken.  That turned out wonderful.  But the strips were dry and yucky in the middle.  Would definitely not make this recipe again.

The dumplings were just like my husbands gran use to make.  I'm use to a drop dumpling but these were really good.  I added some vegtables and it turned out great.

I followed the recipe to the letter and this was very bland.  The noodles were not light, they were just blah.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  And I certainly would not use the term Dumpling in the title - very misleading.

First of all, this recipe is easy and has a good flavor.  I just can't seem to master the dumplings.  I think the dumplings need to be thinner than 1/4 of an inch.  Plus it needs about 2 cups more broth.
