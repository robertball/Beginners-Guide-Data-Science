I made this tonight 5-5-15, it was quick and easy to make on the grill, had it in the tin foil and on the grill for 15 minutes and it turned out great.

If you're doing this recipe just use cod don't waste a walleye. About made me and my wife sick from so much butter. Ruined 5 good fish fillets.

Pretty bland.  Needs more than the recommended seasoning.  Also cooked it tented for 10 minutes total, no flipping on a 400 degree grilled and it was cooked perfectly.

did not like this recipe one bit.  this was very bland.  none of my kids would eat this again.  I should just stick to my Louisiana beer batter mix than ruin a perfectly good walleye fillet.

Very good, simple campfire food.   I found the cook time was at least 5 minutes too long for my fillets and you have to be very careful as the foil package expands with the steam.   Otherwise tasty and easy.
