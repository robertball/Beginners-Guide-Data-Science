I make these all the time, however they are not what I consider Chilaquiles. I topped them with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese blend and diced onions.. When pressed for time, I open a can of El Pato Mexican Tomato Sauce rather than making it.

This was so good! After I finished eating this, I made another huge portion of the salsa  It was that good. Thank you for the recipe.

No real changes other than added cheese.  Great pretty much as is!
