OMG my mother and I have been making so many variations of this recipe for longer than I can remember! Various rice mixes, or white rice and chicken broth instead of water with whatever spices sound good at the moment - it doesn't matter because this is a very forgiving recipe. A bag of whatever frozen veggie mix is in the freezer, whatever cheese you've got in the fridge... and cream of whatever's in the cupboard soup! Cream of chicken or celery work just as good. Or try cheddar cheese or broccoli cheese.

This is exactly what I was looking for. Some thing healthy quick and easy (plus washing a ton of dishes is not my favorite thing so it's a big plus for me that it's all in one dish). I made a few modifications with the food and time I had on hand, but thank you so much for providing this recipe! For some reason I couldn't find another chicken casserole recipe that used raw chicken, uncooked rice and veggies... so I was excited when I saw this one. It tasted great!

What I changed -seasoned and cooked the chicken, cooked the brown rice and steamed the mixed veggies.  Sautéed fresh mushrooms in olive oil. In a bowl, combined 1 can 99% fat free cream of chicken soup in addition to the 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup (eliminated the can of water).    Cut chicken into bit size pieces and added to soup and mushroom mixture. Sprinkled with garlic salt, dried basil and Cajun spices, then topped with Mozzarella cheese.  Something about the basil with chicken – just gives it a fantastic flavor.  Can refrigerate – freeze or pop in the oven until bubbly.  Easy!!

I thought this was very good. I didn't have any long-grain/wild rice mix on hand, but I did have a box of Rice-a-Roni (broccoli au gratin flavor). It was a perfect compliment to the frozen veggies and cheddar cheese. I also added a splash or two of soy sauce for a little extra kick. Turned out great.

This is a good one dish dinner for a family.    It's not something showstopping for a party, but it got the job done.    I used fresh broccoli, cauliflower, celery and carrots as I had them leftover from a party.   They cooked up well,   I also browned one side of the chicken breast just to give it that 'done' look.   I just dont like the look of stark white chicken.    I'll be adding this to my keepers file for sure!

I subbed 3/4 cup regular long-grain rice and added a little seasoning salt and garlic powder because that's all I had.  I also just used frozen brocolli since that's what we like.   Next time, I'll use milk instead of water and add a little sour cream if I have it. ***The second time I used brown rice, chicken broth instead of water, cream of chicken with herbs soup, and a little sour cream.  Very flexible recipe!

I thought this was really good, and of course, so easy.  I used fresh vegies becuase that's what I had on hand, other than that, didn't change a thing.

Though I’m not normally a huge fan of dishes prepared primarily with processed ingredients, and this didn't suit my tastes, I needed something super-quick to feed hungry people tonight, and this fit the bill; everyone else loved it. I used chopped leftover broccoli, and doubled the cheese. I had to bake mine for an additional 20 minutes, though.

Wonderful dish!  I didn't have flavored rice, so I used brown rice with a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup mix. I diced 2 large chicken beasts and mix it all together before baking.  I used frozen peas & broccoli. Cooked an extrta 10 minutes after uncovering and adding extra cheese on top.  Turned out perfect.  My very picky 4 year old even ate it and said it was yummy!  Thank you for a great base recipe!

Perfect recipe!  Complete meal and for the first time I didn't need to add anything else.  It tasted perfect and the chicken breast were juicy and moist.  I did use a thermometer too make sure my chicken was not overcooked (I absolutely hate dry meat).  I'll be making this many more times over.  Thank you!

This is a good, basic, one dish meal that is easy to make with ingredients that are typically on hand. Tastey and will make again. Next time I may use chicken broth instead of water to add a little more flavor. Cooked for just over an hour to make sure rice was done.

I used golden mushroom soup and added a layer of panko with the cheese on top.  Really good, the whole family loved it.  I put some broccali and carrots with the liquid mixture.  Good comfort food.   Will definitely make again, maybe add extra rice next time.  My crowd can eat!

My husband had several servings...he never seems thrilled with a casserole!  I did some modifications as well. Like others I used chicken broth instead of the water,cut up the chicken into bite size pieces,used fresh broccoli and long grain rice(6oz) I added maybe a 1/4 cup water to compensate and a few dashes of worchester sauce. I added ham and minced onions for additional flavor and covered for 40 minutes & it was done. Thanks for the recipe even though I changed it I wouldn't have tried it without having the building blocks.

I thought this turned out great. It was very simple to make and made great left-overs. My husband and I don't even like vegetables but we both loved this.

Yum! I made mine with cauliflower and broccoli. Next time I will try to use my own seasonings instead of the rice packet to try to decrease the amount of sodium.

Made exactly as is, except I used frozen broccoli/carrots/cauliflower mix and chicken tenderloins (what I had on hand). Delicious and SO EASY! It was a little on the salty side, so I might try reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup (if they make that), but otherwise leaving recipe as is. This will definitely be added to the dinner rotation.

Good recipe, but it needed more juice and took about 15 extra minutes for the rice to really cook (I used brown).  Needs more seasoning and less cream, I made this one because it seemed too easy, but sacrificed the healthiness, unfortunately couldn't get the fat free version of the soup, but this recipe really has potential.

Not great....  The veggies came out very mushy, the chicken wouldn't finish cooking and the whole thing had to bake for 30-45min more (and the pieces in the center still were't really done).  I was disappointed, the whole thing smelled so good!  With some tweaking, I might be able to make it work, but if you're looking for something to make tonight, find something else.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I couldn't find the vegetable blend recommended and used a 12oz bag of broccoli and cauliflower and then added some peas and carrots. I defrosted the vegetables under some hot water before using. I had 3 large chicken breasts so I thinned them with a knife and cut in half to make 6 pieces. I also just used regular mushroom soup and for the cheese used reduced fat. I was thinking this would be more like a casserole. However, when plated it is more like rice seasoned with vegetables and a piece of chicken. My only complaint is the chicken was just not seasoned enough, with just the paprika.

This was ok but not creamy enough for my taste and a little bland.  Next time I will add either some sour cream, mayonnaise or an extra can of soup and some onion or garlic.  It was super easy to make in a pinch and the kids liked it so it's a keeper for me :)

Yummy.  Not exactly a gourmet recipe, but a good, warm casserole for a cold winter night.  Easy to assemble.  I use the only bag of mixed veggies I had: corn, beans, and peas.

This was a fast and easy dish to prep and then it was all waiting for the timer after that. I added a 1/4 c more water as I couldn't possibly see where the rice was going to get all it's moisture from without it. I did season the chicken with low sodium season-all. I didn't have enough cheddar so I used an Italian blend on top. Overall, this was a hearty belly filling dish with no effort at all. It's nice that this was a one pot meal. Great for after work or when you just don't have time to spend fiddling in the kitchen to fix a meal. Overall, while this was alright it was rather bland and needed something more. I doubt I'll fix that again unless it's requested.

Very tasty.  As suggested by others I substituted the water with broth. I also sprinkled a thin layer of savory herb stuffing mix on top of the casserole before adding the chicken. I served with tomato mozzarella salad.

I'm not sure whether I missed a step or not, but the chicken was actually bland. Next time I will fry it or at least season it before mixing with the other ingredients.

Made some substitutions out of necessity (leftover chicken breast and wild rice, frozen chopped green peppers) and took the tip of another reviewer who used sour cream and broth instead of the water.  It was really good!

Sure, it's not fancy, but it is a tasty casserole. I love that you can easily substitute different flavors of what you have in your freezer and pantry, and it makes it easy to get veggies in the dinner. Also, what quick prep time! I had time to make a colorful salad and wash everything I made dirty while it cooked, even though I took the extra step of cutting chicken into bite-sized cubes (for the little ones). * one note, I only used 2 good-sized chicken breasts, I wouldn't have had enough rice and veggies if I'd used 6 breasts!

Yum! I only needed enough for my husband and I, but I still used a whole can of soup, chicken broth instead of water (about 1/2 a soup can worth), and a 1/2 cup of white rice instead of a long grain mix (since that had a lot more calories). I used half a bag of broccoli and cauliflower and an 8oz can of water chestnuts. So tasty! For the chicken, I chopped up about 5 chicken tenders and mixed them in with everything, and added some garlic powder, salt and pepper, and a few dashes of cayenne for a small boost. I made tweaks, but no major changes, and that's a pretty good recipe to me!

yummy.  i did have to make some changes due to lack of ingredients - used Knorrs Side Rice Mushroom flavor, 1/2 cup cheddar in the mixture and 1/2 cup swiss cheese on top, did not have paprika so sprinkled some Tony Chachere's creole seasoning on the chicken tenderloins i cut into big chunky pieces, added onions, left out carrots, and then to make it a company dish, I topped each serving with sliced avacado and toasted almonds.  My husband said it was a keeper.

This is a great way to get a whole meal in one dish.  I altered some of the ingredients to get a little healthier version.  My husband said that it was great!  I'll be using this again!

Loved this recipe for a couple of reasons- Easy prep, easy cleanup and very good!  I made it for a group at work and they were practically licking the pan.  Only thing was the rice was a little tough in some areas, so next time I may go with a non-wild mix.

I liked the concept of this meal, but the chicken sounded very bland as the recipe was written, so I made some modifications.  I rolled the chicken in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper, then dipped it in egg and covered it in Italian bread crumbs. I drizzled it with a couple tablespoons of butter before baking, so the chicken would brown nicely.  I also uncovered the dish for the last 5 minutes of baking and added the last 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to melt.  This made the chicken delicious and flavorful and it worked well with the rice and vegetable mixture.

Easy, tasty (with added seasoning to your taste) to read a large family.  I did find that I had to cook it longer.  Not a gourmet dish but a good family basic.

This was good and easy I used triple the cheese because my family loves cheese, cooked the rice on the stove top in chicken broth, 2% milk in place of water, can of cream of chicken soup, seasoned chicken with lemon pepper then grilled and cut into cubes, 1/8 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, 16 oz frozen vegetables mixed with all ingredients together baked at 375 for an hour. Great base recipe to tweak however you like. Thanks will make again.

Super fast and delicious.  I made it as instructed, but didn't realize it needed to be covered.  Oh well, I will next time, it was still very good.  I could imagine this with a variety of rice mixes.

The idea was great but the chicken took about 30 minutes longer to get fully cooked.  If I make this again, I will at least partially cook the chicken before putting it in the casserole.  I sautéed some onion and celery to put in and used chicken broth instead of water.  My kids aren't big fans of cheesy dishes so I skipped the cheese and put in a little sour cream instead.  That worked out just fine.

I made this for dinner and the only changes I made was I used cream of chicken soup (didn't have any mushroom) and used chicken broth instead of water.  I used fresh baby carrots (cooked a little first) and frozen broccoli for the vegetables, and cut up the chicken into chunks.  Everything was done including the rice and we liked it.  Ate leftover warmed in the microwave for lunch and it was good leftover too.  We will make this again as we both liked it, it was simple and used ingredients that I usually have on hand.

I used 2 cups of instant white rice and 2 cups of water, but in this case, I should have added more spices.  Once we did (after the fact), it was great!  I also cut up the chicken and mixed it in thoroughly before baking, and I really liked it this way.  I think in the future, I might just use 3-4 chicken breast halves, since 6 was a little too much chicken for me.  Otherwise, the wife and I both loved it, and it will be added to our list of quick, but yummy dinners!

My husband and I killed the whole pan in one sitting!  Changes I made: I used leftover rice from the night before instead of uncooked rice, organic chicken broth instead of water, and frozen Tyson grilled chicken strips instead of raw chicken.  I also added some garlic powder and sprinkled Ritz roasted vegetable crackers over the top. Since nothing was raw, I only baked for 45 minutes, probably could have done with less though.  Delish!

Tbis was delicious! I made a few changes because of what some reviews said. I used rice-a-roni, chicken broth instead of water, and I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and mixed it all together. My boyfriend loved it! Thank you very much for the recipe and reviews.

This was decent.  Considering so many of the prior reviews, I was really expecting something out of this world!  It was mediocre.  The upside was how absolutely easy it was to make.  Will I make it again?  Probably.  Will I rave about it?  No.

This was delicious.  I did use fresh veggies, like broccoli, carrots, and celery.  I seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning and the paprika.  Because, I used fresh veggies - I used two cans of cream of chicken soup.  Also substituted the water for chicken broth.

This was really good, I was so happy and surprised b/c a lot of times a casserole recipe online lacks seasoning. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and substituted chicken broth for water and added a little worcestshire. I'll definitely make it again.

It kinda kills me to admit how good this was. So incredibly simple and open to a lot of variations--I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and some frozen broccoli, carrots, and peppers with a light seasoning. I also used chicken broth instead of water as other reviewers suggested, although it might be even better with veggie broth. Little-to-no prep work and TONS of flavor are always welcome in my house!

We really thought this was great. It is very flavorful to be so easy. I cut my chicken into pieces, and mixed it in, which I would not suggest doing. My chicken did not get done before it had gotten too thick, but even being overcooked, it was still delicious. I want my chicken to be in chunks, so next time I will cook it just a little first before putting in the dish. I also added the cheese and a can of fried onions to the top and broiled til browned. This with the chestnuts gave it a nice crunch. Will definitely make again. Great recipe, thanks for sharing

Tasty.  The Ghanaians liked it - said it was similar to Jollof.  I thought it was great and very easy to throw together.

This recipe seems even tastier when I consider how quickly and easily it came together. I used a can of garlic mushroom soup and didn't have seasoned rice, but a little basil and some basmati rice hit the spot. I also used broccoli, peas, and mushrooms for my vegetables. Next time, I think I will pre-cook the rice, as there were some crunchy bits.

my 10yo daugter wanted to make dinner so I gave her this recipe...she used a box of uncle ben's rice and picked out a bag of frozen veggies that she liked but otherwise followed recipe exactly. It was so easy to make she didn't even need help.  It was a huge hit at dinner and everyone wanted more...next time we'll double or even triple the recipe!

We enjoyed this, but found it to be a bit salty. Might only use half of the seasoning package from the rice mix next time. I actually put this together in the crock pot as we needed dinner ready as soon as we got home. I cubed the chicken and used low-sodium chicken broth, but it needed the water too so as not to be too dry in the crock pot. I used frozen peas and carrots and added a half can of french green beans for the veggies. I simply added the cheese as soon as we got in and it melted thru while setting the table and pouring drinks. It definitely worked and we'll do it again!

I was excited to try this recipe because I love one-dish meals.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the dish to be very bland.  If I ever make it again, I will definitely add seasonings and will probably also cut the chicken breast into bite-size pieces.

Dinner was OK...chicken was dry.  So the next time I'll place the chicken on the bottom and the rice/veg on top.

I love the idea of putting raw ingredients into a dish and throwing it in the oven, to all cook together, but I can't ever seem to get this dish to work. The rice never seems to be cooked properly. Now, I am wondering if it is my mistake because I used normal (plain) white rice instead of a seasoned rice mix. Is the rice in a pre-seasoned mix parboiled or otherwise partially pre-cooked? That might explain why my rice always comes out tasting raw when I try to make dishes like this, and that is the reason I am giving four stars instead of three — because it may be my mistake. I also recommend seasoning the chicken with more than just paprika. I used garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper + paprika. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The chicken was good — tender and juicy, and seasoned nicely. The flavor in the rice and veggies tasted fine, but my husband said he thought the rice was too raw, and so he didn't like it. My kids didn't want anything to do with it! But that's fairly typical...

Yum. I just made this bc it's just me and my 5 year old home tonight so why go crazy, and I'm glad I did. As per other suggestions I "bouillon cubed" the water, I also subbed out the frozen veggies for some fresh steamed broccoli. Only had two whole chicken breasts so I took out the bones as I cleaned them and sliced them into strips, I also marinated them in some Italian Dressing while I prepped the veggies and the sauce mixture. It was tasty, I snapped a picture which I'll post. The only thing I'll change next time is doubling the rice.

Not having a microwave is sort of inconvenient...but this was SO easy, I had all the ingredients on hand, and it tastes pretty great. I used marinated b/s chicken breasts, cubed into chunks (afraid it wouldn't cook through whole). The only other thing I did different was leave out the cheese--it's good, though! The only problem I had is that the rice didn't cook completely.

Just made this tonight for the first time. It actually took an hour and a half, and the wild rice wasn't cooked enough, which is the main reason for the mediocre rating... Because it cooked a bit long, the veggies were a bit mushy. The flavor was good, and I can see it being easy to substitute different options. We liked it enough to try again- I will use fresh carrots/broccoli and pre-cook the wild rice a bit.

Turned out great. This is the perfect easy munchie food. I altered the recipe by using cream of chicken and adding about a 1/2 cup of sour cream. About 15 minutes before it was done baking I added a little bit of couscous to absorb some of the extra moisture, 5 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon and extra cheese. It was delicious with sriracha on top. Had my guests closing their eyes and making funny noises while they ate... lol. I think next time I will use chicken broth instead of water and maybe add some caramelized onions.

This recipe was fast and easy.  It turned out well except for the fact that it took about 25 minutes more to cook than the recipe stated in order for the rice to be soft enough.  My family enjoyed it and thought it was worth the wait!

We all liked this, including our 3 year old.  I used fresh asparagus instead of frozen veggies, and it was really good.  I would suggest letting it set up for about 5 minutes after removing from the oven and serving.

This was surprisingly good for how little preparation was needed!  I was happy to throw raw and frozen items into a 9x13 and just have an hour to do other things.  I used frozen chopped onion, frozen peas, and frozen green beans.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion of seasoning the chicken with more than paprika and adding a splash of worcestershire sauce. I used tenders vs whole breasts and cut them into large chunks.

Very Quick, Easy, and Good! Can use frozen veggies of your choice for variety or for picky eaters. Makes enough for left overs, which reheat well. It's not fancy but hits the spot.

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe and used a bag of broccoli and a bag of carrots separately. Next time I won't use the chestnuts because it took away from the other veggies.

It's not bad, and very easy to make - finding the right size long grain wild rice pack really helps - try Uncle Tom's - the Rice Roni boxes are two small now since they've reduced their size. It also helps to season your chicken a bit as well. Helps with the bland taste issue.

Easy recipe to make the night before.   I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces as one reviewer suggested and used chicken stock in place of the water.  I used 98% fat-free cream of mushroom soup, and used a box of chicken flavored Rice-A-Roni.  I did cook the rice beforehand as I've never had much luck using uncooked rice in dishes....it always comes out crispy and not quite done. Flavorful and healthy dish that I will make again.

We found this a little on the bland side. It was nice and cheesy though. I didn't have the wild rice mix so as another reviewer said rice a roni worked just as well. I suggest thawing out the frozen vegetables before adding. Just a little over an hour was needed to cook.
