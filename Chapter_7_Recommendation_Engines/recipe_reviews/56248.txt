While this wasn't the best chicken dinner I've ever had, I had to rate it a 5 for being delicious and creative!  I would have never in a million years considered putting chocolate on chicken, but it really works.  The chicken was wonderfully moist and I love the smell of cooking chocolate.

Delicious!  Even my finicky 8 year old loved it.  I used a whole fryer to make this recipe, had to cook the chicken in 2 batches.   Served it with frijoles and gorditas. Great recipe!

Chicken was too sweet from the marinade but the sauce was bitter. Didnt have a lot of depth of flavor; surprising from the number of ingredients.
