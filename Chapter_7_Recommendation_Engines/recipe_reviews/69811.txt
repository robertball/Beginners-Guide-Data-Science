These are fabulous.  I had to make several batches of these for family members over the weekend...they couldn't get enough.  I used sweet and sour mix in place of the sprite and left out the vodka since we didn't have any.  Great summer drink.

tried this one but it needs sour mix to balance out the sweet. Am now hooked on the Melonade recipe on this site.

This recipe with sweet and sour instead of the lemon lime soda, and served as a shot is also known as a KRYPTONITE shot. A friend got me hooked on these, they're great.

This was very tasty. I used Smirnoff vanilla vodka and Melon Pucker, because that's all I had on hand. Different from your usual cocktail. Pretty, too.

LOVE THIS! This has been a summer staple for me for 20 years! Usually its just the midori- but when we add rum its coconut- absolutely fabulous1 Garnish with a sprig of mint. Dressed up or down its the perfect summer cocktail:)

A little on the sweet side, but a great refreshing summer drink for poolside, lakeside or backyard entertaining.

I made it with Hendrix Gin instead and with it's hint of cucumber the flavor was excellent.

A little something extra to help balance it out would be better.

Excellent drink, however, if you dont like it too sweet, substitute half or all seltzer for lemon lime soda. Very good!
