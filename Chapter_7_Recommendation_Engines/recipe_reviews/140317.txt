I tried this in my crepes. It was ok, I didn't have bananas and I added pecans to the filling. It was..ok. It was kinda runny, maybe cream cheese would be better then sour cream.

I loved this  recipe. But I did add a few things. I added Strawberries intead of bananas. I added counut and pecans. That got rid of the sourcream taste. It tasted like cream cheese.

I liked this idea, but I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and topped with peaches.  It was a nice variety from my usual crepe fillings.

Perfect filling.  I didn't find it too thin at all.  I use strawberries and bananas with this recipe.  Delicious!

I thought the filling was ok how it was but I wanted it to be sweeter so I added a dash of vanilla extract and cinnamon and it's taste so good! Tastes a little like yogurt so I'm thinking of trying that for a filling next time instead of sour cream.

Only way I could eat this was to squish out all the filling and just eat the crepes my husband had made. I wanted to like it since it sounded interesting, but it was honestly dreadful.

As written, this was just ok. The flavor is a bit flat, albeit the banana does give it some depth, it still is missing something. I think the addition of some vanilla, nutmeg or cardamon would really give this some dimension and depth of flavor. It is very liquid making it more a sauce than a filling, but drizzles nicely over the banana. I topped it with some unsweetened cocoa powder. Thank you for the recipe.

Being French Canadian, my grandpa used to just eat the sour cream and brown sugar on its' own. That's how I thought it was supposed to be eaten. :)  But absolutely delicious in the crepes. Yum!

incredibly simple and everyone loved.  takes just a few seconds to mix together.  I thought the cream would accent the bananas.  I was wrong.  I went too heavy on the bananas.  the cream filling is the highlight in my opinion.  fill the crepes with cream and fold and fold.  then top the crepe with 4-6 banana slices and drizzle cream over bananas.  I also dust with powder sugar and add I dollop of whip cream.  too good.  everyone wanted more.  I ran out.  this is now one of our regular dessert options.

Tastes very similar to a fruit dip I've had in the past. Seems way too loose for a filling. I might try it again but cut down on the sour cream and add cream cheese instead. I didn't put in the confectioner's  sugar.
