I have minor criticisms of this recipe and made minor changes - nevertheless it is a wonderful dish Hubs and I both enjoyed. The potatoes are perfect just as written. The recipe doesn't specify, but for color and interest I didn't peel them and added chopped fresh parsley at the end.  Don't be tempted to just boil the garlic along with the potatoes - you'll lose a lot of flavor!  I used the ground hazelnuts on half the filets, ground almonds on the other and Hubs and I agree the almonds were the clear winner. I love hazelnuts but in our view they're too sweet to coat fish with. I made my own fresh bread crumbs, seasoning them lightly with an Italian seasoning blend. I used grouper filets and brushed them with olive oil before coating them on both sides with the nut/bread crumb mixture. Because my filets were thin I didn't bother to finish cooking them in the oven - a few minutes in the skillet on both sides cooked them perfectly.  The browned butter was a nice touch, but we agreed we could have done without it. I don't think it makes that much a difference in taste and all that extra butter just wasn't necessary.  Omitting it would not diminish the dish and would save a lot of calories as well as an extra step in the preparation. I served this with fresh asparagus which was the perfect complement and made for a beautiful presentation.

Delicious!!  The crust on this halibut is so, so good!  I loved the mashed potatoes because I love garlic, but some of you might want to cut down from 5 cloves, but if you love buttery, garlicy mashed potatoes with tender halibut you will love this recipe!  This is my new favorite and I can't wait to try this out on other fish. Loved it!

I never had halibut before and it was delicious with this recipe.  I had bought frozen halibut from Costco and defrosted it in the refrigerator over night. I did almost exactly what the recipe says except I used only about 4 tablespoons of butter and for the broth I dissolved a knorr's vegetable bullion cube and used about 4 tablespoons of that. I wish I had used more broth, it was very tasty with the browned butter. The recipe calls for 2 halibut steaks, I made 3, so I thought I would need to increase the nut/bread crumbs so I made 1/3 cup of each, it was way too much, the regular recipe is enough for at least 4 steaks. Overall it was an excellent dinner; and it was so easy and quick to make.  I will definitely make it again.

This review was based on the fish only, as I didn't make the potatoes as directed.  I also omitted the browned butter, as I felt it wasn't really necessary.  That being said, this fish recipe was excellent.  I made this for hub's birthday after he came home with 30 lbs of halibut from an Alaskan fishing trip.  I ended up cooking the fish in the pan completely rather than finishing in the oven  - this is partly b/c I don't have an oven-safe skillet, but also b/c I didn't feel it necessary.  I served with another garlic mash recipe from this site, steamed asparagus, and the beet salad from this site.  We both LOVED it.    NOTE:  The recipe as written will leave you with a lot of extra bread crumb/nut topping.  I kept the leftovers in ziplock bag and made this again a week later with following variations:  preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Line a cookie sheet with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray (easy cleanup).  After rinsing filets, pat dry and sprinkle w/ salt.  Lightly dredge in flour, then dip filets in milk, then pat into nut mixture.  Place nut side up on cookie sheet and place a pat of butter on top of each filet.  Bake for 8-15 mins, depending on thickness (ours took about 15 mins, as they are close to an inch thick).  This version turned out excellent too, but was a little easier.  I still had left over topping and used again for chicken (in the oven) - yum!!!  Overall - fantastic recipe that will become a staple in our house!

I am only rating the halibut....and it was great! I used panko bread crumbs because I like a nice crisp crust. It turned out perfectly. My 3 yr old kept shoving it in his mouth. I'm always looking for new ways to jazz up fish, so this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing this one.

I made some slight changes both in preparation and in the ingredients.  
I don't normally like using seasoned bread crumbs only b/c they're rarely seasoned to suit my taste.  I switched in some panko bread crumbs (same quantity) and added in 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp garlic salt.
My fillets were rather large and they wouldn't fit in my saute pan so I lightly greased a casserole dish, and then brushed each fillet w/ unsalted butter.  I sprinkled the seasoned breadcrumbs on top and baked it for the same time frame w/ the nut side facing up.  
Since I added garlic salt to the breading I chose not to add garlic to the mashed potatoes.  This was a belly busting meal but OH my it was good!!!!

Substituted the hazelnuts with slivered almonds and it was fantastic. I also never thought to make a garlic/salt paste to add to mashed potatoes after cooking... it's way better than dropping garlic in while boiling.

Restaurant quality and definately worth trying! Instead of mashing the garlic separetly I boil them along with the potatoes and just mashed them together in my opinion the mashed potatoes are a little dry so I added about 1/3 of a cup of fat free half and half. Used tilapia instead of halibut but I'm sure it's a lot better with halibut next time I'll use that and also didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. Overall an excellent recipe that we will be having many times in the  future.Thanks Jas Bradley for sumitting your recipe. Elvira S.

I am rating the mashed potatoes only which I prepared with a different halibut recipe.  Overall the potatoes were delicious but  I would use slightly less garlic...5 cloves is a lot unless they're all small cloves.  I would also add a little bit of milk to make these potatoes creamier.  Just add until the consistency is how you like it.  Without a bit of milk, we found the potatoes too dry.  Otherwise I'd rate the potatoes higher.

This halibut recipe is really good!  All of my 3 kids (ages 7 - 2) love it, and that is saying something.  I make this at least once a month.  Personally I find it a bit labor intensive with a lot of steps, but definitely worth it.  The first time I didn't use the browned butter sauce, and it was great, and the second time I used it and it was great too. I will probably skip it in the future just to save some calories.  Overall a super recipe!  Thanks Allrecipes and JasBradley!

Delicious but quite time consuming. Halibut very yummy; I added a couple spoons of buttermilk ranch dressing while mashing potatoes, for more moistness. Have to say it all tasted like fine restaurant fare for sure!

Delicious.  Because Halibut doesn't have a lot of flavor I will coat both sides of the Halibut next time I make this.

We loved both the fish and the potatoes! The only thing I did different was that I transferred the fish to a shallow dish as my pan was not ovenproof. I then brushed on some of the brown butter sauce and sprinkled more of the hazelnut bread mixture on before finishing cooking.
