Very good, added some spinach and ricotta cheese to the mixture. Also, let it cook for 30 minutes before throwing the cheese on top and letting it melt.

I've been trying to reduce the carbohydrates in my diet and this recipe really helped me on Friday night which is my family's "pizza night".  The zucchini in this recipe is the "crust". First I sprinkled garlic powder on the scooped out zucchini shells.  I substituted pizza sauce for the pasta sauce and I browned and crumbled italian sausage instead of using the frozen burger style crumbles. In addition, I only used half as much bread crumbs and twice as much parmesan cheese.  It satisfied my pizza craving and I didn't feel like I missed my favorite food.  Thanks!!

I assumed TVP is a generic term and used "no meat sausage", which I browned with green onions and musrooms.  I followed someone's earlier advice and switched to a 4-cheese blend.  And I couldn't find italian bread crumbs, so I put 2 slices of whole wheat bread in the blender.  My family (and my son's vegetarian girlfriend) loved it.  I'll be doing this again.

This was a great recipe for my homegrown zucchini.  My daughter loved it. Instead of the burger crumbs I fryed up some mild italian sausage and it was a hit with my family.

This was yummy!   My family was skeptical, as the presentation isn't REAL attractive, but they agreed the taste was great!  I used 2 cups of browned ground round, as we don't like the TVP.  My zucchini were small, so I used only a small portion of the scooped out portion in the recipe.  Even then there was quite a bit of leftover filling, which I baked separately.  This recipe will be a great help when we are overrun with our garden zucchini!  Thanks!

Really, really good!  Per other reviews, I baked the extra stuffing along side the stuffed zucchini.  I also topped off the zucchini and extra stuffing with some mozzerela cheese the last few minutes of baking.  Too good!

We really liked this. I had leftover meat spaghetti & fresh mozz so I decided this would be good. I make my own bread crumbs & didn't even use the parm. Really tasty, I'll make it often!

I modified the recipe alot but it was great I will definitely try it again keep it italian even rather than the Mex sytle my husband loved.  I didn't have any TVP so I used ground beef left over from last nights burritos (already spiced and tomatoed) and Salsa in place of the pasta sauce, I left out the parmesan and it wasn't really needed with the salsa.  Next time I'll try it Italian style.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I added a bit of onion and garlic for more flavor as well as a small amount of hamburger meat instead of the meat substitute.  thank you for a good recipe.

It turned out fine but would probably be better suited to a sweeter spaghetti sauce.  I used my grandfather's saltier spaghetti sauce recipe which I think is better paired with meat instead of vegetables.  Parmesean cheese always makes an Italian dish better though.  I'd still make it again.

This is really terrific! Great with the TVP. The family loved it and wanted seconds & thirds! I would chop up the zucchini after scooping it out of the "shell". The recipe doesn't say to do this, but it helped to blend all the ingredients better. Thanks for the great recipe!

I loved this!  I too followed some reviewers advice and used some ricotta in the filling as well as ground turkey instead of the meat substitute that I browned first.  Will definitely make again!

Needed a lot more red sauce and mozzerella. I also carmelized half an onion and blended into the mix.

I used hamburger meat and it was pretty good. My zucchini was quite large so it was a little crunchy, next time I will cook it a little longer. Overall pretty good receipe for zucchini!

I thought this recipe was very good, even without the burger style crumbles. My husband didn't like it though. He doesn't like zucchini~ the things you find out after one and a half years of marriage~ sheesh!

This was absolutely delicious!!  I had some monster zucchinis that came out of our garden and this was the perfect recipe for them!  I will say though that frozen burger crumbles did not sound appetizing so I chose to use ground turkey instead.  Just make sure to season everything as you go  because zucchini doesn't have a lot of flavor.  We added garlic and seasoned the bread crumbs w/ italian herbs/salt/pepper and also seasoned the ground turkey and spaghetti sauce too!  Overall I give this recipe a big thumbs up!!! If you have big zucchini, this is perfect as it can hold a lot of the stuffing mix :)

This was a good recipe but next time I'll probably spice it up a bit more and use italian sausage in place of the breakfast sausage I had to use up.  Overall, a nice way to use zucchini.

Average recipe. Make sure your zucchini is very fresh otherwise it will be bitter. I think this would be better if the zucchini were sliced and then mixed with the other ingredients.

I chopped up the zucchini into big chunks and also added a little oregano in addition to the other ingredients. I baked it for 20-30 minutes.  It's now one of our favorites.  Another variation we like-- add extra spaghetti sauce and serve over pasta.

A staple now.  YUM!  Tastes like pizza, but healthier and not greasy.  We love this, especially with a four-cheese pizza blend instead of the mozzarella.

Made this with sausage instead of the burger crumbles and it was really really good, however it covered up the taste of the fresh zucchini that I got from a friend =(.  But it was amazing, and it reheated real well in the microwave.  Used Italian breadcrumbs and that really made the dish.  Thank you!

This was pretty good the first time around, but defintitely not so great leftover the next day.  I forgot to add the hamburger meat that I cooked, maybe that would have helped give it the extra something it seemed to be lacking.

This was really good and super easy.  My husband and I agreed that it needed salt and garlic, but the recipe is definately a keeper.

So SO good! We loved it! Colette must have had a small zucchini, because ours served both my fiance (who normally has 2 servings, me, AND we had leftovers!

Absolutely delicious!  This is a great way to get people who don't like vegetables to eat some.  When I had some zucchini that were too thin to scoop out, I just chopped them into small chunks, and then followed the rest of the recipe.  It was equally delicious and super easy.

Veganized this recipe very easily and it was AMAZING! Sub soy crumbles for ground beef, nutritional yeast flakes for parmesan and Earth Island moz shreds for the cheese. Sooo good

This was amazing! I made it just as the recipe said except I cooked up Italian turkey sausage because that's what I had available. I used Prego sauce and with the remaining sauce and sausage and poured over after cooking. So yummy!

This is tasty crowd pleaser for the vegetarians in my life.  You can add just about anything you like to this recipe.  Of course I omitted burger crumbles and added a bit of frozen chopped spinach and 2 Tbsp feta cheese along with some fresh chopped basil and oregano from the garden.  In place of mozzarella I used Monterey Jack which was a tasty way to top it all off.

any time you make a spaghetti dinner you can't go wrong adding zucchini to it.try proccesing the zukes in a blender and cooking it along with the sauce,adds great flavor as well as making the sauce a little thicker.

I made this a bit different, but kept the ingredients the same.  I sliced and hollowed out my zucchini and cooked them on the bbq grill first.  Then added the rest of the ingredients, omitting the cheese to keep the calories down.  I liked it, but didn't love it.

This was surprisingly a good recipe. I didn't use the burger-style crumbles. I never know what to do with zucchini so this is a great new dish.

Sorry, I did not like this at all. The filling was very bland. Then again maybe I am just sick sick sick of zucchini.

Not to our liking. I didn't add any crumbles, that may make the difference.

Great recipe, I just brown some ground beef.  I've also added a bit of salsa to the beef for a little extra flavor.
