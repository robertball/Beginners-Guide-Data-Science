I make this for the holiday's but I alway add extra sage or poultry seasoning, some melted butter along  with the broth, sauted onions and celery put it in a casserole and bake it covered @350 for 30 min or so in the oven.  I think it comes out much better

I just wanted to add that when I make this stuffing, I also add browned, crumbled sage-flavored pork sausage. Mix a couple of tablespoons butter or margarine, extra sage, fresh herbs of your choice into the broth, and don't forget to add chopped walnuts or pecans for some crunch.  The celery and onions will add crunch too if not chopped too fine. Can't wait to have Thanksgiving dinner..

I use Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing each Thanksgiving...but I add a pan of homemade cornbread, much more onion and celery which I sautee first, I also add an egg and much more broth. The herb dressing just adds the herb flavoring for the dressing and I have been making it this way for years and everyone always wants the recipe.  I just guess at the ingredients until it is the consistancy that I want.   Try this and add anything you want and you will see how easy it is.   Alex

Pepperidge Farm makes delicious Stuffing cubes & crumbs.  It does need more chicken broth than listed here & I always add butter & more herbs, i.e.; sage, rosemary, parsley.  Chopped apple is tasty in this as well.  It is good inside the turkey or baked as a side.

I am usually against using processed, prepared ingredients in almost everything.  But this stuffing recipe is so 'right' to my and my family's taste that we would all feel as though Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners were 'wrong' without it. We much prefer the flavors and texture of this very traditional stuffing to ones that contains lumps of fruit, etc.  I highly recommend it for anyone who misses their grandmother's stuffing.

Nice simple recipe for classic homestyle stuffing. And it's a great accompaniment to roast chicken or a Thanksgiving turkey. Plus it's a great base for add-in's so you can put your own twist on it. I added a little poultry seasoning, thyme and sage. I also added a little melted butter for some additional moistness and flavor. Next time I might add in some sauage, apples or cranberries - YUM!

this was rather bland. ok if very short on time. better to make your own cornbread and crumble it. use lots of onion, celery and bellpeper. season well with salt, pepper and mrs dash original. use good brand of chicken broth and bake till golden on top and still moist inside!

Found this similar recipe on the Campbell's site, but it called for more broth and had better reviews, so I went with that recipe, but it was still not good. VERY VERY dry, and I tried adding more chicken broth, and it didn't help. Stove Top would've been better! Won't make this again.

I added some dried cranberries in addition.  Came out a little dry, but otherwise pretty good, more interesting than just plain stuffing.

When I make this, I saute carrot and garlic with the celery (quite a bit more than called for, at least four stalks, depending on how big my celery is) and onion in about a quarter cup of butter (or more, depending on how much veggies I end up having.....we like a buttery stuffing) before I add it to the stuffing ingredients and right before I stuff my bird, I add in some cooked italian sausage and a couple good shakes of poultry seasoning. For those who don't stuff the bird--this can be made ahead and kept warm in your crockpot until dinner, this way you're not scrambling to find an open burner at the last minute.

As with Cora, I too bake this in the oven, covered for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I like to add extra onion and celery to this. I also add a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup to help it bind together and add an extra touch of creaminess :)  Such a delicious dish! A Thanksgiving must-have

Stuffing was always my favorite Thanksgiving dish growing up, and I was a bit disappointed in this. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Not sure what was wrong. Perhaps I put too much in the bird and didn't give it room to expand?

After reading all of the reviews, I decided I would add more broth - and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I threw in a little sage and used onion,  celery, AND sausage.  We really liked it.

I really really dislike rating recipes low, but this was very dissapointing. Dressing is really only made once a year and should be made very well in my honest opinion. My typical recipe has quite a few ingredients and is smooth, soft, buttery, and absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, to give the truest opinion though. However, this just tasted like moist seasoned croutons, with an odd texture, with large pieces of boiled celery and onions. Butter is just a must in good dressing. I also feel dressing should be very moist and then baked. I even add eggs to mine. I give it to this recipe that it is quick, but not up to par with a family Thanksgiving. The recipe may be a money or time saver for boxed dressing, but it is not something I normally buy.

Good basic recipe but here are some modifications that will jazz it up!  1) I bake it in the oven which means you cut the broth back to a cup.  Saute 1 small onion, chopped and 2 celery stalks chopped in 1/4 cup melted butter.  Add 1 tsp ground sage, stir everything together and bake for 30-40 min at 350.  I haven't tried it yet but thinking of adding an egg as a binder.  Very traditional and tastes like my moms!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for using 50% less sodium broth, and I'm really glad I did.  This was very salty, even with low sodium broth.  I felt the liquid ratio was a little off, too.  I baked some BLSL chicken, with no added salt, and added the liquid from the chicken pan to the stuffing, probably about another 3/4 c.  I felt it needed additional liquid just to moisten all the crumbs.  This might be a jumping off place if you have never made stuffing before, but it definitely needs some tweaking for us to enjoy it.

This is a good basic recipe.  I added some pork sausage as that's the way my mom always made it.  The sausage added a lot of flavor.  Next time I will saute the onion and celery with the sausage.  While I was finishing up dinner I put it in the oven to keep warm.

I have made this for more than 10 years- with the follow alterations- reduce the broth to 1 cup, add 1 cut up granny smith apple and three tablespoons of butter. Then stuff the stuffing in your turkey.

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it. But it did come out really dry. I added close to a cup more of chicken broth than the recipe called for to make it more moist

Loved it! This is a great quick recipe! I followed the directions except I mixed the ingredients in a casserole dish with an egg and baked in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  We like the crispiness the top gets and the egg makes it richer.  This will be my go to stuffing recipe for a quick side dish!

This recipe was very similar to a family recipe I use every year, so I decided to add the chicken broth rather than the family's traditional water.  A few tips to get more taste from this:  add poultry seasoning (at least 2 teaspoons or to taste - I use 1 TBSP with one bag of the herb stuffing)and add salt to taste.  You may want more than a "generous dash" of pepper as well.  This DOES need more added to it.  I have never found Pepperidge Farm Herb Stuffing to have enough herbs in it to flavor stuffing.  You will need to add more to it to get a good flavor.  The difference between this stuffing and the family one is the amounts of onion and celery.  The family stuffing also tends to not be dry and cooked in the bird (which is brined) for additional flavor.

I thought I' give this a try before the holidays and while it was okay (good), I did think it was too salty.  I've never used the Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing mix before, I've always made homemade stuffing, and adding sage sausage, where I can adjust the seasoning and salt content.  We liked it for a quick and easy side dish but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again in the future.  It may have been better using the unseasoned stuffing mix.

Have to admit it, this one surprised me.  What a good recipe for a weeknight dinner.  IMO this tastes as good as the box stuff (you all know the one) at only a fraction of the cost and is as easy to make.  I did take the "tip" on the recipe and added in some chopped pecans and dried cranberries

I could see this being a very easy way to do stuffing--especially for those making their own turkey dinner for the first time.  It's been a long time since I used prepared chicken broth because I make my own following a dinner using a whole chicken.  I was caught off-guard by how salty this was, though that could have been because of using both a package mix and the broth.  I did saute in a touch of butter my celery, carrots, and onion before adding them to the mix.  Hubby thought it was a good accompaniment to the half turkey breast dinner that we enjoyed.

I have made my dressing with Peppridge Stuffing mix for many years.  I use one pkg. Herb & 1/2 pkg.cornbread stuffing mix.  I add about 2 ribs celery, 1/2 of an onion, 2 green onions, 1/2 stick of butter melted & I cut up the giblets.  I sautee the onion & celery first then add giblets & saute until done.  Add to bread mixture.  Like some of the other reviews, I add chicken broth until it gets to the right consistency.  Then I add about 3 to 4 eggs. Mix well & put in buttered casserole & bake at 350 for about 30-40 minutes.  Enjoy!

This dressing, though not homemade, is very tasty. I prefer homemade cornbread dressing but my Yankee family doesn't like it so I make this and they eat it up. Fast, easy and good to stuff in bird also...

By all means use the Pepperidge Farm...it is the best.  BUT add, in addition to the sautee'd onion and celery, some mushrooms sautee'd with the celery and onion, some water chestnuts for crunch, and even some chopped oysters.  An egg will bind it all together.   I also throw in a generous splash of Vermouth.  Start  with the Pepperidge Farm and let your imagination do the rest.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was bland, bland, bland. My husband liked it, but that's coming from someone who thinks adding pepper is being exotic. I should've followed my gut and gone for something else with more flavor.

I needed about 1/4 cup more chicken broth and the sage suggested by earlier reviewer would have been a great touch. Still - it turned out pretty good considering how simple and fast it was.

This stuffing was good as made, but I like to add in sausage and extra veggies to make it my own.  I am also one of those people who still stuffs their turkey... All in all though, I liked this!  Next time I make this, I will do my usual tweaking :-) P.S. My inlaws LOVED this as written, so how can I complain???

Yum! My stuffing turned out perfectly. I did switch things up by adding a pan of crumbled cornbread and extra broth, and I baked it for about 35 mins instead of just making it on the stove. It was a great stuffing for Thanksgiving, and I would surely make it exactly as the recipe states if I were looking for a quick weekday side.

I have made this recipe with both Pepperige Farm herbed seasoned stuffing mix and the cornbread mix.  I prefer the cornbread mix. This was my mother's recipe that she taught me. I do mine differently and add more to it.  Start by browning slightly the medium to finely  chopped onions and celery in 1/2 stick or more of butter in a dutch oven.  Add 1 carton of  broth (chicken or turkey) and stir. Add 2 T or to taste of ground sage. Stir again.  Add 1 can of Campbells Cream of Celery soup diluted with a can and half of chicken or turkey broth or stock. Stir to mix well. Bring to a boil. Turn heat to low and slowly add the cornbread stuffing mix and carefully stir until mixed. I have added chopped chicken meat taken from the chicken I made the broth from also. If you use the chicken, put it in and stir before adding the stuffing mix. You can make it as moist or as dry as you want by using more or less cornbread mix. I prefer it moist. I have doubled and tripled this recipe as needed for the number of guests I have.  I have to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas by request from all my family.

I made this according to the recipe and we were not fans.  After "stirring lightly to coat", the bread crumbs stayed pretty hard in the middle.  It just had a weird type of texture/consistency.  The flavor was ok, but the mouthfeel was not.  This will not be a repeater at the LTH household (and the leftovers found a new home in the garbage can).

In my opinion, not all that moist.  I had to add an extra half cup broth at the end to moisten it up a bit.  I did add quite a few ingredients, which may be the culprit, so I am only taking one star away for less than moisture.  Otherwise this recipe is a pretty simple, standard stuffing recipe.  I added, 1/2 lb. breakfast sausage, 8. oz sliced mushrooms, a handful of pomegranite flavored cranberries, and five small boxes of rasins (my kids had them).  This ended up being a little bit too sweet for me, next time less dried fruit.  With this type of recipe it is really easy to play around with flavors you like.

This was definitely better than simply following directions for a box of stuffing, but still pales in comparison to a real homemade stuffing.  The family enjoyed it.

This recipe is a good base recipe to use as a starting point and time saver.  However, I like to add additional celery and onions as well as sage, poultry seasoning, black pepper and parsley.

All loved it.  I added a carton of chicken livers and mushrooms to the saute of onion, celery and butter.  As the livers cooked, chopped them.  Needed about a can and a half of chicken broth.

Always great to have a reliable shortcut that everyone likes. Use about 2 cups of chicken or vegetable broth and add more if the mix looks dry. You can use a low fat magarine because no one can tell the difference and that chops off some calories. I always add chopped water chesnuts for crunch.

This was ok. My family didn't really like it but we aren't big fans of "box/bag" stuffing. I did cook the onion and celery with butter first out of habit.

Not to bad for a quick side dish during the week but I thought this really lacked flavor. Instead of boiling the veggies I sauteed then with a little bit of butter when they were soft I added the broth. Could have used some extra seasoning but I was short on time. Gravy made it lots better :)

I wanted to follow this recipe 100% but I really dislike celery so I substituted mushrooms instead. My husband then butts in, "You should put some sausage it that!" Well, I am glad I listened because it was my favorite yet!

I added butter and sauteed the celery and onion for a bit. I also added sage to it. It was okay, but I think it would've had more flavor with the addition of pork sausage with sage that I considered adding. I will try it next time!

I made this recipe using the regular ingredients listed AND I made a gluten-free version (using gluten-free breadcrumbs)as well.  Both were equally delicious.  I've never used Swanson® Chicken Broth in my stuffing before, but I can say that I definitely use it again.  It made easy, delicious stuffing.

Never having made stuffing before, I went with the basic recipe with just celery, broth, and onions.  I wish I had jazzed it up with sausage and mushroom flavors.  It was so boring and dull.  I did enjoy the wheat bread, though, making it superior to the other stuffing brands, IMO.

This was quick and easy and was good for a mini-Thanksgiving dinner I had a week before the actual holiday.  I used corn bread stuffing mix from a package because we don't care for the plain bread cube type.  I didn't add celery.  It was well received but not the homemade dressing that we are used to.

Quick and simple. Wasn't a huge change for me from normal boxed stuffing (I followed everything as stated except I excluded the celery, none of us like it.)

To me, this is ok if your in a hurry.  I think I prefer my stuffing baked.  To me, while flavorful, this was too moist and mushy.  I'll stick to my own stuffing recipe - will keep using the swanson broth, but not like this.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the stuffing cubes either - I think it was all in the execution and way the recipe is made and the fact I prefer my stuffing baked.

I thought this was a good base for stuffing.  It was good for a very basic recipe, but, it needed more flavor for us.  I thought it would be better with some apple or sausage added to it.

We all definitely enjoyed this stuffing. I used more celery and onion than called for, and sauteed those in a couple tablespoons of butter before adding the broth & boiling. This certainly won't replace our family's holiday stuffing/dressing, but for a week-night dinner, it's a keeper.

This is a tasty dish. I left out the celery as my daughter hates it. Was the first time not using stove top. Would definitely make this again. I read some of the reviews that added different spices such as sage to it. We ate it just as it was and it was good.

This was an easy, BASIC recipe, and it was ok, but I thought it could use more spice/flavor. I did end up adding some parsley and poultry seasoning. Also, I cooked some carrots in with the celery and onions b/c I had some that needed used up. I would probably saute the veggies in some butter next time before boiling w/ the broth. Like I said, this was ok and basic, so w/ my modifications I may make this again in a pinch, though, of course, it will never be as good as our usual homemade recipe. Thanks for sharing. :)

My family loves this stuffing. I have been making it for years. I cook the neck and livers and add the meat to those in the stuffing. I also add an egg or two depending how much I am making. I am a traditionalist when it comes to holidays. My kids cant wait for the stuffing every year.

This stuffing was not as good as my family and I expected. It seemed to be somewhat tasteless. Anyway, I am glad I tried something different, but I think I will stick to my 'old' ways in making stuffing.
