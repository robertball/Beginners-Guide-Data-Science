I served this at my super bowl feast and my guest where just putting it on their plates and eating it with a fork. Tasty dish no matter how you eat it. I liked the addition of the blue cheese very much.

This was a big hit at a party. The only thing I did different was add 3/4 cup of  finely minced onion.

I did make this without blue cheese and used rotisserie chicken instead.

Party favorite! Everyone always loves when I bring this dish. I boil the chicken (easier to shred that way with two forks) while the rest is heated up in the oven, add the chicken when the cheese/hot sauce mixture is almost done heating them throw it back in with some shredded cheese on the top.

So delicious!!!  If you don't have time, rotisserie chicken breasts are good to use to.
