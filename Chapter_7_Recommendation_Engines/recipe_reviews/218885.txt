One of the best frozen "pops" I've ever made. No, really. We could not stop eating them last night. Granted, it was 92 degrees yesterday but still......awesome recipe! I made no changes or substitutions. Next time, I might increase the berries but that's really just a personal preference. I think this would be awesome with strawberries or even blackberries, when the season starts. NOTE: I do not have popsicle molds because they never seem to work for me. What I do have are dixie cups and popsicle sticks. I just poured the mixture into the dixie cups that I'd set on a small plate, leaving 1/4 inch of room on the top and set them in the freezer. When they firmed up, I just stuck the popsicle sticks in each pop. This way is great because you could just peel away the cup and not have to worry about if the popsicles will come out of the mold. Which is always MY problem.

These are very yummy! I added a little bit of splenda, but honestly sugar and/or sweetener is not needed! The fruit by itself is enough.

Delicious! Made as is, and it was a big hit with a houseful of 14 yr old boys. MURPHSANDY: You should be able to substitute Granulated Splenda cup for cup, or Splenda Sugar Blend, 1/2 c = 1 c sugar. Hope this helps!

Tastes just like watermelon which is good and bad. Some spots can seem a little bland which is why I gave it 4 stars. Also I used frozen raspberries and blended with a food processor instead of a blender. They turned out just fine.

This yummy frozen treat will satisfy any sweet craving, and is really cooling on a hot summers day! The only thing I would change is to put a little less sugar, since it was very sugary. If you love sugary food, you'll love this!

I used frozen raspberries instead of fresh and it blended up nicely.  I put it through a strainer to remove the raspberry seeds.   Worked really well!  Only a couple of seeds slipped by!  Very tasty!  The whole family loved them.

I had half a watermelon and didn't know what to do with it.  This was a perfect recipe, and a refreshing treat!  I didn't have fresh raspberries on hand and used frozen instead.

The popsicles were delicious and my whole family loved them. The only thing negative is that there was way too much sugar. Watermelon already has natural sugar so the white sugar wasn't needed. Overall, they were very delicious and i will make them again.

So fresh and refreshing. We used strawberries instead of raspberries since more available(and cheaper)- really can't go wrong. Perfect summer treat.
