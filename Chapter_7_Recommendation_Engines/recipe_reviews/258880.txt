Ah-Mazing! I just needed to get rid of some Brussell Sprouts, I had no idea it would result in me stumbling upon this life altering recipe!  So so good. The butter rounds out the buffalo flavor and makes it so rich. I didn't plan on eating them all myself - but I did!!!

Very Good!  Will definitely make this again!  I made it as instructed. I had 2 lbs of Brussels sprouts so I doubled everything. I did roast the sprouts for 25 minutes, 5 minutes more than instructed as I like them more done and browned. Very easy and delicious if you like buffalo sauce.

I really like this recipe as did my neighbors! We have created this unspoken feed each other back and forth behavior. Having just eaten at my neighbors where they served brussel sprouts I was inspired to find a recipe to express my thanks. I found it here. Thank you.

Didn’t make any changes. I wish I would have added more hot sauce and less butter. Not spicy enough for me.

Absolutely delicious! I didn’t change a thing. I wasn’t sure if I would like this but wow—it was awesome. My whole family enjoyed it. This will be a staple in our house since my husband lives Brussels sprouts. Super easy to make.

Made these today. SO GOOD! I had 2 pounds of Brussels to use so I needed to double the hot sauce. I ran out of Franks so I used Sambal Oelek. It was delicious!! Glad I found this recipe. Thanks for the great idea!

This was easy to make and a very contrast rich dish.
To fit my low-carb high protein diet I used 200g of sprouts, 200g of chicken fillet cubes and 70 g of pasta.
Since my sprouts were frozen I precooked, halfed, tossed them in Texas Pete's and shredded black pepper before frying them. Added the chicken cubes and continued to fry in a big skillet with 5g of coconut oil and put a lid on after 5 minutes. In the end I put in the pasta and added salt to taste.
Maybe I could have used more Texas Pete's because of the added volume. Will do next time.

Very good dish.  You need to keep an eye on the sprouts when in the oven to pull them out at the right time.  This will be one of our Super Bowl treats this year.

This is a delicious side, snack, or main dish. I do not recommend using frozen brussels sprouts, but it still turns out.
