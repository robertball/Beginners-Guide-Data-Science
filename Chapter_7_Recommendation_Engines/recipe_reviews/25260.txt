Excellent! After reading reviews made these changes: melted 6 tbsp of margarine, added 6 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, Onion soup mix, and garlic powder. Then sprinkled the chops w/ pepper & marinated in the liquid for an hr, turning over once. I marinated the chops in the baking pan, so all I had to do was throw in some chunks of potatoes & carrots, mixing it around to make sure they were coated w/ the liquid. I only cooked 2 chops to have enough sauce for flavoring the veggies and also used bone-in chops. I baked for about 30-45 min, covered in foil, and uncovered for the last 10 min to brown under the broiler, turning over once halfway. My chops were EXCELLENT! Great flavor (not too sweat or salty), juicy, & nicely browned. The sauce was the best, and my boyfriend said they were better than his mom's (she's a great cook). Sauce made it great, it was a little thin, but great over white rice. Excellent recipe! Might try Beefy onion soup next time! Thanks Jodi!

These chops have great potential! I followed the recipe exactly but after the time allotted, the chops didn't appear to look done, so I cooked them for an additional 20 minutes...with no improvement.  Finally, I took them out, cut into one and found that they were indeed cooked through. They just didn't brown or glaze like normal looking chops. Therefore, the chops were not only a small eyesore, but they were dried out (due to my overcooking). Next time, when it comes time to uncover the chops, I flip them over and cook for the last 15 min so that they look brown and have that brown sugar glaze all over.

Even my picky 4 yr old loved it!  We marinaded the chops in a mixture of the butter (melted), brown sugar and soy sauce, for 3 hrs prior to cooking.  Then we took the chops out of that and put them on the baking dishes, and put half the recipe amount on top of each one.  EXCELLENT!

So I read the reviews and followed the advice of some.  I used thin chops, and I seasoned them front and back with salt and pepper.  I brought the sauce ingrediants to a boil in a small saucepan first but I added about 1 tbls. of honey to the mixture.  I poured most of it over the chops, baked it at 300 covered for 20 min. and then poured the rem. mixture over the chops and then baked it for an additional 10 min, and took the cover off for the last 10.  
No complaints at my house, my husband is a picky eater and thought these were great and NOT dry.  I recommend cooking at a lower temperature, it should make it tender.  If you want to get them super tender, try the temp at 250 for possibly a longer time.  Great and simple recipe.

We only had a short amount of time, so I did this dish on the stovetop by cooking the pork chops first, then simmering it in the brown sugar, butter, and worchestershire sauce for about 10 mins .  It came out great!

This turned out really well for me with a few suggestions from other reviewers.  I just made two porkchops, and marinaded them in butter, brown sugar and soy sauce (a little more than called for b/c my hand slipped while pouring:)) for an hour before hand.  I lined the baking pan with foil and am very glad I did come clean up time.  When it was time to put it in the oven, I sprinkled just a little pepper and nutmeg and put about a half tsp of butter and brown sugar on each chop and resprinkled with soy sauce.  I baked for about 25-30 minutes and took the foil off for the last 10 minutes, broiling for 5 minutes on each side.  Came out delicious!  Tender and just a hint of sweet.  Thanks Jodi!

Not bad at all, but I didn't have time to read all the reviews first though.  If I had, I would have marinated the chops for a while as a lot of people recommended.  I baked mine in a foil-lined baking dish, so cleanup was easy.  I ended up with a fair amount of liquid in the dish (some of it fat, of course) but I didn't really see it as 'sauce' like people have described, so we didn't use it.

This was very good.  Next time I'll use thicker chops, got a little dry.  Also marinated in brown sugar, margarine, and soy sauce for about an hour.  Added onion to the baking dish.  The baking in sugar and margarine carmelized the onions making the dish all the better!

These were very favorful! I think you get the best results by using the porkchops w/the bone. I melted the butter and then added the brown sugar to it to make a paste. I spread it over the chops and let them sit about an hour (flipped them once). I love the soysauce. These chops are sweet and tender! Everyone loved them, even my picky 13 yearold son.

Found it to be VERY BLAND. Sauce very watery. Advise everyone to maybe melt brown sugar,soya sauce and butter together before hand and let chops marinade overnite to absorb more flavor. Also, brown chops before baking.

I MIXED THE SOY SAUCE, BUTTER, AND BROWN SUGAR TOGETHER AND LET THE CHOPS MARINADE IN IT FOR 20 MIN. THEN PUT IN BAKING PAN AND PUT THE TBSP OF BROWN SUGAR ON EACH CHOP AND THEN BUTTER ON EACH CHOP AND SPRINKLED SOY ALSO OVER IT. CAME OUT DELICIOUS. BEST CHOP RECIPE I'VE TASTED SO FAR.

These were pretty yummy.  I used butter instead of margarine... (not a whole Tablespoon, just a pat on each). I also just sprinkled soy sauce on top of each chop.  I used 6 fairly thinsliced boneless chops.  I cooked them covered in a glass dish for 15 minutes. When I took them out to remove the foil, I pushed the chops to one side and whisked in a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I flipped the chops and cooked another 12 minutes.  Chops were moist and cook through. 

Thank you for the recipe.

These are good! I tweaked the recipe a little - cut down on the butter and added some pineapple juice and more brown sugar to make the sauce more "glazey". Also added black pepper and red pepper flakes - we like it spicy! My husband called tonight from work at the fire station - had me walk him through it so he could make a larger batch for his crew... Thanks for the recipe(and the helpful hints)!

This turned out perfectly for me.  My husband thought it was delicious!  I took some earlier written advice and added some worchestire sauce before baking.  I also sprinkled more soy sauce and brown sugar, and broiled it at the end to give it a little glaze.  My chops were only about 3/4 inch thick, so I baked with foil for 1/2 hour and broiled uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes.

I changed this recipe a bit by marinating the chops in soy sauce,worchestire sauce and garlic for about an hour before baking.  I then poured this marinade over the top of the chops with the brown sugar and butter.  Fabulous!!! My family loves these pork chops, thanks for a great recipe.

I read several reviews before I prepared this dish and they were very helpful.  I melted the butter and mixed the brown sugar and soy sauce together to make a marinade and did this for about an hour and half.  Then I placed foil in my baking dish for less mess, made another mixture of the ingredients and poured it on top of the chops.  I also poured the marinade all around the chops in the bottom of the dish.  I then covered it and baked for 25 min at 350, I then uncovered it, set the broil to 500 and continued baking for 10 min.  They turned out excellent!  Moist and a delicious flavor.  Cooking time is crucial, don't over cook, my chops were about 1/2" to 3/4" thick.

This recipe was phenomenal.  I used a corningware dish and it was perfect and easy to clean.  I sprinkled some of the brown sugar on the dish, then placed the chops in it, then sprinkled the rest of the brown sugar all over the top of the chops, and added the pats of butter.  The resultant sauce was very thin, but there was so much flavor it didn't matter.  My husband was extremely disappointed that I didn't make more.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. I always make it with rice. For maximum flavor, I increase the amount of sauce, take the pork out of the pan after it is cooked, put the rice in the bottom to soak up some sauce and put the pork back on top. This is nice for presenation and flavor. It is also a good idea to brown the pork chops on each side before cooking in the oven to avoid the bland white color.

This recipe was ok. The sauce was very thin & the pork chops looked grey, not very appealing to the eye. I won't make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I changed the recipe slightly though and melted butter and brown sugar to make a glaze as well as putting the brown sugar and butter on top of the chops.  This was a big valentine's day hit!  You also do not need to put foil over the dish.  I have cooked them twice now, once with foil, and once without foil and I think the chops were more flavorful without the foil. (they also cook faster).

I have had this recipe in my recipe box since 2004.  I have looked at it more times than I can count - wondering how so many people rated such a simple, boring recipe 4 stars.  Usually, I like to cook meals that are a bit more elaborate than 4 ingredients - but I just couldn't pull it off tonight.  So with pork chops out for dinner, I decided to make this dish....and the result was FABULOUS!!  Although I did change things a bit (I seem to be unable to follow a recipe); first, I followed the advice of another reviewer and liberally salt and peppered the (bone-in) chops.  I put them in a baking dish and combined my sauce ingredients in a small saucepan.  As it was only DH and I eating, I only used 2 chops, but used 1/4 cup of all ingredients, plus 3 cloves (about 1 Tbsp chopped) of garlic, and 1 Tbsp of honey.  I boiled the sauce until it reduced by about a third and then I poured about half of it over the chops.  Covered the dish and baked at 300F for 30 minutes.  Then I removed the lid, dumped on the rest of the sauce and baked for another 20 minutes without the lid.  The end result was a very moist, juicy, tasty chop.  I will make this dish again when I'm looking for a no-brainer...but next time, once the chops are done cooking, I will cover them with foil and add the sauce back to the saucepan and reduce further (and skip the first reduction).  Excellent recipe - thanks so much!

FANTASTIC!  My mom is gluten intolerant, so this recipe worked marvelously.  We used gluten free soy sauce, but it tasted the same as when we used it with regular soy sauce.  It was incredibly easy to make, and the meat was tender and juicy and not a chore to cut up.  It was flavorful all the way through as well.

We used a little extra brown sugar and soy sauce, and we cut a slice of onion and put it under the pork chop.  It turned out magnificent - this will be the recipe we use the most when it comes to pork chops!

These are a now a staple at our house.  I love how simple and easy this recipe is and yet it has great flavor.  After reading other reviews, I made a few changes.  I put slices of onion under the chops and I use more soy sauce than is called for.  I love pairing these with rice and using the sauce on top.  My kids love these chops!

This is the 2nd time I have prepared this meal with great results. I browned the pork chops first. I doubled the liquid ingredients and put everything in a roasting pan and added sweet potato, carrots and onions. Baked everything for 1 1/2 hours and made some rice to go with it.

This was a good little recipe, though the chops were a bit dry. I used 3/4" boneless chops and the stated cook time was just too much. Next time I'll reduce the total time to around 35 minutes. I also topped this with caramelized onions and it was very good.

WOW! At first I thought to myself, what's the big deal? Only butter and brown sugar with a bit of soy sauce? These chops were wonderful!! The butter and soy penetrates the meat while the brown sugar carmalized on top. I used boneless chops, so I only cooked for about 15 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncovered. PERFECT!

Delicious and easy....goes great with rice! I doubled up on the soy and the brown sugar to make a bit more glaze and covered with foil to trap steam and make more tender.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe to prepare.  I dislike pork, however, I LOVED this dish.  I used very thick porkchops, so perhaps that is the reason that mine were not bland, however, the cooking time needed to be increased SIGNIFICANTLY.  next time I am trying with onions.  Also, my chops never really "browned" the way I'd have hoped, others said theirs glazed or were too dark--did not have that problem, either.  Chops were gorgeous, flavorful and still moist.  Made with Garlic Corn on the Cob (recipe from same site) and french bread.  Drain the drippings left in pan, drain off some of the fat, mix (or add flour if desired) and add to tops of chops.  FANTASTIC!  FAMILY RAVED! Thanks for a keeper! *-V.

This was super easy and pretty good! I marinated boneless chops for about an hour. I seasoned the meat with cajun seasoning before adding other ingredients. We used the sauce for dipping. Thanks Jodi for a easy meal!

I used thick chops, braised them on both sides for a brown finish before  I went to the recipe. Then- baking at a lower temp for a bit longer tenderized them, and the braising made them look almost like I grilled them. They were great, and sprinking a pinch of brown suger on them while still hot from the oven gave them a carmalized flavor.

Mine looked nothing like the submitted picture.  Just what IS that stuff on top of her pork chops???  Once the brown sugar and margarine melts, it just gets absorbed.  Mine were a bit dry too, even though I used more brown sugar and more margarine than recipes asks for.  I would recommend this, but decrease the cooking time, unless your pork chops are whoppers.  My whole family did enjoy them.

Loved this recipe.  I seasoned chops first with garlic salt, pepper, and paprika.  Then, I made the glaze in a saucepan, basted chops, and baked.  Wonderful!

This recipe did nothing for us. I used beautiful Iowa Chops, cooked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for about 30 minutes and even basted very often. They were dry even with the basting. I just didn't think there was any "wow" in the flavor. Maybe it's not even so much the recipe, I think I'll just stay away from baked chops period. (Want a GREAT pork recipe, try Pork Chops with Raspberry Sauce. Fast and delicious and talk about WOW !! )

These chops were delicious!  Tender, juicy, and very flavorful. I sprinkled the chops with garlic salt and pepper, and used tamari soy sauce.  I covered them with foil, baked for 45 minutes, then uncovered and broiled for 3-4 minutes to reduce the sauce to more of a glaze.

Excellent - delicious and moist!  I broiled the chops for the last few minutes to really brown them and give them a nice glaze.  Watch your cooking time depending on your thickness of the chops - Overall - delicious and different

I thought this was really good.  I didn't have any soy, so I used a little hot sauce and some balsamic vinegar with the butter an brown sugar.  I also added some garlic.  I mixed the butter, brown sugar, hot sauce and balsamic vinegar together and marinaded the pork for about an hour, then cooked.  It came out really tender and not too sweet at all.

I made this recipe from 2" boneless chops (purchased at a food warehouse).  I never use margarine, so I followed the recipe using butter instead. (I cooked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15...I grew up on dry pork!) The chops were moist and the sauce was delicious, but thin.  I would definitely makes these again, but I would remove the sauce and thicken with cornstarch upon serving.  My very picky kids and husband loved these.

I would have given these a three star rating, but my husband really liked them.  In fact gave them the ultimate compliment of no Heinz-57 sauce.  I may have done something wrong, but ended up with a big soupy mess in which my chops boiled.  Not tasty.  I also found the flavor a little too sweet, but I think that is a taste thing.  I may try cutting the amount of butter back and seeing if it works better if I make these again.

These were awesome!! The only thing I did differently was I used butter, not margarine and after the 45 minutes, I turned them over before taking the foil off.  45 mins. may be a little too long depending upon how thin the chops are.  Keep a close eye on them.  Thanks, Jodi!  These were easy and delicious!!

For this recipe, size does matter.  The pork chops that were used in the recipe must have been pretty thick as mine were overcooked (kind of bland too).  If I make this recipe again I will do the modifications that were suggested and cook it for less time.

I also marinated the chops in the soy, butter, and sugar for 3 hours prior. I did not brown the pork chops first, however, I am going to try that next time. I recommend:)

This was perfect for when I didn't have a clue what to make for dinner. I always have these ingredients on hand so it will be a go to when I'm out of ideas. I didn't think it had very much flavor though, so I would probably read through reviews and add things to it next time.

I made these chops in the crock pot and they are amazing!  I used the same ingredients but added some extra brown sugar, butter, and added 1/2 large onion and 1 cup of water.  Phenomenal!!

Took some pointer from the other reviewers...add a worchestshire, garlic, onion.  Found it a bit bland for my taste still.  
But bland is better than bad....

I usually make this with pork steak instead of pork chops. after it cooks and the juices run off toward the end, I pour off the liquid and mix in flour to thicken up then pour back on for the remainder of the cooking time. I like to eat it with oven fries and corn.

Made this tonight for dinner.  So easy.  I only cooked the pork for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I flipped the pork after 15 to make sure it didn't get dry.  To make it even easier I cooked them in the toaster oven.  And the house didn't get so hot on this hot humid day. :)  Hubby loved it!

Although this was a simple recipe and the pork chops were very moist, there was no flavor.  Even with adding some garlic and onion powder, we felt it was missing something.

I have been making this for the last 5 years!  I absolutly love it!  I always add potatoes and apples in with the pork chops and I have found that the bone-in chops remain much more moist.  I use butter instead of margarine and I add quite a bit more for the apples and potatoes.  This is one of the easiest recipes ever!   I wish  everyone to enjoy it as much as my husband and I have.

these chops are delicious!  i added some honey a worcestershire sauce for more flavor and some cayenne pepper for a little spice...it was great.  i cooked it at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes with foil over the pan and another 10 without the foil...very tender and a hit!

Wow, these chops were great. Tonight was a busy evening with people eating dinner at various hours. I put these together quickly and threw them in the oven. With all the busyness, I even forgot to put the foil on until probably 45 mins into the cooking! They got flipped and slightly basted a couple of times, and turned out fantastic. My kids loved them, my husband loved them, and even my ultra-picky food allergy ridden in-laws gobbled them up! Will make again and again! Thanks for the great recipe, Jodi.

I used the marinade suggested in reviews with onion soup and also put an onion in the pan. My husband didn't like so much onion, but I thought this was excellent.

OMG. I've been making these for years!
When I first read the recipe, I was skeptical that it would be any good,(I was a picky cook back then and not too big on soy sauce....dumb!)but let me tell you, it's a no fail recipe. Everyone loves it. It also works with chicken. Very simple and tasty.

Since discovering this recipe a few years a go, it has become a staple in our family.  We turn to it everytime we don't know what to make.  So easy and the ingredients are always on hand.  I do add a couple of sliced onions - delicious served with basmati rice and steamed veggies! Thank so much.  Wish I had more easy, last minute ideas like this one.

Great recipe.  I took, the advice of a couple of others and added soy sauce as well.  Plus I dashed some orange juice into the mix.  The sauce was fantastic over rice!!!

The chops weren't dry at all.

Coming from a person that does not like pork chops these are worth the make, I did change it up a bit. I melted the butter, and added some fresh garlic to it before adding the brown sugar and onion soup mix. I stuck it all in a bowl and let it sit on the chops for about an hour and then baked it at about 325 for 45 min or so. Very good.

Nice and moist and o.k., but next time I will use the other reviewer's suggestions and marinate before and use more sugar to get the glaze. I did add more seasonings, onion/garlic powder and season salt and would recommend this to anyone who tries this recipe. But all in all this was pretty good.

I was afraid the pork chops would be dry and considered adding a can of pineapple.  However, I decided to go with the recipe as written and it came out wonderful!  The pork chops were very tender and moist and I could cut them with my fork.  The whole family loved them.  Even my picky 5 yr old grand-daughter cleaned it up.

Great recipe! I made only a few minor changes... I rubbed the brown sugar on the chops before adding them to the baking dish. Then melted the butter, added soy sauce and garlic powder and poured the mixture over the chops. The chops were delicious... flavorful and moist. The sauce was a bit thin, but was great poured over long grain & wild rice (Uncle Ben's). Will definitely make again.

This is a really good recipe, my variation on it is to marinate the chops, sear them in a hot skillet and some butter and olive oil then bake them.  I used boneless chops so it didnt take as long either.

I was looking for a new, easy recipe for pork chops and came across this one. I wasnt sure how it would taste but I really liked it!  I used thin cut chops and cut the cooking time to 25  minutes and then another 10-15 uncovered. After the inital 25 minutes I dished some of the glaze over the chops to remoisten them and sprinkled them with pepper and paprika.  I liked the taste of these a lot and served them with Asian style noodles. mmmm!

I liked them, my husband liked them even more. My chops were only 1/2 inch thick so I baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 10. I also marinated them for 3 hours first in melted butter, brown sugar and extra soy sauce. I flipped them and then sprinkled additional brown sugar during the 10 minutes uncovered time. Pretty simple. Will make again.

I altered this recipe by adding sliced onions and using worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  I melted the butter & made more of a glaze.  I poured it over the chops & baked them for about 30 minutes, glazed them again & broiled them to give them color and they stayed SO moist and were delicious!

These pork chops are very good; I've made them twice already!  The second time, I used a bit more soy sauce and brown sugar to create more sauce, since it is very good.  I also decrease the baking time when using thinner pork chops.  They come out tender and full of flavor.  This has become one of my staple recipes!

I tried these last night and they were not the best.  The chops were bland and needed more seasoning.  I couldn't taste the "glaze", however, I will try the recipe again.  BUT I will definately season the chops first and add save the brown sugar and butter for the last 15 minutes creating more of a glaze like I do with ham.

Have no idea what went wrong. Appearance was horrible. Color was gray, appeared to be swimming in fat and butter. Taste was alright, but nothing I will ever want again. Could have been me, don't know.

It was great. I didn't use the soy sauce, and before I put anything on the chops I took a knife and lightly cut down the chop to help the flavor get into the chops.  I used 1/4 inch chops and my time was 25 min covered, 10 min uncovered, and they were great. Even my picky eater husband loved them. Thanx.

I, too, made these on stovetop - used 1" thick chops, browned about 4-5 minutes on each side and then simmered in sauce for a few minutes (be sure to adjust your cooking time accoring to the thickness of your chops! I think that could have been the problem with some of the lesser reviews of this recipe) Served with the Twice Baked sweet potato recipe on this site. Delicious!

I thought this was great, I don't eat pork and I really enjoyed this. I have made it many time for the family and they have all loved these chops.  Thanks Jodi =)

Thought this was pretty good-next time I think I will use pork chops with the bone in, and maybe brown them before hand for better color. I added some apple slices and my daughter and husband loved the flavor.

I found these chops to be rather bland, but my hubby and 5 kids liked them. Might try again with adding some more spice like garlic, white pepper and some seasoning salt. Thank you Jody.

This was a great, simple, fast recipe.  I'm not a big fan of adding so much margarine so I just spritzed each chop with a couple of sprays of the calorie free "Smart Balance" spray.  The chops were tender and had a nice flavor.

As is, this recipe is a 4-star, but with the suggestions of others, it was a 5. I, too, melted the butter (not margarine) in a small sauce pan and added the sugar and soy sauce; I also added garlic powder and a little honey, then poured the sauce over the chops (used boneless, about 3/4" thick) and let it sit in the fridge for about 45 minutes before baking. I think the baking time for this recipe is WAY too long, unless you're using 1-1/2" or thicker chops. I baked for 35 minutes then broiled each side for 5 minutes. These were very tender & tasty and, yes, indeed, the kids ate these up without complaint, which is unusual when serving pork chops (I usually have to cut them up and "hide" them in a stir-fry or soup!) I will definitely make these again with the alterations.

Great recipe!  I changed it up a few ways after reading reviews.  First, I dipped the chops in the mixture instead of just pouring the mixture on top.  I would have marinated them for a little while if I had the time.  Then I poured some more mixture on top.  I also broiled for a few minutes at the end, which gave it a carmelized flavor (and lots of color).  I paired it with some asian veggies!  Yum yum yum!

This is a really fast & easy recipe to play with!   Just reading all the reviews gave me tons of ideas.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on my chops.  Then I made a paste of margarine, soy sauce, brown sugar and minced GINGER.  I followed the directions to the end, where I broiled uncovered for about 6 mins just to get a nice crispy glaze on my beautiful chops!

I am not a big pork chop fan, but this recipe sounded so good I thought I'd try it. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to serve it over rice and also let it marinate in the juice for a few hours prior to cooking. I also broiled it for about 5 minutes each side after baking it for 30 minutes. It was not dried out, and a good texture. My husband enjoyed it, but didn't rave over it. I will probably make it again, but will thicken up the sauce a little next time.

Very good!  Changed it up a bit -- didn't have soy sauce, so I used a little worcestshire sauce, white wine vinegar, and sweet & sour sauce.  I served it over a long grain rice / vegetable medley mix.  The sauce was a little runny, but still delish!!!

I really enjoyed this receipe. I read some members reviews before making this receipe and I made the following changes. When it came time to uncover the chops, I turned them over and made sure there was some of the sauce on top of that side as well. The chops were golden brown and delicious. I put in 2 tbsp of soy sauce instead and they turned out wonderful. My boyfriend loved them. Great receipe!

I definitely really like this recipe.  I was a little skeptical because I'm not a big fan of sweet meat, and niether is my husband.  Once I had a bite of the chop, it was delicious.  They weren't too sweet or too anything for that matter.  It was just a perfect taste.  The only thing that I did different was put a little black pepper and Accent on the meat before I added the brown sugar, MARGARINE, and soy sauce.  The only thing I would recommend to anyone is to not be decieved at the 45 minute mark by thinking the chops aren't done.  Go ahead and follow the time line recipe calls for.  This recipe is definitely for a person that doesn't have all day to cook!!!  Very tasty and easy.

I made this for the first time the other night, served it alongside a rice side dish and seasoned green beans. We thought they were really good, my husband guessed there was honey at first, and once I told him it was brown sugar, he as pleasantly surprised. Nothing I would have changed about this recipe. Let the pork sit for a few minutes after pulling out of the oven and the sauce will thicken. Great to serve with rice so you can soak up this wonderful, sweet sauce!

Ok, I admit up front that I made this recipe with chicken breasts rather than the chops - we're not big pork chop fans.  It was quite good this way - it's very important not to overcook the meat so that it remains juicy - use a thermometer to keep track.  Very simple, I served with crusty rolls, would be good with rice as well.

Great pork chops!  I melted the butter, then I poured it over the pork chops, then sprinkled brown sugar on top of the pork chops.  I just realized that I forgot to add the soy sauce.  I didn't even realize it.  The pork chops turned out really moist and declious.  I get tired of the same old ketchup or barbecue sauces over pork chops, so this was a nice change.  My husband loved the pork chops also.  I will be keeping this recipe for future pork chop dinners.  Thank you!

Loved the flavor of the glaze! I sprinkled a little salt/pepper/garlic powder on the chops before adding the sugar and butter for some extra flavor.  Only complaint is the glaze is very runny and doesn't really adhere to the chop, you just have to spoon it over the  top afterwards.  But, will probably be making this again.  Thanks!

This was a really great recipe.  I used very thick pork chops without a bone.  The 1 hour cook time was just right. The chops were nice and juicy.  I would cut back on the cook time if your chops are thin.    Due to time restraints at dinnertime I put the chops, sugar, margarine and soya sauce together a couple of hours early and left it in the fridge until time to cook.

I used another reviewer's sugeestion and combined all glaze ingredients together and brought to a boil. I also added minced garlic. It was good but still could have used some more flavor.

I thought that it lacked the sweet flavor that I anticipated that it would have. However, it is also very likely that the whole problem could have been because I had ALDI BRAND pork chops and they were very fatty. Maybe if I had gotten a higher end pork chop (lol) it could have turned out much better.

Overall, this is a good recipe - and you can't get much easier than this!  My only real complaint is that these came out too dry.  I'd suggest cooking them for 30 minutes covered, and then 10 minutes uncovered - as long as they are cooked through, they'll be fine.  I'd also recommend serving this over rice.  I didn't, and ended up regretting it.

Really easy and really nice. I cooked mine at 220*C for 20 min then 10 min without the foil just to speed things up a bit and it seemed to work well.

This wasn't that great.  I followed the recipe exactly and the "glaze" ended up being more of a butter soup.  When we took the pork out of the oven, it was just sitting in a pool of butter and brown sugar.  Also, the flavor wasn't that outstanding.  Will not make again - sorry.

This was pretty good! I was a bit nervous using the soy sauce. I thought it may make it a bit salty, but it didn't. I followed the recipe exactly, just cut down the time on the baking a followed anothers advise on broiling for a few minutes to add color.
Thanks for the recipe!

I had very high hopes for this recipe.  Unfortunately, the chops fell short...very short in my opinion.  The sauce was a pool of liquid in the bottom of the pan.  Not even close to a glaze.  The chops, though cooked covered for the majority of the cooking time, turned out tough and dry.  I was extremely disappointed.  Could have had a decent flavor if the sauce were to actually stay ON the chops.

These were really good, however, I did modify the recipe a little bit.  (ok, a lot!) First, I used boneless pork chops, so I knew the full cooking time would dry them out.  I also seasoned them with garlic powder, ginger, parsley,rosemary, cajun seasoning, and browned them on the stove top first.  Then, I put them in the oven with the brown sugar, butter, and soy sauce.  I only cooked them for another 15-20 minutes and it was perfect.  Actually, I really think you could do the whole dish on the stovetop just by using a covered skillet.

So simple and easy to make! The chops had a light sweet taste that made them irrestible. And so moist! Mine didn't take the full 45 minutes to cook because the chops were thinner. Will definitely make again!

I made it just like the recipe and it didn't turn out well at all. My kids wouldn't even eat it. The pork chops turned out dry and bland. It's almost as if the sauce needed to be thicker like BBQ sauce. It sounded like a great recipe...very simple. I wish it would've turned out.

This was really good.  My whole family liked it and I passed it on to about 10 people.  I think it tastes like beef jerky, terikey kind but its not tough or dry. My picky preschooler LOVES it!!

For a change of pace on your pork chops, this recipe was good. Boneless pork chops were used in my recipe and cooked for 20 min. I had my doubts when I first lifted the foil, because they looked like boiled pork chops. I continued cooking without foil for 10 min. expecting them to glaze, which they did not. We all liked the AUJUS sauce, but the pork chops did not absorb the flavor of the juices. I will try again with a few changes. As is, I rate it a "3", but has great potential to be a "5" with other reviewers suggestions.

I really didn't like this at all.  I think I would have prefered it if I didn't have to cover the chops so that they could have had a glaze and I agree--they were pretty blah!

Hello i found this recipe a year ago at this site. Since then we make it every couple of months. We love it, but we add rice to it. We put the minute rice uncooked in the bottom of the pan with hot water then put the chops on top and finish prepering as said.

Very very good. I think the pork chops I used were too thin, so they cooked in less time than the recipe called for. I really liked the flavor of this sauce, I used some of the extra mixed in with brown rice to serve with the chops.

The taste of these were good but they were chewy and a little dry.  I am not sure if the cooking time is too long but I followed the directions and did not alter a thing.  I will try to make again and cut the cooking time down and see what happens.

This was so good. I love sweets but wasn't sure how this would taste so I only made two pork chops so we could try it. Needless to say, I wish I had made more. Yummy!!

We really enjoy this recipe in our house.  I did as suggested and melted the butter and mixed all the ingredients to marinade before cooking.  The sauce is also really yummy on mashed potatoes!

These were pretty darn good.  Next time, I would add more brown sugar, butter, and soy sauce...only because my fiance and I were scrapping the bottom of the pan for more of the sauce these ingredients made.  I also added some minced garlic on top of the chops.  And be sure to line your pan with foil for easy clean-up!

This recipe was easy and tasty too!  The chops were moist and the juice was very flavorful.  At 45 minutes when I removed the foil cover, I also removed about 2/3 the juice and they brown beautifully.  The reserve juice was then poured over top of each chop.  My husband is very picky and was very impressed with them.  Great for a last minute dinner!!

Made these last night with boneless 3/4 inch chops and my family devoured them . . .even my picky two-year-old.  I cut the butter down by half and baked covered at 375 for 30 min then uncovered and broiled for 10-15 min.  Came out beautiful and delicious.  I served them with the cajun style sweet potatoes from this site.  Great combo since the potatoes are sweet & spicy!

These were excellent chops.  Unfortunately, my two picky eaters still wouldn't eat chops.  But the rest of us loved them.  They were a little dry, ( I may have left them in too long) but the flavor was great.  We drained the juice out of the pan into a bowl and sprinkled some on our rice - my husband and I thought that was really good. I will make this again for sure! Thank you.

It was a little dry, but to me - pork is a tougher/dryer meat.  I added honey as a glaze before serving.  Will make again, with less margarine - it is a very simple/fast/easy recepie!!

Very easy and delicious recipe! I increased the time of baking uncovered by about 15 min, flipped the chops on the other side and added a few minutes on broil to brown chops evenly. Came out very tender and not sweet at all. Will make again. Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  I made about 9 chops.  I did not have soy sauce, so I used Worchestersire instead.  I just layer the chops, moving them around periodically.

I sealed my pork chops in a little "tinfoil package" and placed them in a baking pan.  I did not bake them uncovered at all, and they STILL were a tad on the dry side.  Flavor wasn't bad, but did not penetrate the chops enough.  I think I will stick to a similar recipe which uses lemon juice instead of butter, which tenderizes the chops nicely... Thanks anyway.

My husband had been asking me to make pork chops since we got married.  I never eat pork, so I don't have a clue on how to make a pork dish.  I absolutely loved this recipe.  It is sooo quick and easy to prepare and he loved it.  I even ate it.  I will definetly make this again.  Thanks Jodi!!

Really awful.  I don't know why, but mine came out the same as others who rated this recipe low.  The sauce wasn't a sauce...it was extremely watery and the chops were ridiculously dry.  What a shame.  I don't think I'll try this one again.

This was really good.  My kids liked it (a minor miracle!) too!  I tossed in a few drops of Tabasco to give them a bit of a bite.  Not too much but just enough.

Not bad, but not alot to it.  It's good for picky eaters who like things sweet and not too complex.  Just make sure you serve it with a tasty side dish.  Oh, and its easy to make.

This recipe gave my boring baked pork chops great flavor!  I didn't have time to marinate so I used the extra sauce for dipping.  My husband thought it tasted great too!

This was fantastic! I did take other reviewers advice and marinate the meat in the mixture first, and it was just great! The meat was very tender and juicy. Even my 2 year old cleared her plate. Thank you!

The chops do not make a good presentation.  When cooked, they are plain, brown chops.  The flavor was not that good.  I will not make these again.  My son did not like them at all.

I used thin cut boneless pork chops and followed the advice of other reviewers and marinated it . It still needed something . So I threw a little barbecue sauce with it and baked it about 30 minutes.  But I forgot to take off the foil so it didn't brown.  Overall I think wasn't bad.  But next time I'll marinate longer and cook less.  I think it would have been better with thick cut so I will tweak it a bit and try again.  Love the brown sugar on it!!!!!!

I have been making these pork chops for 15 years!  I rarely change the recipe and they are always amazing!  I have been asked so many times to make these and share the recipe.  Creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans are my go to side items! This recipe is and has been a keeper!

I checked it out after 30 minutes and it was just a soup with no butter or sugar remaining on the meat.
I rescued it by pulling it out of the pan and put it on top of a roasting pan, reapplying the brown sugar turn the oven up to 400° and baking for an additional 15 minutes to crisp.

Absolutely loved this!  My son and I devoured it!  Only adjusted the recipe a bit, adding minced onion and worchestire to the mix and poured it over the chops to marinate for about 20 min.  Thank you for sharing!  This will be a favorite go-to meal!

This recipe was super easy, but the flavor was just so-so. Also, the chops were dry. If I make this again I will probably use the slow cooker.

Read the other reviews and followed what they said. I marinated them in a baking dish for 1 hour and them popped them in the oven. This is the second time I've made them at my family request.  Great recipe

this was good but I changed it a little.  I eliminated the margarine since the soy sauce and brown sugar gave it enough juice.  family thought it was very moist and they all enjoyed it.  husband thought it would have been even better if the chops marinated in the soy and brown sugar a few hours before cooking.

I cooked this for my daughter and I and we loved it, it was just sweet enough to make it good and the pork was very tender.  I followed some of the other comments and marinated for about 3 hours, I added some seasoning when I put the chops in the oven.  Overall very good, will make it again.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe, simply because it was a LOT sweeter than I expected. (I'm not sure why I didn't expect it, considering how much sugar they have you put in.)  I even added extra soy sauce and it was still reaally sweet... almost like eating syrup on pork chops.  Also, beware of the cooking time on this recipe.  I cooked for 20 minutes at 300, but it didn't seem even close to done so I threw it back in for 15 minutes at 325 and it was completely done.  I would recommend marinating the pork in the sauce, but I didn't have time so I pour the sauce over the pork and then let it sit while the oven preheated.  That in itself was enough for the pork to take in the flavor.  Bottom Line?  Not my favorite recipe. Easy to make, yes, but too sweet of a sauce to put on pork.

Let me tell you my family hates pork. I had pork left over cause we buy meat packages and pork comes with the package so I didn't want it to go to waste. I used your recipe and followed all the directions and they came out fantastic and my husband had 2 chops.

Very good. I made it exactly according to the instructions. However, my family felt it could use a little more flavoring. I think next time I'll melt extra butter and mix it with some more brown sugar to brush onto the other side of the pork chops at the end of cooking .

These were good- I even did as a previous reviewer said and marinated them first for about an hour and then did the recipe.  I cooked them exactly according to the recipe and felt they were overdone. My hubby said they were OK and asked for BBQ sauce because they didn't have a lot of flavor.  The kids ate them fine without complaining (which is always a challenge around here) and I thought they were OK too.  Not sure what I'd change and not sure if I'll make again!

I made these exactly as written except I used 1 1/2" boneless chops.  I have never had pork chops turn out so moist!  Next time I am going to take other reviewers' suggestion of mixing the ingredients and marinating the chops before baking.

The meat itself was a little plain tasting but the sauce was very good.  Next I will marinate as others stated and that should give the meat more flavor.

Yummmmmm.  I forgot about the soy sauce and used about half brown sugar/half honey, and probably a little extra butter.  Melted and mixed the sauce ingredients, let it cool a bit, then coated both sides of some pork steaks that had been seasoned with salt and pepper.  Let that sit for about 15 minutes or so, sprinkled with a little more ground pepper, then into the oven for about an hour.  Browned up nicely without a cover the last 15-20 minutes.  Tender, juicy, lightly sweet.  Oven roasted some chopped potatos with a little olive oil for a nice side.

This recipe was a success in my home! I read some of the suggestions for this recipe and what I did was melt the butter on a small pot and then add the brown sugar and soy sauce. Once everything was dissolved I poured the sauce over the pork chops which had been sprinkled with brown sugar. The chops were only partially defrosted and I only let them sit on the sauce for as long as it took to preheat the oven. I baked them at 350 F for 35 min.and flipped them halfway. Broiled for 3 min. Very Good!

I never have leftovers. It is fantastic. My family thinks it tastes like ham. I did marinate the chops first and line the pan with foil.

I used this recipe along with suggestions made by Mocolatte and it turned out very good. First I browned the pork chops in a cast iron skillet with a little bit of olive oil,red onion, green onion, rosemary, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and ginger. In a seperate bowl I mixed, 1 large can of cream of mushroom, (same can) 1 large can of milk, the same spices above plus thyme, 1 tbs of worcershire sauce, 6tbs of melted butter, 6 tbs of melted brown sugar, and 4 cloves of mashed garlic. After browning the prok chops I added the bowl mixture to the skillet and let that cook for about ten minutes. I then added celery to the mix for another five. I then put the pork chop gravy mixture in a glass dish and baked according to original recipe. The gravy was very good over mashed baby reds.

These were ok.  They were tender, but didn't have too much flavor.  I also had to thicken up what is referred to in the recipe as the sauce - it was like water.  Will not make again.

I melted all the ingredients then poured over the chops and baked. Great flavor but I wish the chops had more color to them. Maybe broil them next time??

UNBELIEVABLE! Very, very good! I am so tired of pork chops on the grill (dried out) or fried pork chops, etc. but found this and am making it again tonight! I put feta on top of each boneless chop at the end of cooking time and then broiled it until it "somewhat melted" and we ALL loved it!!

Nice change in flavor! Tasted delish! Would go great on ribs I think.  Got great compliments on such easy, simple ingredients.  I used butter instead and a dash of pepper. Mixed all ingredients and marinated the meat for an hour or so.  Came out juicy and tender on grill.  Pork chops do not take long too cook at all.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great, I loved it.  I took the advice of other reviews and added a bit of honey and cooked on the stove top, because I was in a hurry, and found that these turned out marvelously.  So much so, that there were none left for me!  My family inhaled them.  Guess I will double and make more next time!  Thanks for sharing!

Sorry! One hour in the oven is toooo long for pork chops.  They were  dry as a bone and I ended up tossing out half of them.  I should have trusted my instincts when I saw 1 hr. of cooking time for chops.  The sauce was ok, but nothing special.  Can't recommend this recipe.

This was ok. The chops do not look pretty coming out of the oven. When I removed the foil I had to add more brown sugar but they still did not come out glazed.

I followed a lot of the other suggestions -- preparing the glaze in a saucepan, adding Worcestershire sauce and onion soup mix, and turning the chops over for the last few minutes. I also added some white potatoes to the baking dish (had to microwave those for a few minutes in the end). The taste was terrific, but the meat was overcooked. I'll try this again, but I might do it in a saute pan and cook the chops for a much shorter time (and cook a separate side dish).

These are good but even better when you add onion, garlic and a bit of cayenne for some heat. This is also a good recipe for chicken!

I subtituted butter for margarine and it still tasted great. I think it should be uncovered before 45 minutes, as it had a lot of water when I uncovered it.

I followed the recipe exactly with wonderful results!  My husband loved them and wished I made more.  I served the chops on a bed of white rice and poured the leftover juices on top.  Yummy!

I am giving this a 3 star rating because I am not good a cooking pork chops and this recipe didn't turn out any better than any of my other attempts - tough and dry.  Te flavor of the sauce was good, but like another reviewer commented, it would be better if if was thicker.

I love this easy recipe! It was a hit in my house. Instead of the soy sauce, I used teriyaki sauce and increased it a little to use the juices to make gravy. I will make this dish again. I am trying it with chicken tonight!

As the recipe says "Delicious easy way to bake pork chops even the kids love."  This was the easiest recipe. Read the reviews and you will get plenty of ideas of what to have on the side.  My niece is picky and she ate every bite and then some more. Delicious, tender, juicy, tasty and very easy to make.... I love it.

I was looking for something simple and easy to do with my chops. This was a pretty good call. I accidentally added 6 tablespoons of soy sauce! Yikes! Slightly salty but definitely tasty. They were tender enough to cut with a fork too. I think next time I would add a pineapple ring to the top of each chop for an added touch.

Very good.  As others suggested, a boiled the brown sugar, soy sauce, and butter before adding to the pork chops and carrots.  Chops were very moist.  Will cook again.

this recipe was excellent.  Im not a big fan of pork chops, esp not the shake & bake way. . i made this and fell in love with it. Unfortunately my husband still put ketchup on it, as he does with everything.  Def will make again.

This makes an awesome glaze! I used the recipe but prepared it differently.  I added a little Worchestershire sauce and a dry onion soup packet.  You could definitely do without those and it would still be super yummy! I use about 1/2" boneless pork tenderloins and do them on the stove.  I sear both sides of the chops and then cook them with the sauce in a covered pan on med-low for just 15-20 minutes.  It turned out fabulous!

This is fantastic!  I followed some others suggestions and added 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, Onion with mushroom soup mix, garlic powder, and green onion. I also chopped a couple potatoes, carrots, and celery stalks.  I didn’t marinate the chops (2 butterfly cut chops) because we were short on time.  I just coated the chops in the sauce, placed them in the pan, then tossed the veggies in the sauce and poured veggies and sauce over the chops in the pan.  I baked for about 30 minutes covered in foil.  The chops were perfect and my fiancé claims the veggies were the best he’d ever had.  The potatoes stayed a little too crunchy for my taste, so next time I may cook them a little before adding them to the pan.

My family did not like this at all. I took the advice of other reviewers and melted the brown sugar with the butter. There was no carmelization, and the chops tasted very bland with a hint of sweetness. I just thought they'd taste better.

This recipe quickly became a new favorite in our house. I liked it since it was so easy. I do take the foil off about 45 minutes into baking. Then I broil each side for about 5 minutes each to give it a good browning/glaze. But we all like this recipe a lot!!

Unfortunatley I was not very pleased whith these chops... I melted my butter first then I put the brown sugar on and baked them according to the directions.... All of my sugar melted off the chops and they didn't have much flavor... I ended up putting BBQ sauce on them instead.

First 10 I have ever received when cooking for the hubby!  I did as another reviewer suggested and only used a few chops, and cut up potatoes and carrots that were cooked with the pork.  Served it all with the glaze drizzled over the top.

What am I doing wrong?  The glaze didn't stick to the chops...after the hour cooking time, they were bare and very dry.  Hmmmm...  I don't think I'll make these again.

These were very good.  Like others I melted butter and stirred in soy sauce and brown sugar. I then coated both sides with mixture and baked until done.  Very juicy and tasty. I love how quick they are!

This was EASY and very tasty.  My toddler ate every bite.  It wasn't like the picture...not crusty...but still delicious.  I did broil mine for about 5 minutes which helped brown it up.

I used someone else's suggestion by combining all the ingredients together in a pot and boiling before placing on the chops. It was super simple and very good.

This was very good considering it wasn't with fancy ingredients! I cooked these on the grill and they came out delicious. Coated them with soy sauce again after flipping them. Very moist! Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and while I liked the flavor I also thought they were a little dry.  I think next time I will use some of the other suggestions to moisten them.  Good starting recipe though, I never would have thought to use brown sugar on pork chops :)

Made the chops exactly following the recipe but the sauce was veyr runny and the chops did not look appetizing.  I put the chops into a skillet just to brown both sides and poured most of the sauce over the top of them in the skillet and they turned out great!  The sauce thickened right up and there was a nice glaze/crust on the chops.  With the slight modification at the end I'd give it 4 stars.

As is this recipe turned out very dry and the glaze was way too thin. To fix it up I melted the butter and added a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a tablespoon of finely chopped garlic to the other glaze ingredients. I then let the pork chops marinate in half of the glaze for 2 hours in the refrigerator. I then lightly browned the chops to give them a little bit of color and then baked them for about 35 minutes. While they baked I thickened up the other half of the glaze with some cornstarch and served it over the finished chops. They turned out sweet and slightly tangy and very juicy.

These pork chops were pretty good. I am only giving it 4 stars because it wasn't exceptionally great, didn't make us say 'wow' or anything. As other reviewers said, the sauce pooled in the pan. However, I used 8 thin chops instead of 6 thick chops, so they pretty well covered the bottom of the 9x13 pan. Since they covered the bottom though, it didn't really matter that the liquid ran off the meat, because the chops were still covered with it anyway. I imagine I will make these again, and I will probably try them again with thicker chops next time. Thank you for sharing!

I had high hopes for this recipe since just about everything I've made from this website has been awesome, but I didn't like these pork chops.  Sorry.  I'll look for another recipe on here.  P.S.  The cooking time seems to be way off; my kitchen smelled like burnt soy sauce after 25 minutes...  I even greased the pan.  GO PATRIOTS!

Really delicious. Marinated them in the sauce for a couple hours and baked them adding more ingredients. The were a little colorless so I did broil them for a couple minutes. The sauce was thin, but delicious. I loved them and will make them again.

The chops were very juicy and the sauce thickened very nicely over them while they baked. I did toss them in a sauce pan for a short time BEFORE baking to keep them from drying out. My husband and I enjoyed these very much!

This recipe sounded very good and easy...so I decided to give it a try.  For once, I followed the recipe exactly, without making any adjustments.  Both my husband and I thought it was bland and didn't care for it at all.  I probably won't be making this recipe again.

I wasn't that impressed with this one.  The chops turned out flavourless and grey, floating in a really unappealing looking liquid.  Taste-wise it wasn't horrible, but nothing special, either.

Delicious and simple. I baked this and sweet potatoes at the same time (I later mashed them with some of the pan 
drippings). My boyfriend loved them, and they were low maintenence enough for me to paint my nails while they baked.

I did not care for these at all. When I took them out of the oven, they were swimming in sauce. Another reviewer mentioned this same problem. They also came out extremely bland. Perhaps this would have been better with very large pork chops to absorb more of the butter and sugar. I will not make this again.

This was a great change!  I also cooked onions with mine, but followed the directions exact for everything else.  I sometimes feel as though my pork chops are boring, so this was a great way to chang it up!  Thank you!

After reading the reviews, I followed NOELLEBELLE's suggestions (12.02.04.) Also, I substituted vegetable oil for butter in the marinade and added crushed red pepper flakes and Chinese five spice instead of black pepper and Nutmeg. Per  JENNYPENNY1's review (01.23.05), I set the chops upon a "bed" of yellow onion slices, which carmelized nicely. My husband and I were very pleased with the result -- flavorful and moist. Thanks, Jodi!

What did I do wrong?  I achieved dry as a bone and no flavor results.  At the end of the 45 minutes I had a full pan of juices, they were swimming.  Figured they'd never brown like this and poured some off.  Browned them and served.  I very much wanted this to work, but won't be baking pork chops ever again from this experience.  They just boiled all the flavor out.

I was disappointed in the results.  Did as the recipe said, and when I oncovered, nothing but juice in bottom and chops didn't brown as expected. Very tough and very dry.  Will not do this again - sorry

This was great!!  I have never been able to find just the right recipe for pork chops that didn't come out dry, or tough that my husband and son would enjoy.  This did the trick! I've cooked it twice in the last month "by request, the 2nd time".  I did alter the cooking time based on the number of pc's that I cooked and basted a couple of times when the cover was off. Perfect both times. Easy and Yummy and Not Dry.  My boys loved it! Thanks!

This is definitely a keeper recipe. I didn't have soy sauce on hand. To improvise I used two bullion beef cubes dissolved in about 4 tablespoons of water and drizzled it on top not using it all. I used the boneless chops and since my friend was late wound up keeping them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes longer. They still turned out so tender and juicy. I also served with mashed potatoes and used the extra “gravy” for the potatoes.

This recipe turned out great for us! I dont always care for pork chops, but this added the flavor that made them great! Plus, my daughter has an egg allergy, so breading them is not always an option. Thanks!! : )

This was alright...easy, but the flavor didn't stay on the chops since the sauce was runny.  Not a bad recipe, just nothing exciting...sorry.

Love the flavors, and it is super easy and inexpesive, however...the chops do tend to get tough..any ideas? I even used thick cut boneless.

We liked this recipe.  I only baked the chops for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  They were nice and moist and had a sweet flavor.

This was great and even got a thumbs up from my husband, who only likes his pork chops breaded.  Tried the extra sauce on rice, which was great.  Definitely a keeper for us!

These were excellent!  Even the picky eaters liked these.  I followed the recipe to the T and I think the only reason mine did not dry out is because I used really thick chops.  I could see if you have a thinner cut they would be dried out.  My husband really liked them until I told him there was soy sauce....he HATES soy sauce.  But he even admitted they were good.

I can only give this three stars because I altered this quite a bit.  I browned the bone-in pork chops on med-high skillet with seasoned with salt and pepper and a little bit of cinnamon.  I turned the heat down and put a cover on and finished of under the broiler to carmelize.  This came out good.  Juicy with plenty of flavor.

This was exactly what I was looking for!! I was so tired of plain or breaded or bbq chops. These really were tender and a touch of sweet. It really brings out the natural flavor of the chop!! Wow! Excellent!

Excellent flavor. I added a few other ingredients that I thougt would be good. Some worcestershire sauce and since I didn't have soy sauce I used teriyaki sauce. Wonderful. My husband and kids loved it, were even dipping bread in the leftover sauce.

This recipe seemed like it would taste really good, but the meat came out really dry.  They may have need basting and/or less cooking time.  Also, I prefer pork chops with the bone in.  The meat tends to be more juicy.

I found the pork to be very bland tasting. We could not taste the brown sugar at all and just a hint of soy sauce.  I added more brown sugar after I took it out and that was better but it is nothing we will make again.

This recipe created a LOVELY, sugary glaze on the pork chops. I added a little (about a tsp. each) of curry, allspice, and nutmeg. The extra spices kicked it up a notch and gave it some flava. Not to hard to make and definitely tasty.

Easy dish to prepare but nothing great. I think I needed more brown sugar on each chop because there wasn't that much there by the time I pulled them out of the oven. Very dry though I followed the cooking directions exactly. No color to them. Doubt I will make again.

This was  ok, but not the greatest. I did it as per recipe, and at the end broiled it for 5 minutes  so it could brown . Not super tender, not too dry but the flavor was nothing remarkable. For me, it's not a keeper.

Very good and moist but pretty sweet.  I did remove the sauce and thickened in a sauce pan with corn starch and then poured over the top of the chops when served.  My chops stayed moist but I did reduce the cooking time in the oven just a tad.

I consider this recipe OK.  Mine were about 3/4 in. and I cooked just 25 minutes and they still came out very dry.  It must be one of the other ingredients causing the pork to come out dry.  My dry again in a water bath.  If they weren't so dry I think they would have been good.

These were very easy and pretty good.  I don't like soy sauce though, so I didn't use any, but it probably needed it, so next time I will use it.  They were very dry and hard the next day, but otherwise, pretty good.

These were okay.  I didn't think they were flavoful enough on their own and could have used a sauce or applesauce on the side.  My husband like them better than I did so I will probably make them again.  They were very simple and easy to make.

I cannot believe I found a recipe that both my husband and kids loved and it takes about a minute to prepare!  Thank you, Jodi.

This was so perfect.  My fiance and I liked it a lot, will definately make again.  It was not bland at all. UPDATE 12.29.2016: Fiance then, same husband today, and still making this recipe...as written and enjoy it just as much as we did in 2003! I think it's safe to say this recipe will remain in my recipe box :D

I thought this was, well, interesting.  I didn't think it was quite flavorful enough, so the second time I made it, I marinated the chops for about two hours, and then grilled the meat on my George Foreman Grill.  I added red pepper flakes, 3 cloves minced garlic, onion salt, and worsheshire sauce - melted the butter and other ingredients listed, and threw in a ziploc.  It was good, but I'm not sure if I will give this a third shake....

It was Ok. The sauce was runny so I would baste throughout the cooking time. The sauce tasted good but needed a punch. less brown sugar next time.

I have a very hard time cooking pork chops, but these turned out so good!  I accidently forgot the soy sauce, but they were still excellent. My husband told me not to put the soy sauce on next time either, because he loved these just the way they were. I'm printing this out and putting it in my recipe box.

Thank you very much, I now have something that my son will eat seeing how he likes a sweet taste.  I had no problem making it. I think my son could even make this meal with my supervision with the oven. It was a hit with my husband also.  Thank you, thank you, they are already stating that it is something they would eat again.

This recipe seemed to sound so good, but I did not like the very THIN sauce.  The sauce didn't add as much flavor as I was looking for either.  Won't make this one again.

I used Domino "brownulated" granular brown sugar instead, as it was easier to sprinkle over the chop.  I also followed others advise, and I mixed soy sauce with worchestshire sauce with some garlic.  Very good recipe!

I loved how easy this recipe was however I wish I knew what thickness her chops were because mine were about 1 inch and they came out very dry.  They had great flavor on the outside but tough and dry inside.  Next time I will use my thermometor and only cook until they reach 170 degrees and not to the 1hr stated time.  I will try again and hope the will turn out tender as others have stated.  They were quick and easy to make.

I didn't think that these came out so well, but they weren't too bad.  The flavor wasn't overwhelmingly memorable, but no one complained at the table, so I consider it a "success".  Probably wouldn't make them again, though.

First of all, I must have used a much different cut of pork chop than the original recipe called for. Mine cooked much faster than 45 minutes and turned out tough. Also there was very little flavor to them. I would not consider making this again.

My family didn't like this recipe.  The chops were kind of funny tasting.  Pork chops are best just grilled on the barbeque w/some seasonings.  Maybe some bacon wrapped around them for added flavor.

This is wonderful!! I was concerned about them being dry after I read the reviews, so I marinated them first for a couple of hours in equal parts worcestire sauce and soy sauce, then followed this recipe and they were wonderful!! So tender and lots of flavor!! I wished I had made more! Also, just a little hint: I have found that baking pork chops makes them dry so I bake them in an aluminum cake pan (only about 50 cents at the grocery store or wherever) and they stay moist- this works well with chicken too!! Thanks for the recipe!!

I really didn't like this one.  The sauce was way too thin and didn't leave much flavor on the pork chops.

I have a very picky 6 year old and he LOVED these so much that he wanted more! That does not happen often! It's quick, easy and very tasty. I did add some salt, pepper, garlic and worcestershire sauce to the chops before the brown sugar, butter and soya sauce. It's a keeper!

PORK CHOPS TURNED OUT GOOD, BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE PLAIN. DID NOT USE ALL THE BUTTER INSTEAD O TABLE SPOON USED TEASPOON. TURNED OUT GOOD. BUT NEEDED SOMETHING EXTRA KIND OF PLAIN
