After reading the reviews, I added flour to the butter mixture right off the bat.  About 1 1/2 tbsp. Stirred it well and cooked it slightly before adding the broth first slowly, then the crem slowly.  The flavor of the sage leaves was wonderful.  I added just a dash more of dried sage.  Served it over chicken cordon bleu.  Gave it a rich taste.

this simple sauce has such a wonderful delicate flavor. made a couple times now and it's been a real crowd pleaser every time.  i didn't realize what a great flavor fresh sage has! tossed it with angel hair baby peas and sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of parm at he end. make sure you just barely undercook your pasta by a minute then it will finish cooking once you add the hot sauce, absorb the liquid in the sauce and thicken it.  i wouldn't add a thickener unless you are looking for a pasta-roni effect.  ew. recipe is wonderful as is i think it's really just as good with half and half and 1/2 a stick of butter but it IS sage butter sauce and not a diet food so who cares.  thank you for this recipe it's going to be a favorite for us.

I served this over acorn squash gnocci.  Delicious!  I used half the butter and started with a rue for extra creamy thickness.  Also added fresh parm at the end.  I will definitely make this again.

Modifications: + Used Parmesan cheese and doubled the chicken broth as I didn't have heavy cream (as suggested in another review)  + Used my spice and nut grinder to mince the sage leaves instead of chopping + Added a dash of flour to thicken the sauce. Review: I thought it was a good sage based sauce but a little on the buttery side for me. Will make again, but with less butter next time.

I used the pan drippings from a whole baked chicken instead of broth, added a little less butter, used some flour to thicken, added milk since I didn't have cream.  (will try next time)  put the leftover chicken into sauce, to have another meal (over biscuits!)  so easy, and a nice change from gravy

Not too bad, and simple to make.  Ladled the sauce over rotini pasta, added flour like the previous reader suggested to thicken, and added just a little curry spice and sugar in the raw to complement the subtle sage.

This Sauce is so easy! The flavor is perfect for any pasta! I did add flour as a reviewer suggested to help thicken just a bit. I did not have chicken broth in the cabinet so I used a couple vegetable bouillons to 1/2 cup of water and it was beautiful! I added red pepper flakes with garlic powder. When using for salmon I added a couple drops of lemon juice. This sauce is versatile for anything your taste buds want to add! My favorite sauce!

Oh how I love how this sauce turned out! It is a lighter flavored sauce so don't serve it with anything too over powering. I used this recipe as a base to go off of... I also added some flour for a rue, because I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I also added sauteed mushrooms and some parmesan cheese. I also let some baby spinach cook in the sauce before serving. All of it really complemented the sage, which is the star of this sauce.

Delicious. I have served over chicken and over sirloin steaks.  I added the whole pint of cream to make thicker.

After searching for the yummiest “brown butter” sauce for awhile now, I think I’ve found it- With a few adjustments this is DELICIOUS! Here’s the steps I took: When butter is melted and just starting to bubble add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, let simmer for one minute and then add CHOPPED sage leaves and cook for 2 more minutes. This allows for the butter to “brown” and develop a yummy nutty flavor. Next, when adding cream/stock and 1T cornstarch beforehand with whisk to develop the perfect sauce consistency. Finally, just before serving with your favorite ravioli or gnocchi add heaping 1/2 cup Parmesan. The results are scrumptious!

Great taste! I added flour to the mix in the beginning. If you do this, make sure you only add a little because as it heats it thickens. It won't thicken right away. Excellent recipe and VERY rich!

This was excellent! I was trying to find recipes for the different herbs I grew this year and so happy I came across this one. Tried with chicken and fettuccine noodles and was so tummy! Going to try it with shrimp and angel hair pasta next and cant wait!

Very good, and so easy to make.  I used light cream instead of heavy cream, to save some calories; and used a bit of flour to thicken as others had suggested.  It went together well, with the pumpkin ravioli I made.  I think next time I make this, I would add a bit more sage; but that's probably just personal preference.

Very tasty but I found the sauce too watery when made as described. Second time I added 1/2 cup of parmasean cheese and simmered for 15 min to thicken it- perfect! Such a good flavor with spaghetti squash

I made this recipe exactly as is. It is delicious and savory and delicate. Be sure to use heavy cream or it just won't be the same. I served it over pumpkin sage ravioli. They compliment each other perfectly.

This is a delightful sauce, it was developed a couple of hundred years ago when many courses were the norm for the upper classes.  Modern day American's, please don't try to make this a gravy, or a one course moistening agent for pasta.  This sauce is to be spooned by the tablespoon over fish or chicken.

I made this sauce for some butternut squash ravioli I had in the freezer.  I liked the thinness of the sauce for the ravioli (added pecans and sage leaves for garnish).  I plan on using this recipe from now on as it's such a great base and has so much potential in other recipes so thickening it may be an option.  My butter began to brown a bit which I think added a nice element to the sauce.  My only alteration was to add a bit of freshly ground nutmeg to compliment the butternut squash in the ravioli.  A+++++++

Followed the directions as written. The sage was too mild. The sauce was easy to make, but I think I will use chives next time. Yes, I will make it again.

Very good & very easy! I realized at the last minute that I had bought heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream, so had to improvise. I just substituted the whipping cream for the heavy cream, and then added about 2 tablespoons of aged, hard, grated cheese (I used a mix of parmesan & romano, but either would work). Stir or whisk until melted. (TIP: use a plastic or silicone whisk to protect your pan from scratches) I also did 2 quick grates of a nutmeg over the pan, since I was serving it over pumpkin sage ravioli from Aldi's. It helped amp up the flavor, but go lightly...nutmeg is strong & should be used sparingly.  I'd probably skip the nutmeg all together if I was having this with angel hair pasta & veggies. But with pumpkin, it was perfect!

Wow!!! Soooo good... My family loved this! I took other reviewers advice, and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour to the melted butter before I added anything else. I also chopped some mushrooms up and added them with the broth and heavy cream. My kids liked it on the pasta, but I was most excited about them dipping their vegetables in it, and actually enjoying their vegetables!

This is so amazing...

I did however add a little more fresh sage torre up..about  1/4 cup white cooking wine and a little grated parmesan cheese...

I have been cooking for years and there are certain flavors I just love...white wine in sauces...if cooked down the right way..is an explosion in your mouth...

Thank you for the recipe...

This is now my go to sauce recipe for when there is almost nothing in the fridge and everyone is tired and hungry. It’s just as great over pan seared scallops as it is over gnocchi. Tonight it’s going over refrigerated chicken tortellini!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated. 
After all, why  do reviewers make all these changes and then review the posted recipe that really isn't the same thing?!

I was making it to put over butternut squash ravioli.  The sauce was way too thin.  I read one reviewer had slightly undercooked their pasta and the sauce was absorbed.  That may have been the way to go.  The sauce tasted wonderful!!  I probably will make it again, but will  thicken it with some cornstarch or flour?

I made exactly how the recipe is written and put over butternut squash raviolis. It tasted great but next time I make it, I will add flour to make it thicker.

I tried this recipe and thought I was way to thin. So I added the left overs from the other night to a rue witch made it much better for tortellini.

This does not work at all as is, the sauce is too thin and did not thicken no matter how long I waited. I finally added flour the the mixture and got it thick enough to be functional, but I will not make this again. Though I might use some chicken broth the next time I make alfredo sauce to make it a little lighter.
