This was ok, but I was expecting more of a savory flavor burst.  I followed the recipe to a "T", with the exception of halving it.  If I made this again, I think I'd definately add a healthy dose of minced garlic.  THANKS for the recipe, poppy!

I made it with a dry Italian Seasoning mix (1 T dried basil, 1 T dried oregano, 1 T dried thyme, 1 T dried marjoram, 1/2 T dried rosemary,  1/2 T dried sage) and 1/2 T  minced garlic. It was very good.

I copied another reviewer and used Italian seasoning (5T) and a small clove of with the butter. Next time I would pour the "extra butter" over the bread to make it a little gooier.
