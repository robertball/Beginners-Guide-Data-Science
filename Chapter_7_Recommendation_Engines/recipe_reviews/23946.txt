I made this dip for work and then for a get together and it was the only dish that was totally gone at the end of evening.  I used medium salsa to give it a kick, as well as Tony Chachere's seasoning.  Served with tortilla chips.  Excellent!!!

I loved this dip and so did my guests!  It was very easy and the addition of the cumin gave it sort of an exotic taste.  We had it with crackers and pita triangles, very tasty!

I brought this dip to a baby shower, and several people asked for the recipe.  The biggest compliment to this dip is that my husband, who hates spinach, likes this dip.

I halved this recipe and followed as stated except for the green onions.  Used onion powder in place of the onions.  This was thick so I added an additional cup of salsa.  This dip tastes best hot and get very stringy as it cools.  Next time I will use less spinach.

Absolutely delicious! My family's on a bit of a health kick, so I used light cream cheese and omitted the bacon. Still tasted fabulous! They all asked for the recipe.

I made this just as the recipe says, but did noot really care for it. The salsa gave it an unpleasant taste to me, a few people did like it.

Very rich, but very good! I used mild salsa this time because my younger siblings would be eating it, but next time I might try using a medium or hot salsa to give it a bit more of a kick.

Yum!  Used 1 bag chopped fresh spinach, steamed and squeezed dry.  Omitted the cumin and tomatoes and used chunky medium salsa and pepper jack cheese.  Delicious warm with veggies to dip!

This dip was fantastic. I made it for some hungry men and it was gone in minutes! I did get a few bites myself and found they guys didn't just eat it because they were hungry but because it was just that good.  It was very simple to make with readily available ingredients. I loved the tomatoes  mixed in and even thought it might be too much with the salsa but it was a great amount. I even added some cayenne pepper to give it a little more spice since we like that. It was great that it could all be prepared stove top. I live overseas and we don't have a full oven (really its an oversized toaster oven!). I was able to bake the main course and do this at the same time. I will be making this again and again and again!

I made this recipe for New Year eve. party and it was a big hit. This was my first spinach dip, and I was thrilled. 

My changes were fresh spinach and stewed tomatoes (Mexican Recipe/ Delmonte). My dip looked nothing like the picture (green).

Thanks for the recipe!

Great dip. I wanted to try it for a while, but wasn't sure about the salsa in the recipe - turned out better than I thought. Nice change from the usual spinach dips. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it! I cheated and used "real bacon" bits, I'm sure it would have been 5 *'s if I had used the real bacon. I used more of all of the the dry seasonings, we like to taste each ingredient. Enjoy.

Amazing!  Everyone LOVED this.  The bacon makes the dip.  It is even better on the 2nd or 3rd day once all the ingredients have melded together.

I made this dip for my boyfriend and his buddies for one of their "game days" and it was a big hit!  Very easy to make and a nice change to the normal spinach dip recipes.

This is yummy parred with some bolillio bread cut up into small bites. My 3 year old even loved it but it was a little on the salty side for me, will make again but omit the salt.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I just wish it wasn't loaded with fat with the bacon and other fattening ingredients. That's what makes it so sinfully delicious though so I wouldn't change it for anything. I made it as it is listed with no changes. I liked it both warm and cold.  I made it for dip night and we couldn't get enough of it.  It is too expensive to make on a regular basis but what a delicious way to up my iron. Part of what inspired dip night was the need to try out different spinach recipes to up my iron intake for nursing my newborn baby. THis was a definate winner.

This recipe was really delicious.  Everyone at my party loved it.  I did substitute fresh spinach for frozen and opted to use more salsa instead of the tomatoes.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and it was gone in no time.

I made this for my boyfriend's office potluck and it was a huge hit! He said people gobbled it up so quickly; I should have doubled the recipe! 
I only did one thing different - I added a heaping tbsp of sour cream just to keep it extra moist overnight. Next time I might try leaving the tomatoes out and using more salsa (I LOVE SALSA), and maybe even adding some vegetable soup mix.
As is though, it's a great recipe!!

This is soo good I am thinking about making another batch right now!!!

I did make a couple changes based on what I had on hand and my personal preferences

Skipped the bacon and green onions
Instead of diced tomatoes, used a can of Ro-Tell Diced tomatoes with green chilis
Used a cheese blend instead of just mozz. , 
Added a bit more of each spice (maybe double),
Oh and I usd fresh spinach, steamed first.

Served in a pumpernickel bread bowl with blue tortilla chips, Was going to take a picture to post on here but it went so fast  and I had none left!!  :)

I make this dip with a girls detention school and they love it!  It does not look that good but the taste makes you forget about the look.  We eat this with blue tortilla chips.  It is always a big hit.

Unbelievably good - I had a poker party and it was a huge hit.  The bacon, tomatoes, and salsa add a lot of flavour.  Expect your guests to ask for it again and again!

I just recently graduated from high school and for a final project we had to chose a recipe high in iron. I made the recipie for my entire class and every single high school teenager liked it! I then served it at a school carry-in, with the faculty and a few students, it was liked just as well among the faculty members! It is very appetizing!

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years.  It is always a winner at parties, and with family & friends.  

I don't change any of the ingredients.  I like Jack's Salsa from Costco over any other.  I think the salsa makes the dish. Everyone wants my recipe... but I'm not sharing.

I used fresh spinach & left out the tomatoes.  It was very good.  I think fresh garlic would be a good addition

I just made this for the first time, as I had a bag of fresh spinach in the fridge that needed to be used up. I steamed the spinach in the microwave for 3 minutes, as a couple reviews stated, then drained and chopped. I didn't have any green onions on hand so had to omit those. 
This. Is. Wow.  
So good! Will definitely make again. Might even add a half pound of cooked ground beef next time, as this recipe resembles the rotel dip that our family always adds ground beef to, and that would make the dip more like a main dish. But the original recipe is perfect as is! :)

It was ok, but missing a lot of flavor and I didn't think near creamy or saucy enough.   I would probably go it alone next time, but I would probably go with another brick of creme cheese, along with some heavy cream to dilute it some.   I would also sub out the tomatoes for Rotel and use Cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella.

Absolutely amazing!  I used fresh spinach instead and skipped the tomatoes. Delicious!!  Will be making more often.  Right kind of kick to it.

As per some reviews, I added 1/2 cup sour cream to keep it from being too firm. I love this! Not a bit left after a birthday dinner. Yum!

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe to use up what I had in the fridge. Only change I made was to use minced white onions instead of green.  Served with blue tortilla chips.  Best spinach dip I've had!

I had a half a bag of fresh spinach which I steamed, squeezed and chopped. This came out to about half the spinach needed in the recipe, so I only made half. I did mine in a mini crock pot,and put all ingredients in together except the fresh chopped tomatoes. I tasted it prior to the addition of the fresh tomatoes and it was awesome. After the addition of the tomatoes, it wasn't as good and seemed a bit bland. I would give this a 5 without the fresh chopped tomatoes, but more like a 3.5 with. If anything, I might add some additional salsa if you want a more tomato taste. Unlike a previous reviewer, I enjoyed the zip of the salsa in this dip and I only used mild salsa.

I made this for my graduation at work. everyone seemed to love it, i changed the recipe a bit i used double everything except for salsa, and just 1/2 packs of spinach. The garlic was very strong.. although I have never tried spinach dip this was good!

This was great!  My young children LOVED it, couldn't get enough!  I made it exactly as the recips said, my only complaint was the time it takes to make the bacon, bt I guess that's just part of it!

The bacon and mozzarella make this dish! It was an easy and tasy version version from the traditional spinach dips. My guests ate it up!

This was not a favorite at our gathering.  I will try this again leaving out the salsa and the cumin and add some sour cream and a little more garlic powder.

I made this for a baby shower at church. Every bite was eaten! And there was a lot to chose from! Great dip! My favorite spinach dip ever. Very easy to make too. For me, the bacon is what made it so much better than other dips I have tried.
