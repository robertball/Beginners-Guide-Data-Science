Sounds good and I want to try it.  But it says nothing about rinsing the quinoa so that the bitter saponins are removed.  (Some quinoa, sold in North America, is pre-rinsed, but some is not...)  Let's be careful out there!

I made this yesterday afternoon as a snack for my kids.  It was delicious.  My 18 month old gobbled it up.  I would add more peas next time and not add them until the quinoa was almost cooked.  I prefer my peas bright green and just barely cooked. I might also saute the onion and garlic in the butter while the quinoa was roasting, just to get more flavor from the garlic and onions.  I thought this was very similar to risotto and might add shrimp next time to make it a full meal.  Yummy!

I'm a self admitted tinkerer. Can't leave a recipe alone- mine included. That being said, this recipe is fantastic and here's what I did (no disrespect to the author). I added 4 sprigs fresh thyme ('cuz I had it), 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp grnd coriander, cayenne pepper and a few more peas (1 cup). This was a side dish for Baked Falafel and was superb!

Wonderful side dish!  I followed the instructions exactly except I used chicken stock-I think it adds more flavor and used a shallot for milder onion flavor.  My whole family loved it-they are pretty picky too.  Next time I'll add more peas.....

This is an awesome quinoa recipe. Cooking the quinoa with the onion and spices really ups the flavor. I always cook quinoa with chicken broth but this recipe is even better! I love, love, LOVE it. Just don't add the peas as early as it says unless you like overcooked, mushy peas. Maybe throw them in the last 5 minutes. I make this all the time and my family loves it.

Love this dish! 
I made this for a potluck feast and it was a huge hit.  Next time I make it tho, I will cut the cheese in half. It was very salty, so that may have been from the veggie broth, but the cheese was a little too strong for me. I added more quinoa that was cooked in plain water to balance it out and that did the trick. 
  The next day for lunch, we fried some up in a pan with an egg, and put sliced tomatoes on top for a great brunch.  Also, it's good in a tortilla with chopped tomatoes and cucumber on it.  This is such a versatile "comfort food" combination. Thanks!

I am new to Quinoa, tried it once and did not like it.  But this was great.  I made a few changes: added sauted mushrooms and substituded canned asparagus for the peas.  I did not have the parmesian cheese called for so I substituded Kraft parmesian cheese.  It was wonderful. Will definately cook again.  Thank you for this receipe.

This is my favorite quinoa dish now! I made the changes suggested by another review and added 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp coriander, more thyme and it was excellent. This is definitely going in my recipe book!

So, I misread the recipe (didn't have on my glasses) and put the cheese in with the peas. So, I am rating on the flavor. I didn't rinse the quinoa first because I thought wet toasted quinoa sounded like a bad idea. The toasting gave it a richer nutty flavor. Thanks for the idea and I will use this technique again. I rated on the flavor since I messed up the cheese. Nice side dish!

I don't comment on recipes very often but I felt compelled to comment on this one. This recipe was DELICIOUS! I am new to cooking quinoa and have tried several recipes that turned out ok but this one was the keeper. My husband and son also thought it was great and asked for it again. I read previous comments and also added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp of coriander and it kicked it up just right. I also used a whole cup of frozen peas and added them at to the quinoa for the last 5 minutes of cooking. The peas remained firm that way. LOVED this recipe. Don't hesitate to try it!

Very simple and good! I made some minor adjustments - used dried italian herbs instead of fresh thyme, garlic salt and threw in some asparagus I cut into bit-sized pieces. Fantastic!

I followed the recipe for the most part.  Instead of fresh thyme I used dried, 1 tbsp. of dried parsley, and 1 cup of frozen peas.  I also used parmesan cheese since that is what I had in the fridge.  Turned out delicious and I would definitely make this again!  I may add some chick peas next time too!

My first time to make quinoa, it was easy and tasted great!  I didn't have fresh thyme, used ground.  I imagine it would taste even better with fresh herbs!

This was very good, but could have used a little more flavor. Some sauteed red peppers might go nicely in this dish. I'd probably also add some additional herbs and garlic.

I make this almost every week and I love it. This is what I do...I rinse the quinoa (some kinds you don't need to but the kind I buy you do), I add a teaspoon of coriander and cumin, and I add two cups of peas but not till the last 5 minutes of cook time so that they still have a little crunch. 

This is an awesome toddler food - my 1 year old loves this.

Also - don't substitute the cheese. I've used parmesan just because I had it on hand and the pecorino is a much better flavor. I think I add more than a half a cup (ok, I know do but I tell myself it's there abouts). 

Wonderful recipe and it keeps in the fridge really well.

Love this recipe! Added 4 slices of lightly cooked bacon and 1TBSP of the bacon grease instead of the butter and it really kicked it up a notch. My family doesn't realize that they are eating healthy and they love it

To rinse or not to rinse? RINSE! If you have a mesh strainer, rinse thoroughly and then get as much water out as possible by shaking off the strainer and then setting the strainer on a folded paper towel to draw off the remaining water. It does make a difference with the flavor. Proceed as called for in this recipe. My quinoa roasted in the butter just fine after rinsing.

This recipe is very good though I found that it lacked some flavor. Rather than add a bunch of spices to perk it up, I diced about a cup of mushrooms and sauteed them with a little butter, garlic, salt & pepper. It was just the ticket! Also, I used a heaping cup of frozen peas. I left out the thyme because I didn't think it was meant for this dish and I'm glad I did. This is a great recipe and one I will use again and again.

Delicious and simple, I did use veggie broth since I'm a vegetarian but other than that I followed the recipe and enjoyed every bite.  It's a great side dish, but other veggies and spices could easily be added to make it a main dish. The leftovers are perfect for a filling lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

I make quinoa 2-3 times per week.  This was a fine recipe, but nothing spectacular.  I added the peas as specified in the recipe because the softer the better for my 1 year old!

I did not care for this at all, though SO liked it. I followed the recipe to a T but still found it very bland. I'm not sure what I could alter to try again.

Needs salt and seasoning!  Also I would wait 10 additional minutes to add the peas so they don't end up so mushy...

I added Italian Seasoning (Food lion has a generic shaker of a blend of common spices- included Marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano, and basil ).   I also used grated parmesan cheese instead of Romano cheese.  Good!

My husband had a second helping of this and he hates grains!  This is very tasty.  I used red quinoa and I think that next time I will use fresh peas for more of a color contrast.

I really enjoyed this. I prepared it as a side dish to some simple grilled chicken. I added about four gloves of garlic. My daughter loved it as well. Will make again. Also was very good reheated.

This was a good side dish with our salmon fillets. I did not add thyme, cooked the onion and garlic with the quinoa. I used more peas to my liking, added them towards the end of cooking as per reviewers and sprinkled less cheese on top. Would make again.

This is good.  I did omit the garlic due to an allergy and I cut the thyme in half because I'm not a real fan.
I didn't have any fresh parsley when I made this tonight.  It is not nearly as good without.  It was still edible though.

Super easy side dish. I made this for an extended family dinner and everyone enjoyed it. I used 1-1/4 cups of peas and added them in the last 5 minutes as others suggested. I did substitute dried herbs for the fresh and grated Parmesan for the Romano cheese because those were on hand. I also added s little extra garlic salt after it was done.

Based on other reviews, I made this by adding 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 tsp cumin (did not have coriander on hand). I also increased peas to 1 cup. Adding the peas within the last 5ish minutes of cooking because I prefer a bit of crunch.

I removed parlsey because I didn't have any . And used some mexican cheese blend that I had in the fridge. It turned out pretty tasty! 

I would definitely make again. Would be even better with some sort of meat like chicken or pork.

Loved this side dish! The only thing I changed is that I used half of the cheese and it  is was still nutty cheesy deliciousness. There was no need to rinse my quinoa, read the package and it said nothing about pre-soak...maybe there are different types being sold. Def worth a try!

Very good! Made it exactly the way it was stated with one exception. I used cilantro instead of parsley bc I didn't have parsley. It was delicious and husband wanted seconds! Served it with turkey and gravy and cranberry sauce. Yummy.

This is one of my go-to's when we don't have a lot of food at home. We almost always have the simple ingredients for this recipe on hand. Simple and delicious! Oh, and I really don't think people who haven't made this yet have any right to rate it! If you have ever cooked with quinoa, you know it should be rinsed. I usually just buy the pre-washed kind.

Excellent "non-boring" side-dish that will get a lot of requests to share the recipe. I also have tried this adding sauteed red and green bell peppers which adds another great level of taste.

I had never cooked Quinoa before. I was a little worried, but this recipe sounded like it would taste good. The directions were simple and I loved the flavor. It reminded me of the risotto I used to make.  Delish! Can't wait to try several variations that I've "cooked up" in my head!

This is one of my absolute favorite quinoa recipes!  After investing in a 4 lb bag of quinoa from Costco, I was on the hunt for new ways to prepare it.  I've made this recipes two weeks in a row, which is not common at all in our house.  It's just delicious - the cheese packs a huge punch of flavor!  This is a staple recipe for us.

It's become a family favorite.  I have used Parmesean cheese in lieu of Pecorino Romano!  It truly goes with anything you are cooking!

This was tasty, but not our favorite quinoa dish.  I did double the peas in the half recipe but kept everything else the same.  We will have again.

This was a good recipe. I will make it again, adding different spices and veggies to our liking. I used bullion cubes instead of broth and it tasted a little too much like ramen. I won't do that again!

This was my first experience with quinoa and I was pleasantly surprised with how much we all enjoyed it! I did omit the thyme, as we do not care much for it, but made it as written otherwise. Even my skeptical little guy loved it...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Try substituting the thyme for fresh mint and using Wild mushroom stock to give it an earthy base. If using this as a main dish try adding small pieces of smoked bacon to it. Sounds heavy, but the fresh mint makes it feel like a light summer dish!

I loved it! Although, I just used whatever I had. I used coconut oil cooking spray instead of butter, dried thyme, I added cayenne peppers, and I didn't have peas so I used edamame instead, I left out the cheese...delish!

Really like this!!  Had to make a couple substitutions, I had a ton of turkey broth so I used that and I only had dried thyme, I adjusted to 1/2 teaspoon.  Hubby and I both really liked this, but of course we both like quinoa.

We're not really quinoa lovers. My teenager will not eat it. Tonight, he had seconds! This will be our new quinoa recipe. I'm sure the cheese makes the difference.  Next time I will try with Parmesan. Pecorino is sometimes hard to find at our usual grocery store.

Very tasty quinoa recipe. I used tri-color quinoa. I only had Parmesan cheese so I used that. It was very good. I'm not sure why the peas are in there--just extra carbs. I think I will leave them out next time.

This was enjoyable, but really nothing to make it stand out.  I wish I would have waited to add the peas until closer to the end of the cooking time.

Loved the flavor of the toasted quinoa.  Didn't have fresh thyme or parsley, so mixed 1/4 tsp thyme and 2 tsp parsley in with stock.  Still came out great.

Great flavor, but cooking the peas with the quinoa makes them a little gray & not so appetizing. Next time, I'll put the peas in when the quinoa is almost finished.

I served this as a healthy grain and veggie side dish to a fish meal. It was VERY tasty. The only things I tinkered with was I increased the amount of frozen veggies to 2c and used mixed veggies as that's what I had on hand. Also, i cut out the cheese at the end to save on calories. VERY tasty. I did rinse the quinoa first and cooked it in veggie broth. Cooking it in plain water doesn't give quinoa any taste. Thanks XTinaU!

This is only the third recipe I've ever made with quinoa and it was a great one. It's the first time my family didn't think it tasted, felt or looked funny. Took some other suggestions and sauteed the onions and garlic in with the melted better and left out the herbs because I didn't have any fresh and forgot to throw in any dried. Probably only used about 1/4 cup of the Romano and stirred it all in; didn't want to dirty another dish. Served it with Easy & Elegant Pork Tenderloin and Sweet & Spicy Sweet Potatoes, both from this site. Fabulous meal, enjoyed by all.

Tasty dish, easy to make!  I cooked the onions and garlic (and added more of both) at the same time as the quinoa.  I used dry thyme instead of fresh, vegetable broth instead of chicken, more peas than what the recipe calls for. Yummy!

I realy enjoyed the quinoa.  I'd read that some of the other readers thought that it was a bit salty.  I only sprinkled the cheese on top and it came out deliciously.

Very nice and easy to make side dish.  Like others have said, I'd put the frozen peas in for the last five minutes of cooking only.  I put in some cumin, and I think it would be good without it too.  I had chicken stock (instead of broth) on hand and it worked very nicely.  I'll def be making this again, especially since I'm trying to replace rice with quinoa in all our food!  

note to self: add more salt
