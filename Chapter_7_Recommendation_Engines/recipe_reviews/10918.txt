Okay, I make a HUGE amount of chocolate chip cookies-they are my absolute favorite! But, as good as my recipe is, I am always looking for that ultimate cookie.  This is NOT the one.  I followed the recipe (everything except the unbleached flour-I used regular flour), shook the hands-the whole bit!  I'll have to say, they were very pretty cookies but entirely to cake-like (maybe it was the baking powder-never put baking powder in my cookies before). They had almost no taste (the true test of a good choc chip cookie is if the cookie part can stand on it's own without the chips).  But, the worst part was the kosher salt.  I kept biting into chunks of salt.  Stacy, I appreciate the amount of time that went into perfecting your recipe but I'll have to keep looking.  Thanks anyway!

I must have tried every chocolate chip recipe on the Internet, and in all my cookbooks, six of which are just on cookies alone! This is the first time that I was able to get a cookie that looked like a bakery cookie, and didn't flatten out, even though I did not have to chill the dough. It's an easy cookie to make. Wetting hands just made it easier to roll and look pretty; it's not a must. I'm surprised at some reviewers thinking it was so difficult to wet their hands, or that dark corn syrup is such an exotic ingredient. I guess they don't bake very much. Also, I don't like the taste of baked nuts, so I left them out and used extra chips. Loved them! I overbaked one batch till they were all golden, and that was wonderful also. Chewy cookies, not dry. Thank you so very much for this recipe, Stacey. I am indebted to you.

I'm a fan of thin and crispy cookies, which is the only reason why I didn't give this recipe 5 stars.  I tried it out for a friend who craved big chewy chocolate chip cookies and he freaked.  I've been making them ever since.  A few tricks I've learned with this recipe:  

*use an ice cream scoop to dump the dough onto the sheet.  The cookies are enormous, but they definitely retain their chewiness and moist texture(use the baking time listed in the recipe).  The ice cream scoop yields 3-4" wide cookies that are at least 3/4" thick.

*to avoid the salt chunks that can happen with kosher salt, I let my KitchenAid have at the dough (before adding the chips) for a good long time.  I find that I can taste the salt chunks when I rush this step.

*I add 2 tsp. or so of cocoa powder or even cinnamon to the flour mixture.  It gives the dough a little kick and helps it stand up to the chips.

*if you're out of half and half, I've used regular milk and it works fine as a substitute.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Stacy, bless you for contributing this recipe.  I'm a very serious baker who has been frustrated at the quality of the chocolate chip cookies I've been baking in the past.  I don't like the Toll House recipe.  I've been fiddling with it for years to no avail. I always end up with either very dry cookies or "pancake" cookies with little chocolate chip "bumps". They also fall apart very easily. The decreased butter and the addition of corn syrup in your recipe did the trick.  The baking time is critical. Too little and they're a little raw, too much and they become a bit dry.  I've determined the correct length of time for my oven and the cookies are WONDERFUL!

Sorry, but these cookies were absolutely average. They're not bad, just not fantastic like the author would have you believe. I prefer a chewier cookie and these were too cake-y for my taste. I did like the level of instruction of the recipe, I find that very helpful.

A week ago I took the top six Chocolate Chip Cookies from this website and made all of them.  I took the cookies to work and my church social, and asked people to tell me which cookies were their favorite.  This cookie got about twenty percent of the vote.  I'd have rated it higher if I was a "chewy" cookie fan.  My husband, who liked these the best, said that he didn't like them at all when they were first baked, but after they had aged a week they were much tastier and had a better texture.

Tough crowd reviewing here! Would agree that this is a soft cookie rather than a chewy one. I do have a couple of suggestions...make sure you folks are using Kosher salt not Sea salt. Could account for the chunks some of you tasted. Using unbleached flour gives you a denser, chewier cookie than bleached flour will.

I was a little leary of putting the molasses in but followed the recipe except for half and half - used milk instead.  I was VERY pleased with the results, taste and texture of these lovely morsals!  Took some into work and people were asking for the recipe.  Awesome A.B.C. cookies!!!

These cookies are amazing! They come out very soft and chewy. I mailed them to my husband serving overseas, and he and the other guys said that even two weeks-old they remained soft and delicious! They even withstood the high heat well!

Stacy you weren't kidding, these really are the best! I am an experienced baker and these are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made! Make sure to follow her instruction exact. Although, one time I did use light corn syrup instead of dark because it was all I had around the house and they turned out just as good. Thanks Stacy!

Thanks for posting, I've been making this cookie for years and I lost the recipe and found it here!  Thank you!  I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scooper, and slightly flattened with a wet fork and I bake them for 20 minutes. My daughters can't get enough of them! Cheers!

I followed this recipe exactly as directed. Was very simple to make and one of the best homemade cookies I have made yet. As a rule, I do not like chewy soft cookies, but these were wonderful and tasty. For those of you who state that this was not a good recipe there must have been something you didn't follow exactly. (by substituting or omitting other ingredients.) I will continue to use this recipe and pass it on to others.

These are my absolute favorite chocolate chip type cookies - although I don't usually follow the directions exactly (like the wetting my hands part).  I've also made these using honey instead of the corn syrup, milk or chocolate milk instead of the cream, and adding all sorts of goodies like M&Ms, white chocolate chunks, etc.  YUM!

I discovered this recipe on here at least 8 or 9 years ago and I have never been disappointed. I have never actually rolled the cookies, always just used a cookie scoop, you get nice uniform cookies without the effort. I also just use whatever kind of corn syrup I have on hand.

Lately I've begun experimenting with it and added two things, about 1/4 cup more butter and a bag of Skor bits. Talk about a decadent cookie! The kids I work with Tuesday night can't get enough when I bring cookies and milk! 

Oh, and being a former Pampered Chef consultant, I never bake my cookies on anything other than stoneware - a key to perfect cookies in my opinion.

These cookies were a bit cakey for me. I was really looking for a chewy cc cookie. They do look so pretty it's almost unreal, but I go for texture above all. I will try "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" next; stay tuned!

Chewy because they are cakey, but very good.  The cookie itself tastes great and the combo of chocolate and walnuts is always good.  The cooking time was perfect for me.

This was really, really good. I am personal chef and I can say I have made hundreds of CC cookies. The vote on this one with my clients was 5 stars. This will be my go to cookie from now on. I wish it made more at one time!! I think I read in the reviews it did not double well but heck for the taste I will make it again while the first batch is baking. Good job.

This recipe can be improved if she used something other than regular all purpose flour. I won't share that, because it's my trade secret, but I will say this, the half and half does absolutely nothing for the recipe and more egg yolks would make it more chewy. Egg whites dry out dough!

Love this cookie! I try alot of chocolate chip cookie recipes, and by far this one is a favorite at the moment ;)
Here's a tip i got from Ana Olson; substitute 2 tablespoons of flour for cornstarch, it's suppose to make them chewier

Several years ago when my Dad and Mom both learned they had blood pressure and cholesterol issues, I began to recreate my favorite recipes to suit their new health needs. I love this recipe because I was able to make some subtle changes and get a really, really good flavored chocolate chip cookie! I also made some changes to this recipe when I made them for my boyfriend: I used toasted pecan pieces (his favorite) instead of walnuts; I also used semi sweet chocolate chunks instead of the chips - he absolutely loved these! Thanx for posting this one, it is now in my permanent rotation.

I am forever trying to find the best choc chip cookies.   These were very good but not exactly what I was looking for.  They turned out chewy and I like crispier ones.  They make perfect, beautiful cookies.I will save the recipe though.

These turned out great!  Nice and fluffy, and the info about layering two baking sheets was excellent!  I often overcook the bottoms of cookies before the tops are done, but no more!  

The dough alone is fabulous.  You can really taste the roasted nuts in it.   The cookies are beautiful!  They are a little cakey, but not too much so.  They're soft and fluffy, full of chocolate chips, and the actual cookie is suuuper sweet.  I would actually recommend using dark or even bittersweet chocolate to cut the sweetness of the cookie.  I toasted pecans and used those because I hate walnuts.  I also added a couple of dashes of pumpkin pie spice, but you can't even taste it.  I made them the size she recommends, until I got down to the last two cookie balls, which I made about 3-4 tablespoons or so worth of dough each.  They were bigger and extra fluffy, and amazing.  Next time, I'll make them all bigger.
Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe is tasty, but the way it's written is extremely pretentious. I almost didn't enjoy myself while I was baking them.
Instead of chocolate chips, I roughly chopped up two bars of Chateau dark chocolate and used one tablespoon of maple syrup instead of corn syrup.

Not chewy...cake like.   3 cups of flour is probably the culprit.

Yummy cookies, and I very much appreciated the detailed instructions and tips.  I'll never try to "drop" cookies with dry hands again, and parchment paper really saves time on clean-up!  I love the toasted nut flavor and the little zings of saltiness from the kosher salt.  Perhaps not the ideal recipe for a "quick batch," but they're tops for taste.  Watch the cooking time - overcooking leads to VERY hard cookies.

Okay, yes, these are time-consuming, but perfect for when you really want to impress. Take them to a bake sale or potluck dessert table, and they will be standouts.

Absolutely the Best is an understatement!!!!  These cookies are the best chocolate chip cookies that I have ever had or made.  Everyone thought I bought them from a bakery and could not believe that something that good could be homemade!!!  I didn't roll them I just dropped on the cookie sheet like any other chocolate chip cookie, but used less because cookies do spread. Came out perfect!!

These cookies were really good.. I found that they had WAY to many chocolate chips, if I make them again I will reduce it to 1 - 1-1/2 cups. 
I have tried better chocolate chip cookie recipes so I can't give these 5 stars, but they were gobbled up pretty fast in this house!!

*These really are the best!  The kosher salt, cream and corn syrup make all the difference.  Wetting your hands really does help, as does the use of parchment.  Makes a very shiny and smooth dough, and the cookies hold together very well and form a nice shape.  Great texture, chewy, creamy and sweet!  I used milk chocolate chips and omitted the nuts, and I also added an extra-large dollop of sour cream.  This recipe will be passed down to my children!  Thank you, Stacey, for perfecting a favorite recipe!!*

My year long quest for the perfect chocolate chip cookie is now over!  I was hesitant to try yet another choc.chip recipe, as all others have been less than worth the effort.  This recipe worked beautifully.  I even had to use light corn syrup and salted butter (I reduced salt to 1 tsp)... it was still a success.  My little taste testers concur -- it's the new "family favorite"!!!!

This recipe is exactly like it was described. It's chewy, soft, puffy and most of all delicious. Follow all the steps as told, though. I think that is important so you get the perfect recipe result. I am taking a picture now and submitting it for this recipe.

This is a decent cookie recipe and does indeed produce a chewy cookie.  That is, unless you overbake.  Contrary to the submitter's suggestion, I found the ideal baking time to be between 12.5 and 13.5 minutes.  Anything longer than that and the cookies turn pretty hard after a few hours.  Hint: if you start to see the cookies browning, get them out of the oven.  Also, I though the recipe called for a little more salt and definitely more chocolate chips. I found the corn syrup to be needless after baking a second time and would add just a bit more white sugar instead next time.  This is an excellent recipe in the fact that it does produce a wonderful and balanced texture.  I ended up with 40 cookies and were eaten by my husband and I alone in 4 days!

I have been looking for a cookie that stays soft and chewy after one day and this is it.  This cookie is great.  I used light corn syrup and light brown sugar and they came out great, I also used milk instead of half and half.  Thanks for the great recipe.

OUTSTANDING COOKIE - well worth the effort. The only thing I did differently, was instead of wetting my hands, I wet the scoop. The look of the cookie and the taste couldn't have been better. Thanks!!

I thought this was a great soft cookie recipe.  I did take the advice of one of the reviewers and added a few sprinkles of cinnamon and cocoa powder, and all I had was milk chocolate and white chocolate chips, so I combined them.  Also left out the nuts as I am not a fan.  Easy enough for my 5 year old to help with, so it was a hit with her too!  Thanks :)

These cookies are absolutely wonderful. I like to make them big with plenty of stuff in them. Try using some white chocolate, some dark. I usually skip the nuts but the end result is still great. Thank-you so much for this recipe!!!

Thank you, everyone, for reviewing my recipe.  I truly appreciate your input.

If you don't want to wet your hands and make perfectly round cookies, you can easily drop them onto the cookie sheets.  A small ice cream scoop works wonderfully--especially since this dough is very sticky.  The "wetting of hands" method comes from none other than the Dessert Goddess herself, Maida Heatter, who was recently inducted into the James Beard Foundation Cookbook Hall of Fame.  Also, when I first submitted this recipe to CookieRecipe.com, back in the spring of 1998, I specified a "Note" at the bottom on how to toast nuts--if desired.  Of course, this should be done FIRST in order for them to cool before chopping and adding to the recipe.  Maybe I should write the Staff and ask them to change the directions.  Oh!  Corn syrup (light or dark) can be found in grocery stores.  Usually, it is stocked near honey, molasses, maple syrup and pancake syrups.

Keep on bakin'!  : )

Sincerely, Stacy

This recipe does make soft cookies, but they lack taste.  Yes, I followed the recipe exactly!  The cookies looked great--but the taste just isn't there...sorry.  I think it would be a great starter cookie if you are looking for soft cookies—they are soft (kind of like soft batch cookies) but there is definitely something missing.  I’ll keep looking.

okay by accident ONLY I used 2 & one half cups of flour (I was using a half cup measuring scoop) and the cookies were perfect. I did everything the same except the flour and the wet hands thing. the cookies still came out shiny & bakery looking. this is a keeper, indeed!

I really think these are THE very best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  The recipe is clear, soooo concise.  You can't mess up this recipe.  I did find Cappucino chips at Trader Joe's by Guittard and mixed them in with the regular chips and they, too were outstanding!

I made this recipe for my roommates.  They said they looked like the perfect cookie and really enjoyed it, but like other reviewers said, they were very cakey. I guess that's just a matter of preference. If you like cakey cookies, these are perfect!  I prefer my cookies to be a little gooier, but I would make these again.

A coworker brought these to work today. I feel like the title is a bit of a misnomer as I don't feel they're the best ever. Maybe she forgot to shake off her hands exactly ten times? They were dry cookies, not necessarily chewy. And, in my opinion, a few too many nuts. Don't get me wrong though - a cookie is a cookie and I'd never turn one down!

The rock salt and dark corn syrup really make totally different. Has a little less butter than most recipies. In fact, it has a little less of everything you don't want, and a little more of everything else. Great cookie!

I have baked this cookie for several times now, and it turns out chewy and nice every single time! Really really nice cookies that are too good to be home-baked. Takes a bit longer but it's worth it.

I had very high hopes for this recipe, and bought several ingredients I'll probably never use again. I was disappointed-- these cookies are very cake-like. I'll stick with the old-fashioned Tollhouse recipe.

I found this recipe about 3 years ago.  It caused a very unexpected response from my wife.  By using mint flavoured chocolate chips, I was able to get my wife to like mint flavoured chocolate.  Isn't it amazing what a truly great recipe can do.

I thought this was a great cookie.  Being basically lazy, I didn't wet my hands, etc., or measure each cookie --just plopped a good amount out on the cookie sheet.  Still turned out great!

This was an ok cookie. I found the dough to be rather dry and wetting your hands was a good way to add more liquid. The cookie itself was morecake-like than chewy.

This has become the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I make. They are delicious and when you skip the things like wetting your hands and shaking them 10 times over a sink, they can be thrown together in a jiffy. They've always turned out perfectly for me except once... the only time I followed the instructions to a T.

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've made.  It takes a little effort--but the results are worthwhile.  Everyone who has tasted these has raved about them (and wanted the recipe)!

Loved these cookies...best cc recipe I've ever made! I like my cookies soft and thick and these delivered both. I didn't have dark corn syrup so used light corn syrup and they turned out great.

These are great! Made 'em without the nuts. Soft and delicious, not really chewy though.

Definitely a good, solid cookie! My friend and I decided to use the dough to spell out her parents’ names as a surprise and it worked out great! The spreading was minimal, the the cookie ended up thick and chewy. The only flaw that I could find was that the cookies needed twice the time to bake. Overall; a tasty cookie!

Im always looking for the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. For this recipe, I used regular all purpose flour and regular salt. I'm not a fan of kosher salt. And for the syrup, since I didn't have any dark syrup I used regular syrup. Also I don't like semi sweet chocolate chips, so I used milk chocolate chips, and evaporated milk instead of cream. And I omitted the nuts. I appreciate the wetting hands tip. Thank you for posting! Four star's because I had to substitute the salt, flour, and chips.

Big win!!!!!!!!! High brown sugar content helps keep the cookies moist...and I am sure that is what the molasses is for as well, however I substituted honey and 1% milk and they were still great. I will be making these again!

This is the absolute best chocolate chip cookie recipe on this site. Also the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever run across. I've made them so many times I know it by heart. They are a soft chewy cookie with a nice crispy edge. Only suggestion is do not over bake.

This recipe worked really well for me.  I used light corn syrup because that was what I had on hand.  Made the cookies smaller, used a scoop (not the wet hands method) and then chilled the dough for 15 minutes before baking.  These were a hit!
