The pork chops came out so tender and juicy, however something was missing out of the veggie part...next time, I am going to up the spices.

The recipe was a success.  A great one-skillet meal.  I also added chopped black olives.  Next time I'm adding fresh chopped mushrooms, too.  To ensure flavorful pork, I marinated the chops while I was prepping the veggies.  I cooked it at a med-lo temp, only stirred twice, and because my boneless chops were more than 1-1/2" thick, I let 'em cook an extra 10 mins.  Just in time, too, as a little fond had formed in the last few mins of cooking, which gave the veggies an extra punch of flavor and was fine with me.  The chops were perfect!

Delicious! I always try to make these as close to original as I can first time. Glad I did. Note here is only for others like me who might not have all ingredients on hand. I used 2 green bell peppers and did not have banana peppers. I used lemon but didn't have lime. And I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had. I did sprinkle a little Cajun seasoning in the chops too but it was probably not needed. They were really flavorful, and the veggies were too. I added about a tablespoon or two of butter at the end, a small pat on each chop, to keep them from going dry and add flavor. I really loved this recipe. Thank you so  much for sharing.!!

The meat came out very moist, but was lacking in flavor.  The veggies were good, though next time I would probably use less bell pepper.  My hubby said he would have liked some mushrooms tossed in too.

We enjoyed this!  The peppers mellow a little bit as they cook but still have good flavor.  My pork chops were thin-cut so they cooked in about 20 minutes.  I'll definitely make this again.

I didn’t make it exactly as written because I didn’t have all the ingredients. No lime and I used cabbage and peppers for the vegetable base. Used a thick bone-in pork chop and seared it on both sides. I scaled it down to one serving and it came out great. Tender & juicy. Cook time wS

My husband liked it. I thought the pork was kind of flavorless. I didn’t have lemon juice or Italian seasoning so I used Byron's Butt Rub. Should've used more. It smelled awesome. I’ll make it again but will season the pork much more

This recipe was amazing. I did not change a thing and they came out with great flavor and were so tender. I would recommend making as is first then adjusting if needed for your taste. But for me it's just right.

This came out with great flavors and my husband liked it a lot.  My chops took longer than 25 minutes because we like them well done. I also made some changes: used fresh garlic, oregano, in addition to other Italian seasoning. In addition to paprika, I also rubbed the chopps with a little mustard seed powder and cumin--I didn't have Cajun spices. I also fine sliced the peppers and onion Julianna style for a more escabeche look.  I will cook it again!
