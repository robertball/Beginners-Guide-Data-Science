Made this recipe on Mothers Day & everyone enjoyed! I used 1 lb of lean ground beef - 2lbs seemed like alot. Turned out good. However, it is a very tomato-ey chili but has very good flavor.

The sweetnes of the wine and the crispness of the peppers made this chili awesome.

This was a little too sweet for my family.  I must admit I used pinot noir instead of cooking wine.  I did not add the green peppers and used chili beans instead of kidney beans.  Needs something and I can't put my finger it. Thanks for the recipe.
