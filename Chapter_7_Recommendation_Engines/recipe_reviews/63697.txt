This recipe is a real keeper. It is spicy though and has an exotic taste, so beware if you like a more basic chicken. I cooked it on my george foreman grill and I loved the pimento sauce on the side!

I doubled this and marinated the chicken breasts for about an hour.  Great served with couscous and the Lentils and Tomatoes recipe.

This recipe is a favorite in my house.  I make it at least once a week.  We're not on the South Beach diet so I make it with couscous, homemade flat breads and tzajiki sauce. Definitely good!

GREAT, easy recipe!  Used my foreman grill and it worked like a champ.

Hint:  make extra olive oil mixture and use on grilled onions with honey and golden raisins.  also add honey to the cous cous for complementary flavors to the spice.  mmm, mmm!!

We didn't think this was very exciting. It was just another way of grilling chicken...not bad though.

The flavor of this was good, but the chicken was really really dry. My husband said it was because there was no acid in the marinade so maybe next time we'll try it with some lemon juice or vinegar.

Not really a fan of this taste, my husband described it as "dirt."  It wasn't bad, but wasn't really that good, to us.

I made sauteed the chicken instead of grilling.  It also has the benefit of making your kitchen smell divine.  At first, I wasn't too sure of the allspice and cloves with chicken, because I usually use those for pumpkin pie and mulled cider, but it was really delicious.  My husband, 11 and 6 year old kids at every last bit.  Also - added feta and parsley to the couscous.  Used whole wheat couscous.
