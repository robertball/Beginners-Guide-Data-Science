Excellent cookies for a gift! Be sure to finely crush all the peppermint candies. Unless it's very fine, the candy won't stick to the cookies as well.

This was great. It was a very simple recipe that turned out excellently. The peppermint taste was not overwhelming. These also freeze very well. I will permanently add this to my recipe box of Christmas favorites.

This cookie recipe is very tasty!!  I enjoyed the buttery and minty flavor.  It was quite time-consuming though.  Grinding up the peppermints took a lot of time.

I liked this recipe the first time I made it, and more each time as I alter it with help from other reviewers! This year, I add peppermint extract to the mix. I also use a leveled 1/2 tbs for smaller more bit size cookies and only cook them for 9 min and they're perfect. I also tryed using my magic bullet as suggested, much better then the blender.
Enjoy!

These were a hit at the office! I ground the peppermint candy in the Magic Bullet, too (hint: 4 candy canes = ~1/4 cup), and the consistency was perfect. I also used red and green striped candy canes for a more festive color. I love peppermint, so I added 1/4 tsp peppermint extract with the vanilla. I tried them out at the office, but with the reviews they got, I will definately make them for the family Christmas party!

They were good, seemed to be missing something. Kids loved them though and very easy to make.

These were not that good.  I have never made snowball cookies before, so maybe I didn't know what I was doing/what to expect but I make a ton of cookies every Christmas as gifts and try a few new ones every year.  This one will not be made again. Crushing the peppermints into a powder was time-consuming, and the cookies themselves just taste like a butter ball with a tiny bit of peppermint in them.  Not my fave.

These cookies are pretty good - it seems like for the time you put in you should get more out of them. I will be making another batch because one is not going to be enough. I got 30 cookies out of one batch. I used candy canes that I mashed and I put in a teaspoon of peppermint along with the vanilla. Thanks for sharing these holiday goodies!

I crushed one of those large lollipops from amusement parks with a meat tenderizer instead of using peppermint candies.  The recipe made 40 cookies (instead of 32 as listed) and turned out just like snowball cookies should. With my oven, I had to bake for 20mins. Overall, I think I prefer the snowball cookie version that uses nuts instead of candy.  This recipe involves a lot of sugar already, even after I omitted the 2nd 1/4 cup of candies from the snowball covering mixture.
