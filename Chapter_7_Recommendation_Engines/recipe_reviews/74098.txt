This recipe is good.  I grate the zucchini instead of chopping.  I don't know why the recipe calls for milk tho.
The zucchini is naturally moist and the eggs add plenty of liquid.  I leave the milk out.

I just made these and I think they are excellent.  I grated the zucchini and subbed parmesan for the cheese and shallot for the onion.  Very crispy fritters with a nice taste.  I would not change a thing.  And I would not wait until summer - these are great in the winter too!

As per other user's 'bland' warning, I used 1 cup of shredded colby/jack cheese instead of romano, added 1 small chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro, substituted bisquick for the flour, added a dash of cumin and paprika, and only used about a tablespoon of milk.(Next time I will omit.)  They were awesome!  Thanks!

These were amazing. I shredded the zuccini and used butter instead of shortening. They were the best part of the meal. They were even good cold as leftovers.

We forgot the salt and pepper and they were still absolutely delicious (even the next day).  Served with sour cream and got raves from everyone!

I have never tried a recipe like this before & was very pleased. Even my two year old daughter liked them! It's a great way to add veggies to your diet without losing taste. It did seem like it was missing something. I will be making these again & trying a few new spices in it to see if I can't add a little more flavor to them. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to bump the spices way up on this. More salt, pepper, cheese, and still they seemed a little bland. I got a packet of fajita spice blend from the cupboard and put in about a teaspoon or two of that, and they were much better. I also made a dipping sauce out of horseradish, mayo, and sour cream. Hubby liked them a lot.

kind of tasteless, you need to add alot of salt and garlic powder to give them flavor. I think you should add a tablespoon of baking powder to make them more like potato pancakes.

The way this is written is a 3 star recipes but has the possibilities for a 5 star. Tweak to your tastes! One large zucchini yields two cups , two cups of flour is too much, cut back to 1-1/2 and add 1/4 cup of milk more or less. Definitely shred the zucchini and fresh garlic is a must, add lots of cheddar cheese , no onion powder is necessary. Serve w/ fat free sour cream .....yummmmm

I did make many changes so I don't know if it even counts as the same recipe.  I did equal parts flour, cornmeal and breadcrumbs. I added yellow squash too. I added alot of parmesan cheese, a little lemon juice and cut down on the italian seasoning to almost nothing.  I baked the fritters on an electric griddle so I could cut down on the butter/oil and do ALOT at once.  I made 150 for a large gathering and served it with th Hearty hot/cold tomato soup on this site.  Over a year later and people are still talking about it.  Also, they freezer really well stacked between freezer/wax paper. Just set oven at 400 and throw them on a cookie sheet for about 10 min (frozen).

The recipe is right on track. HOWEVER, ditch the milk and grate the zucchini. If you have a picky eater amongst you (such as my vegetable-avoiding boyfriend), grate a small potato and mix it with the zucchini. It'll also add a nice chewy texture.

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  I read the reviewers not one said "perfect as is"  My Zucchini Fritters turned out great because I listened to many of the reviews.  The recipe I came up didn't resemble the recipe at all: I shredded the zuccs, used margarine, spices, 2 eggs, less flour, and Italian breadcrumbs.  I created my zucc. pancakes from this recipe & reccomend readers to check out the reviews before making ingredient selections.

I have made these twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and felt there was to much flour and not enough seasonings,but they were good.    The 2nd time I added a grated onion, 3 garlic cloves grated, and lots of salt and pepper, they were better this time..     I will certainly make these again..

This is a great recipe! The changes I made were: I shredded the onion and zucchini, 2 eggs instead of 3, and used a mix of cheddar and mozz cheeses vs the romano. Also, I suggest looking for a heart healthy oil since this has to be cooked fairly thoroughly.

great base recipe, i added 2 slices of diced canadian bacon, omitted the parsley, onion powder and milk & used parmesan instead of romano. I also cut the flour down to 1 cup instead of 2, and only used 2 eggs. I cooked them in a touch of extra virgin olive oil instead of shortening as well, and they came out fantastic.

These were very tasty but I did make considerable changes with the help of the other reviews: After grating the zucchini and putting it on a cheesecloth, I sprinkled lightly with salt and then wringed it out really well. I let it sit for a bit and wringed it out again. Then, I pureed onion and roasted garlic to add. Omitting the milk, added 1/2 cup cornmeal, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup seasoned Italian breadcrumbs along with the cheese and herbs, etc. The eggs binded it enough so no other liquid was added. After shaping into thin patties, I coated them with cornmeal because I like crunch. Make sure the oil is super hot. They were very tasty and my husband who disdains zucchini ate several. Thanks for the basic recipe (Paula Deen has her own and I sorta melded both recipes into my version.)

I just finished making these as a midnight snack. I used fresh chopped garlic as I didn't have the powder on had and did 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs I found 2 eggs to be more than enough (I made half a batch) I did not use the milk and added a teaspoon sugar. They were crispy, flavor full and a great snack. I would recommend serving with a dipping sauce if your using them as an appetizer

I thought these were very tasty. I'd probably rate higher but I don't think my family particularly cared for these. I think they'd probably say they were "ok". I read other reviews that said to leave out the milk. I did and I think it was the right choice.

This was a very good recipe! Even my two year old loved it. He generally shuns anything green. I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. I grated the zucchini and onion instead of chopping, and I also fried in margarine instead of vegetable shortening. This seemed to add another layer of flavor. To those who said these were bland, that's why it says all the spices are to taste. If you think they are bland add a bit more spices. Overall, a very good recipe and a great way to use those garden fresh veggies! That's always a plus!

I too modified this recipe a little. I only used a 1/4 c. milk, 1/4 c. parmesean, 1/4 c. romano and 1/4 sharp cheddar. Everyone LOVED the fritters, even cold they were good!

This really is an amazing recipe.  I wasn't sure how large a 'large zucchini' is, sometimes gardens grow mutant zucchinis, but my zucchini was about 2 pounds, I used almost all of it.  I followed the recipie exactly, except I added shallots and panko break crumbs, and also I also shredded and chopped the zucchini to add a little more consistancy and variety.  I also added a few sprinkles of cayanne pepper, because I like the stuff and it adds flavor.  
Great recipe, great flavor, and I would do it again tomorrow.  Thank you again allrecipes.  I love you!!!!

I just finished enjoying these! I roughly followed the recipe. I used one large zucchini (salted, grated, pressed and left to strain for about 30 minutes), two eggs beaten with a splash of milk, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, 1 cup of flour, 1/2 small onion, some fresh basil and ginger. These were absolutely fantastic and we have plenty for left overs!

This was my first time ever having zucchini fritters. I found them tasteless...though I'm not sure if it's this recipe specifically or just zucchini fritters in general.

Excellent recipe.  These were easy to make and very tasty.  I used many other reviewer's suggestions - grate the zucchini, use cheddar/monterey jack cheese, omit milk (I added about 1/3 cup to give them the right moisture), and add paprika and cumin.  We will definitely have these again!  Thanks for posting!

Ok yum! I took other reviewers advice and also used 2 eggs, omitted the milk and used approx. 8 tbsp flour (I just kept on adding until it seemed like the right consistency). I swapped a red onion for yellow and found it to be much more appealing in colour. I also only added garlic powder and left out the rest of the seasonings as I didn't have them on hand. Again, I used cheddar instead of romano because it's what I had on hand and shredded the zucchini instead of chopping. Next time I think I'll fry up the onion a little bit beforehand as I found it was still a bit for my liking. Instead of using shortening, I fried them up in some margarine.   I would rate this recipe 5 stars, but gave 4 due to all the changes I made. These cook up fast and are absolutely delicious. It's an easy recipe to play around with and I can't wait to make them again!

I found the fritters a bit tasteless. I would use less flour and add more to spice them up if I make it again. Nice texture though and they remained intact and looked good when browned.

I Love this recipe. The only thing I did different, was I kept my zuc & onions quartered & not finlly chopped. I have passed it on & everyone loves it also.
 I could eat this in place of meat anytime. Thank you so much for the recipe.

These were a lot blander than what I expected.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Next time I'll try what others suggested and add cheddar and cornmeal, less eggs and less flour.

My husband and I both loved these, as a snack, appetizer or for dinner with a salad.  I added a little extra salt while it was frying, otherwise it can be a little bland, and only about half the milk.  Grated the zucchini and squeezed the moisture out with paper towels before adding to the mixture so that it wasn't runny.

I wish that this recipe gave exact amounts of salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder.  I only fried a little bit of the batter the first time I made these and I thought they were a bit bland, very much like latkes, as others have observed.  When I added more salt, seasoning, and Romano to the batter, they were much better.  Other changes I made were to use 1C flour and 1C cornmeal, only 1/2C milk, and I fried them in vegetable oil the second time which cooked more evenly than the shortening I used at first.

We like things spicy in our family so I added diced jalapeño peppers to the mix.  As other reviewers noted, the mix was very watery even after squeezing all the water out of the zucchini I could and I omitted the milk as recommended by others.  I still had to add quite a bit of flour to get it to the right consistency for frying.  All in all, they were really good and by adding the jalapeño peppers, they tasted a lot like jalapeño poppers, which was a nice surprise.

I make this often. I also shred the zucchini then squeeze out the juice, otherwise it's too moist and stays mushy in the middle. Also, I don't use the milk. Don't really need it.

Grate or julienne your zucchini and then sprinkle with about a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. Let zucchini set in colander and stir a few times over the course of an hour. This technique will rid you of all 
the zucchini liquid that would compromise your recipe!

I shredded the zucchini, used gouda instead of romano, left out the milk, and fried them in margarine.  They held together nicely and had a nice, simple taste.  We ate them with sour cream.

Great recipe! 
I was givin some zucchini by a friend & wanted to find some easy recipes to incorporate it into. I had to scale down the recipe to fit just my husband & I. I didn't use as much milk as some previous reviews advised. I did have to use quite a bit of seasoning otherwise it did seem bland. 
We will most likely use this recipe again!

Tried this tonight and I really enjoyed it.  It made 18 fritters for me.  I added the kernels of one corn on the cob that was left over in the fridge and that made it really yummy! I dipped the fritters in ranch dressing and also ketchup but they were also delicious by themselves.  great use of all that zucchini (oh, and I grated it-didn't chop it).

Bland and poor texture.  1 cup milk would have made a runny mess so I did not add it.  The first frying-pan full, I fried as the recipe directed.  Yuck.  They were rubbery and bland.  I added some baking powder and sprinkled on more seasoning to the remaining batter.  The second frying-pan full was better and they puffed up beautifully.  To the last of the batter, I added 1/2 cup of corn meal and some more seasoning and that tasted best.  I also think some more onion would have helped.  I can't believe anyone would consider this "Best Ever" without such radical changes that it isn't really this recipe anymore.

Great recipe!  I grated the zucchini instead of chopping.  Also, I used wheat flour (2 cups minus 2 tablespoons) instead of white, which gave it a great taste.  I didn't add the onion powder or parsley, but added dried rosemary instead.  I made a tomato & cheese cream sauce to dip.  Delicious!

This is a decent recipe to start from, but I made rather a lot of changes to it. I grated the zucchini, added more onion, and skipped the milk. I used EVOO instead of shortening and used as little of it as possible. I also skipped the cheese inside the fritters and ate them with warmed goat cheese afterwards.

These were great. After reading the other reviews, I changed a few things. I grated the onion, zucchini and cheese together in the food processor. I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup plain bread crumbs. I omitted the milk and only used 2 eggs and they were still a little too wet. I used garlic salt and course ground pepper. I also added some fresh chopped basil from the garden which gave it an excellent flavor.

A great option for zucchini variety!  I made this low carb friendly by substituting the regular flour with 1/2 cup of soy flour and 1/2 cup of almond meal.  Worked very well, and quite tasty!

Really good recipe, but definitely omit the milk unless you are going to drain/pat dry the zucchini. I used Old Bay seasoning and finely chopped garlic and shredded the zukes and onions. It was great!

Fantastic recipe! Just pour in milk gradually and stir until the consistency of the mix suits you. Leftovers taste great in toasted sandwiches with cheese and a little sour cream!

A delicious way to use up my abundance of zucchini, as I'm sick of freezing bread! These were tasty...reminiscent of potato pancakes. My only change was to thin the batter a little with extra milk, as my first few came out more like zucchini pancakes when the batter was thick. Yummy!

I made these fritters, but they were too dry and did not look like fritters - more like pancakes.  Next time I will add less flour and maybe a little milk which I didn't add based on some of the reviews.  I did add some oregano, diced hot pepper and minced garlic.  Taste was good but a little too thick.  Will make again with the above revision.

It was so good. The second time I made them I changed it up a bit. I added a yellow squash, carrots and jalapeño. I grated everything. Went with one cup flour and one cup cornmeal. Also added cumin and only used about 1/4 cup milk. So freaking awesome !! My menfolk can't get enough. I have to make for a third time in one week.

I changed it a bit. Used ground oatmeal instead of flour. Added a bunch of herbs and left out the milk. This was really good. Kids liked it too. I will makes these again!

Good recipe, but i did make some adjustment to the flour and milk  (reduced by 1/2)as i wanted to taste more veggies than the batter.  When my husband heard i was making this he told me he wasn't going to eat it, but after he tried the first one, he ate 3 more. Big success for someone who doesn't like zucchini.

These were so good!! We even reheated them for lunch the next day. For the leftovers I added a dollop of sour cream. As good as the day before, and that doesn't always happen.

Don't skip the onions!  I was out, and substituted carrots. As a result, the fritters were pretty tasteless.  Maybe less flour & not forgetting the onions would have helped.  We added maple syrup and ate them like pancakes to give them flavor.

i like them. i add a little more seasoning to mine though, and cheddar cheese with more flour so they are thicker and fry easier/ dipped in ranch or ketchup they are pretty tasty.

I used oil instead of shortening and substituted Parmesan for Romano, otherwise I made them exactly as stated and they were great! I might try green onions next time. Thanks!

We had lots of large zuchini given to us by a friend and not enough recipes to use them up.  We were having a barbque and were looking for a side dish. This fit the bill perfectly.  I didn't add as much milk as they requested because it seemed pretty moist. I did them in batches of 4, fried them in my large cast-iron skillet for about 3-4 minutes per side. Came out wonderful!  I did substitute some pepperjack hard cheese and it gave it a little more heat.

This was excellent.  I found I did not need the shortening to cook, I placed just a smidge of butter in the bottom of the pan and cooked in that.  Tasty...the kids did not catch on till they found an onion...I will actually try making this as a bfast item without the onion and garlic - I bet they would not notice its not their regular pancake especially if I add some choco chips.

These were disappointing. They were good, but definitely not great. I think my husband is being generous by giving these 3 stars, so this rating is for him. I am leaning more towards 2 stars, or maybe even just 1 star, because they need a lot or work. I switched things up a little by using 1/2 cornmeal, 1/2 flour, subbing Parmesan for the Romano, and I only used 2 eggs. Then I fried them in olive oil (but vegetable oil would be better). I did put milk, but only 1/2 cup, and then it seemed too wet so I added a bit more cornmeal. I completely agree with the reviewers who suggested omitting the milk -- there is NO need for it. I am always generous with spices, and even added extra onion and some red pepper flakes for zing, but even with all that I added, these were bland. We could not taste the zucchini or the onion and we wanted to taste the vegetables!

I liked this. I took the advice of another and grated my zucchini and i also used colby jake instead of ramano cheese..very tasty Instead of using two cups of flour i did half flour half seasoned breadcrumbs which gave a nice flavor. I attempted to leave out the milk but it wouldnt mix right without it.

I had never made fritters before. I did change a few things however. I added parmesan instead of romano and added about 3/4 cup. I also used olive oil instead of shortening. My biggest mistake was makig the first batch too thick. You really need to flatten them out. I also should have added more salt, papper and garlic. But I did dip them in a little bit of ranch dressing and they were very tasty. My husband ate a gob and swooned over them without the ranch.

I shredded the zucchini, used parmesan, then added 1/2 cup asiago, and used only 2/3c milk and these turned out awesome. too bad I didn't have any sour cream for dipping these in though. Oh and I used a leek instead of an onion because I didn't have any.

Ditto on the blandness.  Too much flour, not enough spices.  I added garlic, hot sauce, a little sugar.  They were not crispy as I thought they would be.

Made receipe as directed using a little less milk as suggested by other posters.  I tasted the batter before frying  and upped the dried spices because it was so bland.  Sorry but I would not make these leaden fritters again.

Really nice recipe. Didn't use onion powder or romano cheese, and replaced the cheese with a hunk of goat cheese and some other cheese I had laying around. Anyhow, they were delicious.. turned out great and looked really nice.

These were really good, and very filling.  I added a little season salt to the batter and I might try adding corn next time.  These would be great as a side with soup but my family ate them as a main course, my2,4 & 12 year old all loved them (the 12 year old ate  till he hurt!)
Enjoy

These lacked flavor!!!! They held together well and cooked well but even after adding minced garlic, paprika, cayenne pepper, and extra salt and pepper these fritters still were missing something. The family ate them all but agreed they needed something to help them down...everyone tried a little of everything with them to help the blandness of these fritters...syrup, barbque sauce, and ranch dressing.  I won't be making this recipe again. It was a fun try though.

Flat, bland pancakes.  I made it as per the recipe.  You can't taste the raw batter, so it would be helpful if the spices had quantities.   I couldn't taste the cheese at all.  Using garlic butter on the griddle gave a little flavor.  I couldn't think of a dipping sauce to make them better, so I tried adding pesto and bacon bits on the griddle before pouring the batter.   I ate too many as I tasted different variations on them, so they are easy to eat for sure.  I would not try this recipe again.

These "fritters" were almost inedible.  Two cups of flour?  Seriously??  Fritters were heavy and doughy, a far cry from the recipe I usually use which calls for five tablespoons biscuit mix.  They never developed a nice, crunchy crust.  More oil helped a bit here but they're still barely edible and I'm not picky.   They were also far more bland than the recipe I usually use.  I guess the zucchini flavor got lost in all that flour.  Added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, which didn't hurt, but this recipe is really beyond redemption.

I can't stop eating these!  Great for a quick grab type of
food while on the road, at work etc.  I did what another viewer did and added 1/2 Cup of Flour & 1/2 Cup of Corn Meal (judge by the wetness), I also omitted the milk as I shredded the Zucchini  and rung out the moisture from it....added my own take on spices and fried them in butter.....LOVE THEM.  My house smells amazing and I'm glad I bought 4 large Zucchini as I'll make more once these are gone.....yes they are that good :-)

These were really good. I made them as written, except I grated the squash and omitted the milk.  They were quick, easy and a tasty way to use my summer bounty of zucchini.  My children loved them, which is always a plus.  Oh, I sautéed them in coconut oil, which gave them a crispy edge.

Made the recipe as is except left out seasonings and added McCormick's Garlic and Herb seasoning instead since we are on low sodium diets.  Everyone in our family love these.  So easy to make and very tasty!

Can add chopped red, yellow and green bell peppers to add color and more veggies too.

I only had 1 egg. But with that, no milk and following the rest of the recipe I had a good consistency. My 7 year old thought these were ok. I thought they were great and ate 90% of the results.

I followed the direction exactly, and use very good cookware. They did not turn out. My son, 9, took on bite and asked, "Do I have to eat anymore of this?" He thrives on veggies, they are his favorite.  My husband did the same thing. It is a never make again in my home. It had great texture, but no flavor. I will not even try to doctor this one up. I would not know where to start.

My finished product was great, but not because of this recipe. It turned out excellent b/c I read many of the reviews & made the modifications suggested. It is a great "sneaky" recipe to get kids to eat their veggies. My two boys loved them, especially dipped in sour cream. If you are going to try this recipe, I recommend following the modifications made in the other reviews.

I shredded the zucchini and put in minced (dried) onion instead.  THese turned out like pancakes with zucchini in it.  If you do not like pancakes, then dont make/eat this. While they tasted good, the pancake thing was not what I was going for.  Next time, I would cut the milk and flour in half and maybe add more zucchini.  Season All salt was a good addition for the spices.

Made these with my first zucchini from the garden today. Wished I had read the reviews before I made them, b/c I agree, they need quite a bit of seasoning. I used Parmesan cheese in place of the Romano. Followed the recipe exactly, but will probably adjust it a bit next time with less flour, add cornmeal or breadcrumbs next time.

These are definately not "the best" zucchini fritters ever, they don't have enough flavor to them, I would not make them again.

this recipe was just "ok" for me. Probably won't make again.
