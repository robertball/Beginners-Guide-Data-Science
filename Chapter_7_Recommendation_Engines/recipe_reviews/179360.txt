This was "lick the plate" good according to my husband.  I did my own substitutions because I'm snowed in . . .  I boiled one chicked breast seasoned with rotissarie seasonings.  Once cooked, I cut the breast into chunks for my cup of chicken.  Next, I used the broth that it made, added 1 and 1/3 cups of 2 % milk, 1 jar of mushroom alfredo sauce and frozen green beans, corn, pea and carrots.  I had to cook twice as long as the recipe suggests to get the bisquik done.  Total awesomeness!

Mom made this all the time when us kids were growing up (I'm 60 now). So glad to see the recipe here. Only thing different is that I use raw boneless chicken cut into pieces. It's done just right in the time it takes for dumplings to cook. I do add what ever veges I have on hand, usually organic carrots and green beans. Remember, you need the beginning liquid to be thin, it thickens up when the dumpling are finished cooking. Yum.

Very good quick recipe. I tried this tonite for something different and quick. I used canned mixed veggies tho and half can cream of chicken and half can of mushroom soup. Added some poultry spice . I liked it alot and doesnt take very long either .I used boneless chicken pieces tho and baked them first. Still much faster and tastes great .

Yummy recipe. I had to sub a couple ingredients.  I used 1 cup of almond milk with 1/2 cup of water instead of the milk. Added salt, pepper,  onion powder, garlic powder and rubbed sage, also added canned corn along with the other veggies.  I didn't have bisquick so I used some hungry jack pancake mix with some flour and almond milk (again). I would definitely make this again!

I loved this dinner.  The only thing I would change is doubling the recipe....maybe tripling the soup.  I have a lot of big eaters and this was barely enough....which was a fault on my part.  Definitely cold weather dinner....very comforting.

Love this recipe, simple and quick to make.  Reminds me of my grandma's recipe. I bet this would be great with leftover turkey round the holidays. I'll update next thanksgiving.

Nice easy recipe, delicious and easy? what could be better? The dumplings will thicken the gravy so anyone who says it was too thin should know to let it sit a while or add just a bit more butter mixed with flour to the gravy. Anyone that says that it is too thick, use more chicken stock or a little water to thin it. One can almost always salvage a recipe if they are a good cook.

My kids love this!  It's an easy meal to make when you just dont have time & the ingredients are almost always on hand.  I've even used canned chicken just to speed things up.  I usually end up adding a lil pepper, onion powder & minced garlic for some flavor.

This was great! I've never made chicken and dumplings and this recipe was very easy. I doubled the recipe and added a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. I used fresh baby carrots and celery. It's a perfect comfort food on those cold winter evenings!

This was excellent and easy.  I made a couple of modifications.  I didn't have frozen carrots, so I boiled some fresh ones.  I used a full can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also used 2 cups of cooked chicken ( I bought a cooked rotisserie chicken for $5).  With these modifications, it was realistically enough for 3 people.

I had never made chicken and dumplings before so this recipe was very quick and easy for me, and very tasty. The only thing I changed was adding 2 cups of milk instead of 1 1/2 and I added a dash of fresh ground black pepper. As I read in another comment, if you have a large family or big eaters you will need to triple the recipe.

Very good recipe. I didn't have a can of chicken and mushroom soup, so I combined a can of condensed chicken soup with a small can of sliced mushrooms.

I love this recipe!  I've made it twice already.  The first time, it burned a little on the bottom, so the second time, I stirred occasionally while the dumplings were cooking.  I converted it to a vegetarian recipe by using seasoned baked tofu instead of chicken, which I added at the end instead of cooking the whole time and just cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and mushroom.  Great and easy comfort food.

I've never tried to make dumplings before and this recipe turned out great the first time.  I used green beans and corn instead of peas and carrots - I'll totally make it again.

This was amazing.  I had some shredded chicken left over and always keep cream soups on hand.   My kids devoured it, I had doubled the recipe but next time I'll triple it.  It was so easy to throw together.

I was not thrilled with this recipe. My main complaint is that it tastes too much like plain old cream of chicken soup, and that's not a soup I enjoy. I thought the other flavors would make it taste less like canned, processed soup, but I was wrong. 

That said, it WAS easy to prepare. 

The changes I made to the recipe were to use fresh, sauteed peas, carrots and celery, instead of frozen peas and carrots.

I also made homemade dumplings instead of Bisquick dumplings. 

Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and was not happy with it. Next time I'll make it all from scratch!

I added a little garlic salt (or powder if you prefer), pepper, and parsley.  It's absolutely delicious! Next time I might add an additional soup and milk - the dumplings have a way of soaking up all the liquid.  We'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe is so good and easy to prepare. I put it together on the stove and heated to a soft boil, about 20 minutes. I then transferred to a casserole dish and put in the oven at 350* for 30 minutes. I then cut up biscuits from a can and placed on top and baked an additional 10 minutes uncovered. I like the biscuits a little toasted. I will definitely be making this again. My husband loved it.

I broiled the chicken and used some of the stock with the milk. This recipe was easy peasy and oh so delicious. Just enough for a few servings.

Loved this. So good. I doubled the chicken  and made the same amount of dough, but made he dumplings smaller so they would cook faster.

Really liked it.  So easy and good. Needed a little salt & pepper (I added when I served it.) Will definitely make again.

Yummy! Perfect amount of meat, veggies and dumplings. I didn't change any ingredients, just doubled everything.

QUICK. Used leftover broccoli and peas. Also, used more milk by mistake, but liked this extra moist gravy.

Husband loved it.  Just remember that the biscuit mix might not look like a lot, but it will be when its done cooking!  I put way too much in it.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes to use what I had: I cooked chicken drumsticks (they were on sale) in the slow cooker with some chicken broth and water, once they were done i picked off the meat and discarded bones and skin, I used two cream of chicken cans with a bit of the juices from the slow cooker, then i doubled the dumpling recipe and did it on the stove top.  It was great.  Hubby doesn't like veggies so didn't add any.

This recipe deserves five stars for simplicity. As a one-pot meal that takes about 30 minutes max, it doesn't get any better than this. I used canned chicken, frozen peas, carrots, green beans, and corn from a big. Great flavor, cheap, and easy.
