This cake turned out nice and fluffy. (Not to mention quite tasty!)  The custard filling was absolutely delicious!

oh wow! How simple, but bursting with flavour!  I added some lemon, lime and orange rind in the cake mix and the whipped icing to give it an extra kick! It got rave reviews at my company picnic!

This is a very good cake.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The custard filling is a little runny, I will try chilling it first before putting it on the cake next time.  The layers go well together, not too sweet.  Will definitely be making this one again!
