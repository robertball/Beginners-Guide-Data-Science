Awesome, yummy recipe; almost as good as Moxie's White Chocolate Brownie!  The only thing I will change next time is to cut the sugar by a good bit, maybe a cup & a half next time.  But my husband thought it was just perfect!

Excellent chewy brownie texture. Perfect edges and crisp shiny top. But WAY too sweet! Update: I made these again without adding the white chips. That seems to have solved the "too sweet" issue for us. They are still delicious.

I forgot the salt...but I really likey :o) I can't stop eating them and haven't shared with anyone!!!  Only thing is I was using metric and based on what it calculated, I adjusted the quantities a little...
More chocolate(200g)
Less sugar(~250g)
and a teensy bit more flour

My family loved the concept of a white brownie! These were very tasty and we loved them. The only thing that didn't go so well was the baking. Mine turned out too browned and crispy on top, which wasn't what I was going for. I wonder if it's because I was baking them in a small toaster oven and they were too close to the element? I will probably put them on a lower rack and try a lower temperature for longer next time. So yum though. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)

While baking it developed a bubble where 1/4 of the pan rose. I pressed it back down.  It was dry, I think the cooking time was too long. I followed the recipe but after a few pieces I ended up throwing it out.

Ok so I loved the recipe, but I was looking for more of a brownie texture and this was more cakelike to me.  To get more of a brownie, I cut the eggs in half (to 2) and added 6 oz. melted white choc. instead of 3 (but that might not even be necessary, I just love white chocolate).  You do have to cook it a bit longer, probably closer to 45 mins, just keep checking it.  They turned out amazing!!

So I made these and the first batch was too cake-like and not chewy enough. When mixing throw in some of the white chocolate chips. Also Make sure the butter, sugar, vanilla, and eggs are well beaten. I advise beating vigorously with a wooden spoon. You may want to try increasing the flour a bit and decreasing the sugar to about 1&1/2 cups. This will yield that perfect white chocolate brownie you crave!

Not sure what happened to my blondies.  I baked them 35 mins.  toothpick was clean I tried in several places directly in the center and 2 hours later I cut them and it was like raw dough under the golden brown top.  I can't give it a 5 or a 1 because it's probably something I did wrong

Love it! It was more cakey than regular brownies.  It was my first time making these and they turned out good.  I add butterscotch chips and chocolate chips which turned out fine.

I made these for my boyfriend for valentine's day after he took me to dinner, AWESOME recipe! the dial on my oven isn't accurate sometimes, so I don't know if my oven was too low or if it should be cooked longer, I had to keep it in the oven for about 40 minutes, and it was still partly underdone. it still tasted great though! 
I folded an extra half cup of white chocolate chips into the batter because i didn't want to keep the leftovers in the bag, which made the brownies extra moist :)

I LOVE that it uses butter and not any of those UNhealthy oils most people think are healthy (except for coconut oil). Not that sugar is healthy, but if I'm going to eat it, at least I'm not adding to the degree of UNhealthy!

these were delicious! i usually do not like blondies or white chocolate, i was making these for a friend, but i might have to make a second batch for me:) i did alter the recipe slightly b/c of my lack of skills. instead of melting the butter and chocolate morsels, i combined the butter with the other wet ingredients, added the morsels at the end and left a few to sprinkle on top of the batter. blondies came out nice and fluffy and moist, not the usual thick density that deterred me before:)

This recipe is a definite must try. My whole family loved it and we even shared it with some friends that were visiting and they too absolutely loved it. I did however, make some changes. I added an extra ounce of chocolate square and around a 1/4 cup more of chips for cutting. I cut out 1/2 cup of sugar. Since I baked it in a 9 by 9 baking pan, it took 15 more minutes after the 35. They were moist, chewy, and with a milky flavor that you'll love. Two tips, buy good quality chocolate and add a bit of tart from either a bit of lime juice to the batter or some fresh strawberries on the side after it's done. Will definitely make it again!

Most of the reviews talk about the recipe being too sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Didn't have to remove and of the white chocolate and it came out dope. Thanks for the recipe.

Best best best dessert ! Made this for a party & it was gone in an hour. Super easy to make & I can think of tons of variations with different flavored chips. Only thing I did differently was adding more chips to the top after it came out of the oven to make it more visually appealing. Will definitely make this again!!

Made this for a co worker for his birthday.  Everyone really enjoyed these.  Left a corner piece at home for my hubby as Blonde Brownies are one of his favorites.  : )  Went together really quick too.  A nice change of pace from the usual chocolate brownie.  Would be really good with ice cream and a drizzle of carmel!!  Yummy!!

These were amazing.  I made no changes.  I made these for a school bake sale, and they sold out quickly.  They are VERY rich and very sweet.

Loved this! Tasted amazing, I thought there was too much butter but in the end it was perfectly fine. I prefer less sugar so I decided to put in 1 1/2 cup. Overall, I'd rate this a 9/10

They were too sugary-sweet, not chocolate-y enough, and too greasy. 

Next time I will cut the sugar in half and melt more chocolate in less butter...

These were good, I used white choc. for the batter and butterscotch chips for the top.  Be sure to spray your wax paper after lining the pan with it and start checking after 25 mins.

Excellent flavor but they simple would not bake through. Maybe if they were in a larger pan and much thinner........

These are awesome!  I cooked them in a 9x9 pan so they were thicker and only took 30 minutes to cook.  I added white chocolate chips inside the batter per other reviews and only used 3 eggs.  I will do less chips on top as they don't melt and browned a lot. Otherwise I will be making these a lot! Great warm with ice cream on top.

My whole family thought these were absolutely delicious. Would not change a thing.  I love how buttery they are.  However, I would not call this a "brownie".  It's more cake like, fantastic nonetheless.

Made these for my husband's birthday and he told me not to change a thing! Here's what I had done - used 3/4 c. each white sugar and brown sugar,  1/2 c. each white chocolate and butterscotch chips and no salt. Also used spelt flour due to family gluten issues, but would probably also be good with 1/2 white whole wheat flour.

Way too sweet for my taste.  More like pudding than brownies.

Too sweet, and I feel like it was missing something. Maybe it needs a topping to cut the sweetness of the white chocolate.......
