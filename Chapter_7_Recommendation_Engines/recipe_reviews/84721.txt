I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because I made a few small changes...as I made it, we would give it five stars. It tasted like something you'd get from an authentic Indian restaurant! I didn't add the green onions or peas to the rice; I thought they would overcook, so I added them to the lentil mixture just before I stirred in the rice. I also added a big handful of coarsely chopped cilantro at this point. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable (it's all I had), and found that the lentil mixture took an extra half cup of broth. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. This is a delicious, healthy and versatile recipe; next time I'm going to add some cauliflower florettes.

This was delicious. I did add some onion while cooking the mushrooms. And I added a little extra cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cardamom (I like spice). This is definitely going to be something I start making fairly regularly.

Excellent.  This is a very forgiving recipe - you can play around with the ratio of lentils to rice and the amount of vegetables and spices. Thanks Julia!

Very yummy rice!  This does take a bit of time to prepare...I realized after already committing to cooking this that I only had green lentils (ALWAYS have red lentils!!) and also had only red and yellow peppers!  So, used those and did not cook either the rice or veggies for close to the 20 minutes called for.  I also left out the cilantro sprigs for garnish as hubby and I both dislike cilantro (ALOT)!  Aside from that, great rice...we really enjoyed it, thanks for sharing!!

This was good, but needed just a little tweaking. I decreased the liquid in the rice, and increased it in the lentil mixture. I used parsley instead of cilantro since I had it on hand. If using as a side dish, I'd say this makes at least 8 servings. This is a bit labor-intensive, but the results are very tasty.

Big hit with the whole family! I can't help it, I always feel like recipes need more spice and other flavors, so I chuck a lot of extras into everything I cook. Either way, this was fantastic.

I changed a lot of the veggie ingredient in this recipe because I didn't have them all on hand.  Overall the flavor of the rice was great.  This is the first time I have used my garam marsala and it was a fragment, tasty spice blend!

This was quite good!  I made it without the lentils becasue I served a lentil salad along side of it, but I am sure they will be tasty in it next time.  I left out the peppers, and I think raisins will a good addition next time.

This was a great recipe -- I, too, substituted chicken broth for the veg broth.  I loved the various spices and the crunchiness of the almonds.

Flabors are outstanding! I omitted the lentils and extra liquid and simply sauteed the vegetables and spices (including onions and peas) and served the vegetable mixture over the spicy rice.
