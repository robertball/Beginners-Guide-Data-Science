The name says chocolate, yet there isn't any in this. I made this according to what the recipe said and it was terrible. I added some chocolate syrup to try to save it, but even that didn't help. It was soo thin and the flavor of the banana was nonexistant, it just tasted like malted milk.

I tried this recipe and it turned out pretty good after a few adjustments. I used only 3 cups of milk and 2 bananas instead of 1. I also added about 3 tsps of sugar. I need bananas in my diet to help with my low potassium so I'm always looking for quick, easy and different ways to bananas. Thanks.

I followed the recipe directly, yet it tasted like a warm Slimfast drink. There was no "shake" to it - it was absolutely thin. I even tried to add chocolate ice cream and ice, yet the temperature of this recipe wasn't the only problem. Don't try this recipe, it tastes disgusting.

This is ok, but in my opinion the banana MUST be frozen! I'd also use less milk - about half, maybe add some yogurt.  A tablespoon of peanut butter wouldn't hurt, either!

I think this was supposed to be chocolate malted milk powder.  I used nestles quik drink mix and followed the recipe except I added a cup of ice cubes.  I agree the bananas might be better frozen and maybe 3 cups of milk instead of four, but it is delicious as is
