Delicious way to have tofu. I used Panko bread crumbs since their vegan rather than making my own.  I marinated it in bbq sauce before breading it.  Because of the bbq sauce I think I could have skipped the vegan mayo step. Anyway great idea. Thanks!

This is an easy simple way to cook tofu. We found that we can substitute the mayo for any sauce and it works. We're loving the versatility of this recipe.

Kid approved tofu recipe. Only change was I added grated parmesan cheese and crumbled shredded Parmesan to the bread crumbs. Then at about 40 minutes, I sprinkled the cooked sticks with more shredded Parmesan and stuck them in the off oven. My kids dipped them in marinara.... so good!

Absolutely bland. The tofu absolutely needs marinade, and the coating would benefit from seasoning.

Easy to make and the breading gives it a nice crunchy texture. I used panko breadcrumbs and combined them with some grated Parmesan cheese. Even with the Parmesan, however, the flavor was very bland.  It would be worth experimenting with some herbs, spices, flavorings and sauces to improve the taste experience.

I tried it, it was easy to make, but it was disgusting, I think if the tofu was marinaded it would be a good recipe.
