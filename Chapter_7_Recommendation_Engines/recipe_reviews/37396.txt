Delicious BUT I made changes.  I made one helping following the directions meticulously.  Then I made my own variety.  I liked mine much better.  I baked it in the oven 400 degrees per inch of thickness.  The milk is unecessary.  I used seasoned crouton crumbs instead of saltines as the saltines are not flavorful enough to carry this recipe.  I added more almonds and used a dash of dried thyme in addition to the real herbs.  Scrumptious!

I am always experimenting with fish recipies and my husband particularly liked this. Plus, you can really adapt it to any white fish fillet.

My husband said, this is the best fish I've ever had -- but I altered the recipe significantly. I used Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs with Lemon Pepper seasoning instead of crackers. I used an egg-and-milk drench before dredging in the bread crumbs.I used slivered almonds pounded into smaller pieces. I did not use any tyme. And, I pan fried the trout filets. We squeezed a littel fresh lemon on each filet. Even my often picky grandchildren ate the fish and loved it.

This is really a yummy recipe. Instead of grilling the fish, I cooked it on top of the stove frying it in a bit of olive oil, just a few minutes on each side.  I used dried thyme and did not grind the almonds too fine. My daughter who normally only likes fish fried in a cornmeal batter really enjoyed the fish.

This is a great recipe, my husband loved it, too.
I also panfried the trout. I added a little spicy seasoning since we like a little zing in our foods.  Will definitely make this again.

It was OK - but seemed to be missing something.
I'm not sure that thyme was the right herb for this.  Or maybe it just needed something in addition to the thyme - just not sure what.

This tasted great!  I also varied it a somewhat.  I used dried thyme and breadcrumbs instead of saltines and put it on a george foreman grill and served it with lots of lemon.

I thought this was just OK.  It seemed a bit bland.
