Made this for a Father's day get together and received all positive reviews.  I didn't make any substitutions (I find it annoying when someone reviews a recipe with 10 changes - is it really still the recipe??)  Anyway, this is a delicious salad.

Amazing salad! In-law aproved too!  I use home raised bacon instead of bacon bits, though i did use the bits one time while we were camping.  The real stuff is 100000 times better.  Cant compare to real bacon vs the jarred stuff.  i usually just use 5 oz of spinach and only pour 1/2 the dressing in. but if making the full 10 oz, then you would need all the dressing. I also make the cauliflower into small pieces..like size of penny or less & toss out any of the stalk so its all just the head. easy to make ahead too. cook the bacon, store in seperate container in fridge. break apart all the cauli..put in large bowl..add the spinach. store in fridge. make the dressing in jar & add parmesan..shake & store in fridge. toast almonds, cool, store in fridge..then when dinners ready, take it all out & combine. 6 stars!!!!!!!

So fresh and tasty, similar to seven layer salad but with a healthier green.

AMAZING!! I used veganaise and stevia substitutes since i'm not supposed to eat dairy (i wanted to cheat on the parmesan cheese but couldn't do both...) and can't eat sugar right now (prediabetic). it was a delish addition to a family dinner. highly, HIGHLY recommend. i'm making this again for sure!

This was a fantastic salad.  I took it to a large family dinner and everyone raved about it.  We added a handful of craisins and seemed to add a little sweetness.

I used half the sugar but still found the dressing too sweet.  Otherwise I liked the flavor combinations...so will try again someday with even less sugar.

Loved this.  Reminded me or broccoli salad, which we usually make with raisins and red onions, the nuts and spinach with broccoli made a nice change to the dressing salad.

This turned out delicious. My not-high-on-spinach family all thought it was great.  Thanks

The best,  I used real bacon and crumbled it up.   I also used much less sugar.  I did not use the parm cheese or the cauliflower.  it was a big hit and I am making it this weekend for a college reunion.

Awesome recipe, you don't think it will be when you read, but excellent.

I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 Greek Yogart and cut the sugar back slightly.

I make this quite often for company and it is always a hit.  Wait right before serving to add the dressing (and mix up just enough) or the spinach can get soggy.  The only thing I sometimes do differently is make 2x the sauce so I have leftovers for additional salads!

Yuck!  I made this exactly as directed and I thought the dressing was heavy and gross.

I made this tonight for dinner but felt it needed a few additional spices to add more flavor, so I only gave it 4 stars. I also served it with mashed hard boiled egg and some sliced fresh mushrooms. Everyone loved this salad so I will definitely make this again!

This salad was really good, I thought of adding dried cranberries but decided against it, I did add chicken for some protein.  While I was eating it the first time I thought cheese of some kind would be nice. The second time I made it I added some crumbled Wensleydale that had cranberries in it - perfect addition.

We really liked this salad!  I did omit the cauliflower.  I also subbed 3 Splenda packets for the sugar and used real crumbled bacon.  Will definitely be making this again.
