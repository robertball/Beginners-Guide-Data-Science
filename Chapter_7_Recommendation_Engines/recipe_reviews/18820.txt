This was a great cheesy spinach in light pastry dish after following reviewers suggestions.  My changes were: didn't overdo the butter, used less than 2 tablespoon, brushed phyllo with butter , I'm thinking I will not even put butter on the bottom layer next time, it was a still a little too greasy, soggy for me (on the bottom (no one else complained),layered dough in between, didn't put spinach mixture to the edge of the dough so the browning was beautiful, used 3 cloves of sauteed minced garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, DID NOT use the processed cheese, yuck, only used 2 cups of mozzarella, and only used 8 oz of feta, 4 oz regular, and 4 oz low-fat feta to cut the calories, like you care at this point LOL.  Served at a large family gathering and young and old raved. Several family members took the measly leftovers home and had them for lunch the next day. 2 e-mails to me the next day were similiar- they had to guard their lunches from co-workers. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is easy and FABULOUS!  I cook for groups, and tried this on a group of twenty eight folks.  The recipe multiplied nicely, too.  I multiplied it to show for feeding 32, and made two large casseroles in my corningware casserole cooking pans.  It was all eaten except for two small pieces!  The only thing I did different than the original recipe is that I exchanged the process cheese food for the real medium cheddar cheese, per a suggestion from another reader.  The feta cheese amount is just right, and the whole thing got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  This is an attractive dish.  Also, since I made it the night before our big luncheon, I just want to say it re-heats nicely without too much problem with the philo dough. So when I cooked it, I cooled it down, then covered it with foil then refridgerated it overnight.  I took it out of the 'fridge in the morning about two hours before I had to reheat it so it would come to room temperature. I turned the oven onto the same as the cooking temp (425 degrees) though a lower temp could easily be used.  I warmed it up for fifteen minutes or so.  Advice on reheating:  keep an eye on it as it is cooking - the philo dough got a little brown around the edges, but turned out just fine.

Yeah!  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic instead of using garlic powder, did NOT use the processed cheese and made a couple layers of spinach instead of just one.  I also used 20 oz of fresh spinach instead of frozen, an italian cheese mix instead of just mozzarella, and an egg wash in-between layers instead of butter.  In fact, I did not use any butter what-so-ever.  As for the phyllo, I wound up using half of a 16 oz package, randomly laying down layers, about 4 to 6 per layer.  And I have learned that phyllo can be very forgiving, so do not worry about small tears.  In the end, no one will notice, nor will they care since this is soooooo good!

Great recipe.  Delete the processed cheese in fact you can combine and add any cheeses that you like in this recipe and will still have a great dish.  Suggest spraying a butter flavored cooking spray instead of butter on the phyllo dough.  You will not be able to tell the difference and you will save alot of calories!  I use this recipe all of the time now and continue to get raves.  My family will ask me to bring this dish to all family gatherings!

I have to say, I wasn't thinking that this would be as good as it was. This was SO good. I used Munster cheese in place of the cheese product. I also sauteed a little bit of fresh garlic and onion with olive oil, mixed that up with the spinach and then added it to the rest of the cheese. I used a LOT of dough. Layers and layers, upon layers. Used NO butter. Lightly coated each layer of dough with egg. Put 5 layers on the bottom, a bunch of the mixture, 5 more layers, some mixture, a few more layers, some mixture, and 5 on top. 
YUM!! Will make again.

This was quite good but I did change it a bit.  The recipe is unclear re how much phyllo to use.  It says 16 oz but then refers to 5 layers.  There are 40 sheets in 16 oz.  I used 8 oz (1 roll) with 10 sheets on top and 10 on the bottom.  I substituted greek yogurt for the cheese spread, ricotto would work fine too. As suggested, I used fresh garlic (3 cloves) and 1/4 cup butter.  With those changes, it got rave reviews from both vegetarians and nonvegetarians.

To make this dish actually edible, try cutting the butter out of the recipe.  My husband and I ate two bites each, then just about threw up.  Thing is, I halved the butter called for and this dish was still swimming when pulled out of the oven.  I suggest trying the recipe without the butter (except for the small amount you put on top, just before going into the oven).  This will cut down on the amount of fat by a tonne.  Toodle-loo.    -Tanstar

This was VERY tasty. However not what I would consider a casserole. I recommend adding more layers of phyllo dough to the bottom and layering it inbetween the spinach. That would tone down the cheese and make it more substansial as a stand alone dish. This would also make a very good dip! It tasted great with some chips. I'm sure with the right bread it would be great too. We also took the butter down a  notch and it tasted fine. Great recipe thanks so much for sharing!

There was way too much butter!  I had to throw it away because no one would eat the greasy mess.  My advice is to definitely halve the butter!

We used this as a side dish and thought it was fabulous! I did add an extra layer of Phyllo in the middle and only 1/2 cup of butter, but otherwise followed the recipe as it's written. The spinach mixture would be great to use with pasta too!

We really liked this recipe - great flavor! I did take some advice from a few other posters and omitted the butter all together. I also doctored it a bit - I added shredded rotissery chicken, fresh garlic and gently sauteed onions. I used the feta and a jack cheddar mix of shredded cheese. I used a bag of fresh baby spinach and just aded it to the sauteed onions after they were done along with all the other ingredients. Instead of using butter between the phyllo I used butter flavored pam spray and on top didn't use any butter as well - just sprinkled a little of the shredded cheese and it came out nice and crunchy on top!

This was really good, but I am really glad that I halved the amount of better. I used 1/4 cup butter in the spinach mix and only about a tablespoon or 2 on top. On the layers, I used a few sprits of butter spray. I started off using 8 sheets of dough per layer, but then I got worried about started using 4. I wish that I had used the whole package of dough! It looks like too much dough, but it's not! I also used mild cheddar instead of "cheese food" (I don't know what that even is). Good recipe! I'd make it again!

I'm giving 4 stars b/c like others, I made some changes. Here they are: to the spinach/cheese mix add 3 cloves garlic and 1 onion sauteed in olive oil. Skip the processed cheese and do 3 c. mozz instead. Use 1/2 c. butter TOTAL! That includes brushing the melted butter on the layers of phyllo. Hope you like the changes!! We sure did!

Use 3 (10oz) pkgs. of frozen spinach.  Replace velveeta with Muenster, layer spinach with phyllo dough several times (kind of like lasagne), use only a few tablespoons of butter to brush the phyllo dough with lightly, chop some 1 onion and 3 cloves garlic to add to the spinach.  Omit garlic powder.

Delicious!  I used fresh spinach, rinsed them and hand dried.  I also, use extra mozzarella and cheddar to compensate for the processed cheese.  It was a HIT!

Loved the layered texture of the dish, but the vinegar was too much, it made the dish taste sour. We will try this recipe again minus the vinegar.

Delicious. I skipped the processed cheese, but otherwise followed ingredients exactly. I did several sheets of phyllo, some filling, some more phyllo, then more filling and then topped with phyllo. Next time I will sautee the garlic as other reviewers suggested, but it was quite good with just the garlic powder (and faster that way!)

This has become one of my most frequented recipes, with a few major modifications. First, I only use about 1/4 cup of the butter, and you can cut it down further to make this dish a bit healthier. I also cut out the processed cheese food and add in 1 cup of mixed cheddar cheese blend. I also add in some minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder and 1/2 white onion. Delicious, and I use a bit of cooking spray on the top layer only to prevent burning. Works like a charm every time, and I always get recipe requests for this casserole!

It is very good as a side dish but very rich. I added ham cube, mushrooms and a little chili peppers. The recipe could easily be cut in half for 2 people and should be baked in a shallow casserole dish.

My boyfriend and I thought that this was delicious!  I added some chicken to the recipe, and used light cream cheese, reduced fat Velveeta,  and 2% milk mozzarella cheese.  I was a bit unsure of what "layer" of phylo meant (for the bottom of the casserole).  So, I put about six sheets on the bottom, added some mix, put another six sheets of phylo, added more mix, and then put the remaining sheets of phylo on top.  So good!  We felt that the chicken was a nice addition, too.

I ommitted the butter completely and used montery jack instead of mozzarella, and shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese.  Also fried a few cloves minced garlic and sm. amount of onion and added to the mixture. Squeeze as much water as possible out of the spinach. I brushed the phyllo with 2 eggs and 2 T. melted butter mixture.  Not a drop of grease when it came out of the oven! This was Fabulous and easily the favorite dish amongst our Greek feast! My Dad said it was better than any he had in fine Greek restaurants. Will definitely make this a regular dish.

Following other reviewers' suggestions, I omitted the processed cheese and was liberal with the feta. I was a little nervous making this for the first time since I've never worked with phyllo before, but using butter-flavoured cooking spray made it quick and easy. I brought it to a potluck with three different kinds of lasagna and it still stood out, drawing compliments from everyone.

The pack of phyllo I thought I had turned out to be puff pastry so I substituted and used Wanton wrappers instead.  I find feta very salt so used cottage cheese and mature cheddar with the mozzarella, it worked out very well.  The only butter I added was to moisten the sheets of pastry.  I also omitted the vinegar.

Very good.  I used havarti instead of processed cheese.  I also used very little of the butter and opted for the butter spray.  Delicious.

My family loved this dish!  Due to the fact that we could not find phyllo dough in our local supermarket, we used flattened crescent rolls instead.  It worked out wonderfully.  Thank you!!!!

I really didn't like this recipe.  Maybe it just needed more cheese.  My daughter loves it, however, and wants me to  make it again.  I am sure she would give it 5 stars.

This was AMAZING. Made a whole 9x13 pan for my poor student self and it was a great dinner on Tuesday and an even better lunch on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (and a midnight snack somewhere in there too, I think). I made a lot of changes, so I'm only giving the recipe four stars, but this is a great dish to tweak to your own tastes. 

I omitted the butter completely (although I probably should have actually put some on the phyllo dough... I've never used phyllo before and it turned out kind of weird, and I think that might be why... probably didn't help that I was too hungry to thaw it all the way, um.) as well as the processed cheese. Instead, I threw the rest of my dill goat cheese and some greek yogurt and dill veggie dip that was in my fridge in with the spinach mixture.

Turned out completely amazing... will probably find its way into my monthly rotation of week-long meals :P

Great base recipe. I made a few additions/changes so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder), 1 small white onion, 3.5 oz of sundried tomatoes, and 8 oz baby bella mushrooms, as well as ricotta cheese to the mix.  Instead of the cubed processed cheese, I used a cheddar blend. I didn't use any butter at all, and used some butter-flavored cooking spray on the bottom and top layers, along with some EVOO in between. I will make this again, and might try using the spinach/cheese mixture as a dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a light version of this dish - using light cheese and only 2 tbsp of margarine.  The taste was great.  I struggled a bit w/ seperating the phyllo dough but turned out nicely.  I agree - I'd serve as a side dish in the future - the taste became a bit overwhelming.

The spinach portion of this recipe is very good, but very rich.  I found the pastry with the filling was too rich, but was very tasty.

Hi. I followed many of the suggestions. I used only 2 tbls. of butter, did not put any on bottom layer. I put 2 layers of phyllo on bottom and left some room around the edges when spreading spinach mixture. I did not use processed cheese. I used only 6 ounces of feta. I didn't have quite 2 cups of mozzarella, so I added a handful of shredded cheddar. Turned out great! Although my husband thought it was a better side dish and not a main dish.

This is terrific, but I used about 20% less cheese (all types) and about half the butter in the recipe.  Lower calories and still great taste!

i liked this recipe but i also followed the idea to only use half the butter.  i would not use it for a main dish because it is so rich.  i also used jack cheese instead of processed cheese food.  sounded scary.  i would make it again.

With a few alterations for a low fat recipe, This was a tasty change ordinary casseroles. If you like that spinach/artichoke dip from a "famous" restraunt, you will like this.
I only used 1/2 roll of the phylo dough and low fat cheeses. Additionally I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and used cooking spray for the top. My husband used fresh salsa as a topping.

This recipe would have been much better without the Feta cheese. It is quite salty. I would add more mozzarella and some mushrooms if I made it again. The hubby liked it, but the other four critics got it a two star rating.

I liked what I made after seeing this recipe and making changes after reading reviews, but what I made bares little resemblance to the original recipe and the couple complaints I have would just be compounded if I had followed the original, hence the poor rating I give this recipe. I halved the recipe, substituted Italian cheese mix for the mozzarella and processed cheese, sauteed a couple cloves of garlic in a small amount of butter instead of using garlic powdered did not put any butter in the spinach mixture only used a little melted butter on the phyllo dough and only used about half of the phyllo dough. I used two or three pieces of phyllo dough per layer and made three layers of dough with two layers of spinach mixture.  The end result is very heavy even after only using a small amount, maybe 2 Tbsp, of butter and a reduced fat cheese. It is also not very filling; as a main dish and my boyfriend and I ended up eating the entire thing instead of stretching it out for two meals like I was expecting. I imagine using a full cup of butter only adds to the heaviness and does nothing to make the recipe more filling. Overall, I like the idea of spinach casserole but will keep looking for a recipe that better fits my needs.

While this dish was tasty, to call it Spinach Casserole is probably unintentionally misleading. I don't see how anyone could eat this as a meal.  It's perfect as an appetizer or to serve as a dish with other choices, but I used it as an addition to a meal. As one of the other reviewers suggested, I used fresh spinach with Havarti cheese and mozzarella. I made this recipe twice, once with garlic and once without because I can't eat garlic. It was great both times.  All said, it was very good and I'd used this recipe again only as a side dish, not a main course.

Glad I took the advice of others and did not use but only 1/4 c of melted butter and next time will not put any on the top part because it just sat there like one big puddle so I ended up dabbing with paper towel and cooked 5 min longer. Really nice recipe, I will make again.

Love this recipe.  I served along with a shoulder of lamb with a greek flair.  My company loved it.  However, I did not want to use spinach sine it was in my lamb recipe.  So, I substituted chopped broccoli and cauliflower.  Just as good.  This is definately a keeper

This recipe is delicious. I used fresh spinach which works wonderfully. I found it necessary to dry the spinach as much as possible to avoid too much liquid at the bottom of the dish. I used grated old cheddar in place of the processed cheese. The flavors of the three cheeses is fabulous. In the future I'll omit the phyllo pastry on the bottom because it's just not necessary. I loved the contrast between the thin crispy phyllo pastry top and the spinach-cheese mixture. Used 1/4 cup unsalted butter for 4 servings and it was yummy. Next time I'll probably reduce the amount of butter to save calories. The recipe is a real winner and I'll serve it proudly many times in the future.

It seemed like it had potential... unfortunatly, I did not read the reviews before I made the recipe and used 1 cup of butter.  It was WAY too much!  My husband and I could only take about two bites and then we threw the rest away.  The spinach and cheese were good, though (and we even used the processed cheese food).  So I think we may try it again (in a month or so after our arteries recover from all the butter) with 2tbsp butter.

I have made this multipile times and bring it to all group events to I go to. It's a great family dish or potluck dish. It's a wonderful conmination of spinach, cheese, spices and phyllo dough. The end result is  a wonderful crowd and taste-bud pleaser

This was an awesome recipe.  I will definatley make it again and again.  I made it for Christmas dinner and it was gone.  Everyone loved it.  I didnt look at reviews before making this one and I will try using a little less butter next time.

This was very good.  I looked it up when trying to find something easy to make for a vegetarian dinner guest.  I would agree with reducing the butter.
