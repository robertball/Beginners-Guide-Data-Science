This is my husband's favorite, and I love it, too. My friend gave me the recipe but didn't know exact measurements. I'm so glad it was on here!  I've seen reviews where the mayo was overpowering. I've found that if I don't make it 6 hours ahead of time and refrigerate, the mayo does overpower. It needs to sit in the fridge for several hours to let the flavors combine. Our favorite thing to eat with it is Frito Scoops. YUM!

This receipe is a great way to have kids and adults eat their vegetables.  I made this for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  I served with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery.  EXTREMELY EASY TO MAKE - will make again!

I have been searching for this recipe, I have had it at parties but when I've asked for the recipe no one can ever give it to me because they've been making it for so long that they do it from memory but can't really tell me how. Thank you so much. I made this for a party and everyone loved it! It's also good with pretzel rods.

I also decreased the mayo to 1/2 cup and then substituted 1 & 1/2 cups of plain yogurt for the remainder.  It needed to chill for about 24 hours until the full flavor was to be truly appreciated.

The Firt day I gave this a 3-4, but after 2 days tried it again and the flavors were well blended and it became a "5".  I had several dips, and this one was the favorite of many.  I used it as a sandwich spread on hoagies, Wow is all I can say.  I did make a few changes, I used a blend of Italien cheeses and added some fresh garlic

I served this recipe (made with half the mayo as suggested) at a party and people ate it but I had a lot left over.  I used the advice as a sandwich spread and that was OK too, but what made this a recipe that I'll make again is that I took what I had left, spread it on some sliced Tuscan bread and baked it on 400 for about 10-15 minutes.  The combination of creamy and gooey was delicious.

Had to exclude mayo and sugar. And try to add white pepper and fresh basil and you'll have very "italiano" taste :)

This recipe made a good dip, but the leftovers were also fabulous as a sandwich spread with sliced turkey and lettuce on whole wheat.

After reading the other reviews I halved the mayo. It STILL tasted mostly like mayonaise and I wasn't impressed with it as a dip. I'm giving it 3 stars because it works okay as a spread for a grilled sandwich when the mozzarella is melty.

A rather 'heavy' dip, but interesting flavor.  Good if you want something a little 'different'.

It was pretty good, a little bit bland though. Not too appealing to look at. Best with plain ridged potato chips in my opinion.

This dip is delicious! I went a little heavy on the garlic on accident, and it was FANTASTIC! (I love garlic) I also left it overnight in the fridge & it was perfect!

I added a can of cream of celery soup for a little extra flavor and used it with chips and veggies. Pretty good, but I took it to a party and although it got a compliment it was not all eaten.

Don't waste your time with this dip. Mayo overpowers the taste-I doubled, even tripled some of the other ingredients and still couldn't  minimize the mayo flavor.  Sorry, but this is definitely NOT a keeper.

Really good stuff! I agree with the other reviewers who said that it tastes better a couple of days after you make it. It didn't have a lot of flavor after 12 hours and still wasn't much better after 24 hours but the second day holy cow! DELISH! I did use a good freshly grated mix of parm and asagio just because I had them on hand and need to use them up. I didn't much care for it with chips but its awesome with celery!

I love this dip and I think it's very versatile. As with any recipe, I always tweak it. I usually do one part mayo and one part sour cream (this might help for people who think the mayo is overpowering). I've used chopped onions but also tried it with minced dried onions. Tried real garlic instead of garlic salt; and with different cheeses (cheddar, monterey jack, etc.). It's good with dill as well. And adding chopped crispy bacon makes it awesome! Just make sure to let it rest long enough for the flavours to come through. Lots of possibilies... all yummy!

Tasted like dipping your chips into a jar of mayo, and that was after I added more mozzarella and parmesan. If you make this, cut way back on the mayo.

I had to make some changes for my family to eat it, I used greek yoguart instead of the mayo, removed the sugar, used homemade taco seasoning instead of the other seasoning. Lower sugar content and lower in sodium.

This was great! I did make a few changes. I added extra cheese (probably 1/4 c. Parmesan and 1.5 c. Mozzarella) and cut the mayo down to 3/4 c. I also added a little extra garlic powder (not garlic salt) because I'm a fan. Tastes better with time! Thanks!!

This dip was a great hit at our family party!!! I made it as written, but added 2 additional tablespoons of Parmesan cheese per my husband's request.  Many complements and recipe requests!  Nancy O

I thought this was bland.  No one complained about it, but no one raved about it either.  It's a good base, but it definitely needs something more.

Everyone hovers around this dip!! It's delicious!!! I usually end up adding more salt and garlic to taste.

I thought the mayonnaise overpowered any flavor in this dip.  I wasn't too crazy about it served with tortilla chips but was much better with vegetables.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Wasn't a big hit at our office party.  Probably won't make again.
