Just served this at my mother's 80th birthday party and then again at a bridal shower.  I floated frozen citrus slices on top and made ice cubes from each the juices, so as they melted, the punch was not diluted.  It was a hit at both parties!

Excellent punch ... I suggest you use top quality brands when purchasing the fruit juices ... I also used sparkling lemonade ... added that extra "punch" ...  used this at a church Christmas cantata ... lovely red colour, excellent taste ... to make it extra special, I'd add some orange slices ... also good idea to add a bag of ice ... you won't be disappointed in this recipe!

Made this for a work event & it was such a hit. I read some of the other reviews beforehand and I changed it up based on their recommendations. I did double the amount of ginger ale & used sparkling lemonade instead of the regular version. I also added some raspberry sherbert to make it more 'foamy' & made an ice-ring out of orange juice & orange slices so that it would become watered down. All of these changes made it absolute perfection!

To me, this punch turned out more like a fruity drink. It didn't taste like punch.It tasted great, just not like a punch. The ammount of ginger alle it called for wasn't enough. I say to double it.

This is a very easy and delicious party punch. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! I did not add the lemonade but still thought it was very good. Although I am not a fan of fruit punch at all, I know I will be using this recipe again! Thanks!

This is a tart punch that is tasty, but not my favorite.  Easy to make (simple proportions) and less expensive than some others.

Wonderful Punch!!! Very flavorful with the right amount of Sweet. I only needed a small amount so I just used 2 cups of each juice.

The best part about this recipe is that it is very easy and it tasted great.  I think trying the sparkling lemonade would be good as someone else suggested.

Doubled the ginger ale as others suggested. Pretty good punch, but the lack of sherbet makes this a bit less festive than what I was looking for.

Quick and easy! I made it to serve as a refreshing summer drink with our Fathers Day grill. I added my favorite ginger ale, Vernors, and it turned out great!

Delicious. My Parents gave it a 4 1/2 and a 5. I gave it a five. Not too sweet, ginger ale gives it a small kick, and it gives you 2 servings of fruit. A must have

I made it with the original ratios, but I made the ice ring out of orange juice and added the orange slices, then added raspberry sherbet. Everyone raves over it every time I make it!

Used frozen strawberries as ice- added to the flavor as they melted and they were delicious.
