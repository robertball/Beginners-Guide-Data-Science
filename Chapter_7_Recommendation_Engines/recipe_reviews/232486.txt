I made this as stated except I used 2 cups apple juice and 2 cups water.  I used 2 really large Fuji apples instead of the 3 listed in the recipe, and I added a teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  In my opinion this turned out way too soupy, next time I will reduce the amount of liquid to 3 cups (1/2 water & 1/2 apple juice) instead of the 4 cups of liquid stated in the recipe.  The flavor was very good; I don't think I will add the brown sugar next time either, I think the apple juice will give it enough sweetness.  I wanted it on the sweet side this first time to ensure my kids would eat it but next time I will leave out the addtional sugar.  They can always top it with some brown sugar or maple syrup when they eat it.  Plus the extra sugar made my blood sugar spike and I got real jittery mid-morning, nixing the sugar next time.  I sprayed my crockpot with cooking spray and had just a bit of sticking to contend with but nothing major, I had good results with this; will make again with a few tweeks.

Just because it has apples doesn't mean that it will taste like apple pie! I figure that this should probably serve 6, not 12!  This tastes good, and has lots of possibilities for additional flavors such as sweeteners or additional fruit.  This can easily be made on top of the stove!

This is a great recipe- only with 2 Cups of water instead of 3.. or leave out the apple juice if you want less sugar. We like to top it with brown sugar or maple syrup when serving. Also like it with raisins, pecans or walnuts. Agree that it doesn't make 12 servings. More like 6 to 8.

Okay, first off; it needed a LOT more cinnamon, I would suggest 2 1/8 TSP. and it needed a sweetener as well. I added less than a half a packet and it was perfect. A difficulty is the four hour period. The oatmeal thickens too quick it seems, while the apples stay crunchy, which explains the time period, but still.

I made the recipe with sugar free apple juice because my husband is a diabetic.  He liked this batch very much.

I made it and added raisins for more sweetness. I used unsweetened Apple juice as part of my diet and felt the raisins gave it that added but of sweetness without adding any sugars. Yum!

Made a few changes, since I was using a Zojirushi rice cooker.

I used 1/2c of almond milk, 1c of unsweetened apple juice and 1 3/4 cups of water, with three Granny Smith apples, cored, chopped up, and placed on top of the steel-cut oats mix.  I also used a tablespoon of cinnamon.

Set the Zojirushi cooker on porridge and set the timer, for when you wake-up.  If the mixture is too thick, thin it, with additional almond milk.  There is enough, for three to four portions, depending on one's personal consumption.

This is the best oatmeal I ever have had.  My seven year-old son, thought it wasn't his cup of tea.

Don't know what others did but I left mine for 7 hours and I stirred and still didn't burn to the crockpot.  I wish I had stirred it at least twice to help the oats out but they are crunchy and it does taste like apple pie without the crust.   Will try maple syrup but is already super sweet.  I used sweet soft apples though.

Quite disappointed.  Might try this again in the future with some tweaks.  Too watery, and completely burned to the crockpot sides.
