Very, very tasty. I added a little nutmeg in with the cinnamon. My kids couldn't get enough of it! EDITED: I now make this with either homemade pumpkin pie spice or homemade apple pie spice. This is one of my kids' favorite snacks.

Delicious easy and a great way to use up pretzels!  I made them with Splenda and they came out perfect.  Can't wait to take them to my next Bunco night!

This is sooo easy, tasty and inexpensive to make (especially in bulk quantities for gifting) To keep the sugar/spice and oil mixture from burning the pretzels I covered the bowl with a plastic microwave spatter cover and stirred every minute...mine only required 3 -4 minutes total.  (I used a plastic bowl and a wooden spoon...might make a difference )Cooled on cookie sheets and placed in gift tins. This recipe could easily be changed to use most any spices and seasonings from sweet to spicy...I added 1/2 tsp Apple pie spice HUGE hit!!!

I have been making these for several years now. Often! Family and coworkers can't get enough of them. How funny to read all my same sentiments in the reviews. I, too, make them for bake sales and gifts, and they are also known as MY famous pretzels. And just like everyone else, I don't want anyone knowing how easy they are to make! I've used nuggets and have found that the cheaper they are, the better they taste. I think they're not as dense and soak up the flavor more. Twists work just as well, and may even be tastier, but I cut the last minute off the cooking time. Try these... they'll become YOUR famous pretzels, too!

I made these before and forgot to save the recipe. Sooo DELIC!  I added about double the cinnamon. Great part is good for snack or dessert.  Make them and people will ask you to make again and again.

These were fantastic and so easy to make!  I added extra cinnamon as other reviewers suggested.  I couldn't stop eating them and my guests loved them too - they were gone by the end of the night.

These pretzels are yummy and super easy to make.  Great for bagging up in holiday bags for gift giving, especially when you have lots of people to give to!  Great, non-budget busting way to go!

Delicious! I've always loved cinnamon/sugar coated anything but never thought of using pretzels. I used a little extra sugar and cinnamon to taste for mine... I doubt they last the rest of the day they're so good! Thanks for sharing

Made these with pretzel twists, added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, but thought it could have used even more.

Wow! These are great!  I was skeptical about making these in the microwave but they turned out just fine...and in less time then the recipe states.  I've made these many times and they are usually done in my 1100 watt microwave on 70% power after just 4 minutes.  

I've also added more cinnamon...cut back on the oil and subbed Splenda for the sugar....and they have always turned out great!

In the ones that I'm eating right now I used confectioners sugar instead of granualeted regular sugar and they turned out really great too!

This is a nice combo of salty and sweet.  I used pretzel rods because they were much cheaper than then nuggets.  Just broke them into pieces.  I only needed to microwave about 3 minutes total for the oil to all soak in, however, the cinnamon and sugar did not stick that well to the pretzels.  I was left with a bunch in the bowl.  Other than that, these worked nicely.

I made this sweet treat for card club and everyone loved them.  A little messy to eat while playing cards, but enjoyed non-the-less.  I made as written, and they went over so well, I will do exactly the same next time.  This would make a nice treat to put in individual gift bags.

Even though it's been rated plenty of times, I had to add my two cents.  Yummy, yummy, yummy, and dirt-simple to make!  These are almost too delicious because I can't stop eating them!  The only difference I made was to add 2 tsp. cinnamon instead of 1 1/2, just because I didn't want to use two measuring spoons and I love cinnamon.

Be careful if you have a powerful microwave; my first batch turned to charcoal.  The second batch was better.  Pretty tasty little snack.

I made a half recipe because I just knew that they would be addictive......Used round sesame whole wheat pretzels and added a pinch of cardamon which adds a mystery ingredient.  Will be making again for the next event.  I like the idea of adding
nuts.  You could add a little hot to it by adding a 
pinch of red pepper.  You are only limited by your imagination.

I made these at the last minute to add to cookie baskets. I was so disappointed. All of the pretzels on the bottom burned. I'm not sure what I did wrong; I stirred them and only nuked for 6 minutes total. I used regular pretzel twists instead - maybe that's why?

If you like for your snack to have the contrast of salty with sweet then this is a good recipe.  I love cinnamon sugar so I decided to give this a try and overall I wasn't disappointed.      Because microwave temps do vary make sure you keep a close eye on the preztels as they cook so they don't burn.

Easy, fast way to dress up some plain old pretzels!  I'm sure any pretzel shape would work just fine but I bought pretzel nuggets just to try this recipe & I love them!  These will be one of the goodies in my Christmas bags this year.  Thank you!!

I've used the recipe a number of times for school bake sales. After they are completely cool, I spoon some in small clear bags and tie the bags with a ribbon. They have been a huge hit. I add a little more cinnamon.

This recipe has been a huge success for me!  I have made these for bake sales & Christmas presents!  I call them my "secret pretzel recipe!"  I was actually a little sad to see this recipe on the "daily" recipes, because I don't want anyone to find out how easy they are to make! LOL!
