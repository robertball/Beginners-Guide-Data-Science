Last time I made a cucumber salad I ruined it. So I wanted a recipe that rated well. I made this for a small gathering on our boat for Independence Day fireworks. We grilled steak and cooked corn on the cobb. (Not much room to cook anything else on a boat, so this was a great make ahead side salad. It was a big hit. I did alter the recipe only slightly. I used 1/4 red onion, very thinly sliced instead of the chopped onion. I did leave out the celery seed (I didn't have it) and added fresh, chopped parsley. Fabulous! Thanks Karen.

This cucumber salad is better than what I remember my grandmother making!  I did substitute the distilled white vinegar with white wine vinegar -- it made for a little bit more mellow and sweeter marinade.

This sounded like a good salad to go along with my turkey and trimmings. I regret to say, but I can't give it more than two stars. Will not make it again.

I have always made my grandmother's recipe, very similar to this.  I use garlic rather than onion and sprinkle with dill weed.

I really love cucumber salad and this one is very good. I usually skip adding water and don't bother sqeezing out any water after the cuke's have been salted. Occasionally will add sour cream later but there's usually none left to add it to.

tasty!!  I have two words for all of you though, salad spinner!  Slice your cucumbers and toss with salt and then let sit in the the spinner for awhile, give it few turns and away you go.  I added a little dill, and a splash of white wine, and then cooked the vinegar solution for a bit, gives it an interesting flavor.

Wonderful! I used English cucumbers (so much nicer than those nasty waxy ones with the tough pips), and used a vegetable peeler to slice off strips of peel. I substituted toasted sesame seeds for the celery seed as I don't like them. This tasted just like the cucumber salad at a local sushi bar! Thank you!

What a refreshing salad!  I took it to a potluck and got lots of complements. I did slice the onions and add thinly sliced tomatoes for color.

I had some cucumbers I was looking to use and came across this recipe. I liked the recipe. I changed it just a little.  I had used rice vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar and I added some chopped tomatoes for color. The tomatoes really did not add much in the way of flavor. Overall I thought that it was good but it did taste quite a bit like sweet pickles. I followed other reviews that mentioned adding a dab of sour cream and that perfected it in my opinion.  I will be making this again and I will always make sure I add a dab of sour cream.

Exactly what I needed!  I had everything on hand and I needed a last minute side dish for a picnic.  Very yummy and light.  I didn't understand why i would drain the cucumber juice only to add in water??  So I skipped the draining and skipped the water.  Turned out great!

Excellent! Try different types of vinegars, like cider vinegar for a fuller taste.

YUMMY! I tried it before it was chilled and it was good. I tried it again after it chilled for an hour, it was even better. I used Splenda instead of the sugar, slice the onions in half-moon slices  and added chopped tomatoes and the only salt I used was celery salt and no water. To make a presentation I used a veggie peeler to take thin  slices of peel off and then ran the tines of a fork down the side of cucmber to make a design; looks great when sliced. Will try with Apple-Cider vinegar next time.

Didn't peel the cukes or use onion.  Put all in a jar in the fridge and let it set.  Great after a few days, better after a week.  Have been just adding more of everything to the jar as we eat it (and as we pick the huge volume of cukes from the garden).  Great as a side or on a sandwich.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe that reminds me of all the holiday dinners we had growing up.  I left out the celery seed and didn't miss it a bit.  Very quick and easy to make.

These were simple and delicious. Someone gave us a bunch of long thin cukes out of their garden and I needed to find a way to use them. This recipe did the trick. Very similar to a bread and butter pickle taste.

I wrote a review for this a few years ago and since then have tweaked this dish.  I feel water is unnecessary and "chopped" onion is too much for this refreshing salad.  I use 1/4 of a red onion instead and slice it into paper thin slices.  The red onion adds color, but also slicing it paper thin allows you to avoid big chunks of onion if you want to.  I don't always use the celery seed and it still tastes great!

Another tip, prepare this an hour or two ahead of serving time and keep in the fridge to allow the dish to marinate and chill. 

* Also, I'm a big fan of Whole Foods cucumber salad which is very similar, except they use honey as the sweetener.  I've started using 1-2 Tbls of honey instead of the white sugar.

Love this one and it gets better the 2nd and 3rd day if you get it to last that long.  Make sure after you slice and lightly salt them you let them set out at least 1/2 hr on a paper towel and then pat dry. I didn't add the extra water since I knew the cucumbers would still give off water after being in the dish.

A TWIST WE ADD:  we slice the onions into rings, add bell pepper slices, and quarter tomatoes to the cucumbers.  Very tasty though leftovers become a bit soggy the next day.  So we make just enough for each meal we are serving it for.  JUST A SIDENOTE.

Figured I should come and give this a review since i've made it 3 or 4 times now.  Each time, everyone gobbles it up and raves about it and asks for the recipe.  I use a combo of armenian cucumbers and regular dark green ones, all from my garden, which is producing an abundance of cucumbers right now.  Excellent recipe!

Sorry but it is just missing something.  Have had way better before.  I ate the ones I made but will go back to my old recipe.  Maybe another type of vinegar or less sugar would help.

Perfect balance of ingredients.  I have used many recipes, but this one is the one I have been looking for.  The kids will finally eat my cucumbers!  I didn't add the celery salt although it would probably taste good.

I usually make cucumbers with sour cream and vinegar but my dad requested a version he remembered having years ago and this seemed to fit the bill.  I was thrilled when he said it was fantastic.  W all enjoyed this recipe with our abundance of garden cucs.  Thank you!   I will for sure make it again and again.

I was looking for a cucumber recipe like my grandma used to make when I was a kid and this is it except for the celery seed and she always used little onions and sliced them  in rings. Other than that, thank you so much for this one.

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  One of my sisters-in-law makes a very similar recipe and of course never measures so I was looking for the correct proportions of sugar to vinegar. This was perfect!  Thanks so much.

Easy and delicious. A hit at our summer picnic. Used white wine vinegar for a sweet taste, and some colorful chopped sweet peppers for some color.

I used this recipe to replace a full veggie salad and save time.  It was great! I didn't have vinegar, and replaced it with the juice from a half jar of mild nacho slices, which added a spicy taste.  Then sprinkled it with a tsp of dill instead of celery seed.

I did make a few changes to this recipe and it was a big hit with everyone who tried it. I used English cucumbers and did not salt them first. I omitted the celery seeds and used 1/8 cup rice wine vinegar and 1/8 cup of white vinegar. It was very refreshing with a similar taste to a Japanese salad.

It was a little too sweet so I added more vinegar, water and celery salt ( used salt ....did not have celery seed)
Next time I will use sliced onion instead of chopped onion.....it's easier to eat.    All in  all the closest recipe to delis and 
Prepared food stores that charge a lot for this salad.  .......much better than any recipe I have tried previously..
I would definitely make it again.......my husband loved it and is always buying it at the prepared food stores....now he doesn't have to.....thanks so much for this.

This is a pretty good recipe.  The only thing is that it doesn't make enough of the liquid.  So I ended up making three times the dressing/liquid so there was enough for the cucumbers and onions to marinate in it.  I have made it with sugar and then tried it with granulated splenda (exchanged equal parts of sugar for the exact same amount of splenda) and it turned out nice both ways.  I'll definitely make this again, but will always multiply the dressing/liquid two to three times as written.

It's hilarious that I've been avoiding this recipe simply because it calls for sugar (I expected it to be sweet and I don't like sweet). Finally, however, I succumbed to this recipe and lo and behold it is the one I've been searching for for years... Although I add a bit more vinegar and water in order to make sure this isn't sweet, it's the perfect balance of tart, cool, and crisp. Thanks for teaching me a thing or two. (next time I'll add dill like another reviewer suggested, which was in the previous recipe I used).

These were fantastic - and that's a comment coming from someone who absolutely hates cucumbers! The only two things I did differently were to use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar (it's sweeter) and to use dill weed instead of celery seed. The dill was fantastic, but next time I might try the celery seed just to see what that's like. Thanks for the recipe!

I normally don't like cucumber salad, but this one was really good! I loved the addition of celery seed, very tasty. I did let it sit overnight, so mine was full of flavor.

This is excellent and so refreshing!  You could also add your chopped fresh garden tomatoes to make it even better!  You must refrigerate it for the minimum hour.  I would say to let it marinate even longer.

Just the recipe I was looking for.  Couldn't find celery seed, but it was still fine.  I added a little more vinegar, and used sliced red onions, instead of chopped - just a personal preference thing.

I thought overall the taste was pretty good, but that the dill seed was way over powering in the recipe. And, I had even cut the amount of dill seed by at least half. I might just like a more vinegar or lemon taste to pickles. I might try it again another time and then just omit the dill seed and see how that tastes.

Cut the recipe for one seedless cuke.  Didn't have salt (!!) or celery seed in the house, but somehow had celery salt.  Worked well.  Made one day in advance, and slices still had some crunch.

I wanted something alittle more healthier for my family. (Usually make with sour cream) This was good. I also sliced the onions very thin. The family liked it.  I will be making this again. As others stated, this is the way my grandma made them when I was going up.

A nice, refreshing salad.  I made this by following the recipe as it's printed and it turned out great.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c my kids didn't like it at all.  Next time I'll try it w/ some of the other suggestions and see how it turns out.

Just like my grandmother use to make.  I used a couple of giant seedless cucumbers and made double brine.  It was a little more than 2 people could eat in 4 days-- by which time the cucumbers were getting pretty limp-- BUT the first 2 days they were crisp and tasty!!!

I thought these were fantastic.  I used an English cucumber, which I recommend.  They are not waxed and you can leave the skin on.  Excellent and refreshing!

Just like I remember my mom's.  I did add a little garlic powder and a smidge of red pepper.  Perfect side dish to cool down the spicy grilled chilled we had.

Last summer I visited a couson and she served a similar dish.  I loved it and was trying to recreate that memory.  I suceeded!  This was so easy to make and very tasty.  It was a perfect match for the BBQ ribs we had for dinner. My husband wasn't as much of a fan of this dish as I was.  He is not one for vegetables though.  I will make it again it is a nice summer side dish.  Thank you Karen.

Really delicious recipe that is now my go-to for a cucumber salad recipe!  Like others suggested, I didn’t squeeze the cucumbers after the salt soak but just skipped adding additional water.  I also used white wine vinegar rather than distilled.  I also cut the sugar in half—was still plenty sweet to balance out the vinegar.

I substituted the white vinegar with white balsamic vinegar (I used Alessi brand). Very smooth and fragrant. Tweak with some extra vinegar or sugar to taste!

Had a bunch mini cucumbers that I didn't want to go to waste.  Found this recipe.  Made small salad.  Was Great.  Made another using 14 small cucumbers and tripled the dressing for a party.  Everyone loved it!  Will make again.

Delicious in a bowl!! Followed the recipe pretty much, but decided not to drain the cucumbers. As it sat it got juicier, but it didn't alter the flavor one bit. I used strips of sweet vidalia onion instead of chopped. Sweet, cool, refreshing and a great compliment to a steak!!

This is a great summer salad and my kids who usually don't eat cucumbers were asking to take some to school with their lunch. I used red onions which really added extra flavor and the colors together were just beautiful.

OK. This is a great, simple, easy recipe that I've made 3 or 4 times and it turns out the same every time! I'm grateful for that, in itself! It's a quck sort of healthy snack for me as well as something easy to grab and go as a side for my office lunches. All in all, I'll be using this recipe all summer! Thanks!!

Yummy!  I used about an 1/8 cup of agave nectar instead of the 1/4 cup sugar.  Left out the water.  Used thinly sliced red onion.  So good!

I added red onion -- quite a bit of it -- and really liked having quite a bit of onion in this. The dressing was very good after it sat for awhile though I didn't like it right at first. Thanks for sharing! EDIT 1/22/15 - Made this again and did not like the amount of sugar, far too sweet. Had to add a lot more vinegar to balance it. Not sure what my taste buds were doing originally but I'll reduce the sugar in the future.

I add tomatoes and switch the celery seed for dill weed.  It is definitely one of my favorite side dishes in the summer when fresh produce is in season.

I decreased sugar a wee bit, increased onion a wee bit as well as the celery seed. But I'm sure the recipe would be good 'as is'. 

I'm making it a second time today.

My mom makes this recipe.  Sometimes she uses white vinegar, sometimes apple cider vinegar.  She adds sugar, salt and lots of pepper.  I used to drink the juice when all the cucumbers were done!! (I still do!!)

Yum! 
I used celery salt, instead of sead, and I didn't bother squeezing the cukes, just used a little less water in the marinade. I super-thinly sliced the onion as I don't care for chunks of raw onion. I also used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have any white. Refreshing and Delicious!

Really good recipe! I'm not a fan of the vinegary taste, so I used 1/8 cup of vinegar. I also used stevia instead of sugar, and added a drained can of great northern beans and a carrot for color. Yum!

My mother used to make this when I was a kid. She would soak cucumbers about 1/16ths of an inch thick with water up to the top... I had to triple the liquid ingredients. And when you do that it will allow you to use the liquids over and over again.

These cucumbers brought me right back to grandma's table.  She served these all summer long at both lunch and dinner.  I added sliced red onion to mine.  Thanks.

Boy o boy does this bring back memories!  My mom and grandmother(who passed a couple years back) used to make this.  We have a small tight knit family all of us used to sit around eating out of the same bowl :) the longer it sits THE BETTER IT IS.  Great with or without onion try mixing other veggies (as i did when i was pregnant)

I made a half recipe of these and they were very good.  I left out the onion and decreased the celery seed slightly.  I also used rice vinegar since I did not have white vinegar, and I think it added something extra!  Great as a snack on a hot summer day.

Meh - I thought this was pretty average. It is a nice refreshing side, but I’d probably just eat sliced and salted cucumbers over this.

Easy and simple recipe. Especially good with fresh cukes from my garden. I followed other reviewer's recs and used Rice Vinegar and 2 tbs of honey. I didn't have celery seed, so I used dill weed (my grandma used fresh dill in hers). Tasted before chilling and it light and fresh. Will chill for several hours before serving. This one is a keeper and a winner. Thanks for the recipe Karen.

Tastes like the cucumber salad my Dutch mom always made. I didn’t put in the onions because my mother never did. Used 3 cukes out of the garden. After slicing with the mandolin sprinkled with salt and let sit for about half an hour before pouring off the excess juice. Didn’t need any water. Used half red wine vinegar and half white vinegar. Added some pepper because we like pepper. Perfection!

Well, it all started yesterday when I took a bath and decided to weigh myself. To my amazement I found that I had lost ten pounds! That evening I attended a party and found myself only eating salads, fruit and pulled pork, but most especially, cucumber salad. I must have eaten a quart of the stuff. With my wife out of town, I can eat anything I want so I whipped up a batch from this recipe. I made a couple of small changes: since I found it a bit too sweet, I added one more tablespoon of vinegar. In addition I added one half tsp black pepper, hmm not quite enough, so about a one third tsp more. Finally, I added one quarter cup olive oil. My wife won't like it, but that's more for me. I'll be eating this tonight with grilled lamb, she doesn't like lamb either. Her loss.

The first time I made these I used very little sugar but still it was too sweet. The second time I left out the sugar & I used apple cider vinegar.  Loved them!!

8.16.18  It's Florida, it's summer, it's HOT, I spent half a day doing yard work, and this little cucumber salad is the perfect sidekick for a simple evening BBQ,  Only change I made was cutting back the sugar a bit, and that's nothing more than personal taste preference.

I made this TODAY to take to a picnic. I didn't follow the instructions as I had only 1 large cucumber & a candy cane onion (Amish). I threw all ingredients together (no measuring just eye balled) but ADDED a little mayonnaise & used celery flakes as I HATE celery seeds!. I watched as people fixed their plates & it was gone before I knew it. It was very good & the flavor combo is RIGHT on ESPECIALLY with the mayo. Will make this a staple from now on. BTW, I also added a "pinch" of cayenne pepper for a little "kick".

Easy  and delicious. If you have a mandolin you can make this in less than 10 minutes.  I skipped the step about salting  and drying the cucumbers. Instead I omitted the water and added the salt to the dressing.  Also, I thin sliced red onion on the mandolin instead of chopping with a knife.

Easy recipe that is a good way to use cukes.  Can stay out a while (advantage with no mayo) and compliments grilled meals on hot days.  
I used dill seeds instead of celery seeds, it was all I had.

I made this to take to a BBQ and it was a huge hit.  I used the mini cucumbers and sliced them super thin on a food mandolin. I used white onion and also sliced it on the food mandolin.  Several people sought me out to compliment the dish.  Great recipe.  So easy too.

Very good recipe! No need to alter but you certainly can add tomatoes if you choose, skip the celery seeds, skip draining the water. As you wish, it's all good and unless you don't like a cucumber salad, don't rate it, it's a keeper, and I can't understand anyone rating it less than a four. Thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for.  Tastes great just enough contrast between the vinegar and the sugar.  Great alternative to the creamy cucumber salad.  Used as a side salad for dinner. Was a hit!!  I had no leftovers.

So easy and tastes great.  I didn't do the salt trick to remove excess water, and I didn't have celery seed.  I used some celery salt and this was wonderful.  Will make again.

This is my FAVORITE way to eat summer cucumbers.  My grandma made them every summer as does my mom, now.  I love this recipe best as there is no dill in the mixture.  I made a huge batch and have enjoyed them every day in my packed lunch.

I used 1/8 cup sugar substitute (I am diabetic) and changed the vinegar to apple cider.  I also sliced the onions very thin (like the cucumbers).  I made it exactly as written the first time, but  these changes made it more like MY Moms.

Timing is everything!  Probably wouldn't have tried this recipe as I've been eating and making a marinated cuke/onion salad since I was a kid in the 60s and neither my Mom nor I ever used anything but a vinegar/water solution with a little salt and pepper and it was great, especially after a few days in the fridge.  While in Charleston, SC vacationing with family last month we went to a low country restaurant named Jestine's Kitchen.  The whole meal was fantastic but the fresh cuke pickles were so good that we bought a gallon to go when we left.  My son-in-law and I both remarked that we needed to find the recipe.  This may not be "spot on" but it's real close.  The vinegar/sugar mix is perfect, not too sweet or acidic, and the celery seed is the kicker.  I did use apple cider vinegar and added a pinch of dried dill and, following other reviewer's advice, I didn't squeeze the water out of the cukes nor add water.  Great fresh pickles, Thanks!!

The best way to fix cucumbers! Instead of celery seed, I use parsley and a dash of Italian seasoning. But use your favorite seasonings... it is a hit any way you dress it up!

Thought this was great!  I just did thinly sliced onion, not chopped.  I also didn't have an celery seed so I just threw in some fresh dill.  Added a small amount of pepper and these were all eaten at the get together last night.  I got asked for the recipe several times!  This one is a keeper!

I had to make do with what I had - sesame seeds and rice vinegar. It turned out pretty good, I suppose. An interesting flavor sensation, to be sure. I only used one cucumber and I'm not sure how well it scales down, but one was more than enough for a side dish for two.

This is a standby recipe I rely on every summer. It is quick and easy.  My family loves it.  I took it to a work potluck and everyone wanted the recipe.  An excellent way to make use of an abundant harvest of garden cucumbers.  I do leave out the celery seed and often add minced hot peppers for a kick.

This recipe reminds me of a summer dish that my mother used to make.  It was one of my favorites and this recipe is just as good.  I left out the celery seed.  It's such a crisp summer salad...YUM!

I like mine a little more sweet & tangy.  Sorry, just wasn't what I was looking for.

The entire fam has been enjoying this receipe all summer long.  I added a couple of drops of sesame seed oil since I was adding them to my Chinese Chicken Salad.  Delish!

Left out the onions, personal pref. The taste is delish. Subtle yet flavorful at the same time. Nothing was to over powerful. My husband thought they were great.

I'm not super wild about this, but my husband loves it.  It's easy enough that he can fix it for himself in a matter of minutes, so two thumbs up!

Loved it.  I used half a red onion and a whole diced tomato for color.  It tasted just like the my favorite that Boston Market used to make, but sweeter.   Thanks!

Not bad.  I couldn't eat them, though. Made me feel a lil sick to my tummy. Tasted quite a bit like a sweet pickle to me.  My fiance said they were alright, and he could eat them a little at a time(he usually heaps his plate with food) and my 6 year old thought they were good.  Doubt I'll make them again, but nice recipe to try!!
