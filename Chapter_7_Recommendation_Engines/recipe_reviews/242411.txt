Skipped the celery had none.  Added hot pepper flakes to each individual bowl.  Yum.  Great soup for the cold winter nights in Wisconsin. Will make again for sure.

This is a terrific soup. I added red pepper based on other recommendations. I also converted this to an Instant Pot recipe. I sauteed the apples and onions in the Instant Pot, continued the recipe and then pressed the soup button. I think that translates to 30 minutes high pressure. Next time I will try it with 1 cup of uncooked lentils instead of precooked.

I was not impressed with my first spoonful. I think I just didn’t “get” the soup right away. By the 5th spoonful, I thought it was delicious, and I had a second bowl.

I found this soup a little bland as the recipe is written so I dished up individual bowls and tried out different spices.  Hot pepper flakes as another reviewer suggested were excellent as were curry powder and a dash of cinnamon, I also liked cumin. A little spice makes this a nice warming cold weather dish.
