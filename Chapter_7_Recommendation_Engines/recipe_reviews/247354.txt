This recipe was easy to get together and was different than any pulled pork I have had before.   I had never tried ginger beer before and it had a spicy kick, so, I was excited about the flavor it would give the pork.  Unfortunately, I didn't taste any of the ginger in the pork.  That being said, we still really enjoyed the pulled pork.  It had a nice smokiness from the smoked paprika and a slight spice from the red pepper flakes.  Very tasty!

This did not meet my expectations at all.  I even bought the ginger beer (had to buy six pack so was hoping for great results) but was disappointed.  The pork was fine after I added Hawaiian Islands original BBQ sauce so the pork was not wasted, but I'll not make this again.

Instead of ginger beer, I used a can of ginger ale.  (I used Zevia brand as we are trying to limit our sugar).  I used  2T  dark molasses instead of brown sugar-- just because I love the flavor.   If some in family like BBQ sauce in their pulled pork,  no problem.  They can add it to their serving.

This  was really good! Used "Not Your Fathers Ginger Ale". Worked great. Wonderful flavor. Served up on corn tortillas, diced tomatos, sour cream, and cilantro. Yum! Thank you!

This was delicious.  I used a pork loin roast for a leaner pulled pork.  Smelled wonderful while slow cooking.  Like the hint of ginger.
