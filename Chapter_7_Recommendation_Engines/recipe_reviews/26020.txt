Like some of the other suggestions, I changed up the ratios.  I used all 8 oz. of the cream cheese package and only 1 cup of sugar.  The frosting turned out absolutely wonderful!!

I like the smooth creamy texture.  I used the whole 8 oz creeam cheese though and a little more poweder sugar and still great.  I also added just a drop of orange extract which I think compliments carrot cake. I made carrot cupcakes and with the frosting it was very good.

This was delicious but it is definitely only for cakes-and needs refrigeration! I used it for cupcakes and it didn't firmed up at all. We took the cupcakes somewhere and the icing got all over my tupperware and didn't stay at all on the cupcakes. We wound up with quite a mess and some very ugly cupcakes. It was very yummy mess though!

My family absolutely loved this frosting.  I followed a few other reviews and used all 8oz of cream cheese and cut the sugar to 1 cup. It was not too sweet while still providing that great cream cheese flavor.  I made it several hours before I needed to frost my cake and it set up beautifully!

Oh Gosh I could not tell you how easy & yummy this recipe is! I followed the directions just like they are but for the ingredients I used lite frozen whipped topping ( Cool Whip), & lite cream cream to lower the calories but no one would ever know by how good this was on my cupcakes on Thanksgiving!

This frosting was really delicious!  I used this recipe on a chocolated cake and used only 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar and add 5 crushed hershey's chocolate bars with almonds.  I recieved many compliments.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a staple frosting for me.  I found it a little to sweet for my tastes but I just cut back on the sugar without it having any affect on the frosting.  For something a little different, add some cocoa powder to make a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

Luv this frosting, I always use 8 oz. cream cheese and extract depending on type of cake. I've used banana, lemon, rum and strawberry extract.

This was good frosting, but it was more like a topping.  It will not harden up.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted!!! Also used 8 oz of cream cheese (instead of 3) and it was perfect!!! Mine turned out perfectly fluffy and allowed me to even put a swirl on the top of each cupcake.

Taste great - but consistency is more like cool whip, so it won't firm up the way many frosting do.

Great frosting!  We usually make butter cream but this has a great cream cheese undertone.  It is very easy to make (my 6 yr old son made it)and very yummy.....everyone had a second piece tonight. I would make as the cake is cooling and let it sit a little to thicken.

With changes this was great. Can't speak for the original recipe. I did 8oz nuefatchl cheese, 8oz fat free whipped topping, and the 1 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar. I also added about 1/2 tsp raspberry extract. It was fantastic! You need to refrigerate it just a bit, and keep the cake cold. I think a little bit of corn syrup might enhance the finish of the frosting.

i too had an unfirm frosting.  because i have made numerous cream cheese frosting similar to this, my theory is that it depends on the cream cheese.  sometimes (even if it's not expired) the cream cheese starts turning into separated curds and whey.  i had this consistency today (it's philadelphia cc), and attempted to make a frosting.  it was too wet, so i added 3 oz white chocolate dry pudding mix and splashes of milk... and mixed.  the taste was delicious but i wanted back my tangy zing, so i added whip cream.  result?  the best of both worlds - a little bit of white chocolate, and a little bit of cream cheese.  yum yum.

Very yummy, I just made it.  I haven't attempted to put it on a cake yet, but I won't do that until tomorrow, as per the suggestions I read from other reviewers.  I also added all of the 8 oz of cream cheese, 1 cup of sugar, and about 2/3 of the whip cream.  It was pretty good just like that!

I mostly went off of the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site but did just 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of cool whip and it was awesome.  I don't like frosting that is too heavy or too sweet!

I read some of the other reviews and used 7-8 oz of cream cheese.  The was to runny to spread as a frosting, but I left it in the bowl and we just spooned some on our pear bread when we had a piece.

I didn't make any changes, however it is a bit soft at first. I used it as a dip for cake bites, and also as a frosting for carrotcake both were yummy!! I frosted the cake after the frosting sat in the fridge for a few hours.

The only change I made was to only add 4 TBSPS of whipped topping. But it really didn't need it.  I put the frosting in the fridge to set for a while. Then frosted the cake and put both in the fridge. THIS STAYED FIRM AND DELICIOUS!

I followed the suggestion of some of the others and added all 8 oz. of cream cheese.  However, this made it taste too "cream-cheesy".  3 would have likely been too little so perhaps 5 or 6 oz would have worked well.  Other than that, it turned out great!

I used 8 oz of cream cheese and added a dash of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe and the frosting tasted great. For those of you having problems with lumps, perhaps it is because your whipped topping is still frozen? Mine was frozen so I whipped the cream cheese, then added the topping and whipped it until it was blended. It was very lumpy, so I just left it on the counter until it thawed a bit... maybe 20-30 minutes. Then I came back and whipped it some more and it smoothed right out. I added the sugar a litte at a time and it whipped up to perfection! But like others said, this frosting did NOT set! I was prepared for that though and didn't mind. Sometimes different is good and a cool, smooth, whipped frosting sure hit the spot on this warm day! Thanks!

As others suggested, I used only 1 cup of powdered sugar & 8 oz of cream cheese with the 8 oz tub of cool whip.  I thought this was strange at first & not sure how good it would be on my banana cake.  I really like cream cheese & this didn't have a strong cream cheese flavor like I'm used too, but it was AWESOME!  It got rave reviews from coworkers & we all decided this frosting with the cool whip really woked well for my banana cake!  We thought you wouldn't want to eat the banana cake with carrot cake frosting!  (We all associate carrot cake with really cream cheesy frosting).  I LOVE cream cheese frosting & this really is good!  Mine was not very pretty & I think I could have put it in my kitchen aide with the whisk attachment to get a prettier finished product for my cake, but tasted good!  Will use this one again for sure!

This icing is so light and wonderful! I used it on a red velvet cake and it was perfect. I used an entire package of low fat cream cheese and used lite whipped topping. I also refrigerated it for about an hour before I used it on my cake. It worked wonderfully!

I loved it, it was super easy and added 1 tsp. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup though and thought it was a little too sugary even cut back, I think next time I'll try 3/4. 

If you have trouble with texture make sure you soften the cream cheese to room temp, I had no prob with blending.

The texture of the frosting wasn't smooth enough. I couldn't get the cream cheese to blend fully with the whipped cream. Usually my frostings turn out well, but next time I need a cream cheese frosting I'll use something without whipped cream.

can't believe out of 37 reviews, no one bothered to change or comment on the quantity of cream cheese called for.  Not being that familiar with cream cheese, I think that "3" oz. meant "8" oz.  Frosting was like soup after adding the cream.  Tried to chill....didn't work!!!  Ruined the cake!

This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. I was licking the beaters! It was sweet, yet stil tangy. However, I used all 8 oz of the cream cheese, only a cup of the sugar, and used most of a can of arisol whipped cream. Of course, the whipped cream would have tasted better if it was the real thing, but the arisol cream made the frosting nice and light. Great on carrot cake, but waffles + apple sauce + cream cheese frosting = match made in HEAVEN.

This was a good base recipe, but I added my own twist to it. As others, I reduced the amount of sugar and increased the cream cheese.   I used about 3/4 c powdered sugar, 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz of whipped topping. I also took a about a cup of frozen strawberries I had on hand, thawed and pureed them and added them to the frosting.   This made a TON of frosting and I was only making a small (8") chocolate cake, so I took about 3/4 c of the finished frosting mixture and added it to my cake batter. This made the cake so light and fluffy with the SLIGHTEST hint of strawberry. I topped the cake with some chocolate curls. So yummy!

I did not like this frosting at all!  I used a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese, per some reviewers suggestions.  The cream cheese stayed clumpy.  It wasn't sweet and definitely didn't taste like cream cheese frosting.

I wanted white chocolate cream cheese frosting, so I added 4 oz melted white chocolate (cooled slightly) to the end result. I also used the entire block of cream cheese. I used this on red velvet cake. Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be using it again!

Super easy frosting that tastes great.  Based on other reviews, I increased the cream cheese to 8 oz.  Softened everything to room temperature and followed directions.  Refrigerated over night since it was late and my cake still had to cool.  The following morning I let it sit to warm for about 30 minutes and then spread over two-layer 9 inch cake.  Great consistency and had no issues spreading.  Will definitely use again.

Super easy to make, and very tasty!!  I recommend heating up the cream cheese before trying to mix it with the whipped cream.  I might experiment with adding some other elements in the future.

WOW! This frosting came out great! I used about 5 oz of cream cheese (that's what I had on hand), just under 1 c. of regular sugar and beat the crud out of it for about 3 min, adding about 1 Tbsp of Hershey's syrup for color/flavor, then I gently folded in 1/2 container of Cool Whip (didn't need a lot of frosting). The texture is smooth, light and super creamy. I've got it in the fridge for a few minutes right now, before I frost the cake (Choc. Choc. Chip Dream Cake, from this site), but it came out with a perfectly ready-to-frost texture. It is not overly-sweet and I can't wait for the Birthday Boy (my hubby) to get home so we can eat this...maybe tonight is the night we have dessert before dinner...I will definitely use this recipe in the future because I can tell that it will be very versatile and not too sweet. Thanks everyone!

I made this to use with brownies and cherry pie filling. All I could taste was the confectioner's sugar and the while the consistency was smooth, it tasted powdery. I even had increased the cream cheese to 5 oz because I like the flavor and still couldn't taste it at all.

Thanks, I was looking for a simple recipe with what I had in my kitchen. Me and my 10 year old daughter decided to bake a cake and when we were done we had no frosting. I knew there was somthing to make with what I had and found it here. Absolutly grand. Thanks for making our cake a success.

I altered this recipe slightly using 4 oz. of cream cheese and 1 & 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar along with 3 drops of lemon juice and a few drops of vanilla.  It turned out delicious and had a great consistency.  I used it on a spice cake.  I will definitely use this again.

In order not to make the frosting too sweet I added the confectionary sugar to taste and used much less than the recipe called for. I added a dash of lemon extract and added the whipped topping till I got the consistency I wanted. I used this as a filler for Pumpkin Whoopie Pies (from this site)and had many compliments. Will use this again.

I thought this was overpoweringly sweet, and I have a sweet tooth.  My husband couldn't take it; too rich.  But...this would be fantasic as the filling for strawberry pretzel squares sort of recipes.  Their filling recipe is very close to this frosting.

I loved this recipe, used 2 cups of frozen whipped topping, thawed. Blended all the ingredients together.  Great on Banana Cake VII.
