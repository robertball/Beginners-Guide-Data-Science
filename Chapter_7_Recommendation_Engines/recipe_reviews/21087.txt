The only reason for the lower rating I've given is that it really needs to be noted that the corned beef should be cooked beforehand.  Maybe the recipe is geared more towards deli-style sliced corned beef?  I cut up the pound of beef I had and baked as directed and the meat was very tough.  The flavor is good, but next time I will boil my meat first.

I made this with deli corned beef that I'd had very thickly sliced. I also used Thousand Island dressing instead of mayonnaise for more of a Reuben flavor. We really enjoyed it - quick, easy and filling. Thanks, Jeanie!

Great recipe!  I am a vegetarian so I have substituted a fake meat product.  This recipe is easy yet impressive.

The recipe was ok.  I mixed some onion and garlic powder to the buttered noodles because I thought it was going to be a little bland.  I would increase the 1000 island dressing to a cup and I used 2 cups of the buttery saltine crackers.  other than that I thought this was a good way to use up those leftovers from St. Patricks day, other than reuben sandwiches. I think this may be a good way to do other casseroles though.  Thanks for the recipe

. I used leftover corned beef and cabbage from St Patricks Day. I added a little ketchup to the mayo to taste more like thousand island dressing. That didn't work. This was so gross to me. I ate a few bites and had to run to the bathroom to vomit. Sorry, but this was a waste of ingredients.....it was thrown in the trash.

Pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, used leftover corned beef from St. Patty's meal, and the family seemed to enjoy it.  It was quite simple to prepare, as well, which makes it a great weeknight dinner.  I don't usually have corned beef on hand, so would probably either use deli corned beef or canned corned beef if I make again.  I'm not sure which type the recipe would be best with.

I used thousand island dressing and turkey instead of corned beef to make a rachel noodle bake. I'd make it again!

Nothing special and it does not reheat well.  I used Thousand Island Dressing in lieu of the but mayo but I won't make this again because it wasn't memorable and was dry.

I thought this was ok, husband thought it was good.  I felt the sum of the parts was less than if I had not mixed the ingredients all together.

My very picky hubby loves this, and he won't eat most casseroles!  I shredded some thin sliced deli corn beef and used thousand island dressing.  Other than that, followed the recipe pretty closely. Makes great leftovers too :)

Made exactly as described. It was good, but next time I think I'll use 1000 island dressing instead of the mayo to make it taste even more like a Reuben. The carrowey mixed with the saltines were good though, and tasted a bit like rye bread!

I used cooked ground beef instead of corned beef and sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  Thanks for the great idea.
