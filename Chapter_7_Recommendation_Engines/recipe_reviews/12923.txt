This was so good!  I made a few changes:  didn't peel the potatoes, used chicken sausage, added carrots and parsley, used chicken broth instead of water, and 1 cup of half/half instead of the evap. milk.  I dissolved 1T of flour in the cream before I added it to the soup to thicken it up a bit.  Next time I will probably add another can of whole kernel corn, too.  I love corn chowder and this was the best yet!

WOW! SO good. The only actual changes I made were using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the evap. milk and chicken broth instead of water. Some recommendations: use italian sausage, a mix of red and yukon gold potatoes (they're what I had on hand and turned out great!), add a couple splashes of Tobasco, and use red onion =). I also added some spices based on personal preference. This is AWESOME and easy to tweak to perfection. (Note: I let this simmer for about an hour and the consistency was perfect!)

I just made this last night and my husband and I both thought it was very good. I did use chicken broth instead of water and red potatoes unpeeled. For the sausage I used keilbasa (however you spell it) I also took some to my parents for lunch today and they both enjoyed it. I will definetly make this again!

My family absolutely went nuts over this chowder; particularly my 13 year old daughter who loves creamed corn to begin with. I used two cans of creamed corn only, added some red onion and diced roasted red peppers for some color. Delish!!!!

So good!  I loved this and will definitely make again.  I used two cans of creamed corn and omitted the can of whole kernel corn.  Also added two chicken bouillon cubes to the water.

I was so surprised at how delicious this was.  I was skeptical because I had never used evaporated milk before, and I hate creamed corn.  That being said, I was in a chowder mood.  I tweaked the recipe a little bit, I added half a pound of breakfast sausage and a package of bacon ends, which I fried together, and added to the chowder.  In the bacon/sausage grease I fried the onions until they were just beginning to become translucent, so they still had a crunch.
Fabulous recipe, my last corn chowder sucked, this one completely redeemed the meal.  Thanks!!

As written definitely 4 stars, but I decided to tweak this recipe a bit while making it.  First of all I used mild Italian sausage which I find has so much more flavor than regular pork.  To make this chowder more robust I used 3 cups of potatoes, and 1 cup of carrots, celery and chopped onion. Quick, easy, and economical.  Thanks, Yvonne for sharing your recipe!!

This was VERY tasty!  It is not a super thick chowder (which I typically prefer) but I really enjoyed the consistency anyway.  I added chicken bullion and carrots in with the potatoes and use 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 small can of kernel corn (I think the kernel corn gives an extra texture).  I followed the suggestion of adding some flour to my sausage and onions and I really don't feel like it was necessary.  This is a very good recipe and doesn't need a bunch of changes.  I really love finding a recipe that is nice and EASY!

Absolutely wonderful.  Easy to prepare.  The entire family loved it.  I used two cans of creamed corn and added a few extras like diced celery and shaved carrot.  This will definately be a regular on the menu.  Thanks for the great chowder!

This is so good. I am so glad I used the Ingredient Search. This is so simple. Made changes using what I had on hand. 1/2 & 1/2 instead of evap milk, frozen whole kernel instead of canned. The recipe didn't specify so I used hot sausage. Added two large carrots and a pinch of red pepper flake. Before serving I melted a cup of shredded white cheddar into the pot. This recipe is super versatile. Enjoy!

We loved this chowder.  I did not have a problem with it being too thin, quite the opposite but that might be that I probably had 7 cups of potatoes and added 2 chopped carrots for color and added nutrition.  I used turkey sausage instead of the pork sausage and left out the marjoram because I didn't have any.  Once the potatoes were cooked, it was just a matter of throwing everything else in and dinner was finished.

Solidly good - simple, basic flavors that resulted in a decently tasty chowder.  I prepared exactly as called for, but in the end had to do as a few other reviewers noted and create a little roux of butter, flour and milk and then add it to the soup to help it reach the desired consistency.

I've been making this basic chowder recipe for several years. The chowder always gets rave reviews and recipe requests every time I make it for work, family and friends. I double & even triple the recipe but it's never enough. I use low sodium chicken broth in place of the water; 4-6 cups cubed potato; 1 roll of hot sausage and 1 lg can of evaporated milk instead of cream per recipe. Feel free to add more marjoram (I've even added sage and thyme for a change). It does make a fairly thin chowder but you can thicken it up with a couple tablespoons of instant potato flakes if you prefer.  I serve it with chopped green onions and cheddar cheese on top. Gets even better reheated the next day. Yummy!!

Wow, was this some good food.  My husband has been asking me every couple days, "so, when are you going to make that soup again?" 
Only changes I made were to sub. turkey broth for the water and use spicy sausage, add half a chopped red bell pepper, a carrot or two, some oregano and parsley, and used frozen whole kernel corn.  Let all cook for a bit without the milk to comine the flavors.  Then pureed about half of the soup in the food processor before putting it back on the stovetop to add and heat up the milk.  We couldn't stop at one bowl!  Hearty, creamy, filling.  Great comfort food!

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  He was upset when it was all gone and is even willing to peel the potatoes if I agree to make it again.  Will definitely be making this again.

I added bacon, chives and sour cream to the top and this turned out wonderful! I also added in a 1/2 tsp of garlic. This is a MUST HAVE on a chilly fall day!

Very good with surprising little effort.  Equally good with dumplings instead of potatoes.  Easy to lighten it up with turkey or chicken sausage.  Extra good with fresh corn.

Very simple and tasty.  I didn't have sage flavored sausage as some recommended, so I added 1/2 tsp. sage to the soup.  I also didn't have creamed corn, but didn't miss it.  Tried a second time with 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese added.  Really good.

Very tasty and easy.  Instead of ground sausage, I used smoked sausage that I just cut into slices.  Next time, I plan on eliminating the whole kernal corn and using 2 cans of creamed corn instead.

This was a great meal!  I substituted chicken broth in place of the water.  I also added diced red bell peppers for color and flavor.  It was great!

This was good.  I'll probably make it again but add more vegetables and find a different meat.  The sausage flavor was a little strange.

This was great! I halfed the recipe but still added 1 can of each corn (creamed and whole kernel), then addeded some garlic salt for extra flavor. I think next time I will also boil the potatoes in low sodium chicken broth for more flavor! And I added cheese and green onions on top for garnishing :) So yummy and not expensive to make for a college kid like me!

I took some of the advice already posted and added chicken broth instead of water.  I also had left over pork loin and used this as a substitute to the Sausage.  My husband loved it!

This is an excellent recipe for a quick meal.  To add more corn flavor, I suggest roasting your own corn on the grill and using that instead of canned corn.  And don't forget plenty of salt to perk up the flavor.  My toddlers absolutely love this soup.

This was easy to make, but I thought it had a distinct canned corn taste. It seemed quite sweet...I would consider trying it with frozen corn.

A great chowder.  I started with a roux base (because we like it really thick and hearty) and I added more corn and spices.  A quick easy soup that has no problem taking center stage as the main course!

Very quick and easy to prepare, wonderful & filling. I added a stalk of chopped celery with the onion and sausage, chicken broth instead of water and added a splash of sherry to give it that gourmet touch! (Kids probably wouldn't like it with that addition)  This will be added to my cookbook, thanks!

Good and hearty soup. I used basil instead and left all other ingrediants the same. I might add a little cheese next time but otherwise, this was tasty and easy to make. Thanks Yvonne!

A hearty soup for a wet and rainy day!!
I substituted skim milk for the evaporated milk and also added a drained can of lentils to the soup.  I served the soup with fresh buttermilk biscuits.  Delicious....

this has been my go to recipe for quite awhile cuz it's always a big hit. in the summer I make it with fresh corn. I don't like creamed corn so I use another can of regular corn and blend it a little with cream. I halve the water/chicken stock so it's thicker and when I make it, I do big batches and freeze it. it freezes exceptionally well.

It really is quite good.  I followed the recipe as written (except for substituting moose sausage for pork) and ended up adding a little extra salt in the end.  Very good.

I was not fond of this recipe. I don't think it has anything to do with the recipe itself, in my house we found that the flavor was very bland and it took longer than expected. Plus, we also gathered, that while we love corn, we don't like it mixed in with our food. It needs to be on it's own supporting side dish roll.

I just made this chowder this morning. The only things I added were carrot which I see in the picture you added too. Also I always add coarse black pepper to my soups, and I also added a teaspoon of curry powder and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch. This is my 2nd time making this recipe, the first time I added the curry powder by accident. It was such a happy accident that I'm using it again this time!

As written, I give this recipe 4 stars. But I took a few suggestions of previous reviewers, and with those suggestions it's definitely worth 5 stars: 
1. I added a cup of diced carrots in with the potatoes. 
2. I used chicken stock instead of water. 
3. I used turkey smoked sausage instead of the ground pork sausage. 
4. I used 2 cans of whole kernel corn instead of 1 can. 
5. I added some freshly ground black pepper towards the end, around 1/2 a tsp.
I took this to a potluck and at least 5 people asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper with these changes. Absolutely delicious!

Great recipe!  My roommate made this last night and it was a big hit. A couple minor changes: she used canned potatoes (too lazy to peel and wait to soften), oregano instead of marjoram, and she flavored it a little more with butter and herb potato flakes. 

Definitely does not need more salt, though, since the pork is salty.  Really good!

Very good. I used 2 cans of cream corn; omitted the can of regular corn, put kernels from two ears of corn in with the potatoes and added a chopped red pepper too and boiled them untill they were tender. Used chicken buillion and a heaping teaspoon of Italian Seasoning to the three cups of water.Used 2 pounds of Italian Mild Sausage. And followed the rest of the recipe.

I am giving this five stars because my husband, our college age son and three of his college age friends, ALL gave this two thumbs up!  I served it with biscuits and they didn't even want dessert until about two hours later.  This dish will put a smile on a man's face for sure!  A few small changes: I didn't have an onion so I added a package of Lipton onion soup mix with 1/2 cup of water to the sausage after it was browned.  I used turkey sausage, two cans of whole kernel corn, and added 1 cup of chicken broth and two cups of shredded cheese at the end.  It turned out great!  Will certainly make again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the first chowder I ever made.  It was pretty simple and really tasty.  I added the celery and carrots like others suggested, used red onion, half and half (will try evaporated milk next time) and didn't peel the potatoes. I let it simmer on low for two hours to thicken it up.  It was very satisfying.  I froze the leftovers in individual bags to take to work for lunches.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made a corn chowder recipe I found in a magazine a long time ago but have since lost it.  Today I went on line to find another corn chowder recipe and decided to make this one.  Just one word describes it......DELISH!!!  My 10 year old who is super pickey loved it too. I only changed a few things.  I didnt peel the potatoes (all the vitamins are in the peel!!) I used chicken broth instead of water and I diced up some red bell pepper.  It was soooooo very good!! Thank you for sharing!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this chowder.  As others recommended, I substituted chicken broth for water.  I did not have any marjoram so I used oregano.  The only sausage I had was a sweet italian sausage.  Overall a great recipe.  We topped our soup with cheddar cheese and enjoyed.  It was very filling and the leftovers were even better.

The measure of a great recipe is its ability to adapt to various tastes and still taste terrific.  This soup certainly fits the bill.  My husband is a meat eater, so I sliced a pound of smoked sausage and added it to the chowder.  In addition, I skipped the instant potatoes and added cubed 3 red skinned potatoes instead.  I let the stew simmer until the vegetables were well cooked and added the milk and half&half at the end.  Fabulous!!!!

I guess my family aren't chowder fans.  My son made his bowl before I added the milk and he liked it a lot.  My husband said he wasn't fond of the milk based soup.

This has been a family favorite for years. Simple, quick and hearty. Over the years I've added different things or made it just as the recipe states. Either way my family is not disappointed.  My only suggestion is to use some chicken stock.

I  followed some advice from  other reviewers. I used half and half, chicken broth, hot chicken sausage and unpeeled yukon gold potatoes. Instead of canned corn I used fresh corn that I cut off the Cobb. With these changes it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I followed most of the recipe, although instead of the whole kernel corn I added a can of mexi-corn, and i used chicken broth. I also added some Velveeta and about 5 ounces of hot pepper cheese and a can of cambells fiesta nacho cheese soup. And a little fresh garlic. Everyone loved it. Will make again.

Yummy and forgiving.  You can use any kind of potatoes (peeled or not), and any kind of sausage.  I have used link breakfast sausage, bulk breakfast sausage, mild and sweet Italian sausage, and bratwurst.  All good.  I've made it with evaporated milk and half and half.  Both good.  I always use chicken broth instead of water, though.  More flavor.  I've used canned corn, frozen corn, but it is especially good with fresh corn.  If I have celery and carrots, I add them.

Perfect cold weather meal! I used hot deer sausage, 2/3 can creamed corn (didn’t want it too sweet), and added some black pepper. Turned out great and was very filling!

This has been my go to corn chowder recipe for many years. I add chopped celery to the potatoes as they are cooking and if I don’t have sausage I use bacon and follow all the steps. If I don’t have canned kernel corn I will use frozen and dump it into the cooking potatoes when they are finished. Good soup.

Loved this recipe! I doubled it and it easily fed a meal for 9 people with a little bit of left overs. I added carrots and celery and switched the evaporated milk with half and half. I also substituted half of the water with chicken stock.

Made this chowder tonight and we both had seconds!! I doubled the recipe to have lunches this week, and I'm so glad I did! I added a bit more corn and used chicken broth instead of water and added my own spices. thickened it too. We may try linguica or chorizo instead of sausage. all in all one of my favorite new recipes!!!!

We made this last night for dinner. It was just so-so. As written it was definitely not thick enough to be called a chowder. The heartiness of the sausage combined with the sweetness of the creamed corn just don't go together. Possibly the only redeeming quality of it was the potatoes, which were tender and delicious. If I was to make this recipe again, I would thicken the mixture by adding corn starch and leave out the creamed corn.

What I love about this site is reading all the reviews to see what worked or didn't work for others - and finding suggestions I might not have thought of otherwise.
And what I love about this recipe is that it can be changed easily to suit what I have on hand & the tastes of those eating that particular batch. One thing I always do is use broth instead of water for more flavor & to thicken as needed with instant potatoes.

It's ok! It seems very watery to me. Since it had me measure out the water for boiling the potatoes, I added the cooking water. It didn't say to drain the can of whole corn. So I added it. But anyway, it had an ok flavor. I think I'll go back to my recipe that took a bit longer to make but was was much more creamy.

This is almost identical to a corn chowder I used to make but forgot all about. Thanks for the reminder. I like the marjoram. Previously I used white pepper, which is also good. I use chicken broth instead of water. I will definitely be making this again.  Delicious and comforting.

This was really good.  Just finished making it.  I read a lot of the reviews and did take some of the ideas - like adding celery and carrot and bacon - using frozen corn in place of the one can of whole kernel corn and kielbasa instead of ground sausage.  Thanks for the recipe!  P.S.  I actually love this site because of all the reviews and ideas from different people.

I used chicken stock instead of water.  I used thin skinned potatoes so did not peel them and mashed them to thicken soup.  Turned out great.

Doubled recipe so I'd have some to freeze later. Used turkey breakfast sausage and added carrot (4 lg.) and celery (4 stalks) - next time I would use less carrot for sure and possibly more celery. Didn't quite double the potato - probably used 9-10 cups. Purposefully kept it mild for my kids' sake, but seasoned my own bowl at the table with a touch of salt and a hefty grind of fresh pepper. Also for my kids, I made it more "soupy" by adding chicken broth - definitely skip if chunkier texture desired. 

Wanted a one-pot preparation, so browned meat first in large Dutch oven, chopping vegetables and adding them to the pot as I went along, to sauté in the grease. (If turkey sausage not used, would drain most of grease before proceeding with sauté.) Lastly added potato, marjoram, corn, milk, and enough chicken broth to top off the pot. Ended up putting the whole 32 oz. of broth in, and the resulting mixture filled my big 7-qt. Dutch oven to the brim. 

Let it simmer, covered, a couple hours while I left the house - loved how the broth soaked up all the flavors, but the potatoes were almost too mushy. Next time would only simmer 30 minutes or so. Also, depending on seasoning of sausage used, would add garlic, salt, pepper, and possibly even a few red pepper flakes.

Wow love this soup! Instead of water I substituted chicken broth, and added heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk for a richer flavor. I used red potatoes and also added 4 oz of Mexican velveeta I had on hand I wanted to use up. So tasty, my husband and I love it with these changes!

This recipe is great!! I made a few changes simply because I was low or out of some ingredients. I halved the recipe because I didn't have creamed corn and I only had one can of corn, which was he perfect amount. Plus, half size is perfect for my family. I don't eat pork so I used turkey sausage but added a few sprinkles of hot pepper flakes since turkey sausage lacks that *kick* pork sausage has. I also didn't have evaporated milk but I did have half and half. 

Even with the changes, I'm sure this recipe would be great as is.

The texture was wonderful. However, I did not enjoy the pork sausage.  If I make this again, I think I'll try ground chicken or turkey.  (Just personal preference)

Wonderful chowder! I made a half-batch, using one cooked ear of corn in place of the canned. I made a few minor changes that helped me to enjoy it more. I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth. I browned cut-up spicy Italian chicken sausages (loved their spicyness in this chowder). Separately, in the same pan, I sauteed onion, garlic and some shredded carrots. Added all of that, with additional seasonings to the soup pot. Also made a roux with butter, flour and milk to add a little more thickness to the chowder. I liked the suggestions for topping with cheese. I tried adding some grated parmesan-romano, and have to say that I enjoyed it much better with it! Thanks for the super chowder recipe, Yvonne!

3rd time in as many weeks. Gets better everytime. I add peppered bacon and use chicken broth instead of water.  If its not thick enough I use about a1/2 package of instant mashed potatos.  Makes enough for about 3days of lunches.

Absolutely delicious!
First, I sauteed 3 tablespoons butter with 3/4 of yellow onion till the onion was a bit caramelized, but still tender. Then I put in 3-4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder with 5 cups of boiling water. I cubed 6 cups of potatoes. I added 4 large carrots - about 2.5 cups diced. I also added 1 celery stalk diced into tiny pieces. I boiled this until the potatoes were tender and then I added in fat-free evaporated milk and 2 cans of cream style corn. I diced 3 Curly's Smokehouse Double Smoked pork sausage and added them into the soup and let it boil some more. I also added in 1 tablespoon of black pepper. Amazing tasting...sweet and a bit of zing from the pepper. Delish! I think the smoked sausage and the black ground pepper really made the chowder. When serving, I add fresh chopped green onion and oyster crackers.

Hubby would give it a 5 and I would give it a 3 so I settled on a 4 star. It really tastes too much like cream corn to me. I didn't have the marjoram and used chicken broth instead of plain water.

Made for Scott 11/17/2013 -  good, quick & easy (especially if the sausage is browned ahead of time!).  Added more marjoram at end. Could try other spices to give it more pizzazz next time.

So good!  I used chicken broth instead of water, sweet potatoes, italian seasoning, omitted the salt, added pepper.  I also used skim milk and frozen kernel corn instead of canned corn (that's what I had on hand).  So delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

It was a little sweet but that might be because of the sausage I used (sweet italian). Next time I will try it with a more spicy sausage.

My mom has made this recipe for years, and it's one of my favs. Our plans to make it tonight were almost derailed when I looked at my can of evaporated milk and it was expired - but I substituted about a cup of plain greek yogurt whisked with milk to reach the consistency of evaporated milk, and it's DELICIOUS. I actually might like it better with yogurt - give it a shot!

This was a hit at my house.  I substituted diced smoked sausage for the pork sausage and we really liked it. I'm not sure a ground sausage would have been to my liking.  I made some home made bread croutons to sprinkle on top.  I made this last week and my teenage son is already asking for it again, so it's a winner in my book.

We really enjoyed this soup with a couple of changes.  I boiled the potatoes in low sodium chicken broth and skipped the salt.  Sauteed the onion and a small jalapeno in olive oil before adding jalapeno chipotle CHICKEN sausage.  Substituted a cup of mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots) for the can of sweet corn.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I also changed it just a little. Instead of sausage I wanted to make it vegetarian, so I added veggie Italian style sausage crumbles, Spike veggie seasoning,1 cup of pureed Kale and 2 leeks. Yummy!!Thanks for the recipe.

great base to a great chowder. I have a couple of suggestions that you may enjoy. Add a small can of mediumn green chillies, use chicken stock instead of water, cook and grind half the sausage to add to the stock, cook the other half of the sausage in 1/2 inch pieces and add to stock. I added 2 tbls of corn starch to thicken it up.

Good recipe.  I only used 3c. of potatoes and I left out the marjoram.  I used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of cream of mushroom soup, Old Bay, black pepper and ground red pepper.  Yummy!!

Absolutly delicious. I had sausage and corn chowder at a high rated restaurant and this recipe is better. Few changes: I used two cans of sweet creamed corn as opposed to one creamed corn/one kernel corn. Also used sage sausage andmild sausage mix. Slow cooked chowder for an hour on stove top. In a side pot added of the juice with flour and slow cooked till thick then added back to chowder.(personal preference to havge thick thick chowder). Bravo though delicious!!!

Great recipe! I experimented with the following alterations: i used a can of diced potatoes for speedier prep, added a shredded carrot, 1 can of cream of celery soup. After browning the sausage and onion, i added about 2 TBS of flour and mixed well with the meat before adding to the potato mixture to thicken it up a bit. I used frozen corn, and a tube of the frozen creamed corn. I added a dash of curry powder, and crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick. Very delicious!!!

This was really good.  My kids all gave it a "thumbs up."  I followed the recipe as listed except I used smoked sausage and 2 cans of creamed corn because that was what I had on hand. I will definitely make it again.

as reviewers suggested i added some carrots and celery, used 2 cans creamed corn only, and added 2 cubes chicken bouillion. i even used spicy sausage but i still ended up having to add some cayenne and garlic powder at the end. i didnt have any evaporated milk but i substituted 2/3 c dry milk and 3/4 c water and it worked perfectly. i would make this again with but i would use fresh garlic next time. this is a great recipe that you can change according to your taste.

I really couldn't help but thinking that the sausage stuck out too much flavor-wise in this recipe. Having said that, it was good. I let it simmer for 2 hours to thicken it up, but felt it was missing something. I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and about a cup of shredded cheddar, which made it nice and creamy. I also added celery and carrots. Good recipe, I will make again but probably will try replacing the sausage with ground chicken or turkey. Thanks :)

I used this as a great recipe to throw in some leftovers - used just a little sausage, added pureed yellow squash and acorn squash.  Used just a splash of cream and a little cream cheese instead of evaporated milk.
Awesome meal for cold weather!

This was excellent!  The only thing is,,I ended up draining the potatoes, therefore not having any "broth"!  Stupid me.  So I added chicken broth and had to boil it again..Think next time I'll boil in the broth.  Very tasty!  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe and it makes a ton and freezes very well.  We used deer sausage in our chowder and like others, used chicken broth to up the flavor.

I served this to the family, and it was a big hit!  Like some of the others suggested I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added a bit of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up. What great flavor! I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!!  I didn't have marjoram so i just added some paprika and a pinch of old bay.  Just before serving I added a scoop of sour cream and a small hand full of sharp cheddar cheese.  It was awesome!  my 6 year old even loved it and he is very very picky!!

This was just ok for me.  I followed the recipe exact, except I used spicy chicken sausage instead of pork sausage.  The recipe still seemed like it was missing something though.  However, I shared leftovers with my parents, and they really enjoyed it. I think I just missed my traditional family recipe that uses bacon.  Pretty good though.

This was way better than I thought it would be.  Even better when I topped the bowl with a little cheese.  I did ad some corn starch to thinken it up a bit. but other then that, the recipe was right on.

I cooked the sausage and then put all the ingredients in a crockpot and let it cook for a few hours.  It was good, but to me it was a little bland.  I ended up adding 2 cups of cheese, which really helped.  I think next time I make this I will substitute ham for the sausage and add carrots and peas or green beans.  It was good and hearty and great for dipping soft bread into.

This is a pretty good chowder.  Ive never made anything in terms of chowder but this is pretty good.  I didnt peel the potatoes though and I used turkey sausage instead of the pork variety.  Very good flavor.

This was pretty good but not fabulous.  I think it would have been boring without the sausage and that the flavor from the sausage is what kind of "made it."

This was tasted bland to me . The only way I saved it is was by taking everyone's suggestion and adding cheese and more spices. Maybe it was the milk base... I don't know ... its just did not appeal to me.

My children liked this soup.  I used smoked sausage instead and it turned out fine.  I also used oregano instead.  I prefer it without sausage, so next time will cook half with and half without.  But for the children, they had two bowls each and want it again soon.  Worth a try if you love corn, which we do :)
