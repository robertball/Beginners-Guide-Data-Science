WOW, this drink is absolutely great!!  I made it last night, used 2 oz of the rum instead of the 1.5, didn’t taste the alcohol at all.  This is a good uh oh drink for me, very tasteful and easy to make! I did something a little different, I got frozen cranberry and pineapple juice and premixed them together already in a large container,  so I can just pour the alcohol in a tall glass then add the juice on top, worked fantastic, and I didn’t even need to stir.

This drink is awesome, almost tastes like a mango drink, if you add 1/2 ounce of grape as well.

this is really good. I'm on my second glass now. Its very smooth, you don't really taste the rum. My first glass i used 4oz of cranberry juice (kept the pineapple the same) since i'm not a big drinker and don't really care for the taste of  alcohol so this was perfect. with using the 2oz of the cran juice for the second glass its still isn't alcohaly but you feel the tingle more. Its very nice. I can see it'd be easy over indulging on these.
