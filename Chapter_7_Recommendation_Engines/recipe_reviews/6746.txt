AWESOME!  The name is misleading because this doesn't taste like cake at all.  taste's like a wonderful yeast bread.  this went into my real recipe box! BEWARE: after cooking the first 20 minutes at 425 it was DONE!  don't burn it!

Great bread! No one in our family needs to eat low-fat foods, so we used full-fat sour cream and whole milk. This probably made the texture and taste of the bread even better than it was supposed to be, but oh well. The finished loaf looked a little strange (It didn't quite fill out the whole bundt pan) but the taste was very ,very tasty, and the texture was moist and very soft. It is a hit with my family, and I'll be making it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is good bread, but could use some clarification as to its true identity. Next time I will lightly knead in a swirl of cinnamon and brown sugar to make it like cinnamon bread.

Delicious. Because some people thought it was too sweet, i used 2T brown sugar. And because there were problems with dryness (and because it is easier to slice as a loaf!)i took the liberty of baking mine in a regular loaf pan. Worked great. 

I baked mine in a 9x5" loaf pan at 375Â°, for 25 minutes, like a regular loaf of bread. 

It is delicious. 

Thank you for this recipe.

I used full fat ingredients and regular brown sugar. I baked mine a little too long (25 minutes, but I'm going to guess my oven bakes a little hot) so it more brown and has a crust unlike the one in the photo of the recipe. It's still good, but better fresh from the oven or re-heated with butter/margarine. I think the recipe is called a 'cake' bread as the method of bringing together the ingredients (notably the ingredients in different amounts with others could be used to make a cake) and the fact that it is baked in bundt add to the 'cake' factor. This takes some time to rise, though mine didn't rise much the second time (guess I didn't wait long enough) but it also doesn't bake up into the whole pan, FYI. Had egg whites and sour cream to use, wasn't disappointed.

This cake was somewhat dry. I wouldn't eat it by itself. I also couldn't tell if it was a dessert or a side dinner bread that is somewhat sweet. I probably won't make it again.
