I made this to accompany burgers at our barbecue and a lot of people had seconds. The salad didn't get to chill longer then two hours before we served it and I felt like it really needed to sit longer. I had some the next day for lunch and it tasted much better. Next time I make this I will make it the night before so that the flavors have time to meld together. I substitued tri-colored spiral pasta because I think it adds to the presentation of the salad. I also added some plum tomatoes sliced in half and I added a small sweet yellow pepper diced. Do not skimp on the spinach in this recipe. It adds a wonderful flavor and color to the pasta salad. Very tasty recipe!

Super! Delicious! If you have a small to medium red onion slice the whole thing...if it is a HUGE red onion do half ...besides that stick with the directions and you will have a perfect filling salad with just the right amount of seasonings. I used Ken's Italian Dressing with Parmesan and it added greatly ....I have already been asked to pass the recipe along...thanks for the contribution!

I brought this to a potluck for my running club and watched it disappear.  I used whole wheat corkscrew pasta, however, and it added a nice texture.  Use the biggest bowl you have to mix--until the spinach breaks down in the dressing the volume is enormous.

This was delicious, though a bit bland until I added a few extras. We use ricotta salata instead of Feta, sweet vidalia onion instaed of red onion (didn't have a red onion on hand), added a bit more salt and garlic powder and we made our own dressing from the juice of an additional lemon and some good olive oil. I'm sure if I had used the Feta, we would not have needed the salt but my daughter is anti-feta cheese! Thanks for submitting! Oh, the next day I added some grilled chicken breast to the leftovers and had lunch.

8/12/10 update: It came out even better the second time! Needed it for a pool party. Cooked the pasta early in the day, mixed in 1/2 C of the italian dressing (used bottled this time), the red onion, grated the lemon & added it along with the lemon juice. The grated lemon added SO much flavor! Then I added the  olives, s/p and garlic powder. Let it rest in the fridge all day. I also shredded the ricotta salata and washed and dried the baby spinach in tha early moring & put in the fridge. Near dinner time I only added another 1/4 C of dressing, chopped the fresh spinach & added that & the shredded cheese, tossed it well and was done. It got rave reviews from EVERONE as well as many requests for the recipe!

Perfect pasta salad.  A tip on the onions:  After chopping, put in a sieve or colander and run cold water over them for 30 seconds, as that will take the "bite" out of them and won't be as overpowering the next day.  Thanks Kim for the great recipe.

I mixed the pasta salad together and put it in the fridge to wait a few hours before adding the spinach, as another reviewer recommended.  But my family started helping themselves before the spinach ever got added.  They loved it.  I had used Greek salad dressing instead of italian and added some chopped up sliced pepperoni.  It was so yummy I may just keep this as my Greek Pasta Salad recipe and just forget about the spinach ingredient.  Thanks.

This was a great, fresh salad.  I used only about 3/4 of the recommended dressing, and don't put it on too far in advanced because the spinach wilts.  Also I added four chopped up tomatoes, which added extra color and flavor.  Yum!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! It was a hit at brunch.I got a lot of great feedback. I made a few changes. I used about half of a small red onion(less is better). I love  feta cheese so I used an 8 oz container and I used 3/4c.of the italian dressing.

This was an excellent accompaniment to our Easter meal of oven roasted lamb with lemon-pepper seasoning!  I modified the recipe somewhat by using 16 oz of pasta, 1 small can of sliced black olives, and 4 oz of tomato-basil feta cheese. This is a recipe that is sure to become a family favorite and will be wonderful for summer barbecues and potlucks since it can be made ahead of time and looks so pretty and tastes great!!

Wonderful salad! Perfect to take to a pot luck. Leftovers are even better as the pasta takes on all the flavors. Very healthy and tons of flavor!

I'm so mad that I found this recipe at the end of summer. I would have made it all summer long if I'd discovered it sooner. This had so much flavor and it was even better the next day. I don't know if my garlic was extra potent but it was a little garlic-y. I did not use canned olives but instead went to Whole Foods and got marinated black olives from the bulk section. They have so much more flavor and taste fresher then the canned stuff.

My kids loved it. I used wishbone's balsamic vinaigrette. I added pepperoni. I think that next time I will make 2 batches, one without onions and olives, because some of my kids didn't like them, and one with all the good stuff. Other than that it was very very good. My 10 year old said that the feta cheese was what made it really good. My 12 year old can't stop eating it!

Well, frankly I was disappointed with this and I’m not quite sure why.  I did add some chopped tomato for a little more color.  I thought the spinach would wilt more than it did, so if I make this again, I’ll be sure to chop my spinach a little smaller.  Hubs is great about eating leftovers, but never went back and ate any more of this.  Sorry.

I love this recipe.   The second time I made this salad the only changes I made was to make the night before minus adding 07/15/15 the spinach.  I also added grated Parmesan cheese and 5 oz. lightly toasted pine nuts in evoo.  Mix all together and refrigerate overnight. Add spinach to avoid wilting the next day.  Excellent left overs if you are lucky enough to have any.  UPDATE 07/15/2016:  try using penne pasta and buy Boar's Head creamy Feta cheese crumbles....no need to add any other cheese.  Be sure to add lightly browned pine nuts and it is so perfect.

I changed the recipe somewhat.  I used whole wheat penne pasta, cut up one chicken breast,and  some shredded parmesan cheese. I also used Extra Virgin olive oil instead of Italian dressing. It was very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Really liked this.  I did not add much more seasoning to the salad dressing because I thought my dressing had enough garlic flavor.

Yummy! I just made this for dinner. I added some dried basil because I didn't have the flavored feta, and some leftover grilled steak (sliced thin), and a few bacon crumbles. Thanks for the great summer dinner salad. Traditional spinach salad is great, but this is a nice change that will remain in my rotation.

This is a simple basic pasta salad recipe.  You can add any veggies you have on hand to change this up.  I usually throw in something extra veggie wise.  Make with your veggies of choice, but I would not leave out the spinich!

Very Good! I have made several times.  I prefer Ken's Italian style dressing and I usually add spiced up chicken to make it a meal. I also use kalamata olives instead of black olives.  Just make sure they're pitted!  Even better the next day after the flavors have all combined.

I felt like a Martha Stewart clone when I finished making this salad.  It has great presentation and looks healthy.  Tastes good too!
It seems to be forgiving if you add/decrease any of the ingredients. Thanks Kim!

I made this as a sidedish for a family BBQ and I'm already hearing "Bring that pasta salad w/ the spinach."  I thought it was too strong on the onion so next time I'm going to reduce that a bit.

My kids adore spinach and pasta, so this was a double treat for them as well as for us. As usual, I always add more seasonings but we all really loved this Kim!

This was really good! I need a recipe in a hurry to bring to a work potluck lunch the next day. I took someone's suggestion and grated the lemon zest (about half the lemon) and added that in with the lemon juice. Great idea! I only used half the red onion (I'd say maybe 1/3 cup) bc I didn't want onion overpowering the salad. I also used the full 4oz container of feta and found that was the perfect amount. The only real change I made was to add in a half jar of sundried tomatoes, chopped. They added a lovely flavor!  I mixed the salad the night before, minus the spinach and about 1/3 of the dressing. An hour before the lunch, I added in the chopped spinach and the remaining dressing.  Out of 8 ppl at the lunch, I had 3 asking for the recipe and everyone commented that they liked it.  Great recipe!

Very good. I'm bringing this to a pot luck tomorrow-I think I'll be the guest with the rave reviews! Thank you!  Tweaked your recipe just a little: I left out the black olives (personal preference), added 3 chopped Roma tomatoes, and used 6oz of light feta.  I added a little chopped fresh basil and a couple of chopped leaves of fresh mint. I love being able to go out to my garden at this time of year and just pick a little fresh herbs:)

This was really good. It is a very versatile recipe where you could add anything you like in a pasta salad. I used penne pasta. I decreased the salad dressing to 1/2 cup to reduce the fat. It was still excellent. I used Ken's Italian Dressing with Romano cheese. I recommend adding the spinach just before serving to prevent wilting. Next time I will add some boiled eggs. I did add a jar of pimientos for color. Yum!

I am not normally a pasta salad fan because of the cold pasta thing, but this one was really good. I substituted artichokes for the olives, used half the garlic, and it turned out great... perfect side dish for a BBQ and includes lots of healthy spinach!

very good. I would use less garlic and onion next time though---cut them in half! although very good as is ---you can count on having  bad breath for at least a week after eating this! If you plan on getting close to anyone make sure they eat this delicious salad too!

The only thing worth changing is the amount of red onion, less is better,  other than that make it just as the recipe goes.  And add the spinach with other ingredients. I tossed it later and it was not done enough.

This salad was okay but a little disappointing. I followed directions exactly except holding off on adding spinach just before serving like some reviewers suggested. That was unnecessary.  It made enough for two meals for us so even though I was expecting the spinach to be wilted the next day, it wasn't.  I just didn't like the dressing on this so maybe that's the source of my disappointment.  I used a low calorie Italian because I have to eat low fat and found it to be a bit tart.  I will try again though and use a different dressing.

I made this at Christmas using Christmas Farfalle pasta. The main complaints about this dish was that it had WAY too many olives & dressing. I LOVE black olives but you could easily cut the olives in half & be ok. I would also say you'd be fine halving the Italian dressing too or at least cut it by a quarter cup. I'll try to make it again & see how it fares. I LOVE the feta cheese it calls for. It smells amazing.

Great recipe! I followed a few other suggestions by adding a bit of salami, a lot of shaved parmesan, and halved grape tomatoes. I wanted my dish to look just like Morupe's! Superb flavor!  These added ingrediants just enhanced the flavor it would have had without them. A keeper!

This pasta salad was a hit with my family.  I added yellow pepper and grape tomatoes to the salad.  I also used fat free Italian salad dressing.  The longer this salad sits the better it tastes.  I'll definitely be making this again!

My son and husband said they really liked it and my husband asked me to make it once a week. I used Wishbone Just 2 good dressing to cut back on fay and calories. I also used a small can of sliced olives to cut back on fat & calories. I would have used reduced fat feta but I couldn't find it.

Was a last minute addition to my 4th of July spread and it was a BIG Hit!  Very tasty and easy.

I really like this recipe. The first time I followed directions exactly other than adding some cherry tomatoes. My husband and I ate all of it within two days. Since then I have tried different varations with great success.  Today I added artichokes (marinated) and will get feedback at a family reunion tomorrow. It is a fun recipe to play with and always good.

Loved it!  Used the dressing per the recipe.  It was very garlicy, but we all loved it.  Guess it depends on your preference.  I also added cucumber, yellow pepper and a little bit of salami.  I especially loved that I could make this ahead of time.  Kids used parmesan cheese instead of feta.

Very, very good!! I recommend adding the pasta last, after the dressing breaks the spinach down some. This way it makes the mixing a little easier.

Very good salad. I made it as directed except I did use mozzarella instead of feta because none of us care for it. The garlic was a bit overwhelming. I will probably cut back a bit but other than that we loved it!

Wish I'd read some of the suggestions before making for a potluck. Too much onion! I did scoop out about a half a cup when I saw how much I was adding, but it still wasn't enough. Also, 4 cloves of fresh garlic was too much, regardless of how big of a garlic fan you are. Next time I will probably cut down on everything except the pasta and spinach. But ingredient-wise, it was a great recipe! Just need to do some adjusting for next time.  :-)

Absolutely Delicious!  A whole onion is too much though.  Next time I'll try a sweet variety of onion and only use half.  I also want to try adding cherry tomatoes like other reviewers said, that sounds really good!

This is sooooooooooo yummy! It is such a nice change from eating the typical pasta salad...the ingredients blend so well together! Definitely adding this to my recipe book!! Can't wait to make this in the summer for my potluck bbq's! :) 

It was even better the second day after all the flavors had combined completely and the onions had softened a little bit and lost their bite. 


The only thing I might change is adding a little more dressing and cheese (I LOVE feta), and maybe adding cherry tomatoes (but only because I like tomatoes...it was great without, too!)

Super easy and delicious! I added pancetta, fresh basil leaves and a copped fresh tomato! Also, I only used half of the salad dressing.  I figured I could add more but it was plenty.

It calls for WAY too much onion. I wouldn't try this again, but if I did I would probably exclude the onion completely. It tasted so out of place.

I have made this recipe twice now. I make my own Italian dressing, but the rest I pretty much followed. My kids usually start the protest as soon as they see the green stuff, but they gobbled this up before remembering to ask what the "green stuff" was. We really love this recipe and we don't mind the wilty spinach the next day, it's still yum!

I love this salad!  My family wasn't as enthusiastic, but maybe it was too heavy on the cheese.  I put in the full 5oz. block of feta and it was a little much.  I also followed a reviewer's advice and added artichoke hearts.  I'll be making this again (with the right amount of feta).

I made this salad for our father's day picnic (with only 7 people) and it was nearly all gone!!!! We couldn't stop eating it. I made my dressing from an Italian dressing package (using extra virgin olive oil/vinegar vs. bottled dressing) and I also added mushrooms. The combo of flavors in this dish is excellent!!!!!!  I will save this as a favorite.  Thank you:)

This was great!  I made as listed with the exception of using one recipe of "homemade" Italian sald dressing--such as Good Seasons with the packets instead of just one cup, and I used 10 oz spinach.  So fresh tasting and yummy!  Great for a change from heavy mayo based pasta salads.  Thanks!

Love it! I used Paul Newman's Lite Lime Vinaigrette instead of Italian dressing and it gave it this great lite tang. I found it best to dress the cooked bowtie pasta, then let that cool. That gives a nice amount of dressing.

This is a beautiful salad with lots of flavor! All of the adults enjoyed it at the family dinner I brought it to this evening. I am not really sure about the kids. I loved the colors and the strong flavors of the lemon, garlic and cilantro. I doubled the feta cheese. I am also glad I read the reviews and made the salad last night, so that it had about 24 hours for the flavors to blend. I was worried about the spinach getting soggy, but it didn't. I actually added half the spinach last night and the rest just before serving, but could have added it all last night and it would have been fine. Great addition to my list of favorite salads!

One batch of this makes a lot! More than 8 servings as the recipe says.  I made this for a crowd of 20 as a side dish and had a couple servings left over. It was great...lots of compliments.

This was a fun mix of tastes; However, next time I will cut back on the red onion, or else leave it out altogether. Same with the fresh garlic; The taste is very strong. Nice change of pace for a pasta salad, though. Thank you for the recipe!

I haven't actually tried this recipe yet but it sure looks delish.
Seems like grape tomatoes and salami were added for the picture and maybe should be added to list of ingredients.

Something that I've learned from this website is that the ones that have lots of high ratings are usually recipes that can be fudged and still turn out delicious.  I took the ingredient list and matched it the best I could with what I had on hand (in smaller amounts).  I used another AllRecipe recipe for the Italian dressing.  I think the thing that really gives it kick is the fresh garlic!  I pressed a large clove into the salad and Yeeee-um!!  I've already recommended it to a friend who is expecting.  So give it a shot, I think you'll like it too.

This was fantastic! My friends loved it. I used a little extra feta and less onions. I also used a greek style Italian dressing and used less than called for so it wasn't too strong.

I tried making this for a party at home.
It is really easy and all who love salad raved about it.  The variations I made was adding sun dried tomatoes and using the spiral pasta instead of the bow tie ones.
The salad tastes even better the day after.
Will definitely do this again :)

This is so YUMMY!!! I made it without spinach (unfortunatly) but it was still delicious! I will make it again for sure!  I agree to cut the red onion by half and add 3 garlic cloves instead of 4 to the dressing so it isn't so strong.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Another great salad to my recipe collection. I added tomatoes, some cooked chicken and ham (my leftovers from fridge), used garlic/herb feta cheese and green onions instead of red(all I had). My husband had seconds. Great for hot summer days. Thanks.

I made this salad for a casual BBQ and it was a hit.  The only change I would make would be to use less red onion.  A great dish if you need to add color to your table.

I made this recipe last night for company.  It was a big hit.  It has great flavor and is healthy.  I used reduced fat feta and light italian dressing and it came out fine.  I loved it and plan to make it again for our next bbq!

This recipe is awesome.  It's got so much flavor - very addictive.  I've brought it to a couple functions and it's always been a big hit.  It makes a large amount so you need a crowd to eat it.  I think it is great the next day too.  I love the garlic in it but if you don't you might cut it down some. Thanks for the great recipe!

This salad is FABULOUS! I've made 3 times this summer to rave reviews AND sent extra home with guests. Many requests for recipe. I've incorporated others' suggestions for artichoke hearts, red or orange bell pepper, and halved grape tomatoes. Yum!!

This salad was better the day after making it.  The flavors came together quite well.  Adding cubed salami or cheese would also be good.

This recipe was just "ok" so I am wondering if maybe I should have used a different Italian salad dressing since it has so many 5 stars. I used Wishbone Italian. Next time I'll use something else. I did double the feta and next time will use a bit less onion.

Absolutely a major hit every time I make it for a party or BBQ.   I always add cherry tomatoes for a bit of color, and sometimes if I do not have feta on hand I sub mozzarella and throw in some basil.  Every variation is delicious.  So good!

It was just OK.  I think it could have used a big jar of chopped marinated artichoke hearts and the liquid instead of the Italian-style dressing and lemon juice.   I did add lemon zest to it along with the lemon juice.
I thought the farfalle too large a pasta for the dish,  I think I'd use rotelle or seashell pasta instead.  Doubtful I'll make again.

Made this for a block party we were going to this summer.  LOTS of salads at the party, this one was gone FIRST and in record time!  I usually read most of the reviews to see what changes folks have made but try not to stray too much from the recipe.  This one is such a great base and can add your own personal likes to it.  I eliminated the feta, olives and cloves of garlic, only because of personal taste.  Did only use a half a red onion, that was more than plenty.  I, too, added fresh basil to the dressing because we LOVE it and it was great but you wouldn't need it to have this still be yummy.  I also added some fresh chopped red and yellow peppers.  DELISH!!!  I also made it again a few weeks later cause the hubby requested and we had it for leftovers for 3 straight nights and it was still great!  A really good dish for a party or potluck!

Excellent salad!The dressing was great. I forgot to mix the dressing ingredients all together before I mixed it in and I left out the cloves of garlic. I just had regular feta so I added some fresh basil. Also added diced red pepper and diced salami.  Turned out fabulous.  The fresh lemon juice makes it.

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipie a bit and baked it in the oven. I made up until it said to chill it. I baked it in the oven for an hour or so. If you bake it, I reccomend using motzerela cheese because the feta didn't melt well and was rubbery. But over all, it was a great dish and eazy to make, as I am very young.

This was wonderful... everyone loved it. I used 5 ounces of feta cheese and only had garlic powder on hand, those are my only changes. So much better than the too saucey one at the deli. Would be great with chicken added to it.

This has become a family favorite.  My husband and three small boys eat it without complaint! I recently made it for a Birthday party, and everyone loved it. I always use more feta, less onion, and add a red or yellow bell, and sometimes chicken.  It tastes great as posted, but if you want to tweak the dressing try using half a lemon and add a heaping Tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar along with 1 teaspoon of sugar.

This is a fabulous salad.  I followed the recipe exactly and used Ken's Italian dressing as suggested, though I could not find Ken's Italian with Parmesan. I added some fresh Parmesan instead.   It is a very refreshing salad with a great flavors.  Love the garlic.    I had seven of my grown children visiting me on Sunday.  I asked each to take a taste.  To my amazement, one bite went to two and then the dishes came out.  That's impressive for my group.

I've made this pasta salad many times to rave reviews. its the perfect unique salad to bring to a BBQ.   I add sun-dried tomatoes and use a bit more feta than the recipe calls for.  For a main dish, I add cooked chicken.  However you make its great!

A different option for pasta or green salad. I used 6-8oz of flavored feta, 6oz of the black olives diced real small and used a parm olive oil dressing. I didnt think the salad stood up real well the next day, even after adding more dressing. Thought the spinch got soggy.

Absolutely delish!  My subs: 9 oz of regular-size spinach, plain feta (couldn't find the flavored), 1/2 red onion, 6 oz can black olives sliced in half, 4 tsp lemon juice.  As a side, this can easily serve 12, we had about half left over after serving 7.  Will be making this next weekend for my wedding reception.

My first review! This salad is amazing! I use Rotini pasta but that is personal preference. I also used Ken's Italian and Romano dressing is what I used. What an AWESOME recipe!

This recipe was wooonderful! I made 24 servings and left a little bowl for my husband. The salad went quicker than anything else and my husband asked me to make it again after he inhaled his bowl! This is an excellent way to get some serious nutrients into your diet!

I gave this 3 stars, not because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't anything special.  It was a salad - nothing exceptional, just a salad.  And personally to my taste, had WAY too much salad dressing on it.  Not good enough to make again, not even tweaked.

This is a really great summer salad.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used less onion and whole wheat spirals and it came out great.  I usually don't make pasta salad because it never tastes right but this one is going in my regulars.

This is my favorite go-to pasta salad. I like to use a balsamic vinegarette in place of the italian dressing. Always a hit!

I just made this last week and it was AMAZING!! Very easy, not time consuming, and I loved the fusion of the Mediterranean flavours together.  It even tasted great heated up the next day as then the tomatoes were warm and soft.  I put a little bit less of the italian dressing, perhaps I shall try it with the full amount next time.

Phenominal Recipe that got rave reviews from my peers!!  Instead of using the crumbled tomato basil feta cheese i substituted regular crumbled feta and I used fresh cherry tomatoes cut in halves as well as fresh basil....besides that made it look more like the picture too!!

Very easy to make.  I added some chopped mint to make it a bit more Greek.  But i stuck with the basic recipe, omitting the garlic salt.  The Lemon and the Garlic give it a very fresh taste.  This is something that i will make over and over.  Could be a fantastic meal on it's own or even add some shrimp or chicken.

This was an excellent pasta salad.I loved the taste and color that the spinach added. This salad lookes as good as it tastes! I doubled the amount of feta, omitted one clove of garlic from the dressing, and added salami. I'll be making this again for sure.

I have made this several times for company and everyone always loves it!  The only modifications I make are:  more feta; add some chopped red bell pepper for color; reduced onion to 1/2 small chopped red onion; and one small can of sliced black olives. Very good left over if you are lucky to have leftoevers.

This is the best pasta salad I have ever had! I took it to work and all of my coworkers raved about how delicious it was, and even better the next day. I added artichoke hearts, a few cut up strawberry tomatoes, and extra Feta cheese (you can never have enough cheese!). Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was excellent, flavorful, colorful and loved by all my guests. I used penne pasta and low fat salad dressing. My husband at the leftovers until it was gone.  He had suggested I get serve store bought, but I don't like store bought pasta salad.  He loves pasta salad and said this is the best he's ever had.  Definitely will make this again.

I made this recently for a potluck at work, and people are still asking me for the recipe.  It's very tangy, and it makes a great dish to take to a party or gathering.  Thanks, Kim, and I'll definitely make this again.

Yummy! I made this today and it was not only good but very pretty. Hubby kept commenting about how pleasing it looked with the red onion, green spinach and pasta. I can tell that this is going to be made a lot with the upcoming summer weather. Thank you.

This was a great salad.  Kids loved it, until their parents mentioned spinach, even so, most kept eating.  I had to make the recipe for 65 people, but there was just way too much.  Making it for a large crowd?  I'd go with 20-30 servings.

A good, basic recipe to work from. I roasted 3 red peppers, chopped into bite-size pieces and added (along with their sweet roasting juices). Substitued garlic powder for thew garlic salt, since bottled dressing has enough salt in it. You can double - or triple - the amount of feta, which also can be quite salty. Also, I feel mayonnaise-based pasta salads are OK to serve chilled, but to truly appreciate the flavors of this salad, you ahould make it the night before, add the spinach a few hrs. before you plan to serve it, and let it come to room temp. an hour or so before serving, stirring up from the bottom ocassionally. Overall, easy to make and good Meditteranean flavors.

I have made this three times in the last month because everyone requests it!  I use 16 ounces pasta and 6 ounces spinach because that is how the items are packaged, but the adjustment works out great!  Keeps very well and even as the spinach breaks down, the salad is still delicious.

Fast and easy salad, I made a recipe and a half for a picnic and did not have much left over.  I added grape tomatoes to the salad and regular feta cheese (I love feta so I added 8oz.).  My sister wanted the recipe right away and also added chicken to my changes.

One of my favorite pasta salads. Any time I have made it for other, I get multiple requests for the recipe. Adding chicken makes it a great all in one meal.

This Pasta Spinach salad was absolutely wonderful.Certainly easy to prepare and will serve a crowd.  I thought the left overs were still delicious even though the spinach became limp.  I read the reviews before preparing it and followed the advise of many to only use 1/2 of an onion.  The other change I made was that I used 4 ounces of the feta cheese.  Thanks for a delicious recipe Kim.

WOW!  Delicious salad!  I only made a few changes.  I used basil flavored rotini pasta, I used 2 small cans of sliced olives, I used 1/2 of a red onion which was plenty, and I added some of those tiny santa tomatoes.  I also used fat free italian dressing to make it a little lighter.  I recommend only dressing it one hour or less before serving or the spinach breaks down too much and gets too slimy.  But I will make this salad often.  All of the adults raved.  My 6 yo daughter thought it was too spicy, but my 9 yo son liked it.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I didn't have Italian dressing so I used Greek instead.  It was delicious & a big hit camping.  The most recent time I used Italian as the recipe calls for.  I have to admit, I didn't like it as much.  I am making it again today & going back to my Greek dressing.

I added less spinach since I liked it as more of a pasta salad with spinach. The dressing is important!  I have found the nicest complement is Newman’s Own Family style Italian dressing

Very versatile recipe.  I've made it a few different ways.  Kraft Herb and Garlic dressing worked great, as well.  letting it sit for at least a few hours is key.  Always a hit as a side dish!

Loved it. Like others have said, leave the spinach out until shortly before serving.  My fresh garlic wasn’t looking great so used granulated garlic.  I also added cherry tomatoes cut in half and about half a red onion. Other than that, basically followed recipe. 
I’ll be being making this a lot for family and friends. It is very versatile.  Will soon try it with chicken or shrimp.

I did not care for this salad.   I kept checking the recipe  I followed  to make sure I didn't miss anything because it was not good just really tangy.   Didn't care for the  texture of spinach and pasta mixed together either.

I would have really enjoyed this salad without the red onion.  I put the whole onion in and it just overpowered the salad.  Also, I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a little granulated garlic which was probably a good thing.  I tried to pick the onion out the second day but ended up throwing it away.  If I make it again I won't use any onion at all.

Definitely so much better in the fridge overnight. I was afraid to put in the spinach because it might get soggy, so I added it before serving as the other reviewers suggested. I think the what the original recipe suggested was much better to get the flavors together , so don’t be afraid to add the spinach in and marinade overnight!

The first time I tried this was at a luncheon and it took me forever to find a recipe.  I made this today and could hardly keep from eating it as I went.  I didn't add olives or onion, and once the required garlic and pepper were added I doubled it to taste.  So happy I happy I found this!

The addition of spinach was great. We try to avoid meat so this is a main dish for us. My hubby doesn't usually like cold pasta and he loved it. I don't like olives so I left those out and added cherry tomatoes from my garden.  This will become a regular.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe and added some sliced button mushrooms and diced pecans for some crunch.  I did as others and mixed all except the spinach the night before and added the spinach a couple of hours before the party.  It was a huge hit.

I made this with to go along with grilled chicken and everyone loved it.  I made it in the morning for dinner guests later that night.  I got compliments as it quickly disappeared.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe and so did family!  I adapted by the following:  added tomatoes, deli roast beef cut into strips, and used Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing with roasted garlic instead of making the Itallion dressing .  I'll be making it again this weekend.

Alright, I made this for a salad luncheon and yes, it was okay but this recipe really requires a ZESTY Italian vinegar and oil salad dressing.  The components are good and I will make it again but possibly a balsamic dressing something zippy.  People did appreciate that it was not overpowering pasta and not plain old spinach.  I also appreciate that it will be easy to halve.  By the way, do not chop your olives to small they get lost if you do.

A keeper fer sure!  I pretty much made as is except using only half a red onion as the one I had was ginormous.  I also added cherry tomatoes which added to both flavor and color.  Also, if you use a 16 oz. box of pasta (why do recipes with pasta always seem to call for 12 oz. when boxes come in 16???) make sure to add 16 oz. of spinach, chopped for eating ease.  A really tasty summer salad.

This is so delicious. I didn't have fresh garlic or garlic salt so I used 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder. and 1/2 tablespoon of dried basil and plain feta. I will be making this all summer!

I love making this for BBQs. As other reviewers have said, it's a HUGE salad because of the spinach, so you'll need a big bowl. I omit the olives, and add chicken sausage to make it heartier (which makes it a meal if you have any leftovers!).

This is a great salad. Serve it along side any meat and it will surely compliment your meal. The longer it sits the better is tastes. Doesn't take a lot of time to make. This is a keeper.

I am not good at cooking, and I usually don't like pasta salad, but I decided to give this a try.  It's really easy & delicious.  I don't eat cheese, and I added cherry tomatoes.  I use only 1/2 lemon because I don't like sour taste.  It is best after one day in the refrigerator.

Great recipe. I sub'd green olives and used light dressing and whole grain pasta instead. Seemed like a lot of dressing too so we just used enough to cover everything.

I could have eaten all of this by myself!  I didn't add the garlic salt because I felt it had enough salt.  I used Paul Newman's Family Recipe Italian dressing.  A very small red onion was plenty of onion.  I used all of the other ingredients, but measurements were approximate and according to personal preference.  I added a bunch of quartered grape tomatoes for color and added sweetness.  Super yummy and very popular at my daughter's birthday party!

This can be a main meal with a addition of turkey bacon or lean ham. It's so easy. The suggestions about reducing the onion and using high quality dressing like Newman's or making your own is a must. I avoid dairy so I put in walnuts or pine nuts for that extra zip when I'm not adding the bacon or ham. The trick with this is using a seasoning mix when you want to "spice" it up -- try Mexican or Creole or even one of the no salt varieties… my favorite is Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning. Whatever you do, mix everything but the spinach together really well, then add it to the leaves -- bruised yucky spinach if you don't!

This recipe was good yesterday when I made it, but wonderful today after it sat overnight.  I think that's the key to this one - it needs to sit overnight for the flavors to meld.  I used Kalamata olives instead of black (what I had on hand) and used homemade Italian dressing instead of bottled.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and cut the onion amount down to half.

The Best spinach and pasta salad. Every time we made it for a party, it was the first to go, and some even asked for the recipe. We eliminated the olives & red onion, and it was very tasty without them. Add grilled chicken, and you have a light, tasty meal.

This was delicious! My family of 8 all liked it. I made some changes based on what I had available.  Instead of feta cheese I used asiago. I also added cooked crumbled bacon and fresh chopped tomatoes.  With some salt and pepper the entire dish was gone that night!

Loved this recipe!  Not a fan of feta so I made the following changes and it was a huge hit.  I used shredded parmesan; chopped cherry tomatoes; added Basil to the dressing.  This was so good even my mom loved it.

Loved it.  I added Salami and bacon bits.  For the Salad dressing I used Olive Garden's Italian dressing.  I also doubled the feta cheese, because we love it.  AMAZING!!!!!

Delicious! I added some yellow and red peppers and used parmesan cheese in place of the feta cheese because that's what I had on hand. Great recipe!

I served this at a birthday party and everyone loved it. I will reduce the amount of garlic the recipe called for, but that's just for my preference. Great recipe!! Thanks!!

Good recipe, quick and easy.  I used tri-color spirals, and added a chopped tomato.  I will have to tone down the onion next time, and use a milder italian dressing (I used robusto).  I love the addition of spinach.

Delicious!! I added lots of chopped grape tomatoes and deleted the olives (not a fan of them). Will use this for future potlucks, I'm sure. Thanks!

Fantastic salad... and very easy to make.  Just mix all of the ingredients together thoroughly.  I also added one thinly sliced carrot just b/c I had it and it was a good addition!

This is a fabulous and healthy pasta salad.  I have been making it almost every week since I tried it 4 weeks ago.  I recommend adding your faborite veggies to change it up a bit.  I have added sun dried tomatoes, black olives, etc. Thanks for the great recipe!

It turned out really really spicy. I think an entire red onion may be too much. Other wise it was okay. Next time I might add some tomatoes or some more cheese and less onion and italian dressing.

This was SO good and easy. I added some already cooked chicken strips to it to make it a little heartier for my guests. It is very good without, too. Both friends loved it and had seconds and my husband and I finished it for dinner. He requested that I make it again. Thanks for sharing.

I used Spanish green olives instead of black, but it would be good with black or kalamata olives too. Perfect pasta salad!

good, easy standby for a picnic in the park.  i doubled the feta, and used a few roma tomatoes as well...  its pungent, so be sure to have some breath mints on hand.  :)
