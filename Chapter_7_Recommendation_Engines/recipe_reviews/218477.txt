I like using the pineapple juice and Italian salad dressing as a marinade.  I divided the  marinate and marinated the vegetables in one zip lock bag, the chicken in another and the shrimp in a third bag.  The chicken and the vegetables are fine to marinate for 8 hours or overnight but vinegar in the dressing will start to cook the shrimp.  I only marinate shrimp for about 30 minutes max.   Also when skewering I didn't put shrimp and chicken on the same skewer - shrimp cooks so much faster than chicken and it would be impossible to cook both properly on the same skewer.  I tossed the marinade from the chicken the shrimp and used the marinade from the vegetables to baste the skewers with.  One less pan to wash.  Toss the bags and clean up is easy.  Thanks for a bright and colorful recipe.

This was delishious! I didn't have canned pineapple. So I didn't put the pineapple and pineapple juice in the marinating bag. I used fresh pineapple and put it on the kabobs with the other food at the end before grilling. instead of throwing it in the marinating bag. Yummy!
