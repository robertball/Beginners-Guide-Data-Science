I didn't change a single thing and it was fabulous! Light & fluffy texture, with dark DARK chocolatey goodness. Sooooo Yummmmy! I no longer shall rely on boxes.  This was soooo easy and sooooo gooood! It was HUGE! It fluffed up way over the 9X13 pan!  Marvelous!  Didn't even wait til it was cool to dig in & cake stayed high and proud. This will be my new go-to favorite choc cake!

Leave it to the south to come up with cavity sweet, but crowd pleasing desserts!  This is the poster recipe for that genre.  Delicious!  I did change the recipe, but only to fit my pantry.  Here's what I did.  Instead of 1 cup water, I replaced it with a cup of strong black coffee.  Then I used all butter instead of shortening and margarine.  I melted the butter in the coffee with 3 ounces of bitter chocolate instead of cocoa.  Next for the liquid ingredients, I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  Now for the icing:  I once again replaced the cocoa with 3 ounces of bitter chocolate which I melted with the butter before adding the confectioners sugar.  I cut the confectioners sugar down to 3 cups and used sour cream instead of milk.  Finally, I toasted the pecans and spread them on half of the warm cake.  That way I could offer the non-nut (blasphemy) side to those who do not like nuts.  Then poured the hot icing over all. This cake is too die for!  Or at least to blow your diet for!!!!

This cake was simply fabulous. I made it for a family dinner and there wasn't a piece left and I was passing out recipes for this cake left and right. I just don't understand people who call desserts too sweet - desserts are sweet! I used real butter instead of margarine.

Death by chocolate...mmm!! I replaced the shortening with butter because I didn't have any shortening and it was still great.  Next time I will poke holes in the cake before pouring the frosting on because a lot of it went to the sides due to the cake rising in the middle. I think the frosting will be distributed more evenly that way.

I followed the direction to a tee also. We get together on Monday evenings with friends and play cards. We all take turns making some sort of snack/eats and a dessert. I brought this cake up for everyone to try and they Loved it. I also had my fair share. This cake will definitely take care of a sweet tooth! I am going to bake another for this Memorial  weekend. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!! Glen.

This is a fun recipe.  The best part is pouring the chocolate pecan topping over the cake and watching it ooze into it.  I used whole wheat flour and the cake itself was very heavy.  Moist, but heavy.  Was it the flour?  I do know that everyone liked the topping.

This recipe is almost identical to a recipe that has been in my family for many years.   It is easy and delicious!  The only real difference is that we use a 11" x 18" jellyroll pan, and it bakes in  about 15 minutes.

I had this recipe back in the sixties and had misplaced it.  So glad to find this as no other recipe can match it.  I believe my recipe called for cinnamon so I added about 1/2 t. to the cake batter. I also cut back about 1/2 cup of sugar in my cake batter.  It is still delightfully sweet with that wonderful chocolate icing.   (I also toast my pecans for all my deserts and desert breads.  So delicious.)  I served this to guests recently and they all wanted the recipe  The ultimate compliment.  One reviewer on this site asked if the substitution of wholewheat flour for white made it heavy and the answer is yes.  This is one recipe I wouldn't make any substitutions with.

Very good cake, but icing was a little too sweet.  Next time, will cut down on powdered sugar.

I made this for a Thanksgiving family get together and everyone loved it. I dont normally cook desserts but this went off with out a problem. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use butter in the place of margarine as it was not available at grocery store because of the holiday rush.  I had a cousin ask for the recipe as it reminded her of her mothers wet cake.  Very tasty and very happy with this  recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written and wowie wow wow! Delicious!  With a toddler running around, I wasn't sure the extra steps would work out for me especially with the ease of making a box cake.  BUT the taste does not even compare so the very few extra minutes it takes to prepare is beyond worth it!  I was afraid it would come out too sweet, as some reviews mentioned, however, I thought it was perfect! Not too sweet but enough for it to be a more special dessert! I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again! Warning! Make sure you take this to be devoured by a crowd or you and your husband (wife, child, family, etc) will eat the entire pan yourselves in only a few days!

This version requires a bit of work, but if one follows the recipe EXACTLY the result is well worth the effort.  I served this cake for dessert at a dinner party, and my guests devoured it! 
If you grew up in the South, especially Texas, you will remember this "sheet" cake as the one served at almost every church potluck. 
I know some of the recipes on this site call for the addition of cinnamon to the batter, but my grandmother never added that spice to this particular cake. I might try the  cinnamon version someday, but really, why mess with perfection?

One of the best cakes I've ever made. Melts in your mouth. I used butter rather than margarine as the only change.

I've made this before, Toast the pecans. Adds so much flavor to the frosting. My favorite cake to make, even better if you wait the next day or so to eat it.

Delicious! This is very similar to a Coca-Cola cake, but calls for less ingredients. This cake is fantastic and it's now going to be my go to chocolate cake from now on. Everyone loved it!

I made this a couple years ago for either Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner and am making it again today for Thanksgiving dinner at my nephews today.  I also have looked at the other recipes on here like this one and this one is the best of all in my opinion.  So moist and very easy to make too.  I agree with poking holes in the cake to let the gooey frosting goodness seep into the cake.  This time I didn't have any buttermilk on hand but we can switch that up with some white vinegar and milk to substitute and it works :)  Try this one folks....well worth it!

Made this cake yesterday and it's s excellent.  Used a large kitchen spoon to mix it, didn't even have to take mixer out.  I must say I found the cake to be heavy and dense.  The kind that just sticks to the roof of your youth.  The frosting was easy and quick and that was good too.  Really the gooey kind that just runs all over the cake.
Guess you can tell by now, WE LOVED IT!
