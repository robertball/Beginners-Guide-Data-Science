It's not corn starch but tapioca starch that is used in this recipe.  That will make a big difference in the taste and texture.

I am Brazilian and I tweeked this recipe to make it easier and less fat. I added only 1/2 tsp of salt. I used no fat greek yogurt and Low Fat Crumbled Feta Cheese. I did NOT use water and I did not boil anything. I simply mixed all the ingredients. The trick to make it puff is to really knead it. Without water it makes a very thick dough that you can knead some more and then  roll into little balls. It takes only 15 minutes baking on a greased baking sheet. Do not let it brown.

These are a great base - although eaten strictly as made, they are also yummy and cheesey.  I'll be adding some spices to zest them up next time, but it's a keeper.  I don't understand other reviewers who use the wrong ingredients and then give the recipe a poor rating when things don't turn out right.  Tapioca flour (tapioca starch) is readily available in pretty much every grocery store.

I used this for a pizza crust and bread sticks.  It worked great. I sustituted olive oil, added salt, and finished with generously with garlic and parsley.  Pizza crust:  I spead the puffs into a greased pie pan with the outside rim being the thickest.  I browned the crust, filled with sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni and then cooked at 400F  Bread sticks:  In a greased 7 by 7 pan, I spread the mixture flat and topped with 1/4 cup mozzarella, sprinkled with garlic and parsley. Finished cooking just like the recipe directions.

LOVE IT.  You must used Tapioca starch. Anything else will not do this recipe justice. I love Pao De Queijo. If you are lucky you can find this prepackaged recipe in the supermarket. In the latin food section otherwise this recipe will make it pefect too.  Obrigada. (Thank you in Portuguese)

I made this recipe two times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very bland. The second time I added peppers, onions, spieces, and mushrooms, but the recipe still tasted funny. I think all of the corn starch makes the recipe have a strange taste and texture. I wouldn't make it again.

This is exactly what I was looking for! I LOVE the cheese puffs at my favorite Brazilian steak house. I love them almost as much as the steak! I am so happy I found this recipe. This is it! Exactly like the ones I love there. The hardest thing about this recipe was finding the tapioca starch. I ended up finding it at a local Asian market. Turned out it was really cheap too, like $1. I will say that I grated my own parmesan from a block, and it was a little strong. Next time I will try the parmesan from the green bottle or just reduce my own grated and up the mozzarella. There will definitely be a next time!

Made these exactly as written except I was out of mozzarella so I used white cheddar.  They came out nice and crispy on the outside, but soft and airy on the inside.  If you eat gluten free (or paleo-ish except dairy), these make great bread.  I will definitely make them again, and substitute various cheeses and other flavors.  ***As others have mentioned - it's TAPIOCA starch (or flour), NOT cornstarch.  I too am disappointed when people do not make a recipe as written and then give it a poor rating.

Mine didn't puff, otherwise I would probably give it 5 stars. From reading other reviews I knew the right starch was very important. I bought what was called "tapioca flour" but it also said "also known as tapioca starch" right on the package. I have no idea why they didn't puff

Great tasting and naturally gluten free.  One question on the recipe after trying twice is it is described as pouring the mixture into the muffin tins and mine had to be pulled apart and place in tins or on cookie sheet.  Is the recipe missing milk or something that would make it pourable?

If you're not following the metric version of the recipe take note that you should add more Mozzarella than Parm.  Fantastic recipe.  Didn't quite yield the amount stated, though.

I made this for a class party.  We needed a Brazilian food for 7-year-olds to try.  I used minute tapioca, which I think was a mistake.  The taste was good, but the texture was probably a little off.  I will find regular tapioca starch and make this again.

Perhaps I did it wrong.  When I cooked the cornstarch, it balled it.  After adding the cheese and working it a bit, the dough was more manageable.  However, the texture was never right after baked.  The flavor was fine.  I've seen recipes involving potato.  Perhaps that's the key.

These were absolutely delicious! I made one substitution, whipping cream for the yogourt, because i didn't have yogourt. I also added some italian seasoning...next time will either add dill or peppers. Will be making these again soon.

I love these! I haven't made them, but found them at a restaurant. I am so happy to have found this recipe so that I can try them! The only thing is, where does one find tapioca starch with which to make them?

A great recipe, and very easy. We tweaked the recipe by using grated cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, reducing the salt to 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon, adding 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and about 2 teaspoons of chopped rosemary.

These are fabulous!  They are exactly like what is served at Brazilian steakhouses.  So yummy (and addictive).  Make sure you use tapioca starch...not pearls or instant tapioca.  The starch is a powder that looks a lot like cornstarch, but it's finer.  I found it at the international farmer's market (it's not expensive at all).

These are very tasty, but I found the tapioca on the outside was very hard. Will try and soak them more before cooking.

Deliciously cheesy!  Made the mistake of using muffin/baking papers with the first batch and they stuck to the cheese and wouldn't peel off. The kids still ate the cheesy filing out and loved them. Ours didn't look as "puffy" as in the picture. Tasted great though!

Easy. Crusty outside and gooy inside. I thought they were a little bland. Not sure they were worth effort. Tapioca flour hard to find. Making it again. This time I added a sun dried tomatoe dipping sauce.  I will see how it goes.

While I followed the recipe as is, I found the texture quite chewy (which I like!), but wonder if it went wrong somewhere - no puffiness in sight...

These are amazing little appetizers.  I doubled the recipe and was able to fill two 24 count mini muffin pans.  Made them for two different parties and got rave reviews as well as requests for the recipe.  If you love cheese, you will love these!

ps. I found tapioca "flour" in the bulk foods section of the grocery store. (same consistency as cornstarch)

I liked these but they were quite a bit heavier than I was expecting because it was a cheese overload. I think next time I'll half the cheese so the puffs will be a little more airy and less calorie dense. I added one and half cloves of minced garlic and a teaspoon of dried basil to the oil and water and let that simmer together for about ten minutes. I also used olive oil instead of canola and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. With those adjustments I thought it tasted similar to Red Lobsters biscuits. Very yummy!

EDIT: I ended up halving the cheese and using just one clove of garlic this time and I think it turned out perfect! A little easier on the stomach and the palette. These will make a perfect snack for a long time to come.

Made this for my husband and didn't know that this was something his mother used to make for him when he was young.  The biggest compliment was for him to say that it tastes just like when his mother made it.  I made this exactly as the recipe states.  I loved them as well and have made them many times since!
