Warning -- you will eat so much of this you will feel sick!!!  Our family version of this recipe includes adding the juice of two lemons, cayenne pepper, cloves, and bay leaves to the water. Oh so good.

My family has always had lo' country boils and it's absolutely the best meal ever! A few "family hints": add 1 or 2 whole lemons (just cut them in half and drop 'em in), 2 or 3 medium size onions(quartered), two datil peppers (these are a florida thang) and leave the heads and shells on the shrimp for more flavor (wash them before cooking of course, but peel 'em on your plate. Although I have to admit, I like it when the heads aren't on - they look at me otherwise and I feel sorry for them!), You can omit the crabs if you want(or leave them in) or you can use whole crawfish like another review suggested. We also use the boil-in-bag bay seasoning..it's easier! 
This meal IS best served by dumping it in the middle of the table on newspaper and then everyone just grabs a paper plate and loads up! I promise you, you won't be sorry if you make these additions! 

Now THAT is a lo' country boil Florida style!

Awesome! I used 3/4 cup Old Bay to 6 quarts of water as per the Frogmore Stew recipe. I used turkey kielbasa (to cut down on the fat), shrimp, clams, sea scallops and a baby lobster tail per person. It was to die for! I suggest using a turkey fryer as it has the basket with holes in it and you don't have to worry about dumping out the water and keeping the food in the pot. You can't go wrong...add whatever seafood and spices you have and it's perfect. Wonderful recipe to feed a crowd!

The only MAJOR deviation I've found over the years from the recipe I use is to add the sausage toward the end, just before the shrimp, otherwise the pre-cooked sausage will be overcooked and split apart.  Otherwise, a great meal for any occasion! Go Dawgs!!!

Simply delicious. My hubby and I lived in the lowcountry of GA (in Savannah) and dined at a local restaurant by the ocean that served this. We ate it all the time until we moved back to NY, where you CANNOT find lowcountry boils!!! I was having a pregnancy craving for this dish and made it last night for dinner. It's been nearly a year without us having this dish and it is GREAT! This recipe was very similar to the taste of the boils we ordered at The Crab Shack (not the chain) on Tybee Island, GA! Wonderful blend of tastes and I WILL use this recipe again!

We added 3 lemons cut in half, 4 onions, a couple of handfuls of garlic cloves & a couple of pounds of littleneck clams (which got lost in the mix so we won't repeat) & followed the rest of the ingredient amounts in recipe. We had 13 adults & 2 children & still had some leftover but we also served several appies. I wish the seasoning amounts were more specific...our's didn't have quite enough but now we know for next time. I also wish I had used a much thicker layer of newspaper on the tables....you need a lot to absorb the moisture & prevent it from tearing on you when you clean up.

Made this tonight for the neighbors and had great reviews. 

Measured: 1 cup of Old Bay Seasoning.
Added: 1 bay leaf, 2 lemons quartered, 2 vidalia onions quartered, 1/2 of a bass pale ale and 1 lb of mussels. 

Filled a 22 qt pot 40% with water, the dash of bass and added the seasonings and bay leaf and brought to a boil. Once boiling I added the 5 lbs of quartered potato's and the lemons and cooked for 10 minutes. I then added the precooked kelbasa and onions and cooked for another 5 minutes. Finished it off with the shrimp, crab legs, and mussels cooking for another 5 minutes and sitting for a final 5 in the pot. Drained and tossed in the middle of the table for the big finish.

Everyone ate themselves silly. We will be doing this again with no additional changes. Great Recipe.

Excellent recipe! We did this last night for a group of people on the deck. I also used the recipe on this website for Frogmore Stew, it's similar, but gives a better idea of how much Old Bay to use. I cut the corn and potatoes in half so the shrimp wouldn't seem so small!

This recipe is outstanding.   We added some white onions, lemons, and garlic cloves to the water.  We also added Old Bay plus some Cajun seasoning to spice it up.  

The next day, we combined the leftover seafood and sausage with some mayo and celery for yummy cold sandwiches.

Killer recipe. The only problem is that you never want to boil corn more than 3 minutes. EXACTLY 3 minutes. Otherwise the sugar in the corn will turn into starch and the corn will be ruined. Drop the shrimp and corn in at exactly the same time and they will be done just right.

This is a popular meal at our house.  Our friends ask for this.  I vary it somewhat, but generally follow the recipe.  I use 2 Zatarain's seasoning packs in my cooker (large turkey fryer works best) and salting the water is a MUST.    I toss in a couple of lemons, some quartered Vidalia onions and also add a cup or 2 of white vinegar to the water.  The vinegar is supposed to make the shrimp peeling easier.  Never been an issue so I can't say that it definitely works.  Finally, when serving, I dump it all into a large, flat, plastic (Sterlite, Rubbermaid)storage container like one would slide under your bed.  And throw a few sticks of butter in/on and toss it.   Old Bay for individual seasoning too which will still to the butter.   The storage container makes clean-up MUCH easier.  Leftovers, if any, get put into Ziploc bags for the next day or a midnight snack.   Really good stuff, especially if the corn crop is good.   Here in the east, this year is absolutely fabulous!!

I just made this last night for a family gathering of 9 and everyone couldn't stop raving about how great it was. I added the onions, lemons, garlic, and cayenne pepper that I had read about in the comments and it was fantastic. I couldn't find a big enough pot though and had to divide the recipe up into three 12 quart pots and it was still a tight squeeze. When it came time to fill the platters with all of this food I feared I had made way too much, but everyone devoured it until we were all stuffed. The only thing left were a few potatoes. I set an empty pot on the table for the shells and cobs and everyone got such a kick out of tossing in the scraps. I served it with coleslaw, sourdough rolls, and vodka lemonade cocktails. It was the perfect combination and I will definitely be making this one again.

Seriously delicious! Potatoes boil 15 min, then corn 10 min, then crab legs and kielbasa 5 min, then jumbo pre-cooked shrimp.  From the get go I put in 2 bags of zatarans, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 whole lemons halved.  Spread out newspaper, dumped in center of table, hand little cups of melted butter for dipping.(FYI: do a little Internet research on crab legs if you have not cooked them before as I found it insightful as to what kind to purchase)

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO OTHER REVIEWS!   This was simply fab-with a few additions-  I used beer and water for the boil.   I added fresh minced garlic, an onion & squeezed 1/2 a lemon near the end and tossed the rest of the leftover whole lemon in and let it boil for a few minutes.  OH MY WORD!!!!!!!  AMAZING!  I also tossed in broccoli and carrots.  Each item in the dish had a distinct flavor.   I actually used the 30% lower sodium Old Bay seasoning.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

I'm sorry but i guess i don't get the whole concept, tried it last night, i added shrimp which made it extreamly expensive but if i would have just stuck to crab and corn it would have been better, nobody eats the potatoes and the taste was just well, plain..i added 2 lemons and onion and garlic to the old bay water and i'm sorry, no for me.

What a great recipe!  I totally agree with the recommendation by a previous rater for the Old Bay/water mix (3/4 c. Old Bay to 6 quarts of water).  It was perfect.  Our group raved about the sausage (I think it was even preferred over the shrimp!), so we'd recommend adding a little more than the recipe calls for (we used Polska Kielbasa which was previously sauteed before adding to the pot).  Bottom line:  don't skimp on sausage!!  Only change we'd do would be to cook the corn just a little longer.  The time recommended in the recipe for fresh corn just didn't make it tender enough.  Add maybe 2-4 minutes of corn cooking time.  Also, adding the lemon and onion (as another reviewer recommended) was the right thing to do.  Other than that it was simply wonderful!!!  A highlight of our weeklong family vacation to the beach!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  The Martin/Pressley clan!

This was fantastic! We doubled the ears of corn and added 2 onions (quartered) along with 2 lemons cut in half. We didn't find crabs at the grocery or Whole Foods so instead we pan fried a lb of sea scallops seasoned with a mixture of 1 Tbs Old Bay dissolved in 1/4 cup of melted butter. We then tossed the scallops into the final low country boil product AFTER all was removed from the boiling water. Never put scallops into boiling water.

What a crowd pleaser! Made 4 batches yesterday. First brought the Old Bay, 1 quartered lemon, 1 quatered sweet onion, a whole bulb of garlic (crushed) to boil. Then whole mini red potatoes & kielbasa chunks for 10 minutes, then thawed frozen cobbettes & dungeness crab sections for 5 minutes, then whole shrimp and mussels for the last 2 minutes. Met with "oooohs and ahhhs" when dumped at the table. Thanks for the recipe!

I love doing these boils.  Although my favorite spice packet to add is the Zatarain's crab boil.  It's a little spicier.  Yum!  We do this every year.  We have a big back yard party, and supply the potatoes, corn, and sausage and then every couple brings a pound of shellfish.  It's the best

We went to a "Southern" Wedding Reception where this was served, speaking from experience this is the perfect recipe!!! A few suggestions  would be to sprinkle food with extra seasoning when completed & serve with squirt butter and cocktail sauce (just a preference of ours)Perfect for almost any man...

Love this meal! Big hit every time. The turkey fryer with basket is the best way to cook. We also use the boil-in-bag Old Bay plus wrap it in cheesecloth before dropping into the water.  Newspaper can be messy so we keep a roll of brown wrapping paper or brown paper grocery bags on hand. They are thicker and easier for clean-up. Thanks, Lisa.

Great recipe!  I made this last night, and it was awesome!  I used 1 cup of Old Bay for 6 qts water.  I also added 1/4 cup Cajun Seasoning, 4 lemons (sliced into thirds), and 2 large onions (sliced).  Next time, I will add the sausage later in the process because some pieces split from being overcooked.  Other than that, this recipe is one that is easy to make and is sure to please everyone.

Don't use old bay seasoning use Zatarains crawfish, shrimp and crab boil(in a large pot use 1/4 to 1/2 cup based on how hot you like your food)  Use smoke sausage or Farmer Boys Smoke sausage ..Also place a whole peeled onion and a lemon cut into four pieces. You must do this to stop the seafood flavor from overpowering meats etc. You want to taste all of the different food items.

YUM!  If you want to overeat - this is the recipe for it!  DH and I made this tonight (we cut the recipe in half since it was just two of us), and we ate nearly all of it.  Absolutely delicious!  We had a great time making this together, as the preparation is fun, and can be done by several people.  Also, it is fun, interactive eating as you dump it on the table, crack the crab, etc.  Makes great dinner conversation and a real relationship with your food!  The only thing I did differently was I added a pound of fresh clams (more shelling!), and 2 tablespoons of garlic (for our personal taste).  Warning!... this is a two-hour nap recipe.  When you wake up, you'll still be full... in a good way!  :-)  For those of you that were confused by the recipe because it doesn't specify, I used 6 quarts of water, and 6 ounces of Old Bay Seasoning (an entire 6 oz. container), so that all ingredients in the recipe were entirely covered).  The other thing I would do next time is put the potatoes in later - they got a little too mushy for our tastes!  Enjoy and bon appetit'!  This is a great one all around.  Three cheers for interactive eating!

Is there anything wrong with this recipe? nope! I live in Arizona and its hard to get fresh seafood, so my crab and shrimp were pre-cooked and this still came out great!!! And it is loads of fun to just throw the food on the newspapers and pick at it!!! Non-seafood people will also enjoy this one as it is a good way for them to try seafood.  I used stone crab claws, and one crab and it was awsome!

The Old Bay is necessary, do not substitute with any other kind of seasoning.

Very good and very easy to make. I added a few slices of lemon and 4 cloves of crushed garlic to the boiling water and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again.

This recipes is great!! I put in 1.5 c of Old Bay (I love it!!) and used frozen shrimp, and smoked sausage instead of kielbasa and WOW!!! We also sprinkled a generous amount of Old Bay on top after the "dump" onto the table. We are definately making this for every large gathering we have!! Thanks!!

Fun to make! Everyone was involved with chopping, timing and adding ingredients.  We had lemonade with vodka (as a reviewer suggested) and beer.  This fed 6 adults with leftovers. I used my three biggest pots. I didn't know how much old bay to use, so I added about 1 cup to each pot. It was perfect. Thanks for a fun evening!

This was the first time I made a low country boil, although I have eaten them before. My biggest problem with this recipe is that it did not specify how much water to use. I used the amount listed in the Frogmore Stew recipe (6 quarts and 2 ounces of Old Bay). I also used some suggestions and put in two lemons halved and a large sweet onion quartered. Then cooked the potatoes, sausage, corn, crab and shrimp as per the recipe. This is suppost to feed 15, don't think so 8 of us ate almost all of the boil. This will be on my list of things to make for large gatherings. Thanks Lisa.

My wife was skeptical of all the great reviews. I managed to talk her into trying it and... Wow! Let me say we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We did about 12 cups of water and 1/4 cup of Old Bay in our 6 quart pot (biggest we had- it worked fine, just be sure and keep an eye on it so it doesn't boil over). I also threw in a little Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning along with the onion and lemon mentioned in previous reviews. We used a pound of sausage, a pound of shrimp, 3 ears of corn cut in half, and six good sized new potatoes. Those ratios came out just perfect for 4 people. We may have overcooked the potatoes slightly but they were still very good. We will definitely be making this again, hopefully with fresh crawfish in there as well.

For shellfish purists there is nothing better than a good old "Boil"!  Both the dish's name and a fun family &/or friends event all in itself, a Boil can be anything you want it to be, really.  For instance. we enjoy all types of shellfish, so I always throw in a couple different varieties of steamers (clams in the shell...TIP: If the clam shells don't pop open when cooked, do NOT eat them), and I always add extra crab claws since these are a real big favorite.  I go a step further by adding lobster claws as well.  I prefer to use the Old Bay Seasoning in bags...2 or 3 is about right for a big lobster sized pot, which is about 2 to 3 times larger than the dutch oven size most folks have in their set of cookware.  I add a couple of lemons; halved; I give ea half one good squeeze and throw it in the pot.  When you're doing corn & potatoes altogether lemon might not be to your liking; it's all about your personal taste.  For a big group I put out a good sized sauce pan of drawn (melted clarified) butter, with a gravy ladle and small ramekins for self serve along with a good size dish of lemon wedges.  A bottle of tobasco will be welcomed by some, particularly if you're doing crawfish.  I usually skip the sausage, as we prefer to grill some brats separately. If you've never done a Boil before, don't worry!  Try not to overcook your shellfish; the rest takes care of itself! Let everyone take turns at the ice cream churn for a simple yummy dessert!

My husband made this and we are crazy about it! We even made it for a big family dinner this summer. We serve with butter in a side dish and coctail sauce. We use old bay seasoning and add a little crawfish seasoning and it feels like we're at the beach everytime we eat it. Worth a try!

Excellent recipie.  I definately suggest adding the Lemon & onion to the cooking pot, but it's a matter of taste.  Here in North Carolina we also call this Frogmore stew.  Really great to serve outdoors to a large crowd!

WOW!  We took a chance and made this for the first time a big crowd of freinds and they LOVED IT!  We added mussels, lemons, onions, garlic, beer LOTS of old bay, cajun seasoning and tabasco sauce.  Took a liitle longer than 30 mins (i used larger taters), but overall fantastic.  Oh, we used a turkey fryer and only added half of the crab legs to the boil and aggreed we perfer our crab legs steamed.  Again, overall great recipe.

AWESOME!  I always look for the high-rated recipes, but usually don't get it exactly right and mess something up.  Not this time...every bit of this was excellent.  I think it is the best thing my wife and I ever made.  We did add a lemon and a few onions from our garden.  Not sure how much Old Bay Seasoning everybody uses, but we had a large pot and poured in about half a can...it was outstanding.  The seafood was a little pricy, but well worth it - you couldn't go out to eat for what we spent on this feast.  I told the lady at the seafood counter what I was making, and she grabbed all of the loose crab parts (lots of claws) which was good for this recipe.  I love it!  FIVE STARS (because I can't go any higher).  Thanks, Mike in Knoxville!

This was one heck of a boil! Cooked it exactly by the recipe. Had around 10 people over and everything was eaten but 1 piece of corn. Everyone raved about it. I WILL make this again. Thanks for a great get together recipe!

This is great, you can do this almost the exactly the same adding Crawfish and changing the Old-Bay to Zatarain's seafood boil. I love this stuff it will add more spice than the Old Bay, if you like it in-between you can actually use both, I like the clove-y taste of the Old Bay.

I also like to throw in a couple of Vidalia onions. And use small red taters, or, split your big ones so they cook better. Also remember that the "boiling time" is after you have added the ingredients it cools down the mixture and you have to wait for the pot to start boiling again. Once it starts boiling again then start counting your cooking time. One more thing,,if you use the Seasoning bags, do NOT BREAK the bags open!! You will be forever picking little tiny peppers and stuff out of your teeth. Not to mention it gets all over your food, you want just the flavor, not the MESS! Personally I don't use the seasoning bags, I just use a goodly amount of salt. One more thing we also added, Blue Crabs. If you live on the coast you can catch all you will need and for that matter you can get all the shrimp you need too. So go buy a couple of crab traps and a 15ft cast net and bring home the (bacon) supper! 
Happy Boiling Ya'll !!

WOW!! I have never been interested in boils until I saw this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  I made it over a camp stove while camping with 5 other friends.  It was a huge hit.  I modified the recipe for 6 people.  I would add more crab next time!!!  You can add any sea food you would like.  Amazing and fun to eat too!!!!

I have made this several times and it is great.  I use half water and half beer along with two lemons halved and squeezed and two heads of garlic, halved.  When the garlic comes out, it is soft and sweet and perfect to spread on a slice of bread enjoyed with the rest of the meal.  If you like shrimp, you can't go wrong with this one!

I have made this many times and it is fantastic.  Halve a few lemons and add to the mix.  I agree to add the sausage toward the end or it loses most of it's flavor (albeit healthier since the fat boils out).  MOST IMPORTANTLY, mix up approx. 2 parts ketchup to 1 part mayo and a little garlic powder for dipping.

We use a recipe that is very similar to this, but we add whole onions and bay or sea scallops.  Also added is an Old Bay crab/shrimp boil bag that has all the seasoning in the bag.

This recipe is wonderful.  We used our turkey cooker outside on the patio and because we are from the midwest, we had to use frozen uncooked shrimp and some fish pieces instead of crab.  The cooking only took about 30 minutes.  It was fantastic and we are looking forward to warmer weather here so we can do it again.  We finished off with Key lime tarts made in cupcake papers.  Wonderful recipe and so much fun to dump everything on the table and dig in!  We gorged ourselves and finished it all off!

This was great!  Very easy, very flavorful, and very FUN!  All my friends were in awe.  I will definitely do this again and again.  The only change I made was in place of the crab, I used clam and mussels.

Threw some bay leaves in the water as well. This food was fun and delicious. I saw this on TV a week or so ago and I wanted to do it myself. This recipe is pretty much spot-on. I continued to taste my boiling water to make sure it was seasoned enough. The Old Bay did make the water a little on the spicy side but it didn't relate to the food. I have kids and they don't really care for spicy stuff. I think the Old Bay has a decent amount of pepper in it. It's a great dish and easy to do, perfect for parties or anytime for that matter.

I made this for a Calif. group camping at our local fair.  None had ever heard of it.  A couple of the ladies turned their nose up at the newspaper cover.  When I dumped it out, you would have thought it was Christmas day!  Gone in half an hour, all rave reviews from kids and adults alike.

I used Pensey's boil seasoning, added fresh peeled turnips, used crab, shrimp, small lobster, scallops, clams.  Next time the Andoullie sausage will be added near the end of the boil, too overdone when cooked the full time.

Will cook over open fire next time and use a larger cast iron kettle.

We used the recipe 3 times this summer.  You can't go wrong and the whole meal is cooked at the same time.  Sit back, grab your frosty adult beverage, throw it in the pot as directed, and you are the talk of the town (or the lake)...and its almost too easy.  A couple tips:  For a spicier version, add Zaterains to the boil combined with the Old Bay seasoning.

Excellent recipe, one of our favorite meals.  The only thing I do differently is use beer (cheapest I can find - or the stuff left in the fridge that nobody wants) to boil everything in, instead of water.  The beer adds a sweeter flavor to it all, especially the shrimp!

SOOOOOOOO good. This was our first boil, and this recipe was a HUGE hit with our crowd. We did the recipe as is, except added a lemon (halved) and 2 yellow onions (quartered) to the mix. We also used 1/2 cup of the Old Bay and found the flavor to be GREAT! If any of you are with Scwans Food Delivery, we also used their Mini Extra Sweet Corn ears for it (2 bags worth)and it made it even EASIER if that's even possible!  We will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious!! Substituted scallops for the crab (didn't have any), and added them with the shrimp. Everything else was as written.

Great for a big outdoor get together - just pour the food down the middle of the table and pass the napkins!
Never use anything except Old Bay Seasoning - it makes the dish! Going in my recipe box for sure!

This is so easy, and so yummy!!  We were not sure how much old bay to use, and I think next time we will use more.  Ours was really mild, but still delish.  We did not add crab, as we did not have any, and we used jalapeno brats and turkey kielbasa. We also added a quartered onion. I can't wait to make it again!

Used sweet potatoes instead, tasted wonderful. Second time I made this after boiling the potatoes I added in frozen corn before draining. Sauteed the sausage with some celery, and tossed it all together with some butter and old bay seasoning. Made for an easy weeknight dinner.

We just made this, but used dry crab boil. It was really good. We added 1/2 chopped onion and 2 garlic cloves. We also removed the potatoes, corn and sausage -after cooked- and some of the onion and garlic  into a fry pan and gave them a stir over 1 tbsp of butter for 2 minutes. This made the taste even better.

To: Loving to Cook.  I recommend a 40 quart pot.  You will need the extra room.  We used a 30 quart and the food was too crowded.  Use a standard turkey/fish fryer set up with propane tank and stand.

Our neighbors laughed at us when we were making this.  When it was done ....they were jealous!  yes, we shared just to prove our point!  We could not get crab once so we got "seasoned crawdads"  big mistake it threw the taste way off!

I made this for an early family Christmas dinner and it was a HIT! I used a little more than 1/2 of a 6 oz can of Old Bay. I did not use crab and my shrimp were already cooked. I added beer, a lemon, onions and garlic to the water as it was coming to a boil. Next time I make this(New Years Eve), I will let the cooked shrimp sit out with some Old Bay on them before tossing them in for the last 2 minutes. Hopefully that'll add some more flavor to the shrimp!

This is the best recipe I have tried out thus far on allrecipes.com.  The seafood and sausage and potatoes and corn...fantastic dish!  It would cost a fortune to order this at our local restaurant...I believe it is $59 per person for this bucket feast.  I absolutely loved this recipe and it is very versatile...I added more crab and shrimp to this dish.  I also didn't have Old Bay, so I substituted it with 1/3 cup of a mix of seasonings I had on hand: garlic powder, black pepper, salt, taco seasoning, creole seasoning, chili powder, and also 1 bay leaf...came out fantastic.  I would recommend this to all seafood lovers. Thanks Dave!

This is a great recipe.  My sister-in-law said that she has seen where after it is cooked that they put it in a bag with butter and a little more seasoning and shake it up.  Will try that in a few weeks for the Forth of July.

Wow...what a great dish.  My niece and her family did this on the beach at our family reunion and it just made the night that much more spectacular!  Dumped it on paper covered picnic table and let the feast begin...it was great!  Would highly recommend it...especially for a large group...we had 25.

We scaled this down for just my husband me and it's delicious (and one of our new favorite meals.)  We just used fresh shrimp, corn, and potatoes, and cut the quantities down for two people.  Super easy and good!  We left the shells on our shrimp and added some garlic cloves and lemon to the water, along with a bottle of darker beer.  It's nice to know you don't have to go big with this recipe and you can totally just make it for a quick weeknight dinner!  We repeated this on our recent beach trip with fresh Gulf shrimp and it was to die for.  So, so good!!

I loooved this recipe! It was so simple, yet incredibly tasty! It is an economical alternative to Joe's Crab Shack's steam pots. I made this for my parents and enjoyed it so much that I hosted a crab dinner for a group of friends the very next weekend. I always add more lemons to the pot and my mom suggested that next time we add clams. I got great feedback from my family and friends who ate until they were stuffed. I definitely recommend this recipe =) I would suggest pairing it with Mexican Bean Salad or a pre-meal Strawberry Spinach Salad.

we eat this frequently- we boil the potatoes first, then corn, then the sausage and last the shrimp.  we usually steam the crab separately.  after everything is done we drain and put in large bowls and pour melted butter and sprinkle A LOT of Old Bay seasoning on the mixture.  serve with tons and tons of napkins. we do triple all the amounts as we feed three hungry teenagers..lol

I made this recipe for family and friends for 4th of July and it was AWESOME!!!  Everyone LOVED it....nothig left but newspaper!! I would add the sausage toward the end before the shrimp next time.  Flavor was lost a little by cooking so long,  Definitely a new 4th of July tradition!!

Great for parties.  Easy to make, and exciting for guests.    The recipe is for 15 but I consistently find that it feeds about 20 adults.

A house favorite!  Great group meal!  I added a bit of chili flakes and spicy sausage, along with an onion and a bit of white wine along with the boiling water!  Mmm mmm.  Also used baby red potatoes and cooked them a bit longer.

Made this for my son's 15th birthday dinner, fantastic!  I left out the cayenne and wished I hadn't.  Will be making again and adding the cayenne :)  Used more sausage and less crab leg and shrimp, easier on the pocketbook.  Very good and fun famiy dinner.

A Family Favorite! We usually add 3 or 4 whole artichokes (tips trimmed) early on in the cooking and break the ears of corn in half before tossing them in about 5 minutes before the shrimp. We use a little more spicy- sometimes throwing in a few peppers from the garden.  We serve with small bowls of melted butter and minced garlic for dipping ... mmmmm

What a show stopper! Did this for our 12 year old nieces Bday party. Big hit with all the girls. They dove right in. Delicious. Used  frozen tail on shrimp instead of Crab. We'll use this again.

it was excellent.  We followed the recipe to the letter and after reading the other reviews, we can improve it.  TN is a hard place to find crabs, so went to SAMS and got frozen.

I am a novice cook and don't like to cook, but I do like to entertain.  I am not afraid to experiment on guests, so I thought a low country boil would be great fun for a crowd of 40 in my yard.  This site, especially with the reviews, was very helpful.  The party was a great success and, believe it or not, I was even asked to CATER a similar party for someone.  My problem is that I have no knowledge of even the simplest kitchen issues.  What size of a pot did I need?  No one say that anywhere.  I even tried measuring cobettes of corn to figure out how many would fit, etc.  (What can I say, I'm a math teacher.)  Finally it dawned on me that I needed to measure my stove to see what pots might fit on it.  I ended up with two 15 qt GraniteWare pots and two Graniteware "blancher" pots.  The blanchers have strainer inserts which helped a lot. For the big pots, I fished everything out with the steamer top to my Farberware set (it is basically a sauce pan with holes in the bottom). These pots fit on my four burner electric range.  The small burners took forever to heat the water, especially on the big pot, so things got unorganized rather quickly, as the pots got going at different rates and it was hard to keep the boil after cold things got added. (Note, thaw frozen cobettes and shrimp before using.)  Be careful not to overfill the blanchers or you will have a big mess on your stove as they bubble over the lip of the bottom pot.      (I am out of characters so will continue ...)

My, this is good! If you don't have "Old Bay" you can make a weak chicken broth, with bay leaves, garlic, onion, celery-whatever seasonings sound good to you then follow the directions with the other ingredients. Just delicious and very easy!

I was skeptical about boiling with just jarred seasoning, but man oh man this was good. I usually like a squirt of lemon on my boil and some onion/herbs in the pot but Old Bay doesn't even need it. I just started adding it to the pot and tasting the boil on a spoon: it didn't taste too special in water but it really amps up the seafood. I've sampled other mostly creole/cajun boil mixes and while each was good, this one stands out for me and is also the most pleasing to the most people: not too spicy or garlicy or whatnot. I truly don't think you need anything more than this: thanks very much for sharing :)

This is a terrific, fun & easy meal to prepare. It had everyone talking as we presented it to the table.  I put down newspaper to cover the table but I also used those cardboard box bottoms from the grocery store that hold the can goods on the shelves.  Everyone filled up their "box plate" and it also served to contain the shells and cobs as they ate them.  It made clean up very easy. I did also add a bag of crab boil to kick up the spiciness.  And the warning about eating too much is true! I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone ate so much they couldn't move after dinner.

So easy and just plain fun.  I can't wait to try the real thing for our friends here in Charleston, SC!

Used turkey roaster vat on stove, doubled water to 12Q and 1-1/2 c. Old Bay, 1 quartered lemon, 1 quartered orange, 3 smashed garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves.  3 lbs red potatoes, 2 lbs. yellow. 4-14oz kielbasa, 15 half-ears of froz. corn. 3 lbs froz. shrimp (thaw all froz. stuff first).  Used 10-5-3 time formula (10 min potatoes, 5 corn, 3 shrimp/kielbasa) and potatoes needed more time -- they cooked differently, so always use the same kind! (It wound up close to 30 min. total until taters were done, luckily nothing was overcooked).  Could have used jumbo shrimp.  Could adjust amount of food for each person -- we had a lot leftover (15 people).  Everything was great.  People raved how unique it was, not too spicy.  Too messy to pour on table so used a jumbo foil casserole pan (disposable) which was way easier.  Great for a summer meal and feeds a ton of people.  All the reviews really helped me, so I'm paying it forward.

I figured its time to pipe up and give credit where credit is due. This is an absolutely fantastic recipe!  In fact, it has become my Christmas Eve tradition each year for the past 4 years here in Florida.  I host a large group of family and friends and everyone raves.  I love the simplicity of it.

Tried it several  times and it's always a hit. Didn't have fresh corn so used the frozen niblets. Also added an onion and a lemon. I don't serve this on newspapers because I don't like the idea of eating ink and I know how easily it comes off on my hands just reading the paper. I have a huge platter that I use to serve it. (I don't peel the shrimp)

We served this to our guests visiting our campsite and they thought this was a fantastic dinner!  Loved how easy it was to cook and dumping it on a large platter for everyone to help themselves!  Leftovers were just as good for lunch the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

Not a bad base recipe but next time, I will surely add more old bay and follow what many of the reviewers said with onions, garlic, and lemon. Overall, not a bad start!

This has got to be the most delicious meal EVER!  Only added some garlic and onion and a bay leaf per a lady I met at the grocery!  Too good!  I made it for ten people and nothing left!  I used 1 cup of bay seasoning and a generous amout of garlic and onion and of course made garlic butter to go with it!  NUMMY!

I also add 2-3 onions and 2 lemons to this recipe-But the best addition is to add fresh whole white mushrooms! They really soak up the flavors of the boil-I add them with the corn and the crab-if you like mushrooms, you will love these!

Just moved to the east coast from Texas and was missing our crawtfish boils! Made this for our other Texas ex-pats and we all loved it!! I added 2 lemons, 5 cloves of garlic and used a leftover bag of seafood boil seasoning I had from a TX store. It was beyond yummy!

Success!!  I followed this recipe and the some hints from the comments below and impressed a group of 8.  The presentation was fun, family style, and the food tasted fantastic.  Clean up was super easy.  I cooked on the stove and used 2 pots because I didn't have a big enough one - worked out great and I was the hit hostess!!  Thanks.

Love this recipe!  It's great because the way each ingredient goes in for a certain length of time makes it all cooked exactly perfectly.  But 2 tbsp of Bay Seasoning?  Puhlease!   We used half a can.

Fantastic - easy recipe, great results. My family is still talking about this meal.  We added lemon juice to the boil, a dash of tabasco sauce and served with drawn butter for dipping the shrimp. Can't wait to make it again.

WOW! I can't wait to make this over the fire pit this summer with a bunch of friends. How fun! This was outstanding. With the exception of adding a few lemons, I made this recipe as written. I wouldn't change too much. When it's good, it's good. I like the idea somebody gave about using a turkey roaster with its strainer. -- Good one.

Wonderful. I did the potatoes first and then added the sausage (Italian sausage) with the corn, lemons, scallops, crab legs, clams. It was great. 3/4 cups of Old Bay in 6 quarts of water was perfect.

This was too bland with just the old bay seasoning.  Unfortunately I printed off the recipe long ago and didn't have time to re-read the reviews for additional opinions and ideas.  I will make it again, but will add additional spices for more flavor in the finished dish.

This recipe is so popular for large parties in GA! Many people add crawfish instead of crab and I always, always use quartered onions in the boil. The onions add great flavor to everything and are also yummy to eat!

My husband just made this tonight. We used Zataran's mild seasoning instead of Old Bay but it was too spicy. We'll use Old Bay next time and lemons per other reviews. We added cut chicken tenderloins and brussel sprouts, which were good! The shrimp were heads off but unpeeled and they were fresh local shrimp so you can't beat that! Delicious, filling meal that does go great with a cold beer.

Hard to go wrong with a crab and shrimp boil.  Make sure you add plenty of kielbasa - never fails to be the first ingredient consumed. I use a seasoning bag instead of dumping in the Old Bay loose.  You get all the flavor and none of the mess.

AMAZING!!!  Add onion, garlic, a chunked up lemon, and 2 bay leaf to the water.  If you want to add fresh muscles, do that during the last 5 minutes with the shrimp.  If the sausage is precooked, do that last as well.

One of the best starter recipes out there! explains process very well!  Don't be afraid to be generous with seasonings and add items of your choosing, clams, muscles, artichokes....extra time for artichokes.  Big uncut mushrooms at the end also soak up the best flavors of the pot.

I have been looking for a seafood boil recipe and found it.  This is a good one and I will be making this again.  The only changes were that I used Spiny lobster tails (I catch them myself, lucky me) instead of crab and throw in a bag of seafood seasoning along with the Old Bay Seasoning as recommended (cuts down on the mess and adds more flavor) The seafood bags can be found at your local market next to the Old Bay Seasoning.  The reviewers suggested a lemon sliced in half, squeeze in the pot, then add the lemon to the pot.  I did this also.  Great recipe and easy! Thank you!  :)

Absolutely delish! I used half Corona and half water for the boil.  Because we like it spicy, I put red cayenne pepper and Old Bay seasoning in the beer/water before bringing to a boil.  I used crab legs, shrimp, tilapia, crawfish, spicy sausage, fresh corn on the cob (cut in sections), and red potatoes.  I also used Zatarain's Crab Boil.  This was soooo good.  We usually have leftovers, since it's now only my husband and I.  Whatever little that was left over was gone by the next morning!

made this recipe last night and it came out amazing!!

i followed the tips from other reviewers and i ended up adding 2 lemons, 2 onions,cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, 3 cloves of garlic and beer.

it made everything taste flavorful! 

-- i think the shrimp got over cooked so next time ill leave it in for only 1- 2  minutes.

This is really good and easy.  I changed the serving size to 8. Cut up the small red potatoes in forths or thirds, depending on size.  I didn't have the seasoning so used a crab/shrimp boil in bag package.  Melted some butter for the shrimp and crab and done!  Wasn't able to cook outside but plan to do that next time.  Family loved it!

Wow.  Absolutely delicious.  As a Midwesterner I never even thought of this for dinner.  Glad I tried it.  Follow the recipe as is.  You will not be disappointed.  Oh.  Some butter and garlic biscuits are a nice touch too.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an absolutely easy to follow recipe for those who don't know what they are doing.  Though, my potatoes took much longer to cook.  Either way, this is how my family has been making boils for as long as I can remember.  Super yummy!  Absolutely 5 stars!

This was absolutely delicious.  We had family visiting and it was a big hit with my teenage nieces.  Their mother informed me they still talk about how much they loved this meal 6 months later.  I left out the crab because no one was into it and it saved me the extra expense, but I am sure would be a delicious addition.  Definitely recommended especially for a large family gathering.  I definitely will be making this again.

WONDERFUL!!!!  We used this for our 4th of July picnic and It was a big hit. As others suggested we used 3/4 C old bay to 6 quarts water + 1 beer, 1 large sweet onion halved, 1 large lemon halved and several cloves of garlic. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Great for spending time entertaining your guests while serving a delicious one pot easy meal! We will be doing this again on the beach this weekend.  PS, we had a few left over potato's and cut them up for hash browns in the morning and they were even better.

You can't beat this recipe for a family feast!  It was so easy to make, and came out perfect on the first try.  I used the 3/4 cup Old Bay Seasoning per 6 qt. of water and it was just right.  I also added 2 lemons cut in half, 8-10 garlic cloves, and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper.  I cooked the potatoes and corn about twice as long as suggested to ensure they were sufficiently tender, and it came out great.  This will be a holiday staple in our household for a long time!

Hubby made this for tonight's dinner. He cut this down for two of them to eat. I only added about 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and 1/2 tsp Chef Geoffrey Michael's cajun seasoning to the cooking water. Served this with a bowl of warm lemon-butter and some Texas Toast, beer for the hubby, root beer for the teen. They devoured all but a couple potato chunks.

This was good, but I prefer the Zatarain's crab boil seasoning over Old Bay.  I'll use that next time because I've had better success with it in the past.  I used the Ekrich sausage with cheese in it, and it was so good!

Tasted great!! Being a midwesterner, I have had a low-country boil once.  It was so good, I just had to try it myself.  Easy to follow directions!  Thanks!

Made this for our annual 4th of July family picnic.  Got RAVE reviews!  It was the first time I had used Old Bay seasoning, and it's delicious.  Adds great flavor.

9/28/19 - We used 6 quarts of water, about 12 ears of corn, 2.5 pounds of kielbasa, 2 pounds of potatoes and 2.5 pounds of shrimp - had to heat and spice up more water to fit it all in but was well worth it!  Used about 1 cup of Old Bay with 8 cloves of garlic, one onion and one lemon.  Served to a group of friends - was a big hit and leftovers reheat well, too!

I used my big electric fryer to cook it in and put it outside so it didn't stink up the house.  I made it a bit spicier by adding Andolluie Sausage and went with 1 cup of the Old Bay seasoning.  I also decreased the Lbs of shimp and added the Alaskan King crab legs.  OMG it was delish!

Living in Atlanta we don't get fresh heads-on shrimp often so we find wild frozen shrimp at the local market.  Never use farmed shrimp. We use Zatarain shrimp boil for the seasoning plus lemons (quartered), a half dozen crushed garlic cloves and onions.  The potatoes absorb the lemon/onion flavor. For sausage we like andoullie or Conecuh added after the new potatoes have boiled for 8 minutes or so, If we use hot andoullie we add toothpicks so we know what we are getting.  A family favorite.

I do a shrimp boil every summer for Father's Day for my husband.  However, I use a full 3oz container of Old Bay seasoning, 1T would not be enough.  I use 8 lbs of shrimp and add 2 onions quartered and 2 lemons quartered and 3-4 cloves of garlic just cut in half, not chopped.  In the boiling water I first add the Old Bay, onions, garlic, and lemons.  I boil about 1lb of shrimp with tails first to get some seafood flavoring in the water, take that out, then boil the other ingredients in stages - corn 3 mins, potatoes and sausage about 10 mins, then the rest of the shrimp for just a couple of minutes until they turn pink but don't curl up too much.  Serve with slaw and crusty french bread and it's always a winner.  Love it!

I love this recipe and so did my family. As suggested in previous reviews, I used turkey sausage to reduce the fat content and also added 1 large quartered onion and 1 lime sliced in half. As far as the other ingredients, I cut everything else in half to reduce the number of people served (we only had 3 adults and 3 kids as opposed to 15 people and we had plenty of leftovers).

This was ok, not good as written! You need to up the old bay to 3/4 cup, lemons, onions, bay leaves, garlic cloves sliced in half into boiling water.  With those changes it was a huge hit the second time we made it.

I like your recipe but in my experiences, potatoes should be added before it starts boiling, cuz obviously they take longer to cook and they will cook all the way through more evenly. It works for me. Just my opinion tho. To each their own! Boil on!!:)

Made this for a Labor Day 2015 get together.  Seven couples enjoyed it immensely!  Some variations that I made with the help of other reviews were to add lemon and onion to the mix.  These are the steps we took:  1. Add 6 oz. of Old Bay, a bay leaf,  and one bottle of Michelob Amber Bock to water and bring to a boil.  I used a 36 qt. turkey fryer and filled it to 40%.  2. Once the water was boiling I added 4.5 lbs. of small red potatoes and 2 lemons quartered - cooked for 10 minutes.  3. Added corn* and cooked 5 minutes. 4.  Added Kielbasa and onion - one onion quartered cooked 5 minutes. 5. Added crab and cooked 5 minutes.  6. Added the shrimp and cooked till the shrimp curled and turned pink.  7. Drained and tossed onto a newspaper covered table and drizzled one cup of melted butter over all.


I cook a lot and plan menus for fun - this dinner got so many compliments!!   I served Red Lobster biscuits (bought the mix at Sam's), Cajun coleslaw (variation of one head red cabbage and one of green with only 2 green peppers), and Fire and Ice Tomatoes.  You can find the recipes for these on line.  I doubled both recipes.  * I used frozen corn - I will not do that again - fresh would be much better!!

This is a family favorite! I always cut up a lemon & put in with Old Bay seasoning while water is boiling- I also use andouille sausage (not pre cooked) You have to have butter & cocktail sauce on the side!! You will eat yourself to misery!!! TOO GOOD!

I made this for my mother in laws birthday at her request.  She loved it!!! The only mods I did was to scale it down to 10 ppl and skipped the crab. But added an extra pound of shrimp (we get 5 pound boxes straight from the docks in Tampa). Because I was cooking indoors I used two large stockpots and split the ingredients in 2. I eyeballed about a 1/4 c old bay in each pot and threw a quartered lemon and small sweet onion in each pot per other reviewers suggestion.   Fantastic!!! If it pleases the mother in law you know it's good!

Made this and added juice of 2 lemons, cayenne pepper, and 1 clove of crushed garlic. The family loved it!  It's now on the menu for occasional family get-togethers!

Easy, tasty, quick dinner.  All in one pot!  What's not to love?!  I made this for dinner parties, and just for two.  "Picky husband" loves it. We add shrimp, sometimes.

This was the first time I had ever cooked crab legs so I was afraid of ruining yhem. It came out fantastic. Very easy recipe to follow. I did add cloves, bay leaves, and the juice of 2 lemons to the water. Also, I added more Old Bay Seasoning (about 1/2 cup). My family loved it! The melted Kerrygold garlic herb butter helped too ;)

Even though I forgot the shrimps, it was still good.  For sausages, I used kielbasa and hot links for variety.

Fantastic! I used extra old bay in the water as per the other reviews, about half a can because we like it spicy, and when the boil was finished, sprinkled a little more over everything. We also added crawfish. Everyone loved it, and the only reason there was leftovers is because there was so much! Not one soul complained about taking a bag home with them though!

I feel like I would have been happier with hot dogs and corn on the cob, so it was a lot of work for what it was. The shrimp tasted like nothing-- not even shrimp.

This was a perfect recipe for a summer party! Everyone had fun with this interactive meal. We used andouille sausage instead of kielbasa. A great continuation was to use the leftovers (if you have any) the next morning in an egg white omelette. Awesome!

I had to cook the potatoes a few minutes longer than suggested, but other than that, the timing is Dead On.
Everyone Loved the Food. Nothing was over or under cooked. I didn't brake up the crab, only because I was afraid it would get watery.
I will definitely be making this again!

Made this for dinner tonight; it was awesome! I added 4 garlic cloves and a quartered sweet onion to the water plus a whole lot of Old Bay.  I started with 3 Tablespoons but that didn't look like enough so I free poured more in. (i grew up in MD where we use it instead of salt.) I used red potatoes, kielbasa, 2 ears of corn, 1 lb. of shrimp, and frozen dungeoness crab...made enough for 4. Served with tomato salad and fresh Italian bread.

Delish!  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to add lots more seafood seasoning (Old Bay), Cajun seasoning, Italian seasoning, black pepper and three healthy-sized cloves of fresh/crushed garlic to the boiling water (hence, the four stars and not five).  In addition, I cooked the corn on the cobb and potatoes a little longer than the 10 minutes stated in the recipe and added scallops along with the crab legs and shrimp.  Wish I had enough $$$ at the time to purchase a bag of fresh mussels to add to the recipe -- that would have made this dish outstanding.  In any event, I will make this dish again and again.  Thank you Lisa and thank you allrecipes!

I tried this recipe tonight just to say that we celebrated New Years Eve eating a meal outside of our norm. I stopped short of making myself sick eating this. I didn't do this outside, so I had to split this recipe into two pots. I actually let one of them sit on the stove while we ate the first pot.  The items in the second pot had a bit of a kick. I did as some of the other reviewers suggested, and I added 1 lemon(halved), one onion (quartered), and two bay leaves to the pots. It would have probably been good without these additions. Everyone enjoyed it, including my two picky eaters who are 6 and 10. My 12 year old, husband, and I enjoyed that added spiciness in the second pot. This made an awesome New Years Eve dinner and we will have to do this again soon!

This recipe is phenomenal.  You will eat yourself sick everything is so delicious.  I made a few changes (due to items I had on hand) I used Yukon Gold Potatoes and smoked Turkey Sausage and I didn't peel the shrimp, I simply put them in their as they were.

I will be making this again Sunday for our Labor Day Cookout

This was delicious.  Added 1 quartered lemon and some fresh chopped parsley at the end.  Served with an ice cold beer and a crusty bread to soak up some broth.

OMG!!  I am from Canada and now live in the deep south.  I was looking for something that was neither beef nor chicken, yet was an "all-in-one" meal with a southern kick.  YUM - it was a HUGE hit!!  I am officially a southerner - Thanks Dave!

Help!!!  This recipe looks awesome, but I am not sure what kind of outdoor cooker to use.  Can anyone give me an idea?  This seems like alot of food that must take an enourmous size pot.

Thanks!!

This is a great recipe...We used 4 packages old bay season packs, next time will use 6 because we also had to add dry seasoning to the pot for more flavor. We used 2 pkg. smoked sauseage, and 1 pkg. jalapeno sausage, 5lbs new potatoes, 12 ears corn, and 6lbs shrimp. It was pretty good, but next time will add more seasoning...Great recipe though. This fed 5 kids, and 4 adults with not much leftovers!!

Wonderful! I liked this much better than the recipes using the mesh bag of crab boil. I did use frozed corn cobettes that I thawed in place of the fresh corn everyone raved and wants it again soon!

How easy can you get?? This was super simple and so totally tasty. We used corn, sausage, potatoes, and shrimp. I didn't measure the Old Bay, just dumped in half a shaker and it seemed to be fine. We're going to the beach in a few weeks and I can't wait to make this again with fresh crab this time.

Used it today for a fathers day meal. Went really well and everyone was super impressed. I did add some other stuff to the recipe like we threw in 4 dz. fresh clams, 7 lbs of king crab legs and some lemons. We feasted all day. Thank you for the info to get this meal started.

This was awesome I made it for my family and we all loved it. I quartered the recipe, used 1/4 cup old bay, and boiled corn pieces w/ potato chunks together for first 15-20 minutes, then added all meats together in the last 5 minutes since they were all precooked.

When my wife and I tried this the first time we loved it. Now when ever we make it instead of the shrimp, we use two bags of crawfish still in the shell. The crawfish adds extra spice to it and is delicious.

Maybe we didn't use enough seasoning and maybe it's because we made it in winter, ate it inside on plates and didn't have any beer - but I thought this was just kind of bland.  I'll try it again in the summertime, but I wasn't super impressed.

The secret that makes this great is the use of ample butter AND a heaping amount of Old Bay in the boiling water itself, an approach I hadn' tried before. The second winning aspect is the garlic and lemon butter. Really made a tremendous difference. Everything tastes delicious.  That being said, I've made shrimp boils before and some of the textures were better. With crab, it was still good, but boiling it instead of steaming them makes the shells softer, along with the meat, so it's harder to crack the shells and pull out good portions as you would with steamed crab.

Added onion, garlic, creole seasoning, fresh bay leaves (2) to the water with the Old Bay Seasoning.  Browned sausage beforehand quickly for color and flavor and husband's preference. Added green beans a couple of minutes before the shrimp for more vegetables and so I didn't need to make a green salad.

Loved this recipe! We used live blue crabs from our favorite Asian market. I followed the recipe to a tee, other than added Chinese celery, lemons and onions to the pot. It turned out fragrant and delicious!

I used red potatoes. Added cajun spices, used a shrimp boil spice bag, 1 lemon cut in half and threw them in the pot. 

Serve with cocktail sauce or tabasco sauce, lemon wedges, and garlic bread.

Excellent. Followed the recipe and was very good. I will add garlic, bay leaves and lemon next time. I did not have crab legs. Also I use an Ina Garten recipe for cocktail sauce...perfect... I will have melted butter in ramekins as well.

I added about 3oz of Old Bay and will probably add more next time. Good, easy meal, and the presentation is fantastic. We'll definitely make this again for special occasions. Must be eaten outside, too.

Very tasty! I used smoked turkey sausage (the casing is softer), small red potatoes and no crabs. I added a can of beer to the water and a pinch of salt. I used 1/4 cup of Old Bay which added flavor without making it too spicy. It turned out great and I'll make it again.

I dropped a star because that kielbasa just seems wrong to me. :) I have use a much nicer sausage such as andouille sausage.  I also use crab and shrimp boil with some old bay seasoning. I like to put chunks of onion and some lemon wedges in the boil too.

I've been makin this for about 20 years since a friend of mine introduced it at a dinner invitation. He also would add a few eggs to the pot the last 10 minutes to boil. Shoemache's sausage was all he would use. I'm makin some today. I use niblet corn ears. Crabs are not readily available in central AL but I have some scallops I may add with the shrimp. Also will add lemon and onion as a few have suggested. Serve with butter and cocktail sauce.

Great recipe!  I would say not to be shy with the Old Bay seasoning.  The more seasoning the tastier all of the meat and veggies will be.

i added clams and crab legs for ten mins before the shrimp. I had to add more old bay for flavoring. I also added  4 lemons cut in half to the water.  A BIG hit!

I used this recipe and tweaked it using what others had reviewed suggested.  I did 1 cup of old bay to 8 qts of water and added 2 lemons halved along with 2 onions cut into slices into the old bay and water for the initial boiling.  I followed all other directions except I waited to put the sausage in after the potatoes cooked for about 5 mins so not overcook it.  We absolutely enjoyed it.  Everyone kept coming back for seconds.

I loved this! I quartered the potatoes and uses a zatarain's seafood boil packet but still added onion, lemon and some Cheyenne pepper. I used the cooking times per ingredient recomendations. It was  delicious! Will def. Make this again!

My family loved this.  Easy to make and really fun to eat.  The only change I made based on some reviewers suggestions was to add two quartered onions, two halved lemons, a couple of bay leaves and cayenne  pepper to the stock.  I overcooked the shrimp but I'll be sure not to next time.

IT CAME OUT GREAT!!!  My family ate until their stomach could take no more.  The key is: add a few bay leaves, 2 or 3 lemons and use enough Old Bay Seasoning.  If you don't use enough it will taste bland.

This is a great base recipe although I made some changes which still made the meal delicious!  First off, I substituted Old Bay seasoning for Zataran's seafood bags as my local market did not have Old Bay seasoning.

Also, the recipe is good for 4 - 5 persons, depending on which crabs you buy.  We bought 5 lbs of blue crab.

Substitutions:
  1. Used beer as the base liquid - 18 cans of Bud-light to be exact  =]
  2. Two bags of Zataran's seasoning
  3. Added 3 teaspoons of cayenne pepper
  4. Added 1 teaspoon of dried Thai red chili pepper flakes
  5. Added 1 1/2 cup of BlendItUp SouthWest Spice blend
  6. Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar
  7. Added two large sweet onions (quartered) and three large Meyer lemons (halved)
  8. Added a box of button mushrooms with a 1 pound of unpeeled shrimp with the heads still on.

A great boil and would repeat again with additional seafood added like large clams, mussels, or scallops!

I added a couple of lemons cut in half and a large onion cut in to chunks.  Also, I didn't use crab and cut the corn into 2-3 inch pieces.  I put a disposable plastic tablecloth covered with newspapers on a patio table.  I had a strainer in my cooking pot, pulled it out and dumped the food in the center of the table.  I served oysters on the half shell for an appetizer.  This was the easiest and most fun meal I have ever prepared for guests.  A definite do again!

The cooking times were spot on right. It could have used more old bay seasoning or some other type of season. The food was well cooked, but did not have much extra flavor. Good thing we had melted ghee. That made it delicious.

This is a crowd pleaser! Made it for some friends and they were so impressed. I did take some advise of other reviewers though by also adding lemons to the water and some garlic. I put the sausage in the end same time as the shrimps. I will make this again it is a real winner. Thank you Dave!

A perfect meal for a crowd for sure.  I made this for the Labor Day weekend and it was a hit. I also added two lemons to the pot and a little more Old Bay. You cannot go wrong when you have a large amount of people for a get together and you make this recipe. Be sure that you have huge pots for the cooking of this meal, little pots will not do unless you plan on cutting down the amount of food you are serving. Don't forget the butter for the corn, the melted butter for the shrimp, add garlic to it if you like to the butter. I also served corn bread, delish,

I added lemons and a Zatterains boil spice bag.  This was the first time I ever had a boil, and I am telling you it was amazing.  I am making it again this weekend to share with my family and friends.  This time I am going crazy and adding artichoke, mushrooms, cauliflower, parsnips, and mussels.  No matter what you add, if you spice it right in the beginning it will be a smash in the end.  Someone gave this recipe a low score citing the expense of shrimp as one of the reasons.  If shrimp is not on sale do something else like blue crab or mussels or whatever is on sale.  I find the cost of raw shrimp to be much lower than cooked and they impart a more intense flavor to most any shrimp dish.  Also, they are easy to peel if you add some vinegar and butter...so I hear.

We added 1 lemon, cut in half, squeezing the juice into the pot, as well as an onion (also cut in half). We also opted to use one of those little shrimp/crab boil spice bags from Zatarain's, which seasoned the broth perfectly. We had friends over for dinner, and everyone enjoyed this.

We did a movie night with friends and wanted to have a seaside theme for dinner and this fit the bill.  It was easy to make and a hit. Thanks to other reviewers, I used the 6qts water with 3/4 cup Old Bay. I added 1/2 a lemon and only used 2 packs of smoked sausage as we were making a dinner for four. I added two small onions. Next time I would salt the water, as the dish didn't have alot of  flavor. Maybe mix in some Zatarains. But regardless, it is a winning dish.

Great menu for entertaining! I used a bag of Louisiana shrimp boil and no crab, just shrimp, potatoes, & corn. Drained the pot then dumped it on a newspaper covered table. Everyone loved it! If you buy the mild bag then you can add the spices at the beginning; otherwise, I add the HOT bag after the 10 minutes for the potatoes.

Having lived in in Beaufort SC. area for over 30 years. This dish is also know as Frogmore Stew. (Small town on islands out side Beaufort where locals claim to have made up this dish.Try adding Steamed oysters on the side. For those that don't know while cooking add Shrimp and Crab the last 5-7 minutes of cook time. This keeps them from over cooking.

I get the crab boil bags and use it instead of the separate seasonings the recipe calls for.  We love it.

I just made this terrific dish for a dinner party for 4.  I  used my large 12 quart stock pot and cooked everything inside on the stove.  1.5 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound crab, 1 pound kielbasa, 1 pound red potatoes and 4 ears of corn was the perfect amount. We all ate more than our fill and there were no leftovers.  The only change I made was that I used 2 bags of McCormick Shrimp & Crab Boil an two halved lemons to season the 10 quart boil. Everything was perfectly seasoned.  I forgot to put out salt and pepper and no one even noticed.  I made a spicy mayo mixed with cocktail sauce and horseradish for dipping.  Grapefruit shandy was the perfect beverage and pecan pie made for a delicious end to an amazing meal.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Great!! I added sausage later (just after the crab). Potatoes typically take a bit longer than suggested. I add lemon as suggested. I also add a bit of butter to the boil as it seems to make the crab meat slip easily from the shell:-)

Over all the boil had a good taste to it but you have to adjust your cooking times, my potatoes and sausage were done faster then the time called for, my potatoes turn to mush and the sausage bloated by the time everything else was done.      I also added lemon, garlic and onions like others suggested, I think that helps the recipe out a lot.

This is such an easy, crowd pleaser. You can easily vary the ingredients and servings. Add one can of a quality ale or lager and you've got the perfect cookout meal.

This recipe was great.  We added a bit more Old Bay after it was said and done and a little salt for the potatoes.  Otherwise, it felt like a day at the beach, cooking up the days catch.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

My first attempt at a Low Country Boil was made easy by using this recipe.  I used King Crab Legs and added Littleneck clams (in same quantity as shrimp), as well as a few sweet onions and broccoli.  I used an outdoor cooker and I added a few minutes cooking time to each "phase" because of added ingredients, and everything turned out perfectly - if I dare say so.

I made this for new year's eve and it wss a big hit!  I had to go find the copy cat spice for Old Bay as we don't seem to have it in this part of Canada.  I will be ordering it though.  I like the sausage mix with the seafood, and the relaxed atmosphere the newspaper, paper plates and beer creates.  It's a keeper at my house.  Plan to use it in summer when corn is in season for a back yard event. Thanks

Wonderful Recipe! I used garlic and herb old bay and added 2 lemons cut in half with the juice squeezed out into the water, it was my first time ever preparing crab and it was delicious! Everything tasted great, this was good simple food at it's best.

Thank you Dave. The boil was a hit at my wife's birthday party. This is a great combo of ingredients that makes a hearty meal. I do suggest adding cajun seasoning (to taste) after it is served, it adds just the right amount of zest.

This was pretty good. I served it with Kickin' Collard Greens from this site. I wish it would have had just a bit more flavor but I'm sure I can think of something next time.

I used Italian sausage instead of the kielbasa (didn't have any) and it was excellent!
