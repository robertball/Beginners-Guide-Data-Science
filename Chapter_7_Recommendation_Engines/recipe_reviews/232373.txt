I used this recipe just for the filling. I divided one ball of dough in half to make two pizzas. I took the dough out of the freezer the night before and let it thaw on the kitchen counter. I then took a ceramic cereal bowl from my kitchen, coated it with butter and lined it thickly with provolone cheese slices (mozzarella would work too) so there were no gaps. I made the  filling as described, using sweet Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions and diced green peppers. I only put pepper in half of the filling, since I can't eat highly acidic foods (it was good with or without). I then then put the filling in the bowls with the cheese and spread the dough over the top. If you stretch the dough a thin over the top and just let the excess hang over the side it makes a nice, thick crust when you flip it over. I also brushed some butter on top, but you could use olive oil or an egg wash to help brown it. I put the bowls straight onto a pan, right into the oven,  and cooked until browned. Then I flipped it right onto a plate, ran a spoon around the edge, and pulled the bowl off the top (you can also put an upside-down plate directly on top of the pizza, hold them together, and then flip the whole thing over to make it easier).

The crescent roll dough is too sweet and takes away from all the other favours. I did a three cheese blend of mozzarella, old white cheddar and provolone. I also added a bit of parm on top with fresh basil. The crust sweetness drowned it all out. 

Add a real crust or pizza dough.

We did it! For being a couple of 16/17 year olds we did pretty good. It tasted good. I’m writing this review while it’s baking so hopefully it’s edible

Used biscuit dough for the tops instead of crescent rolls. I also listened to the suggestion of using three cheeses instead of mozzarella. I have made them with ground meat and sausage. Everyone has enjoyed them thus far!

This was the first recipe I tried from Allrecipes that I really didn't like.  Perhaps if the crust was different....sorry, I just didn't care for this.
