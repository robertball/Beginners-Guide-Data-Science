I think this recipe turned out ok, I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I followed the recipe exactly except I used canned diced tomatoes roasted garlic flavor. Not sure how it could be better, maybe it's just my personal taste, but I like to use mayo or miracle whip in foods like this.
