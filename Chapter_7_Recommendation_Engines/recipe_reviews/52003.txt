I was very excited to try this recipe...it sounded delicious, and all the ingredients were exciting! When I made it however, I was very disappointed that the chicken tasted just like olive oil, and nothing else! I marinated overnight, and was really looking forward to a tasty dish, and it was all delicious, except for the main part, the chicken marinade. If I make it again, I may not use any oil at all, just the lemon juice, and I'll add more fresh herbs to the marinade.

This was just ok to me. The chicken didn't have quite enough flavor. I would recommend dumping out the marinade before cooking if you like your chicken browned. Otherwise it sort of poaches in the extra marinade. I would also recommend making tzatziki (sp?) instead of just using plain yogurt.

This was absolutely delicious as well as authentic & I'm honored to be the first to rate it. It's got the perfect mix of citrus/spice flavor (make sure to use fresh lemon juice---big difference in flavor). We added sliced cucumber in the pita & my husband had some deli purchased dill dip on the side, but I wouldn't change anything on recipe itself. This was so good in fact that I'm going to use the marinade to make Greek Potatoes, since the one offered on Allrecipes lacks any authenticity. Thanks Dave, obviously we loved it!

This was very, very good!  I marinated my cubed chicken overnight and cooked outside on the grill.  For the yogurt, I used 2/3 cup plain yogurt + 1/3 cup chopped cucumber + 3 Tablespoons finely minced onion + 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley (dried parsley can be substituted).

I also didn't marinate for 3 hours-closer to 1 1/2, but it didn't matter, the chicken was incredibly flavorful and tender. We ate these with "Peppy's Pita Bread" from this site, and it was great. My husband and 5yo son went nuts for these.

This was a very tasty recipe.  Make sure to use exactly the suggested amount of lemon juice, or even less - it was a touch strong, almost sour, but I wasn't measuring exactly so it may be my fault - in short, if you have very sensitive tastebuds, go easy on the lemon juice.  Other than that, delicious, and I agree with the other reviewer this would make an absolutely wonderful chicken marinade, especially for BBQ.  I didn't have any yogurt on hand so I substituted with sour cream - delicious, and we also stuffed some lettuce in our pitas.  Our pitas were  falling apart so I can see why using tortillas instead would make sense.  On the whole - flavourful and delicious - tastes Greek.. mmm...!

I marinated the chicken for almost 24 hours.  I added some cayenne, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I put it in a pita with lettuce mix, tomatoes, red onions, & hummus.  The flavor of the chicken was great and not too lemony.  This one's a keeper.

Easy, healthy dinner. I use tzahiki sauce (replace the yogurt), cucumber slivers & lettuce in addition to what he uses. I also have marinated just over an hr and it still works...better longer but you do what you have to do sometimes! Yum.

Oddly, had a slight taste of roasted marshmallow.  I chopped the onion and tomato rather than sliced them.  My husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  It was simple to make with easy ingredients and I can't wait to make it again.

Family enjoys this-especially good for weekend lunch.  The longer it marinates the better the flavor.  We thought yogurt was bland so we use ranch dressing or tzatziki. We also use either pita pockets or tortilla wraps.

Loved this! As other reviewers suggested, I added cucumber. I also added a little pepper to the chicken marinade for extra flavor. And finally, I cooked the onions in olive oil for a couple minutes before adding the chicken, rather than adding them to the sandwich raw. Delish!

This dish was okay.  It really needed something.  I tried it with some prepared tzatziki and it was still missing something.  Plus the kids pitas were falling apart and it was driving them crazy.

I found this to be pretty bland. So bland, in fact, that the leftovers sat in the fridge until I forced them on someone. If I make it again, I'll spice it up a bit.

Four stars for the basic recipe, but it can be 5 stars if you make the tzatziki sauce by DEBNJAMES (and add a dash of cinnamon to the tzatziki) instead of plain yogurt. I tripled the recipe, used chicken thighs and marinated over night. Mixed all the diced tomato, onion, and added shredded lettuce. Then I added the tzatziki and made a kind of salad/slaw mixture. Filled the pitas with chicken, the salad mixture, and a few more bits of chicken on top. Hubby loved it; it makes a nice, and light, summer dinner.

I woke up craving chicken shawarma for lunch, and this recipe fit the bill! I  sliced the chicken breast thinly, and marinated it for about five hours (cut back on the olive oil). Served it in a pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce. Fantastic flavor!  Totally hit the spot. Thanks!

I'm the only one in my family that wasn't nuts over this chicken.  So I decided they trumped me... I gave it 5 stars.  It's very flavorful chicken, I'll be making it again soon for guests.

YUMMY! This was good.  I only marinated for like 1.5 hours because I didn't plan ahead and I got hungry. It was still very very good.  Next time I will plan ahead more!

Marinade is absolutely delicious... I could see using this flavor combo for lots of different things.  I did reduce the oil substantially (maybe even by more than half).  I would take one reviewer's advice and pan-fry the chicken by itself sans marinade to brown it a bit on all sides; otherwise, the chicken cubes are swimming in a sea of marinade and never color.

This was OK, was hoping for more flavor.  It works but not what I was really thinking.

I did not make the whole sandwich because I was just looking for a marinate for chicken. Instead of cutting into small pieces, I used chicken breats. Although I left it for at least 3 hours, I wish there had been time to leave it longer. I definately will use this recipe again and next time will try to leave it over night to marinate.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I made my own pita bread thanks to a recipe on this site and the whole meal was a huge success.

This was so good!  I marinated the chicken overnight and the flavor was delicious.  Here are the changes I made:
(1)Used chicken thigh fillets instead of chicken breasts
(2)Cooked the chicken with the marinade first and then drained and browned the chicken in a separate skillet with just olive oil
(3)Served with flat bread instead of pita
(4)Served with garlic hummus instead of yogurt

This is such a great recipe.  I'm so glad I picked this one.  The only thing I did different was add some feta cheese.  Also the canned lemon juice didn't make it taste too bad either.  I will make this recipe again.  Thanks
