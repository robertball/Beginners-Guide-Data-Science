Greetings fellow Minneeesodan  ;)

Loved this recipe !!  Goes great with Pita chips !   I left out was the hot sauce due to my chilies kicking my butt !  Yowzer it was hot.
I also used my own canned tomatoes since I didn't have fresh ones on hand.  FABULOUS !  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made this recipe last week. I used a half of a yellow onion I had on hand ,and left out the hot sauce. Tastes amazing. Its like tapenade meets salsa.  Used Kashi sea salt Pita chips with it ,and made the mistake of letting my two young boys try it ,who then ate it all up. Had a bit of a kick to it from the chilis ,onion ,and garlic. We will definately make this again.

Can’t tell you how much everyone loves this! I’ve made it 3 times now for different things. You definitely have to be an olive lover! I cheated and added 2 cans of rotel in place of the tomato and chili’s. Works perfectly and saves time. I also used minced garlic from the jar. Get ready for the “Oh, olive this salsa!” jokes!
