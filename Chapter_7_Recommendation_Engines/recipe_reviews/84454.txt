Seriously, people, those of you who appoint yourselves as the "food police" STOP rating and commenting on recipes that you haven't tried and don't plan to.  NO ONE CARES if you think there's too much fat or sugar or whatever in a recipe, we are free to eat what we want and so are you.  Go enjoy your egg whites and mush, I'll have a piece of French toast with BUTTER and spices and real eggs.  Wonder who will enjoy their breakfast the most?  :)  Great recipe, loved the spices and butter, easy to make.  I cook this in a cast iron skillet over a camp fire when we meet up with friends to go on trail rides on our horses and it is a huge hit!  I serve it with BACON and HONEY HAM and skillet potatoes!  If it kills me, at least I enjoyed my meals.

I added a good amount of vanilla extract to the egg wash. That was the only change I made. Both of my kids said this was the best french toast they've ever had. They loved the confectioners sugar on top. HIGHLY suggest you make this in your cast iron skillet--it gets this wonderful crust that can't be beat.

These were great! I usually use Cinnamon while making French Toast but never thought of using Nutmeg, Cloves and Ginger. I would have to say I cut way down on the Cloves as it seemed to over power the flavors!

Well, I made this today for my daughter's birthday breakfast.  I made a few changes: I used day old Italian Bread, 1 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves, 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ginger.  I also have never made French toast without milk so I added some as well.  I didn't use more butter than just enough to fry the French toast.  I lightly dusted the sugar.  We enjoyed this quite a lot.  Thumbs up!

I don't believe I have ever given one star before. I could not even attempt to eat this. The flavors were extremely overpowering.

These are very good, although I think they were a little spicy for my 2 year old.  I may cut the spices in half next time.  I did add a little milk.  This made 8 pieces of toast for me, not 15!  Perfect amount for our family.

Excellent.  I added a little honey to the butter I drizzled over them and they were wonderful!  I will use only half the cloves next time because I think 1 tsp overpowered the other spices, but other than that, this is a keeper!

This was a hit with both my husband and I.  I did changed a few things seeing as my husband does not like things very spicy (I will be trying original recipe when he's not around ).  I left cinnamon as is but halved the other spices.  I also used pumpkin spice in place of cloves b/c I didn't have any one hand.   I added a little milk.  I topped mine with a little pecan pumkin butter and was in heaven.  This one is definately going in the book.  Thank you for this tasty spin on an original.

How in the world can you rate a recipe if you haven't tried it?????  Two stars huh?  I make mine different also, but IF I was going to rate this recipe, I would at least try it.  If I decided I didn't like it, then I would post MY recipe up for people to read and try.  Because I don't really like cloves, am only giving this a 4.  Really, I am just trying to say...STOP being stupid people!!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I always try a recipe exactly the way it is printed.  Then, if I find I do not like flavours or fat content or whatever - I then modified to my own taste and/or preference.  Different strokes for different folks.  No reason to bash a recipe cause it is not your style!

I don't mean to be critical, but when I looked at the grams of fat, I nearly gagged.  If you add 2 TBSP. melted butter to the batter, then you can use 1/2 Tbsp. butter for every two slices in the skillet; or use a buttered griddle or spray with a cooking oil product.  Either way, you shouldn't need more than 2 - 3 Tbsp. butter/oil total to cook 15 slices.  Omit the drizzle of butter at the end.  If the French toast is made well, you won't need it.  You can use commercially made syrup, pure Maple syrup, or sugar free syrup,
whichever is best for you.  Also if you don't want soggy toast; then after cooking the French toast, you can place on a rack above a cookie sheet in the oven.  Keep in warm oven at 150 to 200 degrees until ready to serve.  (P. S. It helps to dry the bread out on both sides in a moderate oven before soaking in egg mixture...then place in warm oven as per above after cooking).   If you think I'm a spoil sport, sorry...I worked as a cardiac RD in a hospital, and I've seen what heart attacks and strokes do to people!  It pays to be careful and you can still eat delicious food.

It makes about half of the toast (7-8 slices). Good recipe! I added a bit of milk, cut the cloves and ginger down to 1/2 t each and added 1t vanilla.

This recipe is fantastic!  My three kids LOVED it!  My 2 yr old (who is very picky) ate 2.5 pieces.  Wow!  Very flavorful and would be a great holiday breakfast.

My husband and I made this recently and really think that the amounts (measurements) of the spices are way too much!  Maybe not as much with the cinnamon...but way too much of the others, especially the cloves!  Yikes!  I agree with other member ratings - vanilla would be a great addition, and using white bread gives a true and traditional "french toast" flavor!!!

Awesome french toast. Nice, muted flavors, and not overwhelmingly and sickeningly sweet like you might get at a restaurant. I did add milk to mine, and I drizzled honey over the top of my finished product. Delicious!

This recipe is identical to our family recipe with the following changes. Add 1 Teaspoon of real vanilla and use 1 inch thick sliced bread or store bought "Texas Toast" instead of the wheat bread. You will love the difference the vanilla makes. When cooked serve with Maple Syrup instead of the melted butter.
Enjoy..

If this were April Fools Day I would say right on but this recipe with all its butter, sugar and thin slices of wheat bread is something I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.
Anyone eating this is just looking for trouble not just MI's but Gallbladder disease, CVA's just love this sort of food combo.
This is a joke...right?

I haven't made this yet although I do use cinnamon when I make french toast but certainly not a whole teaspoonful.   A whole teaspoon of each of the other spices listed is just waaaay to much spice.  The cloves alone would make your mouth turn inside out with the first bite. Perhaps the spices should be limited to a sprinkle rather than a teaspoonful.  Those amounts of spices would be fine if you were making a batch of dough for several dozen gingerbread cookies but not stirred into only four eggs.

I made this for my husband and I, it was really good. Sometimes french toast can be bland, the different spices were a nice touch. Since there were only 2 of us and after reading some reviews I changed the recipe a little...I used 2 eggs and 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, and an 1/8 tsp of cloves, I also added about an 1/8 cup of milk. This was the perfect amount for 4 slices of bread. And we prefer a light covering of syrup instead of confectioners' sugar. We'll definitely be making this again!

I've found that if you pour the ingredients on the bread and refrigerate everything til the bread absorbs the liquid, which takes about 10 minutes or so, you will get better absorption.  Otherwise, the bread doesn't absorb enough of the liquid.

Excellent recipe! This has become my family's favorite French Toast. I modified the recipe slightly by adding some milk to the mixture along with a teaspoon of vanilla. It is especially delicious topped with butter and powdered sugar.

I liked it a lot, but my rating should really be 4 1/2 stars.  Then after trying, I changed it somewhat.  I left out cloves just b/c I don't like them & used dry Texas Toast, plus I don't drizzle with butter and just coat with the c. sugar -- yum!  please try the recipe b4 u rate it -- it is helpful to us not so great cooks.

Good combination. I did reduce the cloves and added a touch of almond and orange juice that resulted in a good balance of ingredients.

I found this to be too overwhelming with all the spices especially the nutmeg.  My recipe is much the same but I pour real maple syrup over it in the end and cut out the sugar for dusting.

This was ok.  Kind of like pumpkin spice in french toast.  I always add vanilla and cinnamon to my french toast.  Probably won't make again.

I cut down the calories/fat significantly by using a 55 cal/slice wheat bread and egg substitute for dipping.  Also, use a butter-flavor cooking spray!

This was fabulous! I loved the spice and I felt like it was Christmas. This reminded me of gingerbread. I had to add some milk to thin the eggs for dipping and I added a little sugar to the egg as it's just tradition. I didn't have enough butter left to melt and drizzle much over the top, so they were a little dry, but delicious nonetheless. This would be a great holiday brunch dish. It's good for an ordinary Monday like today too! Thanks, awesome recipe.

This was FANTASTIC!! I made this for my hubby on his last Sunday with us before he deployed. He loved every bite of it. He is not too fond of cloves so I omitted that ingredient. I didn't use ground ginger either. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to it though. I used thick sliced home made bread. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This only made 5 slices for us. I halved the cloves but it was still a little overpowering and we really like spices. I think next time I'd eliminate the cloves and add some cardamom instead.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I made this for my family this morning and they loved it.  I used a little bit of milk too.  I soaked the bread in the mixture so I only got about 9 slices of bread instead of 15.

VERY easy to do. We do not usually have milk in our house so this was an excellent alternative. We also like a lot of flavor and tend to not think very far ahead when planning meals. This fit all of our criteria, had lots of flavor, and was very easy to make. The 5 servings portion made 7 pieces of french toast.

I am a big french toast fan, but this recipe was just... ok.  My boyfriend and I really wanted french toast, but ran out of milk so I found this recipe as a milk-less alternative.  I cut this recipe in half and added a tsp of vanilla extract, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  I wasn't very impressed and probably won't make it again.

I gave it four stars only because I changed it from frying it the ever so fattening butter to using Coconut oil instead. I am here looking for anti-inflammatory recipes, and I am avoiding butter and cutting way back on bread, but I am suppose to eat lots of spices including cloves, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne, rosemary, oregano, and turmeric.

I made this as per the recipe but minus the cloves as I didn't have any.  It tasted okay, but kind of just like eggs cooked into bread with some spices added. After the first few slices I made, I took the remaining mixture - added some milk and a little sugar and cooked the rest of the bread that way. I think the sugar brought out the flavours of the spices. The kids enjoyed the French Toast far more after my alterations.

These are amazing, I used some fresh orange zest right in with the egg mixture. It made such a great contrast. Strong cinnamon with hints of a sweet citrus.

I think my mistake was in using whole grain whole wheat toast.  The bread didn't soak up the egg mixture well.  Even then, the proportions of the egg to portion size was too low - I ran out of the egg mixture half way through.

Not bad, but not something I'd make again.

Super easy, delicious dish that is easy to replicate. My go to french toast recipe is eggs and cinnamon, topped with powdered sugar, but I like the addition of the nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.

Great recipe!  I used a little less ginger and added heavy whipping cream, but I'm sure the flavor intended came through.  Growing up, I never put syrup on my french toast: always drowned in butter and topped with powdered sugar!  Even through college I ate it that way, which is probably to blame for me putting on that "freshman fifteen".  If you don't want to use that much butter, don't.  I didn't use as much butter as the recipe called for and it was still good.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I don't think it's possible to make 15 pieces of toast from this recipe as written; I got 7, then I added another egg and some milk and was able to make a few more.  Used a brioche-like bread from Sara Lee, and used half tsp of clove based on other reviews.  Instead of butter I used coconut oil for cooking the toast.  It turned out okay.  I wonder if milk was left out of the ingredients.  More batter would make more sense for the quantity described, and might make it a bit more soft inside (which I like).

I love this version with just eggs! It was so easy and took only a few minutes to whip up for my toddler. Use a rich bread like Brioche or Challah for this version and you will look like a breakfast God in under 10 miutes!!

very tasty...loved this recipe.  However, my kids thought it was too "cinnamonny" (their word).  I then cut the recipe in half, but added one more egg, and then they liked them.

This is one of Fatty McGee's favorite breakfast dishes. Fatty McGee decided to add applesauce to the batter, which proved to be a smashing success as all guest were able to add 2 more inches to their waistlines. 

Enjoy!
