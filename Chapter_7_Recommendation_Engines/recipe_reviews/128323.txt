I have actually made a version of this recipe for years.  I use cream of chicken soup instead of the gravy because usually all the gravy is gone after thanksgiving.  I also use frozen mixed vegetables instead of the carrots. I don't use the stuffing because I don't like it, but I add cheese (cheddar or jack) to the top. YUMMY! I have also used chicken breast before, it's just as good and you don't have to wait 'till the holidays to have it.

What a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.I did not use shredded carrots and I put extra gravy with the turkey (heinz roasted turkey gravy from the jar).I used frozen corn and put the rest of my green beans in. I really liked this but I will not use the green beans next time - I forgot to add that you need at least double the gravy the recipe calls for because the stuffing soaks it up.

This is a keeper.  I was skeptical about adding the carrots ... but, the combinations of tastes were great together.  I added cheese as others did, but I think I'd like it just as well without the cheese.

Longtime reader, first time reviewer.  Used leftover turkey, dressing, corn and mashed potatoes.  I only made changes to accommodate the amount of each left-over item.  Used cream of celery soup & water to stretch/enhance gravy, added chopped carrot, corn, frozen peas and chopped turkey to gravy mixture to heat-up.  Lined pie pan w/leftover dressing to form "crust" and baked for a few minutes to crisp up before adding filling. This was the BEST use of Thanksgiving leftover's that I have EVER had.  Easy and delish!!!

Definitely a keeper!!  It was either throw it all away today or do something w/ it. I put everything together cold and used frozen corn and fresh green beans (what I had around).  I baked w/ the lid on for 45 min @ 350 then w/ the lid off for 30 min.  I also added cheese.  It was delicious!!

This recipe is very good as written, yet also easily adapted for your specific tastes or what you have on hand.

When I made it, I skipped the carrots and used some leftover green bean casserole in addition to the corn.  I also gave it a bit more "punch" with fresh black pepper and some onion salt.

I used this as a base recipe to make a wonderful turkey pie to use up some more of our Christmas turkey.  I didn't really bother to measure stuff, but here's how it went: turkey on the bottom with a little gravy to mix in with it (I still had turkey broth left from boiling down the carcass and it made an easy gravy by adding in some cornstarch and salt), a layer of stuffing (I still had some dry stuffing mix in the pantry, so I mixed up 4 servings with about half an onion chopped up in it), a layer of steamed green beans, more gravy, home made mashed potatoes (about 5 medium red potatoes worth - I had to make this fresh as we'd used up the mashed potatoes shortly after Christmas) with some extra minced garlic and rosemary, and topped with parmesan and shredded cheddar.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes and it came out wonderfully!  We all loved it and this will definitely go on my list of recipes to make with holiday turkey.

I did add more gravy.  The celery and carrots would have been better if they had been cooked a little before added to casserole.  they were a little crunchy.

I used up all of my leftovers for this shepards pie, including green bean casserole and the stuffing. Even more delicious with a sprinkling of parm and paprika over the mashed potatoes. Thanks Linda!

Yum - a great way to repurpose those turkey dinner leftovers.  Did not have gravy - so, used 1 can low fat cream of chicken soup mixed with 1 can of water.  Also, did not use carrots - used a combo of leftover green beans and some frozen peas along with the corn.  Delicious comfort food!  Yes, I would make this again...

Very flexible, used up almost all the leftovers. I used frozen mixed veggies in one layer over the stuffing instead of separating the corn and the carrots. Plenty of room to use up whatever you have on hand.

So good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the layering.  I put the stuffing on the bottom, then turkey followed by the corn layer, poured the gravy over all and then topped with the mashed potato's. What a wonderful way to use up all those leftovers.

Everyone loved it. Made it for a Potluck and then my family forced me to make it again that weekend because there wasn't any left from work. 

Only suggestion is to add more Gravy. I doubled the amount in the recipe and it came out delicious. Not too moist and more importantly not too dry. 

If you can't find cubed turkey and don't have left overs. Foster farms (i think it was) carries uncooked Turkey Strips that you can cook before hand and work just as well.

After heating up traditional leftovers the day after Tgiving, which took timing and coordination with a small oven, I think this was so much easier - all in one dish.  I sauteed onions and celery and added after the turkey.  I added more turkey and gravy than the recipe called for - filled the bottom of the dish that I had.  I did not have as much stuffing as listed in recipe - but spread it out in thin layer and it worked fine.

I loved that I could adapt this to what I had on hand. I used roasted chicken from last night's dinner.  I used the stuffing to make a crust.  I baked it 6 minutes and then assembled from there.  I used a can of cream of onion soup. Added some garlic powder.  Used about 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies instead of the carrots & canned corn. Partially cooked the veggies in the microwave first. Dotted the top of the potatoes with a little butter.  Baked til hot & bubbly. I will add a little cheese next time, just to try it. Loved this recipe!

My family loved this recipe!  I used 1-12 oz can of Heinz roasted turkey gravey instead of 3/4 cup of turkey gravy. I used 2 small cans of cream of mushroom. I took out the corn and carrots, but added 2 cans of green beans. I added shredded cheese on top of the potatoes. I added a little salt and pepper. Thank you for this recipe!!!

This was really good!  I added some cheese to top the potatoes at the very end, other than that I made it as is.  It reheated very well too, I called it leftover leftovers casserole.   My husband loved it too!

My husband loved this. Made without the veggies and had them on the side. My hubby always buys way to much turkey and potatoes. Made this with the leftovers and could make 2 more and still have turkey left over. Definately a do over! thanks

Perfect for a quick week night dinner.  Left the carrots out and added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I think I liked this dish better than our Thanksgiving dinner.  Not really pretty but pretty amazing tasting!

Delicious! I used cream of mushroom soup instead of gravy, and no carrots, and added some grated cheese to the top of the casserole. It was really good! I will do this again next year with my Thanksgiving leftovers.

I made this super easy recipe tonight. I increased the gravy to two cups and used corn only. It tasted great but next time I'll add cubed carrots to balance out the starch and I'll back the gravy down to a cup and a half. The most satisfaction though came from using a lot of leftovers in one dish! Thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make, tasty and warms up nice. I hate leftovers but once I nuke this and put a pat of butter on top it tastes just like it did coming out of the oven.

This was a perfect way to use up our Thanksgiving leftovers!  I literally had all the ingredients, including leftover gravy.  I will definately make this again and again.

I sauteed half a small onion and shredded the carrots into the onion mixture. I also added some sage and thyme to give it some kick. Used frozen corn rather than canned. Great way to use up leftovers.

The only items I had left over were diced chicken, mashed potatos and corn. This looked so good I made some gravy with chicken stock and zucchini/ cauliflower puree (I love the sneaky chef purees). I did saute the veges (corn, finely chopped broccoli, peas, onion, garlic) about 8 min and then added the chicken just to get it warm. Put the veges and chicken in the dish, poured the gravy over it and put the potatos on top. Added only salt and pepper to taste. Yummy.

This is GREAT!  Made it last night with cooked turkey from my freezer, Stove Top stuffing (2 cups), Heinz jar gravy (1 jar)and frozen mixed veggies (2 cups, moderately pre-cooked in microwave).  I've read reviews that called this bland, but it tastes like a true Shepherd's Pie to me.  This is a new FAVORITE.  Thanks Linda.

We enjoyed.  A great way to get rid of leftovers.  You could actually just put everything together while you are cleaning up after dinner.  It'd all be in one container and your ready for tomorrow's dinner.

My husband (a big fan of mashed potatoes) loved this one especially when there were plenty left after the initial meal. He likes leftovers that are easy for him to reheat himself. That makes it a winner in my book.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  If your Thanksgiving meal was good the first time this recipe will be excellent also.  It was easy and great way to use those leftovers. I used green beans instead of the shredded carrots.  I definitely will make this again.

Wow, this was so good!  What a great way to use up ALL the leftovers!  Carrots, peas and corn (or a combination) are all good in this. I added extra gravy (about 1 cup total) but would add even more next time, or as hubby suggested, serve some gravy on the side.  Love this dish!

I had to change a few things, since we brought leftovers home and didn't cook Thanksgiving at our house. I used the stuffing to make a crust on the bottom of a 8x8 pan.  Then I put a layer of green bean casserole,cubed turkey,  a layer of corn, some cheese, then a layer of instant mashed potatoes (prepared).  I didn't have any gravy or carrots.  Husband liked it and it used up alot of leftover.

Definitely a keeper recipe!
I sautéed an onion first and added in my chopped turkey then set aside.
But, everything else was the same and it worked marvelous! So happy I found this recipe and so sad I don't have any turkey left.

This is a good recipe for leftovers but I found it too dry. I had to heat up the rest of my gravy to put over it. It is also very "carb" heavy. I think If I made this again I wouldn't use the corn but left over green beans. Ok, I added more gravy to the leftovers and some cheese on top. NOW it is a 5 star recipe

This was a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.  I used frozen mixed veggies in place of the corn and grated carrot.  Be sure to use plenty of gravy to flavor this.  Tasty with a side of cranberry sauce.

This didn't have very much flavor even with my additions of onions, spices.  Probably wouldn't try again.  Sorry.

This recipe is delicious, but I did make a few changes.  I used all the leftovers from our Christmas Eve dinner and Christmas dinner in 2011 (which I will be doing again tonight).  I layered my Shepherd's pie in this order (with a few changes/additions): 
cooked turkey,
gravy mixed with a can of mushroom soup,
fresh citrus glazed carrots,
prepared cornbread stuffing,
fresh steamed green beans with garlic butter, and
garlic cheesy mashed potatoes.

This was a HUGE hit with my whole family, including my children that did not eat the fresh citrus glazed carrots or fresh steamed green beans with garlic butter that was served at our Christmas Eve and Christmas dinners.  BUT, they sure did eat my Shepherd's pie all up.  And, even asked me to make another... I said that will have to wait until next Christmas ;)

I have made a version of this for years with our leftovers from Thanksgiving dinner.  I do layer it a little different, first stuffing, then turkey, a little gravy, corn, mashed potatoes, then Cheddar cheese on top.  Remaining gravy is heated then spooned over individual servings. We look forward to this every year.

This was delicious and a great way to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers.  Everyone raved how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think the key is how much you enjoy your gravy, stuffing and mashed potatoes.  If they were good the first time, you can't go wrong with this.

This was excellent!  We used up the leftovers after we were done with the turkey sandwiches and it was fabulous!  I didn't have to add any extra flavors since the stuffing was already spiced and added it's flavors to the casserole. Great meal!

Great basic recipe idea for me to work from.  Wasn't able to follow it exactly but used the layering suggestions and cook temp/time to get something started.  No stuffing.  No gravy.  Used leftover corn as the vegetable.  Mixed the leftover mashed potatoes with a can of Cream of (whatever...wanted Chicken but only had Celery) soup.  I think this meal of leftovers was better than the original dinner!

I thought this was great, but the texture of the carrots was weird.  I would do peas instead of carrots.

Tasted like a pot pie without the crust!  Didn't use the stuffing, but next time I think I would put stuffing on the bottom like a crust.  Added some frozen mixed veggies since I didn't have much leftover, but this was a great way to use up other Thanksgiving leftovers.

A great way to use up leftover turkey.  I put the turkey in the food processor because I don't like chunky turkey and it made it more like ground turkey which was wonderful!

Thank you for this recipe, definitely a keeper. My family really thought it was refreshing from the same old leftovers after christmas. I used mostly leftovers besides the stuffing, I used stovetop turkey stuffing. Cooked it at 350F for 50 minutes - Then broil for an extra 5 so it browned on top.

WHAT AN EXCELLENT WAY TO USE UP LEFTOVERS!  THE KIDS LOVED IT TOO, IN FACT THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THEY WERE EATING INGREDIENTS THEY CLAIM THEY DON'T LIKE!  FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN, HOWEVER I DID THROW A HANDFUL OF SHREDDED CHEESE ON TOP AND IT WAS DELICIOUS!  THANK YOU FOR THE EXCELLENT RECIPE!

This one is a true keeper  - the best use of Thanksgiving leftovers ever!  I made it as stated, except I omitted the carrots (we didn't have those for Thanksgiving).  My husband raved, although my kids complained because all of the food was "touching."  They picked out the turkey, at least!

I made a Sausage stuffing (sausage and stove top) and then home made mashed potatoes with lumps, and I had some frozen corn.  I decided not to put the turkey in it since the Stuffing had sausage in it.  I didnt have any gravy on hand so i just mixed it all together and then sprinkled cheddar on top.  Mmmm great.. thanks for the idea!

I added green sweet peas instead of the carrots, used stove-top stuffing and had some gravy on the side for those that wanted extra.. it was WONDERFUL! THANK YOU!

I agree with the other reviewer, more gravy would make this a 5 star!  My family loved it, they were trying to scrap every tiny last bit from the pan!!!

Great idea for finishing off the leftovers without getting tired of having the same meal over and over again. Even though you really are having the same thing, it had a different and better taste to it.  I think all of the flavors baked together made the difference. Very, very delicious!  Thank you!
