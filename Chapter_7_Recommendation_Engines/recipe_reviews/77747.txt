WHOA!!! Was this homemade sausage that I just ate? It was AMAZING!!! You're not getting this flavor or quality at any drive-thru, I can guarantee you that. On instinct, I went ahead and doubled my seasonings, and I'm glad I did. It came out perfect. Plus, I added about 1T of maple syrup...YUM-O! Also, I find the mixing combines with the meat a little more evenly if you mix up all the seasonings, THEN add the meat, then add the maple syrup (opt) and mix it through once more. This recipe is awesome! I'm so glad I tried it! I made turkey sausage, egg, and chz biscuits. Delish! Thanks so much! This one's a keeper! UPDATE: Once seasoned, the meat will keep in the refrigerator, uncooked, for about 3 days or so, no problem (probably because of the salt). So if I season up more meat than I need, I just put the rest in the fridge and eat off of it for the next few days. This way, I get more of that "fresh-cooked" taste. Enjoy!

This makes a delicious and tender breakfast sausage which I plan to make again, and stuff into links!  The seasoning is great, although I used a bit less salt.  I used 1.25 pounds of turkey, and mades 10 two-oz patties, and one patty is a serving (half the nutrition data shown).  I mention this because people looking for turkey sausage are often on a diet.  You need to leave room for your pancake calories too.

Gave 4 stars because it was bland until I *doubled* the seasoning. Then it tasted like REAL sausage patties. Simple, yet rewarding recipe. Thanks!

I just made this recipe and it's terrific.  I didn't cook up all the mixture, I'm sure it'll taste even better tomorrow morning for breakfast.  I used Foster Farms ground turkey and they come in packages of 1.25 lbs.  The seasonings seemed just right for this quantity of meat, although I'll probably cut back the salt a little next time.  I used Kosher salt.  
For an experiment, I separated some of the meat mixture and added half a grated apple. It's really good!  It also adds much-needed moisture to the sausage if you're using 99% fat-free turkey.

I thought these were easy and very flavorful.  I did add a little bit of garlic, minced dried onion, and Worchestershire sauce, as well as some extra sage, and I cut down on some of the salt.  I will be making these again soon.

I have children who refuse to eat any kind of mammal so ground turkey is a good alternative, but I find the flavor bland.  I tried this recipe and was extremely surprised with how good it was!  I would use the recipe as-is for foods like tacos or for breakfast wraps for the kids.  I would double the spices to add to spaghetti sauce or my version of green chile' stew.  I like the bite of using black peppercorns ground to a medium courseness.  Another thing I did was, after mixing the turkey with the spices, I shaped it into mini patties and froze them on a tray.  When frozen I took them off the tray and bagged them... now it is easy to grab just as much as I need to cook for  a soup or sandwich.  Next I plan on trying this recipe as a base for meatloaf or meatballs.   Update:  Was recently given some store bought pork sausage, cooked some, tasted it, and it wasn't near as good as this recipe.  I decided to use the spices used in this recipe, half the amount, mixed with the sausage, and the sausage was improved a hundred percent.

This is a very good recipe. It was quick and easy. Definitly a keeper.  My husband really liked it. I had to give him the recipe to give to a friend. I added a touch more cayenne pepper and it was delicious.

This was so good.  I did not have  ground turkey but I did use ground chicken instead.  Very flavorful and quick to make.

The best sausage I have EVER tasted, bar none. :) For a 3 lb. chub of ground turkey I tripled the spices (subbing fresh snipped sage for the dried) but also added a healthy shake of poultry seasoning. Before adding the spices to the meat I first mixed them with a couple Tablespoons of coconut oil because my ground turkey was very lean.  I used a cookie scoop to portion the mixture onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment, then I shaped them into patties.  My sheet fit 9 patties, so I layered parchment over those and did it again.  I ended up with 3 layers of perfectly portioned and stacked patties, totaling 27.  Once they freeze I will cut the paper between patties and store in freezer bags.  PERFECT.  EASY.  AWESOME!

I prepared this sausage to use in a sausage breakfast casserole for a brunch. One person in the group did not eat pork, and one was allergic to nitrities, so this recipe allowed everyone to enjoy the casserole. I tried it out first on my husband, who loves pork, fat, and nitrites ;) and he declared it "excellent". I don't think I will buy sausage at the store again. I quadrupled the recipe and heeded the suggestions to double the seasonings, although I did use crushed red peppers instead of cayenne, and I did not use all the salt or pepper. The result was savory, lean, and delicious! I would say to those that find it too dry to be sure to use ground turkey and not ground turkey breast.

This is an excellent recipe that is quick to make, my whole family enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe but rolled them into links instead of patties and it turned out great too!  Definately a keeper!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe but at the end I melted mozzerella cheese on the patties.  Served some hot mayo on the side.  I'll reuse this recipe again!!  Thanks...

This is a wonderful breakfast sausage!  I made it as written for the first "batch."  For the second "batch," I wanted it to taste more like   sausage as a pizza topping...I added to the original recipe: 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes and 1 T. of fennel seeds...it tasted just like the sausage at our favorite pizza place.  Awesome recipe!!!  Thank you.

Amazing! I didn't have any cayenne so I substituted chipotle and it was phenomenal! My wife NEVER eats sausage and she went back for thirds!

We thought that these were excellent - tasted just like eating regular sausage!  My toddler loved them, and I'm thrilled to have another healthy option that she enjoys.  I made them just as directed, adding only a touch of canola oil to the pan to fry them.  My *only* complaint was that I didn't care for them as much leftover - they got pretty dry.  Unless you have a big family (or don't use the whole package of turkey), you'll end up with lots of sausage!  I'll definitely be making these again and again, but plan to try freezing them before cooking so that we can have freshly cooked patties anytime.  Thanks SO much for this recipe!  
**Updated: I now shape my raw sausage patties, layer in a freezer container with waxed paper, and freeze until needed.  I've thawed them before cooking, or even just fried them from frozen patties.  The touch of canola oil in the pan really makes the difference in a great-tasting patty!  Now that I can easily have freshly cooked sausage anytime, I love the recipe even more!

This is great turkey sausage!  My husband, who never likes ground turkey in anything, thought it was delicious.  I probably used 1 3/4 lbs of turkey and the spices as directed.  I cooked some up for some breakfast burritos (yummy) and then froze some in patties on a cookie sheet covered with plastic wrap and foil.  Once they were frozen i put them in a freezer bag.  i cooked some patties this morning straight from the freezer to a lightly buttered skillet.  Cooked them on high to sear and then lowered the heat to medium and covered to let it cook inside. SO yummy. This will be my go-to sausage recipe.  No more store bought sausage!

I love this recipe- and I also love the idea of it- yummy homemade turkey sausage with no nitrates, and you control the salt!  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings- using 1 lb of ground turkey, and only used 1/2 tsp. salt and it was perfect.  It was also so easy.  I made the patties the night before and then cooked them the next day.

Great recipe!  I used 1-1/4 lb extra lean ground turkey breast and kept the same seasonings, except reduced the salt in half.  It tasted fantastic!  I have used it as breakfast sausage in the morning as well as in a lasagne recipe that my husband loved.  UPDATE:  I have made this several times now and love the taste and how easy it is to fix.  I have used it in breakfast casseroles and in any recipe that uses sausage.  It works great.

I really liked the flavor of these (I also added syrup like another reviewer suggested) but they were incredibly dry, I will try these again with a differect brand of turkey because these had to be literally choked down.

Wow!!!  This tastes just like store-bought sausages!  My son has a dairy allergy, so we have problems finding sausage that doesn't include calcium lactate or other allergens.  This is a perfect substitute!  I dialed up the sage and pepper for our family.  Maybe add onion or garlic powder next time?

This recipe was great. I make BIG batches of sausage egg and cheese sandwiches to freeze for easy breakfasts for my husband, so frying them would have been a hassle. Instead I shape and pound the patties so they're fairly thin, like McDonalds patties, and bake them on a cookie sheet for 7-8 Minutes. Perfect everytime.

Excellent!  The only change I made was to leave out salt to reduce sodium.  I put the patties on buns to make sandwiches.  What an easy low-fat, low sodium meal.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great. I will never buy sausage again...why would I when I can make this? So much healthier and sooo very tasty. I used heaping spoonfuls on my measurements (except the cayenne). Perfect!

We loved this recipe!!  To have sausage that doesn't have chemicals and nitrates in it is just a blessing!  I used ground turkey, double the spices and added 2 TB maple syrup.  Love it!!!

This was very good! I made a double batch and used half for baked scotch eggs. The other half kept in the fridge for several days so I could form and make sausage patties as needed. The texture is a bit firmer than pork sausage but I liked that. I would be sure to use 85/15 ground turkey and not ground turkey breast or the sausage will be very dry.

Delicious! I also doubled the spices (except for the salt). Next time I would use a little less sage and a little more cayenne. The great thing about this recipe is you can adapt it to your own taste and it will still be fantastic!

This was really good!  We used this to make for our turkey sausage for our pizza tonight!!  It was awesome!!  I would next time double the seasonings though for a stronger flavor, but it was still very yummy!!

I've tried ALOT of turkey sausage recipes over the past 10 yrs and this is right on! Hubby said it tastes like his aunts from down south when he was a child. A PLUS PLUS!

This was a really good recipe.  However, I'd have to agree with the other comments about seasoning proportions with the amount of meat used in the recipe.  So, I'd suggest either doubling the seasonings or reduce the amount of meat to 1 pound of ground turkey (which I did; yielded 10 medium patties).  Also, I wanted my sausage to be a little sweeter so I added 4 teaspoons of brown sugar and an extra teaspoon of salt.  You can also substitute the brown sugar for maple syrup.  I also added 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to make it stick together better.  My "test" sample was delicious!  Enjoy & thanks 4 sharing!

This recipe is fabulous!  I doubled spices as others suggested and add thyme and also a little water to keep them moist as my sausage-maker Dad used to do.  I've had people say that they would never eat pork sausage again if they could always have these.

Quick & easy. I added poultry seasoning and more cayenne pepper. I cooked it and mixed it with butternut squash & pasta. Yum! I can't wait to try these for breakfast.

Not as good as I thought it would be.  I used ground turkey breast as opposed to whole ground turkey.  The patties and links that I made were dry...but flavorful.  I will never make again.

LOVE IT!  I never thought I would ever make homemade sausage as I thought it would be a messy, time consuming activity.  This is so easy.  I toss the ingredients into the mixer and let it combine the ingredients.  Then I shape into patties.  Tried making links once but they ended up as short little chunks so I'll probably stick to patties.  I haven't cooked with ground turkey much so still adjusting to the way it cooks - tends to shrink a lot in length and get thicker so I try to make big flat patties.  I don't like too much spicy kick so I reduce the cayenne to just a dash.   I have crumbled up leftover cooked sausage as pizza toppings and family LOVED it.  Might try adding some fennel seeds sometime and make a batch of crumbled sausage to freeze and keep handy for adding to pizzas (frozen or homemade).

I don't often rate recipes, but this is fantastic.  I've recently moved to the UK, and surprisingly sausage isn't the same here as the good ol USA.  I stood over the pan "sampling" way too much.  Definite keeper.

Who would have thought making a great breakfast sausage could be so easy?  This is delicious and so much better for one than the store bought version--not to mention the cost savings.  

I made it exactly by recipe the first time and have since been following the trend to double the spices, adding some sage as well. 
 
These patties freeze well so next time turkey is on sale--go for it!  Thanks for a delicious money saving recipe!

I also doubled the spices and added 1TB maple syrup and it was a very big hit. I made the patties the night before so that I could just cook them in the morning.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used these same spice quantities (+ 1/2 tsp dried thyme) with 1.25 pounds of ground turkey.  DELICIOUS!  I won't buy turkey sausage again.

This was okay. It tasted kind of sausage-like, but as written is had only a subtle hint of sausage flavor and the ginger/sage ratio seemed to be off. It tasted very sage-y to me. I will try again and tweak it a bit.

Jimmy Dean will not be happy because he has lost a good customer!!  This recipe is wonderful and it is now the only breakfast sausage we eat.  My family loves these breakfast sausage patties on an english muffin with egg and cheese.  It is also wonderful chopped up with scrambled eggs or in an omlette.  I have made this recipe with both ground turkey and ground chicken and it comes out great.  Instead of forming it into patties I drop the raw mixture onto the hot skillet by the tablespoon as you would to make cookies.  Then I flip them over with the spatula and flatten them with a rocking motion.  You will need to flip these over again to cook thoroughly but I found this easier than trying to form the patties by hand.  Using this method they are thinner (which is the result I wanted - my first attempt they were not uniform at all and I was afraid that the thick parts were not cooked).  It is wonderful to give to my kids knowing that it is much healthier than regular sausage.  Believe it or not, I make this with egg beaters, whole wheat english muffins and 2% cheese and they love it!

Perfect. Super easy and it's just like any other breakfast sausage but with less grease. I gave it an extra pinch of the seasonings and the salt and it's amazing.

This was great! I added sriacha and a very small amount of maple syrup. I did not patty the meat, I just crumbled it in the pan and used it to make turkey sausage gravy. Even my pork eating relatives liked this when I served it for our Christmas breakfast buffet. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Pretty good, but not 5-star amazing. I froze some of the patties before cooking and pull them out and cook when I'm ready to eat them - they freeze okay though come out a little rubbery.

Wow! Excellent. With a recipe this tasty and easy why should I ever buy premade breakfast sausage again? The only think I would do is cut the salt in half. I already cut down on it but they were still a bit to salty. Otherwise - great recipe!

This was very good.  I did like others suggested and used the called for spices in 1 pound of ground turkey.  The only other thing I could change next time (and there will be a next time) is that I'll go a little less on the cayenne pepper.  It had just **that much** too much kick.  Ground turkey is becoming one of my new favorite things to cook with!

I will never buy store bought sausage again.  I made half the batch and cut seasonings in half but the pepper by mistake.  IT WAS STILL AWESOME!!!

Very good - ours came out dry even though we used 85/15 Turkey - my tip is to cook it low and slow, being careful to not overcook.  I don't see how anyone could mistake this for pork sausage - not the same flavor.  But as a healthy alternative - it's great!  I increased the spices by 50% and that was a perfect little bit of heat.

5 star despite slight changes.  I'd tried many recipes, and this is the one my family LOVES.  I use 1 lb of meat, and only use 1/3 of the quantity of salt and black pepper, and add 1 tsp oil and 1 TB maple syrup.  Its spicy but even the kids gobble it up!

I made these into meatballs and served in spaghetti sauce over pasta.  They were very good, even if a touch spicy.  Husband said they were good enough for company.

Great recipe.. as suggested, i boosted some of the seasonings, and changed it up a bit to suit my tastes.. but the original stands well.    Those on low sodium diets can exclude salt without worry..  garlic might be a good addition.

Great sausage!! Following the suggestion of others I doubled the ginger and sage. For my own preference I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and black pepper to 1/2 tsp. Reminds me of the Sage Jimmy dean sausage. Thanks a bunch Ms. A, this recipe will be in my rotation.

This is a great substitute for pork sausage, which I love. This is also good to help lower fat & calories. I really love spice so I added extra sage, ginger and cayenne pepper. I pre cooked my patties to save time in the morning. They reheat very well.

Great sausage taste!  I would have given this five stars had I not needed to alter the recipe.  On the advice of others, I used the given seasoning measurements (minus all the cayenne due to my kids) in 20 oz of turkey because that is the amount in the packages I purchase.  I really don't feel the seasoning in the given amounts would be enough for two pounds of turkey but it's just right for 20 oz..

5 BIG stars! This was so yummy. i love morning sausage but not the calories.plus my little girl loves sausage too so i feel good about feeding her these.it's not spicy so it's good for kids.the only thing i'm going to change is using 1 lb dark turkey meat and 1 lb white turkey.i used only white last time and i think they came out a little too dry because of this.still very good.made my husband a breakfast sandwich with it :) didn't tell him it was turkey hehe ;)

I had a little leftover turkey from making "festive turkey meatballs" so I scaled this recipe and made a little bit of crumbled sausage to put in eggs or something.  It is really good. Flavor is excellent. The sage is the primary flavor, as it should be, but i did notice a bit of 'kick' from the cayenne pepper so that could be adjusted to taste if you don't care for that flavor/heat.

I used 1 1/2# of turkey, and only 1/4 tsp salt.  Next time I would cut down on the pepper--it was a bit spicy, but great otherwise.  ETA: Second time I made I used about 1/2 the total pepper called for and it was much more to our liking.  It was a little dry, though.  Not sure why this time.

Who would have thought that homemade sausage would be so good!  I always like to follow recipes as written the first time I try something before I change anything.  The only "change" I made to this was making a half recipe (I didn't want to end up with 2 lb of wasted sausage if I didn't like it) and I had to sub in red pepper flakes for the cayenne.  I'll admit that it really didn't look like it was even seasoned after mixing it.  The taste is very yummy and much less greasy.  I'll tinker around with the seasoning just a little next time I make this. *** If you want to make sure that the seasoning is to your liking, just have a small pan heating on the stove next to you as you are mixing the sausage.  Then you can fry up a small piece in the pan and taste it fully cooked to see if the seasoning is where you like it.  (I think I learned that from watching Julia Child!  lol)

I had a lb. of ground turkey, so I modified with 1/12 t ginger, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t sage, 1/4 t cayenne (like spice) and a t pepper. Added a clove of garlic and a couple dashes of Worcestershire. 
Never buying store bought again! YUM

I had high hopes for these because of all the rave reviews. I made a batch for breakfast and was planning on freezing the rest but they were SO extremely dry that I ended up tossing them. I will not be making these again. Sorry.

I love this 'sausage'! It is very easy to prepare and it tastes just like sausage.  I barely sprinkle any cayenne pepper so that my toddler will eat and it's perfect.  Thanks!

Delicious! I only used one pound of ground turkey, but left the spices as is except for the salt I cut back to a teaspoon.

INCREDIBLE!!!  I did double the spices (I eyeballed it) and think I should have left the salt at the original ratio.  I made another batch with the same ingredients doubled (but the salt) and added a small dash of thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  HOLY YUM-MOLY!!!  I cooked taste testers up and reluctantly put the rest of the uncooked ones in the fridge for breakfast all week.  Think I'll be jumping out of bed in the am to eat this!

Awesome recipe.  I doubled the ginger and other spices as some reviewers recommended and it was perfect!  Served on Christmas morning and everyone loved them.  Will keep this recipe around forever.  I think I will also cook and freeze some for quick (and healthy) breakfasts.  Thanks for a keeper.

This does not even compare to store bought turkey sausage! I made this for the second time this morning. The first time, I did not use ginger b/c I was out and I did not have dried sage, so I used poultry seasoning. I read other reviews that stated that the recipe could easily stand up to more seasoning, so I was pretty liberal with my measurements. I made half into patties and froze them for easy breakfasts, and the other half I fried up and used in a breakfast casserole. Not a single person believed it was turkey sausage. DELICIOUS!

Easy and delicious!  They were great for breakfast and didn't make you feel 'heavy' afterward.  I even baked mine (at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes or so) and they came out nice and brown.  I may never buy pre-made breakfast sausage ever again.

This works great with 85/15 ground turkey. For moistness I roll them out onto cookie sheets and freeze them a few hours. I then cut them into rectangles and cook them. Being partially frozen the outsides cook while the inside stays a bit raw.  Then I freeze them.  When we reheat in the microwave the centers cook but they stay moist.

This was really good. I made it with beef though because I didn't have turkey on hand and I made it into links. I think I might add more of the seasoning a bit next time and I am thinking about stuffing them into non-pork casings using the kitchen-aide attachments.

I keep using this recipe.  I make the patties ahead of time and freeze them.  I add a little extra black pepper and some crushed red pepper for a little kick.  I use lean ground turkey.  Thanks!

Great recipe.   I've made this twice now.  The first time I doubled the spices and it was too much pepper.   The next time I doubled the spices except for the pepper and it was perfect for us.

I don't care much for ground meat, especially turkey but my husband insists that we should be eating that instead of ground beef.  When we have turkey burgers, I am always trying to spruce up my one patty in order to make it edible for me.  So, I was interested in trying these turkey sausage patties.  It was a safe enough chance to take for my husband, too, because he loves pork and venison sausage.

I read about a dozen reviews and it seemed more than not, folks thought the spices should be doubled.  I was using only 1-1/4# ground turkey instead of 2# so I felt safe in leaving the spices pretty much as-is, which was a little less than doubling.  I did only use 1/2 the salt, however per many suggestions, and substituted about 1/2 the cayenne pepper for crushed pepper.  I added 1/2 teasp of garlic powder and about a TBLSP of EVOO.

I actually liked it and my husband loved it!  Finally, a way for me to enjoy ground turkey!  When I make it again for breakfast, I think I will try adding the maple syrup as another person did because my husband loves maple venison sausage and Egg McGriddles!  

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Now, off to Pin it!!

I made this with ground chicken - I threw some boneless thighs and breasts into the grinder, along with an onion, added seasoning, and darn, it was good.  I tried it again and, being lazy, I threw in Bell's Seasoning instead of pulling out assorted boxes and jars, and it was good, too. Talk about easy :)

My family loved this recipe and my husband couldn't believe it was turkey. Because of the package size of ground turkey at our grocery, I had to make slightly more than the basic recipe. I made the whole batch into patties, sprayed a light coating of cooking spray onto a cookie sheet, and put the patties on the sheet in my freezer until they were frozen solid. They came off quite easily and I packaged them in freezer bags for quick breakfasts for several days. I will definitely be doing this again.

Good recipe except way too much salt. I realize salt gives flavor  but there are alternatives for a healthy sausage. This recipe can easily be tweaked to one's personal tastes. Garlic, ginger, sage, fennel, onion powder or dried onion flakes, pepper flakes, maple syrup are all great additions. A bit of ground pork adds flavor and moisture. Panko crumbs is a good binder. Use in moderation and test fry a piece before adding more and you will come up with your own perfect sausage.  For making uniform sausages I use one of those egg rings. Fill mold and even with top of ring, press top of mold with bottom of small pot to compress meat, lift ring and you have a perfectly round sausage. I like to make a batch and freeze.  Great for breakfast with an egg and mcmuffin.

Wow, this is a keeper.  My family likes spicy sausage (so I added extra cayenne), and it was right on!   We all loved this recipe...don't think I'll be buying pre-made sausage again!  I made patties and crumbled and it's just awesome both ways!

Tried it for the first time this weekend. It was really good!  I added an egg yolk and a handful of breadcrumbs, although I'm not really sure I needed to. I love that you can go either way with this recipe. Add maple for sweetness or make it more savory. Thanks for the recipe, I will certainly be making it again!!!

Yum! I've made this several times and think I've got it tweaked perfectly. Followed the advice to double the seasonings - except for the chili powder, i found that made it too hot - and added about 20 turns of a popular spice company's ground garlic pepper (not sure if we can mention brand names) and it's terrific. Good for dinner on potato rolls with provolone and a side salad, good reheated and on breakfast sandwiches. I found that if I formed thinner patties, and cooked for 3 minutes or so, they weren't so dry.

This sausage was great! I added a little red pepper flakes and a spoonful of brown sugar to the mix. This will definitely be my "go-to" sausage. Works with chicken as well as turkey. YUM!!!

Looooove this recipe!!!  Only had 1 lb of ground turkey - reduced the salt to 1 tsp - used 1 tsp of cayenne because i love it spicy, also added 1 tsp of crushed red pepper  -  this is going into regular rotation!

These sausage patties turned out amazing. I have made two other Turkey sausage recipes that were more involved; this one is much better. More ingredients doesn't always mean more flavor. Yummy! My 3yr old nearly bit my finger off taking a second bite (little Piranha)!

Wow, this is so good. I buy the additive free ground turkey and I too doubled the spices, and I am now free from all commercially prepared sausage. Thank you for this recipe.

This is tasty! I tried it with ground chicken instead and my husband said he had no idea he wasn't eating pork sausage! I actually used 1lb of chicken and followed the rest of recipe the way it's written. It made them spicier!

This was a quick and tasty recipe!! I did add more spice and maple syrup as suggested, but I found the patties a little to dry for my liking, next time I will add a little ground pork and see if that improves the texture. All in all very good though, my family was pleased :)

Spices are really good but make it extremely spicy. We are not a very spicy family so I left out the cayenne pepper on the 2nd batch and it was still spicy but good.

Right off the bat it smells like Sausage.  Works great in wraps, on pasta, and even as a Burger.  I double the spices when making it for pasta or the like, and use less when doing burgers.  Thanks!

WONDERFUL! I used 1.25 lb. of ground turkey, but did not alter the amount of spices listed for 2 lb., except to use a bit less black and red pepper. It was perfect! The ginger adds a great nuance ... A keeper!

This was SO good.  Way better than any packaged turkey sausage I have ever had. I doubled the spices, and then I added extra sage and salt but I should have just kept it at doubled.

I didn't expect to like this, as I'm still not sure how I feel about ground turkey, but this was very good.  Oops I forgot to tell my DH it was turkey.  He really liked it, even though I didn't get the spices mixed up with the turkey real well.  Will use my mixer with dough hooks next time.

I was worried my husband would figure out it was turkey.  He asked me what brand it was (I told him Tyson, which was true)  ; ) and he let me know he liked our usual brand better, yet he ate several patties.  If he had known it was turkey he wouldn't have even tasted it.  I thought it was good.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup and doubled the seasoning, except for the salt.   I think next time I will add a little thyme.  I will always use turkey from now on instead of that unhealthy pork sausage.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good and very easy.  I did add 1-1/2 T of maple syrup.  Also, I cut back on the amount of salt (because I always cut salt) and I probably should have cut the cayenne since it was a little too spicy for the kids.  They ate it but complained about it being a little spicy.  I did only use a package of ground turkey which is 1.25lbs but didn't cut the spices.  I did use a 85/15 ground turkey and it was not dry.  I loved the flavor!

This recipe was good. The first time I followed it exactly and it was abit bland for me. The second time I 2x the ingredients and added some red wine and it was good. I cooked them on a grill and may have done abit too long. The next time I'm going to cut back on the cayenne, maybe add more ginger and sage and maybe add some garlic powder to it. I may do a batch where I add some soft cream cheese or marscapone cheese to it and see what happens. I'm also wondering what some sweet chili sauce would do to it.
The mad scientist is at it again...lol
Good job mom...the recipe caused no leftovers...and I hate that!

These were very good. I used all the seasonings in the recipe, plus a little garlic and red pepper flakes, but only 1 lb of 85/15 ground turkey and it was very tasty. Next time I'll use a little less salt, and we're going to try them in for biscuits and gravy. Thanks for the recipe!

Wayyyyyy too much pepper.  My husband and I couldn't even eat a whole patty without coughing from the spice (and my husband even loves spicy foods).  I say use 1/3 of the pepper and a little less cayenne.  This makes for a perfect, flavorful dish.  Definitely will be a keeper once I change that in my recipe book.

I took the advise from DivineHealth7 (thank you) and also added about a teaspoon of fennel seeds.  So tasty!  We don't even buy sausage from the store anymore.  Just patty them up and freeze it until needed.

A good friend of mine makes a great dish with spicy turkey sausage and broccoli rabe. Instead of patties she crumbles up the sausage and adds the broccoli rabe. The only thing I did was use a little more cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. Great!

I, too, doubled the spices. Instead of frying I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes then browned them in a skillet with no oil. Excellent!

OMG! This recipe is the bomb!  You can't even tell you're eating ground turkey!  For a 3 lb pkg of ground turkey, I add 2 tsp sea salt, doubled the rest of the spices, and added 1/2 t. ground thyme and 1 t. granulated garlic. I heated up a skillet on the spot (with a little canola oil) and fried up 2 small test patties.  Hmmm..very good, but maybe I'dd add the 2 big Tbl maple syrup as other reviewers did...not so good.  The sugar in the syrup carmelized (burned) on the outside--even on very low heat.  I will use up this batch but leave out the maple syrup next time.  Thanks for a great preservative free recipe!

I followed the recommendation of another review and added 1T of maple syrup and it turned out FANTASTIC! The seasonings were fine as written--I wouldn't double them as some have recommended, but if you like it on the spicy side, add cayenne.

For years, I've made my own sausage .  Using spices to suit your own taste is an excellent bonus.  This is just perfect. My husband was always very fond of the sausage gravy served over biscuits, and this works beautifully, minus all the excess fats.  Wonderful recipe because you can season and then freeze in serving sized portions.  Thanks for sharing!    rd013

This is a breakfast staple for me now, I have made double batches of it 3 times now.  I bake them and freeze to warm in the microwave. I follow the recipe, but throw in extra amounts of spice, except cayenne.  For an on the go breakfast I scramble one egg, 2 whites, add some veggies of choice, break up half turkey pattie add a little cheddar and wrap it up in a high fiber whole grain tortilla.  Keeps me full for hours.

This was awesome. I have been wanting my own turkey sausage recipe for years. my son can only eat turkey and i am allergic to black pepper so here are some of the changes i made and it came out great.   I used 1 pound of turkey instead of 2 (lots of people said they needed to double the spices so i just took out turkey since that is all i had on hand)  then instead of all the black pepper i substituted grains of paradise and then added a pinch of black pepper and you could not tell the difference.   My kids loved it because it was not too spicy and they hated sausage before. Thank you for posting this recipe.

These are terrific!!  So tasty.  The sage is a must.  Just think, they are only low fat turkey meat with seasonings and cooked in cooking spray!  How much healthier can you get?

Very good spice combination. I did double the spices, as other people did, which is why I gave this only 4 stars. It is spicy with double the seasonings, which we like. If you don't like a lot of heat, do not double the black pepper.

I love this recipe! 

I like to add craisins in when I make them.  We use half the meat but keep the spices the same - it makes for a spicy and tasty little sausage.

Serve them with pumpkin waffles on Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Fantastic! I needed some turkey sausage...and all I had was ground turkey. I threw this together and the results were awesome! I didn't have any cayenne so I used some crushed red pepper instead and it worked just fine. Wow!

Yum! Made as instructed except didn't have any ground ginger so I sub'd with some ground mustard and a pinch of nutmeg. I also added some poultry seasoning. Decreased the amount of salt and increased the red pepper.
Incredibly easy to make and delicious.
A keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have any sage so I used poultry seasoning and it worked fine.  I also cut back on the pepper because my children don't like hot things.  They loved it too.  It was a clean plate night.

Based on the comments,  I used the same amount of ingredients on only 1 lb of turkey and I added a half Tablespoon of maple syrup. They were fantastic! Taste just like sausage and maybe a tad spicier, but wonderful all the same. Good recipe to have on file for when you have guests.

I've been using this recipe for a few years now. I've also tried using ground pork and ground beef.
Very good.

I recently was diagnosed with diabetes and have to get real about changing my diet.  By replacing my regular pork sausage with turkey there are 229 less calories and 18 less grams of fat!!! Store bought turkey sausage still has trans fats, chemical preservatives, and very high sodium though. So I was so happy to find this recipe to make the sausage at home and get rid of all those unhealthy things! I wish I had known how to do this years ago because the end result actually tasted better and was less greasy than most store bought sausage I've had!  The only thing we will do different next time is be sure to choose a coarse grind of turkey.  The kind we got left it with a mushy texture on the inside even though the outside crisped beautifully.

For a turkey sausage I really like it alot.  For the ground turkey I used 1 lb 99% and 1 lb 93%.  It was a little bit dry for my husband and son but my dil and I liked it the way it was.  Great flavors.

My go to!!!!  I make meatballs and bake them.  I can eat them for breakfast or use for dinner.  I usually add marjoram and use a small amount of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  I don’t like them too hot.   If I am going for Italian flavor I add Italian seasoning and fennel.   You can freeze them to cook later, or cook them then freeze.   Always great to have in hand!!

These were surprisingly good!!  I go through many reviews before I convince myself to make anything!  I was a little unsure about the ginger, but it was definitely needed!  I’m sooooo excited to have found a healthier alternative to store bought sausage. I made mine with ground chicken! Definitely make sure to double the spices. Not sure how good it would have been if I didn’t!  This will be added to my “favorites”!

I don’t like sausage but I like these! They were a little spicy for me so next time I’ll cut back on the cayenne a little.  And I love that I know exactly what’s in it!

At the suggestion of several other reviewers, I doubled the seasoning. Great flavor!

The spice combination worked well with the 1.2 lbs of ground turkey that I had on hand. I added about a tablespoon of milk before cooking in the pan with the lid on to preserve moisture based on previous reviews. My picky son and husband liked it alot. Only gave 4 stars because the spices would likely be insufficient with 2 lbs of ground turkey.  Will definitely be a regular in my home.

These turkey sausages were scrumptious dee-lee-umptious!!
I've tried different recipes using an abundance of ingredients, this was simple and tasty.  I added a little maple syrup and kicked up the cayenne pepper a notch.
This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I took Divinehealth7’s advice and doubled the spice, but I didn’t have maple syrup so I used brown sugar instead.  Amazing!  

For those having issues with dryness, I steer away from the ground turkey breast (all white meat and dry) and I get ground turkey that has both dark meat and white meat.  Good luck!

I made this to put in another recipe that I didn't have sausage for. So, it was mixed in with other ingredients. Thought it tasted ok in that dish. Not sure how it stands up on its own. Will have to make again, and eat plain to see if it good by itself and how authentic of a sausage taste it has plain.

I will definitely make this again with modifications, mostly because I love to create different flavors.  This recipe is a great base which is surprising because there are just a few spices.  My substitutions include the addition of coconut oil, replacing the salt with McCormick bruschetta seasoning, and using chopped fresh sage.

It's a great idea to form patties and to freeze the sausages because they are really best eaten when freshly cooked.

Very moist and flavorful. I cut the recipe in half and it was too salty for my taste,  so I will use less in the future. I enjoy spicy sausage and used red pepper flakes which I left at full measure  for the halved recipe. Thank you for sharing. I'm making more today. Yum!

I’ve made this at least five times now and it’s a solid, basic recipe with room to play.  Some of the variations or tweaks I’ve made include: add about a 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and a teaspoon of maple sugar or maple syrup too (though you have to cook on a lower temperature or steam first when cooking as the sugar caramelizes quickly) . I usually add some grated apple too for extra moisture, flavor and fiber. It’s help the sausage stay juicy but the recipe is really delicious as written!

Made this the other day for work week lunches.  I didn't have sage but had the Italian blend.  Came out fine and I did "eye ball" the ingredients since it was 1lb of meat.  I pair it with string beans, brown sugar baked beans, and velveeta shells and cheese.  It reminds me of my favorite liver sausage (real dark sausage).  Perfect for gravy biscuits and this as a sausage.

I tried this recipe on a whim. and I am beyond excited I did. This was the best breakfast sausage I've eaten in a while. I love McDonald's sausage biscuits, but I won't be buying those high fat, high calorie biscuits. This sausage does not taste at all like it was made from turkey. It is a real winner.

So glad to have found this recipe so that I don't have to add maple syrup or bread crumbs anymore.  Added garlic and onion per others' suggestion and it came out really well.  I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup so that the patties would come out evenly.  I'll need to flatten the patties more next time though as some of the slightly thicker patties were still pink in the middle, while others were well done. Will definitely make it again.

I thought they tasted good, but they didn't fool my family for one second into thinking these were sausage.   So if that's what you're going for, it won't work.  If you're looking for a healthy substitute and willing to have a milder, drier (less greasy), denser sausage, then this tastes fine.  I probably wouldn't make it again, and try to cut fat another way.

Amazing!  I read the reviews and doubled the spices, less the salt and pepper. Very good! My husband and I prefer the natural food store sausage but the price can be hard to deal with and this is a great substitute.

The first time, I made this recipe as written. My family loved it! The flavor was really good and I would give it 4 stars as is. I wanted it to taste more like pork sausage, though, so the second time around, I added 1/2 teaspoon of fennel and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (I ground both with a pestle and mortar). I also made it the night before. The spices and flavors seemed to come together more letting it sit overnight.  I flattened the patties when I formed them and cooked them over medium heat to prevent overcooking. I also put a little butter in my pan to add a little more flavor. I was thrilled with the end result! Great recipe - thanks for submitting it!

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled all the spices except for the salt.  It was great! However, next time I won't double the black pepper too.  BUT there will be a next time! I also baked the sausage at 350 for about 20 minutes instead of frying.  Yum! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

It's got a nice kick! The texture is a little dry, I'd make it again with a different brand of ground turkey (I used Jeannie O in a 16oz tube).

Very easy to make and delicious! Great as breakfast sausage patties, but also great for lunch or dinner as a protein with your pasta.

I usually go through scores of reviews and accept the most  common changes as law. There was no time today! So i did it as is....except i didnt have any ginger, and i didnt feel like getting a teaspoon....so i eyed the measurements. But they were REALLY good! My new go to. I wish id frozen some. They didnt stretch over a family of six as far as id like...but two dont eat eggs, and only three ate toast. But yes! Five stars!

I love this recipe. I don't make patties, though. I  cook the seasoned meat as ground and use it in Asian style lettuce wraps or 'egg roll in a bowl' recipes

I didn't have ginger so I used nutmeg instead.  The sausage came out really great.  No more buying packaged turkey sausage.

I made it with one lb of turkey and used the spices as state.. ( A hint to u all, if u want to do a tester take a small bite, put in your microwave or fry if have time, and taste it.) I used the micro. Found had to add 1/2 tsp each more of sage and ginger. But found the cayenne pepper to much would cut it back to 1/4 tsp.  Also, like others I added a tbl spoon of syrup. I would make it again my husband liked it. I made it for him but with more spices and less cayenne like I said.

I just made this today after Kroger had their ground turkey on sale..but like everybody else I doubled the seasoning..I didn't have any sage so I use a tsp of rosemary and thyme and loved it (I'm not a fan of sage anyway.. I mix them and patted them out and using parchment paper put them in the freezer to have for breakfast

Very tasty! I doubled the spices as others suggested, omitted the cayenne (since my little ones  would be eating it), and added  a generous drizzle of maple syrup. The end result was just a *tad* gingery for my taste, but my picky  five-year-old ate three  patties and asked for seconds before even touching his pancakes, so that's a win! Next time I may do 1 1/4 tsp ginger instead of doubling it. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

The flavor was good, hence the rating, but the sausage was too dry. I really don't care for turkey and thought this might be a good way to use it as when on sale is very economical.

Having to be on a restrictive diet for health reasons led me to looking for recipes like this.  This recipe is delicious!   I doubled the spices except for salt and it was perfect.  My husband was really happy when I had him taste test one of the patties.  He said it tasted better than the store bought kind.  Will use this from here on!  Love that we can make it to  our taste and we know what ingredients are in it!   Loved the kick of the cayenne!   Thanks for sharing!!!

I Love this Recipe!  I like it a lot more flavorful so I double up on the seasoning and add a little olive oil for moisture.   Especially if I'm freezing it by batches.  

I once added garlic powder and I didn't like the change of flavor.  This is perfect like it is!

This recipe was delish!! For dinner, my boys and I made this sausage along with pancakes. It was a very nice change. Like just about everyone else, I used one pound of ground turkey and doubled the ingredients except for the pepper. Next time, I'll leave out the cheyenne pepper and when I want a little spice I'll add crushed red pepper. Oh, I also added maple syrup. We really couldn't taste it so I won't add it again. I buy a lot ground turkey for multiple dishes; this has been added to the list! Thanks for sharing!

This has a pretty good flavor. Not the most delicious sausage I've ever eaten, but it will do. I've made it several times and I have noticed that I like it much better as an addition to another recipe, like quiche, instead of as a stand alone meat. My husband is a die hard sausage fan and feels the same.

I echo some of the other comments about doubling the seasoning. I used the same seasoning as the recipe but for only 1 lb of ground turkey. Also used 93/7 as the 99/1 turkey comes out too dry most of the time.

I thought this recipe was okay, but it didn't quite live up to the 5-star reviews for me.  Right off I will say that I didn't use the full amount of salt (1 tsp instead of 1-1/2 tsp) b/c my husband is on a low salt diet.  Somehow these were both spicy and a bit bland.  Any ideas how to spark up the taste without more salt?

OMG!!!  I had a recipe for do-it-yourself Turkey Sausage, but it's being thrown away today and replaced with THIS one!  The blend of flavors is OUTSTANDING, and with the addition of a little Maple Syrup (I used 3 Tbsp.), the spicy-sweet taste is simply Heaven-sent!  My only changes:  I doubled all the spices except the Black Pepper (I used 2 tsp.), browned the patties in Vegetable Oil, and added the Maple Syrup mentioned above.  Forget the freezer case: treat yourself to these delicious homemade breakfast sausages.  Thank You, Mrs. A, for sharing!

I wanted to make turkey sausage with my new grinding attachment. I didn't have any ground turkey but I had a box of Bubba Turkey burgers.  I wanted a breakfast sausage.  I ground up the burgers that the only other ingredient was rosemary extract.   To this recipe I added 2 tsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp sweet paprika, 1/2 tsp ground ancho chili powder.  I am not a ground turkey person, but this transformed the turkey into something edible.  I will make this again with ground turkey or even grind my own using light and dark meat.

Very good!  I didn't have the ginger and will make again with that. Added red pepper flakes to spice it up to my taste. Otherwise per recipe. Much better than grisly store bought breakfast sausage and only 96 cal per pattie according to my recipe calorie counter. I used 1.5# of 7% fat ground turkey, made 10 patties.

Fantastic and yes add more spices if you like it zestier.  I even season the turkey when I bring it home and freeze the individual patties to make just the amount I need.  You can even thaw out in the fridge the night before to speed up cooking time.

This is exactly what I've been looking for since I have some diet restrictions. As others did I only used 1 pound of ground turkey and cut the salt in half otherwise used the rest of the ingredients as stated.  Try this as a meatloaf too...add one egg and a half to 1 cup of rolled oats. Bake in oven at 350 for 35 to 40 mins.

Cool recipe. After I fried them in the stove top I put them in the oven to broil for about 5 min to get the edges a bit crispy.

Yes! A sausage recipe that is super easy to make, made with ground turkey and my DH really liked it!  He is not a big fan of ground turkey, so I just didn't tell him that I had made the sausage, until we had eaten it all.  He was quite surprised that I made sausage and even more surprised when I told him it was ground turkey.  I read many reviews on this, and used the spice amounts listed above, but only used 1-pound of the meat.  I also added 1 TB of pure maple syrup.  I mixed it with my hands to make sure the spices were evenly distributed and let it rest overnight, in the refrigerator, for the flavors to blend. I then formed 7 patties and browned in the skillet.  I did poke a hole in the middle of the patties before browning as it helps the meat to not shrink.  It worked like a charm.  This recipe is a keeper.

Don't know what I did wrong but mine turned out really dry. And didn't brown up very well.

I made these camping and thought they were just OK, but a year later, people are still telling me how good the turkey sausage patties were that I made camping.

By adding sage, soy sauce, cayenne and  black pepper, to my standard turkey burger recipe with ground mushroom, and soy beans in equal amount of ground turkey  makes a very tasty hamburger.  For sausage patteis, decrease the amount of soy beans to eliminate a grainy texture in the cooked sausage pattie.  I'm thinking of adding ground flax or chia seeds.

I have had this sausage that my DIL made. Hers is very good. However, I don't care for the "bite" of the pepper, so I'm leaving it out as an experiment this time. I added more sage, because I love the sage taste. Also, I used a Tupperware Hamburger Press to form the patties. It makes them bigger around, but if you make them not so thick, they cook much more quickly. Also, I suggest that if you plan to cook now, reheat later, slightly under-cook them, so as not to make them "over-dry" when they are reheated.

This recipe was awesome! I can't believe such a simple recipe can taste so good! My family loved it! My picky eater went a second round when I served with banana pancakes and scramble eggs and strawberries on top. I did take advice of others and doubled the seasoning. I also added the syrup as suggested and I was surprised I was eating home-made sausage that tasted so real and good.

Made these this morning and hubby didn't even realize they were homemade. I use HoneySuckly white ground turkey and the only substitution I made was I used crushed red pepper along with a bit of ground red pepper. Didn't have any cayenne in the house. My choices were chipotle or red so I chose red. Turned out beautifully. This will be a staple in our house now. Thank you for posting,

The flavor for this was spot on with that of any store-bought country sausage. I did take the advice of others and double the spices, plus I left off the cayenne because my fiancee doesn't like spicy foods at all.  My only problem is that the turkey had a really hard time sticking together into patties so I ended up making half a dozen patties and then adding flour and milk to what was left for some gravy. It was a delicious meal!

This was great!! My family love sausage but usually don't get it often because it's hard to find sausages that don't have additives or it's pork.  I doubled the seasonings, used nutmeg instead of ginger and added about 2TB of liquid smoke.  Definitely will make it again.

This is such a great recipe! I know I like a lot of spice so I doubled everything except the salt and added to 2 20 oz packages of ground turkey. The only additional spice I added was fennel seed. I heated 1 tsp. of fennel in a small frying pan for a minute and then crushed the seeds in my coffee grinder. I can taste it in the sausage and it adds just the right touch for me. I cooked all of my sausage up, wrapped them individually and put them in the freezer. I can take them out as needed and throw them in a pan with my morning egg. My patties are big and only 160 calories each, according to the turkey package. It made a total of 10 patties. This sausage was so tasty and very moist. I have been eating turkey sausage for years and actually disliking it the whole time, now it will be something I can enjoy and look forward to! Thank you Ms. A. for getting me going on this one.

So sorry Ms. A, we didn't like this recipe very much, it turned out very dry and I did use ground chicken thighs.  Not sure whether it was my fault or the recipe.  I followed the recipe as written.

This was excellent.  Tasted just like sausage without the nitrates & fat.  I did what others suggested and doubled the ginger & salt & nearly doubled the cayenne.  Hubby not a big fan of sage so left that alone.  No reason to buy sausage when this is SO good.  Thank you Ms. A.  This will be delicious on breakfast sandwiches or with pancakes.

Really enjoyed this.  Never made homemade sausage before.  Used ground chicken instead and added a little parsley and thyme.  I did use a little oil instead of spray to cook in for added moisture.  Turned out great!

Great recipe; I have a low salt diet so controlling the salt content is just what I needed. I added a tablespoon of '100% maple syrup' and it tasted just like my Grandmother's sausage.

I didn't have the cayenne pepper, so I utilized the same spices I use when making my regular pork sausage.  I used fresh ginger, one Tablespoon of seasoning salt, one Tablespoon cracked red Pepper flakes, and upped the Sage to one Tablespoon.  This may be a little too spicey for some.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't use 2 lbs of ground turkey, though.  I used whatever comes packaged in the grocery meat section, which is just over 1 lb.  I used the same amount of spices as the recipe calls for, and I added about 1 tsp of brown sugar (although I think it would probably taste the same without it).  I will make this again and again instead of buying sausage (which has those yucky rubbery things in it).  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe-but it's better as other Reviewers have mentioned, when you double all the ingredients (although i omitted the cayenne completely since i was using freshly ground pepper) and since I was using freshly ground pepper, I therefore used 3/4 of a Tsp( times 2)I did not reduce the salt-i doubled this as well-I also added the 1 Tbs of Maple that another Reviewer mentioned but I may try and increase this next time. One time I made these sausages the texture was really off-kind of rubbery. Then I realized you have to use the ground turkey that is NOT ultra lean, you want the one that has 8g fat per 4oz! I didn't find this recipe to be 'dry' as others mentioned. I thought (my family) thought these were the best tasting sausages and they are definitely not greasy like pork can be so it may be easier to overcook them and become dry. Covering the pan with a lid helps keeps some moisture and kind of "steams" them as they cook.  I'm mixing up a batch right now so I'm ready to go Xmas morning. I love Whole Foods fresh pork breakfast sausage-this recipe is just as good, easy, and cheaper! Thanks!

I only gave it 4 stars for the recipe as is, but when you follow others advice and double the spices, it does taste just like packaged sausage. That makes it 5 stars.

My husband was diagnosed with moderate high cholesterol a couple of years ago... and just recently he had a catherization that lead to him having three stents. He loves a big breakfast and he absolutely loves sage sausage. His PA told me to look up a homemade turkey sausage recipe online which would be a baby step to him eating a healthier breakfast. I found this recipe with its many great reviews... he loved it and was so happy that he didn't have to give up his sausage. *** Some noted that this recipe is dry and i wanted to say that the 'darker turkey' vs the white turkey is moister and more flavorful. Of course, i added more sage but you can tweak it your way and make it your own!!

This is so good!  Definitely a keeper. I only used about a pound of ground turkey but used the same amount of spices in the recipe and it was delicious and very flavorful.

Fantastic! Amazing! Best at-home sausage recipe out there. Tastes like a up-scale breakfast restaurant made these. Easy and fast to prepare. I wouldn't be able to tell these are turkey meat and not pork sausage. I substituted ground ginger with allspice because the hubs doesn't like ginger and sage with thyme because I didn't have sage- still fantastic. As a newlywed looking to build my recipe library, this will become a staple in the Gonzalez home!!!

Turned out perfectly! 

I took the advice of others, and doubled the amount of spice (except salt), also added a 1/2 t thyme and garlic salt, and pan fried with olive oil. Very moist, perfect flavor -- kids and I both love!

Yum! This recipe had me making good use of some organic ground turkey I bought and then didn't know what to do with! I think I need to cook it more slowly to retain more moisture, but the flavor is perfect. Thanks!

This is really good for a low-fat alternative to pork sausage.  I used the spices as listed, but only 27 ounces of turkey (the one package I had).  The spices were strong enough for 2 full pounds.  I used a non-stick skillet and crumbled it instead of frying patties in spray.  I keep crumbled sausage in the fridge and use it in breakfast burritos and biscuits and gravy.  This was delicious just eating it with a spoon.  I can't wait to try it in my breakfast recipes.  LATER that week...this was great in burritos but not so much in biscuit gravy.  The texture doesn't lend itself well to all recipes.

Doubled the seasonings to 1 pd of turkey. The taste is great (tastes like the sausage that's bad for you), but do not double the salt!! My mistake resulted in throwing it out the first time. TOO SALTY and I love salt.  Tried it a second time doubling everything to 1 pd of turkey, but the salt. IT WAS AWESOME.  Will freeze, and heat for a quick out the door side to a good breakfast. Definitely recommend.

This is amazing and tastes EXACTLY like sausage without all of the fat and additives.  I used one package (1.3oz) of turkey and doubled the spices except for the cayenne (kids).  My family loved this and we fought over the leftover patties the next day.  This recipe is a keeper and I know I'll make this again and again.

I made this with 1 1/2 lbs of 93% turkey. It was too spicy for me, so 2 lbs would be better (as written). Some reviewers said that it wasn't spicy enough for them. I can only say, they must like things really hot. I didn't have sage, so I used poultry seasoning. This was a nice addition. I did cook it on low/med as I didn't want it to dry out. It was moister than I thought it would be, considering the fat content. I think I'll try adding some grated apple to it and see how that works. Over all, it's a surprisingly good recipe. I am not much of a ground turkey eater, but this is pretty yummy!

This is soooo good and easy!!  I bought only one lb of the cheaper ground turkey (so I wouldn't waste as much money if I didn't like it) and halved the recipe.  Wish I had bought more.  Fried up all the patties (I made eight) for reheating later.  Yummy!!  Will try this with chili as some reviewers suggested.

Very good -- just cooked it up and found it to be very tasty and a keeper.  I may be tweaking some of the spices to my liking, but as is it's good -- Oh, I added the same amount of thyme.  Thanks for the recipe!

Unlike the past, I have started to follow recipes exactly so I can comment.  I was expecting something a bit on the bland side, instead it was flavorful.  I usually halve new recipes and only used one pound of meat (and reduced the seasonings accordingly).  I threw the meat with the seasonings into my cuisinart (since I don't have a spice grinder and wanted it well mixed). Maybe because it was mixed do thoroughly, I did NOT have to double the seasonings.  I did take the recipe submitter's suggestion and used both sage and thyme. My husband said it was "great" and that the recipe is a keeper.

These are absolutely awesome!  I found this recipe about 6 months ago and I make these sausages several times a month for myself and my children.  I have not had store bought patties since finding this recipe.  I half the recipe but keep the cayenne measurment the same (we love spicy foods).  I've never had a complaint about the sausages being bland or lacking flavor (as other reviewers have stated) and I usually do have to increase seasonings with most of the recipes I try.  Today I'm going to double the spices just to see if that makes this recipe any better (that will be interesting seeing as I already find them to be delicious.) Thanks for the post.   You've helped me to save money and make a delicious item for my family!

Oh my goodness!  These are awesome!  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the spices.  I also fried the patties in a tablespoon or two of canola oil.  Super yummy and way tastier and cheaper than those store bought turkey sausages!  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!!!

Quick and easy, but my family didn't like the level of spice. Even when I left out the cayenne pepper, my kids wouldn't eat it.

I used one pound of ground turkey but with the same amount of seasoning. I did notice that you have to make the patties medium to thin thickness. I also added a little canola oil during frying. To really blend the seasoning into the turkey I put in the food processor. Otherwise my non-suspecting husband and kids loved them!!! SOOO much healthier than pork. :)

At the advice of others I doubled the recipe. I added the crumbled turkey sausage to bar-b-que beans for my church picnic. Everyone loved them! I will no longer buy turkey sausage but instead I will make my own! Thanks!!

I tried this recipe for breakfast and it was perfect! I did add 1/4 tsp onion salt, and 2T bacon grease (the turkey I used was extra lean, so to keep if from being to dry I added the bacon grease). My husband (whom is not into healthy eating as much as I am) really liked it after he tasted it.

MMMM-azing and kid-approved! I made the mistake of only making one pound, which my DD ate almost half of! Next time I'll cook up two or more pounds and freeze what we don't use. I like to have ready-to-eat sausage for crazy mornings. Also, I mixed the spices in with the turkey the night before to let the flavors blend. The flavor was all there - just the fat (and a little texture) was missing.

I'm an American living in a country were turkey sausage doesn't exist. This taste just like the breakfast pork sausages I grew up with (only less fat and dense texture). I am amazed! It is so good and you really don't miss the fat at all (well maybe a tinsy bit).

I normally like the "real" thing, real butter, real cream, real potatoes, but I don't miss the fat with this really good turkey sausage.

I am done buying pre-made sausage patties. 
These are wonderful!! They are not dry, just not greasy like pork sausage. My daughter likes the milder flavor of these as compared to store bought. A definite keeper.

The taste was great, but the texture was off. That outside was perfect but the inside fel apart in my mouth unlike sausage patties I've had in the past. I wonder if I did something wrong...

WOw, wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was.  i scaled this down to use up a 1/4 pound of lean ground turkey and it made 4 patties.  Very good on an english muffin with cheese and egg.
Thanks for the recipe.  It's going in my collection!

I used this in a breakfast casserole with cheese, eggs, etc.  It was very good.  I tried some of it before I used it in the casserole and I liked it better than the turkey sausage I have been buying at the store.  And I like being able to lower the salt amounts for our family.
I will be using this instead of buying the turkey sausage from now on.
