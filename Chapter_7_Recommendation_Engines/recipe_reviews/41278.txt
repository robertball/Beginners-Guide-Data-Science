My family thought this was a little too sweet and we would have preferred using vanilla pudding in place of the icing.

This definitely was impressive to serve-looked store bought.  It was very tasty and we loved it.  The graham cracker crust was a little too sweet.  I will certainly make this again.

This really does taste like a banana split.  Wow!  I actually had someone come up to me and say, "ya know, this tastes like a banana split".  I left the pineapple off because I am not a huge fan, so I added more bananas.  I felt that 2 qts of berries was a little too much, so I reduced to a quart and a half.  This recipe is a keeper.  Enjoy!

I did not care too much for this due to the Confectioners sugar layer.

Instead of the whipping cream and sugar topping, I used cool whip instead.  My family loved it!  I invited my neighbors over for dessert and they loved it also.  I will be making this over and over again.

Yhis recipe did not turn out well for me. It crumbled when it was cut and was not sweet at all. No one came back for seconds. I threw it out yesterday. It was beautiful but nothing else was good about it. I will try it again to see if it was me or the recipe.

Sounds delicious. Think I will try Strawberry Cool Whip in place of the confectioner's sugar layer.

This is very easy to make. I made it for a group of sixteen. Everyone enjoyed it. I made some changes: I substituted the filling with banana cream pudding. I also used cool whip with sliced almonds for the topping.

I made this recipe for my family for Christmas.  I did alter the filling and used 1 cup conf sugar, 1 8oz. pkg cream cheese, butter and vanilla.  I also used just cool whip on top and drizzled chocolate syrup and caramel ice cream topping on top of the fruit and on top of the whip cream with nuts and marachino cherries.  This was the dessert that everyone raved about and kept coming back for.  Thanks.  It was awesome.

I thought this was great! To save time, I also used Cool Whip. I left off the nuts because of allergies, but I might try mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top next time.

This was so good. I shared it with my boss and she liked it also. I like a little thicker layer crust, so I added more graham crackers. I think I will try it with vanilla pudding next time, in place of the filling layer. I am also going to use less pineapple. I think this would be good with kiwi in place of the pineapple as well. I know it wouldn't be just like a strawberry banana split, but i think it would be good. I used cool whip for the topping to save time and trouble. This is a recipe that I know I will make many time over.

Just seems like something is missing...  The powdered sugar layer was way too sweet.  Maybe better with a cream cheese or pudding mixture.

Everyone loved the combination! The negative comments were that it's too sweet! Next time I would probably add some sugar to the crust and omit the confectioner sugar layer. I used the cool whip + vanilla pudding mix for the top.

This recipe was a hit. I made it for my boss and coworkers for his birthday. Everyone asked for the recipe, except for the boss. He doesn't cook.I stressed to everyone, with this recipe there is not any actual cooking, which made it even more appealing. I will definitely make this one again, i recommend trying it.
