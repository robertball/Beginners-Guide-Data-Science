This was probably the easiest last minute dinner idea I have ever had.  I was able to throw it together in under 5 minutes.  I used bottled lemon juice instead of squeezing a lemon and everything was fine.  The only problem I had was with the cooking time which seemed to be a hair too long so I just took it out early.  I also mixed the pan juices into some plain white rice and it was absolutely delicious.  Overall, this was fast, easy, and good!

Oh Yum!!!!  I doubled the sauce (but not the oregano) as per other reviews, did not marinate as others had done, kept the chicken covered the entire time, and baked for a total of 40 minutes.  The meat fell off of the bones!  It was so tender & tasty over rice!  Thanks!Update!  I made this again, this time tripling the sauce and using fresh oregano and lemon thyme. I used one third to marinade some red potatoes and carrots and the rest for the chicken for about an hour.  I then threw the veggies in the oven at 400 for about half an hour, then added the chicken for another 40.  Served over rice....mmmmm...

This is a really good chicken recipe.  We used boneless breasts, though, and I didn't reduce the cook time.  They came out a bit tough, so definitely reduce the cook time if you are using boneless cuts.  It was a very flavorful recipe, though, and even my VERY picky 3-year-old ate an entire breast!  That's unheard of!

I roasted some quartered potatoes along with the chicken and served with a green salad.  Everyone liked it.  Next time I will double the ingredients for the sauce and marinade for a few hours before cooking as I found the chicken really didn't take on much flavour.  I will be making this again.

This dish was the first to go at the buffet I brought it to. The kids ate it up. I used fresh oregano and boneless thigh pieces. Also, I cooked them covered to retain the maximum pan juices, which I thickened with a little cornstarch and poured the resulting gravy back over. This held nicely overnight and reheated next day just beautifully.

This is a very good recipe for chicken. Goes nice with pasta. I used boneless chicken breasts so I cooked it the same amount of time, but changed the temp. to 350 degrees. The chicken was juicy.

What a waste of chicken!!  This was the worst recipe I have ever tried.  Way too much oregano and lemon juice and the chicken was tough.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I do not 
recommend this recipe.

Great recipe! Modified for 2 servings. Used chicken breasts. Added two cloves of garlic. Before removing breasts from oven, drizzled olive oil over meat. Broiled for 2 minutes (High) for browning. It was flavorful and moist.

I increased the amount of garlic, but otherwise followed this recipe pretty closely.  I did throw some halved new potatoes, artichoke hearts and kalamata olives in to roast with the chicken, and they tasted great cooked in the chicken juices and the sauce.  Very good recipe, NIBLETS.  Thank you.

Great Chicken! I used the juice of two lemons and added a bit more pepper and oregano. I usually up the spices in most recipes for added flavor. I used bone-in chicken breasts and the cooking time was just right. They turned out nicely browned and very flavorful. The basting requires you to stand guard in the kitchen but the taste is worth it!

This was the most succulent chicken EVER! It was seriously the best chicken I've ever made. Made some minor changes.  Used 5 frozen drumsticks - seared them in a pan in olive oil first - this gave them a TON of flavor. Left skin on - again, more flavor. Used Italian seasoning instead of plain oregano (that's all I had on hand). Used a little bit of white pepper instead of all black pepper. Measured ingredients exactly. Used 4 cloves garlic.  Cooked in oven covered at 425 for 30 mins, basted and added a drizzle of olive oil/lemon juice on top, then cooked uncovered for an additional 10 minutes then broiled for 5 minutes.   Served w/mashed potatoes (butter, milk, kosher salt) and corn (cayenne pepper, kosher salt, pepper).

This was very good.  Used chicken breasts- threw all ingredients into a crock pot cooked on high for 3 hours (my chicken was frozen) and low for 2.  After 3 hours,  I added 1/2 a cup of water, 2 chicken boullion cubes and another  2 TBS of lemon juice. Served shredded with the sauce over polenta. VERY GOOD CHICKEN RECIPE!!

I made this as written and thought it was very good. I was having a heck of a time taking the danged skin off the legs (it kept slipping through my hands), and so I did a computer search and found a great idea!  It's easy to pull the skin down from the meaty end to the bone end, and then use a paper towel to grasp the skin and yank it off.  That hint made it so much easier for me. Very tasty chicken! Thank you!

This was DELICIOUS!!! I followed the advice of other reviewers...I marinated it for 20 minutes first (and I only used 3 chicken thighs so I had a good amount of marinade).  I then followed the cooking directions exactly but I basted it every 15 minutes to ensure it  did not dry out.  It was sooo tender and flavorful. Will definitely cook again! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good, basic recipe for chicken legs, but it's not extremely flavorable.  I recommend using more seasonings and keeping the skin on. Mix the olive oil, lemon juice, and seasonings in a bowl, and then baste over and under the skin.  Bake until the skin is nice and crispy.

This was great!! I made a few changes though. I only used one teaspoon of oregano and added extra lemon juice with a little Mrs. Dash Seasoning. Also I used boneless chicken breast and baked for 30 min covered at 400 degrees. It was yummy!!

This is my favorite easy chicken recipe! I use boneless skinless breasts and I ALWAYS grill on the barbeque. Oregano is optional. I keep a jar of minced garlic in the fridge for quick prep. I throw this all in a big baggie and take camping - the longer it marinates the better! I serve with Kraft's Italian pasta salad (made the day before) to which I have added crumbled feta, sliced greek olives, peppercinis, artichoke hearts & green onions, and a little more E.V. olive oil. I toss the pasta salad with fresh spinach and sliced cucumbers just before serving.

I add a bit of marjoram to this as well.  I save some of the marinade and add it to new potatoes and baby carrots, cook them for about 20 minutes first then add the chicken...really good.  Oh I also add about 1/2 cup water to the marinade once I add the chicken so nothing dries out while cooking.  Great recipe with these changes!!

This was tasty and super easy.  The only reason I would not give this 5 stars is because there is not nearly enough sauce as written and I only used 2 chicken legs.  I would recommend using at least 2 lemons and even a shot of white wine or chicken stock.  All the ingredients worked well together and this is easy to throw together as all the ingredients are usually on hand.  Will make this chicken again and just double the sauce next time!

This turned out pretty good. I used 6 large boneless chicken breasts so I doubled the sauce ingredients which made the chicken really juicy & flavorful. I didn't have to reduce the cook time like others though. I liked how the recipe used fresh ingredients for the sauce & the aroma was heavenly! I added brown rice to complete a healthy meal. I'm sure I will make again sometime.

This was amazing... I repeat, Amazing!!!  I served it with "Roasted Garlic and Asparagus" (also found on this site)  Yum!  I cannot explain how incredible these were together.  I would suggest serving them with wild rice or fresh bagette with oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.  I used chicken breasts and sliced them in thin strips and drizzled the sauce overtop.  The meal was very easy and looked and tasted like something from a fancy restaurant.  I highly recommend this!  Thank you Leah!

This was very good.   Only thing i would change is less oregano,2 tsp was over powering. I used chicken cutlets...reduced oven temp to 350 and adjusted cooking time.  Came out great.  Everybody loved it.  Will definitely make again!

Easy chicken dish!  I doubled the sauce, except oregano, as others have suggested.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked for 45 minutes on 350 degrees.  I used lemon juice from the bottle.  Very easy and delicious!

I made this with boneless breasts - delicious!  Even my children ate every last bite.  I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time and it was great as-is.  I'd like a bit more say, however, and will double that part of the recipe next time.

I used boneless chicken breast in this recipe so I cooked it for 20 minutes, covered at 350 F, and then another 20 minutes, uncovered at 350 F. It was the perfect amount of time. The chicken was tender and I served it with penne pasta with an olive oil, chicken broth, garlic, and basil sauce.

Love it. Easy to prepare and the chicken turned out very zesty, which I really like! I had used chicken breasts and tenderloins. I think it would be better with drumsticks as they wouldn't dry out as much during the baking.

I followed the recipe, only added another clove of garlic, I left the skin on the chicken legs and placed a pad of butter atop each piece. Smells amazing! served with ceasar salad and rice :)

My guests thought this was a great recipe and they enjoyed it.  I thought it was ok, and wasn't terribly impressed with it.  It was very easy to make, and I wouldn't mind making it again.

I've made this recipe three times now and it's become one of our favorites.  I've used legs, thighs and tenders and we definitely prefer the dark meat pieces over the breast with this recipe.  Followed the recipe as written every time and it's turned out delish!  Served with rice and a salad, it's fast, healthy & yummy.  Thanks for posting!

We roast chicken breast with new red potato and artichoke hearts. The smell through the house is amazing and the taste is even better. This is one of my family's favorite meals!

As they say ooom ooom good! I tweaked this easy recipe. I don't own a grater and tended to leave reminents of my fingers on the grater. So, I halved the lemmons, peeled the garlic added the other ingredients ommitting the salt and threw it all in a food processor and let it rip. Coated the chicken and baked. I doubled up on all the ingredients since used more chicken. Juicy and delicious every time. This one is a keeper! (-:

This was extremely easy to make, not to mention, it's healthy! My fiance and I both loved this and will definitely make it again. We made with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and served with rice and fresh green beans. YUM!

This was pretty good and very simple to make.  The chicken turned out perfectly and the sauce was pretty yummy.  My only criticism is that the lemon was quite overpowering - I couldn't even taste the garlic or oregano.  Fortunately, chicken tasting only of lemon is still quite good.

We liked this a lot. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders, and I cooked this dish covered (to maintain moisture). I may have added more lemon juice than called for--I'm not sure, I didn't actually measure it as I juiced a whole lemon. I did turn them halfway through cooking, otherwise they were going to be sort of poached on the bottom (from liquid) and not matching on top. I made several chicken recipes that week, and this was my husband's favorite of them all.

Wow! It tastes good! I don't make things often that taste good (I'm notorious for messing recipes up). The chicken came out really tender with a light pleasant flavor to it. I used 3 skinless chicken breasts, halved. I covered the dish in aluminum foil on 400d for 20 min. Also, I halved the oregano. I ended up using almost all the zest on my lemon and most of the juice! I also added a bit more oil since it didn't look like there was enough for my chicken when I finished. I know people say it's too lemony, but I wonder if that's because they marinate it? I didn't marinate mine (didn't have the time) and the lemon flavor turned out very mild.

This recipe is lovely, however I found there was not enough of a sauce...so the second time I made it I transferred the chicken to a plate and then poured the leftover juices into a pan, and added a dash of white wine and a few spoons of chicken stock, then I let it simmer to create a nice sauce. I also added a bit of thyme and rosemary to the sauce...then poured it over the chicken.For those of you who don't like too much of a garlic flavour you could omit the garlic when seasoning it, but bake it with a few cloves of garlic still in their skins, it gives a very subtle garlic flavour.

Very Good! This is the second time I've made this dish. The first time I followed the recipe. The second time I made a white cream sauce then added all of the pan juice, cut up chicken and added fresh spinach cooked till wilted and served it over bow tie pasta. It was excellent. My family loved it!

Good recipe.  I used a whole chicken cut-up and took the liberty of seasoning the meat before adding the lemon mixture.  I boiled the potatoes on the stove top to avoid the potatoes taking all the juices as previously suggested.  As a base for lemon chicken I would definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

Tried it last night with boneless chicken breast. Perhaps recipe would be better with legs (because fatter) as the meat was a little dry (had to add water every time I took it out of the oven. Taste is VERY lemony, so beware if you don't like lemon all that much. Perhaps a bit of chicken broth added to the sauce would have compensated for the lack of liquid and to soften the lemon taste a little. And yet, good recipe overall.

This chiken was good following the advice of other reviewers. I double everything except for the oregano believe me you do not want to double the oregano,cooked covered expect for last 10 min.; and it turned out good. But don't expect it to be terrific it's not. Just someting that quick and easy to make every now and then that will satisfy you.

I have made this several times, but use chicken breasts only, cooking for about 30 min. at 375.  I also use a bit more salt, but then - I add salt to ramen noodles...so I think I just like salt more than the next person.  Additinally, to keep the chicken moist, I slice up the lemon after squeezing it, and place the slices over the meat while it cooks.  My husband and I love this recipe - simple tastes, and healthy.

The chicken really didn't take on much flavor.
In following the recipe it came out a little on the dry side. I would try to make it again to see if I made a mistake somewere in the mix. If it comes out dry again then I'll be looking for another recipe to try out

Delicious, already made twice in 1 week. The only advice is tweek to your taste. I add more olive oil and lemon zest than is called for. Even better as leftovers

Okay, I'm astonished! This was easy to put together, and yes a little pain in the butt to stay in the kitchen to baste the chicken every ten minutes, but other than that, I was really impressed and this is a keeper. Really surprised my picky kids said: "Wow, it's tasty! Is there more?" The only change I did was that instead of dried oregano, I added Italian spices (that's all I had), dropped the cooking time by 5 minutes, and voila! :-)
Next time, I'll try making for of this sauce. It seems not enough.

Wow this was delish.  Since I had to use ground oregano, I halved the amount.  I used 3 t garlic powder just in sake for my time schedule.  I covered the breasts when in the oven turning every now and then.  I love it.  Quick and easy gourmet.

Whole family loved it from ages 5-13 for kids and my husband liked it as well.  We used chicken breast cutlets, (a whole bag) & cooked for 40 min. instead of 50 and they were absolutely delicious!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

As a lover of lemon chicken dishes when dining out, I tried this. It was DELISH! It tasted like something I'd have at a restaurant. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and lemon juice instead of lemon. I served over angel hair pasta and some of the leftover sauce over it. It was SO easy to make! I will definitely make this again!

I am not a picky eater, and my husband will eat, quite literally, anything I set in front of him, and neither of us could stomach this dish.  The lemon flavor was way too overwhelming....I honestly am baffled at the rating that this dish has....

Although this did not taste bad, it was very plain. However, the reheated leftovers tasted better than just out of the oven. I may try to find an ingredient that will contrast the acidity of the lemon juice because I think that is part of the reason it was only ok versus amazing.

Amazing chicken.  I took advice from the comments and doubled the sauce (except oregano); marinated chicken for half an hour; and poured the pan juices in rice.  Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

As other reviewers said, the original recipe is too dry. So I doubled the garlic, salt, and pepper and tripled the olive oil. I also use 3-4 chicken breasts and cook them in a 2 QT casserole dish, or a dish sized to where the chicken breasts are touching. I marinate the chicken breasts too. Before I bake, I sprinkle the breasts with lemon pepper for extra zest. My cooking temperature is 400 degrees throughout the entire cook time of 50-60 minutes, basting every 20. The chicken comes out incredibly juicy! This recipe is an excellent starting point to alter it the way you wish.

Very good and so fast for a great weeknight dinner.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked for 25 minutes at 400.  Also had to use Italian seasoning as I was out of oregano and didn't know it dangit! Also added a splash of white wine to the dish for some added liquid.  Just eyeballed all amounts.  So good and will make again.

I really liked this. My husband, who is mediterranean, thought the lemon taste was too strong. I also used and Italian Seasoning blend instead of just oregano, mostly because of the warnings about an overpowering oregano flavor and I thought that it turned out really nicely.

Really delicious and juicy!!!  Great for reheating.  I used chicken breasts and cooked at 350 in the beginning and reduced to 325 later, but cooked them for the time given in the recipe.  They turned out great!

Very good!  We didn't have much time so I let some chicken tenders marinate for about 20 minutes while we boiled up some potatoes (for mashed potatoes).  Then threw the tenders and remaining marinade in the skillet and cooked them that way until done.  I threw in some mushrooms along with the chicken and they tasted great with the marinade as well.  I'll definitely make again!

This recipe was so good!  I used breasts and baked for 20 minutes.  They were full of flavor, no need to turn and baste and cook for longer.  Then I sliced and served over white rice.  I poured the pan juices over the rice.  Was delicious!  Thanks!

This was a wonderful, fast, healthy and delicious meal. As others suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the oregano. My kids prefer sweet sauces. I added a teaspoon of Splenda to the sauce ingredients; it didn't make it sweet, but it did cut the lemon bitterness a bit. Also, I did not have any fresh lemons, so I used bottled juice. I'm sure the fresh juice and rind would have been better, but this was very good. I served it with the Magnificent Cheesy Brown Rice.

Doubled the sauce ingredients and used six bone-in breasts.  Chicken breasts bone up, then poured the sauce over and covered with foil.  Baked 40 minutes, then uncovered and turned breasts over for 10 minutes.  Very tender and juicy!  Delicious.  Served with yukon golds roasted in a little of the sauce with some added olive oil in a separate pan.  Rounded out the meal with pita chips (from this site), roasted red pepper hummus (from this site) fresh veggies for dipping, and green beans.  Great meal for guests!

I took a lot of advice from other reviewers which helped a lot. I doubled the sauce recipe and used it as a marinade. Be aware that the sauce is very strong smelling but doesn't overpower the chicken. Up until I tasted it, I thought it was going to be gross. After cooking the chicken, I poured the drippings into some plain brown rice that I had prepared. Served with some steamed broccoli & it was fabulous!

I made this last night and my family and I were not wowed by it. I doubled the ingredients cuz we love garlic and lemon but not the oregano. NEVER DOUBLE THE OREGANO!!! If I ever try this again I would keep the skin (it didnt taste or cook right to me without the skin) I would marinate it longer than the hour I did so that the lemon could really soak into the meat. Veggies like potatoes, carrots and olives are a great addition to bake with the chicken. Parm. cheese rice balances the meal out really nicely. Not a bad recipe...just OK.

My husband and I love this chicken !!! I doubled the lemon peel, used fresh thyme and dried oregano, less garlic (my husband isn't a garlic fan), marinated for 9,5 hours and baked covered for 50 mins at 220 C (I forgot to switch the oven down to 200!) to prevent the chickens from drying out.. The result was so amazing.. The chickens came out very tender, full of flavour and juicy. I got plenty of lemony and herby sauce and poured it over a bed of brocolli.. This meal is very healthy !!! Thanks for the recipe :)

Very good and the chicken stayed tender. However, I did marinate the chicken in the herb and lemon juice mixture for a few hours before I cooked. I set the oven for 350 and cooked for around 30 mins (20 mins covered, 10 uncovered), turning and basting the chicken every 10 mins. I threw in some cut up red potatoes too and it all came out wonderfully.

I substituted lime for lemon and thyme for oregano.  This dish was easy, but I'm not a big chicken fan, so I don't know if I'd make it again.

I used 2 large chicken breasts and cut them into fourths and baked in a 9x9 glass pan for 15 mins at 425 and then for 15 mins at 375. It was a little overcooked but not too much. I also added the zest of 1 whole lemon and the juice of 1.5 lemons. It gave it a GREAT flavor and although it doesn't seem like much, the lemon juice combines with the chicken juice to make a GREAT sauce. Goes well with brown rice!

I made this using chicken tenderloins, since that's what I had handy.  I added cream to the sauce & tossed it with linguine.  I liked it, but it seems that there's something missing, and my husband said it was too lemony--but ate all of it!  I'll probably make this again, and see what it needs.  Rosemary, perhaps?

Mmm...so flavorful!  My boyfriend was concerned when he saw me disgarding his favorite part [the skin].  But when he tasted it he said that it was flavored to the bone, and the flavor usually stops at the skin.  He ate like 5 legs and told me that I was marriage material.  Thanks for the post.

This was pretty good.  Not my favorite.  It did turn out a little gray.  I took the skin off like the recipe called for.  I'm thinking that's why it turns out gray.  But I'm no chef.  

I ended up putting half lemon juice and half lime juice and adding some chicken broth so it didn't dry out.  

Overall, it was tasty.  Nice tangy flavor.

I made a few modifications to this recipe.  I used the rind of one lime and the juice of two limes instead of the lemon simply because I prefer lime. I also used Club House Greek Seasoning instead of oregano.  The chicken was tender and juicy and I really like the lime flavour.  Easy to make too.

Something wrong with this recipe. Chicken was grey and not very appetizing. To much Oregano made it bitter tasting. Baking chicken in that high a temperature, even covered, dries it out. I think I will try to sautÃ© it the next time and add a little white wine to it.

This recipes is great, I actually made it with 6 chicken thighs, and added a 1/4 cup more lemon juice. I cooked it at 475 the first 20 minutes, then dropped the temperature to 300 for an hour. I kept the foil on the whole time. It was very tasty.

Very very good. I marinaded 4 sliced-up chicken breasts in the lemon/herb/oil/s & p combo all day. As a result, the meal was intensely lemony. The next time I make it, I'll probably marinade for 1 or 2 hours max. I love lemon, but it was slightly too much even for me. I served it over angel hair pasta. Delicious. Thanks for a great recipe, Leah!

This is has become my favorite weekly chicken recipe...I think it is delicious.  I modified it to chicken breasts and only cook about 15 minutes covered, then reduce the temp to 350 & bake another 15 minutes uncovered.  I also double the marinade and after cooking, it makes an incredible "gravy" that I drizzle over rice and/or steamed veggies.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes from this website.  I do use 12 skinned drumsticks and I double the recipe for the marinade because we have such a large family but it still works out beautifully.  It's even beter using lime instead of lemon.  Every bite is infused with flavor.

Very good flavor and easy to prepare.  I took a few suggestions from previous reviewers-I marinated the chicken (boneless, skinless breasts) about 2 hrs prior to cooking.  I kept the chicken covered the whole time.  It did not dry out at all.  My husband and kids (4 and 7) really ate it up.  Thanks!

This was very easy to make! I had all the ingredients on hand and it turned out delicious! After reading the previous reviews,I did add more olive oil and lemon,not enough sauce,and towards the end of the baking time,you run out of sauce to baste with.I did keep an eye on the baking time,to be sure not to overcook.YUM! and thank you!

I loved this..it was very very yummy.  Next time I would double the lemon juice and olive oil, as I had to add more during the roasting time, and I think I'll let it marinate for a little while too.
Easy, simple, delicious.

I really liked this chicken.  If you can make the sauce a little thicker, then it would be totally PERFECT!

Great recipe.  I bet this would be good marinated in the dressing, and then grilled. I made it with roasted potatoes and a combo of zucchini and cherry tomatoes sauteed with garlic and thyme.

Excellent flavor! Great recipe, but I doubled the sauce, and also added white wine to it. Turned out wonderfully tender and delicious.

Made the recipe as written, except I used only four chicken legs.  Quite tasty as is, but I think I'll double the sauce and marinate it first as others have suggested.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was good.  I had to add more juice and oil half way through, but it was still delicious.  I tried making a gravy like others did and top some rice with it, but that was too lemony.  But the chicken was perfect!

Great healthy recipe! It tastes great and is so refreshing. I absolutely loved it, I honestly couldn't get enough. I doubled the sauce and added a pinch of dried rosemary & also added 2 tablespoons of honey because the first time I made it, it was a little too lemony. I glazed the chicken legs and poured the rest of the sauce in the pan & covered with aluminum foil. I didn't use the same temperature so it cooked longer, when it was almost done I removed the foil & let it bake for about 10 minutes. All the remaining sauce on the bottom evaporated a lot and I put what remained on the chicken legs & served it with Brazilian white rice.

Absolutely great! It got dry during the first 20 minutes; I put some water in the dish. I prepared some more juice, oil, garlic powder and oregano for the rest and it was just perfect. It's the best lemon chicken recipe I have tried.

Didn't enjoy the flavor. Needs a sweetness to it to counter the lemon and oregano. I would not make this again.

This is a good recipe overall, but I think the 1/4 cup lemon juice would be a bit strong. I used one lemon's juice, but it came out to roughly 1/10 of a cup (pretty small lemon). In the end this created a great flavor and I'll use the same size lemon the next time I make this as well.

The chicken was excellent however, I do not recommend roasting the potatoes with the chicken. The lemon flavor didn't go well with the potatoes but it was wonderful on the chicken.

I used the marinade w/ extra lemon juice and 3/4 tsp marjoram instead of oregano, with 5 thighs. The rest I did the same.  It had a very mild flavor.
NOT overly lemony!!!!

made this with chicken breasts and we found it to be nice and flavorful.  wasn't anything amazing but had a nice fresh flavor that was both different and yummy!  i did lower the heat and only baked for about 35 minutes total.  i found it to be quite good cold the next day over an asian-style salad.

This was delicious and easy!  I marinated my chicken overnight; it had just enough lemon flavor.  I did a variation, substituted "Italian" seasonion for the oregano & I omitted the salt...still wonderful!  Will prepare this dish again!

Made no changes to the recipe except I used boneless skinless breasts that I flatened with a rolling pin then cooked on the stove top.  I got rave reviews and it was such an easy meal to prepare after work.

GREAT recipe!!  My husband and I loved the flavors and it was so easy.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and it still was great.  I think next time I will marinade the chicken in the dressing overnight and try to grill it.  Will be making this recipe again!

Everyone loved it!  I doubled everything (except the oregano) - and marinated for about an hour before I cooked. 425 for 38 minutes - then broiled a couple to get a good crisp.  Will definitely make again. Made the whole house smell wonderful!

I doubled up the ingredients like everyone else and it came out moist and delicious. A little bit of a tip if you're trying to clean your grater after use use a toothbrus and oil. Helps with getting rid of citrus rind.

this was just OK. nothing special in my book. i used drumsticks and followed recipe, except mantained  covered for 40mins and broiled each side for 5mins to brown like others suggested. it was tender yes, but as far as flavor, again nothing special. i would make it again but would add lots more spices and might marinade if i have the time.

very good, very lemon-y! I used boneless/skinless breasts cut into bite sized chunks, and instead of Oregano I used Italian Seasoning--didnt have just Oregano. I also added a splash of chicken broth, thinking Id need it to stretch the sauce but next time will leave it out. I made white rice and spinach. Loved by all.

I cooked this at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, and doubled the sauce ingredients for four chicken legs. The only reason for not giving this recipe 5 stars is because I found the lemon flavor a tad overwhelming, and would either leave out the zest or reduce the juice next time.

This is my favorite chicken recipe.  I use drumsticks and take the skin off.  Tonight I left the skin on to save time, and I much prefer the skin removed.  I have a 15 month old and a 3 year old and they love this chicken.  The first time my daughter tried it she said "mommy can you make this again and again".  I usually double or triple the recipe.  It would be delicious cold or hot.  Great summer meal with salads.

Yum! This recipe was easy and flavorful - the best combination. I used a little less lemon juice than recommended and it was perfect. I can't wait for warmer weather to put in fresh oregano.  This recipe is a keeper, especially when served with herbed pasta!

I used this marinade on bone-in, skinless breast and it came out very well. Marinated overnight. I used 3 large cloves of garlic and still did not find the garlic flavour as strong as I would have liked (but we like a lot of garlic). Overall a great easy marinade.

I liked it alot! I will be making this again. Easy and flavorful. I did change a few things tho. I used only 1 TBSP of oregano, i felt 2 was too much for the amount of lemon sauce.. I used one BIG clove of garlic and also sprinkled in a little bit of powdered garlic. Baked if for the full amount of time listed, and it was just about falling off the bone. Also I didnt lower the temp of the oven.

We loved this! I used a whole chicken and basted it in the sauce as it roasted, halfway through I added some frozen green beans and roasted them in the pan juices. It was perfect with the Oven Brown Rice from this site. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe!  I always use boneless and skinless chicken breasts whenever I prepare a chicken dish.  To ensure maximum taste to the chicken, I cut it up in medallions / tenderloin style. I added extra garlic also.  Yummy stuff!

This recipe was ok...lemon flavor a little too strong, though. I added more garlic and some water, after reading some of the other reviews to tone down the lemon flavor, but it was still too strong for my taste.

This was my first stab at cooking for my family, something I try to do once a week and give my mom a break from all the kitchen stuff. So I thought I would try something simple and very different from the regular family meals we have, and came across this recipe... I am SO glad I did! I allowed the chicken to marinate for a few hours before putting it in the oven - this allowed the lemon juice to be absorbed and made the chicken so tender it almost fell apart while I was serving it onto plates. The lemon-garlic-oregano mix provided a suculent and tangy taste to the chicken, which even my picky younger sister asked for more of! Serves well wih potatoes or rice! I'll be making it again by popular request!

I'm in love!  The flavors blended really well for me.  I put chicken breasts in a crock pot for a few hours and used lemon juice instead of an actual lemon.  This chicken is good cold (think with a salad) or warm.  Next time, I'll serve it over pasta!

I thought this was a fabulous interaction of flavors. 
I did however make modifications.
I eased up on the Oregano slightly. 
I also added half and half to the dripping to make a nice thick sauce to which I added some of the cooked chopped spinach I used as a side dish, The presentation was superb!

This was a great light and refreshing recipe! It works well with boneless chicken as well, (however 20 minutes is enough cooking time for boneless). My husband, who is not big on healthy food loved it!

This dish is ok.  Flavor ok, but oregano is a bit strong.  Chicken was also a bit tough and dry.  I suggest checking chicken to see if done before 50 minutes of cooking.

I love this recipe. Simple but tasty. I use chicken breasts, and top them with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site. I then top with shredded mozza, which melts. This comes close to one of my favorite restaurant dishes. Sooo good!

I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 6 legs and it was good, however, I feel like I could have used much less effort and marinated my chicken in italian dressing.

The flavor in this dish is perfect, not overwhelming.  As it cooked my entire house smelled of oregano, garlic and lemon.  The kids couldn't wait for dinner.  my 7 and 4 year old kids LOVED this.  Both kids asked me to make it again and again.  My husband is a firm believer that lemon and chicken should never be paired but this he enjoyed and went back for seconds.  I did find that i didn't have much liquid to baste with but I added a half cup of water for the last 30 minutes and it worked out perfectly.  Chicken legs were moist and just right.

I made this with 4 boneless/skinless breasts. I doubled all ingredients except the oregano (as others suggested) and marinated for 3 hours. I baked 15 min at 400 and 30 min at 375. The wasn't bad but it was very bland. I probably should have pounded the chicken breasts, as they were very thick. Maybe that would have helped with the flavor.

This was just okay, nothing spectacular here. I used 10 chicken drumsticks and de-skinned them. I pretty much doubled the sauce and added 2 carrots, cut up into chunks.  I covered and baked it for about 35min. Definitely needed to be a bit longer since the insides were still a little bit pink.  Great lemony taste but I thought it lacked flavor overall.

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my husband who is eating healthier this year.  It was a nice refreshing taste on drumsticks.

Easy and delicious.  I used chicken breasts instead of legs and bottled lemon juice and peel instead of fresh.  Served it with roast vegetables and it was a hit with the hubby!

This recipe is sooo easy. I like to add chopped onions, and add more lemon/E.V.O mixture, becuase the lemons soak up all the juice. My boyfriend loves this recipe.

I LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS RECIPE. I USED BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS INSTEAD OF LEGS AND A BAKED THEM A LITTLE TOO LONG SO THE CHICKEN WAS DRY. NEXT TIME I WILL KEEP A BETTER EYE ON MY CHICKEN. THE TASTE OF THE MARINADE WAS GOOD THO.

Excellent - even my finicky 6 & 8 year olds loved it and asked for more. The lemon and garlic are a perfect marriage of flavors. I marinated the legs for about 2 hours prior to cooking. The only bad think was there weren't more pan juices to use for gravy after baking - yum! I'll increase quanitiy of the marinade ingredients next time. Thanks so much for sharing this.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I marinated mine for several hours and that really helped give it an extra kick.  I also doubled the recipe so I would have extra sauce.  My husband and 23 month old both gobbled it up and asked for more.

This was really good.  Was also very quick to make.  I used a lemon and a lime for extra juice.  I also made the Oven Roasted Potato recipe from this website and they went well together!  Very yummy!

This is one of the best chicken recipes that I've found so far. I used chicken thighs instead of legs. I also only cooked two pieces of chicken and used about 3 tablespoons of oil. If I were to make it using the 6 pieces of chicken I would double the amount of lemon mixture.

I am a new cook and need to feed my husband and I find it hard when I work all day and then have to think of something good and fast. This was it! We love it. I followed some tips from others by not cooking as long as instructed and added some extra lemon juice and let in sit for 20 min. before putting it in the oven and VOLA! It looks and tastes amazing. Thanks we have had it twice since I got this recipe and now its on to something new but for sure will be making this again.

The sauce that this makes as the chicken cooks down and releases its juices is absolutely delicious, I find myself making it just to have that as a gravy over mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes!  Iâ€™m making it again today and throwing in artichoke hearts, black olives, and mushrooms.  I always cut the amount of oregano in half,  and I didnâ€™t have any lemons today, so I used bottled lemon juice. This recipe is wonderful over pasta or with just a salad on the side.  Also wonderful with rosemary red potatoes and roasted Brussel sprouts.

We found that the sauce was a little to lemony o next time I will probably cut back a bit on the lemon juice. Otherwise we did enjoy it and will make it again.

Followed the recipe but cooked in a nu-wave oven.  Meat was tender, gentle flavor but more robust as a leftover.

I made it but instead of oregano I used Italian seasoning. I also used chicken legs and breasts. I left the skin on because my husband I feel the skin is the best part.:-) I cooked as directed but towards the end I browned the chicken using the broiler for 10 min. It was delicious.

I used only about half of the lemon juice from the recipe, marinated for an hour before cooking and baked for 35 minutes at 425, basting every 5 minutes after 20 minutes covered.  The chicken came out delicious.

Made this for dinner and my husband said he loves it; it was very tasty and a definite keeper! I used tarragon in place of oregano b/c I ran out. I used less salt and it still turned out very good.

I am very happy with this recipe as is. It was very,very good! I kept the skin and just removed the extra fat that usually comes adhered to the chicken legs. The chicken was moist and perfectly tender with an excellent flavor! Will make it again.

I used too much lemon peel so it was pretty bitter. Reduce that, and I think it would have been a great low carb dinner.

I'm new to cooking and this was such an easy recipe! I followed everything except I doubled on the sauce to make sure I had enough to poor over white rice. It was just perfect and tasted really good! I will definitely make this again!

I loved making this dish, it was nice and easy.  I served it with white rice and drizzled the juices from the pan, a salad and White Zinfandel. It was better than going to a restaurant.

This recipe was pretty easy to make and calls for ingredients most would already have at home. I doubled the sauce amount, as it is easier for basting and leaves enough left over for gravy. Served with jasmine rice and salad- dark greens, tomatoes, red onion, small slices of avocado with balsamic dressing . Amazing! My picky husband and kids loved it as well. I'm looking forward to making this again!

Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned the paper towel trick for the skin! It was magic! I marinated and cooked covered for 40 min. Chicken and pan drippings had great taste and went wonderfully with rice. Toddler and husband ate everything! Will definitely make again.

Awesome lemon chicken. I triple the recipe so I can have more sauce. I put cubed red potatoes in the bottom of the pan and the chicken cooks on top. Also some white rice as a side which I mixed with the potatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used chicken breasts with this (instead of chicken legs). I made this with roasted potatoes (with a bit of garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper) & loved the flavor combinations.

I followed some others' advice, and doubled the sauce (but not the oregano). I also baked some cut up potatoes with it, and it all turned out great!  The lemon gave the food just enough "zip" without being over-powering. I served this and some peas, and my family ate it up. It's just too bad we don't have any left-overs for tomorrow!

Really good, can't go wrong with olive oil, lemon juice/zest, garlic and oregano. Simple, easy, and inexpensive. I make this a couple times a month and the recipe is best with legs/thighs. Easy dinner, just have to steam veggies for a low carb meal. I usually double or tripe recipe to take for lunch. Agree with other posters to up the lemon and reduce oregano. So easy and simple. And my husband likes it too so all is good with this recipe.

I did change the recipe some but the results were delicious. I did mine in the crockpot. Used boneless skinless breasts (because that's what I had), peeled two lemons and added all juice plus probably 1/4 c total bottled lemon juice, and seared breasts in skillet. Deglazed skillet with probably 1/3 c white wine and added to slow cooker. Sauteed garlic in olive oil until almost brown and added. Cooked for four hours on low. Poured juice into saucepan and thickened with cornstarch. Delicious over polenta.

Love this! Soo delicious and easy to make. I cook 5 legs (they seem to come in packs of 5) for about 30 min - 20 min covered. I pour the juices on rice with the legs and it is now one of my go-to recipes for dinner.

My family and I love this recipe.  It is very easy, very flavorful.  I did find it to have a little too much oregano so I halved that and doubled the sauce and used a bit more lemon than called for, only do that if you really like lemon. I love how easy it is to make. We serve it with jasmine rice and any vegetable. This has become a regular on our table.

Just made it for the first time. The flavor of the marinade was really good. I used whole chicken breasts. In the future I'll try thin cut chicken breasts. The whole breasts didn't absorb as much of the marinade as I would have liked.

Excellent easy dinner, with a taste good enough to serve for company.  I doubled it, used the zest and juice from two lemons, added rosemary to the spice mixture, put the garlic cloves through a press, sprinkled with a bit of kosher salt instead of adding salt to spice mixture.  Baked it covered the entire time for convenience.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is so easy, and its pungent flavors fill the house with a wonderful aroma as it cooks -- and our tummies with deliciousness when we sit down to eat.  It works well for chicken thighs, too.  Using fresh ingredients (lemon, garlic, oregano) makes for bright flavors.  It's an impressive dish to serve at a gathering.  Roasting vegetables along with the chicken (on a separate cooking sheet) means that most of the meal is ready with very little fuss.  Try potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts, even onions tossed with oil and kosher salt.

I liked that the chicken was moist, but there wasn't a lot of flavor. Next time I am going to add more and different spices to see what happens. The lemon juice was a nice touch, though

I did this with leg quarters, left the skin on, used the pan juice on white rice.  It was great.
10-15-13:  This time I used skin-on legs and it was still good.

Easy and flavourful. I would use boneless & skinless breasts next time in order to reduce the fat and calories, as well it would shorten the cooking time.

I added zest and juice of whole lemon. Then put slices of lemon on top of each chicken breast. Used the pan juice for salad dressing I put the chicken on top of.

This was a great delicious dish. I added some extra seasonings (Adobo) because I knew it would need it. I was right. It came out perfect with the Adobo.

Tasted bland. My 2 yr old ate a little and she loves chicken... Hubby is sleeping, but I'm sure he won't be a fan of it either. He likes alot of seasoning and taste. I actually added more seasoning then the recipe called for and it  was still bland.

it really wasn't great. i followed the directions, and the chicken turned out dry, the juice very liquidy, too much oregano, not enough lemon, and altogether I'm not impressed.

My husband liked it, but I didn't. It was so bland and I followes the recipe to the exact. I wonder how can I make it with more spice to it to give it that kick?

Easy and yummy recipe !!! I replaced the oregano with some herbes de provences (made it more mediterranean ;-), I added some small white onion to the chicken, once the chicken was cooked, I boiled the juice to thicken it and poured it back on the chicken. DE-LI-CIOUS !! Thanks for sharing this recipe !

This is delicious and so easy to make.  I am a big fan of garlic so I doubled it and it wasn't overwhelming.  I made this with boneless skinless breasts and it took about 40 minutes to cook.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used chicken legs and baked them with some brussles sprouts. I didn't have a whole lemon, but even without the zest it was still lemony goodness! Next time I will marinate the chicken for an hour or so, but other than that I wouldn't change anything.

I am a vegetarian, I cook meat for my family and they absolutely loved this chicken. I used chicken breast tenderloins and I did marinate all the ingredients; those are the only differences. My daughter said this is her new favorite chicken recipe! I love how easy it was to throw together. It was a set it and forget it meal. Thank you!

I loved it. I cooked it in a pan, though, and I have to say it still tasted awesome. The lemon really goes well, but I would recommend adding just slightly more.

tried this slicing up the chicken with extra rosemary and lemon.  I did not bother to marinate it, instead just mixed it and quickly stirfried. It was good enough but lacked any complexity of flavor. would make it again if I felt like lemony meat

Yum!  I changed up the recipe only the slightest bit.  I used some thyme and basil because I didn't have oregano and I didn't feel like going to the store and it was still delicious!  Like some others said I really liked the lemon/olive oil dressing and think it would be great on salad.  I left the skin on and pushed the dressing down between the chicken and the skin giving it great flavor!  Will definitely do again!

I'm not a big fan of chicken legs, but this was so TASTY! Even my picky son loved it! I didn't have a baking dish, so took a metal baking pan of the same size and covered with tin foil and poked some holes in it. I uncovered it completely at the 20 minute mark and followed the rest of the procedure. I used a mix of oregano and basil for my seasoning and through some chopped onions into the pan 15 minutes before it was done cooking. Fabulous flavor and drippings were great over white rice. Definitely making this again! Excellent recipe!

Easy and delicious! Would definitely add red potatoes or artichokes next time. Looks a little bland but the taste is fantastic and the chicken is very tender.

Great recipe, the chicken was very moist and just fell off the bone. I served it over some wild rice and cooked some quartered new potatoes with the chicken. I did double the sauce except for the oregano, and I still think it could've been more lemoney. Next time I will triple the sauce like another has suggested.

This recipe is very yummy.  I substituted lime juice for lemons.  I cut up the chicken breasts kabob style but grilled on a pan with no oil.  Browned both sides and put under the broiler for about 8-10 minutes.  Came out delicious!!!!!!!!!

One of my favorite chicken recipes--it turned out beautifully. I used boneless breasts and lowered the oven temp to 350 as suggested by another reviewer, and the chicken was perfectly moist. Love the oregano flavor with the lemon.

I made this with boneless, skinless breasts, cut into small pieces.  There was a lot of flavor!  It was really yummy served over rice.  I didn't marinate it ahead of time, just mixed  it all together and popped it in the oven.  Easy and flavorful!

This chicken is good but is not meant to be the flavorful center of your meal. I used 2 lemons and more garlic and the flavor still came out very light. I used chicken tenders and turned them twice as I don't have a baster. They came out fairly tender and I served them over couscous with asparagus.  My only complaint is that all of the sauce burned even after I decreased the temperature there was nothing left, though the chicken seemed unaffected.

the meat just falls off the bone. i basted the legs in the juices about every 5 minutes towards the end to make them extremely tender and flavorful.

Wow this was perfect! I only made 4 drumsticks and kept the rest of the measurements the same. I used true lemon and mixed with 1/4C water and used pre-minced garlic. Yum, my 2 year old loved it too. I was slightly skeptical looking at the recipe and even more so when i smelled it after it went in the oven but after it came out it smelled great and was moist and the flavors blended well and weren't too much, this is going in my recipe box!

I loved this recipe! My 2 year old twins NEVER eat chicken and they both ate everything! I made some white rice and put the gravy from the pan over the rice and it turned out GREAT!!! I will be making this dish again! It was quick and easy!!! Thanks

Excellent chicken recipe. I cut up a green pepper, half an onion, a tomato, and some cauliflower and roasted them with the chicken. Once the chicken was cooked through I put the whole pan under the grill/broiler element which made the chicken and the veg get crispy. 

Next time I will mix the marinade earlier and make more of it and let the chicken sit in it before cooking.

Overall, wonderful recipe! Thank you for submitting.

I don't have a baster, so I was worried about this recipe turning out dry. However, that was FAR from the result. During the first half of cooking I covered the chicken with tin foil. Throughout the entire recipe I turned the chicken drumsticks over every 10 minutes or so.

These turned out absolutely wonderful, moist, and flavorful, and went great with the white potatoes I chopped in there. I'm definitely going to put this in my recipe box and make this in the future!

This chicken is great! It has a very light flavor and is just amazing. Made it for a friends night over and everyone loved it! It's easy and quick, and I certainly will make it again.

Very yummy indeed!  Didn't change a thing except that I used skinless bone in chicken breasts.  Turned out nice and moist and loved all of the flavours mixed together!  I did let my chicken sit in the mixture for about an hour before baking them, only because I was waiting for hubby to be on his way home.  Thanks for the quick but delicious recipe!

I made this exactly as written minus the salt (low sodium diet). It was quite tasty and very easy. The only thing I will do differently next time is marinate the chicken for 30min-1hr to let the flavor come through a bit more. I will definitely make this one again!

Loved it. I'm always looking for recipes where I can utilize bone-in chicken breast,  which I prefer to boneless. That the recipe uses skinned chicken is another bonus; the flavor goes more "into" the chicken then just resting on top of it. And it's healthier too! I did add a splash more olive oil and will probably double the recipe for the sauce next time, as the pan drippings were good but a bit skimpy. Thanks, Niblets!

My chicken came out more poached than baked. I made this up early in the day and left the baking dish in the fridge marinating.  The flavor was nice and maybe next time I would cook uncovered the whole time or use less lemon juice. With so may other recipes I don't know that I will try this one again too soon.

Very nice flavor.  I marinated the drumsticks all day which really brought out the flavor of the marinade without making it too lemony.  I added a dash of thyme and served it with plain white rice. I will definitely make this again.

Used chicken breasts and cooked for 25 mintues. It turned out great! I used pan dripping + chicken bouillon cube and cornstarch for a gravy on mashed potatoes!

The combination of flavors in this recipe is excellent creating a great tasting dish.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it did not make enough sauce for continued basting(even with using 1 and 1/2 lemons and ~2 T. olive oil).  I will definitely make again however I will likely save some sauce on the side to add for basting.  Overall it was a very tasty and unique dish.

I thought this was a good recipe! Nothing like the ordinary baked chicken. Me & My Husband enjoyed it very much. I had a few more legs than the recipe called for, so I added a few more ingredients. Still turned out great! I also put some potatoes in with it, although I should have put more bc they didn't last long.. Next time I will add more potatoes and maybe use one of the suggestions from here and add some half & half cream. Great recipe. Thank you!

This is one of my favorite easy to make dishes on the website!  I have made it at least 3-4 times now, and every time, my guests have enjoyed it.  Adding a little extra lemon juice and ingredients to the pan is great, because then I can  use it on some white rice with the chicken!!  Thanks so much for posting it!

This recipe was awesome. I did make a large batch using drumsticks and started getting lazy with removing the skin. So stick to the recipe and remove the skin...you'll appreciate the seasonings.

I made this twice this week - my fiance and I love it!  I use boneless/skinless chicken breasts and I double all ingredients except the oregano.  Lemon juice works as well as lemon itself - I didn't notice any difference.  Overall, this recipe is fantastic.  I'm glad I found it.

I love this recipe.  It really can't be beat if you are looking for something quick and easy, that doesn't taste like it was made last minute.  I also love the versitility as the chicken is good in a salad over pasta or alone as an entree.  I have made this numerous times and it has become a much requested family favorite.  Of course, everyone has their own tastes, but I usually make the sauce as written (we love it that way), and I adjust the cooking time based on the cut of chicken I happen to have on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was wonderful! I used thin boneless/skinless chicken breasts and adjusted the cooking time accordingly. I also used "Italian Seasoning", instead of dried oregano since that is what we had. My it was super quick to make and my husband and 18 month old loved it! I like bold flavors so I probably used more garlic too. I definitely will be making this again.

My husband doesn't particularly care for "healthy" chicken. He loved this and asked me to add it to the recipe box. So nice to find a lemon chicken recipe that actually has flavor.

This was a great recipe. I just made some adjustments. I used drumsticks instead of leg quarters. Used about 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8 tsp. garlic salt, 1/8 tsp. lemon pepper, & 2 tbsp. of lemon juice from bottle. Cooked in oven for 1st 30 minutes at 425 F & then put on grill at medium low heat, occasionally sprinkling with small amount of the 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8 tsp. garlic salt, & 1/8 tsp. lemon pepper & cooked for an additional 10 â€“ 12 minutes. Served with mixed vegetables in butter, salt, & pepper & creamy basil rotini. (For 2 servings)

It's OK and it's easy, but my husband decided he preferred his chicken fried.

I used chicken thighs with skin on, lifted the skin and put some of the seasoning and a lemon slice under skin (as well as on top of chicken) baked uncovered.  Used to get chicken similar to this at a  local greek restaurant, don't need to leave home now.  Excellent.

This is soooooo good!!! Also very yummy on baby red potatoes -or any potatoes I'm sure- instead of chicken. I've been doing the chicken for 5 years now, and I can never stop myself from eating way too much of it!

I used 5 breasts that I tenderized.  As written, I see how this would turn out dry(as evidenced by many complaints in the reviews).  I left the lid on all the time, and also added a little lemon-flavored water.  My chicken was not dry even with the breasts.  My problem was that all I could taste was the overpowering pungency of oregano.  This was quick, easy, and very low fat but would not make again.

i marinated this for 30 mins...next time i would cut down on the lemon juice a bit, the flavor was a bit strong. i would also not use the full amount of oregano, i used one teaspoon and it was plenty. i really enjoyed the recipie and will be making it again, thank you!

Easy and delicious!  I used skinless breasts.  Added a little fresh rosemary and let the chicken marinate in the mixture for a couple of hours before baking.  The smell was amazing and the chicken was moist and full of flavor-will do again!

Make sure you continuously add water to it, it will dry out very fast! Other than that it's a great recipe. Try serving it with sauteed zuchini and yellow squash with some lemon pepper seasoning sprinkled on it.

My husband loved it.  I used a whole cut up chicken and I think using just the legs and thighs would have been best. They turned out better than the breast and back.

Very nice flavor.  This is a very easy dish to prepare.  I served it with rice pilaf and steamed carrots.

I marinated the chicken for a couple hours, and like other reviewers, loved the flavor, but wished I had a little more of the yummy juice to spoon over my chicken and rice.  I will AT LEAST double the marinade ingredients next time!

This was juicy and packed with flavor! I mixed the marinade in a measuring cup, dipped (and rotated) the chicken in it and then spooned the rest of it over the chicken once it was in the baking pan. I thought it went great with rice. Delicious!

I'm giving it 3 stars to be generous. I must have done something terribly wrong. Neither one of us liked this one.  It was dry on the inside and soggy on the outside.  We'll not be trying this again.

Needs more sauce to baste with, but overall a wonderfully simple flavor and recipe. Goes well with the yogurt sauce pasta and a side of broccolli or asparagus.

I am always making different meals and this one had a great different taste.
