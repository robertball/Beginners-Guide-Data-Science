I've made this twice now.  The first time I found the sauce gummy and thought adding the flour ruined a beautiful sauce.  So the second time I dropped the second can of broth and flour and instead whisked in 2 tablespoons of cold unsalted butter to thicken the sauce.  The butter adds richness, intensfies the flavors and gives the sauce a lovely sheen.  Because beef broth can be very weak tasting, I added 2 tablespoons of beef demi-glace.

This was easy, fairly quick, and lovely!  Rather than grill the steak, I cut it into bite-size pieces and browned it before cooking the mushrooms, etc.

WOW!  This was fabulous - my husband was blubbering with happiness over this dish.  We added a bit of fresh rosemary to the sauce BEFORE reducing it - I think it added a terrific flavor.  Also omitted any added salt since the broth is salty (used 99% fat free).  Did not grill the sirloin tip but cooked it in the oven and it turned out great.  Will absolutely make this again!

Classic indeed. Only used 1 cup of wine and 1 can of broth to start. Reduced it to 1/2 to intensify a bit more and added another cup of broth with the flour wisked into that. Also added the nummy juices from the grilled steak from the "resting" plate. Only used 2 4" portabella caps, that was plenty. This was the perfect companion for a candlelite dinner and a bottle of good wine. Thank you.

I thought this was a solid, reliable mushroom sauce -- nothing out-of-this-world unique, but just right when you want something classic.  We used this over sirloin steaks, and it worked out great.  Preparation was easy and the kind of thing you can have on the stove while multitasking preparation for something else!   I used plenty of garlic -- probably quadruple what the recipe called for.   I used cornstarch instead of flour for thickening, and I would NOT recommend doing that -- it made it a bit too gooey.  Next time I will definitely try flour.  Great overall though!

I though this recipe was very good!  I halved the amount of wine and broth needed for the sauce and I still ended up with enough for leftovers.  Instead of using a shallot, I used a vidalia onion because that's what I had on hand and I like the taste.

I have made this mushroom sauce many times and I have to say it is wonderful!  I use a cabernet that I would drink in a glass.  Cheap wine has no place in this recipe!
It cost more to make but it is oh so worth it!

Came in late last night after soccer practices and games, the computer was down so I couldn't access allrecipes to get my recipe and I just tried to remember the best that I could. After I mixed in the ingredients, the computer comes back up and wouldn't you know, I had combined two different recipes. I will be posting the same review for both because it worked great.
I used regular portabellas and used no flour in this recipe. I think the sirloin maybe was a little dried out and next time I wouldn't brown as long as I did. However, the sauce was great when combined with the other recipe (see reviews). Went great with Yellow Tail Shiraz Cab and I actually used a straight Shiraz instead of burgundy in the recipe. Very good recipe.

I thought this was very good...hubby liked as well.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I will make in the future is to cut down on the wine and to add garlic to the dish.  Overall the taste was very flavorful (but I think the wine was a little dominant).  Will definately make again, thanks for thepost.

This recipe is the bomb. 
I pan fried Sirloin steaks and used the same pan w/sucs to make the sauce while the meat was resting, Added the resting meat juices to the sauce. Shake your flour w/h20 in a jar b4 adding to sauce to prevent lumps.

This was great! Granted I made A LOT of changes but the end product was perfect for my family. I had a pkg of 1lb frozen cubed chuck roast that I just through in the slow cooker still frozen. I added 4 large portobello mushrooms caps sliced on top of the meat and 4 cups beef broth mixed with about 1 T. of minced garlic, about 1/2c red cooking wine and some thyme. Put the broth mixture over the mushrooms and meat and topped the mushrooms off with 4 divided Tbs of butter. I set the slow cooker on low for 6hrs but really it was done after only 4. To serve it I gave the kids just the cubed meat with ketchup and the mushrooms on the side along with steamed edamame. For the hubbie and me I made garlic toast on French bread with mozzarella cheese and layered with the meat and mushrooms to make a sandwich and then served with a side of au jus. Next time I'll use 2lb meat and maybe 5 or 6 mushrooms caps. Thanks for the starting off point!

Update: I made this for a group of 6 adults and 3 kids and used 4 lbs cubed beef with 8 large sliced portobello mushrooms caps, and 3 pkgs of sliced baby Bella mushrooms (that I had to add to the slow cooker over time as the other mushrooms shrank and made room for more).  I added the red wine, beef broth,  butter and garlic as I had previously but adjusted for the extra food and again served over garlic bread with melted cheese on it and a side of au jus. Also  I made it in the slow cooker cooked on low for about 8 hrs.  This was great and a huge h

Good recipe but not great because it just needs more flavor. I suggest using fresh rosemary instead of thyme and triple the shallots. The wine flavor was just not strong enough so I added more at the last minute.  Mushrooms were the best part. I give a 3-star rating because I think recipes need to be great if you follow them. If much tweaking is needed then the rating should drop.

Pretty good. I didn't have any wine so I didn't use any which probably made a difference! I would HIGHLY recommend low sodium beef broth. I did not and the salt overpowered the sauce.

Fantastic with the few ingredients involved.  I don't grill, so I seared large cubes of sirloin and let it simmer in my dutch oven for 4 hours.  Very tender meat.  I would use less butter next time because 1/4 cup was just too much for my taste.  Also I used more broth to compensate for the omission of wine.  I subbed rosemary for the thyme.

Kids (fussy little ones) LOVED it ...so did rest of family!

This was a big hit. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I used a $12 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. The sauce is amazing!! Don't rush the thickening of the sauce and it will be perfect.

Very good.  I didn't grill my sirloin tips, I cooked them in beef broth on the stove, over low heat for a couple of hours.  They were very tender.
My sauce didn't thicken as well as I would have liked, but my husband and sons didn't care.  They thought it was great.  It was very easy and I didn't have any leftovers.  This one is a keeper!

Very good.  I used sirloin tips, browned in the pan with some EVOO, then followed the recipe but did add 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of thyme.  Easy to make and hubby enjoyed it.

The sauce for this recipe was delicious! I served it over filet mignon instead of with the tips and it was wonderful. We used 1 1/2 cups of the burgundy wine and the flavor was just right. Also used regular sliced mushrooms instead of portabella. Will definitely be making this one again. Thanks!

This was wonderful! I followed it pretty much exactly as far as ingrediants,except pinot noir for the wine and beef consomme for the broth and no salt. And since it's not grilling weather here I used pressure cooker. On top of red skinned garlic mash and broccoli wow! Would make a great Valentines dinner! mmmmm......

I LOVED this recipe!  I grilled a rib eye to rare and then cut it in to bitesize pieces and just warmed it in the finished sauce.  I used 1.5 cups of chianti and a can and a half of beef stock.  I also replaced the portabellos with presliced crimini mushrooms and served it all over egg noodles. I also added three cloves of garlic.
I thought it was so yummy and easy.  It is a little salty but I like that so if you are sensitive to salt, I'd do the low sodium beef broth. I also reserved a little stock to whisk the flour in before adding it to the reduction to avoid lumps.  Worked great!  I will definately make again.

Tried this using 2 pounds of tri-tip steak I had in the freezer and cooked it all day in the crock pot with salt and pepper. Then used the juices as part of the broth and mixed the flour in a little water before adding it at the end. It was wonderful with buttered noodles and the roasted steak was falling-apart tender. Bonus: the house smelled wonderful all day.

Tried it once on my family, am making for company soon. So decadent! Used filet mignon (seasoned with a bit of olive oil and steak rub) and regular mushrooms, a nice cab, and cornstarch instead of flour. Otherwise followed the recipe.

Delicious taste!  I used Crimini mushrooms instead of portabellos and Merlot wine instead of Cabernet because that is what I had on hand.  My only recommendation would be to serve immediately because once I added my meat to the sauce it continued cooking and got a little tougher than we usually like it.  Good recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Hold the phone! My husband actually said "this is good" (i only know if he likes it by how many refills he gets) and my son, who doesn't like anything I make unless its pancakes or tacos, agreed with him and said "yeah, it is pretty good mom" HOLY COW. I made as is except I halved the recipe and threw it in a crock pot. Well, I used the same ingrediants that is. I sauteed the mushrooms & onion w/garlic in some butter, tossed the steak in flour before sauting in olive oil, than I threw everything in the crockpot, low, about 7 hours, and voila...the boys actually speak

Wow- I love this sauce! I had a really awful cut of meat, but the sauce was so good I licked my plate, a new low! lol I used green onions v shallots, white caps v portabellas, and cornstarch v flour. I held back some beef broth to whisk the flour in before adding to the sauce to prevent clumps. A must!!!!!

This recipe is great for someone looking for a restaurant style meal on an at home budget.  I like to cook and try out new recipes, but I don't consider myself a chef by any stretch of the imagination.  This recipe took me to a whole new level of respect in the kitchen!  I served it with french bread, sliced tomatoes and mozarella, and potatoes and it was just outstanding!  It takes a little while took cook because of the simmering, but it was relatively simple.  I will make it again and for guests!

I used NY strip steaks for this recipes and it was fabulous!  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing I changed was using baby bellas instead of the large portobellas.  The baby bellas have a sweeter flavor.  This recipe is definitely going into my permanent file.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was an easy recipe.  The only thing I would suggest is to use a semi-to dry red wine. I bought one to sweet, as I don't care for red wine, and I think the flavor would have been better had it been dryer.  I will also use this on Deer steaks.  Thanks!

Definitely worth the time!  A bit salty, but next time I will reduce the beef broth by 1/2.  Tasted like a restaurant specialty sauce.  I made it with filet mignon.

My god was this sauce good over the steaks! I added a splash of olive oil to keep the butter from burning and recommend you mince the garlic in a press instead of chopping as I think it blends into the sauce better.

I made this yesterday using sirloin steak. I didn't grill the steak since it was 20 degrees outside. Just browned in the pan and it was great.Didn't have shallots, but you don't need,'cause you're using garlic anyway.All you really need is some regular onion. We made homemade fettucine noodles with it. Yum!

Very good.  My husband made this & had to use cornstarch instead of flour because it didn't thicken.  He mentioned that the directions had omitted when to add the thyme.  He'll make this again.

Absolutely fantastic. My only regret is that I did't have anyone to impress with this delicious meal! I will definitely make it again, the recipe is perfect just the way it is, no modifications needed. Can't wait to have left-overs tomorrow.

Wonderful recipe. I tried this cutting up the sirloin into bite size pieces and served it over noodles and it was incredible! Could use to increase the amount of sauce, or be careful not to cook down too much. Served 5 with plenty to spare. Excellent flavor and easy to prepare.

I just made the sauce part of this to go with steaks for a New Years party...it was wonderful. I used merlot wine, 1 pkg sliced baby bellas and 1pkg sliced shitakke musrooms instead and it was really good. Just a tad salty, though, might use the lower sodium broth next time.

My husband & I really enjoyed.  I made with beef tenderloin.  Made as stated but next time I will just use sliced mushrooms as we thought this was a waste to use portobello mushrooms and then slice them.

The flavors never melded.  The sirloin was tough and never retained the seasoning of the spices and wine.  I added the thyme and garlic when I sauteed the shallot.  The sauce, once thickened, was delicious over egg noodles, but never blended with the meat, so it was kinda blah.  Perhaps cook the beef tips in the sauce next time?  I tried this with leftover sirloin from some kabobs that I had grilled, so perhaps that made a difference.  I'd almost be tempted to triple the mushrooms and skip the beef entirely, thicken with flour or cornstarch, and serve over noodles.  I added more garlic and thyme towards the end, as well, to punch up the seasoning.

Absolutely divine!  My husband, who doesn't care for mushrooms, really loved this recipe.  He took the leftovers to work and said it was just as good the next day.  I served it with the Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes from this site as well.

Very good Cabernet sauce.  Any type of mushrooms will work.  Be sure to slice the mushrooms thinly for better results.

DON'T stir in the flour!! it will clump up terribly.  Reserve some of the 2nd round of broth and whisk it in that, then add it in.  UGH!! i spent more time picking our flour clumps.

Made this following the recipe, except I used a Tri Tip cooked to Med Rare/Rare. I sliced it and added the Burgundy Sauce and it was outstanding! I cook the entire meal on my charcoal grill with a cast iron Lodge pan. Very fun recipe!

The only changes I made were that I cut it in half because it's just my husband and myself, and that when I went to my local grocery store they didn't have any French wines, no Burgandy, so I ended up buying Dark Horse Big Red Blend. It tasted fabulous, but I would love to make this again with actual Burgandy wine. I'm definitely keeping this recipe!!

For us, this was to die for! We put this over ribeye instead of tips,  forgot to add the thyme, and doubled the butter by mistake. But, oh my my! Will definitely use this again and again, double butter and all.

husband and I loved this! After reading the comments I added rosemary and more garlic. This is good with plain red wine which is all I had on hand. it had a very unique flavor and I found it difficult to pick a vegetable side dish,but would highly recommend pairing a baked potato with the meal.

I made it and we loved it.  I didn't use flour this time, maybe try it next time.  I am trying to cut carbs so I wanted to try it without and it was great like au jus. I added a just a bit more REAL no salt butter (a good fat for your body).   I also used no salt added Swanson beef broth which is so much healthier. I did add just a LITTLE  iodized sea salt  (which iodine is good for you and your body needs it). Sea salt is so much better than the salt food corporations put in their foods.  Make it, you won't be disappointed.!

This was so good!  I did make a few changes. I left out the flour and just let the meat and mushrooms soak into the juice on my plate. I added an extra clove of garlic and replaced the thyme with rosemary. Will make again!

Loved this recipe!!  I didn't use steak tips, but rather a strip steak, that I cubed after grilling.  I filleted the steak before grilling which enabled a high heat searing on the outside of the steak, and locked in the juices.  I also would recommend that you double the amount of mushrooms and shallots.  I used one bunch of shallots.  I also could not find Burgundy in the grocery story, so used Cabernet, and it was just as delicious.  I also sauted some of the extra mushrooms and shallots in a separate pan in a little butter, and added some green beans to serve as a side.  These were delicious as well.

I made the mistake of adding too much flour at one time and got clumps.  Next time I would liquefy the flour before adding to the sauce.  It did not compromise the great taste and after removing the clumps no one was the wiser.  Great flavor and appears.  Presented over noodles with a bottle of red wine.  My wife was thrilled!

This was wonderful. Three people ate it all in one sitting.  I cut tenderloin tips and cooked them with the sauce.  Serverd it over quinoa ate all the beef and have leftovers of quinoa with sauce.  Delicious. Thanks

So good.  I browned the meat in a little olive oil then put it in the oven on warm, reserving the juice.  Sauteed a 1/2 a yellow onion and a ton of garlic in olive oil in the same pan with fresh rosemary and added the mushrooms when then onion was translucent.  Pulled that out and deglazed with a cup of red wine and a cup of homemade chicken stock with a beef boullion cube crushed in it.  Let it cook down for a while and then added the reserved beef juice, a small pat of butter, the flour and the veggies, let it cook for a bit longer.  Finished it off by adding in the meat and that juice and letting it cook for just a few more minutes.  The flavor was amazing.  Served over quinoa with twice baked potatoes on the side.  Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this recipe, I mixed the flour in water before adding it to keep it from getting lumpy. I used a medium onion because I wanted more of an onion flavor. I will use 1/2 the Thyme but other than that it turned out really good. Thanx for sharing.

This sauce is fantastic!  We used it tonight with some plain-ol' grilled sirloins.  I really was apprehensive about using so much wine but the reduction with beef broth was not what I expected--very tasty, indeed.  I cut the recipe to 2 servings which was a bad idea since I was really wanting more to use on my baked potato and veggies.  My picky-eater wife loved it, she said that it reminded her of the sauce at a local steak restaurant...makes me look good and scores points for future cooking endeavors.  We will definitely be making this again!

Maybe I was expecting something else, but the end result was very unappealing.  The whole thing was dark brown almost black, and the flavor was bland.  Nothing special, and like another review said, too much work for the not-so-special dish. Won't make it again.

Great! You can cut this recipe in half and still have PLENTY!  I served some extra grilled portabellos (tossed with olive oil and salt), and it was wonderful! I had to add a little cornstarch to thicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an experience.  If I were to make this again I would choose a better cut of meat.  The portabella mushrooms were great, but the sauce was a little odd.  I didn't know to add the flour slowly, so maybe the sauce didn't turn out quite right.  I would've thought it would be slightly more fluid.  It tasted pretty good when it all went together, but I probably won't make it again without modifications to the sauce.
