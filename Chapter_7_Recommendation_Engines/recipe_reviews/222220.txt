Delicious!  One of my friends doesn't like cilantro so I left it out, but it still tastes great!

This is a pleasant recipe. Only changes I made were adding chopped onion instead of onion powder, and garlic salt in place of the salt. The cucumber adds a nice flavor. Thank, farmgirl.

I really love the cucumbers mixed in and gave this coleslaw a refreshing taste.  I had added finely chopped onions, no cilantro (hate it), and used dashes of celery salt because I forgot all about the celery at serving time.  I was too lazy to take out the cutting board and all. When I tasted it before serving, I felt it was missing something though; it tasted too basic. Nothing wrong with simplicity, maybe I'm just not used to this.  So I changed up the vinegar to apple cider...mmm better.

I made this for dinner for my family and served it with pork chops and fried potatoes. It was pretty good, though I had to alter it a little and added some diced carrots. I would defiantly eat it again!

So good! I used garlic powder instead of onion powder because I don't like onions! Very refreshing!!

This was refreshing and had a nice crunch.  Great way to use up extra cukes and celery and the cilantro added an interesting twist.  Only substitution I made was white wine vinegar for the white vinegar.  Great compliment to a sandwich to add some zip!

I took other reviewers' comments and used chopped onion instead of the powder, didn't have cilantro, and I used malt vinegar instead of the white. very good!! like a mix between my one grandmother's vinegary sour slaw and my other grandmother's mayo vegetable slaw. Good times!

This is a fantastic change from regular coleslaw.  I did not use as much cilantro and no parsley.  I'm sure it's good with those items, I just didn't have enough/any.

Made the recipe exactly like it's written. Too heavy on the mayo for my taste.

This was a great slaw to use as a base. I enjoy spicier, so I added fresh jalape√±os, garlic powder, green onions and cayenne pepper. Today I'm going to also add fresh dill.

Oooh, this was good!  I had no cilantro, so I didn't use it.  The parsley flavor was PERFECT, though!   I'm so glad to find a low carb coleslaw recipe that tastes good!

I mega changed this so it's hard to rate it.  I used apple cider vinegar because it lends a sweetness that I don't have to add with sugar or syrup.  I used a ton of other veggies and 2 table spoons of carnemelk or sour milk.  It did turn out totally awesome.  Fresh onion and garlic, spitz kool, red, sweet pepper, carrot, cilantro, parsley...took forever, but was just super.

this came out very tasty with a few modifications based on personal preference and what i had on hand.. i used two persian cucumbers for the 1/2 cucumber and left out the cilantro simply bc i didn't have any.. i reduced the mayo to 3 T and upped the vinegar (used malt like others suggested) to 2 T as i like my coleslaws more vinegar-y and less mayo-y.. ty for giving me something new to try.. will make again! ~~UPDATE: the dressing is also great for tuna salad!
