I added a good amount homemade roasted garlic in this mashed potato recipe. I used warm EVAPORATED milk and a little more than what was asked for as I wanted a little more loose mashed potatoes. This made enough for two meals; once with meat loaf last night and with stew tonight. We loved these mashed potatoes!

This was really good.  However, I did not add the milk or sour cream as it would have made the potatoes way too watery.  The were the perfect texture with just the butter and cream cheese.  Thanks for posting the recipe

So simple, yet oh so good! These mashed potatoes are creamy, rich and delicious - comfort food at it's best! And, while you can lighten them up switching out low fat ingredients for full fat - I chose to stick with the full fat version.  Just as the submitter states - "These potatoes are a perfect compliment to ANY meal".

I have been making a different mashed potato recipe that produces more heavy, dense potatoes. I was looking for something lighter and creamier. This fit the bill! These potatoes were fantastic. Next time I will add garlic and a bit more salt during the cooking process, but that's only because I have a son who prefers a more salty garlicky taste. To 3/4 of us, these were fantastic. I will definitely keep these in the rotation.

I absolutely love these potatoes.  I was never a potato person, but after I tried these, you can't get me to eat
any other way. The only thing I would add is a little more salt and pepper.  Bon Apetit!

Instead of cream cheese,  I used Boursin Cheese (herb & garlic). It was delicious! It was served with roasted pork belly! I will make it again.

I made this for my heavenly spirit farther's, the late Rev Johnson, birthday party who turned 100 year's old on St Patrick's day. I chose this recipe because my father loved his mashed potatoes to be prepared with sour cream. I invited my siblings and their children for this celebration; this recipe was perfectly creamy, buttery, and had such an amazing flavor. My sisters  begged me for the recipe which I refused to share!

Hubs was surprised that he liked these. While our children were young, we made rustic mashed potatoes all of the time, and he wondered if he could transition to anything that appeared to be fluff to him. But..... Recently, I started missing my mother's whipped potatoes. She never made them with so much extra richness as this recipe uses, but I added in your add instead since my dh was nervous about whipped potatoes. I might not always use all the rich goodies, but this recipe was nicely rich and creamy, so I'm sure we'll use them sometimes, particularly for special occasions. Thanks so much!

This might be THE BEST recipe for whipped potatoes EVER!  I used Klondike Goldust potatoes.  What fluffy goodness!
