OMG!! Loved this! I'm the original "a recipe is just a guideline cook". The only thing I did was use canned sweet potato pieces, discarding the light syrup. It's what I had on hand. Anyway, I downsized the measurements for the sauce ingredients but didn't change them. This was SO good with a pork shoulder roast (the Cuban-Style Roast Pork recipe on this site - also a WINNER!) and some sautéed asparagus. Both recipes went into my favorites file.

Oh my, wow! Loved the flavors!!! I didn't find this recipe until after I had baked my sweet potatoes ... So I made the glaze and spooned it over the cut pieces and then baked them for a while to help the flavors bake into the potatoes. Tasted like my Nana's with a flair!

Love this recipe. Only thing I would change is the lemon juice. The next time I’ll use less and add a little at a time. My nieces also loved it. Will definitely make again.

Served his at “FriendsGiving” and everyone liked them. But I agree with another reviewer that it was too much lemon juice,. I’ll try it again using half the amount.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was amazing!  I'm giving 4 stars because when I make it again I will probably reduce the amount of lemon juice it was a little more tart than I would have liked.  That said this has a really fresh taste which is nice because sweet potatoes can often be too rich.  ?

I absolutely loved these! My Mamaw used to put Lemon in her sweet potatoes, and the flavor reminded me of hers. I love that these are sweet without being TOO sweet. Am going to make these every year, from now on.

This sweet potatoes side dish was delicious but too sweet. I will cut the sugar in half next time. Also, the time the potatoes will take to cook will vary. I had huge potatoes and their flesh was tougher. I needed to simmer them a lot longer .

Used Meyer lemons instead of regular lemons for less tartness and a bit of the orange flavor. Made this for Thanksgiving, everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

Made as published since Chef John is one of favorite contributors on allrecipes. I discovered him years ago and have never been disappointed with anything he has published. He hit the mark again with this one - it is so freaking addictive! Even my husband liked it and he does not like sweet potatoes or traditional candied yams. I have to admit, I was apprehensive about using cinnamon and cayenne together, but it works so well. Due to my own fear,  I did a small pinch of cayenne - I would definitely add a larger pinch next time. I plan to make this again this week, even after eating it 3 days in a row. Thank you Chef John for another wonderful dish!

I made this as part of our Thanksgiving meal this year, following the recipe as written. I didn't expect it to be a star dish, because my family isn't big on sweet potato casserole, but they all loved it! In fact, my son said it was his favorite dish of the night, and most agreed and asked me to save the recipe for next year!

I took others advice and only used 1/4 cup lemon juice.  I still thought that it had a lemony taste.  Next time I will probably use 1/8 cup.  I got a lot of compliments though.

I made this for Thanksgiving at my Mom's this year, 36 people expected. It was loved by all. One of my sisters said she had never had it before where the sweet potatoes weren't creamed smooth-everyone enjoyed it, many returning for a second serving!

Made it with both lemon juice and orange juice. The batch with OJ was good, but the lemon juice batch was a game changer. Either way you make it, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

I also add Old Smokey Tennessee Moonshine from Gatlinburg to my candied yams. I started with one-fourth a cup until there was a balance. Based on pounds of yams you are preparing. My fiance'  just loves the taste!

The dish is good. If I made this again I would not add as much lemon as it Ask for in recipe.  It was too strong of a lemon taste, and I love lemon.  Otherwise a good recipe.

I just made these for Thanksgiving, sorry my husband insisted on sweet potatoes not yams. Even so, I followed the instructions and the rest of the ingredients and they were amazing! Sweet but not overly sweet with a really nice lemon brightness that just truly complimented the dish.

Used Allspice instead of Ginger and Cinnamon inasmuch as I couldn’t find my Ginger and maple flavored waffle syrup because I had no pure maple.  I also used just the juice from one lemon.  Next time I will cook the glaze down more so it is thicker before adding the potatoes - it was delicious.  Can’t wait to try with suggested ingredients.

The lemon juice needs to be cut in half. Too strong. I'd given it 5??if it was more sweet than tart. I also added a full bag of small marshmallows on the top. That probably helped the tartness on mine. Good though will keep using this recipe with those tweaks.

I made it as directed except I left of the nuts that was used for presentation (I don't like nuts)

It was all gone & everyone said they really liked.

Personally, it was a little too sweet for me.  I think I will try it again minus the maple syrup.
