This salad was very refreshing.  I made a few changes though.  I increased the sugar from 2 tsp to 3 Tbs. because it was very sour.  I also substituted 6 oz. plain yogurt for the mayo, and I used about 2 Tbs of dill from a tube made by Gourmet Gardens (it has a much fresher taste than dried dill, but not as strong, so more is needed).  I sliced the cucumbers using the side of my cheese grater and quickly sliced the cucumbers and onion very thinly.  I omitted the celery.  I'd definitely make this again, especially for a summer bbq.

This recipe is similar to something we used to make at my uncle's deli, with the addition of sliced fresh tomatoes. When I attempted to make the dressing for this salad, the proportions didn't work to my liking, so I ended up discarding half the dressing and adding more mayonnaise to cut the strong vinegar taste and reduce the soupy consistency (and a tad more sugar!)... If you prefer the original proportions, I might also recommend trying a slightly more mild rice wine vinegar.

I ended up halving the vinegar (because I didn't have enough) and pretty much doubling the mayo (to make it creamier)and used celery seed instead of celery.  Came out really good!  Never would have thougt that one up on my own.  Even my picky husband liked it.  Put it right into my recipe book!

This was a very briny salad, almost like eating pickle juice. The second time I made it, I decreased the vinegar substantially and increased the sugar and mayo -- much better. We deleted the celery. This is similar to my grandmother's old German recipe, and is also good with sliced fresh tomatoes.

As the other reviewer stated, my mom also makes this with sour cream and sugar to taste.  (I like it sweet). It is really delicious.

I'm not crazy about cucumbers either, but I did like this.  In order to get the mayonnaise thoroughly mixed, I will use a blender next time.

I'll admit, I hate cucumber salad. I made this for a company picnic and followed some suggestions and used 3 tbs of sugar and 1/3 cup mayo. Let it sit in a fridge for a few hours before our picnic and was worried when I saw how much liquid had formed.

The salad was a hit among all who tried it and I even liked it. I'm a convert. Looking forward to making this again.

I omitted the celery, and only used three cucumbers. I took it to a SBDiet cookout and it was a HIT.  It's good the second day, but the cucumbers begin to wilt.  Will definitely serve again.

This was a good way to use up the extra cucumbers in my garden and I liked the fresh taste of the cukes with the dill. I did decrease the vinegar to about 1/4 cup but that's because I prefer a little creamier and less tart version.  Good recipe!

I wasn't sure how to rate this, six girls had this for lunch and two really liked it while four did not care for.  I do believe it had to do with the mayo.

This was okay. My mother used to make a similar recipe using sour cream instead of mayo. I think I'll try subbing that next time.

Sharp taste with the vinegar and dill and also very sweet because of the sugar.  It was an ok recipe, but not one I'd make again.

This is delicious!  Everyone loved it and I especially loved that it was not as sweet as the usual cucumber salad.  Fabulous.  Will make again for sure.

The salad was all-right although could have been a bit sweeter imo.   My other complaint is that after mixing my vinegar and and mayo the dressing turned an ugly color and it started creeping into my cucumbers turning them brownish.  After marinading a bit they didn't look very apetizing so I didn't bother bringing them to my Moms.  I may try useing a clear vinegar if I make it again; imo thicker slices would hold up better since the thin ones got pretty limp!.. The picture shows right after I made it and before it sat in the fridge!

Prepared without the celery, and liked the flavors of this cucumber salad. I  do prefer my Mom's recipe using half and half cream with cider vinegar, but this recipe is definitely a close second.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Wanted to make a cucumber salad for a while. I love acidity and cucumbers.. I like to eat them with vinegar and salt by themselves, so needless to say this recipe was for me!

Delicious. I served this with a very spicy pork dish, so it was a refreshing counterpoint. I sliced the cukes and red onion very thinly with a mandolin. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was....well....weird. Some liked it, some didn't. I don't know if it was the mayo or the sugar that turned me off.

What a fabulous taste! Split the vineager with Apple Cider vineager and put in a little less, added a little extra mayo and sugar and extra fresh dill.  I definitely like it with celery- gives it that extra crunchiness and flavor.  This one is going in my 'favs'!

Very tastey!  I halved the R.W. Vinegar amount, did 2 TBS sugar, doubled the mayo (made it much creamier!), and omitted the celery.  It really depends on if you prefer a more vinegar taste or sweeter taste as the how much/little of the sugar and vinegar to add.  I prefer sweeter!

It tasted good but it didn't look very appetizing.
