I made it with thinly sliced red onions and no feta cheese and it was delicious. Will do it with feta next for a change

So simple yet so good!  My husband even raved about it.  I used red onion instead of shallot and grape tomatoes as it's what I had on hand.  Dressing is delicious... light and refreshing.  I am going to make this with asparagus next.

I cut the recipe down to one serving because I was using up leftover green beans and about 1/2 of a large tomato, so this was perfect. It made a good amount for two side servings, with a little left over.  I didn't have white vinegar so just used regular balsamic, also substituted red onion for the shallot,  and we had no feta but that would have been wonderful. Thank you!

Perfect summer salad! Left out the shallots cause I did not have any at hand but will add them next time. I grated the garlic instead of mincing it - I prefer it grated in dressings

Great summer side dish.  I did add a little basil from my garden at the last minute.  Also, next time I might try adding some candied pecans. But an awesome recipe that everyone enjoyed. Thanks.
