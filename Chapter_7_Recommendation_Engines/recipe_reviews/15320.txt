I made this cookie for a bridal shower ...it was a hit ! the cookie is soft and moist with a very tasty filling...the dough spreads during baking, so be sure to use a scant amount for both top and bottom cookies...enjoy !

The recipe is a little time consuming and messy to work with, but the results were well worth the effort.  My hubby gives them an A+

My mom made these every year.  I like this version better than hers.  She would stuff the date with a walnut and dip in the dough and bake.  I like the filling idea better.  These are a wonderful variation of comfort cookies from my childhood.  They will have a place in my Christmas cookie baskets this year.  Thank you for sharing!

I was so glad to be able to find this recipe.  I have had this cookie every year since I was a small child.  My grandmother has made them every year.  Since she is 91 this year, she won't be making cookies.  I had the recipe in an old cookbook, but we had house fire last month and I haven't been able to lay my hands on the recipe.  This will make my family so happy to be able to have these cookies this year despite the turmoil that the fire has caused in our lives.  They are time consuming, but so worth the effort.

My mother made these for as long as I can remember. They have always been a favorite of my son. Mama is gone now so I have continued making them for him every Christmas. They are a little labor intensive but well worth the effort. Flavor is better after a day or two. Freeze great. I do use a 1 Tbsp. scoop for the cookie dough and a tsp. of filling with a tsp. of dough on top. Also, only bake for 8 minutes but my oven cooks hot. Bake until pale golden on top.

A very enjoyable filled cookie. I will definately make theese again. They are a bit time consuming but it's worth it. Plenty of filling and great taste. I like to sub about 1/2 cup of figs for dates.

I used fig and almonds substituted for the date and walnuts and upon my first taste I realized that they will quickly become my favorite cookie.  It literally brought tears to my husbands eyes reminding him of the cookies his grandma made for him every year at Christmas when she was still with us. We definitely felt her with us in spirit tonight.
Light and fluffy cookie, beautiful shiny filling had the perfect amount of sweetness when married with the baked cookie.
These will become a Christmas tradition from this year on.

This is a really great cookie recipe for the holidays or anytime of the year really.  These turned out wonderful.  So wonderful in fact, that they didn't last long!

Yummo! It was kinda hard to make them smaller, and I had a lot of left over filling.  So worth the hassle of making!

Great cookie. Made 3 dozens with this recipe. Added a little more cinnamon and used regular sour cream since I didn't have fat free.

Very good, just like my memory of the ones I made years ago. I lowered the oven temprature to 375. I had received fresh Arizona dates, can make more after Christmas.
