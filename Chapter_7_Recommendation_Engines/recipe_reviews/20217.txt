As you know there is 2 kind of pandan leaves , the one only has fragrance called just "pandan leaves"  and the other one is called "SUJI Pandan leaves" this one only used for natural food coloring.
What I made is mix this 2 kind of pandan leaves makes the syrup more attractive.
Crush the pandan leaves and mince 2 suji pandan and cook with water and sugar for 15 minutes, you wont believe the result.
