nice simple marinade, gave great flavor to my halibut. We marinaded the fish for an hour & it seemed perfect. I'll definately use this again for all sorts of white fish.

This is a very good, light marinade.  I used it for broiled grouper.

Easy marinade. Halibut was very tastey. Used fresh grapefruit juice and it was just the right tang for the fish.

I didn't have any grapefruits (or juice) so I had to sub lime juice instead, also subbed dill for the marjoram as I don't care for that flavor. Very easy. I used an air cooker, and my only warning would be to watch cod very closely, it can go from 'perfectly' cooked to overcooked in a matter of a minute. Also pay attention to the marinading time, as the recipe submitter mentioned, too long can change the texture, simply because the citrus actually 'cooks' the fish after an extended time. Think ceviche.
