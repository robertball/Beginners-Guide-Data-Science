I never like to leave a poor review but I found this rather bland. I assumed that 1 tbs was a typo, holly hot, so I just added a very healthy tsp. Should I make this again I would roast a garlic bulb since I already have the squash roasting and squeeze a little into the oil and than onto the squash.

Pretty quick, tasty dish. I love spicy food, but found 1 tbsp of red pepper flakes way too spicy! Would use half the red pepper flakes next time. Took another's recommendation to sprinkle some shredded Parmesan on top. That was a nice touch and helped cut the heat.

For years, l have been intimidated by spaghetti squash. After a few recipes, the fear has gone! This simple recipe is a good starter for those that have not prepared spaghetti squash.

Ooo 1 tsp of red chili flakes was too much, really spicy.  I will cut the amount in 1/2 next time, it also needs garlic, a clove or two.

I’m starting an AIP diet (AutoImmune Protocol) because of inflammation I am having, so I can’t have the red pepper, or black pepper.  I used cilantro and garlic salt to season it.  I put a serving in a dish and added avocado pieces.  It was yummy.  Next time I’ll use Avocado Oil instead of EVOO, I think, and see how that is!

I added garlic salt, Italian spices, fresh ground black pepper, and Himalayan pink salt. I used the olive oil, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and baked it as directed. When I served it we added store bought marinara and Parmesan cheese. Fresh green beans and crusty bread with a good Cabernet made it a delicious and less filling dinner.

This turned out nice. I didn't use as much red pepper flakes don't care for that hot. Increased cooking time to 35 minutes. I added dried oregano and dried basil. Didn't measure out just sprinkled on, also added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese.

I followed the recipe except I just sprinkled pepper flakes on, probably 1/2 tsp. it was good, not exciting but good side dish and healthy. I'll make it again.

Loved the squash. 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes made this dish overwhelmingly hot for me.

use 1/2 tablespoon of crushed red pepper (a little too spicy with 1 tbsp) and add some grated Parmesan other than that very good!

A very tasty and simple way to prepare spaghetti squash.  I normally use butter on my squash, but I really liked using olive oil instead. Makes a lovely side dish, or topped with a yummy sauce.
