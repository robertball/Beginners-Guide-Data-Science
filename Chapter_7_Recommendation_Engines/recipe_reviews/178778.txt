HELPFUL TIP AND REASON I COULDN'T GIVE THEM 5 STARS:  HEAT THE HOTDOG UP IN THE MICROWAVE FIRST before making these!!  I mean, if eating uncooked hotdogs is your thing then it won't matter, but I'm definitely a cook first kind of person as is the rest of my family.  :) I also cut the dogs in either HALF or thirds.  If I have those link little appetizer sausages, I use those since they taste THE BEST!  Cheese is definitely optional and if I do use it.. shredded is what I have on hand, and I pinch the ends so it doesn't come out.  Most crescent tubes say cook at 350 if using a dark pan (cookie sheet), but I tend to cook mine at 325 (my oven cooks fast and from trial and error... I've realized this works). ...so it thoroughly cooks because my oven tends to cook crescents fast and I like it to be all golden ...not "brown" on the bottom and uncooked on top.  I cook it 3/4 of the way then flip if they're golden on the bottom ...just until the other side is golden.  Who wants burnt bottoms?! If they feel gooey.. you basically just cook for 2 more min until it's done (for those wondering how long)  :) PERFECTION!

My niece just loves these! They're always a favorite for kids  - even kids off all ages as my husband has been known to sneak a few! I sometimes use the cheese filled hot dogs and always give plenty of ketchup and mustard for dipping.

I make these when I need a quick dinner and I'm low on time. I like to use CheddarWurst dogs, deli cheddar cheese instead of American cheese and I serve this with a broccoli salad. Always quick to disappear and excellent for hungry boys/husbands.

These bring  out the  kid in me!!! I love them! I do use white american cheese as that is my familiy's preference. I also HEAT my dogs up in the microwave as to help cook the inside of the crescent roll. They tend to come out doughy sometimes and the outside is already done....by heating them up it solves the 'gooey' problem. Carefullly add cheese AFTER heating your dog!!! Just a little tip for everyone....it works!! It's like heating pie filling before adding to an unbaked crust....it helps to cook the crust...

These are the best. I've been eating these since I was a kid. I like using provolone though or anything other than processed cheese. They taste even better with a little sprinkle of garlic and chili powder on each and serve with baked beans!!

I hate to admit we love these!!  I have been making a version of these for 40 years. I usually use pepper jack cheese-don't care for American. Eating them cold the next day (if you have any left) is my son's favorite snack.

I served these to my 4th grade football team at our end of the season party and they absolutely loved them! I made some with beef sausages, some with cheese sausages and some with regular sausages. It didn't matter; they snarfed them down! Caution don't stand between the Crescent Dogs and hungry kids!!

I have made these with Gourmet Chicken Mozzarella and Roasted Garlic Sausages. I slit them and put a slice of mozzarella or a slice of provolone cheese. They are delicious.

These were freakin' awesome! Believe it or not I have never had anything like this before. The only thing I did differently was to brush some melted butter on the dough before and after baking. Delcious! My husband ate three!! We just dipped them in mustard with some chips on the side. We didn't even miss the red onion we usually have on our hot dogs. Can't wait to have these again. They were fun to make too.

This is a perfect, quick, family friendly meal!  I don't like the cheese, others in my family do.  Either way they are so good!  And so fast to make!  Also- this is convenient.  The ingredients keep well. :)

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I for dinner. I made his with cheese, and mine without. First off, I was using hot dogs from the freezer (as I hadn't read the recipe before hand) so the dogs needed to be defrosted before cutting the slits for the cheese. I also found it very difficult to insert the cheese into the dogs. Because of this I ended up using far less cheese than called for. I had more crescent dough than I needed for the hot dogs, so I made a few rolls on the same pan. My boyfriend enjoyed his hot dogs with the cheese, and I found mine to be mediocre (but by no means was I expecting some new gourmet revelation). I'm not sure if it was the brand of hot dog, the method of cooking, or the dough wrapped around them, but our dogs were a little too juicy for our taste. However, for a quick and easy dinner this was a decent choice. I will probably make this again in the future, but would use defrosted hot dogs and probably cut a few more slits to allow some of the liquid to burn off easier. We served these with crinkle cut fries and homemade honey mustard sauce.

All in all, this was good enough to give it one more shot, and I'm sure a great choice for busy mom's or a dinner-on-the-go.

I've been eating these for...well, a lot of years (over 40). My mom used the make them for us to eat before we went out trick-or-treating so we'd have full tummies before we started sneaking our candy. She called them Halloweenies. :)  We always used American cheese growing up, but trying to avoid as much processed food when I started making them for my kids, so I used cheddar. They're good either way, and they like to dip them in ketchup and mustard.

Easy and good tasting.  They lasted about 10 minutes.  No bun worked out great - the crescent roll is much lighter than bread.

I have been making these forever! So easy and yummy, they are great. After I put the cheese into the hot dogs I wrap a piece of  bacon around the dogs and then wrap in the dough. Use thin bacon though because the thick slices won't cook completely.

I agree that cutting the dog and not cooking it first left it cold.  We tried a cheese smoked sausage link, such as Hillshire Farm Cheddarwurst, since it already had the cheese inside.  Kids loved it!!

Made these for grand kids one evening, and they liked them even before they tasted them.  Our granddaughter said, "Those are my favorite."  And I'm pretty sure she'd never had them before.  They are fast and fun to make.  You have to be sure to bake them long enough for the dough to cook next to the hot dogs--especially if the hot dogs are cold to start with.  I didn't bake them quite long enough, and they were borderline doughy.  So bake them until they are good and golden brown.  Will make again especially for the kids.

So delicious! A cafeteria favorite of mine!  I agree with the reviewers who say to microwave the dogs first.  I cooked the whole 8 dog pack for 1 minute in the microwave first before I rolled them up and baked 'em in the oven.

This was an AWESOME recipe! Loved it...made me feel like a kid again! :)  They are good cold left over too! I did nuke the hot dogs for about 1 1/2 mns and used cheddar cheese.  Little hard to roll but my own fault. :)  Did flip half way through.  So good!  Will definitely do again!

My daughter shocked me by stating, "I've never had these before!"  I grew up on "pigs in a blanket" but I guess I've never made them for her!  She loved them.  And they couldn't be easier to make.  I doubt we'll ever have "regular" hot dogs ever again.

Easy and added a different twist to hot dogs. We used the garlic crescents. Didn't care for the American cheese...going to make again and try something else and maybe a little less. Many ways you could add to or change this up!

10/22/14-This week I made these and substituted Johnsonville sausage and provalone cheese and served them with pizza sauce for dipping. With or without the sauce, these were delicious and I will make them this way again.

These are just plain Great for whenever. Very easy to make. I like to grill (they are really good grilled) a couple pack of hot dogs and make them all and freeze them. Kids love them. I also cut the hot dogs in half as it makes more and works out better with the cheese as I just roll the cheese with the hot dog.

We added a spoonful of crumbled bacon and 1/3 of a cheese slice onto the dough, then wrapped around the hot dog.  We cooked at 350 for about 16 minutes. Covering with a spoonful or two of chili to these after removing from oven is great, also!

I have tried to make these twice now and both times the tops come out nice and brown, but the dough that is touching the hot dog is NOT COOKED at all :( it is really doughy. My kids take the hot dog out of the crescent roll and eat it plain. Not sure what I am doing wrong as these are nice and easy to do.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I used chicken hot dogs to make them somewhat healthier.  :)  My husband had two, my 5-year-old son had two, and my 3-year-old wanted two, but he was too full.  I cut up some cantaloupe and made green beans with ground beef to add more nutrients to the meal.  Of course, had to make some white rice, too!  It was an American/Chinese dinner tonight.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not so healthy.

These were golden brown on top and dough on bottom.  Not even the kids wanted seconds. Maybe rolling out the dough or turning over mid-bake would help.

I have been making these for years, and we love them! They are great for an easy weeknight meal, or a day that you don't feel like cooking. I usually add the cheese, but sometimes I'll leave it out and serve a cheese sauce on the side~YUM! :)

These are a great idea to make ahead of time to take to the beach.  You don't have to heat them up.  Easy to eat, with minimal sand.  Adding the cheese was a great idea.

I actually cheated and used "Little Smokies" because I'm not a big fan of hot dogs. I had no idea it was this easy to make "pigs in a blanket." Very tasty and super easy...and my boyfriend loved them, which is always a plus.

Nice, easy dinner for families with kids.  I wish the cheese wouldn't melt off as much, so I always try to stretch the crescent roll to cover as much of the hot dog and cheese as possible.  Also, when I followed this recipe, the dough came out a bit underbaked on the bottom, so next time I will bake a little longer.

Im glad I found something he actually likes! =D

My wife makes these and theyre very good!  You can add a little garlic powder to add some flavor.  They melt in your mouth and are very easy to make.  They tend to be a bit greasy but still very good!

One of our busy week faves! Super easy and the kids love them! I usually slice and insert a few chunks of cheddar into the crescent/dog roll, but that's only because we prefer cheddar. Can't go wrong with this one!

Didn't care for the processed cheese otherwise they were very good.  I used reduced fat hot dogs & reduced fat crescent dough and they turned out well.

I make this quite often for a change of pace when having hot dogs. We call them pigs in a blanket, but they are very tastey. Last time I made them, they were gone in a heartbeat. Nice and easy too.

We do love these, but they are always more trouble than I think they will be.  I don't know why I have such a hard time stretching the crescent rolls over the dogs to get decent coverage.  It seems to be a personal problem of mine since no one else has mentioned it.  These are great with baked beans and baked kale chips so I can feel like I'm serving something nutritious.

I can't tell you the number of times I've brought these to a party, and they're the first food to go while fancier appetizers are barely touched. One time that happened because the person who brought the fancy appetizer spent half the party in the kitchen, "putting on the finishing touches."

These are very tasty and go great with french fries or tator tots. Instead of stuffing the hotdogs I bought cheese dogs to save a little time. Just poke a few holes in each dog with a fork and wrap with crescent dough.

I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by these.  As they were baking, I read through the reviews and realized I'm apparently one of the few people on the planet who didn't eat these in my childhood.  I'm not even a fan of hot dogs (unless they're cooked over an open fire, served on cheap grocery store buns, with yellow mustard and onions and beer...), but really enjoyed this.  I wouldn't go as far to say I'd ever purposefully make them again (hence the 4 rather than 5 stars), but I dug 'em.  I added some raw onion, forgot to slice the dog and simply rolled 1/2 slice of Swiss in w/dog. I baked at 350 for 15 minutes w/no issues.

The rolls came out slightly overcooked on the outside and rawish on the inside, so next time I will try to cook at a lower heat as suggested by other reviewers. Still, these were a hit and quite delicious. Kinda messy with the cheese though, but who cares if they taste good!

I made these for lunch and they were a big hit. You can use whatever type of hot dog or brat you want and change around the cheese for a different taste. Classic recipe.

These were tasty.  I followed the recipe and used hot dogs, but we love the little cocktail sausages wrapped up in crescent rolls.  The cheese was a nice addition, but I'm not sure I will do this again.  It seemed like quite a lot of trouble to stuff the dogs with cheese.  I will go back to my tried and true!

These were so simple! And we liked them just as is that no condiments were required. The only thing I changed was the cheese. I think it would be just fine with the American slices but, just a personal preference, I used shredded cheddar cheese instead. It was a little more work but, still came out delicious!

These are a guilty pleasure of mine. I use turkey dogs, reduced fat American cheese, and reduced fat crescent rolls. I have never heated the hot dogs first, and I've never had a problem with the rolls being too doughy.

I noticed that the hot dogs were a little too big for the crescent rolls, so i cut of about  1 1/2 Inches  and they fit perfect!

Other than that they were GREAT!

Awesome job!

Used the mini beef hotdogs which fit perfectly inside the croissants. Definitely microwave the hotdogs before baking. They flew off the table as an appetizer.

Finally, I got the middle cooked through and not doughy.  I heated the dogs on a sheet pan in the oven while it preheated.  We don't like them with cheese.  Heating the dogs prevented   the  roll from being undercooked.  D. Licious.

I just subsituted in Johnsonville breakfast links to change this up a little and served on a Sunday morning.  You can get 2 links in each roll.

First of all, it was yummy. Second, I have trouble with the crescent rolls to form triangles and roll them up into crescents. Second, my cheese melted on the cookie sheet, when they faced the other way. Overall, it was delicious and would get to try it again with better crescents. Mine became more like biscuit dogs. I'll try the ham and cheese roll ups tomorrow.

I grew up with these, but my boyfriend had never heard of them! I couldn't believe it! Needless to say, they are now a staple in our house. Quick, easy, super convenient, and pretty much fool-proof. Great with or without the cheese. I like to cut the hot dogs in half before rolling so they fit the dough triangles easier and it only uses four hot dogs. Try stuffing the slit hot dog with partially cooked bacon and shredded cheddar cheese! :)

Made these in Home-ec class 45 years ago. I made these for my boys  for years and now for my grandchildren -my 88 year old Mother loves them. Great cold or nuked the next day for a fast breakfast or lunch. A mixture of ketchup and mustard is good for dipping.

Something quick for supper.  I agree with other suggestions to microwave the hot dog for a short time, otherwise you will have a cold hot dog.

These were a blast from the past and brought me right back to my childhood!  After reading some of the reviews about the temperature of the hot dogs, I microwaved them for about 30 seconds just to knock the chill off before rolling.   I made the rest according to the directions and the temperature was perfect and the crescent rolls perfectly cooked.   The only problem I had was - how the heck do you roll these things up - lol?   Mine never seemed to cover the hot dog completely, so, I ended up stretching and maneuvering so the hot dog was covered and the dough wasn't too thick in some areas.

I made as directed. Super easy and quick. The only trouble I had was the crescent rolls were still a little doughy after 15 min.. So I had to cook an extra 10 min.. I think next time I will take another reviewers advice and pre cook the hot dogs in the microwave before I roll them in the dough and bake in the oven..

I surprised my kids with these, wrapped to look like mummies, and they enjoyed them. They don't normally eat hot dog rolls - too much bread for little ones. But dipping their mummies into "blood" (ketchup) made for a delightful, frightful dinner.

VEGETARIANS can enjoy these too, if you don't mind the white flour etc. in the crescent rolls. Pillsbury has taken the transfats out of a lot of their stuff--maybe even these.
I've made them for kids' parties with "Big Franks" or some other veggie dog--everyone loves them and they soon disappear. Non-veggie kids don't even notice the dogs are not meat.

I was very surprised when I seen this recipe. Haven't these been around forever? I didn't even know there was an actual recipe neccessary for them. I thought it was always on the pillsbury can? I used to do daycare years ago and the kids used to request that I make this sometime. I don't care for them, but they used to love them. I made them on Halloween for them to with mustard eyes. I believe the recipe is on here for that to. I think they are called mummies or something like that. I don't know what the appeal is, but kids think they are pretty neat.

I, too, microwave the hot dog prior to baking. But, then give the concept a little twist. Our family likes it when a teaspoon of brown sugar is added to the crecsent roll before laying a triangle of american cheese on it and then rolling the hot dog up in the "blanket". Bake until golden and the brown sugar is oozing out of the crescent roll. Dip it in ketchup and they seem to disappear! Yum!

These are great but definitely use cheddar cheese instead of American.
It stuffs into the hotdog so much easier and tastes better too

These were okay and very easy to make. I heated dogs in pan on stove first. And I used pepper jack deli cheese cut in half and just wrapped around dog instead of putting I nside cut.  I had a hard time knowing when crescent rolls were cooked thru but after about 12 minutes they were done. Served with mustard and ketchup.

Yum! I knew the basics of piggies in the blanket but needed cooking time information.  Crescent rolls are delicious in any cooking dish !! Tasty and the Fam loved them!

To really make this over the top, either grill the hot dogs before wrapping or heat in microwave.  This prevents the uncooked dough usually under the dog!  Also, take about one tablespoon of Kraft Original BBQ sauce and spoon along top of hot dog, spreading over the hot dog.  Kids will go wild!
PS. Also, adults really like adding. Cooked sweet onion strips added to this dog.  In skillet with a touch of oil, cook up either rings or diced sweet onion until soft and carmelized. To speed this up be sure oil is pretty warm to start and as it gets hot add a tiny bit of hot water, put lid on skillet to soften onions to translucent, then remove lid and get them nice and golden.  Make croissant squares from 2 triangles, place hot dog corner to corner, 1/2 slice of cheese on each side or in split down the middle.  Smear with Kraft BBQ Sauce and add grilled onions to top for adults, roll all up in croissant dough square. Cook as instructed.

We call these “Hogs in a Comforter “ cause they are too big to be “Pigs in a blanket”. We don’t eat hot dogs very often, but this is the way to go when we do :)

My second time making this appetizer for parties.  
I found out it depends on what kind of sausage you use.
Some are too salty.. I would find out the salt contents in them.
I did not have the right kind  roll ready so tried with crescent roll that I had.  It turned out fine.  A little difficult to work with, though.  I will stick with the Pepperidge Farm pie crust next time.

I had to bake mine about 20 mins to get most of the dough cooked. Tried some with cheese and some without. I am more of a without kinda guy. Nice twist on a normal dog and gives me another reason to have crescents on hand at all times. Overall decent but nothing spectacular.

We liked it. The only thing I would change is maybe cook a minute longer. The crescent was a little doughy. It will be  definitely made again.

I have done these for years. I always used half of the cheese folded over because my kids love cheese. I also hit the pan with a butter flavored non-stick spray to prevent burning. I have also never had a problem with the hot dog being raw. It has always been cooked through.

I spread spicy mustard on crescent rolls before rolling hot dog up.  Also, I just roll up whole slice of cheese with the hot dog.  I  teach each of my grandchildren to cook and this is one of the first recipes they learn and one of their favorites to eat!

Can't believe I had never tried these before, but they are so neat for a little snack or appetizer. I didn't put cheese in mine. Just cut hot dogs in half (Nathans) and rolled them up and baked them! Hubby loved them too!!

I patted two triangles into a square and then cut that into three small squares.  I used lil' smokey sausages and dotted the dough with mustard and then rolled them up.  Next time I will add cheese like the recipe states and I am sure it will taste better.

These were amazing the family loved them! I didn't have any crescent rolls so I made my own dough using all purpose flower, a bit of sugar, cheese, butter, baking soda, salt, and cayenne pepper. I will surely make these again.
