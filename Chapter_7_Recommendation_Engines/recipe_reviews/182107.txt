These wings are wonderful.  Everyone in my house loved them.  I made them as written except I only mixed about 4 tbsp. water with the cornstarch. I think 3/4 of a cup would be too much and the sauce would not thicken up nicely.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This tastes very near a sweet-honey chicken ordered at a Chinese restaurant.  Changes I made:  I put about 1/3 cup of honey, rather than 5tbs.  Probably should have added a bit more cornstarch to thicken, but the taste was spot on for what I was going for.

Okay, I admit it. I cheated. My picture isn't of wings. It isn't even chicken. It's pork tenderloin and it was delicious. I roasted the tenderloin for 20 minutes, then added some sauce, and cooked for 15 minutes longer. I say 'some' sauce because this recipe made a lot of it. Like a whole medium pot full - be aware of that if you are scaling down the meat portion, or using it for something different. Really tasty, sweet, garlic-y goodness. Very glad I made it. It's next incarnation will be in a stir fry. Thanks!

These wings are incredible! My husband was so impressed that I made these!!! Thank-you to who ever submitted the recipe, I'll definitely be making these again! One trick I used was to bake the wings on a rack and let the grease drip onto a pan covered in tinfoil beneath. Super-crispy and the honey-garlic sauce is oh-so yummy!!!!

This was a good starter recipe. I made half a batch as stated and modified the other half. The original recipe is quite sweet and my daughter loved it. For the other half I added a few dashes of habenero sauce and about a teaspoon of cumin and garlic powder. The end result was sweet and spicy! It was great. They tasted like BWW's Carribean Jerk wings. When adding the cornstarch I did not add an additional 3/4 cup of water. I thought it would be too runny so I just reserved it from the 2 1/2 cups.

I doubled these for a party and the guests liked them but I thought they were too sweet as written. 
Made these adjustments for sticky wing perfection:
*I didn't fry the wings but dusted in seasoned flour and baked at 375 for 40 minuted.  Wings perfectly cooked.
*Before I added the sauce to the wings I gave a splash of rice wine vinegar and lime juice (to balance the sweet) and 1/4 cup of toasted sesame seeds. Boiled a little longer until thick...
It tasted just like the sesame chicken at our favorite asian cafe here in town.

This Recipe is is best thing ever!!! My Man LOVED these wings..Making them again for tonight. But I didn't have half of the ingredents on hand so I made a very simple version..Used the Honey, Brown Sugar, Garlic(used some garlic powder and minced), and water as on recipe..After Cooking in oven put wings in crockpot on low for 1-2 hrs until hubby got home from work..Turned out even simply made this dish is fantastic!

Fabulous, except . . . Cut the soya sauce in half, otherwise it's too Teriyaki-type falvoured. I made one set with no soya sauce and it was great as well, just a nice sweet honey garlic vs. tangy honey garlic with the soya sauce. Neither time, did I mix the extra 3/4 cup of water in with the cornstarch; I just used some of the hot sauce, as I felt there was enough water in this recipe and I wanted to max the flavour.

Also, pouring the sauce over the wings wastes a lot of sauce. I dunk the wings in the sauce and then bake 10 minutes, redunk again with the rest of the sauce and finish baking. Then the wings are nice and saucy and the least amount of sauce is wasted on the pan. I put a layer of tinfoil down and spray it with Pam. Then they don't stick to the pan much, if at all. Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

I've made it twice now.  I made the sauce the night before, and refrigerated...still worked. Added a few dashes of crushed red pepper the second time, we like a little heat

Very good! The only thing is I wish the sauce was a bit thicker. Maybe next time I'll try and marinade the wings...

Great flavor but needed to add extra honey and hot sauce to give them more of a kick. Also had to turn oven up to 425 to get them to crisp, we don't like chewy wings, we like them crispy. Also, ended up putting them back on the cookie sheet to get some of the sauce away from them because they will not crisp when they are sitting in a bunch of sauce. Will likely make them again because we did like the flavor.

Sauce didn't thicken much and drowned the wings.  This might be better if the water was decreased.  A total of 3-1/4 cups of water seems excessive for this amount of chicken.

I love the idea that I don't have to fry! Most of the recipes I've seen requires you to fry them to make it crunchy. This one takes out the excess fat. This is perfect!!!

These were awesome!  The only thing I changed was I used pure maple syrup instead of honey because I didn't have any.  I used 5 TB.  I'm going to be trying it with honey tonight to see which I prefer, but using the syrup made a very yummy sauce, with a definite maple flavor.  Try it if you like the taste of maple syrup!  My son, who hates chicken (unless it's KFC) loved this!

I just made this for dinner (for 2) and it was great with my alterations. I added about a tablespoon of the sweet chili sauce we always have on hand and a splash of worcestershire to balance the sugar and give it a bit more of a honey bbq flavor.

Waaaaayyyyyy too much water! I'd cut it in half and instead of baking them again I would put them in an electric skillet. I poured out a ton of watery sauce and the skin on the wings were mushy still.

great easy recipe!! chicken was very tender and juicy i gave it 4 stars only because it was a tad bit too sweet. the next time i try this recipe i'll probably try it with a little less brown sugar and maybe add extra garlic the sweetness kind of over powered the garlic taste but it was a easy recipe to follower for a beginner like myself thanks for the recipe :)

These were really good, but I think there is too much water in the recipe for the sauce to stick, it was really runny, but tasted good. Thanks

Made these tonight - and we have a new family favourite!  I used the larger chicken drumsticks (drummies) and followed the recipe (tossed raw chicken in oil, salt & pepper to roast).  I could easily use this sauce for a few different things - it was great!

What a fantastic recipe!  Reduced the sauce a bit before adding the cornstarch, and used it on chicken tenderloins.  Absolutely delicious.  This is definitely a keeper - and so easy!  Want to try it on noodles with a few sesame seeds thrown in...

These were ok. I thought the sauce was too runny despite boiling it for 20 or so minutes. It didn't stick well to the chicken wings while baking. Most of it sat in the pan and burned :-( What did stick to the chicken was sweet and yummy, but there wasn't enough of it. Probably won't try this one again.

I was looking for a wing sauce to recreate the sauce of a popular chinese restaurant in my hometown--with some tweaking--I found it!

I didn't make that many wings, only 10 whole wings, split with tips cut. I used 1 c water, not 2.5,  I used 1 heaping TBSP of Splenda brown sugar blend, about 3 tbsp honey, about 1/3 c soy sauce, the same amount of garlic, which means if I were making all the wings that this recipe called for I would double the pressed/minced garlic. For the thickening agent, I use 3/4 c water and the full three tbsp of corn starch. These were delicious, definately a keeper.

These were delicious! My kids called them "Asian BBQ chicken". I reduced the water to 2 cups and 1/4 cup, respectively. It still made a lot of sauce but it worked out fine. I poured the sauce over the (previously-baked) wings and let them braise uncovered in a nonstick pan for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, turning them once. The wings were deliciously sticky and the meat was like velvet. Next time, I'm going to add a few tablespoons of sambal to make them more like asian-style buffalo wings. I will definitely make this recipe again - the wings came out restaurant-quality.

GREAT recipe with a few tweaks.  VERY sweet, if you love sweet stuff (like me) perfect! otherwise you may want to reduce amount of sugar by 1/4 cup.  Not enough corn starch/too much water.. I had to add more cornstarch to make sauce thicker. Also, wayyyy to much sauce. You could easily 1/2 it (or  double the wings.. I suggest this instead of halfing the sauce :) ) I also added some hot sauce to kick it up a notch.., a couple more cloves of garlic, and  more ginger root.. just my personal preference.

I used this over chicken breasts.  The sauce was good - yet to break its plain sweetness I added onion powder and garlic.  That helped a lot.

They were just ok, a litte too sweet for my tastes and definately too much water.  Will cut down considerably next time.

Served with steamed jasmine rice tonight and it was PERFECT. They were loved by all. Thanks a million! A couple of tweaks I made: added juice of 1 lime, and 1 tbsp louisiana hot sauce to give it some tang and heat. I'll be making a monster batch of these for an upcoming party, and after tonight I know they're going to be a home run.

I just used this sauce on BBQ'd chicken thighs. It was great, but needed the 15 min bake time at the end as it was quite runny for me. Next time, make is like the recipe states and bake, or thicken the sauce more on the stove or with more cornstarch. It was very tasty and well received by everyone.

It was a refreshing taste, but could have been stronger with the ginger root.  The sauce had a bit too much water, it did not thicken as I expected.

Gobbled down by husband and nephews!!  I made the recipe as directed with the exception of the water and cornstarch thickening, I only used about 3 tbsp of each. This produced saucy wings.  I also made 1/2 times the sauce for about 40 wings, probably could have just gone with 1 recipe.

These were good but a little too sweet for our taste. We're just used to the spicy hot wings but if you like sweet wings, try these.

I made these wings today with this exact recipe and they we're amazing. The only thing I will change for next time is the amount of brown sugar. It is very sweet. Maybe reduce the soy sauce a little too.

Good base recipe for this kind of thing, but too sweet and not enough savory.  I made it pretty much exactly on recipe, except I added some fresh lime juice at the end for brightness.  But the sauce is slightly bland actually.  Need more soy sauce, less water, a few red pepper flakes, and a little molasses instead of some of the honey wouldn't hurt.  They lack....umami, a savory meatiness.  I'll try again but with some definite tweaks.  I'll up the soy, reduce the brown sugar, add the red pepper flakes, and perhaps some cooking juices from the chicken.  But it was...okay.

It tasted great but it never did thicken up... way too much water.  I broiled my wings for 10 minutes at 475 (5 minutes per side) instead of frying them first.  Next time I'll use a total amount of 2 1/2 cups water.  Served with rice to soak up the sauce.

This was pretty good, but I think more starch is needed to thicken it up. I made this minus the ginger root, because I didn't have any, but it still tasted pretty good. Used on bite size boneless skinless chicken breast. Will be saving this recipe and making again.

A good base recipe, but as others stated way too much sauce and I wish it was thicker and had a bit more flavour.  I made this exactly the way the recipe was stated.  I think next time I will 1/2 the sauce and add a little something more.

I made this recipe last night and we were so looking forward to it because of all the great reviews. We were very disappointed in the flavor. The wings were moist and tender, but the sauce was very bland and waaaay too sweet.

This recipe was AWESOME. We love getting wings when we go out so making them at home like this will save us a bunch. Halfway through the recipe I realized I was out of garlic, so I used some chopped onion and these still turned out really well. Also I didn't have cornstarch but used flour instead. I reduced the amount of water I used, I used 2 cups of water for the first bit and only 1/2 cup for the flour. I ended up using about 4 tbsps of flour and it worked out still. I was slightly worried that the sauce was still too runny when I poured it over the wings, but it reduces perfectly in the oven. I didn't use all the sauce but I wish I had, since they would have been even MORE saucy and delicious! I would recommend this recipe to anyone any everyone, it's SO EASY! Thank you for sharing this one with us.

I love, love, LOVE this recipe!  I agree with others though, I added a bit more cornstarch and slightly less water to make the sauce thicker.  But the flavor was fantastic!  My husband and I could not get enough the first time I made them.  I couldn't find this recipe to make them again tonight, so I used something close, and it was just not right.  I was desperate to find this again, and now that I have, I will NOT lose it again!

Tried these last night and they were just perfect. Sticky, sweet, and finger licking good. I followed the recipe (just added a bit more garlic though, we love garlic in our house), but at the end I removed the wings from the baking dish and put them on a baking sheet in the oven at 450 degrees (F) for 7 minutes to give them a crispier skin. DELICIOUS!

Too sweet!  This recipe really needs an acidic component to cut the sweetness and allow the other flavours to come through.

We did not  enjoy these as they were not crisp enough as there was too much liquid. The flavor was bland as  we poured off the sauce to brown a bit in the oven. We would not make these again.

Made them tonight. Let's just say I will never buy store bought sauce again. The recipe tasted just like wings from a good pizza place. I would say it was a bit too much sauce for 24 chicken wings, can store some for later. Also, I will add more garlic next time, I thought it needed more. But definitely A+++++

Perfect!  Tweaked in the following way- no ginger (out of it) and no soy (also out of it).  I used teriyaki sauce instead.  Also added chili powder and red pepper for some heat...Wierd though- the ones dipped and  cooked with the sauce were not hot, just really flavorful.  The left over sauce, I used for dipping and it was HOT!  Perfect!

Soggy, mushy wings with inedible skin.  Thought the would have been better without the water or cornstarch.  I followed the recipe exactly except at the end I put them back in under the broiler trying to crisp them to no avail.

I made this exactly as written, but it seemed like there was way too much sauce. I had to put the wings in a cake pan, and the sauce was at least an inch deep. So we didn't get crispy, coated wings. The flavor was good, though, and the wings were very sticky. My daughter loved them. I will try making this with less sauce next time.

Made this for the 4th of july BBQ, everyone loved the chicken. the only thing I did different was to make the sauce the day befor and double it. I marinated the chicken overnight in 1 batch of sauce minus the cortarch and water,and the second batch i cooked on the stove with the cornstarch and water it thickend up nicely and I glazed the chicken with it a few times while it cooked on the grill! will make this again and again! loved it! thanks for sharing!

I love the sauce in this recipe. I made it and put oven-fried breaded chicken pieces (think McNuggets) in it. I served it over veggie fried rice. My DH loved it! This one is a keeper. Thanks for a wonderful addition to our menu!

It sounded a lot better than it tasted. Cloyingly sweet and all too similar to some bottled, commercial "Oriental"  sauces I've tried.  A little tweaking could make this a good one. I'd try it next time with a little less sugar, a touch more soy sauce and something acid like rice vinegar. Also replacing some of the brown sugar with mirin might work.

This sauce is finger licking good! I baked the wings in a glass dish then tip-drain and pour the sauce all over and bake again till done. Oh so sticky sweet!   I only changed the ending water/cornstarch to 2t. of each, mix and add in sauce to thicken. Yummy! Thank's for the recipe.

It's perfect the way it is! I cut up chicken breast into 1 inch pieces, and marinated them in this over night. (and froze the rest of the left over sauce in zip lock baggies- tastes great from frozen as well) and then wrapped half a pc of bacon around each, and put them on a shishkabob stick with pineapple chunks and grilled- everyone loved them!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used the sauce from this recipe on chicken breasts and it was still good.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. I also only used 4 tbsp of water to mix with the cornstarch like one reviewer suggested.  I served this with the Fried Rice Restaurant Style from this site.  The leftover sauce from this recipe tastes good with the rice.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using chicken breasts instead of wings.  The flavor was okay, not great.  Won't be making again, but if I did, I would probably add more cornstarch--it did not thicken and get 'sticky' as much as I would have liked, even though I tried cooking it down.

yummy! followed the recipe exactly and it was great as is. My husband feels that wings should always be spicy so i split the sauce in 2 and put cayenne and red chili paste in his half. he loved it! baked them on a rack on top of a foil lined sheet so they'd cook on both sides. next time i may flip them halfway so they'll be nicely glazed/sticky on both sides.

this will be my second time making these.  The only adjustment that I made was to cut back on the garlic a bit.  Just depends on your garlic clove size how many you want to use!!  And, make sure EVERYONE eats the garlic!!

This was such a hit for our Big Game party last night. Even my husband, who isn't a wing eater, gave very high compliments on this sauce! I will definitely be making this again! 

I cooked my wings in the instant pot and finished them under the broiler using the sauce recipe you have given. I topped the wings off with some red pepper flakes to add just a bit of heat to the sweet. BEST wings I have ever had!

Omg it was AMAZING as written. My husband was literally sticking his fingers in the left overs (we did two sauces for our wings so we have at least one more meals worth to savour)! Delicious and will be making it again and again! Very rare I don’t change a recipe but this one is delicious

Flavour was nice, but the sauce was much too runny.

The sweet sauce was great with these wings! You could add some red pepper flakes for heat. Great with rice to give it that Chinese taste. I needed extra cornstarch for mine, but otherwise followed as written!

Roasting the wings first made a difference.  They were nice and crispy.  Sauce was a good consistency and a a great taste.

This is the best honey garlic recipe I've come across for chicken wings.  My kids love it and always request it.  I followed the recipe exactly, only added chili flakes as we like it spicy.  It does make a lot of sauce but I save it to use for another date later in the week.  Thanks for the recipe!

The sauce from this recipe is fantastic on its own.  I made it right by the recipe this time, but I'm sure the water/cornstarch step could be adjusted to suite your desired consistency.

Amazing! Tastes absolutely amazing. Easy to follow recipe, and amazing taste. We only used 2 cups of water (no need to add the extra water with the corn starch if you want a thicker sauce) and 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.

Very delicious sauce!  Instead of tossing it with chicken wings, I added sliced honey garlic sausages to it.  Also, I added a spoonful of chili garlic paste for a little bit of heat and it worked beautifully.

I made this exactly as recipe stated. We did not like them. Super soggy & way, way too sweet in a thin runny sauce. My husband's comment when I asked what he thought? "Those really were not good," he said.  There are so many delicious crispy & sticky baked wings recipes. This is not one of them. (Try "Japanese Chicken Wings" or "Mahogany Chicken Wings" on allrecipes.)

This recipe was delicious. I left out the cornstarch process. I added crushed red peppers to my meat seasoning, I baked my wings @350 for 40 mins and then poured the sauce on top, mixed and let the sauce marinate into the meat. For the sauce I used less soy (about 2-3 tbs) and the same measurements of honey & water (NO brown sugar). I also used minced garlic instead. This was a hit, My family loved it.

Excellent! Both my granddaughter and my husband loved it! The only thing I will do differently next time is to season the chicken wings with a bit of salt and pepper when first cooking them in the oven. I thought the meat was a little bland. Other than that, great recipe. I plan to make some ahead and freeze them.

This was not good at all. I reduced the sugar as someone suggested and was good I did as it was quite sweet even with less sugar. I think the temperature  needs to be much higher as the wings never got any colour and therefore the skin was not eatable.

I've made these wings about a dozen times by the recipe ,they're always great. Tonight I substituted 1/2 cup white wine for 1/2 cup water and used dark soya sauce instead of reduced sodium.  Also cut back on the water to thicken and added 1/2 tbs more starch( I can only get yucca starch here in Costa Rica) . This was absolutely the best wing sauce.P.S. I've used this recipe on legs and thighs too.

This is a great recipe! I added chili peppers to make it a little spicy. Other than that the recipe is perfect!

I enjoyed the sauce as I like my wings sweet.  Before baking the wings I sprinkled them with a little salt, black pepper and garlic powder for some extra flavor.  I also reduced the water from 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup when mixing in 3 tbsp cornstarch to thicken sauce.   I think 3/4 cup water would have made sauce too runny.

Great wings. I took the advice and reduced the amount of water. I seasoned the wings with black pepper before baking and reduced the amount of honey in the sauce.  My elderly peeps who aren't crazy about wings loved them. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.......I used chicken thighs and cooked for an hour at 400.  I halved the amount of water.  Family loved them.

I use this sauce for wings, ribs and pulled pork. It's wonderful! I substitute arrowroot flour for the cornstarch though.

Love it! We buy the raw, seasoned wings at Costco, cook them for 1/2 hour, then put this sauce on top and bake for another 10 minutes or so.  It's always a hit!

I added a tablespoon of lemon.  These were an absolute hit! It was great listening to everyone suck the sauce of their fingers.  It showed me that everyone enjoyed them.  I had no left overs.  Just cleaned bones!  At first my son said...just give me four mom, no six is good..then he was taking them from his sister until he learned I had more! lol  I can't say nothing bad about this recipe.

My go-to chicken wing recipe for wing night. Everyone in my family loves them and I have made them for guests as well who couldn't believe how delicious they were. The sauce has the right amount of sweetness and there is so much left over sauce that I put it in a bowl on the side for dipping. Definitely a must.

Great recipe every time I make it people love it. I like to cover my wings in flour first and bake them for 5 min then brush on the sauce, bake them till the sauce is golden on top, turn them over and coat the other side.

coated ch wing w/garlic powder ,pepper tsp oil.mix well. baked 400 with skin side up . 30 min .use sauce from stove top drizzeled over wings . bake 15 more min . Next time I will follow instructions at 375 since these were crispy but meat was too well done in spots . Now for the sauce....once it thickened , it reminded me of general TSOS sauce except not spicy or hot . also it was lacking in real flavors .Next time I will add more for sure . Good enough to save extra sauce though ....for another day and maybe add some heat.

I did an almost straight run through, added a little more garlic and ginger, next time I would add a rooster sauce element. This recipe makes a lot of sauce, I did 9 wings, separated, and had enough marinade leftover to do two large pork chops.

These wings are delicious! I usually grill them and then pour the sauce over.  If the kids aren't eating them I add a couple squirts of Siracha to the sauce for some kick.

Loved this recipe, but I'm surprised some people are saying it's "not too sweet."  I'm assuming they are comparing it to sucking down pixie sticks, because this is the sweetest chicken recipe I've ever made by far.  I did cut back on the water when mixing the corn starch.  I had a few chicken thighs left over and threw some sauce on them as well, and it was great.  Not as crisp as they could be, so I might throw them under the broiler next time.

There has been comments that the sauce is not as thick as they would like. 
I (accidentally) added the cornstarch right into the sauce that was boiling on the stove. I also made the separate cornstarch and water mixture and added them together. The sauce was PERFECT! Sticky, yet not runny. It was great. Instead of using 3 tbsp cornstarch, use 6! It was very yummy

This was easy to make and a hit. I still have half the receipe left over for the next wing night. It was not super sweet, just right. Would be great for wings for Superbowl Parties. Try it you will love it. Thanks for sharing Krista :)

I used this recipe and I love it ... I added just a little more cornstarch to make it a bit thicker,an extra tbsp of honey, a little cayenne pepper, two extra cloves of garlic and regular soy sauce... I let the chicken cook uncovered for a while to let the sauce cook on and then I put the chicken in the bottom broiler to give it a bit of crispiness on top and it came out absolutely scrumptious!

Soggy even when I put them on a grill rack with a pan underneath.  The flavor was too bland for me.  I put them under the broiler in hopes of salvaging my wings but still just blah!!!!!!!!!  I'm actually going to take the leftover wings and stick them in the crockpot for a couple hours with a bottle of KC Masterpiece.  Hopefully, they will be edible.

This was an easy and simple recipe. My hubby loved them but not a big hit with the kids. I also left out the extra water to be added at the end.

This was probably the best recipe for wings I have made to date! Everyone raved over it and then asked, "Is there more"? Sadly, there wasn't! Next time I am doubling the recipe - although it does make a huge amount of sauce. Maybe just double the amount of wings!Thanks, Krista for a delish recipe!

This was a great tasting recipe, but I agree with another reviewer that the sauce was too thin mixing 3/4 c. of water with the cornstarch.  Next time I will definitely use less water so the sauce is thick enough to coat the wings better.  The thinner sauce I made still tasted great and I used the extra as a dipping sauce.

This recipe was good overall, nothing exceptional that my husband and I could note, however. Perhaps the chicken was not cooked as crispy as we'd prefer and the sauce did not seem to stick to it as well as hoped.

I thought the garlic/ginger flavors were overpowered by the sweetness of the brown sugar & honey, and the sauce never really thickened.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars for taste along, but the sauce did not come out very thick. Next time I will reduce the sauce longer than stated and add more cornstarch (or use arrowroot instead).

I thought this was a good recipe.  I did do a couple of things differently.  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  I also barbequed the chicken thighs with sea salt and pepper.  When they were completely cooked I drizzed the sauce over them

These were soooo good, and very easy to prepare. I bake my wings the Alton Brown way (steaming for 10 minutes, then baking for 40 minutes at 425), and this sauce was the perfect complement to crispy wings. Later I realized that I forgot to use the ginger (even after buying it - dumb me!), but they still turned out delicious. My boyfriend's family raved about these all night.

Delicious! You can use this sauce on so many things. I only changed the water w/ the cornstarch to 4 TBS as suggested. Also there was a lot of leftover sauce (I made 30 wings and still had lots extra) but that is OK because I will just find something else to make it on! I will be making this for summer barbeques for sure! I also sprinkled some seasame seeds on top just for fun.  I also would suggest using "release" aluminum foil for the first cooking of the chicken, cause it stuck a bit.

Really good recipe, great as is or as a base. Could add some spice to it if you like.
