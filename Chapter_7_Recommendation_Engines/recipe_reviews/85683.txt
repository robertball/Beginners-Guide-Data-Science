I would give this no stars if I could.  One of, if not the worst recipes I have made off of this site.  One question.......did Bacardi actually try this recipe before posting it?  I followed the recipe to a "T", with the exception of the flavor of rum, because I had the coconut flavored rum on hand.  That shouldn't make much of a difference though, because the recipe was going for a tropical feel.  The bananas made the sauce and fish wet and slimy. I love halibut and I could not even eat this, even after scraping off the sauce. I wouldnt even attempt this recipe again with changes, it is that bad.  If you are looking for a excellent halibut recipe, check out "Baked Halibut Steaks" on this site.

I couldn't get halibut at our local fishmonger - so I used catfish instead. The sauce has an odd flavor on its own, but put it on the grilled fish and WOW!  We aren't big fish eaters, but this is a great recipe - easy to make and wonderful flavor.

I really like the carribean flare this recipe offered. The banana sauce gave the halibut a really interesting kick. If you like to experiment, I would definately recommend this recipe.
