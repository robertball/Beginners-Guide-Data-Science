I made this recipe for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada Spring Bling. I think the seasoning amounts need to checked, I used 1/2 tbsp of basil and parsley and kept everything else the same, except using fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt. The basil taste was quite strong and I would reduce it more. I made 8 patties, 10 would be really small.

I liked the seasoning, but I think I'm one of those people who likes stuff in their burgers.  Will make again, but add veggies to meat
