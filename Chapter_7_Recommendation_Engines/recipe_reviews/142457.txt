I was very suprised at the nice texture of these cookies. I normally am not a fan of "cake like" cookies, but these were incredibly tender and flavorful. Very easy to prepare, and the batter stayed in place while baking. I added flaked almonds which added crunch, and added nicely to the flavor. Kudos to you in your late night cravings and the successful recipe!

Sorry, I already rated it with five stars because it looks great (and a mother's opinion is generally right :P). I haven't made it yet, but I'm only 15, so I was wondering if it's okay to make it without the bourbon and liqueur?

These turned out really good! I didn't have nutmeg, so I used 1 t allspice instead. I also used vegan sour cream, and vanilla-nut extract instead of the bourbon. I also added some white and dark chocolate chips. Very yummy!!!

These were yummy, I did find them very greasy though--didn't even grease the cookie sheet and it was coated.  I did use butter instead of margarine so not sure if that had a lot to do with it.  The almonds have natural oil so I think I would cut down on the butter next time.  Mine also flattened out a lot more than at least the pictured ones, this is I'm sure due to the butter.  They are not cake-like at all, but more like a chocolate chip cookie consistency--a little crunchy and a little chewy.  This was good and I would definitely make again.
