I've been looking for a good Greek seasoning mix for awhile now (only one I believe on AR calls for dried mint, which I can't bring myself to buy, only b/c I don't see myself using it frequently enough), so I was overjoyed to see this recipe pop up as a new one. I made it this afternoon (nixed the bouillon) and I mixed 1 TB of it w/ 1 TB EVOO and 2 TB red wine vinegar to marinate some chicken strips in. Grilled the chicken and BLADOW! It was really tasty!

Ading 1 teaspoon of dried mint would make it perfect.  The dried mint does not give it a sweet taste at all, but lends a little zip. You can reconstitute it with EVOO and lemon juice, if you don't like red wine vinegar...

Good. I would omit chix base and add rosemary, lemon-pepper and as Aunt Julie said, mint. Also consider using granulated garlic and onion. I think they are more flavorful. Opa!

I have been looking for something like this, instead of buying it in a well known supermarket and not being all that happy with it.  Think that altho' I have never tried it, mint might be rather nice.

cinnamon was ok, but changes whole taste of Greek Chicken.  Would omit cinnamon.

I've made this MANY times, and I absolutely LOVE IT!  I usually double the recipe and keep it in an empty Parsley bottle (relabeled, or course) for use whenever I want to grill or broil Greek Style lamb.  I no longer have to wait for the Greek Fairs to get my lamb fix.  I rub it on and refrigerate the meat for an hour or so, or Vacuum Seal it and freeze the meat for when I get a craving for Greek Style Lamb or Chicken. Yummy!
