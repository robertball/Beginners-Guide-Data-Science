Just made my first batch and they are very good. My only issue is there might be too much salt. I can't even believe I'm saying that because I'm a salt lover. Another recipe I was looking at only calls for 1/4 tsp of salt and I think I'll follow that next time. But these definitely won't be thrown out! They're great. It does take some babysitting of the oven, but it's worth it. I might play around a little bit with some more cinnamon, less salt, more brown sugar and see what I get. All in all a great recipe and worth a try!

I love this recipe! Just like the local amusement park's glazed pecans.. Thanks so much.. I did change one thing. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown sugar.. Worked great..

Awesome! We did them in the frying pan instead of baking them because we needed them super quick. Turned out great and made our salad a hit! Also went very well with our baked brie :) Will definitely make again!

I looked for this recipe after paying $8 for a 1/4 lb of these sold as gourmet nuts.  I can't ever resist recreating a recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand (I'm from Texas and pecans are a staple in one's home), so I made these this weekend and people couldn't stop eating.  I followed the direction with no changes.  So, for about $6 we enjoyed a 1 lb of these delicious nuts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a keeper

I made these to give to a friend for her birthday a while back. I was kind of stumped for a small gift for her. I really wanted to do something homemade. I'm not too crafty, but love to cook. When I saw this recipe, I got inspired. We had had something similar (and expensive) in Disney World and loved them. She is from Texas, so figured it was a good sign! They were awesome!! She got so excited when she pulled the container out of the gift bag..."I LOVE pecans! How did you know?" I didn't, just picked the right thing! Make a big batch...they won't last long!

These were good and easy. I want some with a little kick and will add some cayenne to them on the next batch.  The coating was nice and thick once baked, not a glaze.

I've made these twice now and they are wonderful. I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar for mine and they tasted exactly like the ones I bought at a festival. I made with pecans once and almonds once. Both were great!

After reading some of the reviews before mine, I replaced half of the white sugar for brown sugar. It really did make all the difference! They're not too sweet, but just enough. I experimented with the spices, and found that over the holidays, it's nice to add a little nutmeg in there. I"ll definitely be sending these to my loved ones for Christmas!

I make these mostly around the holidays and my husband can barely keep his hands out of them. I have shared the recipe numerous times because my guests love them. They taste just like the nuts you get at the fairs!

This was good. However, i did not think it was so much a glaze finish. The final product was more like spiced pecans with a crystallized sugar coating.  Still trying to find a good glazed pecan recipe.

I made the this morning and my DH and  I keep going to them.  I did  use two egg whites because my eggs seemed so small. made them to put in a salad and will  use them over ice cream and many other things.   I wonder can you store them in a tight cookie tin and do they freeze well.  I will put some in the freezer later. I can't wait to have the salad this evening. I  would like to have some on hand all the time for company. I just looked at my rating because I want to make them again, but I don't remember using  so much vanilla. Is  1 Tablespoon too much?

I broke this up into 2 batches, adding an extra cup or two of pecans to absorb all of the extra glaze. I also put in more cinnamon, but next time I might do a full 2-2.5 tbsp. Based on other reviews, I also did 1/2 white & brown sugar. I didn't have parchment paper, so I lined a lasagna glass pan with foil and roasted a thin layer of pecans for 1.5 hours, stirring a couple times. The second batch (with a few dashes of cayenne) was in a smaller pan so took even longer.

These were incredibly easy.  I thought that they would be very sticky, and stick to the pan and everything else.  I had no problems while they were baking, but they did stick a little after they cooled but they were sitting in a pool of the coating.  They were a christmas favorite this year.

I made these with the husband and they turned out great! We followed the recipe exactly except that we didn't have a full pound of pecans. We had friends over and they devoured them; we are making them again to give as gifts for christmas.

Super easy and sooooo good.  These get better with age, they get nice and crunchy after a few days.  I made extra and have chopped them and used them in other recipes and salads.

Excellent recipe.  They smell wonderful and taste so good.  Very easy and don't worry about them lasting very long.  They will be gone quickly.

This recipe is awesome and so easy.  For those of you that like the salty flavor just sprinkle a bit over them after pulling out of the oven...yum!

Perfect recipe!  Tastes just like the Nutty Bavarian.  I did add a little extra cinnamon. (I always add extra cinnamon to everything because I love it!)  These are their best warm out of the oven.

I’ve made several batches of these over the past couple of years. This time I added a tbs of maple extract. It took them to a whole new level! I give them to coworkers as gifts, and they can’t get enough of them. You can add more pecans than the 1 lb it calls for. I added another 5 oz. or so with no other adjustments, and they were still fantastic!

Made exactly as stated. These are addictive, so unless you have someone to help you eat them - watch out!! I was worried they might be too salty per another review, but I didn't think they were. Would make again.

The only thing I changed was using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white. The brown sugar makes them ultra tasty :)

This is just what I was looking for. I was buying store bought glazed pecans and decided I could do it cheaper myself. I used the chopped pecans so that I could use them in oatmeal, yogurt, ice cream, on salads, baking and of course just snacking. These are terrific and so easy! I did substitute brown sugar for half of the white.

This recipe has caused a real problem in my family.  I made these (excluding the cinnamon) to top a simple green salad.  Now we can eat salads without them!  Yes, they are that good.  I do add quite a few more nuts to use up the glaze, otherwise it is just a little bit too much topping.  I want them to be glazed and not so candy like.
Excellent recipe!  Be warned they are addictive and your family will have to have them too! :)

These were fabulous! I made the changes as others had suggested - to use half white sugar and half brown, and cut back on the salt a little. What I liked about this recipe better that others that I was going to try, is that this recipe didn’t call for any butter.

Stuck to the recipe. Came out awesome. Just like stopping between Kerrville and Fredericksburg at a Texas roadside stand. Heavily German populated area of the Lone Star State deep in the heart of hill country provides hearty food and breathtaking views in every direction. Takes me back to my family roots!  Thanks for posting!

So easy to make! Tastes wonderful.  Planning on making more to give as holiday goodies. I did tweak the recipe making it sweet & spicy.  Did split sugars 1/2 white sugar 1/2 lt. brown, added a little more vanilla and some cayenne pepper.  These are the bomb!

We made these at Christmas 2012 instead of Pecan Pie and it was a hit!!!  I made two different batches, the first batch was with white sugar only.  The second batch was with 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  The family really liked the 1/2 and 1/2 the best.  As they say to each their own but there was 15 people that did the taste test and they all agreed that they liked the brown sugar the best!!!  Great recipe...enjoy!

These were yummy! I added a bit of nutmeg, and I doubled it because I had 2 lbs of pecans. I also used Splenda sugar blend to cut back on the sugar.

I've been making this recipe for going on 8 yrs now? Only changes I have ever made is subbing in half brown sugar half white. It does make a difference, however it's subtle. My husbands coworkers call them "pe-candies" and tell me I should sell them! My own coworkers buy me pecans so I can make them some. Over the yrs I do  find I like to increase the cinnamon to a full TBS, and use real vanilla extract or ground vanilla bean if you can afford it.

These are wonderful. I did use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and baked them at 275 as another had suggested.  I also only used 1/4 tsp of salt. I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I used the skillet on very low...using plastic chop sticks to turn them..I made one recipe of the glaze but it covered much more then 16oz of pecans...I did more than twice this amount..
Awesome flavor..
I turned the cooked ones on to a plain cookie sheet to cool
Enjoy

They were so delicious. I use sea salt just because  I was going to mix with Carmel popcorn. My Carmel popcorn never tasted so good.  Served in paper bags and we were ready for movie night.   My 16yo son wanted me to teach him how to make them. He followed the recipe with only one question (how long to beat the egg white). He mixed in walnuts because we didn’t have enough pecans (still amazing). He plans on taking them to the first day of school to share with his friends.  There was one thing I didn’t like about these glazed pecans. They are so addictive. I had to tell myself, “step away from the bowl.”

These were a HUGE hit, best glazed pecans ever!  I used cinnamon essential oil in addition to the powdered and it really made the flavor pop.

I had a great recipe that called for candied pecans, and I thought to myself, I could make those.  They were very easy, but take a little time.  I actually used some good maple syrup instead of vanilla.  Marvelous!  I am planning to make lots for gifts this Christmas.

I made the recipe as called for EXCEPT I knew butter was going to add a salty, creamy flavor. It also cooks and does not make the recipe runny or sticky. I added 1 TBSP of softened butter to the mixture and these pecans could not have come out better. The key to this recipe is stirring while in the oven. I used a rubber, scraping spatula to stir the pecans and continue to coat them while in the oven. Check them every ten to fifteen minutes but do not go past that time or you risk the coating being more in the pan and less on your pecans. Also, once the pecans begin to harden, do not let them burn. It's best to take them out once you can hear them against each other and there is no more coating going on. These were awesome and I will be making these again.

These are delicious!!  My kitchen smelled just like the store in the mall where I usually buy candied nuts!  I've made them a few times but this time I decided to try what others have written by using some brown sugar instead of all white.  I can't say I really noticed a difference.  People are shocked that these homemade nuts are really so easy to make!  I'm wondering if it would be the same recipe if I tried cashews?  Probably!

It's that time of year when roadside stands selling pecans pop up all over Texas. I have been wanting to try and make glazed pecans, but was intimidated. This recipe is so easy, there is no way to fail. The glaze was a perfect amount of crunch. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to add some zip. Sweet, salty and spicy.

I made these because my daughter had something similar on a sweet potato casserole and wanted some on ours for Thanksgiving.  

I put them out on  on the appetizer table  and they were so popular we had to set some aside for my daughter's sweet potato casserole.

I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp per pound of pecans and thought they were fine that way.

I have made this recipe about 5 times now. It has always turned out perfectly. It's very easy to do. I did change the one cup of sugar to half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. I would highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe. I lost one from years ago. This one seemed similar. And turned out delicious. If you like a little sweet and spicy kick. Try a tsp of Cayanne pepper to the mix. Yummy!!

Perfect recipe just as described. We made a batch and the kids are loving it. While there seems to be a lot of sugar, it doesn't end up incredibly sweet. I doubt they will last long enough for me ot bring in to share at work.

Was craving something sweet and nutty. Found this recipe and had everything in the recipe - basic stuff most cooks have on hand.  Whipped it up in about 10 minutes and patiently flipped them every 15 minutes. Totally worth the wait! These are delicious!

I have made this recipe 5 times now and it is so wonderful.  HINT: Make plenty and freeze in small containers.  Holds up very well.  Great for snacks, gifts, and to put on pumpkin pie or sprinkled over other deserts.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!

I really liked it, as did my husband. Only downside was that the pecans got really soft when they cooked. We are going to try it again with almonds and see if we can maintain some of the crunch

This was AWESOME. I used the same glaze on walnuts too. I didn't have parchment paper, so in one pan I used my silpat, and for the other I just sprayed a 9x13 with non stick. They both worked great. I just scraped up the bottom when I stirred with a bamboo spoon. 5 stars for sure!!

I made this recipe exactly as written today.  Although they were good, they did not fly out of the jar like the glazed pecans I am used to from Texas.  Next time I may try a little pepper or something to offset the extreme sweetness of them.  They are fantastic with eggnog!

FANTASTIC! My house smells wonderful! I could barely wait 5 minutes for them to cool before trying one - then two which lead to - ok, so I lost count. Point is they are addicting!  I am thinking of doing another batch to save for decorating a carrot cake with next. Love a simple recipe that I can throw together in just 30 minutes!

In the first batch, I followed recipe as written.  Pecans were a little dry BUT they were still wonderful!  In the second batch (the next day), I lessened the cook time to 12 minute cycles.  They were perfect.  I'll blame this variance to my oven and not the recipe.    These were a big hit.
