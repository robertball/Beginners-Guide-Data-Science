I made this yesterday. I made the cake exactly as the recipe states except I only baked it for 35 minutes. It is a moist dense cake. Tastes wonderful. I did change the frosting by adding about 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, tsp of Madagascar bourbon vanilla, and another 3/4 cup powdered sugar because I was in the mood for chocolate frosting.

The cake was tasty but very dense. Don’t expect much rise out of it. I did 2 layers by doubling recipe. Those were a bit lumpy. I decided to do a third layer. That single layer turned out great. That ended up as my top layer. It had a flat top for frosting. I did refrigerate layers for a couple hours before layering, one hr. After layers I did frost and decorations. The inside is store bought cream cheese frosting. The outside is store bought whipped chocolate frosting. It tasted great, but cut small as it’s very rich!
