This was really quite good, and my kids liked it, which is always a plus.  I thought it was a good soup but could use a little seasoning change to give it more flavor. . . not sure what to add, though.  Will probably make this again and tinker with it a little, though it is not bad as written.

Delicious!!! I used chicken broth as I thought the vegetable may be too bland. I also tossed my asparagus in a zip lock bag, poured some olive oil over it, sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic and let it maranade a while before grilling. That alone is amazing!

Love this! I substitute chicken broth for vegetable broth. The recipe is not 100% clear so this is what I did:
-cut the asparagus into 2 inch spears
-grill the asparagus with the oil
-once the onion/flour/oil/broth mixture is boiling I add the grilled asparagus (if you would like to keep a couple spears out to use as garnish now is the time)
-simmer for 10mins
-blend the soup 
So much flavor and lovely texture.

Creamy delish soup and it offers something different. A great alternative for a thick soup without the cream. Puréeing the vegetables is the only right thing to do with this soup... I'm still searching the directions to find out how much Asparagus gets puréed...  I did all of it excepted a few pieces for the garnish.  I also had a leftover ear of roasted corn I cut off the cob and threw in the blender as well but I'm sure the flavor would have been just a perfect without it. My wife has ask that we have this again. Pretty darn good, be sure to try this one.

I ended up throwing in the chopped up asparagus in the soup and added a few dashes of Frank's hot sauce, which gave it the edge it needed. I then put the mixture through the food processor and added 1 avocado while I pureed it - it turned out excellent. It's a yummy flavorful soup and the avocado gives it that "cream of asparagus texture" without the cream. I would make again!

Great recipe, very good. You forgot to mention to combine the asparagus with the broth mixture when you blend it, but I figured that was just an oversight. Anyway, that's what I did, and it came out great!
