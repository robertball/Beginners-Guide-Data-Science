I used this recipe as a platform for a frittata of my own design. I used real eggs and eliminated the cheddar and onion. I sauted the asparagus in olive oil with fresh mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper. I combined everything in a cast iron skillet and baked it at 350 degrees for about 30 mins - until it was firm in the center. It was delicious and it reheated well for next day leftovers.

I have always loved asparagus, and this is a WONDERFUL recipe for it!  Changes I made were to use half a white onion and two stalks of green onion, plus a whole tomato.  Added a little more egg substitute (total of 1 2/3 cups) to account for the slightly extra mass.  I was worried about adding tomato because of the moisture, but I cleaned out the seeds and connecting pulp and it came out perfectly.  HIGHLY recommended for anyone like me who loves asparagus but never considered it for a main dish (we've been trying to cut down on the meats).

mmmmm, we made this delicious dish for easter breakfast. i followed the basic recipe idea however used 6 large eggs instead of egg substitute, skipped the fresh parsley & trimmed my asparagus to a length of about 6" (parboiled until al dente) then arranged them on top like spokes in a wheel. excellent results for my first time making a frittata! thanks james!

This was an easy fix which tasted great, as frittatas go. I used green onion instead of white onion because I had some that needed to be used up, but I think this recipe really demands the white onion for texture contrast. Next time, I would probably add some mushrooms for even more flavour. Also, I would boil or steam the asparagus for a little longer than suggested, especially if using larger stalks.

I used some left over asparagus from dinner last night. I substituted 8 large eggs I had on hand since I had to feed 6. Very good results, will make again!

Wow - what a great, healthy recipe! Very nutritious, and excellent for saving some to reheat for a quick nutritous breakfast later in the week. Make 2 (or more). I didn't have an oven proof pan, but I just slid the fritatta out of the pan into a glass bakeware dish.

This recipe turned out wounderful!  I cooked a big brunch for mothers day and didnt have a free stove burner,  so i baked it in the oven.  I used one small container of southwest egg beaters and one plain, but otherwises followed the recipe exactly.  Eggcellent!

Delicious! I was looking for an alternative to the overpriced cafeteria at work and this is it. I can now eat a healthy breakfast and save some money.

This recipe was fantastic. I was hesitant to use egg product as opposed to real eggs, but I liked that it would be healthier to do so. We couldn't tell the difference. I threw in some portabello mushrooms when I saut√©ed the asparagus, too.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It's the first time I have made a frittata. I love how healthy and yet flavorful this recipe is. I can imagine this recipe working out well with different veggies and meats as well. It's a great starting place.

Didn't use the parmesan.  This turned out well though I had to cook it on the stove in my dutch oven which didn't fit in the broiler.  I had to transfer it to a plate, then re-transfer (so the less-cooked side would be next to the fire) to a cake pan.  I used extra vegetables than called for (e.g. mushrooms) then used more egg substitute.  Need the big carton of the egg substitute!

I used all reduced fat mozzarella instead of the cheddar and parmesan.  I also used the southwest style egg substitute to add a little kick.  Great recipe.

I baked mine in a silicone bread pan. Turned out very well. Does not have a strong asparagus flavor, therefore a good sell to those who may not care so much for this veggie. 

Quick and easy. Would recommend using more eggs, however, so the bottom doesn't burn.

Fast and flavorful.  One pan cooking so not much clean up.  I used 4 eggs, 3/4 c aged cheddar, Italian parsley, & sweet onion. Baked at 450 for 2 minutes, highest heat allowed for the pan I was using.

I just made this this morning and loved it!  I wanted to find a breakfast recipe for my asparagus without adding bacon and this one had great reviews.  I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I sprinkled about an ounce of jalapeno havarti on top along with parmesan before putting it under the broiler.  The cheese crust on top absolutely made this dish!  I also skipped the addition of salt because of the saltiness of the cheeses.  My 2 year old was even eating this with the asparagus!

Excellent! Used 8 whole eggs, some fat free half and half and used diced red onion. I also used a 4-cheese blend of shredded cheese in this along with pecorino romano. I use left over roasted asparagus instead of boiling asparagus. Added a little garlic powder and dried basil as well as a little sea salt and pepper. Ate this as a lite dinner and kids ate the rest of breakfast this morning on whole wheat toast.

Wonderful recipe!!! I love asparagus and all the veggies. I added ham, green onions, canned mushrooms and real eggs (6)
I used a deep frying pan for the first part and an 8x8 glass dish for the broiling in the oven as I dont have the needed dishes yet.
My husband was very happy too.
Thanks again :)
