I've made this recipe as is with the fried fish and it is great, but I have also grilled the fish and it has come out even more tasty.  I marinate the fish in lime and a bit of jalapenos to add flavor, and just dust with chili powder and salt before grilling.  They come out moist and tasty, and best of all healthier!  I also suggest using cabbage slaw mixture instead of just straight cabbage.  It adds color and flavor as well.  The sauce is amazing as is though.  None of the flavors are too overpowering, and it's so tangy on the fish, a perfect combination!

Muy bueno!
* To make it lighter/healthier, double up the lime and jalapeno juice. After you've prepped the chipotle with some of the juice, add some olive oil, and use the rest to marinade the fish. I George Forman'ed the fish, but fry pan or baking/broiling would work too. If you have fast fingers, and you want to make it easier, cut the fillets after frying.
* If your palate is sensitive to spicy, drop the jalapeno. If jalapeno is too sour for you, replace with smaller(!) amount of habanero.
* If you have a vegetable/fruit juicer, it cuts down on the prep time of the lime and jalapeno/habanero.
* Side this with avacado or guac.
* Side this with (easy) beans and rice. Remove 1/3 cup of water before boiling. When adding brown rice, throw in a can of black beans. Do this before cooking the fish, since brown rice takes about 25-30 minutes to soak up the water. Some people subtract more water and also throw in a can of stewed tomatoes. I like to add garlic powder.
* Heat up the corn tortillas before serving. If you don't have a tortilla warmer, then make sure you fold in half before they cool.
* Capers are just a garnish, don't worry if you can't find any.
* If you are opposed to beer, use ginger ale.
* If you don't have cod, any white fish will do. Some people have had success with salmon.
* If cutting cabbage is a pain for you, use a package of mix and serve cole slaw, tossing the cole slaw packet.
* Add cilantro and/or pink onion as a garnish or into the cabbage.

5 stars is not high enough for this recipe. I give it 100 stars!! Yum, Yum Yummy! I cannot believe how delicious the beer batter was. It's such a simple recipe, but it's so light and crispy and scrumptious. The white sauce was very, very good...hmm, I'm sorry, I meant to say excellent! I used sourcream instead of yogart. I was leery of the capers..because I don't like them, so I minced the heck out of them so they would just kinda get lost in the sauce and provide flavor. I used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper, because that would be just too hot for my kids, and it had plenty of kick, and my kids still complained. I made a double batch of the white sauce, and I am so glad I did, because we lapped up just about ever bit I made. I also made up some fresh Pico De Gallo..it's simple to make and you can find that recipe everywhere on line. It added such a freshness to this meal. It was nice to make something for dinner tonight that I didn't open a jar or some pre made thing. I prepared everthing from scratch except for the corn tortillas. I used the corn tortillas and soft fried them..they were perfect. OH MY GOD, I can't wait to make these again. Be sure to make the sauce ahead of time so it will have time for all those ingredients to blend. I gave it 8 hours, but at least 2 would be sufficient.Try this recipe, it is worth the time and effort, and the batter would be terrific in many other types of things to fry.

This was a great fast and easy recipe to make for dinner. I substituted light sour cream for the yogurt and used light mayo. As some reviewers suggested, I used fresh, minced cilantro instead of oregano and fresh minced dill.  Instead of frying, I coated the cod w/ olive oil, lime, s&p and grilled it.  Right before I took the fish off the grill, I put the corn tortillas directly on the grill and only slightly toasted them on each side.  This definitely cuts any frying to make this a more diet friendly recipe. Great for casual outdoor dining.

Awesome. I made this mostly for the sauce, I did not fry the fish- just cooked in a pan with a splash of olive oil. Sauce was great, used low fat yogurt and mayo, cut the seeds and membrane out of half the pepper, but not the other. It was spicy, but that's ok, because all the flavors came through. I only used maybe a teaspoon of sauce on each taco and it was very good. Also made some guac and put on the tacos. Good stuff.

What made these tacos amazing was the white sauce. I was sceptical upon reading the ingredients, but it was awesome. The contrast in textures also made this a perfect meal.  the crunchy battered fish with the soft tortillas and the cooling sauce...a masterpiece on the tongue.  Do not forget to serve this with a cold beer.
Also, my only criticism of this recipe was that the batter lacked "punch".  We added a few dashes of salt to the fish immediately after being taken out of the fryer, it made a huge difference.  We also served the tacos w/ a homemade salsa which was good, but probably not essential. 
Overall, this is a rockin' taco...I'll definitley make these again.

I love this recipe !! If I don't have time to batter the fish I buy the frozen battered fish, bake it, and cut it up onto the corn tortillas. Quick and easy if your in a rush.

Tell your friends, tell your neighbors . . . have them over for dinner,  this stuff is YUMMO!!! I think this may very well be my favorite recipe that I have gotten from this site.  I did salt the fish after frying.  My modifications to the sauce:  I used nonfat yogurt, light mayo, pickled jalepeno, subbed mexican oregano, added some ancho powder . . . we couldn't get enough! The sauce is an important component - the ingredients may sound a bit odd to some but it  works to a T.  Can't wait to have it again!

Good recipe, trick with batter is do not whisk too hard.  You must not break up the bubbles from the beer, otherwise the will become too bready and not puff up.  Also, sauce needs a little salt.

Wow! The sauce for these was AWESOME!!! I cheated a little and used pre-breaded frozen fish. I also traded some of the cayenne pepper for Old Bay seasoning, and I used a lemon instead of a lime. Oh, and I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt. But I loved these! They were soooooo good! I wanted to try them with the actual fish recipe next! Yum, yum, yum!

The best!!!  I do not fry the fish I first dredge the fish in an egg and milk mixture then in panko crumbs and baked at 350 degrees.  The sauce, what can I say AWESOME!!!!!! I do not use a jalapeno and a sprinkle of red pepper.  I also add a few extra capers not minced.  thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

I made the fish my own way - breaded with flour and cornmeal and broiled four minutes each side (used Tilapia). I made a double recipe of the sauce (nixed the cumin but only because I didn't have any) and mixed about half of it with a bag of shredded coleslaw blend (no regular coleslaw sauce of course). I put the rest of the sauce in a bowl incase anyone wanted more. I was a little skeptical about the sauce because I didn't really like it straight from the bowl as I was making it (did use sour cream not yogurt). But once I put it on the taco with the fish and the cabbage blend - wow! It was really good! Gave the tacos a great fresh taste. We also added slices of avocado. I forgot to put it out but next time we plan to sprinkle some cilantro on top of it also. Yum! Thanks for a great sauce! UPDATE - I added some fresh cilantro to the next tacos and some very thinly sliced onions as well - wow. Even better flavor...

5+ stars.  We Loved this.  Use tilipia thats all I had; did not have yogurt so used sour cream; used dried cilrentro instead of oregano; and milk instead of beer.  DELICIOUS, YUMMY, Wonderful, Great, -  all describes how this was.    Added tomatoes; avacados; onions on top.   Will for sure make again.

I lived in San Diego too and Fish Tacos are one of my favorite.  I took my boyfriend on vacation there and got him hooked to.  THis is the BEST FISH TACO RECIPE that I can find!  Taste just like the ones I used to get from the little taco stand.  YOu will love these, if you do not have time to batter the fish you can use frozen pre-battered fish.  I like Gordans x-tra crispy.  You must use a white fish to get the right taste, the sauce is what makes the taco and this one is the BEST ON THE WEB!!!!!!

Just ok. I made it mainly for the sauce. A Bit disappointed. Although the Ideal of fish, a cream sauce and cabbage is good together. I think just plain tarter sauce would be good, with all the fixings.

We love fish tacos but they are REALLY REALLY good when put in a crispy corn taco shell! An alternative to frying fish is to chop it into chunks and sprinkle with salt, cumin, and a bit of butter, toss and bake it on a cookie sheet at 400 until done. About 10 minutes or so.

This was fantastic! By far one of my favorite recipes from this site, and one of the only ones I've never "tweaked". Per another member's suggestion, the first time I made it I used Mahi Mahi, which was wonderful. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written. The fresh lime really made all the difference. And although somewhat time consuming, it wasn't so difficult that I won't make it again and again. The beer batter recipe was a great one and even if you don't want to make tacos, it's great for just making fish and chips, too. I made this again, trying to be healthy and just used grilled fish, nonfat yogurt and light mayo, and instead of cabbage I used "broccoli slaw" which looks like coleslaw and comes already cut up and pre-packaged. Even this way, it was GREAT! I don't think you can go wrong with this sauce no matter how you make your tacos.

My husband visited San Diego several years ago and he's been talking about fish tacos ever since!  This recipe was the closest thing we've found to what he remembers.  A note, though: After a few batches, he substituted half of the mayo with Miracle whip salad dressing and the other half with cole slaw dressing.  The sauce was delicious.  Thanks for what has become my favorite meal!

Really, really GOOD!!! I marinated my fish in the juice of one lime, chopped cilantro, and olive oil and then just cooked it on top of the stove. I just warmed my tortillas in a dry skillet. I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was plenty spicy for us. The sauce is very good though! Will definitely be making again.

This was very good, especially the white sauce!  I think next time I will try to grill the fish to make it healthier, but the sauce was perfection!  I loved it with the cabbage as well.  I just used small flour tortillas and had soft tacos instead!

Thankyou for taking me home to San Diego! I've missed Rubio's Fish Tacos so much. Being a mom with not much time on my hands, I skipped the battering part and instead soaked pre-battered fish fillets in beer and then crisped them in the oven. In my opinion, it turned out just like Rubio's. The sauce was WAY too spicy for me. To mend the sauce to my taste buds, I tripled everything except the cayenne and jalapenos. I decided to freeze the extra into single serving freezer containers to save me time in the future. I'll give you 5 stars because you've met my craving. This was the closest to Rubios I've found since moving away from SD 5 years ago. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  I lived in San Diego for a year and used to frequent Rubio's, "home of the fish taco".  We loved the taco's and this is about as close as you can get to the real thing.  The only thing that I omitted was the capers in the white sauce, they probably would've been fine, I am just not a big fan of them.  Thanks Tanya for a taste of my past!!

EASY recipe for a quick dinner. I also used frozen breaded fish and my family gobbled these up, even my picky 14 year old.  I recommend doubling the sauce because there wasn't enough!

This was absolutely fantastic!  I added some season salt to leftover batter and made onion rings to go with the tacos... yummy!  I used tomato and lettuce instead of cabbage, and it was yummy too :)  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!!

Excellent - the other reviews were right!  It's the sauce that makes this so awesome. No matter how you cook your fish, just make sure to make this sauce. I had some leftover and used it as a dip for tortilla chips.

I only made the sauce for the tacos, but there was way to much cayenne pepper.  Too spicy and I love spicy!  My son could barely choke it down.  Very disappointed!  I was so excited to make this because of the excellent reviews.   Wont make again.

We live in San Diego and eat a lot of fish tacos at Rubios or down in Baja.  We tried this recipe with freshy caught fish and were extremely happy with the results.  My husband wants to make this for the guys at his fire station so it is THAT GOOD!  The batter and sauce are key and make the recipe.

This recipe was flawless. The absolute best recipe I've tried on this site and I've been on here for years! I used Bud Lime for the beer batter. I also added lemon pepper to flour to dust the tilapia in before dipping in the beer batter. For the sauce, I did not have capers so I minced 1 tbsp of green olives. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I used 1 tbsp dill pickle juice instead of dill weed. I also cut the cayenne to half of a teaspoon. It still had a lovely kick, but was not overpowering. I mixed the sauce with a prepackaged undressed coleslaw of cabbage and carrots. I put fish and coleslaw on corn tortillas garnished with a little cilantro. I served the fish tacos with homemade mango salsa and tortilla chips and black beans. My family went nuts over it. Will definitely be making this many, many times. Thanks for a great recipe! It was just like eating a phenomenal fish taco at the beach!

Mexican sour cream (added to the mayo & lime) is a lot better tasting and more authentic than yogurt. Also, be warned that buying substitutions for this recipe yield badly tasting results. Use quality beer (preferably Mexican) and lime. No lemon, as it will cause the sauce to taste quite different. To save oil, I used a smaller sauce pot for the deep fry and to cut calories, I steamed the tortillas in the microwave rather than fried. Make a homemade salsa of cilantro, red onions, Lowry's garlic pepper, and fresh tomatoes for added flavor and health.  =)

We really like fish tacos and thought these were great.  I added 1/4 tsp black pepper to the batter and had to add a little more beer as it was a little too thick.  The batter made enough for 2 lbs. of fish cut into strips to get more crispy edges.  I warmed the tortillas in the oven instead of frying and pan-fried the fish in just a couple of tablespoons of oil at a time...way less than the specified amount of a full quart.  The batter provides a crispness and doesn't have a lot of flavor, but that is what the spicy sauce in this recipe is for.  I thought the sauce was very good, but I would add some cilantro next time as it had more of a herby-spicy flavor as written (from the dill & oregano).

OMG! Thank You Thank You Thank You! I moved to Wisconsin 12 years ago and have missed Rubio's ever since. This is a darn close interpretation of the original. Now...if only I could figure out a way to find the ocean sand to wiggle my toes in while I eat them! YUM!

Very good!  I used halibut instead and sour cream in the sauce instead of yogurt.  It turned out great but I will try the yogurt next time just to see what it's like.  I definately recommend making the sauce a day ahead to let the flavors combine, it was even better the next day.  I made so much halibut that we had leftovers.  I heated the pieces of fish up in the oven the next day and they were crispy and not greasy at all.  I will definately be making this again soon!

Yum Yum this was great!  I added some onion powder and garlic powder to the batter and used a little more salt than called for.  Used extra cayenne in the sauce but I am a fan of spicy food.  These were really good! 

I just tried this using the Maple Salmon recipe from this site as the fish (not breaded).  It was delicious. 

Everyone especially loves the sauce.  Make sure you heat the corn tortillas up well.  Everyone especially loves it with the Maple Salmon.

This is the meal that my daughter requests when she is home from University.  The sauce is spectacular.  I have made it with the original recipe but I have also tried grilled tilapia (with mango/pepper salsa from this site) and when in a pinch i have even use high liner beer battered chicken (gasp).  The mango salsa does NOT go on the taco but it is quite nice as a side.  The only change I make is to lightly grill the tortillas so they are still pliable.  Savoy cabbage works best.  I chop up vidalia onions and soak them in vinegar and salt for those that want it.

An excellent sauce recipe!!  I did not make the batter however because I am not a fan of battered fish.  I used mahi-mahi that was diced up into bite sized pieces.  Then I pan fried my fish in light olive oil and some sesame oil, sprinkled the fish with some sea salt and minced garlic.  This and the sauce on this recipe made for many requests for seconds  :)

**Review is just for the beer batter
This was absolutely delicious!  Great consistency, stayed on the Tilapia during cooking and had a fantastic crunch!  I cooked my fish in a large skillet with about 1/3 cup of oil and they were perfect. (We used Harpoon Celtic Ale in the batter, its all we had in the house).  Ate our tacos with homemade coleslaw, and a little shredded cheese in whole wheat tortillas topped with fresh lime juice.  Outstanding, felt like we should have been eating them on a beach instead of a chilly March night!  Thanks

Wow!  These are excellent tacos!!  I made these with red snapper instead of cod and I think any firm fish would work well.  I had to make a couple changes to the sauce based on what I had on hand (sour cream instead of yogurt, a serrano chile instead of a jalapeno, and omitted the capers), but it was still so good I could practically eat it with a spoon.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half to make sure it wouldn't be too spicy.  My daughters and I stuffed ourselves and we still have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  These will definitely be in our regular rotation from now on!

This was outstanding!! I love the fish tacos at Trudy's in Austin, and these taste very similar. 

I made a few modifications: 
I couldn't find Cod, so I used frozen Tilapia. 
Instead of the beer batter, I dredged the fish in egg and then in seasoned flour (I initially made the beer batter, but it tasted gross. May have been the beer i used). 
I substituted vanilla yogurt for the plain and omitted the capers because I don't care for them.   
I served with flour tortillas and red cabbage, and of course a cold Shiner Bock.  

I really love this sauce and I think I can use it for more dishes.

It was fabulous! Thanks for sharing!

I'm from San Diego too and although this is NOT a Rubio's fish taco, IT IS A VERY TASTY alternative!!! I thought was little on the spicy/hot side for me so I think next time I'll leave out the chopped jalepeno.  It's the closest thing to being there...thank you....

This is a great recipe.  I used a little extra cayenne pepper, and doubled the jalapeno for extra kick.  I also used sour cream for extra richness, and a tortilla pan to heat, but not fry, the corn tortillas.  I was actually looking for a recipe for shrimp tacos, but was unsuccessful at finding one, so I used this recipe with jumbo breaded shrimp, which I oven baked, and cut in half, and the results were awesome!  A very, very good recipe, and I'll be making this again soon, Thank you!

These tacos are amazing!!  I cut the cooking time done to 20 minutes by using a high quality breaded, frozen halibut.  These take 20 minutes to bake and I used one filet for two tacos. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I did not add jalapeno peppers or capers or dill but I did add cilantro, garlic salt, and chili powder.  Then on the finished taco I squeezed fresh lime.  AWESOME!!!  THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

Used the recipe as a base, but broiled the tilapia.  I thought this was fantastic and extremely quick to make (start to finish only 20 min)!  I did modify quite a bit based on my personal tastes and what I had on hand. 
Sauce: I did not have any limes, so I used lemons and sauce tasted great.  I did not use capers (not a fan) and did not have any jalapeno peppers, so skipped those as well. I used plain greek yogurt and light mayo and it turned out delicious.  It definitely had a little kick to it, even without the jalapenos. 
Fish: melted a TBSP of butter and brushed both sides of the fish, sprinkled with Hawaiian salt and pepper.  Placed on baking sheet with non stick tin foil and then broiled for ~ 9 minutes: 3 min. on one side, flipped them and broiled for another 3 min., then took the sauce and brushed it on the top side of the fish and broiled for another 2-3 min. Placed the fish inside heated soft taco shells, spooned the sauce over and enjoyed. SO GOOD!!!! I could eat that every night.  Can't wait to experiement with various toppings: corn, black beans, cilantro, cabbage, etc.  
As a side note, I think the sauce would be great on any fish and even the toppings.  Thanks for the recipe!

Both husband and 8 year old like this batter.  I added lime rind to the batter.  The sauce is easy to modify to your own taste.  I would make this again.

These were delicious. I'd rather eat this than go to a restaurant, and they were fun to make. I found I was out of cumin for the white sauce, so I skipped it and it was still great. Forgot to dredge the fish in flour before frying, and it made no difference. Subbed lettuce for the cabbage. Really delicious recipe, and though I thought it would be time consuming it really took no more work than when I usually make fried fish. The beer batter recipe here isn't the best out there, but it works just fine for the dish. If you want a top-notch beer batter, try the "Beer Batter for Fish" recipe for this site, which includes some more seasoning. But, for how fast and easy the beer batter here was, it works fine.

I lived in San Diego for 17 yrs. and fish tacos were found everywhere.  Living in Florida now and they arn't as popular here.  Most of my family in Florida had never heard of fish tacos.  I will have to say that this recipe is the best.  The sauce is something to die for.  I did cut back on the jalapeno and cayenne pepper (to my taste).  I added salt & pepper to the flour before dusting the fish.  I didn't change the fish batter at all.  Loved it.  I used flour tortillas and heated them in a salted hot skillet (no oil). I would put these up against any fish taco in San Diego as being one of the best recipes I have tried. Didn't use cod. I caught and cleaned the fish myself which made the recipe more special.  Thank you for the recipe.  It will be used often.

Beer batter is out of this world.  Just like in the restaurants and so amazingly easy to make at home.  The white sauce was great - really fresh tasting.  I've made this many times and only add a few pinches of cumin, garlic salt, paprika and 1 tablespoon dill.  Just adjust to your taste.  If something sounds like it would be too much for you, then decrease or just cut it out.  This is one of our weekeday dinners and it's fast to put together.  Serve with shredded lettuce, red cabbage, cilantro, some chopped tomatoes and you're set.  Just use what ever you have on hand.  Super versatile and has a great fresh taste.

I substituted Tilapia for the Cod. It wasn't quite as "fishy" tasting. I've tried this recipe with both soft flour and hard corn tortillas - both are good.

I live in SoCal and like to fish the local saltwater. One of the species that we get here in the beginning of summer is California Barracuda. A fun fish to catch, but not always so fun to eat, and you really need to eat it the same day you catch it. They're fairly large fish too, so I need to get as many people fed as I can. This is one of the few recipes I've found that does this fish justice and keeps people from asking too many questions about what kind of fish they're eating! Thanks!

I only made the white sauce for these, I prefer to broil my fish for fish tacos. The white sauce is very good for fish tacos, though...I made it exactly as the recipe. Yummy, although it made waaaaay too much for us.

I made this with super firm tofu and added a little kelp flakes to the batter to give it a little "fishy" taste and it was perfect! Being a vegetarian, I'm always trying to convert my pre-veg favorites to suit my current lifestyle and this one worked marvelously. The sauce was great...didn't use the yogurt, just used some Veganaise and the rest of the ingredients. Super!

I'm giving this a 5 based on the sauce.  Great flavor!  However, I grilled my fish instead.

WOW! I was blown away by how delicious these were. I always have high hopes for fish tacos in restaurants and am usually disappointed here on the East coast. These were better than most restaurant versions I've had!  I hate rating after making substiutions--but in this case, I just want to show that even with these, they were still delicious--a) I didn't have any capers, so I left them out; b) Used low-fat mayo, and c) no fryer so just fried in a little veggie oil in a 12- inch pan.  Even with those subs, still amazing! Yum!!!

Tasted really good especially the white sauce. Only used 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper for kidlet's sake. Also, I think I'll decrease all the spices by half for the white sauce next time.

We loved the sauce- great combo of spices! I used Napa cabbage which has a milder flavor and texture similar to iceberg lettuce. I also grilled the fish with sea salt, black pepper and a light sprinkle of garlic powder before grilling. Thanks for this fantastic recipe!!

I would give this recipe 5 stars if it was a habanero instead of jalapeno. It should be one (1) habanero. Try it and you will find fish taco bliss. Also, you don;t really need to fry the fish. It's just as good with baked or broiled fish that's lightly seasoned.

So good!  I grilled the fish instead of frying it and used sour cream instead of mayo but otherwise followed directions.  I also made a Corn Salsa from this site "Fiery Fish Tacos" and served that on top.  We live in the heart of Tex-mex land and this measured up!

WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! This is the best fried fish recipe I've ever seen! For the white sauce, I used sour cream, mayo, lime, fresh dill, cilantro and cayanne pepper. Spicy and YUMMY! we had batter left over, and my husband used it to fry broccoli, carrots and onion rings! The sauce was good with the veggies too! Even the in-laws loved it. Next time, we're just gonna have a fish fry, and not fish tacos. Already put in the favorites box!!

WOW! This recipe is spot on! Made them tonight and have to say they are just about the best Fish Tacos I have ever tasted. I made the sauce exactly as directed expect I only used a half of a jalapeno because my jalepeno was HUGE! I used Wahoo filets instead of cod, which were amazing! The trick to getting the fish perfectly crispy is to make the batter at the last second right before you drop the fish in the fryer so you don't mess with all the wonderful beer bubbles! And then instead of draining the fish on paper towels, set a rack on a cookie sheet and put the cooked fish on the rack to drain while waiting in a warm oven for the rest of the fish to cook. Thank you so much for the recipe! Will definately be making this again, and again, and again! :)

The sauce is out of this world tasty!  We did not fry fish for this and instead grilled on lemon slices with a lemon salt and pepper.  The sauce is very well balanced with a nice heat level.  Perfect on grilled tortillas with a bit of cheese too.  I used fat free yogurt and light sour cream and it was a thick and tasty sauce.  Will definitely make again.

I also cheated and used frozen fillets, but this sauce is fantastic.  We served it with cabbage and fresh pico de gallo.  We'll be making this often.  It's such an easy meal.

Very tasty and quick to make. The recipe did produce about twice as much of the sauce as we needed, so I'd cut that back next time, but otherwise it was very much enjoyed.

Oh Holy Cow...these are fantastic. My husband and I have been searching for the ultimate fish taco recipe since we returned from Puerto Vallarta. These are almost like eating at Joe Jack's Fish Shack.  The sauce is the magic ingredient. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and added some fresh cilantro.  YUMMY!!!!!!! We can't get enough of these tasty treats.

I use allrecipes.com all the time, but I've never written a review before. I had to this time because I think this might have been the most delicious meal I've ever made! I cheated and used frozen battered fish fillets (baked, not fried) and for an even healthier option I used both fat free mayo and fat free yogurt and I promise you it was still amazing! You would not even notice the missing fat because the recipe is so good. The sauce does come out very, very spicy but I love spicy food so it was ok for me. If you are not a fan of super hot foods I would recommend cutting back to 1/2 tsp. on the cayenne and just adding slowly to your taste. Thank you Tanya--this was wonderful!! I will make it again often! PS I think the sauce would even be delicious as a dip, sandwich spread or even salad dressing. It is SO good!

This was delicious and easy to make.  I forgot to add the lime juice to the white sauce, but I used apple cider vinegar. Also, added some guacamole and chile oil to the taco. Can't wait to make it again.

I made these the other day and they were absolutely delicious. The white sauce is sooo good...I made extra and used it as a dip for tortilla chips and as a spread on sandwiches. I also pan cooked my fish instead of fried, and added some avocado on top. Super recipe..thank you for sharing!

These were exactly what I was looking for!  Loved everything about them!  I did serve mine with flour tortillas though. Also, the lovely mass chain grocery store in our area doesn't have fresh fish, and they also didn't have cod, so I just used tilapia.  Came out fine.  My 8 yr old son even loved these!  Served w/ avocado and pico on the side.

Wow! I love fish tacos but never thought I would be able to make them myself.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!  I changed some things due to what I had on hand.  I didn't have dill weed so I used a teaspoon of dill pickle juice.  I omitted the jalapeno and used a mixture of the yogurt, mayo and also sour cream. It was fabulous!  The batter was awesome too! I added some salt after they came out as recommended and it was amazing! When we put the tacos together I used fresh cilantro And fresh homemade pico yum!  We will make this over and over!

Delicious- I sub'ed frozen batter-fried cod instead of making batter.  Made it very easy and was still delicious with the white sauce and cabbage!  Yum yum.

I did not fry my fish but saute it in butter and lime and garlic....the slaw mixture was great for the first run next time I will choose to use all yogurt. Thanks for this recipe my family enjoyed it

This was not bad.  My husband loved the beer batter, it wasn't really my thing.  Also he got to buy beer so that made him happy.  The sauce was good.  I was a little confused how cabbage would add anything so I shredded half-and-half leaf lettuce and cilantro and used that instead.  Cilantro went with the taco and sauce nicely.

I am on weight watchers. I sprinkled lime juice, green tabasco, and cumin on the fish and baked it @450 for 10-15 min.   I used fat free mayo and fat free yogurt in the sauce. Flavors are still there and it cuts way back on the calories. Delicious!!!

Having eaten fish tacos at a beach restaurant in San Diego, I have been searching for a recipe like them. This is as close as you get, especially if you use grilled fish. The sauce is EXCELLENT, and totally makes the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used sour cream in lieu of the yogurt in the white sauce since I usually watch my carb intake.  Also I make a relish out of corn, chopped red peppers and red onion.  It's to die for.  Even my kids like this recipe.  These tacos are almost just as good if you saute the fish instead of deep frying it.    One more thing, if you have a mexican market around you, buy your corn tortillas from there....they are far superior to the supermarket ones.

Very good.  This does have a bit of a bite and next time I'll cut the cayenne pepper in half.  You will have A LOT of batter left over.  Next time I will cut the sauce in half for our family of 4.  I will also try cilantro next time. I used large flour tortillas and I think it would have been better with smaller corn tortillas.  I agree with everyone who said the fried fish lacked flavor...I would salt & pepper before battering.  I did look up a beer batter recipe on allrecipes and they included 1 tsp of garlic powder & 1/2 tsp of blk pepper...I wonder if that would do the trick.  I used a wok with oil for frying (it does splatter quite a bit though)...med-high heat for about 5 mins.  It was a total of about 15 min cook time. Overall the sauce was very flavorful.  I used a cheap beer, but my hubby claims the cheaper beers cook a better flavor.

These are yummy! I will say, I floured, egged, and breaded the fish then put it in the oven at 400 for 6 minutes on each side. Resulted in crispy delicious fish that were healthier than fried ones. Yum!

My husband, 4 yr old and 2 yr old LOVED these! They all had seconds and for my 4 year old that is unheard of.I didn't get to try it, I'm on a diet so I can't have half of the stuff in these, but as soon as I'm off I'm going to try them, and I'm just starting to like fish, so we shall see. I also am going to try a grilled version of them just to save on the calories and fat. Great Recipe!

The sauce was delicious but please refrigerate for a few hours before serving. When I first made the sauce and tasted it had a weird taste, but after I let it sit in the fridge overnight it was delicious. I did not like the fish, It was way too doughy and had an egg taste to it. Next time I will just used grilled fish. ENJOY!!!

A bit messy and time consuming.  I wish I would have grilled my fish instead of frying, but wanted to try this as written.  I am in the minority on the sauce, I think.  It wasn't my favorite - it was a bit too thick for my taste and even though I used a bit less dill, it seems all I tasted was dill.  Almost like a glorifed tartar sauce.  I've had tons of SD fish tacos - both fried and blackened - and this didn't really remind me of my favorites.  Also, the batter is quite bland.  I took the advice of another reviewer and seasoned my fish before batter and used a couple shakes of seasoned salt when the fish was done cooking.  Overall; it was just too bland, greasy and tartar-y for me.  I doubt I'll try this one again, sorry.

For your white sauce, try mixing equal parts yogurt and sour cream with horseradish to taste.

Fantastic recipe. The batter was nice and light. I used Mahi mahi. Also added a mix of Cilantro tomatoes, green onion, and avacados on top, and the tortillas were fresh tortillas made with spices and jalapenos which added an extra kick.

The best  of  many I have tried of this site and other sites as well.
 My son insisted on our visit that we try the fish taco's at Michae'ls on Main in Soquel CA.
 They have been the measure that have found all the others lacking. This is close and very tasty--I did include some shrimp with the tilapia fish fillets as an experiment. The fish was awesome and the shrimp was better. Great white sauce-- Thanks for bringing a great California recipe to Colorado!

This review is only for the sauce. (I grilled my fish) I found this sauce to be gritty from the spices. I really think this should be made at least 24 hours ahead of time to soften the dry spices and blend the flavors. Or maybe it would help to allow the spices to macerate in the lime juice for a couple hours first. I also did not care for the crunchy jalapenos.  I would prefer the softer pickled jalapenos (which would compliment the capers as well). While trying to fix this to suit our tastes, I added a drizzle of honey, salt and pepper, and a little minced pickle. Then I added a LOT of minced pickle. It began to taste a lot like tartar sauce so I quit tweaking around with it. The sauce was edible and did not ruin our meal, but I won't make this again as written.

More like TEN stars!!! Holy  (which is a odd saying lol *shrug) these were BANGIN delicious! I can't praise them enough. Ppl couldn't stop eating them and all said this was better than any restaurant. I seasoned the flour mixture with chili powder, a bit of Adobo and S&P- PERFECT for me, but my son said it was a little on the bland side (he ate the fish plain and not with all the taco fixings). I left out the capers and subbed cilantro for the oregano. Used a dark lager beer (amber brock). And served with pico de gallo. I made the white sauce and pico de gallo that morning so the flavors could marinate all day. Served with brown rice and black beans (for which I sauteed minced garlic and a little onion first, used Adobo chicken broth instead of water for rice, subtracted about a third cup liquid and replaced with a can of drained black beans...so good). Will reheat the fish under the broiler for yummy leftovers today-can't wait! I could eat these things for breakfast lol. So good.

These were so good. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I added 1 tsp. of honey to the white sauce only because I knew it was a bit tangy for my family. I loved it just as it was. Anyway, I will make these again and again. I had a lot of white sauce left so not wanting to waste it, I used it the next night for a coleslaw dressing by adding just a bit of rice wine vinegar. OMG! Delicious. I also got to use the rest of the cabbage. Please try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

This is a great recipe! Love the beer batter, love the white sauce.  I just used the cole slaw mix in a bag. Homemade, easy and yummy.  Keeper for sure. Thanks!

12/11: didn't have beer, used club soda and it was very good.  everyone liked it. the sauce was excellent, didn't have capers and used a less cayenne.  also iceberg lettuce instead of cabbage.  def. fry up the tortillas lightly.  if frying in batches, cool on a rack or they get soggy.
8/14 very good.  i used 3 pieces of cod for the 3 of us. halved everything. mixed the sauce with some cole slaw blend and left a little on the side for topping.

absolutely delicious!!! I made 1 change, I didn't want to deep fry the fish (too much fat) so I used just enough oil to cover the fish, sprinkled salt and pepper and broiled it 6 minutes on each side at about 4 inches from the broiler. It was to die for !My husband said they taste amazing, which is a lot from a guy who is picky with his fish.

Okay, I've used this batter for any "beer batter" meal I make - it is perfect, do not change a thing!  However, I did make these as fish tacos, but grilled - using the marinade from the "Grilled Fish Tacos w/ Chipotle Lime Dressing"... I didn't find that the sauce really stood out.  I will re-try it with the fried fish and see if that makes a difference.  Regardless, very tasty.

I took the suggestion of another user and grilled the fish instead.  As they suggested, I marinated the fish in lime juice and sliced fresh jalapenos.  I then sprinkled the fillets with chili powder before grilling.  These were great!  My husband and I HIGHLY enjoyed these!

These where great. Although I didn't fry the fish, cooked in the oven. Let me tell you the sauce is fantatic. Even my granddaugther who doesn't like fish ate this up. Will make again.

I made exactly as directed except I used fresh dill (it was less expensive)... The beer I used was Samuel Adams IPA and I seasoned the flour that I dipped the fish in with some Shillings San Francisco Seafood Seasoning... all that combined... these are better than the fish & chips place down the street!  So we ate some fish & chip style with malt vinegar and the rest as tacos, delicious either way! The sauce is great, wow!!

I'll start with this - I don't really LIKE fish...but DH does so I made these. They were absolutely wonderful and I think even non-fish lovers like me would go for it!  The batter was amazing. I used tilapia as that was what I had....i think any mild white fish would work.  Thanks so much - this is definitely a KEEPER.

Totally YUMMY!!  We grilled the fish with some chili powder, lemon pepper, and lime juice, omited the capers and jalapeno from the white sauce, and used cole slaw in place of regular cabbage.  Everyone loved it!

I have made this as directed and with grilled cod (trying to eat healthier) and must say that it is great either way! We prefer grilled with a little lemon pepper in our grill basket :) The sauce is over the top good!!! Fantastic with fresh pico and guacamole!! Thanks Breeze823!

This was my first time eating a fish taco.  My husband has told me stories of the delicious fish tacos he's eaten in Mexico so I wanted to make some and see if they could compare.  We followed the recipe exactly.  They were outstanding!  The white sauce was the best part.  I wouldn't change anything.  We'll be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

It was pretty good, very heavy - fairly good beer batter. I used shredded carrot instead of cabbage & used flour tortillas. I would make this again with the changes I made.

I only used this recipe for the white sauce so that is what is getting my 5 stars.  Yummy!  (I used with frozen fish fillets and a coleslaw mixture from a different recipe - toss together 2 cups coleslaw mix, 2 tsp olive oil, 1 Tbsp lime juice, 2 chopped green onions, 1/3 c chopped cilantro and salt & pepper to taste).

I loved the sauce, I could eat it by itself! I think next time I will just use lettuce though, not much of a cabbage fan.

The sauce was wonderful. I replaced the jalapeno for green chilies.  Baked the fish instead of frying and used coleslaw in place of a head of cabbage. It is already on our dinner menu for next week.

We LOVED this recipe. I used Mahi Mahi, because it was what I had on hand, and I purchased some fresh pico de gallo at the local latin market. It was even better than the fish tacos at my local mexican food restaurants!!

This was so good my husband was licking the bowl with the sauce in it. I did change just a few things based on what others said I used sour cream instead of yogurt and I didn't have any slaw or anything to make it with so we used lettuce and tomatoes. This was a great dish my husband just kept saying how much he liked it and the sauce was the big win. Thanks for posting this

These were very good! Definitely needs the sauce which is delicious)as the battered/fried fish alone was pretty basic. Only change I made was to add a little cilantro to the sauce as I have a ton I need to use up. Will make again.

My husband and I are from southern California but are now living in DC. There are 3 things we love but can't get out here; In-N-Out, Claim Jumper, and my husbands favorite Rubios Fish Tacos. I surprised my husband last night with these and he absolutely loved them. We both thought they were just as good if not better than Rubios. This is now his favorite meal and asked to have them again next week. Thank you for such an awesome recipe.
I should note that I switched out the yogurt for sour cream since that's what I had.  DELICIOUS!

This is good!! I love fish tacos from tasting them the first time with my sis in California..so glad I made this. I love to cook with Flavor..so I felt that the flour mixture should have had some spices to bring out more of the flavors in the fish....I added a bit of hot pepper with ground veggie flakes & bit of cumin, lemon zest. Oh....sooo delish!! I didnt have capers, so omitted but sauce was divine!! Loved this and will make again!!

Grilled Mahi Mahi for 3 mins. Then covered lightly with oil, salt, lemon juice,lemon pepper seasoning, Mrs. dash grill seasoning and roasted chipotle powder. I placed Mahi Mahi in the oven at 400 in foil with lemon juice till 145 degree inside fish.    For Mayo mix  I made it to taste. I didnt have jalapenos so I used Tapatio to taste. I skipped the cappers. I also used lime juice in it. My husband said he would for sure like to enjoy it again.! Sorry kinda sort just trying to get it all down before I forget.

The fish tacos were a hit with my family. I marinaded the cod fillets in lime juice and a little bit of salt before hand. The sauce was delicious and went well with the recipe. We also used pico de gallo, I would make this recipe again.

I also grew up in San Diego and the first of that amazing SD fish taco chain opened up next to my high school in 1983. I always hit them up first when I return and although they have a few franchises in San Francisco they are not nearly as good. Well this recipe more than satisfies my craving and man are these tacos great.   I made the recipe as described but used light Greek yogurt and light Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I also added 1/2 Tsp of Caper juice and the sauce was out of this world. I used cooking spray to lightly fry the tortillas and it just doesn't taste as good as oil. I also put a bit of Jack cheese in between the lightly fried and warmed tortillas. I topped the tacos with cilantro the white sauce and a bit of fresh Tomatillo Salsa.  With the fish I suggest making the fish pieces smaller, say 1 1/3 to 1 1/2 oz to better fit the tortilla (thick and more narrow so there is still room for cabbage, guac and salsa). For leftovers put the fish in the toaster oven to get that amazing crisp and fresh texture back.

Homerun! That sauce has been dubbed "World's Best Sauce" in this house. We make it to go with rotisserie chicken too. Outstanding! Even the kids tear this dish up! I'm usually pressed for time and cheat by using Costco's panko crusted tilapia.

Thank you so much for this recipe. We pan-fried the cod in some olive oil. Served with corn tortillas, pico de gallo, cole slaw mix and guacamole. Delicious and a nice change for dinner!

These are off the charts delicious!!!  I have made them following the recipe exactly and they are to die for.  I've also cheated when pressed for time and used fish sticks instead of making the fish as the recipe directs and they are still delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing!

My favorite sauce for fish tacos though I prefer to cook the fish with a little spicy seasoning on an indoor grill rather than beer batter it.  Delicious either way I am sure.  Try this, it is great.

Wonderful!!! The perfect recipe for leftover breaded walleye. I added some shredded cabbage to the dressing and made a few subs to accomodate what I had on hand. Lemon juice instead of lime and extra cayenne for the jalapeno. Served with yellow rice. This would be terrific with a black bean, corn, and avocado salad as  a side. Next time I will shred carrots into the slaw for added color. The oregano/dill/caper combo was phenomenal.

I too am from the San Diego area, these aren't quiet like Rubio's but pretty close.  The sauce truely makes these tacos.  I doubled the sauce simply because my family really likes to slather fish tacos in the sauce.  I grilled fresh Halibut and still came out really tasty.  I even tried them with flour tortillas.

Holy Gawd is this fabulous!!!!! I have made it several times now, and depending on what I have to hand, it comes out a little differently each time....and ALWAYS wonderful! The sauce is what makes this a 5 star recipe. I use a pre-shredded cole slaw mix, which saves time and adds even more flavor. I have added fresh corn kernels shaved from the cob in this and found it was soooo good! The last timeI made this recipe, I did not bread the fish, just fried it in a bit of coconut oil...husband and I both agreed that it was just as yummy...saves calories and carbs too! Also, I used flour tortillas, which we prefer with this recipe. The pico de gallo and limes are a great addition. I could eat this every day!

When I made this, I had never had a fish taco in my life, so I had nothing to compare it to, but I gotta say YUMM!! My husband who doesn't like fish loved these, especially the sauce and beer batter. After making it a few times, I've come up with a way we like it best. I've always used tilapia, because that's what I always have on hand. I sprinkle a little seasoning salt on the battered fish right after it comes out of the oil. I didn't have capers the first time I made it, and we loved it, so I've never used them. I usually add more jalapeno and cayenne (depending on who's eating), double the cumin and dill weed, I add bay seasoning, and I put a few cloves of garlic in the sauce. Sour cream is interchangeable with yogurt, I use whatever I have on hand. Pico de gallo is a must for us. I make it from a recipe on this site. I've tried flour tortillas and fried corn tortillas and the fried corn tortillas win every time. I have enjoyed it with flour tortillas and grilled fish (for healthiness) and I like it, but my husband and I far prefer the whole fried deal. A+

I used a different batter to on the fish and I used mahi mahi instead of the cod fillets because that is what I had on hand but these turned out great! I used a different batter because I'm into cooking healthy and didn't want to fry the fish. The sauce that is part of the recipe is a must have with these tacos! I made it a few hours ahead to the flavors could combine and was amazed at how much it added to the dish. Thanks for the recipe it was a great change of pace to the week night dinner.

I never even tried fish tacos until I just dove in and tried this recipe.  I was floored.  We don't even eat regular tacos anymore, this is the only way to go.  I have since tried fish tacos in a few different restaurants and they don't even come close to this recipe.  I will use sour cream instead of plain yogurt if I have to and I double the jalapeno because we like it hot!

My first time having fish tacos and we really enjoyed them. The sauce I would say 5 stars, the fish 3 - so I split the difference and went 4 overall. LOVE the sauce (made as stated) but the fish seemed a little bland somehow.... Maybe needs a good squeeze of lemon or lime and a bit of salt right out of the fyer? Overall will definitely make the sauce again and tinker with the fish. Thank you!

This recipe is the BOMB! I ran out, Everyone wanted more. When I was reading the recipe, I noticed the batter did not call for any pepper? So... I put 1/4 tsp ground black pepper in the mix.  The white sauce was excellent!  This recipe will go on my menu!  Thanks!

I make this recipe for my family on Friday night family nights at least 4-5 times per year.  The sauce really makes this recipe.  Be careful not to add too much chili powder or you will overpower it!  I usually modify the batter by adding old bay and tabasco to give the fish alittle kick of its own.  I buy tilapia fillets from Sam's club and figure 1 fillet diced up to cover 1 person worth of tacos.  Thanks so much for posting it has become a family staple here!

Not a big fan of deep-fry, but I have to say, this was superb.  I have made it a few times. In a hurry, or don't feel like frying?  One time I used frozen crispy fish sticks.  Not as good as the original, obviously, but still really good.

Great recipe! I made the whole recipe as indicated, but since we are only three in my house, I ended up with left over fish which I warmed up in the oven the next day and served over cabbage topped with the sauce and with a side of Spanish rice, and it was as delicious as before, and a variation from the tacos. I did not fry the tortillas, instead I just warmed them up and made soft tacos which my two guys just loved (and my husband does NOT like fryed food!) This is a keeper! thank you for the recipe!.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used blackened Talipia instead and it turned out great. The only thing I did different was added cilantro. I will be making this again.

I'm from San Diego too and no longer live there - these are wonderful and do taste like home.  I've been trying to find a recipe similar to fish tacos down there and this is it!  Deep frying can be a pain - my deep fryer was small so I had to do several batches of fish, which precluded eating dinner as a family since I had to man the fryer.

The only change I made was to only add 1/2 tsp cayenne and 1/2 jalapeno pepper to the white sauce, since I thought it would be too spicy otherwise.  It was perfect.  I served it with pico de gallo (from the Black Beans and Pico de Gallo recipe from this site).  Delicious.

Wow, this recipe is outstanding. I have never deep-fried so I was a bit little nervous. It was very easy and the fish turned out perfectly fried, almost like it came from a fish n' chips place! I bought a liquid (candy/deep fry) thermometer and kept it in the deep pot I  used with 2 pints of vegetable oil. The temperature fluctuated a lot but this was to be expected (it went between 350-400). Making the beer batter was quick and easy and after a few minutes in the hot grease the fish (I used fresh grouper) was golden, crisp and yummy.  
The sauce was also outstanding. I had to use chili powder instead of cayenne pepper because I didn't have any. It was still good although I'm sure it changed the flavor from the original recipe. 
I served the tacos with lettuce and toms because my grocery store didn't have any cabbage! 
Also, I think that frying the tortillas is unnecessary and too greasy. I think it would be better to heat them in the microwave.
It was delicious and my family was impressed and loved it.

Excellent recipe.  I used tilapia instead of cod, as I feel it has a better flavor.  This is the best fish taco recipe I've ever tried.  It was a big hit with everyone at my dinner table.  Highly, highly recommend it.

I'm really rating the sauce - it's the key ingredient!!! I used pickled jalapenos instead of fresh & it all came out great.  My whole dinner party LOVED the tacos!

my daughter(15 years old) loves fish tacos.  I read the reviews and thought this would be a great one to try.  It did not disappoint.  My husband and daughter love it.  I have made this several times and I do not change a thing. Yum!

Only tried the white sauce part of the recipe - then made the rest of my fish tacos using my recipe.  Must say - an *excellent* fish taco sauce.

Sooooooooo good! I will say though that I cheated and used frozen battered fish from Trader Joes. And for the sauce I omitted the jalapeno, capers, and cayenne becauce I don't like spicy and didn't have any capers, and added some garlic salt. Also I used fajita size flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas, cole slaw mix for the cabbage and added monterey jack cheese. *So good* I'm sure they're even better with the fresh beer battered fish which I'll try very soon, but this was just to make it easier for me. Also, my kids loved it!

These are the best of the best.  Just awesome.  It's the sauce that makes these tacos!  I could drink it with a straw!  Do make it a bit ahead so the flavors can blend.  For ease, I just popped all the sauce ingredients in my magic bullet and let 'er rip.  I didn't want to mess up my kitchen with frying the fish, so I purchased "name brand" frozen beer battered filets that you just bake in the oven.  They turned out so good, that I doubt I'll ever mess with frying from scratch.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These were delicious!  I discovered San Diego fish tacos 8 years ago and have searched for a recipe since then - this is it.  Any mild fish will work - you can always soak the fish in milk beforehand to make sure it isn't too fishy.  Caution, these are addictive!

Our family loves this recipe.  We had extra batter left over the first time we made it, so we sliced a large onion into thick rings and using the same flour/batter combo we made fried onion rings.  We've made this several times.  Tonight, we're making steak and potatoes and wanted onion rings so we're using this recipe - and sauce- for just onion rings.  Delicious.

I've made this twice now. The first time I made it I bought lettuce instead of cabbage, and my husband was dejected! We lived in San Diego for 6 years and this, so he tells me, is very close. But you have to have the cabbage and the sauce! The cayenne is way too much for me, and I didn't put in any jalapenos. I don't like seafood that much but I do like these tacos and will make them again.

Fish tacos are my favorite and we loved these. The sauce was great too. I used chipotles (smoked jalepenos) instead of regular because that was what I had.
Also, because I have no frying experience  I just seasoned the fish, rolled it in flour and cooked it in a few tablespoons of olive oil in my cast iron skillet for 10 minutes or so over medium heat. It came out very crispy on the outside and incredibly moist on the inside. I thought they tasted much better without all the extra starch.

OMG! Like my kids say!  These were sooo good!  Everyone is right, this is an unbelieveable combo.  I too used lite sour cream, but I added a tsp of chopped garlic & a tiny bit of crushed ginger.  I left out the japs due to the kids, and its a good thing I did because my 10 yr old picked up on the smidge of cayenne I put in.  Used super fresh Halibut and Panko bread crumbs after the egg/beer mixture. Oh, but started w/ fish cuts in corn meal, then egg/beer, then panko bread crumbs.  My Safeway just started selling those, and boy! What a difference, and a little big goes a long way.  They were very light and flaky, finished the fish w/ a little salt, lime juice (the other half). Topped them w/ cabbage, cilantro and avocado.  My neighbors were out by their pool so I took a cpl over; and what a hit!  I'm the "chef de la cul-de-sac"!  Thanks for the great post!  AAAWWW!  I should have taken a pic to post also!  They looked  B-E-A-utiful! Maybe w/ the leftovers!  :)

My husband LOVED these! He immediately said "put these on our list of foods".
The sauce was very good. I agree with another user to let the sauce sit for a few hours, because when I ate it on my taco after I fixed it, it was okay, I didn't see the big deal. But when I ate some more about 4 hours later with some more fish, it was delicious.
I also used tilapia since that's what we had on hand and I didn't put capers or jalapenos in the sauce. And we topped our tacos with the white sauce, cabbage and Pico de Gallo. Delicious!

I was so happy to find this recipe because it tastes just like the wonderful fish tacos we have when we visit San Diego. I usually just buy beer battered cod and deep fry them instead of making my own batter.  I have baked the fish but deep frying is so much better.  I use sour cream instead of the yogurt and leave out the capers and adjust the cayenne pepper for my kids sake. Just make sure to have fresh lime wedges to squeeze over each taco right before you eat it and it is complete perfection!

I've made these tacos twice, thinking I'd done something wrong the first time, but no: the recipe for the batter is too bready.  The white sauce is good, but the beer batter recipe ruins the fish - creating a soggy fishstick texture in the freshly fried fish. A hint:  if you want your fish crispy - 2 cups of flour per 12 oz bottle of beer, two teaspoons of salt and NOTHING ELSE!  the eggs, cornstarch etc. are completely unnecessary.  In the white sauce, I cut the cayenne and jalapeños and doubled the dill.

I was hesitant at first to make these, but I love fish tacos so much, I had to. They were fantastic, with a wonderful crunch to them.  Very good topped with salsa, cabbage, chopped tomatoes, and lemon juice.  Wonderful recipe, its a keeper!!

I made this recipe last night.  I had never eaten fish tacos before, but one of my co-workers said how awesome they are.  I used fresh striped bass that my husband had caught.  The beer batter was excellent, light and crispy.  I don't have a deep fryer, so I used my electric frying pan.  Turned out great.  And the sauce was sooooo tasty.  My husband and son turned their noses up at first.  But then my son informed me that the sauce was "bangin'".  My husband agreed too.  Will definately use this recipe again.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box forever to try - I wish I would have tried it earlier!!  The batter is perfect - I wouldn't change a thing!!  We made some substitutions for the dressing with what we had on hand, but it was very tasty!  I'm keeping this one on hand!

I moved to San Diego about a year ago and discovered fish tacos.  Now, whenever my boyfriend and I go deep sea fishiing off the San Diego coast this is the recipe we make with our freshly caught fish!  These are wonderful.  I just made them for the third time and I don't change a thing! Thanks, Tanya!

Fantastic!  I use the white sauce from this recipe and the broiled tilapia parmesan recipe (from this site) in place of the fried cod.  I've tried making it both ways, and my husband and I just prefer the baked fish (which is by no means healthier by the time we add the parmesan topping).  I also use prepackaged coleslaw to add more veggies than just cabbage.

Beer batter was awesome! I'm from California and lived in Las Vegas for a while so had plenty of fish tacos whenever I wanted. After moving to Toronto, I discovered that they haven't even heard of them at the Mexican restaraunts here. This recipe was the most 'authentic' one I could find. I cut the mayo in half and ommitted the paprika and capers. I ate four in one night. Also used remaining batter for some sliced onions.

Okay - these were the best fish tacos I've had in a long time.  I'm from SD too, and somewhat of a fish taco snob... so I consider myself an authority on the subject.  These were perfect.  I used Talapia 'cause its what I had - and used negro modelo beer (again, what I had) and it was perfect.  I will be making these again and again.  The sauce is perfect!!!

We really did not care for these at all. The fish itself was ok...not exceptionally flavorful though.  The sauce was terrible in our opinion.  All we tasted was the jalapeno and cayene pepper.  We enjoy spicy foods, but this had no flavor other than !!!HOT!!!  The fresh lime juice in the sauce was totally overpowered, as was the oregano, cumin and dill weed.  Our last two vacations have been to San Diego, and we've loved the fish tacos that we sampled there....but these had a completely different flavor.

I am always looking for new ways to serve fish, and this recipe caught my eye!  I did change it up a little bit by making it into a Fish Taco Salad!  I used hearts of romaine, a shredded cabbage mix, chopped up avocado, a fresh tomato, chopped red onion, and corn tortilla chips.  I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce and used that as the salad dressing, except I used nonfat vogurt and light mayo (you wouldn't even notice) and it was awesome, I loved the flavors of the capers and jalapeño!  I used a fresh piece of cod, but really any cut of fish would work!  Can't wait to make it again!

The sauce was the best part.  I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise and used slightly more yogurt and reduced the mayo.  I don't think it mattered though, we used all the left over sauce in ham sandwhiches the next day.

LOVED THIS!  I've been dying to try this recipe (which brought a few snickers from the snotty Tex-Mex fans in attendance), and the beer batter made them irresistable. 100% hit!!!

However, I had a TON of the sauce leftover.  It's pretty potent, so wasn't sure what to use the remaining portion on.  

The next time I made this, I tried it unbattered like one other reviewer suggested and halved the sauce.  Great as well!  Can't wait to bring this around again once margarita season is back!  Thanks Tanya!

These were pretty good. I made the sauce first then into the frig to thicken. I added just half of the jalapeno pepper and it was plenty hot. This would be a good dipping sauce for just about anything. Excellent flavor. I wasn't to crazy about the corn tortia flavor and will make them with the flour tortias next time. Thank you for the recipe, Tanya~

Thank you Tanya for this tasty new dish.  I've never been a "flaky fish" person but this recipe has given me a new appreciation for the hallibuts, cods and talapias out there (any of those fish will work with this).  The sauce was wonderful...as per the other reviews I cut the cayenne by half and changed nothing else.  This was very indulgent for me so next time I will just broil the fish plain (skipping the batter/frying)--this won't really change the things I loved about this meal: the combination of temperatures, textures and flavors.  But for special occasions/guests I'll prepare as written.  Awesome!!!

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband (of Mexican descent) raved about these tacos.  He can't wait to have his family over so we can serve these.  I'll probably serve with cilantro lime rice or Mexican rice, but really these are a meal in themselves.  Thanks so much Tanya!

I'm from San Diego too, but no longer live there and boy have I been missing GOOD fish tacos! These are much better than Runio's even! I LOVED them! The only thing, the sauce was a bit too hot for me. Next time I will omit the jalepeno. I will be making these alot!! THANK YOU SO MUCH for this recipe!!!

This is a stellar recipe! To cut down on calories I used fat free yogurt and mayo, and I grilled the fish instead of frying it. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was beyond fantastic! Beware to those who dont like spicy food the tsp of cayenne pepper gives it a kick!

This was my first time having, much less making fish tacos. I don't like fried foods, so I marinated the mahi mahi in lemon (didn't have a lime) and juice from the canned jalapeno peppers. I pan-seared the fish in a cast iron skillet with no oil and cut it up in the pan so it would be blacked and seared. 

The sauce is fantastic! I used canned jalapenos and sour cream instead of mayo. It was spicy and so very good. 

My husband loved this dish and I'll be making it again.

Absolutely yummy.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I substituted with coconut greek yogurt.  It was sooooo good.  I HIGHLY recommend this substitution.  Everything else was the same.  Served it with spanish rice (box mix) and mango salsa.  Everyone gobbled it up, including the kids.

only one word can describe this, particularly the white sauce..... unreal. I didn't add the jalapenos to the white sauce. It was spicy enough for me and my fiance with the cayenne. I used Tilapia as my fish. Also, be sure to poke holes in your tortilla before the quick fry.

I do not own a deep frier, so I fried our fish (mahi mahi) in a pan with about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil and the results were FABULOUS. I had never attempted fried fish tacos at home before, and have to admit that I was a bit nervous… but I was so pleased with the results! Even my husband who swears up and down that he doesn't like fish, loved these. He ate SIX! 

A few tips:: I added some seasoning to the batter itself to kick up the flavour a bit. Just some cumin, cayenne, salt and pepper. You could really jazz it up however you like. The fish was really tasty and could easily have been eaten on its own.

just my 2¢
not any "beer" will work for this. skip the pale vienna and american lagers and instead choose a malty ale, like an amber or (english) ESB or an american Pale, you will be much more astounded by beer that actually contributes flavor. 
i skipped the capers and despite the photo of cilantro that was not in the recipe (unless i am blind) i added it along with fresh pico de gallo and red onions in favor of yellow. this calls for cod, but don't overlook whiting, halibut or mahi mahi. oh, and vanilla bean ice cream topped with apple crumble is amazeballs with fish tacos. NOM!

So I decided to make something different for dinner.  The looks the family gave me when I suggested fish tacos...keeping in mind this is a meat and potatoes family.  Needless to say, they ALL ate their words!!!  I threw some fresh shrimp in there, mainly cause it was on sale and sounded good...but there was nothing but yummy noises and a family eating their words.  Highly recommend!!!  We will make this one again!

My husband said these were "friggin' awesome!" and suggested I give the recipe to a local restaurant.  Let's be clear; he's not exactly a fish taco kind of guy.  They were really good.  I didn't have capers on hand so I added a pinch of salt to the sauce, and I mixed some red onion with the cabbage.  We'll definitely make these again.

I read the recipe, and these reveiws and just had to try this. First, the beer batter was awesome and easy for a beginner to master, and second the sauce was excellent. I used fresh caught walleye for these and my friends were amazed, and have designated me cook for an upcoming fishing trip!!!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I made these tonight for my husband and it was easy and delicious!  I did make just a minor change to the sauce, I substituted fresh cilantro for the oregano and used fresh dill in place of dried.  I also omitted the capers, just because I didn't have any.  Also, I made sure that right after the fish came out of the oil, I hit them with a little salt to add flavor.  The sauce is amazing and so flavorful...I would imagine that it would be great with grilled fish as well.  Really easy and fresh!  Will be making this again!!!

The sauce makes this recipe. The fried fish is great, but I prefer to toss the fish in a flour/taco seasoning mixture and pan fry it in a little oil. Not only does it taste better, but it's quicker and easier to clean.

Excellent!  I made these for dinner this evening. The sauce is so yummy on fish!  We travel 30 miles to go to a Mexican restaurant for their fish tacos.  I have just saved money on gas!  Thank you.

I made this with Tilapia. Amazing! The substitutions I made were: Greek yogurt instead of plain. I used fresh dill, and omitted the capers. I warmed up "handmade style" yellow corn tortillas on a griddle, no oil. Oh and of course homemade pico de gallo. These were amazing! I can't wait to make them for everyone I know!

I've been making this recipe for several years now and they are amazing everytime. Family and friends are always happy and come back for more. The only thing I like to change/add is to season the fish before flouring with lemon pepper or the like.  Additionally,I double the batch of sauce and keep it on hand for crab cakes, oysters and what not..So good!!!

Awesome dish, as the recipe states. We used a summer shandy for the beer which added a nice lemony hint to the fish which combined well with the white lime in the white sauce. We replaced the cod with tilapia and the flavors were magnificent! I highly recommend this dish! ( the sauce is a little spicy so we added a little bit more yogurt to the sauce to cut down the heat)

I made these last night, and yes, with some changes. I did not fry or batter the fish. I baked it on a ridged sheet pan at 400 * for about 15-20 mins, turning once. I used tilapia and removed the thin edge ( since it would only be dry) and cut each filet lengthwise in half. I dusted each with seasoned salt, pepper, cumin, paprika and oregano. For the sauce, I used 1/2 C each sour cream & mayo, the juice of 1 1/2 lemons (it's what I had) and 1 tsp each cumin, chili powder, oregano & cayenne pepper. Served with shredded lettuce, cheese & flour tortillas. Everyone loved these and there were -0- left overs. I will make these again!

I tweaked this a hair. I used fresh-caught bass filets cut into strips. I used a whole diced, seeded jalapeno, not capers (none at hand.) I fried some bacon, reserved the bacon. added olive oil and butter, fresh diced garlic and sweet onion . that was added to white sauce. mixed the bacon, garlic and onion back to white sauce.  yeah, this is excellent. next time ( and there will be a next time ) I would chill the batter, add more jalapeno and lime juice and fry the fish ahead, so prep would be quicker. excellent recipe..white sauce rocks!

I was  looking for an amazing recipe for fish Tacos, trying to introduce some new flavors to many of my families' boring meals. I came across this recipe and was a little intimidated at first to try this as it's a little time consuming. However, it worked out well and the video was a big help. I used Blue Moon beer. I didn't have any cumin so in a desperate move I used a pinch of taco seasoning. Those are the only different ingredients I used. The flavors were perfect. My husband ( who hates every thing) loved the flavor as well. The sauce on it's own not so fascinating , but once combined with the fish, cabbage, avocado,  & onion (our toppings) it was delish!! I can't wait to serve this at my next get together.  Ps, the sauce over brown rice taste great as well!

If you want the real white sauce for the fish tacos you mix equal amounts of mayonnaise and sour cream, and lime juice!

Absolutely fabulous! I was so hesitant to try this.  Fish of all things.  My husband looked at me like I was crazy after I made them  Turns out he ate them and asked for seconds.  He does not even really like fish.  All of these ingredients come together in texture and taste that is a culinary treat. Thank you!!!

Tried this recipe last night, nearly as written. It turned out really well. 

VERY MINOR CHANGES: 
1) I seasoned the flour I use to coat the fish prior to dipping into the batter with a tbs of Badia Sazon Tropical (a blend of salt, black pepper, garlic, onion, oregano, paprika, and cumin). 

2)I also substituted sour cream for yogurt in the sauce. I also added 1 tsp cilantro, changed the tsp of cayenne to 1/2 tsp cayenne + 1/2 tsp ground chipotle, added a pinch of sugar since not using yogurt, and salt & pepper to taste. 

3) I made the batter a bit thinner by adding more beer, so that I had less of a thick pancake coating. It was almost the consistency of gravy, but made for a light, crispy coating. 

4) I did not fry my tortillas, but wrapped them in a damp paper towel and warmed them in the microwave. Also did not use cabbage, but had shredded lettuce, diced tomato and diced avocado, as well as pico and salsa verde for toppings

5) For this go-round, I used tilapia filets (I'd already used my cod for fish-n-chips). They worked out REALLY well. First time cooking tilapia, and pleased with results

TIPS: drain the cooked fish on brown paper bags set on cookie sheets. It absorbs the oil and helps it from getting soggy. You can also keep them in a warm oven on the brown bags while cooking in batches. The fish stayed crispy and did not overcook. You can reheat leftover fish on greased cookie cooling racks and it turns out crispy and delicious (same as with other fried foods).

It was right on the money.  First time made it and every time.  My husband is crazy for this.  We were in San Diego and there is a 2nd floor restaurant facing the ocean that claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego.  They do and this recipe captured it!!!!!

Great recipe! We loved it and will make it again. It makes a lot of batter and white sauce so you could probably double the amount of fish and still be just fine. I made it with "Ex-girlfriend's Mom's salsa fresca" (also on All Recipes). Strange name but great pico de gallo and it went perfectly with these tacos!

I make this recipe a couple times a month. Family loves it. I like to season my flour with a bit of mexican seasoning. The sauce is excellent. I make the sauce ahead of time so the flavors meld together. When making the sauce I like to add extra Cilantro to the sauce. I made this again last night using fresh mangrove snapper... it is hubby's favorite. Mine too!

Used Cod on the grill, I used taco shells, S used soft flour tortillas, on the grill for a few secs.  I used only 1/2 tsp of cayenne in the sauce, used low fat mayo and plain Greek yogurt, marinated the cod in lime juice and jalapeno  pepper. Used a bag of slaw mix. Really good.

Served this tonight to a crowd of 20 and there was not a crumb left. I thought people were going to drink the sauce left in the bowls, it is soooo good. Shortcut: used frozen fish sticks. Only other changes were to add a handful of cilantro to the sauce and used flour tortillas. This dish WILL be repeated... again and again. Thanks for a dynamite recipe!

This is a great fish taco meal! FYI: The frying time should be a total of 6 minutes. For those that are sensitive to spicy dishes, you may want to use 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

I am sure this recipe is great with the right fish. I do not care for fried fish so i used broiled cod. Did not care for the taste of the sauce. I think i will leave this recipe to the professionals. Aka; order it from a resturant!

Even with all the cayenne and jalapenos (I used 1.5 canned), it was not as hot and spicy as I expected.  But the tang of the yogurt and the overall flavor for fish tacos was very good.  The consistency was just right.  Instead of deep fried beer batter, I fried chunks of cod that were dredged in my favorite TexMex mix of flour, bread crumbs, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  Quite good, and I will probably make it again.  P.S. It's much spicier after a day or so in the fridge.

OMG this was so good I could eat this every night.  I made it gluten free using rice flour and gluten free beer.  I added chopped green onions, avocado slices and cilantro for the topping.  I will be making just the dressing for chip dip too.

Yum!!  I saved time by just using frozen breaded fish patties and preparing them as per the box directions, but the white sacue from this is fantastic!  I rolled the fish patty, the cabbage and sauce in a flour tortilla and the kids loved it!  So did I!

I used some frozen "ultimate fish sticks" from a big box store, and swiss chard instead of cabbage.  Cut prep time in half, and still delish. Also, I added chopped tomato and onion, and ramped up cumin.  Great weeknight dinner!

I'm also from San Diego & have dined on many a fish taco at the Fish market in Ensenada Mex.  I originally also used cod abut I've found that Red Snapper is closer to the original. Better taste.  Just a few small bones to pull out and cut the pieces about thumb size, 45 deg. across the grain One key ingredient that is missing here is a squeeze of fresh lime juice to top it off. I even add it to my white sauce.

I mixed the white sauce with some shredded cabbage and let it "wilt" and the flavors marry in fridge about 30 minutes.  Then added that on top of the fish in my taco.  Great flavor!  I omitted the dill (didn't have - don't like), used fresh cilantro in place of oregano, and no fat greek yogurt.  The lime juice really added to it all.  Pan fried my fish with a different floury mix.  I'll keep working on the fish part, but that slaw mixture was tops!

Really good!  I added some green Tabasco to my sauce in absence of diced jalapeños.  I decided to fry the fish and I am glad I did - the beer batter was really tasty and fried up light and crisp.  The only change I'd make is to season the fish with some seasoned salt and maybe some cayenne before battering.  You could also just mix that into the batter, perhaps.

absolutely the best!!!  Love the batter and the sauce is crazy insane!!  In fact, sometimes I just make the sauce to use it on other foods.  Ive made this for guests and always get the same look when I mention fish tacos.  After they try it, everyone wants the recipe.  This is actually better than some of the fish tacos I have had in San Diego where I visit every year.

Very good.  The sauce is great.  I used mahi mahi instead.  The batter recipe is sound, although I think I'll grill the fish in the future so it's less heavy.

Made this recipe the first time, following the direction exactly, and it was fantastic; my family just went wild.  I used Cobia, since my husband had just returned from a fishing trip in the Gulf, and we had lots of fish. 

 The batter was so light and tasty, the next time I made this recipe, I doubled the batter and made battered/fried onion rings as well.  Another big hit!  The white sauce was so popular, I now have a batch on hand in the fridge to use as a dip with chips, on tacos or slightly thinned as a salad dressing.

Thank you for sharing this easy and very tasty recipe!

These are awesome and incredibly easy. I made a view changes because I didnt have all ingredients. I used sour cream instead of yogurt. And I didnt used capers and dill and it was great!.. also, i used flounder instead of cod.. i think any white fish would work! my picky eater boyfriend loved these too!! :)  thanks!!

First off the sauce is amazing and I will definitely be making again for fish tacos or other Mexican dishes as outside of the yogurt and jalapeno everything is usually in my kitchen anyway.  The recipe is easy to make and very tasty.  Cilantro if you like it should be included in any Mexican dish I think as it ads a very fresh flavor and I'll be adding it to the sauce next time as some suggest.  I've only made this once and my only complaint really is that the breading turned out too thick and heavy.  It really puffed up so it looked more like fish and chips but I think next time I'll drop the amount of flour a little and probably not whisk it as much, but otherwise it's decent batter and easy to make as well as a lot cheaper then the store bought.

The white sauce needs to be placed as a seperate multi-use recipe!  It is awesome!  I tried it on some grilled Chilean Sea Bass and it was a BIG hit!  The fish taco's were a great hit as well, even with those we had to coerce into trying one because it didn't "sound" appetizing to logger rednecks up here in the pacific northwest.

fish was very good. I just used this recipe for the battered fish part and the sauce. Sauce was good too, but I added a bit too much cumin and I didn't use Jalepeno, cayenne or capers. Because of people here who don't like heat and I didn't have capers. I think the sauce would be better with those missing peices.

The sauce alone is 5 stars!  We grilled our fish to keep it healthier, so I can't comment on the fish component of the recipe.  But I can tell you these tacos were EXCELLENT!

I love this recipe for beer battered fish. I have made it with hake, cod and ono fish. Awesome! I have not made the sauce, only because I have my own recipe which I really like, although I am sure it is great! For the beer, I really like using a dark mexican beer, like negra modelo! So good!

Delicious!  The sauce is what really made these tasty.  It has quite a a kick, but I wouldn't do anything different next time.  I made the sauce about 4 hours before dinner, so the flavors had time to blend.  I didn't have corn tortillas, so we just used flour, and didn't even fry them.  I will try this with corn tortillas next time.  The fish by itself was a little bland, and at first I thought I would spice it up more next time, but considering how flavorful the sauce is, I think I'll just leave everything the way it is.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

The sauce was the only thing good about this recipe.  The fish just tasted like fried food - the batter didn't add anything to it.

Loved this recipe!  It received rave reviews when I made it for a neighborhood dinner a couple weeks ago.  Since then I've made it twice!  Very easy to make.  The sauce is absolutely amazing!

Great recipe, better than California's famous Rubio's!  Cheated and used pre-seasoned frozen tilapia from Costco, baked, unbreaded.  I've also used plain frozen tilapia that I seasoned with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper and then baked.  Either one proves to be a huge time saver and healthier alternative!  Sauce REALLY makes these tacos, but make sure to make well ahead so flavors blend.  Based on other reviews, omitted capers, used sour cream instead of yogurt and used half the dill weed.  Hubby is from California and grew up eating fish tacos and says these are THE BEST EVER!  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!

These are amazing!! Have tried the recipe with just grilling the fish and preparing the batter - both are delicious. The sauce is yummy! Did not change a thing.

Wow!   these tacos were amazing.   Just ate some leftovers for breakfast.   Learned that the white sauce is tastier having mellowed.   Next time I will make it ahead if possible.   I used Haddock for myself and my daughter and trout for my husband who is allergic to ocean fish.  Both worked out great.   I found the batter needed a bit more beer as it was too thick and I used a flavorful amber beer.  

Instead of cabbage I used shaved lettuce which I mixed up with lots of chopped cilantro.   Yum!

I did not use a quart of oil but about 1 inch in the bottom of a fry pan.  Cooked for about 4 minutes and then flipped (when golden).  As I almost never fry foods it seemed a shame to throw out that much oil at the end so this way it used less.   

We enjoyed the beer batter enough I will likely use it again too even if not making the tacos. 

I love this website as I keep finding these amazing recipes!

This is a great recipe! I added some salt to the sauce, the fish,  and the fish batter- as it is under salted, and substituted most of the mayo with yogurt. In additon, we added the rest of the beer bottle to the batter- to thin it out a bit! YUM

Deserves every star and maybe more. I couldn't imagine being able to make good fish tacos at home but these were great and easy to prepare. We lived in San Diego for 13 years so I know what good fish tacos taste like. Yum

Wonderful recipe. 

To save time, I used prefried frozen fish and it was still fantastic. I prepared the sauce about an hour in advance to let the ingredients sit together. This was super simple and fantastic tasting.

These tacos are addictive. You will want them every week. I just buy battered fish fillets though. I add red salsa and cheese to my tacos also. Love them.

These were awesome and just as good, if not better than any fish tacos I have ordered out. I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce is amazing. I have a hard time finding fish dishes my husband likes, and he LOVED this, so it is definitely going into our menu rotation!!!

I probably make this more than any other recipe on this site. The only thing I would suggest is to make the sauce the day before so the flavors have time to mesh, if you don't have time to do that, don't worry about it, its still extremely flavorful. Also, I use tilapia fillets because they are cheaper and it works out just as well. Love it!

This was really good. The only thing I did different was I left out the oregano (because I didn't have anymore) and it was still a hit at my house.

Very tasty. It's a little too spicy for my wife, so I'd recommend serving the minced jalapeno on the side. This recipie also works great with grilled mahi mahi. I skip the top half of the recipe since I'm grilling, but then I add a little beer to the fish as I grill. And I always use wood chips for that smoky flavor. Yum!

This is one meal my whole family will eat, and that doesn't happen very often!  So we have it about once a week now.  I highly recommend serving these with a little bit of pico de gallo and a sliver of fresh avocado on top. What makes this recipe outstanding is it's versatility. You can use any kind of fish; I've made it with cod, haddock and mahi mahi. Or...try it with some shrimp sauteed in a little bit of garlic and olive oil.  Yummy!!  The beer batter can stand by itself, light and fluffy with just enough crunch. Perfect for any kind of fish fry.  I usually make a double batch of the sauce because it is SO good! It's great on baked fish, too!

It doesn't get any better than this! So good! As a native Californian who now lives in Wisconsin, I am always looking for something that reminds me of home. Delicious recipe! 

My husband absolutely hates mayo, and he didn't even realize the sauce was made with it. Just wanted to throw that in there in case anyone is worried about the use of mayo in the sauce.

This was very tasty. I pan friend it because I didnt feel like setting up the deep fryer. The sauce is great! Just beware if you pan fry, the oil pops and could burn you! I might also add a little garlic powder to the batter next time.

Absolutely awesome!  I didn't have the capers, but don't think we missed them.  Also, I used my deep fryer, and deep fried the leftover batter into litle crumbs which everyone thought was just a nice, tasty touch.

I saw the review from the person from San Diego and jumped at this recipe. I'm from the Coachella Valley- this recipe is right on. I stayed away from the capers and oregano and added some fresh minced habanero and a dash of epazote instead. Fantastic!

This were good. I was hoping for spectacular. The sauce was great, but I think I would cut down on the dill, just a little. I made everything exactly as written, the fish was great, crispy and stayed that way, nice suprise. I think the corn tortillas are just too overpowering of a flavor on their own. I will probably not make these again, but may have to use the sauce recipe for other dishes, as I did think it was quite good (Oh, actually I did change one little thing, along with all other ingredients I added about a teaspoon of fresh grated lime zest to the sauce, I try to incorporate some whenever using the juice, I feel it makes it a little more "fresh" tasting).  I tried the corn tortillas simply heated on a hot skillet, and I also tried frying them in oil, both ways did not appeal to me... I think I'm more of a flour tortilla kinda gal, they seem to allow the flavor of the filling to come through a little more.

This was delicious. It was the first time I battered and fried something; it was slightly messy but not too difficult. I added a splash more beer to the batter to get a slightly thinner consistency; it was very thick. I don't have a fryer, so I heated an inch of vegetable oil in a heavy duty pot on medium high. I swirled the oil in the pan a bit, so it would cover the fish fillet while the one side was fru=ying about two minutes, and then turned the fish over with a spatula to cook the other side for two minutes. Both sides should be a nice golden light brown. The batter was light and crispy. The sauce is so tasty and I didn't make it ahead.  I omitted the jalapeno and capersand used 1/8 t. cayenne. I thought the sauce was enough for one pound of fish. Will certainly make again.

I made these, with the recipe down to the letter, and they were absolutely fantastic.  I am making them again for the second night in a row with the extra cod I have leftover.  They are that good!  The only thing I added was extra ground red pepper to the yogurt/mayo sauce.  Just to spice them up.   Highly recommend this recipe!

Very Yummy! The sauce was very tasty. My husband said he thought it was really good and he doesn't care that much for fish! I used tilapia.  I decided to broil it because I wanted to do something easier and less messy. Broiling was a mistake. I could tell that it would be much better fried.  I added more lime to the sauce (because I like lime) and drizzled some on the fish itself). I forgot to buy a jalapeno pepper but I thought the dish was still spicy without it.   I used some colorful veggies also.  Definitely a recipe I will make again. I am grateful to have a fish recipe that my hubby will eat!

These were delicious. I made mine with flounder as I really don't like cod. The beer batter was very flavorful and I will use this recipe for my fried fish from now on. I left out the capers from the white sauce as I don't really like them and served with some fresco salsa. I loved the white sauce. Also I did not fry the corn tortillas, I just warmed them. As the others mentioned I will try grilling or oven baking the fish next time. I will definitely make them again, thanks for posting.

I made this for Christmas dinner, 2010 and it was just outstanding.  Don’t use GROUND oregano-use CRUSHED.  Let the cream sauce age for a few hours to a day to allow the flavors to meld.  Using canned/pickled jalapenos was just fine as opposed to fresh jalapenos.  Finally, don’t rinse the capers.  Some recipes suggest that rinsing capers are a good idea, but the salty/bitter taste of the caper straight from the jar (minced of course) really enhanced the sauce.

My husband and I were very pleasantly surprised with this delicious recipe!  Doubled the amount of sauce, left out capers, added enough sour cream to the 6 oz. fat-free plain yogurt to make 1 c., and used cilantro instead of oregano.  Baked frozen battered cod portions I had on hand and packaged tri-color slaw mix.  This recipe is one I'll add to my collection.  Thanks to everyone for your short-cuts and ideas!

Great, simple recipe. The sauce is unique and goes perfect with the fish. (I used a ground up mexican oregano) The beer batter got lots of compliments, it was the perfect texture and fluffy lightness. All in all great recipe will be using this again and again. Thanks!

Oh this one was amazing! The sauce was a 5 star and the only reason I gave it 4 was because I'm not a fan of the battered fried fish. Next time I'll grill it with one blackened seasoning. You have to warm the corn tortilla's in pan, it makes then perfect and they wont break.

This is a great recipe, the sauce is great, however I had to remake the beer batter as I learned the colder the better - get that batter cold, almost freeze the beer, then stack it in a bowl on Ice like a double boiler  - my wife also prefered some seasoning in the batter other than what was mentioned, once I had cold batter, I dug it - see the cold reacts differently in the hot oil than a room temp batter, it was much crispier and lighter even - I also jumped the temp on accident to 400* and got a better result...

I have made these several times and they are always a hit. My husband and his friend used to eat these all the time in San Diego while in the Marine Corps and they swear by them! I also add a little salt and cayenne to the beer batter, otherwise it is a tad bland (but you can always add more white sauce!!). I also make the sauce a day ahead of time when I can, it is much better on the second day after the flavors have time to get together.

I really liked these tacos. I didn't use a few of the ingredients because I didn't feel like running to the store and I used tilapia because I already had it in the house and they still turned out amazing. I would say if you don't like heat cut back on the cayenne pepper.

I only used the batter portion of this recipe and it was very good, and made them with mahi mahi, which in my opinion is the best fish for fish tacos. The only difference I did was to add a little cayenne pepper and a little ancho chile pepper to the batter after mixing. I did find that I needed to add a little more beer in order to get the batter to the consistency I wanted - but wow, the flavor of the fish was FANTASTIC! I served them on small tortillas (not fried)with some homemade tarter sauce, shredded cabbage and a few squeezes of lime. Will definitely make again!!

Great recipe! To keep it healthy, I used Zatarains Bake & Crisp Seafood to substitute frying and Nasoya Nayonaise (vegan alternative to mayo). It was great, thanks!

I only used the batter portion of this recipe and it was very good.   I used a light, white fish.  I added 1 tsp of cayenne to the flour mixture.  Then I fried corn tortillas and topped with a spicy cole slaw.  FABULOUS!  Very delish, everyone loved them.

I did not have the ingredients for the sauce, but I can definitely vouch for the batter.  It was light and crispy - perfect for the tilapia fillets we used for our fish tacos. The only thing we did differently was to add 1 tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning to the batter and salted the fish when they came out of the oil. We had a lot of batter left over, will half the recipe next time, should be perfect for two people. Thanks for posting the recipe, its the best fish batter recipe I've come across so far.

OMG, this recipe is just awesome!! The batter is so light and crunchy, and everybody who raved about the white sauce is right--it's completely addictive!  I used 4 ounce tilapia filets--because it's what I had on hand--and just cut them into smaller, two ounce 'sticks'. With crispy cabbage, queso fresco, some of that delicious sauce and a store-bought mango pico de gallo, this was simply amazing. Will make again and again!

Wanted to like this.  Tried it twice.  Second time made exactly as recipe stated.  The fish batter was VERY bland.  Everyone agreed.  The sauce was artificial tasting..too much cayenne...it took over all the other flavors. Very disappointing.

This was a great, fairly easy recipe.  The fish was tasty and everyone at dinner loved it.  Instead of frying I marinated the fish in lime juice, fresh jalapeno, salt, pepper, and a little bit of olive oil then grilled - we didn't have a quart of oil.  White sauce was a hit with everyone and I made a recipe of Heather's Black Bean Corn...salsa (found on allrecipes.com) to accompany the tacos.  Altogether a great recipe!

I made the white sauce from this recipe this weekend, and it turned out great! I added chipotle sauce to it for added spice, and left out the jalapeno, capers, and oregano.  I did it with grilled salmon and shrimp tacos and they were both perfect!  Solid recipe and with non-fat yogurt and low fat mayo, it really isn't that bad for you either.

I Love fish, been wanting to try it in a taco for a long time.  This is the first time that I've ever eaten raw cabbage, but its quite refreshing.  And the sauce really makes these tacos outstanding!!!  At first I thought a whole jalepeno would be way to much, cuz it was a big fat one.  It was perfect for the amount of sauce in the recipe!!  I did cut the amount of cayenne, just a smidg though.  I will Thanks breese for a most excellent recipe!!!!

Fantastic as is or with some modifications.  We used sour cream instead of yogurt because it's all we had.  We also use a carrot/cabbage pre-cut coleslaw mix and toss it with a bit of the white sauce just before serving to help it all hold together (then add more because it's so amazingly good!)

These were soo good! I did add some more salt, but that is just our preference,other than that everything was the same! These were easy to make up, and we used Tilopia, as I couldn't find any Cod yesterday (our fish monger had just closed! Boo) But it worked out wonderfully with What we used. We are going to have friends over next weekend, and we are going to make these, but put in different types of sea food, I think this would be wonderful with shrimp and other things as well. can't wait to try them next week. and the sauce is wonderful!! We doubled the sauce and I am glade we did.

I didn't fry the fish but instead rubbed it with spices & broiled it (didn't feel like grilling).  I also cut the heat in the white sauce.  The corn tortillas also ripped up on us so I might try flour tortillas next time. Overall it was very good and is something that I will make again! excellent with Black Beans & Rice and Pico with Chips (used the extra white sauce as a dip too!)

We did the white sauce differently and it was amazing. We used sour cream instead of yogurt and left out the jalapeno, capers and cayenne and added 1 1/2 adobo chipotle peppers. It was so good!

Thias was only ok to me. I liked how crisp and light the batter was, but it needed more salt and seasoning to it. It was just too bland. Also I didn't like the sauce at all. Too much of that dill taste. I think just a regular horseradish would've been a better compliment. I may try this again but with a couple of changes to suite our tastes more.

The sauce for this recipe is AMAZING!! I omitted capers (I don't like them) and subbed some cole slaw for cabbage, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Well, I used Mahi Mahi, which is what I had on hand, but white fish is white fish! We love spice, and it had a great kick. I can see how this would be a little much for some though, so add the jalapeno and cayenne slowly. The beer batter for the fish was perfect. This will be our beer batter from now on. Perfectly crispy! I added a little Panko and some spices, which I recommend. We also didn't deep fry this - we just tossed a little EVOO in the pan, sliced the fish into fish stick-size pieces, and it was perfect. Yum!! -- We made this two nights in a row. Holy cow , is it good! The second time I added more seasoning to the beer batter as well as a little hot sauce. I added minced garlic to the sauce - why not? We only had 1 piece of Mahi, 1 of salmon, and some shrimp, so I made them all. Still awesome! This is a really versatile recipe, which makes it extra nice!

I only made the sauce (instead sauted talipa in olive oil with similiar seasonings to the sauce) but the sauce is OUTSTANDING!!!  I would have never thought of that mix of spices and it is SO good.  Served the fish with the coleslaw, guacamole, shredded cheese, spanish rice, whole wheat tortillas and of course THE SAUCE, and it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband lived in San Diego for years & he always talked about fish tacos..they sounded terrible to me untill I tried this recipe! OMG! These deserve 10 stars...we could live on these! Thanks for posting! I did make a few slight changes after trying the original...I used cliantro instead of oregano..sour cream instead of yogurt & no capers....for a quick version, frozen fish fillets work just as well, you can't tell the difference!

This was very good.  I thinned the batter a with a little more beer than called for and it cooked up crisper than with the thicker batter.  The sauce was amazing.

this review is really for the sauce which is excellent. I've made the sauce for fish tacos ...i don't know how many times, now i use 3 parts yogurt 1 part mayo without noticing much of a difference. one day I will fry my own fish but for now I'll use pan fried, baked, and yes even fish sticks. thanks for the recipe.

Let me start off by saying that fish and tacos are not a natural affiliation for me. However, this recipe is unbelievable. My husband and 1 year old eat these tacos. We have tried grilled and fried fish and LOVE both. I have to admit that I cheated once as well- used store bought fried fish. Was still good, but much better when fresh. We didn't have any shredded cabbage on hand the first time around, but did the rest as indicated. Turned out better than expected. Must give credit where credit is due.  This is a great recipe- especially if it can turn non-fish eaters into fish eaters.  Thanks!

Left out the capers(I was out), and baked the fish instead, to keep from the trouble and calories of deep-frying.  I added some green peppers, too.  Used the small white corn tortillas, and they made it delicious!  It was just fantastic, can't wait until I make it again!

I took one of the members advice and used frozen cod instead. Much faster and still good. The sauce is outstanding. Used sour cream instead of yogurt. Be careful how much jalepeno you add. I opt to leave it out and use the cayenne pepper instead.

I've only made the sauce for these tacos, because I'm not a big on beer batter.  I make it exactly as shown - except I make sure to find a big jalapeno, my boyfriend and I love spice!  This sauce is delicious, and fits right into any fish taco, whether battered or not.  I don't usually have capers on hand, so I'll mince up some dill pickle instead.

I used talapia and didn't have capers.  This is a fabulous recipe that reminds me of the Fish Taco's at TGIF's.  Great alternative to regular tacos. The fish recipe alone is great for a healthy alternative to frozen fish sticks!

I loved this recipe! Instead of the herbs used here I used cilantro and cayenne and long hot peppers from the garden. I used red cabbage and they looked so pretty when served. A real keeper thanks for sharing!

To make this a super easy meal, I buy the frozen breaded tilapia at Costco, bake it, and break it into pieces. I buy the shredded coleslaw and top with the sauce in this receipe.

The sauce in this recipe is super! I like to keep it on hand for all sorts of things. I used plain greek yogurt. I like to add a little smokey paprika but other then that it is the same! YUM! Sometimes I used Shrimp instead of fish and just saute them to keep it lighter. Black beans and cilantro rice just take it over the edge to FABULOUS!

this is sooooo good! The only thing I do differently is saute the fish with a little pepper in butter, garlic, and lime juice until it flakes easily (no breading)....we absolutely love these tacos! The sauce is the kicker, I've used sour cream instead of yogurt and it's fantastic! I also like to use a bag of shredded angel hair cabbage....makes it even easier.:)

These are VERY good.I made them about a month ago. I am slow on the reviews sometimes. I did not fry the fish. I coated it with cormeal and cooked it on a big electric griddle. I also used talapia. The sauce is awesome!!! I used all fat free yogurt, no mayo and whole wheat tortillas. I am making these again tomorrow.

I had downloaded, printed, and saved this recipe last year because it sounded interesting.  I finally prepared it this past weekend and am sorry I did not prepare it sooner!  It was absolutely awesome!  My husband loved it also and it is now a favorite which I will be preparing often in the future.  I followed the recipe exactly as posted here, with no changes, and would not change a thing as it is perfection!  To those of you using prebreaded fish you do not know what you are missing!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We made this the other day and we all thought the sauce made the fish taco perfect. We left the capers out of the sauce, was still great. Also used shredded lettuce instead of cabbage. I hope to try the cabbage next time when it is just my family. Thanks for the great recipe.

I've been searching for the best fish tacos for about three years now....I'm searching no longer. No restaurant I've been to can even come close to these fish tacos! Excellent! Will make these again and again. We just returned from the beach and brought back some Amberjack fish, which I used in this recipe. Wonderful!

The stars are for the beer batter fried fish which was really good - the kids ate it up - and would be a good mix for fish and chips. For that alone I would have given 4-5 stars.  I did not like the sauce, however.  It was too tangy with yogurt AND lime.  I can see how sour cream might have been better. I will be making the fish again - as it is way cheaper than the frozen beer battered fish.  I used tilapia because I had frozen fillets on hand.

These were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added some fresh cilantro to the tacos. The sauce was really really good! I think I will keep some on hand to use on other foods.

I used to love the fish tacos from Rubios in San Diego - now I live in England and they have never heard of fish tacos until now - everyone I make them for asks for the recipe - they are a huge hit "over the pond".  I cannot rate this recipe high enough - reminds me of home!

I made this for my family & everyone LOVED it! The batter was super crispy and fluffed up very nicely. I was nervous the beer would be a bit overwhelming but not at all. The sauce was uhhh.. very interesting. I liked it though and it went well with the fish. I used a habanero in place of the pepper the recipe called for.. I like my food spicy! I will definitely make this again.

Loved the sauce, although I cut down the mayo to 1/4 cup and upped the yougrt to 3/4 to make it more healthful.  Also, I used grilled Mahi---but the beer batter recipe I will try when it's too cold to grill!  Awesome!

These were excellent.  The batter was light, the sauce fantastic.  Cut the fresh cod in diagonal slices.  The recipe calls for corn tortillas, but, we prefered the flour with these.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 the pepper, but, next time I'll use close to the whold amount because it was not too hot.

The sauce alone is the best!!! I've never added the capers though because I do not like them. I also only add 1/2 of the cayenne and it's still enough heat for us. Either way, this is by far one of my favorites meals/recipes ever as well as my husbands. The beer batter is wonderful but whenever I feel like eating lighter I use grilled or broiled tilapia seasoned w/ chili, onion, & garlic powder, lime juice, salt & pepper & it's out of this world. I also buy bagged coleslaw mix to save prepping time. I garnish my tacos with homemade pico de gallo, lime wedge & cilantro...OMG I'm salivating just thinking about it!

This is the best fish taco recipe I've ever tried!  It's got just enough 'kick' to it, but not overwhelming.  I always have leftover sauce, so I make coleslaw with the cabbage; it makes a nice side with the tacos!  The best!

The only substitution I made was to use up some tilapia I had on hand.  The fish and the sauce complemented each other so well. Will do this again.

Yum, yum, Yummy!  These were fabulous.  We fried the cod and used white corn tortillas.  I also served them with cilantro, chopped cabbage,  avocados, and cheese for garnish.  You don't really need salsa because the sauce is so zippy and flavorful.  Served them with corn chips, salsa, and "Refried Beans without the Refry" from this site.

In a word,YUM.I was a bit leary about the sauce,but it tasted awesome on the taco's.If my five year old says it's awesome than you know it's good.The batter was fantastic.I did catfish since that is something we catch around here and it can taste a bit fishy but with all the yummy flavors of this recipe it was perfect.I topped with some pico and was in fish taco heaven.This is a keeper.

For the Beer Batter I gave 5 stars, but the White Sauce is off.  I'm from SanDiego and live on Fish Tacos when I go home.  When I saw 1 tsp. cayenne pepper I cut it in half and the jalapeno I cut in half.  And it is still too HOT. And the taste of Dill is never in Fish Tacos.  So I'll try to come up with my own sauce.  But the Beer Batter is to die for and I dont eat fried food.

Good golly, that is some incredible sauce! The yogurt is a must and I tripled the capers. I saved the jalapeno to be sauteed with the fish and I cut back on the cayenne for my 8 year old. Let it sit for at least two hours before you serve and watch folks find excuses to sop it up.

If I could give this a million stars I would.  The whole thing was amazing.  From the batter for the fish to the sauce to the flavor all together.  Now I did make 2 different sauces.  In 1 of the sauces I only put in 1/4 tsp of cayenne and did not add jalapenos.  The other 1 left as is.  Oh, I did not put capers in either one but added a little kosher salt bc I figured that the capers salted the sauce.  Anyways,  my whole family loved it and 2 of my 3 kids hate fish and couldn't get enough.  Will def make again.

This was an overall good recipe. However, I found the fish to be alot of trouble- I will just use good quality frozen breaded fish next time. The sauce and the crunch of the cabbage is AWSOME!

I thought that the batter seemed really thick and fluffy after cooked. Next time I will try to put less on. BF thought the batter was the best homemade one he ever had. The sauce is really, really good and I think makes the taco,

What a hit! I don't normally like to deep-fry things, but I recently broke down and bought a liquid thermometer, so I figured I'd give these a shot; besides, my hubby brought home some dorado (mahi mahi) that he caught, and he really wanted fish tacos. The batter was perfect (I use a Pacifico beer) and the white sauce was awesome! I made a double batch (based on other reviews) and I'm looking forward to using it as a veggie dip or even salad dressing. Yummy! I served these with Avocado & Corn Salsa and Refried beans w/out the Refry (both from this site) and this was one successful dinner party. I guess I'll be making fish tacos more often :-) Thanks!

The sauce makes this recipe!  I followed it to a T, except for doubling it.
The next day we put it over slaw.  We served it to friends and they loved it too!  We tried it again using frozen, breaded fish, very good and easy.Thanks!

OMG-so good and very easy.  I added minced garlis to the white sauce, and my entire family could not get enough.  This will now be added to our regular meal rotation.  Thanks for a great reipe.

These tasted just like the fish tacos I had when I was in San Diego.  Everyone in my family loves them.  The only thing I did different with these tacos is use sour cream in the sauce instead of plain yogurt because I had sour cream on hand the first time I made them.  Very tasty! I'm making myself hungry.  I know what I'm having for dinner tonight!

Excellent!  I used fat-free sour cream in place of the yogurt, and light mayonnaise.  Couldn't tell it wasn't full strength.  Tonight I'll try again, using the George Forman as someone else suggested.  Thanks for the great recipe!

these are SO GOOD!  I used to live in CO, which had a Rubio's and I loved their fish tacos!  Haven't had one in eight years, so I was so excited to try these!  Very simple to make, I load mine up with cabbage and a little extra lime.  I used tilapia instead of the cod, as it was what my pocketbook could afford.  Serve this up with tortilla chips and refried beans spiked with lime juice, YUM!

This was awesome! I didn't batter the fish, just fried it a bit in olive oil. I also added tomatoes and used high-fiber wheat tortillas. My husband praised it too!

VERY impressive!  I love the sauce!  I was hesistant @ first 'cause of the strange combo of spices, I'm so glad I tried it.  I made it for my co-workers and it was a hit!  I didn't add the capers although, looking back I would now.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I substituted w/sour cream and I used fresh dill. VERY tasty indeed!  Oh, and I used catfish. Yummy for the Tummy!

This is incredibly good!  My boyfriend and I almost ate all the servings!  Thank you very much for the recipe.  The sauce is out of this world.  And the batter is great even for Fish and Chips recipe.  I followed the recipe, but replaced the Cod with Tilapia (it's cheaper and more available here in the West Coast).

My review is for the sauce only - used store bought fish. The suace is amazing. I left out the cumin, but left everything else the same and it is delicious! I wanted to put it on everything and it was also good for dipping my fries! I used old corn tortillas from the freezer and that didn't work well, so next time I will use fresh. I also loved the cabbage, gave it a nice crunch!

Great recipe and just what we were looking for. Made a huge batch for about 12 people. Young and old all loved it. The only change I made was swapping out the dill and using fresh cilantro instead.

WOW! These were fabulously tasty! After having these for the first time in San Diego, I wanted to try making them at home.    I think they were better than ones I had in several restaurants!  I suggest making at least a double batch of the sauce, as it was wicked tasty!  Leftovers are great on chips and probably anything else.  I more than doubled the spices and went very heavy on the yogurt on the sauce.

This was a great recipe.  I did make a subsitution because my local store was out of the cod.  So, I use Pollock instead.  It still turn out great.  The sauce I doubled it and ate some with chicken tenders the following night. This is a keeper.  Thanks

These were very good! Served with flour tortillas and guacamole. Frying the fish was very messy so next time I may try the beer battered fish from the grocery store. Sweet potato fries (from Trader Joe's)on the side was a nice contrast to the spicy tacos.

San Diego native - and these are amazing fish tacos.  Since my husband makes his own fried fish - my rating is based primarily on the sauce and end result.  These are excellent fish tacos which are very very similar to the good ol' fish tacos you find in San Diego!

Used lg. mouth bass and it was delicious.  I don't even like seafood, but I liked this.  Great blending of flavors.  Was a littly wary of the capers, but went ahead anyway.  Glad I did.  My hubby is an avid fisherman, so I think I'll be using this recipe quite a bit.  Thanks!

YUM!!  I am from San Diego - born and raised and these tasted just like home to me.  I made a cilantro jalepeno sauce of 1/2 carton of sour cream, 1/2 jalapeno, big handful of cilantro, juice of 1 lime, salt and pepper.  Put into a blender until smooth and then add 3/4 cup of mayo to thicken.  With this sauce it made the fish tacos to die for.

OMG! Tanya, great job!  I live in southern California and these are dead on, especially the sauce. I have been trying to crack my favorite Mexican restaurant's fish taco sauce recipe, and this one is even better. I didn't even get as far a frying the fish (I used talapia)and decided just to grill it instead as to not distract my taste buds from the yummy texture and taste of the other ingredients. I am sure the batter is great, but for those of you looking for a lighter version - just grill it, it's just as good. :) YUMMY!!! Thanks for the recipe! I am serving this for Cinco de Mayo this weekend.

After too long a wait I finally got around to making these tasty little morsels. I did cut the amount of cayenne pepper down to 1/2 tsp. and that was spicy enough for me. The fresh lime juice in the sauce is so "perky". This is the first battered fish I have tried and I thought it was great. My son finished up the leftovers for a late snack tonight so he must have really enjoyed them. What a nice change from the usual fare!

Yum! This was so good. The white sauce is amazing. I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne because I'm not good with hot stuff and used chopped green chilies instead of jalapenoes. 
Instead of deep frying I broiled it in the oven. I also used whole wheat flour and egg beaters in the batter.

I really loved this recipe but unfortunately the rest of my family didn't. If you have very picky eaters I wouldn't recommend this recipe and especially the sauce. Saying all of that, the sauce was delicious and I loved the capers. I only wish my family had a more sophisticated pallete.

I am from San Diego and was looking for the fish taco sauce recipe!   Found it!  Great fish taco white sauce recipe!!!  The sauce is spicier than say Rubio's, but it is very tasty!  If you are a Rubio's or San Diego fish taco fan, you can make this sauce and adaot its spiciness.  We love spicy stuff and loved this sauce.  I made it with Trader Joe's Panko Breaded Tilapia and Panko breaded Shrimp using a recipe from Martha Stewart Everyday Living recipes for "Crispy Shrimp."  Keeper recipe!  Love the sauce!  Thanks!

made the batter for fish and chips, using salmon.  was very good - it stayed on the fish very well.  next time i'd cut my salmon pieces smaller, since i think that'll help with the frying.

I was really excited about making the spicy sauce after reading all these reviews. Um, it was the strangest tasting stuff ever. I made it for a dinner party, everyone said they liked it, but I am pretty sure they were all just being nice b/c I heard no one gushing about how good it was. The capers, lime, dill...too many  strong flavors together, and to go in the mayo/yogurt mixture....I was not a fan. And I usually love every sauce that's put in front of me.

These fish tacos were great!  I used ginger ale instead of the beer and cut back on the amount of cayenne pepper so the kids wouldn't think it was too spicy.  They were a big hit!

This has to be the best recipe for fish tacos I have ever found.I used halibut instead of cod.You could use any white fish you like just adjust the frying time for thickness.Do make the sauce ahead of time to merry the flavors.

It was tasty as far as flavor but I need to work on the frying part... my fish and tortillas were greasy... next time I'll try it with flour tortillas (not fried) because I think that will taste better.
**Update**
I tried this recipe again and it was FANTASTIC!!I sliced the fish into thinner filets and used flour tortillas and it was sooo good!! I served it with black beans and brown rice and can't wait to have the left overs... I'm so glad that I tried it again!!

The sauce was very good with a unique flavor.  I think I would use all mayo no yogurt next time.  Love mayo, but don't like the tang of yogurt.  Don't have a deep fryer, and hot oil scares me, so it probably wasn't as hot as it should have been.  My fish was a bit mushy although the batter was crisp.  The battered fish could have used a but more seasoning itself.  I might use the sauce again for fish. As for fish tacos, I won't be making them at home again soon - too much trouble for not as good a flavor.  Couldn't see using prepackaged frozen fish like some suggested either.

The tacos are great to me. All I would do is season fish first. The batter is different and I enjoyed it allot. I used Mahi fish and instead of sauce I mixed in a bowl Peppercorn Ranch dressing and shredded cabbage. YUM!

This was a huge hit here. My teen loved this dish. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and orange roughy and cod. Flour tortillas instead of corn. The mayo/pepper sauce was excellent! My son used about a third of it for just two tacos so be prepared to make more if your family likes it as much as mine did. I used ground chipotle pepper instead of jalapeno, about 1/4 tsp. I have been asked to fix this again. Thanks Tanya for posting this winner!

This is a very popular recipe amongst my angler friends. I bring it on our mullti-day deep sea fishing trips and prepare the tacos with fish  caught within an hour (typically sea bass, sculpin, rock cod, yellow tail or tuna). I prefer grilled fish and serve with tomatoes, lime and minced jalepenos for the crazy boyz :)

We're fans of the fish tacos from Rubio's and this is the only recipe I've found that comes close. The sauce (I made it without capers) was especially tasty. I've also made this using tilapia and it works just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't care for it, but only because I can't handle the hot peppers.  I had made this for a massive fish fry after a fishing tounament and everyone but me absolutely loved it, I had to give out the recipe many times.  I won't be making it again myself, but that didn't stop it from being a hit.  Thanks!!!

I relocated from Huntington Beach and now live outside Atlanta. I do the grilled Mahi fish tacos and I am attempting these tonight. I am so excited to see the mysterious white sauce recipe!! Thanks and I know what you mean about the tacos being either a surprise or some catfish variety down here in the South. I have converted many with the Mahi Mahi ones :)!!

These were so good!  I made the sauce as written and it was WAY too spicy!  I would decrease the cayenne/jalapeno by half next time.  We had this with a tropical fruit salad and margaritas -- YUM! :)

I was so suprised by the jalapeno.  I didnt have cayenne pepper, so I used a bit of paprika.  I will NEVER do that again!  I dont think I can use the full amount of cayenne pepper, but it does need some.  I ended up using the whole jalepeno pepper though, no seeds.  I dont like capers, so I omitted those.  The sauce was even better the next day.  I froze the leftovers, so I will see how they thaw in the next week or two.  Didnt want to waste that yummy sauce.  The batter on the fish was really yummy and thick.  I would prefer to bake these instead of fry, so I might try that next time.  Super yummy and very colorful!  Thanks!

I usually grill my fish but i went ahead and followed this recipe using mexican beer and it was fabulous! Also i didnt have any plain yogurt so i used ranch dressing instead and it turned out very flavorful! I also omitted the dill weed  and added a little extra cayenne - the sauce was super hot but i absolutely loved it this way! I used Jalapeno cheddar flour tortillas and they added even more to this!I will definitely be using this recipe again.

The sauce is amazing.  The batter for the fish was a little bland and soft.  I like a crispier batter, but my family loved this recipe.

Very good.  I ditched the dill weed, added a little sour cream and spiced up the sauce with hot taco seasoning.  We really loved it.  My husband was kinda grossed out by the thought of fish tacos.  Let me tell you he had no problem slamming down 4 of these yummy creations.  Will make again for sure.

Pretty good recipe!  I added salt and some sugar to the sauce because it seemed too tangy.  I also used swordfish, but mostly because I like it.  The sauce also works great with shrimp.  I did not fry the tortillas because I did not understand if they should be wrapped like a taco or laid flat.  I heated them in a pan and they were fine.  I will make this again.

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I too am from San Diego and I miss fish tacos ALOT. Restaurants here don't even come close to this.  Instead of frying the corn tortillas I steam them.  They stay soft and pliant just like Rubio's.

Great recipe.  To save lots of time and mess I substituted frozen breaded fish  and my family still loved the taste.  The white sauce was wonderful.  Serve with pico de gallo and sliced avacado on the side.

My husband really liked this.  My 2 younger kids weren't too fond of it, but they liked the fish by itself.  The sauce was spicy, but that's how my husband likes it.  We will definitely be eating this again in the future and can't wait to add cilantro to the tacos.  We're adding it to our recipe list.  Thanks!

I suppose I'm mainly rating the beer battering. I changed so much otherwise. I used Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve for the beer, and I used sole for the fish. Instead of deep frying it, I pan fried it in margarine and then broiled for about 7 minutes to finish off the cooking process. As far as the sauce goes-- I ended up doing fat-free sour cream with salsa, oregano and lime juice mixed in. It was kind of plain, but good. My lettuce I was going to use unfortunately went bad before I made this. So all in all, it was plain as a taco the way I made it, but the fish itself was good.

I loved this recipe.  The white sauce is phenominal.  I did not have capers, but it was fantastic anyway.  I suggest making the sauce in advance.  The flavors mix and become bolder and more delicious if it is chilled for 4-5 hours prior to serving.  I used popcorn fish bites from the grocery store rather than battering my own cod on one occasion and it was still great!

Really lite and satisfying.  Never had an S.D. taco, but next time I'm down there, on it! I used red snapper and it worked great.  Excellent sauce and good batter.  Tasty stuff.

I have tried so many white sauces for fish tacos and none were near as good as what I had in San Diego.  However, this is a recipe that really tastes like a South Beach taco that I can make at home.  I used grilled mahi mahi instead of frying the fish, and it was fantastic!

AWESOME!  These were so good.  We took a trip to Hawaii in the spring & I saw signs for fish tacos everywhere but I never got to try them.  So when I saw this recipe I had to try it!  They rock!!

These definately had me missing San Diego! Use a high-quality fish as the flavour definately comes out. Frying the fish is a bit too fatty for me to make these regularly. I might try grilling the fish next time. YUM

These are THE BEST fish tacos I have had since vacationing in Oceanside...  The sauce is REALLY good and the batter was perfect.  It was a little spicy for the kids so I will use only 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper next time. 
The only change I made was used fresh lemon juice instead of lime (didn't have on hand) and omitted the jalapeno pepper..I used a lb of talapia and fried in my cast iron skillet.  To avoid the fish fry smell in my house I had my husband fry on the grill burner outside...I also served with homemade pico de gallo...Sooooo good!!!

My husband made this recipe for my birthday dinner the other night, and they were delicious. We used pollack as the fish, and served with corn and flour tortillas. The white sauce, while yummy, was too spicy for some guests, so next time we make it for others, we will halve the jalepeno. Thank you for the recipe.

I'm only rating the sauce because I decided not to deep fry but to blacken the fish using cajun seasonings. This sauce was awesome and it made for a perfect lunch for me today. Loved it Tanya and thank you!

Had company over and was in a hurry so I used McCormicks Beer Batter mix instead. Our friends ate until it was all gone! When they left my husband asked me to go to the store and get somemore fish for dinner the next day. We feasted again!! The white sauce is supreme. (it's my family's new favorite dinner) Brings back memories of Corpus Christi summer of 93 :)

Just had this tonight and really enjoyed it. I liked the different flavors that you got with the fried fish, cabbage, warm taco shell, and cold sauce. My husband loved the beer battered fish and after eating two tacos went back for more fish. I followed recipe pretty closely except omitted capers, used red cabbage, and only used a small portion of the jalapeno. It was still plenty spicy for us. It is a little time consuming so will not be a staple in our meal planning but I will definitely make it again.

We fixed this dish with a spicy mango salsa and used sour cream instead of yogurt.  We used flounder pan cooked in a little olive oil instead of breaded and fried. It was fantastic!

My sister and I made this for dinner for a family get together and everyone absolutely loved it. We did two things different though; we used Tilapia and since not too many of us are fond of cabbage we used regular iceberg lettuce.  Awesome recipe!

Truthfully, I didn't do the fish. I used good quality frozen breaded fillets and then served them on tortillas with the sauce and shredded cabbage. These tacos are so good! It is a wonderful, easy supper that my family loves. It has become a regular at our house. Maybe one of these days I'll actually batter and fry the fish myself, we'll see!

This beer batter was wonderful!  it is light and fluffy after the fish is fried.  I used Talapia fish instead of cod and it was great.  I did not use the white sauce, I used my own but I used everything else the recipe called for.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

I loved this recipe!! We used the fish sticks from Costco that are panko breaded Wild Alaskan Pollock. I will have to try the fish part of this recipe when I have more time. The flavors were amazing! My family devoured them. Thank you for sharing.

We made this recipe as written and really enjoyed it. There are a few tweaks that we will make the next go round, one being to season the fish to our liking. We went really light as we weren’t sure how it would turn out. And next time we want to try this with cod as it is a meatier fish - we only had tilapia on hand.

Wow!!!! First time making fish tacos, first time deep frying fish! So delicious, rivaled any street taco I've ever had! Only thing that could make it better would be some home made pico de gallo! I thinned out the batter with a bit more beer for easier handling and coating. Will make this again and again!! I also halved the jalapeño for my audience who doesn't like spice so much.

This is a Great make for  any fish on the hook. Spice up the batter a bit  or throw on an Asian Slaw that you can pull up on the site as well! I added Chipotle Chili powder to the batter as well as Mrs Dash's Garlic and Herb seasoning. This recipe is timeless and very versatile any time of the year!

I beg for forgiveness in advice. I did not make fish tacos. BUT I did fry Alaskan Cod using this recipe. I lived in England 30 years ago and have tried many recipes attempting to replicate cod from the chip shop. This is it!! This is The Best fried fish I have ever made. Thank you for posting this!

My husband has never had fish tacos, he's a bbq chicken kind of guy and i made these and didn't tell him what they were at first and he ate so many he couldn't move! He loved them and my favorite was the sauce. The only changes i made was i didnt add the dill seasoning or capers, flavors i don't care for, and i added 1/4 cup sour cream to sauce and then pan fried in grapeseed oil. I added a corn and bean salsa at the end which really paired well with the sauce.. Simply amazing.

I fed these to my souhern california born and raised husband and we loved them! I did make a couple of changes, I ran out of cod so I fried up some shrimp using the same batter---we actually liked the shrimp better (it turned out crispier). Also I didn't have yogurt so I substituted sour cream and mixed the sauce ingredients in with the cabbage to make a slaw. The tacos were perfect on corn tortillas with an ice cold beer.

Very good and very easy. Everything came out perfectly. The white sauce, in combination with the fish and cabbage, was perfect. It's amazing how such unique ingredients pair so well together. I would suggest a fair bit more salt for both the fish and batter, but overall this was well received!

I made this last night & they were great! My husband loved them- said they were by far the best fish tacos he has ever had.  I had fresh wild caught cod.  I followed the recipe completely but left out the capers and dill weed, just because I did not have it on hand.  The batter is thick but it coats nicely.  I filled the pan with oil and heated it up before I added the fish.  They browned nicely.  The dressing came out really good.  I used Hellmans with cannola oil and fage plain yogurt along with the spices and jalapeno.  I will definitely make this again and add the capers and dill weed.

Used this recipe solely for the sauce and even after I halved it, there was enough for at least 4 people.  Loved the recipe and will definitely be making it again!

OMG! We didn't have cod, but plenty of bass fish and  We Loved it! Deep Fried them. We didn't have cabbage, but used lettuce and tomatoes. The looks of the fish are very appealing and tastes So Good! The sauce was the Best we ever had! Can't wait for next Friday to make again! Thank You for sharing!

I have been making this for some time now and my whole family LOVES them. I have made them with the beer battered fish, baked cod and grilled cod; all of which have been equally amazing. Follow the instructions and you will not regret trying this!!! Like others have stated, 5 stars is not good enough for this one. :) Thank you for sharing!

Awesome recipe! The first time I had fish tacos was from the street vendors in Ensenada and I was hooked. Bad pun aside, these bought back memories from many years ago and I will be making them often. I especially like recipes that are simply and quick, and yet present nicely for company. This is definitely one of those recipes. Thanks for posting!

One of my most favorite recipes on this site! I can't tell u how much I enjoy these tacos with my family. The only thing I would advice is to season the batter with a little salt n pepper because it is a little bland but other than that super fantastic!

This recipe was good, my wife and kids enjoyed it but would rather use tilapia over cod. Will make it again with grilled tilapia. By the way, the sauce was really great.

This was good but a LOT of prep work ahead of time and during. I had another couple in for dinner last night and we could not all eat at the same time. Maybe I should have done more fish and put in a low oven until there was enough. Many compliments tho so well worth it. I wish the tortillas had been more crisp, but that could have been the brand I chose at the store. They were sort of limp and tore easily.

I made the sauce exactly as written, and it was so delicious!  I have never made fish tacos myself, but I sure have eaten some really great ones just over the border.  These brought me back to my college days :)  I served with chopped cabbage on a corn tortilla, but we also enjoyed them with slices of avacado.

The best fish tacos, hands down!  I love the white sauce, and I also make a pico to go along with it.  I also subbed sour cream for the yogurt, since that's what I had on hand.  Delish!

I did not care for the white sauce; I can only taste cayenne pepper!  I didn't add the dill because I am not a fan. This sauce is nothing like I'm used to.

Great sauce! I just used halibut and gilled it to keep calories down. The sauce was amazing, I did use less Mayo and think you could even not use any at all and it would be great.

This is the best fish taco recipe out there!  My husband and son love it (and of course me).  We do have to half the cayenne - way too spicy!  We love to use Kobe, but we've also made it with cod and dover sole.  Really, any white fish does well.  And we've discovered the flour/corn mixed tortillas work best to fry.  Delicious!

Love this recipe, though I modified the fish portion.  I season a filet and grill or pan fry it. Pan grill the tortilla. Also can top with salsa and guacamole. The sauce is the secret and is excellent!  I've made without the capers - with is good too!  Have also used 75%yogurt blend.  Garnish with cilantro. Highly recommend, has made my family a fish taco loving crew!

We live on the East Coast and had never tried fish tacos before, and this was the first recipe I found on AllRecipes.  My teenage boys were skeptical to say the least, but we all loved it.  That said; I'm not good at deep frying, and one of my sons can't have gluten, so I had to modify the batter recipe for him.  I finally just gave up and now I just substitute the fried fish with blackened tilapia.  The first time I did it, we all missed the crunch of the fried batter a bit, but now several times later, no one even remembers that's the way they're supposed to be made, and it's much healthier without it!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!!!! I made it as written except for using what I had on hand in a few places: I did not have a jalapeno pepper so I used a few drops of chipotle Tabasco. I also used spring mix greens instead of cabbage, and talapia instead of cod. My whole family LOVED these! Will def make again!!

These are amazing. If you want to be healthy dont fry use an electric griddle. They were amazing on the griddle. Spread the white sauce, then the fish then the cabbage. This is a MUST in my house every 2 weeks.

We live in the midwest and don't usually see fish tacos on menus here. But I've been curious about them for years. I saw this recipe and decided to give it a go. These fish tacos were SO TASTY!! I loved the crunch of the fish. The recipe is quite easy as well. I had both soft and hard taco shells. My husband liked the soft and I liked the hard. We'll definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome. Batter very light & husband couldn't stop eating the fish!  Subbed sour cream for yogurt & crema was awesome too. The lime juice makes it. I also added some finely chopped cilantro. Also made some homemade quacamole that went well with all of it too. Excellent recipe.

We prepared everything as called for but only used about 1/4 cup oil in a nonstick pan .  It didn't come out quite as crispy as it probably would have with a full fry but it still had a nice crust and was really tasty!!

Neither one cared for this as a whole. The fish alone was good - batter was light and crispy (until the fish cooled) but needed more sesoning. In our opinion the sauce ruined the dish. Sadly, we won't be making it again.

The sauce is delicious!  I've made this a few times, and brought samples in to work to brag.  I've made the sauce w/ and w/o jalapenos, and usually cut the cayenne a tiny bit for my family.  I haven't done the actual beer-battered fish yet, but it works well w/ grilled fish or, on a lazy night, fish sticks!

Yum! This beer batter is awesome. I wish i had made my pieces of fish smaller though. The white sauce was yummy with a dash of cayenne (kids). I chopped up a zucchini to use the rest of the beer batter, and it was delicious.

Favorite fish taco recipe. My husband lived in San Diego before we got married and he said nothing compares like this recipe.  I like the sauce a bit hotter so I add a little more jalapeño.  On healthier days I have also used baked/grilled/broiled fish and it is just as good with a healthier feel.

The white sauce wasn't exactly the taste I was going for.  Little disappointed about that because I had fish tacos in a restaurant where the sauce was delicious and I was hoping I had found it in this recipe.  On the whole though not a bad recipe at all and glad I tried it.  Thanks Breese823!

Very good!!! I didn't have beer so I used seltzer water and the fish was excellent! I would use less mayo for the sauce though next time.  Hut besides that I loved it!

Love this batter!!! My boyfriend is from mexico and he LOVES these tacos.  I make a different cream sauce and put on our favor toppings. I do add adobo seasoning to the flour mix or put it on the fish before I batter them, for added flavor, but the great thing about recipes is tweaking them to suit your flavor.

I have tried this recipe just as it is. It is always a big hit. The sauce is out of this world and goes perfectly. Though I am intrigued to try it with grilled fish. Seems easier and less messy to make. But awesome just as it is written.

I cheated and used a breaded Talapia from Sam's.  I also skipped the capers.  The sauce was very good and I will definitely make it again.

Beautiful light and crispy batter!  We had some Tilapia we wanted to cook up- and I found this recipe.  Worked great with the tilapia- and, I imagine, any other white firm fish.  Delish!!!

Really awesome recipe! Loved the beer batter, not to thick just perfect! & also loved the sauce.  The family loved it!  Even my 2 year old ate it all up... he liked the fish on it's own.  I am going to use the beer batter recipe when I make fish $ chips next time, it was just the perfect batter.

Excellent! Delicious tacos. I was a little leary because I had never fried anything before and I didn't have a deep fryer. So I just fried the fish in a skillet. Came out great!

I never had fish tacos; so glad I tried this.  I was afraid of too much heat in the sauce, so used only half a jalapeno.  It was just right for our family's tastes. 
I'll make this often.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I use self-rising flour and beer to make a smooth batter. I do not use the other flour or egg. Just make sure the fish are patted dry before putting in the batter. Let them rest at least 10 minutes before frying.  Makes the recipe much easier.

Cooked one filet without batter in the Forman and the other I deep fried in a iron skillet. Both turned out great, but the fried was definitely tastier.

This was great!  I substituted a couple of the ingredients (red hot pepper sandwich toppers for the jalapeño chili) and since I didn't have any limes, I used margarita mix (just a little mixed with water and added about 3 tablespoons for the lime juice).  Also, instead of cod, I used tilapia, and Greek yogurt.  Tasted as good as I've had in Mexican restaurants.  Thanks.

Best fish tacos EVER- I used halibut instead of cod only because that's what I had on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly, my whole family devoured them all and were begging for more :) :)

THANK YOU BREESE823- you're recipe is amazing and I thank you so much for sharing!!! :) :)

This was AWESOME!!!!!  My husband loved it and so did the baby.  :)  I didn't have the cornstarch so I just omitted it and the batter was fine without it.  The batter went on really thick so I scraped alot of it off, it only takes a tiny bit of batter.  It cooks really quick.  The sauce is AMAZING!!!!!  The sauce combined with the beer battered fish really makes this dish!  Can't say enough about how good the sauce is...INCREDIBLE!  I used a whole jalapeño, about 3.5 inches long, and it wasn't too spicy at all.  The capers went in fine, too, and I went heavy on the cumin because I LOVE cumin.  I used Mexican crema instead of yogurt and it was great.  The consistency wasn't runny, like the recipe said, it was very creamy and delicious.  I also didn't have the dill but didn't miss it, perhaps it would have been even more amazing with it, haha!  I didn't fry the tortillas, just warmed them, and this all came together so quick, it was great.  Oh, also, I didn't deep-fry, I pan fried the fish in whole fillets, then chopped it up to put in the tacos.  Great, great, great.  I added chopped cilantro and sliced avocado to top the tacos off, and it was a hit!

OMG!  Best Fish Tacos I have ever eaten!  I followed the recipe with the exception of the tortillas, cabbage and capers. I only had flour tortillas on hand so I used those instead of the corn. I didn't have capers on hand either so I used sour pickles as a substitute. I didn't have cabbage so I substituted iceberg lettuce. It was nice and crunchy and absolutely delicious. I will make this again with all the ingredients called for in the recipe. I also think this would be great with grilled fish.

Yum! Battered the fish, left out the cayenne and capers from the sauce. Used sour cream instead of yogurt. Added sliced avocado on the taco and a little green Tabasco and a coleslaw mix. Best fish taco EVER.

I found this recipe a few years back and I just loved it. I don't put capers in the sauce and it still comes out great. I usually make pico as we'll. I made it for my husbands family and they loved it. Our nephew just kept eating the fish (I use tilapia)  so even if you don't want fish tacos this is a good way to make fish for fish and chips or just fish. Plus I put a few slices of avocado can't forget that

My review is just for the sauce (I used Gorton's battered fish portions since it was for a party and I didn't want to be tied to the kitchen), and it was terrific!  I didn't have dill but it was still wonderful!

I try really hard to make a recipe as stated but I just couldn't with this one mostly because I didn't have items on hand and this was a much needed quick recipe for dinner. That being said - it was very good!  The key ingredient is the sauce.  I must say that I am not a big fan of fish tacos but my husband is.  So, here's what you can do in a real pinch - use frozen fish.  I was trying to use it up before the date.  This was fish in a box so it certainly wasn't fancy.  We used lettuce because we didn't have cabbage and again, I will state the key is the sauce.  It saved this whole hodge podge dinner.  Can't wait to make this again exactly as stated.  It could only get better.  I will use flour tortillas next time (personal preference).

This recipe was super yummy.  I didn't have limes, so I used lemon.....and I didnt have yogurt so I used sour cream, and I also added a tablespoon or so of ranch for an extra kick .  In place of the cabbage I used fresh spinach leaves.  soooo good.

OMG! Delicious is not the word.  I didn't make the batter, just dipped the tilapia in milk and panko crumbs.  It's the sauce that makes it, though.  Added some red and yellow peppers along with purple cabbage for color.  A little avocado and pico to top it off.  Good Eats!

The beer batter posted is excellent.  However, it is sufficient for at least 2 pounds of fish.  Otherwise, the taste is amazing.

I've used this recipe for years, and love it mostly for the sauce, but I gotta add my 2 cents here. I PROMISE you will love this...I pan fry talapia with a little Panko. Sometimes I substitute shrimp. Melt a little sharp cheddar cheese on the tortilla before you pile on your toppings.  Now...include the following for your toppings: shredded red cabbage, cilantro, avocado, and bleu cheese crumbles.  AWESOME.  Also, for my sauce, I use plain greek yogurt rather than plain yogurt.

I used frozen shrimp instead of cod. I added extra lime and cayenne to the sauce because it was too sweet for my liking. Instead of frying in beer batter, I dipped the shrimp in panko bread crumbs & salt, and pan fried in olive oil for a healthier version. I also replaced the cabbage coleslaw with a premade black bean salad.

It was delightful!

First, let me preface... I'm not a fish lover. I'm the one that always gets the bone! But this recipe hit me on two levels. I mastered deep fry and I loved the tacos! Everyone is right, the sauce makes it! So delicious! Gave me great ideas for fish and chips, too! Loved it!!

These fish tacos were incredible. As others stated, the sauce absolutely makes it. I added a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper and fresh cilantro to the existing recipe. For the fish, I am too lazy to batter and fry. I bought battered filets but my daughter ate them before I had chance to make this so I just baked Tilapia in Wegmans basting oil, salt and pepper. I used Wegmans Asian Slaw for the cabbage. I served them with the sauce, slaw, avacado, red onion and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Delicious, this recipe was a big hit in my house. This is a keeper.

I have never had fish tacos before so I was a little hesitant.  No worries though because these were DELICIOUS.  As other reviewers said, the white sauce was great.  My in laws are coming for a week and I plan on making these.

Was a good fish taco, but I thought just too much work for the amount of flavor in the dish. The beer batter was excellent and the sauce was pretty good, but probably won't make again. However, if I did ever make again, I would most likely try the suggestion by a reviewer for half yogurt, sour cream and some horseradish mixed in.

OMG, I had to literally force my bf to try these as he has always been against them, lol. He was blown away and wanted them again the next night!!! They were amazing.....the crunchiness of the batter with the spicy tangy of the sauce and the crispiness of the cabbage was just perfect!!!! One of best recipes ever!

This beer batter was way too thick.  If you go with the 3 oz. pieces of fish, when it's done frying you have more batter on the fish than fish itself.  I would suggest pan frying with a dusting of flour or just broiling/grilling the fish.  Less time, less mess, healthier.  The sauce was ok, I prefer others for fish tacos.

I was really not expecting to like this but I figured at worst I could have fried fish and lose the rest so I tried it.

I really loved it the batter turned out perfect and was very easy to make. 

On the sauce I found that it's a little spicier than I would like and next time I will cut the cayenne back by about 1/4. Possibly because it was so spicy there was way more sauce than I needed. Not a problem I froze the rest and used for the next batch. It actually tamed it down a little bit. so if you freeze leftover sauce expect it to be less spicy when you thaw it. Other then that it was just like it was fresh.

I live in New Mexico where there is a high standard for fish tacos and these were by far the best I have EVER had. I made a few minor changes, substituting dried dill for fresh, omitting the cayenne pepper and instead of just cabbage I shredded some green cabbage, purple cabbage, cilantro and some very small snacking bell peppers from my garden and used that as a very fresh slaw on top to add even more freshness and crunch. To DIE for!

This is probably one of the best home made fish taco recipes I have ever made/ate. Very "fresh" tasting and flavorful. The only suggestion I might make is to cut the jalapeno and Cheyenne pepper measurements in half for those who don't like things too spicy. oh and top it off with some fresh cilantro!

I loved the sauce on this recipe. I believe I make a pretty good fish taco already( i just cook them in a pan seasoned with lemon pepper and garlic), so I didn't use the beer batter part. But the sauce was exactly what it needed, loved it and will make it again in a heartbeat!

This review is for the overall fish taco.  I did not batter my cod so I cannot comment on the batter.  I chose to broil mine for a little healthier version.  I used grape seed oil, lime juice, cumin, and old bay seasoning  and brushed my mixture on both sides, then broiled.  Excellent.  I made the tacos with the white sauce and cabbage and let me tell you... you will be inventing new ways to use this sauce!!!  5+ stars for the amazing sauce and it pairs so well with the cabbage.  Wonderful meal

Made these last night and had we closed our eyes, would have thought we were back in San Diego at Rubio's Fish Tacos!  Just outstanding.  I used light sour cream for the yogurt as well.  Cut back 1/2 on the jalapeño and cayenne even though I love spicy.  Scared the heat would be too much for my family.  Will add the correct amount on the cayenne next time.  I also used walleye for the fish.   Added in chopped cilantro.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This was very good, we really enjoyed it.  I used ginger ale instead of beer since I didn't have any sitting around that I felt like sacrificing.

We have been using this recipe for our fish tacos at our lent fish fries for 3 years, they are sooo good! Everyone loves them! I think it's the major draw! I added a few chipotle peppers, chopped, and cilantro to the sauce. The spiciness is a perfect complement to the fish and chopped cabbage. We add some shredded cheddar cheese because I think cheese should be added to everything.

I made this gluten free by substituting the 1 cup flour with 3/4 cup brown rice flour and 1/4 cup sorghum flour. And I used Green's GF Amber Ale in place of the beer. I also substituted the mayo for Veganaise, because of other allergies. It was great!!! The second time I made it I forgot to put in the baking powder, but it was still good. Also, I didn't have any jalapeños or capers, so I left that out, the sauce was awesome even without it. Also, I used tilapia because it was on sale, and again... Great!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! To save on calories, trans fat and room for dessert, sprinkle fish fillets with seasoned salt and BAKE. Do not fry. Takes approx. 15 minutes in the oven at 350, depending on size of fillets. Wonderful variation to regular tacos!

These are better than rubios, the coating for the fish is light and crisp, and the sauce is to die for, we use it for dressing and dip as well. Yum~ee. From one San Diego girl to another! Thank you Breese!

Heres the deal. Marinated cubed Tilapia with canola oil,chopped jalepeno,chili powder, lime juice and chopped cilantro for 20 min. Throw on a grill pan at 400 degrees, sprinkle kosher salt on fish pieces as they come out. Used sour cream instead of yogurt( thats all I had)and used the coleslaw mix in the bag(no dressing)-added thinly sliced red onion, fresh salsa and cilantro on flour tortillas(use the small ones!)    Amazing! My boyfriend who hates fish tacos went back 4 times!!

Yummy!  First time I've ever beer-battered fish and it was delicious!  Used halibut and served them in fish tacos, but could easily serve on their own.  Next time I'm going to try the white sauce too (not enough time today).

Soo good. I made a double amount of the sauce as suggested by many others. Everyone Loved these. I used Mahi mahi instead of cod, and the next day i made a dip with the sauce and leftover pico de gallo. That was yummy too!

I had fish taco's while in Maui and wanted to try them at home. I used shredded lettuce and cilantro and a mix of cheeses with tomato for toppings and everyone loved it. The video makes it super easy, the batter and sauce were fantastic, I fish and had fresh halibut and salmon to use so it was a combination of two types of fish and they were awesome, I fried them in peanut oil, thank you!

This recipe is very easy and delicious. Anytime I ask my husband what he wants for dinner he requests these fish tacos! We typically use a smaller amount of cabbage and add shredded cheese.

I didn't bread our fish, I grilled Mahi, but the white sauce is to die for!!! We didn't make ours spicy due to our son, ans we garnished with fresh roasted chilies!! It was so super yummy!
This is a keeper.

The beer batter for this fish is so addictive it will send you to AA. Don't eat and drive, not because you're drunk, obviously, but because you are so full of delicious goodness it would really be a buzz kill to be stuck in traffic. I used hard tacos and flour tortillas since I'm not crazy about corn tortillas... I'm corny enough.

I liked the beer batter on the fish.  It was easy to make and tasted good.  I did not care for the sauce. I suppose I was expecting more than I should have from reading all the reviews but it tasted like............yogurt to me...............and I had to add double the spices and a few drops of Chipotle Tabasco to make it edible.  I am really sorry for the low rating but I was a bit disappointed  :(

Excellent sauce! 1/4 Tsp cayenne was plenty for us. Pan fried tilapia bites coated in flour, s&p in garlic EVOO then wrapped with cabbage slaw and sauce in corn tortillas. YUM!

Love it! I have both baked and grilled the fish rather than frying it, which makes a much healthier meal option. Very quick and easy and the sauce is great. Best served with some pico de gallo in addition to the cabbage and sauce, and then finally topped with a squeeze from a lime wedge!

These were awesome - reminded me of fish tacos in Mexico.  We used fresh caught Northern Pike (Jackfish).  Left out the capers and Oregano b/c we were at the lake - limited resources.  Also used a bag of Coleslaw mix for convenience instead of cabbage.  I added my own Pico De Gallo.  Even the kids (4-6) couldn't stop eating these.  Next time, we need to catch more fish!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! We added sliced jalapeños, avocados and a squeeze of lime.

You may want to season you fish prior to breading.

Delish. I panfried, following other's reviews of marinating with lime juice, s&p, and olive oil instead of battering

The fish didnt seem like enough when it was grilled this way, and it flaked apart - which didnt really matter once it was all wrapped up in the wrap

I toned down the spice, and made a little pico de gallo http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pico-de-gallo/

yum yum

the 5 stars is really for the sauce! I thought 1 tsp of the cayenne pepper would be a bit too hot for our tastes and cut it back to 1/2 tsp...but other than that made as listed The sauce is awesome. The fish batter is very close to the one I already use but mine has garlic in it too... so I also sprinkled in some garlic powder. I did not use cod.had mahi mahi and tilapia on hand so used the fish I had. PS: Had leftover sauce and used it on chicken burgers another night....added great zip to boring chicken patties too!

D-licious! I fried already battered catfish for a southern twist, so I didn't get to try the beer battered fish. However, the white sauce is amazing! These tacos tasted like I got them from a five star restaurant. It's probably the best meal I have cooked for myself so far.

I made the recipe exactly as written, except for oregano which i did not have on-hand. 
The white sauce MADE this dish. I want to dip absolutely EVERYTHING in it. So darn delish!
This was my first experience with beer batter. I did enjoy the fish, but will probably make this recipe using grilled fish next time. The beer batter was a bit much, even though I tried to go lightly with my coating.
Overall, the meal was a success and, of course, the white sauce a HUGE hit. I will be making it again.

To be honest, I also used frozen battered fish, but the rest of the recipe is awesome!  As other reviewers have said, the white sauce really makes it.

This is a very good and simple recipe.  I added some extra spices (mainly cumin and hot pepper), black beans, sliced avocado, red bell pepper (to the slaw), fresh salsa, cilantro, and lots of lime.  For the fish breading I used brown rice flour (instead of AP), 1/2 c beer, 1 egg, a dash of brown sugar, and flavored it with lots of cumin, hot pepper, and some salt.  FANTASTIC!!  I highly recommend giving this a try!

This review is for the sauce only, I didn't make the fish this way.  This sauce is amazing!!  I added more cumin because I love cumin!  The spice was perfect, the right amount of heat and flavor for fish tacos!

Toddler approved! My picky 4 year old even asked for seconds (I didn't add the jalapeno to his sauce). I also substituted low fat sour cream for the yogurt since I didn't have any yogurt.

Yummy!  Like other reviewers, the white sauce was the kicker here.  I grilled the fish to make it lighter.  The white sauce can be used for lots of other dishes too...wonderful!

First time I followed the recipe exactly and it was ok. I gave the version with my (easy) modifications 5 stars: don't deep fry the fish. Just fry it on the pan till it's ready. Only put 1/3 of a tea spoon of cayenne pepper. Also I replaced beer with chicken broth and plain yogurt with sour cream. It was very good

Fantastic recipe! Relativly quick and easy and the sauce was gone once we all tried it. We did doctor it a bit and add some fresh black pepper to the sauce for a little kick to the front end. Overall the meal was light and delicious.

used fat free plain yogurt and light mayo for the sauce.  I added a full 3 TB lime juice and omitted the jalapenos (for the kids) and the capers (didn't have any).  I'm rating this one 4 stars for the sauce alone as I baked the cod rather than frying it (calories).  I'm sure fried fish would be delicious with the sauce.  I sprinkled frozen cod with chili powder, salt and pepper and poured a bit of lime juice over the top (before the seasoning).  Good, not great.  Probably prefer the cod on its own unless frying.

THESE ARE AMAZING!!  My 13 year old daughter took one bite and was in love with them. I followed most of the recipe except I made my own breading, didn't use capers bc I was out of them, and used tilapia because it was much cheaper.  They came out sooooo good!  These will be a new favorite around here.

As a San Diegan, I had to choose this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except cooking in a cast iron pan because I don't own a deep fryer. The fish turned out perfect!! So yummy :) The sauce also turned out good. I omitted the jalapeno, capers, and dill because I didn't have and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne (because I'm a gringa). And I added cilantro and avocado. Yummy! I can't think of any way this could taste better! Bravo! Thanks!

I've used everything from fresh fish to shrimp to fish sticks (on a reall lazy day) and I always get raves from the eating audience.  I purchase corn tortillas, warm them up in a dry frying pan one at a time, and let people build their own tacos.  If you're out of slaw mix or cabbage, just finely chop some lettuce.  Want to use salsa as well?  Go for it!  This is a great basic recipe with an amazing sauce!

I too am from San Diego, I have tried making fish tacos at home and I could never get them to turn out quite right. This was so spot on and really easy to follow. The fish turned out perfect and the sauce was awesome. We like our tacos with avocados and cilantro.

This is the best sauce!!I confess that I typically use frozen beer battered fish instead of making my own, just for time sake. Still turns out great! The sauce I make two batches one everything but jalapeños and cayenne (since my husband and son don't like spice). And the second batch with everything for me and my daughter.

Great recipe! I found the sauce to be a tad hot (I love spicy heat) if you were making it for people who don't like heat. Cutting back a 1/2 tsp may help.

I added guacamole, it was delicious!!!

I made these last night for guests.  They said they were the best fish tacos they ever had.  I followed the recipe, except left the capers out of the sauce and added a little bit of sour cream to the yogurt and mayonnaise.  I also made the shrimp and crab enchiladas and they were a hit as well.

I love this recipe!  The sauce is amazing, reminds me of the sauce at one of my favorite restaurants.  I've made this several times, and have changed it up a bit every once in a while.  I've used fresh Cod, Pollock and even Salmon and have grilled the fish  instead of frying with the batter (to make it a little healthier).  I've even added a little bit of red wine vinegar to the cabbage to give it a little punch.  But the sauce is what really makes the tacos.  YUMMY!

Wonderful! This recipe is a keeper. We deep fried the cod (made for a stinky kitchen) and the fish was was light and tasty . We also used tostada shells for a fun alternative. I loved the white sauce though my husband thought we could've left out the dill and added more cumin.

I just broil my fish instead of frying it, use flour tortillas and add diced tomato.  I keep the sauce the same and it is awesome!!!  I will usually save what is left in the fridge and will use it for other things.  People rave about this every time I make it

I made this for my husband last night and he loved it. He said it was better than the local fish taco joint. The batter was amazing (I used Bohemia beer) and the sauce was delicious. I also made some pico de gallo salsa to go on top. I will definitely be making this again.

The sauce wasnt good and the combination of that and the fish and everything else wasnt good. I believe, for me, the sauce ruined it.

EPIC!!! We still talk about these fish tacos and how amazing they were. These do indeed taste like So. Cal :) FYI: fried fish freezes well and reheats in the oven as if heating "fish sticks". We did this with the leftover fish and had tacos for the next few days.

This recipe was great! I didn't have baking soda and I don't drink/use alcohol so I used water for the batter and the fish came out golden and crispy. I used Goya Adobo seasoning with pepper for the salt and flavor. I also made a tomato salsa to put on top. Will definitely make this again!

Awesome fish taco's and the white sauce is so good.  I sub'd 1/4 tsp cayenne powder for the jalapenos and the store didn't have them, it was great.  Want to try them with some cajun spice next time

The family loved this!  Blackened the fish for my non-flour-eating members, and used the beer batter for those who still indulge.  Both loved the white sauce.  A new family favorite I will be making again.  Thanks for sharing!

I am also from San Diego, and I do fish tacos just about like this. I do not use egg in the batter, and use a green chili cheese sauce with jack cheese, small can of mild green chili's, jalapenos, lime, sour cream and blended up. Vary amounts to your liking. I also do the tortillas in the hot oil for just a few seconds to get them hot.

Love this recipe! The batter is amazing. I don't care much for mayonnaise in the sauce, so I replace the mayo with one avocado. Mix well and enjoy! Yum.

I have been looking for a fish taco recipe and if I could give this a 10 I would.  The only change I used was that I replaced the yogurt with sour cream.  The family is already asking when they can have it next week.  Sauce is a bit zippy..My husband and I loved it but my daughter used sour cream and still loved them.  Thanks

I live in San Diego as well and these are BY FAR the best fish tacos I have ever had. I used tilapia instead of cod (that's what I had on hand) left out the jalapenos because I have a sensitive palate and added lime zest to the white sauce but kept everything else as-is. It was so amazing, so tasty, so perfect.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I had a lot of trouble getting some ingedrients for the sauce beacuse I live in a small town,I used paprika instead of cayenne pepper and didn't use any capers . It was so good even without those ingredients! Mom couldn't stop to make compliments about how good was the fish (wich wasn't cod btw) with the beer batter.
THANKS A LOT! i love allrecipes.com !

TACOS/FISH:
UPDATE:  Made these a second time and noticed the flour I had used was "better for bread" flour.  Well there was my problem!  So I went and got a proper all purpose flour and these were just perfect perfect perfect! I cooked mine till they are a little darker than needed because I like it extra crispy.  These were a total hit with everyone I made them for!! 

ORIGINAL: Made recipe exactly as described.  At first I tasted a fish taco right after i took it out, w/out any taco fixins.  I was kind of bummed cuz it seemed almost doughy.  However, once put in a taco w/ sauce and cabbage, etc, it was PERFECT. It's not a fish n chips type batter, but its awesome and I'll make it again.

SAUCE:  Made exactly as shown.  I made that first and let it sit in the fridge to let the flavors merge and it was SO good.  Used it the next day for grilled fish tacos as well. I'll prob make this sauce for other stuff too, i loved it!

I have used this recipe for about two years now.  Its the best i have found.  I did cut out the capers from the sauce.  But everyone loves my fish tacos.  The sauce is the best part, we put it on everything.  Sometimes we just make the sauce for plain tacos.

I tried several different recipes for fish tacos, but this is the best!  My entire family gets very excited when the see it on the menu, and any leftover dressing makes a tasty chip or veggie dip!

First, yay for San Diego!  No one knows fish tacos like we do!

I've been looking for fish taco recipes for a long time, and finally decided to make this one for my mom and her boyfriend.  They're Mexican, so I was kind of nervous about screwing it up.  But I followed this recipe to the T with one small modification -- I used sour cream instead of yogurt -- and it turned out delish!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'd have to admit I was skeptical about this recipe but wanted to try something new for dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly as written but added my homemade pico de gallo on top and they were absolutely delicious. My husband and kids are already asking when I will be making this again.

This recipe is great!  My second time using it. My kids love it!  The white sauce is amazing!  The battered fish is delicious!  Any time you can get kids to eat fish, it's wonderful.  Great recipe for when you want a light meal. Especially in the summer time.

4 stars

I found this recipe getting close to capturing the dish, but the batter was a little bland and seemed to absorb more oil than I'd like.  Could be I didn't use a thermometer to assure the heat recommended. (?)  I used safflower oil to get nice heat without smoking and kept it at medium heat.  I could have used a recommendation for amount of time for frying, but "until browned" worked ok, fish was not over or under cooked.   Next time I would add a little more salt and add garlic powder to  the batter dry ingredients.  

The sauce was wonderful until I added the cayenne, it tasted uncooked and flat.  If more heat is desired, I would go with more jalapeno.  I've used about 1 tsp cajun spiced butter from the grocery store (by the fish counter where I shop) for this flavor and it works better.   The lime was sublime. Next time:  fresh dill.  I find cumin overpowering, especially uncooked, so I omitted it.  

 This recipe does not include ingredients for Pico (cabbage, onion, cilantro, tomato, jalapeno, lime, salt and pepper).  So, you haven't lived until you have it with pico on top of it.  The contrasting flavors of cilantro, cabbage, lime, crisp fish and corn tortillas is amazing.  Although some in my family prefer flour tortillas, and this is pretty good as well.  

There is definite promise here, I'd like to see a little more healthy options for it and the spices fine tuned.

I took frozen breaded haddock, and put it into the pizza oven.  We made the yogurt sauce, decreasing the cayenne.  In addition, I made a simple tomato salsa: tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno, onion, vinegar, lime juice, & sugar.  The combination was heavenly.  I also made a mango salsa.  Both salsas with the yogurt sauce was delicious.  We do not like corn tortillas, so we served it with flour tortillas, and lettuce (no cabbage).  It was quick, easy, and amazing.  Why fuss with the mess!  A pizza oven gives it a nice crisp on both sides, unlike the conventional oven.  I have left over sauce, and salsa.  Can't wait to try it with blackened tuna and grilled salmon.

I actually only used this recipe for the sauce...and it was outstanding!!! I did substitute the jalapeno for 1 1/2 tsp of red pepper (only because I didn't have jalapenos on hand) and added more dill, threw everything in the food processor and it came out great!

I have looked for a long time for a fish taco recipe that was equal to the flavor and quality of Arizona's fish tacos. The problem always seemed to lie in the sauce & here you are!! This recipe nails it!! The capers and the dill with the jalapenos - - - excellent! 5 stars, for sure!

Absolutely Delicious! Although, I found the frying to be a bit complicated in the beginning. It took four or five pieces of "practice fish" before I finally semi-perfected the frying method. Nevertheless, all my guests enjoyed the meal!

This recipe is wonderful.  We first had fish tacos when we visited SD for our son's graduation from MCRD San Diego.  Used less oil in a frying pan and tilapia instead of cod.  Terrific!!

These are awesome. Ever since I found this recipe it has been a dish we make every other week. The only changes I made are: I use my own fish batter recipe, I use savoy cabbage because it is a little softer in texture and taste, I use 2 times the amount of spices. This is a winner always.

We followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing! we also tried different topping options like homemade salsa, avocado, cilantro, and shredded cheese - all of which were great additions. We'll be adding this to our regular meals list for sure!

YUM!!! I made extra sauce and added it to a coleslaw salad mix (premade). I only added 1/2 a jalapeno and I even doubled the recipe and it was SPICY!!! WOWSERS!! Good though, but if you can't handle the spicy I definitely suggest probably only 1/8th of a jalapeno. 
I ended up making WAY too much and was able to heat it up and make it the second day as well, which was pretty fabulous!! I definitely suggest using a sustainable fish for this as our fish population is very rapidly decreasing. 
Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!!

This is da bomb! I cooked the fish as the recipe called for and used store-bought coleslaw, added lettuce, a little of the ranch dressing which i got the recipe from on this site, and made a side of black beans and rice also from this site. It was like a deconstructed fish burrito! Thanks for the recipe! Yummmm!

These are awesome.  The white sauce is really what makes it.  I used less jalapeno than called for because I was making them for my family but thats a preference thing.  I will say I thought the white sauce was going to be too spicy when I tried it on its own, but it actually compliments the fish perfectly.  Thanks!

I recently came back from Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara, Mexico and these taste just like the local tacos sold everywhere. I searched for a recipe like this on the internet and this is the only one I found that came close to being authentic. Truly satisfying! I used large shrimp as well and it was sooo good. Just one note, individually batter the fish pieces putting them in the fryer one by one to avoid clumps.

Used this recipe for the white sauce.  Daaaang!  Delicious!  I skipped the may o and used 1 whole cup of plain non-fat Greek style yogurt.  Added a little extra dill and a tsp of minced jalapenos.  So yummy!  So light and refreshing!  Perfect on the hot fish tacos!

The sauce is amazing.  I crave these all the time.  I do use a shortcut..... Frozen battered fish that I can just pop in the oven.

This fish taco recipe is amazing! I have had fish tacos from numerous places including Mexico and these are the best i've ever had! I did add fresh chopped cilantro and homemade pico de gallo to the tacos and served with lime wedges! So so yummy and worth the effort. I will make again and again~

SO GOOD!  I'm from Houston and we have a popular restaurant here that is known for their fish tacos and sauce.  In my opinion this recipe is better.  Thanks so much for sharing!

The sauce was pretty bad.  I've been looking for a great San Diego style fish taco for awhile.  This was not it.  I'll keep looking!

OK, so our spanish sucks, but this recipe sure doesn't! The cabbage is really the key to this dish, the textural combination makes this recipe stand out from other easy fish recipes

YUM! These were absolutely divine! We've made them twice in a week because they were so good. I usually change recipes a bit adding and subtracting things, but this one didn't need changes! I did use more jalapenos since we're a spicy bunch, but I would recommend this recipe to all!

Great batter and flavor. I used half the cayanne and that was plenty spicy for me. My husband would have liked more. We used crappie and it tasted great.

the only fish I could make my husband eat is real fish sticks from costco and tuna salad sandwich.... until we tried this recipe.  This is delicious!!!  The sauce is absolutely yummy!  My husband ate so much and requested more that we ended up eating fish tacos for 3 consecutive nights, and he's been raving about it so much since then.  The only reason why we didn't have it for the whole week was because we ran out of fish! Thanks for sharing this great, great recipe...will definitely be a staple at our house. We did use tilapia fillets instead of cod.  But the kind of fish I think is forgiving. Whatever fish you prefer will do.

AWESOME. I didn't have much time so I bought Gorton's Beer Battered Fish Fillets. I used lettuce instead of cabbage. The sauce was AMAZING and definitely what made the dish. The sauce should be bottled and sold. I heated my tortillas in a skillet - that's a must for me since it seems to make them stronger and tastier. Next I'm going to try this with grilled fish and grilled shrimp. Easy, fun and sooooo good. I served with a lettuce salad with guacamole and pico de gallo - and a little of the sauce. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

So good!  Out of lime juice, used lemon, skipped jalapeno and capers.  Out of cabbage, used spinach.  Still delicious even with the substitutions!  Kids loved the white sauce.  Pre-chill batter in fridge.  When cooking, remove fish from frying pan to wire rack over cookie sheet in oven to keep crisp.  Next time make fresh Pico de Gallo to go with, and use lime if possible, and a bit more cumin.

Everybody raved about the sauce, so I just made that to go with my tacos.  Pretty good, but not as good as I thought it would turn out.

This is a great recipe....to make the tacos have a little more taste use lots of fresh cilantro...soft tortillas are a nice variation...for a crispy texture use napa cabbage.

This would have gotten 5 stars, but I had to add a ton more spices to really make the flavor. Added red pepper flake, himalayan crystal salt, pepper, lots more dill, cumin, and capers. Thinned it out a bit as well, it was pretty thick, but the end result? AMAZING. AMAZING. AMAZING.

This was so delicious!! I put the sauce into the blender because I didn't feel like chopping the jalapeno and capers. It turned out soupy at first so I added an avocado and it is soooooo good!! I absolutely love the sauce! Even better with avocado.

it's really hard to find the right batter for fish tacos. i think we found it here! it's perfect. not heavy, not too light. it didn't slide off when we set the fish into the hot oil. i will recommend this batter to everyone! we didn't make the rest of the recipe because we were just looking for the batter. LOVE IT!

This was really good! The only thing we did differently was cut the fish into smaller pieces and add tomatoes and cilantro to the tacos themselves. Excellent, strongly recommend this!

These fish tacos are great.
The sauce was amazing. Perfectly spicy and the lime really complimented the fish.
I used a fish from Costco called tortilla-crusted tilapia and it went perfectly well with the cabbage and sauce. Served it with Spanish rice and black beans.

This is a recipe I wish I could give 10 stars to. The only thing I did different was that I panned fried the fish. The sauce is AMAZING!!! and makes this recipe. I made two versions of the sauce: one with yogurt and one with sour cream because my husband is not a yogurt fan. Honestly I couldnt tell the difference so next time I will use whatever I already have in the fridge.  I cant wait to have these again...maybe tomorrow night!!

These are the best fish tacos I have ever had.  Better than any restaurant could serve.  We added black beans to ours.

Thank you! I'm from San Diego but have been living in Paris for years. I only got my fish taco fix when I returned home for visits.  Now I whip them up, thanks for sharing!

The white sauce is terrific.  I cut corners and baked frozen beer-battered fish fillets in the oven. It was a lot of grease between the fish and the tortillas, so I might use flour tortillas, unfried, next time. I'd also add some shredded carrots and purple cabbage, and red onion, to the green cabbage next time. It's worth making again. Thanks for the recipe!

In love. Only change I made was to substitute the yogurt in the sauce for sour cream because that was what I had on hand. AMAZING!

Wonderful!  I didn't batter the fish, just added some butter, lightly seasoned with S&P and baked (425 for 11 minutes). For the sauce, I used light sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also don't like a lot of heat, so i only used 1/2 a jalapeno and 1/2tsp cayenne and it was perfect!

Loved it.  I seared and pan fried the fish rather than battering and deep frying.  The sauce was really good.  Will do again!

Best ever, hands down.  I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to fish tacos, because frankly I am somewhat troubled by the whole concept, but my goodness, these are fabulous.  The combo of that battered fish and sauce is just perfection.

Instead of mayonnaise I used a little over 1/4 cup sour cream and my family thought it was better. Not to mention healthier.

Excellent recipe.  I little unique and it took about a half a taco to really get into it but before finishing that first taco, i was dressing my second and third.  DELICIOUS!  The spicy white sauce goes perfectly with the cabbage and fish. My wife liked them better with flour tortillas, shreaded iceburg lettuce and tomato.

My rating is for the sauce alone...I can't rate the beer batter/fish frying because I chose to marinate and grill mine (using the marinade from the recipe 'grilled fish tacos with chipotle-lime dressing' from this site). This sauce is awesome! Some of the ingredients didn't make sense to me...but i made it as written anyway and it was awesome.

This was great!!! Tweaked the sauce some by leaving out capers and dill. Used a German beer. The only thing I would do differently is to cut the fish in narrow strips so the fit on the shells better.

Finally made these the other nite and wished I would have made them sooner.  I followed the recipe but subbed diced green chilis for the jalepeno in the sauce.  The sause is to die for!!  I can see using that on other things or just as a dip for veggies.  Next time I make these I think I'll broil the fish instead of frying it.  Just a personal choice.  Fabulous!!!

I liked the sauce, even though I had to leave out the jalapenos and half the chili powder for the kids.  I had never made fish tacos before.  Definitely something new.  I think next time it needs the tomatoes and avacado on it.

Sauce is excellent! I made it a couple hours before dinner so the flavors could come out. I'm sad to say I cheated and used beer battered frozen fish. But still delicious and made for a quick dinner.

These were excellent!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and the only thing I would maybe change is the amount of mayo required. I would definitely halve it or even cut it out completely. But the flavor of the spices in the sauce were delightful. Pure perfection! It was also my first time frying anything with batter and I was worried it would get everywhere, but it was quite easy, and the results were amazing!! Enjoy!!!

I would give this recipe a 4.5 - it was good but missing something - could not figure out what.  The beer batter for the fish was good - I did add a little extra salt though. The white sauce was very good - I used fat free yogurt and light mayo. I did not have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder instead. I also added a bit of kosher salt to the white sauce. I made 1/2 cod and 1/2 talapia - everyone liked the talapia better. I lightly fried the corn tortillas - sprinkled a little table salt on them as well. Definatley a recipe to make again - we topped them with pico de gallo. I think next time I may just bake the fish and try it that way to decrease the calories and fat.

This was amazing! The sauce was creamy, cool and mouthwatering! I pan fried my tilapia, which turned out perfectly crispy and yummy.  I also loved the cabbage mixture on top instead of lettuce because it was extra crunchy and gave the tacos more pizazz! One of my favorites!!

OMG! I loved these! I'm from Norway, but I've been to San Diego probably about 10 times, and these fish tacos tastes just like the ones we used to get on vacation! Thanks! Didn't think it would be this easy to make them at home with such great result.

I dipped my fish in lime juice and then dredged in flour spiced with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder.  I pan fried them in a few Tbsp. of oil. - Not exactly like the recipe.  However, the white sauce was outstanding!  That's what makes this recipe wonderful.

This recipe was a little time consuming, but totally worth it.  Best fish tacos I've ever had, and my boyfriend agrees!

great recipe...I will make again. I think I added more spices to the sauce. I used greek yogurt for the sauce to add more protein. It makes the sauce more tangy I think, which was really good.

This is excellent the sauce is amazing. My complaint is how much cayenne the recipe says to use, I used a 1/4 teasespoon and that was more than plenty. Also the Beer batter isn't as tasty as the Molson mix that I typically buy.

Love, love, love these fish tacos even though I actually altered the recipe slightly. I didn't have capers or dill for the sauce so added paprika and basil. I also didn't want to fry the fish --I used salmon-- so I did an oven baked with panko. We will definitely be having these for dinner again.

Also from San Diego, sure miss Rubio's fish tacos. No one here in Kansas knows or cares about fish tacos.  Gonna whip some up this weekend...seafood is hard to come by here other than frozen, might try fresh caught fish too.  TY for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. My husband loves fish tacos and this was my first time making them. We did grill the fish which I marinated for 30 min in lime juice and cajun seasoning. I am on WW so it was less points, but the sauce made this so yummy.  I was scared because the sauce has a big bite, but it complemented the fish perfectly. Will definitely have again.

We used mahi mahi instead and grilled it.  Also followed one of the suggestions to use the mixed color cabbage.  The sauce is awesome it really makes a delicious fish taco.

fantastic! I forgot the jalepeno so I added some canned dices green chilis instead. I also used eggless mayo from Trader Joes because thats what I had. It was one of the best fish taco recipes I've used and we have tried a few. Will make again.

Made these for my roommate ... HE LOVED THEM! I already have a rep for making amazing fish tacos this was just another test of a recipe. Turns out it is AMAZING! He and I were at first skeptical about the sauce since it's made with mayo (we think its gross) but it's really delicious. The recipe didn't call for Pico De Gallo but we used our own personal recipe for that. Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have cornstarch, so I used potato flakes.  I didn't have capers, oregano, jalapeno or cabbage.  But I doubled the lime, added italian seasoning, and some dry cilantro flakes.  Whole wheat tortillas heated dry on skillet.  Onions and avacado slices a little mexican shredded cheese.  YUM!  Separate I wasn't sure the flavors would come together.  But, for the first time making beer battered fish...I am ready for my mother-in-law!

These were very tasty--I loved the sauce the most. My only complaint is that the fish kept sticking to the frying basket and peeling off of the filets. I used frozen fried tilapia the next time and almost like it better. If you can figure out the sticking problem, this is a great recipe!

I made this recipe last night for the first time.  We used our own breading for the fish, but used the sauce recipe provided here.  It was the perfect compliment to the fish tacos!  Thanks for the new recipe, we will be keeping this one.

My family found the batter to be too doughy, although the fish was tender and not oily. The sauce has a nice kick and went well with the fish. We also used red cabbage and lettuce from the garden which gave the taco a crunch and freshness.  If we use this recipe again I plan to use less or no baking powder to reduce the leavening.

This deserves 5 stars for the sauce alone! I was lazy with the batter and bought a mix, but this sauce was amazing. I am not a big fan of spicy so I only added half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it came out perfect! Thanks you.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I made this for my family and everyone LOVED them! The white sauce is to die for!! I made it as the recipe stated minus the minced capers as I don't care for them. We will be making these again this week and I'll be thinking about them until we do! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was amazing. We added a bit more seasoning to the sauce and also to the breading but besides that its an awesome base recipe to add a bit more seasoning to! Honestly amazing though, my mouth was happy I could wait for leftovers lol!

This is my new favorite lunch/dinner/snack!!! It's so light and tasty. I seared my fish in a tiny bit of olive oil with no batter. Just added some spices (salt, pepper, chili powder, paprika). Also I added slices of avocado to the tacos. I used no fat greek yogurt and lowfat mayo in the sauce. I also left out the oregano b/c I'm not a fan of it.  It was delicious!

This recipe is great because of the sauce! Oh my goodness! I have decided on another fish taco batter recipe, but this sauce is incredible. When I first read it and tried his fish taco recipe I amost left out the sauce because the ingredients seemed a little odd to me. I decided to give it a try in it's entirety and now I have a sauce that my family can't get enough of! We talk about other ways to have it, in other dishes. Great, great, great! Thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome sauce especially with the cabbage! I cheated and used beer battered frozen fish (Gordons) and it was delicious!!!

My rating is more for the white sauce than the fish - I prefer grilled fish over fried but I think anything would taste amazing with this white sauce over it.  We made one recipe as written and one with half the cayenne for our kids or guests who prefer less heat.  Gets hotter (and better!) in the fridge.  I always have some in the fridge for last-minute fish tacos!

I cannot get enough of these!  I've been making this recipe for several years now.  I made them awhile back in the Outer Banks for some back east couples who said, "Fish Tacos?!"  They've been making them without us for the past 2 years.  The fish doesn't actually have to be deep fried...grilled or pan fried is fine...it's the white sauce that makes this dish!  Woohoo!

Great recipe!  Easy to do and the beer batter is delicious.  The mayo blend has a nice heat to it.  It's a little bland/lacking flavor as is though but with salsa and avocado then fish tacos are fantastic.  I would make them again still, very yummy.

This was the first time my family has ever eaten fish tacos and it will not be the last.  Even my kids loved them.  They are very good.  I made the recipe as directed and it turned out great :)  The sauce for these tacos is delicious.  I made mine right before serving but will make it ahead next time.  The flavor intensified the longer it set.  The batter for the fish needed a bit more salt but just a personal preference.

Wow, wow, wow!!! I can not say enough good things about this recipe! It turned out GREAT! I'm not a huge fish fan, but my husband is. Therefore, I'm always looking for a fish recipe to make him happy & that I'll enjoy as well. Well this one certainly fits the bill! I changed a few things based on personal preference and what I had on hand. I left out the capers and subbed taco seasoning for the cayenne pepper. I also used coleslaw mix instead of shredded cabbage. I don't own a deep frier, so I just heated the oil in a deep frying pan instead. We both absolutely loved the results, and this one is going into permanent rotation! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Very good! But I seasoned the fish first before i breaded it. I sprinkled some mexican seasoning and salt and it was yummy! I realized that you dont really need the capers in the white sauce, but my bf loves it. I can easily leave it out though..

Let me start by saying I just had three leftover fish tacos...for breakfast. These are delicious. I did make a couple of small adjustments to the sauce - adding cilantro and chili powder for color and flavor. Next time I think I'd season the batter a bit more - the texture was perfect, but the flavor could be bumped up a little. I also served it with some homemade pico de gallo and slices of avocado.  All in all, this was fantastic. And since Friday fish fry is a huge thing here in upstate NY, I'm going to use this beer batter recipe to make a killer fish fry soon - and the sauce and red cabbage would make a great slaw on the side.

Usher song: "I mean like, ooh myy gosh I’m soo in love...". Anyway, I wasn't able to go to S.D. this year so I made this for our anniversary lunch and the taste was unexpectedly good. It was a little bit spicy for me but my hubby loved it alot and went to his quiet zone. I made minor adjustments and used tilapia instead, salt & peppered fish before flouring it, omitted capers, and used slaw mix. After experimenting with beer batters, I have found that Bud Light works the best. The battered fish also tasted wonderful itself. Thanks Breese823!

I'm from San Diego and these are great.  If you're from SD and miss home, try them.  I fried them (I love Rubios), but next time I'll try grilled (Wahoo's).  The sauce is good, but make sure to ease up on the cayenne if you don't like hot too much.  I also used greek yogurt instead for extra zing.  I didn't use capers and it didn't detract from any of the flavor.

AWESOME! I grilled the fish to keep it healthier, and I topped it off with my homemade salsa and guacamole.  My boyrfriend ate 5 of these and my kids loved them too! The white sauce was delicious!

WOW! I never take the time to write reviews but THIS was GOOD! I made mine like a naked burrito...layered yellow rice, seasoned black beans, shredded coleslaw (prepkgd), chopped tomatoes, topped with pan fried cod and this sauce. WOW...just WOW! Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

Delicious!  I used some breaded fillets from Costco and then followed the rest of the recipe.  Everyone really liked them.  I used cilantro instead of dill.  YUM

We wanted Fish Fry, but alas none around on Good Friday, so this was a great recipe! (We did not use the "tartar sauce" or cabbage.)  I think I did not have my oil hot enough for the second round of frying as they were a bit mushy inside, but looked like a church fish fry!    My daughter and I thought it needed a bit more salt, husband thought maybe it would be good with a little bit of sweet.  I had a brain wave this morning and think I will try using corn meal and adding some sugar to try to make corn dogs!

Ok... the white sauce is INSANE!!!  Seriously crazy good.  I don't think I could ever use plain old tartar sauce ever again... this white sauce is amazing!  My hubby loved it too - I was going to ask him if he liked it but midway through his first bite, he muffled a "mmm good" with a thumbs up.  So if you like a little bit of spice and want to try something different definitely make this recipe.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe breese823!

I'm a connoisseur of fish, and fish tacos.  These things were off the hook!  The best I have had, from a Restaurant or from my kithchen.  Great batter and awesome white sauce.  Made it feel like summer was here with 30'' of snow still on the ground at the end of March.

This was a pretty interesting meal. I didn't care much for frying the fish, so I blackened it on the grill. I am undecided as to whether I liked the bed of raw cabbage, but the white sauce was really good.  To be perfectly honest, I am not sure if I really liked or disliked this meal..  but it was definitely fun to try something completely out of the norm for me.  Thanks for sharing!

these were a big hit with my dinner guests, some of which were fish taco veterans and said they were the best they'd ever had. i served them with salsa (from the Moosewood cookbook), avocado and refritos, some plantains sauteed in butter, brown sugar and cinnamon and  "Margaritas to Die For" and it was a great combo. I live in NZ and was cooking for Kiwis, so I halved the jalapeno and cayenne in the sauce but it still had a great kick to it. I had some sauce left over so I combined it with the leftover cabbage slaw and made a spicy southwestern cole slaw. yum.

This recipe is pretty great...I have been making it a lot but I only made it with fried fish the first time.  Every time after that  I have used seasoned grilled chicken strips instead of the fish.  The white sauce recipe is perfect.

This recipe was beyond good!!  My whole family loved it, even my 7 year old.  My family loves spicy so this worked out really good.  The sauce is very spicy so watch out.  I double the sauce (I cooked 1.5 pound cod) and had lots left over. So to re-heat the fried fish the next day, so that it is crispy again, is put fish on a cookie sheet and broil in your oven for a couple of minutes on each side. Watch it so it does not burn. It comes out nice and crisp just like the day you cooked it.  I had a lot of sauce left over so what I did is mixed it with the rest of the slaw mix(used that instead of  cabbage) and let sit for about 4 hours and we ate that with our ribs days later which ended up very tasty...spicy but tasty!  This is a very good recipe and would recomend to anybody!! Hope this review will help others! Thanks!**EDIT**: I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES NOW..THE KEY IS WHAT KIND OF INGREDIENTS YOU USE FOR THE SAUCE. THE FIRST FEW TIMES I USED SOUR CREAM AND LIGHT MAYO NOT YOGURT AND MAYO. THIS TIME I USED SMART BALANCE SOUR CREAM W/ MAYO AND IT WAS NOT NEAR AS GOOD.  I THINK YOU SHOULD USE WHATEVER YOUR USED TO EATING.. I THINK NEXT TIME I WILL TRY YOGURT NOT SOUR CREAM. **UPDATE** DID THE YOGART AND MAYO THAT IS THE BEST FOR THIS SAUCE

We loved this recipe - used tilapia & tempura batter (replaced the ice water with lager beer).  Might be nice to add a little sweetener (honey or corn syrup) to the sauce, but great overall!

Loved fish, loved the sauce, but wasn't crazy about it in a taco. Probably because I grew up in Ireland eating fish and chips with salt and vinegar. Hubby ate it as tacos and loved it and he's not a big fish eater. Love the batter, super easy.

The absolute best! I wouldn't change a thing.  This ranks up there with the fish tacos we discovered in Jaco, Costa Rica that were out of this world.  The family loved this recipe.  Caution on the jalapeño if you are new to hot stuff.

A little too spicy with the cumin, cayenne, jalapeno combo. The second time I made these I halved the cumin and cayenne and used only a third of a jalapeno. This made the spice manageable and I have repeated this revised dish multiple times since. Delicious!

OK so we tried it with both mayo and miracle whip, and both plain yogurt and sour cream and the best combination is definitely regular mayo and sour cream. (the miracle whip gave it to weird of a tang) No capers, no problem! Doesn't need em.  Used small flour tortillas and panko breaded cod from costco, and purchased the coleslaw mix and pico de gallo from the grocery store.  We devoured them! Made them for the family while we were on vacation and my dad loved the sauce so much he dropped the fish into the bowl of sauce when he went for seconds - It's all about the sauce! This is a must have recipe for Lent, but it may be a sin to eat them they are so dang tasty!

I have always loved fish tacos, however my husband would frown everytime I would mention them.  Well I decided to find a recipe a make them on my own at home.  These turned out delicious.  My husband raved over them and was asking for more. These taste betterthan any others I have tasted in a restaurant.  This recipe is on the top of my list. Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe! I have been looking for a recipe every since having my first fish taco at Taco Loco in Cabo a year ago. This recipe was great. This recipe is meant to be battered/fried, and the batter is amazing. I used Haddock and use homemade guacamole and used green chili peppers in the white sauce for more heat. Our kids love these. Thanks,

Everyone could not stop talking about how good the sauce was when I made it for a family fish fry.  I didn't put the jalepenos in and not as much cayenne because it was a little hot for me.

WE LOVED THIS RECIPE! I DID NOT FRY THE FISH. I DRIPPED THE FISH IN EGG AND I USED PANKO BREAD CRUMBS. BAKE AT 325 DEGREES FOR 25 MINUTES. DEFINITELY A KEEPER. THANKS!

My husband loved these! I cut the cayenne pepper in half so they wouldn't be too spicy for the kids and I also served the jalapenos on the side. They were perfect. 5 of us ate the 8 servings.

I only made the white sauce, we grilled out fish for a healthier taco.  The white sauce was a hit with my family.  I blended everything in the food processor and after sitting in the fridge about 30 minutes the sauce thickens up nicely.

Um... WOW is all I can say!!! This is easily the top 5 best meal I've ever made. We are not huge fans of fish, so I substituted boneless/skinless chicken breast and it turned out phenomenal! Other than that, followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of a few minor substitutions - cilantro instead of oregano in the sauce, no capers, 1/2 tsp cayenne. It wasn't too spicy so I think I'll add the entire tsp next time. also, used sour cream instead of yogurt. AMAZING!!! Thank you for this recipe!

Amazing!  I had always wanted to try a fish taco and I'm sure glad it was this one.  All I had was flour tortillas and lettuce instead of cabbage and it was wonderful.  Next time ( maybe after he brings in more fish tonight ) I'll make sure to try it with corn and cabbage.  I LOVED the sauce.  Thanks!

This was just okay for us.  I usually only try recipes that have ingredients I like and are prepared to our liking.  This one sounds great but something was missing.  We didn’t care too much for the batter or the sauce.

This is even better then most of the places I've had fish tacos!  To make it even more quick and easy, I purchased coleslaw mix and added chopped cilantro to it.  I also got some store bought pico de gallo and added fresh corn to it. This was easy to whip up in no time!

These were great - very refreshing! I had some frozen "beer battered cod" (already prepared product) in my freezer, so that wasn't as good - would have been better if I had hand battered it. Added cilantro to the tacos before serving. Used leftover sauce to make the tacos with grilled chicken the next day and was good with that too. Great recipe, will definitely make again.

This recipe is the closest thing I have found to authentic Baja Fish Tacos that I have found!  The batter turns out perfect.  I didn't use the recipe sauce though.  We always just take some sour cream and add chipotle adobo sauce to your desired heat and add a little fresh squeeze of lime on top!  Perfecto!

This is a really good recipe.  I did not give it 5 stars only because there was WAY too much cayenne as written.  I doubled the recipe except only put in 1.5 times the cayenne and it was too hot even like that.  And we are a spicy food family - my suggestion is to start with a smaller amount of cayenne and season to taste.

Mamcita!! I used tilapia, skipped the beer, but added 1Tbsp of red wine vinegar for punch & thinned it out with milk.  Salt the fish before you bread it. 1/2 tsp of cayenne is plenty!!  I also made a topping of tomatoes, red onion & cilantro to go on top.  Really Good!!

These are great!  They are a little time consuming, compared to what I normally cook, but worth it.  The sauce was very good.  Everyone loved the batter on the fish even if they would not make a taco out of it. Thank you for sharing.  Yum!

You know I always thought Fish Tacos sounded soo gross...and then I read this recipe and said Hey that might be good! I'm glad I did! They were GREAT! Very filling. I actually mixed some sauce with the cabbage and let it sit overnight...the sauce was great! Will make again and again!

Off the Richter Scale Good!  I eyeballed the tortillas to cut the fish into logs that would fit just right in the taco.  Didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream and a pickled jalapeno.  Halfed the cayenne too because I knew better.  Good Grief -- these are better than the Baja Street Tacos in Mexico!  My boyfriend was moaning with delight as he ate them and kept complimenting that they were the best he'd ever had!  The batter is divine and the sauce is over the top!!!  Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe!!!  UPDATE - I made these another time and was out of cayenne pepper so I added some bottle hot sauce - still great!

This was great! Needing to reduce calories, I used a grilled Mahi Mahi, marinated in compatible spices. I also went 3/4 yogurt and 1/4 mayo. I was out of oregano, so just used Italian seasoning. We loved them and will add to a regular menu.

This is my first review on this site, I just had to comment on this recipe - it's so easy and goo-oo-ood! I used frozen battered fish fillets (I really don't like the hassle of deep frying) and served with homemade pico de gallo. The white sauce and cabbage tastes so unbelievably good together, it's like they're long lost soul mates or something :D We had a little left over the next day so we eat tortillas with just white sauce, cabbage and pico de gallo for lunch, I almost didn't miss the fish at all, so I guess you could even make these vegetarian tacos!

Made this tonight as fish & chips. Omitted the tacos. It makes a wonderful fish fry. The taco sauce is a little runny for fish & chips, though, so you may want to use tartar sauce. Also, salt the fish after frying. I live on the Northshore of MA and this is just as good if not better than any seaside pub fare.

against popular opinion, we loved the beer batter but not the sauce. Found the cayenne to be overpowering. May try again with less or no cayenne. Update-After cutting the cayenne to just a pinch, this recipe was a huge hit and has become a regular in my house. I'm so glad i didnt give up.

Pretty good, like others have said, the sauce was the real superstar here. The only change I made was to use sour cream instead of yogurt because that's what I had on hand. I did have some problems with the batter not sticking, but I think that was an error on our part... we don't fry a lot and didn't know what we're doing. Will probably make the sauce again and serve over grilled fish next time!

*UPDATE* I've made these a few more times since then, and I've just been making frozen beer battered fish fillets. We didn't miss the taste or hassle of breading and frying our own fish. Once again, the sauce is a-m-a-z-i-n-g, give it a try!

Terriffic sauce.  Used frozen breaded chicken patties instead of fish.  Worked quite well.  Went heavy on jalapeno and spices, made the sauce early and let it marry in the fridge for three hours to blend the tastes.  Used double tortillas and heated them on the flame.  Delicious experience.  Shall do this again.

My husband came back from working in CA. raving about fish tacos.  Sounded gross to me til he explained what they were.  Found this recipe and tried it.  He said it was AWESOME and better than some he had in CA! The only thing I do different is I make the sauce in the food processor.  We make coleslaw with the extra cabbage and sauce (if there is any!).  Our friends have all asked for the recipe - thanks so much for putting this out there for us!!!

This recipe was decent. It needs alot of tweeking though. Id suggest using 1/2 the cayenne in the sauce.   Also too much frying involved. Next time i'll glaze the fish with oil and bake or grill. The tortillas, again, ill probably just bake them.  Other than too much frying, the sauce was great! I also made some pico de gallo, all in all the meal turned out OK.

Very good and simple. The sauce can take a little time to make, but I just used frozen battered cod from Sam Club. Very quick, very easy, very good and filling. Two tacos stuffed me.

Oh wow!Funny these are the recipe of the day today! I actually made this recipe for my family 2 weeks ago... Amazingly delish. It was absolutely incredible. I have a large family (1 hubby,5 kids and 2 adult cousins that eat here 5+ days a week) so I doubled up. We even had it cold the next day and it was great! I think next time I'll use just a bit less cayenne in the sauce and add more capers. The capers really make the sauce. We also used whole wheat wraps.   Hurry up... Make a list, go shopping and feed this to a hungry bunch! You'll be the star if tour kitchen tonight. Thanks for sharing this yummy authentic gem of a recipe.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe because of a few of the ingredients. I gave it a shot because I know that people in San Diego know whats up when it comes to fish tacos.  I was pretty stoked that I tried this recipe.  The batter was a bit too thick for my liking, but that was probably my fault for not draining it off of the fish for a long enough amount of time.  It had a great flavor all the way around.  I used Heineken for the beer, which I normally don't drink.  I used white corn tortillas instead of regular ones.  I also switched out the Jalapeno for a half of a Habanero pepper.  I also used fresh cod instead of frozen.  Will definitely be making again!

Beer batter was awesome!  I had tried to make fish tacos before w/ some sort of buttermilk batter and it just didn't work out.  These also went really well w/ mango & pineapple salsa.  Or sometimes I like to add pickled onions.

This is the best beer batter. I have made it twice and everyone loves it. The first time I said we were having fish I heard groans and i'm not hungry. After trying everyone enjoyed and the four of us polished of over a pound of catfish. Awesome and easy.

Delicious!!!  Not only as a whole package but the beer batter will be the one I use on any future fish frying we may do.  We don't eat a lot of fried things but this will be an exception!!!  The sauce was so good and not to spicy, my two year old loved it more than his usual ketchup.

We remember these from Hawaii and this is a great batter for just about anything (Chicken, Veggies, Pickles anything).  The sauce is such a perfect compliment to the batter.  This recipe has become a favorite in our family.  It is such a treat.  I don't use capers and use the bagged cole slaw mix in the bag salad section.  The leftovers are wonderful toasted.  You don't need to eat too much of this to get your fill.  Enjoy.

I was looking for a "beer" fish batter and saw this one.  I got distracted making the batter and added in the spices for the sauce by mistake and it came out TERRIFIC!  Will make this "Mistake" again. I dried the fish portions and dusted them first with the dry-blended batter mixture before I added the beer & egg - turned out I had way too much batter anyway for my 1 lb. fish package. Do not use fryer basket - drop battered fish into fryer bowl as fish floats up while cooking and no messy basket to clean to say nothing about all that yummy crispy wasted batter on the bottom of the fish which gets stuck right to & through the basket grids.

This was my first experience with fish tacos.  I had never tasted nor tried to cook them before.  I have to say I won't be cooking them again.  The sauce is good but when I put it all together I just didn't care for it. Not my kind of dish.  But my husband did like it.

I can really only rate the sauce for this recipe.  The only change I made was adding a little salt and cilantro.  I blended it in the food processor to maintain a smooth consistency, which I think is better. The sauce definitely has a kick with both jalapeno and cayenne pepper...but I like spicy food.  I think next time I would cut down the amount of lime juice. I used fat free yogurt and light mayo and it turned out ok.  It is not exactly like the white sauce on the fish tacos in San Diego...but decent enough. It made for a yummy fish taco! For the fish, I used Old Bay Blackened seasoning which gave the fish a tasty kick too.  Top it with cabbage and homemade pico de gallo and you are ready to go.

I loved the sauce, it really added a nice zesty taste. I just used fish sticks, EMW (EASY MOM WAY), and it was just as good. Would make it again!!!!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Have made it for friends, even in-laws, and gotten rave reviews. I always end up making the sauce a little hotter than called for to suit my taste (and use a pre-mixed batter).  Great recipe!

First let me tell you I didn't use this recipe to make fish tacos.  I've never heard of them.  I was on a different recipe for battered fish and one of the reviews said she preferred the batter for Tanyas fish tacos.....so here I am.  I used the batter and my halibut was delish. Better then my local fish and chip shop.  Just out of curiosity I made the white sauce to use as a kind of tartar sauce and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I'm sooo glad I took the time to read the other reviews on the other recipe or I would never have found this one.  Thanks Tanya

So yummy!  I left out the capers (we didn't have any more) and only had about 3/4 of a lime left.  I put in 1/4 tsp of cayenne (we don't like spicy) and it was delicious.  Next time I will try grilling the fish for a healthier alternative.  I also was thinking it might not be bad with shrimp or fish sticks (for the kids).

The sauce compliments the batter so nicely.  I substituted sour cream in lieu of yogurt and did not include capers (per one reviewer's suggestions).  Very tasty!  Highly recommended.

Delicious!  The sauce had a nice little kick to it.  I didn't add the capers since my bf doesn't like them and they weren't missed either.  The sauce was great!  The batter was nice and light!
A little time preparing but worth it!!

I love this recipe! And if you are trying to stay away from fried foods you can bake tilapia instead of frying the cod. Just sprinkle it with old bay and throw it into the oven for about ten to fifteen minutes at 350. Tastes great!

wonderful recipe! I have been looking for a fish taco recipe as it doesn't seem as popular on the east coast as it is in California. The sauce is perfect; I've used both sour cream and mayo and the recommended mayo and yogurt- I can't decide between the two though- both are yummy. Cod is definatley the best fish to use for this recipe as I've tried others. I let my husband do the fish frying part and it always comes out perfectly. I do also make a pico sauce to go with it. This sauce is a bit too spicey for the kids but perfect for us! This one of the few recipes I've come across that I havn't had to tweek.

I love fish tacos, if I see them on a menu at a restaurant I just have to order them.  And these were AMAZING!  We made them for the first time for a few friends and we all agreed that they were fantastic.  My boyfriend makes his own corn tortillas and we have a small deep fryer, which I think made them even better.  But everything from the amazing beer batter to the spicy white sauce....just wonderful!  We may make this a weekly meal!  Definately HAVE to try it!  And while you are at it...pick up some masa and make your own corn tortillas!

WOW! These are so good! The sauce is completely addictive. I used fresh cilantro in place of the oregano and it added a great freshness to the sauce. Everyone really liked these. Will definitely make again!

These were good. The sauce makes this receipe because there is no seasoning on the fish it self. I did omit the capers and cut the amount of cayenne in half. Next time I will try to let as much batter drizzle off before I fry them. Some were really thick and BIG. We ended up using one piece (cut in half) per taco.

I now live on the East Coast and could not find a recipe for that great white tangy fish taco sauce.  This one is perfect!!! All I've been longing for!  I omitted the jalopenos for family friendly fare and I confess, I did make these with fish sticks for a great easy dinner and added fresh pico de gallo.  Delish!

I used tialpia, water instead of beer, and sour cream in place of yogurt. I agree the sauce was great, the fish alright. I just prefer Fiery Fish tacos w/corn salsa from this site instead. Guess I like the "healthy" factor of that recipe better.

I messed this up somehow =(  But still giving it 5 Stars fr THAT SAUCE!  I have ate 2 corn tortillas with JUST it!!  My fish tastes AWFUL.  I have never cooked with Cod before, so am not sure what I did wrong but I marinated it in some lime juice, olive oil, S&P, ginger, garlic.  OMG it is SO nasty!  It is ok, but the finish is so bad it makes you spit it out.  I decided to not fry it and go with the lighter option of pan frying.  I don't know what I did wrong, but UGH!  I didn't use Jalapenos in the sauce or capers, and cut back on the cayenne bc of our little one.  But its a DELICIOUS SAUCE.  I also made crab cakes and might eat the sauce with them too!  Great recipe, don't know what happened to my fish, but I can ONLY imagine how tasty it would be!

Great tacos. I thought the batter coated a lot of fish. I was able to fry up 3 salmon potions cut up. This made a ton of food. Next time I'll half the recipe since I made it just for my husband and two kids. We had a lot of leftovers which wasn't a bad thing but doesn't taste as good as the first day. The sauce I subsituted sour cream for the yogurt and the sauce was sooooo yummy.

Great recipe.  I used Mrs. Pauls frozen fish, beacuse I really did not feel like frying fish - I cut them in 1/2 and it worked fine.  The sauce is so simple and so tasty!!  My kids(9 & 11) even ate the cabbage!! This is something they NEVER do.  We will be making this again.

Really good!! The only change I would make would be more salt in the batter and possibly the sauce (I am a salt fanatic). 

I also used low fat sour cream and mayo. It was amazing. :) I served it with a side of cucumber and tomato lime salad, and an avocado half. All sprinkled with fresh cilantro. Yum. 

Also, for those of you who do not have a deep fryer or a thermometer, I didn't either. I just let the oil get really hot and gauged how the cooking was going by how fast the fish browned and adjusted temperature as needed.

Only used the sauce from this recipe - had frozen breaded tilapia filets that I baked and broke into pieces for the tacos. Followed the rest of the recipe and the sauce tasted great.

I am sorry, I really tried to like this idea.  I think I figured out the sauce, may taste better with a different mayo than I used.  It also tasted sour to me so I had to doctor it up, maybe I had to big of a lime.  As for the batter, its just to much unless you let it drip off the fish before frying.  It also is bland to me.  Maybe we are just not fish taco people.  I so wanted to try as my brother loves fish tacos.  Thanks.

I love love love these tacos. Since I am not big on eating fish, this is the way for me to go. I like things spicy so I do add hot pepper sauce to the fish and crushed red pepper to the sauce. I am going to make some more of these this weekend.

Ohhh YESSS!  My Husband was raised in Tijuana and these are near perfect.  He scarffed 'em down.  I was impressed as well. We used Sea Bass and it was delicioso!  I skipped the jalepenos in the sauce but made my own quick pico de gallo with em in that instead.  MEMORABLE RECIPE!

The only things I changed was using tilapia in place of the cod and leaving out the capers because I just did not have them on hand. This was great!! I can't wait to have these again and serve them to company.

the sauce is AWESOME. only reason this isnt a 5 star is the fish is bland. Like many others have said-  salt fish prior to batter and/or add way more salt to batter.  The breading is light and fluffy so with more seasoning to fish/batter  it is pretty prefect

We like this recipe, especially the beer batter!  Made a second time with cod, and only did half the recipe for 1/2 lb of fish.  We had a lot of sauce and batter left over, so I think next time I'll make have sauce and batter for 1 lb of fish.  Delicious!

Great recipe!  You can halve the batter if you want (you'll have a lot of leftover if you use the full recipe) and I always double the sauce.  Try rolling the cod in panko bread crumbs after dipping it in batter for crunchier fish!

Instead of frying the fish, as directed, I grilled the fish in a non-stick skillet with olive oil.  The tacos turned out okay, but they definitely didn't give me that WOW factor.  I will definitely batter the fish next time.

This recipe is fab. Next time, I would add a pinch of sugar to the batter. Also, as some have mentioned, salting fish after they get out of the fryer is key. 

We deep fried for an indulgent treat, but this sauce would be wonderful with grilled or broiled fish too!

Can I give this 100 stars?  This is a favorite!  The sauce alone deserves 5 stars.  I dip everything in the jalapeno sauce!  Thank you for sharing what should be a big secret.

I spent about a year experimenting with various fish taco recipes, and this one came out on top. I follow it to the letter, except that I have started substituting tilapia for the cod. The baja sauce is awesome!

Made this one night for dinner.  I had tilapia on hand so I used that and that worked out just fine.  You will want to put that white sauce on everything.

Good recipe. Although not authentic the use of dill weed is interesting and kinda makes sense.

This was a fantastic recipe! Husband loved it! He asks for fish tacos all the time now. I went and bought a 10lb box of cod, just to have around, so we can make these when ever we want. Good fish is hard to find in Montana. I made quac. to put on the tacos and used Pace Picante' sauce as well. We have also made soft shell tacos instead of the corn tortillas and they are wonderful as a change of pace. The sauce is great too! Thanks for this recipe!!!

This sauce is FAB.  I made ours into sort of a salad. I used a package of coleslaw, topped it with chunks of fish and added the sauce.  We topped ours with pineapple salsa.  SOO YUMMY.

LOVE this sauce. The tacos overall are wonderful, but it's the sauce that puts them over the top. Would be great on any fish. This is a keeper!

This was really quite good. I was a little unsure to try fish tacos but I have been hearing about them soo much lately I thoughtI'd try it. My husband really liked it but thought the same as me, a little too dilly, may cut the dill or add a bit less next time. But will make again for sure! I cant wait to try on my brother who lives in Puerto V. and see what he thinks. :)

I had never tried fish tacos until I made this recipe and for anyone like me who thinks "fish and tacos?", try it. This recipe was great and I LOVE the sauce, which can be eaten with anything (like my leftover chicken strips). YUM!

Loved this.  I don't have a deep fryer, so simply fried it in a pan with a lot of oil.. a little messy that way, but definately worth it.  Sauce was delicious.  I left out the capers, my husband has a strong aversion to them.  I thought it tasted great withouth.  Don't skip the cabbage, it doesn't add a lot of flavor, but it adds in a great crispy crunchy texture that really gives this taco a nice mouth feel.  I want to use the batter to make onion rings next time, I will plan to have some available.  Delicious.

The beer batter is amazing. The sauce is Amazing! Put it all together with a beer and OMG it is soooo good. I used less cayenne and added cilantro- everything was soo tasty!  Being from San Diego but now living in NYC this really hit the spot. NYC may have a lot of food but nothing beats true BAJA.

Best tacos ever.  I love the white sauce, followed other suggestions and added sourcream with the mayo instead and added a little more peppers and some pico de gallo.  Thank you!!

This is a marvelous recipe!  I used Tilapia (I'm not a big fan of fish to begin with) and it came out delicious!  I made this along with fresh pico de gallo, and apple enchiladas (from this site) for Cinco de Mayo.  Great meal!  Will definitely be making this again!

I think I found the base to the famous "creamy jalepeno" sauce from Houston tex-mex restaurant Chuy's.  Hmmm...I wanted to drink it.

The beer batter was really good and the sauce was also excellent! The batter is thick and sticks to the fish really well creating a nice full breading when fried. However, I really think it was the sauce that everyone loved so much...my mother could not stop praising it and she even said that the sauce and tacos were better than my stepfathers who has been the master at fish tacos since I was a kid. Thansk for the recipe!

Great recipe for the "taco night" for a family For 2 people it can be more pricey compared Taco Tuesdays in SD. We omitted the batter part & pan fried the cod with pepper, salt & little lemon juice. Which gave a more healthy version of the fish. The white sauce was great (we omitted the capers), but it still had that flavorful kick to it for those who like some spice.

These were good.  I really liked the sauce although I will definitely add cilantro next time and omit the oregano as you can't really taste it.  I didn't have capers.  So, I just added a tsp of pickle relish and it was still good.  Although these were good, I'm not a fan of frying my food.  This was my first time and it just makes a mess if you don't have a deep fryer.  I didn't think the taste of the fish was worth all the fuss.  But, thanks for the sauce recipe!

I reviewed this awhile back, and only gave it 3 stars because the sauce was simply too sour. But I gave it a try again because we had a large fish taco dinner party and I wanted to serve a few different sauce options. This time I only ended up using around half a lime instead of the whole thing. So take your time with that part of the preparation and you will love it.

These are awesome!! I ran across this recipe at leased a year ago. They are a favorite in our home now. When I want a quick dinner I just buy fish sticks. This sauce is so great... The best I have ever tried. I always double the recipe. It is hard to find good fish tacos now that I have this recipe. It really is all about the sauce. The only thing I do a little different is add less cayenne pepper. We like spicy stuff but a whole tsp of cayenne would really make you sit up and pay attention. When I do a double batch I add about a quarter tsp and one jap. GREAT Recipe... You wont regret trying this one... Thanks for sharing, We all love it!

What fantastic flavors!  My husband is allergic to fish, so did it with shrimp and wow!  The sauce is killer.  Made it as-written for the kids, who gobbled it up.  For my husband and I, added about one whole chipotle and some of the sauce.  Have had to stop myself from making this every day since!

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it.  I wasn't that crazy about the sauce; I felt like something was "missing." The next time I made it, instead of mayo I substituted sour cream which made it taste a lot lighter. Also I did not add capers (I hate the taste of them) or jalapenos.

Just used the white sauce and had haddock and hops fish already cooked in oven.  Used white sauce, fish, lettuce and onions on a flour tortilla.  O M G it was sooo good!  Yes, spicy.. will cut it with sour cream for hubby.  But YUM OO.  Will try the batter like everyone says.  I didn't change the white sauce recipe AT ALL!

AMAZING!  My family said they wanted to eat this every week.  I didn't fry the corn tortillas, just warmed them up.  Also, I topped off the tacos with some cilantro and used tilapia for the fish because that's what I had.  You can really use most white fish for this recipe and it would still be great.  I don't own a deep fryer, so I just heated about an inch deep of corn oil in a deep skillet until very hot and tossed in the fish (turned them over when they were golden brown). This one is a keeper!

The sauce for these tacos is out of this world!  Sometimes we fry the fish, sometimes we just broil or grill it...either way, it's fantastic!

It was very delicious, there were a few things I had to leave out because I didnt have them on hand and I grabbed this receipe at the last minute.  The white sauce was sooo good, i had also baked zesty potato cubes, and ended up topping them with the white sauce. . .mmmm mouth watering now thinking of it.  I didnt have any jalapeno, and i used flour tortias because my children are not wild about corn, I also subsituted shredded lettuce for the cabbage, and frozen fish to help shrink the work, and it was still very good.  I plan on trying this with grilling my fish next time.  I only gave it four because i wish there was a healthier way to make this delicious meal!!!!!  I would say it was a bit spicy for me, but I like everything mild so. . . to each their own!

My husband is from L.A. and is very picky about any mexican food.  He loves fish tacos and complains that there isn't anything good here.  He loves these fish tacos!  He asks for them and raves about them when I fix them.  Thanks!

This was a really good recipe and I couldn't get enough of the white sauce that you make. I decided not to fry the fish and to broil it instead. (I don't have anything to fry it in and it makes this recipe much healthier.) Anyway, I had a hard time keeping the beer batter on the fish this way. I still really enjoyed these tacos and I will make them again when I get homesick for California. (It's hard to come by a good fish taco over here in Scotland!)

So yummy!  We are also from southern California, and this recipe perfectly satisfies our craving for fish tacos without having to go out to eat.  As some of the other reviews mentioned, this recipe needs salt!  I add 1 1/2 tsp. to the batter, as well as a light sprinkling to the fish itself before dipping in the batter.  In addition, the sauce needs salt to taste. I also substitute tilapia for cod.  Delicious recipe.

GREASY. This made me feel queasy and I couldn't eat more than a few bites. I had my fat hot, but the coating was so thick, about as thick as the fish itself on all sides and it was just too much greasy coating, overpowering the delicate flavor of fresh fish. I would much prefer to cook fish with fresh butter, herbs and a light coating of flour.

I'm from San Diego also and this is exactly like the Fish Tacos back at home.  Absolutely delicious.  My husband LOVES them so much he ate 4 or 5 tacos.  It's a definitely repeat.

11-21-07  My family loves this recipe.  We have made it just as it is written except for the capers, not always available.  The second time we made it without breading the fish, just seasoned the fish with lemon pepper and used the sauce recipe.  It is great both ways.  The second one is just a way to save on the waistline if you want to.  Can use shredded lettuce if your family objects to cabbage.  Thank you for the recipe.

Oh my goodness these were good! My dad has been on me for a while to try fish tacos and I always balked at the idea but I am so glad that we finally did. We made them exactly as the recipe stated (with the exception of using lettuce instead of cabbage since I couldn't find any preshredded cabbage and I was being lazy :) but I don't think that made a difference. The sauce was amazing-they really made the tacos. My one year old and VERY picky five year old each ate two of them! We will be having this again for sure!!!

My husband threw out the bottled tartar sauce in the refrig after tasting this wonderful and spicy homemade tartar sauce. I used fresh dill which was fab. I kept the whole recipe for the sauce and 1/2 the rest of the recipe (only 2 of us). A definite keeper!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted sour cream for the yogurt - I don't think I will do this next time.  Also, I doubled the sauce and had WAY too much leftover.  I think next time I will just follow the recipe exactly!!!
UPDATE:  Have made these twice since, with the recipe as-is, and they are delicious.  We just warm the tortillas rather than fry.  We even used tuna steaks once b/c that's all we had on hand and they were still yummy.

Wow!  This recipes was great.  From the batter to the absolutely fabulous sauce.  I follwed everything to a "T" with the exception that I addded some of the lime zest to the sauce (I could not throw it away :)  )  This would be a great "tartar" sauce for any fish, fantastic!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!! I used Gordon's beer battered fish cooked in the oven (fresh fish is hard to come by in Colorado!), served with Fridays onion rings (will try Ora Ida fries next time, same oven temp as Gordon's & my husband perfers fries). Made the sauce, using sour cream instead of yogurt (no capers- ick!) while fish & onion rings were cooking in the oven. I fried the tortillas in a small 8 in fry pan in a tad bit of oil. On the table: a plate for each one of us, plate of tortillas, plate of fish, plate of onion rings, bowl of sauce & bowl of shredded cabbage (I think shredded lettuce would be good to!). We each made our own tacos. The sauce was spicy but not too much, it was just right. It was fun, good hearty food! Thanks Tanya, I will be making this again!

FANTASTIC!  We absolutely ADORE this recipe.  Next time, I will use sour cream instead of yogurt so it isn't quite so 'tangy', and I will also use broiled fish, not fried (just for personal preference). This sauce is to die for!!!  I'm going to make it for other recipes.  For the extra spicy minded, I added (1) additional chopped jalapeno, (1) additional tsp. of capers, and approx. 1/4 cup of chipotle sauce.  AWESOME!!!  Definitely a keeper and family favorite!

I finally had to register officially to rate this recipe, I found it when I needed something to make with fish.  My family is from Mexico (coastal) and when I made this for a gathering at my house they LOVED it.  I have since made this several times.  Thank you so much for this recipe.!  Gracias...

Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe. I didn't have yogurt the first time I made them so I used sour cream and the white sauce turned out great.

Really tasty.  I just used frozen battered fish sticks - it's the sauce that makes these so good.

This recipe was fabulous, but next time I will most definitely bake/broil the fish.  We never eat fried food, so I ended up pulling all the fried coating off.  The sauce is yummy.  I also sprinkled some chopped cilantro on top......delicious!

We would give it 10 stars if we could. I have tried a LOT of recipes and this is by far the best. We live in So. Cal and we know fish tacos. This is right on the money. We used yellow tail that my husband caught in Mexico and it was delicious! Thanks!

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved this.. I don't have a deep fryer, so I cooked it in a shallow amount of veggie oil.. and it splattered a lot (I'm don't fry things very often).  So I think the trick is to add more oil next time.. but would appreciate other suggestions.  The taste and texture were awesome.  I used pre-shredded cabbage, and sour cream instead of yogurt.  I thawed out some frozen cod.. and it was fine.  Adding avocado wedges is also great.  Thanks for cracking the code on these So Cal favorites.

Super delish- one full jalapeno was a little much for me though and I am a spicy eater...must use corn tortillas too. Flour didn't taste as good.

These were very good. I cheated and used boxed beer batter fish (I know, but it was much easier)! I left the capers and jalapenos out of the sauce and it was still delicious. Definately will make again.

I have been eating this almost every day! To make it really easy, I buy pre-frozen breaded halibut and pre-shredded coleslaw.  But I don't skimp on the fresh pico de gallo or the white sauce. Excellent!

Terrific sauce, with just the right kick of spice!  I just fried the fish in a pan with a bit of oil and it turned out great.  Just be sure you don't cook cod too long or it will dry out.  Leftover sauce was perfect for shrimp tacos the next night!

Guess what?  This recipe is AWESOME.  When my husband and I lived in Virginia, we couldn't wait to get to San Diego for fish tacos.  This recipe reminds me of those very fish tacos we would crave.  The white sauce is EXCELLENT.  I give this recipe five stars plus.  Wait until you try it, you'll want to make this for friends and family.  AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!

I used to live in CA and loved Rubio's Fish Tacos...this is very close.  My husband said it was the best thing I had made in a long time!  The white sauce is wonderful.  I didn't have cod, so I used Mahi Mahi instead.

This is a wonderful recipe, however there is a much better beer batter recipe on this site, in particular there is one labeled as simply "beer batter"; use it and you should have much better results.

This was FANTASTIC! We  left the recipe as is except for leaving out the chopped jalepeno, since we hate chopping them. The batter was great, the texture amazing, and the white sauce made it mind-blowing. I will definitely make it when our parents get together!

The beer batter is excellent!  I think these are more suited to fish and chips though.  Maybe it's a regional thing, but they didn't taste like fish tacos to me.

Wow this was great!!  Next time I will double the sauce.  Personalized it just a little....1/2 tsp cayenne and 4 shakes of tabasco.  Used grouper because thats our favorite.  Had a side dish of Hoppin John!

Never tasted anything like this. I was unsure about having cabbage in a taco but decided to try it anyway. It's a great way to eat more fish. I followed the recipe exact except I added more lime to the sauce. It's a keeper!

I made this as the recipe stated, but omitted the capers. It was very good! I ate it with sour cream, salsa, lettuce, shredded cheese, and Tabasco sauce. I think these other ingredients are a must for anyone eating tacos. I didn't have a deep fryer, so I just pan-fried this. Turned out great! My only complaint is that the fish itself is a bit bland. Maybe I'll play around with throwing some spices into the beer batter.

Wonderful!  I usually don't change recipes before reviewing, but, because we're on a lowfat diet, i brushed some of the sauce on fillets and grilled them, and softened the tortillas in a hot, dry frying pan.  Also used lowfat mayo and nonfat yogurt.  I'm sure they are fabulous as prepared in the recipe, but even with the lowfat alternatives, my husband and I both went bonkers over these.  Thanks for a new and exciting way to serve fresh fish.  My husband says he will catch more, and fillet them all, just to have these tacos again!

This was excellent!  We really enjoyed the white sauce.  I thought I wouldn't like the cabbage with it and thought about using shredded lettuce, but the cabbage was great!  I think because it is a little firmer it works better with the sauce.  Really enjoyed it!  TY!

Love this recipe!  We only used the sauce, since we bought the extra crispy frozen fish.  Easy to make and tastes great.  DH already requested it again later this week.

THANK YOU for the recipe!  Moved from So. California almost 4 years ago and my husband and I have really missed the food....especially the fish tacos!  This recipe made us feel like we were there again!  The kids liked it too, I just set aside some white sauce before adding the hot stuff.  Very delicious beer batter too, I'll try it on chicken tenders as well!  THANKS SO MUCH!  TRY THIS RECIPE!!

The sauce is really the best part.  Yummm!  You can make it healthier and easier by just baking any fish with lemmon, olive oil, salt and pepper.

Excellent sauce! We chose to use sturgeon instead of cod, and we also deep fried additional jalepenos to slice up for some extra heat. Definitely don't forget the lime squeeze!

I followed the recipe for the white sauce exactly and used frozen battered fish.  I used homemade wheat flour tortillas instead of corn and some salsa that I dressed up with lime, extra onion and jalapeno.  I am not  usually a fan of spicy, but these were awesome.  I will be making these on a regular basis.

Last September we were in San Diego and had Rubio's.  This was an amazing copy of those wonderful fish tacos.  I made according to the recipe except did not use capers.  I should have used less pepper.  It was pretty spicy, but SOOOO good!  I cannot believe how much they tasted as exactly as I remembered!  SOOO good!  Before San Diego, I had never heard of fish tacos.  (I live in the deep south) I'm so glad I tried them!!!

I would give this recipe five stars for the fish, which was wonderful, but the seasoning for the sauce was a bit off, I would cut out the capers and dill next time.

I thought these were very good. I wasn't sure how the rest of my family would react to them as they've never had anything remotely like htis, but they thought it was good as well. The sauce and the batter were spot-on.

The sauce absolutely makes this recipe! Like others suggested I used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and that was plenty. I also added fresh tomato and mexican cheese blend to the tacos. Delicious!

I have never had fish tacos before so I was more than a little leery to try this recipe, but every one I have talked to raved about them so I figured why not.  They were awesome! I did not change a thing (like I said I had nothing to compare it to) and even though I was questioning some of the ingredients, it turned out YUMMY!

Wow, I made this for my family and it went over so well, despite that we also had chicken and steak, this is the dish that was empty by the end of the meal!  The beer batter was excellent and really light but thick, the white sauce was commented on by several people how it complimented the fish.  I omitted the capers and used less cayenne.  These were definitely the hit of the meal!  Thank you so much!

This recipe is fantastic.  These tacos taste just like the ones served up at the Tex-Mex joints in California.  They were a hit at multiple occasions with a crowd wary of the dish.  Also, I had a non-fish-eating friend eat these up!!!  Muy bueno!

The sauce is incredible!!  It's a little spicy, but blends well with the other flavors ( I put some in a bowl and added extra yougurt so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids).  I did bake the breaded fish,like another reviewer mentioned, to cut back on fat.  I wouldn't recommend it, you lose flavor and texture if you don't fry it (that's okay if your not after that little cruch).  I've been looking for a sauce like this for awhile, and now I've found it.  Thanks for sharing.

Ps.  I used the extra sauce over crab cakes the next day.  SUPERB!!

The sauce was very good--but very spicy!  Next time I'll only add 1/2 the cayenne and jalapeno.  I didn't fry the corn tortillas, and steamed them instead.  BIG MISTAKE.  They tore and fell apart while I was trying to eat them, plus the flavor was lacking.  I will try this recipe again, just less spicier and with fried corn tortillas--or steamed flour tortillas.

After reading the reviews I thought I would enjoy this. I did except I wasn't crazy about the sauce. My husband liked it.  I probably will make again with the exception of the sauce.  I'll try to find a different sauce to go with this.

Delicious. The sauce is key, you cannot skip it. We reduced the amount of cayenne a bit and used 1/2 the jalepeno to make it palatable for our young son. The batter was light and fluffy, perfect for tacos. We loved everything about this recipe, and we will make it again and again.

I did not make the white sauce. I made the batter for catfish and it was so good. I think the batter would be great on chicken tenders. The batter makes a nice crispy crust with a wonderful taste. yum.

I omitted the capers and the oregano and cut down by about half on the cumin and cayenne pepper.  I used baked halibut with homemade salsa, cilantro, red cabbage, jalapenos, corn tortillas and a squeezed lime - just delicious!

These were very good, first time having fish tacos.  I left out the capers and dill from the sauce (didn't have any) and halved the cayenne, and it was still plenty hot!  Also ate on flour tortillas as I don't care for corn, and they were still great.

I can't believe I found this recipe again!  I tried this a long time ago and recently it's been torturing me where I got this recipe.  It's absolutely awesome.  I do recall that I had a hard time with the tortillas so I ended up putting this into regular taco shells.  I hope to perfect this in the near future - now that I have saved it to my recipe box!

These are good. I have never had another type of fish taco so I can't compare. I always have trouble getting the shells right. The sauce is amazing though!! Thanks

The sauce is what makes this whole dish. It tastes better than eny restaurant. I did, however, just grill the cod since my husband and I don't like batter fried fish. It was excellent with grilled Cod

First off, I live in San Diego, and I have fish tacos pretty regularly, so I know what they are supposed to taste like here.  THESE ARE AWESOME!!  A great comparison.  I traded the yogurt for sour cream and the oregano for cilantro.  Soooo good.  I also threw some guacamole on top.  Muy Bien!

This recipe was fabulous!  My whole family loved it, including 6 and 8 year old girls.  They told me I could make it again any time.  I didn't have the yogurt for the sauce, but I used low-fat sour cream instead, and it was very good.  Thanks for a great recipe - getting kids to eat fish is a feat in itself!

Very, very good!  The batter is outstanding; probably the best I've ever tasted and will be my standby now.  For the white sauce, I eliminated the capers completely, and used fresh cilantro in place of the oregano.  I much preferred the flavor of the sauce with cilantro.

Great recipe, my boyfriend thought it was great alternative to ordinary tacos. I took the advice from another reviewer and fried the fish in a pan until golden brown and then put it under the broiler for the rest of the cooking time. Loved the sauce, although I cut down a little on the capers, as I'm not a huge fan of them in the first place. All in all, a definate keeper!

I feel like I am back in San Diego! My father used to live there, and we would have these tacos at Point Loma Seafood. These are so good! The cod, the batter, the sauce... I couldn't be happier with the results! I served these with red beans and rice, and I used the pico de gallo recipe from the Pico De Gallo Chicken Quesadillas recipe on this site. Absolutely to die for.

I'm not sure why I'm the odd man out here - but we did not like this.  I thought the combination of ingredients did not go well together.  I am still giving 3 stars since the beer batter was wonderful - just not with the sauce & cabbage.

I EXPECTED THE WHITE SAUCE TO BE PHENOMINAL BASED ON THE OTHER REVIEWS, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. WHILE MY FRIENDS SEEMED TO ENJOY IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS DEFINATELY OVERRATED. ON THE PLUS SIDE, THE BEER BATTER ROCKED!! OVERALL, THE RECIPE WAS GOOD, AND I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN.

Made these last night - so good!  Definitely a favorite from this site.  The market didn't have cod so I used snapper and it worked perfectly - also didn't have any capers in the house and I didn't miss them at all.  Yummy!

These tacos were fantastic!!  Even my roommate who says she doesn't eat fish is having the leftovers today for lunch!  I added a little garlic salt and cayenne to the batter, subbed sour cream for the yogurt in the sauce(it's what I had on hand) and added a few cilantro leaves along with the cabbage!  The batter was the best I'd ever had and will use to make fish and chips or breaded veggies in the future.  The sauce was very tasty and I'm going to try it as a marninade for grilled chicken.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is unbelievably delicious!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the sauce, and I was glad I did.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it!  Good enough for company...

I'm sure the batter is great and I will try it sometime, but I just had salmon on hand so I grilled it on the stove.  I heated up some corn tortillas, cut the salmon up in the tortillas, and with this sauce, wow, I loved it.  I realize this is not a "true" fish taco, and most things are usually better breaded and fried, but this was really good even without frying the fish.  The sauce is just really delicious.

I really wanted to like this because I love trying different things, but neither Husband nor I liked the sauce at all. However, I have got to say that the battered cod was without doubt the best I have ever made! The batter - which needed a touch more salt maybe? - was light, crispy, and melt-in-the-mouth fantastic! I will definitely be making the fish again, but not in the taco. Thank you very much!

Since the nearby restaurant that originally got me hooked on fish tacos changed its recipe, this is the next best thing!  However, as a shortcut, I used frozen beer-battered fish filets.  I plan to use fresh fish next time.

I love this recipe for the sauce - it just makes for the perfect fish taco.  I have left out the capers (if I was out of them) and it works either way.  

Thank you for a great recipe.  I actually crave these.

These are awsome tacos, if you had these at a restaraunt, they would be the house specialty for sure. Fantastic, I just wish they were easier and quicker to prepare. Worth the mess though trust me.

I made this mostly for the sauce.  It was not like the sauce we normally get on our fish tacos.  However it was okay, to much cumin for us.  I used beer battered fish sticks, per another review and it was to fishy.  I also made the tacos with frozen breaded shrimp and it was a nice change.

The sauce is awesome, although I've never made the fish using this recipe.  I just marinade the fish and grill it.

This is the best fish taco sauce ever.  Only one we use.  We are in San Diego as well and this is better than any fish taco joint around.  Thanks

Great recipe! My fish tacos turned out perfectly, just the way I used to buy them in San Diego! Prep time was much less than listed, though. I was done in 10 minutes, plus 5 minutes cooking time. I will definetely make these again.

I thought these were good. Worth a try. They were not what I was expecting though.. the sauce was good but lacking something. My hubby liked them a lot since he too grew up in Southern CA. I loved the beer batter method of frying and would have been just as happy to slap the fish after frying on a roll with tartar sauce.

These were awesome, the white sauce was very good. My husband had never had fish tacos and wasn't too fond of the idea until he took his first bite, now he's hooked!
The beer batter is great. Can't wait to try
it on other things. Thanks for the recipe Tanya!

Holy smokies!  well i've never made fish tacos before but this recipie is great!  the zesty white sauce is really good.  i also put some fresh garlic in the sauce.  the second time i made them i tried grilling the cod instead of deep frying.  i enjoyed both ways- by far a keeper!

This was great! I will make this again in a heart beat. I think that the sauce makes it. (I did alter the beer batter to add garlic salt and a touch of spicy batter.) It was well worth the fat!

These were SO GOOD!  

I thought that Fish Tacos sounded really gross, but this recipe completely changed my mind! 

Very, very good and my kids, ages 11, 9, and 7 LOVED them also!

We will be making this recipe again and again!  With absolutely NO changes.

I made these about a month ago.  I was curious about the fish tacos that my husband loved from San Diego.  He said they were the best and it was pretty easy.  My kids liked them too.  Totally recommend for everyone..

We made this tonight.  The white sauce is fabulous!  We are on the border, so spice is an everyday thing for us.  This sauce definitely measured up.  I found the frying batter to be too heavy but thankfully I sauteed the other half of fish in a little olive oil for a lighter version.  We preferred the sauteed fish. Excellent! Thanks.

We prefer to use flour tortillas instead of the corn tortillas suggested in the recipe. The corn ones overpowered the wonderful taste of the sauce and fish.

Thanks Tanya! This recipe was fantastic! The batter was super easy to make and it was so delicious. I used some of the left over fish in a sammy the next day for my man and he loved it! Also - get out some chicken or mushrooms cause you are going to want to fry some other foods using this batter!

I love the white sauce recipe.  Instead of frying it with a breading which is more traditional here in San Diego I just use halibut or talipia and blacken it with spices and fry up with a small amount of olive oil.  Another short cut we just use the angel hair cabbage from the ready produce section.  The only change I made with the white sauce was using a group up chipolte which gives it a real smokey taste.  Great recipe.

Fabulous!  Our neighbor gave us fresh rock cod caught off the SoCal coast and I made these fish tacos.  The 'white sauce' is essential.  We love the spiciness.  Also, I bought fresh pico de gallo at Whole Foods market and served it all in soft tacos...no need to fry the tortillas.

White sauce is excellent with grilled Mahi Mahi! For a little less kick, I omitted the peppers and halved the cayenne.

This recipe is really like the fish tacos you can find in San Diego (but better).  We made the fish tacos for our neighbors and they were apprehensive about trying them but they asked us this week when were making them again.

I did substituted the mayonaise in the sauce with sour cream.  I also made sure to make fresh pico de gallo which I think completed the tacos.

My family loved these fish tacos.  Great recipe!   I don't like dill so I omitted it from the sauce.  It was so good, I used the leftover sauce to spread on sandwiches the next day.  
The batter was light and crispy, perfect.
I absolutely will be making these again.

Tanya, 
I use to live in San Diego too & was missing fish tacos so bad. You really got this recipe perfect! I made it for friends here in Indiana who never even heard of fish tacos as well and they all loved them. Thank-you. It was a hit.

I was really looking forward to making these, I'm a big fan of authentic fish tacos. I have to say I was disappointed. The sauce, while good, still was lacking something. The breading for the fish didn't get crisp enough for my taste. I was also disappointed because the fish I bought was freezer burnt, but that is the store's fault.

These are pretty good and I don't usually like fish.  I was cooking for a bunch of fish lovers and everyone liked the sauce and cabbage but they suggested using a different kind of fish (Halibut or Mahi-Mahi) and oitting the batter.  My husband also said to add mandarin oranges like they do at Cheesecake Factory.

I must admit, I was skeptical- but these tacos are the answer to small pan fish fillet's. No more plain old beer battered fish here-- this recipe is going to be a regular for this fisherman!!

This is incredible. I love this recipe and I also love the sauce for the fish. I even tried it with the beer batter halibut chips that you get at costco and this turned out great too. :) We will make this many times. My 2 year loved this recipe and hubby too.

This is a very good recipe.  I love it.  I did substitute sour cream instead of plain yogurt.  I didnt want to buy all that yogurt and have leftovers.

I've made these a few times now and they are a big hit! Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! The sauce is the bomb and I love the way the whole taco is put together. I've been using catfish and last time I doubled up on the cumin and dill and used trader joes' hand made tortillas. These are becoming a family favorite and one which dinner guests ask for the recipe. Thanks again!

Instead of frying the fish, I just marinate it in lime juice and grill it. I LOVE the cabbage/coleslaw recipe that goes on top. Makes a great nutritious meal. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good! I didnt fry them in the batter - I was in a rush and didnt have any beer anyway - I just seasoned the fish and fried them in a little olive oil 5 minutes per side. The sauce is great! Thanks

I liked the beer batter because i like breading..but i made it all with rice flour for my gluten intolerant guests. Used red cabbage and there was more than enough sauce, which had a fresh taste. I also made a non-dairy version with soy yogurt and nayonaise. Everyone enjoyed!

My husband and I really loved this recipe!  He's a very picky eater, especially when it comes to fish, and he raved!  I almost didn't make the beer batter, but decided to give it a try.  It was amazingly light and very tasty.  The dill sauce was awesome.

Very Good.  I loved the white sauce, mine turned out pretty hot, but we loved it that way.  I didn't really care for the beer batter part, next time I will probbably just fry the fish with a dusting of flour or something, the batter was too thick for me and made a mess in my deep fryer.  But we love this recipe anyway!

My favorite shop to get fish tacos recently changed hands and I have been devastated, until now!  These are excellent!  They rate right up there with the best I've ever had.  I serve these with homemade Pico de Gallo, and I don't even miss that taco shop.  :)

I used the sauce with oven fried cod rather than traditional deep frying.  I also used fat free mayo and yogurt to make an extremely low fat meal.  I think the sauce was pretty good, it was just a different taste than I was expecting.  I was hoping for a fresher for baja-tasting sauce and this wasn't it.  I may make this again, but it probably won't become a regular.  One comment: I was a bit skeptical about the addition of the lime juice, but after tasting it without the lime, I decided to add it anyway, and I'm glad that I did!  It really lends alot to the flavor...and it doesn't come out tasting lime-y!

I usually sub baked, breaded catfish fingers & only a generous 1/4t of cayenne, which makes it plenty hot for us. But the flavor of the sauce is great! You MUST use fresh lime juice (had only fresh lemons one time, and it wasn't nearly so tasty). But no matter how you choose to make the fish, with that sauce, some thinly sliced cabbage and pico de gallo if you have it, you CAN'T go wrong. Big tortillas help too, although a neighbor on a diet brought her own sm low-carb tortillas, and she raved about these.

Quite good, but I did make some adjustments to make the recipe healthier and easier.  I thawed frozen mahi mahi fillets while I made the sauce.  Then I chunked the mahi mahi, and cooked it with a bit of olive oil on the stovetop, adding some jerk seasoning and a dash of taco seasoning while cooking.  Total time to make this yummy, healthier fish taco meal:  about 20 minutes.

Easy to make and delicious. I find that with tacos there is so much to alter to own taste, what stands out in this receipt is - fish batter! Loved it! Light, crispy and super easy to make.

I used milk instead of beer. I also subbed Creole seasonings in the white sauce instead of the listed seasonings. Both to make more kid-friendly for my 4 year old.

Daughter wanted the recipe and said she could eat six right now. Was very good, and easy to fix.

Simply delicious!  Did not have yogurt so omitted and it was still a tasty dressing we put on the fish.  Used shredded carrots and pickled cucumbers as i did not have cabbage.  
100% would make again!

I made this exactly as your directions called for, minus the capers because I didn't have them, and it was fabulous! The beer battered fish had the perfect crunch and the sauce was delicious. My 16 yo son took these for lunch 2 days and said it was one of his new favorites. High praise from a teenager!

Mine turned out a bit heavy on the breading and greasy. Will tone down the breading next time. Also smaller cuts of fish. Need to add more flavor ingredients.

There is only one place we have had fantastic fish tacos and that is in a restaurant in Minnetonka MN. We use to always take our Mom there.  Until we found this recipe. My husband fishes so we use our own caught fish. This is a huge hit with everyone. 
It really is fantastic.  We are known for our fish tacos now. We alway send our guest home with some sauce.

Loved this recipe, tried it exactly as noted the first time. Frying fish is not yet my forte! Bought frozen battered fish to speed up and simplify (young kids at home).. I used slightly different spices (what I had on hand) Used coriander (not all like it!) instead of oregano as it has more of a citrus flavour. I know fresh is best but since we had jarred pickled jalapeños in the fridge, I used about 6 slices. Chilli powder instead on paprika. I used some of the white sauce and tossed a coleslaw mix with it and refrigerated well in advance of eating. Use leftover sauce to drizzle over fish, which I put on top of the coleslaw!

I made this with freshly caught rock cod and even my friends who don't like fish ate them! My only mistake was cutting the fish pieces too big, forgetting that the beer batter puffs up a bit, but no one was complaining! The sauce was incredible  and the night was a success!!

I followed the recipe as per written and my wife and I both loved it. I myself added just a pinch more hot cayenne pepper because I liked the sauce a little more spicy. Going fishing this morning and hope to get more fish. Will use this recipe again.

Delicious!! I made use of fish that my boyfriend caught earlier in the morning. The recipe for the batter is awesome.  For my taste, I will thin out the batter next time. As is, the batter is perfect for fish n chips. THE SAUCE IS RIDICULOUS!! Completely amazing! My family's bellies are super content. Thanks for sharing!

The fish tacos were great and the sauce was the highlight of this recipe. The batter with the exact ingredients was thick and made the fish too bready and not as crisp as I would like. I will follow another reviewer's suggestion to not mix the batter too much next time I make this.

I modified this recipe and it turned out great, especially since I'm new to cooking and have never cooked cod.  I beer battered the cod but covered it with panko crumbs and prepared it 2 ways: 1) air fried at 350°F for 10 min one side, 5 minutes other side, 2) pan fried in veggie oil on medium high heat for 8 min/side.  I didn't really taste a difference in the texture.  I used red cabbage and mixed the sauce with it, saving half of it to spread on the tortillas.  I don't like corn tortillas so used flour tortillas, browning them on the top of my toaster.

I made these tacos with fresh caught trout. They were by far the best fish tacos I’ve had, at home or at a restaurant. The sauce is really what makes it. The sauce was so good.... so, so good. I ended up eating the rest of the sauce as dip with chips. The guy that said he didn’t like the sauce did something terribly wrong...

Nothing special, careful not to over power the cumin...I used frozen halibut. For the sauce I did plain Greek yogurt, saracha & dill. Made my own pico de  Gallo  W/Roma tomatoes, cilantro, red-o and jalapeño w/freshly squeezed lemon juice, salt & pepper to taste.

Batter was way too thick. Ended up thicker than the filet. Good flavor, but will thin with likely twice the amount of beer.

“Um, um, um, Fantastic!,” my wife said. I agreed.
I used canned jalapeño and cut the cayenne in half. It was still a little spicy. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Truly great stuff.

I'd say this is for mature palates.   Kids (preteens) didn't care for the white sauce and I made it to the T. It's not bad...just not in the rotation.

Absolutely delicious. I followed some other reviews and marinated and grilled the fish rather than batter-dipped. The white sauce is amazing. Will be putting this into the rotation for sure!

Great complete recipe, some shortcuts could be taken to shorten cooking  time. Such as  grilling or baking fish instead. The star of this dish is the sauce! Delicious!

I heavily altered this recipie to make a super easy version.  One of these days I need to make a dish true to the recipie.  Firstly, I used frozen fish fillets.  That took half the trouble away!  Breaded or beer batter seemed about the same.  Second, I blended the sauce in with thinly sliced cabbage to make a slaw.  Keep in the refriderator a day before using.  I left out the pepper because I tend to find these recipies too hot.  Added pepper flakes to taste after making slaw.  Thirdly,  find that corn tortillas are often broken or break easily.  I coated one side with olive oil and baked in a toaster oven to desired crispness.  I used two per taco so I could rotate them to hold together any imperfection.

I broiled the fish instead.  I used some Siracha in the sauce--not overdoing it--instead of the cayenne pepper.  The sauce really made this recipe...very easy and tasty.

I tried this with prebattered fillets, and fish sticks when I was in a hurry. They're ok, but fresh fish, and fresh batter for the fish is way better.

Yummy.  This is a Baja fish taco, I'm assuming.  Guess that's what it is because they are usually fried and sound similar.  We eat them here in Central Cali, too.  We like to use grilled fish though which is not traditional but more healthy.

We also like a sauce that is not white but can't seem to replicate it.  Thought it was chipotle something or other but now think maybe sriracha added to something. There's a tartar sauce flavor as well.  The best in our opinion but can't seem to get restaurants to reveal.  If anyone knows, let ME know.  LOL.

The first time I tried this recipe fish tacos were not a thing in Canada, but I had heard about them from friends who live in California. This recipe is amazing but I was not quite sure how it stacked up. Since then, fish tacos are available everywhere, but I have never found any recipe or restaurant that compares to these. These are so tasty! I make them often and for dinner parties for friends and always get rave reviews. The white sauce makes it and it must be pared with a good pico di Gallo and guacamole. Enjoy!

We had friends over for a taco bar (steak, chicken and fish).  Made this recipe for the fish tacos and the sauce.  The fish tacos were gone with the first round!!  Then, the were putting the sauce on the chicken and steak tacos!!

Great recipe and wonderful flavors! I would have followed exactly but had to skip the beer and substituted 1/2 c lemonade and 1/2 c chick broth. Worked fine. Will use this recipe again! Yum!

Outstanding Recipe! I wouldn’t change a thing. I added extra capers and on my taco because I love them. Will try some variety by making them in bowls  for a less messy version....  This is definitely a family favorite! ??????

this batter was so good ! I didn't make the white sauce but the beer batter is so good on it's own it doesn't even need it ! I used an old Michelob ultra light I found in the back of the fridge and it didn't effect the taste . 5 stars for sure !

All I have to say is OH MY GOSH?????? I've had my fair share of eating fish tacos in various restaurants and this recipe is off the chain, top of the notch, simply THE BEST fish tacos I've ever had! I did not change any part of the recipe and wouldn't dare to. Absolute perfection! The white sauce (positively eye rolling), fried cod in the beer batter, warmed corn tortillas, fresh slaw (and since I'm a Houstonian, I have to have fresh homemade pico de gallo on all tacos) is a fiesta in my mouth! Thank you so much for sharing Beatrice! I will definitely be making this time and time again ??

Made this with Louisiana Fish Fry spicy mix. Turned out fantastic. All the guys at the fire station loved it. The white sauce was really good. I think I’m going to try using sour cream next time rather than yogurt.

Recipe was great, sauce was delicious. I also topped with tomatoes to add to the flavor and I fried in olive oil rather than deep fry.  Easy to make and very delicious.

This was so delicious.  I followed the recipe as-is.  I used a stout beer in my batter and it worked very well.  My girlfriend requested that I make more of the white sauce so she could use it as a veggie dip!

This was so great. My fiancé thought they were one of the best meals we have made. Loved the sauce. I would add more cumin next time because I love cumin. Jeff thinks maybe we could cut up the pieces smaller next time but I think they were fine.

This recipe is amazing!  I adjust the cayenne a little so it’s not too spicy for my kids.  It’s so easy to make.  Sometimes I don’t do the whole beer batter and just cook the fish in the oven.  Still very delicious

The sauce way not the best. I would just use a Cabbage salsa next time. The ingredients look like it would be awesome but everything just cancels itself out. The breading recipe is the bomb! So easy and so good. You don't even need a dark beer.

I thought these were delicious!  I cheated and bought pre-battered cod to save time.  But the sauce was delicious.  I did reduce the cayenne pepper to half for my personal taste.  The hubs liked it too!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Thank you thank you thank you!  I had fish tacos for the first time in San Diego several  years ago.  I thought it sounded gross but tried it and immediately fell in love with them.  I have tried to find a recipe ever since that tasted like what I had and finally, yours is it!  The fried fish is perfect,  the beer batter is perfect , and the white sauce is spot on.

So good. We did not fry our fish and instead baked it with old bay rub. Used olive oil mayo and less vinegar plus added a splash of tequila pineapple sauce. AMAZING! SO SO good

Made these 8/31/18 to  for dinner to start holiday weekend.  Great my only recommendation is to double the sauce, it's fantastic.  This one will be repeated often.

I'd say four stars as written, five stars with a few adjustments. Added garlic powder, onion powder & paprika to beer batter. Only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne in white sauce, used Cilantro instead of oregano, used sour cream instead of yogurt, juice of 1 1/2 limes. Used oven heated flour tortillas instead of fried corn tortillas.

Loved it!  The sauce was a little spicy for the kids, but they still ate more than one each!  So it was a hit!  The only addition I made to the sauce was diced cucumber to cut down the spice level a bit.  Yum.  And I used a Pabst blue ribbon for the beer.  Super yum.  Mahalo for your recipe!

I made this primarily for the slaw.  Instead of cabbage I used broccoli cole slaw and added a small can of crushed pineapple.  Great combination of sweet and spicy.  I also substituted the fish for African Spiced Shrimp which was grilled.  Great combination.

As a side, I made a black bean salad.  Choose one you like.  Great meal for a summer evening and very quick.

This is my go-to recipe for the fish batter. It is seriously good eating even without the tacos and condiments. One tip is to cut fish to have the same thickness for even cooking. I also find that when I use this recipe to make fish-and-chips I like to add a bit of salt to the batter and serve it with malt vinegar. Such a great recipe!

This sauce is amazing. The ingredients go so well together. If you're a little sensitive to spices, I'd recommended omitting the cayenne or the jalapeno, because the combination packs a punch!

My review is for this wonderful sauce since I did not fry the fish or tacos.  Thanks for the recipe.  I’ll be using this a lot.  I used oven baked fish sticks and oven toasted tortillas. I brush the tortillas very lightly with peanut oil on both sides and place them in a single layer on a sheet pan in a 450F oven for 4 minutes.  These make soft tacos.

Yum! I am not a huge fish fan, but everyone else in my house is, so I have to suck it up sometimes :) The sauce was really good and although I have never had true California fish tacos, these seem to be pretty spot on from what I have heard. I will make these again for sure!

I found the batter quite bland so probably would not use it again. As for the sauce, I eliminated the capers and jalapenos just because my small kids were eating it, but it still turned out so delicious! Will definitely be using the sauce regularily.

Eekkk! I looked forward to making these after reading all the reviews. I’m from the South so you do not find fish tacos around here. This was my first time having a fish taco and I was quite disappointed :( ok, so somebody drank my beer for my beer batter so I had to improvise and used milk (another reviewer did also). I was unimpressed by the batter but It was not made accordingly. But was still very bland. Even without making the batter and many even grilled theirs, they still raved about the sauce. I was super excited about the sauce! I followed the recipe with every ingredient and measurement. I was still very unimpressed! The sauce isn’t terrible, just a big let down after reading all the excellent reviews. I had to force these down bc I didn’t want to cook another meal for supper. My husband ate his with a tortilla drenched in ketchup and disliked the sauce. I’d also like to add, I love different and fresh, earthy flavors. I am not a picky eater by any means. The only food I hate is sweet potatoes. These just won’t be happening again ??

I love these! The only seasonings I used in the white sauce were the capers, salt, lime juice and hot sauce. I sprinkled the fish with salt and enough  cumin to see while I fried as usual in a regular amount of oil in my black iron skillet ...1 qt oil NOT necessary.  I served with lime wedges. My taste tester brother stuffed himself with 4 big fat tacos and wished he had room for more!

Delicious new way for fish! Although it's not new, just for us to try at home. I used a beer battered tempura instead but followed the rest of the recipe. Loved it non the less but we'll definitely use the original recipe next time, just trying to use up stuff in our pantry. Thank you for a scrumptious new dinner that's light and full of veggies too!

Delicious! Even my kids enjoyed these and asked for them again. Make sure you flour the fish before you batter. And make sure your batter is thick.

It was just ok, I think the fish needed more spiced maybe even the batter, it was too plain for me.

I already had Cod from night before, so easy there. Next time I'll do the full deal. Really enjoyed the sauce, but I'll use half the cayenne next time. Other than that, terrific. My husband claims to hate some of the ingredients, especially yogurt, so I enjoy watching him eat and sometimes almost rave.  I can't tell him what it is or he won't eat it. So, this was a "...some sauce online from that recipe thingy....". It makes cooking so much fun again, kind of brings back good memories of cooking for my son when he was little...hiding ingredients. I know, my son was very young, big difference. Whatever works. Thanks for submitting.

The only thing I would change is adding some vinegar to the cabbage and 2 limes to the sauce, it needed more acid. The batter however, turned out fantastic.

Didnt realize this was a batter that is fried, and not even very crispy.  However, the white sauce recipe is perfect

Omg. I used some of the suggestions below and marinated the fish in lime and jalapeño. We used some butter and sautéed in a pan. Sprinkled some paprika too. This is a delicious recipe!! Yum!!!

Absolutely delicious! Didn't change a thing (aside from not adding jalapeño since I didn't have it on hand). Fish was super crispy and the sauce is what really made it! Will definitely be making this again! It was just as good crisped up in the oven the next day!

I used wild caught corvina and substituted kombucha for the beer. I also used potato starch in place of the cornstarch. It turned out perfectly for my first time! Oh yeah! My other substitute was coconut mayo for the sauce! I know I know, I pretty much changed the whole thing. Well, that's "my thing"! Thanks for the inspiration!

I love this recipe and I've made it at least 2 dozen times. My hubby fishes and I use mahi or fluke to make fish tacos. The white sauce recipe is perfecf! I marinate the fish briefly in lime juice and chili powder then follow the recipe exactly. It's a winner every time.

I did deep fry (fry daddy) my fish in the beer batter. I think I prefer it to be grilled. That being said, the white sauce is awesome! Either way you do your fish, definitely do the white sauce and the cabbage.

I made this with sole instead of cod, omitted the oregano as I did not have any, and used gluten free beer and flour, but those were the only alterations that I made. I have made excellent fried GF fish before this, and wasn't going to alter my recipe, but thought I would give this a try. I wish I hadn't. The batter is bland as written, unless you salt and pepper the heck out of it once it's fried. The white sauce is okay, but too many flavors are going on at one time. It's not a bad taste, but I didn't feel any of the ingredients could either shine through or play nicely with the others. It actually tastes alright on its own, but it didn't stand out on the fish.

Really good.  I used catfish instead and kept all other ingredients the same.  The sauce is what really makes this recipe top notch.  My husband enjoyed it also.

Simple and so fresh tasting!  Love the sauce!!! Add a pinch of salt, extra lime and Double it because it's so good! I wasn't sure about the capers before trying them in the sauce, but they were really tasty! I even added some extra! We added fresh cilantro, sliced  red onion, and pinto beans along with the fresh cabbage as fillings! The cabbage gives it all a wonderful crunch! Restaurant quality fish tacos!

I completely messed up the deep frying (not equipped properly) so am really commenting more on the sauce. I thought it was excellent, the only substitution I made was chipotle powder instead of dill and it went over very well.

I made several substitutes because I did not have all the ingredients.
Instead of the egg and beer wash I substituted a flaxseed/water mixture combined with a cup of miso soup.  I used panko breadcrumbs seasoned with dill and pepper instead of the flour mixture. 
Replaced deep fryer with pan on stove and used sesame seed oil.
Replaced cabbage with massaged kale.
Substituted yogurt with mustard, actually a mixture of sweet-sabi mustard and deli mustard.
Lastly, used pita bread instead of tortillas.

This was fantastic. Made it for my family as is written. Everyone was amazed with how well it turned out. The only things I would say is maybe increase the salt content and mince the jalapeño into extremely small pieces or even blitz it so that you don't have large chunks in the sauce

This was delicious!  I used millet flour and hemp seed for the coating.  Gave the fish a nice crust.  My husband is not crazy about fish but this,  he loved!

They were very good.   Loved the sauce and I did make changes.
 I had no yogurt so I used sour cream and eliminated the capers.   It was a wow.   Hesitated about using the entire jalepeno pepper but it worked.  I will be using this sauce on other things too, I liked it that much!   Maybe even a salad dressing.....

The tempura batter just a tad too thick to my liking, no problem used a little more beer to thin it out.

I would rate this 4 1/2 starts but I don't know how to make it a half star.....

Loved it! Reminds me of home (San Diego). Every thing that comes in a tortilla is done best in San Diego. It is hard to find anything that comes close so I greatly appreciate recipes from my home town. 

The only thing I left out was capers. I included everything else but went a little easy on the Cayenne pepper due to my 6 year old eating them as well.

Overall, they were great and I will be making them again.

Easy to make, but maybe a little too simplistic.  I like the additions some others have made, I will try some variation in the future.

First time making fish tacos.Followed the recipe exactly! Perfect! Will make again.  Beer batter recipe was perfect , will make again again even if not for tacos. Just a note . I recently heard dark beer is better for batter. Used Newcastle dark ale

Ok I made a few changes to the sauce recommended by other reviews, replaced yogurt with sour cream and replaced oregano with fresh cilantro. I thought a whole jalapeño would be too much but it was just right and I can't tolerate very spicy food. I should have made extra sauce because the left over was fantastic on green beans and chicken the next day.

This Baja sauce makes these fish tacos irresistible. It is the perfect amount of heat and the flavor can't be beat. I soak my speckled trout in buttermilk and then flour  and fry... and ii love the sauce - it can't be beat!!

I absolutely love this recipe!!!  The white sauce is the BEST--and I've tried others.  Hint:  You can sub fish sticks (pick a healthy one with no trans fats) and skip the fish frying step) and you'll have AWESOME tacos.  One of these days, I'll make my own fried fish using the directions in this recipe but, in the meantime, take a chance with the pre-made fish sticks--you won't be disappointed (unless you're in SoCal and think there's a difference, which I wouldn't dispute)  but I haven't had them in their place-of-origin so I'm extrapolating.  In any case, I couldn't be more pleased with this dish!  PERFECT for a hot summer dinner!

Followed recipe as written and it was spot on delicious!  I did double the recipe as I wanted to freeze the left over fish however the hubby and my dad wanted to eat on it over the next few days.  Who doesn't look some battered fish with vinegar on it?

I followed the instructions fairly close except had no cumin. The fish was amazing but quite labor intensive with the battering process. Added some jalapeño to the white sauce for added kick. Paired with an avocado salad which worked very well.

I didn't beer batter the fish in an attempt to make the recipe a healthier option- I did marinade cod in lime juice, salt and pepper. Otherwise I made the recipe as is. I have enjoyed fish tacos out at restaurants for a while and appreciate having a great base recipe to enjoy them at home! Thanks!

The sauce for these tacos is delicious!  For a healthier alternative I have also used grilled shrimp that is rubbed with olive oil, old bay and butter.

LOVED this! Grilled the fish instead of frying--just marinated in some lime juice, cayenne and dill then grilled for around 10 minutes until flaky.  Will definitely be making again!

Easy to make and delicious to taste ! This is a quick and fun recipe . I added more seasoning to the suce just because I like spicy spices. But I will definitely make this again . It's the perfect dish to have with wine for a girls night.

I made a non spicy alternative for my mother-in-law who can't have spicy food, but loves fish tacos. I used the same beer batter. I used tilapia instead of cod (it's what I had in the freezer) I seasoned it with complete seasoning oregano and onion powder. I used a different fish taco sauce and it was a hit! The beer batter is key.

The most authentic fish taco recipe I've found so far! A tip: the quality of beer makes a surprising difference. Would also add significantly more salt. I recommend serving with avocado or guac and lime slices on the side. And of course, cilantro cilantro cilantro!

I loved this! The only adjustments I made were to put a dash of hot sauce in the white sauce and have that sit in the fridge for an hour or so and I also used corn as additional topping. So good.

I thought I had dill and capers, but I didn't so I added a little creole mustard and sriracha to the sauce. Everything turned out amazing.  The batter was the most important part - a really strong recipe there as well

I love ths recipe!!! But, due to an allergy to white fish, I follow this recipe as a guide and use tuna steaks. And for convenience and a bit less fat, I cook the tuna on the grill or stove. Perfect!!!

I've made this several times now. The last time I divided the sauce in half, and one half got ground chipotle instead of cayenne pepper, and the other half got ground ancho chiles instead.  Gave it more of a sweet heat.  The beer batter recipe on its own is fabulous, too, for fish and chips.

This time for the sauce I used 1 cup sour cream instead of yogurt.The yogurt made it too tangy to the point of being overpowering of the other flavors (which I thought would be impossible).Put the lime juice in by small increments and taste as you go because you can't  "un-lime" if you over do it.
I omitted the jalapeño and  substituted the 1/2 tsp cayenne for 1/4 teaspoon of Ancho chili powder and 1/4 tsp of good quality Hungarian paprika.
Still spicy and great flavor,but not "bar food" spicy which is good if you don't like food hot enough to make your nose run.
I also used Mexican oregano crushed finely instead of regular  oregano.The sauce was a pleasing compromise between overly hot(to the point of muting other ingredients) and overly creamy/plain.If you enjoy the dill and caper flavor primarily, simply omit the chili/cayenne/paprika/jalapeño. ..then it is VERY similar to taco del Mars white sauce ;-)
This is my 5th time experimenting with this sauce.

This could have/should have been a five, but I either forgot the salt or the recipe needed more (likely  the former). Sauce  was delicious, but my fish was very bland. I'll try it again with the salt this time because I think this would be excellent when prepared correctly.

I will make again, definitely!  I used raw tortillas and fried them before serving. We made the white sauce without jalapenos, and instead of yogurt, used sour cream.   I also used processed fried cod and put in a pan of peanut oil to heat it up and crisp it.  Served it with a light southwestern cole slaw on the allrecipes site.  YUMMY

Im originally from the south... TN to be exact. I am currently living in San Diego. I fell in love with fish Tacos from Rubios. Now any time i go out to any mexican restaurant, i order fish tacos. I tried making them at home, but my issue was the white sauce. I found this recipe and used it for the white sauce only. It is so spot on! Love love love! I may never need to go out for fish tacos again!

Can't get Baja fish tacos around here so I'm happy I found this recipe. It's a bit of work, but it's a hit with the family. I serve it with the coleslaw (Restaurant Style Coleslaw, also on this site), homemade pico de gallo salsa and fresh avocado slices.

I have made this recipe twice now.  First time I followed recipe to a T and it was delicious.  Second time I made it as many others suggested with grilled fish (I used cod) and it was also amazing.  I liked not having the fried aspect so made it much healthier.  I did not have Greek yogurt so I did substitute sour cream which was just as good.  My husband said with the grilled fish it is one of his favorite meals, and wants to have it more often.

Love the  coating fish is moist. I do soak the halibut overnight in the beer and then add the  ingredients directly into beer soaked fish. No worry about lumps.. I do season fish prior to adding  battering mixings..

Outstanding fish tacos. I've used this recipe several times. If you want a little less heat, go easy on the jalapenos, cumin and cayenne, and add in to taste. you can leave a little on the side to add to a portion of the finished white sauce, for two levels of heat.

The sauce is so good!  I can not lie, I cheat and use the beer battered fish nuggets from Trader Joe's (because they are so you!).  I also use Trader Joe's corn/wheat tortillas.  Quick and easy week night meal that all the picky kids and husband like.  Serve with a black beans and a dollop of the sauce on the beans.

this was very easy to make, and the sauce is just some, the only thing I would replace is the corn tortillas with flour tortillas, it is just my personnel preference,. I did add some red pepper to my sauce, as I like a little more spice,. but the best part is with the left over fish and sauce and cabbage I made a great salad the next day, yummy,. my boyfriend loved the tacos as well,

I made this recipe for dinner tonight with my 13 year old daughter. The beer batter was a hit with my family and the sauce was called "amazing", "incredible " and "best sauce ever"! Even the picky eaters in our family loved this meal.  We added cilantro and served medium hot salsa on the side with lime wedges. We also slightly seasoned the batter and added a pinch of salt to the sauce. Fabulous recipe!

I absolutely love these tacos.  The beer battered fish turn out better than any restaurant.  I've also made them grilled to cut back on fat, and they are still good.  The sauce is unexpectedly good.  I thought it very odd to add dill and capers, but like to try the recipe as is the first time - and what a surprise!  DELICIOUS AS IS!  I've made this now several times.  Always a hit!

This was excellent and so filling.  I omitted the capers and dill weed and used soft floured tortillas.  My boyfriend wants to try it with hard tacos shells. Everything else spot on.  The dressing was amazing.  I might use more yogurt and less mayo next time.  A definite repeat in my house. :)

It's the sauce! Yogurt + Lime + Miracle Whip
1) Salt Cumin Pepper Cilantro Butter? - melt and toss together.
2) Oregano Jalepeno Cumin 1 TBsPicklejuice vs Dill Cayenne Greenolives vs capers Pepper Cilantro
SALSA: Cilantro RedOnion GarlicPepper(Lowry's) Tomatoes, or MANGO Salsa.
Savoy Cabbage + ColeslawDressing + Miracle Whip (or Lettuce).
Serve with Black Beans or Rice. Cheese is unnecessary.

Muy bueno! * Double the lime & jalapeño. Prep chipotle with some lime juice, add some olive oil and use to marinate the fish. Fry, bake or broil. * If jalapeño is too sour for you, replace with smaller amount of habanero. *Side with beans and brown rice: use 1/3 less water when boiling rice. Add a can of black beans with the rice. Do this before the fish since brown rice takes about 25-30 minutes to soak up the water. Subtract even more water and throw in a can of stewed tomatoes as well. I like to add garlic powder. *Avocado or guac works well as side too. 
*Beer, or ginger ale. * Add cilantro and/or red onion as a garnish or into the cabbage. *Success with salmon is possible.

This recipe was fantastic. I will definitely make it again. The only change I made was to use cilantro instead of dill in the sauce. I used the full amount of cayenne and it wasn't at all too hot for us. May use more next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe. 
The sauce is what makes it special. Tartar sauce, as someone said they would rather use,  would make it an entirely different dish and not nearly as special as it is.

Turned out delicious. I added a little shredded cheese, which I know is unorthodox for fish tacos. Everyone loved them.

Freakin' Awesome batter and sauce! I added a pinch of organic sugar to the sauce.  My store didnt have dill weed so I used dill seed and the sauce was soooo good.

For the batter, I followed to the letter and used Guinness Beer.  Awesome as well.  I'm going to use this batter for my fish and chips also.

This is my GO TO beer batter recipe. Tweak the seasonings in the flour mixture all you want, batter and fry anything. Fish, onion rings (I mean the BEST onion rings), mushrooms, whatever you want to deep fry. One onion makes a whole lotta rings. Made fish tacos tonight - used different sauce and whatnot but I have made this recipe as is and it's outstanding. To me, though, the beer batter is worth 5 stars all by itself. 6 on fish. Thanks for the recipe - my family has enjoyed it for years!

We didn't make the sauce or used the toppings, but we did make the batter. It was delicious! It is a thick batter but still tasted light, and would be amazing for fish & chips.  I think next time I would use less flour and baking powder to make it a little more flaky for tacos, and maybe add a little spice to the batter as well.  We fried it in a cast iron skillet on the grill, and used half of the amount of oil suggested, perfect!

We loved these!!!  The beer batter is very light. I found that i could have cut the beer batter recipe in half and still had plenty. I used a pound of fresh northern pike.  I made a mix of tomato, avocado, red onion, cilantro, salt and pepper with lime and lemon juice. We used that as a salsa to top the tacos! 
They were delicious!!

i made the white sauce only.. i wanted to try this recipe bc it's almost exactly what i saw on Smoky Ribs' channel on YouTube for South Meets West (Fish Tacos) Recipe.. the only difference in his video is using a lemon and half the zest for the lime.. i used the lemon and zest in mine (but doubled it), cut the cayenne to 3/4 of a tsp and added 1 tsp of kosher salt.. but followed the rest of the ingredients in this recipe.. next time i'd use all yogurt bc the mayo was a little too pronounced for me and i like mayo.. i'd like to try this with the lime as intended.. ty for the recipe

Instead of deep frying the fish, I pan fried it in a little bit of vegetable oil. I squeezed some lime juice over the fish while it was in the pan and sprinkled some paprika and cayenne pepper on the fish. Instead of cabbage I used romaine lettuce, delicious :)

I loved it! I used a cabbage mix,  left out the capers  (didn't have them) and grated cheddar cheese on top. The Hubby thought the recipe would have come out better if the fish was baked and not fried. We'll try that next time!

I made this for dinner tonight as I had some talapia I needed to use. I chose to bake it instead of frying for the healthier option and it was a perfect choice. I did as other reviews has suggested and doubled the white sauce. I also used a tri-colored cabbage mixture for color. I will be making this recipe again.

I love this recipe, it was easy to follow and turned out great! 
I did change some things:

- I only used half of the jalapeño that was called for,  which was lots of heat for me. 
- I used arrowroot flour instead of regular to see how it would work, turned out great! (Stella was the beer I used, just in case you were wondering) 
- I didn't have mayo, so I used Miracle Whip
- I added red cabbage, red onion, cilantro, and pineapple on top = Amazing!!

This was so delicious! I never write reviews, but I had to for this one. We grilled the fish (sprinkled with chili powder, salt, cumin, garlic powder, lime and a little oil). And it was delicious and light. My kids even loved it. The best part was the sauce!

Very good. The white sauce would even be good smeared on a shoe...delicious. Added a bit more beer, as the batter was a bit too thick. Also, left out the cayenne pepper..as kids don't like spicy food. Also, added a tad more salt after frying fish. Finally made some onion rings with remaining batter. Will definitely make again.

I've made this a couple of times and we like it because of the yummy sauce. I admit, I cheat with breaded fish tenders but it makes it fast and easy. I've used coleslaw mix instead of cabbage but also some chopped lettuce as well. It's a yummy, quick dinner.

I can't really review the recipe, because I made a shortcut version... but they were tasty! Used frozen beer -battered cod and whole wheat tortillas. I made the sauce as per the recipe and it was delicious! Also used the colorful coleslaw mix as one some suggested.

I never write reviews on the recipes but this one I felt obligated. I have never tasted so light yet delightful. If you don't like spicy to your food be careful on how much jalapenos and red cayenne you use. I would recommend using half of what the recipe calls for. I love heat so this was the perfect kick for fish tacos because they can tend to be bland. I live on the shore and have had lots of fish tacos but this recipe beats them all!!! If i could give more than five stars I would!!

The crema is spot on. Normally I'm the guy who reads a recipe and thinks; I can make this better. Not this time, I follow the sauce recipe to the pinch. The only aspect of this recipe that I've altered is the fish; we take the fresh cod, rub it with a 'dressing' of mayo and lemon juice, and bake it at 350 for roughly  15 minutes or until it starts to 'split'. Try the upgrade, it's good stuff.

I have made these tacos so many times that I don't even look at the recipe anymore.  They are by far the best fish tacos I've ever had and the sauce is awesome.

I agree, just ok.   I thought the white sauce was going to be spicy'r.  The Beer batter was pretty good.  If and when I figure out the fish sauce from "Chili's", this recipe would be off the charts.

The white sauce was great.  We pan fried our fish.  From another recipe, I made my own cabbage.  Combine 1/2 head of a small cabbage (cored and thinly sliced, 1/2 medium red onion thinly sliced, and cilantro) in a large bowl and squeeze a lime half over it. Drizzle with the  1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary; set aside.

I suggest adding the lime juice to taste. Also left out jalapeño and only added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp dill due to personal taste.
Otherwise, so tasty!

I skipped the fried breading, so this is for the sauce. it's perfect. I count macros, amd when I'm needing less fat for the day I just add all yogurt and skip the mayo. It's less creamy but still delicious. I've used this recipe for almost a year for family and friends, and everyone has said how good it is. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

What?! This is so good! I accidentally used 1 tsp for measuring the dried herbs and once I got to the cayenne I realized my error. I just double the cayenne so the ratio would be right. Great recipe!

Awesome - on my regular rotation. Double the sauce, it’s THAT good and you will want more! I recommend making the sauce ahead of time so it has the chance to chill and the ingredients blend together. My teenaged boys and their friends can’t get enough and I can barely cook the fish fast enough before their plates are empty. Serve with black beans and Spanish rice. Simple and easy, and most of all, delicious

My go to recipe and a favourite for the pescatarians in my household. I add more capers to the sauce and put chopped cilantro and avocado on the side to cater to tastes in my household but have made it as written many times. Also sub in any white fish or grill the fish as another reviewer mentioned. It's about the sauce. Oh and the batter if you want to indulge. Just like the fish tacos off stands in SoCal. Thanks so much for sharing. There's a reason 2k people have made this recipe!

Super yummy! I omitted the jalapeno so it wouldn't have any spice for my kids. They loved them and they are picky eaters too! This was really easy to make especially if you follow all the directions.

Oh, the coolness of the cabbage and sauce bring this dish together so well, we really needed more than the amount I made!  We looked like a pack of barracuda reveling in a school of minnows.  Terrific recipe!!!

I loved this recipe.  I grilled my fish instead of frying it and we loved it.  I backed off of the hot stuff to accommodate my diet requirements but the sauce was very tasty.  Looking forward to making this again.

I combined the sauce with the cabbage to make a "slaw" topping, topped with a bit of fresh cilantro and delich! My husband said they're the best fish tacos he's ever had! (& we've been to SanDiego & Hawaii! for them).

I've never had fish tacos anywhere ever, but we wanted something different for Easter since none of us really like ham, and these looked great. I wasn't sure since some of the ingredients in the sauce were ones I'm not fond of, but I stuck to the recipe as it was stated and the mixture gives it a brand new different flavor that's really good. They came out awesome. Everyone loved them which is saying a lot in our picky household. Will be making them again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

It was delicious. My wife and I are not people that would order fish tacos out let alone make them at home but I had some wonderful cod filets I had purchased on sale and happened to have all the ingredients on hand except the yogurt which I subbed with cottage cheese pureed until quite smooth.  Will make again after my wife gave it a "10"!

I tried corn tortillas and didn't like it. Using flour tortillas made all the difference for me. Also make sure to put pico de gallo on top to really set it off. I have made these twice now. Family loves them! We use Mahi Mahi as the fish, delicious. For the beer batter I use corona, and it comes out really nice.

Wow! This was so delicious. I loved the batter, it was so flavorful. I didn't make the sauce as I made a different Cilantro-Serrano sauce but the cabbage made the tacos even more delicious. I will be making again.

Have been using this website, this is my 4th review. That should tell you how much we loved it. Skipped a couple of ingredients since I didn't have them on hand and it still came out delicious.

Well, let me start out by saying I made a huge mess preparing this....grease , flour and batter everywhere!  The first batch ended up with batter/fish that cooked onto the bottom of the fryer basket. Had to let this cool before scraping the mess off.  So I wised up with the subsequent batches.  Since fryer was small, it took 4 batches to make. At this point, I decided not to fry the taco shells since we were hungry.  They were very good!  The sauce was a pleasantly different combination of flavors, even though I left the jalapeno out and halved the red pepper.  I do think the fish should be salted a bit when done frying.  I may try the grilling suggestion someone made to make a lighter dish, but the recipe is a keeper!

Wow...this was great.  I have been doing a "clean eating" boot camp for a couple of months now (no dairy, soy, corn, gluten etc.)  so had to alter this a bit.  I made the dressing from a sour cream alternative  Coconut Milk and avocado mayo...the rest of the ingredients for the dressing were the same and it was delicious!!!!   I tried to make the beer batter using almond flour and no corn startch....that did not work so well...but I pan fried the cod in Coconut oil and used Rice Tortillas.....My husband commented multiple times that these were awesome....and he hasn't been a fan of many of my "clean" adaptations.  I must say....this one is a keeper.

I'm giving my review for the fish batter only as I didn't have all the other ingredients and ended up using sour cream with lemon juice and adobo seasoning for the sauce. But the beer batter...omg, it's delicious! I used light beer and the flavor was not overpowering and the texture was crispy but light and the fish was so tender. It is best eaten right away as it can get soggy but if it does and you reheat it, it's still good. I made this twice and used my favorite fried chicken batter mix but it didn't taste as good so I'm gonna stick to the original recipe and mix it from scratch. Will definitely make this recipe again :)

I made onion rings and cod with the beer batter.  The only tweak I did was too shake the onions in the flour mixture before I added the beer.  I wish I would have done that with the fish too. The batter adheres nicely and it is so light and and crispy not heavy or greasy at all.  I fried between 340 & 350 degrees.  Can't wait to actually make the fish tacos the slaw looks delish.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  These are the changes we made:  1) Fresh cilantro, red onion, tomato, jalapeno (husband only) & Romaine lettuce added on top of the taco; 2) No cabbage or oregano; 3) No jalapeno added to the white sauce; 4) Rinsed fish & seasoned with Old Bay about 2 hours before cooking; 5) Used sour cream instead of plain yogurt; and finally 6) I do not own a deep fryer, so I just added a couple inches of vegetable oil to a deep pan & used a meat thermometer to check the temperature. This was my first time frying a fish & there were no problems. Great recipe.

Super tasty and delicious. White sauce was pretty good, tasted better after sitting a while. Don't forget your garnishes. Lime wedges, cilantro, I added homemade pickled hot peppers which I felt added umami ;-)

The 5 stars is for the sauce and how it makes the fish tacos! I make this when we have fresh white fish and I usually fry fish pieces in a small amount of butter/olive oil and lime juice rather than using the beer batter.  LOVE IT!

Great! The twelve year old made it and everyone loved it! She put the fish in a pan with olive oil instead of frying it. Also, found it better to use coleslaw on top than just cabbage. Overall delicious, especially the white sauce.

This recipe is amazing!  Way better than I've had in restaurants and almost as awesome as the one I had at a food truck.  I made it with homemade naan bread.  I also don't have a deep fryer and it worked fine cooking the fish in some oil in a pan.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly and the tacos turned out WONDERFUL! My husband loves all things fried fish and he said this one of the best recipes he's had (I've never fried fish before). The sauce has a nice kick to it and I used a Golden Ale for the beer. I might cut the Jalapeño in half - but that is just personal spicy preference. Served it with Pacifico and Mexican Rice.

This dish has made me popular with pretty much everyone who I serve it to! The beer batter is deadly.
I haven't been adding the capers and I don't feel like it's missing anything. I typically add avocado slices for a nice balance of textures!

These fish tacos are fabulous!! To make them quicker and healthier, I just fry the fish in olive oil. Have used this recipe many many times--it's a keeper! (Love the sauce!!)

Great fish tacos. Works with broiled fish also. It's the white sauce that makes these so good. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome recipe!!!! Can be used with all types of fish. It's also really easy to make. I added some pinapple salsa on top of it and they were amazing!

We've never had fish tacos before and this was the first recipe I tried. We loved them!!! I won't even try another recipe. My girls now ask for fish tacos on a regular basis. The sauce is amazing!!  It definitely makes the dish. I reduce the cayenne to 1/4 tsp so it's not too spicy for the kids, and it still has a nice heat. We use shredded lettuce instead of cabbage and put cheese and sometimes avocado on them. I recommend this to anyone. Enjoy!!

I made this for a handful of people who had never heard of fish tacos..they absolutely loved them !  These are better than any i've had at a restaurant. I didn't add capers and one other thing..but mostly the same. Here's a tip..if you juice carrots and cabbage for a healthy addition to your fruit shake..the left over fiber is great on these. No one knew they weren't just put through a food processor.  The sauce is the best part. But we cut the spiciness in half..perfection !  Oh, and I pan fried perch in a gluten free flour mix.

Great recipe.  My wife and I love the white sauce.  It's a definite keeper!  I make it exactly as written.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I usually use grouper, but I'm sure any firm white fish would be as fantastic.

My husband was uncertain if I could pull off fish tacos but let me tell you he was floored by how great these were!  He loved them..everyone at dinner loved them.  He wants me to make them for his family because they are so good.  Better then some restaurant tacos..sauce is the icing on the cake.. Perfect amount of heat in sauce..if you like really spicy I'd say add another half to whole jalapeño or use a Serrano  instead of the jalapeño.. But overall yummy as is...

This was great. The fish batter was great, the white sauce was great. One jalapeño was just enough for flavor and it wasn't too spicy. I will have to make double next time cause the fish were gone in less than 15 minutes.

I have made this recipe at least ten time over the years! AMAZING! The sauce is so good....Ive made it to go with other recipes too!  Only thing...I use mostly yogurt and way less mayo,  I hate mayo, but consider its texture and "flavor" to be important, so I use a small bit, but mostly yogurt for the sauce!

I only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the sauce but followed the recipe otherwise. Fantastic recipe. A big hit at our house. I sometimes make blackened catfish. For a second meal in the week I can use cabbage and this sauce with tortillas. Good and easy!

I have made this recipe a number of times! We loved them I don't eat fish so I used boneless chicken strips instead either way they were absolutely wonderful! the white sauce I like to double up on but other than that wonderful recipe would not change a thing. Thank you.

We all loved it. I made a few changes to mine. I used coleslaw already made from the store and used Tilapia instead.  It worked out very well. Everything else, I did as the recipe called for. The batter and sauce where easy to make. The special sauce is what gives it the amazing taste. It was a big hit. I'm really happy.

This was great definitely will make again.  I made this with halibut and added homemade guacamole.  Which finished it perfectly!  Only thing I will add is MORE SALT!  I would at least double the salt in the recipe next time.

I couldn't believe I could make beer battered anything and it looked so professional.  Unfortunately, I think my fish was too thick because it seemed still really tough on the inside.  But I got massive compliments for the batter and the sauce.  So kudos to you for a great recipe!

Wow!! Being from San Diego I have had my fair share of fish tacos and after trying this recipe out and hearing my family rave about it, I knew I had to get my review in! Initially, I wasn't sure I would like the cayenne and minced jalepeno, but it turned out amazing. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I just made this for dinner and it was awesome! Everyone in my house loved these taco's. I took other's advice and used sour cream instead of yogurt, other than that I made it as written. This will be a regular in our house for sure.

The white sauce is beyond words.  I didn't have plain yogurt and was a bit weary on just using mayonnaise ( myself nor my boyfriend are fond of it ) but the taste was amazing! I put a couple drops of sriracha on the taco's for some spice and I got compliments from everyone. Will definitely be making them again!

YUMMO!!! I made the sauce only as I have been looking for a fish taco jalapeno sauce and this one was the ticket. I forgot the oregano and well, it worked great without it. We even put it on our ground turkey tacos and it was just as fantastic on those as well. Can't wait to think of what else I can use the sauce on. Thanks for the recipe!! 
P.S. The fish (Alaskan Cod)  I used was just grilled on the bbq and eaten as is. (-:

Easy and delish! I don't have a deep fryer and I have never fried anything before myself, so I learned quickly not to have the oil boiling as it burned the fish almost immediately. Once I lowered the temperature we were good to go. I used sour cream instead of yogurt, simply because it was what was in the fridge and t tasted really good. Easy recipe but took some prep. All over a great meal! My husband loved it!

My husband loved these and said I had to make them again!  I left out the capers from the white sauce per his request, and I also made a cucumber, sweet red onion, mango, and cabbage pico to go with.  It was amazing!!  I think next time I will try it with grilled shrimp.  Great white sauce recipe!!!

Yum!  Family devoured it!  Used tilapia instead of cod - and did on the grill, instead of fried.  Marinated in lime juice, splashed on some beer while on the grill, few minutes per side - delicious.  Substituted light sour cream for the yogurt like some others on this site.  Grilled the tortillas.  Also added a homemade pico de gallo (recipe on this site).  Came out great!

Added cilantro to the sauce. Excellent recipe. We made it with swai fish ( a white fish ). Also used arugula instead of cabbage and through in some cooked corn & sprouts.

These were great. I did broil my fish with a little old bay seasoning, just because we didn't want them fried. The sauce is excellent! Will def make again!!

Made exactly as is and my whole family LOVED it.  I have 3 boys ages 12, 9, and 6.  The 9 and 12 yr old did not like the sauce, the rest of us did. 

I used Dos Equis and also served homemade pico de gallo with it.

YUM!

This was excellent! My husband said he loved it. I had to buy a fryer because I had to make chicken (using the same recipe) for my son as well because he doesn't like fish, but either way, it was very good. There was too much food to do in a pan. I did not use beer, I used sparkling water because I do not like beer. I did not use capers because I didn't want to buy them for just this recipe. I also used my micro-plane and grated the jalapeno into the sauce. This was so good. I make this again.

I find it interesting when people rate a recipe, but make all kinds of changes.  That's not really rating the recipe, now is it?  I made this recipe per the instructions...no changes or substitutions.  My 15 year old LOVED them!  I loved them too!!  I had never battered fish before this, and it turned out perfect.  The hero of the taco?  The sauce!!  Obviously fish doesn't have a lot of flavor, so the sauce steps up.  It has just enough "kick" to make it work...but not too spicy.  This recipe will definitely be in our weekly rotation!!

Absolutely delicious.  I sprinkled Cajun seasoning on the fish and grilled it instead of frying.  Also, used sour cream instead of yogurt. Topped the tacos with cabbage and pico de gallo. We had them last night and are making them again tonight! Highly recommend!

This was a great recipe.  Instead of making the beer batter, I used the prepackaged Shore Lunch beer batter.  My wife's palate doesn't tolerate spicy things very well and she thought that the sauce was not hot at all.  Sometimes jalepeno's can very with the amount of "kick" that they have.  Anyway, this is a new favorite and I will be making this recipe frequently.  The only downside is that this creates a lot of dishes to be cleaned.

These are seriously delicious, best I've ever had! I used tilapia because it was the best looking fish I saw and otherwise followed the recipe exactly and was super impressed with the results. Oh, one  more thing I did was dress the cabbage similar to a coleslaw and let it sit to soften.

I didn't have yogurt or capers, so I used sour cream instead, left the capers out, and used fresh dill. The sauce was still great. I also used haddock, but otherwise made the recipe as stated and it was very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

The sauce is good and as has been suggested, serving it with pico de gallo on top would have made it more flavourful. However the fish itself was bland, perhaps seasoning the fish before putting it through the batter and frying it would have helped. We were a little disappointed.

Absolutely the best fish tacos I made.  I've tried to recreate San Diego tacos for a while but they all fell flat.  I did use Maya's review to grill them since that is my preference and they came out dynamite! Husband adored them.  Thank you to both ladies. :)

I am in love with fish tacos!! I have cooked this with the beer batter (substituted beer with club soda, as I don't drink) and it was good. But I personally love this with a healthier breaded blackened tilapia. I love the sauce but I didn't use the capers because I didn't have them on hand and I used sour cream instead of yogurt. This is better with the crunch of cabbage but it tastes good with shredded romaine lettuce as well. I also like to put a bit of Pico de Gallo on top. Delicious and adaptable recipe. If nothing else, make the sauce just to taste creamy, tangy, and dill flavors. YUM!!

More than enough batter for 2# of fish. Batter comes out crispy and well seasoned. White sauce is tasty as well although I omitted capers, dill and oregano. Great recipe.

So good!  So so good!!  We absolutely love the sauce.  I make these with shrimp usually but the fish was lovely, too!  The first time I made these I battered the shrimp but as we do not have a deep fryer I did it in a large pan.  Came out a bit fluffy (I over battered....) but was a hot mess (the stove and air in my house).  Also to reduce the calories (if you are into that sort of thing, I am not usually!) I have made the sauce and marinated shrimp in a bit of olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic and grilled them on skewers.  AWESOME!!!!!!!  Combine with Chef John's tortillas and you will never eat from a food truck again.

These are - without a doubt - the best fish tacos you'll ever have! I top them with very thin shredded cabbage  and guacamole. An all time fave in my house!

I can't get enough of these! If you're pressed for time bagged coleslaw mix works and is prettier too with the purple cabbage. I did add cilantro because it just goes so well with Mexican dishes.

I did not make the fish according to recipe. I only made the sauce and it was a huge hit. I tripled the recipe because we were going on a weekend fishing trip with lots of friends and stored it in a recycled mustard squeeze bottle. First night grilled about 12 trout and everyone thought I brought mustard. So when I squeezed some on my taco they were shocked to see white sauce. Soon after everyone was squeezing the mustard bottle. Next day they were asking to leave the bottle at the group table and everyone asked for the recipe.

I've been making fish tacos for years but thought I'd try a new recipe. While I'll probably go back to my other recipe (easier) I will keep the sauce from this one. It totally makes the fish taco experience.

Myself and my family loved this!  The sauce really is the star!  I used a pkg of crispy crunchy cod from Sams Club which is delicious just baked in the oven.  Made some pico de gallo, chopped some lettuce and warmed up flour and corn tortillas in a dry pan on the stove.  I did use lite sour cream in place of yogurt and lite mayo.  Will definitely be making again!!!

Had my first fish taco at a restaurant, and wanted to make my own. These are top quality. My husband loved them so much that he won't take me out for them anymore, and that is fine with me. So easy to make.

This was wonderful!  The batter was wonderful, I forgot to dip the fish in flour before the batter, and I pan fried them as I don't have a deep fryer...and still they were crispy and flakey!  I left out the capers and substituted the dill for garlic powder in the sauce (I didn't have any), it was still really good but I will probably try it with next time...I can see how those would add an extra but of flavor.  My husband was a bit unsure of the sauce, but he really liked it...said it was true to the kind if tacos you'd get down in ensinada.  We are from San Diego, so it's nice to have a good recipe for home instead of going out!

This was good  very good.  I used Mahi Mahi  and it fried up beautifully.  The sauce was excellent.  Perhaps a little quibble with the cayenne pepper.  I like spice food and sometimes very spicy food.  There are many jars of hot sauce in pantry.  There is also some really good cayenne pepper. I used a third of teaspon and that was plenty.  A full teaspoon would have been incendiary .

I wanted a recipe for fish tacos because I had never eaten them being from the North.  This was absolutely excellent just the way it is written.  My husband asked me to make the sauce again even if we just have fish for dinner.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe, it is a keeper.

D-Lish! Everything was finger lickin' good. We've had these tacos several times, and I prefer using only a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper; the full teaspoon can be a little over powering. Instead of picadillo, I prefer topping it with a spicy jalapeno/habanero salsa, which I make fresh myself (I'll try to get that recipe posted soon for you all).

Thanks!

Wonderful!  The first fish tacos I have made.  I did cheat and buy frozen breaded fillets and baked them.  The sauce was yummy.  My husband said it has to go into our rotation box.

Some good ideas, but skip the whole batter and fried thing.  I blackened some talapia (very easy), added avocado slices and cilantro and it was a great, quick, and healthy mid-week dinner. Use more yogurt to sour cream to cut down on fat. Squeeze some lime on top after assembly.

I've never reviewed a recipe but had to say how great this was!  We loved the plain battered fish w/ ranch for kids & my husband & I could have eaten the white sauce w/ a spoon!  Thank you for taking the time to put this on allrecipes!  I did have to substitute sour cream for the plain yogurt but it was still excellent!!!

The sauce is delicious. I used tilapia the first time (couldn't find cod) and it good. Tonight I substituted grilled shrimp for tilapia and it was far better--and easier.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!!! I did change a couple things... My husband doesn't like spicy so I added only on jalapeño to the white sauce but I doubled everything else! I seasoned the fish before dipping in the beer batter instead of coating with flour and in the beer batter I added a whole can of beer instead of one cup! I put cole slaw on the taco and white sauce with Pico de gallo and served rice and black beans on the side! My husband wasn't too sure about fish tacos so I was hesitant to make these at first but he was talking about them all night long!!

Great fish tacos. The trick is finding good authentic sauces (not that the one included is not good). In coastal Mexico, the actual tacos from the hundreds of stands are very similar, it's the choice of sauces that separate the good from the great.

I used this recipe for the sauce, we grilled our fish.  Changed the plain yogurt to a greek yogurt and turned out phenomenal.  Found angel shredded cabbage at the store eliminating the extra prep work, it was the perfect size and texture for the tacos.  As always served with avocado and cilantro!

This review is for the sauce only. I grilled my fish so I can't rate the actual fish. The sauce was delicious! It sounded a little funky but I read the reviews and decided to go for it anyways. I used plain Greek yogurt, made no changes, and it was excellent.

These tacos are not only the best tacos ever, but one of my favorite meals of all time. Make sure to use a good beer, if you're from the south, Shiner seasonal is what I go for (the 966 seasonal this time). Fresh cod is key! Absolutely exceptional, thank you for the delicious recipe. It's great to throw something a little different in once in awhile. If I could give 6 stars, I would.

YUMMO! These fish Tacos are really good. For it being lent, I try to find different ideas for fish. The first time I tried a fish taco was at my fav. restaurant in Old Town, San Diego. These are amazing Taco's from the first bite, it tasted like the taco I got at my fav. dinner spot when I visit Cali. My daughter, who is also a very picky eater, loved these as well.

I'm not much of a fryer so I bought some breaded frozen cod from Trader Joe's. I made the white sauce as instructed, although it didn't look very white (maybe too much cayenne pepper?), and it was awesome! I put the sauce on the tortilla, added coleslaw and then the fish. It was really good.

This is easily one of the best recipes I've gotten from this site. Absolutely fantastic!  First time I have ever had fish tacos and I will be having them again. Used Guinness Stout for the batter and it made the fish phenomenal. that white sauce is also to die for, Thanks for submitting!

I was very excited to make this given the reviews. I would grill the fish next time as the deep frying is so heavy and to me not tasty. The white sauce that everyone raves about? I just do not agree.

Wonderful, the second time around! Used fresh thick cod, rinsed dried and seasoned with salt & pepper & old bay bay seasoning. Fish was then sprayed with olive oil spray- broiled for 5-6 minutes. Added one cube of frozen cilantro and diced mrs renfros jalapeño peppers to white sauce, rave reviews from birthday guests!

Wow, amazing flavors. The beer batter was fabulous. I cut the cod into chunks small enough to fry in batches in a small sauce pan so I didn't need so much oil. We had leftovers, so I just heated the fish at 350 degrees for 10 or 15 minutes. Even leftovers were good. Oh, definitely make some fresh pico de gallo to serve with this.

The whole family loved it. My kids had never tried fish tacos before, so they were hesitant. But there were no left-overs. Update: The second time I did not have any cornstarch, but the batter was fine without it (probably a little less crispy). I used two pounds of fish with the same amount of batter and it was just enough. I didn't dust the fish with flour first, just put all the fish pieces into the batter until ready to fry. And I used cilantro and dill to season the sauce (tastes just as good with sour cream instead of yogurt- but yogurt is preferable) with a dash of garlic powder and a little sugar since the amount of lime juice was too strong ("juice from one lime" is too vague). My 4yo didn't like it in a taco but did like the fish bites dipped in the sauce.

This is my "go to" white sauce. It's wonderfully complex and you can adjust the heat to please the kids or the hubby.

I thought a whole jalapeno would add enough spice to the sauce, so I subbed chili powder for cayenne.  I was wrong--next time I will do half and half.

Just used the white sauce recipe.  I feel cilantro is better with the lime than oregano.  For our family of four, even halving the recipe was a lot.

Awesome recipe.  Instead of adding the white sauce top of the slaw, I bought some broccoli/carrot/cabbage slaw and dressed it lightly just before serving the fish tacos. The next day my family wanted it again!

Great recipe! Loved, loved, loved the sauce! Used Mahi Mahi instead of cod because that was what I had on hand and it was yummy! What I really liked was the batter used to coat the fish. The next time I make fish and sticks I will use this batter to coat my fish fillets.

On the sauce, I followed the recipe except for the dill. I hate dill. Well, I did add 1/8 tsp of ancho chile powder. I so wanted to fry the fish, but my new diet and inner voice said no.... This time I listened. I pan sautéed and seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and chili powder. I free styled a cabbage slaw. I finely shredded some cabbage and a carrot. I made a slaw sauce with some honey, lime juice, oregano, and cumin. It was amazing. This Recipe is great because the sauce and slaw can be made ahead of time and can be doubled or tripled for multiple meals during the work week. If you pan cook the fish or even bake it, dinner can be done in 15 or 20 minutes if the sauces are pre made. I made a guacamole and added it to the tacos. A squeeze of lime makes these perfect. I made these with California rock cod. This fish didn't cook well in the pan, it is a soft flake that kind of fell apart. This could also be user error (points to self). Plus side, the fish was incredibly moist and fresh tasting.

I've never had fish tacos before, so I don't have any reference other than my first reaction. I followed the recipe except the beer batter. The sauce was on the spicy side, and although I liked it, the combination of fish, cabbage, and sauce did not do it for me. I even added cilantro and good pico de gallo. It seemed like lettuce would be better, and maybe onions. I'm sorry I can't explain better.

I was pleasantly suprised with these. My husband loves fish tacos of any kind me not so much. I have tried many and hated them. I love fish esp cod, so I gave this recipe a try mostly hopeing my husband would enjoy them...we both did. I would recommend cutting the red pepper down, we both love spicy food and it was a bit spicy for us with an entire tsp and there was about 5x too much sauce we drenched ours in it and had lots left over but overall the recipe was a great base to start with then add what you like

It was delicious. I substituted Mahi for cod and used red cabbage tossed with cilantro, lime juice and kosher salt for the garnish instead of white cabbage. Great flavors. The sauce could have used a dash of sugar, just to lighten it up a bit. I'll be using this batter recipe as a staple from here out!

I didnt like the sauce.  Perhaps it was because I didnt have any dill weed. I took another reviewer's advice and opted for sour cream instead of yogurt... I didnt like it.  I made some fresh pico de gallo and with that and a Mexican blend of cheese these tacos were pretty tasty.

You're going to want to double the amount of sauce you make, it's that good! It also works well with a grilled or broiled fish for a healthier option. My fiance turned his nose up at the idea of fish tacos until I fed him these, now he begs for them.

I didn't have everything on hand to fry the fish, so I baked it in the oven, then shredded it.  The sauce is delicious and most of my family loved it!  Some of the kids don't like fish, but they will since I am adding it to our favorites!

My husband went fishing and brought home striped bass. Being a Latina from So-Cal, naturally I craved good fish tacos! This recipe was "da bomb!"  Everything -- the combo of spices, the yummy white sauce, and especially the beer batter ingredients were divine! We used a thermometer to get the oil the exact temperature. We served our guests these tacos and they raved about them! I will be using the beer batter in future fish, shrimp, or scallop recipes AND I even think its a suitable batter to go around chile rellenos.

Awesome!
This was definitely a family pleasing dinner. And it only took my 1/2 and hour to prepare. I'm gluten intolerant so I substituted 1/2 C of cornstarch and 1/2 C of buckwheat flour for the flour. BUT what made these out of this world was the sauce. It was just wonderful taste and consistency.

I tried this recipe yesterday for lunch. I followed it exactly, with the exception of omitting the capers! My family loved it! Even my old fashioned father in law loved it! The batter was a little bland so I salted fish after frying, but the flavor of the white sauce is phenomenal!! I doubled up on the white sauce and will use today with chicken quesadillas! I served with fresh pico de gallo... DELISH!!

Never having had Fish Tacos before I wasn't sure what to expect. I made these as the recipe states including using shredded cabbage and the flavor was just amazing! The sauce is hot if you use it alone, the way this recipe is written it should be judged on the way EVERYTHING comes together and I thought it was wonderful!

These were great!  My kids ate multiple helpings!!  Next time I will just add some seasoning to the fish/batter so leftovers can be eaten with just some cocktail sauce or the white sauce.  It doesn't matter for the tacos because you add toppings and sauce which give it great flavor!!  I will make these again and will use the beer batter to make sweet and sour chicken!!

I have made this several times, with different types of fish.  The sauce is what makes this!  My family loves this, it is a nice change from a meat taco.  I have also tried with grilled fish (skipping the frying), and that is good too.  Excellent and versatile!

This recipe was easy maybe too easy. I followed this recipe to a T and it just didn't have enough flavor. my grandma who doesn't use any seasons or salt in her food was the only one who liked it. I wont try it again or even try to tweak it. such a shame too because the fish came out a beautiful color...

This recipe was perfect. My husband and I had so much fun making it. When the first piece of fish started to turn golden, his eyes just lit up and he couldn't believe we had just made such perfect fried fish!  Then when we put the fish together with the sauce...wow. We only used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, but was a perfect burn for our pallet. We made the summer salsa to pair with it which also turned out fantastic. We will be making this again!!  I totally recommend this recipe.

Since my husband likes grilled and I like fried fish, I decided to make this both ways. I cut up the fish into approx 2 ounce slices and seasoned with salt and pepper. For the fried, I coated it with the beer batter which was DELICIOUS. For the grilled, I added olive oil and lime juice to the marinade for more flavor. We really couldn't decide which one we liked more because we felt both were great in their own way. I took another reviewer's advice and picked up some cole slaw from Fairway (theirs is not smothered in mayo) to substitute for the raw cabbage.  That worked out GREAT and added wonderful flavors.  However, I didn't love the white sauce. I thought it tasted great when it was just yogurt, mayo, lime juice, and dill weed. But after I added the oregano, cumin, and cayenne pepper, it completely changed the taste and not for the better. Next time I think I will skip those 3 ingredients and try adding Sriracha instead. Also, I chopped up fresh cilantro and diced up onions to sprinkle on top of the tacos.

These are by far the best fish tacos we have had! The first few times made the fish just as instructed but in a pinch, purchased pub battered fish which worked just as well. The sauce is delicious!

The batter recipe is awesome...forms a thick and crunchy crust.  I used less oil and had to flip the fish half-way through, but this was not a problem.  The dip is also nice although a little spicy (and we like spice).  We will definitely make this again.

I didn't care for the heavy batter of the fish for a fish-taco.  This batter would be perfect for fish and chips but for tacos I want something lighter - like panko coating.
But THAT SAUCE!!  Loved it!  I keep thinking about it and other ways to use it.  It is delicious.  I mixed some of it with the cabbage for coleslaw and used more on my taco.  I used fresh oregano and fresh dill since I have them in my garden.
I am making this sauce again tonight for grilled chicken and fried green tomatoes.  The sauce is definitely a keeper!

I have made this recipe  three times this summer and we love it. The sauce totally makes it work. I have used Tilapia in stead of the cod. And cooked it (unbattered) over apple wood to create another layer of flavor. And bumped up the jalapeño to make it a bit hotter.

I had never eaten or made fish tacos before but my boyfriend kept hounding me to make some so I tried this recipe.  I grilled the fish instead of frying but, like others have said, the white sauce is the real star of this recipe!  I've made these a few times now and I've even made extra sauce and we put it on a lot of different things.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING and super easy. I tossed the cabbage in the sauce (saving some to add on top) and threw some carrots in there for color. A little dollop of pico and some fresh avocado slices to finish the assembled tacos. Nice n simple. The best part was that I could get everything ready in advance and then quickly fry the fish when people arrived. A trick to good, crispy, and NON oily fried fish is to lightly dust your pieces with flour, coat in the batter and then let them sit on a wire rack for about 20 min (this allows the batter to seal around the fish a bit, protecting it from getting saturated with oil when you fry. ANyways, they were BOMB and easy to add a personal touch to.

Great and flavorful.  The white sauce is great and adds a bit of coolness at the same time it adds some punch.  I only used cayenne without the jalapeño and it still added some wallop to the finished product.  The video uses flour tortillas but corn tortillas are a must for fish tacos.  This recipe really deserves five stars since. It is simple, flavorful and attractive. Thanks,

This was probably the best fish tacos we have had. They were so good, we had them two nights in a row. Like the other reviews, we went a little lighter and sautéed the fish in a little lime juice and olive oil. The sauce was excellent. I would highly recommend trying this. Oh, also we had fresh cod from Alaska. Very yummy.

oh my , I cant stop raving about these I just got done making them and they were awesome if your a good cook you can add or delete ingredients and I have to say these are better than any fish taco I have had anywhere I used less of the spices in the sauce and adjusted to taste but I was thoroughly impressed twith this and I used the extra batter to make onion rings BONUS !! We have made this gluten free also and it's just as good !!

My family LOVED this recipe. My husband's only complaint was the batter was a little thick to be on a taco (everyone else loved it).  I will be making this white sauce to go on everything from now on. Thumbs up!

The sauce is AWESOME! Just like one of the reviews, I made the sauce and let it sit in the fridge for about 6hrs beforehand. Also Added Mango Pico de gallo with cabbage! Turned out very well! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I used this mostly for the sauce, which is absolutely delicious, especially the next day! I recommend making it at least a few hours in advance, and preferably the day before.

The white sauce alone gets 5 stars!!  And for those who don't like reviews with modifications, read no further.  I ALWAYS modify.  I marinated and grilled mahi on the gas grill instead of frying cod.  My fish marinade was lime zest plus juice, 2 pods of fresh grated garlic, salt, pepper and half a beer.  We topped tacos with homemade pico (from this site) shredded cabbage, and that heavenly white sauce.  Delish!  I've made the white sauce twice now, the first time I substituted minced green olives since I didn't have capers, and it was great both ways!  Both times, I used sour cream for yogurt, and low fat mayo, because it's what I had on hand.  I also used only 1/4 tsp of cayenne, because 1 whole tsp sounded cruel and unusual.  ;)

This is the perfect fish taco recipe, and it's an easy one to modify if desired. I make a healthy version of this. My changes include pan sautéing red snapper seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder in ghee (drawn butter) until it flakes apart. For the shells we use corn tortillas or large romaine lettuce leaves (low-carb version), and finally a modified sauce. I use 6 oz. low-fat Greek yogurt mixed with 1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil, along with the recommended seasonings plus lime zest and the juice from half a lime. Super yum! Favorite toppings also include the shredded cabbage, tomatillo (green) salsa, chopped onions, and cilantro. It's my go-to fish taco recipe.

I made these for my family and they loved them. This was my first attempt to make fish tacos and the results were great. I cheated a little - I used a fish and chip batter from my local store to cut down on some of my prep time. I also did not have any dill weed so I used the dill seeds that I had. I know that the weed would've given it a refreshing taste but I just did not want to go to the store. Either way the sauce was VERY GOOD. My family says this is a keeper and I will be adding this to my regular meals. Thanks BREESE823.

Off the Charts!
The only thing we changed was the fish - we were wondering what to do with some nice halibut someone had brought home and decided to try this instead of fish'n'chips.  All the flavours meld perfectly.  This one goes to the top of the 'Keeper' list.

Delicious! I made everything exactly as the recipe states except one tiny thing - no capers so I minced up a baby dill pickle and the sauce was still incredible. The beer batter is delicious. I was skeptical about frying the tortillas but I put them on paper towels after to get as much oil off as possible and they were so good! I will make this again for sure.

The tacos were really good. The white sauce especially - I added some of the seeds with the jalapeno too for a kick. Maybe I did something wrong but the batter was a little too thick for my liking(I did substitute Sprite for beer but I don't think that was the problem. I think it's just the recipe).

We used this recipe but with some leftover cod that we'd grilled the night before. We really liked the sauce although we halved the amount of cayenne it called for. The sauce almost tasted like tzatziki!

The white sauce was sooooooo gooooood. Wasn't really "white", though. Also, no way does this serve 8. 
It could be that instead of battered and breaded fish, I rubbed fish pieces in chili powder and grilled them, making it much lighter.

I cheated and used quality fish sticks, but the sauce was AMAZING! I could have eaten myself sick on these! I made them up with slices of fresh avacado, shredded cabbage and fresh chopped tomatoes. A KEEPER!!

I love fish tacos and was SO excited to find this.  The reviewers went wild and I was sure it would be a go-to recipe in our house.  But no.  Even my most supportive eaters were pushing it around on their plates, thanking me for my effort.  Ouch!  I liked it more than anyone in the family, but I had to admit the batter was bland.  The sauce was kind of good, but still disappointing.  Possibly user error, but I watched the video - twice!

This is a great recipe!Have been making this for a few years and everyone who has eaten it loves it. The only difference is I put 2 or 3 chipotle peppers, minced into the batter. I think the dill weed in the white sauce makes it the best!! YUMM!

Very good!  Had to substitute sour cream for the plain yogurt because that's what I had on hand, omitted jalapeno and reduced cayenne to 1/2 tsp. to be kid friendly.  Only had flour tortillas and flounder fillets on hand. Even with the substitutions, it was very good and we will make it again.  The beer batter recipe was great.

maybe some canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce minced, and added to the batter would kick it up a notch.

My comment is actually directed to maya, It seems if you marinade the fish before grilling them in lime juice, you have already partially cooked the fish. The acid in the lime will do that so I'm guessing you grilled them just to get grill marks, and or some smokey flavor if you used charcoal or a wood product?

I normally just use cole slaw on my fish tacos.  I'm excited to try this recipe!

This is excellent!  Makes a lot of batter, so if you have extra fish or even firm tofu, you won't be wasting it.  It's probably not too good for the waistline, but for a once in a while treat, these fish tacos fit the bill.

Best fish tacos I've ever had.  The accompanying sauce is fantastic!  Finally, something spicy enough to stand up to the fish, and still have a ton of flavor.  A.MAZ.ING.

My husband swore that fish does not belong in a taco.  This has now become one of his favorite meals.  I serve this for guests and they rave about how good it is.  The sauce is perfect but a little on the hot side for me so I use ranch and it is just as tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe! As is, it is great. Like everyone, I adjust to my own liking. I use flour tortillas and shredded lettuce, instead of cabbage. I also add chunks of lime meat and a squeeze of lime over the top and they are perfect! Add a homemade margarita and even better!

I made these exactly by the directions.  My husband loved them.  I had never eaten a fish taco but WOW they were wonderful.  I bought the frozen individual bags of tilapia thawed them out and cut them up into bite sizes.  I purchased angel cabbage already shredded up in the bag.  I do not know anything a bought capers so I bought the 1.50 jar instead of the 4.00 jar.  I will be making these again for sure real soon.  Oh, my husband asked me to use half the amount of peppers next time

Baked the fish instead of frying and did not add capers as I did not have them on hand. We liked them so much I ended up making more fish in the middle of dinner so we could have some more!

My husband fell in love with these (and the sauce) on first bite. I'm starting to believe that it's impossible to find fish tacos like the ones that I had in a certain restaurant in San An, but I am more than happy with this recipe!

This is the first time I have rated a recipe, but these were so good that I had to do it!  I made these fish tacos last night just as the recipe was written and they were AMAZING! The batter is wonderful and the sauce is divine!  My family loved them as well.

Too much dill in the white sauce, and way too much white sauce for the amount of fish. It was all right in the end, but not spectacular. Oh, I just marinated the fish in lime and jalapenos with some chili powder and salt and then fried it in a bit of oil. Maybe the beer batter seals the deal, but I hope not.

I'll just add another rave review in agreement with all the rest.  I wasn't sure about the sauce, but was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  I did use a packaged slaw mix this time to save time, but I may have to use shredded lettuce next time to accommodate a few picky eaters. Most of the family really enjoyed these, and I will be making them again. Thanks for the great recipe!

The secret is in the sauce! My 7 YO loves it! Make the sauce (we omit the cayenne for the kiddo). Heat the tortillas on a griddle or in the microwave to save time & calories. Use fish sticks to save time. I prefer using broccoli slaw rather than cabbage.

Tried this recipe due to the high rating and was not disapointed. The white sauce made this recipe AMAZING!! I substitued sour cream for the yogurt and i can't say enough. Since I'm not a beer drinker I took from my memory that people enjoy Heineken so i used that brand. I thoroughly enjoyed this as a light, although filing, dinner during the week. I also whipped up a quick batch of guac, pico di gallo, and served with tortilla chips and cocktails LOVE!

This was a wonderful dish. I did add salt and pepper to the fish before putting it into the batter. The sauce was wonderful although I was out of capers and did not use it. I served this with  fresh Pico de Gallo (from this site), Spanish rice, Creme Fraiche and guacamole. I had to cut down the hot spices because of my husband's preference. He really enjoyed. It reminded us both of the fish tacos we get in Cancun!  I will make this again.

These were excellent, however, I used fish sticks as a shortcut and mixed a little taco sauce into the white sauce recipe along with some chopped fresh oregano and some cumin.  Will definitely make these again.

The sauce was good.  The batter did not stay crispy at all...not sure why. I would use the full amount of cayenne. I used half like some of the reviewers said, and it was not spicy enough.

Great!! We had blackened fish tacos.  Mixed equal parts of mayo and low fat sour cream, 1/4 lime, tablespoon of hot picante sauce and 1/8 tsp cumin and mixed with 1 cup of slaw. Served in whole wheat flower tortillas with salsa verde.  Yum.

I used pre-panko breaded tillapia.  I also didn't have yogurt on hand, so I used sour cream.  The sauce was an absolute hit.  Warning, the sauce is very spicy.

Loved it! It doesn't matter how you prepare the fish this recipe was outstanding. I pan fried the fish tonight, but I'm going to broil the fish next time and as soon as the snow melts I'm going to grill it. Definitely one to keep!

Used haddock and the fried fish was delightful!  rated this 5 stars because I did alter the recipe to my taste - used sour cream instead of yogurt (it was what I had on hand) and lemon instead of lime juice - again, just what I had, not a preference, but I omitted the capers as we don't care for them.  Next time we used the yogurt and lime, no capers - we LOVED the sauce.  We've also used flour tortillas as well as the corn - both really yummy.  We also enjoy using lettuce, tomatoes and avacado instead of the cabbage.  But either way, these are a huge hit.

We love these.  We don't usually use the batter that comes with the recipe though.  Usually just fry them in a little Fry Magic or flour and seasonings.  The sauce and other ingredients are what makes these so good!

These are great. I hate fish but my husband brings it home all of the time. When I need the clean the freezer out and finally make it, I make these! I usually make more sauce as we really like it. I also omit the capers sometimes just because the kids don’t care for them.

Next time, I should season the fish first before adding it to the batter. The sauce was really good though.

GREAT recipe! however I made some changes, no capers in the sauce, doubled the spices and the mayo was not necessary, just used 1 cup of the yogurt. It was excellent! I gave it 4 stars only because the sauce needed some more spice.

I had never tried making fish tacos with fried fish because I generally make a lighter grilled version, but this recipe is SENSATIONAL!!! I used olive oil for frying and used light mayo, light yogurt and light beer and it was still amazingly delicious.  We also used Mission brand carb balance tortillas and lightly fried those in the olive oil too and between that and the sauce, it made the dish.  Of course it's still fried but it's well worth that splurge you've been saving up for.  We can't wait to use this sauce on other dishes, it's THAT good.  Seriously, make these tacos you will not be disappointed!!

Changes I made:  left out the batter, grilled the fish, used 2 tbsp only of mayo, left out the lime juice and capers.  When preparing the tacos, I layered the cabbage, then the sauce and the fish on top.  When I didn't have jalapenos, I used 2 tsp of taco seasoning in the yogurt/mayo and that was  a great change, too.

This is by far the best fish taco recipe I have ever had! Every time I make these for guests, they can't seem to get enough of them and rave about how good they are. I can say for certain that its the sauce that will determine whether or not a fish taco is good and this sauce it amazing!!! Everything about this recipe is amazing and delicious. I would recommend it to anyone...although I like to keep it a secret for myself Ahahaha!

These are excellent, used frozen battered cod instead. The tangy sauce is soooo good. We didn't use capers. My boyfriend doesn't like fish but with this white sauce, he ate 3 tacos!

I have made this recipe over ten times. I don't do the fried fish portion only sauce. I use a tequila lime marinade on grilled fish and it is an amazing combo. I don't like the jalapeno, so I dropped the peppers and add 1 or 1 tbsp of garlic powder and cut the mayo quantity in half and add more yogurt. Use the extra sauce as a broiled or grilled fish marinade and amaze your friends.

These were pretty good, however I felt that the dressing while good when tasted on a spoon did not have enough citrus in it when put on the actual taco and I ended up having to add salt and lime juice to the taco.  The other thing I did since I do not have a deep fryer was to dip the fish in just the flour and salt, dunk in the egg and then back into the flour mix and pan fry it.  Worked great.  My boyfriend loved them, however I am a bit more discerning.

This was so good!! I had frozen cod in the freezer and just used that. If I could do it over I would have gotten fresh, the cod was I used was falling apart when I cut it up into cubes. We like spicy so I had sliced jalapeño on hand and just diced a few of those.

I loved the white sauce. On the advise of others I also bought coleslaw mix instead of just cabbage and was very pleased I did. I have a few oil burns but I would definitely make this again!

My family loves this recipe.  We are not huge fans of fried food.  We do like the fried version BUT we prefer to bake our beer battered fish instead and it's very yummy as well.  I bake at 350 until the batter is a golden brown.

Amazing! I loved it. The family couldn't get enough!   I didn't have regular yogurt, so used the Greek honey yogurt.  That bit of sweetness enhanced the flavors even more.  The batter seems a bit thick so I thinned it a little.  Letting the battered fish drain on a rack while I finished the prep and while the oil was heating insured more even frying and a lighter batter coating. Baking the frozen battered fish fillets is a good idea ODGIRL.  I didn't have cabbage on hand, so stopped by KFC for a container of theirs - a great tasting time saver!

Not really crazy about the taco part but the beer batter is phenomenal.  I have been looking for a good beer batter recipe for 20 years. Here it is.  I have never seen one with cornstarch in it before.  Must be the difference.

Excellent!  Just a little on the hot side for little ones.  Next time would add just 1/4teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/4-1/2 of the jalapeno. My 9yr old didn't mind the heat, but my 7 & 5 year old did not.  Husband loved it! A receipe keeper.

These are quite simply... AWESOME! My family adores them and fights over the last one every time :)  Don't be tempted to leave anything out, they're not quite as good unless you make the sauce with all the ingredients. If you've never tried fish tacos because you think it sounds just plain weird, I promise you won't be sorry...

Made these for my family and they were a serious hit. Even my grandchildren loved them. To save time I used beer battered fish sticks. I also added finely minced onions and avocado slices. Easy to make and affordable filling meal! Can't go wrong with this recipe. The sauce is top notch!

Loved this recipe. Doubled up the cornstarch to give the batter more crunch and added a heaped teaspoon of honey to the sauce as it was a tad too tart for my tastes, the kids loved it too!

To save time I buy the frozen breaded fish patties or frozen fish fillets.  Both are a time and calorie saver.  The sauce if wonderful and I always double it as it is devoured!

Just made it for my family and they loved it!  I used cat fish and tilapia.  I did not fry it but grilled it for a healthier meal.  My family loved the dressing.  This is a filling meal and great summer meal for guest!

Made these for the first time, could not believe how good they are.  Used fresh cod and deep fried them using an outdoor fryer.  This is going to be a summer treat.

I changed up the recipe just a bit. more of an Italian version. I added 2 tbs of Marcarpone' to the white sauce. It makes it velvety smooth.  I also, cheated with using Gorton's (Real Fish, original) and baked them then added. Using the new El Paso soft bowls make a great presentation.

My husband does a lot of travel to California and thinks that this sauce is very similar to the fish taco sauce he gets while traveling. I usually cheat and buy Dr Praeger's fish sticks instead of frying up my own fish. This recipe is always a winner in our house!

I was very disappointed in the beer batter mixture because this recipe has gotten such great reviews. It was very bland, so next time I will salt the fish as it comes out of the oil. The white sauce came out pretty good, I had to tone down the heat for myself since I'm 8 months pregnant and heatburn is my number one enemy. So I cut down on the cayenne pepper and did not add the jalapenos either. Also, I did not put dill weed either since I am not too familiar with it. And next time I will top with cabbage and cilantro. Most authentic tacos have cilantro and cabbage on top anyway.

This is a regular meal for us now.  The batter makes the perfect fish for tacos (we typically do tilapia).  The sauce is excellent, though it improves with time so try to make it a few hours early if not the day before to allow the flavors to come together.  Do be sure to include the jalapeno and capers for bite.  I use mostly sour cream with a dot of mayo instead of yogurt, since I like the additional tang and it works well with tacos.  Serve with pico de gallo or salsa and fresh cilantro.

This recipe was fantastic.  I sauteed the fish (with cajun seasoning) rather than deep frying to make it a little healthier.  The sauce was the bomb.

These tacos were fantastic! I didn't batter or deep fry my cod but lightly pan fried. The sauce is spicy but soooo addicting! This will be made over and over again in my home! Thanks for such a great recipe! Oh and I used a nonfat plain Greek yogurt and Bestfood light mayo and the sauce was still very creamy and yummy!

I am also from San Diego and I found this recipe to be very good. I like the white sauce but next time I might try celantro instead of dill. I was out of cod so I substituted yellowtail which worked out great.

These were FABULOUS! Love the beer batter! 
I am going to make this batter again, but for fish and chips. 

The white sauce is great, I would go a little less on the mayo next time though. Overall, this is a new family favorite!

This dish is easy and delicious! Used flour tortillas (what we had on hand) and added some fresh avocados, pico de gallo, and topped it off with fresh cilantro from the garden. Made the batter with Marzen beer from Gordon Biersch, which made for a great, flaky, golden batter.  Delightful summer dish!

Great recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients for the white sauce but I improvised and it was great. I think I'll use frozen fish next time to cut down on the prep time.

Thanks a bunch!

YEAH!!!!! Big hit I made this last night for a date she loved me cooking for her. I thought this is easy so I'll make it. They were the best fish tacos I have ever had. Do yourself a favor and DOUBLE the sauce you make. Read the other reviews and they will all say make more sauce.

I made this sauce with all sour cream and used the "Fiery Fish Tacos" corn salsa recipe with it. I grilled the fish in a frying pan. Everyone loved it! Highly recommended.

Delicious! Like many, I didn't do the breaded to save on a few calories, especially with the mayo sauce and all. (which was great!) I went a little light on cayenne and jalapeno and it still had a zip. I seasoned the fish with cayenne, garlic powder, paprika salt and pepper. Don't be afraid to go generous on seasoning the fish, too... I think I went a bit too light. Definitely something I'll make for a group that's pretty easy, but very pretty! Especially with a little cilantro and lime off to the side and some black beans.. yum!

This recipe was a HIT last night for dinner. We always ordered fish tacos whenever we go to our favorite Mexican restaurant but they NEVER taste this good. I followed a review to use sour cream instead of yogurt & Oh my this was HEAVEN!!!!! This recipe will be a staple now in this household. My girlfriend raved about it so much, not to mention we had leftovers & it was still ooh so yummy. Thanks for sharing.

This review begins with an error, and it gets a 5 based on my mistake. I just blazed ahead and popped all the dry spices in with the flour, and wondered how people could say the batter didn't have much flavour with all these spices.  THEN I noticed  the spices were to go in the sauce, not the batter. Oops!  But what a wonderful mistake.  This batter had amazing flavour.  So I recommend putting the dry spices in with the flour.  Put them in the sauce as well. I don't think you will be disappointed.

I'm not big on eating seafood, but these were fantastic. At first they were only a one-time deal to use cabbage we had left over from colcannon, but now we have made it repeatedly and it is still a family favorite.

Made these tonight. First time I made fish tacos. I made them with Halibut and cooked in small pieces. Everyone loved them and said to make them again. I mixed the white sauce with the cabbage and added 1/4 cup cilantro and tossed it all together before putting on tacos. Also topped off with a little  cubed avocado and tomato. You will not be disappointed.

Delicious. Great batter. However, WAY too much Cayenne pepper for my taste in the white sauce ~ it was super spicy.  I would recommend maybe 1/4 teaspoon instead of 1 teaspoon for those who don't like too much spice.

We haven't tried the fish part yet (we just baked up some fresh-caught trout)but we tried the sauce and it was fabulous!  Second time we had it, we added some smoky chipotle seasoning and that rocked!! Thanks for the great recipe!  Shared it with 2 friends already. :)

The beer batter and white sauce are unbelievable! I tweaked the slaw, making it with shredded cabbage, lime juice and a drizzle of honey.  I also added some home made black bean and corn salsa.  Our friends request these now whenever they come over.

Have to say I was really disappointed. Seemed like a straight forward recipes with great reviews. But it had NO flavor what so ever! People who raved bat it had clearly made some changes. Sauce was ok, but the batter needs more kick as it's very bland....

Amazing! I omitted the baking powder because I didnt have any, and used tilapia. Also left out dill weed, added a few sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning, and substituted the yogurt and mayo for 1 cup of sour cream. Delish! The fish turned out so crispy! My husband said, "I would pay for this!" Hahaha

Excellent!! I did not have fresh lime or a jalapeno, so I substituted lime juice instead. I was wary of the sauce on it's own, but it was a Fantastic match with the fish! We topped with iceburg lettuce, diced tomato, red onion and sour cream - what we had on hand. Can't wait to make this one again!!

Super savory and delish!!! I love the sauce!! I used a snapper and halibut blend. In the batter for the fish i added some cajun seasoning to add more flavor. I added fresh sliced olives and pico de gallo on top. i had some extra fried fish pieces left over and my three year old daughter ate them up!! I really recommend that you fry the tortillas until they are just a little crispy it really makes a difference and made every thing that much better ( i used whole wheat, thats what i had on hand) all in all great recipe. I can't wait to have my husband try it! =D

Absolutely scrumptious!! I served these with a side of cucumber and red-onion relish marinated in red vinegar and a quick homemade salsa (which was more like a pico). My only suggestion, as has been noted in other reviews, is seasoning the fish more. I added some seasoning but not nearly enough. Overall, though, I would take this recipe hands-down over restaurant fish tacos - and that's saying a lot! Even my husband, who hates fish, ate one and liked it. This recipe will become a staple in my home. Superb!

These are plain awesome! The white sauce is amazing, and I used 3/4 of a jalapeno, and the heat was perfect. At first we realised that there was going to be enough to invite a friend over for dinner, but he couldn't make it. We had the lefftovers for lunch the next day, they were that good! His loss!

The sauce is money.  I generally hate cabbage in any form, but this was the perfect blend of flavor and crunch. I will definitely use this one again.

These are are sooo good that I'm eating them as I type this review. I'm a sophomore in college from Charleston, SC. I LOVE FISH I've been eating it just about everyday since I came back to school in august. I'll tell you guys the truth, fish tacos were one thing I said I'd never eat, but I was young and very ignorant. With the way I have been eating fish I have been wanting to try new recipes and fish tacos were naturally up next. Boy am I glad I did! The sauce was the best part! I was a little weary of the capers since I have never had them nor heard of them. The fish was bland though, but probably due to errors on my part as I'm a novice when it comes to cooking. But it was still great because of the sauce!. I took the adivce of some other reivewers and added pico de gallo which always makes a taco better, about mincing the capers super duper small, about using ginger ale if your out of beer, and using cole slaw mix to save time. I think I'll toss the capers next time I just ate one, gross.  But overall this was an awsome recipe and very quick for people who have no time such as myself.

This was the first time I've ever had much less made fish tacos.  I had to make the batter as gluten free as possible so I used gluten free all purpose flour,gluten free beer, and gluten free mayo.  Hopefully I'll be able to make gluten free tortillas next time.  With a little better planning, I really think the entire recipe could be made gluten free without sacrificing any taste!

These are delicious!  I don't have a deep fryer so I just pan fried the beer battered fish in some olive oil on the stove.  They turned out beautifully!  The sauce is absolutely delicious.

Wow.... I made these tonight and they were seriously the best fish tacos I have ever had, and I order them everywhere. I grilled the fish and definitely threw lime in the pico and they turned out excellent. I prepared the batter with Dos Equis Amber, which made these the most interesting fish tacos in the world. Cheers.

I actually use Panko bread crumbs rather than battering the fish.  This provides an extra crunch to go along with the crispness of the cabbage.  I also spice up the excellent sauce even more as we're big fans of spicy. :)

Even my super picky 7 year old loved them. The sauce was great!  Normally we use halibut but the cod wasn't bad at all!

My kids went crazy for these fish tacos.  I omitted the jalapeños and capers and used tilapia instead of cod.  This recipe is a keeper.  Delicioso.

I followed this recipe exactly as written for the beer batter and it was delicious. For the sauce i used bell pepper in place of jalepenos and i'm glad i did since the specified cayenne was more than enogh heat for this new mexican. Overall a fabulous recipe i look forward to making again.

Really, it's about the sauce.  Instead of half mayo, I use greek yogurt.  It's thick and much healthier than half mayo. I use it on everything.. from dip to salads. So good!

A staple in our household now.  We use a milder pepper than jalapeno though usually.

I absolutely love the sauce with these tacos.  I grill my fish Talapia or Cod and my family prefers Broccolli Slaw to cabbage slaw.  This one of our favorite meals to eat.

I tried this with tilapia instead of the cod. I think the batter came out a little bland, but the sauce was phenomenal!

This is one of our favorites. After the first time, we decided to season the fish with Cajun seasoning and bake. So much easier and healthier! We like it better, too! I use less cayenne in the sauce to make it kid-friendly. This dinner is in regular rotation!

Wow BREESE, these fish tacos are the best i've ever made. The sauce is outstanding! I didn't try the batter since I had leftover fish which I squeezed lime juice on and heated in the microwave. I also had shredded coleslaw mix on hand and used that as well as tomatoes and cilantro. Fried the corn tortillas till crispy. Oh man, what a winning combo! Thanks so much for posting this amazing recipe. I've made other fish tacos but this is the best ever. My search is over.

We tried this recipe without the Jalapeños, and used a vanilla creme yogurt and absolutely loved it. We tried it with a plain yogurt and it wasn't as good. We had it every Friday during Lent!

I tried this recipe and enjoyed it. Even my mother, who has never eaten a fish taco and thought it was an odd combination, liked them, too! And, the sauce was fabulous -- even better the next day. I also used this batter for shrimp as well and it was a big hit

These were phenomenal!  I just dipped my fish in milk and flour and pan fried.  I also grilled some of it.  Both were good.  But the slaw mix and the white sauce are outrageous together.  It made this a fantastic meal.  My parents, who looked at me like I had 4 heads when I suggested fish tacos, couldn't get enough of this meal.  Yum!

Great recipe! I was out of plain yogurt, so i used 1/4 c lowfat vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup light sour cream for the 1/2 cup of yogurt. Worked great! I will definitely be making this again!

Very Easy! The family loved them! I did, however, cut my fish pieces a bit too big at first. The batter really puffs up, so I made the pieces smaller to account for the puffy batter fitting in the tortilla. I made fish roll up sandwiches the next day with xtra large whole wheat wraps, shredded cheddar, shredded cabbage and the white sace. Delicious!

THESE WERE SO GOOD. I'VE MADE THESE 2 OR 3 TIMES WITH THE FISH. THIS TIME I USED GRILLED SHRIMP SEASONED WITH CHILI POWDER, SALT, LIME JUICE, AND OLIVE OIL. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY YOGURT SO I USED SOUR CREAM. I SERVED MINE ON LOW CARB SHELLS AND EVERYONE ELSE HAD CORN SHELLS. VERY GOOD

These were pretty good.  I was trying to match the sauce of a local restaurant, and it was close.  I also cheated and used Gordon's frozen fish due to time.  I'm sure that if I made it exactly like it's supposed to be, it would be really great, but the fish I used was pretty good too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Went fishing today and decided to use this recipe to make some fish tacos ! They came out WAY better than I thought they would. The capers seemed kind of odd and we couldn't really taste them so they could probably be omitted if you don't have them on hand, but they are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and easy too ! Thanks !

Absolutely delicious!  The sauce was a little spicy for my kids, so we just let them do plain yogurt (which means more sauce for us, hee hee).  We love these!

I loved this recipe.  But I think everything was a little understated. I'm not a person who's into really spicy food so I cut way back on the jalapeno so that left the sauce kind of mild so I added a little more dill and cumin.  I used Orange Roughy and Tilapia because that was all I had.  I seasoned the fish before dipping it in the batter because the first few pieces I made came out kind of bland.  I also used fish that was still a little frozen.  That made it easier to work with.  But this was delicious. My husband chose not to have his tortillas fried. He said it was too much grease.

Great recipe!  The sauce is truly awesome.  The whole family loves these fish tacos and I like to treat the neighbors when I make these, they all love it when I make fish tacos.

I followed the recipe as written. These were good, but not spectacular.  The beer batter was a nice consistency.  My kids weren't a big fan of them, but I think I'd have preferred them with flour tortillas instead of corn.  The sauce was tasty, but mine was a bit on the thin and runny side.

This tasted really good, but it was a lot of work. I made the batter, white sauce, and pico de gallo (which really was a nice addition)  but I didn't fry the fish. I used just a couple tbsp's oil in a fry pan...I feel healthier. I also only used half tsp cayenne so I could taste more than just hottness.

I hate to review *just the batter*, but after the thick, puffy, and just plain to die for results of the batterd fish I had to!  5 stars.  Will definately try complete recipe later.

This recipe was amazing.  The sauce makes it, I actually forgot to get dill weed at the store so I left that out and added some dried parsley.  Other than that I followed the recipe. I served it with homemade refried beans and spanish rice. My boyfriend loved it too, he was still talking about it this morning.

i mostly chose this recipe for the sauce and i'm so glad i did! the only thing i changed was to leave out the oregano and to use half the amount of mayo. turned out spectacularly! tangy and spicy and full of flavor. as far as the fish goes, i just covered some tilapia fillets with a decent amount of cajun seasoning and grilled them for a few minutes til they were moist and delicious. what an awesome combination! the cajun spices perfectly complimented the tangy sauce. throw on a little freshly made pico de gallo and some avocado slices and you've got an unbelievable delicious AND healthy dinner!

The batter for the fish was absolutly fabulous.  I've even used it for other stuff such as shrimp and mushrooms.  I was questionable about the sauce but on the taco, holy cow it was great!  Being that it lent right now we will defantly make these again infact tonight I'm making them.  Top notch, THX!

Made these Friday for Lent.  The sauce really made it, leaves room for seasoning more if necessary.  I used Tilapia, it's texture stood up to the batter.  Would like to try with grilled fish filets and will pass along recipe to family and friends.

These tacos came out fabulous!!  I used tilapia and made the sauce with sour cream instead of plain yogurt.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  We will definitely be adding this to the rotation. :)

I've made this a few times now. The first time I tried it with halibut, then another time with butter fish and red snapper.  The halibut tastes the best. I didn't change anything in the recipe, but I will say that thick Greek yogurt does give the sauce better texture and richer taste.  Excellent sauce, excellent batter...a winner recipe.

I make the sauce anytime I make mexican! My husband lived in San Diego and has always complained a bout not being able to find a good fish taco since he left. I told him I was going to try and he told me not to even bother. Well he was SOO glad that I did. I have made this with different kinds of fish but grouper is the best to use.

I thought this "tartar sauce" was absolutely awesome.  It really went well with a white fish.  I omitted the cabbage because of preference and broiled the fish due to weather permitting and lower fat recipe. Yummy fish tacos!!!!

This recipe was really fantastic!  I was so pleased with how the sauce turned out - even my 5-year old was asking for more!  I did add a few more sauces - some homemade (very garlicky) salsa and a store-bought tomatillo salsa.  You should definitely make the sauce at least 4 hours in advance, just to let the flavors mingle.  I'm looking foward to trying this same dish with grilled fish too, mmmm, yummy!

These tacos were delicious!  I  pan-seared tilapia in olive oil and seasoned with a little fajita seasoning instead of deep frying.  I was searching for something fun to do with tilapia.  Next time, I will get the cod and follow the recipe for that.  The sauce is amazing.  I only used a dash of red pepper and a teaspoon of chopped jalapenos so that my kids would enjoy it.  I would serve these for  company.  Yum!  I think this sauce would be delicious on crab cakes too!

These were delicious. I did use flour tortillas as we prefer them and did not put as much cayenne pepper as it called for but it was really good. I doubled the sauce but won't next time. It would have made plenty. I also didn't use near the amount of oil it called for. I didn't use a deep fryer, just put some oil in a skilled and then flipped the fish when one side was done. Much less oil involved so therefore healthier. Would definitely make again.

These were just ok.   A little too greasy between frying the fish and the tortillas.  Tried the tortillas without frying them and they were too dry.  Sauce was good. Maybe I'll try again with flour tortillas.

Excellent!  The sauce is what makes it.  I did pan fry fish that had been coated with a flour mix with a little taco seasoning and it turned out great.  I doubled the sauce and found it too be way to much.  Even the picky fish eaters in my family really enjoyed them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used tilapia instead of cod and modified this recipe to be gluten free and both my husband and I thought the tacos were delicious.  I used Red Mill GF flour, Green's GF beer, and ALL corn tortillas.  I served with purple cabbage and sliced avocados to add a little more texture.  I don't like too spicey, so I cut all the spicey ingredients in half and the white sauce had just enough spice to satisfy. I also don't have a deep fryer, so I just heated up some oil in a pan and cooked the fish about 2-3 minutes on each side and it turned out great.  Sometimes GF flour doesn't fry or cook as well as regular flour, but it was suitable for this recipe. Yummeez!

Loved it! I added Old Bay to season the fish more and cilantro to the cabbage mix. This would be a great dish for a party.

First I will say that I didn't use beer, I used ginger ale.  I was a little concerned about how these would turn out (with my moderation I mean) despite all of these amazing reviews, but these were amazing!  The sauce is literally the best sauce I've ever had on a fish taco.  My husband and I don't have a super high tolerance for heat in our food, so I might decrease the cayenne pepper to maybe 3/4 tsp or 1/2 tsp.  Other than that, this was an awesome recipe. We will for sure use it again!

Phenomenal. The batter seemed thick at first but it did the job to cover the fish the way it should. Fried to a crisp golden brown. The white sauce is out of this world, though I did omit the capers. Seasonings were just right. Nice spice. Enjoyed with a nice golden ale. Perfect.

Great Tacos. Made as written. I only gave 4 stars as we thought the batter could have been better tasting (used Sam Adams) need to add more beer and and maybe some spice to the batter. The white sauce was excellent.

I made these tonight for dinner and I thought they were great!  I am a big fan of Rubio's fish tacos and I was looking for something like the fish taco's at Rubio's.  Since Rubio's puts pizza sauce in the taco I thought I would try that and it turned out fantastic. A thin layer of pizza sauce on the tortilla was the only change I made and I feel it made all the difference in taste of the fish taco.

Well, I thought I would try this-something different, I thought and I felt like fish of some sort. I have to say that the comment on "my husband and I went mmmmmmmmm" is the first words out of your mouth when these are made. This was Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!!! This should be known as the recipe that makes you go mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!

This is one of my favorite recipes but preparing the fish is neither quick or easy. Do your self a favour and buy your breaded fish at Costco (Trident brand). It is good fish and they only sell it at Costco where here in Az. Getr a bag of cole slaw at the store and chop cilantro. It is so quick this way, that I found myself up at 3AM fixing them in 15 mins. honestly, these are awesome!

I used cod which I suateed and broke up into pieces.  I also added some chopped up mango to the sauce for a little sweetness.  These are awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is sooooo good.  I live in Southern California and have places that serve fish tacos all over the place and this recipe is by far better than any of those places.  The white sauce really takes it over the top.  Love it!!

Maybe fish tacos are an acquired taste.  These were fair, but I wouldn't make them over and over again.  The white sauce was used over mexican beans & rice the next day.  The fish in this recipe was just bland.

Love it.  My go-to fried fish batter from now on.  Sometimes I add some spice to it because my husband likes spicy food.  And, I like chili-mayo on the taco but this batter is awesome.  We used Bass Ale in it.

YUMMY!!!!  I put a little seasoning in my batter to give the fish some flavor. I used Creole seasoning.  Very simple and easy to make.  Word of advice, make double sauce, that is the best part!!

This is quite bland. The fish tastes like nothing really...just extremely battered (no I didn't whisk it too hard or long).  The sauce and cabbage was a bit boring so I added homemade pico de gallo.  I ended up loving a fishless version with just the pico and cabbage mix in a slightly fried tortilla with a bit of shredded cheese on top.  If I make this again I will add some seasoning to the beer-batter.

Awesome!  The sauce is a hit...I've made it several times the past few months, and sometimes I even dream about it!  I've eaten purchased frozen prepared fish (i.e. Gorton's, etc.) just to have something quick to use the sauce on!

Ok. Here goes...  The white sauce was great...  I went with a suggestion from another review & used sour cream & mayo. The fish was ok IMHO because Talapia is'nt the best fish around yet it is an all around good fish. I don't typiclly like fried fish but wanted my wife to try fish tacos & she is NOT a fish person.  All said she did like the tacos so that's a win...  Next time I'm going to use a mahi mahi steak seasoned, grilled and cut into strips.  I may try chipolte paste instead of the jalepeno.  All in all this is a great way to introduce a non- fish eater to fish tacos...  Thanks for the white sauce recipe...

I fried Tilapia, the batter was great and the sauce divine.  The sauce should rest in the fridge a few hours before using.  Although I enjoyed the tacos' the family rated them a 3.

Perfect!  I used ONE chipolte instead of a jalepeno and added a couple tsps of adobe sauce to the white (now pink) sauce.  It was great.  I hate frying fish in my house though -- next time I may buy the fillets already fried OR try making it lighter by grilling some tilapia.

We changed nothing on this recipe! It's been a fav of ours for weeks now & will be for years to come! Fabulous recipe! Super tasty, great for serving to friends, easy enough for a "work night" meal.  Is there a 6 star rating??

Everything about this recipes is fantastic. Husband declared this to be the best recipe we've tried from allrecipes. The only change I made was to use haddock.  Delicious.

I only used the white sauce part of this recipe. It was a big big hit!! I excluded the capers. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe that I made it from scratch!

This is sooo good and tastes just like San Diego! I miss it so much and I don't have a Rubio's nearby! I've made it several times already and didn't even have enough time to review it! It is PERFECT! No variation to it! Thank you so much for the recipe!

NOTE: I've made this a MILLION times now! It never gets old. It is so GOOD! LOVE LOVE it!

NEW NOTE: IF I COULD GIVE THIS MORE STARS I WOULD!!!! LOVE IT!!!! THANK YOU!

What a nice surprise!  I did not expect this to be so delicious.  I followed someone's review to double the sauce since I am a 'sauce' lover however I ended up with an extra cup of sauce... Recipe is great as written, Thank You!!

If you will be feeding kids, obviously you need to lay off the peppers. I only used half the cayenne and it will still pretty spicy, I would say 1/4 would be perfect. These were delicious and made my inability to get to the coast a little easier to handle, thanks!

I used Halibut instead of Cod, and I also used a Panko bread crumb instead of the suggested coating.  I didn't have any cayenne, so I omitted it, but this was absolutely fantastic, the sauce is amazing, and I think it would also go good on a taco salad or something.  Mmmmm....

great tacos! Due to the summer heat I decided to grill the fish as it seems to be a bit lighter than the deep frying. Did a dry rub prior and added a little fresh lime juice. Turned out wonderful. AS far as the sauce goes I added a little more heat with the addition of 2 more jalapenos; one being red for color. Definitely making this one at the fire station again

These where terrific! I followed the recipe for the most part. However, I only added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder and used walleye fish. Easy to make. Family loved them. I did serve mine with the sauce, but also put fresh salsa and guacamole on our tacos. Yummmmm.

Yum Yum Yum! We had fish tacos for the first time on vacation in Florida & have been craving them ever since. I actually grilled my fish because we don't eat fried foods but the combination of this slaw, which is awesome & the fish was perfect!!

Delicious! I've made this many times, and each time I use crispy fish sticks. I've used corn tortillas, and soft wheat tortillas, which I prefer for adding a healthy touch. Once in a while, I'll toss a bit of garlic salt into the white sauce and use fat free mayo with the yogurt. No matter how you make this up, you're going to love it. After assembling the taco, sometimes I'll put a little salsa and/or a small squirt of ranch if the white sauce comes out too spicy (I use the whole jalapeno, seeds and all). Remember, lots of cabbage. A wonderful recipe, I highly recommend it.

My whole family loves this recipe.  The white sauce and the cabbage are perfect toppings for these tacos.  I omit the jalapenos and capers from the sauce and it still turns out great.  Since nobody in my family likes corn tortillas, I serve them on flour tortillas.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I've been making these for about two years now and I think the best way to make them is to make the white sauce the day before so that the flavors blend well. Also, after lightly flouring the fish, adding a little bit of Cajun seasoning and after frying them, adding a little bit of salt, this gives them more flavor. Make sure to use good quality beer as well, I've tried it with the cheap stuff and the batter is not as light and crisp. Everything else is exceptional....soooo good on a hot summer day!

I went the quick way and used frozen beer battered fish so I can't comment on the fish.  The white sauce however was amazing.  I'll be making this any time I have fish from now on.  Had the perfect amount of zing to it!

UPDATE: INITIALLY MY (NOW) HUBS AND I THOUGHT THESE WERE JUST "OK," BUT WITH A FEW CHANGES, THIS HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR FAVORITE MEALS (AND QUITE POSSIBLY BETTER THAN OUR LOCAL MEXICAN HANGOUT'S TACOS). I FIND THAT CORONA IS THE PERFECT BEER FOR THIS BATTER (THE BONUS??? I HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO MAKE BEER MARGARITAS!). I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT A MILDLY WARM (200 DEGREE) OVEN IS PERFECT FOR KEEPING MY FISH WARM BETWEEN BATCHES. MY FISH ALWAYS REMAINS AS CRISPY AS IT WAS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE FRYER. A COUPLE OF FINAL TIPS - A) SALT EACH PIECE OF FISH IMMEDIATELY UPON REMOVING FROM THE FRYER (ADDS FLAVOR) AND B) ADD A SQUEEZE OF LIME TO EACH TACO (YUM!). THESE SIMPLE STEPS HAVE HUGE IMPACT!!! My bf and I have been craving fish tacos ever since making SCARY76's fish tacos a few months ago (which were mediocre at best). I'm not sure whether these taste anything like Rubio's (the chain is not local to Chicago), but they were decent nonetheless. I guess I'm just a sucker for the real deal - you just can't beat fresh fish tacos from the little vendor stands in San Diego, IMHO.  Other than having a little trouble with the batter sticking to our fry basket (it was quite messy), these turned out as expected. Assembled as recommended with the addition of a dollop of fresh pico de gallo, made for a nice presentation. Tortilla chips and Bacardi mojitos completed our meal. All in all, these were good, but not "blow your socks off good" as the ratings suggest. Thanks anyways, roweena :)

The sauce was awesome.  The fish itself was a little bland.  I think it may be better with a marinade before the breading.

I have made these several times...love it. The sauce is the best, I don't like too hot so I don't add Jalapenos. And I have made with sour cream, yogurt...what ever I have on hand and it is ALWAYS delicious. Also when in a hurry I use frozen fish filets of course not as terrific but a great substitute when in a hurry.

I made this for my husband on Father's Day and he loved it. He has made them in the past but this recipe seemed more authentic because of the white sauce and corn tortillas.

Fabulous!  I used fresh water Bluegill for this recipe.  The batter would be better on a naturally thicker piece of fresh water fish like Pike or Walleye, which we will use next time.  The sauce is a perfect complement.  We ran out of tortillas and finished using the sauce on the fish.  Makes a great tartar sauce on it's own.  I admit, I was skeptical to try this recipe, but I'm sure glad I did.  5 stars!

This is a hard one to rate..i liked it, the batter was awsome the sauce was a bit hot for me,ok alot hot for me which took away the flavour so i'm not sure that i got the full taste. They are easy to make and i think i would use different shells next time. if anything else i certainly have a great recipie for fish and chips now.

Great recipe!  The sauce is amazing. I modified it a bit using some of the suggestions here - I used fresh cilantro instead of oregano, 1 tsp fresh dill, used 3/4 cup nonfat yogurt and 1/4 cup light miracle whip (next time I might try all yogurt!), used 1/2 tsp canned jalepenos and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (we found this to be the right amount of heat - the full amount would have been mind blowing!).  Like some others, I used tilapia fish and grilled it with just some salt, pepper and lime juice squeezed over it (healthier choice than frying) Absolutely delicious - will definitely be making again!

Very good!...I had planned on grilling the fish, but was out of gas in the grill, so I did fry them, and they were excellent!...the sauce was great,but I found out that I'm not a big fan of cumin, still like it tho.

This batter was great!  I used a Mexican beer, and used Greek yogurt (Fage) for the sauce.  I wanted to subsitute pickles for the capers, but we were out of relish.  We are not fans of capers.

The white sauce is what makes this recipe! I used light maynaise and fat free yogart and it still turned out awsome.We had fresh snapper that we caught and battered it with Mckormics Cajun batter. Use whatever fish you want and batter it however you want, it is the sauce that makes the taco.

I would give this 5 stars, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. I did not batter my own fish, I used pre-battered frozen fish and I hate it when people change a recipe and them rate it 5 stars. The sauce is amazing, spicy enough but the cooling from the mayo and yogurt is  soothing. I love this recipe and make it often!

These tacos are AMAZING!!!  I went for a healthier option and grilled my fish with lime and jalepeno juices and it was amazing.  The white sauce is so good, my picky fiance loved it!!!!

The sauce was just okay for me. I liked it by itself with the fish, but the flavor combinations when the tacos were assembled wasn't what I was looking for.  The FISH on the other hand, was AMAZING. Perfection.

I love this sauce.  I replaced the plain yogurt with sour cream because that is what I had on hand.  I sautéed the fish instead of frying it, but do plan on trying the batter recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

The sauce was spicy. I loved it but it was too spicy for the rest of the family. Maybe too many peppers when I did it. Fun to make.

This turned out awesome! - just made it last night.  I had both yogurt & sour cream & I meant to use the recipe "as is", since that's how I rate.  It wasn't until I removed the tortillas from the fridge & saw the yogurt unopened was when I realized I didn't use yogurt!  In any event, sour cream was just fine. I also used fresh dill since I had it on hand & didn't want it to go to waste. I'll have to mkae this again & use yogurt.   I made it in addition to the Pico De Gallo from this site & it was perfect!  Thank you!!!

I give the beer batter 5+ stars. I've never made fish that way before and it came out great! I used Dover sole, which I don't think was a good idea because the fish was a little mushy. Great flavor and super crunchy though! The sauce...that I only give 2.5 stars. It was just ok, not even "good". I followed the recipe to a "T" so it wasn't something I did. I can see potential in it however. What I don't see is why so many people raved over it. Overall, this recipe was good, but needs some tweeking

These were great!  As others have said, the sauce was fabulous...I added a bit more salt and a twist or two of fresh ground pepper and it was perfect!  I also used sour cream instead of yogurt.  Will use the leftovers on some chicken tacos today and plan to freeze the rest - I've had pretty good luck freezing sauces like this before.  I also made some sauteed onions and peppers with a bit of kosher salt, fresh pepper, and lime juice, since my boyfriend doesn't like creamy sauces and it was a nice touch.  To the batter I also added a pinch of cayenne and thought it turned out nice and crispy, not too heavy like some beer batters can be.  Definitely a favorite, and going into the regular rotation!  ***Edit - instead of freezing the extra sauce,we actually used it as a chip dip - worked out great!  (I also used sour cream instead of yogurt)

Made with frozen fish fillets as that is what I had. Loved the sauce, be sure to use fresh lime and not bottled lime juice.

We were very skeptical. I've had fish tacos in some popular restaurants and didn't care for them. I thought I'd try these out and they were excellent!!! Even my picky teenagers ate them. We actually fought about the leftovers! I made them with store bought breaded cod so they are probably even better if you bread the fish yourself. I did leave out the capers and the sauce was a tad bit spicy . I would recommed adding the cayenne a little at a time to your taste.

Another 5 star from allrecipes! We made these with grouper instead of cod. Recipe is worth it just for the beer batter and the wonderful white sauce! I used greek yogurt, which tastes just like sour cream. I always feel healthy when I eat that. I also use greek yogurt as a potato chip dip, but I digress....  We accompanied it with homemade sangria and latin music, hubby says it should be more than 5 stars.

I'm originally from southern CA. where fish taco's are very popular. So I have had my share of good ones. I have since moved away to Northern CA. where the fish taco isn't as popular. Anyways, I had a hankering for some and decided to make my own. Saw this recipe and gave it a try. REALLY yummy! I have used tilipia, cod and halibut, and all versions are good. I have fried them and when I want a bit healthier, I grill the fish. Either way they are very tasty. Tho the fried version is more authentic. I serve with this sauce, Amy's Cilantro sauce from this site, cabbage and lime wedges and it's a little bit of heaven in a corn tortilla!
