I must give this recipe 5 stars for the use of coconut oil. It gives plain store bought graham crackers more depth. This was a fun recipe to make with my 8 year old daughter! Best indoor s'mores recipe I've tried!

I have tried this twice and it fell apart both times. I have a few complaints about the coconut oil. It completly changes up the flavor of the s'more and coconut oil is 120 calories per tablespoon!  I did use the idea of broiling the mallows in the oven. I put the whole graham crackers on tin foil, spread chocolate over the center, cut my mallows in half and placed them on either side of the break line, and broiled. This make a perfect treat! I kept an eye on them too so they wouldn't burn. It took about a minute on low broil until they were perfectly brown on the top and since they are halved, enough of them cooked. mmmm.

*Nobody* doesn't like s'mores! There's something about that roasted marshmallow flavor... I used 2/3 chocolate chips and 1/3 very high quality 88% chocolate, and it was still plenty sweet for this dark chocolate connoisseur. I will add more coconut oil to the graham crackers next time, as they were a little crumbly. It took longer to set the chocolate/marshmallow than indicated- use common sense.

As I made these, I kept in mind that people said they fell apart.  I threw them in the freezer for about 5 minutes as a final step before cutting them.  They came out just like the picture.  Also, it did take longer in the broiler and I had to gently coax them along to brown.  I use coconut oil all the time!  I don't use it with brownies as I prefer  not to have that coconut taste. I haven't had these yet, so can't comment.  Thrilled with how easy they were to make.

I made this and when I tried to serve it the graham cracker crust was not firm.  It ended up very messy, good, but messy.  It seems like the crust should be baked to firm it up.

DEE-LISHUS!! Yes, the bottom was a bit crumbly, but still delicious. I will try with a bit more coconut oil next time, as I did not need as much with the chocolate. Our nanny (who is well aware of my culinary ineptitude) couldn't believe I had made something so yummy.

Taste was yummy, but my graham cracker crust did not hold up like it did in the video.

I'm so sad about this recipe- I really wanted it to turn out!  Unfortunately the graham bottom completely crumbled and fell apart and the chocolate didn't spread correctly over the graham either.  I ended up with roasted marshmallows stuck to ugly chocolate and a few graham crumbs.

I will make it again but I will  never turn my back on it when broiling! I will also reduce the coconut oil a little. It was a bit too  soft and fell apart easily. I was very pleased to find a smores recipe that didn't use graham cereal. Way too sweet for me.

I followed directions to a tee but after the broiler the chocolate would not re-harden. Wish I just used chocolate bar pieces.

Coconut oil ruined the taste.  I like the idea but not the new taste.  I will try this again but I will use something other than coconut oil.
