The recipe title is correct because this really is "quick" to prepare.  I will say that it did have a nice light taste, but I felt the dressing really was lacking in flavor.  It was good for lunch today, sprinkled with a few  toasted slivered almonds, and the olive oil coated the greens nicely, but I'll probably stick with another strawberry salad recipe which is even lower in fat.  Nonetheless, a nice recipe for sure.

Great base recipe. I spiralized and marinated my cucumbers in the dressing with fresh chopped mint. Started with field greens, then topped with the cucumbers, sprinkled the sliced strawberries and garnished with feta cheese. I think my addition of mint and feta took this over the top.

Was very good but added feta cheese and mint as suggested and bumped up the dressing with a little maple syrup and dijon mustard

Really easy and nice salad to make alongside of anything bbq'd on a hot summer day.   I'll be using this recipe frequently over the next few months. Very nice.
