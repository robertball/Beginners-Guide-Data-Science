This is not a deep, dark chocolate cake, but it sure isn't short on rich chocolate flavor! This is an incredibly moist, stick to the tines of your fork cake, that baked nicely in two 9-inch layers in 25 minutes.  I didn't bother with the parchment paper and it released from the pans easily just sprayed with Baker's Joy. I didn't change a thing with this recipe, and won't the next time around either. It is delicious just as  written. Frosted with "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting," also from this site, this was a cake I'd be proud to serve anywhere.

help!! I made this exactly as instructed, thinking that this would be a no-fail cake, and I was wrong!
I don't know what I did wrong, as I said I followed everything written, can anyone tell me why it turned out sticky?
It's thick and didn't raise much, and you can see it's so moist inside it's not even a cake, not even a brownie, it's just a hard dense block of black stuff! :(
So disappointed~
someone please tell me what could cause this!

Love this recipe. I've tried other chocolate cakes from this site but this one is by far my FAVORITE. The cake is so moist and delicious with a great texture. In my opinion, it's the perfect chocolate cake. I don't have any of the problems other's have mentioned. I'm sure the problems are not with the recipe but it's that something is being done wrong.  Make sure to measure your ingredients correctly. NEVER EVER scoop flour, you have to spoon it into a level measuring cup and level it off. Scooping leads to too much flour in the cake which equals dry, crumbly..ect.. Be sure to level off the baking soda as well..If you taste baking soda in the cake you probably used too much. Cream the butter and sugar WELL. You cannot substitute the buttermilk in this recipe with regular milk UNLESS you add a tbs of lemon juice or white vinegar to it. Beat eggs in one at a time, mixing each one in completely. When alternately adding flour and milk, start and end with the flour. Also, DON'T OVERBAKE.

Excellent cake!  Very chocolately and moist.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I subbed whole milk soured with a tablespoon of white vineagar.  I also subbed a cup of hot coffee instead of the hot water.  Very tasty!  I frosted the cake with 'Creamy Chocolate Frosting' and put a layer of Raspberry Jam in the middle.  I got lots of compliments!  Definetly a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe for a moist rich chocolate cake!  I made cupcakes for a fourth of July party, and they were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, but they cooked in only 10 minutes.  I iced them with red, white, and blue butter cream icing.  I think the best tip for chocolate cake is to be sure to watch the time carefully.  If you over-bake it, the results are dry and bland.  If you time it right, this cake is perfect!  My husband absolutely loved it!  I will use this recipe from now on as my basic chocolate cake!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely butt blowing!  I loved it!  I made it for my mother, for my boyfriend, it rules!  I used chocolate ganache, a rich icing, which complements very well the moist texture of this butt blowing cake.  Fun for the whole family!  One thing I should mention - it took nearly an hour and fifteen minutes for this cake to cook.  I ran the toothpick test a few times until it was just right.  Don't be afraid to leave it in the oven until it is done!

No more Betty-in-the-box mixes for me.  This cake is great!  I, too, subbed hot coffee for the boiling water then stirred in about 1/2 C mini chocolate chips before pouring into a Bundt pan (baked for 38 min).  Once the cake cooled, I cut it in half horizontally and made about a 1 1/2" "trench" in the bottom half which I then filled with Pastry Cream (also on this site).  A simple chocolate glaze completed the top of the cake.  Thanks Jan!

I made this cake just as instructed.  It looked beautiful and was done in 40 min.  It just tasted bland.  Sorry.  I wanted to make a cake with some leftover buttermilk I had.  I guess frosting would make up for it?  I like my cakes really fudgy and chocolate tasting this one did not pass my test.

This is the first cake I ever baked from scratch, and it was exactly as she said -- no-fail and excellent.  (I even mixed things in the wrong order and it still turned out well.)  I didn't have buttermilk so I used a cup of whole milk + a tablespoon of lemon juice, but otherwise I used the recipe's ingredients.  It came out moist with the perfect density, and got rave reviews.

I made the cake exactly according to recipe. I did bake this in a greased 9x13 baking pan for just over 30 minutes. After it cooled, I made my own chocolate buttermilk frosting to spread over the top. Great basic homemade cake that used on hand ingredients and that's perfectly chocolate-y. To be honest, the frosting I paired with it really took it over the top. Just what I needed. I'll use this again in a couple days for my oldest boy's chocolate birthday cake.

This is still my all-time favorite chocolate cake!  It has never failed me and always gets raves!  The chocolate flavor is directly proportional to the quality of cocoa powder used.

PERFECT....for those of you who say there could be more of a "chocolate" flavor use hot coffee instead of the water. There are only 2 of us so I cut this in half easily and baked it in a 9X9 pan and flipped it out after baking and let it cool.....I then cut the cake in half and made 1/2 a chocolate layer cake w/chocolate butter cream frosting.  As I said....PERFECT!  Thank you so much for sharing this amazing and super simple recipe.

Let me start by saying I am a food writer and an excellent cook, but I am NOT a good baker. This recipe made me think I actually can bake...the cake is easy to make and tastes great!   I followed the recipe as written, using two round cake pans. When they were done (about 36 minutes in my oven), I let them cool, then trimmed them and stacked them together on a cake stand. I covered the stacked cake with a large inverted metal bowl and let it sit overnight. The next day, I frosted the cake using the Special Buttercream recipe on this site and finished it with a dusting of cocoa powder. I was nervous that the cake would dry out overnight, but it turned out to be a stroke of genius. Letting the cake sit overnight fused the two layers together without me having to put any frosting in between them. It also made the cake more dense and fudgy, while still retaining a nice cake texture and good crumb.  My husband always wants a "plain chocolate cake with white buttercream frosting" on his birthday, and this is THE recipe he now wants me to make him for all the years to come.

Not very chocolatey.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 cup of veg oil instead of all that butter.  I think between the lack of cocoa powder, the extra bulk of alot of flour for a cake and the buttermilk, you could do alot more.  Maybe try heating some bittersweet chocolate in the double boiler and mixing it in with the cake.  Either that or just go to a recipe that works like Hershey's.. just love that cake.

My daughter picked this out for her birthday cake.  She didn't want a dark chocolate cake or one made with coffee she wanted "just a normal chocolate cake, ya know?".... as for me-I liked the name ;) This is an easy recipe to put together and it baked up nicely.  I used a tube pan and baked for 35 minutes.  The cake has a nice, moist texture and a perfect chocolate flavor. We only tasted the cuttings from trimming the cake for decorating but I am sure looking forward to a whole slice of this cake! If this was not already "Jan's" chocolate cake it sure would be now! Delicious!

This is the best of the top rated chocolate cakes on this site. It uses more flour and less cocoa, no hot coffee, no vanilla, and no baking powder compared to the Black Magic cake from this site. It still uses the all-important buttermilk, and is so much simpler. But the flavor is a lot better! I used a top-quality cocoa powder and unsalted, sweet cream butter. (That really should be edited in the ingredient list...ultra important!) I frosted this with a simple buttercream (unsalted butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and milk) to rave reviews. It's a great, standard, chocolate cake and is SO MUCH BETTER than any boxed mix.

this cake is absolutely amazing! The texture is thick and dense, and its the perfect chocolate flavor..not too sweet and not too bitter. A nice light fluffy frosting compliments this cake perfectly. I loved this cake so much that I registered on this website just so I could write a review!!I also find that it takes a little longer to cook then the recipe says, so make sure to check it. Ive made this recipe time and time again and never had a single problem. Thanks mom71!!

This was good.  It turned out light and fluffy.  My one complaint is that it didn't seem chocolatey enough and was a light brown color.

Made this cake for my dad's 85th birthday, with requested Coconut Pecan Frosting II (from this site).  Since I had part of a can of evaporated milk from the frosting, I used it and filled the cup with skim for the cake.  Added lemon juice to make "buttermilk".  Can't understand the negative reviews for this cake.  I too had to bake extra time to get the middle done.  It was still a little gooey, but tasty!

Very excellant cake!  I just so happened to have buttermilk in the fridge.  I used this recipe to make individual ice-cream cakes.  I halved the recipe (except the cocoa - i used 3/4 of the original amount) and put it in a greased, powdered jelly-roll pan, lined with parchment paper.  It baked in 16 min - perfectly.  The top, bottom and sides were all the same color!  I used a large heart cookie cutter to cut 6 hearts (for 3 cakes).  I spread a qt. of Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream on another jelly roll pan lined with parchment, and cut 3 hearts when that was frozen solid.  Layer - cake, ice cream, cake, then iced with ganache - heavenly!!  The cake was not too sweet, and went perfectly with the icecream and ganache!

First cake from scratch I have made in years and it was no fail!  More like a German Chocolate flavor but very good all the same.  Don't be fooled by the thin batter...I kept saying while it was in the oven it was never going to set...but it looks better than MOST of my boxed mix cakes.  Will be making this again and again.

This cake is excellent! I make it for birthdays, dinner parties, and more! Since it is just basic chocolate it is easy to find ways to be creative with the shape and decoration. I would reccomend with basic chocolate frosting and raspberries round the edge. The best way to dress up any cake! (and it tastes great too!) :)

This was not the most wonderful chocolate cake ever, but pretty darn good, and easy.  I can taste a hint of the baking soda, but my husband didn't notice it.  It's nice and big --  rose to fill the 9X13 pan, and had a nice texture.  I suspect the people who had problems with it were possibly in high altitude areas, which would require some adjustments to any cake recipe. I'm near sea level.  I'd bake it again.

WOW!!! This cake was amazingly moist. I added 2tsp of vanilla and substituted 1 cup of good fresh hot coffee for the boiling water. I also let my eggs and butter come to room temp. My cake was completely baked in 50mins. I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting to complete this wonderfully moist and flavorful cake.

Delicious, moist cake. Really easy to make! Got lots of compliments. Worked well at high altitude. Substituted coffee for water.

The recipe is simple and easy to follow. The cake turned out nice and moist. 

I was a little worried when pouring in the boiling water because I use an electric cake mixer and the water was splashing about, so I did it real slowly and stood away from the mixer while it was mixing.

I would use this recipe again because the cake is so simple yet delicious.

I was dubious given the very thin batter and lack of flavors in this recipe, but I increased the cocoa by 1/4c, added 1/4tsp cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla and it made one great chocolate cake!  I frosted it with a simple chocolate buttercream frosting and it probably won't last long around here.  I think this will be my goto chocolate cake recipe from now on!

My son requested a "scratch" cake. I have used box mixes for last 35 years. I found this and gave it a whirl.  It is wonderful. I  used buttermilk mix instead and water in place of buttermilk.  I even followed directions for boiling water. (I almost didn't) That must be necessary to help blend the butter.  I made in a 9 x 13 pan (greased with crisco and generously "floured with cocoa."   I baked it for 35 minutes at 350. It came out of pan easily. Then I thirded it and made a two layer cake out of 2 pieces and made a single layer for sampling with the third piece.  Because of this cake, I hereby pledge to swear off cake mixes.  I am contemplating making a yellow cake, omitting the 1/2 c cocoa and adding 1/2 c flour.  Will let you know if this works at a later time.

This cakes makes a wonderful, dense chocolate cake.  I substituted 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of cocoa and added a dash of vanilla after combining the eggs.  Next time I will definitely use coffee instead of the water, but even with the water it was still a fabulous cake.  Topped it with a peppermint icing (requested by my six year-old son) and it made an AWESOME birthday cake.

This cake turned out delicious, with a tender, dense, moist crumb.  With chocolate ganache icing from this site, it was fantastic with vanilla ice cream.  Baked as directed in a 13 x 9 pan, it took extra time for the middle to be done, approx. 15-20 extra minutes.  There was a big crack on top, which the ganache covered up, no problem.  I thought it might be dry around the edges but it wasn't.  Everyone loved it!  So much better tasting than a mix...

WOW FANTASTIC CAKE!!! Very moist, very flavorful (make sure you use quality baking cocoa or it will be bland--and be sure to use buttermilk!!!) I used coffee instead of water. A basic cake one could do so much with ! I did a trial run of this cake to prepare for my son's birthday...I will FOR SURE be using it!

Well, for a no fail cake, it failed for me!!!!  It took ages to cook - I left it in the oven for an hour - and then the middle still wasn't cooked through properly.  I have no idea what I did wrong.....  it would have tasted great had it cooked properly

very nice, made it in a swiss roll tin (too fiddly doing 2 tins) did as recommended and left until the next day.  My only gripe is that it didn't rise much at all!  More of a brownie consistancy.  If i wanted brownies, I'd make brownies. If you want a heavy chocolate cake this si the one for you.  Don't be put off by the thick almost lumpy consistancy of the mix, it is correct.

Good and easy. Nice flavour without being overly rich! I had to keep this in the fridge due to the frosting and the consistency of the cake wasn't great this way.

This recipe is awesome!  Very easy for an neophyte baker like myself, also absolutely delicious and long lasting.  I've never tasted a better chocolate cake and it's only the second one I ever baked myself.  I added a frosting but it's not neccesary.

This was a good tasting cake, that baked very high.  It is more dense so you got more of a flat top which we wanted for decorating reasons.  Only note I have is that it took about an extra 15 minutes of baking time.

I've never made a cake from scratch (except for carrot cake) but all I had in the pantry was white cake mix and my son wanted chocolate for his birthday cake, so I had to turn to allrecipes.com for help.  THIS CAKE IS AMAZING.  I changed nothing except making buttermilk with milk and vinegar, followed the directions to a tee, and it turned out great.  It is super moist, even after leaving it to cool out of the pan overnight.  And I've never had a cake come out of the pan so easily.  Betty Crocker may still have my business for white cakes, but never again for chocolate!

Taste was mediocre but the consistency was terrible. It broke up into crumbs when I frosted it and was nothing but a nightmare. The only frosting I would recommend for this cake is whipped cream frosting - anything else and you'll have a messy pile of junk.

I'm giving it five stars even though I'll never get to have any of the one I made today.  However, if it's half as good as it looks, it will taste terrific. A friend came over and we made this cake for her boyfriends birthday party and they will be impressed...guaranteed.  I used a cooked chocolate icing that my mom used to make years ago and then we dipped strawberries in white almond bark and drizzled dark chocolate over them. The went around the edge and wow it looks great!

I gave it three stars because I didn't like it, but other folks who ate it thought it was the best ever! It was way too "densely moist" for my taste, if that makes sense. I like my cake to be a little fluffier.

Great recipe. I perhaps made a few too many changes for the first time out, and it still came out amazing well. I used ghiradelli baking chocolate which already has the sugar mixed with the cocoa and this somehow seemed less chocolately. I also substituted vanilla yogurt for half the butter and replaced one teaspoon of baking soda with baking powder because I wanted a less dense cake. I also live at high altitude in Colorado, so I had to add 2 extra TBSP of flour and reduce the liquid by a 1/4 cup. After all those changes, I have to say it STILL came out great. That's a pretty failsafe recipe, if you ask me! I slathered it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was rich and decadent.

The cake was very moist and chocolatey, but has a deffinate baking soda flavor.  Tasted too much like the boiling water no stir chocolate lava cake recipe.

I had to take a minute to put a review in here because this was such an exceptionally nice cake.  I made it in a 9x13 and followed instructions exactly.  It rose high in the pan and had such a lovely texture and taste.  I don't think you can ask for anything more in a chocolate cake.  I frosted it with a "5 min fudge" frosting that you boil.  Everyone loved it.

I had the cake in the oven for 10 minutes before realizing I had forgotten the boiling water.  Luckily, it's still okay without!  ...Just in case anyone else does the same ;)

Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly, other than making my own buttermilk with milk and lemon juice.  Tip: If you're decorating the cake beyond a simple layer of icing, I would definitely recommend glazing it first as it falls apart fairly easily.

Wasn't impressed with this cake. I followed instructions to a T and it turned out way to dense and lacked a chocolate taste. It didn't really rise either. I won't make again :(

This cake was exactly what I was looking for - light and fluffy chocolate (trhe chocolate cake I usually make is very dense and very chocolately) . I made this recipe for a co-worker's last day and everyone LOVED it.  It was chocolate but not too sweet - and perfect when I topped it with a very sweet caramel buttercream that I found on a different site.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any substitutions so this cake gets 5 stars and a permanent place in my recipe box.

Superb!  It was so moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  It was wonderful with the vanilla chocolate powdered sugar frosting recipe from this site.

I don't often write reviews because I often change things in the recipe and don't like to rate my changes. I made this cake as the recipe stated for a friend's birthday, and it was fantastic! Moist, almost fudgey, but not dense -- I baked in 2 8 inch round pans for 34mins. I frosted it with the "Creamy chocolate frosting" recipe from this site. YUM.

This was a moist, solid cake that the company all complimented.  Maybe another reviewer has noted that the ingredients call for water but in the steps it refers to BOILING water.  Note: I would NOT use boiling water or it would cook the eggs.  (I used cold water.)  This will be a cake I make again next time I want a no-fail, good-tasting, quick chocolate cake. [The power went out for 60 minutes - just AFTER I'd mixed the buttermilk into the batter!  After waiting the hour, cake still baked fine!]

This cake is very moist and chocolatey. For the hot water I used fresh brewed coffee. This was a very good cake that my whole family enjoyed.

VERY good. Very moist. I made this in a 9x13 glass pan and cooked for about 45 or 50 min. I, like others, used coffee instead of water. You don't taste the coffee once its baked but you will taste it in the batter. I used "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting" to frost this beauty. It covered the entire top of the 9x13.

WOW! This is excellent. I am not even a chocolate cake lover and I love this cake. Who needs frosting when this cake is so moist. It did need about 50 min to cook completely through.

Made as directed.  I thought this was moist but wasn't as chocolatey as I hoped it would be.  I used Hershey's cocoa - which I thought was good quality (not an off brand), so maybe more cocoa or adding chocolate chips would help? Liked baking a cake from scratch though and using up some buttermilk.

OMG!!! So moist and very good chocolate flavor. I have been searching for good homemade chocolate cake recipe for a very long time. I was nervous about making it because it is so easy to burn chocolate cake. I used three 9 inch round pans and baked for 25 mins exactly. I checked it at 20 just to be sure and it was still a little gooey, baked it for 5 more mins and it was perfect!!! This will be my new chocolate cake recipe from now on!!!! I frosted it using a very old recipe for "Fluffy butter frosting" and it complemented it so well. The icing was the perfect sweetness--sweet but not to sweet--for this cake. This was excellent!!! It is my 5 yr old's birthday cake and he loves it!!! Thanks mom 71

My daughter makes this cake frequently. It is the best chocolate cake we have ever tried; moist, good crumb, not to sweet. These also make wonderful addictive cupcakes. For the person who had trouble icing it, try freezing it first. That is what cake decorators do.

What an awesome moist chocolate cake this recipe makes. I followed the recipe to a T except for using a bundt pan. It's great with frosting or without.  We all loved it...I'm making it again tomorrow by request.  Thanks for the recipe!!

One of my first attempts at baking a cake, and it came out great. Kudos to the person who suggested using a cup of coffee instead of water.

I've made this recipe many times this past year and it's always great, even better the day after you bake it.  I frosted it with Bailey's Whipped cream (2 C real whipping cream, 2 T sugar, whipped to med-stiff peaks, then whip in 1/3 C Bailey's)topped w/crushed toffee bar bits. It got RAVE reviews at my friends birthday party.

Normally I like my chocolate cake a little richer and darker, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out.  And it actually tastes better the next day!  The recipe was so easy to follow that I let my 3 1/2 yr old daughter help me.  The only changes I made were using soured milk (milk + one tblsp vinegar) instead of buttermilk, and I also used hot coffee (heated to almost boiling) instead of water.  The whole family loved it, and from now on we'll use this for our basic chocolate cake instead of Betty Crocker!

Excellent.  I used this recipe to make cupcakes and changed the baking time to 20 minutes.  I replaced half of the butter with unsweetened applesauce to reduce the fat content (which was not terribly high to begin with).  The resulting cupcakes were moist, light and flavorful and lower in calories and fat than most chocolate cake recipes.

This cake was amazing! it was the first chocolate cake i have made from scratch that turned out moist and dense. It did take longer than stated in the recipe to bake but other than that it was really easy to make. I also used 1 tbsp of vinegar+ 1 cup-1tbsp of milk as a substitute for the buttermilk. I will definitely make this cake again!!!

I give it 4 thumbs up! It was the best chocolate cake recipe that I have ever used. I also, did not have buttermilk, so I used regular milk and added some lemon juice to it. The cake was very fluffy, silky, and moist. I had no problems with the recipe and I would recommend everyone to use it.

This cake wasn't that great.  Despite other people's reviews that this tasted better than an out of the box cake, it somehow managed to taste like it was out of the box.  It was just too dry and didn't taste very chocolately. I used it to make a layer cake which turned out okay thanks to the ganache and the simple syrup I used.  I don't plan on using this recipe again.

Simply the best cake I have ever had. I made cupcakes and cut the time by almost half. I added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla but those are the only changes i made. It was easy to make. It is rich and chocolatey without being super sweet.  Seriously the best cake EVER.

This is a very good chocolate cake.  I had to cook it for at least 45 minutes.  Don't worry if it seems too thin after mixing in the water.  It turned out wonderful!!!

I don’t know why but the cupcakes sank. Maybe I over mixed it? Followed the directions completely, baked till toothpick clean, 25 min. They taste good, a little fragile tho.

I made this cake according to directions and frosted it with a recipe from this site.  It was extremely bland in two ways: not very chocolate-y and not sweet at all.   I loved the denseness of it, because that is my preference.  I baked it the 40 minutes and should have taken it out at least 7 minutes earlier because I could see the cake pulling away from the sides of the pan.  But it was a little jiggle-y on the inside and the cake tester had batter on it. So I went against my gut and baked it the full time and it was dry, albeit moist enough to stick together and not crumble. I would like to try it again and replace some of the flour with more cocoa powder and add another 1/2 cup at least of sugar.  Then bake it just 30-33 minutes.  I am giving it 2 stars because it was easy and was a nice density and has potential.

This cake was delicious. This is my new go-to recipe for chocolate cake. Next time I might try using Hersey's Special Dark cocoa. I bet that would be amazing! I made this for my teenage daughter's birthday party with her friends. She wanted it with white frosting, so I made 7-minute frosting. The kids couldn't stop raving about the cake!

The only change I made was to replace the water with coffee and replace half the sugar with sweetener. I don't know whether the coffee made the colour deeper but it sure was an excellent chocolate cake: fluffy, moist, chocolatey, lovely crumb and absolutely decadent with a simple icing sugar, butter, milk and cocoa powder icing.  I wouldn't recommend using a 9x13 pan, like I did.  After I turned it out to cool, it completely split apart.  I managed to get it back in the pan to cool, and iced it there as well.  Next time I'll use 2 - 9x9" pans - it rises very well.  An extra dimension is to spread strawberry jam in the middle.  This is a really, really good cake.  We're going to serve it to some 50+ people at our Sr Ctr tomorrow in honour of National Chocolate Cake Day.

I used this recipe for cake pops and would again.  The cake baked through perfectly in a 9×13 pyrex and crumbled beautifully in the food processor.  The cake pops tasted wonderful.

The only change I made was to use cake flour. I wanted a "mild" chocolate cake for a child's birthday cake. I chose this recipe because the picture showed a cake that was only a medium shade of brown. The recipe came out very nicely. I love chocolate but sometimes you just want a moist flavorful cake that doesn't smack you in the face. This is a great tasting cake. I will make this again.

The cake was very good and moist. I made some adjustments for altitude, but I also added vanilla. Something about adding a teaspoon or 2 to a recipe makes it more flavorful. For those that thought the recipe was bland, this is one way to fix it.

I needed a chocolate cake batter to make a vanilla/chocolate marble cake.  I was a little worried that the "runny batter" would just melt in with the other vanilla batter, but I just dropped glops of each batter into the pan, and made a couple thru passes in the batter with a knife.  The cake was delicious and really moist.  The chocolate cake part was very rich and a little on the dense side--almost like a pound cake.  Thank you Jan.

I made the recipe as is. I made a pan of cupcakes (12) and a 10 inch round cake. The cupcakes burned a tad but the cake turned out perfect. Both were moist and delicious even with the bottom of them a little burned tasting. I used a triple chocolate fudge frosting that had tiny chips in from the store. It went great together. My husband died and went to heaven. He ate about half of the cake that night. He said it almost tasted like the thick, dense Italian style cakes from specialty bakeries. We will make this again for sure. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it was almost too much for me. One tiny piece for me was way more than enough and usually I can down chocolate like its nothing :)

Get out of town! This recipe is amazing and super easy to make. I searched for a while and came accross several delicious looking (5 star recipe)cakes that required "box of chocolate cake mix".........ummmmm the whole purpose of searching for a recip on here is to NOT buy a cake mix. So I came accross this fabulous recipe, and I am very pleased. I did add a heaping spoonful of Nestle Dark Roast instant coffee to the boiled water, and did not have buttermilk on hand so I looked up a quick recipe, just add 4 1/2 teaspoons of white vinegar to the cup of milk and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Mix it up and bake for recommended time. It was moist, chocolatey, and delicious! My three boys loved it and also my husband.

Turned out great.   Used vanilla coffee creamer vs buttermilk.  Didn't have any on hand.   1st time my son made a homemade cake at home.  Easy to make.

Very easy prep and delicious results! I made cupcakes with this recipe. I got a perfect two dozen and a few more just for me. If you are making cupcakes, fill cup 3/4 full and bake for 20-22 minutes. Like another user, I substituted 1 cup of freshly brewed coffee for the water. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

This cake is easy to make and the ingredients are always on hand. I do not use or like buttermilk so never buy it but 1 tablespoon vinegar in one cup milk and that has always worked for me as buttermilk. I had coffee on hand so I used that instead of the water. This cake is incredibly moist and delicious. Thanks Jan

This cake is melt in your mouth great!  I have made this twice and both times the flavor has been excellent.  I have had trouble with it sticking to the pan both times even though I sprayed well and my cakes usually don't stick to those pans.

Wow!  This is so delicious, soft and chocolately.  I just did a trial run of cupcakes, I plan on making the cake for my son's birthday party this weekend.  I've never had a cake from scratch turn out so delicious.

It's a moist & spongy cake, however the choco taste is not very strong.  I will try to add choco chips or choco icing next time.  And I think 1C water is too much, I just use 1/2C and the texture come out perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Should be called "school cafeteria chocolate cake."  I made it exactly like recipe said and even my 10 yr old son said it tasted like the one at school.  I bake often and this is the worst cake I have ever baked.

This is the best ever chocolate cake I have ever made from scratch. It did take a little longer to cook than directed, I kept a close eye on it.
I added a whoopie pie filling onto the top and poured a chocolate ganache glaze onto that. YUP! This is a keeper! Bye, bye, Betty!

I made this cake up sizing the servings size to 72 I made 3- 8' layers. In between the layers I frosted then put a layer of cherry pie filing,alternating frosting,cherry pie filling.this cake was very tasty. I would make this again. note when you up size to 72 as i did,it would have made 3-9" cakes.

SO moist. Made this for my co-worker's birthday and it's probably the best cake I've ever made (I love it and I'm not much of a cake person). UPDATE: I made this lactose-free with Smart Balance Light margarine and buttermilk made from 1 tbs vinegar and 1 c Lactaid milk. Still delicious. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it's great.

I made this exact cake for a friends birthday and lets just say that there were only five people at the party and at the end of the party there was only 2 slices left of an 8 inch round double layer cake. I made this cake exactly like the picture. I also took it up a notch by adding couble fudge icing in the middle and on top of the cake. I am planning to make it again for a baby shower. I plan to incorporate some peanut butter icing instead of chocolate. If i could give this top rating out of a five. It would be a seven and 3/4. just three words OFF THE CHARTS!

This wasn't as chocolatey as I like. I may add a bit more cocoa next time. A good recipe though. Very easy. You definetly need to spray your pans/muffin cups. I forgot and had some sticking issues. My fault though. :)

GREAT! This cake is an actual no fail cake! I substituted the butter milk with some 2% milk and a tsp of vinegar. This cake is not too rich or too thick, it is perfectly moist, and has the right amount of sweetness. I'm saving this recipe for sure.

this cake was okay. needed to be sweeter, so i ended up putting a liquid chocolate glaze. i never frost my cakes, but i had to put something on this one. it was however very moist and i really liked that. i was a little worried once i had finished mixing the cake because it had a thin liquid, almost like chocolate milk. it baked great in the bundt cake pan and it only took 1 hour. i would only make this cake again if i didn't have a boxed cake on hand.

This cake was very good, flavorful, but very difficult to frost.  I waited until it cooled completely but the edges still crumbled in my attempt to frost.  Wouldn't try that again with this recipe.

The BEST chocolate cake I make is with this recipe.   I do change it up a bit only to make it healthier -- I use only 1 c. sugar, and sub half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour -- it's delicious.  I don't use frosting and everyone always loves it.  Definitely use good quality cocoa -- it will always come out dark and chocolaty if you do.

This is delicious, I made it for my husband's birthday and will be using it to make it for my daughter's birthday and for Valentine's Day (February is a busy cake month). It is very dense and fudgy, I can't stop eating it. Thanks for sharing!

I read the reviews and was pretty skeptical, but decided to try it anyway.  It was so moist and fluffy!! The taste was amazing as well! The only thing I did different was use milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any. I also was glad that I had good cocoa powder in the house to use and the chocolate taste was amazing! I would suggest this recipe to anyone looking for a good chocolate cake.

This cake was so easy and delicious.  I don't usually love the cakes I make, but even I loved this cake, as did everyone else at the party.  I topped it with a buttercream frosting and it was sooooo good.

I made this cake about 2 years ago and it was delicious. I made it shortly again afterwards and it was horrible. Recently, I found the recipe again, and decided to make it. 

This cake is fantastic! If you follow the directions and let it cook completely and cool completely, you will end up with a beautiful chocolate cake that tastes great. I made this cake in a bundt pan and it took about an hour to cook. I let it cool overnight in the pan and took it out in the morning. I made the "Chocolate Ganache" icing by INGRIDEVOGEL on this site, but without the rum. I let it cool and whipped it so it just barely drizzled over the cake. I used dark chocolate chips for the ganache as well.

Ended up with a beautiful chocolate cake that even I could eat, and I really don't like chocolate that much!!

This recipe was great. I followed the directions and succesfully made four 9x13 inch delicious chocolate cakes, topping each of them with homemade icing. I was a bit worried about 2 of the cakes because I added the boiling water about 15 minutes before I cooked them, but they turned out fine. It was easy and fun! Thank you for this yummy recipe!!

I didn't believe all of the bad reviews that this recipe got since so many people had raved about it. I made it for a birthday cake and it turned out so hard. We barely had a bite and threw it away.

Really great cake! I used it in "Death By Chocolate" on this website, instead of using a cake mix. Sure glad I made the Real Thing. This is wicked good!

This was ok. The cake was moist but just not chocolately enough for me. Also, for some reason, it baked unevenly which was strange since the batter was so thin.

I live at 5K feet, so I looked up how to make cakes for high altitude, and I followed the instructions, well it didn't turn out nice at all, also I think I over cooked it.  It was dry and really hard to swallow!  But I think I will give this a try again in the future, and just stick to the recipe!!

A very nice, heavy chocolate cake. We really enjoyed it.
