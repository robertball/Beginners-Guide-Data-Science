A very nice baked pasta casserole. I made it just as submitted. I was surprised at how much sour cream/cream cheese/ricotta there was for the amount of pasta. I thought it might be too rich but it wasn't. I will make this again.

I have been trying several similar recipes but wasn't quite happy with any of them. This recipe is the best so far and tasted exactly like what I have been wanting. It's also easier than the others - bonus! I used a 42 ounce jar of pasta sauce and thought the sauce ratio was perfect. I used a variety of different pastas I had left in my cupboard and I followed the suggestion that Italian cheese blend could be substituted for the cheddar and thought this was amazing.  I will definitely make this dish again!

My whole family loved this. The addition of the sour cream and cream cheese along with the ricotta really made a nice difference from other similar dishes I've made. The only change I'll make for next time is to increase the sauce a bit.

I substituted the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese and used ground turkey and Italian turkey sausage. My family LOVED it!! They asked me to make it again the following week.

This should have more reviews. I was looking for a recipe similar in flavor to lasagna, but without lasagna noodles, and this definitely met my requirements. I used rice fusilli noodles (for gluten-free eaters), a slightly different ratio of ingredients (based on what I had and other users' suggestions about adding more tomato sauce), and the addition of some chopped black olives. Will certainly be making again.

This was fast and easy. My picky teen even had seconds. I paired it with Res Lobster biscuits and what a hit! I made some adjustments to the recipe. I ALWAYS brown my ground beef with chopped onions but also add a tsp of fresh ginger and garlic (each) pastes. The ginger and garlic help keep the gamey taste out of meat (a Pakistani recipe secret!). I always use Newman's marinara sauce but I also added a little water to thin it and a tsp salt and half tsp black pepper. Salt and pepper are to taste. In a bowl I combined the mastaccioli pasta (3/4 box), shredded mozzarella, 1 jar pasta sauce, 1 pound lean ground beef and stirred them all together before putting half of the mixture into a backing dish (I froze the remaining). Cover and cook for about 15 mins. I had the oven on 475 for the biscuits so the pasta went in too. Enjoy!!

This is so good. If you want comfort food look no further. I basically made this according to directions but spiced it up a bit. I will make this monthly!  Thank you for sharing!

Iâ€™ve made this a few times, by the recipe and have added my own preferred ingredients. Both are really good, fast and easy to make!

I love the allrecipes ingredient search function. I had items in the fridge that were left after Christmas and I wanted to use them. Sour cream, cream cheese, and ricotta cheese generated this lovely recipe. I made it just as submitted. We all loved it!

This was easy and pretty good.  Next time I will use half the meat and won't use cheddar cheese.  Mozzarella would work better in my opinion.

The entire finicky family LOVED this. I mean, cleaned their plates. Kids took it to school for lunch today. I changed a few things just because that worked for us. I omitted the meat the cumin, and the Italian seasoning; used 16 ounces of mostaccioli instead of 12; used ricotta instead of cottage cheese; and used mozzarella instead of cheddar. And despite all those changes, it was fabulous - really the kind of recipe that can be tweaked here and there to suit your tastes and needs, just like any good casserole, and still be outstanding. Thanks for the recipe!

First time making anything like this, and it turned out delicious! I had enough pasta left over to make two of these.

This will be made on a regular rotation in my house. Everyone loved it and all gave it two thumbs up. I increased the pasta sauce to 42 oz. and used Italian cheese blend in place of the cheddar as suggested under the chef's notes and by other raters.

Very good - like a deconstructed lasagna.  I used penne pasta, sausage and spinach.  Only used 4 ounces of cream cheese and I omitted Cumin.  Also put fresh mozzarella and provolone on top.   Easy to take to a party.

My husband and the kids had seconds!  I followed the directions except for the meat.  I used ground mild Italian sausage in place of the beef--because I needed to use it up.  I was worried the sour cream, cream cheese and ricotta would be too rich, but it was so good.  I used cheddar, but also added some shredded Italian blend cheese to it.  I'd like to try this again with beef in place of Italian sausage to see which version my family likes best.

YUM!! I used Italian sausage sliced and browned; my own marinara sauce; added chopped spinach (wilted and drained) to cheese mixture and subsituted Italian cheese for topping! Delicious! 4 stars only because I changed it slightly

Was ok. Not spectacular.  Like lasagna a little.  Next time I will use mozzarella. Didn't care for the cheddar.
