Replaced garlic salt w/garlic powder. The lid melting the cheese also softened the crisp crumbled bacon. Next time I will add the crisp bacon after the cheese has been melted and the lid has been removed.

I normally scale this to serve 6 and add some milk (1/4 cup) to the battered egg mix to make it fluffier.  As others have stated, I have also used sausage, chopped green bell peppers or a jar of drained diced pimentos.  If I'm REALLY lazy but my family is begging for some breakfast, I'll used a package of frozen hashbrowns instead and add the eggs once the hasbrowns are done and when the eggs are almost done, I'll add the bacon or sausage, and other veggies then.  If you flip carefully (for even cooking), you can practically cut out pizza-like slices right from your pan to serve. A different spin to an omlette! Thanks LaDonna!

Yum, yum, yummy!  This is an easy one pot meal that is really delicious.  I added onion and green chilies--mmmmmm!  My whole family loved this, even my picky son who only eats cereal and pancakes!!  Leftovers reheated were also good--will definitly be making this more often!

This was a great basic recipe. Like others, I added a few touches of my own with onions and playing around with the seasonings a bit. For those previous reviews that commented negatively about how lame this site is and how the recipes suck...don't use the site! If you don't like what it offers, go elsewhere rather than bagging on people's recipes- cooking requires tweaking to coincide with your own personal preference for taste. Thank you for the idea, LaDonna!

This was really good and so simple to do. I was looking for a frittata recipe when I found this. Great flavor and was an easy meal in one. I liked that it only dirtied 1 skillet. I put the diced potatoes in the microwave for a couple of minutes to partially cook them while the bacon was cooking to reduce cook time on the stovetop. My guys both said although they liked this, they preferred all their stuff separate (hash browns, scrambled eggs with cheese, and bacon). I loved this just as it is though and would have given this 5 stars b/c I'm a southern gal and this is down home southern cookin' for sure! I only had to make one change and that was to add a smidge of minced garlic and a pinch of kosher salt instead of the garlic salt. I only used enough bacon grease to coat the potatoes heavily and not all that was reserved. I did add 1 more potato, 2 slices bacon, and 2 more eggs to feed 3 of us. It made enough for 4. Thanks LaDonna for a great meal.

Pretty delicious.

I gave this 4 stars because I had to add quite a few more spices for flavor. I doubled the recipe and found that the 1/4 tsp of salt & pepper did hardly anything for the skillet.

I also omitted the bacon (didn't have any on hand and I'm a vegetarian). I used rosemary olive oil to fry up the potatoes instead of the bacon grease. It made my house smell great! I served it with english muffins. 

It was an overall very yummy and satisfying dish. Will make again!

Added some green pepper, sweet onion, (extra bacon) and wow. This is good good stuff. We used Yukon Gold potatoes to give it a buttery delicious flavor.

Grew up on this breakfast!!  These days I add chopped onion (1/2) and occassionally some chopped green and red pepper.  Browned sausage is a good addition too.  the combos are endless.

I used vegetarian bacon and had to add extra spices to make up for the lack of flavor. Also added mushrooms and onions, which I cooked separately and added at the end.  Great food to feed a hungover husband on a Sunday morning! :)

This was very good. I used hash browned potatoes (already on hand). Other than that the only thing I did differently was to add mozzarella cheese and serve this with some sausage gravy.  Delicious and hearty.  Thanks for the post.

I've made this recipe probably 30 times now so I thought it was about time to review it... :-) Excellent recipe as is! I've also used kielbasa or pork sausage when I didn't have bacon on hand.  My extremely lazy version of this is heating up precooked sausage with frozen potatoes and montreal steak seasoning for about 10 minutes, then adding eggs and cheese.  I plan to make this at least 30 more times so thank you so much for this recipe!

My family has a tradition of making this most every morning after Sunday mass with whatever is in the kitchen. We start by browning bacon or pork sausage in a large cast iron skillet (also great with ham), then remove the meat and throw in an onion, red and green bell peppers (jalapeno if it's on hand, sometimes mushrooms) and potatoes. Usually seasoned with garlic and salt and pepper, sometimes some italian seasonings. Once that's all cooked up, add the eggs. When the eggs are nearly cooked, we throw in some cubed cheese (pepper jack is my favorite) and let it melt. Best served immediately with a side of toast and OJ!

As kids we would camp all the time and my Dad made this over the campfire.  Soooo good especially on those cool mornings.  Onion makes it even better.  Thanks for the memories!

Potatoes, cheese, bacon....can it get any better?? I use sharp or  extra sharp cheddar for even more yummy flavor.  Yes, I agree with prior review...add cooked bacon after melting cheese if you want your bacon crisp.

I always throw a few poatoes in the oven & bake them & keep them in the fridge.  Then I have fried potatoes in minutes.  Been making this recipe for years.  Also check the fridge for veggies that are ready for veggie heaven.  Chop them up & throw them in.  Sometimes I like to add a little hot sauce to the eggs.  Not tabasco.  This is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  For dinner I usually make it with smoked sausage.

Good and quick breakfast.  It's got everything in one pan so it eliminates multiple pans and it's quite tasty.  We added some jalapeno to ours while the potatoes were cooking for some added kick.

We have been doing this for years and we still love it. For some interesting variations: Bratwurst patties chopped fine and fried adds a interesting taste. We also dice bell peppers (all colors) fry these right after the bratwurst patties or bacon. I never cook with salt, pepper and all other spices yes, if someone wants salt they can add it before they eat. My wife adds a pinch of chicken bullion while cooking the potatoes.

I upped this to serve 6 and threw in an extra potato to stretch it. This is good but needs more seasoning. After I tried it I added more garlic salt, more pepper and I put hot sauce on mine.

I used 4 potatoes and sliced them very thin (more like shavings).  I also used 8 eggs to make it more "eggy."  The spices called for were perfect, and added a wonderful flavor to the dish.  I even sprinkled a bit more of all three spices over the whole dish once it was cooked.  Delicious!  Will make again for sure!!

Very good, I added onion and green pepper but tho onion burned on the bottom so next time I will skip the onion (add onion powder) I would have liked more egg and less potato but that is just my personal preference. Super good and easy. Thank You for the recipe.

This is a very versatile recipe.  It's good with bacon, but browned sausage or ham can also be used.  I have also used frozen Potatoes O'Brien, which have peppers and onions in them.  Delish.

Fantastic recipe!  My husband and I loved it and I will definitely be adding this one to my list of favorite breakfasts.  It's the ultimate comfort food!  The only thing I did differently was I scrambled the eggs separately and mixed them in at the end...so very good!

Very very good! My family and I loved it. Like most others, I added onions and bell peppers too. The only recommendation is to make sure to use a non-stick pan because I decided to use my new stainless steel pan and everything stuck. I will definitely be making this again just in a better pan ;)

Tried original, it was good, but my family likes spice.  I added more bacon, 2 more potatoes, 2 sliced green onions, 1/4 diced red onions, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/2 yellow bell pepper sliced thinly. cooked with the potatoes. Used Kraft  Extra Sharp Cracker Barrel cheese  topped with Mexican Ville hot salsa, parsley and chives. Served mounded on Buttered(Smart Balance) fried bread.
Serves five adults.

Wonderful oh yes and the cheese we used was a smoked swiss chedder mix!!! Hoffmans, makes a great flavor...

We had a "breakfast for dinner" night and this was on the menu.  I didn't have any potatoes, but I did have frozen potatoes o'brian, which I thawed first.  The peppers and onions added more flavor to this dish.  I used center cut bacon and 2% shredded cheese to lighten this up just a bit.  Very tasty.

My family has made this for as long as I can remember. We have added onions, green peppers, ham, sausage, basically whatever was in the fridge makes it's way into the skillet. Easy to make delicious comfort food.

I too use garlic powder instead of salts and also add onion.  I use a thawed a pkg. of hash brown potatoes...so much faster and easier.  Fry up a whole pound of bacon.  Save half and use half for other recipes that call for bacon.

This was really yummy, and so simple too. I like eggs but don't love them, and this recipe appealed to me because it had more potato flavor. I used a big skillet as was called for in the recipe, but you really only need a medium sized one. I wish I had had some fresh tomatoes or salsa on hand...either one would have been good to top it off with. And you could easily add more ingredients into the dish to your liking and just add an additional egg to keep it bound together.  I will definitely be making this again.

This meal is wonderful First, I par boiled the potatoes, as I find they cook quicker that way. I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt. When the pototoes were almost done, I added onion. The remainder of the recipe I made as written. We had this for supper tonight with fruit, toast and coffee. it's a keeper thats for sure. My husband can't wait for me to make it again.

I had peeled and diced potatoes in the fridge for another recipe so I Googled the equivalent of two potatoes which resulted in 1 ½ cups of diced potatoes. I used garlic powder vs. garlic salt and added 1/8 tsp. onion powder. Next time, I would use diced onions in the recipe. So easy yet delicious!

Great basic recipe with endless possibilities as outlined in the many responses.  I use less bacon and sautee pre-cooked potatoes until golden. To pre-cook the potatoes, I dice into 1/2" pieces; place on a plate; cover with waxed paper and microwave for about 4-5 minutes until just tender while the bacon is cooking. Once golden, I remove the potatoes from the pan and sautee some chopped onion and thinly sliced zucchini; cooking until softened.  Add back the potatoes and bacon; add some halved cherry tomatoes, fresh basil then the eggs & cheese.  A substantial breakfast - great for brunch.

Very tasty....I cooked the potatoes in the bacon grease. I didn't have any onions so I used onion powder instead. These turned out great!

I use cooked potatoes with the skin on and use extra cheese.   If I have bell peppers or onions or mushrooms I throw those in as well.  This is a great hearty breakfast.  Great when we go camping as well.

The potatoes take a while to cook, however this is a really great brunch dish to serve. You can add as little or as much bacon, eggs, or potatoes to this dish and it is always a great filling meal! Thanks!

This dish rocks!  I peeled two potatoes and diced them, as directed.   I also put foil over the skillet to melt the cheese and it did not take long to melt.  I also used thick cut bacon.  Yum o licious!

I make a skillet for my boys just like this once or twice a month and it always gets inhaled. It can vary depending on what you have on hand. I will saute onion and garlic and use half bacon fat/half butter. Using sea salt and eliminating the seasoning salt and garlic salt will warrant a tastier result. Always a boy pleaser and doubles REAL well. This is also great to cure hangovers.

Great like this but I added some onions, a few extra eggs and put it on a tortilla drizzled with a little home made Green Chilli.  Makes great breakfast burritos!  I wrapped them all up in some foil and put them in the freezer and now I have a quick. easy and delicious breakfast in the morning.  Sure beats gas station burritos!!!

This is a great recipe, however I eliminated the grease and replaced with a couple tbsp of salt-free butter to fry the potatoes to make it a lower fat and cholestorol recipe.  I also added just a little chopped onion and tomato if you like veggies.  For a spice add some fresh jalepeno

Good recipe...I doubled the bacon, added a touch of milk to the eggs and put the crumbled bacon on top of the cheese after it melted....yummy If I had small children or teenagers at home I would call it "Breakfast Pizza"

As a "poor college student" I practically lived off of this dish for a couple semesters. To make it lower in fat, omit bacon and use either a tiny bit of butter or a non-stick skillet. You can also add some broccoli to get some fiber in there and add a little color-not to mention vitamins! (Nutrition Major-can you tell?)

I've been making a version of this for years.  It's one of our camping trip favorites.  I make extra boiled potatoes for supper and cube them up, fry them and add whatever meats and spices we want.  Great with a spicy chili sauce on the side.  A one dish wonder.  Can me made for one or the whole family.  Quick and delicious.

I haven't actually tried this exact recipe yet and will have to increase amounts to feed my family. But, I can tell you that while camping, a friends husband makes a version of this every year and it is delicious!!  My son has been asking for this and I am so glad I found this recipe here....thank you so much!!  I didn't know exactly how he made it and tried it once before but it didn't turn out like his...I think it must have been cooking the potatoes in the bacon grease!  Thanks again for the recipe!! I'll be making this for breakfast in the morning before school!!

I rate this a four only because we felt it needed a bit more flavor. With the addition of red onion and green pepper then topped off with a bit of salsa this was a hit in out household! Will make it again and again!

I thought this was good, it was just a little on the dry side. I make something similar, but usually top it off with a homemade sawmill gravy. That would have worked perfect here. To make this quickly, I used a bag of par-cooked diced potatoes and onions. I thought the seasonings went well with those potatoes. I also used pre-cooked bacon, to save time. Just watch it because it cooks quickly. I only had to add a little olive oil, to the potatoes, as this type of bacon is mostly already cooked. I used the whole 2.5 oz box. I also added an extra egg, as I probably had more potatoes then if using 2 regular potatoes. This made for a filling breakfast all in one pot. ty

People seemed to enjoy it.  I didn't have any bacon available, so I used sausage.  This is a very versatile recipe, and I can see using this in the future.

This is similar to something a local restaurant serves.  Now I can stay home on Saturday mornings and enjoy!  Also, I've fixed this for my dinner a couple of times.  I've topped it with a little tomato salsa and it's quick, filling and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

I just made this and we really liked it...I boiled 4 potatoes with the skins on, then cut them into cubes...I fried 6 pieces of bacon and used 5 eggs...Used a lot more cheese...I added onion to the potatoes, canned, chopped Jalepenos to the eggs and added a can of mushrooms to the whole mix...I did crumble the bacon before adding the cheese and it turned out great...Served it with salsa...Have enuf left over for another meal...Hubby could have eaten more, but stopped at 1-1/2 servings...I can just tell by a recipe whether we would like it and how to tweek it to our liking..

Easy and good!  I used diced ham in place of bacon.  I think I will add some milk to the eggs next time, but this was really good!

I've made this before except using garlic salt and bacon... I add in cubed ham and chopped green peppers.  Sometimes I'll use fresh potatoes, cubed or use packaged refridgerated (not frozen) shredded hash browns.....Yum!

This is a great starter recipe, though I would encourage readers to add various ingredients as suits their taste.  The one thing I think makes an amazing addition is a tablespoon of cayenne pepper sauce (Dante's Inferno is what I used, but you could use Frank's or another brand), added about halfway through the cooking period.  I also added 1/4 cup of diced red onion, a few diced mushrooms, and a tbsp. of minced garlic towards the end of the cooking period, and just a few minutes before adding the egg and cheese.  As for the seasonings, just add what tastes right to you.  The bacon and cheese have ample salt already, so only a light sprinkle of seasoned salt should suffice.

I make this recipe (only more at a time) on a regular basis for my family. My favorite thing about this recipe is that you can either wrap it up in a tortilla as a breakfast burrito, or you can serve it as is alongside pancakes or biscuits and gravy or the like. I also occasionally substitute breakfast sausage for the bacon.

This was better than any potato casserole I have had at a restaurant.    The only thing I would change is to microwave the bacon so it is nice and crisp.  Cook the potatoes in vege. oil instead of bacon grease and add the bacon after the cheese has been melted so that it doesn't get soggy.

Delicious!  I doubled recipe..and probably did not need to quite double the eggs.  I ended up turning the skillet before I put cheese on it.  Still delightful. Probably would save time to parboil the potatoes.  Would be great with peppers, mushrooms, sausage, etc.

I wanted this to be meatless so I left the bacon out and added chopped onion, green pepper and mushrooms. My potatoes were very small so I used 3. In the pic this is topped with habanero hot sauce. Great hearty breakfast even without the meat!

It may have been my mistake to use thick sliced bacon, but my partner and both thought this was WAY too greasy.  Next time I'll drain off some of the bacon grease.

I have been eating variations of this meal for 20 years. Glad to see a basic recipe, which can be revised to anyones taste. I always add onions. This is a great way to use up leftover baked potates, vegetables, meats etc... Thanks

We've been making this in my family for over 50 years, didn't realize that not everyone knew about it. We call it 'camping eggs' and make a lot of variations w/different meats, cheeses, veggies, etc. Enjoy!

I make this with lots of variations:  onions, chili powder and 1/2 cup of picante sauce.  Sometimes I use diced ham or even 1/3-1/2 lb. hamburger meat and leave out the eggs.  It's a one pot easy filling meal.  It makes a good filling for burritos.

Pretty good for an easy throw together. Plus, as mentioned, good to use up veggies left in the fridge. I waited to crumble the bacon near the end to keep it crisp as someone else suggested, used 4 eggs & red onions. I also microwaved the potatoes so they didn't take forever browning. I made it more like a fritatta so we could cut it up. Make sure you season well if you add more egg of course (used just S,fresh cracked P and garlic powder).

Very good. I used chorizo instead of bacon cause that is what i had on hand. Definitely a keeper that the whole family enjoyed. 2009 UPDATE: I prefer it with bacon. I fry the potatoes on lower heat for a longer period because i like them crispy...my whole family still loves this. To make it easier, i buy the Oscar Meyer real bacon packets on the salad dressing isle and top it with those. I also spice it up with some cajun/blackened seasoning. A really good recipe!!

I first made this over 50 years ago.  The recipe at that time was called "Old Fashioned Farm Fry".   My family absolutely loved it.  The recipe was identical to this except that it also included chopped onion, which was sautéed in the bacon grease, and the crumbled bacon was added at the end to keep it crisp.  How nice to see this recipe again.  Really is comfort food.

Great flavor and versatile by adding other ingredients. I scrambled the eggs with the potatoes. To keep the bacon crispy I added it on the final dish.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added 1 1/2 onions to it, and next time I will probably add 2 onions.  I also used pre-cooked bacon pieces.  It was a hit at my house!

We've made this dozens of times - always for dinner!  This is one of  my teenage son's favorites.  I add onion and minced garlic, because we love both.  I've found that it's important to keep the proportions the same. Two potatoes doesn't seem like a lot, but the entire dish does make two LARGE servings.  Left overs are yummy too!

This is really good - but next time I would definitely use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. With it already having seasoned salt, it ends up too salty.

Delicious! To make it a little healthier I used Tempeh bacon and added spinach with the eggs; still delicious. I also added extra salt to the eggs because I loooove salt :) really easy to make and clean up after, highly recommend to breakfast lovers!

Oh my gosh, this was wonderful! My husband just told me that he was burned out on the same ole breakfast. So I saw this and decided to try it. I made mine with3 frozen sausage patties and let them cook in the skillet for awhile to get a little grease. We didn't have any bacon since I just used it all up 2 days prior and my husband prefers sausage. After "cooking" the sausage, I added water to it and then put my potatoes in it as I needed something more to be able to cook the potatoes, and wanted less grease. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of adding mushrooms and diced potatoes as I had some left from the recipe I cooked 2 days ago. I have cooked this for the third time and my husband always tells me the day ahead that he only has one meal left. He is such a happy camper in the morning :). Thanks so much for the recipe. This is a meal I have to make every week! Try this and you wont be disappointed. If you don't want the grease, drain the meat well, and then add water or milk to the skillet. It is just as wonderful without the drippings.

have been making this for yrs, a change in meat, sometimes bacon, turkey bacon, sausage, I love the Yukon potato, and I do microwave it a little to cut down on cooking time in the pan, it is so good any way you wish to choose the ingredients, I do not use all of the bacon grease, I put a little in and add extra virgin olive oil, I like what cheese I have on hand, I've used pepper jack, sharp cheddar, mozz, whatever I have on hand, thank-you for your version.

Wonderful classic to fill your tummy. Flexible, too: you can build on the basic recipe by adding or substituting veggies, spices, sauces, whatever you like.  For variety, I placed the eggs that I fried over-medium atop the potato mix, then covered with cheese.

I grew up on this recipe. If we had bacon yes we fried the potatoes in it. If we didn't we used marg or butter. Add whatever you like to the basic recipe of fried potatoes and eggs. Great for dinner too.

This was so good! I added green pepper and onion once the potatoes were almost done, I loved the tip below of adding the bacon once the cheese melted to keep it crispy.  I will definitely add this to My Recipes!

I woke up this morning and was starving and I came across this awesome recipe. I used center cut bacon and omitted garlic salt and added sea salt and a splash of milk to the eggs! OMG it was awesome, bacon was crumbly and very little grease since is center cut, I believe this will eliminate everyone's complaints that it was too greasy. Thank you for this winner??

My son has made this recipe for years!  Since he was in Boy Scouts.  They would make it on their camping trips.  Originally it was made with whatever they had leftover from their prior meals and then added eggs to make a breakfast. They called it "Train Wreck".  I love it just the way it is, no salt, however, because there's enough salty flavor from the bacon.  I, too, have added onions and bell pepper to it to give it more flavor.

It's very easy and with tweaking, I was able to make something I liked and will make over and over again. The original was a little under seasoned for me, but since I was making it for my mother who doesn't like seasoning, she thought it was perfect. I like that it is so easy to make that once I showed my kids how to make it, they can make it on their own. 

I wish I had read the reviews before I made it the first time so I would have known to add green chiles and other things I like because the original is a little bland. It is a good base and any vegetable can be added to it. My youngest son likes to put this in a tortilla. I cooked the bacon separate and let people add it to taste, in order to accommodate my vegetarian daughter. This isn't going to get raves at a camp out, but it's a good choice for a group because you can make the plain egg and potato base and then people add whatever they want. I have to say again. It's so incredibly easy. This will be one of my go-to's for when I have a hard time getting started in the morning.

This made a great Sunday brunch!  I love the idea of a one-pan meal and the only differences were adding half a chopped onion with the potatoes, that I had already boiled from another recipe to make home fries.  Even lower-sodium bacon didn't skimp on the flavor of this tasty dish.

I don't really like eggs. This recipe gives you some options though. The baked egg is good for throwing more stuff in. I added some garlic additional ham and a little feta cheese. Nice recipe thank you.

To speed things up, I usually par cook the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes, pouring off any accumulated liquid, and then proceed.  However I also add one clove of real garlic, minced fine.  Powders and seasoned salts scare me, I mean where do they come from?  LOL

This recipe has been in my family for years.  We always called it "Farmer's Breakfast".  To simply it, I use frozen hash browns, the chunky style.  My family gobbles this up and it is great left over and warmed in the microwave.  Nice to see simple things on this site!

This was pretty good. I replaced the regular bacon with pancetta and used frozen diced potatoes to speed up the time. I had to add more seasonings to suit our taste, but all in all It was delious, hubby enjoyed it as well! Thanks!

Very Good!  I do recommend a teflon skillet - i use stainless steel and it doesn't come out quite as pretty.  I added onions with the potatoes for personal flavor.  Excellent - will make again!!

My fiance and I really liked this.  I didn't realize it was a brunch recipe until I printed it out so I just made the bacon and potatoes (added a vidalia onion) and used it as a side with marinated pork chops.

this was really good! I used a creole seasoning spice instead of all the spices and it was delicious. Good recipe idea with a lot of room for interpretation.

This was a hit with my family. I decided to add an extra egg. I also seasoned the eggs and added milk. Also I waited till the food was on the plate to add the bacon. We like our bacon crunchy. Added extra cheese as well. I will be making this again.

Unfortunately, I have a really hard time making bacon crisp without burning it. Otherwise, it was a great use of the potatoes I still had in my pantry from a previous recipe.

BIG hit with family and grandkiddos!  The potatoes I used were pretty large, so I basically doubled the receipt.   Used 7 eggs and could have used 10.  Used more of the called for seasonings than suggested also.   It's a keeper at our house!

The only adjustment I made was by adding half a diced red onion half-way through cooking the potatoes. Adds a nice light crunch texture, just soft enough, and I love the flavor. I used a sharp cheddar cheese instead of regular- again, adding a bit more "bite" of flavor. But so easy and quick to cook, and filling!! Thank you for sharing this!

For this recipe I would add tomatoes, sauteed onions, Bell peppers. Because I am lactose intolerant, I'd for go adding milk, but use sour cream to the eggs. After the potatoes are cut, I'd mix them in a bowl with the bacon grease and seasonings. Parsley and spinach would be Great! Have Fun mixing in your own flavors.

Been making a similar one except with diced ham and sharp   cheese  for the past 53 years.  Learned it in the Army during my 22 years.  At time have added onions and red bell peppers.  Served with hot  toasted garlic Italian bread.

Good recipe. I partially baked potatoes day before  when making baked potatoes for that meal.  Peel partially baked potatoes and then cubed.  Cooked much faster.  I just left out the cheese as I am dairy free, but I did not miss it.

This is quick, delicious and only uses one pan! I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the cheese. I also added a splash of heavy whipping cream to the eggs! You can’t  go wrong with bacon, potatoes, eggs and cheese!

I reduced all ingredients as way too much food for 2 servings!  1 slice of bacon, 1 potato, 2 eggs and I served it with homemade Thai chilli sauce on the side. Yummy!

We also use any cooked left over potatoes - hash browns, baked or roasted.  It is a very forgiving dish that can accommodate any vegetable or protein you like.   Simply throw in an extra egg to cover additional ingredients.

I make something very similar to this, for a quicker potato, I put them in the microwave first, then cut them up and brown in pan with onions first.

I make this quite often.  I use whatever meat I have on hand.  Bacon, breakfast sausage, smoked sausage, ham.  I've even done it with leftover brisket.  Breakfast or supper- good for either one.

As easy as they come.  I used garlic powder and onion powder in place of garlic salt and seasoning salt to avoid the extra sodium.

This was delicious!   I had some leftover bacon from the previous day's breakfast as well as a couple of Russets and red-skinned potatoes.  Followed the recipe fairly closely, but changed the seasonings for our tastes (substituted onion powder for the garlic salt and had a special seasoning we'd picked up at an Amish market).   I also added a little 2% milk to the beaten eggs.  This is such a great basic recipe and allows you to add whatever ingredients you prefer.   I prepared this in a cast iron skillet, which crisped the bottom of the potatoes really nicely.  This was the perfect dish for a chilly November Sunday morning!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I was worried about the eggs not getting done, but it did fine.  We had this for supper and the hubby had it for breakfast the next day and loved it equally the same.

I followed the recipe, however, only added maple breakfast sausage to it.  It was awesome!  The kids loved it too.  I’ve made it twice so far and plan to do it again for family that’s visiting tomorrow.  Great breakfast recipe!!

This is a hearty dish that is very easy. Everyone loves it. It is called potato skillet for a reason. I thought it was too heavy on the potatoes, but my wife loved it. For breakfast I like more egg to potato ratio. Next time I will cut the amount of potatoes and up the egg count. I tripled it for six people. Very popular.

Made no changes. The eggs didn’t cook well on top of the potatoes without stirring, which made it more like scrambled eggs with potatoes stirred together. Probably will make in separate pans next time.

I love this recipe, but I did make some changes. I didn’t have bacon,  but I had 4 small breakfast ham slices. I diced them and used that instead of bacon. I also used onion powder (1/2 t), and 2 thick slices of onion, chopped. I cooked the onion with the potatoes that I semi-baked in the microwave.  I also added about 1/2 t cinnamon with the eggs.  Don’t ask why, I have a thing for cinnamon, but it works well with eggs, ham, and onions. Otherwise, I followed the directions as written. Loved it and I’ll be makIng this again. I only gave this 4 stars because of the changes, otherwise I would give this 10 stars.

I was a little disappointed in the taste...I think this dish needs a few more spices...or maybe some green pepper and onion in with the potatoes.

This easy and good, my husband even said it was yummy.  I liked being able to cook breakfast in one skillet without a bunch of fussing over individual sides, just throw it all together and serve.  Thanks so much for the idea.

Deducted one star for garlic.   Too many recipes call for it.  Recipe states "reserve" bacon fat.  This means you pour it all off, wipe your skillet if you want and add some fat back in if you want.  You can also go easy with the cheese.  If your recipe is too dry, add about a tablespoon or two of milk or water to the eggs.

Loved this. Made a couple of changes.  Used garlic cheddar cheese. Added a small diced onion.  Added 1/4 teaspoon of Essence of Emeral Creole seasoning. Simple and delicious!

Changes I made were because of necessity and not taste preference,  I used only 2 slices of bacon, which is only available here cut a quarter of an inch thick, I used 2 cloves of garlic and half a teaspoon of finely ground dried basil and rosemary instead of the non-available flavored salts, the cheese I used was Dutch gouda. This breakfast meal sold for 400 ruple in my restaurant and compared to a 2 egg and onion omelette at 100 ruple was good business.

I have been making this for years but I admit I just made it kid friendly and senior friendly.  I cook the bacon, drain on paper towel, drain almost all grease out.  Fry potatoes in the grease while pan is still hot.  Add onion when potatoes are soft.  Continue frying till slightly brown.  Add eggs  cook till done. Add bacon when serving.

Delicious. Instead of putting a lid on at the end, I added the eggs and finished cooking in the oven at 400 degrees for 3 minutes.

A winner! Everyone loved it! I made it as the recipe states. Because I needed more than two servings I used 4 medium potatoes, 4 eggs, and increased the seasonings a little. The only difference I made was to add a small onion to the potatoes.  I also added enough cheese to cover the whole top.  A wonderful breakfast/brunch dish and only one skillet to clean!

Added onion and used garlic powder rather than salt. It was good. Drained as much of the grease off as I could after cooking the potatoes in it. Not overly flavorful, I might try to spice it up a bit next time but also not necessary as the wife loved it as is so I will be making this again.

My Boy Scouts make this same recipe on their camp outs in a Dutch oven over a campfire. It always turns out great. The only other thing they do is add a diced onion.

I took the opinions of others, but also added brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder (instead of salt), and onion powder. I added bacon after the cheese! The brown sugar added just a hint of sweetness to it. To save time, I used frozen hashbrowns. My bacon had A LOT of grease which made the potatoes softer than they should have been. Next time, I'll pour off a bit.

So easy to make and can add your little twists too. I added garden fresh tomatoes, spinach and onions. Dab a little Tapatio for a some spice. Perfect Sunday morning breaky after a nice night out with your boo.

I used frozen potato o'brien (heat in a separate pan before adding to bacon grease so the water doesn't interact with grease negatively). I also used as spices: paprika, seasoning salt, garlic powder, and brown sugar.  The brown sugar added just the right amount of sweetness to savory. Those who ate it with me loved it! Thanks for this recipe. I'll make it again!

This was not for us at all! The only mistake i made was the potatoes not being cubed, other than that followed all directions. Sorry to say will not be making this again. But, we did try something new, it just wasn't to our liking.

This is a huge hit!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was good.  The next time we didn't have enough regular potatoes so I added a sweet potato to the mix.  Now we always do 1/2 regular and 1/2 sweet potato.

We make this all the time at my house except we call it "camping breakfast".  I add some peppers (any color) and some onions as well, then serve on Tortillas!  Obviously great for camping cooked over an open fire in a cast iron skillet!

Love this. Not a fan of bacon so I just left it out and used store bought lard. Otherwise, this recipe is great!

my boyfriend LOVED this breakfast recipe. I thought it was very good as well. I omitted the cheese and we didn't miss it. I used turkey bacon. I added butter to coat the potatoes (to make up for the grease the turkey lacked). I'll be making again soon but next time I think I'll use pork bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really good. Instead of regular bacon, I
used vegetarian bacon and I also added green bell pepper.I also boiled the potatoes, that way it doesnt take so long to cook. Left the cheddar cheese out and enjoyed it with ketchup and extra black pepper on top.

The current ingredients are rather average, but cheese, bacon and anything else is always tasty to some degree. You'll want to add something like chilies or red onion depending on your pallet. What baffles me is all the "one pan" and "one dish" reviewers.  You need to peel the potatoes and dice them, that requires dishes. You need a bowl and a whisk to beat the eggs, more dishes.  What about a rack or plate for the bacon when you need to crumble it? All of these requires what?.... Oh yeah, more dishes!  You can pull off much more of a one-dish skillet meal than this, any day.

I thought this was very good.  I scrubbed the potatoes well and put them in the micro wave for a few minutes.  I diced up the potatoes with skin on.  I also added onion and green peppers.  If you don't have a micro wave oven you could par boil them for 10 minutes.  Cuts down on the cooking time.   Sarah N.

This is fabulous. I've been doing versions of this for 20+ years. Started out as a camping breakfast due to the 'one pan' concept and gradually blossomed into a staple in my house. I make a big skillet full for Sunday brunch and then separate into single serving dishes for the rest of the week. I add all kinds of veggies, chili's, leftover taco meat, etc. I've even stretched it by adding diced sweet potatoes too. It's only limited to your imagination! You're going to love this one.

This makes a great skillet breakfast. When I bake potatoes I always do several & refrigerate the extras so that I have them on hand for quick and easy fried potatoes or hash browns. So I diced up a couple of baked potatoes for this recipe. Adjusted the seasonings to our tastes, plus I prefer to remove everything from the skillet and scramble the eggs separately then when they're almost done, mix the potatoes and bacon back in when them and top with the cheese. Just some minor adjustments to account for our preferences. Delicious quick and easy breakfast, good enough for company. Thanks

This is a great recipe and so easy. I added onions and did not put in the bacon until the eggs were almost cooked fully. Then, I added in the crumbled bacon and the shredded cheese. Delicious!

Tasty and quick!  Added the crisp bacon crumbles after the cheese was melted, as adding it beforehand softens the bacon.  Kicked it up a notch by adding fresh chopped green chile.  Yummy!!  Thanks for sharing!

Love a hearty breakfast that is easy, and this works nicely.  Next time, I'll cut the grease down to 2 tbsp, since I got about twice that with the thick-sliced bacon I like.  Would also try a few tbsp of onion and green pepper.

The recipe photo looks like green peppers were added.  I make this recipe with green peppers and onion and my family enjoys it.  Fresh potatoes taste best but I have used frozen shredded potatoes when pressed for time.

I made this with ground meat add some chopped onion, green bell pepper and garlic. Added a rotel and  tomotoe sauce, stir and cook a little. I add lot of seasoning on my dish because i did not had a seasoning salt that time being like paprika, cayen pepper, cumin, onion powder, dried parsley. Ofcourse the eggs end the end. Umm the dish was very yummy finished it up with nice french bread.

Excellent!  I added a small amount of onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper to the cooking of the potatoes.  Used more seasoning than called for and included onion powder and cayanne pepper to the seasoning mix.

The only adjustment needed is onion, more egg and top with salsa.

This was sooo good!!  I've tried skillet breakfasts in the past but was always disappointed.  Cooking the potatoes in the bacon grease really added to the flavor, instead of using butter.  I added a sprinkle of onion powder, too, but that was the only change I made.  Keeping the lid off the pan, unlike previous recipes I've tried, during the final step made a huge difference.  This recipe is one for my collection, for sure!

I like to add vegetables and onions. Also nice to add left over vegetables. It makes for a complete brunch or easy dinner dish

My family loves skillets, so I was anxious to try this one out.  It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it!  It's also nice because you can customize and add different things.  I only had Mozzarella cheese to top it with and it was still fantastic.

A little bland, but if you add enough salt it is pretty tasty. It may be better with sausage, just because that is more flavorful.

This was really good.  Had to substitute spicey sausage for the bacon as its hard to get hold of here in Turkey and expensive.  Might play around with it in future and add some onion or green peppers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made some minor adjustments to the seasonings. I used a pinch each of sea salt and garlic powder and lots of black pepper. Followed other reviewers advice to add the bacon after the cheese had melted. Served with some fried tomatoes. Thankyou LaDonna, my husband thoroughly enjoyed this.

Breakfast is my favorite meal and this one fills the bill. Thanks for the tip on letting the cheese melt first to make certain the bacon remains as crispy as possible. That helped. I am now excited about trying it as filling for a homemade breakfast burrito. Though I used a non-stick skillet, it does stick to the bottom. I will add a few more vegetables like mushrooms, green peppers and cilantro.

This is almost the same as my "Hashbrown Omelet" that I have cooked for years. I just browned a good amount of hashbrowns, packed them on bottom and sides making a 'crust'. I then added my crumbled bacon mixed in with my eggs, then cooked on low with a lid until eggs were set. Then added my cheese to melt. Delicious!

A Family Tradition @ my home for many years now. Chipped up Potatos fried down and smothered down w/onions. Seasoned with Salt,Pepper, and Garlic Powder. Browned Sage Sausage, beaten Eggs, topped w/American and Mozarella Cheese. Parsley Flakes sprinkled on top for extra flavor and Garnishment. It can also be topped w/Salsa or The Country White Peppered Gravy!

I love the skillet idea-that it's a one-pan meal.   I had already cooked the potatoes when I decided to make this and because of that I think it came out a big mushy when I re-added them to the pan...I also added salsa verde because it seemed like it would be a little dry without adding something. This is just a personal preference.   If I make it again, I think I might just add the salsa on top of everything at the end.   Overall, it was a pleaser!

Delicious but very greasy. I would pour off all excess bacon grease and then fry potatoes. The bacon and cheese add enough grease to the dish. If you have sensitive stomach, be warned.

Great recipe!  I eliminated the spices except pepper, precooked potatoes, and finished cooking the dish in the oven.  I topped it with bacon and cheese after I added the eggs to the potatoes.  It was so easy and the leftovers will be great tomorrow.  Next time I will add a few more eggs since I had a lot more potatoes this time but it was still perfect.  A piece of this is easy to eat when walking out the door.  It's a great fast food!
