Easy to make creamy richness. Microwaves vary in power. The prep time for this in a 1000W microwave is spot on but the cooling time is closer to 2 hours. Once cooled the cuts easier if left out at room temp for approximately 15 minutes. I used a Pyrex measuring cup to melt the chocolate and pour/drizzle over the fudge.

I really liked this recipe because it was quick and requires only a few ingredients and you can adjust it.  If you want nuts in it you can put them in or if you want more chocolate add more or put in less. My family and I really enjoyed this at Christmas :)
