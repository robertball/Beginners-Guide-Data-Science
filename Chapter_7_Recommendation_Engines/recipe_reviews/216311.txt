I was disappointed in this recipe. Not real "savory", not much flavor, very bland. If I were to try this recipe again, I would definately add some crushed red pepper or some other spice to give it more life.

I was craving thai food so I thought this might be a keeper....not. The only change I made initially was to use coconut milk instead of regular milk or water to give it a little more authentic thai flavor. (after reading other reviews) Unfortunately, after it was done, I realized I would have to doctor the heck out of this to get some much needed flavor and texture. Too thick and kinda gluey texture. After tasting I added 1 tablespoon red curry paste (not curry powder) and I think I should have added more. I also added one tablespoon of fish sauce & brown sugar and extra cilantro and I tossed in a couple tablespoons of fresh basil. Those changes made it acceptable to us. I still think the simple recipe from the  coconut milk can is far superior and actually alot cheaper than adding a can of mushroom soup??? I don't think of cream of mushroom when I think of Thai :) This one is not a keeper.

I thought it was great! I do think it was a little too much onion though. I used dried cilantro but do think fresh would be a lot better!

Very good dish. My first attempt at any type of Thai dish. I had some adjustments for ingredients I had or did not have:  used green bell peppers, left out the cilantro, 1 can of evaporated milk instead of milk and added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne. This actually made about 12 as a side dish. I definitely recommend this dish, great tasting and very easy to make!

This is a super easy meal, but the original recipe was definitely lacking something... I read a few other recipes and added brown sugar and a bit of soy sauce... Definitely not a traditional dish, but was good after adding those 2 ingredients.

A little thick on the peanut sauce. If you love peanut butter, you`ll love this recipe.
