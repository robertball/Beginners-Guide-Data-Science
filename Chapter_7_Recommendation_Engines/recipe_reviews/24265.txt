Excellent - didn't change a thing except for using red kidney beans instead.  No more package mixes for me!!!!  Update - made this again - teenagers love this chili - I didn't have good drinking wine on hand today but the Holland House Red Cooking Wine was passable for this recipe - I think the heat in this chili negates the wine flavor!!! I've also been adding more tomatoe paste since my family and guests like a thicker sauce and is good for the way they eat the leftovers.  When I serve this I've been putting out small dishes of diced onions, shredded cheddar cheese or american and sour cream.  Everyone seems to enjoy making their own creations.  Definitely put out some bread - a salad goes well with this also - especially if you like your chili spicy. -  When we are lucky enough to have leftovers the kids love to just heat this up making a sandwich on white bread or hambuger rolls with a thin slice of onion and melted cheez whiz - messy but soooo good. Again Cathie - thanks - this is the only chili I ever make now.

This was SO BLAND that I was afraid din din was a dud BUT I went to my other chili recipe (by BOB) and added all the good stuff and just a half a cup of beer since I had already added the wine.  Once you get Bob's chili recipe it's hard to go a-stray. *thumbs down* sorry..but ty

I wanted to update this. I wrote this review several years ago.  This is clearly our favorite chili.  We make it time and time again, and make it exactly as is.  I love the flavor of the sundried tomatoes. If you are looking for a unique chili, try this one!    

1/25/2004 - Very good.  Not your traditional chili flavor, but certainly will appeal to many of you. My kids liked it too.  We will definitely be having this again, and again.

This was alright. I prefer a LOT more spice in mine however, maybe it's a Texas thing? I did cook this for 4 hours for flavor. It was thin so I used up the rest of the can of tomato paste (6 oz.) as other reviewers suggested the last thirty minutes of cooking. It could have been more tomatoey tasting. I didn't have black beans so I used a can of ranch style beans and a can of dark kidney beans. This was pretty good, but I just couldn't give it 4 star, it needed way too many changes. Not bad at all, but we prefer a lot more spice and much much more chili peppers. Way too bland for our tastes. I served this over a bed of cooked spaghetti pasta and topped it with shredded colby/mj cheese. Hubby and son like chopped onion on theirs too. I won't bother even trying to make this again. We liked It's Chili by George far better.

UPDATE!  I still love the recipe, but realized I've modified it a bit.  I cut out the salt altogether and drain and rinse the beans.  --  I found this recipe last year and made it about 5 times in a month!  Freezes well and is delicious.  I don't like spicy chili, and this is as perfect as it gets.  I make Golden Sweet Cornbread (on this site) when I make this chili.  Thanks Cathie!

I added a 14 oz. can of beef broth, instead of 12 oz. as the recipe said (no big deal) and omitted the sage.  This has a nice rich taste, possibly because of the beef broth and wine.  You may want to taste it before adding 2 tsp. salt though.  I only added 1 tsp.  Someone may like spicier chili but you could adjust the seasoning if you'd like.  It tasted yummy to me though!  Also I added shredded cheddar at the table.

I make this recipe all the time. I have been using it for several years. I make it spicier than called for and then I serve it with sour cream, cheese, onions and cilantro on the side. The cilantro is a huge hit as a garnish!

That is was pretty good. I added 1/4 tsp cumin because I like the taste, but kept everything else the same. I like a mild chili so this one was perfect. I liked the balsamic vinegar. To thicken this a bit, I took the lid off the last 15 minutes and turned the heat up a bit to reduced the liquid. I will be making this again.

By reading I knew that it needed some of my touch that I like. Honestly by itself it still marvelous, very tasty + you would have at least 3 more bowls. I had 3, my wife had 2 & my daughter had 1.   My wife asked me to do another batch.  I must tell you I also added a little spice for me but not too much or the family will not like it. Also I added some cheese with the chill.  The rest was as describe in the recipe. As I said it is excellent as is,  & also for people who do not like spicy food.  5 STAR  ALL THE WAY TOO THE MOON..

Oh MY Goodness this is soooooo good! I made it exactly and the only thing I would change is the olive oil. Not sure why you would need it. I use lean beef too. MY NEW Favorite. YUMMO. If I could give it more stars I would.

Very good, but definitley different from any other chili I've ever made (I usually use a crock-potted version of Debdoozie's chili from this site).  The wine and black beans add a much "classier" taste than your usual down-home chili.  Still fantastic with cheddar, sour cream and/or buttered Saltines (my own personal chili weakness).

I'm sure we'll make this more, but it won't become my default chili recipe.  Good for mixing it up a little :-)

I cooked the chili according to the instructions given in the recipe.  This chili is rather mild tasting.  My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it!  I served it with Fritos corn chips and shredded Mexican cheese.

We really enjoyed this chili!  I halved the recipe since I only had 1 lb of beef, but used the whole can of beans and half a can of tomato paste.  Plus, as I usually do when I cook with wine, I added a little extra red wine here and there!  It made great leftovers as well.

Nice and easy and quick.  All the things I like about cooking.  I used a red chilli (Ozi spelling there) instead of a Jalapeno, I added a capsicum (or red pepper as you might call it) and.... 1 teaspoon of "Turbo Supercharged Habanero Paste".  That last ingredient really did the trick!!
The result was great, although it was a tiny bit watery, I might cook it with the lid off next time to give it a bit of thickness.

I really liked this recipe. I know it's not quite the same as regular chili, but it was pretty tasty. I substituted ground turkey for beef, and i took a couple slices of turkey bacon, minced, and added that as the turkey was browning. I know it sounds strange, but your chili will be all the better for it. Thanks for submitting.

I only had a pound of meat on hand, so I halved the recipe. It was not the traditional chili I am used to. The chili was very light on beans, for one thing. And while it was flavorful and hearty, it was not overly spicy. We did enjoy it, though, and I will probably make the next time we are in the mood for a more "gourmet" chili. I served this with cornbread muffins, and it was a good match.

This is some yummy chili! This was the first time I made chili from scratch and I loved it! Although I did put the whole 8 ounce can of tomato paste in instead of just 2 Tablespoons and added another 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a half tablespoon more of chili powder. I also added pieces of Kiebalsa Sausage to it which made it all the better! My husband loves it spicy and he loves this recipe. Thanks for the recipe Cathy. I will definately be making this Chili again soon!

I was very disapointed with this recipe. From the comments, I knew it would not be very spicey, but I could fix that if I found I needed to, for us the problem was the vinegar taste was too strong. Too much needs to be altered for our family taste, so I will not make again.

I thought this chili was great! I will definitely make it again. The only thing I did different from the recipe was add the whole 6 oz. of tomato paste, I didn't want to waste it. This recipe is great!

Fantastic! I didnt have bay leaf, cayenne or sage and I used a pot on the stove instead of a dutch oven. I used the sundried tomatoes that come chopped and in oil (nice time saver). I added red pepper flakes, black olives and a little tabasco.. turned out great! "The Guys" loved it! I fed 4 last night and have plenty left over too!

This was very meaty, not too spicey, and best of all - the flavor was superb, with lots of depth.  The red wine and vinegar give it a fabulous taste. I doubled the recipe and will be enjoying it for a long time.

Really yummy flavor.  We didn't have black beans so I used red beans and left out the tomato paste all together (didn't have any).  It turned out great!!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

mincing the sun dried tomatoes took an extra bit of time, but was well worth it!  
This chili is not the typical peppery hot, but a milder 'gourmet' chili packed with flavor, which is why my family loved it!  Great new subtle twist.

Not the quickest chili to make, but not overwhelming either.  Follow the recipe to a "T" and you'll have a meaty, flavorful, dish to please anyone.  I particularly liked this recipe since it does not contain flour and is good for people concerned about their carb intake.  I also gave the carb lovers in my life a bag of Frito's to go along with the meal and I'm sure cornbread would also be a delicious sidedish.  Enjoy this recipe, it's a keeper!

LOVED this chili!!  Great baseline recipe...not very spicy.  Next time I will add more cayenne and chili powder to spice it up!  Otherwise, it was great...my husband really like it!

This recipe is fantastic, my young kids and their friends love it.   They named it Bubba and won a Chii cookoff with it.  I didn't change a thing, other than not using the cheese and onions to garnish.

I used the recipe for the base of spices- I only used 1 pound of meat and use some chili beans and two cans of diced tomatoes. I loved the beef stock, wine and vinegar. I did add some pepper sauce and sugar & cooked for about 90 minutes - was absolutely delicious. Served with a dollop of sour cream and cheese on top. I will make this again for sure.

Loved this recipe. The black beans were a nice change from the standard kidney beans. Following the advice of other reviewers, I cautiously reduced the amount of Balsamic vinegar but left it in.  I also tripled the Chili Powder as we like it fairly hot.  Cornbread was a nice accompaniment.

Updated review.. this is our go to chili.. folks remember it, and we use it in a chili contest yearly.  Yum! Here are my tweaks..
Extra onion, extra red wine, a little more balsamic, extra chili powder, brown sugar instead of white. So very good and kids love it too.

This was an excellent recipe. First I made this recipe as is and then used it as a spring board. Wonderful chili when made according to the recipe. Who would have thought to add wine and balsamic vinegar ....BUT..... I HAD to tweaked it a bit the second time around.....Added 1 1/2 cup chopped onion total amount and a half cup of chopped green pepper and 1/2 cup chopped celery, pinch of cinnamon, couple of pinches cocoa powder, 2 large cans whole tomatoes (had no tomato sauce nor purée) 1 small can roasted garlic tomato paste, Cooked the onion, pepper and celery with meat while browning it. Best chili ever husband says. Enough heat without being too much. Will definitely make again, and again and again.

I cut the meat back to 1.4 lbs and used 2 cans of kidney beans. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste. I added veggies (bell pepper and celery). I didn't have any chili powder, but I used 1/4 tsp Datil pepper and chopped some fresh peppers from the garden instead. This recipe is very adaptable - and the combination of balsamic vinegar, red wine and sun dried tomatoes makes this chili heartier. Family prefers this recipe over my older recipe.

I loved this spin on chili. I have been cooking chili a lot lately and wanted something different. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste. I used red wine vinegar instead of red wine. and I used diced tomato with onion instead of stewed tomato. I used the same spices and cant wait to taste this again tomorrow for lunch.

Fabulous recipe. I didn't have garlic, so I used garlic powder and no cayenne or chili seasonings so I used 2 tbls of a pre-made chili seasoning. It was lovely. Made some fresh rolls for dipping and none lasted!

I made this for a crowd - for 32 servings, added 4 chopped up jalapenos and 6 chopped up cooked italian sausages.

Best Chili Ever! Would definitely win first place - enough bite and flavor to take home a blue ribbon.

WONDERFUL CHILI RECIPE!!!  Very different...in a good way :)  My family loved it - my grandpa even told me it was the best he ever tasted (my grandma was a bit offended!)  I added extra wine and vinegar, and the taste was outstanding!

Excellent! My picky kids even loved it. I ran the tomatoes through the food processor before adding, and the chili wasn't quite so chunky. My husband wished for more beans, however. (Just what he needs.. NOT!)
