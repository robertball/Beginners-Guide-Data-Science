This recipe is a delicious classic!!  However, my recipes specifies 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter instead. I usually add an extra tablespoon or two of flour to the batter and then chill it for several hours before baking. This ensures "thick", perfectly formed cookies. View my submitted photo and see for yourselves. Thanks for the recipe!!! This one ROCKS!!!

So easy to make and very good. I ommitted the salt & used salted butter. A helpful tip for coating the cookies in the sugar/cinnamon mixture is to put the mixture in a ziplock baggie and then add the balls of dough. It is an easy mess free way to coat the cookies.

Excellent! This is the best snickerdoodle recipe I have tried in many years.  The real test was how long they lasted in the cookie jar...well, they never made it to the jar!  Very soft, just the right chewy-ness.  I used less sugar in the batter and they stayed softer.

These freeze great.  Roll the dough in the cinnamon sugar mixture and throw them in a Ziploc bag.  When you want some cookies, grab a few and put them right on the cookie pan -- frozen.  They taste just as good.  It's weird, this is an old fashion recipe, and they don't seem like anything too special, but people just go nuts for these.  I swear, it's like everyone loves a snickerdoodle.

I'm a big snickerdoodle fan and these cookies are one of the best I've ever made! I (like some other reviewers)added a tsp. of vanilla, and I also replaced the shortening with butter. Love these cookies!

Pretty good, but I would change a few things.  And a teaspoon of vanilla and ditch the salt.  It gives the cookie a funny aftertaste.  I also used the butter flavored crisco.  I got 30 cookies out of one batch.

I followed the directions exactly, but the cookies tasted horrible and puffed up too much.  I will not use this recipe again!

Love it Love it Love it! I had never made these cookies befor today but now will be my fav! I did omit the salt these cookies dont need it, plus i chill the dough before making into balls. The chilled dough makes the perfect crackled top. Wonderful cookies that are so easy to make!

I make snickerdoodles at least once a week and this is the recipe that I use as a base for my cookies. I always use 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter and instead of 2 teaspoons cream of tartar, I use only 1 and I increase the baking soda by a teaspoon. I also add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla in with the creamed sugar, butter, shortening mixture. As with any cookie recipe (or for baking in general) let your eggs and butter sit out until they reach room temperature (usually around 30 minutes for the eggs and 1 hour for the butter). Also, beat the butter, shortening and sugar WELL first. I mix them in my stand mixer with the paddle attachment for about 5 minutes before I add the eggs and vanilla. Although this recipe does not  say to chill the dough I have found that chilled cookie dough just works better than non-chilled dough, no matter what kind of cookie you are baking. Chill the dough for at least an hour and roll it out into balls that are similar in size, they do not have to be perfectly round. Depending on what you are craving you can also add a little nutmeg in with the cinnamon/ sugar mixture for a little touch of spice. Bake the cookies JUST until they begin to crack on the top. They may look undone, but when they cool they will be a little crunchy around the edges but deliciously chewy in the center. I get repeated requests to make these cookies by my family, friends, even acquaintances. These are spectacular cookies!

This recipe was excellent!  I made these cookies for a cookie exchange and I got rave reviews.  This was the first time I made Snickerdoodles and the recipe was very easy to follow.  The cookies stayed soft for days.  Thanks for a great recipe!

18 SERVINGS, not cookies.  2 cookies each. :-)  Anyway, these are delicious - classic snickerdoodles!  I use butter-flavored Crisco and a little more flour, and don't bake them any longer than specified, sometimes a little shorter (I like gooey cookies).

Fantasic!  I didn't have any cream of tartar on hand so I used a conversion I found online and instead used 3 teaspoons of baking powder and a half teaspoon of baking soda, omitting the 1 tsp of baking soda called for in the recipe.  They turned out soft and perfect!

This is the first recipe I've tried for Snickerdoodles, there won't be anymore.  I've found the BEST on my first try.  We just love them, and wouldn't change a thing. Thank You Amy!
I also noticed reviews complaining that they are hard or crunchy after they cool, or they have an aftertaste.  Well, if U don't overbake them, only cook as specified, yes they look raw, but they aren't. U must ONLY bake 8-10mins. to stay soft. They will stay soft and chewy, right down to the last one.  The so called "aftertaste" is the creme of tarter, and it's suppose to taste like that.  I use extra cinnamon & sugar on mine, cuz I love cinnamon.

This is the BEST snickerdoodle recipe.  My favorite, by far.  Sometimes, I use butter flavored shortening, for a more buttery taste. And I ALWAYS chill my dough before rolling in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  They seem to hold their shape better after being chilled, and mine tend to stay "puffier" after baking.
Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  This is like a recipe in a cookbook from 1968 that my mother had given me.  The cookbook was damaged during a fire, and I didn't remember the "exact" measurements.  This is IT!  Thanks so much!

I used a 3/4 c whole wheat flour, and 1/2 splenda in this recipe in place of some of the ap flour/sugar. They tasted pretty good and my Mom liked them, which is why I made them. However 1 1/2 days later and they are pretty darn stale. Kinda did not have *too* much flavor. Oh well.....

Excellent cookie!  I used salted butter and omitted the salt instead of using shortening and they were amazing!  Doubling the recipe was definately no problem.  You can't get any easier than this and the flavor was greatl  I will be using this for the holidays each year, thank you!

Wonderful cookies! I must roll mine small because I got about 100 cookies from this recipe! I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 cup shortening because that is all I had. Also, I ran out of cinnamon/sugar mixture halfway through rolling, and didn't have any more cinnamon on hand, so I did the other half with pumpkin pie spice...I think I like it better!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for some guys that I go to college with and the reviews that I got from them were great. One told me that they "were the most amazing thing he had ever tasted." To be totally honest they were awesome. I used salted butter and left out the salt that the recipe called for and they turned out great. I will definitely use this recipe again.

If I had known snickerdoodles were this easy to make, I would've started a lot sooner! Delicious, but be sure not to over-bake even a little or you'll end up with something you might lose a tooth to.

These were good, but the first batch got too hard, and lacked flavor. However, after the dough was frozen, they came out fluffy and light. My suggestions are to freeze the dough, leave out the salt, and add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. Also, try dipping the dough in melted butter before you coat it. It gave me a much crispier coating.

Ooooh!  A snickerdoodle recipe I haven't tried!  I love snickerdoodles and so do our customers.  I saw a  picture of this cookie posted by "Diana" and it looked so good I had to try it.  I'm glad I did.  It turned out perfectly--all crackled and puffy.  Great recipe!

They turned out great! Soft on the inside, but cooked through. Perfect! I cooked them for 10 min and 15 sec at 375. The only thing I did different was to leave out the salt and add 1 tsp of vanilla to the creamed mixture of butter, sugar, and eggs. Wonderful recipie. Will definitely use again and again.

I just used this! It's great. Followed it completely only I left the dough in the fridge for 1 hour before rolling it in the sugar and cinnamon, and I put it back in the fridge between each batch. They came out so great that my grandma wants me to makes these from now on! First time making snickerdoodles and I love this recipe!

These cookies are WONDERFUL!! I did tweak the recipe a little by using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter shortening. It gives them the perfect texture and taste!

This is the BEST snickerdoodle recipe! I used butter instead of shortening and added vanilla and almond for a twist. Amazing!!!!

Exactly what a Snickerdoodle should be. I did use half margerine, half butter and I added 1 tsp. vanilla. I liked that I didn't have to chill the dough before baking because nothing irritates me more than making cookie dough and having it spread all over the cookie sheet. Great quick cookie that is perfect to make with little hands. What's not to like about Snickerdoodles? NOTE: For those who come behind me and want to sub half butter, half margerine......don't. I had a heck of a time getting these off the baking sheet and they were a little dry. I ended up baking the first set at 350* for ten minutes which was too long but 350* for eight minutes was a little better. My husband ate them anyhow but I could tell the difference. Don't make the mistake I did.

These were PERFECT Snickerdoodles - not overly sweet and chewy and flavorful, and so easy. I made a batch and then my teen daughter made a batch to give for Christmas presents. The only changes we made were to substitute 1/2 the shortening with butter, and to press the cookies down slightly with a drinking glass to get those wonderful cracked edges.

These were fabulous!  My 7 year old and I made them together.  Baked them for 10 minutes and took them out when they looked a tad undone.  This was perfect as they are now soft and yummy!!

Exactly as I remember them as a kid!.  Made recipe, as written, except I used parchment paper instead if greasing a cookie sheet.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Everytime anyone tries these cookies they are totally impressed and begging for the recipe. They're perfectly sweet and delicious. I usually use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I think the butter makes the cookie a little softer and it also adds a little extra richness. I have even added the cinnamon into the batter (an accident the first time) and they are delicious, but only if you like the flavor of cinnamon.  It just makes the flavor a little more distinct. Definitely a keeper!

These were great! I made these for a potluck, and one of my co-workers asked for the recipe. I made the mistake of making a batch a little too small so they came out a little dry and crunchy, but still good :). Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe.  I took others' advice and used the parchment paper.  I started rolling in the sugar, then switched to a bag - much easier, and coats better with the bag!  Definitely a keeper!

These cookies are awesome!  The only change I made to the recipe was using butter-flavor Crisco instead of regular shortening.  Baked for 8 minutes - cookies will not look done, but they set nicely.  Very chewy on the inside! MMMMM

What a perfect cookie to make when you don't have many ingredients on hand!   Just a note: I added 2 tsp vanilla, omitted salt, used half butter and half butter flavored crisco.  They turned out nice and soft, but still had a good texture on the outside.  Company even said they tasted just like the scnickerdoodles you buy at Hogi Yogi!

Instead of sifting, I used 1/4 cup less flour. It probably could have used less salt, too.

Amy, if you had asked me this question yesterday, I couldn't have answered you because until tonite, believe it or not, I had never experienced a snickerdoodle! Well, now I can answer you....NO ONE DOES NOT LOVE A SNICKERDOODLE!!!! We're crazy about them!! We're making an assortment of cookies for my daughters highschool graduation party and this recipe was one of my choices. Thanks Amy for a super duper cookie recipe which I'm sure all of our guests will gobble up as quickly as we are tonite. (hope there's some left for them) Ha, ha!!

Excellent cookie!  I used 1/2 shortening and half butter.  I think that may be why they spread more than I had remembered.  Taste was great though!  I decreased sugar by 1/4 cup.  These have always been a favorite cookie in my house! :)  Method I used was dark cookie sheet that I forgot to spray, but they didn't stick; I baked at 365 for 8 1/2 minutes.  In reply to comment about vanilla, they don't need it because they have a cinnamon flavor! :)

This is an excellent recipe! I (as other reviewers suggested) Cut down on the sugar and also used butter instead of shortening and did not add the salt. They turned out GREAT! I also experimented and added butterscotch chips to half the dough and the were excellent! They were very soft. I will defiantly be making these again!

Been using this recipe for years and finally getting around to reviewing it!  Love these. I took another reviewers advice and froze them after rolling them in the sugar. That way I always have perfect cookies to serve warm at anytime.

These came out delicious! I did make a few changes that I believe actually improved it. I used 1 cup of sweet salted butter instead of shortening and omitted the salt. I use self rising flour so there is no need for baking soda. I didn't have cream of tartar but they still came out fine. I also added about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. They came out perfect :)

These cookies are fabulous! I took them to a family get-together and they were ALL eaten! A bonus -- This is a great project to involve your children in -- my 4-year-old LOVED making the balls an then help roll them in the cinnamon.

I adored these cookies.  both my boyfriend and my brother both said the same thing "Cinnamon Toast Crunch!"  They're good.  I added more cinnamon than suggested because I adore cinnamon.

I was very disappointed in these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and then they flattened out when taken out of the oven and were crispy rather than soft and chewy.  I won't use this one again.  I had an old snickerdoodle recipe that I couldn't find and it was soft and chewy and great.  I need to find that recipe.

Great taste!  I subbed 1/2 cup real sweet cream butter for part of the shortening and added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla as some of the previous reviewers suggested.  Cookies made with full shortening in lieu of butter take on a somewhat stale taste if not eaten in a day or two.  I also wanted to note for those who have not tasted or made a Snickerdoodle cookie before that the original Snickerdoodles recipe calls for butter, thus the shortening in this recipe must be butter flavored since this is a butter/shortbread flavored cookie. :)

I wish I had followed some of the reviewers tips by using butter instead of shortening.  They also needed more flavor -- maybe the vanilla would have helped, but I think the butter might do the trick.  Nice texture though - very pretty snickerdoodles.

I did not care for this recipe.  They left a greasy film in your mouth and they had the texture of a piece of bread.  Look for a recipe that uses butter instead of shortening.

Great little cookie! Very tender, crisp/chewy edges. Never mind greasing the cookie sheets, use parchment paper instead. I doubled the cinnamon/sugar mix though. This made 4 dozen good sized cookies. We love snickerdoodles. Thanks.

Great tasting snickerdoodles, but I hate that the texture of the snickerdoodle depends on the cooking time so much.  The first few times I've made snickerdoodles they have been too soft or too hard.

Just a comment on the baggie method of applying the cinnamon/sugar mixture:  This was a cleaner and quicker method of doing things, but I personally don't recommend it.  When I tossed my dough in the baggie, I found that it picked up primarily the cinnamon, and wound up with just a "dusting" of that on the outer surface.  The ones I've rolled into it in the past have taken on more of the sugar along with it, and have tasted much better.

I rated this cookie a 3 because it was just ok. I followed the recipe pretty much as directed, except I added 1 tsp. vanilla and only 1/4 tsp. salt as other reviewers had said. It was very easy to make and without a lot of mess. 

What I didn't like about it was that they didn't stay soft. After they were completely cooled they got very crunchy. That could have been because I made them a bit smaller. I got 40 cookies out of the entire recipe. The other problem that I had was that I could taste egg. It was more of an aftertaste, but I don't really like my breakfast mixed with my cookies. This could have been something I did wrong since I didn't see anyone else saying anything about it. I probably won't make this recipe again.

Everyone DOES love Snickerdoodles.  I've been making these for years.  My recipe is like this one except 1/4 cup less sugar and add 1 tsp vanilla.  The big difference is my recipe says to cook at 450 degrees for 7 to 8 minutes.

This recipe was easy to make.  The cookies were all right.  They were really poofy, but soft.  There was too much salt.  You could taste the salt in the cookie.  Definitely leave out the salt.  An earlier review said to put vanilla instead of salt.  I AGREE!  Leave out the salt.

Other than that, the cookies were good. s

This turned out really well.  I followed the recipe.  The cookies are crisp, I think due to the shortening.  Next time I may do 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.   They are tasty though :)

This was just OK. My family thought it was too doughy. I decided to flatten them with a fork and they were much better. I think they rose too much.

I made these for my very picky father-in-law for Father's Day who had asked simply for a "baked goodie" as this year's gift. They were fantastic. I made small cookies, baked them at 375 for 7 minutes and 45 seconds. They are chewy and perfect!

Perfect!  They were extremely easy to make and came out chewy and delicious.  I will make these many times.  I used butter flavored shortening and rolled them with turbinado sugar and cinnamon.

This is the favorite cookie in my house!
 I press the dough into the cinnamon & sugar mixture twice. After the first pressing I set it to the side and let the cinnamon & sugar latch onto the moisture from the dough then I recoat them. :) yumyumyum

Taste exactly as they should. Lactose free, which is good for our household. The dough was a little dry and at times difficult to roll into balls.

I was excited to find this since I didn't have butter but wanted to make cookies! Followed recipe exactly and they tasted great (I love cream of tarter in cookies). However I gave it a 4 since they were flatter than I like.  I live at a high altitude so that's probably something I'll just have to adjust on my own-probably need to do 1/4 tsp of baking powder next time.  Will def make again-thanks for sharing!

I just tried these with the suggestion of adding flour (added 2 t for a double batch) and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 Crisco - LOVE them.  I've been looking for a recipe the last few years, and needed something for a potluck at work tomorrow. :)

I made a half batch of these cookies to test taste the other day because I wasn't sure if they would be good or not.  They definitely were good.  I then made a full batch today for my friends house tomorrow and as I was taking the last pan out of the oven I realized that I missed putting in the 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I tasted one and it made no difference from what I could tell.  I also used in place of 1 cup of shortening 2 sticks of no salt butter.  So basically there's no salt at all in these cookies and they still came out good.

They had an interesting aftertaste, but I think it's because there's no vanilla in them. I thought that was odd. For this recipe, I'd add 1/2 tsp. vanilla with the eggs.

The only substitutions I made were: adding 1 tsp. vanilla and used butter instead of shortening as other reviewers recommended.  My cookies turned out flat despite having been refridgerated.  I believe it was because of my cream of tartar...it was a bit old, but I tried to use it anyway.  But my 2 star rating is not because of the flatness of the cookies, but for the taste.  I've only made Egg Nog Snickerdooles in the past at Christmas time.  They have a much better flavor than these.  I don't know what I was expecting, but these were a taste disappointment for me.  I will stick to my Egg Nog Snickerdoodle recipe from now on.  Sorry Amy!

Delicious!! Chewy middles and crunchy edges.   Made it according to the recipe first time and found it too salty.  Decreased salt to 1/4t, added a t of vanilla and made it with half shortening and half butter.

I just made these, followed the recipe as is and they're great! One reviewer mentioned she didn't use as much sugar which resulted in a softer cookie. I didn't try that but they're still fine. Thanks!

Both times, this recipe had an odd tangy/bitter taste that people noticed. The first time, I thought the cream of tartar was old and replaced it. But it tasted the same with fresh cream of tartar. Snickerdoodles shouldn't taste tangy. It may not be the recipe's fault. I'll try a recipe without cream of tartar next time.

This recipe was so easy & they are so good! I did substitute butter for shortening & I cut the salt in half. I also added a tsp. of vanilla. They are delicious!!! Next time I think I'll just omit the salt as one of the other reviewers said it has a salty aftertaste just a little. Overall, great though!!!!

These cookies are good but the cinnamon taste was a little over-powering and cookies were crispy, hence the 4 stars.  Made a second batch with a few changes - rolled dough in mixture of 1/4 cup sugar with 2 tsp of cinnamon and replaced the shortening with butter, we like a softer cookie without the cracks.  Baked at 375 for 8 mins, came out better.

These cookies are wonderful!  I forgot to add the salt, but it didn't matter, these still came out nice and cakey on the inside with a crisp outside.  Perfect Snickerdoodle.

Loved them.  I made them for Christmas gifts along with other varieties. My husband is the dessert tester and he liked these cookies the best. The nice thing about these cookies is that they aren't super sweet.  Just right.

I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a tiny bit (1/8 tsp) of almond extract. 8-10 minutes was NOT enough. I needed at least 13. They got hard on the outside as soon as they cooled. They taste really good, I used red and green sugar. I hope people at work like them! Oh, and use butter flavored shortening. That white stuff in a can is nasty, I would never use that in these cookies!

These are superb!  I wanted them to be disc-shaped, so I flattened them a bit by pushing on the balls of dough before I placed them in the oven, and they turned out just how I wanted them.  The flavor was perfect.  Ph, I did add a teaspoon of vanilla.  That's the only thing I did differently.

Simply the best snickerdoodle recipe out there. I usually follow the recipe exactly when I make it the first time. I dd change one thing on this one though...I used butter instead of shortening. Just a personal preference.

The cookies were soft and slightly crunchy.  I baked them for 13 mins at 325 degrees.  I also made them about an inch size ball.   36 cookies really made double that, since they were smaller.  I froze some, will see if they turn out at a later date.  I also added some vanilla to the batter and omitted salt since I used salted butter.

I only gave these three out of five stars because I had to modify it to make them perfect. I used butter instead of shortening and added a teaspoon of almond extract for flavor. If you make them with my exceptions, they will turn out absolutely perfect!

This is one beautiful cookie!  I haven't met a single person who hasn't liked this recipe.  They're a big hit a Christmas and all year long in my family.  Perfect eaten out of the oven or kept in an air tight container.

I made 17 dozen snickerdoodles using this recipe.  I used all butter and no shortening.  The cookies were delicious!  They did come out flat - I don't know what the trick is to get them puffier but who cares really - they were yummy!  A neighbors little boy told me they were that was the best cookie he has ever eaten in his entire life- you can't get a better review then that!

Very good snickerdoodle recipe. As per some reviews I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and cut the salt.

I followed the recipe using butter instead of shortening and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  The dough was a little too soft to ball, so I put it in a plastic bag with a corner cut off and squeezed out lumps directly into the bowl with cinnamon/sugar.  The dough was much easier to handle once it was coated.  Cookies took 12 minutes to bake.  They came out soft, moist and very puffy.  There is a slight after taste...  This recipe is good enough for right now, but I'm going to keep looking.

This recipe was just average, I don't think the cookies had a lot of flavor and they were hard they got too hard. Almost everyone who ate them enjoyed them but I'll probably keep looking for a better recipe.

I don't use the review section to re-write other people's recipes instead of just submitting my own. So my review is: Fantastic!! Took them to work and they disappeared in a flash.

These were the best snickerdoodles! I did add the vanilla as others suggested, and used butter - YUM!

Recipe works very well for a basic structure, but cookies tasted more like sugary biscuits than cookies in first batch. Second batch, I added one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and they turned out absolutely yummy! These are white cookies, so take them out when the timer goes off, even if they don't look done otherwise they will be hard when cooled.

My cookie press broke during a baking session and I had to find something quick to make as a substitute.  This recipe was super-easy to follow and the cookies taste great!  I added some colored sprinkles to the cinnamon/sugar and rolled the cookies in that.  They looked very festive when done.

Great easy recipe! I substituted 3/4 cup butter for the shortening and baked them for the minimum 8 minutes. If you put a paper towel over the cookies as soon as you transfer them to the cooling rack, they will cook a bit more, but turn out soft and chewy and remain that way for days (if the cookies last that long!)

This is the same exact recipe my girlfriend's mother passed down to her and my girlfriend is 61, so you can tell it is a tried and true keeper! I did flatten a bit with the bottom of the glass. They freeze wonderfully as well and make a good Christmas cookie.

Just like Mom used to make!!  These cookies are delicious!! I did modify it a bit to suit our tastes...I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter, and then added a bit of nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  They turned out perfect!  Thanks so much!!

I followed some other suggestions - 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. shortening, no salt but substitute vanilla.  I also flattened the balls with the bottom of a drinking glass.  This made them turn out quite a bit thinner (which I like), but it decreased the cook time to 6 to 8 minutes.  They're still not exactly what I wanted, but this is the closest recipe I've found.  They were soft and yummy, though.  Thanks!

How can there be anyone who's never heard of a Snickerdoodle?? These are delicious. I thought they looked underbaked after 10 minutes and ended up baking them for 15. They looked fat, but turned out hollow and crispy...I don't know if this was due to the increased baking time or what, but they were very good. Next time I'll take them out at 10 min and see if the texture is any different. I saw that it was supposed to make 18 cookies so I doubled the recipe and ended up with almost 6 dozen! Someone makes very large cookies!!

I baked these cookies today and they turned out great.  Like the other reviews I added a tsp of vanilla and used butter crisco.  After rolling them in the sugar and cinnamon I gently flattened them.  Next time I think I'm only going to use a tsp of cream of tartar.  Happy Baking!

Excellent! I used 3/4 c butter flavored Crisco and 1/4 c country crock margarine because I was craving something sweet and that's all I had on hand! I also added 1 tsp vanilla when I was mixing in the eggs. The cookies turned out great. They were flatter, probably because of the margarine, but tasted fabulous. I will definitely be keeping this in my favorite cookie recipes! Thanks!

I made these for Christmas and they were a big hit.  My husband, who didn't know what a snickerdoodle was, decided they are now his favorite cookie.  I've never been able to get a snickerdoodle right until I found this recipe.  I'll be making them every holiday now.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out right.  The cookie has a  light, delicious, cinnamon-sugar flavor.  They are perfect with a cup of tea.  My kids love them, too.

Mine tasted like dough with sugar. I must have made it wrong because i did not like mine. I wanted to make them for a cookie exchange and i failed making these cookies.

This was a great recipe. I shortened the bake time by about 3 minutes so the cookies would not be as crunchy. This will vary, depending on your oven. I find no fault in the recipe.

Just like other reviewers, I used 1/2 c. shortening and 1/2 c. butter (instead of 1 c. shortening) and added 1 teas. of vanilla. Also chilled the dough before making the balls for baking. Turned out great. Thanks for recipe.

It was a little dry, but the judges didn't mind!

This was a phenomenal recipe. I substituted the shortening for 2 sticks of softened butter. I also added a pinch of cinnamon to the dough. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar. Thank you for this recipe!

Best cookies I ever made for the grandchildren!  I exactly followed the directions and ingredients. Each batch makes 30 large cookies.  The first batch lasted about 9 minutes.  I had to make 2 more batches that day!  Thumbs Up!  Tommy C.

Not to brag or anything, but I made the most amazing snickerdoodles I’ve ever made using this recipe just the other night. It’s literally amazing, and y’all have to try it. My only suggestion would be to maybe bake them for a tiny bit less time than the recommendation, but thats definitely up to your preference. My oven tends to be a little on the hotter side so I almost burned them but they were still awesome.

These are SUPER good. Make sure you add the cream of tartar to get the nice cracked texture. I always add a pinch more than the recipe calls for. I didn’t have eggs, only a carton of egg whites. I used about 5 oz (weight) of egg whites and I added 2 Tbs of butter milk to replace the fat of the yolk. It worked like a champ! So crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but not too sweet.

This recipe was very good. I needed a shortening recipe because I only had a stick of butter. I ended up using 1/4 cup butter and 1 3/4 cup shortening for a double recipe. It will not replace my Mrs Sigg’s recipe from this site but it was a very good recipe when I needed to use mostly shortening. I’m typically only a butter baked. I used the middle sized Pampered Chef scoop and the full 10 minutes was perfect. I used parchment, because I always do. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few mistakes making this, but they still turned out amazing. I used butter instead of shortening, but the taste and texture is great. I also forgot the cream of tartar, and I thought all hope was lost. They didn’t have the nice crack, but they were puffed up without being too thick. I also cut down the flour by 1/4 cup and I’m glad I did. Dough was perfect— more flour would’ve made it too thick in my opinion. 9 min was ideal baking time. Overall, butter isn’t that big of a deal.

Didnt have any cream of tartar so didnt use it .Used l/4 tsp lemon juice instead.  I used butter instead of shortening, and put 2 tsp baking powder instead of 1 of baking soda. Delicious!!

Yummy!  I used salted butter instead of shortening, which I don't have, and kept the original amount of salt. I made sure to cream the butter and sugar and eggs for at least 3 minutes, or until it looked very fluffy! It was a bit difficult to mix the flour in there with it, but wow they turned out so gloriously tasty! I baked for 8 minutes and, using a number 50 scoop, got 43 cookies.  Will make again!

This is a fail safe recipe. Admittedly, I felt a bit over indulgent adding 1 C shortening (oh my!) but it does keep the cookies tender the next day, if they last that long. And the flavor is fantastic whether you used regular ol' shortening or butter flavored. My husband and kids keep asking for more!

This is a must in my house.  I love this recipe but I followed the tips  given my the views by adding vanilla.  Instead of shortening I made it with half shortening and half butter. It works and my family can't get enough.

I love this recipe!!! When I made them though, I didn't role the balls into the sugar and cinnamon. I pressed a small cup into the cinnamon and sugar and then pressed it into the cookies.

Yummy! 
Just like Mom used to make.
Changes I made: no shortening, all unsalted butter; doubled baking soda; omitted salt; chilled overnight (ran out of time); baked exactly 8 minutes and immediately slid parchment paper and cookies on to cooling racks.

I used Kerrygold salted butter omitted the salt and shortening. They were PERFECT! I used a cookie scoop so we got 3 1/2 dozen out of the batch. This was our tenth year and tenth recipe for our annual cookiefest, I am so glad we finally found a keeper.

Also, I frosted one with some left over buttercream and OMG. BEST. COOKIE. EVER!

This was an easy recipe to follow and made a good cookie.  I left the first sheet in the oven a bit too long, even though they looked just right.  They came out crispy, which was ok, but I like a chewier cookie.  I just put a slice of bread in the container when I stored them and they came out a bit chewier.

I coated the dough balls in a mixture of 5 t cinnamon, 5 t brown sugar, 1/8 t of cardamom and a pinch of salt; might use white sugar mixed with brown, just to mix it up more easily. Butter-flavored shortening was fine, but might use real butter next time.

I made these, and they came out amazing! I only baked them for 8 minutes.  They came out perfect.  I will keep this Snickerdoodle recipe in my book, for the next time.

These are absolutely delicious.  I made a double recipe for about 45 middle school kids.  I'm so excited because I know they will love them. They turned out fantastic by following the recipe exactly as written.   No changes needed even at high altitude (8500 ft).  That is often a challenge, but not with this recipe.  Thank you!

THANK YOU for this recipe. I have made this countless number of times and it's always a hit! Especially at the office or with my family. I use crisco butter flavor sticks. I also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla when I add the eggs. Otherwise, fantastic snickerdoodle!

My husbands favorite cookie. First year I ever made it. Had to make 4 batches he and everyone that had them couldn't stop eating them. I was told they were the softest snickerdoodles anyone ever tatsed. Will make every year now!

Great recipe! I only gave 4 stars because to make this perfect I think butter AND shortening is needed. 1/2 cup of each creamed with the sugar. No additional changes. Perfection!

My daughter ended up making snicker doodle balls because the recipe doesn't say to flatten the balls before baking & she had never made them before. And they tasted flat. Not sweet at all.

I used butter flavored shortening, otherwise followed exactly, with time adjustment for my oven.  Ended up with lightly rounded cookies with attractive cracks in the surface, crisp on the outside, soft and chewy inside.  Perfect recipe.

Perfect recipe . I always use this recipe and never fail. It is easy and the cookies come out perfect . Just don't overtake . If you set the temperature and time as the recipe said, the texture will be chewy inside and crispy outside.

I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead of the one cup shortening. They still came out delicious with a richer flavor. My husband loves these and requests them frequently.

A few changes to accommodate my needs: 1. Substituted 1T baking powder and 1/2 t baking soda for the cream of tartar and soda listed in the recipe. 2. Added about a T real maple syrup. 3. I have a teeny tiny oven and dark cookie sheets, so I turned the temp down to 350, baked the cookies for 8 minutes, then opened the door (turned the oven off) and let them sit for a few minutes more (I was only making one pan... The rest of the dough went in the fridge for a later time). They were wonderful!!!! A little crunchy around the edges, chewy on the inside - hum-yum!!

This recipe is awesome, I didn't have Cream of Tartar so I omitted the baking soda and used baking powder in place of both.  They came out perfect.  Soft and chewy, very tasty.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for using half butter and half Crisco and adding 1 tsp of vanilla as others had suggested. I baked for 8 minutes exactly and they came out perfectly.

This recipe is okay but really dry. Add one more egg and it is perfect after that. If you have cavities be careful! I had one and now my tooth hurts.

After years of baking cookies for Christmas, I vowed never again to make snickerdoodles.  Year after year they were the biggest disappointment.  I bake 1000's of cookies for family, and these always defeated me!  NOT ANY  MORE!  Thank you Amy for posting this recipe.  These cookies turned out perfect.  The only thing I did different was added vanilla and cut out the salt. The texture is very pleasing, and the ease of the recipe is wonderful.  I doubled the recipe in a leap of faith and I am happy to add these to my cookie bar on Christmas Eve!

These cookies were OK, but they tasted a little raw when I cooked them for 9 minutes. I lowered the temperature and cooked it for 1 more minute, but they burned. I had to make double the dough.

These snickerdoodles are a family favorite!

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and put the balls of dough in a plastic baggie w/the cinnamon and sugar, then shook to coat. They turned out perfect! I made these twice, and both times, they went like hotcakes!

They looked great but they were way too salty and tasted more like shortbread than snicker doodles. Not impressed :(

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now and the first time I did it as instructed and it was wonderful but the second time I creamed the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening 
and sugars then added the vanilla and egg. And I think the biggist difference is that once both eggs were added I mixed it on high until a stiff mousse was formed them gentaly folded in all the sifted drys. I then refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours (covered) then bake.They turn out to be the softest, with just a hint of chewy

These cookies turned out perfect! I made these for my family at Christmas & they loved them. The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco shortening. I also made the dough ahead & chilled it for almost 24 hours. These cookies turned out soft & with the perfect chewiness & yet had a slight crispness on the outside.

I made these today and they are terrific!  I put the dough balls, rolled in the cinnamon and sugar, into the fridge for about 15 minutes before I baked them.  They turned out rounder and thicker than the first batch I made.  They are tasty, soft and wonderful.

The  cookies were good, but the dough was a pain!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was extremely sticky.           I thought I did something wrong. I read another review that had the same issue. The only solution I was able to come up with was hers-wet your hands.  We loved these, but I won't be making them again.  (If you put the dough in the fridge, then the cinnamon/sugar combo doesn't stick as well.  Same with putting flour on your hands.)

Made these cookies and loved them. I did make a few changes thought. I used salted butter instead of shortening, omitted the 1/2 tsp of salt and added a teaspoon of vanilla. They were delicious and once the kids got ahold of them I had to make another batch. I will be using this recipe again.

Great recipe, I did change a few things, I doubled the baking soda and didn't use the cream of tartar, personally I don't like the flavor of it. I put the sugar and cinnamon in a plastic baggy to help roll the cookie balls easier, I did also put about a tablespoon more of sugar to help balance the amount of cinnamon. I only left the cookies in the oven for 8 minutes exactly, took them out immediately and placed on a rack, they will look undercooked but they're not.

Not too good.  My friend and I used Splenda in place of the sugar. Plus we used vegetable shortening- were we supposed to use butter-flavored? Thanks anyway,Amy. 
And thanks for having an easy username to spell:)

Very good recipe. I did add a bit more flour (1/2 C) as I like a firmer cookie. Kids and hubby are already requesting them again!

Best and easiest snickerdoodle recipe I've ever made!  Delicious!  Only one change instead of plain shortening used butter flavored crisco instead.  Still perfect!

Excellent and very easy.  Each kid had their "station" in the cookie making - scooping, rolling, rolling in the sugar/cinamon, and placing on the pan.  We'll be making these again!

loved it! i made changes like the other reviewers made .. like no salt ...and i didn't have a lot of butter so i did half cup  butter and half cup oil.  and i used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cup white sugar. it came out great except i had to cook it a little longer because i rolled them too BIG!! i know better next time :) it is very important to follow the way to mix them .. it was really awesome overall .. definatly a keeper :)

Mine we're a little flat even after I added extra flour. I'm looking for one like I get at our local cookie shop. They are big and soft like a big soft sugar cookie with spices.

This cookie is bland as is. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It would definitely have benefited from some almond and vanilla extract.

These turned out PERFECT.  With a few alterations.  I rarely ever bake right from a recipe.  I used salted butter instead of shortening.  I also put a little extra cinnamon into the dough.  I also added some nutmeg to the dough as well as the sugar coating.  I baked them for 13min.  DELICIOUS.

I love this recipe. I did change it a bit though. I use butter instead of shortening and put the cinnamon right in the cookie at Christmas time. Then I roll the cookie in coarse red, green and white sugar for a pretty effect! I can't make them fast enough!!

These are delicious, but different shape from what I think of as a "traditional" snickerdoodle.  The texture is a little more dense, not allowing them to widen and flatten out while baking.  I tried flattening them out myself before baking, but the dough just crumbled when I did.  No matter what shape you're expecting, the taste is perfect!

Good, but I think that I will take the other's advise and do butter instead of shortening next time....or maybe not add as much cream of tarter.

I thought that these were fabulous; nice and chewy and moist. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I omitted the baking soda and just used baking powder, and they turned out great.

I made these snickerdoodles because they used shortening and I didn't have time to soften butter.  These are certainly very good cookies.  I used my smallest scoop and got 5 dozen cookies that were about 2.5 inches across.  They were lovely, small cookies.  This was an easy recipe and very much worth making again.  I increased the sugar-cinnamon to accommodate more cookies, adding a little extra cinnamon to ensure the color and taste contrast.

Great cookies!  Instead of all shortening, I did 1/2 C shortening and 1/2 C butter, with a 1/4 tsp vanilla.  Cakey and perfect.  Tip: chill the dough a bit before trying to roll them in the cinnamon and sugar so they hold together.  They didn't last long at the office or a dinner party I brought them, too!  Always a good sign!

Delicious!  I used 2 tsp baking powder in place of baking soda and cream of tarter (dont like the after-taste). I also used butter flavored shortening. Cooked for 14 minutes on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. They turned out nice and soft, just how I like them.

Excellent Snickerdoodle recipe! I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter instead of shortening. Next time I think I'll add a tsp. vanilla, too. Thanks for sharing this!

This is the first time I've ever made Snickerdoodles and they turned out great!  I used 1/2 C shortning and 1/2 C butter.  I made them for my sister, because they are her favorite cookie.  They quickly became a favorite of my kids and was one of the first cookie gone from the selection I made.  They are still soft days later.  This will be a favorite cookie recipe of mine.  Thanks.

Great recipe and super easy.  However, I use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening  instead of all shortening.  It gives the cookies a heavenly buttery taste.

I read some reviews first, and also made some slight modifications.
I used 1/2 C. Butter Flavored Shortening and 1/2 C. Coconut Oil. (YUM!) I added 1 tsp of vanilla, used 3 C. Flour, and did not add the salt. Everyone RAVED about these! Very moist and delicious!!

I've only ever used the Better Homes & Gardens recipe for snickerdoodles, and from what I remember, these are much better.  They are soft and chewy from the oven, but end up crispy.  I like to flattened them slightly before cooking as others suggested, too.  I used butter flavored shortening.  I also had to cook these for 12-14 minutes before they were even set.

This recipe was perfect!  I was looking for a snickerdoodle recipe like the ones I ate as a kid and this was it.  They were crisp on the edges and chewy on the inside.  I did add just a splash of vanilla and subbed a half stick of butter I had left over in the fridge for some of the shorting.  Even without my small changes I would still give it five stars.  Hubby and kids loved them.

Yes, many Snickerdoodle recipes are essentially alike, but it's hard to beat this one for its ease of preparation and a no-butter formula. Outstanding.

These were exceptional cookies. My family loved them - we should have doubled the batch!  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead of the 1 cup shortening. I also pressed the cookie with the bottom of a glass and only baked for 6 minutes. Big soft cookies with crispy edges - Awesome!

I tired a few other snickerdoodle recipes before finding this one. And none of them came close to how great this one is! I used margarine instead of shortening and they still turned out awesome. They are soft in and fluffy yet still true to a classic snickerdoodle. My husband raved about them for days.

Was hoping for a really soft cookie, but mine turned hard. They baked beautifully in the oven but then flattened out and went hard when removed.

Very good, although they didn't flatten out much. I was trying 4-5 different recipes (not all snickerdoodle) for a cookie exchange and this wasn't the winner but they were still good. I put a little extra vanilla in.

Yup, really good snickerdoodle cookies.  Our first batch turned out dough-y... I guess we undercooked them, so we added 4 minutes to the subsequent batches... viola, good!

good recipe!

These cookies were really good. I made these for a friend's birthday, and they turned out great. They were crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. The only things I did differently are that  I added a dash of nutmeg to the dough and that I baked them for 15 minutes instead of 10. I don't know if it's because I made the cookies larger, or what. Excellent recipe, however.

My son made these last night and now they are our favorite snickerdoodle recipe. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Very Good!

I followed this recipe to the T and the cookies came out great. All of my kids said they were the best snickerdoodle cookies they had tasted. They had a nice texture and tasted great. I will definitely be using this recipe again! Thanks Lucy!

These were great and my toddler loved to help "smoosh" them.  I might try another 1/2 t. of cream of tartar next time as I like that flavor in Snickerdoodles - but otherwise no changes!  Thanks!

Mine turned out very puffy and round; I used a fork to criss-cross flatten them immediately after baking and they were more attractive that way in my opinion.  Next time i will try using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as others have suggested to see if it helps to flatten the cookies out a little.  Very good recipe. Thank you Amy.

These were excellent! My kids ate them up that night as well as my husband and his friend. I've never tasted snickerdoodles before and I will make again. I thought it was just like a sugar cookie rolled in cinnamon and sugar! Either way, it was a hit in my house.
