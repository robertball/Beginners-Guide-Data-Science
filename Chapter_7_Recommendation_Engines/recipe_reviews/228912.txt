Just made this today, tasted great! Replaced vegetable oil with olive oil. Gingery flavour, but overall great dressing.

I tried this recipe and its really good. I made a few changes. Now I think it's perfect. Changes are: I added 1 cleaned raw carrot, cilantro instead of celery, 2T sugar, 1/4 c. sesame oil, and 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1/4 c sesame seeds. I put all ingredients in blender until smooth. Refrigerate.

I found a similar recipe on a different site and decided to do a combo of the two. For the oil I used peanut oil instead of the vegetable oil and I used lemon juice instead of lime. I did not make as written so it is hard for me to rate this recipe but the one thing I think this recipe is missing is vinegar. I replaced some of the soy sauce with rice vinegar and it came out spot on to what is served at our favorite Japanese Steakhouse.

I'm always nervous to try a recipe with so few reviews, but i had company over and gave it a shot. Perfect! I didn't have fresh ginger so used powdered and reduced oil to 1/3 cup. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. An absolute hit. I'm making it again for a luncheon tomorrow. Highly recommend if you like the hibachi-restaurant favorite!

Great recipe.  It tastes just like the dressing at a Japanese restaurant.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added two tablespoons of rice vinegar.

This has a nice, fresh flavor. Like some others, I reduce the oil to about 1/3 C and I added a drizzle of sesame oil. I also added a chopped up carrot to the mix in the blender. You don't really notice the taste of the carrot, but it bulks out the dressing with some body. And, hey, more veggies = good, right?

LOVE THIS!  We have tried with little success to replicate the yummy ginger dressing at one of our favorite Japanese restaurants. This came pretty darn close and has become one of our regular salad dressings.

Tastes just like the dressing from the Japanese restaurant down the street!!! I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil for healthier purposes. Also I just dumped everything in the processor all at once.

Delicious!  My husband has been searching for this 'restaurant style' flavored recipe. (I've thrown a lot of bottles out in the process).  :)  I made it as directed, a little less onion and 1 Tablespoon of ground ginger because I didn't have fresh.  I added a few dashes of sesame oil.   We loved it!  Will make it again and again!

very good and easy to make, I swapped sesame oil for vegetable oil. it adds a nutty flavor, so stick with vegetable oil if you want it to be exactly like a restaurant

I LOVE THIS DRESSING!!  This has got to be some of the best salad dressing I have ever made!  I was kind of bummed that I was going to have to wash my blender just for a salad dressing, but totally worth it.  Can't wait to have another salad for lunch tomorrow :)
