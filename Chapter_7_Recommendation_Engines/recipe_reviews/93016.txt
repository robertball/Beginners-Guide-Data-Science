I didn't think cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup sounded very good (we like things a little spicy here), so I used Campbell's Southwest Style Peppar Jack Cheese soup instead. Also added more cheese (of course)! this was delicious and a quick turn on regular frozen burritos

This was excellent!  I put a twist on the sauce...I put cream of chicken soup, green chilis, jalepenos, the juice of two limes & a little sour cream in a blender.  Blended until smooth, then poured over the burritos & topped with the cheese.  Soooo goooood!

Instead of a can of condensed soup I like to use one or two cans of "chili beans" (the seasoned kind) and a cup of sour cream as what holds the casserole together. You can add any kind of extras that sound good, I like the sliced black olives. It also works to cut the burritos into thirds and just stir together insead of layering. Great for potlucks, which it is best for me to make it for because otherwise I can't stop at one helping of this comforting dish!

Awesome recipe! My husband was skeptical when he heard the name but LOVED it and said to give it 5 stars or a 9/10. Made some changes to the recipe though - doubled the sauce recipe; used 7oz green chiles, 2 cans mushroom soup, 1c lite sour cream, added a can of corn and 2 chicken breasts cut up and sauteed in olive oil w/garlic. Fabulous!

I was looking for something quick and easy and found this.  It goes together in just minutes thus the four stars.  As for flavor this was just ok.  I might fix again when I need something real quick.

I thought this was great. I only switched the cream of chicken soup for southwestern pepper jack soup because my family likes it spicy. Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

I thought this would be a great quick meal for the family but it was so disappointing. The sauce was bland and even with the added toppings of tomato and olive the overall effect was lacking. My toddler who eats just about anything wouldn't eat it. My husband who will humor me in anything I try to make asked me not to make it again (not that I would want to).

This is a great quick recipe for nights when you don't want to cook. there's so many ways to make it. I usually use cream of onion with it and I will make it with different types of frozen burritos. I too keep frozen burritos in my freezer to make it any time.  My husband loves it. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and delicious use for frozen burritos. 
Had some leftover chopped chicken that I added to recipe the second time I made it, just as delicious. Thanks for a definite keeper in my recipe box.

excellent dish on a budget. However, I agree with another reviewer who said that they would use a jalepeno bean burrito versus just plain bean and cheese. it would add more depth of flavor to the dish.

Awesomess! Made a few adjustments by not using the cream of chicken soup at all but using cheese soup and nacho cheese sauce. My picky hubby and my teen girl both loved and fought over the leftovers.

This was easy and did well in a pinch.  It had good flavor, but it really was just frozen burritos w/stuff on top.

This is amazing!  It was quick and delicious.  I did add one thing though in the sauce I add a packet of taco seasoning.  I definitely will be making this again and again.

Fast and yummy! I've made this a few time and I now keep burritos in the freezer so I can make this on nights when I need a fast meal. I used bean and cheese burritos, cream of chicken and put some of the cheese in the soup mixture, then topped with extra cheese. Takes 5 minutes max to get it in the oven.

I love this recipe! What's wrong with having an easy dinner to pull together on one of those nights when you don't feel like cooking? I think this is a great recipe! We changed most of the recipe to suit our taste buds (we LOVE cheese), so instead of cream of mushroom, I used cheddar cheese soup, put the sour cream on the side, added drained rotel tomatoes, cilantro, and onions to the cheddar cheese soup.  We changed it up quite a bit, but that's what I love about this recipe, you start with a base (burritos) and you can customize it to suit your tastes.  Loved this recipe, will definitely have the ingredients on hand in the event of a "dinner emergency" ;-)

What a great idea! This is probably the best thrown together recipe you will find. I made the sauce the same way I make my chicken enchilada sauce: one can cream of mushroom, one can green chilli, and one can green enchilada sauce. Very good, thanks for the idea!

I am giving this 4 stars because it is quick, economical and very easy to throw together!!  I'd give it about 3 1/2 stars for taste, as I save 4 and 5s for out of this world food.  This is good, but not worthy of 4 or 5 stars, IMHO.  I use Spicy Bean and Cheese chimichangas from Wal-Mart instead of the burritos.  I use the cream of chicken soup, sour cream, chilis and sharp cheddar cheese.  I use 2 cups of cheese and more sour cream than is called for, though I don't measure it.  I used a small amount of half and half to cut the thickness of the sauce that adding the extra cheese adds.  I do mix the cheese in with the sauce instead of adding it on top and this makes it oh-so-yummy!!  I think if I make it again I am going to try using pepper jack cheese instead or maybe a combo of pepper jack and the cheddar.  This is a great recipe for a busy night and is very filling.

This is an excellent, tasty receipe.  I tweaked it a bit by simmering ground beef seasoned with cumin, chili powder and paprika in water until the water has cooked down into a gravy.  I put this over the top of the burritos before adding the rest.  Yummie!

Definately easy and one you can change up whenever you want to.  I used the campbell's nacho cheese (had it on hand and thought, why not).  I also added more cheese to the top than the recipe called for.  My son and hubby liked it.  I do think it ended up a little dry like another reviwer said, so next time I will try it with the chimichangas like they suggested.  Thanks for the post.

Followed recipe exactly and packed it up with some other mexican dishes for college daughter to take to campus for their "TV night".  Funny thing is, this was the favorite dish and it is ridiculously easy. I will definitely make again.

This is a great tasting and economical casserole.  I use chili beans combining the "spicy" beans with regular beans so it gives a kick but not too much for those who don't like spicy food.  I also "decorate" casserole by adding dip sized Frito's all around the edge before cooking. The kids love it!!  I give it 5 stars because of the ease of preparation and low cost.

I tried the nacho cheese soup as some other reviewers suggested…and we did not care for this at all. It was edible (which is why I gave it two stars) but I’ll never bother with this one again.

Easy, fast and tasty.  Even my 4 year old liked this.  (I left out the green chiles on her portion.)  Will definitely make again.  I highly recommend topping with additional sour cream, olives, avocado and tomato.  The recipe says optional but it really makes it great.

Good.  Not amazing but super easy and enjoyable.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.

Good and easy recipe.  Several of my friends are now using recipe as well. I use Cream of Chicken Soup and increase the sour cream to a full cup.  Finally I mix in a can of chicken with the soup and sour cream before I pour over the burritos.  Add a salad and we have a quick and easy meal. Of note, I did try this recipe using Cream of Mushroom Soup and a pound of browned ground beef but prefer the chicken.

Only giving 4 stars because I did not make exactly as recipe states. I do NOT like sour cream so instead I used a can of feista nacho cheese sauce mixed in with some salsa. It came out sooo good. They did not even taste like frozen burritos. Will definitely be making these again!!

I made my own cream of chicken soup for this recipe and it turned out great! White roux base: 2tbs butter, approx 4tbsp flour, 2cups milk, chicken boullion, s&p to taste, a few pickled jalapeno slices w/ 1tsp of pickling juice.  Covered it with cheese, too.  Oh, baby.

This dish is incredible! It makes hose dry frozen burritos moist and covered with a tastey sauce.I used a spicey cheese chip dip as well as half the can of the of the chicken soup and sour cream. It made it a lot more mexicany and spicey. I also mixed 2 cups of cheddar cheese in the sauce rather than just on the top. It's quick, fabulous, and super easy! i loved it!

So easy and so tasty.  I had to cook mine longer as they were still cool after 30 minutes but you can't find a simpler recipe that tastes this good.  I added the salsa right into the soup/sour cream mixture and used beef/bean burritos.  Delish!

Great meal. I sauteed half of an onion in oil, sprinkled with garlic powder and added two cans of cream of chicken soup, skipping the sour cream. I then placed cheese in mix and stirred just enough to combine ingredients before pouring mixture over burritos. With salsa it was tasty!

I have made this a few times now. I have made it according the recipe and it's good not to mention easy. Great if your in a pinch. Our fave way to eat this is to mix sour cream with a can of enchilada sauce instead of soup, then mix in some diced onion- spread it on the burritos and add extra cheese and toppings. I have kids so we have to keep it mild but on my plate I eat it with jalapenos. Yummmm! The only bad thing about this is that the sour cream looks kind of curdled when you cook but it tastes amazing. Thanks for this recipe.

I have made this recipe several times now.  This is a real time saver recipe even for large groups.  I've made two pans at the same time...one pan with chicken chimmies and the white sauce, and one pan with beef chimmies and a red picante sauce.  Quick spanish rice, and a salad on the side and you have a fun, colorful, TASTY meal.

So easy and delicious - of my favorite recipes.  I use extra cheese and sour cream to make it really creamy, and use a pepper jack or similar cheese to add a little more spice.

I made only 4 burritos and covered them with one can of vegetarian chili instead of the soup, and covered with cheese. This was really quick and easy to make and turned out to be really good.

I just made this last night for my family and it was so good my husband took the little leftover we had to work this morning for his lunch. I was a bit worried about how the Cream of Chicken would do but I used it and loved it!! We also like our food a bit spicy so I added salsa which gave it a bit of a kick and it just turned out very good. The only other change I did was I used a 4 cheese Mexican cheese. I will be making this again in the future.

This was so easy to make.  I also did not expect this to taste so good,but it was very yummy. I actually used cheddar cheese soup instead to the other two suggested because I do not like those. This is a great quick weeknight meal.

This was really tasty.  The 9x13 pan was too big though, I put it in a 8x12 pan instead.  I used cream of mushroom soup but I added some chicken boullion granules to it.  This was very simple and quick to make, we will be making this again.

I was pleasantly suprised this recipe, it looks too simple to be so YUM!  My family absolutely LOVED it!  I made a few changes based on ingredients I had on hand - mixed one can cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken, sprinkled sliced black olives on with the cheese.  I served it with Mexican rice and sweet corn, it was a great meal.  I will make sure to always have these ingredients in my freezer and pantry - this was a super easy and quick recipe and was absolutely delicious!

This was very good.  I did make some changes so I still give it 5 stars..the recipe is easy and quick to make.  I used frozen chimichangas, I added chopped onion and chopped bell pepper too on top of the cheese. also added some salsa to the top of the cheese.  when it baked the salsa stiffened up and the additions were great.  Next time I will add the onion and bellpeppers in with the soup mix.  I bought MILD green chiles, they were great.  I don't like very spicy.  this was perfect.  I always make a recipe my own and  if it doesn't turn out I still give a good rating if the basic recipe is a good one.  It isn't the one who submitted the recipe who messed the recipe up..I DID.  usually the extras are good.  I definitely will make this again and try cheese soup or something.

This is neither a bean burrito or casserole.  This is an expensive way to create a sloppy soup of frozen burrito.
With so many ingredients (7 plus the burritos), I may as well create  some enchiladas from scratch for a better food experience.  
The excess ingredients would be: meat, tortillas, and beans.  Unused would be the soup???, tomatoes, green chiles(these might be optional).  
If you are a new cook why not just do the basics: pre-baked Frozen burritos, 1 small can of enchilada sauce, some olives and cheese for a top, and maybe a bit of sour cream as garnish.

Super simple. I used beef and bean and bean and cheese burritos, alternating them in the pan and also cooked it with the olives on top of the cheese. My kids and my husband really liked it :)

I'm not a big fan of any burritos but everyone else loved this.  It's really easy to throw together for a last minute meal.

This is my families new favorite.  I try to always have homemade burritos in the house, and now this is a great way to use them for a quick meal. I make my own pinto beans, so they have cilantro and garlic in them, that helped boost the flavor of this dish.  I was not sure the cream of mushroom soup would taste good with this recipe, but with the cheese added...it was very good and creamy.  Thank you for this recipe.  We loved it!!

I love this recipe.  So easy for a night after a long day at work.  I use fiesta cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken or mushroom which makes it extra cheesy and zesty.  Leftovers keep well too!

I had high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately, cannot recommend it and my review keeps getting edited. Not trying to be mean, only honest. The frozen burritos combined with canned soups made for a very unappetizing combination.

I didn't care for the sauce at all, but the recipe gave me some ideas on things I might try in the future. It was sure quick and easy to prepare - but my guess is that it's a personal taste thing.

I am rating this 2 for the easiness of it. I made this recipe based on the reviews of people who actually followed the recipe, and there were many who loved it. I followed the recipe, and will not make it again. I absolutely love bean burritos of all kinds and thought this would be a great change of pace. Very disappointed. I did not care for the combination of flavors.

This was very good for being so basic and easy.  Sometimes the basic things are the best!  I generally like to make things truly homemade (In other words I don't typically buy things like frozen burritos)  But things like this are nice to have on hand sometimes for convenience.  I think it would be better if the burritos were cooked some first (fried or baked) to crisp them up a bit before adding the sauce and baking.  I will try doing that the next time I make these.

This was a great quick recipe- very tasty, too. I cut each burrito into three pieces and then placed the smaller pieces into rows. I blended together the sour cream, soup, and peppers (and added fresh jalapenos to the mixture) and poured it over the burrito pieces. Yum.

I loved this recipe! So quick and easy! I used bean and beef burritos and used Fiesta Chedder cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken. I also mixed in some shredded cheddar cheese in with the sauce and put the rest over top. Very good, will make again!

I loved this recipe, my husband thought I was a little crazy...asked where I get the crazy recipes from.  But yet he went and got seconds so obviously it wasn't so crazy after all.  My daughter also had seconds...this is a keeper.  I think next time I will add some shredded lettuce on top with the salsa, tomatoes, avocados and olives. Yum.

This is excellent for a quick, throw together recipe! It is great as written or it also lends itself to changing up for lots of variety.  For those of you that are turned off by the cream of mushroom or chicken soup and sour cream mixture try adding a 1-2 tablespoons of cumin to the mix.  You can also forget the sour cream and soup mixture completely, and just top with canned enchilada sauce for a quick "pan burrito" recipe.  Hormel no bean chili mixed with the sour cream and canned chili peppers also works well.  I have also made this with the other variety of burritos (beef and beans etc). Enjoy!!

This was an excellent, tasty, economical recipe. It was huge hit with my family. The only thing I changed was to use Nacho Cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken and used more cheese. Also added some jalapeno peppers to half for my hubby who likes the hot stuff. I will definitely be making this again!

I used frozen beef, bean, and cheese chimichangas instead of the burritos because that is what I had on had....and WoW was it delicious. To make them crispy , I baked the chimis first for and heated the sauce on the stove for about 10 min. Then put the sauce over and baked. Boyfriend loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

I'll admit I was very skeptical about the ingredients in this casserole. I just wasn't sure how it would taste. I am happy to report that it is actually quite good...most importantly my teenage boys every scrap of it whenever I make it. It's been a big hit in my house and is the perfect thing to make when I'm short on time.

Uggs, what a waste of food! It was such an awful blend of items...I think the whole CREAM OF CHICKEN/MUSHROOM soup thing ruined it! No flavor at all, had to add own spices to save it ( garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, hot sauce!) and it still was a disaster!...I dunno, maybe it's just me...I love AUTHENTIC Mexi food so maybe I shouldn't have even tried this one!!

This was okay.  I baked this for 30 minutes and still did not think it was warm enough.  I even let the burritos thraw a bit before making.  We put sour cream and taco sauce on this.  For a hungry crowd of teenage boys this would work just fine

This is so easy and tasted great. My husband went back for thirds and cleared his plate every time, my 2 year old loved it as well. As usual I prepped this ahead of time, I made the soup/sour cream/chile mixture earlier in the day then spread it over the frozen burritos. Not that it isn't easy enough! The only thing is I cooked it for 30 minutes and it was not that hot, maybe I was supposed to defrost the burritos first?

This was WONDERFUL!  Even my 3 year old ate ever scrap!  It would have gotten 5 stars but we chose to do it with cheese soup as opposed to the cream of mushroom as well.

Thank you!

This was fine and an easy, quick and cheap meal to fix on a weeknight.  My husband ate it & said I could make it again.  We added sliced black olives to our sauce mix & I threw some hot sauce in it for flavor.

I love making it with the extra sauce and serving it over rice, also- adding canned corn kernels is really yummy.

What a neat way to come up with something so easy and different. I left off the avocado and olives and added onions instead. So easy to do what you want with this. In a huppy the microwave works well also. THANKS!

I absolutely loved this dish because it was so quick and easy! I sprinkled some sliced black olives, green onions, and fresh sliced tomato on top, which made it appealing and added some extra flavor!
My grandfather ate 3 servings before we had to stop him!!!

I went to a casserole party and took this, it was fun, super easy and everyone liked it.  However, i'm sure i won't make it again.  I'd rather just have the bean burrito with some extra cheese.

You could not ask for an easier dinner for a crowd! I did add garlic and cumin to the cream mixture, but that's what's so great about this recipe - you can make it to suit your tastes! If you want to spice it up a bit, try hot diced green chiles versus mild.  If you don't like cream of mushroom, use cream of chicken. So many options with this recipe, thanks!!!

I used a smaller casserole dish and just three burritos.  But I ended up using the full recipe sauce mix, half a can of soup wasn't enough.  In the end, it was DELICIOUS!  I made guacamole instead of just using avacados, but really you could use any of your favorite taco toppings.

Kids loved it, husband loved it - I thought it was fantastic! I only altered it slightly - I added the olives to the mix that is spread over the burritos and increased the amount of cheese I sprinkled on top. It's GREAT - will definitely make again!
