SO good, we serve this along with the sweet & spicy sauce with cold spring rolls and it's delicious. You can use smooth low-sugar peanut butter as well, which just makes it a little sweeter. Yum!

I love this!  I add just a touch more coconut milk (like 1/2 TBSP) and that seems to give it just the right amount of sweetness

Super tasty recipe! I did add a little more of everything besides the PB along with a few pinches of curry powder which added a little pizazz! Super easy as well.

Great keto recipe with steamed veggies and tofu. 

I added a bit of rice vinegar, ginger and stevia and it was much better. A little bland to me if you just follow the recipe.

Very nice, quick and easy. I had to add a scant teaspoon of grated ginger to give it a little lift, but otherwise it was a great dipping sauce for our vegan spring rolls.

This came out perfect. The only change I made was crushing the garlic clove and adding a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

SO good.  My 11-year-old son is addicted to this sauce - I made a double batch and have it in a squeeze bottle for easy dispensing.  It's definitely a "make-ahead" sauce though.  It needs time for the flavors to fully marry

Good base,  I added a few drops of sesame seed oil,  and ginger,  upped the coconut milk to 1/4 cup, and cook it on low.
Did need more water 1/2 , 1/4 cup at a time..

Made it just like the recipe was written, it didn't need too much hot water. I mixed it with coconut rice and it was fabulous!

This was the first peanut sauce I have ever tasted and thought it was just ok; tasting very little other than the peanut butter. I doubled the ingredients but not the peanut butter and thought it was better. Thank you for the recipe.

so easy and delicious. I did not have all the ingredients. I had to use red wine vinegar instead of soy sauce and chili powder instead of hot sauce. and it was still great. I bet it is even better if I had the correct ingredients

It was good, not the best, but good. We were happy with the results after I added ginger-in-a-tube, about 3 teaspoons or so and it gave it more favor. I will add more next time and we also used Chili Sauce to spice it up. I had also used chunky peanut butter as thats what the family loves and it was perfect for dipping in chicken. 

The con is that I would not use lime next time. I felt it was not needed and it made it a bit bitter.

Did not care much for this recipe. too bland and no notations of sweetness in the background, which I find in most restaurant peanut sauces. Would not pair with fresh summer rolls.
