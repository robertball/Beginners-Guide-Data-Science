This is a delicious way to prepare fish.  It ended up having a fair bit of sauce so I served it over rice.

I found this recipe and just love it. I've made it a few times now and each time it has been great. I've taken it into work for a potluck and it was a success. I used Halibut instead of catfish and just adjusted the cook time.

I really liked this recipe even though I kinda totally changed it up.  All the ingredients were the same, except I substituted powdered ginger for the fresh ginger, and along with the cayenne, it was VERY spicy...  So I added cream and milk to tone it down, so it came out creamy but very good.  And instead of baking it I threw in it a wok with chicken and fresh spinach, wtih fresh cilantro added at the end.  It worked out great considering I improvised last minute, but I will definitely do it again, so thanks Rina!

I was a skeptic when I made the marinade.  It smelled way too vinegar-y.  But I forged ahead because of the reviews and I'm so glad I did.  It mellows under the broiler and ends up being slightly sweet with that Indian twang.  Served with a curried cauliflower soup and naan.  Will absolutely make again.

Used Swai and left the fillets whole.  Cut back on the spices and it was still very flavorful.  Did not cut back on the garlic.  Served with Chardonnay, Indian green beans, rice, and nan.

Fixed this exactly as written and it was awesome. Maybe a little spicy, but that just made it more interesting. I am planning on using the leftovers for fish tacos. This will go into my Favorites folder. Thanks so much for the recipe

Fantastic! I used lemon juice instead of vinegar, but followed the recipe otherwise. This tandoori paste would be great on chicken too. It has a lot of heat.

Can't believe how simple but delicious this was. My picky seven year old asked for seconds and then for left overs the next day! I had to sub lemon for vinegar (did not have) and reduced the amount of cayenne a little. Will use half the amount next time and I also added 1/4t turmeric powder. I also had just 1 1/2lbs fish but made the same amount of marinade as the recipe stated. I saved the extra marinade and made a delicious curry sauce by adding some milk and coconut with a little flour to thicken. Served it over basmati rice and could not believe how great it tasted. I would have used coconut milk but did not have any. Will definitely be making this over and over again. And for the reviewer who said this was not a paste that is simply not true. You did not blend the ingredients long enough! Rina thank you so much for sharing.

I cut the cayenne pepper way back and added turmeric, thyme, and a 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt to the marinade. Instead of vinegar I used fresh lemon juice, and used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. I ended up cooking the fish on the stove but I definitely should have followed the recipe and broiled it. I bet it would be awesome grilled, too.

Amazing.  Made with Tilapia.  I don't eat meat,  only fish and vegatables.  This was a great way to get a tandoori fix.  I might try grilling this next time.

This dish was okay. The sauce that the recipe called for was not a paste. When reading recipe I wondered how can this become a paste. I was right liquid consistency not paste.

This was very good! Used cod fillets and only 1/2 tsp of cayenne since my familt has less tolerance for spice than I do. everything as is in the recipe, served on basmati rice with a roasted pepper/avocado salad.

Delicious! I subbed the vinegar for lemon juice, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and tilapia instead of catfish. I also used a scant tablespoon of the cayenne, but I'll add the full tablespoon next time since I love spicy! I served the fish over basmati rice with some naan on the side. A meal that both my husband and I really enjoyed!

I was really excited to try this recipe, it sounded perfect for my family.  We like big flavors and eat lots of fish, unfortunately we were disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception, I hand chopped the garlic and ginger instead of using a food processor to mix the paste.  Perhaps this would have made the difference so I am willing to give it one more try, but will probably end up changing it a bit.  The flavors really did not come through at all...  everyone at the table thought it was really bland, even the 5 year old :(

I made this as directed except that I only put 1/2 tablespoon of cayenne, and added 1/2 tablespoon of a tandoori seasoning mix I have. Also I had ground ginger instead of fresh. Marinated the fish overnight, broiled as suggested. VERY tasty! Will make this again.

I'm always looking for new ways to bake fish since my son loves it. This was easy to put together and so flavorful. It definitely did not have the tandoori flavor that I was expecting but nevertheless quite yummy.
I used half the oil which worked out fine. I also threw in some bell peppers while broiling; a subtle sweetness to compliment the spicy.

Made this with pike since it was the only fresh white fish that i could get. Turned out pretty good. I baked the fish but next time I will broil or grill it.

I made this for a dinner party for some Indian guests. I forgot about it, and thus had to cook it the next day. It was fabulous! To turn up the heat let it marinade longer. A truly great recipe that is forever in my in-box. Thanks Rina!

We love this recipe. My husband asks for it often. To save me some time I make the sauce and brush it over frozen fish fillets the night before and let it sit in the fridge till I'm ready to make dinner the next night. When I get home the whole pan goes in the oven. I serve it over rice with broccoli, yum.

Made this several times, with different types of fish, and it's really good every time. Thanks for posting!

I have made this about 20 times and we love it!  I do use lemon juice instead of vinegar and only a tsp of red pepper but this is fantastic!  Our favorite way to eat catfish.   Thank you sooooo much!

I can't say how easy and how good this was! Also, ALERT, my 3 year old asked for seconds of this fish! I will be making this again and again! Note: I did tone down the cayenne pepper to adjust for personal taste.

Very appetizing. I added kaffir leaves and a bit of tomatoes to it. Gives it a more exotic tangy taste.

All in all it was okay dish. I used a sea bream instead of halibut, and i added cream to thicken the sauce.  I would reduce the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup.. it was too sour to my taste.

this was very good.. we used tilapia in place of catfish and reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.. other than that followed the rest of the ingredients/amounts.. i think next time i'd double the salt and maybe add some more cayenne.. i was just worried it would be too spicy.. on a side note, i marinated the fish overnight.. ty for the recipe

Loved this recipe! I think I would keep everything the same with the sauce for the fish except I would actually add yogurt, was thinking about either plain or taking it up a notch with coconut flavored yogurt. I served this over a bed of white basmati  rice and a purple cabage salad.

My family can't get enough of this recipe.  My daughter even wants to lick the blender after I make the sauce. Marinating it is great, but if you don't have time, it still comes out yummy being cooked right away.

Very good!  I taste tested it.  Then added some Greek yogurt to the marinade after 3 hrs. To extend it.  I'm am adding some mushrooms to it.  And adding coconut milk to part of the rice, just to try it.  I had 6 large cat fish so needed more marinade.  Left out the cayenne because of allergies.  I'm sure my husband will love it!

This was soooo good. I used much less oil though, and a teeny bit less cayenne and it turned out great! Spicy, but not painfully so, and really good flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. Tasted hot but not good hot, just hot.  Otherwise flavorless.

Oh boy, this is YUMMY!! Must love heat, FYI. If not cut way back on the cayenne. This is one recipe I didn't mess with and It was great. I'm looking forward to the leftovers all ready!
We had the fish over brown rice with mango slices and a green salad. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!
Next time I think I might add some coconut milk...

yum! thanks. we are allergic to garlic, so i always substitute onions.  I was out of fresh onions and ginger, so I used dehydrated with a little warm water, and powdered ginger and also used 3/4 paprika and 1/4 pepper for the tender mouths in my house.  it was still great!  we can't have salt, and with these flavors it wasn't missed at all.
