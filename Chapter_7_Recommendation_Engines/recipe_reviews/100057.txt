Already a big Tilapia fan, I was just looking for something simple - last minute. This was IT! Added sliced mushrooms and lemon juice with the butter and capers, and felt like I should charge the family for a gourmet meal!. Will use this recipe (even just as is) again. Thanks.

Really, really good and easy.  Only thing changed was adding more capers.    I live 20 feet from the water and have fresh fish all the time, right off the hook. So I use whatever the fish of the day is.  It taste great every time.  Also if you like capers there is another great recipe on the site called "Caper Baked Chicken" it is quick and easy like this recipe.

YUMMMMMM!!!  I think I might have been inclined to give 5 stars- but mom and hubby said 4 (if it had been deep fried they both said- it would have been a 5-cholesterol junkies, the both of them!!).  This was delicious and EASY!  The only modification I made was to add more capers because we LOVE them!  I served this with steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes.  YUM!  Great meal!  Thank you!!!!!

This was REALLY good, not to mention quick and easy.  Adding a squeeze of lemon juice perked up the flavor of the finished sauce.  Thanks!

I am always trying to find a fish recipe that I want to eat, so I can eat a healthier diet. This recipe is simple, quick, elegant and tasty. I followed the recipe and served each filet on a piece of toasted potato bread. The bread soaks up some of the sauce and when eaten with the fish is a delight.

This was definitely very good and quick. I let the sauce cook down too much so next time I need to be careful about that. I will make this again.

I am not a huge fan of tilapia, but my husband is--he gave this 4 stars. He said the only problem he had was it was a bit salty. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce (capers, garlic, and wine)and added an add'l tablespoon of butter because we like a lot of sauce. I served over white rice and with breaded asparagus. It was quick and easy--will make again!

Awesome! I am not usually a big fan of capers but there didn't seem much point in making Tilapia with White Wine Caper Sauce & leaving out the capers. So I cut it down by half & went for it...I am so glad I did. The sauce was wonderful...& all the flavors complemented each other so well!! I used about a cup of pinot grigio & only 3 tilapia filets. Next time I think I will add the full amount of capers. Served this w/ Garlic Sauteed Artichokes (from this site), the pinot grigio  & for dessert, Muscat Jelly w/ blackberries (from food network site). Thanks Pam...I thoroughly enjoyed this one.

The Tilapia was easy and delicious. I squeezed lime juice over the fish before seasoning it and mixed a little bit of Old Bay seasoning in the flour. My husband loved the Tilapia, but we did not care for the caper sauce. I like all those ingredients but it just didn't taste right on this dish.

I used swordfish and added mushrooms and the garlic before adding the wine to reduce.  I squeezed a little lemon in the sauce the end.  This dish was good.

Thank you! Thank you! For this fantastic and easy recipe! I have never cooked fish and I made this dish for a person who knows her food inside and out. She Loved it! Asked me to make it again for her. Very easy to follow instructions with no complicated ingredients or procedures to make this fantastic dish!

Hubby said "MMM This is a definite keeper..."  Followed exactly - although I eyeballed everything.  Did add a little fresh lemon when serving.  Try it -you won't be disappointed.

Simple and delicious.  The capers add such a wonderful flavor, you really can't do without them on this one.  Served with rice and cheesy broccoli.

Wow. . . this was incredible.  Its mix of fairly simple ingredients produced a fish that was tender and flavorful, and the sauce was out of this world.  We talked about it for days afterwards.

This is one of the best fish recipes I have ever tasted. I served it with sauteed spinach and tomato and feta salad. I added lemon juice to the sauce because we drank the wine, but it was still awesome.

What a GREAT recipe! It is delicious and so so easy to make. One slight change I made was that I had purchased a container of Noel's cpaer butter, so i din't have to buy capers sepately -- no big deal, but the butter is excellent.

I used Dover Sole in this recipe, but otherwise made the caper suace the same.  My husband raved about it and I also thought it was delicious!  This was something I'd serve to company as well as fix for us again!!!

Delicious & easy...what more could you ask for? Next time I'll add more wine and maybe a little flour to thicken up the sauce. Great w/garlic mashed potatoes!
