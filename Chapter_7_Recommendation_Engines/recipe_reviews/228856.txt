A chef once told me to use only a few veggies while cooking. He was correct. Finely strain the vegetables from the liquid after cooking. Throw these veggies away keeping the liquid. The veggies have lost their unique favors after being cooked for several hours. From the strained liquid you can make a wonderful au jus with a couple tbls more wine. Our old friend Justin Wilson said never use a wine you would not drink. "An', you don't get dat at da grocery store, no." I use a good Marsala. Cook fresh veggies separately to serve with your meal.

With the exception of only using 4 meaty short ribs (because that is all that I had), we made this recipe exactly as it reads and we really enjoyed it.  It would have been even better with the 4 extra ribs that it calls for.  The flavor is delicious and our children who are under 4 devoured itâ€¦probably because of the french bread with cheese on the top:).  We do not have crocks, so I just broiled the bread topped with cheese and placed it on top of the soup bowls before serving.

This is a great soup! I cut it in half as I only had 3 short ribs.  Very flavorful. Will definitely make this again.

This was fabulous! Great taste all around. We took the ribs out and ate them on the side. I also cut the onions up more to make it easier to eat. Will make again!

turned out great, next time will mix regular onions along with the sweet onions.
