A good way to use up left over pumpkin puree. These cookies were huge. After baking for 10 minutes, the cookies I made were not fully baked. So, I baked them for 2 more minutes. The middle was still a little raw. So next time, I will bake these for perhaps 14 minutes. I also would add some vanilla extract and maybe some flour.

I didn't have brown sugar so I used coconut palm sugar and added half cup of raw pumpkin seeds in addition to the regular ingredients. They turned out great. If I followed the recipe I am sure it would have been just as good.

I decided to put, like half a teaspoon to a whole teaspoon of flour, in my batter to make it a tad-bit thicker. It helped a lot
