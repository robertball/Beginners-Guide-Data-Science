My grandmother made brasciole every Sunday with her "gravy", tomato sauce to most people... Brasciole can be made with pork, veal or beef but the key is whichever meat you use it has to be extremely thin otherwise it will be difficult to roll and may not get as tender as it should.  Brasciole is a versatile recipe as you can really play around with the stuffing ingredients, i.e different cheeses, capicola, my grandmother used to put hard boiled egg in hers (cheaper than pine nuts!!)

I made this for the Soprano's final episode party (which was disappointing) but the recipe was the hit of the party!

A couple of suggestions to make this easier and tastier:  mix the onion mixture with the bread crumb mixture and add enough EVOO to make it bind and then spread it on the meat.  I also used panko bread crumbs and Italian seasoning to give the stuffing more flavor.  I used toothpicks to keep them all together and they worked great. Add a little bit of red wine to the spaghetti sauce for flavor and use the crock pot for very tender meat.  I was in a hurry so I used the high setting for 5 hours and it came out perfect. I will definetly make this again!

Excellent! My only change will be the next time is to put a little more cheese and use italian parsley. I browned them and put in crockpot. Steak was very tender.

Okay, gotta admit, I would never have even heard of braciola if I hadn't seen Everybody Loves Raymond. So kudos to Debra for getting this to taste right, because it is quite a tricky recipe, but fantatsic when it's done.

It took some time to tenderize the meat and get the ingredients the way I needed them, but after rolling the meat and getting them simmering in the sauce, it's just a waiting game. I substituted dried cranberries for raisins, which were tart and sweet and my dad and sister's favorite parts of the inner stuffing. A wonderful Sunday meal to make with extra pasta I had lying around the kitchen.

I had a hard time getting this one together. It also got a little bit burned on the bottom (!). I'm going to attempt this again, because I like the idea and the flavors are nice...will update. Thanks for the recipe!

made this recipe exactly as is; it was superb. In my opinion, it does not need any tinkering. Our grass-fed beef really shone in this recipe. EVERYONE loved it - my husband, my kids (3 & 4), my parents, and my brother and sister-in-law. Sauce was so good the leftovers were kept and put on noodles for lunch the next day! Now THAT's a good recipe! Thanks for sharing!! It'll be appearing often on our dinner table.

This recipe was awesome. I used panko bread crumbs and dried cranberries instead of raisins. A lot of work, but worth the rave reviews.

This was good but a lot of work.  There were so many bread crumbs they fell out of the meat.  In my opinion this is company fare, not everyday eating.  It got mixed reviews at our house.  Basically a different type of spaghetti.

This turned out very good.  The mean fell apart... it was fork tender, I was very pleased.  I will use more cheese next time and more garlic... I found I couldn't really taste the stuffing.  But still a delicious meal.

What a pain in the neck! OK, so the meat could have been thinner, but I pounded and pounded. My piece of round steak was split up the middle, so when it came time to roll it up, there were crumbs falling out all over the place- the cutting board, the skillet...what a mess!  It was very difficult to handle. I hope the taste is worth all the trouble. It's in the crock pot now. I'll get back later with a final "thumbs up" or "-down". A year has passed since I wrote the first part.
I tried this for Christmas dinner again this year. This time I used smaller pieces of round steak instead of one large one. I think I got the hang of the roll and tie part- roll it tight and tie it tight. This is no place for a 'light' touch. Also, I think it could have simmered longer, since the rolls weren't as tender as I might have liked. A good recipe, the fault is mine for not cooking long enough.
I will make this again. Thumbs up!

Since I am Sicilian, I grew up on this. My mother's stuffing was a little different, (no raisins, I didn't like them)but the basic recipe is the same.  This is my husband's favorite, altho I don't make it that often because I have to make a lot and it's quite time consuming, esp. when making the sauce from scratch, which I do.  Thanks Anthony, I'm going to the store to get the ingredients today!  Made me hungry!

I've made this 3 times now and decided it is time to review it.  My family loves this but it is not something I would make everyday because it is time consuming.  I have found that the thinner you pound the steak the easier it is to roll and keep everything enclosed. This recipe is absolutely a keeper.

I really should taste it first. It is cooking right now. This rating is based on the clarity of the directions and the recipe itself, which I thought was very clear and well written. If I remember to, I will add to the review after my carb-induced coma (pasta AND garlic bread? really?) 
I also learned something - that 'grandma's house' smell? It's parsley and olive oil.

Great start.    I would not go through the expense of good meat and the work of brasciola and use a jarred sauce, though.  If you're going to make this, take the time to make a good sauce.  It's worth it.    I also think the steak needs to be a lot thinner than 1/2 inch....1/4 inch rolls well and cooks a lot more tender.    The flavor was there, though, and the filling is adaptable.  We prefer Parmesan to Romano and I was out of raisins so I used a mixed dried fruit blend.  Very easy to fit to your own family's tastes and preferences.  I also prefer to make several, smaller braciole (plural) rather than one large braciola (singular).    Thanks!

I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars.  It was ok, not as great as I thought it would be with all the work involded.  It was a different way to use round steak though.

This was one of my recipe experiments that didn't go over very well with my family. I thought it was probably 4 star, my husband said 2. I think making this, I should have pounded the meat more...most of it was tough, but I few bites were very, very tender and amazingly delicious! The pinenuts were expensive, I like the reviewer's suggestion about using chopped egg as a substitute. I, too, used my crock pot to make this. I wished my family had liked this more, I would experiment with different spices...but I probably won't make it again. Thanks for letting me try something different!

I made this recipe as given and it was good, but I felt like the filling could have had a little more flavor.  I may try Italian bread crumbs next time.  But it is good and the family liked it.

Don't use any meat but flank steak. Pound it thin otherwise you will hate yourself!

I like the Sicilian version with pine nuts/raisins over the Italian version. I also toast the bread crumbs with the onion/parsley/garlic/EVOO. Just cook the last ingredients and add the crumbs for the last  few minutes with a little extra EVOO.

One other ingredient I add is slices of boiled egg and up the prosciutto by about double. 

And use a very sharp knife when slicing (serrated works best).

filling needed more flavor, but a good basic recipe to start with.
