Scaled recipe back to 1 rack of ribs and I skipped the  sauce preparation due to personal preference. We prefer our sauce on the side. This method of smoking worked great for us and we've smoked a great deal of ribs. I wasn't sure about the vinegar/worcestershire combo but it kept the ribs nice and moist. This one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!
