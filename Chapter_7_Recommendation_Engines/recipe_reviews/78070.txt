RECIPE 3 stars, RESULTS 5 stars. I am giving this recipe 3 stars because I think that it is MUCH better with salted peanuts, and I think that it should be noted that it's very important to work quickly!  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, the caramels set very quickly after melting!  The juxtaposition of sweet caramel and salted peanuts is the key to good peanut brittle.  You can whip this recipe up in a snap, and it's delicous!  In a nutshell:  1. Use SALTED, ROASTED PEANUTS 2. Work fast!  I hope everyone enjoys this as much as we did!

So easy and a very yummy recipe.  My two-year-old could help me with this recipe versus the other method (heating over the stove all the different ingredients). I actually prefer the salted roasted peanuts- I like the sweet and salty flavor.

This was an okay peanut brittle. It's certainly easy enough, and I made it exactly as written.
I agree with the previous reviewer that salted peanuts would probably be better, or maybe just add some salt to this recipe. This doesn't make much - I coated the entire cookie sheet with cooking spray, and this recipe covered only maybe 1/4th of the sheet. Also, you have to work quickly after the caramels are melted - they harden quickly.

something went wrong and it was too thick and didn't really harden...just stayed sticky. 
EDIT:I stuck it outside for a bit (cold here) and it hardened and cracked :-) its still a bit sticky vs crunchy when you eat it though.

Knowing that the caramel can be sticky I used nonstick spray on the bowl and lightly sprayed parchment paper on the baking sheet and additionally sprayed the spatula. To speed up the cooling process I placed the brittle in the refrigerator and in a short time the brittle broke into pieces easily. The caramel flavors are there but this brittle can be tough on the teeth.

Great Recipe to make with Kids. I have a childcare and tried these to see how they would work for Christmas gifts. I had my kids unwrap the caramels and put them in a bowl. After heating , I added the nuts since it was hot. After cooling, the kids bagged it for gifts. I am sure the unsalted peanuts was a typo. Salted peanuts are always in Peanut Brittle. Thank you HoneyBeeMelissa. Not only did I save this recipe, I printed it for my cookbook!

This was very easy to make and very good to eat but be careful I had to visit the dentist after eating a few, pulled out and cracked some fillings!
