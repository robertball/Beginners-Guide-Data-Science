Not bad.  I used the 1.5lb loaf, white bread setting in my machine (that's the smallest loaf it makes).  I decided to chop some extra strawberries and put them in when the machine beeped (at the point when raisins can be added for raisin bread).  Had to add about another 1/2 cup of flour at that time... kept playing and adjusting, but it worked out just fine.  Still no pronounced strawberry flavour, but it is a cute pink colour.  It would make nice french toast.

This is one of the softest breads I have tried!
It's great just putting butter & honey on and eating as a quick snack.
The strawberry flavor isn't very strong, but it is very very good.
Definitely a keeper!

Not a very strong strawberry taste, but overall a very good bread.

The ingredients sounded so good, but the results were disappointing. Couldn't taste the strawberries at all. And mashing the strawberries was much more difficult than I would have expected. I thought the cream cheese was completely undetectible.

Great idea... needs a little work to be a great breadmaker recipe.  I doulbed the strawberries, added 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup oats plus an extra 1/2 tsp of yeast.  Still a VERY small loaf. Might be too heavy for the breadmaker, but great for an oven bread. Super yummy with the strawberries!

You don't taste the strawberries in this bread much, so you may want another recipe if that's your objective.  On the other hand, if you want a bread that tastes like cream cheese, this bread does.  I halved the recipe and then had to add in a lot more flour.  I ended up adding about 3 cups but the dough was still pretty sticky anyway.  It baked up nice--be careful with the rising.  I thought it would be fine and it went over the pan a bit after baking.  But aside from the funny lopsideness of the bread, it looks good.  This  bread isn't too sweet at all, and would work as a hearty sandwich loaf because of that.  I like it, but just needs more flour--I say that bc just glancing at the ratios it didn't look right at all.  Adding a cup or two more of flour is essential, otherwise it's good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had good luck with this recipe, except that I, too, had to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to it, to make it stiff enough.  It came out nice and fluffy.  I think I will add additional strawberries next time, so as to add a bit more of their flavor to it.  I love to make breads in my bread maker, but had found few recipes until now!  I look forward to making this bread and many others in the future!

Didn't like it at all.  Strawberries just don't cook well and the cream cheese melted into the dough and I couldn't taste it.

I thought this was just so so.  It was moist and a pretty color but the flavor just was not there.  I even added more strawberries and still could not taste them to much.

Flavor is good, but the bread is very heavy.  Best when toasted.

I couldn't find any strawberry flavoring, anyone know where to find it? So in place of it... I used strawberry cheese in the recipe and it turned out perfect.

I had it in for a 1.5 lb cycle, but I added too many strawberries and had to add in too much flour as a result, so it didn't bake through all the way.  I let it sit in the bread machine for an extra half hour or so, so it turned out fine.  I made a strawberry dipping sauce for it and everyone loved it.  Next time I'll put it in for a longer cycle if I get over-zealous with the strawberries.  Definitely making this recipe again.

Had to do this twice, before it worked. I used blueberries as someone had suggested and added them as the dough was mixing then added cream cheese when add beeper went off and this work much better than putting all in at once. I also added 1/2 cup of flour and used 1 cup of milk since blueberries are not as juicey as strawberries. Can not taste berries or cream cheese, but this bread has a wonderful light texture and very good flavor.
