Breakfast burritos are awesome and pretty much contain every food group!  They can be made ahead of time and are perfect for on the go.  I cut the recipe way back because I didn't need quite that many and made my own taco seasoning.  I added some crumbed bacon and diced green pepper plus a mix of cheddar and jack cheeses. You can add pretty much anything you want or have on hand because once you combine meat, scrambled eggs and cheese in a warm tortilla it's bound to be good.  All you need is a side of salsa, sour cream, a little tabaso or cholula and you're in breakfast heaven!

Hubbie exclaimed "Yowza!" when, on the way out the door to work in his typical grab-for-granola-bar,  I placed one of THESE in his hand instead. In his words, caveman-style b/t bites, "Ev.Er.Ey.Day.Me.Wantie." I scaled the recipe back, not expecting the elated response, and added some bell peppers, and instead of fresh tomato, I used a drained can of Rotel. Also, we eschew taco packets in this house, since having discovered "Taco Seasoning I" recipe on here, so I used 1 TB of that. Just the right kick, and really tasty.

I have been doing this for years, adding bacon and sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers,chopped tomatoes, spam, anything I feel like or have on hand. I wrap in wax paper when cool and put in ziploc bags and freeze. Fast and nutritious breakfast for people on the go!

Totally awesome. I kept to the recipe as best I could, only using a "taco" mix of cheese I bought on sale at Grocery Outlet a few days earlier and I used a homemade taco seasoning. I garnished these with homemade salsa and FF sour cream. We all ate the heck out of these. There was a little leftover so I just assembled it and wrapped them up for a late night snack for my husband. YUM. It really makes a ton which is a blessing for me because my three boys can EAT. You saved my behind this morning, Norman. I swear this whole meal didn't cost me any more than five bucks.

Very good for breakfast burritos with a southwest kick! I freeze these and my husband takes them to work. I have sour cream and salsa he can put in tupperware to take along with, depending on which one hes in the mood for. Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family last weekend and they loved it.  I didn't use cilantro or jalapenios, but did use turkey sausage, light mexican cheese and low fat tortillas.  They were delicious and less calories. Will make again.

I'm in college and this is a PERFECT easy morning dish. I can make a big batch over the weekend and eat it all the next week, rinse and repeat! Not to mention it tastes AMAZING too ;) Edit: I did leave out the cilantro (I'm not too fond of the flavor) and the jalapenos (I didn't have any) and just added a little more taco seasoning.

I love love love this recipe! Very flavorful and simple to make. Perfect on the go breakfast. I make this recipe as stated except one substitution. Instead  of the onion, tomato, cilantro, and jalapeño... I use 1 can of Rotel (the kind with  lime juice and cilantro)! It is delicious and makes this easy recipe even easier! Try it- your family will love this!

The eggs, veggies and meat were great choices, but I think the taco seasoning is overpowering. Also, I wanted to try this because I need something FAST to eat in the morning, but these burritos turn tough as rubber after being frozen. I literally had to use a steak knife at some points.

These are amazing.  Used the meat out of hot Italian sausage and served with homemade fruit salsa on the side.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh did I forget the mushrooms?

DH & I really enjoyed these.  Cut recipe way back for just the two of us.  Added lots of onion and red & green peppers as we love the veggies in our eggs. Will make often-can't wait to make a big batch when the family visits.  Thank you!

Amazing. I added frozen spinach, mushrooms, red bell pepper and onion. Will make these again. And again and again and again. Next time will try turkey bacon, or a lower fat alternative than the sausage.

Made with salsa instead of tomato/cilantro/chile (would be better with original suggestion), but the salsa way was fast and had ingredients on hand.

This was a FANTASTIC recepie! My husband even commented (who's not a breakfast for dinner person) on how they didn't need tabasco b/c they were so flavorful. I LOVED this & love how far it stretches too. We 1/2ed teh recepie & he still had plenty to take for lunch the next day. LOVE IT!

Very nice flavors.  I did add precooked rice.  Next time I may add pinto beans or corn.  This is a recipe that you can mix up.

Wonderful flavor, didn't change anything. But did use the low-carb tortillas, froze the prepared burritos, microwaved 1 for just 2 minutes and it was just right.  Heated them both with and without the plastic wrap- either is fine. Super great recipe.

This is a big hit at my fire station. I add some bacon and a little queso cheese and that’s it. I’ve never had any complaints from these knuckleheads and that’s rare cooking for a bunch of firemen.

These were great!  I used chorizo instead on pork sausage and it tasted awesome. Made the entire recipe and froze what was left. They reheated really good, only about 70 seconds and where great!

Delicious!  I always try to stick closely to the recipe the first time making the recipe.  Howver, based on preference, I made a few changes. I did not change much...just used Jimmy Dean's Bacon Lover's Pork sausage, and instead of taco seasoning, I used fajita seasoning, and finally instead of the tomato, I used a well drained can of mild Rotel.  This made so many burritos that I was able to freeze several and had a quick breakfast whenever I decided to use them.  The prep takes a while, but I would imagine it would go faster with at least 2 people.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has the perfect texture.  This medley of flavors takes me right back to the Montelucia in Arizona where we had authentic southwestern flavors.  If you live authentic flavor you will LOVE this !!!!!

This recipe is AWESOME. Followed the recipe exactly. Love the concept - spend a little more time up front, and have some to throw in the freezer later. Used about 1.5 pounds of sausage (hot/mild mix) and made 15 burritos. Make sure to drain the eggs and sausage well! Probably will take it down to 1 heaping tablespoon of Taco Seasoning I (to taste) and may play with adding brown rice to stretch these further.  No luck with the whole wheat tortillas - they tore, will stick with white or multigrain from here out!  Didn't wait for the mix to cool down before adding in the cheddar, it all worked fine. Had to microwave the tortillas in batches of 3-4 for 30 seconds at a time to make them pliable enough to wrap without tearing. 40 seconds from the fridge (in the microwave) to my tummy! I'm wondering how these will be out of the freezer - will update at that point.

In a previous review I stated that I left out the cheese to cut down on fat ... BIG MISTAKE!!  The burritos need the cheese to hold all of the mixture together! Now it is crumbly. Next time I will reduce the sausage and leave the cheese! Excellent easy breakfast still tho.

Great recipe! So convenient to have these in the freezer for busy mornings. I used vegetarian sausage and egg beaters to make these a little more diet-friendly (my batch turned out 19 total, calculated as: 287 cal, 9 g fat, 18 g protein) thanks for sharing!

Loved the taste but found the direction to microwave 3 to 4 minutes to be way too long.  1 minute was plenty for a piping hot burrito!  I’d suggest starting with 1 minute and working your way up as necessary...

Delicious! I made a huge batch and stored in the freezer for and easy, quick, and tasty breakfast. I didn't have any cilantro, so I left that out. I also make my own taco seasoning and I find the packaged stuff to be pretty bland.

I love this recipe! Sometimes, I add cooked Southwest style shredded refrigerated hash browns to the recipe and it's so yummy.  I make a big batch and we eat them up throughout the week and we've even started making them for friends because they've been such a hit.  I also make them dairy free for me and they still have a ton of flavor. I've shared this recipe a couple of times with friends.  It's that good!

I do a couple of potatoes in the microwave also. I also do bacon and sausage. Then I always add potato, egg, cheese, bacon or sausage and roll into a burrito. I use the pico de gallo after I heat the burrito the morning I am eating it. I don’t do the taco seasoning in mine and I use the 3 Mexican cheeses grated together.  I also have some refried beans and put a thin layer of beans instead of the potato on some of them.  It gives you a choice!

Been looking for a recipe similar to a Mexican breakfast burrito and this is close! Great tasting even after freezing the extras.  There tends be excessive fluid so draining the scrambled eggs helps.

It's a good recipe. But there is already so much salt in the pork sausage that there is no need to add more salt. Instead of taco seasoning, which again is mostly salt, I used chili powder and hot paprika, and I also added red peppers for additional flavor.

Loved them.  I made a few changes, the biggest change: instead of using 20 six inch tortillas I used 16 eight inch WHOLE WHEAT tortillas (it was a great idea, excellent flavor).  Plus I didn't use the taco seasoning and I used diced green peppers instead of a jalepano.

These were awesome and easy to make. The wife and I ate on them all week. It would be great to feed a lot of people. We just left the mix in the fridge and made individual burritos as needed.

Had an interesting flavor but I felt it was missing something. Some salsa or guacamole might make a good addition to this for me. Mainly made this to practice my burrito folding...

This was delicious. I did make modify the recipe. I used soy chorizo cooked it along with veggies except for the tomatoes and cilantro. Made the eggs separately. Combined the eggs and meat together. I didn't have taco seasoning but I had fajita seasoning added to the combo. Allowed to simmer, then added the cilantro and tomatoes. Placed in a warm tortilla with mozzarella cheese. The family loved it.

I made these for a Bloody Mary Brunch.  These are GREAT the only thing I changed was I added some leftover brown rice.  Leftovers were great for the Grand Kids, two days later.
I am ready to make some to freeze for quick breakfast for just me.
PS.  I also used some Churizo with the ground pork.

These burritos were great. I left out the jalapenos for the kids, but I think that they would have been delicious in them. All of the flavors were perfectly blended together. My entire family loved these.

We like this recipe we live Phoenix, Arizona and eat lots of mexican food, but I add potatoes cook them along with the beef.or pork sausage, a real good nutrisious breakfast.
