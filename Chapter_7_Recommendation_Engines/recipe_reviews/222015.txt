Turned out amazing - what I did do additionally is cut the layer of fat to just under the meat and rubbing the herb rub into the slits also gives the meat a delicious taste - also, the last 5 minutes or so I put the oven on grill at 190 degrees Celsius just to make the skin super crispy.

It turned out like I had in Muchen. I have had it twice and it is great. 01-01-2017 Made it again. I can't say enough how good these pork shanks taste. Make them just like the recipe. No changes. Yummy!!!

great as given.  I also used smoked hocks the next time 
I made it and it was not as good.  So, fresh only.

This turned out fantastic !  Looked just like the photo and the flavor was wonderful.  I think it would be great with Lamb Shanks too.  Will do this one again !
