With some changes this was a very tasty dish.    First of all, I followed advice gleaned from a long-ago Chinese room-mate: always stir-fry boneless chicken cubes first (and quickly over high heat), adding them back to the stir-fry once the vegetables are tender crisp.  Chicken breast can be very easily overcooked.    Here are the other changes I made:    I minced up 2 garlic and about a one-inch piece of fresh ginger.  I used half of it to stir-fry the chicken and the other half to stir fry the vegetables.    Speaking of the vegetables, I added broccoli and green onion (which I had on hand)to the mix.    For the sauce, I followed the advice of many reviewers and doubled the vinegar and brown sugar, also adding the juice from a larger tin of pineapple cubes.  Given the extra liquid, I decided to increase the amount of cornstarch from 1 to 2 Tbsp, which was perfect.  With the extra sauce, I could have added more vegetables.  Next time I would increase the peppers.    I served it with brown rice.  A very satisfying dinner.

This recipe deserves 5 stars and I'd give more if I could.  My pickiest son even loved this.  I took others suggestions and doubled the sauce and got a 20 ounce can crushed pineapple and kept the soy sauce the same at 1/4 cup.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of ketchup to give it that reddish color you see at restaurants.  This was restaurant caliber and I'm adding it to my recipe box to make again and again in the future!

I've made this as is and it was very good. With a few changes it can be awesome. I made a lot more sauce using a few different recipes for reference and I added onion. I will definitely make this again.

This was great - I followed someone else's review and used a larger can of pinapple for the extra juice. Next time, I would probably use tidbits instead of pinapple chunks. Totally try it!

I followed this recipe exactly as posted and boy was it good! I love making stirfrys and I have been looking for a good sweet and sour chicken one and am so glad that I finally found it. We gobbled this one down, I will make it again very soon. Thank you so much!

My husband said it was the best sweet and sour chicken he ever had. He bragged about it to his buddies at work! I used Double the ingrdiants on the sauce except the teriaki sauce. Added some ketchup. Plus I used a 20oz can of pineapple chunks and made extra chicken. topped chicken over wild grain rice. This came out awesome. I will be making this dish often! THANKS for sharing!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I liked it because you didn't bread the chicken, which means fewer calories. I did add ketchup to the sauce and also doubled the sauce. The next time I make it I will season the chicken while cooking, we thought the chicken was tasteless.

It's hard to find a recipe that truly tastes like you would expect...My husband, son and I REALLY enjoyed this recipe. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i think it needs a few modifications. SEASON THE CHICKEN: If you don't, the chicken is a little bland even if the sauce is salty. I think it would better to season the chicken and cut down on the soy sauce if you don't like salty food...(I do though). I just used some sea salt and cracked black pepper before frying it and it was really good. MORE SAUCE: I doubled the sauce like other reviewers, and I am glad I did because it was perfect. I used almost all the juice of a 20oz can of pineapple, and about half the pineapple in the can (don't like things too sweet). The only thing I wouldn't double in the sauce is the ginger, unless you like a strong ginger flavor. I also added some Chinese Garlic Chili sauce (1 tsp) for a bit of spice in the sauce and some sesame seeds as I was frying the veggies. for the 1 pound of chicken, i used 1 whole green bell pepper and 1 whole red pepper, also added 1 onion (i think it's a must!) and 1 carrot. It's easier for me to measure veggies like that as opposed to in cups. I also added 1TBSP of ketchup like other reviewers did, and to make it easier, I combined ALL the ingredients of the sauce in a medium bowl and wisked, and then just poured all that into the skillet when the chicken and the veggies were done. I WILL MAKE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN! THANK YOU VINEYIS!!

Other reviewers mention using ketchup to attain the red color of the usual Sweet and Sour. All recipes I have seen or used actually call for marachino cherry juice to make the color more vibrant. This seems more logical since there are often cherries in Sweet and Sour dishes. The ketchup idea just seems a bit strange to me.

It was just OK.  My 4 year old didn't like it and ate a pear instead.  My hubby ate two helpings though.  I don't know if there was too much soy sauce for the recipe or what, but it just didn't do it for us.  I much prefer Lana's S  S meatball sauce so next time I will use that.  Thank you though!

I also modified the recipe somewhat by taking out 1/2 the soy sauce, and adding some ketchup, more pineapple juice, and a little more ginger.  My rice isn't quite ready yet, and I'm afraid we'll have eaten all the pork (oh yeah, I also used pork loin instead of chicken......melt in your mouth!!) by the time it's done!!

Yummy and quick and easy to put together!!  I followed another reviewers advice cooked the chicken in the hot oil with garlic and some fresh ginger just to brown.  Removed the chicken and added the peppers and onion (also with garlic and fresh ginger);when tender, added the chicken back in with the pineapple.  For the sauce, I doubled the vinegar and brown sugar.  This recipe was excellent!  Everyone loved it and thought it was restaurant quality.  A great weeknight meal!

Very nice.  I followed recipe as directed but had a bit more chicken, so increased the vegies accordingly.  Also added about a quarter of a cup more water, and a tad more of everything else except the soy sauce, to make sure I had enough sauce and help decrease the sodium a bit.  It was very tasty, but next time I think I will remove the chicken and vegies from the pan before I add the ingredients for the sauce, and bring the sauce almost to a boil before adding everything back, as it took so long for the liquid to come to a boil that the meat was a bit tough and the vegies were a little overdone for our palates (and I was using a big saute pan with a lot of surface area).  I can see making this a part of the rotation - by cutting up the vegies the night before, and storing in a container in the frig, and maybe even mixing the ingredients for the sauce (sans pineapple juice and corn starch), again storing in the frig in a covered container, this could make a really quick dinner: with most everything cut up ahead of time, by the time the rice is done cooking, you could have yourself a meal!  Thanks for making dinner a little easier!

This was okay...the sauce was not as flavorful as my usual sweet n sour.  I also added onions, which I think imparted more flavor than it would have had otherwise.  Not a keeper for me.

Great taste. All it needs is more corn starch cause the sauce wasn't thick at all. It was more like meat and veggies in sauce sauce soup.

I thought that this recipe turned out great.  Although the chicken could use some extra seasoning.  I ended up adding 16oz of crushed pineapple and 2 Tbsp of ketchup as I read in other reviews.  Will make this one again.

This was ok. I thought it had too much soy sauce in it, which made it too salty. Probably won't make again.

I did make a lot of substitutions for this. I doubled the recipe to start. Instead of the soy I replaced it with all apple cider vinegar and then upped the brown sugar(probably using around 1/2 cup) to account for the sour. I used yellow and orange peppers. I reduced the amount of ginger since I am not a fan. It turned out great! Thanks Vineysis.

this was absolutely delicious! I added carrots and green onion and yellow onion, seseme oil, and used frozen breaded chicken tenderloins.  I just baked them, chopped them and added them to the cooked sauce! WONDERFUL, i didnt really need to thicken it up either because the breading did that.  It was great.  I added just a little ketchup just like others suggested.. GREAT recipe, keeper!

I used low sodium soy sauce. This recipe was good, but next time I think I will use 1/2 of the soy sauce and increase the pineapple juice. I serve it over white rice.

I followed the advice of my fellow reviewers and made a couple of changes to the recipe. I used a 20 oz. can of pineapple, doubled the vinegar (rice wine) and brown sugar, and added a hefty squirt of ketchup. I like things spicy so I also added a little sriracha. With the changes, I would give this recipe 4 stars.

This was a fantastic and tasty recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the soy sauce/cornstarch sauce.  I'm going to try other veggies.  You can't go wrong with this one.

Very good and fairly easy to assemble.  As with many recipes, I think that it never hurts to add some extra veggies.  I added two whole bell peppers - 1 orange and 1 green - and about 20 baby carrots which I cut into large match-sticks.  I had more than 1lb of chicken and we like lots of sauce so I did about 150% on those items.  Next time, I might add baby corns and some rough chopped while or yellow onions for a touch more crunch and flavor.

Thought this was yummy! I followed some other suggestions & added about 3/4 of a 20 oz can of pineapple w/ juice, kept soy sauce the same & doubled cornstarch, vinegar & brown sugar. Also added about 2 T ketchup. Used garlic powder instead of fresh.  Used 1 green pepper & 1 med. onion & about 1 C matchstick carrots.  Very good!

This recipe is easy to make and very very good, even for the average cook.  I used 3/4 of a can of pineapple tidbits and added a little Asian Zing sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings!  Yum!

Delicious; I used a 20-oz can of pineapple chunks (I love pineapple!) and about half the soy sauce.  I used a bag of frozen red and green peppers, which made it really easy (less chopping--I did julienne some baby carrots, though).  I also used jarred crushed ginger in place of the powdered.

VERY good. I added celery, as celery is good in just about everything. Added a small onion chopped coarsely, and added some dried red pepper to taste for a little bite. Topped with some green onion and served over rice. I think this is the best stir-fry type thing I have ever cooked.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I sliced the chicken into thin strips instead of cubes, and that cut down on the cooking time, plus it made for extra tender chicken.  I also added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.  This doesn't make a lot, so be sure to double the recipe, as it's delicious.

This is a perfect dish!  I added 1 cup of onion, cut my carrots on the diagonal, and used fresh pineapple and about 1/2 cup pineapple juice.  My daughter and I loved this recipe.  A healthier version as compared to the deep fried chicken covered with sweet syrup available at the restaurants.  This is exactly what I have always wanted sweet and sour chicken to be.

This was delicious! I only used 1 T olive oil instead of 2 T vegetable oil.  I also doubled the sauce like others had suggested. I spooned over brown rice with green onions. It was so good, everyone loved it and the leftovers were to DIE for! Great recipe. It's definitely going in the box of keepers.

I'll agree that this recipe is very easy & quick to make, + is very colorful, but we found that it really was missing something - because it was rather bland. It needed some zing. Perhaps more vinegar and a small amount of hot red pepper flakes(?) - not enough to make the dish hot, mind you, but it definitely needs a kick. It wasn't bad - just bland. I just wouldn't make the recipe again without adding a kick.

I thought the sauce was excellent, and is what makes the dish. I did change a few things, like adding 1/4 cup of DARK brown sugar, adding broccoli and  snap peas. I also let the solution simmer for over a 1/2 hour to thicken up the sauce and tenderize the vegetables. Next time I make this, I will double the sauce so there is some to run over on the rice.

I made this the other night and served it over rice and had steamed broccli on the side. I don't care for peppers so left them out. I also had some cherry flavored grenadine and added it just for a little taste. It was an easy recipe to do (did add more carrots and pineapple) and my gourmet loving husband enjoyed every bite. Not the usuall red sweet n sour color, but had good flavor! Will make again!

Superb! Good portion sizes (Fed me and hubby, plus 2 kids, and even had some left over for lunch tomorrow).  I used the 16 oz can of pineapple and omitted the ginger because I am allergic, but the flavor was still excellent.  I also used the carrot "chips" (crinkle cut slices in salad section of grocery) and they didnt cook up quite as tender as I would've liked.  Next time I will make sure they get a little cook time on their own before I add the peppers.

I love this recipe!! I've made it quite a few times with a few little adjustments (I doubled the soy sauce, cornstarch, vinegar, brown sugar, and ground ginger). It turns out great and it's super easy. The last time I made it it turned out the best, but I agree, you may want to remove the chicken while you stir fry the veggies since the chicken dried out a little but at the same time my husband didn't seem to notice and thought it was fantastic. I highly recommend this one!

Pretty good, but it felt like it was missing something.  With the taste of sweet and sour chicken without all the fat and calories, I will make it again, though.  Definitely needs some tweaking, though!

I tend to be a lazy stir-frier and just throw in whatever I have around the house, but I was looking for something a little different and this did not look hard. LOVE THIS RECIPE. It tasted great. I've made it both with pineapple chunks and mashed up pineapple. We also tend to put soy sauce out when setting the table just because fiance loves extra soy sauce, but I think this recipe is pretty awesome just as is. The friends we've made it for really love it too.

This was such a disappointment! The flavor in itself was ok, but there is no way I would ever call it sweet & sour. It just tasted like some average stir fry with no sweet & sour flavor. Will never make this again.

Flavorful and easy to prepare. I keep fresh ginger in the freezer, so I grated it and used it in place of ground ginger.

This recipe is a great basis for the amazing dinner. I've changed it a bit - added onions and cashew and varied sugar/vinegar/spices amounts to taste. Served over rice with green tea it was just perfect. Many thanks to the author!

We liked this recipe very much!  I used cubed pork instead of chicken, and I added chopped onions, 2 tabsp. ketchup, and halved maraschino cherries with a little juice for flavor and color.  (I only had green bell peppers, no red)  I increased the vinegar to offset the sweetness of the cherries.  We served this over white rice.  I put condiment dishes of slivered almonds, chopped green onions, and chinese noodles to add on top according to personal preference.  It was a very attractive dish, and very tasty.  And quick and easy, which rates high in my book!

I made this a few years ago and forgot to save it to my recipe box.  I just stumbled across it again and made it tonight.  I still love it!  Double the sauce if you like to drizzle it over your rice.

My rating on this is all a matter of preference. I just wanted everyone to take note that this is a soy sauce based sauce, so is more of a deep flavor and less of a tangy flavor. I prefer the tangier ones that get most of their liquid from pineapple juice and chicken broth, with a hint of soy. So, for some people this might be their ultimate recipe - go for it! But for me, a different flavor is my ideal sweet and sour.

The sauce makes this recipe.  I cut the chicken and veggies to serve 2, but left the sauce the same.  It was amazing.  I added broccoli and onion, omitted the peppers due to personal preference.  My husband and I both rated it 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this dish and it was quick and easy on a busy night.  One of my picky eaters who doesn't like chicken gobbled it right up.  I would deffiently add a little more seasoning to spice it up...a little on the bland side but still very good.

The sauce had a very nice true sweet & sour flavor.  My only complaint is that the sauce could be thicker.  Next time I will add a little more cornstarch and cook the sauce separately before adding to the stir fry.  I will also add some onion for more flavor.

Yum. I cubed the meat from three chicken breasts for this recipe, and used only green bell pepper. I also added extra garlic to suit my personal taste. Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely. The sweet and sour sauce was spot-on, but I feel like the recipe would have been a true 5 if the chicken had the classic crispy coating. I know this is a much healthier alternative, but if I make this again I'm going to add the coating! I'm willing to sacrifice a few health points for the perfect sweet and sour. :)

If I could give this recipe a higher rating I would. At work I am in charge of a staff meal. We feed about 100 people. Anyway, I had to find a recipe that was easy( I cook for the AM and then I leave notes a such for the PM staff to follow) I came acroos this recipe and so I used it. It came out wondefully!!! I however did a couple of things. I didn't have anyway pineapple juice so I pureed a fresh pineapple! WAYYYYYY Better than canned pineapple! The other thing is, I mixed Sweet Chili Sauce, Soy Sauce, Ginger, Sesame Oil, Red Wine Vinager, and a 4 T. of Sarrono Chili Sauce and poured it over the chicken to marande, while setting up the meal! (keep in mind I was maranding 40lbs of chicken). Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I will use it again. This is WAY better than my other recipe!!!

This recipe is okay. without adding something spicy it kind of lacks that extra 'umph' I added huy fong to my sauce. Made it in a wok so it was very quick. Would make again for a quick weeknight meal, but it won't make my list of best recipes.

This was a very good meal.  I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and garlic before cooking.  I also added pineapple juice with the soy sauce and cornstarch, made for a great flavor.

Delicious!  I added 1/2 bag frozen broccoli and one can water chestnuts to stir fry.  Also, doubled sauce recipe, but kept ground ginger at only 1/2 tsp wouldn't double that.  Great taste!

Pretty good... my husband liked it, and I liked it, too... although it tasted almost exact to the Lean Cuisine brand (so maybe it's an unfair review since that is a diet product).  I did add some ketchup, yellow pepper, and sesame seeds to mine.  I also upped the pineapple to a 20 ounce can, and I'm glad I did.  It was good served with rice, but my 3 year old didn't want to eat it.

Very nice dish. Quick preparation once you get the chopping done. All of this was done in the time it took the rice to cook. This had a beautiful presentation and looked just like the picture. My son loved this and had seconds, my husband and I both enjoyed our meal but we have had better. The sauce was good, but needed to be more "sweet and sour" if THAT makes any sense. Maybe leaving out the ginger and adding ketchup? I'm not sure what would have improved this as was really nice, but just wasn't what our taste buds wanted I guess. DH and I voted we'd prefer a breaded piece of meat that had sauce ladled over. This was a good meal though and delicious too.

Wow, I'm not one to get over excited about recipes, but this one is really good. I doubled the sauce - except the soysauce - as recommended, and it was very, very good. I like a little spice though, so I added a couple of chili peppers in adobo sauce for spice and color. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future use. The only thing I might do differently is put the carrots in earlier. I like them crunchy, but my husband and son do not.

I can't believe how delicous this turned out. I made one change which was I added 12oz. pineapple which is just a little more than the recipe calls for and I'm glad I did because I really like the extra pineapple. It also gave a little more juice to the sauce which was great as well. Can't wait to make it again because I got such sweet praise from my family when I served this.

Delicious!  I used an entire red and green pepper and 2 cups of carrots.  I also substituted rice vinegar for the white vinegar for a more subtle flavor.  This is so simple and very tasty!

This definitely tasted better than take-out!  I agreed with other reviewers and added more pineapple- a 15oz can and doubled the sauce. I think next time I will add less soy sauce, it was a tad too salty. I found this recipe is a great way to stretch a small bit of meat- I only used 1 large chicken breast cut into 1 inch pieces and I served it all over brown rice.

I added a bit more red and green pepper than the recipe called for and I also added an onion.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and added a little ketchup to it.  I also used tamari (a very flavorful type of soy sauce) instead of regular soy sauce.  Very good.

I made this recipe last night.  It was very good - couldnt get enough of the sauce.  I didnt have cornstarch on hand, but used a teaspoon of flour instead to thicken.  I was expecting it to be more red (like the sweet n sour sauce in the restaurant that is made with ????) but this was so good.  The ginger gave it an authentic taste.  Very delish and i will be making this again soon.
Thanks.

Oh - my entire family loved it.

Very, very good! My husband said  it was one of the best sweet and sour dishes he has tasted. The only thing I did different was that I added some sweet red chili sauce to it and it was fantastic! Oh...I also marinated the chicken in a light Teriyaki for 30 minutes before cooking.

I didn't love this, but I will probably make it again, with some minor changes. I sauteed some onion with the chicken, skipped the peppers (kids won't eat, though you will sacrifice color if you do)and added a bit of ketchup (2-3 T) to the sauce to give it the orangey color of restaurant S&S Chicken and a bit more flavor. A quick meal, and my kids (4 and 2) did enjoy this.

What a great recipe! It was easy to make and tasted wonderful -- none of that "too sweet" problem so many s&s recipes have.  Definitely a keeper to make again and again....

cook the veggies after browning the chicken in the same pan? that's crazy talk. Instead, I sautéed the veggies with some olive oil separately. Then when they're just done, i.e. the peppers have a translucent look to them, I add them in with the chicken browning in a sauce pan. I doubled everything because 4 servings is never enough. I switched out the soy sauce which is too salty (even when I use low sodium) for tamari, a japanese soy sauce that is sweeter in flavor and isn't as salty. Like the other reviewers, I used chunks of pineapples instead of crush and because the can only comes in 20oz size, i forgo the vinegar. By the way, for those who hate to deal with mincing ginger (like me), I buy frozen crushed ginger cubes. They last forever and so easy to pop one out and use in any recipe. The brand name is Dorot.

I used this recipe as a starting point and made some adjustments based on what I had in the house. First off, I had time to marinate the meat beforehand. I threw the breasts (about 1.5 lbs.) into a gallon resealable plastic bag along with 1/2 cup soy sauce, 2 Tbs vinegar, 2 Tbs brown sugar and 1 tsp ground ginger. I left out the garlic because my fiance is allergic.

While this marinated in the fridge I chopped up the veggies I had on hand: carrots, celery and mushrooms. I had a 22 oz. can of pineapple slices, which I also chopped up. Increased cornstarch to 2 Tbs, used a wok and peanut oil, served over hot rice. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a fantastic stir fry!  Very easy, fast and delicious.  I throw in a variety of veggies (carrots, celery, peppers, onions) and double the sauce so there is plenty of it to cover all the extra veggies and rice.  Highly recommend!

Was a good recipe-followed West Vancouvers Foodies's advice and was perfect!!  Yummo so thank you so much!!From West Vancouver Foodie-With some changes this was a very tasty dish. First of all, I followed advice gleaned from a long-ago Chinese room-mate: always stir-fry boneless chicken cubes first (and quickly over high heat), adding them back to the stir-fry once the vegetables are tender crisp. Chicken breast can be very easily overcooked. Here are the other changes I made: I minced up 2 garlic and about a one-inch piece of fresh ginger. I used half of it to stir-fry the chicken and the other half to stir fry the vegetables. Speaking of the vegetables, I added broccoli and green onion (which I had on hand)to the mix. For the sauce, I followed the advice of many reviewers and doubled the vinegar and brown sugar, also adding the juice from a larger tin of pineapple cubes. Given the extra liquid, I decided to increase the amount of cornstarch from 1 to 2 Tbsp, which was perfect. With the extra sauce, I could have added more vegetables. Next time I would increase the peppers. I served it with brown rice. A very satisfying dinner.

I normally don't rate recipes because they are not worthy to be rated so when I do it means it was outstanding!  I made this for the first time today and it was AMAZING!  We have a local Chinese place and I can tell you when I am craving Chinese now I will surely do this instead of take out and it was so easy to prepare too!

We really enjoyed this!  I doubled the recipe using 20 oz can of pineapple with its juice.  I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts and half of a large onion cut into chunks.  Used a little more vinegar than called for.  This was easy, quick and delicious!

Deserves full 5 stars !! My entire family loved this ! I made some changes though,, I grated 2 cloves of garlic and uses 2 teaspoons of ginger and I used half of this mix to cook the chicken alone first and I added it later after the veggies cooked. I also followed the other suggestions by adding the juice of the pineapples. 
This smelled fantastic and tasted the same and this was just my first try !
Thank u for this recipe !!

I'm always on the lookout for a good stirfry recipe, and this one was really good! I changed a few things, but it was fantastic! First, I sauteed the chicken with fresh minced garlic and ginger instead of by itself. I set it in a bowl to the side after it was done because I added lots of veggies instead of following the list above. I used carrots, celery, red and yellow peppers, baby corn and thinly sliced onion, which I also sauteed in minced garlic and ginger. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, and replaced the pineapple juice with fresh juice from one orange. After the veggies were almost done, I threw the chicken back in with the fresh pineapple, and dumped the sauce in. I let it simmer for a few minutes until the vinegar cooked and the sauce thickened...it was FANTASTIC. Definitely a keeper!

While "OK," my hubs and I both agree this wasn't the best sweet & sour we've ever had. Sal's sweet & sour chicken II is FAR  better, IMHO. My hubs isn't even a fan of sweet & sour and he REALLY likes Sal's version. :) I felt that the "crunch" usually associated with traditional sweet & sour was missing here. This needs something crisp to add texture - celery or water chestnuts come to mind. The carrots and bell peppers only added slight crunch, leaving me wanting more.... I also felt that this sauce was not as flavorful as other's I've had. As wifeyluvs2cook did, I too cut up breaded (Tyson brand) chicken fingers instead of sauteing actual cut-up chicken breasts. While I thought the idea sounded great, it didn't work for me at all. :( The breading fell off my chicken! In retrospect, I should have partially thawed my chicken FIRST, then cut into chunks BEFORE baking (oh well!). My last change was to add a heaping tablespoonful of katsup to my sauce to impart color (I was out of red food coloring or else I would have used that). Served over fried rice with egg rolls on the side. Maybe this will be THE sweet & sour recipe for your family, but it wasn't for mine. Thanks anyways, VINEYIS. :-)

What I'm really rating here is the sweet and sour sauce recipe, which I think is spot-on, except that I always use fresh minced ginger rather than powdered. For us vegetarians, this is great over cubed, super-firm tofu or seitan.

This was good, but not my favorite. I read some of the reviews and decided to add extra of the pineapple juice (from a 20oz can) and a squirt of the kecthup. I don't think i will make this again, but it was worth a try.

I made this last night (left out the Green/Red Bell Peppers - Only because I did not have on hand, left out the soy-vinegar and just used white distilled vinger 2TSPs.  This was an ABSOLUTE hit with my family, my picky 6 year old kept telling me this is so YUMMY and GOOD - So THANK YOU for a GREAT recipe - Definitely a keeper.

This was really good with brown rice. I like how you can change up the veggies, I used a bag of stirfry veggies I had on hand. I also doubled the sauce ingredients except soy sauce but left the pineapple chunks out just adding the juice. I have always liked sour and sweet flavors together like this, so if you typically do then I think you'll like this dish.

This recipe turned out just as planned. the sauce was thick and had an ideal sweet and sour taste. I only added broccoli because I am a big fan in any kind of stir fry. I also used yellow and red bell peppers, because that is what I had on hand. I think next time I will add mushrooms as well for more vegetable variety. Thank you so much for this. i def will be making again

I just made this tonight to satisfy a craving for Asian - style food.  It was easy and very tasty.  The only change I made was to add a few shakes of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.

So delicious!!! I used a 20 oz can of pineapple tidbits and doubled the amount of brown sugar and vinegar as suggested by other reviewers. I recommend letting the mixture simmer for 10-15 minutes...the chicken becomes very tender and tasty!

Fantastic! I followed everyone else's advice about using a whole can of pineapple and doubling the sauce stuff (minus the soy sauce) and used a whole red and green bell pepper each.

I'd say this is four stars as written, but very easy to turn it into 5 stars. I halved the recipe, but still used the whole can of pineapple chunks. I wanted to stretch it further, so I used way more veggies. I used the ones called for as well as orange pepper and onion (i bet broccoli would be good too). I tasted before serving and knew it was defintely missing something, so I added a tablespoon or so of ketchup and a couple dashes of red pepper flakes. It turned out delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

so sad this didn't work out for us way - to much soy sauce even doubling the rest of the sauce ingredient and adding some ketchup I had to doctor the taste just so the soy sauce wasn't so overwelming.

I followed the suggestions of others and used a 20 oz can of pineapple and made double the sauce (used all the juice). I added more ginger and only used green bell peppers since that is all I had. I also added an onion.  I mixed the sauce in one bowl and added the pineapple with the vegetables so they can get sauted too. I plan on making this again soon.

Used olive oil instead, and didn't have cornstarch so I substituted flour. I added onion like the reviews suggested. It was delicious! Will definitely make it again, but think I will double the amount of sauce.

Easy and delicious. You could easily make it more like a Chinese restaurant by breading and frying the chicken, but I like that it's quick and healthier. I doubled the sauce (except the soy and pineapple), added broccoli and cauliflower, and just a little bit of white pepper. I also used extra cornstarch to thicken the sauce more. Will make again.

Thank-you for this recipe! I fried the chicken in the oil then put it, and all the rest of the ingredients into the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 6 hours and it turned out perfectly!!

Really yummy!  I used 3 lbs of chicken and tripled the sauce and had plenty.  The sauce is also so flavorful that a little went a long way.  I cubed the chicken and seasoned with kosher salt, pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper, garlic powder and some fresh garlic and let it sit in a ziploc bag while I prepped the remaining ingredients.  I then assembled the sauce in a bowl to allow the cornstarch to start to thicken.  I used a 20oz can of pineapple in heavy syrup.  I pulsed it a few times in the food processer so that it was smaller pieces of pineapple.  I sauteed the chicken with only a small amount of oil and when almost finished, I added the veggies.  I used carrots and zuccini in matchsticks, a red pepper and a vidalia onion.  The sauce was added last and it thickened up VERY quickly.  What a thick flavorful sauce!  I think peanuts as a garnish or water chestnuts would add a nice crunch.  I'll try that next time.  :-)

This was a good recipe although I am still searching for the sweet and sour recipe that will really "WOW" the family.  I used about a pound and a half of chicken so I doubled the sauce (except for the soy sauce for fear it would be too salty), used a 20oz can of pineapple and added sliced onion.  Served over rice, this was a tasty dinner!

I used the larger can of pineapple tidbits suggested by other reviewers and for vegetables sliced up green peppers, onions, carrots and celery. This was absolutely the best stir fry to ever come out of our kitchen. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was very good, I did pour the sauce on top of the chicken and vegetables to let it marinate for just a few minutes. Added that extra flavor to the plate.

Awesome!  I wanted something different from my usual stir fry and tried this based on the rating.  I did use the larger can of pineapple and doubled the sauce ingredients.  Also added sliced onions.  Since I tend to overcook the veggies, I think next time I'll add water chestnuts for extra crunch.  I also will try pineapple tidbits to distribute the fruit more.  This was as good as anything I've had Chinese fast food restaurants.  Definitely will make again and again and again!

Awesome.  I used the advise of some of the other reviewers and I made more of the sauce mixture.  I actually used 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup Worstechire as that is what I had on hand.  I also added onions and omitted the carrots.  Great results.  Family VERY happy.

Super yummy!!!! Like some other reviewers suggested, I did double the sauce ingredients(except for the soy sauce), and used pork tenderloin and I also added some ketchup. It came out great. The whole family loved it.

This recipe was fabulous!! I made it exactly as stated first, then when it was done I decided it needed more juice, so I took 8 of crushed pineapple with juice and poured it in and about a teaspoon of ketchup. Awesome. Even my picky kids ate it. Will for sure be a regular at my house. Thanks!!

Wow! This is probably the second chinese food recipe i've made in 5 years- and it's going to be a weekly dish from now on! I loved this! I followed others suggestions; seasoned the chicken, doubled all the ingredients in the sauce except the soy sauce, and added a little bit of ketchup. This was awesome, I would definitely recommend it, and WILL make again!

Quick. Simple ingredients. Perfect!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
I did add ingredients to the finished original recipe. I added half a small onion, and one tbsp of ketchup.

Thanks for all of the ideas. I wish we could create a IV recipe that combines all of your ideas. It was frustrating to have to go through and take notes. I cut up the chicken and let it marinate in olive oil, soy sauce, Mirin rice wine, fresh ginger, and other spices advised in a post. Then, I sauteed the meat in COCONUT oil (virgin). Gave it a different taste and yummy smell. I added garlic, Mirin rice wine, other advised spices, more fresh ginger, NUTMEG, dried yellow mustard, salt, powdered ginger, garlic powder, and stir fried those together. For veggies, I used the bell peppers--but I added China pea pods,carrots, water chestnuts, and a few other things suggested. I boiled the sauce, but I couldn't get it to thicken. So, I added corn starch that I first mixed with orange juice to get rid of the lumps. That added a yummy flavor. I brought it to a boil, added it to the meat concoction, and then I baked all of it for 30 minutes. It turned out really well by combining everyone's ideas--including adding catsup, less soy sauce, more brown sugar, a tad more vinegar, and more pineapple. I served with sticky jasmine rice. I got rave reviews. Great recipe. Thanks for the added ideas.

my husband said its "the best chinese food ever!" and he hates chinese food. I had to add a ton of brown sugar to the original recipe because my husband forgot to get the 20 oz like people had recommended. I think it would have made it much better. oh and I floured the chicken and fried it... then let the oil dry out of it before covering it with the sauce. and I put some cornstarch on the rice to make instant rice, sticky rice. it was great, but read the other reader's recommendations

I think this is a quick, fairly easy recipe and pretty healthy so I gave it 3 stars, but it is pretty bland in my opinion. I would love to see someone add a comment to spice up the spice and make it more like what you would find in a restaurant.  I followed the advice to double the sauce, add extra ginger and even added Asian chile sauce and it still was a little disspointing to me.

Just made this recipe tonight and I loved it!  I did not have any ginger, and had to use crushed pineapple instead of cubed because that is all I had, but it worked! Very easy too.  Will definitely make again.

I'd actually give this 3-1/2.  It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of the La Choy stuff you get out of a can...which is okay tasting.  Super easy to make.  I'll try another recipe though.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved how this turned out. I didn't have any ground ginger so I left it out. Also didn't have any carrots but added a couple splashes of sesame seed oil and it was real good. Also added some green onion. Even the 10 yr old picky eater liked it. I might add that I put it on a bed of white rice.

This was awesome!  The first recipe I've ever made from all recipes!  I doubled the sauce like others suggested, added a little ketchup for some red color.  Didn't use any ginger, added onions and substituted water chestnuts for carrots.  Great consistency.  My husband loved it, he said he wouldn't change a thing.  I like a little bit more of a kick, maybe a little spicy sauce would be good.

Very good sauce. It's not as red of a sauce as you get in a restaurant, but don't let it discourage you from this tasty dish. This is a much healthier than takeout. I like that the chicken is grilled as well.

I love love love this recipe.  One of my favorites.  I use one large can of pinapple (20 oz) and double the sauce.  I also use low-sodium soy sauce so it doesn't get to be too salty.  Have made this many times and will make many many more.

Excellent recipe!  Definitely a hit in our household.  I like the carrots, especially and that the meat is not breaded and fried.  We'll make this again.

I used frozen stir-fry vegetables and twice as much pineapple (just because we love it).  Wonderful!  Thank you!

Excellent and easy.  I used the veggies I had on hand...snap peas, yellow pepper, carrots, and a little celery for crunch.  It was my first time making and eating a sweet and sour dish.  We thought the "sweet and sour" balance was just perfect!

Great! I had all the ingred. in the house. I did double the sauce (used 6T soy), fresh ginger, 2T ketchup and a bit of red pepper. I might add some snow peas and broccoli next time. I'm looking foward to making this again. Thank You!

This was quite good but not spectacular.My hubby likes lots of sauce on everything so I did double all the sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce, only used 1/3 cup. Love fresh ginger so I used lots of that. There wasn't the right amount of 'sweet' so I took others advice and added ketchup and a little extra br. sugar to the sauce. Added fresh pea pods for color. Happened to have a fresh pineapple so I used canned juice in the sauce and grilled slices of pineapple on the grill pan, cut them up and threw them in just before turning the heat off. Delicious! I would make this again.

An excellent recipe. I doubled the pineapple and the liquid ingredients to make it a little saucier and stretch it out a little and it was wonderful.

It was just ok.  Too much soy sauce for me.  It didn't taste sweet and sour.  My kids who usually wolf down Chinese food, as we used to live in Taiwan, ate hot dogs instead.

I really liked this recipe.  I have had a hard time finding sweet and sour recipes that I like.  I added a bit though.  I added ketchup as suggested.  I also had only half a can of pinapple juice left so I made up the difference with mango juice, it added a nice but subtle flavor.  I also added bean sprouts and cabbage to it.  They added a great crisp texture to it.  I will be using this one again.

I will definetly make this again.  I did make a a change per some other review.  The 2 Tbsp of Ketchup really dressed up the flavor.  I also used skinless boneless chicken thighs.    
Per my husbands request I will add mushrooms and omit the carrots next time.

This recipe was great!  The only thing I did different was separate the pinneapple chucks and add them to the small bowl with the other ingrediants so they could soak up the flavor.  Then I added the pinneapple juice to the pot.  It was wonderful.  My husband ate thirds!

Made it as directed (note that I rarely use measure - just guess).   I thought it was a little bland at first, but other ingredients really liven it up.  Will remove chicken after done next time / cook veggies separate.  I tried Asian recipes before and was never happy how they turned out.  I saved this one in my favorites!  Thanks SO much!

Delicious recipe! I added sugar snap peas and onions, both of which ended up being my favorite vegetables with this sauce. In addition to the homemade sweet and sour sauce, I added about 2 tablespoons of store-bought Kikkoman sweet & sour sauce (which I just happened to have) to the chicken only. This made a huge difference for me and my sauce-loving fam. Thanks for sharing!

I like the fact that the chicken is not dredged in cornstarch first and then fried, so this seems a healthier version to me. I did add onions because I had some to use up, but otherwise I followed it exactly.

Excellent recipe! I made this with my high school culinary class and they loved it. I added Chinese Lo Mein noodles and it was delicious. I will certainly use this recipe in class again and also at home. I would probably add more garlic, but that's strictly personal taste.

This recipe is so easy to make and turned out perfect. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. I will use green onion next time but it worked with the yellow onion.

Oh so good.  We like the sauce to be extra sweet, so I add a little extra brown sugar.  It was a hit.

Made this yesterday It was quite good with several of the recommended changes; i.e. used 20 oz pineapple tidbits, added 1/2 a medium onion, sliced, doubled the sauce ingredients, but reduced the soy sauce to about 1/8 cup. The result was more sweet than I like so added soy sauce to the finished dish. I really liked it but my partner didn't care for it. Oh well! I will make it again anyway.

We make this for dinner on a regular basis and  it is one of the few recipes all five of my children will eat . It’s very flexible recipe – add any vegetable your family likes. I use what I have on hand.   One change I made which I think greatly improves the dish - add 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of low salt  chicken stock/broth to the soy sauce. It gives it a nice Asian “gravy”. It also cuts down on what can be strong soy sauce flavor.

Though I did make a bit more than the recipe called for.  It came out quite well.  Adding rice to it made it go further.  Plan on making it again.

I think it would have been good had I not took someone’s comment about adding ketchup to the mix. My family of four had to add way more rice to our plates to balance the sweetness of the dish. I think without the ketchup it would have been good but if you like things really sweet then the ketchup might be a good addition for you

Loved this recipe it is great for a quick weeknight meal and the flavor was out of this world good. Really enjoy finding great tasting meals with healthier options. left overs keep really well and it tastes even better the next day. This one has gone into our monthly meal rotation. I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe was just OK for us. I doubled the sauce and used about 3/4 of it (we tend to like extra sauce). It was too much on the sweet side for us though. Missing the sour balance to the sweet here. I had a 20oz can of unsweetened pineapple chunks, which I accidentally used all of it. You'd think that would have helped give the dish the tang it needs. The next day, I tried to doctor it up by adding a little more apple cider vinegar, but then felt the need for a tad bit more soy sauce (low sodium Tamari). The extra vinegar helped a little, but not by much. Maybe it's the brown sugar that needs to be reduced. Served over white rice. If I make this again, it will be tweaked a bit for what we're looking for.

This is one for the book. I send first time recipes to my Kindle and if they are good they get printed and put in my recipe book.
Made this as directed except with a little less soy sauce and added onions. I only used half the chicken as there was only two of us, but made the full recipe of sauce and veggies.

I used all frozen veggies, thawed first, which made this meal super easy and quick. Served over white rice, it was delicious. Thank you for this recipe.

I  changed the amount of soy sauce  since it   was too much. I only put   1 tablespoon of soy sauce instead.  I am going to fix it  the next time with  no carrots, hubby hates carrots but, he thought the pineapple was a nice surprise

Followed other suggestions, for 4 servings used 2 breasts, used 15oz of pineapple also cooked chicken in garlic, onion and ginger then removed while cooking peppers.  Very good flavor and had plenty of sauce.

I made this recipe pretty much as it is written and loved it. I enjoyed the fact that it didn’t have all that thick, sweet, syrupy sauce that so many sweet & sour recipes do. It’s light, flavourful, easy to make and pretty fast too. It was great, just as it was, but like others have said, it would be nice with a little more sauce, especially when serving over rice (as I did). This will be easy to remedy the next time I make this.

This was good and we will make again. Like other reviewers I doubled the sauce ingredients. I also removed the chicken from the pan while stir-frying the vegetables so that the chicken would not overcook.

I really enjoyed this as did my husband.  I also added water chestnuts because I had them in the pantry and I love their crunch. Without even reading the other reviews, I doubled the sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, corn starch and tripled the garlic (we love garlic!) because I had almost 2 pounds of chicken. I will make this again but may play around with it as I felt like something was missing but couldn't figure out what it was. However, easy dish and good flavors.

Perfect for a weeknight dinner. I only had 2 small chicken breasts so I added broccoli and onions. I served it with jasmine rice that I made in my new rice cooker. It doesn't get much easier than this. Simple, quick, inexpensive, and not too many dishes to wash after a long day.

Stupid easy!!
Always brown cubed chicken first on high heat for flavor and remember it will over cook easily, becoming chewy .
Double the sauce, (vinegar, sugar, pineapple juice and/or pineapples).  This way  you can add more vegetables, any choice of vegetables work. I've found the hard way that if you want brocoli, blanch it first and add it toward the end. Otherwise, mush brocoli. 
We enjoy a little heat so I add red pepper flakes to taste. 
Skip the ground ginger, yuc!  It's too easy to use real ginger adding more flavor!
We enjoy our sweet n sour over jasmine rice ??

I made with these changes:
I saute a small sweet onion before browning chicken, I didn't have green pepper so I used 1/2 red bell, 1/2 yellow bell and 1/2 semi hot red pepper. I never use soy sauce in any recipe that calls for it because of the salt content.  . I always substitute with Worcestershire sauce. Try it you might like it
I used 3 gloves of garlic, one is never enough for me. I substituted the brown sugar with a hot and spicy honey. 
Yum yum was very good. I would highly recommend this recipe without my changes.

I chose this recipe for my culinary arts project  because I normally like this meal. It turned out good and I doubled the sauce and added another half pound of chicken. I would suggest using more chicken than the recipe says to and using the amount of ingredients for the sauce that is given.

I replaced the peppers with sugar snap peas. Next time I will marinate the chicken before cooking; it had no flavor. With those changes, this will be a 5 star recipe.

I liked this recipe, however had to listen to others and double the sauce (not the soy amount, however) and also added the 20oz can of pineapples. Added in fresh green beans and onions as well. It's a keeper for sure with the changes!

I found this recipe lacking in flavor.  We're having it left over so I added organic ketchup, more vinegar, more pineapple chunks, some red pepper flakes and chicken broth.  Already has more flavor and I have yet to heat it!

This is a very good and easy recipe. I increased the corn starch to 1.5 tablespoons and like others, used a larger can of pineapple for the liquid. I also put snow peas in with the vegetables. I will be making this again.

02-06-16 ~ Great recipe - we loved it! I doubled the sauce by using the 1/4 cup soy (I used low salt version) and using 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice as I was adding extra veggies. The veggies used: green & red peppers and carrots as the recipe called for, but I also added sliced onions, yellow & orange peppers and sugar snap peas. Served this over white sticky rice and we enjoyed a great meal that I would definitely make again.

My husband and I really liked this!  It has great flavor!  Like many other reviewers, I doubled the sauce (but not quite doubling the soy sauce).  I used 20 oz pineapple tidbits and used all the juice but not quite all the tidbits.  Next time, I plan to add cashews.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. I only used half a pound of chicken and lots of vegetables including onions and broccoli. I like to dip very small pieces of chicken in flour and then toss them in the hot oil until a little browned. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh chopped ginger instead of powdered.

It was okay, not particularly good but not bad either. Would have needed something more. More flavour, Idk. Not a keeper.

I used half the soy sauce as many people recommended it, but ended up adding much more to the final dish and also thai sweet chilli sauce, but it was just very mediocre.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was ok, but definitely wasn't "sweet and sour chicken." It tasted more like a stir-fry, and the soy sauce overpowered the whole dish.

Prepared the chicken, red and green peppers, and carrots as per recipe.  Added can of water chestnuts.  But I used a different sauce:  "Wow! Sweet and Sour Sauce".   Served over rice and made egg rolls to complete the meal.  The other sauce is much better.

This was very good, even better than the restuarant neon-red, MSG stuff.  I liked that the chicken was not fried.  I used a large can of crushed pineapple b/c that is what I had.  
I also omitted the vinegar and brown sugar and used crystalized ginger.  I used garlic powder and white onions.  I cooked the veggies first and added the chicken (so as not to over-cook) in my wok-style pan.  I added the pineapple last.
Very delicious!  I owuld never think of adding ketchup, as some suggested.

Delish  and satisfied my craving.  I cut my chicken in strip (I like uniformity),used a bit more ginger and b sugar. Next time I will double the soy/c starch mix and by hubby request a little heat.  It received raves from my hubby as is. Definitely a keeper!

OMG this may be the very best "Chinese"  type dinner I've ever made. I did add broccoli and celery to it as well as using a 20 oz can of pineapple chunks (and another 20 oz can of just the chunks) with doubling all sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce after reading other reviews. I seriously can't quit going to get bites of the leftovers. I think I could eat my weight in this stuff. Made a 2nd batch as well without the veggies or pineapple chunks, but used the pineapple juice from a 20 oz can with it for the hubby and my youngest kiddo. They both scarfed it down. Will be using this over and over. Way better than the normal just stir fry I make here for my fix wow. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe!

This was good....  
Made a few changes, but kept to the spirit of the recipe....  Added a bit more garlic and ginger, a little ketchup, and more pineapple. We like lots of sauce on the rice, so increased the soy and pineapple juice.

First time to make this, so I followed the recipe without any changes. I served the chicken over white rice. First of all i feel a prep time of "10 min" is not enough time. Also a cook time of "10 min" is understated. Took me approximately 1 hour from start to finish. Not a big deal but wanted to share. I recommend doubling the sauce as others have suggested. Also make sure you use a large/deep skillet as instructed. I will make again but will look to try and boost the flavor.

Awesome, easy, and healthy! I doubled the sauce but should have tripled it because I had 1.25 pounds of chicken. Added broccoli just because I had some.

This was delicious and I will make it again. I did double the sauce, but didn't buy a large can of pineapples because I read the reviews after I purchased the ingredients. I didn't give it five stars because it wasn't as sweet as I would have liked it, but perhaps doubling the pineapples will help. I am looking for a fast and easy recipe go-to instead of frozen pizza so I'm going to pre-cut chicken for this dish, cut and par boil the veggies and freeze it all in individual bags so I can quickly defrost and cook up instead of spending way too much money on Chinese take-out.

This was really easy to make and it turned out very flavorful. I ended up not using ginger only because I realized I didn't have any, but I don't feel like it made a huge difference. Even my picky little eaters cleaned their plates!! Delicious!!!!

Yum. Added onion because it needed to be used up. Husband and boys loved it. Agree with other reviewers that seasoning the chicken would be a good idea.

This recipe is quick. We had a craving for sweet and sour and after finding this recipe, we were eating within 30 min. I with several others that the soy sauce makes it too salty - I only used half what was called for, but will reduce it to even more next time. I doubled the cornstarch and garlic as some people recommended. I ended up doubling the brown sugar to get the right taste. We loved it and will be making it again

Great recipe! I've fixed it for many times for the fam & for company.... everyone always loves it!  The only thing I've changed is I use the larger (16oz) can of pineapples and reserve all the juice for the sauce.  Since there is more liquid I double the corn strach from 1T to 2T.

Great dish. I have made it three times now and use different combinations of veggies each time. As everyone says, doubling the sauce is a great idea if you serve this with rice, but other than that, make sure that you try it as-is at least once! It's amazing!

I'd give it 10 stars if I could :-) Excellent- I accidentally used a 20 oz can of pineapple with the juice & it came out perfect!  I'll definitely make this again!

I only had a green pepper available, which I thought was delicious. (My husband would've preferred a greater variety of vegetables, I think.) The sauce was amazing. I served it with Jasmine rice. This is a repeat, for sure.

Made exactly as written. It was good, but not fantastic. Served it over brown rice and my husband and 2 year old ate it up.

This was excellent!  I actually substituted flour for the cornstarch (2 tablespoons flour instead of 1 tablespoon cornstarch), and it worked just fine.  Another accident that turned out really tasty... I dumped in the whole can of pineapple without thinking about it, and then realized I'd overshot by 12 oz of pineapple... oops!  Maybe next time not QUITE that much, but the extra pineapple/pineapple juice tasted great to me!

This recipe turned out awesome! The only thing I altered was using fresh ginger instead of ground. It was a great alternative to greasy take-out.

Almost there...with a little adjustment it could be perfect. I used all the juice from a 20oz pinapple can. A 1/2 cup water and measurements as listed in recipe (except ginger, had none on hand). I think without the brown sugar it would have PERFECT! Besure to add some yellow and red food dye! Otherwise it's really gross looking. This is a keeper!

Made this last night per the recipe.  I added some pineapple chunks leftover in the fridge, didn't measure, but turned out great!  I would probably cut up the pineapple or use tidbits instead as per other reviews, otherwise it is a great recipe just as it is.  Served over Jasmine rice-dee-lish!

I made this last night, it was delicious!  My boyfriend is very picky when it comes to me cooking new things, we always eat the same chicken dish.  This was great!  I used a red, green, and yellow pepper as well as sliced carrots and onions.  The vegetables were great, the carrots slightly undercooked but the little bit of crunch was nice.  I doubled the liquad except the soy sauce and at first thought it was too much but when poured overtop of rice, the rice soaked up all the flavor.  I will definitly make this again, it was soooo great.

I liked it, but come to find out my husband doesn't like stir frys with bell peppers in it.  oops!  but considering that, he still thought that it was fine.  I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the soy sauce and added a little more veggies including onions and zucchini.  i used a 20 oz can of pineapple and used all the juices.

This recipe was delicious...the kind of dinner that you find yourself at the fridge door that night eating the leftovers because it's so yummy...the perfect blend of sweet and sour. All my kids loved it which is a rarity! Not hard to make at all...will definitely add it to my repertoire!

I used Buckwheat instead of rice.  Used vegies I had on hand and didn't add the browned chicken breast till near the end of the vegies cooking, so as not to overcook.  I added some not peppers and topped with chopped almonds.

Oh..... MY!!  This was so easy-peasy and DELISH!!  I used presliced red, green and yellow peeprs, sliced onions, carrot chips and sliced celery for the veggies... Along with cooked brown rice. Maybe not as much brown sugar, as I am watching my sugar intake, but this well worth it! Simple and gorgeous to look at!

This is a spectacular recipe that can be made as-is. It made 4 perfect portions and tasted... amazing. I was super impressed. I would expect to get something like this at a restaurant. I will, without a doubt, be making this again.

Just a few changes.  Added a little red pepper flakes and used a 15 oz. can of pineapple.  Also, doubled vinegar, brown sugar and corn starch.  Very pretty and a delicious dish.

We thought this was just ok, not the flavor we were looking for with sweet and sour.

Without a doubt, the BEST sweet and sour chicken we've ever had- even better than any restraunt! We both had seconds and I cannot wait to have the left overs for lunch! I took the other's advice and doubled the vinegar, brown sugar and pineapple (20 oz). I did not increase the soy sauce but did add about 2 T. of Ketchup. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will be a new family favorite!

My husband and I both thought this recipe was very salty.  Maybe it was because I only put one pepper in and omitted the carrots.  Also I just guessed on how much pineapple and juice since I only had a larger can so maybe I didn't put enough juice in.   I think if I try this again I would put celery to help with the saltiness as well as more pineapple and juice.  Overall this was a very quick and easy recipe.

Just tried this one I was looking for a stir fry that had all the ingredients I had on hand. Well it was yummy, quick and easy. I only changed two things and that was forgetting the garlic and adding some peanut halves for crunch

This was delicious! We were looking for a quick stirfry and this was perfect. We added one chopped red onion & 8 oz of snow peas; due to the extra veggies, we tripled the ingredients for the sauce (except only doubled the soy sauce & pineapple with juice). For some heat, we added a tbsp of Asian garlic chili sauce to the sauce; we also browned the chicken with minced garlic & crushed red pepper flakes. Served over brown rice. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

based on other reviews I used a larger can of pineapple tidbits.  I think I did everything else the same.  Thought there wasn't really enough sauce.  I like saucy sweet sour chicken.

I made this recipe adding some onion, larger can of pineapple and a heaping tablespoon of ketchup as others had mentioned.  My family loved it.  No leftovers.  One of my sons requested I make it again in a couple of days.  A family hit.  Thank you!!!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and its good.  I did add a dash of ketchup so it have a reddish hue but I think the ketchup also makes it more tangy which is a bonus.

This stuff is great!  Only thing I did differently than the original recipe stated was double the sauce (except for the soy sauce as another reviewer suggested).  Next time I will keep the soy the same and see how it is.  Definitely get a 20oz can of pineapple for the extra juice!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was middle-of-the-road good. It was definitely missing that little tangy kick, and after reading the reviews, I did what I thought I would never do to a dish like this... I gave it a squirt of ketchup. It just seemed wrong to do that, but it actually helped the flavor. Next time, I will try a stronger vinegar (I used a mild rice vinegar this time), and if that doesn't help then I'll keep searching for another recipe.

Fantastic! The only change I made was used pineapple tidbits instead of the chunks and used a larger can.  I brought leftovers to work and my co-workers were wondering who ordered chinese! When they found out it was my leftovers, several wanted to take a bite and then begged for the recipe! One single dad came back to me the following day explaining that his kids ate every bite and asked for him to make more!  It's a wonderful, easy recipe that I can't wait to make again and again!

This is a very good recipe, but I think a little tweaking makes it better.  I doubled the sauce except for the soy sauce (using a 20-ounce can of pineapple tidbits) and added a little water because I don't like it too thick.  I cooked it a bit longer than the recipe called for so the veggies would be less raw.  I will leave out the carrots next time, and I want to try adding onion.  I served it over rice.

This recipe was very good although I did make a few changes based on other reviews. When stir-frying, I sprinkled the chicken with ground red pepper to give it a little spicyness. I added sliced onion to the vegetables. And I doubled the sauce and added 1/2c ketchup to it. Also, I used a 20 oz. can of pineapple. Served with white rice and there was plenty of sauce to spoon over the rice. I'm not sure if the original recipe would be 5 stars because I didn't follow it exactly but with these changes it turned out well.

This was alright..I thought the chicken and pineapple went real well together but the sauce was not strong enough for me. Ive made sweet and sour meatballs that had half grape jelly and half chillie sauce. Maybe that will work...Thanks anyways.

This is a great recipe.  My picky husband loved it even though he asked "Isn't it supposed to be breaded."  Will be a regular at my house.  Did follow the advice of others and added a little ketchup and not as much soy sauce.

Very nice. I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms, next time I will add broccoli as well. Still it was very good, will definitely make it again.

Really easy and tasty. I couldn't double the sauce because I only had one small can of pineapple, but I did add a little extra sugar and rice vinegar and only the 1/4 cup of soy sauce and the soy sauce was still pretty strong. It's a keeper.

Great Recipe. Did this recipe for my high school's cooking elective class. Kids had a great time with it. Cut down on the garlic though, but other than that followed recipe to the T. Can't wait to try it at home! Thanks!

This recipe was awesome!  I didn't put as much ginger in as the recipe called for and I used low sodium Soy Sauce and it was great!  Next time I'll add a bit more sauce and pineapples, but those are the only changes I will make.

This was great.  I added fresh mushrooms and an onion.  Also doubled the sauce and added ketchup as others have suggested  I will make this again for sure.

I added a little more soy sauce to the mix as I was serving it over rice.  It turned out fabulous.  My husband said it was better than many restaurant dishes.  My 7 year old actually ate the rice with the sauce on it...unheard of in my home.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious and my husband gave it a 10 on the picky husband scale of food :).  I made some minor changes, mainly doubling the sauce as recommended by other reviewers and I also sauted some scallions along with the other veggies.  And just because I had fresh ginger at hand, I threw about 1 TBS finely chopped in there as well in addition to the ground ginger.  Came out extremely yummy!

This recipe was a hit in our house!!  The flavor is incredible and the only change I would make is always doubling the sauce.......it's just right. Perhaps add an onion.  Thanks for the great recipe.

maybe instead of the soy, add  1 tablespoon of tomato sauce and 3 tablespoons of water, to get the red colouring and it will also produce more sauce to go over rice. little salt to balance the sweetness and sourness.

Very good recipe.  I had some leftover fresh pineapple and a chicken breast in my fridge - so I threw in a few other ingredients and viola!  The sauce really makes this recipe.  I didn't have carrots, so I subbed in some fresh broccoli - excellent! - and some green onions.  And I used the first ripe green pepper from our garden in this dish.  The only bummer was that the chicken, when I pulled it out, smelled and felt not-quite-right, so I ended up having sweet & sour veggies instead of sweet & sour chicken.  It was still really good and I will make this again (next time with chicken).  It's a good recipe to use up whatever fresh veggies you have on hand.

This recipe is fantastic.  The meal is easy to prepare but certainly doesn't taste that way.  My whole family enjoyed it and it's now in my regular rotation. Thanks!

What a wonderful recipe! It was so easy to make and not very expensive either. The only thing I did different was I added a bit more sugar. I have thought about making a batch of this and taking it by my favorite chinese restaurant! I bet they would like it. Thanks for the recipe.
