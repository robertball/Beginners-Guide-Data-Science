This recipe is great.  Placki (that's the correct spelling) are very popular in Poland.  They are quick to make and delicious.  They do have a specific texture, but if you're open for a different cusine (that's the purpose afterall) then you'll love them!!!

Nice recipe,but my polish ancestors probably never heard of garlic. Skipped it and used grated oninon in place of the powder. Tasty served with applesauce.

the recipe calls for grated potatoes, you can do this in the food processor and throw in 1/4 medium onion, this will taste like the origional. searve with sour cream or jus a little salt.

1st recipe I found for Platski. My mom used to make them all the time and I haven't had any since she passed on. They bring back fond memories and this recipe for Platski is a keeper.
Thank you Holley. Note for Dorothy June try it again.

My Polish Mom served these to us for lunch.  She did not put onion powder or garlic or paprika.  The way we ate these was with sugar sprinkled on then
we rolled them up.  What a great lunch snack.

Good-took a few tries to get the hang of it. Using a non-stick pan definetly helps. Next time I'll add chives and maybe sour cream.

I rather thought this was a lot of work for a not very palatable dish.  Perhaps I didn't get them thin enough but they did not cook in the center and we got bites of raw potato.  I might try them again and attempt to get them thinner but one more failure and this recipe will be chunked.  Sorry...

I have been making the Lithuanian version of this since my grandfather taught me at a very young age..about 9yrs old. The only difference is that we did not use any garlic or onion powder or paprika.  We always grated the onion. This recipe worked great with a whole small onion instead and adding all ingredients to food processor.  Pulse until smooth. My grandad used bacon fat to fry in cast iron skillet and I didn't have  any so I used a little butter with about 1/4c tsp of olive oil.. fried beautifully but I also added salt during frying / light salt on each side. Also set timer for 5min per side until they look dry on uncooked side and flipped. 
I used all ingredients except onion powder. They are addictive and great with a collapse of cottage cheese or soft yolk egg on top for breakfast! Thank you for your recipe we enjoyed it very much (med-hi heat). 
I submitted a pic of one side cooked and side not flipped yet in pictures! Takes 5 min in food processor and same delicious texture and flavor!  A must for snacks, side dish or breakfast!  TRY IT!!

My daughter grew up with these (minus the onion powder) - she loved them.  Her dad made them every time.

I had trouble getting my pancakes to be thin.  I don’t think I shredded them thinly enough; I shredded them using the “medium” holes in the shredder rather than the smallest ones.  This seemed like a good recipe, but it didn’t exactly suit my palate.

These were tasty. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and made them a little thicker than they were probably meant to be. But, they were still delicious. I cut the recipe in half so ended up with two big "pancakes". I put one on a plate sprinkled it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and then put the other on on top of that and put more cheese on top. Served it as a side dish in the shape of a piece of pie with the Neat Sloppy Joe recipe from this site. Will add this to the recipe box!
