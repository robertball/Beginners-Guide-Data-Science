I made this nice recipe as directed except I used fresh pineapple.   We found it to be too sweet for chips, so I added in the juice of half of a lime.   That added just the right amount of tart for us.   Thank you for a nice recipe.

I would have never thought that hot sauce would taste so good on watermelon and pineapple. Keep extra hot sauce on the side. This is a keeper.
