Very good! My friend and I made this for our New Year's Eve dinner and everyone raved! We added cranberries as well for color. Turned out great, would make again.

A restaurant in Memphis serves a salad like this, which I love. This was good, too, but too much trouble for a simple salad! Use balsamic or raspberry vinagrette instead. It's good with uncookec pears, too. Does need to be presented on individual plates.

MMMMMMMMMMM............This sounds just like a recipe that I use.  The only difference is that I toast the walnuts in a skillet and I have not tried it with port wine.........sounds good though! The combination of toasted walnuts and gorgonzola cheese make this a winner.  If you like the taste of blue cheese you will love this.  It is also really easy to make.

We liked this a great deal and thought it went very well with quiche lorraine. Used regular blue cheese since that was all that I had. Looked very pretty as well.

We tried with blackberry wine and was very tasty.  Although I used a soft yellow sweet pear and I think it would have been better with a firm green sour pear.  Will most likely make again.

I made this salad with the White Wine Vinegrette recipe on this site and the pairing was wonderful!  So easy and good.  I think I have a new favorite salad!

It takes a minute to prepare this salad but it is worth it. This would be a beautiful salad to serve at a dinner party.It is both tasty and elegant. It takes time but is not hard to make.

As others have said, this is probably better as a plated salad, but due to the size of our group I had to just toss it in a large bowl.  Although it wasn't as pretty as it could have been, it still tasted great. I had a couple of non-blue cheese eaters so I served the Gorgonzola on the side, but it was much better with it than without.   I will definitely make this again.
