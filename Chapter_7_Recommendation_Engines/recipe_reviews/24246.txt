I tweaked this recipe a bit based on what was in my pantry (no paste-used sauce). I also added soy sauce (2T) and used the juice from a can of pineapples as part of the water. I also let this simmer for about 20 minutes before I added the cornstarch. My VERY picky 8 yr old (whom this was made for) thought it was better than the sweet and sour sauce from (insert fast food restaurant name here ):) so it was absolutely a success and will be made again. To reiterate another reviewer - cornstarch must be mixed with a little water/juice before adding to recipes. Also bring it to a full boil after adding to get it to thicken. Thank you!

Awesome sauce! I did as other reviewers suggested and used the pineapple juice (into which I mixed 3 heaping tablespoons of corn starch) and soy sauce. I simmered it for 20 minutes. My family loved it! A keeper for sure!Thank you

Terrific S&S sauce!  I added some soy sauce for depth & saltiness and some chopped green onion and bell pepper and it turned out just as I like it(and my kids RAVED about it!).  I was skeptical about using tomato paste because all other recipes I had seen used ketchup for the "red", but it was really very good.  For those of you who worry about it being too tomatoey - it tastes just like really good Sweet & Sour from the Chinese restaurant. Thank you.

This is a great recipe!  I used 8 ounces of tomato sauce because I didn't have any tomato paste on hand.  Also used 8 ounces of crushed pineapple instead of tidbits for the same reason.  :)  I added this sauce to a basic chicken stir fry recipe and served it over rice.  Yummy!!!

This is so quick and easy!  I use the pineapple juice from the tidbits and add water to make 2 cups. (sometimes I half the recipe as it makes quite a bit) I also use ketchup in place of the tomato paste, it adds an extra zing.  While the sauce is cooking, I bake some breaded chicken pieces and sautee some bell peppers and onions.  Mix it all together and serve over hot rice for a "20 minute meal".

This sauce is great.  It was my first attempt at homemade swwet & sour sauce and I must say I was a bit apprehensive! I cut the recipe in half (there are just the two of us) and it still made plenty.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar and you couldn't tell the difference.  The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star was because I had to strain the cornstarch lumps out of the sauce.  I would definitely recommend mixing the cornstarch with water first before adding.  Otherwise the flavor, color and consistency of the sauce was awesome.  I also used it with the pork patties submitted by Linda on this site and my husband has now requested this combo be a regular in our house.  We will never buy store-bought sweet & sour sauce again.  Thanks for the post!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. I have never had sweet and sour sauce better anywhere, in a jar or at a restuarant. I usually have trouble getting things to thicken for some reason, so I was worried about this the sauce thickening enough to use. I didn't have to worry at all. It tasted delicous and was the perfect consistency. I used tomato sauce because I didn't have tomato paste. I also stained out the pineapple because I didn't like the fact of eating the pineapple in the sauce. Great recipe Debbie!

I agree with STEVERAMSEY.  The sauce was easy and good for your regular order-in Chinese food...  and the colour was Fantastic!,  but if I'm going to cook something from scratch, I want a little more Zing!  

It's a generous recipe, so I made only 1/2 with the following changes:  1 c chicken broth(not water), 1/3 c rice vinegar(not white), 3/4 c sugar(half white, half brown), 1 whole can peaches, 2 T cornstarch, a few turns of freshly-ground black pepper.  

The sauce bubbled happily away with the juice from the peaches and when it was thick, I gently tossed a chopped, sauteed onion; 1 lb of cooked, diced chicken; a chopped, sauteed, orange bell pepper, and the peaches in.  Next time, I'll try a fresh, tart pineapple.

I really liked this recipe.  For the hassle though, I think I will just go to the grocery store and buy the bottled version...it tastes almost exactly the same (this is better).  Thanks for the post.

This stuff is great, perfect for dipping egg rolls.  I didn't have pineapple in my pantry, but I did have mandarin oranges (also had a can of cranberry sauce - I'll try that next time because i bet any sweet/sour fruit will work great) so used those instead.

I also suggest that the very first ingredient you start to work with is the corn starch and then start adding a little liquid to mix into the consistency of a thick mud. Then add your tomato paste (or as in my case catchup) and mix that good before you add the rest of the liquid.  I also pureed my oranges (pineapple, cranberry, whatever) and added that too before adding the rest of the water and vinegar & sugar.  No lumps, smooth as silk that way.

This recipe was excellent! I cut it in half and it still made plenty (more than enough for three servings). I used pineapple juice instead of water, and didn't include the pineapple tidbits. I also put the cornstarch in the pineapple juice first so that the sauce wouldn't be lumpy.

I put the sauce on top of stir fried veggies and rice, and it was really authentic. Tastes just like the real thing! I highly recommend it!

This was really good!  Like other reviewers, I used tomato sauce (didn't have paste on hand) and also used the pineapple juice for some of the water.  I had chunk pineapple, so I chopped it up.

To get a more "restaurant" color, I added about 4 drops of neon pink food coloring.  It was just right.

I served this over the Kickin' Meatballs and white rice.  I had enough left for about two cups to go with a different recipe - so I froze it.

The tomato is lost in all the sugar, in case someone is wondering about it in the sauce.  It just gives it a nice body.

Oh, and I also mixed the corn starch with a bit of water before adding to the hot ingredients.

Unless I seriously tweak this recipe next time, I'm pretty sure my hunt for the perfect sweet & sour sauce is not over yet.  It was alright, but all that tomato paste made it taste way too much like ketchup!  I could see maybe adding a few tablespoons of the paste, even up to half a can, but the whole can made it WAY too tomatoey.  Kind of weird.

This came out with a strong tomato taste to it.  I ended up adding more water, double the pineapple (with juice) and added more sugar to try to balance the tomato and it is still too dominant.   Next time I will skip the paste or maybe just use 2 ounces.

Update:  5 star with changes.   I completely skipped the tomato paste and added about a tablespoon of ketchup to it for color and the slight bitter taste of tomato.   It came out really good.  :)

We made it as the recipe stated this time but next time will use pineapple juice in place of the water to make it a little more tangy and will substitute apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar. Hopefully then it will be a 5. It was just a tad "tomatoey" as is.

What I liked about this recipe was that the ingredients are what most people have on hand, and it was simple to make. What I didn't like about this recipe, was the taste was heavy on the tomato side.
After making the sauce and trying it, I added some crushed red pepper flakes and a pinch of cayanne pepper to zip it up, then I threw it all in the blender and pureed it. If I make it again, I will use less tomato paste, or substitute catsup in its place. Over all a decent sauce.

Pretty good.  I used this with some homemade Crab Rangoon and it was yummy.  Next time I'd use slightly less tomato.  NOTE the amount this recipe makes - I stupidly overlooked it and ended up with enough sweet and sour sauce for an army.  If you're drizzling it over whole entrees it should be fine (though still excessive), but if you're just using it for a dipping sauce, consider cutting the recipe (unless you want to have a whole bottle to save).

Super easy!  This recipe will be used again and again in my house.  It's low in calories as well as sodium.  I strained out the pineapple as it was cooling the first time I made this.  On my second try I used crushed pineapple instead that gave it a great texture.  I also added a few tablespoons to crushed red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

This was really good and quick.  I used 1 cup of pineapple juice and 1 cup of water.  I didn't have a 6 oz can of tomato paste, but 2 tbsp of paste in my freezer (I never use an entire can so freeze per tbsp), so used that and a dollop of ketchup.  I had fresh pineapple so used that in lieu of canned.  I had checked out a recipe for authentic sweet and sour sauce which called for rice vinegar so used that rather than distilled white vinegar... supposed to give a more authentic taste.  It was GOOD.  No refined foods in my house so used sugar in the raw.. a little less than 1 1/2 cups.  I tossed the cornstarch in as the directions stated and used a wire wisk to stir and insure no lumps were present.  It came out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for meatballs and everyone said it was better than a restaurant. I used 1 cup water and 1 cup pineapple juice, and used half brown sugar for the sugar. I would recommend only 1/2 cup vinegar, it is a little overpowering but an excellent sauce!!

This was GREAT!  I used rice vinegar, used 3/4 c brown sugar (and may cut back more next time), used the pineapple juice from a large can of pineapples instead of water and a couple splashes of soy sauce.  I threw some of the pineapple chunks in the sauce (just like the chinese restaurant)--it was awesome!  I paired this with the fried butterflly shrimp on this site....oh boy are you in for a treat!

This sauce is easy to make and turns out great.  We like it so much better than what most restaurants have!  I make a half recipe.  It freezes well too.

Amazing! I can't believe how great this tastes. I was a bit worried at first because the color resembled tomato soup, really light reddish-orange color. However, once it simmered for the fifteen minutes, the color and consistency were perfect. This is a keeper for sure. Thanks!

Great sauce! I served it over Kickin' Meatballs, from this site, and white rice, and it went great! I did change this recipe a bit though. I realized, after it was too late, I didn't have any pinapple, which turned out to be fine. Didn't really miss it at all. I also added 3 tblsp good quality dark Soya Sauce, which added a nice flavour, I think. Finally, the only tomatoe paste I had was an Italian one, meaning that it was seasoned with Italian spices. It was pretty good, though next time I would use a plain, or perhaps garlic tomatoe paste. Oh ya, speaking of garlic, I also added a couple tsps of powdered garlic. Yum!!! :)

A+ It turned out perfect...my husband raved and my picky 2 year old devoured it up!  Make sure and take a small portion of the water and mix with cornstartch first before adding to rest of mixture, and it will turn out clump-free!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This was the greatest sweet and sour sauce EVER!!!  I will NEVER buy S&S again!!!  I added the water and the cornstarch together in a jar with a lid and shook the mixture until it was lump free.  I used crushed pineapple in place of tidbits.  Then I went on as directed.  I served the sauce with chicken fingers for a quick and easy Sweet and Sour chicken that my kids would eat.  The next day I used the left over sauce for chicken wings.  Delicious both times….  Half of the recipe was the right amount for the two entrées.  Bravo!!!!

"Oh, it was so good! Rate it 5 stars, please!" said my 7 year old just now.  She is a major sweet & sour fan, ordering that everytime we get Chinese food--she knows her S&S sauces.  The whole family was in unison, though:  better than store bought and many restaurants as well.  We used it for dipping homemade eggrolls, a great combo.

This sweet and sour sauce is the best! I don't use the pineapple, just because I dislike it. The sauce is by far the best dipping sauce. Thanks Debbie.

Wow! this is absolutely yummy! Since I had no tomato paste on hand I used Heinz ketchup. I love this sweet and tangy sauce. I use it for dipping with, "Baked Chicken Nuggets," from this website. Thank you myrite for sharing this sauce.

This was pretty good,.. we had to add some soy sauce to it afterwards, but that could be because we are used to saltier foods.

The flavor in this is just right. I've tried several sweet & sour sauce recipes & have been disappointed with them all until now, as they all had too much of a hot ketchup flavor. The flavor of this sauce is exactly what I was looking for, even without the pineapple. I can't wait to make it again with some pineapple juice in place of the water.

This was EXCELLENT and my family LOVED it! I made the recipe twice, once exactly as written and one with 1 Cp pineapple juice, 1 Cp water. The way written is a tad more on the sour side while the other way is a bit sweeter.

A good general recipe to follow. Add some green bell pepper & onion chunks for some colour and flavour. Keep and use the pineapple juice instead of the sugar. I like the use of tomato paste instead of ketchup, more old school.

I absolutely LOVE sweet and sour sauce but I don't eat chicken, so I don't get to eat it very often. This recipe is SUPERB and totally fixed my craving. I made it exactly as the recipe called, only adding a dash of soy sauce, some jalapeno peppers and some scallions. I put it over my veggie chicken and brown rice. I am so happy, you have totally made my day with this recipe. I have lots of leftovers and will use it over tofu. Thank you!!

This was a really easy and great companion to our egg rolls. I did make a few tweeks.   I had a cup of Chicken broth that needed used so used it and 1 cup water, and subsituted apple cider vinegar (didn't have any white on hand), and omitted the pineapples as my boys to like them.  Will defiantley add to our recpie box (with the changes of course)  Gave it 4 stars we though it was 5 star with the changes and didn't make it excactly as written

This was a good pairing for the "Best Eggrolls" on this site.  I used the juice of the pineapple (not the tidbits) and cut the sweetness with a few shakes of soy sauce while it was simmering.  Next time I will cut this recipe in half because it makes so much!

This is incredible! I've been looking for a Sweet and Sour recipe for ages and I've found it.  I did substitute ketchup for the tomato paste and added additional pineapple juice to taste.  This recipie makes a HUGE amount so if you just want it for a setting for one meal of a family of 4 or 5 cut it in half if you are using it for a dipping sauce. Thank you myrite!

I love this sauce! It tastes just like the chinese restaurant. The only difference is that I normally don't add the pineapple tidbits. It's really good either way though.

Quick,easy, and tasty. Besides just adding pineapple I also added a can of green chiles to make it more of a sweet, sour, spicy sauce.

Great recipe. Better than most sweet and sour sauce because I could adjust the sweet (those are always too sweet for my family's taste). I use ketchup as other people had recommended and cut the sugar in half (used all brown sugar). I only made a half recipe which makes a bunch. I'm gonna see if it freezes ok since we didn't use it all. I used it with the Best Egg Rolls recipe from here...great take out meal without the cost. Our kids gave the whole meal a "Definitely make this again, Mom" vote. That's 5 stars for sure. Also the leftovers are going in their lunch boxes tomorrow!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was about as good as it gets!!!! The whole family loved this sauce. We made it for egg roles. I split the sauce dish. The one I left alone. To the other, I added some ground up habanero pepper. That added some bite! Great recipe!!!

This was awsome. I added green pepper, onion and carrots to the sauce while it was cooking, I also was going to add a can of pineapple chunks at the end so I  poured the juice into the sauce at this time.then I added the cornstarch and pineapple chunks after the veggies were cooked al dente. I followed a few reviews by using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I used 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar.

This is the best sweet and sour sauce i have ever tasted or made for that matter. It was easy too. I added cooked cubed chicken, red and green peppers, onion, water chestnuts and pineapple. I also used the drained pineapple juice and 1/4 cup soy sauce as part of the 2 cups water called for. I also added 3 drops of sesame oil which i love in all asian cooking. It makes a pretty good size batch but we still had no leftovers at all. Yum! This is a keeper for sure!!!!

This recipe is great, and it's so easy to make!  I use it in the slow cooker for sweet and sour pork, it works great for this too!  Excellent recipe!

This recipe is good, but be aware that it has a strong ketchup taste to it. I like my sweet and sour sauce to be more on the sweet side and less like ketchup.

With modifications to this recipe, this is the best recipe for sweet and sour sauce! I did not use any pineapple or pineapple juice, used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, and added about a tablespoon of soy sauce. This recipe is better than the stuff they serve in restaurants. Will DEFINITELY be making it again!

Excellent!  This was so easy to make and tasted better than any other sweet and sour sauce I have ever tasted!  The only change I made is that I used the pineapple juice that I drained off of the pineapple to replace some of the water (probably only 1/4 cup-- didn't want to waste it).  I served this sauce over Sweet and Sour Pork Patties (recipe submitted by Linda on allrecipes.com).  After pouring sauce on pork patties, I added about 1/2 of a bell pepper and 1/2 of an onion- both cut in very large chunks.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Yum!  Now what I'm going to do with the remaining 46 servings is beyond me at the moment, but I'll figure it out.  It does have a tomato taste, so if you aren't a big fan you may want to eliminate the paste or cut it down a bit.  I had to whisk this a long time in order to mix in all the tomato paste, and I made a bit of a slurry with the cornstarch and some of the liquids before pouring it in the pan to avoid lumps.  I also used crushed pineapple, and it was fine.  I may or may not use chunks next time--I guess it depends on what I'm making it for.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good basic sauce recipe.  It comes together very easily and thickens nicely.  I didn't like the chunks of pineapple- maybe next time I'd just use pineapple juice instead of water and get the flavor that way.  We had these with egg rolls.

First let me say that I was extremely skeptical over this recipe because of the tomato paste. I mean really, tomato paste in a sweet and sour sauce??? Well, what I've learned over the years will allrecipes is that you can't go wrong with 4-5 star recipes with 20+ reviews so I tried it.
This was great! I'm so happy I made it, w/o changing anything! After tasting it I pushed the limit and added some more pineapple, I shouldn't have. It was perfect from the beginning! I tried another recipe the other day which asked for food coloring. It too was good (though it got way too thick afterwards) but I'd rather have natural color (tomato paste) then have to add food dyes. YUMMO!

This was a very good sauce paired with some frozen egg rolls I had sitting in the freezer. Instead of adding the pineapple tidbits I added just the juice to help thin the the sauce a bit since it was a little too thick for my liking. All in all it was a good, very quick, go to sweet and sour sauce thanks for sharing!

Wonderful sauce. I used ketchup in place of tomato paste and splenda in place of sugar. I did at least double the amount of cornstarch than the recipe called for, at least for our taste in thickness. Very, very good. It was perfect with the Local Kline Wontons from this site.

YUM!  Just what I needed.  I also used the drained pineapple juice and added water to 2C.  I had no white vinegar, so I used a combination of apple cider and rice vinegar.  Came out perfect!  I used it for sweet and sour kielbasa over rice and my family loved it.  It is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

After reading such rave reviews about this recipe, I chose it over all the other sweet & sour sauces.  What a mistake!  This tasted like watered down tomato soup! Not sure what everyone else was doing differently but I followed the recipe exactly and came up with something like runny ketchup.

UPDATE: 3/May/10 I have made this recipe a few times now. This recipe workes well with pork. I did make a change. I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 6oz can of paste and water. I used my blending stick to puree the tomatoes. I also added the 2 TBSP Soy Sauce. I finished the recipe as directed. It turned out great. It is more common for me to have canned tomatoes than tomato paste.

I have to give this 5 because hubby loves this sauce and thinks it tastes authentic.  1st time making sweet and sour sauce.  At the last minute I didn't have pineapple (which I usually have) and actually blended drained fruit cocktail......hehe!  I would make it again with the fruit.  P.S.  This recipe makes ALOT of sauce.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  It was my first attempt at making sweet and sour sauce instead of buying it, but the tomato taste was way too strong and it never reached a thick enough consistency.  I added the pineapple tidbits, but after the sauce was done, I wished that I would have either added crushed pineapple or omitted the pineapple altogether.  I will continue to look for a recipe that fits what I am looking for!

This was very good...just lacking "something" but I don't know what.  I used 15 oz. pineapple (and used the juice as part of the water).  I added 1/4 cup more white vinegar as it had a tomato-sweet taste.  I will try this again but maybe using all pineapple juice for more flavor.  And, yes, it made a lot--enough for 3 meals...which is good, I'm keeping the leftover sauce in the fridge for a "quick meal!"

Great recipe. Very close to what they have in store deli's. I didn't want pineapple pieces so I reduced the water a little and added pineapple juice in it's place. Had a little bit too much of a tomato taste so next time I will reduce to 3/4 of the can called for.

Very good sauce! It's not as good as the kind you get at the store but it is as good as the chinese take out sauce! I can't believe how incredibly easy it was to make! It definitely took me less than 15 minutes to make up. I used this with the Sweet & Sour Pork Patties, and it was perfection! Thanks Debbie!

This is very good, but it makes a lot! I used it as a dipping sauce for chicken tenders. It kind of reminds me of the sweet and sour sauce you get at fast food restaurants. It is far better than that fake-looking pink stuff some Chinese restaurants serve.

This sauce is so simple to make and tastes just like what you'd find in a Chinese restaurant, if not better.  I did not alter the recipe at all and it turned out great.

I was skeptical about the tomato paste but tried the recipe as written and think it's a Keeper.  I had read all 233 comments before trying it and was amazed at how many complained of lumpy corn starch.  If the corn starch is added before turning on the heat as the recipe calls for it whips up nicely and no lumps. Thanks a bunch and I'll use it again, probably many times.  Yes my friends liked it too and I don't think I'd change a thing.  Nonna G

It was really good. Definitely better than take out sweet and sour sauce. Easy to make as well.

This is a good recipe. So much cheaper than buying the jars in the store. I tried to cut back on the sugar, but ended up adding more. Will just follow the recipe next time - except using the juice from the pinapple as several recommended as part of the water. And used crushed pinapple instead of tidbits.

I made these changes and it turned out well. I don't care for sweet so I decreased the sugar to 1 c.  I omitted the pineapple tidbits and instead used 1 c. pineapple juice and reduced the water amount to 1 c. I used the chunk pineapple to add to the recipe "Sweet and Sour Pork Patties" with the addition of other ingredients like cut up green and red pepper, onion, bamboo shoots, and sliced water chestnuts.

I made this today. It was good. I only had pineapple juice which was fine but came out too sweet. Next time I would add it in a little at a time until I got it to my liking. I tempered it with some soy sauce. And I didn't

Made a double batch with homemade meatballs and rice. Reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups (instead of 3 for a double batch) INCREDIBLE!!! Best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had!!

I have an allergy to a widely used preservative that is found in most food colorings that Chinese restaurants feel they need to add to their S&S sauces. I made this recipe in hopes that it would fulfill my craving for my favorite Chinese dish and it tastes better than any restaurants I've had in the past. I did use some of the pineapple juice in place of water like other reviewers suggested. Will definitely be making this again!

Awesome!  After our favorite chinese restaurant closed in town, I have been missing his unique take on Sweet and Sour chicken.  This recipe is the closest I have found, and is so much better than any of the remaining restaraunts to choose from.  Will try to replace some of the water with pineapple juice (instead of using tidbits - hubby hates pineapple pieces), and maybe a touch less sugar.  Cooked with tyson's honey battered chicken nuggets, and this was a big hit for my son's birthday party (bizarre since he requested the infamous rice with "red sauce").

This was a good starting point for me, as I made several changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Added a shake of ground ginger, some red pepper flakes and a couple of shakes of hot sauce.  I used ketchup instead of tomato paste.  And added about a tablespoon of honey and sesame seeds.  I had no pineapple, so I left it out.   This sauce was used over a chicken stir-fry, sweet/sour with a bit of heat.  Very good with the additions/subtractions I made.  Like I said, it was a good starting point for me...then I became creative.

I followed the recipe exactly and the color and consistancy turned out fine. However, there was a powerful tomato soup taste. I added some grape jelly to sweeten it up some. Don't think I'll make again. Thanx tho.

This is the best I have ever tasted. I did add about a tsp of fresh ginger and a couple of shakes of soy sauce. I also did not drain the pinapple. I put the whole can in.

This recipe was an amazing success! I did change it up a little bit - I used the juice from the pineapple with only a few of the tidbits, added a pinch of kosher salt, and a splash of rosie's cherry grenadine (I didn't have a jar of maraschino cherry juice.)

It was quick and easy, but way way too vinegary for our tastes.  I fixed it by adding about 1/2 cup sugar, then it tasted right, but we are not vinegar people.

we tried this for egg roll dipin's.  tasty.

couple of things:

we don't do a lot of sugar so we took someone's advice and used pineapple juice instead of water, and then added agave a bit at a time until it was the right sweet for us.  it turned out to about 1/3-1/2 c.

we also used rice vinegar.

I really liked this recipe. It needed a little something more tho to taste like my favorite chinese restaurant's sauce. So i used pineapple nectar, and a little more than was called for, and 2tsp minced fresh ginger.  That made it perfect!

This was very good. I made some alterations based on what i had. I used balsalmic vinegar instead of white, which made it a brown color. I also used ketchup instead of tomato paste, and I added pineapples. Will def use this again!

I will never buy s & s sauce again. This was fantastic! I used crushed pineapple instead of tidbits Made as directed it was a little to sweet and not enough sour, for our taste but that was easily fixed with additional vinegar. Served with Cindi's Egg Rolls (from this site), beer battered chicken nuggets and rice. Perfection. Everyone said it tasted just like the s & s sauce served at Chinese restaurants.

Delicious! We made a massive amount of it and put it on a pork-and-Asian-veg stirfry. Mmmm! Low effort too, and cheap ingredients. Plus masses of sauce meaning it was good to keep and use for another meal, and would be easy to produce enough for a large dinner party. Will definitely make this again.

I make this recipe (by family request) like at least once a month. I have found that using crushed pineapple, or using a stick blender after it is all completed. It speads out the sweetness.

Excellent! Like others, used the drained pineapple juice as part of the water. All ingredients, except cornstarch, were brought to boil. I added some of the liquid to the cornstarch then put it back in the pot and continued to boil and stir until thickened. Poured a cupful on top of turkey meatloaf before baking....yummm....

This is realy a great sauce.  I started it with 1/2 onion, 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/2 green bell pepper chopped and sauteed, then I added the pineapple juice mixed with water to make 2 cups and the other ingredients.  I used 3/4 C reg white sugar and 3/4 C brown sugar, instead of all white, and I only had a little bit of tomatoe paste left from something else so I made up the difference with ketchup.  My family loved it!  I served it over some vegetarian meatballs at a potluck and the dish got slicked up!  Maybe I'll post the vegetarian meatball recipe later.

Super easy, makes a ton.  Followed recipe plus used the drained pineapple juice with water.  A little heavy on tomatoe taste, think I would use less and also use rice vinegar next time.

I had never made sweet and sour sauce before, but I wanted to use it to go along with the recipe for Pork Spring Rolls on here (which, by the way, are AWESOME!). I used the pineapple chunks in the sauce, but it came out very sweet, so I offset it with a little (asian) garlic chile sauce (the one I used in the spring rolls, in case you'r e making them too), and some cayenne pepper to give it a kick. I also added two little packets (2 Tbsp) of soy sauce (like you get with take out), as another person suggested. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it.

This was very yummy but I chose to cut the vinegar WAY back (vinegar is one of those things where a little bit goes a long way so I knew from the start I didn't want 2/3 cup in my sauce...lol). I only used about 1/4 cup (maybe not even that much) But other than that this is an excellent recipe for sweet and sour sauce.

I used tomato paste.  Use juice from 8 oz. pineapple (crushed or diced) and measure it with water.

Excellent!  At the last moment, we made grilled shrimp, and with no sauce available, I found this.  I had to use tomato sauce instead of paste because that is what I had on hand.  This came out as exactly what I wanted!

Well it doesn't get much easier than this! I used crushed pineapple and ketchup as substitutions, and added a dash of soy sauce. Great results.  Too sweet for me, so will adjust next time.  Also - the recipe is huge!  Will likely cut recipe in half next time.  Will try freezing in the meantime and see how well it holds up.

This was amazing! I will never buy sweet and sour sauce at the grocery again. I did have to alter it a bit to fit what I had in the pantry..I used 8 oz tomato sauce instead of paste,1 small can crushed pineapple (including juice), reduced the water to 1 cup with the 3 tbs cornstarch dissolved in it, added 3 tbs soy sauce...simmered it all on the stove for 20 minutes...it was perfect! Great basic recipe for sweet and sour sauce...I am definitely using this again.

I used pineapple juice for some of the water.  Ended up being 1 cup juice, 1 cup water.  The end result was too sweet for our tastes, so I added some soy sauce, zesty Mrs. Dash, salt, and more vinegar.  Next time, I will cut the sugar and not use quite as much juice.  I am also considering using an artificial sweetner, like Splenda or whatever one is recommended for baking. Hubby really liked it.  We made some chicken (browned in a frypan with a little margarine) and had it over rice.

I quadrupled this recipe for my daughers wedding reception. I had pre-made frozen Italian meatballs and simmered them in this sauce. They were the hit of the night and everyone wanted the recipe. I will make this sauce again and use it on chicken. I also put in some green peppers and used more pineapple juice and cornstarch to make it thicker. Yummo!

Still searching for our very favorite restaurant's version of sweet and sour, but this is the best homemade one we've tried so far.  I used pineapple juice for liquid, and omitted the crushed pineapple.  Everyone enjoyed!

I made this last night for some egg rolls I had and this was great.  I took some ideas from others: cut back a bit on the sugar, used 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white, used the juice from the pineapple and added a bit of soy sauce to it.  It really tasted good, wasn't too sweet/sour. Thank you for the recipe!!

Awesome recipe. It was my first attempt at sweet and sour sauce and it turned out great. I didn't use the pineapple and used tomato sauce instead of paste. I also replaced the white wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar. I did face minimal clumpage with the cornstarch which I really could have avoided by mixing it with water first, my mistake. But it still looked and tasted amazing. This will definately be a recipe i use again.

This recipe is awesome! I used pickle juice because I didnt have any vinegar on hand and used 4 tablespoons of flour (wisked in 1/2 the warm water) because I didnt have corn starch. Also pureed regular pineapples (not from a can). Fantastic!

Really delicious although I did make a few changes. I used the juice from the canned pineapple and water instead of just water. The thought of tomato paste didn't appeal to me so I used about 4 Tbsp of ketchup. I also used brown and white sugar (and only 3/4 of a cup) and added some fresh ginger. Yummy!

Yum!  I was very impressed.  I'm a girl who loves convenience but this recipe was definitely worth the time.  I actually ordered Chinese Sweet and Sour Chicken and used this sauce instead of the restaurant's!  Alterations:  Pineapple Juice instead of water (drained right from the can), Crushed Pineapple for better texture, Ketchup because I didn't have Tomato Paste, and be sure to whisk the Cornstarch into the liquid before adding the pineapple and Ketchup!

I didn't have pineapple tidbits, but used crushed instead and drained it to make up with the water.  I was pleasantly surprised how well I liked this recipe.  It did have the flavor I was looking for.  I did not add the pineapple to the sauce for egg roll dipping, however, I did add it to the leftover to pour over meatballs.  Good recipe!

I didn't have tomato paste, white vinegar or pineapple tidbits. I used ketchup and apple cider vinegar and pineapple chunks, including the juice! It was so yummy. I poured it over chicken nuggets and rice and the kids gobbled it up like it was take out!

I've been looking for the perfect Sweet and Sour Sauce and this is it!  So easy, so quick.  You can do anything with it.  I added 3 bell peppers, a quarter onion, and 2 cans of pineapple chunks (drained), then put in some pork meatballs that I had made.  Absolutely fabulous!  Can't wait to try it with Chicken.

If it were not for the tomato paste in this I think it would have been great.  The tomato paste, however, completely ruined it for me.  Guess I should have listened to my gut about the tomato paste before I made it.  Thanks, anyway though.

This was a really good recipe, and very easy to make. I took previous suggestions and add a little soy sauce at the very end.  Thanks for the recipe... out with the jar stuff :)

This was awesome!  Better than any store bought or restaurant version I had had.  I think next time I will add less sugar, and I took the suggest of adding extra, but I think I had too much soy so it has a really tangy taste.  I also added mandarin orange juice to it, it gave it a unique flavor.  I hope to play around with it some more!  But amazing recipe!! Thanks.

This is so simple and so good.  I added roughly chopped onion, green pepper, and carrots.  Lots of sugar - but really good.

All I can say is "WOW." I love it and so does my husband. I have wanted to make Sweet and Sour sauce for so long and never found the recipe that had just simple, in-the-pantry ingredients. This recipe was no trouble to make. I will definitely make it over and over again.  Thank you !!!

I subsituted half the water for pineapple juice and left out the pineapple chunks.  It made a ton of sauce, I only ended up using about a 1/4 of it with 24 crab cheese puffs.  A little too sweet and thick, good base recipe but needs some more tweaking to be really good.  I made the Crab Rangoon III to go with it, that was an awesome recipe!

We love this sauce.  It is not overly sweet like some you get in stores.  This is the only sweet & sour sauce we use now.  I'm not really a fan so I originally copied it for my daughter.  This recipe changed me to someone that really likes it now.  Thanks for such a good recipe.  My daughter suggested we add some chunks of onion and bell pepper to it the next time we make it.

Very tasty and easy to make...my kids loved it too. I also just used the crushed pineapple. And also regretted putting in the little bit extra pineapple...but still yummy. Now I wont have to make it for a while! We'll be eating a lot of Asian foods :)

This was really quick and easy, and popular with my family. I substituted rice vinegar for the white vinegar and chile sauce for the tomato paste. I added minced green onions and cooked chicken breast cut into 1/2 inche pieces, then served all over rice.

This was yummy...the only change we made was adding the pineapple juice in place of some of the water.  YUMMMMM  Occasionally we make silly changes like adding mushrooms or something like that but the basic recipe is fine just the way it is, aside from the pineapple juice.

made this last night for my husband who really liked it - I halved the recipe, and it stil made a ton, but also added red pepper flakes for zip and a touch more vinegar to thin it, and b/c I thought it was more sweet than anything.
good though!

Not necessarily 'a hands-down' winner over jar Sweet & Sour sauce. Don't know that I'd go to the trouble of doing this again (over opening a jar).

I needed sweet and sour sauce for Austin's Asian pork tenderloin from this site and didn't want to spend the amount of $$ the grocery store wanted for a small jar. Debbie, this sauce is perfect in every way! Looking forward to using this for sweet and sour chicken. Thanks so much!!

This was great! I halved the recipe since I didn't want too much. I let this simmer for a while because the consistency didn't look right. In the end I was sceptical but it was the perfect consistency. I will absolutely make this again.

For a quick easy to do sauce, this was decent. Simple to make, very quick. I used cider vinegar, I think it does make a difference of the type vinegar you use. A little too tomatoey tasting to me. Overall this was fine, but not my personal taste, although DH liked it very much. DH was really happy and that made me really happy. Thanks Debbie, it was just what I needed for the egg rolls.

Hey, for what is is, this is the best. Sweet and sour sauce is not a sauce for any kind of "cuisine", but when you have a ten-year-old boy like I do, it's tops. It's basically an American sugar-coating for anything! I never follow the recipe exactly and it always turns out fine. If you have kids, slop this sauce on anything and they'll eat it!

Very easy to make and tasty.  I thought it had a little bit too much pineapple flavor but I used fresh instead of canned.  I also mixed it in the blender to get a smooth and consistent texture.  This recipe makes a LARGE batch.

Excellent like it is or substituting ketchup for the tomato sauce.  Another variation split the white distilled vinegar with seasoned rice vinegar and split the water with pineapple juice.  Yum!

Loved It!!  This is an awesome sauce.  I made it to go with the Sweet and Sour Meatball recipie found also on Allrecipes.com,  but had no tomatoe paste so I substituded a cup of sauce boiled down to 1/2 cup.  Also instead of useing pineapple tidbits I used crushed. Was awesome. Will be a keeper!

This recipe is a great base. Instead of tomato paste, I use half tomate sauce and half ketchup. I also add 1/2 - 1 each of onion and green pepper. It goes great with sweet and sour chicken/pork/beef or egg rolls!

THE BEST sweet and sour sauce any of us have ever had.  It was SOOOO easy too.  I served it with Japanese style fried chicken from this website.  It was awesome, better than in any restaurant.  It does make a lot, I had tons left over and 4 of us ate, plus leftovers.  I added green pepper and carrots to my sauce at the very end and I used pineapple slices cut up instead of the tidbits.  I  can't wait to make this again!

I made this  and then cooked a 3 lb. pork roast in it for a family dinner. I didn't get any of the pork roast because my nieces and nephews wanted it instead of spahgetti or macaroni and cheese, I did however get some S&S sauce on some rice and it was delicious.

This was so easy to make!  I did add more vinegar, maybe 1 and 1/4 cups and I used the juice from the pineapple (I also used crushed pineapple).  Heaping 3tsp of cornstarch.  It’ll be my family’s sweet & sour for sure!

Recommend whisking all of the ingredients EXCEPT the pineapple tidbits BEFORE adding the pineapple to completely incorporate the tomato paste.  Otherwise this a really easy-to-prepare sauce that works well with wonton chips, fried wanton, and makes a quick and easy sweet and sour pork.

This is actually pretty good!  I was expecting that neon goop that normally accompanies our Chinese food, however, this was a nice texture and consistency.   As other reviewers, I used the pineapple juice from my canned pineapple as part of the water ratio, and added 2 T.  of soy sauce.  I also made a cornstarch slurry in 2 T. of cold water when ready to add the cornstarch to pan, rather that adding it in powder form, to avoid the dreaded cornstarch bombs.   We served with the cooked pineapple, green peppers and water chestnuts for crunch.  The only reason that this didn't get 5 stars was that it seemed that most reviewers had at least 2 modifications to get it right.

I did as people suggested and mixed the cornflour with the water and it came out nice and smooth and rich.

I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted ketchup and it turned out wonderful!  I reduced for an extra 10 minutes for thicker sauce.  I had pineapple rings so I mashed them with a potato masher and still turned out great!

This recipe is wonderful and easy.  I added about 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes for a little kick.  It does make a large amount, but it freezes well and is like "fresh made" when thawed and warmed.  Actually, I plan to make the recipe today and freeze it in portion sizes.  (I will divide it into 4 small freezer containers, then it will be ready when I need it - just thaw, warm in microwave, and serve).  Like others suggested, I will use the juice from the pineapple, use less sugar, use crushed pineapple instead of tidbits, and add a little soy sauce, but the recipe as written is wonderful.  I used it on pork meatballs baked in the oven.  WOW....

Substitute light brown sugar for the white and add a splash of soy to taste.  I also waited until the sauce thickened to add the pineapple bits.  It makes it easier to stir while thickening,  I also cut back on the tomato paste, in fact I substituted ketchup.  Came out great and its easy!

Was looking for a cheap sauce to put on top of Hawaiian meatballs that I made for a potluck dinner.  This was what we tried.  LOVED it, but added a little extra vinegar for zing.  After reading some reviews, I will add some soy sauce to it, too.  Great starter recipe, and I can't WAIT to eat our meatballs!  :)

Yummy and so easy.  Didn't change anything but did add a small amount of green pepper which I sautéed a little to soften.  Served it in a crock pot with meatballs. Sure to become a family favorite.

So easy and so delicious! I substituted a cup or so of ketchup for the tomato paste since I didn't have tomato paste and it still came out great! Thanks :)

This sauce is VERY good. It tastes a bit strange if you're sampling it while it's cooking, but once you put it on your stir-fry it's great! (I used pineapple juice instead of water, ketchup instead of tomato paste and a dash of soy sauce as per previous reviewers' suggestions)

I thought this recipe was awesome!!!! Only thing I did different was put it in a food processor to chop up the pineapple tidbits.  They were just  a little too chunky.  Thank you for the recipe~

Absolutely Delicious!!!  SO much better than stuff from a jar.   I cut the amount of the recipe down and estimated on the amount of tomate paste, but this was great.---mixed it with leftover cut up pork tenderloin and sauteed red peppers and served over rice!  My, husband and 3 year old LOVED IT!

This had an okay taste to it, but I just couldn't get over the smell of tomato.  Since scent plays such a big part in taste, I just didn't really like this.  Also, I wish I would have paid better attention to the serving size before I made this, because dinner for 4 sure didn't need 48 servings of this!

Wonderful!!! Served with homemade crab rangoon for an appetizer party.  Very tasty!  Just as good, if not better, than any regular sweet & sour sauce served at chinese restaurants.

Used this recipe for some bacon wraps I was making since I forgot to grab sweet and sour at the store. SO glad I forgot it since this could be made with things I had on hand, and it tasted a whole lot better. Used a few leftover chunks of pineapple from my bacon wraps that I crushed and threw in the pot, but mostly used the pineapple juice. Really good stuff, everyone loved it!

Oh, I really hate to do this because this recipe has such rave reviews and I had such high hopes for it. This was gross. I made it as instructed in the recipe, but I only made a half batch. I also used 1/4 cup less water to begin with. I then tasted it, thought it tasted like extra-sweet tomato paste, and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice as advised by so many reviewers to try to improve it. Well, it helped, but not enough. Now it tasted like extra-sweet tomato paste with a hint of pineapple flavor. I tried many things to save it: more vinegar, more pineapple juice, a jar of pureed plum baby food (to make it more of a plum sauce), some soy sauce... It all helped the flavor a LOT, but it was still pretty vile so I chucked it down the disposal. Thanks, Debbie, but I'll try another recipe and/or buy the bottled stuff. :)

at first when making this is was a little bit skeptical...but my husband and i loved it! also, everyone coming to our apartment to trick or treat (i made it on halloween) would compliment the smell! our neighbors came over to steal a bite later! it was very easy...especially for a new housewife like myself!

this recipe was really good! and just from experience with cornstarch and flour it clumps up real easy......so if you're like me u should add a little water to the cornstarch to form a little rue and add it in that way:)
Really good w/ Filipino Lumpia (from this site)

Excellent.  This makes a lot of sauce, too.  I did omit the pineapple (my husband and I do not like it) and it was still great.  Used it atop the Sweet and Sour Pork Patties recipe (submitted by Linda) on this website.

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  I cut it in half and I left out the pineapple only because I didn't have any and it still turned out great.  It only took about 5 minutes.  I'll be using it again.

This sauce was pretty good, I added a little chopped green pepper and some soya sauce for extra flavour.  Next time I will use a little less paste, otherwise very tasty.

Beautiful!  I used this with Cream Cheese Wontons, and it tasted just like Chinese takeout.  I didn't have pineapple, so I used orange juice and a little extra sugar; I also added extra water because I like it thinner.  Didn't take me 15 minutes to cook it...not much more than 5 minutes and it was done.  I'll be using it again!

This recipe is so easy, and it's great for dipping.  As close as you can get to restaurant style sweet and sour sauce.
