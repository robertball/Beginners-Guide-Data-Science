Made as written except that I used Swiss in place of the Monterey Jack  because that is what I had on hand. These turned out really good. I did have to add more Panko than the recipe called for and even then the patties were a little loose so I just stuck them on a cookie sheet and tossed them in the freezer for 20 minutes to help firm them up before sticking them on the grill. I really enjoyed the ranch/wing sauce and it is one I will use on other things. French fries would be great dipped in it for starters.  I will be recommending this one to my friends. Thanks for sharing!
