Thought this might help some cut the cost of this cake.
mascarpone  = mascherpone = Italian cream cheese   Pronunciation:   mas-car-POH-nay  Notes:    A key ingredient in tiramisu and zabaglione, mascarpone is velvety soft, slightly acidic, and very expensive.  Although Italian in origin, the name may come from the Spanish mas que bueno, "better than good."  It's usually sold in tubs.  Use it soon after you purchase it since it's highly perishable.  Substitutes:   Blend 8 ounces softened cream cheese with 1/4 cup whipping cream. OR Blend 8 ounces softened cream cheese with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cream OR Blend 8 ounces softened cream cheese with 1/8 cup whipping cream and 1/8 cup sour cream. OR Whip ricotta cheese in a blender until smooth (lower in fat)

I served this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. The recipe did need more Kaluha as previously mentioned so I used 3 Tbs. in the crust, 6 Tbs. in the cheese mixture. I would use even more - next time I'll use 5 & 10.  I used shortbread cookies instead of the lady fingers. Couldn't find the mascarpone cheese so I mixed together 8 oz. of cream cheese with 1/4 c. sour cream & 2 Tbs. heavy cream. The substitutions were necessary and worked just fine.  I can't imagine the recipe getting any better. The cheesecake top didn't split but it did brown too much so I mixed up a simple chocolate ganache and poured over the cooled cake.
Very attractive served with whipped cream, a dusting of cocoa a dash of cinnamon sitting in a puddle of Kaluha.  TIP: For nice clean cuts you can cut your cheesecakes with dental floss. Push down and pull straight out, not up.

A 5-star recipe with a couple of changes: 4 T. coffee liqr in the crust, and 4 T. coffee liqr plus 8 T. Starbucks espresso in the filling gives the cheesecake a perfect coffee flavor! Coarsely crumble lady fingers for the crust, leaving small chunks of cookie. The extra liqueur makes the crust soft, giving more of a Tiramisu taste and texture. I found mascarpone (made in Vermont) at my local Whole Foods market. It cost $4.99 for 8oz, as opposed to imported mascarpone-$15.49 for 16oz! The mascarpone makes this cheesecake, and is well worth it! I turned off the oven after 45 minutes and left the cake in until close to room-temp. It came out perfectly! If you want an easy way to remove the cheesecake from the pan, line the bottom with parchment paper before starting. Press the crust on top of the parchment. When ready to remove chilled cheesecake, undo the side pan, place plastic wrap and plate over top of cake and flip over. Remove bottom pan and peel off parchment. Place serving plate against bottom of crust and flip over. If you want a softer, tiramisu-like crust, brush some extra coffee liqr across the crust before inverting onto serving plate. I topped it with a layer of Ganache I from this site, soaked two lady fingers in espresso, cut them lengthwise, then in half again, and fanned the small strips in a circle on top of the ganache. I topped the cake with chocolate shavings and coffee beans for decor. This recipe was amazingly easy for such a beautiful and gormet dessert!

This cheesecake was ok.  I don't usually use flour in my cheesecakes (I've made and sold a lot) but tried it for this recipe.  I think it gave it slightly thick texture instead of smooth and melt-in-your-mouth.  I didn't have any problems with cracks.  Here are my tips for avoiding cracks: do not overmix, butter the sides of the pan REALLY well, and cool slowly.  If you butter the sides well, you don't have to run a knife along the edge when done.  I try to avoid doing it because it sometimes makes the edges rough.  A note on the pan of water on the bottom rack, this is not the same as a bain marie (water bath).  A water bath envelops the sides of the pan with water and allows the sides to cook evenly. Putting a pan of water under the cheesecake will not accomplish this.  If using a springform, the best thing I found to keep the water out of the pan is encasing the sides and bottom with a crockpot liner.  Do not use oven bags (for cooking turkeys).  They're unreliable with keeping the water out.

This was my first cheesecake, and I made it for my mom's birthday.  I baked it for 45 minutes, then let it sit in the open oven for 20 minutes as directed.  I then took it out and let it cool for another hour or so, but I got the dreaded crack down the middle.  The middle of it still looked gooey, but I went ahead and put it in the refrigerator over night.  After about 24 hours from starting, I sifted a little cocoa powder on top and grated some chocolate on top.  My expectations were very low, not based on the recipe, but because of the crack and this being the first cheesecake I made.  But whoa, this was awesome.  My family couldn't believe I made it.  Instead of Khalua, I used Starbucks Coffee Liqueur, and I took the suggestions and used 4 in the crust and 8 in the filling.  I highly recommend this, and in the future will try either the waterbath, or the suggestion from the advice section and run the knife around the cheesecake after removing it from the oven to let the cheesecake pull away from the pan (to hopefully prevent the crack).

I made this cheesecake for Christmas and it was a huge hit. I increased the coffee liquer to 8 TBS. (4 in the crust and 4 in the filling.) When the cake was cooled I dusted it with cocoa and garnished it with 1/2 pt. of heavy cream whipped with confectioners sugar and cocoa powder (1/4 cup total) and 1 tsp. of coffee liquer. Delicious!

We made this recipe for my son's traditional "birthday cheesecake".  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers, by increasing the liquor.  One thing we found, was that the cheesecake needs a full 24 hours to reach its peak.  We served it after 15 hours, and the crust was still gummy.  After 24 hours, it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing

Oh yum. Like others, I doubled the Kahlua that I put in the crust and the cheesecake itself. I ran out of ladyfingers and used vanilla wafers. I hate to say it but there wasn't much of a difference in the taste- especially with the extra kahlua. I dusted the tops with cocoa powder and then finished with a homemade whipped cream which I added 1 tbs. of corn syrup to stablize the cream, and then added about 1 tbs of instant powdered mocha (like instant by Folgers) to one cup of heavy whipping cream, then finished with shaved chocolate. It was gorgeous and delish!

Amazing Cheesecake!  I made this for a dinner party and even my lactose intollerant friend couldn't help but ask for seconds, and thirds!  The only thing I did different was use espresso instead of coffee liqueur and I put 4 tbsp. in the crust and 4 in the cake.  Then I sprinkled the top with chocolate shavings, ground cinnamon, coffee dust and icing sugar.

I used angel food cake cut into quarter inch slices for the crust and brushed it with kaluha.  I ended up with a bunch of cracks on the top of my cheesecake when it was finished baking.  So I made some ganache using cream, chocolate and kaluha.  I spread this on the cooled cheesecake to hide the cracks.  Holy smokes did it ever turn out amazing.  mmm...

my son LOVED this.  I used nilla wafers instead of lady fingers.  I used 4 T. Kahlua in the crust and 8 T in the filling.  I also couldn't find mascarpone cheese so I used an 8 oz tub of cream cheese.  I had to cook it about 60 minutes.  Very good!  Rich too.

I LOVED this but I did make quite a few changes...totally redid the crust: 6 oz. vanilla wafers; crushed fine mixed with 2 T melted butter and 4 T kahlua. After I pressed it into the pan, I brushed espresso over the top. To the filling: I added 2 T kahlua and 1 T espresso. I made a ganache for the top too that was killer: 4.5 oz. chocolate, chopped mixed with 1/2 cup boiling heavy cream, add 1 T Kahlua and let cool before pouring over cheesecake! So yummy!!!

My first cheesecake ever. I'm still in awed disbelief that I could make something that tastes this good! No cracks, turned out perfect - used the water bath technique. Increased liquor in the crust/filling as many suggested, but I'm still going to add even more to the crust next time - maybe some espresso too. I used nilla wafers for the crust. The recipe calls for 12 oz of ladyfingers, but a whole 12 oz box of wafers would have been way too much. I used about half that and still had to increase the butter to a whole stick. Topped with Ganache I (I halved that recipe and still had a ton, so be careful) and made my own frosting: 1 C hvy cream + 1 tbsp kahlua + 1/8 C confec sugar. Perfection!!! You'll swear this is something straight out of Cheesecake Factory, if not better! Pretty easy to prepare, too! I will make this again and again.... Thanks!!

This recipe makes a really nice cheesecake, however, I agree with the majority of the reviewers in that it didn't taste like tiramisu at all. I put in waaay more kahlua than called for, but it still just tasted like plain cheesecake. A really good plain cheesecake though. I like the addition of the mascarpone to the cream cheese, might do that for other cheesecakes in future. I think it'd be just fine doing 2 pkgs cream cheese (instead of 3) + 1 container mascarpone too, going to try that. The ladyfingers made a really great crust. I had a package of ladyfingers that said 5.3oz and I didn't even use the whole package and it was more than enough crumbs for the crust. I'd also suggest putting the eggs in very last (put the flour first, mix, then eggs) to avoid the tempation to overmix the batter. I also knocked this down to 325F for about 50 minutes, let it cool in the oven, and I still had two small cracks.

This is a great recipe. But after reading reviews that mostly complained of bland filling, I made it perfect and really taste like tiramisu, I added to the filling: 5 T. Kahlua, 1 T. brandy, 1 T. rum and 1 t. instant expresso powder.  I topped it with whipped cream and sprinkled a mixture of grated chocolate and unsweetened cocoa on top. I also doubled the Kahlua in the crust. Fabulous !

I tired several cheesecake recipes in the past- with gelatin- with sour cream, etc.  This one is far and above the rest.  I really only need 1 cheesecake recipe and this is the keeper.  As directed it's fabulous.  Changes I have added for fun include- melting a small handful of chocolate chips in about 2 tsp strong coffee and marble it in the top prior to cooking.  Looks lovely.  This last time I did not have enough lady fingers so I also crushed some chocolate wafer cookies and graham crackers in addition to the 1-3oz package of lady fingers I had.  I now cut the Kahlua in the crust by 1 TB and replace it with 1 TB strong coffee. (instant granuales in a tablespoon of water- approx 1 tsp)    I don't measure exact since I've made this several times and  have learned  the consistency.  Finally, and most importantly I have never had a cheesecake crack since baking in a water bath.  Wrap your springfoam pan in foil (sides only) and place in a casserole dish with an inch or so of boiling water- or easier yet, preheat the casserole dish and water in the oven and place foil wrapped (sides only) springfoam directly into water bath.

Everyone absolutely loves this! The filling was very good. I think the mascarpone is very important. It has a nutty-ness that cream cheese does not, also it does not have the tang that cream cheese and sour cream have (do not overbeat the mascarpone or it will become grainy, I always beat the cream cheese much longer before adding the mascarpone, and it is best to use it cold, because softened mascarpone may also turn grainy). I don't understand the reviewers who didn't think the mascarpone made any difference. In my opinion it completely made the dessert taste like tiramisu. Used only two tablespoons of flour-next time I'll try an extra egg, no flour, because I use a water bath and believe that makes flour unnecessary, because it is there to keep the eggs from curdling and the cake from cracking-which a water bath already does. I didn't care for the crust, though I like lady fingers in real tiramisu. So the next time I made it I used golden Oreos and I loved how they didn't compete with the flavor of the cheesecake. I put no coffee liquor in the crust, but  I used 4 in the batter and did not find it too sweet like I thought it might be because of the bitterness of the coffee. I think the secret to getting the perfect tiramisu flavor is in the topping- we used plenty of shaved chocolate all over, just like in traditional tiramisu and it made all the difference. I can't imagine this with a heavy ganache. It was perfect, light, and delicate-thanks!

If you need an awesome dessert to impress friends or relatives, THIS WOULD BE IT! Couldn't locate lady fingers, so I, too, used Lorna doones. With triple the amount of Kahlua, this was very delicious. Very attractive presentation with chocolate sauce drizzled on each serving. Thanks Marty.

This is delicious, but I did follow reviewer Mandy's recipe for the crust instead of the one in the recipe and made her ganache for the topping.  I also added extra Kalhua as she suggested.  I think changing the crust like she has it and adding the ganache made this cheesecake.  To be honest, I probably would not have rated it so high if I hadn't done so.

Amazing!  Definitely need to add more Kahlua to filling though.  At least double the amount.

awesome texture and awesome taste - it was great! I made it in a smaller springform pan though and lined the side of the pans with ladyfingers, and also put a little bit more of the coffee liqueur.  Topped with whipped cream then shaved Godiva chocolate~ heaven!!

Very tasty ! I put 4 tbs of coffee liquor in the crust and 10 tbs in the batter. The taste was even better in the next day ( after chilling overnight ).

WOW!  I made this last night with the chocolate ganache topping (also from this site, the one with rum added) and served myself up a piece for breakfast! (Had to test it to make sure it was worthy of being served to my family for dessert after dinner ;o)

I followed the recipe except that I doubled up on the liquor because many reviewers said it wasn't evident enough... To 6 Tbs. Kahlua, I added 2 Tbs. rum.  It's strong, but I like it like that.  I sorta feel like I should be eating this out of a paper back on a park bench... hee hee.  I also added one cup of sour cream to the cream cheese mixture.  This cheesecake is rich, heavenly and decadent!

This turned out so beautiful that several people asked where I purchased it...not a single crack!!!!  If you like tiramisu, you will love this cheesecake...very rich!  The only change made was not intentional, I only bought one package of lady fingers...7 oz size....and it turned out to be PLENTY for the crust, especially considering the $ savings buying only one package.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I love this recipe!!!!  It's super easy to make and the cream is just perfect- not too sweet!  Don't worry if you think your ladyfinger is oversoaked/wet...once it sits in the fridge for a couple hours all the flavors will come through and it'll be perfect.  I actually added a couple more teaspoons of Kahula just to get it that extra kick. The hard part is the waiting to dig into it. My husband's favorite dessert is tiramisu and he says this is his favorite one yet.

The texture of this was awesome!  I used french vanilla kahlua in place of the coffee liquor and that was pretty good.  I'm not sure if I used the right lady fingers but my crust was way too thick.  I would probably use about a 3rd of what was called for or make a different crust.

Very good but required much more chocolate liquor than listed to make a difference from a regular cheesecake, used 10 tbsp as suggested by others for the batter.  Also, we used chocolate ganache for the topping which made it even better.

Great cheesecake! I loved the ladyfingers crust :) But I added 8 Tablespoons coffee liqueur into the crust and 8 into the cake and the flavor is still too subtle for me, I had to serve it with coffee liqueur on the side.  I would recommend adding more coffee liqueur especially in the cake part because it tasted almost like a ny cheesecake.  Still very good though. I used half fat free cream cheese which made it lighter :) My boyfriend adores cheesecakes and thought it was good but prefers real tiramisu or the Irish cream cheesecake on this website :)

EXCELLENT!!  I sprinkled mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top, right after removing it from the oven.  Easier than melting the chocolate!  And the cake is still warm enough to melt them slightly.

FANTASTIC recipe!

I did a few things differently.  I couldn't find lady fingers so I used Lorna Doone shortbread cookies.  Gave the crust a nice, sweet flavor.  I used tiramisu flavored mascarpone cheese.  Instead of coffee liqueur, I substituted strong coffee or expresso.  My husband likes this better than the original, authentic tiramisu that we get at our favorite Italian restaurant.  Definitely shave the chocolate on top.  It gives it a great flavor and also makes the cheesecake pretty.  This makes a lot of servings because it is rich.

I made this for my sister in laws engagement party. There were lots of other desserts, but everyone was raving about this cheesecake.  It disappeared within minutes.

As per the other comments, I did add twice as much liquor to the crust and filling.  I was able to find a liquor called Tiramisu which is great.

I decorated it using chocolate ganache.  I put chocolate swirls around the top edge, and topped each "rosette" with a chocolate covered coffee bean.

I will make this again and again.

Made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  The crust and cheesecake turned out perfectly.  I took other reviewers advice and heavily buttered the side of my springform pan and it was PERFECT.  No crack.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 6 tbsp. of Kahlua to the crust and 6 tbsp to the filling.  My family that it had a strong alcohol taste.  I thought it was fine.  I'll probably make it again, but leave out the extra Kahlua.

I had to make some adjustments due to lack of coffee liqueur in the house.  Based on the suggestion of others, I added some amaretto to the crust as well as the cheesecake itself.  I threw in a package of Starbucks Via to provide the coffee flavor and it was quite good.  Baked for 45 mins and cooled as directed.  I got a crack in it, but that doesn't affect the flavor so I really don't care.

This  fantastic recipe....restaurant quality! I did change a few  ingredients for mine.   I used expressso coffee and  alot of it. I am a coffeee lover. I also used 2 containters of mascarpone and 2 cream cheese containters. I added coffee until desired thickness of batter. The lady fingers absorb coffee really well so i poured some coffeee  over the top of the crust to add more coffee flavoring. Oh and you can use pound cake if you cant find lady fingers or want to save money.  dont forget the whip cream!

I made the adjustments suggested in other reviews:  4Tbsp coffee liqueur in the crust as well as 4 tbsp liqueur + 4 tbsp espresso in the cheese mixture. I topped the cake with chocolate ganache and coated the sides with whip cream and stuck ladyfingers around the sides.  While it was a good cake, I actually found the coffee flavor too strong so I think I'll try the original recipe next time.

This was a huge waste of ingredients, time and $$.    
Tiramisu flavor was not evident.  Cooking time was not adequate and my cheesecake was runny in the center (I even cooked it longer than recipe called for).

This was a delicious cheesecake, but it's extremely heavy. There is definitely not enough coffee in this cake. I think I added a total of 8 espresso shots (4 in the crumbs and 4 in the cheesecake mixture.) It wasn't bad with this amount of espresso but I could have used even more (maybe mixing some instant coffee into the espresso would have been a good move.) Also, I found the mascarpone flavor very subtle.It made the cake very heavy and didn't contribute much other than that. I think to cut the cost of this cake, you could leave it out. Overall it was really yummy. I used a chocolate ganache as the icing. A good mocha or coffee flavored topping would have really topped it off too!

I thought this cheesecake tasted great and was easy to make.  As suggested, I increased the Kahlua.  I also found that mine cracked in the top, but covered the ch-cake in cool whip, followed by a new "alcohol infused whipped cream" in caramel flavor to accent like the picture shows.  You can purchase this at the liquor store- super yummy!!!!

I didn't have any coffee liquor, so I dissolved 2 sachets instant coffee in 1/2 cup table cream. I don't see the point of making this cheesecake with a mascarpone subsitute... the whole point of a real tiramisu IS the mascarpone! Otherwise you just end up with a coffee flavored new york style cheesecake. I added some rum and vanilla extract too. A bit denser than regular cheesecake. Maybe halve the flour, cause the batter was so thick, even when I added cream in.

I LOVE this recipe! I get so many compliments on it everytime...they always think I bought it instead!! I have done it differently from the recipe each time though...as per others suggestions add more liquer and also I have added some espresso for a better coffee flavor. The first time I spent the extra $ on the ladyfingers and marscapone and it was good...the second time I just used the cream cheese mixed with some cream (instead of marscapone) and nilla wafers instead of ladyfingers as well as toped it with some chocolate ganache and I will say save the money and do it the cheap way it tasted much better!

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made and eaten for that matter. The only downside is that I hade to make a slight variation. I could not find any lady fingers and I know you cant have tiramisu without lady fingers. I had to use angel foodcake instead, but I tell you what, that was the best cheesecake ever. I made this for my honey for valentines day because she loves tiramisu.

I thought this was good but not great.  I followed some others' recommendations and doubled up the kahlua.  It seemed a bit strong in the cheesecake portion, although the rest of my family said they barely noticed it.  Personally, I would cut it back to 3 Tbsp.  I also doubled the amount in the crust, or tried to.  I ran out of kahlua (used 2 Tbsp.) and finished it off with another 2 Tbsp. of vanilla.  Big mistake. The crust had such a strong taste, it nearly burned my stomach.  Should have just added extra melted butter.  I also added a little cream, as the recipe states, since the batter seemed too thick.  Wish I hadn't have done that.  Even though I probably only added 1/4 cup, it seemed to have a hard time setting up.  Also, instead of opening the oven door, I kept it closed.  Seemed to help.  And finally, I discovered that Stella D'oro makes Lady Fingers but calls them Margherites.  But shortbread cookies or vanilla wafers would be a good substitute.

Crust is bland unless you put in extra liquor.  Overall great recipe though...definitely a favorite and even better flavor with a some extra liquor in the cake as well.

I have made this a few times now.  The recipe as written is good, but could easily be a 5 star recipe with a few minor changes. The changes I made was what others have mentioned.  It really needs more coffee flavored liqueur (I like Baileys the best so far).  At least double the amount the recipe calls for.  Half in the lady fingers crust and half in the cheesecake mix.  For the lady fingers I used Savoiardi I recipe from here.  Excellent and easy recipe!  It worked well for the crust.  I also added about 1/4 cup of espresso (half in the crust, half in the mix).  It has more of a tiramisu flavor with the changes made. If you have access to coffee syrup (made in Rhode Island) it is a wonderful addition to drizzle a little bit on top just before serving.

Awesome!!  I took the advice of the others and added 5 tbsp coffee liquor in the cheesecake mixture, along with a tbsp of strong espresso; I added 2 tbsp coffee liquor to the base.  It tasted like a perfect combination of cheesecake and tiramisu.  BTW, I only used 1.5 pks of the 3 oz ladyfingers from Whole Foods, and it was just right for a 9 inch springform pan.

This was yummy and easy! I make a lot of cheesecakes and this is one of the easiest I've made. I used the amount of Kahlua that the recipe called for and it was enough Kahlua flavor that I thought the cheesecake should be called Kahlua rather than Tiramisu. I'm thinking of saving money by not adding the mascarpone next time as I didn't notice that it added anything to the flavor. Just a note: I could not find 12oz pkg of ladyfingers so I picked up two 3oz packages in the deli and left them out the dry out so they could be crushed up. the 6oz was plenty.

I served this to absolutely rave reviews from family and neighbors.
They keep asking when I'll make it again. It was so easy to make and delicious to eat. On my list of favorites.
The 2nd time I made this, I used graham cracker crumbs and added 2 TBSP Hershey's extra dark cocoa and the melted butter for the crust.
Again, rave reviews! Tiramisu Cheesecake what fun! Ciao!!!

Didn't have the mascarpone cheese so i used cheese cream and heavy cream. 
I usually make just a regular cheesecake so i wanted to try something different since it was for a friends farewell party so i made this. I'm so glad i tried this recipe. Everyone loved this and when i took a slice to my mom 4 days later she said she never had a better cheesecake.

I made this Cheesecake for work with the Italian theme..Well let me say it was a huge success..All I head was mmmmmm's non-stop..They all wanted my recipe for this..I did make some changes to the orginal from everyones suggestions and reviews..CRUST-1. I half the crust with 6 0s of nilla wafers and one package of lady fingers (I did crush them very fine and mixed them together). 2. I used a total of 6 TBS of melted butter for the crust and 4 TBS of Kaluha to the crust mixture as well. MIXTURE-I used an 8 oz. container of Tiramisu flavor Mascarpone cheese. 2. I put in a total of 5 TBS of Kahula into the mixture as well..GANACHE- I got the recipie from this site as well and got the reviews and suggestions as well..I did ulter for the size that I needed though. 1. 5 0z. of Bittersweet chocolate(I used the Neestle Chocolatier, 1/2 C. of heavy whipping cream. After I boiled the whipping cream I added it to the chocolate pieces in a bowl and melted the chocolate. Then I added 1 tsp. of Kulaha just for flavor, and mixed until it cooled so I can drizzle it with a wisk.. 
I did top it with chocolate shavings and cacao powder like the picture I did use the coolwhip in a can. next time I will do the toppings just before serving..(HINT,HINT)
My only regret is that I wish that I could have eaten a slice for just me but then I would of went into a sugar coma..For the two bites that I got LOVED IT!

I made this cheesecake with a few variations. I used 7 TBSP of Coffee liqueur for the crust and 10 TBSP in the batter.  For the batter I used 2 pkgs of light cream cheese and 500g of marcarpone cheese.  I also added a touch of cream to the batter.  THe result was a nice light, creamy texture to the cheesecake. I made some whipped cream which I used for the topping and sides of the cake.  I dusted the top of the cake with cocoa powder and chocolate shavings. I had some remaining saviordi ladyfingers which I cut in half and placed around the cake.  It was a great tasting cake with a nice presentation! Everyone loved it!

I made this for a dinner party of 24 and everyone loved it. I did take that suggestion of adding more Kahlua to the crust and mixture and using nila wafers instead of lady fingers. Plus I added more shaved chocolate to it. Everyone loved it. A big hit. and very easy.

This was a huge hit, absolutely a keeper recipe!  On the top, I had soaked 6 whole ladyfingers in a coffee liqueor, then arranged them in a fan shape on top, with chocolate curls on top of that.  Not only incredibly tasty, but gorgeous too!  Thank you!

This was sooooo good!  I used a little more butter than it called for to hold the ladyfingers together.  I used an 8 inch springform pan too because I like my cheesecakes to be thick.  Definitely grate some chocolate on top.  It makes it look really pretty.  Everyone loved it!

I entered this in my office holiday Bake-Off the very first time I made it and WON (very competitive office, too!).  I pretty much doubled the amount of liqueur (Kahlua) it called for, since this was an adult crowd, and added a thin sour cream-sugar-kahlua layer to the top, dusted it all with sifted cocoa powder.  Beautiful and delicious, really great texture - moist and firm and wonderful.  Will be making it for Christmas dinner with the family.

I have made this 3 times, all to rave reviews!  The only changes I make are to reduce cream cheese to TWO 8oz packages, add more Kahlua to both crust and batter (don't worry about batter being too runny, because with 2 eggs and reduced cream cheese, the finished product still is firm.  Also, just a note-I use DeLallo's Savioardi Lady Fingers...they come in a 7 oz package, 24 total ladyfingers, wrapped in 2 separate 12ct pkgs.  I use 13 crushed ladyfingers for the crust.  I do this in my Ninja.  The leftover 11, I cut in half and stand them up on the outside rim, creating a pretty scalloped border (sugared side OUT), once the crust is pressed into the  bottom.  This makes for a really pretty end result, and 22 half ladyfingers fit perfectly into my springform pan.  This also makes certain that the 2 pkgs of cream chese and 1 8oz container of mascarpone (once I even found tiramisu flavored mascarpone!) fill the pan nicely!  It also makes for 22 perfectly portioned small wedges, or 11 LARGE!  I've topped with finely shaved chocolate (unless you can find the chocolate powder that you use to flavor coffee), and it hides any cracks and looks and tastes divine!  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper!

I have now made this twice and each time it has turned out great. Other reviewers gavincreasing ideas for modifications - increasing coffee liquor to 8 tbs. i used 16 oz of marscapone instead of 8. Once I thoroughly mixed cream cheese, marscapone and sugar I pulled about 3/4 of a cup out and reserved. Everything was mixed very well before adding eggs - once eggs are added only use stir feature on mixer to incorporate. This prevented air from being mixed in and this preventing the top from cracking during baking. I made my cheesecake in a loose bottom tart/quiche pan and it lurked great - popped right out. Reserved cheese and sugar mixture was beaten with some heavy whipping cream to make pretty swirls on top of each piece. I cut six pieces of kitchen string the width of pan, then laid them out over the top of the cooled cheesecake in a spoke pattern. This helped guide where I put the piped swirls (middle of each slice).

The cheesecake just went into the oven, and the batter is the most delicious one I've EVER tasted. Something about coffee and cream cheese just makes my taste buds go crazy...
 I couldn't get my hands on Kahlua, ladyfingers, or mascarpone, so I made a few adjustments. I used the ladyfinger recipe from this website, and crushed about half for the crust. I only used 2 Tbsp. butter, but increased the espresso (my substitute for Kahlua) to about 5 Tbsp. Make sure the ladyfingers are crispy and dry; this will make crushing easier. In the batter, I used sour cream in place of the mascarpone and about 1/2 c. (8 Tbsp.) espresso instead of the Kahlua because of complaints that the flavor wasn't strong enough. Be sure to give your cheesecake a water bath and let cool in the oven for 1 hour!

Sooo rich but sooo good! I used vanilla wafers instead of lady fingers. I also used another person's suggestion on substitutes for marscopne cheese (cream cheese blended with cream), I used a regular coffee liqueur instead of Kahlua, I also used several more tablespoons and thought it could have had a stronger coffee flavor. I also 2 pie pans instead of the springform pan (smaller pieces were nice). And I had a espresso dark chocolate bar I grated over the tops. Both turned out perfect, no cracks.

I made this cheesecake tonight and it was delicious! I know I should have waited until tomorrow but I just couldn't. I couldn't find lady fingers so I made them myself with a recipe from this site. Instead of crumbling I made one big cookie in the bottom of a round pan and placed it in the bottom of my springform pan, punctured with a fork. I also lined the edges with ladyfingers. I took the advice of many and added more kahlua and I also took some strong coffee with a packet of instant French roast mixed in it, added mocha Kahlua to that. I then made a ganache with Kahlua in it and poured over the top. Divine!

excellent recipe.  I used more coffee liquor than the recipe called for the bring out that coffee flavor more.  I also made a homemade whip cream to top and used instant expresso and more of the coffee liquor and it was simply divine!

This was amazing, but tasted like cheesecake and NOT like tiramisu. I used at least 8 tablespoons of kahlua, and if I were to do it again I'd probably go for 3/4 of a cup instead. I used spongecake and tore it up into little pieces since I couldn't find ladyfingers - worked well. I topped it off with cocoa powder, whipped cream, and strawberries - definitely a pretty looking cake.

Followed the directions exactly.  It did not taste like tiramisu at all.  It was more of a kaluah taste. which was allright, my husband still ate it but I didnt like it very much.

My whole family LOVED this cheesecake. I had my worries when i saw how thin the filling was but it was definitely unfounded. It chilled overnight and we had it for Christmas dinner. Everyone absoutely loved the flavour and it was very smooth. Fantastic

although this cheesecake tasted really good, it didn't taste much like tiramisu, even with the increased amount of kahlua suggested in other comments. it tastes a lot like cheesecake with kahlua in it, but that's about it. my boyfriend, who adores tiramisu, said he'd rather have regular cheesecake.

Everyone seemed to like it, I was not as impressed.  It tasted good, but tasted nothing like tiramisu.  Next Time I'm going to soak the ladyfinger crumbs with strong coffee and add a lot more Kauluha into the filling, loved how smooth the cheesecake was.

I have been making something similar to this for years.  Some 10 years ago, there was an Italian Restaurant In the west end of Tacoma WA that made the BEST Tiramisu, brushed the crust with half Kahlua and half brandy.  When I make my cheesecakes, I add the same amount for each liquor 4 Tbsp Kahlua and Brandy.  Wonderful flavor and it reminds me of the days back home.

YUM!!! I made this for my husband's birthday (his favorite desserts are Tiramisu and Cheesecake) and it was a huge hit. I agree that it doesn't taste all that much like Tiramisu, but the flavor is terrific. Added Vanilla wafers to the lady finges and that was tasty.
Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I made it for Chinese New Year and everyone loved it!! Only thing was that the base was a little too thick and the measurements of the ingredients were too much. Cooking time needs to be more than 45 mins at the stated temperature. I baked it for 1 hour and 10 mins. Made a chocolate ganache and poured it over the cake. When the frosting has set, I drizzled melted chocolate on the cake, sprinkled chocolate chips on it, and put chocolate curls in the middle. Everyone loved the look and taste of the cake. Thanks!

This cheesecake is tasty!  I used 6 tbls of Kahlua in the crust and 8 in the batter.  The flavor and consistency are great.  I dusted the top with cocoa powder cut with a little confectioner's sugar.  I didn't have lady fingers, so I just made a graham cracker crust and prebaked it for 10 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added more coffee liquor to the recipe and brushed the crust with coffee liquor before adding the cheese cake mixture.  Also I baked it in a hot water bath from the advice section of this website cooked for 45 minutes at 350 and turned off the oven and left door ajar for about an hour before removing.  It looks and tastes perfect.  By the way, this is the first time I've made cheesecake! I had to share with the neighbors!

After all the great reviews, I was disappointed by this recipe. It kind of tasted like a big block of cream cheese and had very little tiramisu flavor, despite doubling the liquor as others suggested. I topped it with chocolate ganache and amaretto whipped cream, which helped. Also, I couldn't find ladyfingers so I substituted biscotti and crushed almonds in the crust. The one thing I did like about this recipe was the technique of using a pan of water in the oven. I usually use a water bath, which can get a little messy and forces you to wrap the springform pan in foil. The pan of water produced a smooth, evenly baked cheesecake with less mess. I wouldn't make this again, but for others I suggest using 16 oz. mascarpone and 16 oz. cream cheese for a creamier texture.

Great recipe! The texture was just great, and the lady finger crust just awesome. I would also suggest doubling the amount of Kahlua in both the crust and the batter.I topped the cheesecake with a mascarpone cream.

The cheese cake had a very light taste, but the cooking directions were too long. The cake came out with a brown top which is not attractive. I would recommend reduceing the cooking time by at least ten minutes and adding a half can of condensed milk to give the cake a velvet texture.

I got rave reviews when I made this for a dinner party.  I did double the liquor in both the crust and the filling.  I didn't use mascarpone cheese since it is so expensive.  I did a substitute of 8 oz. cream cheese softened with 1 tablespoon of cream.  Also, I think next time I make it I might cook the crust a little bit before I put the filling on top.  It fell apart too easily.

My family is STILL raving about this cheesecake!  They loved every last bite of it and are waiting for another one.  I found that it was easiest to make fine crumbs out of the lady fingers by putting them in a food processor.  Well worth the effort!

The flavor wasn't that distinctive.  I used Kahlua.  It tasted very similar to plain cheesecake.  It was okay--not spectacular.

HOLY. CROW. I made this as my birthday cake and brought it into work. I work in an office of about 200, and everyone who has tried it LOVES it. The only changes I made were doubling the coffee liquor and adding a splash of rum to it. I used 1/4 cup on the crust (half mixed in and the other half drizzled over it once its pressed into the pan) and another 1/4 cup in the mix. I also used a local coffee liquor made by Koval distillery, so it's not a creamy coffee liquor. Definitely a winner and will be used often in the future. The cake is light and creamy but has a perfectly balanced flavor.

Fantastic recipe!!  I made with strong decaf coffee, (first setting on my Keurig), not using Kahlua at all.  Made these changes; 5 tbsp coffee in crust, 8 tbsp coffee and 4 tbsp flour in filling.  Baked almost full hour in water bath, wrapping pan in foil first.  Checked at 45 min. too wiggly so I added 10 more minutes, barely a wiggle.  Turned off oven and cracked door when done, left cake sit 1/2 hour. So delicious...def making again and again!!  :-D

Per the reviews, i upped the Kahlua to 4 tbl in the crust, and 8 tbls in the filling, but still got only a very vague coffee taste. 12 oz of ladyfingers in the crust is WAY too much; I used 7 oz and still had a pretty thick crust; however, even with the added Kahlua, the crust was a little too dry. I found that the mascarpone added nothing, so given how expensive it is, I'd recommend subbing in regular cream cheese. I added an extra egg to compensate for the added Kahlua, and omitted 1 tbl of flour. The cheesecake was good, but tasted much like any ordinary cheesecake, as others have said.

I made a chocolate ganache for the top, and piped some Bailey's-flavored buttercream swirls around the edge, adding a chocolate-covered coffee bean in the center of each. The cake LOOKED great, but was only average tasting. I might try again, with some modifications.

This recipe  went over really well at Christmas dinner. I omitted the coffee liquor in favor of straight fresh brewed espresso. I used 4 table spoons in the crust and cut a table spoon of butter and used about 4 in the cake. I also used coffee infused mascarpone instead of plain for the extra coffee kick.

I made this cheescake for a family get together.  They devoured it.  First time that a cheesecake was finished the same day it was served.

I used the other recommendation, and added about 12-13 tablespoons of kahlua.  The flavour was plenty.  Make sure to shave the chcolate before serving, it makes a difference.

I made this cheesecake for New Year's Eve. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except used 4T of kahlua on the crust and 4T on the cheesecake per other reviewer's suggestions. I did also only use two packages of lady fingers sold by Trader Joe's (4.25 oz ea) and it was quite a lot. Overall the flavor turned out very good and tasted like tiramisu, but was a bit heavy, not creamy and I like cheesecake. I probably will stick to regular tiramisu instead.

Oh, my! This was VERY good! As many suggested, I added more Kahlua. I used a total of 6oz., 2 in the crust and 4 in the batter. I did add an extra egg with the extra liquid and the container of Marscapone I purchased was 12oz. I decorated the top of the cake with a mixture of 8oz cream cheese, 1 cup of sugar and a couple tablespoons of Kahlua to taste, piped on in swirls. I also spinkled cocoa powder over the top. Great cheesecake and would make it again!! Thanks!!

Delicious and creamy, this cheesecake is wonderful.  I would add a little espresso powder next time to the batter to bring out a little more coffee flavor.  I’m not sure of the purpose of the water at the bottom of the oven, this is not the same as a bain marie which I would do the next time. I lined the side of the pan with parchment paper but I still got a small crack.

Great recipe, i made individual cupcake size cheese cake instead of a 9 in one, and the cooking time is decreased to 20-23 min. I took the advice from several others who have reviewed and increased the amount of coffee liqueur to 4 tbs in the cake batter and 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoon in each cupcake (i used Bailey's)... I might add 2 more tbs of either liqueur or brewed dark coffee next time. 

The one problem i had with the cake was that it wasn't dense enough for me, it could be that i mixed t too much and it had lots of air bubbles. But either way, next time instead of adding 4 tbs of flour, i'm gonna add 1 - 1 1/2 cups of sour cream (idea taken from individual cheesecake recipe of joyofbaking.com) and see if the resulting cheesecake might be a little more solid. 

For topping i used whipped cream, coco powder, icing sugar and another two tablespoons or so of coffee liqueur.

The cheesecake was very good however I changed the recipe after making it the first time. If you are using an 8 inch pan I suggest using 3/4 the amount of crust and adding 4 tbsp of the coffee liquor instead of 2. I also added a semi sweet Ghirardeli 4 oz. chocolate bar to the cheesecake mix which made it taste even better

I make this all the time and my family loves it.  I double the liquor, I use Kahlua (my husband always says that it needs more) and I use vanilla wafers because I can never find ladyfingers.  I love it and would eat it daily if I could just burn off the calories.

My first attempt to cheesecake. I chose it because my son loves tiramisu and my husband loves cheesecake. So I thought : what a perfect combo! The flavor was great, but waaay too sweet! Definitely cut some the sugar and leave out the mascarpone, even though it gave it smoother texture, it took away from the tangy flavor that I was expecting. Also the recipe doesn't call for baking the crust first,  I substituted the ladyfingers with graham crackers and if you do this, I strongly suggest baking it for at least 15 min.  I baked it for only 7 min, it really needed twice that. I also left out the flour as one reviewer recommended. I'll add it next time to give it more caky consistency. I served it with fresh mango and blackberries to cut the sweetness, still not enough. Could only have a thin sliver. All in all I think it's a good recipe,except for the sweetness.

It's very good but like others have mentioned, the coffee liquour needs to be increased to 3+ tbsps.  Mine did break at the top but i made a top with dark chocolate and not only did it look nice the chocolate enhanced the coffee flavor.  Wish it wasn't so rich tough :0(

Awesome recipe, flavors are great - I did use the more traditional cocoa powder on top instead of grated chocolate, just knowing that's what my family is used to, and extra ladyfingers for decoration.  Thanks!

I made this cheesecake, with minor variations and everyone LOVED it!!  I could not find ladyfingers at my Safeway so I used nilla wafers instead.  Also, I could not find coffee flavored liqueur and my store so I used regular coffee for the crust, just enough so that it was moist enough to press into the pan.  For the filling, instead of the liqueur, I found tiramisu mascarpone cheese at safeway (regular price $4.99/8oz, on sale it was $2.29).  I topped the cheesecake with grated chocolate and whipped cream before serving.

The cheesecake itself had a great texture! I did not taste the tiramisu aspect of it though. I made a chocolate ganache and poured it over the cheesecake. It was so good..on the way home from work i was thinking about taking a bit!

I got dark chocolate squares instead of semi-sweet, because I think dark chocolate goes better with coffee-flavored things.  I'm not an experienced cook, and here are some frustrating lessons I had to learn for this recipe:  1. Coffee-flavored liqueur is the same thing as kahlua, and you can only get this in liquor stores.  As someone who doesn't drink, this was news to me.  2. I could only find the mascarpone cheese and ladyfingers at Whole Foods; not at my everyday grocery stores.  And the ladyfingers came in 3.5 oz boxes, not 12 oz boxes.   Despite my frustrations finding ingredients, the cheesecake turned out great!

This cheesecake was always a hit at my job when I made it. Instead of sprinkling the chocolate on top, I made dark chocolate ganache using more Kahlua and poured it over the top. I also followed user suggestions and put a splash (literally!) more Kahlua into the batter (but not into the crust).

Good cheesecake, but it didn't remind me of tiramisu at all.  I followed others' suggestions and put 4 tablespoons of Kahlua in both the crust and the cheesecake.  Unfortunately that was all I could taste in the end! Definitely add whipped cream and crushed dark chocolate chips, that spices the look up a bit.

Wonderful recipe :)  I couldn't find the ladyfingers to save my life!  I used 5oz of crushed shortbread cookies and halfed the butter for the crust.  It covered my 8in springform nicely.  I added 10T of the liquer in the batter and 2T in the crust and it came out wonderful.  I bought unsweetened cocoa powder for the top.  Will make again...... and again!

If you want to impress someone, make this dessert for them ! It was outstanding!  I made my own coffee liquer by following an online recipe as I wanted to use it for a tiramisu white cake recipe.  Do as other readers suggest and use more than the required number of tablespoons of coffee liquer for the crust and the cheesecake filling so you will have more coffee flavor.  This cheesecake was so good, I made 2  in 2 days; one for family who really loved it so I made another one for Mother's Day to give to my mom.  We all thought this was better and fresher than the Cheesecake Factory.

The texture was sublime and velvety - wonderful. Presentation was beautiful and got lots of ooohs and aaaahs. People really liked it but I thought it was lacking in flavor for as much good stuff as there was in it. Probably too expensive to try this one again.

I made this cheesecake for my in-laws recently and it was gone in 24 hrs.   My father-in-law is not a fan of dessert but he was the first one to finish his piece.  I couldn't find lady fingers at my grocery store so I substituted 1 pkg. Stella D'oro margherite cookies (I used just the vanilla ones and will use the chocolate cookies for another dessert). The cheesecake tasted great with the cookie crust.  Definately will make this cheesecake again.

I made this but had to use a few subsitutions.  I couldn't find ladyfingers or marsacapone cheese.  So I used crushed chocolate teddy grahams crackers for the crust and the cheese sub in the reviews, using 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup cream.  I did end up using more cream to thin out the batter.  Topped with whipped cream and grated chocolate.

This was a great cheesecake, however, it did not taste anything like Tiramisu. I followed other reviewers suggestions and put 4 tbsp of coffee liquor in the crust and 6 in the batter, I also dusted the top with cocoa power and cooked it in a water bath for 45 min. Everyone loved it, it just didn't really taste like Tiramisu.

I really had high hopes for this recipe.  I'm being generous with 4 stars.  The flavor of the filling was good, and quite true to 'tiramisu'. However, the crust was a huge disappointment...especially after all that work to crush the ladyfingers!  You DEFINITELY need more butter in the crust.  And baking time is WAY too short.  Even after adding 20 min. bake time, it was still gooey in the middle.  Sigh.  I'll try again with modifications.

Not like the tiramisu flavor I have experienced. Was more like Kahlua flavor. I did use kahlua for the coffee liquer ingredient which I think imparted a flavor too strong for this recipe. Used lady fingers for crust but I think I like graham crust for cheesecake.

Yum, yum, yum!  Thanks for the recipe.  Made this for my sister-in-laws b-day and she was in heaven.  Notes:  In my parts lady fingers come in 3 oz. packages - that is 12 lady fingers.  I used 18 lady fingers (4.5 oz).  Up'd the liquer to 4 and 4 and it was great.  A dark chocolate / Kahula ganache on top made this divine.

This was a huge hit at work. I only had 3 oz of lady fingers and would do 6 oz next time. I'm a coffee lover and would either add more liquour or supercharge with some instant espresso for a stronger coffee flavor.

very good and easy recipe- I added more mascarpone cheese than what the recipe called for and it turned out less thick and very light. Thank  you for sharing this recipe, will treasure it for a long time.

This was so so good!  Mine came out really thick, but I didn't have any cream like the recipe said, so I just spooned it into the pan.  I didn't have very high hopes for it after that, but it was amazing.  Thank you so much!

Despite doubling the coffee liqueur, I still couldn't taste it. The cheesecake had a nice flavor and consistency without the 'tiramisu' effect. I covered it with a chocolate ganache as suggested by another reviewer (Ganache I on this website)-- which I think saved it. Overall, it was a huge success and I will definitely make this combination again.

This cheesecake was awesome!  You have to follow the reviewers' advice though and not the recipe to a "T."  I added more kahlua to both the crust and the filling.  Marscapone cheese is worth the extra expense in this case!  Also, the bakery I went to only had enough for one cheesecake and I was making 3, so I substituted the shortcakes found in the produce department (near the strawberries).  They weren't much different in texture than the ladyfingers but they were slightly sweeter.  Either way, I am now making these in muffin cups to "WOW" the bake sale patrons at our annual church festival!!  Won't they be lucky!! Also, this site offers some very helpful cheesecake advice and how to bake them properly.  Take these ingredients and follow their suggestions if you think that will avoid some of the problem other reviewers had.  Thanks for sharing such an amazing recipe! I think it has become my favorite cheesecake!

This was my first ever cheesecake and I have just one word...AWESOME!!!  I had to do some running around to find the mascarpone cheese, and to get a spring form pan, but it was well worth it!  I think it turned out better than any store bought cheese cake or restaurant dessert that I have ever had!  A favorite for any cheese cake or Tiramisu lover!!!

I was on the quest for the perfect tiramisu cheesecake recipe.  I went to the  Cheesecake Factory and tasted theirs and knew there was a recipe out there.  I tried this one except I had on hand 2 - 8oz packages of cream cheese and 2 - 8oz packages of Marscarpone cheese.  I also used 1- 7 oz box of DRIED lady fingers (Savioardi).  And I followed anothers advice about doubling the coffee liquor.  The results were fantastic!!!  Will definitely be making this again with the changes!! Thanks Marty!

This recipe is really good but it tasted too much like cheesecake and not enough like Tiramisu. Not enough cofee taste or chocolate. I would also have made more layers than this recipe recomends. This is a really tasty Cheesecake but not a very great Tiramisu.

This receipe totally rocked.  I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but my family is.
I used the blender that I received for Christmas to blend the ingredients, rather
than a mixer.  The filling was creamy and perfect.  This is the first cheesecake
that I have ever made that didn't sink slightly in the middle.  Everyone, thought
it was absolutely the best cheesecake that they've ever had.  I concur wholeheartedly.

Quick, easy, wonderful!  I did like everyone else and doubled the amount of Kahlua, 
and since I couldn't find any ladyfingers in Houston, I used 'Nilla wafers...I have NOT 
stopped getting compliments.  Don't worry about serving this to kids...all the alcohol 
bakes out of the cake, if they'll eat it, let 'em!

This cheesecake recipie is so good!  Take your time and make sure the ladyfingers are crumbled very fine and use Kahlua Liqueur.  It will turn out just like a gourmet Italian desert!  It is the best cheesecake I've made yet and I am a lover of cheesecake!

This cheesecake is delicious! The packages of lady fingers at my grocery store are 3oz each.  I feel like 12oz makes too thick of a crust.  3 pkgs seems just right.  I added an extra Tbs of Kahlua to the crust and 2 extra to the cheesecake.  Before serving, I piped whipped cream whipped with 3Tbs of powdered sugar, 2Tbs of kahlua and 1 Tbs of espresso powder, then shaved chocolate on the middle.

Great receipt. I took other reviewer's suggestion  and increased the Kahlua. And I wasn't tasting enough Kahlua. So, I put half of the fillings in, then layered a layer Kahlua soaked ladyfingers, and then, poured in the rest of the filling. It was amazing. Just the right amount of Kahlua taste. I also whipped cream with chocolate powder and more Kahlua.

This was a fantastic cheesecake! I did double the Kahlua as others suggested. I also could not find ladyfingers anywhere(!?) So made a boxed pound cake and crumbled that. I also topped it, declaratively with homemade whipped cream and added Kahlua to that! Delicious!

I modified the recipe a little after 2 tries. I added 3 eggs instead of 2. Used 3 tbsp. of corn starch instead of flour. I gave it a water bath so it didn't brown the top as much. Also, it took another 30 minutes to cook completely. Overall, it's really good recipe. My husband brought it to his work and everyone loved it !

I made this for my mother on Mother's Day because she loves tiramisu and we both have a weakness for cheesecake. It came out great. She loved it. I made it a second time and did add more Khalua to it. I'm not a big fan of tiramisu myself, but it was pretty good and so easy to make.

Mmmmmm this was awesome! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because if I hadn't put in more coffee liquer like other reviewers suggested it would have been bland for me. I put 4 tablespoons on the crust and almost 8 in the batter. I didn't have mascarpone cheese so I did the 8 oz of cream cheese quarter cup of cream substitute and also I couldn't find ladyfingers so I used nilla wafers. It cracked a tiny bit so I made a little chocolate gnache for the top and that just made it perfect. Will definitely always do that. Definitely a keeper!

I took the advice of others and doubled up on the coffee liqueur both in the crust and the filling.  I can't really say that it tasted like Tiramisu, though it was very good.  There really wasn't a hint of the mascarpone except for maybe it added to the silkiness of the cheesecake.  In any event, it impressed my neighborly taste-testers who are always looking to see what type of treat awaits.

This recipe is pretty good. The only few changes I would make: Up the amount of liqueur as other users mentioned. I pre-baked the crust about 5-10 minutes. I could not find ladyfingers so I used a mix of vanilla and chocolate cookies. 12 oz package may be TOO much for crust. I used less than that. I also baked this in a water bath (instead of steaming on the lower rack). Also, it probably could do without the flour (or less amount). I would make this again!

Outstanding! Served this New Year's Eve 2012-3 and was a hit! I took suggestion made by another and doubled the Kahlua. Next time will go 3x recipe as it was so smooth and creamy and not overpowering, it needs more. Crust was a bit dry so will ensure more moisture there as well, butter & Kahlua should do it. Package of Lady Fingers I bought was 14 oz. and I used it all which is part of the reason for dryness. I did compensate this time w/extra T of butter and Kahlua but needed a bit more. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese which worked fine.

Me and my family really enjoyed this recipe, however I had to make a few adjustments because I was unable to find some of the ingredients.
I ended up using brandy instead of coffee liqueur, and coffee flavored mascarpone. 
My dad loved this cheese cake so much he was speechless!
their only complaint was that they could not taste the liquor, so I would recommend adding maybe 4 tablespoons to the crust?
I will defiantly be making this recipe again if I can find some coffee liqueur. Defiantly a keeper!

When I made this, it ended up cracking badly, so I covered it in a chocolate ganache to disguise them and dipped the backs of ladyfingers in the ganache and arranged them around the side.  Also, I used 6 oz of Nilla wafers and 3 oz of ladyfingers for the crust (plus the butter, of course).

Delicious! 
-Made a few modifications, didn't have Kaluha so I mixed espresso & rum. About 40% rum and 60% espresso (with a spoon of sugar added). 
-Increased rum/espresso to 4 tbs. in crust and also in cheesecake
-12 oz of ladyfingers is waaaay too much, didn't even use half of that, will cut that in half next time.
-Allowed ingredients to warm up to room temp. before 

Served it at a dinner party and it was a huge hit.

This is a scrumptious cheesecake! I adore tiramisu, and cheesecake, so what better combo for me?! I also doubled the kahlua and added espresso powder and it was the perfect blend of flavors. I got rave reviews from some very picky family members, so I know what dessert I'll be taking each year for Thanksgiving from now on!

I followed the recipe except added a teaspoon more of the coffee flavored liquer to the ladyfingers and to the filling.  I couldn't believe that the recipe needed 4 packages (3 oz each) of lady fingers.  I used the cake style and reduced them to crumbs in my blender.  I really did need all 4 packages! For the topping I whipped heavy whipping cream, cocoa and powdered sugar and piped it onto the cake.  Oh so yummy and impressive!

This was okay. It didn't really have tiramisu flavor. The kahlua isn't enough to bolden the flavor. Next time I plan on adding some instant espresso powder to the batter and sprinkling some cocoa powder on top for both flavor and aesthetics.

This turned out amazing! I made it for my mom's birthday and we all agreed that we have NEVER had such a delicious cheesecake. As suggested by several other reviews, I did increase the coffee liqueur by two tablespoons in both the crust and the cheesecake mixture. I also had to use vanilla wafers instead of ladyfingers because I couldn't find any. I used a Demarle flexipan instead of a springform and had no cracking. It turned out beautifully! I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe for my family's Memorial Day party and everyone loved it. I attempted to garnish the top with whipped cream but I think I did something wrong because the whipped cream ended up flat. Apparently the family didn't care because the ate every bit and were looking for more.

What a great recipe! I followed a couple of the suggestions- including adding more Kahlua, and it turned out fantastic. I did end up making my own ladyfingers because the local grocery store didn't have them, and the crust was to die for!

I also used more liquer.  4 TBS in crust and 6 TBS in filling.  Instead of using ladyfingers, I used a mix of regular and chocolate graham cracker crumbs for a sturdier crust.  Very good!

Fantastic! My first try making cheesecake, and everyone loved it. I did add extra coffee flavored liqor to add taste and soften the cheese. I would aslo recommend letting it set over night in the fridge, as the consistency was just right after the second day.

I have made this recipe several times and love it. I do use vanilla wafers (not quite the whole box) instead of lady fingers. I also use a shot of espresso from starbucks instead of the coffee flavored liqueur. Very good!!

This was excellent. However, I had to triple the butter to make the ladyfingers moist. Not sure why that was. Otherwise excellent!

Good cheesecake. I did make some adjustments, of course! First off, it took 60 mins to bake for me then left it in for 20 mins. I did use 4T Kahula in the crust and 8T in the cream. Before serving, we made some chocolate ganache and added Kahula, left this sit until room temp. and poured on top! Yummy!

YUMMY. this was sooo good. it was light and fluffy, even though i used two packets of fat-free cream cheese and one full fat. i stuck close to the recipe, because i am a beginner cheesecake maker. it was SO GOOD. i drizzled melted chocolate over the top, and grated chocolate like the recipe suggested. 

delicious!

This dessert is sooo good.
You can substitute vanilla wafers for ladyfingers and regular cream cheese instead of mascarpone.
Also add more coffee liquer for a stronger flavor.

Although we dug into the cheesecake an hour after it came out of the oven (it was gooey and did not have time to set) I really did not enjoy the lady finger crust. It just had too much essence. The topping was fabulous. Just because it was so much work and it didn't come out as fancy as I would have imagined, I rated it lower

It was just ok.  I would not call it a tiramisu cheesecake...but more like Kaluha cheesecake.  It was good, but not what was expected. I would make a different cheesecake next time.

This was my first cheesecake experience, and it couldn't have been easier.  I topped the cake with chocolate whipped cream and chocolate shavings and served it with chocolate-flavored coffee.  Everyone at my dinner party loved it!  I'll definitely make it again.

The cheesecake looked beautiful!!! No cracks (because of the pan of water.) It was lacking in flavor--next time I will definetly double the liquor.  I'm sure w/ that it will get the 5 stars)

This is the best (not to mention foolproof) recipe

Excellent - I used 12-14 oz of crushed shortbread cookies in lieu of the ladyfingers.  I also used 2 TBSP coffee liqueur for crust and 3 TBSP for the filling.  I made this for a catered event and it was met with a lot of ohhs and ahhs.  I topped it with a whipped chocolate ganache topping  and shaved chocolate curls.  It was beautiful!

Wow. Yummy. I wanted a thick, dense cheesecake so I skipped the waterbath (personally I don't care if it cracks). I also topped with cocoa and semisweet chocolate chips-yum! I forgot to add the coffee liqueur to the cheese so I just poured a little on each piece. Very, very good. I will definitely make this again.

This was such a wonderfully easy recipe to make.  The first time I made it, it came out very thick and heavy, so I modified it a bit to make it a little more light and whipped.  I substituted one of the packages of cream cheese for 1 cup of sour cream.  The cheesecake still came out delicious and was a big hit.  I also used 4 T of Kahlua for the wet mix and only 2 T for the crust.  In addition, I only used 2 (3 oz) pkgs of lady fingers.  It was plenty for the crust.  Hope this is helpful.

I made this cheesecake for a Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit.  I doubled the liquer in both the crust and the filling, and used tiramisu-flavored mascarpone.  Once I figured out how to process the ladyfingers into crumbs (a blender with a "crumb" option works great), it was a very easy recipe.

Excellent recipe!! I made this for a family cocktail party and everyone loved it. I did as others suggested, I doubled the kahlua in both the crust and the filling. Very rich and creamy and the ladyfinger crust was great with a great flavor of the kahlua. I dusted the top of the cake with cocoa powder right before serving. Will make again!!

The cake was delicious... Marscapone cheese was exactly the missing ingredient I was looking for in baking an excellent cheesecake!! However I felt that the coffee liqueur was not enough because we couldn't really taste it in the cake.  Will definitely try it again but with a little more coffee liqueur! Great recipe and a great product to try out.

This dessert was the hit of our holiday gathering. Everyone wanted the recipe! I doubled the Kahlua as recomended in the other reviews which worked great. With less I think you would have trouble telling it from a plain cheesecake.
Very easy!

Great recipe!  Thank you all for the suggestions.  I did add 2 additional tablespoons of coffee liqueur to the crust and also to the batter. I added a teaspoon of espresso powder to the batter as well.  I baked in a water bath after I foiled the bottom of the springform pan. I topped it off with ghiardelli chocolate shavings and heavy whipping cream to which I added powdered sugar and a teaspoon of espresso powder to taste.  Everyone loved it especially the birthday girl.  I even had one person tell me it was their new favorite!!

YUM! The only deliberate changes I made were to add the extra coffee liqueur that most reviewers mentioned.  Also, I happened to see Toll house espresso morsels in grocery store. I lieu of shaved chocolate, I crushed half a handful of semi-sweet morsels and the same amount of the espresso morsels.  I combined those and sprinkled a wide band around perimeter of cake. Yummy! One accidental change I made - I forgot the flour. Just cooked it a bit longer and refrigerated for 24 hours. No problem. Delicious!!

i used both coffee grounds and a triple espresso shot from starbucks. The triple espresso i added to batter slowly while mixing, and stopped when it got too liquid like. you can balance out with extra flour. Also baste crust in rum when cooled.
also use coffee liquor in batter, and when you are ready to serve reduce coffee liquor and powered sugar on stove top stirring non stop. remove from heat, let stand to begin thickening, and drizzle over pieces while cooling.
Also, enjoy the left over coffee liquor, rum, and milk together similar to a black Russian.

This is one of our favorite special occasion cheesecakes.  I  do 1 1/2 with the coffee liquor; it adds just a little more tiramisu flavor to the dessert. Thanks for a great dessert

I made this to take to a work function.  I have not tasted it yet.  It turned out beautiful with no cracks.  I made a coffee icing for the top then added the shaved chocolate.  I will update this once everyone has tried it.  It sure does look good.

I turned out fantastic. The only thing I'll try to do different is soak the ladyfingers in the Kahlua before placing it in the spring form pan so it wouldn't be too hard at the bottom.

Following many of the other reviewers suggestions, I put 3 T coffee liqueur in the crust and I dissolved 2 packets of espresso powder (like Starbucks Via) in the remaining coffee liqueur (I used 3 T there as well) in with the cream cheese mixture. Make sure that your cheesecake is completely cool before putting it in the fridge; mine took way longer than 30 minutes to cool. I made this recipe for my coworker's birthday. He said that this was his favorite of everything that I've ever made!

It was excellent.  A few small changes.  I thought there was way too much crust.  cut it down to 9 oz of ladyfingers.  I find that using melted butter doesn't work as well as putting soft butter in with the lady fingers and mixing it in with a pastry blender.  It also mixes in the liqueur better and breaks up any additional pieces of the ladyfingers.    I topped it with cream cheese chocolate icing and everyone loved it.

Added 4 Tbs Kahlua and 2 Tbs espresso and used a water bath instead, but unfortunately the cheesecake never set up despite baking it for extra time.

I make several cheesecakes a year and this has won its way into the top of our rotation! Delicious as written, but better with more kahlua in the crust and filling, as suggested by many reviewers. Second time I could not find lady fingers, substituted vanilla wafers, very little difference. I also like to substitute 2 low-fat cream cheese and one regular to lighten the flavor and calories. The key to successful cheesecakes: Room temp ingredients, don't over-beat, let cool one hour in oven with oven door cracked open before cooling on counter. Must chill for 24 hours for best texture and flavors. Thanks for a winning recipe!

Tastes good, substituted coffee liqueur with super strong espresso and as ladyfingers are sponge cake and soft, I toasted for 15 minutes at 350 and let cool to dry out before crushing in food processor. Also greased the pan too.

Made this for Christmas Eve dessert and it went over very well!  It was almost embarrassing that it received so much attention as I wasn't the host.  Be warned, though... 12 oz package of Lady Fingers, crushed, would be way too much for the crust!  I live near an Italian grocery store and they don't even carry 12oz packages, only 7 or 14 or 17oz.  I bought the 14oz and intended to use most of it, but ended up only using half.  I did increase the Kahlua, both in the crust and the batter, as per suggestions. Making it again for tomorrow night's New Year's Eve party.

We were disappointed, frankly. Served to non-drinkers so substituted espresso for coffee flavored liqueur. Wound up tasting nothing like tiramisu.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It came out of the oven looking beautiful.  However, when I cut into it, the middle was runny,  and the crust was way to thick.  I didn't have an 8 inch pan, so I used a 9 inch and baked it for 50 min.  There was so much crust and batter it never would have fit into an 8 inch pan.   I served it on Christmas day , and needless to say I was embarrassed in front of my company.  This recipe needs to be re-calculated. ( It did taste good, though)

This was a decent cheesecake.  I couldn't find ladyfingers so I googled substitutions and I used a pound cake cut up and dried in a low-heat oven and then smashed to crumbs.  I think it could use a bit more coffee liqueur as it just tasted like plain cheesecake to me.

This is so good! I followed others recommendations and used 5 Tbs in the crust and 10ish in the cheesecake. I only had a 10" pan but it still was perfect. I did not use the water in the oven and had no cracks. Would make again!

Great recipe, I used the mascarpone substitute and additional Kahlua, as mentioned by others, and shortbread cookies for the crust, when I realized my package of ladyfingers was only 4 oz, not 12! Sifted dark chocolate cocoa on top, garnished with whipped cream and ladyfingers around the side of the cake (to resemble traditional tiramisu in a bowl). Served at Christmas dinner, our 22 guests raved about it.

This was my first time making a cheesecake too and I was thrilled with the outcome!  I read a lot of the reviews and made a lot of the suggested changed ie 4T of Kahlua in the crust and another 4T in the cream cheese mix.  I placed the springform pan in a slow cooker bag and sat it in a pan of water.  It turned out perfectly without a crack and everyone loved it!

I loved it and so did my guests. The only thing I added was the decorative swirls on top as pictured with a cream cheese decorative bag. This step wasn't in the directions.

Yes, and I suggest adding more Kahlua and also some Expresso to moisten the Lady Fingers. The crust was too dry. Otherwise,  it was a good dessert.

3 stars for the original recipe; 4 stars with changes I made to the original; maaaaaybe 5 stars with yet more changes.

Personal preference at play a bit here. Definitely needed more rum AND dark coffee than original recipe suggests: I went closer to 5 tbs in the crust & 10 tbs in the filling.  Definitely gave it the tiramisu flavour. I wouldn't recommend going less.  The filling was dense whereas a tiramisu is usually creamier; I'd try leaving out the flour next time. 

Do not need 12oz pkg of ladyfingers! I ended up with waaay too much crust and I used a 9" pan! A 7oz pkg would have been enough. 

I found the sweetness of the ladyfinger crust didn't marry well with the rum/coffee/cream cheese flavours of the filling.  I added milk chocolate curls and cocoa powder to the top to create some unity of flavours and this helped a bit.

This was super delicious. Tastes like cheesecake and tiramisu had a baby. I made it exactly as described.  It made a bit extra so I think there would be enough to make it in a 9 inch round pan. I’ll definitely be making this again.

Like other reviewers suggested, I added additional coffee.  When I make tiramisu, I use espresso powder packets and water for strong  coffee and add dark rum, so that is what I had on hand.  I made 3/4 cup and added 4 T to crust and 8 T to batter.  I baked as directed, let cool out of oven for about 1.5 hours before putting it in fridge.  I topped it with chocolate rum ganache. Company loved it, so did family!

I made it exactly as written. Brought it to a dinner party. Was embarrassed when it turned out awful. The crust was way too thick, Looked just like to photo. The cheesecake part was delicious, but the crust was terrible. Will try it again with homemade sponge.

Omg! This cheesecake is AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly except  I added  more coffee liqueur like it was suggested by others ( 5 to the crust and 10 to the batter).  This definitely will be one of my top “impress the guests” desserts!!

Really easy recipe for a cheesecake. I replaced the mascarpone with cream cheese and sugar mix as one of the reviews suggested, dunked the cake in liqueur and loved it. Will make again!

There was too much crust for my liking, and I only used 9 ounces of ladyfingers.  The filling was smooth.

Added a 1/2 cup of Kahlua to the cheesecake mixture and 1/4 of Kahlua + 2 TBSP of coffee to the crust mixture.  I only had a 10" inch springform pan and that worked well given it seems like a lot of crust for an 8" pan.  Cheesecake was great, lots of compliments.  Will make again.

This was probably the best dessert I ever made! It got rave reviews from all 5 people that I had over for dinner. Even my father in law who admitted he is not fond of cheesecake really liked this. Definite restaurant quality! I used vanilla wafers instead of the ladyfingers and used 2 Tbsp espresso ( I made an instant espresso cup) and 2 Tbsp coffee liquor in the crust. For the filling I used 4 Tbsp espresso and 4 Tbsp coffee liquor. I grated chocolate on top, but later thought I should have used dark chocolate or even dark chocolate coffee beans to grate on top. Yum!

Delicious cheesecake. I've found that topping it with caramel or chocolate sauce helps add to the flavor. Also just using plain coffee instead of coffee liquor works as well.

This is a great recipe.  I added my own punch.  1 1/2 cups heavy cream, 2 T of coffee liquor, 2 T chocolate powder and 1/2 cup powder sugar and made whipped cream and dolloped on top.  Heaven.

Made this for a friend's birthday. Used the suggestions for making the equivalent of mascarpone (sour cream plus whipping cream plus cream cheese). It was amazing! So good, light, creamy, decadent... I did up the Kahlua to 8 tablespoons as well. So incredibly good, definitely making this again!

I made this cheesecake according to the recipe.  It was pretty blah.  If I were to make it again (which I doubt I will do), I would definitely add more coffee liqueur and/or instant espresso powder and maybe some cocoa.

Lots of changes,  I used chocolate wafer crumbs +2 Tbsps of butter +2 Tbsp coffee  lliqueur and 2 Tbsp of expresso,  pressed it into an 8 inch pan and baked it for 10 minutes at 325. For the filling I used 6 Tbs of coffee liqueur and 2 Tbsp of expresso.  I used the lady fingers I had already purchased by dipping them into coffee liqueur and lining buttered sides of the pan then pouring the batter into it.  I covered the sides of the pan with aluminum foil, placed it into a water bath and baked it 20 minutes longer than it called for since it was so thick.

Finishing it, I poured 1/2 recipe of ganache from this site, placing the leftover 4 lady fingers and dressing the edge with whipped cream.  It was great and really did have the tiramisu flavor I was looking for.

I made this twice. Each time I halved the amount of ladyfingers and butter in the crust. I used ricotta instead of the mascarpone because that is what I had. I whirled it around in the food processor before adding the other ingredients to make it creamy. And I increased the coffee liqueur in the cheese filling to about 1/4 cup. 

The first time I added a ganache topping (made from 2oz semisweet chocolate in 1/4 cup of boiling cream with 1/2 tablespoon coffee liqueur added). 

The other time I topped it with a mix of 230ml whipping cream beaten with 2 tablespoons cocoa and 2 tablespoons icing sugar and 1 tablespoon coffee liqueur. 

Both times it was delicious. Maybe next time, I'll try adding some cinnamon.

Amazing! I changed a few things, I added Captain Morgan's spiced rum, and coffee (half and half).  I took the suggestion of 10 tbs. for the cheesecake and it came out wonderfully.  I also did not use chocolate, but made a homemade whipped cream to go on top.  The cheesecake is very dense, flavorful and filling, chocolate is almost an overkill on this; and I love chocolate.  I have been asked to make this as my teenage daughter's birthday cake, instead of a cake.  A huge hit in the house!

I made it twice. The first time I was too impatient to wait overnight to eat it. The center was a little soft, but everyone loved it just the same. The second time I let it sit overnight in the frig and it turned out perfect. I followed the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the amount of coffee flavored liqueur in the cake and frosting.

I read the reviews and tasted the coffee liqueur first. Starbucks was the winner by a long shot. Most tasted like maple syrup in comparison. I double the amount of liqueur in the lady fingers and tripled it in the filling. The filling was so good I'm surprised there was enough left to put in the oven.  >>>Update: Since Starbucks? no longer makes coffee liqueur I made some espresso in a two serving Mocha Cafe maker, added at least 2 tablespoons to the crust and the rest to the cheesecake. I cut the crust way down too. I used one row of lady fingers this time instead of three. It turned out to be about a cup of crumbs which I used the food processor to crush. I bake the crust about 5 minutes to dry it out before adding the batter since I used so much more liquid. My family and my Italian 'in-laws' loved it.

I haven't yet tried this, but I do love tiramisu.  Are there any substitutes for the Kahlua, as we don't use alcohol.  I'd love to try this!  I give a 5* because it sounds wonderful!

I wish I could give this a 3.5...
I made this when my Italian in-laws came over...I figured they would be the best judges.   I sprinkled the top with cocoa powder and immediately they thought it was Tiramisu. They tried it & liked it but most of them commented that it was more of a coffee flavoured cheesecake & they didn't get the Tiramisu taste.

I had leftovers that I shared with others & many made the same comments. A few people suggested maybe adding a topping of fruit or whipped cream or even pouring some espresso over it before serving or adding a different liqueur that you would be used in Tiramisu (ie Brandy)

It came out looking beautiful and didn't crack. As many other reviewers suggested I used doubled the amount of Kahlua in the crust & filling and added a little espresso to the filling.  I'm not sure if this contributed to the coffee flavour confusion but I feel without these additions the cake would have been very plain cheesecake tasting.  I won't be rushing to make this again although people said it tasted good it was disappointed that it didn't live up to it's Tiramisu name/flavouring -  IF i make it again i will be calling it a "Coffee Cheesecake".  I will definitely be using the idea of lady fingers as a crust for another cake though.

I really didn't think this was anything special but there was nothing wrong with it. I added more kahlua in both crust and cheesecake and also added 1 tsp espresso powder to cheesecake. Coffee taste was still very mild which it should be.

This recipe did not live up to my tiramisu expectations.  The cheesecake part was a bit too heavy.  I would put more espresso into next time.

This recipe was my first attempt at cheesecake and it came out superb.  I increased the baking time by about 20 minutes, and increased the coffee liquer a little.  But the cheesecake was absolutely fantastic and a lot less work than I was anticipating.  I use this recipe as the base for all my flavored cheesecakes, just substituted ricotta for the mascapone, and different flavored liquers for the coffee.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the taste in general was great however the lady fingers were too dry prepared this way and detracted from the great taste combination of the other ingredients. I will try again but next time I will try dipping the ladyfingers or perhaps using a moister cake in place of them.

Good flavors.  Make sure you don't overmix the batter...I did and it was too dense, more like a cake.  Still was a great dessert.

I made this for my first "Italian Christmas Eve" dinner and it was a BIG hit.  They wanted to know if I had made more than one!  I did as previously advised by other reviewers and doubled the coffee liqueur in both the crust and the filling.  I also made a ganache for the top with chocolate, cream and the coffee liqueur - DELICIOUS!!!!

I made this for a college graduation party!  The only complaint is I should have made at least two!  The ingredients are a bit pricy (Marscapone is too "exotic" for most grocery stores in my area, so I had to go to a gourmet store), but overall it was worth it.  Thanks for submitting!

A huge hit with my very italian, cheesecake-loving famliy!  Making it was difficult, however, and I was unable to avoid a large crack down the middle.  The ingredients added up to be quite expensive, especially the marscapone cheese, which can also be difficult to find.  But it was worth the effort - it was creamy and delicious.  There was very little left over, and unfortunately the cat found her way into it!
