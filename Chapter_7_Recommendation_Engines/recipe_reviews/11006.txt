These are awesome to take to a summer cookout.  I take the easy way out - I use cans of green (lettuce), yellow (mustard) and pink (ketchup) decorator icing.  Just squeeze the icing close enough to the edge of the cookies (top and bottom buns) for the frosting to ooze out a bit when the 'burger' is added.  They are better if prepared the day before - the vanilla wafer gets a chance to soften a bit.  For the burger I use Keebler's Grasshopper cookies.

These are so adorable.  I did substitute the peppermint patty for a keebler fudge shop caramel-filled cookie.  The edges really look burgerish.  I also used cans of frosting for the lettuce, ketchup & mustard.  As an added touch, I got a frozen pound cake and cut it down to string fries size.  I added that to the tin and it makes a great Christmas gift.  I can't wait to try this for summer bar-b-ques.  What a treat.

I took these to a bake sale. I put each cookie in a muffin paper liner with about 1/8 cup Hickory Sticks - Looked JUST like a mini burger and fries. They sold quickly, and were very easy to whip up as we ran out..great recipe!!

I made many changes to this recipe...but it is fun.  I used the Keebler Fudge Shoppe, Carmel filled cookies and the flavor profile is much more palatable than the mint cookies.  I used coconut for the lettuce, red and yellow icing tubes for the ketchup and mustard.  They were a huge hit at the last BBQ.

This is an adorable idea! Went across well at a kids outing at church.
For the veiwer who gave 3 stars because she "couldn't eat them"--get real! Rate the recipe as written, not your personal issues.
That is the one thing about this site that aggravates me!

AWESOME! Can't tell you what a hit this was with 2-12 year olds. Brought to my 6yr old nephew's bday party and he screamed "Krabby Patties!" (after Sponge Bob tv show). So they are now called Krabby Patties!! I used a brush of honey to stick the sesame seeds on the Nilla wafer "buns" and a little to stick all the layers together. Used yellow and red food coloring mixed with vanilla icing to make "ketchup" and "cheese or mustard" (piped in using plastic bag with corner cut off). The green colored coconut is so realistic looking as lettuce! Took advice from reviewers and used Keebler mint grasshopper cookies for the patty. So incredibly cute. Time consuming, so only made 12. Kids can help make too. Thank you!!!!

Adults love it too.  
I LOVE THE PICKLES AND CHEESE!!!  
I have made these before.  But the recipe I had didn't have the "pickles" or "cheese"!!  This takes a little time but the results are REALLY worth the compliments!

These look fantastic... I used Grasshopper cookies for the patties and Rips brand sour candy for lettuce/tomatoes. Couldn't find any orange/apricot fruit leather, so I went with cherry-orange Fruit Roll-Ups.  I used yellow frosting as mustard to stick the top bun on, and used a mix of water and pancake syrup to get the seeds to stick (water wasn't enough).  Can't wait to show them to my students!

These are great fun for my kids. We made them at our last cookout. There were about 20 kids and it kept them very busy so the adults could chat. Great for the kids creativity. A mess to clean up, but isn't anything that involves 20 kids a mess?

So CUTE!! Had these at a Margaritaville party and they sub-ed as our cheese burgers in paradise. Not a one was left. Folks thought that were tasty and alot of fun. I skipped the coconut party and used Keeblers grasshopper cookies and regular store bought sugar cake icing. Also my store did not have any apricot or peach roll ups so I skipped and used yellow icing to mimic the cheese and green icing for the lettuce, they were a big hit!

I've been making these for almost 30 years (since my kids were little)!  They are great for summer picnics, birthday parties and to take to any event with kids!  I made these for a nursing home BBQ and they were a big hit!  Keebler Grasshopper cookies work very well as the 'burger' and I tint coconut green to use for lettuce and red fruit leather to use for the tomatoes.  The sesame seeds on top make it look authentic.  I use a tiny bit of honey to make them stick

It's funny, but we used to make these in college (back in the late 80's) for our Sunday School classes and then for our kids when we were doing our student teaching.  I hadn't made these in years though and had all but forgotten about them until I saw these in my e-mail today!  We used to use marshmallow cream to get the patties to stick to the bottom "bun" and sometimes would add a little red & yellow food coloring for the top dollop to get the "lettuce" to stick in order to make it look like the "special" sauce added on a big mac.  We were always able to get small french fry bags (called kid-sized now, I think) from McD's back then (don't think you could now probably b/c of legal reasons) and we'd slide the "burgers" in along with some potato sticks (those wafer thin ones that you can get in cans in the potato chip aisle) for a truly happy "meal".  Thanks for adding this and bringing up many happy memories from my college days over 20 years ago!  :)

the IDEA & DESIGN was the best but the flavors did not sound appealing to me. So i changed it up. Still looked so cute. i used nillas, oreo fudge cremes (thats all they had at store other then grasshoppers) and frosting as condiments. they tasted great that way.

I"ve made these for years as well.  I use Oreo cookies for the pattie.  The white cream from the oreo cookie becomes mayonaise.  I prefer using red and yellow frosting as ketchup and mustard, along with the green coconut.

Simply magical!  Kids adore these and it's so easy to be creative with them!  I admit, I was scared they would look great but not taste that good, but I was wrong.  Because I love caramel, I was planning on substituting the keeblers caramel cookies (as per other reviewers).  I'm glad I couldn't find them.  If you use the peppermint patties for the "burger", the taste is similar to thin mint cookies, but even better.  I used yellow and red tinted icing for "mustard" and "ketchup".  I forgot to get gum drops so I omitted the "pickle".  The fruit rollup "cheese" added a nice chewy texture to the mix.  Finally, I forgot sesame seeds so I used some chocolate sprinkles I had on hand...I used a touch of water/corn syrup mixture on top before putting on the sprinkles to make them stick better.  I guess I had poppy seed buns.  :)  Everybody at the Easter family get-together I took these to were thrilled and took pictures of them.  Thanks for this great idea!!

It was a great hit for kids and my neighbors:)  My husband thought they really were mini hamburgers when he saw them on a plate on kitchen counter...!  I followed some viewers' suggestions to use Keebler's Grasshopper cookies as hamburgers and red and yellow icing as ketchup and mustard, I forgot sesame seeds for bums, they still looked like hamburgers:)

Easy to make and a big hit. I did them for a curling club end-of-season potluck. I'll be making more for our bake sale next month. I didn't bother with the gumdrops or fruit leather. Instead I did as others did and used icing with red food colouring plus the green-tinted coconut. As others suggested, I used small dabs of honey to help make everything (including the seeds) stick.

They look great although I'm not a big fan of the taste. I used Keebler caramel cookies for the burgers and tropical "Fruit by the foot" for the cheese.

these cookies were very easy to assemble. the only problem i had was finding orange fruit rollups. i had to use orange starburst candies instead and roll them out with a rolling pin and then cut them into squares. i did not taste the cookies, but everybody else that did liked them! will definitely make again!

I first made these for a Margaritaville party. I made a few changes to this recipe, I used orange icing just around the outer edge for the cheese and a dab of icing in the center of the bottom and the top cookies to hold them together. I also brush the tops with watered down honey before sprinkling the sesame seeds. I got lots of compliments and people still talk about them.

I used a small amount of honey for the seeds on top and instead of sesame seeds I used a sugar sprinkle I found in the store that were sesame-like shaped and colored.

These cookies are super cute, and a lot of fun to assemble. I had trouble finding the apricot fruit leather, and had to scour my store for any orange-colored fruit leather type substance, finally finding some mixed fruit fruit roll-ups and cutting out the orange sections. I did not use the gumdrops because I figured that on a real burger you rarely see the pickles from the side. I did add red and yellow icing "ketchup and mustard" to help hold the cookie together. I only gave it 4 stars though, because I didn't think they tasted great. It's kind of a strange combination of flavors, but they are SO adorable, and honestly, my kids didn't care what they tasted like!
