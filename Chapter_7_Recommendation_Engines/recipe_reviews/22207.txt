Delicious, soft,not-too-sweet cookies. I have been searching for a recipe that replicates my grandmother's molasses cookies, and this is almost it. (Unfortunately Grandma never wrote anything down, and now she's gone!) 
 I rolled the dough (which was a little too sticky, I had to add lots of flour when I rolled it out) thicker, to a 1/2 inch or so, so the cookies are more cake-like. Obviously had to cook longer. I may try the others on this website to see if their recipes are an even closer match to Grandma's, but these were very good.

I followed the recipe exactly and the biscuits were VERY dissapointing. THey were insipid and din't taste of anything. I tried them golden brown [and they were slightly raw] and thoroughly cooked [& they were very crispy, brown and a bit more tasty] but neither had a molasses taste.
I don't recommend these!

These were excellent!  My husband has already asked me to make them again, except this time he wants a double batch!   I highly recommend this recipe.

I made these when my pantry was quite bare but I had some sour milk and shortening to use. One reviewer said the cookies were plain so I doubled the cinnamon and added ground ginger, ground cloves and allspice. Iâ€™d say they are still quite a plain cookie.
