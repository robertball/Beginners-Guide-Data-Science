Troy, WOW, this is a wonderful dish packed full of KAPOW flavor! First and foremost, I love the spam. I held a viewing party with both this dish and Jackie's while your show was on, and everyone loved your use of luncheon meat. It was nearly the topic of conversation. Also, GREAT recipe for kimchi friend rice, and love the twist of the pickled daikon and carrots. Pairing it with the perfectly cooked KBBQ sauce basted chicken is ingenious.  Awesome job, AWESOME show, and looking forward to more delicious recipes coming from you! You need to write a cookbook. :)

Made this as written except that there was no skin on my chicken boobs and I didn't know what garlic flakes were so I just used powder. This is really good but I highly recommend using low sodium products where you can and even at that this is not one for those watching their sodium intake.  It is not there in taste punching you in the face but it is there for certain. The only thing that would make this recipe better is an egg. Whether it be an over-easy over the top or a scrambled in the  rice, I think it needs egg. Other than that...perfect!

I frequently make kimchi fried for dinner, but hadn't ever thought of topping it with chicken. ..loved it! Next time I will add a fried egg!
