The amounts required are wrong!  I made the sauce as written and it was too dry.  It barely coated the green beans.  The sauce tasted great, but I would not make it as written again.  You should double the sauce recipe.

I love this sauce! I make this same sauce for my pork chops!!! The only thing I do different is instead of using nutmeg, I use garlic powder :)

So good!  I used a 12 oz package of frozen green beans that I cooked in the microwave.  I did the sauce on the stove and then added the beans to that.  I used half & half instead of the heavy cream.  This was so creamy and tasty.  Thanks!

Excellent! The sauce is amazing and would be great on lots of other veggies and maybe even meat. The nutmeg is a must! DON'T LEAVE IT OUT.

These were very good, and I will make this recipe again. I like to eat my veggies crisp-tender as the recipe states, but there isn't any "cooking" time for the beans more than you do in the water: cook them to the texture you'll enjoy. I made the sauce as-written and though the amount was good: coated but not swimming in the sauce. I was excited to go outside my spice comfort zone and use nutmeg and while my boyfriend loved it I think spicy is more my thing: will substitute for Cajun seasoning or garlic powder as another reviewer mentioned. A flexible side,  thanks for sharing.

OH MY GOD! These were the second best green beans I've ever had in my life! (My favorite recipe is sweet green bean bundles from this site but those are covered in sugar and wrapped in bacon so that's sorta cheating) I used a little less than a full pound of green beans so they were a bit saucier than they would have been making them exactly as stated. My husband and I both hate fresh green beans so I've been searching for a recipe that would make them appetizing for us. This is it! I did steam them rather than boiling and cooked them past "barely tender" to suit our tastes. I used 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and found it was the perfect amount. I also used Sargento's Artisan blend Parmesan but I don't know if that makes much difference. I recommend trying this even if you aren't crazy about nutmeg or fresh green beans. I will be making these for company and look forward to trying it on asparagus. Thank you for a great recipe!

Served this dish for Mother's Day family dinner with Slow Cooker Thanksgiving Turkey from this website.  As good as the turkey and gravy were, the green beans stole the show.  Used frozen haricots verts.  Followed another reviewer's advice and used half & half instead of cream.  Gave a generous shake of nutmeg.  Glad I did, it added a subtle dimension to the dish that put it over the top.

This was just okay.  I liked the cream and parmesan cheese, but did not like the pepper or nutmeg taste.  If I try this again, I will try it without the nutmeg and less pepper next time.

This is wonderful!  I have used it on cauliflower and broccoli and look forward to trying on other veggies which I usually steam first.  The only thing I did different was to add crumbled bacon.  Thanks for this one, Jodster!

This was good, but not exceptional.  To me it wasn't worth dirtying the extra pan when grating the parm on top would've been just as good.

I steamed a 1 lb package of fresh green beans.  Doubled the sauce and made as directed.  Before serving, sprinkled garlic salt on top and everyone kept going back for seconds.

Tried this side dish for dinner last night and my Dh and I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  The nutmeg gave it a nice twist.  I did double the sauce because I wanted to be sure to have enough sauce to stir the green beans into.  I also used frozen green beans because I did not have fresh, but I am looking forward to trying it with fresh green beans.

This was wonderful and my family loved it! Knowing that my family prefer a generousamout of any sauces and toppings, etc., I doubled the sauce portion of the rcipe. If your family is the same way, it is easy enough to do. Double the butter, cream, and first of the Parmesan cheese. If your family prefers just a subtle hint of topping, then follow the recipe as written. I prefer to steam green beans, so that's what I did. Basically just cook the beans how you like them, then make your sauce and add the beans. So very easy and delicous, too. We like cheese, but only used one tablespoon to sprinkle on before serving. If you have an ounce of common sense, you can make this to suit your taste buds. This was a wonderful addition to my dinner presentation. Thank you for this fine recipe. By the way, I was fairly generous with the nutmeg, but didn't even notice it. I guess it did blend in afterall.

I like my fresh green beans cooked with butter, onion, salt & pepper and some garlic! So I substituted frozen lime beans, they were delicious!!! I find lime beans dry and with this creamy sauce it made all the difference in the world. I added a small clove of minced garlic and I always use fresh nutmeg that I grated not to much b/c fresh nutmeg is a lot stronger just a couple of swipes on the grater, I actually enjoyed them. I gave the recipe 4 stars b/c I changed it, but it really is a 5…Will make this again with limas.

Good, but it's missing something. Garlic? I doubled the recipe and there were no leftovers so I guess it was a hit nonetheless. I did use last years crop of fresh green beans that I flash froze. I think this would much better had I had fresh green beans, as the recipe stated. I'll try it again once I have a little extra for fresh beans in my food budget.

Nice way to do green beans. Lots of flavor. I admit I used a substitute for the heavy cream, but no matter, the flavor was still all there. I opted out on the nutmeg, as the recipe doesn't specify how much, so I just didn't want to go there. I would steam my beans in just a little water next time, but that's the only change I would make to this recipe.

It's sooo delicious!     I roughly followed the recipe, i.e. I'm not sure if I used the exact proportions and left the nutmeg out (because I didn't have any), and also cooked the green beans in the microwave, but the end result was very very good!

I'm giving this four stars because I felt that the green beans were undercooked, however that may have been because I wanted to follow the recipe as far as cooking time and I boiled the bean "until just barely tender". Next time I will do longer. Also I felt the sauce was too parmeseany. Again, maybe my fault because I don't really measure things out. I do by feel. But overall, a nice change to normal dull green beans. Worth a try. I'll make again and change to taste.

Good recipe, I cooked the beans 10 minutes for our preference and doubled the sauce. I wish I would have even tripled it because I served this over rice for hubby and spinach noodles for myself. Made a nice meatless meal.

It is so good, I wanted it a bit more saucy, so I upped the proportions of cream, butter & cheese with no regrets.

I'm currently 6 months pregnant and that might make me a little fonder of food than usual, buuuut... this was absolutely delicious.  I may or may not have eaten the entire thing. And I may or may not have licked my plate clean. (I totally did)

It was good, but parmesan sticked to the non stick pan. I also added some garlic and it was tastier than the first time.

These were excellent and I loved the sauce.  The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 was that I had to double the sauce(like many suggested in the comments) or else there would have not been enough for a full lb of fresh green beans.  I did steam them instead of boiling and as far as the parm, I used reg. grated parm in the sauce and then fresh grated parm on top at the end.

I printed out this recipe at work so I could make these to go with dinner last night. I drove home only to realize I left the recipe on my desk. Had to try to remember the ingredients and it looks like all I forgot was the milk or cream. I steamed my haricot verts in the micro for 4 minutes, while I melted some butter in the pan. Tossed in some nutmeg and parmesan, enough to coat but certainly not enough to become a sauce. Stirred the beans into that buttery goodness, sprinkled with coarse ground black pepper and kosher salt and they were delicious!!! I was only sorry that my husband loved them as much as I did, because there were none left when I went back for seconds. LOL. So, if you want a lighter version, do what I did by mistake. Great recipe!

This is a nice change from the usual plain green beans. Added some nice richness and flavor. Thanks!
