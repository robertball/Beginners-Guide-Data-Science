This was tasty. Had a very strong veggie flavor which I liked. It is very thick so some extra stock might be needed. I did need more hot sauce..Do add the crab.I tried it with and without and it is really wonderful with the crab

Found this recipe after eating this soup at a Caribbean restaurant in Tulsa. This is great! I used chicken broth instead of water. Had to add extra seasonings to "kick up" the flavor. Will make it again.
