Shredded habanero cheese is great if you want some spice. I found that draining the liquid before adding the cheese is a must. Also not mixing the cheese but just letting it melt into the ingredients makes cleaning the bowl much easier.

It was amazingly good. I was skeptical because I don't do microwave dishes much but decided to follow the recipe because all the reviews were so good. I didn't change a thing and thought it was outstanding super easy and everyone loved it. Would definitely make it again and not make any changes.

Wow! Even my teenagers (who don't like squash) gobbled it up - and it was SO EASY! I made a couple of quick alterations:
- sprinkled with powdered chicken bullion for added flavor without adding fat
- a couple of pinches of garlic powder for added flavor

A great side dish choice for my husband's Father's Day dinner! Turned out great despite my not having mushrooms. My husband loved the fresh but not overdone taste as I did add a little salt & pepper but not too much as cheddar cheese is usually salty. A dish that will definitely be added as a regular dish in our home

I was a little skeptical about microwaving this dish but things came out pretty tasty. I would still prefer to make this in a skillet. I omitted the onion for taste and my picture was before the cheese actually melted. It did melt nicely though. Will make again when I'm in a time crunch.

Easy to make perfect flavors for a perfect side dish. The mushrooms add a depth of flavor.

Fresh tasting and fast. The combination of veg went well together and the celery added a nice crunch. I'll make this again.

Thank you so much for this recipe. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is simple quick and doesn't require heating the oven. (And no cans of soup or sleeves of crackers required!) Six minutes was perfect in my microwave. I left out the mushrooms since I don't keep them and didn't have any. Used a zucchini a yellow squash and an onion all from hubby's garden. Veggies and cheese. Yum! I may try adding some herbs or spices later.

This was a terrific easy side dish which my husband and kids enjoyed. I slightly changed it up i added a pinch of salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper and mixed it. I also drained the water after 6 minutes and then placed the cheddar cheese on top and microwaved it for 2 minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe it is a definitely a keeper.

Very surprised on how good this simple dish was. I made it exactly as written but added a bit of parmesan cheese on top. Very low calorie and healthy.

Wish I had seen the comment about draining before adding the cheese. Next time!
