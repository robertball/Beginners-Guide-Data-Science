I grew up eating and making Vanillekipferl and absolutely loved them. I used store bought Vanillea sugar (you can get them in German specialty stores). The dough is coarse, but that's how it is meant to be, so it takes a little bit of practice to roll out the long strands and then shape them. The final cookies are pretty fragile as well, but they melt in your mouths!!! the original German recipe (in metric, but if you have a scale, no problem) asks for 300 g flour, 250 g butter, 125 g sugar, 150 g almond flour (ideally the white one, Costco sells it) and the 3 egg yolks.

I took this recipe from the magazine.  Vanilla sugar was a pain to make, getting the little seeds out of vanilla beans.  The dough was rather tasteless, so I added a touch of almond extract, which made them better.  Cookies broke when making crescent shape - on the last roll I just sliced them, turned out ok.  And wait at least 5 minutes to cool on the pan - any earlier and the cookie breaks.  Won't make these again.
