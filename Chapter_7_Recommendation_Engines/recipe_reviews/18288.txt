Nice change from regular steamed green beans.  I cut back on the olive oil to one tsp as 3 tablespoons + butter seemed excessive. Threw in crumbled bacon and sauteed onion at the last minute.  Be sure to use a good parmesan as it will make all the difference in the taste of this dish!  Enjoy!

Gosh...I really hate to put a lower star review on this recipe, but my family and I really did not like this recipe...and we're all garlic lovers, too. I've tried this 3 times now just to make sure I was doing it right, but every time, it has bombed. I think it was really a matter of preferences when it comes to vegetables, too. My family generally likes their vegetables steamed, and with little seasoning. The green bean flavor with the garlic and parmesan just didn't work. My grandmother even said, "What's wrong with these beans? They taste funny."  I really tried to make this one work, especially given all the great reviews. Try it for yourself, though. I think this will probably appeal more to those who normally don't like beans, unlike my family...who grows about 5 different varieties in the backyard. :D

Easy to make and delicious to eat. I used fresh green beans that I steamed before adding to the sauteed garlic.

These vegetables were delicious!! I had been having a craving for green beans and this fit the bill perfectly.  I did use fresh green beans and I boiled them in salted water for 4 minutes first so they were crisp-tender then shocked them in cold water before sauteeing them.  I used less butter than suggested but they were still yummy!! Topped with asiago cheese!  A definite make again!

This was really GOOD!  I have had an abundance of beans this year from my garden and am tired of the GreenBean Casserole and just plain... this was really good.  I used fresh beans, 2 CLOVES (not heads) of garlic and it was really terrific.  I will make these again and SOON....
Nice change of pace.  Thanks

These were super yummy!  I loved it!!!  I reduced the olive oil as others suggested to 1 tablespoon and also only used 3 pieces of garlic instead of an entire head.  I also used fresh green beans and steamed them for 4 minutes and then added them to the pan to saute.

Mmmm....not one left and got raves from picky eaters. I used extra virgin olive oil (is there any other kind to cook with??) and reduced to 2 tbsp. I also used frozen beans but thawed them before placing them in the skillet with the oil.

good recipe but make sure that you brown the butter first. My daughter did taught me (the old dog)that trick. 3 T real butter, melt in skillet - let brown lightly, then add 2 tsp chopped garlic. Let cook 1 minute (no longer, it'll burn).Add 1T olive oil. Add green beans-salt&pepper them liberally, let cook over low heat till they are limp and slightly browning. Add cheese or don't-either way its good.

LOVED IT!  I used frozen green beans, & 1 Tbsp. oil, I also had to sub garlic powder (about a tsp.) to please my picky eaters, & they loved them!  I am attending a pig roast this weekend & I plan to make this the "adult" way (all the garlic) and also use fresh green beans.  Thanks Ericka!!!

Dependably delicious but average as is. I chose to use fresh green beans, and dressed them up with saut√©ed  chopped celery and red bell pepper.

I made this last night for my family and everyone though it was delicious. There were no left overs and I doubled the recipe. We had to add more garlic to make it right for us but other than that this is a great recipe.

These were pretty good.  I am not a very big green bean fan, so I wasn't sure if I would like.  These were actually very good.  One of my favorite veggie dishes.

Personally, I don't eat green beans, but I made these tonight because we were having company over. They were super easy to make, and everyone raved over them. I'm giving them 5 stars because of all of the compliments I received. I used the minced garlic in a jar, and just put approx. 2 1/2 tsp in instead of a clove of garlic.

This is a very easy way to make a tasty side dish!  Per other reviews, I reduced the oil to 1 tbsp.  I used 1 tbsp of pre-minced garlic, but I think slicing fresh garlic would have been more flavorful and attractive, plus I should have used a little more.  Be sure to add the cheese RIGHT before serving, otherwise the oil soaks into it and it doesn't look very appealing!

These were outstanding -- the only change I made was to use fresh green beans which I cooked for about 2-3 mintues before adding to the garlic.  I also followed others advice and sprinkled on the parmesan as I was serving  -- a definite keeper!

These were delicious!  I used 1lb fresh green beans and steamed for 4min and followed the recipe otherwise - oh with less oil, 1tbsp and did use the butter too - we'll have these again!

Absolutely Delicious!  Even my husband was nibbling on these right out of the pot.  I used fresh green beans and soaked them in salt water for 10 minutes.  I then boiled them in the salt water till they were crisp tender.  I mashed about 8 garlic cloves and sauteed them in the oil and butter for a few minutes and then added the beans.  They were soooo good.  I'll definitley keep this in my favorites list.  Thanks Ericka.

These were so good!  I used about a pound of fresh green beans, which I steamed in the microwave for about 3 minutes first.  I added the full tablespoon of butter, but cut the oil to one tablespoon, and approx. one teaspoon of minced garlic.  My husband raved about these beans!

I'm still trying to figure out where I went wrong with this one.  Seeing all the positive reviews for this one, I couldn't wait to make it.  Needless to say, my six-year old was the only one who raved these up (she had two helpings).  However, the rest of us were not that enthusiastic.  I even used fresh beans and less garlic but was still too bland/garlicly for this family.  Thanks anyways.

I substituted canned beans with fresh ones, and I pre-cooked them for 10 minutes in boiling water.  Also, before adding parmesan cheese, I added some bread crumbs and tossed the beans in the skillet until crumbs browned and stuck to the beans.

These were great!  I used fresh green beans instead of canned.  I HIGHLY suggest this to anyone trying this recipe.  Also, I cut way back on the oil and butter.  It seemed excessesive to me to use as much as the recipe called for.  In fact, next time I'll probably try using one or the other instead of both.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was good - a nice change from plain green beans. The garlic is not exactly
"caramelized" (but maybe adding a spoonful of sugar in the beginning to caramelize the garlic would not be such a bad idea?)

Delicious!  I steamed fresh green beans until tender instead of canned green beans.  I also used only 1 teaspoon of olive oil and no butter to cut back on calories and fat.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  Probably would be better with fresh green beans, as I used canned.  I reduced the oil to 1 Tbsp.  Can't imagine why you would need 3 Tbsp!!

I made this recipe on the spur of the moment and it turned out fantastic.  My husband told me that I would be making these again.  We loved them and they were flavourful yet easy to put together.  Thank you for the recipe.

These were great!!! I used frozen green beans instead, since they are fresher to me.  I just cooked those first then continued on with the recipe.  I also added more cheese.  Yummy!

I used less olive oil for this and also used frozen green beans since I don't care for the texture of the canned version.  I love garlic but was hesitant to use the whole head so I cut it back to three cloves.  Used fresh grated parm which is just so much more flavourful then the stuff you shake out of a can.

This is a great recipe, with one big exception..canned green beans? I've made this for years with a few changes. I steam fresh green bean until they are cooked. Then in a separate fry pan I cook lots of sliced garlic until it is a deep rich carmel color and crispy. You can also throw in sliced almonds. Toss the green beans with your garlic/olive oil mixture...some salt an pepper and yum..it's delicious! Frozen string beans also work for this...but fresh is best.

This was good, but I'm really giving it 5 starts because my three sons not only ate their beans tonight - they devoured them! Even my two-year-old ate them without complaint! I don't think that's ever happened before! One change was that I used frozen organic beans instead of canned.

I can't believe I haven't done this before. I usually just open the can & heat them up. We LOVED this! I left out the butter because my other 2 dishes had it in there. This was fantastic, thanks!

I made this with fresh green beans, blanched.  I ended up rinsing them off with hot water after tasting them and did my own tried and true, butter, a tablespoon of white wine, garlic salt, cayenne, and slivered almonds.  This was just not for us.

Very good!  I also recommend using fresh green beans...they taste sooo much better than canned.  I only used about 1 Tbs. olive oil and in addition to salt and pepper, I added a little onion powder.  The result was very tasty.  My three year old even said "Heeeey, why do you get more green beans than me?"

This is delicious, easy and quick - but I agree with other viewers that it would probably be great if Fresh beans were used - I would use a little less Parmeasan cheese - I suggest tasting it using less cheese and adding more to suit your taste.

When I say fussy, I mean extremely fussy and that's what my boyfriend is when it comes to any veggies.  Somehow, I managed to tantalize his tastebuds with this recipe.  All the beans were gobbled up and when he asked for a second helping (to everyone's amazement) he was disappointed, because there wasn't a drop left!  Thanks, what a wonderful receipe to share with the world!

I don't really like green beans, but this recipe seems to help remove some of the bitterness that I perceive green beans to have.  From now on, if I have green beans, it will be prepared like this. My kids don't care for them too much, but that is just a vegetable/kid thing.

I made these for dinner and my fiance loved them!  I however think I would like more garlic (I tend to love 2xs the amount of garlic that he does) My 8 yo son helped to prepare these (we do not eat canned veggies ever, so we got fresh and he ripped the tips) which was nice for me and then he tends to like the food more when he helps, so he loved them!  (he is big on veggies though so I didn't expect anything less)  I think the only thing I may do different next time is a little more garlic.  I did steam my green beans first and then shocked them in cold water and blotted dry.  I didn't want them totally fried.  Because I was frying them mainly for flavor, I did leave out some of the olive oil (about 1.5 Tbsp).  I added the parmesan cheese and I didn't quite get it?  I didn't go out and buy it, I happened to have some at home.  Parmesan cheese doesnt melt well, so it was kinda hard on top of veggies.  weird.  But the rest was great. I was looking at a way to spice up green beans and this was it! Thank you!

This is an easy and outstanding recipe. I was looking for a recipe that didn't have soup, sour cream or cream cheese in it. I did cut down on the amount of butter and olive oil used as suggested by others, and I used fresh green beans, since that's what we prefer. In the afternoon, I steamed the beans for about four minutes to set the color, and then followed the recipes directions for assembly. Then I set it all aside, keeping it all in the sauce pan. At dinner, I simply reheated and finished cooking the beans, cutting down on fiddling around at the last minute. It was a wonderful addition to a beef tenderloin dinner.

I used frozen green beans and steamed them before sauteing them. These were wonderful. After making new recipes my boyfriend and I evaluate to decide what changes we would make if we made it again and we both decided these were perfect as is.

I hope you LOVE garlic. This is just far too strong of a garlic taste for me. Just cooking it made me sick. I put in half the amount of garlic and double the cheese and it is much more suitable for me. I should clarify that I do like garlic very much.

I used 1 Tbs butter, 1 Tbs olive oil, 4 cloves garlic, and 1 medium onion. I sauteed that in skillet until brown. Meanwhile I steamed fresh green beans in the microwave for about 5 min. Then added beans to skillet and cooked another couple min. Topped with the parmesan cheese and it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Not a huge fan of green beans, so if I was to cook them again I would definitely try this again. Though I don't buy canned vegetables so I used frozen not sure how much of a difference that makes :)

Every green vegetable in our house is sauteed in olive oil and garlic, lots of garlic. Fresh green beans are so much more tasty when cooked this way. I say you can't go wrong with olive oil and garlic.

This was a perfect side dish to go with some left over pork loin I had cooked on the rotisserie. I substituted the 3 tbs of olive oil for 1 tb of bacon fat and one extra tb of butter, about 2 lbs of fresh green beans cut to size and dropped in boiling salted water for 2 mins before draining and adding to the skillet. I quickly stirred the beans in with the rest of the ingredients in the skillet, removed from heat topped with Parmesan and served. They were wonderful and there weren't any left overs.

AWESOME!  I used 1 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp Butter, 2 garlic cloves, and 12 oz fresh green beans.  I threw everything in together on med-high head and covered with lid.  Stir occasionally and cook until tender (10 minutes).  Sprinkled with 1/2 cup parm and it was great.  My hubby finished them off.  Next time I'll make a double batch.

I used frozen beans and made this the day before Thanksgiving. It reheated well (I tried to cook the beans on the more crispy side knowing that I was going to reheat them) I followed other peoples suggestions and didn't use nearly as much olive oil (1 teaspoon?), and only 2-3 cloves of garlic. It turned out nice and was a great complement to dinner :)

Giving this 4 stars instead of 5, only because of the use of canned beans.  I was not happy with the texture.  Next time I will use fresh and parboil them.  The flavor of this would be awesome with the slightly al dente crunch of fresh beans.  I will also use a little less garlic next time.  4 or 5 cloves is plenty!  I love how easy this was though!

This was a nice change to plain steamed Green Beans. I followed the recipe but used freah steamed Green beans and only 2 tbs of Olive oil. I also added 1 cup of fresh cut mushrooms. I used only crushed garlic. The next time I will reduce oil to 1 tbs because it still seemed a bit oily for our taste. The mushrooms turned out really well and made this a very nice side dish to the chicken and rice I served. I forgot to add the parmesan but it still turned out great. My husband was disapointed he didn't 2nd's and 3rd's. I promised to make it again this week. :)

The only reason I'm giving this 4 out of 5 is because there was a little too much grease for me, especially using canned. I cook A LOT, homemade everything daily. The flavor combination is fantastic, but just cut down on the butter and olive oil if you're using canned. If using fresh green beans, I would suggest not pre-cooking them but saute them in the olive oil/butter (or just use the olive oil for a healthier treat) for a bit before adding the garlic (so it doesn't burn). Pay close attention to where the recipe says a HEAD of garlic, not a CLOVE. It calls for a fair amount of garlic. I like a lot, so I just eyed it knowing my own tastes. Also keep in mind that a dash of salt before serving it really accentuates the flavors. Either way, this is a really easy and great recipe!

These green beans were so flavorful! I made one major change: I steamed fresh (instead of canned) green beans for 7 minutes before adding them to cook with the sauteed garlic. Thank you, Ericka! I've added this on as a family favorite; my partner and I loved them!

Wow!  These were wonderful!  I did use blanched fresh green beans, and sauteed them longer than 10 minutes on low heat.  They turned out beautifully.  Served them as a side dish yesterday (Easter), and everybody commented on how delicious they were.  A welcome change to serving fresh green beans.

We absolutely loved these!  I used fresh green beans, cooked them first then sauted them in the olive oil/butter mixture for about 8-10 min.  Wonderful recipe!  I usualy make the Green bean and mushrooms melody, also from this site.  I'll switch off between the two.  Thanks Ericka!

New computer hasn't arrived yet, so I must type fast. (I'll talk when I can gals) We really liked this dish a lot. Yes, fresh and par cooked, or frozen is the way to go here. I cut waaaaaay back on the oil and butter and I also roasted a whole head of garlic in the oven before I sauteed. Hubby and one daughter were on their own tonight and they loved this side with their "Ostrich steak". If anyone's interested, Mr. Drew and Ash said it was fantastic and tasted just like beef. Very pricey though!

This recipe was pretty good :).  I would use fresh green beans and leave out the butter next time.  I ALWAYS cook with garlic and olive oil so this recipe wasn't too exciting to me.  Everyone should try it though.

WONDERFUL! I used 2 lbs. of steamed, fresh green beans with 4 large cloves of garlic since I didn't know if it really meant a head of garlic or a clove. I added about 1/4 cup of dried, minced onions after adding the green beans. I forgot the parmesan, but might try it next time. Maybe not...these were perfect.
I served these for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them.

This is pretty good if you use fresh beans, some bacon and a small finely diced garlic instead of medium. I don't know why so many recipes use canned stuff. If I'm cooking I want fresh. If I wanted canned I'd just eat canned.

These were really delicious. I only used 1 Tbs butter and about 1 Tbs olive oil. Next time I won't cook the garlic as long before putting in the green beans, the garlic got a little too brown. The melty Parmesan sent it over the top!

I've been making this recipe for around 5 years...and it is loved by everyone.  I usually use fresh garlic in garlic recipes, but for this dish I just use the already minced garlic you can buy in a bottle...about two heaping teaspoons...instead of mincing an entire head of garlic by hand.  It will save a LOT of time and I cannot taste the difference (I've tried it both ways).  In addition, use the "shredded" parmesan instead of the grated, and if you can get a good quality parm...it will make a world of difference.  This recipe is a staple in my kitchen, btw.  ;-)

Very Delicious. I did 3 tbsp butter, no olive oil, and fresh parmesian cheese. If you're concerned about fat from butter, do the research on good and bad fats and have your Vitamin D levels checked. :) Olive oil cooked is not good for you as it is raw, but butter is safe to cook. Will do this again anytime we have canned green beans!

I had fresh green beans, so I steamed them for about 3 minutes, then sauteed them in olive oil and garlic powder, since I was short on time and did not want to peel and slice fresh garlic. Added parmesan cheese and salt and pepper and it was delicious!

I think this is just me, but it's as good as canned green beans can get (in my opinion, you just can't spruce up canned green beans).  The hubby thought it was great.  Used this to get rid of a can I bought by mistake.

Very good.  I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit with the 4 different families that attended.  I wanted to make something fancier than the traditional steamed beans I would have made if it had just been a small group coming.  I will continue to make these in the future.

They were ok. The garlic/parm totally fell off so we just had to spoon the sauteed garlic onto our plates and take a little forkfull with out green beans. If the topping were to stick better it would be 5.

Delicious!  I used fresh blue lake green beans boiled in salted water for about 4 minutes then ice water bathed.  I used about 1 T olive oil and butter each , about 2 tsp chopped garlic and skipped the cheese.  Wonderful for Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks.

I completely forgot to add the parmesan at the end, but these turned out delicious! I used frozen beans instead of canned, and cooked them till the water evaporated (I didn't thaw them out). Then I topped with fried chopped salami that I had leftover in the fridge. This was a very savory dish. Will definitely make again.

I used fresh green beans and cut the ends off.  Then after putting them in the garlic butter I covered the pan and turned the heat down to help steam cook them.  Ended with some Parmesan.  Yummy!

idk if i did something or what but when i made these, they weren't that good. next time (i will try again) i'm not gonna use both the butter & olive oil as for us, that was just too much. there wasn't as much of a garlic taste as i would expect. but i will try again.

A HEAD of garlic is a whole garlic, not a clove. I think the people that claimed to need "more" garlic may have misread the directions. There are like 10-15 cloves of garlic in a head.

I really liked this recipe. As others, I only used 1 Tbsp oil. I may use less Parm next time just to get more veg flavor, but it was tasty. I added the parm while hot, and it really coated the grean beans well.

extra butter and extra cheese makes these so delicious. I probably need to go running tomorrow since I couldn't taste the green beans anymore, just cheese. So good.

I used fresh green beans that were washed and trimmed, and I used a minced clove of garlic (what the hell is a head of garlic?). I didn't add it until the final three minutes of sautee since I didn't want it to burn too much.

Delicious! I prefer fresh green beans to canned so I steamed mine for a few minutes before continuing on with the recipe. I did use a little less olive also. Thank you for the great and simple recipe.

I liked this... i think. The first review listed left some honest negative feedback so I was skeptical, but it turned out well. I was worried about the garlic getting bitter, but it wa fine. I have to note that I used fresh green beans & added a little bit of sliced carrot (wanted to use up). I also forgot the parmesan, but it was still good and the young kiddos liked it too.

These were pretty good but I modified the recipe.  I LOVE garlic but cut the amount by at least half and they had plenty of garlic.  I also used half the amount of the oils/butter and they were still pretty greasy.  The cheese kind of clumped up a minute after I sprinkled it and looked unattractive.  I won't make these again.

Well I was all set to give this recipe a 3 (1 from me, 5 from husband) but I just re-read it and see that the fault is mine. I used FRESH green beans, not canned ones, so 10 minutes of cooking time was not sufficient for me (but my husband loves his veggies on the raw side of done so it was great for him). I'm giving this a 5 based on the flavor combo of the caramelized garlic, butter, and the Parmesan. If I hadn't used the wrong type of beans I think I'd have loved this, and my husband loved it anyway. I might add a little dehydrated onion next time, so that it caramelizes with the garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

I used frozen green beans. I made no other changes. GREAT side for Thanksgiving dinner. Next time, I'll use fresh green beans and saute them with the garlic in the butter and olive oil.

I adapted the recipe a bit and it was great.  First, I strained the canned beans and let them sit for a few minutes to dry a little (I think this may help prevent sogginess).  I used less butter and a bit less oil.  When I sauteed the onion and garlic I added chopped pieces of turkey bacon.  After adding beans I tossed it all together and turned heat to med-low and let it cook for about 5 minutes.  I spread parm cheese over the top and then stuck it in the oven under the broiler (watch very closely!) until the cheese just began to turn a light brown.  This dish turned out really great!

Great for a change on the traditional green beans.  Sometimes the garlic can be a bit strong, but overall quite yummy.

I used fresh green beans instead of canned, and minced garlic instead of sliced.  It was still pretty bland. I even added extra garlic. The cook time was pretty spot on--just taste test a few times through--you don't want mushy :)   Overall, pretty good.   Although, to shave calories and save nutrients I normally partially steam green beans, then do a quick few minute saute in garlic and olive oil with a pat of butter. Yum :)

This was an excellent variation to a staple in our home, green beans! It added so much flavor. I didn't have canned green beans, so I used fresh and steamed them until crisp but tender before adding them to the sauted butter, olive oil, and garlic. I only used 3 cloves instead of an entire head. Next time I might add more, but it was yummy! Even my pickiest eater liked it.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I did do as recommended by others and boil the green beans for 4 minutes then give them an ice water bath while the garlic was browning. I used 3 garlic cloves and only 1.5 tablespoons of oil.  I did toss them in lemon juice and Parmesan cheese before serving. Excellent!

This is really good and easy. It makes canned green beans taste great! I used 1 Tbls of minced garlic from the jar for 2 cans of beans and cut the oil down to one Tbsp, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, I will be fixing it often. UPDATE: Follow the directions and slice the garlic...oh my, what a wonderful difference!!!! Sliced garlic is so much better!!! YUMMY!!!!

This is one of our favorite side dishes and a holiday staple and it's SO easy.  I'm a huge garlic fan but I only use about 5-6 cloves depending on size and I mince it.  Canned green beans taste fine but a lot of the time I use Trader Joe's frozen french cut green beans, just micro covered for 5 minutes and then dump in the pan.  You must try these, you're missing out!

I used 1 lb. of fresh green beans (boiled them for about 5-10 minutes before sautee) instead of canned ones. Also only used 2 tbsp. of olive oil. Didn't have any parmesan, but i don't think it needed it! Hubby doesn't like green beans, but he REALLY liked these!

Delicious!!!!! I used fresh green beans and added a shake of salt to the water cooked until they were crispy tender. I added Swiss cheese instead of the parmesan my husband loved this recipe....it certainly is a keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe but didn't follow it exactly. I used 1 lb of fresh green beans - boiled for about 5 minutes. I also used about a Tbs of minced garlic (maybe 2-3 cloves) and I used the Kraft parmesean cheese instead of the fresh grated - didn't measure just poured it on to taste. However, I added some fresh lemon juice which I thought really brought out the flavor and I liked a lot better than without - for me it made a big difference.

5 stars for awesome flavor!  Next time I will use less olive oil.  Note:  watch garlic do not overcook and only cook the canned green beans until hot.

I used fresh green beans (1 pound) and steamed them for 4-5 minutes prior to sauteing. Worked out great, they were delicious. Next time I'll use 1 less tbsp of oil.

Very strong flavors that mixed very well. I used 3/4 a head of garlic and one can of green beans. I used 2 tablespoons of butter and some garlic infused cooking spray which  has some extra olive oil in it. I meant to cut the parmesan in half and thought the recipe called for half a cup oops, still tasted great. Yes the beans weren't firm and a little mushy, I tend to be a texture freak, but the flavor was awesome and what do you expect from canned beans? Next time I'm going to try with fresh beans, up the garlic.

a stape recipe in our house, except we make it with olive oil instead of butter.  It's so tasty with a little salt and pepper with the fresh garlic that you can skip the cheese altogether.  So good they are addicting. Also great for asparagus and brussel sprouts that are halfed, cooking them mostly on the cut side to the pan.  Also, the more garlic the better.

I used the fresh green beans that come in the package in the produce section.  Poked a few holes in the bag and microwaved for 2 minutes to soften just a bit before cooking them in the butter/oil.  They were REALLY good.  I will cut the oil down to 1 tbsp. next time.

Amazing recipe! I, like other reviewers, used fresh or frozen green beans (cooked them first and then added to the oil/butter mixture). And, instead of parmesan cheese I used fresh-grated Asiago cheese. Delicious!

This is pretty good, definately an improvement over plain canned green beans.  I had all the ingredients on hand so decided to try it, but next time I think I will use fresh green beans and a little less olive oil and butter.  Be really careful with the garlic, and cook it slow.  Nothing tastes worse than burnt garlic.

very good side dish, i added sliced fresh mushrooms & used fresh (the only way to go w/ veggies) beans.  the mushrooms give off quite a bit of water, but dont worry, it will be absorbed by the beans.

This was not one of those dishes that made me melt, but it was a very good way to dress up green beans. Made them very flavorful and less boring. The first time I made them, they seemed a bit mushy (since the canned ones are already cooked) so the second time I just added the beans to the garlic, etc. in the pan and tossed them, let them sit for a minute or two to get warm, and served. I will make it again. Love the combination of the beans with the Parmesn.

I needed a green recipe for St Patty's Day and wanted something a little different.  I tripled the recipe and went easy on the butter/oil and it was a great hit.  I'm making it all the time.  Very easy and user friendly to make.  Thanks again for sharing the twist to green beans.

I think overall this is a good recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and steamed the green beans first.  Mine came out a little oily, so I would cut back on the butter or olive oil a little.  Otherwise, very good!

I made this recipe with fresh green beans and added a little sea salt.  The garlic cooked too quickly though, and got browner than I would have liked.  Perhaps next time I will add the garlic and the beans at the same time.

This was a good recipe, authentic Italian, except for the canned part. I prepared it just as instructed, but I eyeballed the garlic, starting with 2 big cloves, I didn't end up using the whole head, tho. It was a great, simple accompaniment to the Herbed Pork and Apples and Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes. Fresh green beans would work well if making for company, otherwise the canned were just fine!

This was very very good, the first time I ever got my son to eat green beans.  With the oil, butter and cheese it's a bit fattening to use as an every day recipe but it will be great for special meals.  It went wonderful with stuffed salmon and rice pilaf.  I used freshly grated parmesan, it was perfect.  I passed this recipe on to a coworker the day after I made it, can't wait to see what she thought!  The only time consuming part is peeling and slicing the garlic but, what can you do, garlic is wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are definitely tasty.  Use fresh green beans to achieve full flavor.  I followed a previous review by sprinkling crumbled bacon on top and omitting the cheese.  3 cloves of garlic is sufficient.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I took the idea from the rewiews and cooked up some bacon and used the drippings instead of the oil, and crumbled the bacon rest on top, it was great. I have never seen my family go so gaga for green beans. I also made it once with green beans and corn, and it was just as good. One note, this recipe is definately for garlic lovers, which my household is. Actually I used extra garlic. The pre minced garlic in a jar is a wonderful thing.

This dish was excellent.  I used fresh green beans instead of canned. I also fried a couple of slices of bacon to crumble on top.  I used some of the bacon drippings for flavoring and 3 large cloves of garlic. I was afraid the garlic would be too much.  I drained the beans before I tossed them with the garlic.  These were the best tasting green beans I've ever had!

WE LOVED THIS RECIPE. WE HAVE A LOT OF FRESH GREEN BEENS RIGHT NOW, SO I MAKE THEM OFTEN. I ONLY USE 5 CLOVES OF GARLIC, NO CHEESE AND CUT WAY BACK ON THE OIL AND BUTTER AND WAS STILL GREAT! THANKS FOR SHARING ERICKA.

I made these tonight and they tasted exactly like this little Cafe we go to.  Only difference was when they fry theirs they add fried jalepenos to the batter and fry them with the chicken (gives the chicken a good extra little spice) so the husband requested I do that next time.  I did add some regular panko bread crumbs as some others had and really think that helped with the breading and had season to taste.  Good easy recipe will stick with it and play around with it.  Thanks for recipe!

So good like this! I cut each garlic clove into thin strips so they browned a little faster in the butter and olive oil, which added a crunch to the every bite with the green beans. I have made with frozen green beans and fresh, to the same delicious results, though it takes a little longer to cook this way, and I usually add a little water to cover the bottom of the pan when adding the beans and let them steam with the flavors.

The green beans were good, although I would use a little less olive oil and more garlic. The cheese on top of the green beans is a nice touch.

This was a fantastic recipe; the olive oil made the dish. Although, I think next time I'll subtract 1/2 Tsp olive oil and cook for 9 minutes instead of 10.

It was just kind of bland. Nothing really special about these green beans.

I used French style green beans. They mixed a lot easier. I also cut back a bit on the parm. It's not as overwhelming as you would think. I love this recipe and have made it serval times because it's always requested with dinner

Good and simple. I'm used to steaming my green beans, and I prefer the texture of steamed (these come out more al dente), but I like the flavor.

I used fresh green beans instead of canned green beans and it unfortunately was way too oily for me. Next time I would definitely cut down on the olive oil and butter! It needed quite a bit of salt using the fresh beans and the fresh beans took longer to cook - which I anticipated - but that is something to take note of if you are using fresh beans. If you use fresh beans you may need to either steam/lightly boil them first to cook them a little or you could add a little water to the pan and cover and steam that way after sauteing them which is what I did and it worked. 
I think this dish would be great with a little pancetta or some fresh lemon/zest. 
I did leave off the parmesan cheese since it turned out so oily but if I cut down the oil then I think the cheese would be excellent - fresh grated only!
The recipe definitely has potential but just didn't work out for me this time. I'll definitely give it another go though.

awesome!  heated butter and oil in pan, added a T of garlic, then added some frozen green beans (long) and generously seasoned with pepper and salt.  sauted for a while (until thawed and cooked well), then simmered while everything else got ready.  These were awesome!!

It looks like I made this 2 times now without realizing it. In my first review I made 1/2 recipe and followed it and said it made a nicely flavored oil that went well with rice. On my second attempt I made the full recipe but cut the parm, oil, and butter in half to make it healthier. I also used green beans with sea salt and lower sodium. I thought the green beans still tasted like they came from a can and the parmesan cheese became really sticky. It doesn't appear it is a recipe that can be lightened up. Overall, I think I will stick with the fresh green beans when making garlic or roasted green beans. ty

Tried it tonight! It was perfect, the flavor wasn't so overpowering that the flavor of the green beans still stood out, while be accented by the garlic and cheese. I will DEF make this again. The key is DON'T OVERCOOK! I made canned beans, only cooked until hot, nowhere near 10 minutes. Delish!

The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is the use of canned green beans.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and wasn't impressed with the texture of the beans but the flavor was wonderful.  Each time I've made this since then (and I've made these A LOT!), I've used a one pound bag of whole, petite green beans which makes this a five star recipe for my family's preferences.  Thanks for such a great flavor combination.

This was just ok to me.  Of all of the ingredients, I like green beans the least, but it was what I liked most in this recipe.  The caramelized garlic and cheese taste wasn't really there for me (and yes, I do know what a head of garlic is).  I used frozen beans instead of canned as some others had done.  It was the only change I made.  My husband had no comments on it and he likes green beans and loves anything with cheese on it.  Won't bother to make this again.

I made this for our Easter dinner here in Uganda for all our missionaries. I used fresh green beans that I pre-cooked and made no other changes to the recipe. It was amazing!!! Everyone loved them. I will be making this many more times in the future.

I love green beans, so I was excited to try something different than just plain green beans.  I thought this recipe was very good.  I enjoyed the garlic flavor and the delicious Parmesan cheese topping.  You can't go wrong with Parmesan cheese.

This dish makes a wonderful side or even a great snack for a vege lover like myself.  I did use fresh green beans which i steamed just a little before putting them in with the other ingredients.  They were perfectly cooked with a bit of a crunch to them.  The memeber of my family who refuses to touch his veges ate these with no problem and asked for more.  This will become a frequent side for my family's dinners.

I use frozen green beans and they are delicious! I saute the garlic with margarine on medium-low heat for a minute or two so the chopped garlic is infused with the margarine. then I add the "frozen" green beans and partially cover with a lid. I periodically stir until tender and remove the lid and let cook for an additional few minutes to let the water evaporate a little.  If you thaw the green beans first then you don't need to cover while cooking.    I add my salt and pepper right before taking it off the pan.  The salt seems to bring the temperature up so it burns more easily. After I put the green beans on the plate, I then sprinkle Parmesan cheese.  I just use the powdered stuff in the canister.

This is a good side dish. I used 3 cans of green beans instead of two and they were still a little too oily for my personal taste.  But everyone else at the party loved them. I used 1 tsp minced fresh garlic and about 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese. Served with Baked Spaghetti and Herbed bread.  Very good. Thanks for the idea.

I made these last night for friends over for New Year's Eve dinner.  I only used two cloves of garlic and cut back a bit on the oil.  We loved them.  We all agreed that this recipe is a keeper.

4.5 stars, only because my husband thought they had too much garlic.  I used bottled minced garlic and, per container instructions of subbing 1/2 teaspoon per one clove, estimated 2.5 teaspoons for one head garlic.  I thought it was fantastic, but will reduce the garlic next time.  The fresh parmesan was a great addition.

This is a wonderful side dish that can compliment many meals. I used frozen french green beans and steamed them before adding them to the pan. I also used a blend of grated and shredded Parmesan. I will definitely be making this again!

REALLY GREASY! I would use maybe half of the oils listed. I made this with fresh green beans, pre-steamed, and it was just ridiculously greasy. On the flip side, my carnivore husband said that even though they weren't good, they were tolerable. I don't know that the amount of fat he took in with them really makes up for the good of the vegetable serving.

I was not happy with the results.  Maybe I will substitute fresh green beans for the canned green beans next time and use a little less olive oil.

These were pretty good. I used fresh steamed beans instead of canned and also used less oil. Next time I'm going to add some pine nuts like another reviewer suggested. They would go great in this dish.

Delish!  Used 28 oz fresh green beans steamed for a few minutes first.  Used 1Tbsp butter, only 1Tbsp olive oil, and all the garlic called for.  Great mix of flavors.

I omitted the olive oil and used 2 1/2 tablespoons butter. I then added salt and pepper. Simple, yet very tasty. I then added 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and it was still good, but changed the taste. Either way, 1 tablespoon cheese was plenty.

I just made these for a euchre party on 1-16-10 and it was exceptionally good! EVERYONE loved it and raved about it. The host even asked if she could keep some there to have the next day! Very good recipe and VERY easy and quick! I used frozen thin green beans, and was going to use fresh parmesan however it was $7.00 for a wedge at Krogers and I didn't want to pay that much. I also doubled the recipe. I will start making these for holiday get-to-gethers.

These were quite good. Saute'd the garlic in 1Tbsp butter with 1 Tbsp olive oil which was enough.  I used elephant garlic so 1 large clove worked great. Used the Parmesan cheese in a jar so don't know how much difference this made. Also used home canned green beans so the ounces may have been slightly different but with these slight changes it worked well for me.

I rate this recipe as to some-what the same of our famous Green Bean Casserole. It was DE-licious and I could not stop devouring it. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS RECIPE WITH CARE and you will get tender, garlicy green bean goodness. Use a whole head a garlic and mince them in the oil, babysitting them for the ten minutes of cooking. That is the key ingredient of great garlicy green beans. Cook until dark golden brown.

This was great--a good way to spice up regular green beans.  I used freshed green beans, and boiled them for 5 minutes prior to sauteing them in the dish.  I also lightened up a bit on the garlic.

Very delicious. I wasn't exactly sure what to think of the texture because it seemed kind of greasy but at the same time it wasn't a nasty kind of greasy. These green beans were full of flavor and it's how I will cook my beans from now on. I also added some chopped onion with the butter, oil and garlic.

Fantastic recipe!  A great change from just plain green beans.  I only made a few changes.  I used a bag of frozen green beans and steamed them for about 5 minutes.  The only other change I made was that I used only 1 tablespoon of oil.  Three tablespoons would be way too much... for me anyways...but this was a GREAT recipe.  I will definately be making this more often.

Delicious with canned green beans as written, as well as with fresh broccoli or asparagus.  I forgot the butter once, and  it's not nearly as good (just a little does wonders).

These are good, but this recipe is overly complicated for one that starts with canned beans. They're already tender, so don't wait too long. And when cooking garlic, the difference between browned and bitter is about a hair's breath. That may explain the odd flavors some folks experience. Go for translucent, drain and add the beans, heat through, sprinkle with cheese. 1-2-3!

I am shocked that I was so excited to eat these green beans. Guess it's cause I'm sually excited about a main dish or the dessert but the side dish? But I LOVED these green beans and can not wait to make these again. This time, I'm doubling the recipe or something so I can have left overs.   I really loved the garlic and the parmesan cheese gave it a very distinct flavor.   I made this exact to the recipe and will not change a thing next time, either.

We loved this. I used fresh green beans, but it's nice to know that canned will be good when I haven't been to the store and we have to raid the pantry. Served them with Garlic Chicken, from this site

Pretty yummy, and super garlicky! I multipled this recipe by 4 to make enough for TWENTY (20) servings for Christmas dinner. I used 2 kg of frozen French green beans, and about 4 whole heads of garlic (I chopped 5, but about 4 was definitely enough, and my family is no stranger to garlic!). I also cut down on the olive oil, and used only 1/2 a cup instead of 3/4. Really simple, really easy, really delicious. I'll definitely make it again for myself (in much smaller portions!) Thanks!

Like others I used fresh beans and followed Daniel den Hoed's review steps for boiling.

eh.  It just tasted like green beans with a lot of garlic.  Not all that mind blowing.  Next time, I think I'll just experiment on my own.

Was great. I sliced up the garlic like it said, but I also added two giant spoonfulls of minced garlic during the last minute of cooking.  I love garlic so I absolutely loved it.  I had it for lunch, will use parmesan next time, I am out at the moment.

We used fresh green beans and used rosemary along with the salt and pepper. The garlic was awesome but didnt seem to have enough infused with the oil and butter mixture. Maybe next time do have crushed garlic and finely chopped to add more of the flavor. Overall it was really tasty.

My DD is allergic to dairy so I had to leave out the cheese but the recipe is great.  I would have never used so much garlic or oils if creating this on my own but the proportions were good.

Great recipe, we were looking for a new side dish! I wanted to use fresh beans but all I had was canned, it still tasted great. I also didn't have any parmesan cheese so I will have to try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

So simple, yet soooo tasty! I use frozen green beans instead of the canned ones (they're healthier). It's a great accompaniment to roasted or fried chicken...not so much with fish. Or they make a great meal themselves if frozen or canned green beans is all you have laying around.

I thought these were very good.  I cut the oil down to 1 tablespoon, and cut the garlic in half. Plus used fresh green beans, that I boiled in salt water for 4 minutes before added to the pan.

I used fresh organic beans and cooked accordingly. I highly recommend using fresh veggies since they seem to retain their crisp texture better than frozen or canned. The cheese was a nice touch to a very healthy, tasty side dish!

Fantastic recipe, if you use fresh green beans. I doubled the amount of green beans (2 lbs) but used the same amount of butter/oil and garlic. I also added a small bag of slivered almonds in with the garlic. This went over huge at our family dinner!

This recipe is awesome with 1 lb of fresh beans, or a 1 lb bag of frozen (thawed before cooking), instead of the canned.  I keep the butter but cut the oil to 1 T., and mix the cheese in while still in the pan so it melts a bit.  Don‚Äôt forget the salt and pepper (as I did once), and notice it says ‚Äúhead‚Äù of garlic, not just a clove.  If my head of garlic is small I use 2.  This one is a staple in my house, and I always make this recipe instead of green bean casserole during the holidays.  Even when it‚Äôs just my husband and I, there are never left-overs.

I will only cook green bean this way from now on.  My family loves it.  I only modified it a tad.  I add almond slivers with the garlic.  Then during the cooking process, I add a dash of soy sauce instead of salt just for a little added flavor.

This was so delicious and definitely better than the plain ole green beans we usually make.  The kids ate these up fast.  Next time I will use fresh green beans just for preference.  However these were still great using the canned stuff.

Edited to add: I used this recipe with fresh green beans this time around and they were a big hit!  Definitely go with fresh it beats the canned stuff anyday!!

I used fresh green beans and had to cook them a long time, but my husband absolutely loved these. Next time I will definitely have to steam my beans for a minute or two first. It works just fine with margarine... just don't add any salt.

I loved this! I used one can of italian cut green beans (figured they would hold up better to sauteing & they did) & I have been buying whole, peeled garlic cloves in a jar from Sam's so I just grabbed a handful (probably about 7 or 8 BIG cloves) & sliced them into thick slices. I didn't measure the cheese, just spinkled the green beans w/ it once it was on our plate. I'm a garlic lover & I was picking the garlic pieces out to eat by themselves...they were great!

These green beans were great, though I did make some changes.  I used fresh green beans that I steamed for a bout 10 minutes beforehand. I only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and I used romano cheese. Delicious and everyone enjoyed them!

Very simple way to dress up a boring can of green beans!!  The family loved it and will definitely do again!  On most recipes I usually end up tweaking it a bit, but not this one!  THANKS!!!

This is great! I cut out the butter, and only used one Tablespoon of olive oil with about a half head of minced garlic. I stirred the freshly grated cheese in during the last minute of cooking. My husband and I both loved it.

This is a fabulous and incredibly simple way to make a quick side dish.  I normally use fresh green beans, saute them first in butter / olive oil, and then add the cheese, garlic, and a pinch of salt for the last 1-2 minutes.  Make sure you try this with fresh zucchini and pecorino romano...delicious.

Use the whole head of garlic! Don't be afraid it mellows out when you saute it.  Great easy veggie for the busy people of the world.

Awesome recipe!  I have made it twice now and its been a hit both times.  I used fresh veggies from the garden, so cooking time took longer, but it was very good.  Also I added carrots...  just wonderful!

Gotta tell ya', I cheated to the nth degree and this dish still came out great... I used minced, dried garlic instead of fresh, and used the sprinkle parmesan instead of fresh.  I decided at the last minute to try this dish, so I didn't have anything but the canned green beans and 'substitutions'.  You have to give this recipe a try.  It's seriously a keeper!  Hubby gives it 100 stars:)

The 5 stars are a round up from a 4 1/2. We used a 4 oz. container of garlic and herb Feta Cheese instead of the Parmesan. This was very good!

These were okay. I tried them with canned and then with frozen green beans, and I prefer frozen. I also tried them with and without cheese, and prefer them without cheese. I also tried them with a whole head of garlic and then with just half a head of garlic and prefer just half. This is a pretty good recipe, but with a little changes, it could be awsome!

I have made this recipe several times for dinner parties and have always received rave reviews!!  I have always used steamed fresh beans (can't stand the flavour of canned beans) and that's worked great.  My only suggestion is to make extra as there has never been enough.

I followed a reviews idea and used parsley instead of tarragon and prior to serving, I taste-tested the beans and found they didn't need the parmesan cheese.  The buttery-garlic flavor was enough!  In fact, I served these to a friend of mime and she said she could have made a meal of of the green beans.

I wish I could rate this more stars!!  Couldn't stop eating them at the dinner table last night -I did use frozen green beans, and really can't imagine what this would be like if using canned.  I will continue to use frozen, and if on hand, fresh.  Easily one of the best green bean dishes I have ever prepared.

The only vegetable my 4 yr old will eat are Green beans, so you can imagine that we eat them a lot.  For the adults, it was a nice change from plain green beans and my daughter had 3 servings!  
These were very easy to make.  I used canned green beans and cut the recipe in half.  I would cut the butter and oil even more next time because they were a little greasy.

A tasty way to eat green beans.  I would cut back on the oil when preparing next time.  I used fresh beans instead of canned.  I steamed them for appox 5 mins first.

WOW -- Excellent flavor.  Husband & sons loved this one!  I smashed my garlic thru a press right into the skillet and used canned french cut green beans.  They cooked up quickly after the garlic was browned and were delicious!  We will be adding this to the "regulars" list of vegetables at our house!  THANKYOU!

I didn't like this recipe at all. Other people at the Thanksgiving table liked it, but for some reason, I didn't.  I probably won't make it again, but for those who do, I'd use fresh green beans instead of canned.

Oh yeah!  This is great.  We served it with lasagne, and didn't add the cheese.  With something less cheesy, the cheese would be great.  We gobbled it right down.  Wow.  The house smelled of cooking garlic and made everyone really hungry.  We'll have it again, yes we will!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. My 10 year old ate them like they were going out of style and he doesn't even like green beans!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

Excellent beans. I added chopped onion, sauteed with the garlic. Who would think just a few simple ingredients, would make green beans taste so good? The combination of the Parmesan cheese and garlic, just gives a wonderful flavor. This one goes in my recipe box.

Delicious! I am always looking for new ways to prepare green beans.  I usually put them into a casserole with mushroom soup, but this was much quicker and easier.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I will be making it again :)

I am a garlic lover, but this might be a tad too much for others.  I added crumbled bacon to the finished product and it was well-received at a dinner we had with friends.  DEFINITELY reduce the olive oil to 1T in the future!

I added an extra can of beans to cut down the intensity of the garlic and make it more kid friendly.  The taste is excellent.

Couldn't rate it too high on Kid Friendly, but in my house it's difficult for kids to like anything thats not a frenchfry.. (KIDS!).. but hubby loved them, despite him liking his veges naked... he doesn't like trying new things.. typical.. but he was glad i made them.. he'll try them again! WOW, that's got to be an accomplishment!
THANKS!

Amazingly tasty!  I made this with fresh green beans and 2 tsp of oil instead of 3.  I also substituted 1 tsp of olive oil with seasame oil, which made it very flavorful!  I found the garlic to be wonderful after they have been carmalized and I didn't have any freshly grated parm cheese, so I used the dry kind, but it came out just as good!

Great recipe.  I love garlic and these are wonderful.  They are so easy.  I used fresh green beans and cut back on the parmesan cheese a little bit...just sprinkled over the top.  I've made these twice now since Christmas!!!

I thought these were delicious, even if my family wouldn't touch them.  It really helps to have a garlic peeler handy - there are a lot of garlic cloves to peel, which made me give a lower quickness rating.  These are otherwise very easy to make - plan on 10 minutes for sauteeing the garlic, another 10 for heating the beans.  Good enough for company.  If you want to lower the fat content, I think you could easily reduce the amount of oil in the recipe.  I will only use 1 Tbsp. next time.

I made this for company using fresh green beans, cut the olive oil to 1 T. and used 7 big cloves of garlic.  I forgot to add the cheese!  The majority of guests thought these were too garlicky. I loved it even without the cheese but next time will probably cut back to 5 cloves of garlic.

I have made this recipe three times already and would definitely recommend it.  I cut back a little on the overall butter and oil, but it's really a great combination.  Be warned, however, that carmelizing the garlic does take some time.

This recipe was wonderful, I made it last Thanksgiving for a big family dinner, for I was asked to bring a Green Bean dish of somekind and let me tell you this was a very BIG HIT.

Loved this recipe.  Reduced the garlic also.  used diced galic in the jar.  Measured for half stated on recipe.  We dont like the taste of olive oil so we fried 4 pieces of bacon and used the grease instead of olive oil.  tossed in the bacon bits with the green beans.  tasted like good old southern cookin!!

This recipe was really very good. The only problem was the peeling and slicing of all that garlic. I gave up and used a garlic press instead. Much easier. Be prepared for your whole house and body to smell like garlic.

My green bean lover son said , "mom just fix em the regular way" ---they were not bad, but we didn't think they were anything special. Besides 3 T of olive oil plus 1 T of butter -- is a lot of fat to add to any vegetable

This was pretty good. I made a few adjustments, though. I decided not to use the butter and just used the olive oil but 3 Tbsp was still too much. Next time I'll just use 2. I also didn't use fresh garlic; I used a few shakes of garlic sea salt instead. I'm not sure how long I ended up cooking the beans overall. Since I was using canned beans it wasn't really a matter of waiting for them to become tender. Basically I just cooked them until they were warmed through and the rest of what I was cooking was done.

This was good, a little bland though. I added a couple fresh sliced mushrooms because I needed to use them before they went bad. I also cut the olive oil to 1 Tablespoon, because 3 is just too much.

Nice change from steamed beans. I used fresh beans and steamed them for a few minutes before puting them in pan with garlic. Some chopped sun dried tomatoes might be nice too

Great, simple, recipe.  I cut down to 2 TBSP for the olive oil and used 3 gloves of garlic along with some sprinkles of dried granulated garlic until the flavor was right.  I topped the green beans with Parmesan, tossed them, then topped them so that the cheese was melted throughout.

Super easy side dish to add to the repertoire. 
I like my green beans less soft so I may use fresh ones next time and less butter to make the recipe healthier.

Delicious! I used Kerrygold garlic and herb butter to further the flavor. I also steamed the green beans and sauteed them with onions and garlic. Then sprinkle with parmesan before serving. Yum! I will be keeping this one around. Thanks!

Really liked these beans but then I'm a big fan of garlic and this recipe had plenty.  When I make these beans again, I will use a little less butter and olive oil.  As the recipe is presently written, the finished product is a bit greasy.

Everyone at a family dinner seemed to like them except for my 11 year-old stepson who politely whispered in my ear that he didn't like them.  So when his older brother said that he would gladly eat them for him, the 11 year-old decided he would eat them after all.  Apparently spite never tasted so good!  Like others, I steamed fresh green beans and used less olive oil than called for.  I also only used 3 cloves and that was plenty of garlic.

Made this tonight with canned beans for guests.  They loved it! Only thing I did differently was to cook the beans for 20 minutes rather than 10. (As we like ours softer).  Next time I will double the recipe so there will be "seconds." Thanks!

The ingredients were good but I gave it 3 stars because cooking canned green beans for 10 mins is way too long - they are already cooked - just need to be warmed.

Followed the recipe to the letter and thought they were very good. Next time I might increase the amount of garlic though, but I'm a super garlic lover.

I enjoyed this recipe. Next time I try this recipe I will cut down on the olive oil as someone else has suggested. Overall a good twist on green beans.

This is a great recipe, but I also make this with fresh steamed green beans and omit the parmesan cheese and add onions, mushrooms, ginger, & low sodium soy sauce.  Slivered almonds are optional.  Both are really delicious.

Excellent recipe!  My oldest daughter (12 yrs. old) loves anything with garlic, so this made her happy - and my picky daughter managed to eat a few as well.  The only change:  I added some prosciutto (sliced into strips and heated in skillet until crisp) at the end.  I will be making it again tonight for my hubby (who is terrified to try something new!) - to go along with some beautiful ribeye steaks.

Stovetop green bean dish to keep your ovens free for other dishes; many compliments! Also did 3tbs butter and 1tbs oil (instead of the reverse): browned the butter, sauteed the garlic a minute or two until brown, added the bit of olive oil and beans to heat, also a little Parmesan to melt into the beans, dumped it in a serving dish, topped with a little more Parmesan. Tasted amazing! Thanks; this is a keeper!

I've made this many many times.  It's delicious and easy as written but you can also make adjustments (after trying as is) by adding almonds or doing without the butter.  I either use fresh green beans or the bagged ones.

These are pretty great green beans! They have a great flavor and are pretty easy to make, too. Mine were cooked after about 7 minutes. Next time I will definitely reduce the oil and maybe add more Parmesan. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great.  I used frozen green beans, about 1 1/4 tablespoons butter, and 1 tablespoon of oil.  I cooked it for about 6 minutes and then left on warm for the remainder of the ten minutes.  Very tasty.

Daughter fixed these for her first dinner party for us(her parents) and her boyfriends parents.  First time any of us has ever tried them.  AMAZING, everyone loved them and of course wanted the recipe.. The daughter was smart and said this would be "her" one thing that she can make for us on when we all want "Favorites"...  Thank you so much for the great recipe and helping my daughter out to having a SUCCESSFUL party.

We loved these! They were so good! You have to love garlic to love these green beans and we do. I used fresh green beans but other then that I used the recipe exactly as it said to. I think next time I'll omit the butter just to make it healthier.

Excellent, kid friendly recipe. I have a very picky family when it comes to veggies. They all went back for seconds. I added bacon bits, sliced toasted almonds and italian seasoning. I also used steamable green beans.

Really good.  I did make two little changes, I only added 2 tbsps of oil, and I added two heads of garlic.  I love how tasty the cheese at the end makes it.

Would tast much better with fresh green beens and shredded Parmesan instead of grated. Besides that it was good, just a bit mushy.

Very good, simple recipe. I used just EVOO and garlic(minced)...  first cooking the green beans to an 'al dente' stage, if you will...  draining, and then added to the oil/garlic on the stovetop. sauteed for about 5 mins and then sprinkled w/fresh parm. Mmmmm easily and lovely.

Well....everyone liked them!  My son, went back and finished what was left in the serving bowl.  No left overs tonight.    I however next time will next time add a little less olive oil, you don't need that much, in my opinion.   Thanks so much for an easy recipe that makes the ordinary bean into something tasty.

If I could give this four and a half, I would. The garlic should be nearly blackened, and don't skip the cheese.

My mom gave me some canned green beans and I was looking for a flavor combination recipe.  I followed the recipe minus the cheese.  Not bad.  I'm just not that crazy about canned beans - I prefer steamed beans.

Really great!  Almost tastes like the sauteed green beans that I order from the local Chinese restaurant!  I used fresh local greenbeans, and even after I boiled then sauteed them they were still a bit too firm....but otherwise great flavor.  I will make these again, but next time I will experiment with some asian spices (maybe soy sauce) instead of parm cheese.  (Maybe I'll save some money by making these instead of buying them!)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent.  The only change I made was using fresh green beans, adding almond slivers and a little bit of fried bacon.  The flavor was wonderful.  Can't wait to make again.

This was pretty good, but not really any different than the fried style green beans I usually make...  maybe a touch more oily, since I don't use so much stuff in the pan.  Used can green beans as per the recipe.  We usually fry the green beans just with pepper and Johnny's seasoned salt in a little butter until they are slightly crisp, so this lacked a little in the texture department for us.

This recipe was delish!  I had everything on hand except parmesan so I put it together with the intention of picking some up on the way to the party.  They were so good without it that we skipped the cheese altogether.  I only put 1 Tbsp of butter and olive oil and it was the perfect amount.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good way to cook green beans. I used canned beans as the recipe suggests and this tasted great. The parmesan cheese adds a nice flavor. Served with a chicken and wild rice dish and it was a nice compliment.

Amazing is the word to describe these green beans.  This is a wonderful recipe that serves to dress up every-day ordinary green beans; it will meet the needs of busy cooks looking for a quality side dish, and is versatile enough to use while entertaining.  I only wish I would have had more green beans in the bag last night.  Thanks for a truly wonderful dish!

We used frozen green beans (thawed) b/c I despise canned veggies.  I also left the parmsean up to the diner to add themselves.  I am personally not a fan of the parm.  Very good.

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I did alter a little, I added onion and cooked until translucent then added the garlic (which we love garlic so I added double). My whole family loved it. We will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks

Very quick & easy. We cut the amount of garlic in half, which was perfect at least for our tastes.  I will admit that we also forgot to add the Parmesan cheese, but it still tasted great otherwise. Next time we'll add the cheese (and post an updated review).

Great green bean recipe.  everyone in the family liked it.  used fresh green beans but did not steam them before- just plopped them in the pan to saute.  Will make this again and again.

I just served this with dinner last night and my family decided that this is the only way to have green beans from now on.  My 1 and 4 year olds gobbled it up and wanted more.  I reduced the olive oil to 1 tbs not wanting it to be too greasy and added a tad bit more parmesan, it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!! I absolutely love these green beans. I have been trying to incorporate more veggies in our diet, but my husband is EXTREMELY picky about veggies. He has always just absolutely hated any type of bean or pea in existance, and green beans were one thing he just would not touch.

I decided to try this one night because I thought with the garlic and the butter and the sautee feel, he would at least give it a shot. He absolutely LOVED them. We now cook these at least twice a week and he wants these intead of potatoes with his steak now...lol. It is also going to be a big part of our Christmas dinner this year.

The only change I made at all is that I use a Parmesan/Romano/Asiago Cheese Mixture instead of just Parmesan and I add one more tablespoon of butter (the pan was drying out too fast on me). Other than that, there are no major changes. It is wonderful as is.

Thank you SOOO much for this wonderful recipe!!

DELICIOUS side-dish! I thought that these might end up being bland because of the minimal ingredients, but I was wrong! These were so full of flavor, I forgot I was eating a healthy vegetable. I used the french cut green beans in the can. Another time I used frozen french beans, and they were good but not as good as the french cut ones in a can. Highly recommend!

This was really good and super easy to make.  I thought it could use "something" though I haven't pinpointed what that somethimg might be.  Next time I'll experiment with some onion and see how that turns out.

I used fresh green beans and thought this recipe was pretty good.  I was hoping that the rest of my family would like these (they are vegie-phobes), but they didn't.  It was nice to find a new and exciting way to cook green beans.  The only thing I didn't like is that mine turned out a little oily.  When I make these next time, I will reduce the oil to about half.

I thought this was good. My boyfriend thought it was out of this world! I used fresh green beans since they are in season. I sauteed the garlic in oil (omitted the butter). For a few minutes to blend flavors, then cooked the beans in this oil. It ended up taking less time than I thought so I popped it in the oven at 180 degrees to keep it warm while we were waiting for everything else. It ended up melting the cheese and blending everything together. It was very good!

As much as I love garlic I didn't love this recipe.  I found the oil and butter was too much and did not like using canned green beans.  I'll stick with cooking fresh green beans in chicken broth and garlic as I've done in the past.

I was looking forward to enjoying this recipe after reading such great reviews.  The beans were heavy and greasy (and I used fresh, steamed beans) and the garlic was too much. I will definitely NOT be making this again.

One of my favorite veggie dishes on this site. I used fresh steamed green beans (would never use canned), and a little olive oil instead of the butter. I also grated fresh parm on top. So tasty and delicious! The garlic and the beans went perfect together.

These were fantastic!  Of course I made some minor changes...I used olive oil and a bunch of butter, slowly cooked the garlic (4 big cloves) till it was slightly brown then threw in frozen green beans.  We had this with steak and it was just awesome!  Restaurant Quality!!

This was a hit with the family and a nice change from the old fashioned green-beans with bacon and onion. Thanks!

My husband looked really nervous when I opened up green beans from a can! But this recipe is so simple and so good. We were both super suprised how carmelized and wonderful they were. I used crushed garlic instead of slicing cloves ( less messy )- just a tablespoon or so. And then I added a TON of fresh ground black pepper. Can't wait to make this again.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was great, it was gone quickly and everyone asked for the recipe.  Unfortunately I didn't have olive oil, so I used 1.5TB of butter and 1TB of veg. oil and I was concerned that it wouldn't turn out, but it came out great.

LOVE IT!  I used feta cheese instead of parm because I had it.  Love it either way.  often use only olive oil to make it a bit healthier. I've made green beans and other vegies with this recipe as a base many times!

I was excited to try this due to the rave review, but it was NOT good.  I think my 3 stars might even be nice.  The beans were VERY greasy (and i even cut the butter/grease in HALF) and over all they were just yucky. Even my husband who eats almost anything hardly nibbled these.

I absolutly LOVED this recipe. I hate green beans, and this recipe changed the flavor just enough to make me not only eat them to "lead by example" (for my daughter) but I actually liked them...but I wasn't the only one! The whole family liked them. My husband had SIX helpings himself! They are evn good without the parmesan! Thanks for this. Now I can enjoy my veggies too!

Well, try to make these with no distractions!  I used minced garlic and it got burnt when I didn't keep stirring it....Also, I used fresh green beans and forgot to boil them before following the recipe.  Once I figured all this out and the dust had settled :)-  these were very good.

Pretty good, but probably would've been better if I used both fresh green beans and fresh garlic (I used 1tbsp of jarred garlic instead). I didn't use parm cheese either. And it seemed a little too oily for me so I only used 2tbsp of oil instead of 3.

Awesome recipe! They are best with fresh or frozen green beans though. Just give 'em a little steaming and then proceed as it describes with the canned. I am making these for Thanksgiving this year!

These were really good. I halved the recipe, but only put in two cloves of sliced garlic. It was just right. I'd been looking for a different way to make green beans. I also let the garlic brown before I put the beans in. I only had cheapo sprinkle parmesan, but it was fine! Really good and easy!

We don't like canned veggies so I used frozen long green beans and this recipe turned out excellent. I had to cook a little longer because they were frozen like 20 min. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and Italian breaded pork chops.

Way too much garlic.  My family loves garlic and these were hardly touched.  Also didn't like the canned grean beans very much.  Would use less garlic, add bacon and use frozen grean beans next time.

I love garlic, and this recipe was so good! Thanks Ericka. I used fresh beans and steamed them for about 10 minutes before using them in the recipe and they were incredible.

Amazing - They are the absolute best green beans I have ever had.  I can't stop talking about them.  Not only are they very tasty, they are easy to make.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used fresh green beans.  They were cooked to the perfect crispness and had wonderful flavor!  I highly recommend as an alternative to the traditional green bean casserole.

I am not a fan of green beans...until now!! After the first time I made this recipe, I found myself craving it all the time! The second time I made it, we had leftovers, and let me say, I think they're actually better the second time around. I prefer  fresh green beans, steamed or boiled as directed, drain, then "fry" in fresh garlic, a dot of olive oil, and extra butter for only 3 mins. I sprinkle with Cajun seasoning and garlic powder while frying. BEWARE: I have become the official green bean maker for ALL family gatherings and holidays! Lots of pressure, but they always come out great.

The first time I made these green beans, I used fresh green beans, and forgot the cheese. My three of my four kids just didn't like them. I tried them again last night with frozen green beans and used the cheese, and they were a hit. There were none left!

I made these last night. I should have doubled the recipe. I used fresh green beans which I steamed in the mircowave and let them sit in the fridge for a while to cool. Really really good.

These were pretty good.  I even forgot to add the parmesan at the end.  I cheated and used minced garlic and they were still very flavorful.  I should have prepared them with less oil (I had to drain them in a colander before serving) like others suggested but overall really tasty!  Will keep this one on hand...

I made this with one tablespoon of Garlic Infused Olive Oil, one clove of garlic and one can of green beans instead, and it was perfect - especially since my husband is the only one who eats green beans!!!  He definitely wants me to make these again!!! It was a nice change from the same old, warm up can of green beans. 

Thanks Ericka!!!

This was alright.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but it might have needed more pepper.  I used frozen green beans that had been thawed, and added sliced almonds.  It is an easy recipe to make when you don't have a lot of time.

This was excellent!  The beans didn't saute like I thought they would, but were very tasty.  Maybe because I used frozen but thawed beans and they were damp?  Can't imagine using canned (yuk!).  I will definately make this again; also impressive, but simple for company.

This is one of my family's favorite green bean recipes. We use cooked fresh or frozen green beans, however (much better taste). Hint: you can also do this with asparagus and broil for 5 minutes in the oven.

I followed the directions except I used a 16 oz bag of frozen green beans that I cooked and drained first, and only used half a bulb of garlic.  This is a super side dish and would be great even without the cheese!

This recipe was a hit for the whole family! (even my father, who eats NO vegetables) I used fresh green beans rather than canned and sauteed them with a lid on to soak up the flavorful ingredients. Thanks!

I served this for Christmas Eve. I used fresh green beans instead.  They had a beautiful bright green color to them and had a very nice taste of garlic.  My only problem was that I varied the size of the recipe and had more beans than my skillet could fit. Great recipe!

Green beans are a favorite side dish in our home.  For a healthier (and quicker) alternative, we add the green beans to a small pot, add green beans, 2-4 cloves of garlic, salt & pepper to taste and voila!  Once the green beans have been boiling for a few minutes, we drain them, serve them and add the cheese.  Very yummy with Pepper Jack Cheese as well!

I had hoped that these would have been better, I didn't have real garlic so I used Garlic and Onion Powders.  The green beans were just too oily with all the butter and olive oil.  I would not make this again.

This was delicious. I used fresh green beans from the garden, so I zapped them in the microwave for a few minutes first. The garlic is something I don't normally think of going with green beans, but it was great.  I'll make this often.

The ease of preparation is a plus.  I do not care for the taste of canned green beans so I drained and washed the beans.  This recipe is a star in my recipe file. Thanks, Ericka

I used frozen green beans, but besides that (I wouldn't used canned green beans with this) I followed the recipe exactly. I can't wait to try it out on fresh green beans. I served these at a dinner, and as my guest was finishing up the beans he said, "You know, I really dislike green beans - they are my least favorite vegetable - but these are incredible!" And preceded to have two more helpings and the three of us finished the whole dish. I will definitely make beans this way from now on!

Very tasty!  My whole family enjoyed it... it was a bit oily, you may reduce the amount of olive oil, but still it was fine.  I will deffinitely make this one again!  It's a keeper...  Oh, and I used fresh green beans, I steamed them until tenderly crisp beforehand...

Quick and easy.  I used canned green beans but would not do so again.  Would have tasted much better with fresh green beans.  I also only used 2 T. olive oil and no butter so it wouldn't be too oily.

Yum!  These were very flavorful green beans.  I even got my boyfriend to eat them, and he's not a big fan of any vegetables.  I'm going to use these as a side dish with many meals.

What a great way to "dress up" canned green beans.  I didn't use a whole head of garlic, only about 4 cloves, sliced.  Next time, I will cut down a bit on the oil--it didn't need quite that much.  Will definitely make again.

These went over great for Christmas dinner!  I too substituted fresh green beans; could probably cut back on the oil and butter, but they were terrific nonetheless!  The garlic added a great mellow flavor - I'll definetely be adding this to my regular menus!

Wonderful blend of seasonings.  This is a great new way of sprucing up the green bean.  Best part is that it is quick & easy.  I will definitly make again.

I liked this recipe a lot.  It is simple and quick to make.  It also improves upon a vegetable that a lot of people may thing is bland.  My only complaint is that no one went farther with this recipe.  I think the garlic/parmesan mix definitely go better with other vegetables. This recipe isn't very health conscious either.  I won't let that affect my rating, as allrecipes isn't a health conscious board.  But really, was the butter melted in the oil, really necessary?

Every time I make this recipe, I have NO leftovers.  Completely gone!  It's such a pleasing, easy recipe.  I also like to add a few small pieces of shaved country ham while I cook the oil and garlic.  It adds a great southern touch to the dish.  This will stay in my recipe box!

Different taste.  Wasn't my favorite way to make green beans.  They came out kinda mushy too.  Not terrible, but not great either.

This recipe is fantastic.  I use the frozen "French Style" green beans instead of the canned.  I prefer frozen or fresh produce to canned anything, and I think it makes a huge difference in this recipe.

I used frozen green beans, and it seemed to lack the punch I was expecting.  I used a lot of salt and cheese to compensate, and it turned out alright.  Next time I will try canned green beans.

This dish has a unique taste. However, the garlic and green bean combination grows on you. I recommend fresh green beans.

These green beans were good, but too much oil.  I used fresh green beans and minced garlic.  Next time I will use less oil and butter.  For a great taste try the Green Bean and Mushroom Medley.

I really don't like green beans, but this is great!  I love the garlic and the parmesan cheese - not to mention, my veggie-hating-mom even liked it.  I will make this probably once a week from now on.

I made this for Thanksgiving, everyone loved it.  I cut down on the garlic a bit, but only because I was serving a large crowd and was trying to please everyone.  A nice, simple tasty dish.

I prepared this for a family Christmas gathering--it was a huge hit. They ate every last bean! I did use fresh green beans and a little less garlic (about 3 cloves), which the adults loved and the kids were OK with. I have since made it with frozen green beans and it was good too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this as a side dish on Christmas - it complimented the garlic and rosemary game hens that I prepared.  This dish was simple and flavorful.

Excellent recipe...so simple and so satisfying. Green beans are my favorite, so I love 'em just about any way, but...these were awesome! Couldn't keep my fingers out of the pan while they were cooking! I used shredded parmesean instead of grated because that's what I had on hand. Turned out great! Thanks!

What a wonderful change from the basic Holiday green bean casseroles.  So flavorful and different.  Amazing how wonderful the ingredients blended together.  I also suggest adding Onions!  Pleasing teenagers isn't easy-but mine loved it and can't wait to have it again.

I took other reviewer's advice also, and used fresh green beans and less garlic--it was very tasty, and jazzed the green beans up nicely.  Will definitely make these again!

Overall a good recipe. I am a huge garlic fan, but found this recipe to have 
too much for my taste (mark your calenders). I will make this again using the 
suggestions made in the reviews with less oil and garlic and using fresh 
green beans.

While I wouldn't go as far to say that these beans are worthy of raves, I will say that they were pretty good. We only used one tablespoon each of butter and olive oil. All that fat is not required!!!

This was an interesting twist on plain old green beans. I love garlic and like green beans, but i think this was a bit much on the garlic side. I am not sure if I would make these again, but they were pretty good. Just a little overpowering on the garlic.

Everyone who's ever tried these said they were terrific.  I don't even like green beans but have been searching for vegetable dishes that weren't starchy.  I haven't cooked green beans any other way since I found this recipe and even I crave green beans after eating this dish.

I fixed this for the camping group Saturday dinner and there were no left overs.  I had space problem in my motorhome so I opted for canned green beans instead of fresh and still got rave reviews.

This recipe can be improved upon by steaming fresh green beans instead of using the flabbier textured canned beans, and using shredded or shaved parmesan or romano instead of grated for improved adherance to the beans.  We also had to cut back tremendously on the amount of olive oil and butter after making these the first time, as they were so greasy we had to drain them on paper towels before they were edible.

Great taste but next time I make them I'll use fresh or frozen green beans. The canned ones are just too soft and turn to mush.

My entire family truly enjoyed eating this dish and everyone rated it a "5."  I will definitely make this dish again and again as this was mighty tasty and we cannot say enough about this dish.

This is one of my favorite side dishes ever. I have probably made it more than 10 times. I recommend not using whole green beans, I recommend using French style green beans.

Easy and tasty. Reduced the olive oil to 1 Tbsp and sauteed an onion before adding the garlic. I steamed the green beans, rinsed in cold water and then added them to the pan. Great side dish for Christmas dinner.

I made this just as it was stated, because I'm not a cook and it was very good.  My son doesn't like green beans and I didn't have to fight him to eat them so, that alone makes it four stars.

My family loved this and every bite was eaten.

  I used frozen beans because that‚Äôs what I had on hand.  I added a bit of diced onion and reduced oil to 1 tablespoon. Very good! 

I will make this again.

SO GOOD. My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe, and it is so quick and easy to do. I do use frozen beans instead of canned ones though, and I just throw in however many I think we will eat.  I don't think I will ever eat green beans another way again.

We made this to go along with Christmas dinner today and it was fantastic. My wife decided that "1 medium head of garlic" couldn't possibly be right; that's an awful lot of garlic, so she used 3 fairly big cloves of garlic, definitely not the whole head. She also used frozen green beans instead of canned; otherwise, stayed with the recipe as written, and it turned out great.

This is quite good, if you can get past the washed-out appearance of canned green beans; the color isn't nearly as bright or fresh as I'd like. Knowing they were canned vegetables, I seasoned the green beans rather heavily with salt and pepper- and that, combined with the Parmesan cheese, gave them a good flavor. Would make this side dish again!

Excellent, I made this with fresh Green Beans so I added 1/2 cup of water so that the beans wouldn't fry in the oil and butter. They turned out great. Will make this recipe again!

This is a very tasty side dish. I omitted the butter and just used olive oil. I also added a little more fresh garlic only because I love garlic. The green beans didn't get mushy like I thought they would and they were a bit with my 8 year old who's very picky. We have made it a few times and we will cont to make them.

LOVE these! Great twist on green beans that the whole family loves! I cooked them a little different: Cook covered for 10-15 minutes until tender, then uncovered about 5-10 until beans appear "dry". Definitely quick and easy, but still restaurant quality!

Love this recipe! If you're looking for something different from the standard (boring) green bean, this is worth a try. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I both loved it. Will definitely be incorporating this one into my regular veggie rotation.

This was a great dish except the reference to using an entire "medium" sized bulb of garlic was very vague.  My "medium" sized garlic was a LOT of garlic and could have been cut in half.

I misread the amt of butter and put 3 tbsp and cut down on 1tbsp of oil. I substituted avocado oil for olive oil.  I also used fresh frozen green beans and I will definitely be making this again.  In my books this is A1+++

I don't know why anyone adjust this, it was perfect just the way it was. I did use fresh green beans and think that definitely makes it just right for my family. My husband loves garlic and parmesan so when I saw this I had to try. Such a hit with him he went back for seconds. I have saved this one for later use!!

I made this dish, and it was awesome! My picky wife, and daughter both loved it. It also made the kitchen smell great while cooking. Next time, I think I will add some bacon.

First, I used frozen green beans that I steamed in the microwave. No one in my family really cared for this. In all fairness, I will try again using canned green beans.

I made these beans exactly as stated in the recipe, with the exception of the garlic. I used 3 cloves of garlic. It's amazingly delicious!! I recommend it!

I thought these were very good and a nice change from plain.  I reduced the olive oil down to 1 tbsp with 1 tbsp of margarine and there was still plenty of oil.

My kids liked it! Well, at least one of them. She had seconds. I made this as written except that I never measure anything and I never did add salt and pepper. My beans were fresh, steamed for just five little minutes first. I liked it OK, but I have to add a star if any of the kiddos approve.

I added onions & used frozen green beans.  I liked the parmesan cheese, but it was kind of a mess.  Maybe adding panko with the cheese would be a good idea.  Add then don't stir.

We thought this was just ok, even with freshly steamed green beans (I can't imagine how this recipe would work with canned beans).  Quite greasy too, sorry but I would not make this again.

If you prefer fresh vegetables, I do not recommend trying this recipe.  It tastes good, but those who are searching for something a little more gourmet, this is probably a weak version.

The beans and cheese were an intriguing combination, and the garlic added a nice kick. However, I still felt it needed something else - maybe soy sauce?

Not bad, although I would use less oil next time. Was also very garlicky and I liked that. I used fresh beans and didn't measure them (about a medium sized round tupperware's worth) so I think I had too much oil.

I think these would have been better with fresh green beans instead of canned. I also thought they were way too greasy. But they were tasty, nonetheless. And they were quick, too, and that is always a plus.  I'll have to try fresh and see how that goes.

This was really easy to make, made it for thanksgiving side dish.  I suggest taking out the green beans and mixing the rest of the mixture with the mashed potatoes, this tasted really good as well.

Great side dish...made them with a rump roast and baked potatoes. I did not use canned green beans but used a bag of  green beans that I put in the microwave to defrost for two and a half minutes. I only used 2 tbs. of olive oil because I ran out of it and that was plenty along with the butter and I used minced garlic. The salt and pepper added good flavoring. Everyone liked them and it will be a regular dish for us. Thanks.

These were good but not great. The amount of butter and oil is great if you are using fresh green beans (which need to be boiled a little first) but it's waaay too oily if using canned beans. I would make this again using canned beans but maybe use 1T olive oil and 1T margarine.

I really enjoyed that this recipe was so easy to prepare.  And my husband even said it made the canned beans taste good.  But I believe the recipe could be made better by using fresh beans.  We also used Asiago chese.  We'll be making this again.

I absolutely adore these green beans!  I use fresh (parboiled) instead of canned and I use a very liberal amount of sliced garlic and use shredded parmesan.  The garlic taste very "candied" when done and I could eat a plateful of these green beans using my fingers!

These were really good.  I used fresh beans from a friend's garden, and they were so tasty.  I don't like canned vegetables, if I was going to make these out of season, I'd use frozen as they taste so much better than canned.

I was skeptical after reading many reviews, so I tried the beans without the cheese and they were good.  I then took a few out and sprinkled with the cheese and tried them...they were great also!  This recipe is worthy of at least a try!  They remind me of a chinese restaurant's sauted green beans.  I did use fresh, uncut green beans(washed them) and threw them right in the skillet.  Yummy...My daughter wanted seconds!

Great way to serve green beans, while still being pretty healthy. They had a lot of flavor and I'll make it again.

I didn't have really high hopes for this recipe....green beans?  Though I like green beans, they always taste like, well green beans.  But these were special, these were memorable. These are quite tastey!

Delicious and guest-worthy!  I thought the flavors complimented each other.  I did cut back a bit on the garlic - I used about 7 cloves.  And I love not using the oven in the summer.

I made these using frozen green beans, and it just didn't do it for me.  They were bland and oily.  I would assume just eat the beans plain rather than go through the trouble of preparing them like this.  Oh, and the parmesan cheese was just an odd flavor to have with the beans.

Used a frozen bag of French green beans from Trader Joe's and jarred garlic. Very tasty. I like to add some dried basil and a little sugar as well.

I'm giving this 2 stars because my family did not care for the taste at all.  It was a good idea, it just wasn't for us.  Something about the green beans and the parm didn't work well together.  Oh well, you can't like them all!

I made this with fresh green beans and reduced the garlic by half. All in all, a very good green bean dish. Wife initially balked at the idea of parmesan with green beans, but we both agreed that it was an excellent compliment to the beans. Also, the garlic flavor does not get taken up much by the beans, but if you have enough in there, you can get a nice slice of garlic with each bite, which really kicks up the flavor over all. I plan to use a whole head, as the recipe states, next time around.

Nice change of pace from plain green beans.  I thought this tasted better after letting it just sit for about 10 minutes.  I left off the cheese because my husband doesn't like it.  I also used just 1T of olive oil and halved the rest of the recipe.

The flavour was great, though they were pretty mushy.(That's why I only gave this 3 stars) I think using frozen (or fresh when availible) would be better then the canned for this recipe. But like I said, great flavour.

These were a nice alternative to plain old beans. I made them for the second time last night, but added a splash of lemon juice. Still four stars without it though.

One of my favorite sides - I use extra garlic and a blend of romano, asiago and parmesan cheeses - wonderful!

Wow! Yummy! If you ever do green beans for a dinner side, this is definitely the way to go, a little extra flavor with hardly extra prep time. A must if you love garlic infused dishes. Will do again!

These were tasty nothing to rave about though.  If you want a different spin on your average green beans then this is the recipe.  Its was easy and garlicy.

This dish was very good. I used 24 oz frozen french green beans with almost a whole head of garlic...had to use some of it in another dish. I think the french beans made all the difference. They are very skinny and tender, it's hard to not love them. I added a touch of cheese while cooking, then had it at the table so the kids could add more. My chidren, who generally don't prefer green veggies (except salad), actually asked for seconds. I can hardly wait to try the left overs...I'm sure the garlic taste will be even more intense!

Very good recipe, easy to make, and sooo garlic-y! I sliced up 5 cloves of garlic and the parmesan cheese just gives it a wonderful flavor. I'll use this again when in need of a fast and easy green bean recipe.

I kind of combined this recipe with "Quick Chicken And Wine". I started with butter & garlic. Added the parmesan encrusted chicken until browned. Then added the wine. During the last 10 minutes I added fresh (instead of canned) green beans. SOOO GOOOD! Thanks for the idea!

Very simple and tastey recipe. I used fresh green beans and instead, minced garlic and let them cook for 2-5 minutes. They turned out nice and firm, and slightly crunchy which was nice.

I bought some fresh beans at the market, and wanted to try something new with them. My boyfriend loves green beans, but wasnt crazy about these. I only used 1-2 tblspoons evoo, but it was still too much. Will try again with less oil.

Very good!  I give this 4 stars because I think it's way to much oil.  I used about 2 Tbsp and it was too much.  I think one would be plenty.  The flavor was great and my 1 year old ate and ate them.

These green beans were delicious!  I didn't use quite as much oil as the recipe called for, but that's the only thing I changed.

I really like this one, but my kids didn't eat it well.  I made 1/2 the recipe and my husband was home late and didn't get to try because I ate almost the whole bowl.  I think I'll try less oil and more butter to see if the kids like it better.

Excellent recipe. Thanks Ericka. I used 2 pounds of FRESH green beans and while it took a little longer than 10 minutes to get them tender, it was worth the wait because the green beans were very flavorful.  I cooked mine so that they would be al dente. Yummy!

This is a quick way to add a little flavor to bland green beans.  It was good, but not great.  I'm sure I'll make it again because it's so easy.

I am a green bean lover and I have the hardest time getting frozen green beans to have a good flavor.  I loved this recipe and will make it often.  The only thing is I didn't use the parmesan cheese.  They were still terrific.

Don't be afraid to use the whole head of garlic.  I was, and as a result the beans were a bit bland.  Fresh beans are always tops.

This was a great alternative to green bean casserole.  My boyfriend loved it--I thought it was good but not great--in any case it will become a regular in our house-I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great-thanks for the recipe!

I used fresh green beans and forgot the chesse in the midst of dinner rush, but found them to be wonderful.  Only thing wrong was that I chopped the garic instead of slicing ( I misread) and it was a little too browned, but I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

I made these for Christmas dinner and they were a huge hit.  I used two bags of frozen green beans which I thawed first.  I also used grated Romano instead of Parmesan.  Great for dinner and great for leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is such a yummy side dish.  Even people who hate veggies ate this.  I used fresh beans and they were crisp and sweet...you can cut down on the oil/butter pretty easily.

Wow!  This was great!  (And for those of you who didn't add the Parmesan cheese, my advice is, ADD IT!)  It was delicious.  I used a bag of frozen beans and thawed them in the microwave.  I only used 2 TBL of olive oil (next time I will try one) and followed the recipe.  (I just made them and am trying to keep myself from eating any more as I know my hubby will love them.)  You will so enjoy them, especially if you are not a green bean fan!  These are easy and delicious!

Yippee! Great recipe! I used fresh beans, about one pound, and blanched them for about 5 minutes first in a little bit of water. I would make this next time with a little less cheese, but overall, it's a delicious way to make green beans. Will become a staple for us. YUM!

I tried this recipe today with fresh green beans...burnt the garlic. I'm a new cook and don't know how I can prevent burning other than throwing it in after cooking the beans, and since it says to cook it 10 minutes, i was waiting for it to get tender. Will try a variation next time.

I used fresh beans instead of canned and let them slowly simmer/steam on low heat, waiting for guests to arrive.  They were perfect!

At first it seemed like a lot of garlic, so I used half the amount and used fresh instead of canned green beans.  This recipe was delicious and a definate make again!  Highly recommended!  Thanks.

Simple and quick recipe. Goes well with pretty much anything. I think it'd be better with fresh green beans.

Ok...my daughter and I did not like these at all while my husband and son loved it. Def a mixed review. I can't really say what it was that I didn't like...perhaps I should have drained all of the juice from the beans. It was on the salty side so if not draining the juice go very easy on the salt.

A delicious variation on regular green beans!  The garlic and parmesan are a fantastic addition to this dish.  It's quickly become a family favourite - I make it at every gathering, and there's never any leftovers.

This was ok, but I think it would have been better with fresh green beans instead of canned. I would also think it would be better if the beans were not cooked so soft.

This is one recipe that you must try.  It is really great.  The only change I made was that I used frozen green beans (thawed) and just followed the recipe as it is written.  If you have any leftovers, they are just as tasty reheated.  The garlic is wonderful, don't by shy in adding the whole head of garlic.  Simply wonderful!

These were so good.  I used frozen green beans and also kept the lid on to soak up the flavor.  I also added garlic salt.  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese at the end but this recipe was great as was.

I used only 1 tablespoon of the olive oil because I thought 3 would make it too oily and I omitted the cheese.  It was a very good and quick side dish.  Thanks!

I made this recipe with one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon oil. I also added a little more garlic than called for cause I love garlic. I added salt and pepper to taste.  Although they tasted fine without the parmesan cheese I wanted to try it and it made it have a little more taste.
Oh, I also used frozen green beans, frozen as canned green beans make me nauseous. thanks, ericka.  The parmesan did add a nice touch to it.

These were really just "okay".  I make the majority of the veggies at our house very similar to this, with a little less and butter and garlic and no parm cheese and my veggies seem to have a better flavor than these.  Maybe it was becasue they were green beans, we like this recipe with brocoli, zucchini etc. Try this recipe using veggies you would "stir fry".

YUM!  This was a delicious way to use my green beans.  The carmelized garlic and parmesan cheese was such a wonderful, mouth-watering combination. Just be careful not to burn the garlic! It will ruin the whole dish.

Pretty good.  A nice different way to use green beens.  Kind of oily on the green beans.  I would cut down on the oil used.

This was great! I usually don't eat vegetables and I went back for seconds. I used frozen green beans. I cooked the half the time called for, drained them and added to the garlic. It beautifully.Yum!

WoW!  I loved these!  I used 7 cloves of crushed garlic and it was just right for the meal.  I will reduce the oil next time as they were a little greasy.  They tasted great without the parmesan too!

This recipe really surprised me.  I am a garlic lover but my kids aren't.  I made this last night and my daughter kept asking for more.  My husband and I loved it.  It was so easy to make and was delicious!

This is a really good recipe for green beans.  As the other reviews state, I probably will not use a full 3 tablespoons of olive oil in the future.

Great way to get the non-vegetable eaters to dish some out onto their plates!  I used mozzarella cheese instead of the parmesan because I am not a big parmesan fan.  Another recipe that is requested for me to fix at every family event.  Definately a family favorite!
