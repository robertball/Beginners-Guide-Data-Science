This is a dessert I make often in the summertime--my husband especially likes these. This also works with different pudding flavors and Nutella in place of the peanut butter. To make it stretch a little farther and a fluffier filling, you can fold in a cup or so of whipped topping.

I whipped these easy treats up for our grandsons and the adults dug in, too! Simple, on-hand ingredients, quick assembly, and enjoyed by all on this July 4th weekend. Next time, going to use chocolate graham crackers and banana pudding with the melted peanut butter, kind of a frozen chocolate banana. Thank you, Linda (LMT)! It's a keeper!

Recipe Group: Good stuff... I found it strangely salty, maybe my peanut butter. I have always had a thing for peanut butter and graham crackers, this is taking it up a notch! I used waaaay more than a tablespoon of pudding mix per sandwich, and there was enough filling for 24 sandwiches (which is exactly one box of the 'fresh stack' Honey Maids). I didn't precisely melt the pb, I just used the soften feature on my micro, and did not find the need for step 2. Can't wait to share these special treats, thanks for sharing the recipe!

A very simple and easily made frozen delight. So simple, my GK's made these for their snack. They loved making them and sprinkling the candy sprinkles around the edges. An oldie but goodie recipe that brings back a lot of fond memories and an opportunity to make new memories with the young ones! This was the Recipe Group selection for week of July 14, 2014.

Made for Recipe Group. So easy and so good. I took a little license with the recipe when I found the graham crackers were expired and tasted like cardboard. I had a few good ones, so piped the filling into ritz crackers and then tried some pretzels too! I tried them frozen and thawed. I have to say I like them thawed better than frozen. Maybe it wasn't hot enough here that day :) Thanks Linda! - I even used the leftover pudding mixture to dip ritz into later in the week, a guilty pleasure!

Totally addictive! I can not stop eating these. Next time I want to try with vanilla pudding and peanut butter. Bet that combo would be awesome too.  Good job Linda. This one is a winner!

Made these for the Recipe group. I made the filling just as directed but used chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies instead of grahams since we like cookies better and I had some on hand. I even got a little creative and rolled some in crushed peanuts. Five stars for being a super easy to make dessert that you don't have to bake, and great tasting! Thanks Linda (LMT) for a great summer treat.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they couldn't have been any easier to make!  To melt the peanut butter, I measured it in a one cup glass measuring cup and microwaved for one minute.  Perfect.  I garnished some with some decorated sprinkles, for a fun look.  My 5 y/o granddaughter couldn't stay out of these and loved helping make them!  The rest of the family can't stay out of them either :D  Thanks for the recipe, Linda (LMT)!

I did these way late for Recipe Group. And tweaked them all over the place (= I used sf, ff vanilla pudding and nf milk. I also mixed in a dollop of Cool Whip. I made sandwiches with cinnamon grahams, vanilla wafers, and chocolate teddy grahams. Mom loved these - and I was afraid I wasn't going to have any to take to work (= I liked all three variations.

Recipe Group Selection for July 12, 2014 – This is a fun and easy summer treat that would be fun to make with the kids.  There will be plenty of licked fingers!   Next time I’m trying it with Nutella.

This makes way more than 16 graham crackers. Didn't find that I needed the step of 3 minutes in fridge to thicken either. Easy to make and delicious.

Very easy, very good.  I used chocolate chip cookies (bought, they were on sale)in place of the graham crackers and used a tablespoon-sized scoop to measure out the pudding mixture, getting 24 sandwiches before running out of cookies. I found the filling to be a little heavy and with too much peanut butter for my taste, but my husband loves them just as they are.  Great for using up milk before it goes bad, too.

I just made these, but I guess I wasn't the only one who made them late for Recipe Group. The peanut butter and chocolate pudding is so yummy. I used natural peanut butter. DD and I were eating it by the spoonful right out of the bowl. I finally forced myself to wait for one of the sandwiches to freeze, and it was very good. I used probably at least 2 T instead of just 1 on the square. Great little snack Linda--thanks!

Made this for Recipe Group 7/14/14 and they're a HIT! Good straight from the freezer, or slightly defrosted for a creamier textured filling. I didn't have store bought instant pudding, so made the "Hasty Pudding" recipe on this site using only 1.5c milk. Turned out great. I will put 3/4" of filling in each sandwich next time - I only put about a 1/2" thickness this time, as I didn't know if it would squish out when bitten into. It doesn't! Excellent no bake dessert! Thanks for sharing, Linda (LMT).

These are very good. I used regular graham crackers instead of chocolate because I couldn't find them in the store. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe is very quick and easy.  I will definitely make these again!

These were a nice alternative to ice cream sandwiches. To make a lighter dessert, I used sugar-free instant pudding mix, 1% milk, and low-fat graham crackers. Note: If using sugar-free pudding mix, the box will be 1.4oz instead of 3.9oz. You only need to use one box of the sugar-free variety. Anyway, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow!  I made these for my daughter's college graduation party and they were devoured in no time, getting many great reviews from family and friends!  I did alternate and used both regular and chocolate graham crackers and vanilla and chocolate pudding.  Definitely a keeper recipe since you can make them ahead and pull them out when you need them.  My son needs them all the time!

I made this as a special treat for family at our cabin. Everyone loved the treat and the kids were brokenhearted when they were all gone. They will become a staple of cabin life going forward. I not only loved eating them, I loved how quick and easy they were to make. Win - win!

This is fabulous.  I had only a Jello White Chocolate pudding on hand so I used it in place of the chocolate called for in the recipe.  The peanut butter swirls against the white chocolate are attractive too.

Made it as is but minus about a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter. Still had the peanut butter taste though. Love this recipe! Perfect for the summer! Thanks for sharing.
