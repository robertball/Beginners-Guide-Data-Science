I could taste the applesauce and it just wasn't what I expected.

This recipe takes a little time, but it is well worth the wait.  My kids begged for more!

Easy to make and it has turned out well every time.  I put 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips sometimes.  Held together well when they were shipped in Christmas packages.

I personally didn't care for these muffins but my family loved them.  I only made 11 and it took about and hour for 4 people to devour them.

Definitely an acquired taste.  The first time I made them, I wasn't crazy about it.  The second time, they were much better.  I'm not sure what it is as I did it the exact same way.  Maybe I just had to get used to the taste.  They're very moist and fudgey.  Definitely will make it again and again.
