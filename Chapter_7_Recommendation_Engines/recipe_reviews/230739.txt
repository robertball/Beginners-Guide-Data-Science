This cake was delicious, moist, perfectly formed and beautiful!  I followed the recipe exactly, but baked in a 8.5x11 in glass dish.  It took a little longer to bake (about 10 minutes more), but turned out fabulously!

I used Truvia Baking Blend (for the first time) instead of sugar, and it worked great in this recipe.  The raspberries sweeten the cake, and the lemon zest brightens the flavor.  Very nice coffee cake.

I made this in Sweden while visiting our son, his wife and grandson! They invited the neighbors over for dinner. Swedes love their confections and pastries and it’s all excellent so the pressure was on!  And there are wild raspberries in the woods next door!  We didn’t have sour cream so I substituted Creme fraiche  and yogurt to make one cup. It turned out beautifully, family and guests loved it- they asked for the recipe!

Nice, but took closer to 1hr+ to fully bake.

Love Love Love this cake!  I've made it at least a dozen times now with different fruit combinations, and it's even better with strawberries and rhubarb.  I use a larger baking dish so that the ratio of cake to fruit is smaller which keeps the cake moist and the flavour full.  The lemon crumble on the top is a lovely touch!

This was good, but I had to make a few changes. I always use half whole wheat flour, subbed brown sugar in the topping. The butter made the center pretty soggy and it took longer to bake. With that change next time I think it will turn out better- will definitely tweak and keep trying!

I really wanted to like this but it was a total miss for us. My son 12, who eats most anything didn't like it at all. 

I have been cooking for over 30 years and always follow a new recipe exactly as written to give respect to it where it is due, then tweak if I like it next time.

We found this to be very heavy, mushy and far to dense. It didn't even have that yummy bakery smell while cooking. I suppose it is all a matter of taste but for us it was not good at all.

This recipe was great.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of the sour cream.  I was out of it so I substituted Stoneyfield lemon greek yogurt and it was wonderful.  This is going to be my go to recipe for fruit coffee cake.  I'm going to try it with different fruits.
