Lowfat and delicious!  I use light ranch dressing and rosemary instead of basil plus a little salt and cracked black pepper. I also add a little olive oil to tenderize the chicken and reserved 1/4 of the marinade to baste the chicken with while grilling. I cut the chicken into cubes for kabobs and put everthing into a ziploc bag to marinate for a few hours.  Very moist!

***WOW*** My family LOVES this recipe! I've been using Allrecipes for well over a year, and I just joined so I can finally rate this recipe! I've used this SO many times, and it is the BEST! I use regular Ranch dressing (not non-fat), more fresh basil,(about 1/2 cup chopped),and fresh ground pepper to taste. I also pound the chicken first, then marinate. The longer the better, sometimes overnite, but a few hours works as well. It is fork tender, cooks quickly, and does not get any easier than this. TRY IT!! For those that thought it was bland (?) try a pinch of cayenne possibly. :-)

Very easy to prepare.  I was not overly impressed with the taste so I don't think I will make it again.

Excellent recipe for a quick easy bbq'd chicken dinner.  Used the home made ranch dressing found on this site. Entire family loved it...even the picky eaters.

Delicious, fast, and easy.  We used Kraft Light Done Right Ranch and had no problems with burning.  Used garlic salt instead of garlic and though the taste came out great.  We'll use it again!

tried this out since my husband and I both love ranch ... tasted good. However, I guess I was looking for more ranch flavor then it had --I did marinate for at least 4 hours. Next time will use ranch packet and make a marinade. The chicken did taste good and will make again with modifications.

for only being 2grams of fat, i rate this recipe a 5! It was delicious! Just the right amount of flavor, and very quick to make.  I used sour cream and onion fat free ranch instead.  My only problem is the burning, but that could be because i had the heat on a little too high.Overall--Satisfying!!!

I was looking for something different than the typical barbeque sauce on the chicken so this was a welcome change.  I watched the chicken closely but it still burned a little, so be careful.
Also, the flavor would probably be more intense if you marinated it for longer than 1/2 an hour. 
Good flavor and moist.

A keeper. Had fresh basil from the garden, crushed the garlic instead of chopping. I used boneless thighs and chicken breast, baked it at 375. When the chicken was cooked I removed it and set it aside, added half a can of chicken broth and a couple of shakes of flour. Served over hot spaghetti with the sauce and we loved it. A great quick recipe for busy nights.

Easy, quick, mild yet very good flavor.  Cooked on our gas BBQ and enjoyed very much, will definitely be making again. I used Bacon Ranch Dressing which gave it a nice flavor.

Marinated my chicken overnight, so I was expecting more of a burst of flavor.  The flavor was light and would have been perfect as an addition to a salad, but on it's own, it just didn't have enough oomph to carry it as a main course! Served with Jules Braised Beans from AR and homemade caramelized onion bread.  Thank you Trudi for the opportunity to try something new.

this recipe was a hit at a party we had this weekend. instead of the fat free dressing, i made a package of hidden valley ranch dressing and marinated it in that. i also drizzled extra dressing left over on the chicken and it was a huge hit!

This chicken was easy and good for the grill. I think I should have let it marinade all day though because I wanted it to be more flavorful.  It was very tender and juicy though.

The flavors imparted by the dressing, garlic, and basil are really good, but my dressing sort of separated from my chicken during cooking.  Visually it's wasn't the most appealing, but it tasted delicious.

Just OK.  A little dry when cooked on medium heat, but tried it again on low and the result was much better.

The best chicken I have ever tasted!! Love the Basil. I have made it without the basil because I didn't have any and it is not the same. Has to have it, the more the better.I serve it all the time and everybody I know loves it.

Delicious!  I love all the garlic in this recipe.  I wrapped the chicken breast in thick cut bacon and baked in the oven for about 40 minutes and then broiled for a few minutes.  I added Havarti cheese immediately after removing from the oven.  If I wasn't low-carbing it, this would make a great bacon-ranch chicken sandwich.  I think the bacon and cheese makes this a 5 * recipe.  Thanks Trudi!

As other reviews said, can't taste the marinade after it's cooked.  I tried a second time and added one packet of the dry ranch dressing mix, marinate while I was at work (8 hours) and flavor was more intense, both by baking and grilling.  But if using the original recipe, baking it yields the most flavor since most of the sauce stays on the chicken.

I used the powdered packet of ranch dressing, mixed it with some olive oil & white wine vinegar.  I added the chicken, basil & garlic to this & marinaded about 3 hours.  Fantastic on the grill!!!

This was terrific!  Chicken was tender and very flavorful.  Super easy as well.  Husband said the ony suggestion would be to perhaps put some of the sauce aside to drizzle on top before serving.  I'm putting this in my 'good enough to serve to guests' recipe box!  Thanks for sharing.

Great simple recipe. Who would've thought ranch dressing and garlic? I've heard of italian dressing being a great marinade. I used Hidden Valley fat free ranch and it has enough flavor in it (more than kraft) so I only put half the basil in, which turned out perfectly. Grilled it on George Foreman. Doesn't look too pretty but turned out great!

This was great!  I knew it sounded good, but it was really tasty.  I used dried basil and cooked it on a grill pan on the stove, and it was really great.

I'd actually give this 3.5 stars becasue it wasn't awful. It just wasn't very strong in flavor. I marianted it over night in the garlic and ranch dressing then lightly dredged it with crumbs and baked. I think next time I'll get the powdered mix  and add that along with the dressing and maybe some olive oil. This does have potential. :)

I thought this was pretty good, and definately easy.  I used the actual ranch dressing since it was all I had.  After marinating, I baked the chicken at 350 for about 45 minutes - I didn't want to clean up the mess that would've been left on my George Foreman grill!  Thanks!

I do like both ranch and garlic, and I'm quite used to making fat-free dressings and such... but this just didn't retain any flavor of the marinade.  For someone who only puts barbecue sauce on the barbecue I suppose it's something interesting and different, but I make a huge variety of chicken things and this just wasn't all that exciting.  I have a feeling baking it would retain the flavor a little better and perhaps some day I'll try that.

Very good. I added a little extra garlic (4 cloves squeezed, not chopped) and marinaded it overnight. Watch the heat of the grill. You don't want to burn the marinade. I may try baking the chicken next time just to see the difference.

We really liked this. We didn't have any fresh basil, so we used Italian seasoning instead. We also added lots (lots) of garlic, only because we love it. Definitely one to make again!

Ridiculously easy recipe. I doubled the garlic since I like it so much, and added a few dashes of hot sauce. Put it in the fridge to marinate while I went to the gym for a couple hours, and then popped em in the oven. Couldn't be easier, and good flavor. I'd make it again in a flash.

Very good and simple recipe.  I cut the chicken into strips and sprinkled with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and dried basil.  Then covered with ranch dressing and baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.

This was good but you really had to let the ranch dressing mix with the chicken before grilling or baking. I used light ranch instead of fat free and added alittle more spices for a stronger flavor. You can also use the dry dressing mixes( hidden valley) in this recipe and on turkey burgers as well.
will make again

I love the flavor of ranch, and I tend to eat a low-cal, low-fat diet. However, the low-fat ranch gave this recipe a strange after taste. Next time, I'll try a reduced amount of homemade ranch. Fewer chemicals and maybe a better flavor? Every now and then, it's good to splurge on the full fat stuff. Maybe this is one of those times.

When I went to marinate the chicken I realized I only had a little bit of Ranch dressing left so I added mayo, milk and olive oil to the marinade. I doubled the garlic and let it marinate overnight. The chicken was juicy, and full of flavor (especially garlic!)I grilled it and served it with brown rice and broccoli for a healthy meal!

This recipe is one of the best that my wife and I have tried in a long time.  My wife is a very picky eater and doesn't like to many things so in order to have her enjoy grilled chicken I thought I'd give this recipe a try for a change.  My wife and I loved the flavor of the ranch and basil.  The flavor actually remains even after grilling it which doesn't always happen.  Any time someone asks for a good grilled chicken recipe I always mention this one.

Unfortunately after reading the reviews I decided to change this recipe before I even made it.  I used a 1 oz. packet of ranch dip mix instead of the wet dressing.  I added that to a resealable plastic bag with some olive oil and the other ingredients to make a marinade.  This turned out great with the changes made.

I loved this recipe. I only had smaller pieces of boneless chicken breast and one large breast. The smaller pieces seem to hold the ranch mixture better when put on the grill. It was tender, moist and favorful.

I was hoping for ranch chicken, but it the flavor seemed to disappear during grilling, and what was left was pretty bland. Maybe using a dry ranch seasoning packet as a rub would have been better...but I guess that would be a whole different recipe. This was not a repeater for me.

Light ranch flavor, but the chicken breast was tender and juicy. I added the ranch and garlic, mixed and froze it. Then I yawed and grilled when I was ready.

Family loved it! Tweaked the recipe a little bit by soaking chicken breast for 10 minutes in water (read this somewhere online.. Key to a moist chicken breast!) Then drained the water and added garlic powder, ranch, BBQ sauce, Worcester sauce, franks red, a hint of sweet onion dressing, pepper and salt. Baked in oven at about 410 for 45 minutes -  1hour. Kept the left over sauce to baste the chicken with periodically
Mmmmmm! So tender, so savory!

This recipe is delicious!  I made a few changes simply out of necessity.  I didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used parsley flakes and my grill was out of propane so I put the chicken (with all sauce/marinade) in a skillet and covered it and cooked it on medium heat until it was done.  The chicken turned out nice and moist and so flavorful!  I loved having the extra sauce as well.  All of my picky eaters ate this meal so I definitely give it a thumbs up!

This wasn't bad, I just didn't get much of the ranch flavor.  I was really hoping that it would come through more.  If I make this one again, I'll either leave to marinate overnight, or possibly rub with oil and a powedered ranch mix spice pack.

Sorry, but this chicken had almost no ranch flavor.  Since cooking this recipe for the last time, I've started cutting the chicken in cubes before marinating in regular ranch (so little dressing sticks to the chicken I don't think using fat free makes much of a difference), then sprinkling the chicken cubes with a ranch seasoning packet after threading them on skewers.  The chicken has much more flavor that way.

I'm a vegetarian but I made this for my boyfriend and it turned out great! I'm a fan of quick and easy meals, so I skipped refrigerating the battered chicken and instead of making a mess coating the chicken in a bag I just did it with a baster. :) I used the extra coating to baste the veggie burger I was having!

I goofed and made this 44 hours prior to grilling and it was tremendous! Yummy. I added a little Lawry's Garlic Salt and Lawry's Salt while grilling. Perfecto!

I used normal Ranch dressing and it was Absolutely Fantastic! I didn't have the time to marinade it for too long (only 40 minutes) but it was still amazing. All I can say that when it came off the grill the chicken was juicy, creamy and wonderful. Definitely a keeper! Made it last night and the family is requesting it again for supper tonight.

I HATE the taste of "Fat Free" ANYTHING, so I used regular ranch dressing powder mix - (ranch powder + milk + mayo).  I also used 1/3 TBSP of dried basil (instead of fresh) & had planned on cooking it all up that night, but something came up so it ended up sitting in a ziplock bag for about 20 hours.  And...OMG...PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE IT MARINATED FOR SO LONG...BUT THIS WAS OHHHHHHHH SOOOOOOOO TASTY.  Tangy...tasty....ohhhhhh.....yummm...  Will be making this easy recipe often!

I'm not a huge fan of ranch, but I needed a quick and easy chicken recipe using the ingredients I already had, so I decided to try it.  This recipe is so good and so easy.  I used Ken's ranch dressing and crushed garlic. I will be making this again.  Thanks!

It was ok.  I liked it because I already had all the ingredients and it was so easy to make. I baked it in the oven and it still turned out fine it just wasn't my favorite.  Even my boyfriend didn't care for it and he eats everything!

I bake this instead of grilling. I let it marinate in a 9x13 before baking. I just brush the ranch on the chicken. Super easy... hubby loves it =)

This recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  It would also be good leftovers on a sandwich or in a wrap :) MMMMM. I used organic ranch dressing from safeway, and minced garlic 2tsps. Marinated an hour. Cooked in pan with all the marinate in it. Yummy & easy!

This was a very tasty dish in my opinion.  I did not however use the fat free ranch that the recipe called for.  Instead, I used Hidden Valley Ranch (original) and since my local grocery store did not carry fresh basil, I ended up using basil leaves from the spice rack.  I'm sure there was a difference in taste because of these things, but it still turned out fantastic!  I'm sure this will be made again, especially when expecting company.  Thank you!

I made almost as directed. Used Regular ranch dressing 3 cloves garlic chopped and since i did not have fresh or dry basil i used about a tablespoon of mrs dash italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. I cooked on the george forman grill about 7 min added salt and pepper when it was finished. I was going to put extra ranch on the side to dip but it was perfect and didnt need anything more. I dont know why some people said it was bland. I will definatly make this again the kids and my hubby both loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe as is, but I made a few changes and now my fiancee requests this every week!  I rub poultry seasoning into the chicken first, then put it in the bag with ingredients, adding some extra garlic powder and extra basil. I marinade all day - about 8 hours and grill on the george foreman (takes about 10 mins/ea or less).  Served with bbq sauce and it's amazing! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe makes juicy chicken (mainly, I think, because I use a remote thermometer when I'm grilling and so didn't overcook it!) but, unfortunately, I couldn't taste the basil, garlic or ranch dressing at all when it came off the grill!  Maybe it's because I use mesquite lump charcoal and that overpowered the other flavors.  All that said, I reserved about half of the dressing mixture and we spooned it on some seasoned, fried potatoes I made as a side and in THAT application, it was great!

it was a really great dish. To add my own touch I put in some onion and I used garlic ranch dressing. I left the bone in as well wich made it very moist.

This is one of the best recipes I have come across in a long time! Is really easy to make, either the night before (marinade) or even just a half hour before...and tastes great each time we make it - everyone loves this one!

Very quick and easy to prepare and very tasty and moist!   Everyone loved it, from my husband to my six-year old son, who told me just before dinner that he usually "hates everything we have for dinner."  He cleaned his plate!

Delicious!  The ranch dressing makes the chicken very moist.  I marinated this for a couple of hours.

The best feature of this recipe is the
easy preparation.  Just mix the
common ingredients together, toss in the
fridge, and take it out when you need to cook it.  It was tasty and succulent.
