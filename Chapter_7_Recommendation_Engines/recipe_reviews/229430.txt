This is my wife's favorite meal!  The only changes I've made are to add 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms and one diced onion at the beginning, and saute them when the chicken goes in.  Great every time!

I just made this for my husband and me for dinner tonight and loved it. The rice had a lot of flavor with the almonds and green beans. The chicken was tender and flavorfull. All I did was add salt and pepper when I was cooking the chicken. This is a keeper for sure.

Skipped the italian dressing as our kids dislike anything "vinegar-y", seasoned chicken with oregano & sea salt. Also used chicken stock from the freezer instead of broth. Used leftover rice. No leftovers - H ate the beans but liked the chicken best, V was the opposite. Next time with broccoli? I liked that this recipe didn't use cream, soup, sour cream etc - did not need it.

Love it!  I added onion and mushrooms as suggested.  I didnâ€™t have green beans, so used frozen peas instead.  Yum!

We omitted green beans & had Lima beans on the side.  We like green beans, just not cooked in things.

This was a hit at our house. I added french style canned green beans and long grain brown rice. I did add just a bit more liquid since the rice had to boil a bit longer. My husband doesn't like almonds so I used pecans. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We really enjoyed this dish. The rice was delicious with the Italian dressing flavors. I used can green beans because that was what I had on hand. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic for extra flavor.
