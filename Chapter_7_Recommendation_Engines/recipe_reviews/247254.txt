Absolutely delicious!  I made just as written except I used Neufch√¢tel Cheese, which is 1/3 lower in fat than cream cheese. This is so hard to stop eating. You can eat it with the pie chips, crackers, pretzels or by itself.....it's addictive. Thanks Amy for a fantastic recipe!!

This was only ok. I did not care for the texture at all. And something about the flavors just didn't come together.

OH MY YUM! This was so good that I could just eat it all by myself with a spoon...which I almost did! The important thing is to get those apples nice and brown...like the color of French fries. This gave it a strong fried apple flavor. It took double the time for my apples to brown, but it was worth the wait. The browned butter gave it a nice deep flavor also. I made it exactly as written except I used fat free cream cheese which is probably why my dip isn't as fluffy and creamy looking as the Allrecipes photo. But it was still so VERY good!
