I liked this recipe very much ! I do not like reviews where everyone is changing what the ingredients are because that is not the recipe.

I have gotten recipes from All recipes almost every week for several years and this is the first review I have done. This is without a doubt the best soup I have ever had.  I made it exactly as it was written (I hate it when people review & give stars when they have changes it so much that it is not the same recipe)  Anyway, that said I changed nothing. I put some aside for my Mom but it was so good that I ended up eating mine and her's too. My bad. So thank you Jennifer for a wonderful soup recipe.

Loved this soup! I did use hot Italian turkey sausage out of the casing. I used 2 (15oz) cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano instead of the 2 (28oz)cans. I also added 4c of fat free low sodium chicken broth to this....how else is it a soup if there is no broth or liquid? I did add small diced carrots to the onion and celery and used a frozen bag of red, yellow and green peppers that were sliced, 2 medium zucchini and I added a can of drained and rinsed small white beans. Very hearty and delicious. I ate mine with red hot pepper flakes, pecorino romano and a few crunchy croutons. Thanks!

Recipe is great, added more seasoning, added feta cheese and used spicy Italian sausage and I found it too thick to be a soup so I added a bottle of beer which made it even better and more soup like. Awesome w/ some French bread

Used spicy Italian sausage, otherwise wouldn't recommend any changes on the recipe! So far I have created open-faced sandwich with a toasted sesame bun, mixed it with Orecchiette pasta, and as a soup with oyster crackers. Always with Parmesan cheese please! Made it on Monday night and ate great the whole week. Thank you Jennifer!

SO GOOD!!! Perfect for cold miserable days---its excellent comfort food.  I call this "pizza stew" because it has a lot of similar flavors.  I reviewed this the first time I made it and said that it was WAY too salty with the added salt--and I still think it would be too salty with the added salt.  The salt in the canned tomatoes and sausage links is more than enough.  I have been using Sprout's sweet Italian sausage links.  Lots of people have commented on how they think there won't be enough broth...just remember that you need TWO

Made it exactly to the recipe.  wonderful soup.  While cooking in crock pot it seemed like it was going to be very thick, almost like a stew, but by serving time consistency was perfect.  Smelled so good, husband was opening crock pot and "tasting" before it was done.

Loved this, but did do a few changes. I used the Italian sausage out of the casing, and all the other ingredients. I did add a box of vegetable broth from Trader Joes, which made it a soup rather than stew. And I added light red kidney bean, as well as a can of cannellini beans.  This soup had wonderful flavors and was visually appealing as well. A great family meal, or a perfect meal for guests.

Great soup!  My husband had 4 bowls, my young boys and mom loved it too!  Here's my changes: didnt have celery so i used celery flakes, seeds, celery salt instead.  3 oz tomato paste instead of tomatoes (might use more next time- tomato flavor wasnt detectable) about 2 cups homemade beef broth and 2 cups chicken broth, then another 4 cups at the end! (I don't like stew-like consistency). I didn't have green peppers. Subbed fresh basil because I had it (it added another texture too). I also threw in a little uncooked leftover penne pasta near the end. What I'd change: cook the onion on the pan first after the sausage. It might be my fault because the beef broth was frozen (I had to cook the soup longer) but my onions were still a little crunchy. It was ok and gave texture but not my best liking.  But like I said might not be the case when cooked according the recipe!  Still next time I'd sauté them first.

Very good as the recipe is written; it's more like a stew. The second time around I used fire roasted diced tomatoes, used yellow squash instead of zucchini, and added two cloves of minced garlic along with a teaspoon of course ground black pepper. When I sauted the meat and celery, I added a quarter cup of sherry to release all flavor trapped by the iron skillet. Poured it all in the pot. I also added a 12 ounce can of low sodium V-8 juice to make it a little soupier. Sliced some Italian bread to sop up the juice at the end and it was a tasty to the last bit.  Great for eating while watching a ballgame!

This was awesome!  I usually add seasonings to all my dishes.  I prepped this the night before and put it on the next day before work.  I came home expecting to modify it but it was perfect as is.  The blend of flavors is just perfect.  I'll definitely be making this often.  Thank you for a great way to enjoy my garden veggies!!

So long meatballs subs, hello zucchini heaven! Followed the recipe, except I used only 1 lb of bulk sweet Italian sausage (what I had on hand) and 6 cloves crushed, minced garlic in place of garlic powder (there's no such thing as too much garlic...) Personally, I feel that this recipe would be more appropriately used as sandwich filling. It makes for a very thick stew. First, I served it in bowls with some Italian bread on the side and halfway through the meal realized it was spectacular with the bread. The next day, I bought sub rolls and we had sandwiches for lunch... I will never go back to plain old meatball subs! The flavors were wonderful and it's packed with veggies!

Excellent! This delicious recipe is simple to make in the slow cooker, with chicken meatballs from Costco. It's been served weekly in my household since I discovered it and no one's complained yet.

I made this just before Thanksgiving, wanting something light yet comfort food like. I made it on the stovetop, just simmered for about 30 minutes. I left out the peppers and celery as I didn't have them on hand. I added small pasta shells and about 3/4 of a carton of beef stock. Served it with garlic cheese bread. It was soooo good! Will definitely be making it again. Perfect for rainy/snowy days. Thanks for the great recipe Jennifer!

After reading several reviews, here are the changes I made to this recipe:  I used hot Italian turkey sausage; I omitted the salt and sugar; and I added one can of low-sodium chicken broth.  Even with these changes, I still had a very thick soup, which could also double as a topping for pasta.  I think you could add an additional can of broth, a can of small red kidney beans, a can of Great Northern beans and a bit of pasta and have a great pasta fagioli!  That's what I love about Allrecipes--the way the community of cooks gets together, takes an idea, and runs with it!  Thanks for posting the recipe and opening a door to creativity!

Meh.  This soup just didn't excite me.  It wasn't bad, but I found myself looking for excuses to eat something else.  I always rate recipes as written, but I might add beans or pasta to this if I ever make it
 again as I felt like a flavor or texture was missing for me.

A new favorite in our house. My husband and I love this recipe! I left out the sausage and used a can of Progresso Roasted Tomato Recipe Starters and a can of regular tomato sauce in place of cans of diced tomatoes.

I made this for supper tonight and it was YUM!!! I followed the recipe as written, but when I got it all into the crock pot, it didn't appear like it had enough liquid, so I added two cans of beef broth & omitted the salt, which I hadn't yet added (glad I didn't!). It was a perfect consistency for us with the added broth. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder (personal preference). Served it with a lovely Italian bread & freshly shaved Parmesan. This was simply to die for. It will be making it into my permanent rotation. Thanks for this great recipe!

I used ground venison instead of sausage, that's just what I had.  I added some extra Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to accommodate the flavor.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and fresh garlic instead of powder, again I just had them around to use.  This was a very hearty and robust soup, it filled up both my husband and me with enough leftovers for another meal!  The flavors blend together very well!  I would definitely make this again!

This soup is amazing. I didn't slow cook it though, I sautéed all veggies except the zucchini for about 10 minutes after browning the sausage then I added everything else. I blended half of the tomatoes before adding them. And I added about 2 cups of chicken stock to the recipe to thin it out while adding two bouillon cubes and the flavor was still spot on. I also added fresh rosemary to it. I've made it this way before and doubled everything - and froze the leftovers which turned out just as good after frozen. This is now a staple in my family.

This is delicious and simple! Made it for my family & a neighbor who recently had knee surgery.
Before making it, I looked at the recipe and immediately cut the salt in less than half, figuring that the sausage adds a level of salt and spice. Glad I did, otherwise it would have been WAY too salty.  It was perfect with less! Thanks for this! Will make it again for sure!

Outstanding recipe!  I did substitute ground turkey for the sausage to reduce the fat/calorie content. I added 1/8 tsp of fennel.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was great. A definite keeper.

This soup was really good!  I pretty much stuck with the recipe except I used hot turkey sausage instead of sweet Italian.  I also did not saute the celery but just cooked the sausage and threw everything else in the slow cooker.  It made a very thick stew like soup and the spices made it very tasty.  Very healthy dish also which is always a plus.  Will make it again!

We do a soup day at work and it was my turn so I decided to make this soup. Followed recommendations from others and added chicken broth and carrots. I used half chicken style Italian sausage and half Italian sausage. I also omitted the salt but ended up adding some after it cooked a while along with some pepper. It was amazing. One of my coworkers brought spaghetti squash not realizing I was making soup so some of us had the soup over the squash and that was really good. Thank you for sharing.

Wow, this tasted absolutely wonderful!! Only made a few adjustments due to availability.  Had no celery, only had one green pepper.  Also used apple sausage instead of italian sausage.  But the taste is superb!!  A little salty, but that is easily adjusted.  This is a definite keeper!

Made this recipe for our Christmas get together. I have never made a pot of successful soup, sad I know. I was designated to make the soup and luckily I picked this recipe. It was wonderful. Everyone love love loved it! We have a restaurant and I do believe we will make this for our customers. It was thick and I did add chicken broth as suggested in other comments but other than that I didn't change a thing.

The first time I made this it would not fit my slow cooker.  So I made it stovetop, simmering for about 2 hrs.  It turned out fabulous!  Trying it tonight using chicken sausage and some spicey pepper seeds.  More to come.

I simmered this in a stockpot with a lid instead of the slow cooker since I don't have one. I used 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I used fresh tomatoes and added a little water(not too much).  I skipped the Italian seasoning.  I used part yellow bell pepper instead of all green. I also cut the zucchini a little finer than the picture shows. Next time I will probably try a less spicy sausage.

This dish is phenomenal.  It has gone on regular rotation at my house.  I didn't change a thing, made it exactly as described, and my family can't get enough.  They even look forward to left over night.  Ok, so if you are on the fence and aren't sure...  do it!  You won't be disappointed and your family will love you for this dish.

I made just as the instructions said and am delighted with this delicious soup. What a great way to use all sorts of summer squash and other fresh vegetables. And this was also very easy to throw together. The ease of making and the great result are why I'm writing this, my first review! Thanks for this recipe. I'll definitely make it again.

wonderful soup although it came out more like a stew.  My wife cannot tolerate any cayenne or other hot items.  She had seconds and had to control herself for going back for 3rds.  My 15 yr old gave it a 9.5 rating.

This is such a flavorful dish! I made it with smoked turkey sausage but it didn't get that crumbly feeling so next time I want to use sweet Italian sausage as called for. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a delicious soup as is! For the second time making it, I  added a chicken boullion cube for a little more flavor, a half a pound more of the sausage and subbed Rotel for the diced tomato. YUM and thank you!

I've made it according to the recipe and it was really good, but I like things a little spicier and meatier, so when I made it again, I used 1lb. of sweet italian sausage and 1lb. of hot italian sausauge and it turned out suiting my taste buds perfectly! That's the nice thing about this recipe; it's great on its own, but it's also very forgiving if you want to adjust things to suit your tastes!

Very flavorful soup. I omitted the salt and it was still good. It wasn't as brothy as I like so I added some vegetable juice. And I didn't have a lot of time so I just cooked it on the stove top for about an hour - still yummy!

This was such a delicious and fresh soup.   Almost all of these vegetables I have in my garden. I will definitely make this again.   I did only slightly change a few things.  I really wanted this to stretch for 2 meals for my large family.   I added a can of red kidney beans,  2 cups of beef broth and per other reveiws cut the salt to one tsp.  It was sooo good everyone had seconds.

It was very good!  The recipe filled my 4 qt. slow cooker almost to overflowing. If you increase any of the ingredients, be sure your cooker will safely hold it all. Will make again.

I suggest *not* cooking the celery with the meat. Just add it to the crock pot with everything else. That way it adds a good crunch.  Secondly, use a *large* crock pot, or halve the recipe. As written, the ingredients didn't fit in mine!

This soup is delicious! The only change I made was to swap out the pork sausage for Italian turkey sausage to keep the fat content down. This is a keeper!!!

I added about 3 cups of chicken broth only to make it more of a soup.  I served it to guests who asked for the recipe.  My husband raved about,  he said it was the best soup I had ever made and I make soups often enough.  I could not find Italian sweet sausage in the nearest town (or I would not have substituted)  so I used Italian pork sausage.  Still awesome!!

Read a review saying this was too salty, so I used one teaspoon of salt instead of two. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly, and wow, this will be one of our regular dinners :)

This soup was FANTASTIC!  I made few minor changes, I fried the sausage & celery at the same time using poultry sausage and did not remove the casing, so I sliced the sausage in 1 1/2 inch slices.  Added 3 cups of chicken broth as the soup was very thick and I wanted to achieve soup constancy. Then followed the recipe as it is stated.  This is great to be served in cold Winter days with crusty bread and a glass of vino.  Thank you so much for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I ate the soup up in three days and went right back to the grocery for more ingredients to make another batch!  The only thing I change was to add fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, and added chicken stock.  This soup will definitely be a staple in my kitchen.

An excellent soup with lots of flavor. Made According to recipe. The  additions were 1bottle of dark beer (for more liquid) and can of drained cannelloni beans.  Also, I did use hot Italian chicken sausage from Sprouts, less fat . 
Served with hot sour dough.  My family loved the soup.  
Thanks for sharing and it is a keeper.

This is a winner! I followed the recipe according to the AllRecipes Magazine instructions, so I only used 1 pound of sausage (my husband said it wasn't enough, will use 1 1/2 next time) and I reduced the salt to ONE teaspoon, as the magazine suggested. It was perfect. My entire family loved it. It is a bit of prep work cutting up all the veggies, but once that it done, you can forget about it and come home to a hearty soup at the end of the day. This will be great in winter, but I also appreciated having a new recipe to try with all the zucchini in the garden this summer. Thank you!

This so was so good. My husband raved about it for days and even took it to work for lunch, which was a first. This recipe must have been for a large crock pot because I had to cook it in two batches. I did add broth as others did to make it more soupy, although it was still very thick.

My husband couldn't stop eating this!! We don't eat much meat, so I did change the recipe a little. I only used 1/2 of a 20 oz. package of turkey Italian sausage & added some cannelloni beans. I also added chicken broth (in place of some of the tomatoes) to make it a little soupier. I will definitely add this to my soup collection. Thank you!

I made this very close to the recipe. My changes were in amounts of ingredients, not type. Used 1 lb. Italian sausage, 1 1/2 cups celery, 3 cans no salt tomatoes, 1 can salted, and no extra salt. Wonderful flavor! Next time I will either use a spicier Italian sausage or more of the spices, at least more garlic and a little black pepper. For me, a little celery goes a long way, but in this it adds so much.

This is your basic minestrone start up.  It was easy & good, but think it was really because of our homemade Italian Sausage from this site.  I would make this again since we don't always want the beans & other ingredients with minestrone soup.

Love, love, love this soup.  With our homegrown zucchinis it is awesome.  Very flavorful.  My family can't get enough of it. Already recommended it to friends.  Took some to neighbor and she loved I too.

Very good! We used yellow pepper in place of green and slightly less zucchini - maybe 1.5 pounds. Ate it with crusty bread and it was hearty!

Made it pretty much as the receipe called for.  Absolutely love this soup. I'm definitely not the type of person who requires soup to be brothy, I love the uncommon texture and consistency of this dish.

Fantastic soup! I used a combination of sliced links and ground sausage, added fresh mushrooms and crooked neck yellow squash which added flavor  and color. I’m going to cook this again!

It was delicious! I didn’t have white sugar so I used brown and I actually had to use about 3.5 tsp because I accidentally put a whole tsp of garlic powder instead of 1/4. It was great though, not too garlicky not too sweet. Amazing flavor and super simple to make.

I made this ahead of time,  froze it and let the crockpot work on it all day.  I did cut the vegetables in bigger chunks.  There was plenty of liquid to use as soup.  I decided to serve with rice.  Daughter and husband gave it thumbs up and do it again.

Awesome use of summer vegetables.  Along with the sausage, I also used Moose sausage.  This will allow anyone wanting to use moose sausage or burger will be able to see that it works, and is d”delicious.So in essence I changed the recipe somewhat.  This recipe will allow you to be as creative with your seasoning, and vegetables as you like. Now I am going to see how it freezes!!! Thank you for such a great recipe.

Yum,yum,yum.  Made it exactly like it said.  It is so good.  I made it for family and my father-in-law wants the recipe.  When I brought leftovers to work everyone thought it smelled so good they want the recipe.  Get a good, fresh Italian sausage.  I got mine right from the meat case at the butchers where they had just made it up.  That’s the best!

As I do not like Italian sausage at all, I did switch that out for ground turkey, which I browned and drained before adding to the slow cooker.  Also added a can of diced tomatoes with mild chiles for a little extra zip.  My hubby and I LOVE this soup ~ it's one of my favorites!  When my garden is full of zucchini in the summertime, I make several batches of this and freeze for the winter months!  Thank you!

I've made this several times before twice for soup dinners and it goes over real well. The guys especially like it! I've put it on a hoagie roll with mixed Italian cheese it was excellent !

Oh man. This was soooooo good!!! I’m a big fan on making zero changes, otherwise it becomes a different recipe but I did add beef broth to this.  This soup is def a stew so I added a few cups of beef broth to make it soupy.  Other than that, wow! Everyone had at least 2 bowls. Def making this a part of my rotation.

Just made this yesterday. First it was really delicious. I made some changes,I used 1.5 lbs of the sausage but used the hot italian sausage and 1/2 recipe for the vegetables but full amount for the seasonings. I slow cooked for 6 hours. The liquid from the vegetables was just enough to make  it soupy.Very good with parmesan and a roll or any kind of bread.Will make again.

I made this exactly as written with one small exception. I added a little red peppers flakes. It would have been just as good without them. My family just likes things with a little kick. This is a family favorite and a great low calorie meal.

Wow—thank you so much for sharing this scrumptious recipe. I made it exactly as directed and it is delicious! Healthy, flavorful, hearty comfort food and couldn’t be easier.  Great with or without the Parmesan cheese on top. Will definitely be making again—including for guests.

My family loved it! Didn’t make any changes but next time I’ll probably just use 1 lb of sausage to make it even more affordable. I used frozen chopped onion/peppers and it turned out fine.

I made this as written and really liked it! Next time I'll add spicy sausage and maybe a 1/4 lb. less zucchini. The spices were great, I loved the thicker stew-like consistency and will definitely be making this again.

I needed this to be Soup as I made it for my 90 year old parents so I added 2 cups Chicken Stock and decreased the tomatoes by 1/4 (used three 14.5 oz cans). I did everthing else the same and my parents and other family members loved this.

This was a nice and delicious soup to have for dinner on Thursday night .  I've made some changes to the recipe: since I didn't have any green peppers, I've use mini red and orange peppers which worked out quite well. I've also used Sweet Italian turkey sausage too. It came out pretty good on top of rice.

combined these ingred with Summer Zucchini Stew by Chris Miller. Family loved it!!
I substituted turkey sausage to lower the fat content. Then added the spices for Italian sausage from Allrecipes.

Woweee!!! This is a great recipe! Very flavorful. My only change was to use home grown tomatoes, blended up, instead of canned tomatoes. I was afraid it would be a bit runny, so I added 2 T cornstarch mixed with a little cold water. Perfect!!! My 3 teenage boys and husband happily finished their bowls.

Listen, this is DELICIOUS, so it deserves a 5 star rating. But here's the thing: it simply isn't soup..  When it says to serve it over rice or noodles, that's because it's more like a spaghetti sauce! When I was finished putting everything in the slow cooker I said to myself "wait, this isn't soup, there isn't any stock..." So I added a bit of beef stock, but not much. When it was finished, it still didn't resemble soup, and I didn't realize why until my husband tasted it and said "this tastes like a MEAN spaghetti sauce, we should put the leftovers on noodles." My husband makes amazing spaghetti sauce that I usually can't compete with, until now. This is just as good. But again, it's more of a spaghetti sauce than a soup, so the title is misleading. Regardless, it was delicious! And I will definitely make it again.

Excellent.  Healthy and delicious.  It’s perfect or can be modified based on ingredients on hand, diet, or preference.   I put half on noddles and kept the other half as a soup/stew.

I 100% recommend this recipe! So delicious and last for days! The only things I did differently were I used 2 teaspoons of all seasonings (minus the sugar) added turkey Italian sausage (for health reasons), and lastly added about 1/4c of water just so I could cover my zucchini. Other than that kept the recipe the same. This will definitely be made again in my house!

Yummy.  I stuck closely to the recipe except that I took it into a Southwestern direction, mostly because I had an avocado that I wanted to use.  I cut up the avocado and used it as a garnish.  I changed the seasoning of the soup just a little bit by using fresh minced garlic, and by adding ground cumin instead of the Italian seasoning, chipotle pepper, and a bit of picante sauce that needed to be used.

This was delicious. I didn't have sausage so I used ground beef and added more seasoning. Also threw in a can of cannellini beans for good measure. A generous slice of hearty bread on the side and it was a satisfying meal!

Delicious. Hearty. I only had 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes. I remembered I had fresh green tomatoes cut up in my  freezer. I whipped them out & threw them in the slow cooker. Result: outstanding.

I had frozen zucchini from last summer's garden harvest to use up, and this seemed promising.  Everyone actually enjoyed it, and my kids don't really like zucchini that much.  It would probably be even better with the fresh zucchini.

Delicious! I personally took my favourite spicy sausage and use the meat inside for my soup. Amazing recipe and easy to add your own touch! Two thumbs up all the way!

i added fresh grated parmesano/romano  cheese.  I felt like there was too much tomato in the soup.  Next time i will substitute broth for one can of tomatoes.

I made 1/2 recipe a few days ago and now bringing it to my 88 yr old dad who I only bring good stuff.  Amazing flavor - no rice or noodles added.  I think I prefer it straight.  Not a real soup/has limited juice and I think I like that too.  I used regular sausage first time thinking I couldn't find Italian ground and stumbled on it in Wal-Mart so picked it up for this batch.  It was great before and I bet it will be as great or better this time.  I probably used extra onion, a big bell pepper - but it was exact recipe described.  Seems really healthy.  However, I ate and ate and couldn't get full.  Maybe the rice would help with that.  Also, this time I am bringing some good Artisan bread - which may do the job.

We will definitely make this again! So tasty and so satisfying. I didn’t have as many canned tomatoes as the recipe called for and subbed a 15 oz can of tomato sauce for a 15 oz can of tomatoes but it forgave me and was excellent anyway! Didn’t use sugar, have had good luck with Splenda as a stand in and it didn’t fail me this time either. It’s thick, almost a stew ...but whatever you choose to call it it’s awesome and feels like it’s merely a bonus that it is good for you too!

This came out pretty well. It was a lot of tomatoes for my taste and not enough zucchini. Otherwise it was great.

I have made this soup many many times. It is my “go to” soup for larger groups and always gets compliments. It is also fairly low carb if you are interested in that.. For just the two of us, I make half a recipe and it makes two meals. I make it on the stovetop, simmering on low for a couple of hours. I find I need more liquid and add beef broth which I make with the jarred concentrate like Tone’s from Sam’s. Using beef broth, I skip the salt in the recipe. I use frozen zucchini from my summer garden. I just cubed that all extra zucchini we couldn’t use or give away and put it in the freezer. Works great in this recipe even months later.

Outstanding recipe! 
I coarse grated the zucchini and also cooked sweet red peppers, minced onion and garlic with the sausage and celery. I added a pint of chicken broth to make it a bit less thick. I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage. Changes made were to my tastes, recipe is a total winner as is !!

I think I made a couple of mistakes along the way but it still turned out great.
I took it with me to work for lunch and it was very filling.
I'm a newbie to the slow cooker So this was perfect for me to start off with.
Thank you

I think this might be my favorite new soup and that's saying something because I'm crazy about soup!  I did add more of the same herbs,  a 14 oz can of tomato sauce but less chopped tomato,  a diced jalapeños , 2 cups of chicken stock, about 1 cup of shredded carrots, and a can of drained white kidney beans.   I didn't add any cheese but did put a dollop of fat free Greek yogurt on top when served.   It was perfect!   Oh, I didn't add the salt but substituted several grinds of lemon pepper.   My sausage was Italian chicken.   Thank you!

This recipe was easy to follow and included ingredients that we like and that I typically have on hand.  I served it over corkscrew pasta, which really grabbed and held the various ingredients and broth.

The only changes I made was that I added a little water for a soupier consistency, as I knew I'd be serving over pasta, and I did not add onions, as one family member does not care for cooked onions.  I did serve diced fresh onion on the side for topping, which worked fine for the rest of us.

Really good soup on a cold winter day! Hubby said it's "hearty" and went back for seconds, so this will definitely be one I make again. Only changes I made: cut the salt in half and had to add broth to make it more like a soup. Yummy!

I loved this soup! I did use turkey Italian sausage,  and I added one cup of chicken broth. Other than that I made it as written and it's really good. I had to use my large crock pot for this recipe.

This was so delicious!  i doubled the recipe for a big post-Christmas family gathering.  It wouldn't fit in my slow cooker, so I put it in a large roasting pan in the oven at 275 degrees for 5 or 6 hours.  Turned out great!

I thought it could have used a bit more oomph.  It's not a bad base to start with. I think next time I will add some potatoes and experiment with this one.

This soup is delicious, the longer it sets, the better it gets!!!  We ate the first go-around from the original recipe, I put a can (or 2) of well drained kidney beans in for the second go-around  - it was YUMMY!!!!

This soup is delicious.  But if I make it again I'll do a better job of draining the fat.

This was great! Just 2 things to watch out for... as was mentioned in some other reviews..be careful of the salt..depending on what sausage you use it could be too much... I ended up adding 1/2 the salt before cooking because the turkey sausage crumble I used seemed salty... at the end, I didn't need to add any more because of that...also...be careful of the slow cooker pot size... there is a lot of zucchini etc... to cook down and it almost didn't fit in my cooker. Otherwise, it was great and I would definitely make it again.

This soup turned out great! Substituted hot sausage for sweet and some carrots since I didn’t have enough celery. Served with a small baguette. Quite hearty lots of flavors and textures.

Can’t. Stop. Eating! This is one of the best soups I’ve found on AllRecipes! It’s so chock full of flavor!! If you want to lower the fat you can substitute turkey sausage but I would only sub half since the there is so much flavor added with the pork sausage. I did keep to the recipe except adding 4 cups chicken broth which, for the record, I’m surprised isn’t in the ingredients since it is called a soup.  Soooo good! Add this to your fall/winter recipe collection! WORTH IT!

pretty good stuff. I made the mistake of not cutting my zucchini thick enough and they fell apart. I also added a jalapeno but it still wasn't too spicy. next time I think I'll add maybe 3.

I like thick, hearty soups, so I threw quite a few extras at this recipe. Added, kale, fennel, mushrooms, eggplant, 1/2 cup red wine, and used 1/4 cup maple syrup rather than sugar. 

Let it cook for an extra hour on high, uncovered to reduce.

Will absolutely be making this again.

I followed this recipe exactly and the soup turned out delicious! My only alteration was the cook time. I had to cook it on high for 5 hours to get all the veggies to soften. When I made this again I will sauté the onions before adding them to the pot, that should help reduce the cook time and add flavor. Another plus, is this soup tastes even better the next day!

Loved this!
After reading some other reviews, I did add the 1/4 cu of sherry to the sausage/celery mixture. I did use spicy Italian sausage because my family likes some spice. I also did add 3 cups of chicken broth to the crockpot - again because we like some extra broth.  It was a big hit and will become part of the regular rotation.

I made the recipe exactly as written, however, I needed to add about 3 cups of chicken stock to make it a soup!  How can this be listed as a soup recipe without adding any liquid??  So, please add either chicken broth or chicken stock to your soup to actually make it soup!  I’d say roughly 3-4 cups, depending on your taste and size of your crockpot.  I would definitely make this again...had great flavor but I was definitely taken back that adding a liquid was not mentioned in the original recipe.

Well, I'm not feeling the love.  It's mostly just canned tomatoes with some sausage and zucchini. There is nothing exceptional about this soup, and  so I just don't understand all the five star reviews.

I have made this recipe numerous times during zucchini season when my harvest is more than I can use fresh.  I've made it for many guests and they have all LOVED it, asking me for the recipe.  I think I've reprinted it three times to give out.  I do not change anything about it, but use mostly all fresh veggies and it turns out perfect every time.

My husband does not like zucchini but he loves this. We did add some additional spices because we found it a little mild for our taste. Spicy Italian sausage would also help.

I made this pretty close to the recipe (depending on what was in the kitchen) and it was delicious! Others in my home had it as soup, I followed some reviewers' suggestions and had some on a (ciabatta) bun. Great both ways; already looking forward to lunch tomorrow.

The whole family loved it.  I didn't add any extra salt and still thought it was too salty. The italian turkey sausage I used must have had a high salt content.

Used no salt. Good flavor, but really just spicy vegetable soup, I think. I used home canned tomatoes, spicy Italian sausage, therefore i did not use hot peppers.

No changes except used spicy Italian sausage.  Came out rather bland.  Maybe needed more spices.

Yum yum! Such a hearty flavorful soup with lots of different textures. Perfect way to use up zucchini from our garden. I made a few small tweaks based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I only used one bell pepper (ended up being plenty), used 3 cloves of garlic rather than garlic powder, added 2-3 cups of low sodium chicken stock, and reduced the salt to one teaspoon based on a review saying it was too salty. Without the stock it wasn’t very soupy, so IMO it needed it. But that was it- everything else was exactly as the recipe stated. I loved this soup, my husband loved it, I can’t wait to have leftovers!

I pretty much made this to the recipe.  I bought canned whole tomatoes instead of crushed so I used a combination of canned whole tomatoes, tomato sauce, and a little water.  I made it in my pressure cooker so I was able to sauté the sausage in there before slow cooking.  I decided after awhile slow cooking it that I should just put the instant pot on the stew setting.  In 50 minutes it was done and all the veggies were cooked through.  I’m going to make it again.  It was a good way to use the extra vegetables I had on hand.

Loved the flavor. Only added 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce per family's preference. Also threw in 1 cup small pasta. Probably now my favorite zucchini recipe!

Delicious soup! I did cook it on the stovetop only because the lid to my crock pot recently broke &  I haven’t replaced it yet. Also I did add a carton of no sodium chicken broth & used  sweet Italian chicken sausage. Served with Ditalini pasta and crusty bread. I will be adding this recipe to my fall/winter soup rotation for sure!

This was awesome!  I grow zucchini and every summer I look for ways to use it.   I had a few  mushrooms that needed to be used up so I threw those in too.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I left out the salt.  Great recipe!   It is my new favorite way to use up my zucchini.

It was a little salty so I recommend eliminating the salt and getting salt free diced tomatoes. Other than that I loved it.

Love this soup.  I make it as the recipe says minus the salt. I even use “no salt” canned tomatoes.  You get enough salt in the sausage. Easier to add a shake to your own bowl when serving than have something too salty to enjoy.

The first time I made this I went exactly by recipe and instructions. The second time I did not have time for slow cooker so I cooked on stove top.  When combining all ingredients I added 4 cups chicken broth (slow cookers create more liquid that you can't get on stove top), brought to a boil then lowered to simmer for one hour. PERFECT! both ways! I will add small sea shell pasta for left overs.

My hat's off to the chef, this was excellent. When draining the sausage, I also rinsed it lightly. I was worried it would lessen the taste; however, the taste was fantastic so I can't imagine it tasting better. 

The tomatoes I used were both canned and frozen from my garden. To thicken it up, I added about 3/4 of a 6 oz can of tomato paste. I also had asparagus on hand so I added it as well. I did not add salt but I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes and it gave it an extra but mild kick. We like garlic, so I added two minced cloves. The oregano and basil I added were dried from my garden last summer.

I grated fresh Parmesan cheese to top and it was delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

UPDATE: I use San Marzano whole plum tomatoes the second time and crushed them. No need to thicken up (I used home growns last time). I also used ground pork and made my own seasonings to spice it up, so much better than store bought Italian sausage!

This soup is delicious. I only used 1 large can of tomatoes and about 2 cups of chicken stock. I didn’t want so much tomato. I also used fresh garlic instead of powder. We love it.

This is a delicious soup! My family loved it.  It's a hearty soup alone but my daughter put it over pasta.  I will definitely be making it again.

Super good and easy. Only thing different is I added a teaspoon of Stevia instead of sugar and added a can of chicken broth. Also it was to salty so next time I make I will skip the salt.

Done it three times now - very flavourful and hearty. For health reasons i didn't want  to add salt or sugar, so i went with hot Italian sausage instead of sweet and omitted the salt and sugar (don't drain the oil, that's where the spices live). Very tasty, had a nice zing to it that is perfect for a cold winter evening without being too hot.  There's a lot of fairly complex flavour going on and it certainly surprised me. Very easy prep too. I couldn't find sausage meat so we just bought  hot Italian breakfast sausages and cut the casings and took the meat out.

I prepared this exactly by the recipe - at first. That's where the 4 stars comes from. Then I had to add some liquid to thin it so it would be a soup. Also, we thought the 56 oz. of tomatoes to be overkill, and we found the celery to be overpowering as it really didn't seem to fit the other flavors well. Maybe 2 cups is too much? But that said, I will definitely make this again with a few minor changes. Very, very good!

So good! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for with the tiny exception of doubling the garlic out of personal preference.  Everyone in the house loved it! Warning though - it will look like there is no liquid for the first few hours but don't panic.  It comes out perfect in the end.

I think that I would title this "Tomato stoup", sorta' soup, sorta' stew. I made it just as the recipe was written. It sounded delicious, all the elements were there, somehow it missed the mark for me. It needed more fluid, to be a soup, probably beef broth, considering the use of Italian sausage. The domination of the tomatoes was too much for my taste, not complex enough. I think I will serve the leftovers on some pasta with a salad and crusty bread and red wine.

The flavor was good, but I had to add many hours to the cooking time, as I wanted the zucchini to be cooked until soft.  I had to cook it 6 hrs on high to achieve this.

This is great. Really good. I rarely make changes to recipes the first time I tried it, but I ended up adding about 28 ounces of chicken stock and used only half the tomatoes based on others comments. I also put in a sprinkle of red pepper. Everything else remained the same and it is fantastic. My 6 year old is slurping it down. Served over this egg noodles.

I was skeptical as my pot was practically overflowing and there didn't seem to be much liquid. But it was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use a combination of hot Italian and Chorizo sausage because that is what I had. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I both loved it. Thank you Jennifer for a great, hearty soup.

This soup is delicious! I did not make any changes other than using 4 pounds of fresh tomatoes  from my garden instead of the canned and maybe a little extra garlic! There is plenty of liquid from the zucchini so I didn't add any other liquid. Great with breadsticks  or garlic bread and a salad.

Very delicious. I made it as written except I used red and yellow peppers instead of green (don't like them). And I used zucchini and yellow squash. My husband loved it so much, he ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the next day. I think this will be requested often.

I will definitely make this dish again.  It's good with pasta or rice but best with no fillers.  The Parmesan cheese adds the perfect kick to this dish. Good for a snow day.

As I was making this it was so  simple I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  I appreciated the heads up about the salt from other reviewers because I like to share meals with my elderly parents, one of whom, needs to watch their salt intake.   I added no additional salt, used one 28oz can of basil chopped tomatoes and the other can was no additional seasonings and "no salt added."  I thought the flavor was perfect and needed no added salt. I think the sausage provides enough.  I left out the celery because I don't like it.   I used 2lbs. of sausage because it was packaged in 1lb. packages and I wanted more, rather than less.  I also cut the zucchini into halves and quarters just because I wanted it to be more bite sized.   I added fresh basil and Italian flat leaf parsley just because I had it and I wanted to use it up.   The consistency came out to be a hearty soup and it was quite tasty.   I think I'd like to make it with ground turkey sometime just to make it a little more healthy.   I would recommend this recipe for anyone who needs something easy to come home to in their crock pot that is relatively healthy.  You could also add carrots or whatever suits your taste.

Spoiler alert to those who don't like people who make changes to recipes and then rate them.
I used hot Italian sausage instead of sweet,  I did not add the sugar and based on other reviews, I added only one teaspoon of salt.  I'm guessing the sugar is to cut the tomato acid, but my husband is a diabetic and doesn't need any added sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  We loved it.  A little spicy for my husband so will probably use sweet sausage next time.  Everyone else I let try it loved it.  (Daughter, granddaughter (she had two bowls of it!!)).

I made this in my Instant Pot pressure cooker. Sauté setting browned the sausage, then added all ingredients plus some mushrooms. I hit the soup setting and it was done in 30 minutes. So very good! Bought the ingredients to make it again!

Delicious soup! I bought spicy Italian sausage from TJ's in 1lb packages. I adjust the recipe to use 2lbs and made a big batch for 2 people, lol. I used 5 lbs of my home grown and canned tomatoes. Forgot to buy celery so I used celery salt in place of regular salt. It still turned out tasty. We served the soup with garlic bread. Saved half in freezer. Will have to make this again with celery.

We loved it just as it is. No changes required! We did use our own homemade stewed tomatoes.  The tomatoes were from our garden. We also make them in our slow cooker, then freeze in individual bags of 2 cups each. Works out great!

Absolutely delicious!  My family went back for seconds, even the kiddos!  I used ground pork sausage in lieu of ground Italian sausage, as I couldn't find any in the grocery store. Worked out great!

I made this just as the recipe states except  I wanted it to have liquid as a soup so I did add 3 cups of beef broth.  Add broth or not, this recipe is delicious!  We have loved every spoonful.  Thank you for posting this easy but delicious recipe.

The consistency of this delicious chunky soup is a meal in itself.  I used hot Italian sausage and it was  a big hit.  Next time I will use mild Italian sausage.  Also used garden fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Since I don't have a slow cooker, I simmered on stove 3 hours.

This is a hearty stew like concoction that tastes like spaghetti sauce.  I avoid rice and pasta and plan on having this on spaghetti squash.  It would make a great base to a pasta sauce.  I thought about adding mushrooms and grated carrots for a thick and chunky sauce. Tastes great!

Excellent recipe! The tomatoes cook down to make a lovely saucy "broth". I used spiral cut zucchini (zoodles) so I waited toward the end of the cooking process to add them so they wouldn't get mushy due to the thinness of the cut.

Great recipe and great way to use all that zucchini that comes at once. Shared it with family and they really enjoyed it. I thought you could add some kind of pasta to it, but was really good without it. Carol

My diced tomatoes were already seasoned, so I didn't need as much of the herbs as called for. We both loved it and it was better the next day! I will definitely make it again!

Very delicious soup.  The neighbors enjoyed it.  However, my  husband, not so much, since he doesn't particularly care for zucchini.

I made this soup today...and it is delicious.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  The only thing I would caution is that this recipe makes a lot of soup and for just 2 people I would cut this recipe in half.  Thank you for a very tasty recipe.

The soup turned out wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.  I substituted fresh red and yellow tomato for one of the 28 ounce cans and added some Brussels sprouts and carrots.  I let it cook for 10 hours in the crock pot.   I served it for lunch with garlic cheese croutons on top along with the Parmesan cheese.

I loved this recipe, but I omitted the celery because I don't like it. I traded diced tomatoes with organic fire roasted diced tomatoes and it was so yummy!!!!

I will make this again. I didn't use sausage because I can't eat it but used chicken. I used fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried and added green beans from the garden. The flavor great and we ate the whole pot in 2 days.

We made this soup August 16-2017 and absolutely loved it.  It makes a large slow cooker full.  We used 3/4 lb. of hot Italian sausage and 3/4 lb. of mild.  We also used a few garlic cloves chopped fine in addition to the garlic salt.  This is an outstanding recipe and will definitely make again and again.

This was an easy-to-make, yummy recipe. It is a bit salty though - but not overwhelmingly so. Next time, I'm putting either only one teaspoon or half a teaspoon of salt in it, and let others salt to taste if they so desire. I followed the recipe as listed, except for a  few things: As I made my grocery list, I didn't notice that it required bell peppers, so I  didn't have any and made the dish without it. I decided that I was going to use diced tomatoes with green chiles - so when I saw I didn't have bell peppers I just went with it. That possibly could have helped the salt. Also, I didn't cook the celery with the italian sausage. I wanted the water from the celery to add to the soup, and I felt cooking the celery before doing that would dry it out before it got the chance to properly contribute to the soup's texture. 

This is definitely a recipe I'm keeping in my back pocket, especially as the months turn colder. Thanks!

I followed the recipe just as written and it turned out great! I didn't even have to add additional salt or pepper. I did start it a little late in the day, so I cooked it on high in my old slow cooker, and it was plenty done in 4hrs. My hubby and children all gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely be adding this into my favorites! Thanks!

This is in the crockpot cooking on High, and has been for almost 4 hrs.  The veggies are still a bit crunchy.  I have a 4 quart 'old school' crockpot.  I followed recipe except for using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and used 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, and 2 14oz cans petite diced tomatoes.  I reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Taste is delicious!!  Absolutely tasty!  Only problem is my crockpot is filled to the brim, can hardly stir  for fear it will overflow.  That may be why it's taking so long to cook on High!  Because this is like a stew, I'm contemplating using this over pasta tonight.  That will free up space in the crockpot to add some chicken or beef broth, and have soup tomorrow night!  I recommend you give it a try if you like all the ingredients--then decide how your family will prefer it.  Like two different meals in one!

My family loves soup.  This is a wonderful recipe -- made excellent use of a large zucchini!  I did make a few adjustments based on personal preference, and also to save myself a trip to the store.  I used 1 lb. ground chicken Italian sausage.  Since I was 1/2 lb. short on sausage, I added one 15 oz. can of drained/rinsed cannellini (white kidney) beans.  I only had one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes on hand, so I sub'd the second 28 oz. can with smaller can of diced tomatoes + a cup or so of chicken broth.  I used 2-3 cloves of chopped fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder.  The dried seasonings called for in the recipe made for wonderful flavor.  I started with 1 t. of salt, planning to add more if needed.  I thought it was seasoned very well, didn't end up adding more.  Served with parmesan cheese as suggested, and warm french bread.
 
FYI -- I started this soup in my 4 qt. slow cooker before realizing it wasn't going to fit.  I transferred it to my 6 qt. enameled cast iron pot on the stove top and set the burner to the lowest setting.  I let it simmer for an hour or so, shut it off, then turned it back on again about 30 minutes before dinner.

Great soup. I omitted the salt as some suggested and added a can of low sodium chicken broth to give it a more soup than stew effect. I was short on time so cooked it on high for 2 hours and it turned out perfectly. My husband loved it.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was pretty good. I used 1/2 tsp of salt (some people preferred to add a little more to their bowl) and sweet turkey sausage because that's what was purchased for me. I really liked this as a soup and mine had plenty of liquid from the canned diced tomatoes.

Great easy soup for the crockpot!  Only modification I made was  using crushed tomatoes instead of diced (cause that's what I had on hand) and it was great....it was thicker so I added a little water, but it still came out a thicker consistency- which I loved!  You could also serve this thicker version over noodles as spaghettti alternative!   Love all the veggies in it and will make it again!

Followed the recipe and had to "improvise" with the Italian Seasoning. Cayenne got added as part of my improvisation and it's spicy goodness! I forgot to add the parmesan when serving. I think the extra salt from that would have been too much anyway.

It was OK. Nothing special. The sausage made the dish.

Made this many times just like the recipe and also with different veggies. I just made it on the stove as well and it’s always delicious. One of my favorite recipes!! I use HEB Italian sausage. The mild flavor. It has no nitrates and very little salt so I add some pink sea salt when I make this.

I Used Spicy Italian Sausage Instead Of The Regular. It Really Made The Soup That Much Better.

The zucchini was just complete mush by the time it was ready. I would suggest throwing it in halfway through if you want some kind of texture to your soup.

Also, there's no need to add broth. The fats and juices will heat up and full the pot at some point. It's a lot more like a roast than a soup with all the fats. But if you insist on making it more brothy, I fully understand.

Wow, this soup is outstanding! I made it last night to eat for the week with a salad and portion control on this one was a tough one! :P I added in green pepper and some extra garlic with a little excess on the seasoning (I don't measure I just pour what looks right). To add some fillers to it I will add in some noodles when I serve this up at dinner tonight or make a grilled cheese on the side to accommodate the rainy weather having. Will definitely be making again!

Oh boy, I was blown away by how easy and tasty this soup was!  It may not a 5 star restaurant dish, but this is like your ultimate favorite mom's dish.  My hubby and I both loved it and finished it in two meals.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.  However, because I felt the veggies were a bit too crunchy side after 3 hours on low heat, I switched to high for the last hour or so.  The next time, I will probably put it on high for the first few hours and switch to low (we have a cheapo slow cooker).  We had it with bread last night and had it with penne pasta for lunch today.  Both were delicious.  There wasn't much liquid/juice as a soup dish but definitely plenty enough to soak it up with your bread.  Absolutely enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Kid friendly. Freezes great too, tasted just as good 3 mos. later. I could eat this everyday. So hearty, and feels good too cause of all the veggies. The flavors are spot on. I've since made it more soupy to go farther adding broth.

To placate the people who can't accept changes, this soup is great the way it is with the exception of the salt.   Like many other reviewers, I only used half the salt.   I love that it's a thick, heart y soup, almost a stew.   We eat it the way it is, or for a meal I serve it over elbow macaroni with Parmesan Cheese.   My husband loves it that way.    That being said, I decided to add my own little tweak to it.   I like to add a 14oz can of corn niblets.   The niblets give the soup more visual interest adding a bit of yellow to the red and green.   They also add great flavor and texture.  Either way, it's and excellent soup.

Love this soup! I've made it in the slow cooker and on the stovetop...it comes out great either way.  Sometimes I add a few potatoes which makes it even more hearty. This recipe yields a lot of soup so I freeze some for another meal. Excellent!

Great stew! It's more like a stew if you ask me. Two things I switched. I omitted the sugar and I used Italian chicken sausage that I just cut up and browned. So good!! I'm putting this into my rotation-great for fall and winter!

I love love love this soup!!! I have made this soup at least 6 times we enjoy it that much! I do make one alteration and that is to add 4 cups of chicken broth like another reviewer did. It is extremely chunky and thick.  The chicken broth is definitely needed or there is so little broth. Other than that I follow the recipe. Super yummy with fresh parm. cheese and a hot  crunchy loaf of french bread!

I have made this 3 times now. It gets better after sitting in the fridge overnight! It is absolutely delicious as is! I have only doubled the garlic (for personal preference only, we are garlic fanatics and do that to every recipe). I suggest quartering thick slices of zucchini, so they are perfect shape for spooning. You must make this soup!

I loved this and so did the whole family. I omitted the celery, and spiraled the zucchini so it looked like noodles. Even my 5 yo, who is one of the pickest of eaters, loved it. Will make again.

The first time I made this I made it too salty as well, but i have made it so many times now that I barely remember that mistake!  I have given this recipe to  everyone I have served it to, they all love it, it's my favorite and my husband's as well.  I thought I had lost the recipe but found it again in my file, I am so happy!  Soup season is starting out right!!

After reading the reviews about being salty, I omitted the salt entirely. I only cook for my husband and I so I only added 1.5 pounds of zucchini (about 3) and half a green and half a red pepper. I also used unsalted diced tomatoes and about 5-6 cloves of minced garlic in place of garlic powder. We like it spicy so I added 2 teaspoons of chili pepper flakes. You can pretty much add any amount of veggies, I had a lot of celery so I used 4 stalks. I don't think it would change the recipe much, as long as all the veggies are there. My husband liked it a lot, we ate it with parmesan cheese and slices of baguette on a rainy stormy night! Yum!

Made it as written, except that I cut it in half and used only 1/2 lb of meat. Pretty good. Will probably bump up seasonings next time, or use hot sausage instead of sweet

I loved this soup. Easy and so much flavor. My husband and son didn't rave about (just not their thing), so I took the rest to work for a potluck and it ALL got eaten and I shared the recipe. Tastes a lot like a minestrone but with sausage. Yum!

I used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned and chicken sausage instead of pork, but no other changes.  I've made this 3 times now and it's fantastic.  It's a regular staple in my regular recipes!

Honestly really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. It is very thick depending on the amount of veggies you use, so mine was more like a stew. I added a little water (about half a cup) to make it less thick and it was perfect

I followed this exactly EXCEPT, I defrosted ground beef instead of sausage.  It was terrific.  It was thick so I added a small can of diced tomatoes and about a 1/2 cup of water . Really tasty.

I always try to sneak in zuchinni whenever I think I can get away with it as I love it, my husband thinks it is "one of those inedible foods". I doubled the spices and added a cup of water. MY hubby is now going back for seconds. This one is a winner!

I absolutely love this soup.  I added carrots and some beef broth to it.  Due to time constraints both times I've made this it has been on top of the stove. It still turned out yummy!

I liked this but agree with some of the other reviews.  It's a little flat and needs more seasoning and it's more like a stew than a soup.  Another area where I had a problem:  who decided it made 6 servings?  Look at the ingredients...1 1/2 lb of sausage, 2 lbs of zucchini, 1 cup of onion, 2 bell peppers, 56 oz of diced tomatoes.  Does that sound like 6 servings? It filled my crockpot to overflowing.  I suggest you first put all the ingredients into a very large bowl so you can stir them and mix them up.  You definitely won't be able to do it after you fill the slow cooker.  It says it makes 6 servings.  Mine filled 14 one cup plastic containers with enough left over for a 15th serving.

It was really easy to make and a great way to use the zucchini from my garden.  My husband put tobacco on his and my son served it with cheese.  It was great both ways.

I am totally addicted to this soup.  I do add some hot pepper flakes and sometimes I put half Italian sausage and half ground beef.  Certainly one of my new favorites! Yummy!

This was very good but I did make with some changes based on what I had on hand. 1lb sweet italian sausage, 1.5lb zucchini, 1 28oz diced tomatoes, 16oz chicken broth, 1 green pepper, more garlic powder, used the same of everything else and I didn't add any salt or celery...came out delicious...sprinkled with mozzarella

We made it on the stove top instead of the slow cooker - huge unexpected family crowd and we did not have time for the cooker or the store, so we raided the garden for tomatoes and peppers, all else was in the house.  It was a great big hit and everyone took the recipe home.  Making it again today, trying the slow cooker this time.  Love this recipe!!!!!

My family and I loved it!  I added mushrooms, cumin, and added some vegetable broth because it wasn't soupy enough for me.  Also I think the zucchini should be sliced a little thinner.

I have been looking for different ways to use up my abundant crop of zucchini, and thought I would give this "soup" a try.  To be honest, we are getting pretty tired of eating zucchini, so I figured this would be eaten for dinner one night then the rest frozen for a quick meal later on....boy, was I wrong!  This is more of a stew than a soup, but is absolutely delicious! I made the following modifications:  used diced tomatoes with roasted garlic, added a can of tomato sauce towards the end as it did not seem to have enough sauce,  and topped with mozzarella (all we had on hand).  I served with a crusty french bread.  The hubby said it kind of resembled chili and he loved it!  We will definitely finish this without freezing any (and it's just the two of us), so I am thinking of making another batch just to freeze for a cool night a month or two from now!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is so delicious and flexible.  I made it with only 1lb of sausage and added more veggies ... I used yellow squash and orange peppers.  What great color and taste.  I have already had several requests for this recipe, so it is very popular!

I did not like the way this soup tasted alone but over whole wheat pasta with parmesan, it was wonderful. The celery and green pepper were really strong tasting throughout. Two flavors that aren't my favorite. I added garbanzo beans and will probably add cannellini beans next time and go for 1 cup of celery and 1 bell pepper next time.

I love the soup.It was more like a thick stew.I cooked the soup on the stove for 1-1/2 hours instead of the crock pot .It turned out great.I had to add chicken broth to make it a little more like soup.It  didn"t change anything on the receipe but add chicken broth.It reminds me of my Italian Grandpa soup that he made when I was a kid.

This soup was delicious! Half of the canned tomatoes that I used had "no salt".  I reduced the salt from 1 tsp. To 1/4 tsp. and it was plenty salty.  Watch the size of zucchini that you use. If the diameter of the slice is too large, it becomes more challenging to eat. ;-)  I've already sent  this recipe on to several friends/relatives. Thanks for posting  this  recipe, it's a keeper!

this is a great use of all your summer squash.  Be sure to find good quality Italian sausage and you'll have a hearty soup that freezes well.

Very flavorful especially the next day. I didn't change anything, but I used it as the sauce in lasagna. It was perfect.

I followed the recipe as written, except I used tomatoes that I had canned from the year before. Turned out great, good flavor. Neighbors and friends thought it needed pasta or was a stew not a soup. No bad reviews from anyone.

Spicy, easy, inexpensive and healthy. Doesn't get any better than that. Didn't even need rice, bread or crackers. Chunky vegetables simmered in their own juice was great on it's own. 

Changes I made: cooked on stovetop at lowest setting and doubled the Italian seasoning.

Good recipe!  I'm not sure where everyone was getting liquid from, but I had to add chicken broth or the veggies would of burned in the crock pot, even with the canned tomatoes.  But it was very tasty, it twas the only thing I had to add for cooking purposes.

It was pretty good, but I agree with some of the other posters that it does NOT need any more salt based on my other ingredients (used Jimmy Dean brand meat).  I put in 1 tsp. (half the amount stated) and that was probably not needed.  I also sautéed the onions, peppers and celery with the meat and added some garlic to the crock pot.  Lastly, I cooked the soup on high for the first hour (2:00), and then on medium for the next two hours and was ready by 5:00.

It's cooking as I write this review but will update when it's done! I did a few different things. Chopped the zucchini, celery, bell pepper and put in a bowl and seasoned them with the spices mixing it together. I used everything on the recipe but used Pizza seasoning since I didn't have Italian. Second, I cooked the Sweet Vidalia Onion. Third, I cooked the celery, bell peppers, and fresh Mild Italian sausage together. I also used several grapes tomatoes quartered and a can of crushed tomatoes. Can't wait to try this!

This is a scrumptious recipe made as-is. Cut my zucchini extra thick so it wouldn't be to mushy. I can see making this the next time adding mushrooms; but it was delicious just as made, and favors enrichened with reheating. Definitely a keeper.

This was an excellent hearty soup!  I followed the recipe exactly how it was written only changing the sausage to mild Italian instead of sweet Italian sausage and reduced the salt by purchasing 'No Salt Added' canned diced tomatoes.  Will definitely make this soup again!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This really got me a lot of compliments from 3 folks I shared with.  I did NOT add salt as the canned tomatoes and the sausage had plenty already.  Flavor was wonderful.

I only added 1 can of tomatoes and instead of the 2nd can I added chicken stock and water.  I served it luke-warm but would also consider doing as a cold soup.  Liked better than a gazpacho.

This soup is fabulous  in texture and taste.   I made no changes.
Oh, I did remove the casings on the sausage prior to  crumbling and browning.  I will definitely make this soup again especially in cooler weather.  Texas is too hot right now.


2/12/2017   I made this soup again and loved it just as much as the first time.  A friend tasted it and loved it as much as I do.  She of course wanted the recipe.    I serve mine over rice or small pasta.  Very delicious.

Excellent and healthy for you!  Added 2 cups of homemade chicken stock for a more "soupy" consistency and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

This to me is the ultimate comfort food with some nice crusty buttered bread. Mine turned out more like a goulash than a soup it was very thick. I started my slow cooker on high for an hour and then turned it down to low so that may be why there wasn't as much liquid. Other than that I did not make any changes. I definitely will make this again!

I cooked it as is, just used turkey instead of regular sausage because it was a personal preference.  
My husband loved it, and I liked it.  I was sick, so I didn't really like anything that day.  I'll make it again and see how it tastes!

Was looking for something to make with all my extra zucchini and this came out great! Husband loved it too.  I added a chopped jalapeno, because living in New Mexico--we like a little heat in our foods.  I think that's what makes this recipe so wonderful..People can add liquid if they want more liquid, leave out salt if they care to.  I like the recipe as written and will make it again..

Best soup ever!!  Reminds me of a soup Olive Garden serves except I don't think theirs is tomato based.  Didn't have time to cook in the crock pot, cooked on the stove top instead and it was delicious.  After browning and draining the sausage (used 2 lbs mild Italian sausage since it's what I had),  added onion, 1/2 green pepper (2 peppers too much for my family's taste), and about 3 tsps of minced garlic, no celery, didn't have any .....simmered for a few minutes before adding one large can of  garlic/basil/oregano petite diced tomatoes and one 32 oz carton of vegetable broth.  Added 4 or 5 chopped red potatoes,  the seasonings, but NO salt and cooked for about 30 minutes.  Added one chopped zucchini and cooked til the zucchini and potatoes were just right.  Will definitely be making again and again.  My family loved it!

This was excellent.  I will certainly make it again.  Am giving recipe to my friend.  I also gave some  soup to my daughter and her husband and am awaiting their comments on this dish.  Anybody who enjoys IItalian foods  will be pleased with this hearty , thick soup.  The only thing I changed was to substitute chicken bouillon granules for the salt.  No big deal.  Great soup.   5 stars!!!!   (Watch the amount of salt because the canned tomatoes have salt as does the sausage.  One can always add more salt to their individual preference later.)

Fantastic.  Everyone raved about how delicious this was.  My dad even went home and looked up the recipe so he can make it.  
I prepared this dish minus the green pepper - I was having guests and I knew one didn't eat green pepper.  My slow cooker was too small so I simmered it for 3 hours and was perfect.

This was DELICIOUS!  The only change I made was using 1 lb. Italian sweet sausage, and 1/2 lb. Italian hot sausage.  I cooked some noodles for my kids to have with it, but I am a diabetic & ate it without the added carbs.  Would definitely make it again!

I'm giving this recipe a 4 only because I used Hot Italian Sausages and not sure what it would be like with the sweet sausage.  My husband and I love it and it's definitely a keeper for us.    Thank your for the wonderful recipe.

Delicious. I wasn't sure where the broth would come from with the listed ingredients, so I added 2 cans of chicken broth. I thought it was the perfect amount of veges vs broth but I may have added more veges than called for.  Just eyeballed it. With that said, I'm sure it would have been just as wonderful (maybe a bit thicker) without the added broth. Good flavor over all. I would make it again. And my kids are it. Always an unexpected plus.

Excellent with or without pasta. We used only 1 tsp salt, may use less next time.

Overall this is a hearty, satisfying stew with a lot of taste. 
My husband and I prefer spicier, so I did half sweet sausage, and half hot sausage. 
Leave out the sugar, it's not necessary between the zucchini, tomatoes, and sweet sausage. 
I did not have green bell pepper, so I used a red one, and only used one, instead of the two called for. Used onion powder, because an whole onion was not available, and used Herbs De Provence because we had run out of straight basil. 
I didn't find it necessary to soften the celery ahead of time, as just tossing it in the pot and leaving it on low for 6 hours resulted in perfectly semi-soft/crunchy celery bits. 
Will definitely make again!!!

I will make again, and soon!
Resisted adding anything extra except this:
Did a 1.5 batch but added 4 cans of chopped tomatoes hoping to maintain or increase the soup nature.
Still ended up with a more stew like consistency.
"Delicious"

What to do with all this zucchini my garden is producing?  I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great!  We have late dinners this time of the year due to sports and this was an easy crockpot solution served with warm sourdough bread.

I received this recipe in my email inbox from all recipes and it looked so good I had to try it. I didn't have all the ingredients so made modifications 1) sausage links vs ground although I would have preferred ground 2) no celery 3) no tarragon 4) replaced tarragon with a handful of whole fresh fresh basil leaves, 5) fresh minced garlic vs powder  and 6) about a cup of chicken broth. Super delish!  Will make again but might add some carbs with beans or pasta.

This is a very flavorful dish, especially because it can be modified to use different vegetables and textures. 

Unfortunately, I feel this recipe fails when it comes down to be described as a soup. I think the dish contains too many tomatoes; so, in the future, I recommend only using one (1) 28oz of tomatoes and adding more stock liquid to the dish. Still, I am including this dish in my recipe box because it is very flavorful and and easy way to use vegetables from your garden.

Ate it over rice, and it was amazing. Great job!

Loved it and will make again.  I did make some changes because we like a little more spice.  I used zesty chopped tomatoes with garlic, added pepper, beef broth and used 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 sweet.  It really is more stew like than soup but delicious none the less.  Next time I will use less Green Pepper as I thought it overpowered the zuchini .

Since my slow cooker was a bit too small for this batch, I was able to cook it in the oven. I also made some small changes to the recipe since I had other fresh ingredients from my garden... the addition of some fresh green beans in place of one green pepper, fresh basil, rosemary and thyme along with some garlic. I also cut down the salt since I'm not a salt fan.
Did add the chopped garlic, onion, green pepper to the meat and celery mixture to cook a bit. Once it came to a simmer, I added a Parmesan rind that I had in the freezer on top and popped it into a 275 degree oven (in my oven that kept it at a simmer). 
Definitely will make this over and over. Loved it!

Very good flavor. I cut recipe in half and it still served 6 amply. I substituted some link brautwurst, peeled and sliced 1/2", and added a can of whole kernel corn. Also used half yellow summer squash and half zucchini. It's a keeper!

I thought this was very good.  The only adjustments I made were using fresh herbs, added kale (had that in garden too) and one jalapeño for a bit of heat.  I will be making this again.

Excellent variation of a healthy vegetable based soup.  I used sweet italian sausage as well as some chicken broth to make it more "soupy".  This will be a staple for us, we enjoyed it very much.

This was a really tasty soup. I wanted it a little leaner so I used lean chuck cut into small pieces , also added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, cut up carrots and a can of beef broth. (seemed a little thcker than soup so I felt it needed the broth.)  Great soup base to add or delete as you please!

Made it almost exactly as written.  Minor changes were that I sautéed the onions with the celery and omitted the green pepper and sugar.  Served it with some beautiful rustic bread and am getting rave reviews!  Great recipe thanks!

Excellent and hearty!!!!  I made mine in my favorite heavy enameled soup pot and it took one hour.  I made only a couple of small changes to taste.  To cut back a bit on the saltiness, I used 1 lb. of Italian sausage and 1 lb. of lean ground beef.  Instead of green bell peppers, I used one red and one yellow.  And instead of sugar, I used Splenda.  That's it.  Otherwise, I made it according to recipe and it was fabulous.  Be sure to cut the veggies into large 1/2" bits as directed otherwise they'll be too soggy.

I have made this soup twice in less than 2 weeks! I love it! I made it stove top versus the slow cooker because I wanted to serve it sooner and I prefer veggies with some firmness left to them. The second time around I added cumin and some red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick. This one is definitely a keeper!

Made a couple changes based on reviews and absence of some ingredients, used red and yellow bell pepper, zucchini and yellow squash, green beans and carrots that needed to be used. All taken into consideration, it's a great soup on its own, and a wonderful base for additions, LOVE that it's fairly low calorie as well (used ground turkey and seasoned it, no Italian sausage on hand), yeah veggies!

Our neighbor gave us a huge zucchini, and I made the recipe as written, except I used 3 14oz cans of tomatoes since that's what I had on hand, so it was a 14oz can of tomatoes shy of the recipe. It was really good, much better than I had thought it would be, and DH says it's a definite have-again meal. I served it in bowls with a couple of pieces of naan.

Made per the recipe but used yellow and red peppers and sea salt. Was not too salty but next time I'd use only 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Excellent.

This turned out so good.  I brought it into work for my co-workers...a number of them will be making this.  The only changes I made were use half sweet and half hot italian sausage, cut the salt in half, and use fire roasted canned tomatoes.  Yummy!

Everyone raved about it! I used fresh yellow squash out of garden since I didn't have enough zucchini and my own canned tomatoes. 8/2016

I made a couple of modifications:  Used Hot turkey Italian sausage for a spicier and leaner option.  
I used 1 can of chunky crushed tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes and then used this as a pasta sauce.  I put it over penne, but also tried it over spaghetti squash and it was terrific.  
We loved it!  Definitely a "do over."

Cooked this in my pressure cooker - so much faster! 15lbs pressure for only 5 minutes once the pressure is up.  I used less sausage so I added some cannellini  beans. and some chicken broth. Taste to see if the tomatoes make the soup too acidic, if necessary add a some baking soda; just a teaspoon or so. It will fizz a bit so don't be alarmed.

We had a lot of summer sausage in the freezer, so I made it with these variations: 1 1/2# summer sausage in place of the Italian sausage, only one can diced tomatoes, no salt added (plenty in the meat and tomatoes), no bell peppers, a couple dashes black pepper and a teaspoon paprika; substituted 2+ tablespoons chopped garlic in place of the powder; and included 2 quarts of organic (lower in salt) vegetable broth.  Simmered on the stove a couple hours.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband, who typically points out only what should be changed with a recipe, totally gushed over it.  It was also a great way to use an enormous zucchini given to us!

Good as advertised.  No need for changes.  I used 2 kinds of sausage cut up links and ground.  I don't like soup much, but this is more of a "stew".  Nice and hardy!  No better way to use that fresh zuchinni.

This was absolutely delicious..I will be making this again soon! I made it exactly as the recipe called for except  that my cans of tomatoes were salt free. This makes it's own broth and it is fantastic if made as written.

This soup received great reviews from everyone including my neighbors.  Definitely will be a repeat meal.  CHANGES:  I omitted the salt after reading other reviews.  It was still slightly salty.  Next time I'll use low sodium diced tomatoes.
Thank you Jennifer for such a great soup recipe!

good soup. easy to put together. I added a quart of chicken broth to make it more soupy rather than so thick and stew-like. Hubby loved it. Will definitely make again.

This soup is phenomenal and so easy to make! It's bursting with flavor and is great by itself or pairs well with white rice. My husband and I love it!! I like to try a lot of different recipes from Allrecipes, and this one is one of the best we've had. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe.

Will make it many more times! Here's how I tweaked it a bit. I used real chopped garlic...maybe 3-4 cloves, added a 32 oz carton of chicken broth, 3 T. pesto and then added the zucchini the last 45 min. Delicioso!

Made this today using lots of garden produce. Big hit at my house. Love the big chunks of green pepper and zucchini and celery. I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow and, if there is any left after that, I'm going to use it as a starter for some spaghetti sauce.  The way the fam is diving in though, I don't think it will make it past tomorrow. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Delicious! I used homegrown zucchini from the farmers market and this turned out amazing. Probably had more zucchini than called for so added vegetable broth. Also had  2 hamburger patties on hand so I browned them with the sausage . I will definitely make this again.

This soup is fantastic.  Like most people, I hate it when people change it and rate their own dishes.  So that said, I had 1lb of hot Jimmy Dean sausage on hand so I did use that.    We had a loaf of French bread and topped the soup with grated Parmesan.  Wouldn't change a thing.  This recipe is a keeper and I think pretty healthy, too!!  Thank you, Jennifer.

I made this yesterday and it is very good. I didn't add any salt before cooking it in the slow cooker as I personally don't like a lot of salt in food and there is salt in the canned tomatoes. I'm glad I didn't as I felt the taste was spot on. This seems to be a cross between a soup and a stew and is a hearty meal. I agree with other comments - don't rate this if you don't make the recipe as is. I'd rather know what people think of the original recipe. You can tweek it the second or third time after you've made it the original way.

This is a winner.  Didn't have celery.  Substituted fennel bulb and used spicy Italian sausage.  So good and easy.  Will probably put left overs on pasta or barley.

DELICIOUS! My only change ( sorry, I hate those too!) was minus 14 ounces of tomatoes as I only had three 14 ounce cans.  We are having a bumper crop of zucchini this year so very happy to find this. Will definitely make again. Might add some cooked pasta at the end next time?

This made a great meal. I did make some changes.  I like stuff spicy so I used spicy Italian sausage. Due to other comments saying it was too salty I did not add salt OR sugar for that matter. I find many recipes that add sugar don't really need it. I also used 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I might add just a little water next time to make it a little more soupy but I didn't really measure my veggies very well which could account for the thickness. The soup was really tasty though and not too difficult to make.

I slightly increased the sausage so that I could use up the whole package, same thing with the vegetables, I probably went a bit over on each  (again - I didn't want to put away part of an onion.  I threw in a few handfuls of rough chopped green beans, because they needed to be used up. I left out the sugar by mistake.
I thought is was a little bland but my Husband loved it!  He said I should make it again and it would be fine to use even more zucchini!  I am always looking for a good use for zucchini at this time of year.  This was a winner and I will make it again.  Maybe I will try hot sausage like some of the other reviewers because we love spicy food.

There's a lot of substance to this soup!! The ingredients are light and nutritious so it's odd that the soup would be so, so filling and satisfying.  I poured mine over white rice.  I only had 1 (15 oz) can of tomatoes and I didn't have the basil to add but the soup still turned out really tasty.   This is a hearty  delicious soup!  I'll make this one again.

I loved this soup! I just changed a couple of things. First, I cut the recipe in half since I was only serving for two and the original recipe seemed like a lot. Second, I substituted 1-1/2 cup of chicken broth and about 1/4 cup tomato paste for the can of diced tomatoes, adding a couple of diced tomatoes from my garden. I will definitely make this again.

It didn't knock my socks off but I liked it.  I had to make it on the stove top because I didn't have enough time to do the crock pot...and therefore I had to add chicken broth because there was absolutely no liquid but for what the tomatoes were in.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  It was good but I felt the seasoning was a touch off.  Next time I'd add some fennel seeds.

This soup is delicious! The only thing I did was use extra sausage and I served it over elbow macaroni. Neither of my children like zucchini but my six year old was raving about how much she loved the "pickles" in the soup. I definitely will make this again. If the kids love it, then it is definitely a keeper! This is much healthier than the soup they normally request. I just made it tonight and I seriously want another bowl. Thank you for this recipe.

This was really good - but I added 28oz of chicken broth and omitted the salt. Without the broth it would have been a stew.

Delicious !  This is more like a stew then a soup - which I love.
It is nice to find a recipe that is healthy and flavorful.  I pretty much made it as is, with the exception of using red peppers and substituted 1 can of crushed tomatoes for the diced. I also sautéed the onions & peppers for a bit before adding them to the slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe !

This recipe was great! I didn't have garlic powder, basil or Italian seasonings on hand but added a some pepper and Creole seasoning because we like things flavorful and it still turned out wonderful. My mother is already asking me to make some for her just from the pictures I sent! This recipe is one we will definitely be keeping around. :D

Loved this just as written.  I didn't have any problem with it being too salty as some others have.  I did carefully measure and weigh my ingredients so that can make a difference.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Have been making this for awhile now at the recommendation of a friend, and other friends have been making it after tasting mine. Followed previous suggestions to use diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano,  also use turkey sausage, both mild and hot. Yummy!

I followed some of the other reviews' advice and used 2 14 oz. cans of diced tomatoes and then 28 oz. no-sodium chicken broth. It turned out pretty well. It made about eight generous servings, it wasn't overly expensive, and it tasted pretty good. Next time, I would probably use a bit less chicken broth, but other than that, I enjoyed it.

Wow! Used 1 lb of sausage, and 1 lb of zucchini, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, maple syrup for sugar substitute and then followed the rest of the recipe. Had crock pot on high since I lack preparedness skills! Wonderful recipe!!!

Wow! Amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly but for increasing the sugar by 1/2 tsp on the advice of a friend who made it and said it was great but just a little bit acidic. I was glad I did, just to tone it down a bit. Don't let the name of the recipe deter you if you're not a big zucchini fan, it blends in. This soup is awesome, almost like a spicy minestrone. My husband and I couldn't stop raving about it. I served it with cornbread. Yummm, perfect for a chilly fall day. Will definitely make this again!

JUST DEE- licious..... by everyone's standards!!!  Will try making it with turkey meat next time. even chicken cubes? great possibilities but always maintain the core of this recipe - it really is perfect as comfort food and just plain yumminess~  Def NOT salty -  Oh and i used 2 lbs of the meat cuz i bought two packages and didn't want to throw out 1/2 a lb !!  Soup or Stew? Who cares? it was awesome whatever you call it!

Very tasty! I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic , as others have suggested. It didn't seem 'soupy' enough, so I did add a cup of beef broth to the recipe. Great way to use my farmers' market bounty!

What a wonderful, flavorful soup! I modified it because there's only 2 of us:  halved the veges (left out the celery), used 1 28 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, added 1 lb of sausage and left the spices as is since we like things to be 'well seasoned.' No salt added (per other reviewers comments) and it was plenty salty from the sausage.  Oh, I couldn't believe there would be enough broth so I added about 1/2 cup vege broth and it was perfect, not too thick. Hubby was particularly pleased as there were no additional carbs, just veges and meat.  While it tastes good the first day made, it was outstanding on day 2!

This makes an awesome pasta sauce, with veggies and meat to make everyone happy.  I made the full recipe and froze several portions for future pasta nights.  I used one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and one like can of crushed tomatoes with garlic and basil (the crushed makes a thicker, stickier sauce), and added a diced fresh tomato because it was in the fridge. I added a couple torn leaves of fresh kale to the crock pot and I cooked it for about 8 hours then let it rest in the fridge over night.  Having done it, I recommend decreasing the added salt by half, as the sausage and pasta have gobs of it, and increasing sugar by half to cut the tomato acid.  This is a recipe to which you can add whatever veggies you have available or in season.  I'm keeping this one!

This recipe is awesome! The second time I made it I omitted the sugar, didn't miss it at all. I used fresh basil instead of dried (since I have it)  I added some chicken broth to make it "soupier". Wonderful!

Despite what other reviewers think, you DON'T need additional broth.  The juice from the  tomatoes and cooked veggies make a great broth.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written and it was outstanding.  I had it in the slow cooker for the full 6 hours but that was too long--veggies were overcooked but it was still SOOOOOO good.  Next time I will cook for 4 hours.   My house smelled wonderful and the family loved it!

I used half hot and half mild Italian sausage, and added a drained can of dark red kidney beans and some chicken broth. Yummy!

Thanks for this great and easy recipe Jennifer!  Perfect for this season with fresh veggies from the garden or farmers' markets.   I did make one change which was to eliminate the sausage to make it vegetarian and it was outstanding!  No need to replace it but you could add extra spices to make up for those missing in the sausage if you wanted to.  I will find out tomorrow but I bet this would be delicious served cold as a gazpacho too!

This was a great soup/stew! I made it exactly as is and cooked it for about 5 hours on low. The zucchini was a little overcooked but what can you expect from putting it in a slow cooker? Next time I may try just 4 hours. It was very flavorful and I did not think it was too salty. Will definitely make this again!

I cut back on the salt and used 2 14oz cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with habenaros and 1 28oz can regular diced tomatoes. It was excellent. I will make this again for sure. Ny friends also loved it.

You really need to try this recipe as written.  It is delicious.  Then if you want to tweak it, have at it. I can't imagine it much better any other way.

Amazing! Used a few differnt things based on what I had in the house.  Sausage was precooked, so got to skip the first step of frying and draining and dirtying another pan. :)  Also used an extra can of tomatoes to make a thinner soup, potatoes, black beans, corn, and carrots.  And used 1 tsp of salt (figured people could always add more to their own dish).  Yummy!

Made this recipe as printed with no variations.  To call it a soup is really a misnomer since there isn't enough liquid to justify "soup" in the title.  So, it is more appropriately a stew. Too much tomato for my taste.  If I were to make this again, I'd make it as a pasta sauce, cut the tomato to two to three 14-oz. cans of diced tomatoes (seasoned or plain)and add eggplant and mushrooms to the mix to make a heartier pasta sauce with more veggies.  I would also brown about 1/2 pound of ground beef along with the sausage.  Found that around 5 hours was quite enough for the vegetables to get tender.

I thought it was excellent. A lot like the other italian sausage soups, but better for those who have a bumper crop of zucchini. Fiance thought it was good, but I could tell he wasn't overly impressed. I didn't change much and wouldn't. Will definitely make again, though I am not sure I would rave about it for others too.

So good! Made this back in July & just pulled a bowl out of the freezer for lunch. Forgot I was supposed to top with parm, but just as good without.  I used turkey Italian sausage & I think I used a mix of peppers rather than all green (green, orange, & red). Had it with crusty bread & I'm in heaven! Thanks for the great recipe!

I tripled the recipe and cooked it 8-10 hours, then thickened it somewhat with flour.  I used 2 large cans of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning and no salt added, plus one can unflavored and salted.  [The sausage added further salt.]  Fantastic result.  And healthy, according to the ingredients.  The Walmart Italian sausage had no nitrites.  [I do wonder if all that cooking destroys nutrients.]  Hint.  The Parmesan sprinkle is redundant as the soup/stew is wonderfully flavorful.
