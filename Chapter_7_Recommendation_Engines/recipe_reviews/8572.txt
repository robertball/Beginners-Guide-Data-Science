This recipe OMITS the Time the chicken should be cooked, a fairly important point.

I had to tweak the sweet/sour ingredients a little bit til they were how I wanted them. I baked the chicken legs in the oven at 350f for about 40mins (they were pretty big, thick and meaty), basting every so often with the salsa sauce. Since I used a combination of salsa and picante sauce, they were too spicy for me, but Husband loved them. Served with a cucumber/corn salad, and sweet potato fries. Not bad at all. Thanks, Beverley!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added hot sauce as suggested in reviews, as well as a dash of red pepper flakes. Also baked instead of grilling and used chicken breast pieces. Loved it! The vinegar was pretty strong but I really enjoyed that. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe makes a great sauce. I didn't have a whole chicken, so I seared some chicken breast strips and then simmered them in the sauce until it thickened up a bit. I used this sauce to bake a whole trout also, and it was delicious. Both times I used half of the recipe. Thanks for this tasty and versatile recipe.

I did modify this to receive the degree of "thickness" I like in a BBQ sauce.  While simmering it as is, it appeared too thin.  I added some honey, ketchup and about a tablespoon of tomato paste.  This turned out to be the best BBQ sauce I ever made!!! Sweet and tangy, thick and gooey.  I loved it.  This one is a keeper!

This sauce was excellent! I made it more Paleo friendly by using coconut oil and subbing coconut nectar for the corn syrup.

We grilled the boneless chicken breasts in foil packets. Used about 1/4 cup of the sauce and brushed each side of the breasts before sealing up the packets. Cooked on a med. hot grill using indirect heat. The center burner was turned off on our 3-burner grill. Cooked for 15 minutes, then turned over & cooked another 10 minutes. Removed breasts from foil and placed on the grill basting with additional sauce. Turned after 2 minutes, rebasted and left 2 more minutes. Removed from grill and let rest 5 minutes under a foil tent.

The chicken came out perfect, moist & juicy.
