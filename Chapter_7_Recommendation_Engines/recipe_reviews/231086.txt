I'm proud to be the first person to rate this recipe. I made this to bring to a Superbowl Party and was concerned that there would be any left to bring as we kept "sampling" it. It has a great taste and the cayenne provided just enough bite without being too overwhelming.  I'm sure other more experienced cooks will have suggestions how to make this better but for me it's just perfect.  It will be definitely be an addition to my entertaining menu.

I haven't even put this dip into the oven yet and I'm already in love. I actually forgot the cayenne pepper but it tastes wonderful. I did add salt and pepper before I put it in the baking dish, and I've drizzled a little melted butter over the top of the bread crumbs to add a little crispy brownness.  Probably gilding the lily, but what the hey. Once you're already invested in cream cheese and mayo you might as well go right over the calorie cliff!

Very good!  Made this for a party and  it was completely gone in no time.  Will definitely be my appetizer from now on to bring to any gathering.  I added Slap Yo Momma Cajun seasoning to it to add extra heat and flavor.  I served it with tortilla chips.

I made this for my annual Christmas party and it was a hit. 
Some of the less social folks in the group literally sat around the dip like a Templar guarding the Holy Grail and they devoured it. I had everyone who actually got to taste it, asking for the recipe. 
I'm having a Christmas eve party tonight and this time, I'm making two dishes of it!

I created an account with Allrecipes just to rate this. Awesome. I made with sour cream instead of mayo because that's what I had in the house. I added salt and pepper to taste and a little lemon juice to taste. Thank you!

Made it per recipe except used panko bread crumbs as I did not have any regular.  Everyone loved it!  It makes a lot and the pie plate was very full.  Make sure you cook it good and long so it is fully heated all the way through but without overbrowning the top.  Cream cheese needs to melt good.   It actually tasted much better after reheating it several times.   Ate it on crackers.  delicious and would make it again.

So, so delicious and easy! I used an extra 4oz of crab as I bought 2 - 8oz Waterfront Bistro jumbo crab meat jars from Safeway and figured that some extra crab never hurt anyone. Was very meaty, creamy, and went very well with Ritz and whole wheat crackers.

This dip was a big hit at my New Yearâ€™s Eve party last night. I baked it according to the recipe and then transferred the dip to a small crockpot so it stayed warm and creamy throughout the party. I added more breadcrumbs and chopped onion/pepper to the top when I moved it to the crockpot...for a better looking presentation. Good recipe!

I don't know what the problem was with this recipe, because typically the AllRecipes are so delicious.  But it tasted very "fishy." I used real crab that was fresh (and expensive) so just can't figure it out.  It was fairly bland and dry too.   Disappointing!

I've read all the reviews and only one did not care for it. Otherwise reviewers  loved it. It is a very easy and versatile recipe, ready to be served with baguette slices, crackers, pita chips and mini bell pepper or celery. Hardly anyone changed the recipe so this is a keeper. Can be made ahead and popped in the oven as needed. Could see this as an opened faced sandwich topped with a little parmesan cheese, baked then under the broiler a minute or so. Add tomato basil soup and call it dinner. Thank you for a yummy offering!

Maybe I need to try this again, but it had NOOOOO flavor.  Possibly the crab I used?  Not sure, but tasteless and not something I'd recommend.

I forgot to put the bell pepper and onions on the top of this dish, but I don't think it would have made that much difference in the overall taste of this recipe.  It was pretty good, but maybe I'd try to add a few things to enhance the flavors.  I mixed cracker crumbs with the last of my bread crumbs, and that was a good topping!  Thanks for this recipe!

Added juice and zest of a 1/2 lemon. Didn't do the bread crumbs.  Also added about a cup of frozen spinach.

Easy to make and always a hit. I have made it as written and I have made it with 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 sour cream, trying to make it a bit healthier. Very good either way.

Made this for a New Years Eve Party.  It got raves and was gone in less than half an hour.  I didn't use green onions or red bell pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  Not sure it really needs them because it was outstanding as it was.  I also only had a 7 oz jar of marinated artichokes and used that.  Will definitely be making it again!

This was excellent! I made it for a holiday get together and everyone wanted the recipe. I prepped it the night before, refrigerated it overnight , added the breadcrumbs to the top , and popped it in the oven as company was arriving. I will definitely be making again!

My nephew asked me to make something for his 21st bday party and I saw this recipe. I made a huge casserole dish, served it with French baguette/pita chips combo and it was gone within the hour! Thanks for this amazing recipe. Will be making this again and again.

I forgot the bell peppers, and I meant to add spinach but forgot that too (raising children...). I also omitted the breadcrumbs, but on purpose. It had a nice kick, but not to ruin the rest of the food you want to eat. Super delicious and I'd be super happy to make it again!

I've made this recipe exactly as written several times, and it's ALWAYS a hit.  To make it gluten-free, simply omit the bread crumbs.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It was unremarkable at best, actually not very good.

Made this and loved it.   For less spice just use less or omit Cayenne Pepper.  Serve warm and enjoy.
