This is a very good start, but needed some additional spices to avoid blandness: i added 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1 tsp dijon, 1/8 tsp fresh ground pepper, and a tablspoon of finely minced green onion. I also replaced the 2 slices of dried bread with ~1.25 cup of fine dried bread crumbs, which makes a nice consistency.

We served this on our special Mother's Day buffet and it was a huge succes!  Lot's of compliments.  Enough of a zing to get your attention but not overwhelming.  Was complimented well with a sweet hot slaw.

Wow! No one does it better than Old Bay!  I've been trusting their spice as my "secret ingredient" for many years.

Best crab cakes with a couple of revisions. I used pumpernikel bread, and added a small amount of bread crumbs. Instead of Old Bay seasoning (which I couldn't find), I used the salt free Tony Sacheres (sp?) and fresh parsley instead of dried. I also used an extra egg. The crab cake sauce from this site went with these so well!

Did not hold together well and lacked something. Maybe more Oldbay would give it more flavor.

A really good crab cake recipe. I needed a bit more zing so some chopped garlic(tsp) and a tsp of Tabasco livened them up to my taste. Old Bay is soo good for so many recipes.

My family has been using this recipe for many many years.  For those who like a little extra "kick", add 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  That is the change we made and it brightens up the flavor a lot.

Never having made a crab cake before, it was hard to choose a recipe. I decided to go with this one as it seemed simple and not mucked up with a laundry list of ingredients. It didn't disappoint. I am not a crab cake lover, I find them all to be "fishy" ( even using premium crab) but I enjoyed it as much as I could. I don't think these were bland at all, they were flavorful without being overpowering. If you want these to taste like spices and vegetables, save your crab and make something else. The only thing I changed was after they were formed, I patted Panko Crumbs onto the cakes. They fried up nice and crispy and I ate mine dipped in butter! ( who doesn't love fried foods dipped into more grease haha)..If I ever make them again, I would use this recipe again. Thanks!

Did exactly as written but the cakes wouldn't stick together. We did add more bread crumbs then & still a flop. Seemed so easy, but guess we'll stick with salmon cakes since I can keep them together.

Made these for the first Friday of Lent when we're all feeling a little gloomy, lol. I thought these would cheer us up and I was right.  These crab cakes were really delicious and so easy to prepare. I cooked them on my pancake griddle with the slightest bit of oil and melted butter and they turned out golden-brown and picture-perfect. If only I'd taken a picture!  Next time, I'll chop an onion into mix to suit my family's taste better. I served these with lemon wedges and a nice horseradishy cocktail sauce.

I have made these twice now. I enjoyed them and I like the consistency alot. I think that the bread mixed with milk is better than using bread crumbs, but that is my personal taste. I agree that it needs more spices and next time I will add more Old Bay and some dried mustard.
