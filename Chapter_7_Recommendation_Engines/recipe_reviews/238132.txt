These are terrific as-is! I think next time, I'll go total caveman and thread some thick cut bacon on them too. Total party food!

Great flavor!  The only things did differently was added fresh minced garlic to the marinate.  Another great summer grilling recipe!

Awesome made it as recipes stated. Did add zucchini and some minced garlic. Let chicken and sausage marinate for a few hours before making the skewers. Super good!

We are vacationing and were not able to get all the ingredients so we adapted with dried oregano leaves, a little apple cider vinegar and no cayanne pepper. We all loved it!  Super easy to make.

We used a polska kielbasa, which is what we had. The only other change was adding zucchini to the skewers, and they were very tasty! The only thing to remember about these is to cut the onion chunks big enough, mine were somewhat too small and hard to skewer.

My hubby did the shopping and accidentally got Mexican chorizo instead of Spanish so I just made it as a stir fry. I loved it, Iâ€™m only rating 3/5 because the hub said 2 and I would say 4 so we are shooting for middle. He has a plain pallet... nice bold flavors

My family didn't care for the skewered chorizo but I thought overall it was OK. I'm assuming if I had used another brand of chorizo that was firmer then it might have been different.

I added baby corn between the onion and and I think some pineapple chunks or watermelon chunks would have really amped up the flavor

My Hubby said this was Ok.   On some of the skewers I added mini tomatoes, mini red onions, different colored peppers, zucchini and mushrooms.

Very good kabobs. The quick toss in the liquid stuff didn't add a ton of flavor but was very tasty nevertheless.

I've made this three times already and it turns out great every time. Easy to make, and very flavorful! A new grilling staple in my recipes.

The marinade was a little bland. Next time I may try adding some minced garlic.

This was really good and easy too. I substituted Hot Italian sausage as I could not find chorizo. It was still very tasty. Took a bit longer to cook the sausage. We will cook this one again! Enjoyed by all the family.

Made this a second time with Chorizo Sausage. Very good, nice spicy flavour. I cooked it for about 20 minutes to make sure the sausage was cooked completely.

These were really easy and really delicious!  Easily customizable and no need to measure out the marinade - just dump a bit of oil and vinegar and seasonings onto the meat.  We cooked them on a grill pan on the stove and it still worked out great!
