This really is "the procastinator's dream recipe."  I did the following slight modifications: 1.) used whipped cream cheese (easier to spread and won't get hard if refridgerated), 2.) used a whole lb of medium cooked shrimp (what am i going to do with the remaining 1/4 lb anyway?!), 3.) used all 12 oz of ZESTY cocktail sauce, 4.) used only the greens of the green onions, and 5.) sprinkled parm cheese on top w/o measuring. This went fast at my work potluck so I'd recommend doubling it if serving more than 10.

I can't believe it tastes as good as it does for such a quick appetizer. Make sure the shrimp is completely defrosted and dried or you'll end up with  mess.
