This recipe is a perfect combination/balance of flavours and seasoning to accompany your favourite meal or compliment your favourite recipe. I ate these as is with some Tabasco and then we added jalape√±os mashing them for vegetarian tacos. They were a welcome addition in soup for lunch the next day. I didn't add any salt regardless of the description and no one missed it. We also chose to use only 2 cloves of garlic and the beans were fine this way. I used a 7 litre cooker and used enough water to cover the soaked beans by 2 inches. I cooked for 10 minutes allowing the steam to release naturally. The beans were a little soft, breaking easily when touched with a fork, so watch your cooking time.
