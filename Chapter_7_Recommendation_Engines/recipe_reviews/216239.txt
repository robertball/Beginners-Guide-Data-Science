Very tasty and great for a quick weeknight meal!  I wanted to have some veggies with this so I just grabbed what was in the fridge - onion, celery, and carrots - and added them to the pan at the same time as the green onion and curry paste.  They were still crisp tender when the dish was finished.  I added a little more curry paste than the recipe called for as I like it spicy.  I would suggest maybe adding a little more liquid to the dish if you are going to add vegetables.

Delicious! I added a few things. I cooked the chicken in raw organic extra virgin coconut oil and added shrimp, water chestnuts and chili's.

This recipe was delish!!!

I am the youngest in my family (21) and have more experienced pallet so when I decided to make this recipe for dinner my family was a little skeptical (especially because the curry STINKS up the kitchen). However this recipe was delicious!

I did make a few changes:

the recipe did not specify whether to get sweetened or unsweetened coconut milk- so i purchased unsweetened which I found when cooking left the recipe a little bitter so i ended up adding a tablespoon or 2 of sugar.

So next time I will probably buy the sweetened!

I also added portabella mushrooms and large pieces of white onion.

I served the chicken over Uncle Ben's 90 second basmati rice! which was perfect with the chicken!

Overall, delicious meal and most definitely will make again!

YUM!  I added some chopped tomato, onion, and lentils to add more consistency.  I also cut the chicken in chunks and simmered it WITH the sauce because I've seen it this was in restaurants.  Sooo good!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I totally forgot to put the lime juice in but i did add some flaked coconut for extra sweetness and it came out great. I made basmati rice and peas to go with. It was even more delicious the next day for lunch.

Made it for some friends, and they loved it. Very simple to make too, first time cooking after a mostly college diet(top ramen & mac and cheese).

Omg, this is SOOOO good! And, it looks really pretty! I added a small can of pineapple, a red pepper and some chopped carrots; it was wonderful! I made this for my most opinionated and discerning friend and all he could do was rave....this is definitely a keeper.

Smelled great, but then the chicken just tasted of chicken and curry sauce flavor was weak.  :(  I was hoping for something similar to what you'd get at a Thai restaurant (I used red curry paste), but it wasn't even close.

Perfect sauce!!  I actually did this the affordable way...I used 4 large chicken leg quarters.  I boiled them, removed the skin, pulled the meat.  Threw the bones back in the water and let boil it boil for broth.  I put the chicken in the fridge for 2 hours while the broth was simmering.  I later followed the recipe as specified with just a quick toss of the meat in step 2.  I used the chicken broth I had made to boil white rice.  I sprinkled the rice with curry, salt and a pinch of sugar and it was awesome with it.  I added a few drops of hot sauce.  My 7 & 10 year old boys loved it!  The meal cost me a total of $4.68 and it was enough to feed 6 people.  Furthermore, all 4 of my animals got a treat as well.  My dogs got the skins from the chicken and anything extra that boiled off.  My cats got the final mush that's left in the pan when you drain the broth. If you try it, make sure to pick through very carefully for small bones that could harm your pet.  I also have left over broth in the freezer for future recipes.

We loved it! I followed others suggestions and added sugar. I also used a whole white onion and added a bag of Asian veggies. I used the whole can of coconut milk and doubled the amount of red curry paste and it turned out great! I cooked in a large wok and never removed the chicken after cooking, just kept adding the ingedients and the dish was not short on flavor!

Looked up this recipe recently because I made it for Valentine's dinner last year and my husband and I loved it - he asked to make it our little tradition.  I can't stress this enough - taste your food while it is cooking so you can tweak appropriately.  We really like curry so used half the jar and a little more lime juice - this recipe is sooo good and quick!!

I agree with catwhispererPhD who said:  "Smelled great, but then the chicken just tasted of chicken and curry sauce flavor was weak. :("   I cut up the chicken into chunks and cooked them in the sauce to try to get more flavor in the chicken (after reading the other comments), but it still just didn't seem to have the flavor of the curry in it, and yeah, the curry was weak--I added a little salt and sugar and that helped a bit but it still needed something.

Amazing! The curry wasn't to spicy and next time ill add more to make it more spicy! But the lime juice surprised me it added great flavor. This recipe was so easy and simple I love it next I will cut up the chicken in tiny pieces its easier to eat.

Was a little salty but added a few pinches of sugar to help cut the salt and it turned out FABULOUS! Also sateed up some sugar snap peas, carrots, and onions as a side dish. 
As the final touch we made Giada DeLaurentis' mango lassi from the food network. Look it up and definitely give it a try!

My family and I all love this dish. I serve it with garlic and herb couscous and can't get enough. I use the sweetened coconut milk cut the chicken into cubes. I will need to start doubling the recipe though, because everyone always wants seconds.

I will definitely try this again, flavors were good, but do not try this in the crockpot milk separated from fat and water not pretty at all but I was able to salvage dinner out of it. I will try again as written.

The proportions are off in this recipe - way too much tomato it overpowered the dish, too much liquid and you lose the coconut milk flavor. I added fresh ginger to cut the tomato flavor it helped.  If I made this dish again I would drain the tomatoes and reduce the quantity and I would add more curry, possibly more coconut milk.

Wow, all four of my young kids even liked this. It's a miracle recipe as far as I'm concerned! I followed the instructions, except I didn't have tomato sauce and I skipped the sugar. I don't think there is any reason to add it because it is so good without it. I also cut the curry by about half, just because kids would be eating it. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. The curry/sauce was so good you can eat it like soup. Really recommend this! I served it over some rice that I did quickly in the microwave. A really good weeknight meal - quite wholesome and tasty!

This was pretty good. I chopped the chicken up and left it in, to simmer in the sauce, while I cooked everything else. I added some vegetables, I forgot to get lime, so as another reviewer suggested, I added some sweetened coconut flakes to make it a little sweeter. I well make this again.

It was a good start. I used a regular yellow onion instead of green onions. Once they were translucent, I added my spices. I used curry powder, cumin, cinnamon, bay leaf, red chili flakes, salt, pepper. Then added my curry paste, toasted it for a moment. Could only find paste in the Asian section, it was red. I used an entire can of coconut milk. (didn't want to waste it!) Chopped up boneless, skinless, chicken thighs and cooked IN the sauce until they were done ( about 20 minutes). I put a tablespoon or so of lentils in there to thicken up the sauce as the chicken was cooking. It came out amazing. Thanks!

This was delicious even though I didn't have lime juice or cilantro. I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic to the sauce and served it with yellow rice and sautéed yellow squash.

This was only my second time making a Curry dish. I thought it came out great. Sorry I didn't make a larger portion as my wife and I both wanted more.
