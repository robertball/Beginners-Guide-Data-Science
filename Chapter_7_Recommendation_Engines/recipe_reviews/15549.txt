I have been making this dip for a while and it is always a hit. I do it a little different though. I use a pound of breakfast sausage that comes in the tube. I fry it but leave the grease on it. The I put one brick of cream cheese and one can of original Rotel tomatoes in my dip crock pot and add the sausage. I let it sit for at least an hour before serving. AWESOME with tortilla chips.

A great alternative to the normal queso! I made some modifications that really made this an awesome dip according to all the guests at our halloween party!  I used the HOT Jimmy Dean Sausage, added more Rotel and then, after it had cooled to "warm", I stirred in some shredded cheddar cheese (more than "warm" will melt it all) and then topped it off with more shredded cheese ~ this also dresses it up as it is not a very colorful appetizer.

OK I made this for the Super Bowl and feel compelled to add my 2 cents.  This recipe by itself looked really bland so I added an extra can of Rotel, a chopped up fresh jalapeño pepper and used Jimmy Dean hot sausage. The recipe does look unappetizing when being made BUT, this was easily remedied. Just add some of that 5 year old turmeric you got in your spice cabinet (adds color but not much flavor since it is so old) and of course some shredded cheddar cheese to it.  Voila nice orange cheese dip that doesn’t use any of that fake cheese food product stuff!  Never mind that pure cheese isn’t really orange but it did make it look a lot more appetizing.  After adding the extras this dip was great and everyone loved it.  Because of the changes that needed to be made I rate it 4 stars instead of 5.

I wish I would've READ MORE REVIEWS of this before making it.  It WAS VERY THICK and kinda BLAH.  So, I fixed it...this is what I did:  Added MORE green chiles/rotel and even jalapenos.  I also added a few green onions, some shredded mexican blend cheese and a wee bit of milk to thin it down.  Hubby LOVED it.  I think by the time I was finished "messing" with it, I was tired of it and couldn't make a fair judgment on the taste of it ~ LOL ~ NEXT time, I'll use HOT sausage and HOT Rotel.  Will be making again (since hubby loved it)...I was looking for something a little different for football game, and this did the trick :)  Thank You!

this was a really good dip. Made this to a T, and it was simple and really quick to make. I used mild sausage mix and a mild can of diced tomatoes and chilies. It was really good and creamy. I could see using a hotter sausage mix in this recipe for my husband.

My family has been making this dip for years--we absolutely love it! We always use HOT Jimmy Dean sausage and HOT Rotel for the kick. Another suggestion, especially for game day: Brown the meat, then toss all of the ingredients into a crockpot. On LOW, it will melt through in four hours, and the dip stays hot for the whole game.

I made this for my monday night football fans in the house and it went over alright. I'm glad I added the  cheese per a previous reviewer cuz it was still bland, even with its addition. If I were to make this again, I would use hot Italian sausage and possible additional chile peppers and more cheese.  However, there are many more dips that are much more "fabulous" than this.

My friends and I have been making this dip for years but we call it 3-2-1 Dip because we use 3 packages of cream cheese, 2 cans of Rot-tel and 1lb hot breakfast sausage. Throw it all in the crock pot on high for about 15 mins to melt the cream cheese, mix it around and then reduce the heat to low/warm. If you're lucky enough to have left-overs, it's good reheated in the mic. I just took this to my dinner club's annual After-Christmas White Elephant party and had to give out the recipe to everyone!

Super Easy!!  I browned the sausage and drained the grease.  Placed browned sausage and one can of Rotel and two blocks of cream cheese into my Crock Pot with temperature set on low for about 3 hours.  Stirred and sprinkled with shredded Cheddar Cheese.  Served with Scoops and crispy ranch crackers along with homemade salsa on the side.  Totally devoured!

As is, unexpectedly good but not very pretty.  My friend modified and I've been using her recipe ever since:  1 package cream cheese, 1 lb tube hot sausage, 1 can rotel, 1 can nacho cheese sauce and 1 package or block of shredded cheddar cheese.  So so good.  I like to serve it from my smaller crockpot; keeps it nice and warm. Go Steelers!!

I guess Im going to be the minority here but I really didn't care for this and ended up taking home a pretty much full crock pot back home when I made it for a family function. The consistancy was pasty and the visual appeal was, well for lack of better words, it looked like puke! Sorry to be gross but honestly, it's not visually appealing at all and the flavor is too acidic...it's missing something.

I made this according to the recipe and was not disappointed. In fact I was really surprised how much I enjoyed it considering I am not a big sausage fan. I made this for a super bowl party and kept it warm in a crock pot. Yum!

Yum, I love this stuff. I used half a pound of hot sausage, 1 cream cheese brick & the whole can of Rotel. We are Rotel lovers. I also added quite a bit of fresh garlic, again we are garlic lovers. Fried up the meat really well, then let it cook with the Rotel just to get rid of some of the canned taste. Great stuff, thanks!

I used a tube of light pork sausage and two packages of neufchatel cheese with a can of rotel. I browned the meat in a skillet and mixed in the Rotel with the cream cheese to melt. Transferred everything to the crock pot and served with tortilla chips. Yum! For low-carb diets, we also had lettuce leaves :)

Excellent change from a regular queso dip!  I used regular breakfast sausage, added maybe a quarter cup of mild cheddar, and half of a tiny tin of jalapenos (strained), to add a bit of a kick.  Everyone loved it!

This dip is really good. Question - does it need to be served hot and remain hot ( in a little crockpot) or can it cool and still be safe for guests?

This dip is PERFECT as written.  I was thinking it was going to need cheddar cheese, but after I taste tested it I knew it didn't need anything.  You can make this as spicy as you want using hotter sausage.  Keep this one handy for your Superbowl party!

This was a great recipe but I felt it was missing something... I added red pepper flakes & garlic salt to the ground sausage as it was cooking & a can of rinsed/drained black beans after adding the remaining ingredients.. It was just what it needed & a huge hit at my company potluck!

This was pretty good, but I think it would have been too bland/boring if I hadn't put diced green onions and shredded cheddar cheese on top. Although I wonder if it would have been better if I cooked for a few hours in a slow cooker as others did.

This was pretty good. I made the recipe "as is" and thought it needed more flavor. I added a second can of hot Rotel tomatoes and a small block of spicy Velveeta. Now THAT was good!

Good, easy dip to make.  You can leave the sausage in as chunks, or put them in a blender to make a creamier dip.

Yummiii, but I made some changes, I used nacho cheese, cream cheese, I didn't have green chiles or diced tomatoes, so I used fresh tomatoes and cilantro and onions, everything chopped really good, and the flavor is  delicious.

We call this "The Dip" in my family. I have to call family members before an event to make sure I am the only one bringing it to a party. It is that good. I would mention the brand name Rotel for the tomatos as they are the best I have found. I also substitute the lower fat version of the sausage and the cream cheese. Enjoy!

No Rotel in this house so I chopped up an onion and a red pepper and sauteed it in just a touch of EVOO and added it with a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I did add a little Frank's Hot Sauce. My husband ate the heck out of this as did my oldest. I thought it would be better with half sour cream. NOTE: I used lowfat cream cheese and I had no issues.

I used a mild sausage in this recipe because I made it for the kids after school snack.  I halved the recipe, pureed the tomatoes (no chunks) and had to add some dried seasonings for flavor.  I added garlic and onion powder and chili powder.  This is a great tasting dip..don't think *fabulous*, but it's definitely does not look tasty.  Thankfully, I was able to talk my kids into tasting it after seeing it.  They did fight over the last bit!  I served with corn tortilla chips (recipe from this site) and pita triangles.  Will make again with the seasonings.

I make this dip all the time. I use a tube of Jimmy Dean's hot sausage, only one brick of cream cheese and a can of rotel tomatoes. It goes fast. Sometimes I double the whole recipe too.

WOW, everyone loved this dip and requested I make more for the OSU v Texas football party this weekend.  I used a hot sausage mixture found in our local grocery butcher department.  It was fab, going to make this a permanent fixture!

I have been making this dip for years-We call it garbage dip because it isn't very pretty. I do use 2 cans of the tomatoes(Ro-tel)and hot sausage gives it a little more heat.It is fantastic, I actually had to cut back on making it because everyone was filling up on dip and not eating whatever meal we had prepared!

I took suggestions from other reviews and used hot picante sauce (16 oz), hot ground italian sausage, light cream cheese, and a cup of finely shredded cheddar.  I was going to add a jalapeno pepper to it, but it ended up spicy without it.  Everybody loved it.

Very tasty, but a little too chunky with the sausage in it.  Probably would be better if a food processor was used to really chop the sausage up fine.

My sister-in-law has made this dip for years!
Therefore everyone in the family has the recipe, and it has become a regular at any family gathering!  The only thing we do different is that we use a jar of salsa or picante sauce.  these new scoop chips are great for it.

Yummy!  I added chopped onion and some cayenne pepper.  
I have finally found the perfect thing to serve this on.  I didn't care for the way it tasted on crackers, and thought it was only so-so on tortilla chips, but I LOVED the way the dip itself tasted, so I kept searching.  Buy 2 cans of crescent roll dough, and instead of rolling it into crescent rolls, seperate it into triangles and bake them flat in the oven.  The come out looking like giant corn chips.  Serve with this dip, it is incredible!!

We call it 321 Dip around here, and make it with 3 pounds of cream cheese, two cans of Rotel and one pound of sausage. It's one of my favorites. In fact, I'm making it for our Super Bowl party this year.

This is the BEST dip ever!!! I will never eat velveeta dip again. Anything with cream cheese is sooo good. 
I brown the breakfast sausage (the one in a tube), 
then add it to my crockpot along with the cream cheese and rotel to melt completely. Serve with tortilla chips. I have received many, many requests for this dip. If you make this, you will not be disappointed. Thank you, Eric!!

I am re-reviewing this because I have made this several times now and it is like the BEST SAUSAGE DIP EVER! Everybody we make it for loves it. I always top it with shredded cheddar cheese. We love it with tortilla chips but pita bread is great with it as well. I prefer to use the spicy jimmy dean sausage but sometimes I have made it with the regular so the little kids can eat it. This is one of my all time favorite recipes from the website!

This is an awesome appetizer or party food.  Someone brought this to a get-together and I was smitten.  Use regular canned tomatoes to reduce the spice is my only change.

I love this dip!  I use Jimmy Dean MAPLE sausage and I add a tablespoon or so of brown sugar after cooking the sausage thoroughly and draining all the oil.  I like the dip a bit sweet.  Then in the end, I add a zing of taco sauce and voila!  Ready to dig in!

This was okay. I wanted to make a dip that wasn't a velveeta based dip. Turned out nicely. I used a 14.5 oz can of meijer brand diced tomatoes with jalapenos in it. This was very easy to make.

A very hearty dip. Used the Jimmy Dean hot sausage with an extra can of Ro-tel.  I used the hot Ro-tel AND the hot sausage, which may be too spicy for some, but was good for my palate.  Really wish Tostitos hadn't discontinued their flour tortilla chip, because I think this would be the perfect chip for this one.  I ended up making my own, baking up some cut up tortillas.

To improve this, add a jar of salsa (I used chipotle salsa), 1 cup shredded cheddar, use spicy sausage and a little cumin. Voila! Tastes great and I agree that it is good to have an alternative to the standard fake cheese dip....

This recipe is a potluck staple... very good. I have made for years. I always use 1/2 hot sausage, 1/2 mild when serving to coworkers. I like to mix in a jar of salsa and garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes and jalapenos on the side !!! I prefer it to the old version with velveeta.

I've been making this dip for at least 12 years. Sooooo good, but I use 1 lb ground sausage, 2 cans Rotel & 3 blocks cream cheese. Literally every time someone new tries it they want the recipe! So easy & so good!!!

I have used this dip in the past and the only change I made was to add about 6 oz. of velveeta cheese. I browned the sausage, transferred it to my 1.5 qt slow cooker, added the rest of the ingredients and switched it to low, stirring often. Be careful it burns easily (I turned it off and on a few times to maintain warm temperature). My family and I didn't think it was bland at all!!

I have been making this recipe for years, just discovered it on Allrecipes today though.  I usually make a double batch using 1lb of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage and 1lb. of Jimmy Dean Mild sausage, turns out just right.  I also do one can of rotel with juice and one without.  on another note, I accidently used the maple flavored sausage one time, very interesting taste. This is a must have for any sporting event.  Take a Prilosec beforehand if you plan to drink some beer with it, the combo can make for some unruly heartburn.

I loved this recipe, it was a huge crowd pleaser and I have been requested to bring it to every party!  Unlike so many, I didn't change a thing!!
(When you change the recipe before even trying it, then all you are doing is making your own recipe, and I don't feel that's fair to the people looking for complements or constructive criticism)
I doubt I'll change this recipe at all, it was wonderful!

One of our party favorites.  I keep it in a crock pot on low, use fat free and low fat cheeses (1 brick of each) and low fat sausage.  Probably doesn't do much, but makes us feel better.  :)  I serve with Fritos Scoops and it is gone first.

I love this and so do all of the guys and gals!  I serve in a football shaped crock pot with Fritos scoops and authentic tortilla chips.  Delicious.  The longer it sits the hotter it gets.  You can use hot sausage if you can handle the heat.  It's great with regular or double the batch and use one of each.

I have made this recipe for years.  My mom gave me this same recipe.  It is addicting!  I use 1/2 pound of regular sausage (a high quality brand) and 1/2 hot sausage.  I find that to be a better taste than to go spicy on the Rotel.  After its made, I put it in a crock pot on low to keep it warm.  I think Fritos type chips are the best with this dip!  Great for all kinds of parties.  My husband likes it as a meal!

Hot or spicy sausage is a must with this recipe.  It's easiest to serve it in a crock-pot to keep it warm. I rarely have any left over, but if I do, it's fabulous mixed in with scrambled eggs for breakfast or put into a torilla along with eggs for a breakfast burrito.

I was looking for something quick and easy that my husband could make in a hurry while I was at work.  This was PERFECT!  He made a double batch for a party we were attending that night and it was completely gone by the time we left for home.  No one could believe how simple it was!  Great recipe.

This was a huge hit, I took it to a party in a small crock pot and the guys ate it up.  I used a mild italian sausage added a little fresh salsa and some sharp cheddar cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

My goodness!  With such an easy list of ingredients, and so small, I couldn't believe how wonderful this stuff was, and of course, both batches were gone!

Note that for a bit of extra kick, a few small red chili's chopped fine and added really does the trick!

I've been making something similar to this for the last 20 years. However I make mine a little differently. Besides the cream cheese I use an equal amount of sour cream as well. That keeps it from being too thick. For the sausage I use mild, but the maple flavored sausage is quite a nice change, too. I use a can of Rotel, but I use the mild. I do not like spicy foods so I've used mild on everything. However you can always use the hotter versions of sausage and Rotel if you like that sort of thing.  This dip always gets scarfed down quickly no matter where I take it.

This was ok but I think it was WAY overpowered by the sausage. Next time I'd probably use half the sausage and cut down on the cream cheese too since it was a LOT of dip.

A huge favorite of my husband & friends. Funny thing about this... women don't seem to be as keen... it kind of has the look of vomit (sorry, I know it's gross) but men absolutely love it, and my hubby's friends ask for it at every game or party. In fact, they go through double, sometimes triple batches. I keep it warm in the crockpot and serve with both Fritos scoops and  Tostitos scoops.

We loved this at our football party! This will be great for any snacking occassion. I cooked up the sausage (I used hot!), drained then I threw everything in the crock pot on low, stirring often, then switched it to keep warm setting.  Oh, I did add an extra can of Ro*Tel like other reviewers said.

1 tube Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, 1 brick cream cheese, and 1 can Rotel tomatoes.  Soooo good. It'll seem too thin at first but once it sits you'll be glad you only added one brick of cream cheese.

I have been making this dip for years. Every time I make it, I always get requests for the recipe. Jimmy Dean sausage and Rotel tomatoes work the best. This recipe is great the way it is. No additions needed!

This recipe was great!! I used Italian sausage, and added crushed red pepper, oregano, and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I browned the meat and then cooked it in the crock pot on low.  Everyone loved it!! Will definately make this again, thanks for sharing!

Like other reviewers, I wanted a break from  the old Velveeta queso dip.  I used the hot sausage and since it was thick, I added an extra can of tomatoes (which also gave it more color).  We enjoyed it with Tostitos Scoops, and when we ran out- Wheat Thins and baked pita chips. 
Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a hit for our breakfast potlucks at the office.  We serve it with tortilla scoops.  Also to make it spicier use different levels of spice of RoTel tomatoes and spicy sausage.  I like the original RoTel with Sage sausage.

This is a great dip. Sausage and cheese and enough cholesterol to clog up Mike Ditka's arteries -- what more could men and all football fans desire?! My only quibble is that it needs more spice. So I add a fair amount of crushed red pepper, paprika, etc.

This is a wonderful dip that I have made for years. I will let you in on a little secret for the uys and gals that like it HOT. Use Jimmy Dean HOT sausage and Rotel Extra Hot Chilis. I also have another secret that I add to it. ACCENT. Its a great additive for those who arent afraid to use it. I always have to quadroople the reciepe for my football fans.

Very meaty and just too heavy for us.  Guess we prefer a creamier dip, although it had a good flavor.

I love this recipe! People always tell others that it's not good- while eating it as fast as they can. The cream cheese is the twist. It's so much better than velveeta!!! THANK YOU!!!!!

I love cream cheese and sausage but not spicy things.  So I love this except there's too much meat to sauce so I doubled the cream cheese and added sour cream to taste. I also added Italian seasoning with the salt and pepper to the meat.

Best ever!  Very addictive.  Even when there is no party, every once in a while, I just gotta make it!  When I take it to work, there is a crowd around it.  We have started to call it Crack Dip because once you start eating it, you can't stop!!!!!

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this for the superbowl! I used 1lb of hot sausage, then sauteed an onion in the sausage fat, added 2 cans of the tomatoes & green peppers, 1 tbsp of sriracha and 2 things of cream cheese and it was delicious with just a slight kick! It was the hit of the party and there was none left at the end of the night. I will be making this again.

Well I finally made this ! This was the first recipe I ever saved on the Allrecipes website. I am happy I got around to it !! This is a very good dip and very easy to make. I made it like the recipe calls for with the exception of adding another can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chilies.  YUM !!  My wife asked for this for our stay at home, do nothing except eat, nap, watch movies and Twilight Zone marathon New Years Eve 2017/New Years Day 2018 couchfest !!  This is good. The wife was obsessed with it !! I liked it too, but for some reason I did not like it that much with the Fritos scoops.  Next time, perhaps some toasted bread squares or  some other type of chip.  If there are leftovers, try throwing some of this dip into some scrambled eggs !! Nice spicy breakfast !!!

Made a double batch of this for the office. Followed directions to a tee. Everyone raved about how awesome it was. It was gone in no time. I don't understand how some say it is bland. It was perfect in my opinion.

Sausage dip has been a staple in my house for years. I think I've perfected it over the years. It takes a little more time than the recipe calls for but I think that it's definitely worth the extra time.i preheat the oven to 350 and let the cream cheese soften while I brown Jimmy Dean regular rolled sausage in a big pot. Season it with a little salt and a bit of white pepper. I drain the fat from the sausage then put it back in the pot with one can of Ro-Tel Original. I let that simmer for about 20 minutes. Then I add the 2 packages of softened cream cheese and mix until it's creamy. I'll let that simmer for another 10 minutes. The final step is to put it in a dish and bake it for 30 minutes. I know it adds a lot of time to a simple recipe but it really does enhance all of the flavors. This dip is requested so often and it never lasts very long. I suggest doubling the recipe. If you're lucky to have any left, it heats up well the next day.

I did not care for this recipe. My husband and I both love cream cheese so I thought that this would taste amazing.  But the consistency was thick and the cream cheese flavor was overwhelming. I will not be making this again.

I got this recipe from my mother-in-law. Except the ingredients have to be very specific for it to turn out fabulous.

Jimmy Deans Hot Sausage
Philadelphia Cream Cheese
Rotel (Medium)

Brown the sausage. Drain.
Then put all of it in a crock pot. It melts and melds all together instead of frying on the stove.

It's to die for. The hot sausage and medium Rotel (tomatoes and green chilies) give it the perfect little kick! Not too much though.

Dip with simple white tortillas.

Note: you can definitely add more of one ingredient if preference calls for!

Yes but we use the Sausage that come in a roll, and we add just 1 8oz whipped cream cheese, one can of petite diced tomatoes, and 1 8oz sour cream.  I brown sausage, add the other ingredients let it heat through then add to a small crock pot and serve with frito or other scoops.  Always addicting to anyone who tries it.

I make this often but I add two cans of Rotel instead of just one.  Sometimes I add one can of black beans well drained and sliced black olives.  It depends on your taste.  I always add a tsp. of ground cumin to add to the spice. Everyone always enjoys this dip with taco chips.  After browning the sausage just put everything into a crock pot on low and forget about it:)

I've not met one person that doesn't love this dip.  The only changes I make to it are what a lot of the other reviewers are saying.  You need to add more spice to the recipe. Then use a small crock pot. Easiest way to add more spice to the recipe  is to use HOT italian sausage. Brown the sausage & then put everything in  a small crock pot. That easy!

Loved it! I cooked the sausage, drained the fat, then used a processor to mix the cream cheese and sausage.  I transferred it to a serving dish and mixed in a can of Rotel.  Next time, I think salsa can be used in place of Rotel. Nice recipe!

Very good dip made it today for Superbowl. I doubled the recipe using 1 lb pork bacon sausage and 1 lb hot sausage. I also added 1 package green onions finely diced. 1 can mild rotel 1 can hot rotel and 1 can lime and cilantro rotel. Then added 1 ( 16 oz ) bag of Kraft Mexican blend cheese. Will be making this again real soon.

This was a big hit at my party over the weekend, not a bite left to be had. I did add spicy sausage and some shredded cheese also a little red pepper flakes for some more flavor, but at the end of the night I had a few people ask for the recipe. All together a great dip. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

It was good. I added some cheddar cheese to make it look more appealing. The white dip with brown sausage just needed a little different look.  Everyone enjoyed.  I used Italian Sausage and one can of Rotel with 2 cream cheese and a few handfuls of cheddar and it was plenty for my superbowl party!

This dip was excellent! Everyone loved it and it went quick! I did not drain the rotel which made a great creamy texture. I used hot jimmy dean sausage and mild rotel, next time I am going to try it with chorizo and reduced fat cream cheese. Easiest dip I have ever made.

Are you kidding me???  I could eat an entire recipe of this stuff.  Crackers, Fritos, Ruffles, doesn't matter.  I could eat it with a spoon.  And so easy.  I always add an extra can of tomatoes too.  My new favorite dip!

We have used this recipe over the summer and football season.... after making cheese/rotel dip for years, this is a refreshing change!

I use Owens bfast sausage, YUMMO! If you like it hot (little kids in my house dont) you can use hot sausauge and hot rotel.

I made this for Super Bowl, also using an extra can of Rotel, plus a chopped up jalapeno and some shredded cheddar.  I used hot italian sausage that I sliced out of the casing and crumbled/browned.

It was amazing.  So easy too.

I was at a superbowl party last night when I found this on the table. I didn't make it, but the person who did told me this was the recipe she used. I thought it was spicy and had a great taste. I noticed a couple of people said they didn't like it. Regardless, I am going to try this one soon, I really liked it.

This was great! Very creamy. I made as written, plus added about 1.5 cups shredded mexican blend cheese. Was a tiny bit on the thick side for my taste, but will make again. Thanks!

This dip has a great taste!  To keep it warm, I would put it in a slow cooker on low heat otherwise you will be microwaving it quite often.

I have made this on numerous occasions.  The bowl is always scraped clean.  I do add a little minced fresh garlic and seve with blue corn tortilla chips.

This is a wonderful recipe. It is so easy to make. I use hot sausage and hot rotel so it doesn't become very "kid friendly". Use mild on both and they will eat it up. Thanks again!
