I made this for Christmas with a couple changes. I used Cran-Raspberry juice for more Raspberry flavor and added two tubs of fozen sweetened raspberries. Everything else I kept the same. It was very refreshing, very tasty and was very pretty to serve for the Holidays!

I served this for a Christmas party I was having - and everybody loved it!  I couldn't find the exact brand of juice called for, so I substituted ocean spray's cran-raspberry juice.  I will definetly make this again!

Delicious! Make the "snowballs" small so that they fit well in the punch glasses. This will probably be a New Year's tradition in our house.

This recipe was very good. Instead of using the fruit juice above I used a Old Orchard brand Cran-Apple juice and Diet Sierra Mist. For the jam I just used some of my homemade strawberry jam and followed the instructions above. It turned out great!

Just made this for a wedding shower. I have never seen punch go like this one did. Everyone loved it! First time I have ever seen an empty punch bowl and I doubled the recipe! Adding the frozen raspberries per one reviewer made a nice presentation as well.

Very good, but not exceptional.  My main complaint is that it is not very cold, even with the ice cream added.

Great punch! I couldn't find the juice either and ended up using Ocean Spray Cran-Raspberry and it turned out perfectly. For the second batch I omitted the jam, and it still tasted great!

The Best. I made it at Christmas time and then ran out and had to end up making more... It was the talk and everyone loved it. I don't drink juice of any sort and I like it as well...Thanks

It was very much enjoyed by everyone at my New Year's party.  I used Cranberry Pomegranate Juice from Sam's club.  It was terrific.

I made this for our family Christmas Eve gathering.  It wasn't bad, I would definately suggest that you use name brand lemon lime drink - I used a store brand and it didn't taste the best.  Also the ice cream made too much foam on the top of the bowl, but that may have been from using a blender in the bowl to mix it all.  Overall it was good, would try again with a few tweeks.

I made this punch at a wedding shower and EVERYONE loved it! It was delicious and easy to make. I would definitely make it again. (I substituted raspberry nectar for strawberry nectar since I couldn't find raspberry.)

A refreshing, enjoyable sweet punch my kids loved on Christmas Eve.  We substituted the Nectar (unable to find) with OceanSpray Cran-Rasp.  Delicious!
