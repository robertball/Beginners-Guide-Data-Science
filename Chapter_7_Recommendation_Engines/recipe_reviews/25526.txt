This is a real hit with the big scoop corn chips. I am always amazed by how many people ask for the recipe. I always add a small can of diced greeen chili and a bit of sour cream to the mix. This is NOT a low cal dish....but worth it!

A delicious dip to serve as an appetizer.  This dip is similar to the Queso dip served at Chili's.  It is quite filling, so I serve with tortilla chips and only one or two other appetizers.

This was sooooooooo good.  We made the mistake of also fixing chili with it too.  This recipe makes a HUGE amount for just two people.  I was warming this stuff up for days!  I couldn't eat too much at one time...  it's pretty cheesy!

Doesn't get any easier then this.  Perfect for super bowl.  I usually double if for a large crowd and put in a crock pot on low for 2-4 hours b4 serving.  Perfect as is or adlib to your own liking.

Very easy to make. Needed to add little more chili powder for our taste. No brainer. Big hit at our Superbowl party.

I managed to find some American Products in a specialty supermarket. They had both Chili with No Beans and Rotel Tomatoes with Jalapenos (as suggested by a reviewer). I decided to use the tomatoes as a dip containing meat seems wrong to me. I mixed the tomatoes with Kraft Chedder Cheese Spread and Sour Cream (to reduce the richness of the cheese) and heated in the oven. The result was outstanding and a bit of extra chili powder made all the difference. Served with warm corn chips. 
Note: anyone from Sydney who uses this site visit 5 Star Supermarket in Crows Nest for American Products.

My go-to queso dip for over 20 years, always a hit. I like it smooth, so I process the chili in my food processor. I've added salsa to the chili, blended with a stick blender before adding the chili/salsa to the cheese. A pinch of chili powder isn't enough. If you like it hot, you'll need at least 2 teaspoons, maybe more. This recipe is so easy to tweak to personal tastes, there's no reason not to try it. It's pretty much impossible to screw it up. We even make it a meal sometimes!

This dip is addicting!  Made it, without the chili powder, for a Superbowl party and it was gone in 15 minutes!  Everyone was raving about it.

This was yummy! I just threw the cheese and chili together into a glass bowl and microwaved and stirred it in cycles until the cheese was completely melted. The only thing is that it develops a skin quickly after it sits out. I think this would probably be best served in a dip crock or warmer and that might fix that problem. Also, I halved the recipe, and it made a ton. I can't imagine how much 2 lbs of cheese would have yielded! I served with scoop chips, which worked perfectly.

I always make this with Hormel chili (there is no substitute). I recommend cubing the cheese so it melts quicker. I have never made this on the stove, always in the micro (just stir it every minute or so until the cheese melts and then transfer to a slow cooker). Absolutely addictive, EVERYBODY LOVES IT!!!! ***Added later***You don't need to add the chili powder either, it adds nothing to the recipe. I get the feeling that the submitter added it just so it wouldn't sound like they were copying the recipe word for word from the back of the velveeta box :).

Definitely one of my kids all time favorite appy's! Because processed cheese food and canned chili is so loaded with sodium I only make this dip using homemade chili and we think the beans add even more yum. Thanks so much Kathleen!

i was never a fan of processed cheese so i'm sure it's just the product itself.  i had to use 3 cans of chili to get people to eat it.  ended up throwing most of it away.

I made half of this recipe and heated it in a small crock pot.  This couldn't be quicker and simpler to put together. This one will be a definite keeper!

This was pretty good for a basic recipe. I had to add a lot more chili powder for my taste, but that's just personal preference. I will also probably try some of the other reviewers' suggestions next time because we thought it needed a little something more. Definitely good though.

This is very good and very cheesy.  I wasn't thrilled with it being so cheesy so I added 2 cans of drained Rotel tomatoes and thought it was perfect with this addition.

I thought this dip was just ok. Easy to make, but way too salty for me. I've never been a fan of processed cheese though. Cooked well in my smaller crock pot and people seemed to enjoy it at the party I brought it to...
