This is a great, healthy recipe! It is difficult to mix, though, because of how few wet ingredients there are. The dough ends up very stiff, and I was mixing with my hands to finish it. 

They are a big hit with the family!

I tried it with dried cherries, chopped; added chocolate chips and some toasted coconut that my husband had left over from muffin baking.  Salt and sugar was balanced well but I'd use a little less nutmeg because its a strong spice.  The mix wasn't dry at all, I think the other reviews must not have put the right amount of butter or they didn't gradually at dry ingredients because I found it very creamy.  Will definatley try again and add nuts.

I made these for Easter, and instead of using dried fruit, I used Jordan almonds from my local candy shoppe, which are almonds with pastel colored candy coatings. Also, I just made them last week with dried strawberries, white chocolate chips, and strawberry extract instead of the vanilla. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These cookies came out moist and tasty.  I used butter and margarine combined. I only needed to bake them for 8 minutes on convection 350' (375' standard).  I used a variety of diced, dried fruit.  Next time I will add nuts for crunch.

This is the best oatmeal cookie I've ever eaten - no contest!  I used a dried berry mix (cherries, blueberries & raspberries) for the fruit, and was generous with the spices.  Otherwise, exact quantities.  I did not find the batter dry at all - I used a Kenmore stand mixer and was careful to add everything in slowly and mixed extensively.  The butter was softened too, which may be the key.  

These cookies, fresh out of the oven, are unbelievably good - just the right amount of salt, chewy but not gluey, melt in your mouth.

The only real change was that mine had to bake for an extra 5 minutes or so (15 total), but keep a close eye - these would not be nice over-done!

Oh boy!  These are great!  Bursting with flavor, chewey & yum!  I doubled the recipie and ran out of butter so used 1C butter & 1 1/2 C butter flavor shortening.  Added cranberries & walnuts and just realized that I forgot the vanilla! Still! they were great!  Don't listen to the dry reviews below, don't know what they'er talking about!  Will absoulutly be making these again!!

I had some dried cherries to get rid of and this oatmeal cookie recipe was just the ticket. I realized that our home did not have any cookies to leave for Santa and I could not let that happen. Ho! Ho! Ho! Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. This is one moist, tasty, cookie recipe.

This recipe was the best oatmeal cookie I have ever made! I used the food processor for the 1st part! I used cranberies, a few chocolate chips & a little coconut! Yum! The batter was easy to scoop by the teaspoon !

Best oatmeal cookies ever!  Used a dried berry mix sample from nutsonline.com that had strawberries, blacberries & blueberries. Added dried apples, dates and raisins to complete the 1 cup called for.  Added dry ingredients very slowly & mixed thoroughly.  The dough was perfect!!  This one will become a new favorite.

This is a lovely easy recipe.  I used a dried fruit and nut mixture that I had in the pantry and it turned out really well.  The mixture was a little dry - it couldn't be "dropped" onto the tray, it had to be rolled into little balls by hand.  The finished cookies were tasty, although perhaps I should have flattened them out a little before baking.  See the picture above to see what I mean.  I recommend these cookies as I think they would be deliciious with other additions as already mentioned in other reviews, such as chocolate chips.

I found it too be a bit salt heavy and not very sweet. I used apricots. They are not too bad though. I promise we will eat them all!

It was perfect as is!!! I blended the egg with the butter and brown sugar with a hand mixer until I saw no more eggs. It makes for easier mixing with the flour mixture. Yummy recipe thank you very much!!

Breakfast in a cookie!  Chewy, fruity, and moist.  Two cookies and a glass of milk will be a great breakfast on the go.  I doubled the dried fruit and added 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  Appreciated the powerful kitchenaid mixer to mix this thick dough.

These were perfect, very moist and flavorful.  Followed the recipe to a 't', using sweetened fruit/fruit cake mix.  Just like my mom used to make.

Family loved it and not overly sweet. My adjustments were using just under 1 c butter but added 1/2 low fat yogurt for more moisture. Used only 1 c brown sugar but also added one cup chocolate chips with 1/2 dried persimmon and 1/2 dried apples.  Only used 2.5 c oatmeal (since I ran out). Even when I forgot about the time and way overcooked the last batch , it still come out okay.

Very, very good.  Used a dried fruit mix from the wharehouse big box store, added some dried cherries and some dried cranberries that I had in my pantry just waiting to be used up.  Also mixed half brown/ white sugars and baked for 10 min.  I will definitely make them again.  Further I think they are a good packable cookie suitable for mailing. While baking the whole house smells great!

I was given some pomegranate-flavored and some blueberry-flavored Craisins and thought I'd use them in this recipe.  I thought they were delicious (pomegranate was my favorite, but both were good).  I did not have any trouble with the dough being too dry; I wonder if other reviewers who had this problem may not have used the correct amount of butter/margarine.  I ended up with 5 dozen 2" cookies per batch, and they were nice and moist after 8 min in the oven.  They came off the pan beautifully.  The only problem I had was that I smashed them together a little and made a bit of a mess with them when I stored them.

Wonderful cookies that have gone down very well  (considering I've made them 3 times now!) with friends and family.

The only changes I made was to leave the salt out, as used salted butter, and used half brown sugar and half white sugar, if your looking for a bit of crunch to your cookie this will do the trick.

Thanks so much for shairing this!!
