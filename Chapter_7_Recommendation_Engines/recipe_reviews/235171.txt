Changed nothing about the ingredients, just tweaked the method of cooking (I have roasted many a fowl in my career).  I preheated my cast iron skillet so that when i laid the chicken in it, the bottom/thighs got a nice sear (keeps the dark meat cooking at same rate as white).  Then, after about 30 minutes on the high heat, i shut the oven all the way off and let the chicken sit in the cooling oven for another 20 minutes.  This lets it continue to cook, but will taper off and seal the juices in.  Just don't open the door!  This chicken turned out so beautiful golden brown, crispy outside, super moist and tender inside.  Thank you chef, for the courage to use so much salt!  :))

My husband thought it was excellent. He said: ..."perhaps the best chicken I ever had!". I had followed your recipe without any change. Thank you Chef John.

My family has always loved roast chicken, so I have made it for years. This recipe is the best I have ever made. The chicken was very juicy, and so tender.  I even made the sauce, and could not believe how good it was and how incredibly simple it was to make. I was out of lemons so I substituted white wine vinegar and it was terrific!  Chef John, another winner. Thanks for the video, it helps.

Okay, it's starting to be that I only want to make Chef John's recipes!  This one is (as always) incredible.  Who knew that roasting a chicken at 450 degrees for an hour would make the moistest chicken imaginable?!  The only slight change I would make (not for me, but for my husband) is to maybe cut the lemon juice in half.  I personally loved it, but he thought it was a little too "lemony".

In response to those complaining about being too salty - I think the secret is the last sentence in instruction line 3: "Wipe excess salt out of skillet with paper towels." If ALL salt is wiped off skillet, there shouldn't be a problem.

We really enjoyed this chicken! I love making whole chickens and do so at least twice a month. This recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird.
It did turn out rather salty, and I used coarse ground kosher salt - but it wasn't inedible salty. (and of course, I expected it to be salty!) I prepared this in my infrared oven which I believe helped the skin to crisp very nicely. The whole thing was a beautiful, uniform golden color. My husband, teenage daughter and I loved the sauce, but my young children didn't care for the lemon flavor of it, so next time I will try making it with white wine in place of the lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again.

I made this with an organic whole chicken and my picky family raved over it! Juicy, crispy crust and not a salty taste. Be sure to brush excess salt off the bird before cutting and plating, so it doesn't get into the rest of your meal.

the chicken was magnificent.   but for some reason, my sauce turned out way too salty.  I'm wondering if I didn't blot out enough oil from the pan.  will try again.

well, I really mucked this recipe...I used sea salt instead of Kosher--didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but it did.  The chicken came out greasy and way to salty tasting, and the jus is inedible.  Sorry Chef-will try again using kosher next time!  I don't think it is proper to give this recipe a rating until I follow it exactly so I will give it a 3 for now.

Delicious!,, And so easy!  I followed it exactly and my husband and I both devoured it !  It was the juiciest chicken that I have ever tried and the easiest.  The sauce was a perfect addition.  Thanks Chef John!

By far the best roast chicken I have ever made! Chef John you are the best. I rarely rate a recipe because I often make changes to suit my taste and it is TOTALLY unfair to do so unless you rate it after following the recipe EXACTLY as written. Kosher salt and wiping out excess salt is a must! Not doing so will cause your bird and sauce to be overly salty. Please follow the recipe to a T.

I know its extremely unusual on this site to follow the directions and ingredients but brace yourself that's just what I did.  The chicken is moist and very tasty and the sauce is really outstanding.  The skin didn't get a true golden brown so the next time I make this I will cook it as directed and for about the last 5 minutes I will turn the oven to broil just to finish off the outside, but that's just for my preference.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yup! Another home run, Chef John!  Getting a roasted chicken that's moist and juicy in less than an hour??? My go to chicken recipe for sure now! And I roast the breast side down. It does seem to make for white meat that's more moist. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Who'd have thought?  Chef Genius!

This was amazing! The chicken was so moist. The gravy, however, didn't work for us. I took the 'salt generously' to heart and the pan drippings were way too salty. It had a great taste under all the salt so we'll try making the gravy again.

Perfect chicken!  As easy as it can get and end result is just as promised,  perfect.  Not too crazy about the sauce because the chicken is that good and the sauce really isn't.  Sorry.  Doesn't need a sauce.

Tried the recipe today and we loved it.  I didn't have any Thyme, so I left it out and it made no difference as far as I was concerned.  To decrease some of the sodium, I used Salt Sense salt which has 33% less sodium; I only used it for the inside of the bird and used the Kosher salt to coat the outside.  Worked just fine with no over salty taste.  Most definitely be sure to wipe all of the loose salt out of the bottom of the pan (I used a cast iron skillet).  We both loved the sauce.  Just the right amount of kick for the chicken which was excellent.  I don't like the breast meat because it's usually dry but this was sooooo good and moist.  As someone who already posted said this is good enough for special dinners and I will most definitely have it for company and for dinner for two.  Thanks for the easy, tasty chicken recipe.  I've never been disappointed with any of the recipes you have shared Chef John.  ***** Ryleesmom

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I just wanted to say that I find it so completely annoying and arrogant when people make all kinds of substitutions or don't follow the recipe as stated and then critize the heck out of it when it doesn't taste good! Hey people..how about trying it as is or if you do change it and it comes out bad, then don't leave any comments at all! Nothing wrong with tweaking or making substitutions if you don't like an ingredient etc., If it comes out good then by all means share! Just don't think it's fair to give low ratings when you've changed the original recipe!

Roast chicken is my Sunday dinner-type comfort food. This is especially easy and turns out "elegant" with the thyme gravy. I think what makes it so juicy is that the salt makes the skin like a seal - it locks the juices in while it roasts, and leaves the skin perfectly crispy.  The beauty is that you can make any gravy or side dish to go with this chicken; its only spice is salt, which goes well with everything! :D Score!

I've made lots of roasted chicken but this was by far the best and easiest.  My family raved about it!  The chicken was great but the sauce took it up to an amazing level of flavor.  I wish all recipes were this easy and wonderful.

We loved this! Made it exactly as described. Now I did have a fresh, locally grown young chicken that was cage free. It was perfect, as promised, moist and with perhaps the best crispy skin ever. Lovely to look at as it came out of the oven. And the chicken was not too salty. However, as some others describe, the sauce was too salty and I had to fool around with it some to balance the flavor. The basic flavor of the sauce was terrific, loved the lemon and the thyme (had some fresh in the garden, which always helps). Next time (and there will be a next time!) I will be extra careful in getting the excess salt out of the skillet.  We love roast chicken and I make it a lot, have some excellent recipes (butterflied and cooked over thinly sliced potatoes in a 500 degree oven is wonderful), but this one is great and the easiest ever.

I too salted the chicken in one pan and then transferred to another pan to cook.  Not too salty that way.  I baked the chicken until the cooking thermometer read 160 degrees F when inserted into the chicken breast.

Moist, was the first thing I thought of for the white meat, very, very moist.  Just salt and it tastes this good, can that be?  It sure was.  The sauce yummy!

I make a whole roasted chicken about twice a month, if not more.  This is the best we've had!  My husband requested to have this once a week, he loved it that much.  This would be great for entertaining - easy and delicious.

This is now my go to method for roasting chicken.  Beautiful skin, tender and moist meat.  Husband's not fond of sauces, but the chicken is still delicious without the sauce.  Coarse ground Kosher salt is a must!

Wonderful recipe.  Incredibly juicy chicken!  Has anyone found Chef John's recipe for his Roasted Red Pepper and Trout Bean Ragout?  I'd love to try that too!

This was awesome!  The chicken was so tender and juicy. I used a 5 + lb. oven stuffer roaster and it was done in an hour which really surprised me. Will be making this again.  Thank you!

I do my Thanksgiving turkey this way and it always comes out tender and juicy. The real secret to this method is to rinse the kosher salt off under running water before adding additional seasoning and baking. Fall off the bone juicy and tender.

The best roast chicken I've ever made.  Sometimes simplicity is a beautiful thing.

Thank you, Chef John, one more time; your recipes are seemingly always spot-on!

I thought it would take my 6 lb. bird longer, so I set the timer for 60 minutes.  It was in the high 180s at that point.  I thought I had ruined it.  But it was beautifully cooked, not over cooked and definitely not raw.
I used the correct salt but salted the chicken before placing it in the pan to avoid the extra salt problem.  The chicken was the most tender and juicy we ever made but it was way too salty. I would try this method again using far less salt.

This was awesome! Very pleased, however I usually just cook for myself and a whole chicken is more than I want to have around for seveeral days. I refrigerated the leftovers but they were not very appetizing the next day. I made creamed chicken and it was delicious.

Wondering if I can use the same method on chicken quarters? What do you think, should I alter the heat? Should I put them on a rack? I'd appreciate any suggestions or encouragement. Bought some quarters today in anticipation.

I was anxious to try this dish and decided to count on Chef John for his expertise to cook, so I cooked this amazing recipe for my son's last home cooked meal before he leaves for college in the morning.  It was a success!! What an amazing recipe and I ALWAYS add my own twist t a recipe but I actually stuck to this one--did increase the amount of sauce though because we love sauce and I am glad I did because it's simplicity was superb!  Served it with roasted asparagus, mashed cauliflower and sliced homegrown tomatoes!! This will be a favorite in my recipe box for sure!

I'm glad I read the reviews before trying this recipe.  I have a big container of sea salt and thought I could use it, but now I see that I would have made a huge mistake.  We love baked chicken and this sounds so good, so off to the store to buy the correct kind of salt and a chicken.

The chicken was deliciously moist, as promised, but I did find the gravy too salty, although I followed instructions and ingredients precisely (I watched the video, too). More importantly, the hot oven meant that the chicken spat all over as it cooked, and the air was a bit smoky. The oven now needs to be cleaned before I use it again. Overall, The tastiness of the chicken wasn't so unique that I would make a mess of my oven again for it.

Home run!  This was awesome!  I can get chicken to fall of the bone, no problem.  But it is never moist.  This was moist and delicious!  The sauce was phenomenal!  Sunday night dinner was a huge success!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I had problems with the high heat causing the chicken to spatter all over the oven causing it to become very smoky. I used a temp probe that registered 160... Let it rest as stated... Underdone!!! I ended up putting it back in the oven for another 15-20 minutes at 350.

I gave it 5 stars for the taste and moistness of the chicken.  My hubby even commented on how the breast meat turned out. I did use about 1 Tablespoon of salt; then after the chicken was done cooking, I rested it on a cutting board, knocking off any loose salt.  I also did NOT add additional salt to the butter sauce nor any cayenne (personal preference). One note: it made a mess in my oven. Since the temperature is so high, it splattered chicken fat/grease all over. I think maybe loosely tenting the chicken until maybe the last 15 minutes, then take off the foil to finish browning good?

Moist meat and easy to make.  I was real careful with the salt, wiped all of it away from pan and even brushed it from the chicken after baking. 3 Tbl spoons of kosher salt was way too much in my opinion. I use kosher salt for most everything.  I didn't use the whole 3 tbl sp and the sauce was still too salty.  Good flavor on the sauce, hence the salty taste.  I am going to use this sauce with my old stand by roasted chicken.

The recipe was way too salty. The sauce was inedible due to salt even after I wiped the pan of all excess salt. The underlying flavor of the sauce was good. The chicken tasted good but no better than with normal convection cooking. I will try again with only 1 tsp of salt on the top only and a little in the cavity. 

The real bonus of this recipe was the high heat used to cook the chicken. I was able to cook a pan full of delicious roasted vegetables that were cooked perfectly after the chicken was cooked for 60 minutes and rested for 10 minutes.

I've made this 3 times in the last month or two, so obviously I like it.  Not sure why Chef John says to season with salt at the end.  No way!  The sauce is too salty already.  Last time I made it, I didn't salt the pan-side of the body and did the salting before putting the chicken in the pan.  This kept the salt in the sauce to a barely acceptable level.  The chicken was still wonderfully moist.  This is a recipe I'll use indefinitely, but not always with the sauce.

I wasn't too sure that I wanted to make this dish, first of all I am not a fan of the breast meat,no matter who does the cooking. It is always too dry for me, so I don't cook whole birds, just the  dark meat. I decided to give this a try, because I like a lot of Chef John's recipes.
I have no idea if I used 3 TBS of salt or not, just eyeballed it. The chicken was outstanding!! The first piece I tried was the breast meat and it was amazing! The chicken was NOT salty at all, just juicy. I did not bother with the sauce, because I am not a sauce person, I personally don't think it is needed, but that's just me.
I think for the people tha said the chicken was too salty maybe you should measure out the salt first. Like I stated earlier I did not measure the salt, so I have no idea if I under seasoned the bird,but the bird was delicious, it had great flavor and color and the skin was crispy.
This is going in my recipe box for sure!!

Would of been a 5 out of 5 if the thigh part of the chicken was crispy like the top and legs where. The breasts where moist and crisp, but the bottom was not edible. Any ideas on how to fix that. Oh yea that sauce WAS 5 out 5! Just need some ideas on how to get the back side crisp.

I wanted so much for this to work!  I read the rave reviews and watched the video - followed the directions to a T: wiped the excess salt out of the pan, roasted for 55 min. till the thermometer read 160, let it rest. It looked gorgeous on the platter!  My husband cut into it while I stirred the sauce - and it was practically raw inside!  He put the cut up pieces back in the oven. I tasted the sauce - it was inedible, so salty!  Once the chicken cooked fully, it wasn't as moist as I'd hoped but still not too bad. I poured out half the sauce and started again with more unsalted broth and made a gravy that was less salty but probably less flavorful.
  What went wrong???
My chicken may have been too large - I didn't really check. I probably should have cooked it longer.  Has anyone done this successfully with a larger chicken?  I used a glass pan - would this affect the result? I really want to make this work next time I try it!

I found this recipe too salty. I made gravy which was very salty.  Very moist but a little tough as it cooks very quickly.

No changes at all, but I didn't care for the flavor.  Seemed salty and the sauce had too much thyme in it. The recipe is fine, I just didn't care for the end result.

Didn't change anything.  Moist, tender and delicious.  Next time,  I will try to wipe all the salt  off thats left on the chicken after roasting. The skin was perfect, just the remaining salt was too much. The sauce was too salty as well. I will do again. Very good.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic.  The chicken was moist and juicy and I did not find it salty.  I almost didn't make the sauce which would have been a huge mistake.  It was wonderful.  I made it using 1/2 lemon juiced and a little white wine and it was perfect.  Another hit for Chef John!

The salt made the skin very crispy but inedible. I cleaned out the salt religiously as prescribed by the directions, and the 'excess fat' left in the skillet when the chicken was done. The resulting juices from the chicken and the rest of the bits in the skillet made the sauce extremely salty and inedible. Done with this one.

I made with a chicken my grandparents raised and the only thing I didn't quite do the same was the amount of salt. I used 2 instead of 3 tablespoons. Chicken turned out great, the sauce was totally awesome and everyone loved it. Thanks chef John for your great recipe!

Yes, yes, and yes! The best white chicken meat we ever ate! I used "Himalayan Natural Crystal Salt" and reduced it to 1.25 tbsp at medium grind since it's much denser than the flaky "Kosher Salt". Chef John, you're a genius. Paired it with a fragrant Pulao and it was the most exciting Tuesday we've had in a while.

Best Roasted Chicken I have ever had. The first time I made this my children asked for seconds. I've made this 3 times already in the last month. I even made it with legs and thighs and it came out equally delicious.

Excellent! The chicken was juicy and the skin crispy plus it tasted wonderful. Made exactly per Chef John but my chicken was a 5.25 lb organic chicken so roasted at 450 for i hour and 20 minutes, then lowered heat to 375 for another 25 minutes. When the legs moved easily I knew it was done. Sauce smelled great and was sooo tasty. Husband loved it saying it was so tender and good.(He had been afraid that my roasting a chicken at 450 would ruin it-haha!)Another home run from our Chef John!!

I'm so thankful for good food like this - it keeps it so interesting and keeps me cooking. This recipe is so easy. I used only 2 T. kosher salt and that was plenty for me.  Salt was not needed for the sauce; it was salty enough from the chicken. The meat was juicy and slightly salty, which I love salt, and the skin was crispy and very salty. I couldn't resist the skin either. The tangy sauce over the meat was so delicious with a pungent lemony thyme taste.  On second try with this recipe I changed it to 4 stars because of instructions to bake chicken in a skillet.  The first time I tried recipe I used a rack for the chicken and it was perfect then I tried to do it in my heavy iron skillet and while baking, grease was popped all over the oven. Maybe if I had used a  stainless skillet like Chef John in the video it wouldn't have happened.  I had to dispose of my reusable oven liner and replace.  Then I had to thoroughly clean my oven.  The racks were very hard to get clean and those have to be hand scrubbed.  Thankfully I have a self-cleaning oven because it was coated with grease!  Even with the fan on the fire alarms went off about 3 times - Ha! I suggest using a poultry rack or a slotted broil pan to cook.  Thanks Chef John.

The salt was a the main flavor of the chicken, but if you like salt then you'll love this recipe. I'll make this again with a more controlled portioning of salt.

Ok here is what I did, I followed the recipe, I salted the inside first, then the back, and finally the breast. I even made sure that I bought a 3.5 lb. bird AND I measured out the Kosher salt.I have made this at least 1/2 dozen times ( without the measuring) and it has been perfect everytime.
Just an update, I cooked a 13 lb. turkey and an a lot of cornish hens using this method, and once agian perfection. The only thing I changed was the amount of salted needed for each bird.

Sorry, Chef John.  I love all your other recipes I've tried, but not this one.  We couldn't eat the meat closest to the skin because it was so salty.  It was juicy.  It worked well in a soup recipe.  Just couldn't eat it as made.

I didn't want to do a whole chicken, so I did chicken thighs. I only baked it for 40 min and it was enough. Although I didn't do the sauce quite right, it still tastes great. It's almost like fried chicken, without the fried... Thanks. I'll make this again for sure.

i made this and it turned out awesome but i put my chicken in a brine overnight of saltwater and sugar.(the brining process is a must try if you havent.. chicken comes out even juicer and more flavorful depending on what you use in your brine) and also i found my sauce was a little salty but i added some milk to cut the saltiness

Have made this recipe twice in one week because my pickiest child, who has the hardest time trying and liking anything new, went crazy over it. So did the rest of the family. If there is anything left over, you can make a delicious chicken salad for lunch! Chef John, if you were a beautiful woman I would ask you to marry me!

I've got to give it 4 stars, because as nice as the skin is, I've had better tasting roasted  chicken. The meat was moist and just fine, but it lacked the flavor of some other techniques.

Really delicious, moist chicken and an outstanding sauce.  Not nearly as salty as I had feared.  This recipe is going into my personal hall of fame recipe folder.

One thing I am convinced that makes a big difference is buying a whole free range chicken.  I only use fresh thyme, if I have it on hand.

ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. Absolute simplicity. Do make sure your chicken is DRY and at room temperature. I  definitely added this to my arsenal.

For those looking for the Trout Bean Ragout recipe that goes with the Salt Roasted Chicken, here's the word straight from Chef John: 

"Ah! Sorry, no recipe really. I just stewed the beans with some diced celery, onions, and tomatoes. Any bean ragout recipe will work, just use trout beans. "

Simply google "bean ragout" for all kinds of recipes. As always, enjoy!

Was sooo good and tender, and simple!  I have the chicken breast side down for 30 minutes and flipped it over for another 15 minutes and it was done!  I didn't have a oven safe pan so I used a glass dish and then transferred some of  the dripping  and added some butter to make a gravy with a roux using a sauce pan - adding chicken broth, tyme (not fresh - didn't have) and paprika, served over mashed potatoes.  My kids devoured it!

Great recipe for roasted chicken. It was golden brown, and the meat moist and succulent.  The sauce was a delicious compliment! Definitely a recipe that I will make again!

Had brined chicken so cut back on salt on chicken when it cooked.  Skin was crispy and meat had a nice taste.  Will use full amount of salt next time and not brine.

Sorry, this was awful, way too salty. It was so salty, I couldn't eat the skin, ... which may be a blessing, so thanks for that. I will still be a loyal follower, salt, "and, cayenne pepper" aside !

Chef John's recipes are always excellent and I absolutely loved the method of cooking this chicken.  It was so moist and even with a 5 1/2 pound chicken it was done in 55 minutes.  I have made this twice and the first time the sauce came out much better than the second time.  Made this last night and I ended up with a very potent sauce.  It was too salty and, no,  I certainly added no extra salt to the sauce.  I think I just put too much on the chicken to start with and the juices inside the cavity that I poured into the sauce must have been too much.  Also, I had a very large lemon and maybe too much lemon juice.  Nonetheless, the sauce was ok for me because I used just a small spoonful on my food.   The leftover sauce will be added to a pot pie or whatever I end up doing with the leftover chicken.

Great recipe!   Made it just as written with the exception of using dried thyme because I did not have fresh.  I would not change a thing.   The chicken was very flavorful and tender.

Whole family loved this.  Turned out super juicy and flavorful.  My sauce didn't come out right, my fault, I missed a lot of salt when I wiped the pan I guess, and the sauce was too salty.  I will be making this again soon, so I will fix that.  Great chicken though!

One of the tastiest roast chicken recipes I've ever tried. Also, dried the technique on the Big Green Egg and it was equally successful. Thank you Chef John. You never disappoint.

I made it as written, just love Chef John’s recipes, always works as written. Never had a problem with any of his recipes.
     Chicken looked just like the video but mine did not have any slits in the skin??. Nice and flavorful, moist and definitely not salty which surprised the heck out of me considering the amount of salt used, kosher salt is a must though.

Easy to make and the meat was very moist with a great flavor. As another user posted the sauce was way salty, even after making sure to wipe out excess salt before roasting and blotting the pan after. I think I would blot out all the pan drippings before deglazing next time.

I had an organic chicken I wanted to roast. Typically I slather them in veg oil and seasonings as I love a crisp chicken. 
This method was so wonderful and fool proof, I did not make the sauce. As promised it was crisp on the outside and moist inside with no salty taste. Magic! The leftover chicken went into the soup.

Easiest chicken ever!  So delicious.  I now roast a chicken  weekly with this method (no sauce), to use the chicken in making other Chef John recipes!  (Etouffée, Tinga, Chicken noodle soup, etc).  I then use the bones to make a bone broth (3 hrs in an Instant pot with an onion, carrots, garlic, celery),  that I also use with all those same recipes.  It’s fabulous!

I made this recipe and served it to my family for Sunday dinner.  The chicken was juicy and delicious, and the sauce was a hit.  I made a lot of sauce using herbs de Provence (instead of just thyme) so that we could also drizzle it over the vegetables I served with the chicken.    It is hard to believe that you can cook a whole chicken on one hour--but you can!  I'll never cook a chicken any other way

I love this recipe, I make it exactly as written about once a week.  If I have any advice it is to use a little less than 3 TBSP kosher salt if your chicken is on the smaller side.  If my chicken is smaller I use about 2 TBSP and it’s excellent!  Thank you, chef John!  I’ve never made one of your recipes and it not be great!

The chicken came out beautifully browned and crispy skinned; wonderfully moist and tender. I found the flavor exquisite, however a couple of my guests felt it was a bit too salty tasting. Also my gravy came out very salty, and I suspect I was not careful to get all the excess salt out of the pan after salting the outside of the chicken. So I will review the steps I made to see if I made any other mistakes or was just heavy handed with the salt.
I will definitely make this chicken again, but with more care to all the details

It was so delicious.

Chicken was exceptional moist. I baked a larger chicken (almost 5 lb.) so I added an extra 10 minutes.  I think 5 minutes would have been enough. I must not have done a very good job of getting the salt out of the pan prior to baking because sauce was very salty. 
 I did find a recipe for "Polenta with White-Bean and Roasted -Pepper Ragout" (Martha Stewart) and served the chicken over that. - Yum!

From the video I was expecting much more than what I got in the final product, which is a very salty but moist chicken which is only a little balanced with the salty butter sauce. I usually really like Chef John's whole bird recipes, but I probably won't make this again. I took the Chef's instructions to be generous with the salt and the final product looks just like the pictures, which it just too salty. This is more of a 3.5 star recipe, and there are much better ways to roast a chicken.

Chef John has done it yet again!  This one is another winner!  Super easy and amazingly juicy and tender.   I followed the instructions precisely.  The skin came out crispy and golden brown and the meat was succulent and so, so juicy, it was perfect.  Not too salty at all, it was just right.  Hubby loved it and I loved how simple it is to get crazy good results.  Thanks again Chef John!

Chicken comes out moist & very flavorful for such an easy recipe. Will try stuffing the cavity with different herbs & spices. Overall it will be the way I roast chicken from now on.

Made it as it said, came out great. Took less time with convection roast and I preheated a cast iron skillet beforehand but then it splattered my oven, so I think I won’t preheat the skillet next time-follow his instructions and it will be delicious and tender.

Amazing! This one is a keeper! I did use a little less salt - 2 Tbsp. Moist throughout and the flavoring is perfect. My wife claimed it was the best chicken she ever had!

This was so good and so easy! It will be the only whole chicken recipe I will use from now on. The sauce was good but I had to wash cast iron skillet before making. The salt and oils had bubbled out and hardened in pan while cooking. It would have been way to salty to use. It was fine without drippings but honestly, chicken was so good it didn’t need a sauce.

Finally got around to making this last night.  It was really good but very salty (and I'm a salt-o-holic!).  The skin was too salty to eat unfortunately but the chicken and the sauce were awesome.  I used a 6 lb chicken and cooked it at 450 for 90 minutes in a Dutch oven so didn't experience the grease splatter others did.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use 3 full Tbsp of salt
I will definitely make again but use significantly less salt.  I may also try to double the sauce-it was that yummy!

Made this using a whole chicken I found in the back of the freezer that had been there for 4 years.  Didn't use thyme or lemon since hubs doesn't like them.  Best chicken ever!  The breast was very moist & super tasty.  Will try again with a fresh chicken - although it couldn't be any better than this one.  Thanks Chef John for a wonderful recipe!!

Changed nothing on the ingredients and my husband and son loved the sauce!  The chicken came out nice and brown but I think my thermometer was off as it wasn't fully cooked on the inside.   I sliced up the bird and microwaved until meat was done.  I would love to be able to double the sauce if that's possible!  I will make it again and use another reviewer's suggestion on  the  cast iron pan and pre heat it before putting the chicken in it .  This is going into my favorites and I had no problem with the salt.  The only thing I did do was salt the chicken on a plate before putting it in the skillet to cook.  Maybe that will help others who said it was too salty.

This was delicious! I have been roasting chickens for 30 years and was hesitant to roast it for an hour at 450 but it was perfect. My husband and I both thought it was the best we have ever had. I didn’t change a thing. The sauce is light and refreshing.

FOLLOW THE RECIPE, ITS DELI! 
-For the butter sauce, if you don't like to much acidity cut it in halve.  (I personally loved it) 
-Preheat the skillet and lay the chicken in it, so it sears the thighs. 
- Make sure the chicken is on room temperature for evenly cooking. 

ENJOY!

My theory: the salted skin becomes impervious, and  (at least on the breast), inflates. The meat inside is steamed, more than roasted. Be careful when using the pan juices from the bird in any sauce,: taste them first, they may be too salty.

Today is thanksgiving and it was just two of us along with two small kids, so we didn't want to cook the entire turkey. We ran across this recipe and decided to give it a try and wow, very flavorful, moist, and a keeper! Just a minor adjustment... sprinkle salt under the skin and rub. We did not have a oven-safe skillet so we used 9x13 glass pan instead, and scrapped what was left onto skillet and it worked just fine. The only parts we ate today were the breasts and the tenderloin... and we're thinking about using the body for the broth and the meat for the soup. Hmm, experiment experiment! :)

This was a salt bomb.  Way too salty.  After I cooked looked up the sodium and it's way more than someone should have all day.  No wonder it was so salty

I just love this recipe.  This is one of those recipes you think is not going to be that good at first since its so simple, but you'll be very surprised at how much flavor comes out of such few ingredients.  I always get requests to make this chicken.  I've probably made this about 8 times.

We have made this recipe many, many times and we always say the same thing...."Why don't we make this more often? It's so simple and delicious!" We are big Chef John fans and this recipe is one of his best! We change nothing and follow the recipe exactly. We always make two chickens and hope there will be enough for leftovers!

I thought I had the perfect roast chicken recipe but this is absolutely the best.  Only wish I had carved it instead of digging into it like a caveman!

The lemon thyme sauce is excellent. I've made this twice and both times it came out significantly undercooked even though I use a 3.5 lb chicken. Both times I cut into it after letting is rest and the juices ran out red. I also think 450 is an awfully high temperature. If it were not for the tasty sauce, I would not use this recipe again.

I was afraid I'd overdone the salt (I used pink Himalayan salt instead of kosher because that's what I had) and leery that with that much salt and that high of heat for that long, I'd end up with a piece of wood for dinner, but it turned out FABULOUS!!  And that sauce???!!! Chase little morsels of juicy chicken around the pan to soak up every single drop!  I should know never to doubt Chef John!  (and it was great even without cayenne)

Even though I cooked the chicken past 160, by mistake, the breast meat was rich and juicy.  The recipe is very easy and the result is spectacular.  One question - the picture looks like you can eat the skin, but I found it inedible due to the amount of salt.  Did someone out there have a different result?  Did I use too much kosher salt when I covered the bird?  (I had a 5+ lb bird, so the amount of salt and the cooking time had to be estimated.)

I made this today. First time I never baked a chicken at that heat, and it was excellent. The white meat was nice and moist and the bird looked like a picture. The only thing I didn't use was the lemon, but everyone loved it. I took it out of the over and checked the temperature, and returned it to the oven for 15 more minutes. Perfect. I will never make it any other way, as my white meat always was dry. Not so with this recipe. Thanks again.

I prepared a 5-lb chicken in a 12" cast iron skillet (preheated in a 425-degree convention oven). It only took one hour to prepare and the resulting chicken was definitely tasty and juicy. BUT be prepared to have to clean your oven afterwards. The high-temperature roasting makes the chicken kick out a lot of grease during that one hour. I probably won't make this again until I need to run the cleaning cycle again - kind of a last hoorah.

Absolutely delicious. A new household favorite. I'm wondering if the salting method will work on pork too. I may have to give it a go.

Best ever roast chicken! It will become a regular dish for sure! Didn't have kosher salt so used regular salt - I'm sure the kosher will be better next time. The sauce elevates this to a whole another level - so yummy. I roasted potatoes, carrots and onions on a sheet pan but I think rice would work better with this because of the sauce! Highly recommend this recipe!

Juiciest chicken I've ever made. A 4.88 lb chicken took 47 minutes in my oven. Skin didn't brown and I had to scrape salt off after cooking as shown in video, but so worth it. I didn't bother to make the sauce. Thank you.

My wife loves this recipe, I've made this chicken about 6 times now and my wife always compliments how juicy the meat is  and the nice crisp skin. Sometimes I use a larger chicken and just increase the time accordingly.

Love this recipe! 
I have made this several times since I found this recipe. The first time i added too much lemon juice, the second time I didn't wipe out the salt. The third time, it came out perfect and has ever since! If you have not tried it,please do. You will not be sorry.

My family loved it and they want to make it a recurring meal. I had trouble cooking it though. The sauce, although tasty, refused to thicken, so it seeped into the rest of the food on the plate. The chicken was melt in your mouth delicious.

It's pretty incredible that just salt can produce such a juicy, delicious chicken. The sauce was also excellent. I used 1 T. olive oil rather than 2 T. butter. I drizzled some of it over the barley I made as a side dish, and it was great. The chicken was rather salty, hence the four star rating, but I'll still be making it again.

Muy sencillo y delicioso. Mi unica recomendacion es que guardes mas grasa del pollo para combinar con el limon porque es tan deliciosa que todos quieren agregar mas arriba de su pieza de pollo.

This is the best and easiest  chicken.. I use the recipe exactly as written.  Once I accidently cooked it a 400 instead of 450 and it did not turn out as well as when cooked at 450. It is the only way I roast chicken now.

This was how chicken was roasted when I was growing up. We didn't have a lot of different spices and herbs available like they are now. Salt, pepper, parsley and sometimes garlic powder or onion powder made up the seasoning mix. I had forgotten how good plain old salt and pepper roasted chicken was! I really like the high heat roasting. I cut my chicken in half which reduced the cooking time even more. This is a delicious back to the basics recipe!

Since coming across this recipe...I must make this chicken at least once a month. Everyone loves it...the flavour is fantastic, the chicken skin is crackling and the chicken stays so moist. Leftovers make great sandwiches or chicken salad.The juiciest roast chicken I have ever roasted. Easy recipe.

My husband and I loved this chicken.  Sauce was a bit salty, but I did not clean excess salt out of pan before baking.  We just drizzled a tiny amount over chicken, wished we had cooked two!!

Really very good flavour and certainly most. I did two chickens at once and was surprised how quickly and nicely they cooked.  I used sea salt, both coarse and ground course and it worked out great.

The sauce came out out really well, fresh lemon is the key there.  I did use a bit of cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken it up a bit more as I know my family prefers it a bit more gravy than sauce, tasted good either way!

Excellent!  Didn't change on thing and the chicken along with the sauce came out perfect! Only wish I would have taken a picture because it was a vision of beauty.  Thanks, Chef John, for a delicious meal.

No changes, used a bigger bird about 4.5 lbs took an hour and fifteen. Could be the best way to cook a whole chicken. If you like the way a beer can chicken comes out, save the beer to drink with this version of roasted whole chicken. The sauce was a perfect match. Thank you chef John.

I'm still learning and the chicken I had was too big.  The pan I had wasn't really big enough for the chicken.  All in all, the chicken came out juicy and tender.  It didn't come out as crispy and brown as I would've liked, but that's more than likely because of the size of the bird and the skillet.  Also, I think next time I will use white wine instead of lemon juice in the sauce.  My daughter was fine with the flavor of the sauce, but it was a little too tart for me.  We still enjoyed it and I will make this again for sure!

Did everything as Chef John said, especially cleaning up all the spilled salt in the pan before roasting.  Only thing different, was that I stuffed it with my own bread stuffing.  It was fantastic!  I printed the recipe May 6/16.

Welcome to the salted chicken club!  I have been making Cornish game hens this way for some 40 years now, but using regular table salt.  Those who want smaller servings of chicken might try that too!

I  followed the directions exactly as written and the chicken was delicious!  After I removed it from the skillet, I brushed off the salt from the chicken's skin before I sliced it. It had a wonderful flavor. I plan to serve it at my next dinner party.

My husband thought I had bought the chicken from a restaurant. He loved it! The only thing I didn't add was the sauce. My husband is a very picky eater and the thyme on the sauce recipe wasn't gonna do it for him. I do believe that the Kosher Salt had a lot to do with the cooking process and the taste. I wouldn't risk using sea salt. Anyways, we used the left over chicken for enchiladas the next day, which were excellent! Thank you Chef John for this chicken recipe.. I will be making it again!

Best chicken ever.  so juicy and flavorful.  not at all too salty tasting.  I have made this five times and make two at a time as I have three son's and a husband that are very hungry come dinner time.  is it just me or are whole chickens smaller than they use to be?

this was excellent and I'm making it again tonight.  Did anyone else have a smoke bomb when you removed the chicken from the oven (i have a therm..it was 450)?  I had to run it outside to stop smoking....I think I'll try 400 tonight!

The chicken is outstanding, and even better that it cooks quickly and is ridiculously easy to prepare. The sauce, however, just wasn't to our liking. But I will definitely roast chicken like this again, sans sauce.

MEH...the same as oven roasted chicken with lemon.  It is easier to roast a chicken with lemon, salt, pepper and olive oil.  It was good, but not worth the extra work of making the sauce.  I had fun preparing but will stick with the more simple method next time.

Delicious sauce.  Juicy chicken.  Didn't change anything except used bottled lemon juice (ran out of lemons) - about 2 tbl, which made it very lemony but we liked that.  Tastes a lot like Grecian chicken.

We loved this simple and delicious recipe. The chicken was moist and flavorful and not over-salted. The sauce had just a tad too much lemon juice in it so next time I'll proceed more cautiously with that ingredient.

It was delightful!  Easy and full of flavor. Use your own judgment for the salt.  If hypertensive use less. I did and didn't lose any flavor.

As advertised, "easy and delicious”.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful and provided some great leftovers. I generally don’t do “gravies” but thought I try this one and it was great over plain boiled potatoes. A nice alternative to just putting butter on them.

I am an empty nester and found an excellent variation. try it with a Cornish hen  The bird is much  smaller so adjust the cooking time (I went by temp)  Other wise kept everything the same.  It was fantastic.

I love the way this was made. I thought all the salt and my blood pressure it would be salty, but it looks great. Also I cook for my Sheltie's (SERVICE DOGGIES) and salt too much is not good but this they will be able to eat. They eat lots of chicken.

This chicken is AMAZING.  When I want to roast a whole chicken, this is the one that we always go to.  I don't change anything, except to increase the cooking time because we tend to get chubby birds.  Try it, you won't regret it!  If you are going to use the carcass for soup, you might not want to salt the cavity as it will make your broth a little on the salty side.

The best/easiest roast chicken recipe ever.  The meat was so juicy and flavorful.  I will make sure to get as much excess salt from the pan bottom before I cook next time because the sauce was really good, but too salty for my family.  Also, I didn't have any fresh thyme so I used dried.  It was still good, but next time I hope to have fresh on hand.

It was so simple to make. I used regular salt instead of kosher salt. It had my fiance coming back for more. It was tender and so so SO juicy. I think I messed up the sauce, however. It came out too lemony and too buttery. I tried it and almost threw up. Nevertheless, this chicken was a star. It needed no sauce. I am making this again.

Amazing roast chicken!  Super easy prep, I loved cooking the chicken in a saute pan & then using the same pan to easily make a sauce.  The whole family loved it!

Great recipe!! I added 1 medium sized chopped sweet onion and 3 stalks of chopped celery around the chicken about half way thru the baking time. It turned out EXCELLENT! Definitely will make this dish again!!

This is the best chicken you'll ever taste, and couldn't be easier.  I used the same method for a turkey breast tonight because we had been away for Thanksgiving and wanted some turkey left-overs.  It was out of this world!   I even used about the same time as for a roast chicken, and it was perfectly cooked and moist.
Thanks for this amazing recipe.  I am always surprised it does not taste salty at all.

I was really surprised with this one. I usually like extravagant recipes and was skeptical of using only salt. I was blown away by this juicy chicken and its crisp and salty crust. My picky five year old loved it! I'm making this again right now!

Was very good.  Didn't need a rack, as others have preferred.  Made as directed with no changes.  The sauce was salty on it's own, and maybe a tad bit less lemon, but poured over the chicken and served with whole grain rice, it was delicious.  Wish I would have been able to double it.

we really enjoyed this.. but unfortunately found the sauce to be a bit on the salty side.. i salted my chicken on a separate plate before putting it in my cast iron skillet so wiping out the excess salt wasn't the issue.. i think next time i make this i'll use water instead of broth.. only deviation was subbing dried rosemary for the fresh thyme.. bf said this was just as good as chef john's chicken and mushroom dish (which is a frequent meal in our home).. i almost forgot to comment on how awesome the skin was.. i only eat the skin if it's nice and crispy.. it was excellent.. i look forward to trying this again soon.. ty for the recipe

Outstanding!  We raised our own chickens, so the freezer is full.  This recipe is beyond phenomenal and I am getting ready to make it again right now.  Last time, we finished dinner, then as we were sitting at the table talking, we ate more chicken - tearing off bites, then chasing the sauce around the platter.  It just does not get any better than this!!  Tonight, pairing it with potatoes we dug today as well as zucchini and tomatoes from the end-of-summer garden.

Really simple and amazing flavor for just salt.  I just loved the thyme butter sauce with it.  I used dried thyme and it was still very good.  I have always cooked my chicken to 165 degrees in the thigh so I did that again.  The temperature at 55 minutes was 159, so the timing for the recipe was pretty accurate.  I did have some pink near the bone even cooking to 165 but I am not very good at not hitting bone when testing chicken.  The flavor was awesome.  The skin was crunchy.  It looked beautiful out of the oven.  5 stars for sure.

Yes!!!!  This was PERFECT.  The skin was crispy and flavorful, and the inside was juicy and just perfect.  I did have quite the smoke problem cooking it, so I had to open up all of my windows.  It was all worth it.

I love this recipe.  Reminds me of when my husband and I used to do rotisserie chicks with a tablespoon of salt inside and they were wonderful!  The salt worked its way through and permeated the meat.  I couldn't do it without the grill/rotisserie until Chef John came up with this recipe.

My rating is based on the recipe as is, but I have made it with both fresh herbs and dried.  Dried was almost just as good, if you don't have fresh thyme on hand, don't scrap this recipe!  Very easy prep and the end result is a crowd-pleaser!

The chicken was very well cooked & juicy, but 3 tbs salt was over the top.
Also, my oven was a mess from splattering chicken - used a cast iron skillet.  Got to go - cleaning my oven!

I made this exactly as directed, using a 4 1/2 pound chicken.  I set the timer for 70 minutes and it was well over the desired temperature when I took it out of the oven.  It was so moist and tender, but a little too salty for me. The skin is crisp and brown but don't eat it.  The salt keeps the meat moist. I did not need any additional salt in the sauce.
I have made this chicken at least 3 or 4 more times since the first time.  It always comes out juicy and tender.

Chef John does it again! I was skeptical about just adding salt to the chicken before roasting, but I followed others' advice and the result was AMAZING! The chicken alone was moist and juicy, but the sauce...that put it over the top.  Will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation.

Since discovering this recipe, I don't roast chicken any other way. I do put a little less butter in the sauce than Chef John recommends, but the combination of this dry roasted chicken and the buttery lemon sauce will make you swoon -- especially if the chicken is organic. Just to die for!

Genius. I made the recipe, and the sauce, exactly as the recipe indicated. Wow! The chicken is moist and simply delicious. Plus, it looks fantastic. Love the sauce. A bit too lemony for my husband so next time I will use white wine. I can't believe how simple this is and the result looks like you worked really hard for the effort. And clean up? Can it get any easier?  Thank you Chef John!

This is the best chicken I have ever made!  It's almost like magic when you consider how juicy it comes out.  My whole family loves it.  In particular I love the fact that there is basically no prep other than salting the chicken.  The sauce is also super easy, and to die for, so we double the recipe.   We love capers so added them to the sauce. Yummo!  Our only complaint (which is not Chef John's fault!) is that it is tempting to grab the hot skillet handle once you take it out of the oven.  Both my husband and I have accidentally done this even though we warn each other not to.  Once we placed a quilted oven mit over the handle to remind us and it literally melted the insides.  Oh well, the chicken is so good that it is worth it!

I've made this three times now, each time with split breasts instead of whole chicken.  The last time was for a benefit dinner with 12 guests.  All raved!  This is so simple, easy and delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I only had chicken breasts, so I just used those instead. And instead of thyme, I used parsley and instead of Cayanne pepper, I used crushed red peppers. But other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great! Will definitely be using it in the future!

So simple and delicious.  There is a ton of salt to this recipe and I did not get enough out of the pan before making the lemon sauce.  I added just a touch of sugar and that evened out the saltiness nicely.  The chicken itself was incredibly moist and delicious.  This will definitely be made many, many times

I have to give this a 5 star...    I didn't have all ingredients for the sauce and even though I didn't it was lovely.    The chicken was soft...   I totally loved it!!   The kids liked the sauce which is crazy because they don't like any kind of gravy.   Just lovely... can't say enough about it.

Wow, this is the best roasted chicken ever, I didn't know white meat could be sooo moist! I followed the recipe exactly, no changes.  The chicken comes out of the oven a beautiful brown with crisp skin.  Did I mention how moist it is?  All that being said, it was a little salty for me (yes, I wiped the pan & used coarse kosher salt) but I've been on a low sodium diet for years so I'm very sensitive to salt. My husband thought it was perfect as it. I'll experiment with a little less next time.  The sauce is fabulous.  Thanks Chef John!

It really is surprising how this technique produces such moist and flavorful chicken.  I used 2 Tbsp. salt, and it was amazing.  We loved it.  I didn't take time to make the sauce, but it looks good.

This was wonderful! Usually no one changes anything with John's recipes, which is nice! I think next time I will cook it in my iron skillet in idirect heat on my gas grill, though. Made quite a mess of my oven. Maybe it's because I bought a Fryer instead of a Roasting chicken?

Very good - chicken came out soooo juicy!  Made this twice - the first time I wasn't impressed with the sauce - too thin. So the second time I just used the chicken drippings to make a quick pan gravy - much tastier IMO.

Chicken was tasty but skin wasn't crisp. Sauce was inedible, even to my husband who loves strong lemon flavor. I might use the technique again with a gravy.

Nothing short of amazing!  This method seasons the chicken all the way through.  We used the same instructions for the sauce but tweaked some of the ingredients that are more to our liking.  We will absolutely be using this recipe again!  And again.  And again.  And again!

I made this tonight.  It was excellent.  I didn't have chicken broth, so used a tiny bit of Swanson's Flavor Boost, and a small splash of dry Sherry.   The house smells wonderful.  As another said, be sure to brush off excess salt, and I let it sit for over 15 minutes.  I think if you stick to the basics on this It would be hard to mess up.  Also be sure to check after 50 minutes.  Mine was more than done, but still juicy.

Way too much salt in the sauce.  He said he is guessing at the measurements, and I think it is more like about 1 teaspoon or a little bit more.  The chicken was good, but the skin way, way too salty too with only 2 tablespoons!

The meat was nice and juicy, but the skin didn't get crisp.
