The taste isn't a real winner with the children because there isn't enough sweetness to this recipe. Adults love it because it isn't real sweet, but has a lot of flavor and very easy to make and it was a winner with the Boy Scout snacks and at a church social.

I really liked these, but I am not sure that they turned out like they were supposed to!  I did not have to use as much flour as was called for to get the right dough...but maybe I miscounted.  And they took a lot longer to bake than the recipe said--about twice as long.  But they were good.  Kind of like a cross between a cookie and a sweet roll.  Not too sweet, which was good.
