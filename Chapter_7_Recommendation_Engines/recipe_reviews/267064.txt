This was super easy and turned out pretty good. I did use a ham hock instead of the pork jowl as the recipe submitter mentioned. I think this recipe could have used some onion and garlic. I ended up adding cayenne pepper to mine to give it some kick. Overall this is a good recipe with a simple and straight forward cooking method.

Great!  Just like Granny's. To the person who said you don't add sugar...yes, you do.  A little bit of sugar brings out all the other flavors.

You have to have onions, lots of onions, cumin, salt and pepper and NO SUGAR.  I have Pinto Beans for over 35 yrs.  My entire family loves them.  Not sure why sugar was even mentioned to make the beans.  And of course, a ham hock!
