I used to make this for the kids when they were little quite often. Only I added a can of sweet corn along with a few sliced mushrooms into the ground beef and onions as they browned. I served the beets warm as a side dish, instead.

This dish was really good. My aunt didn't like it so much but my 3 year old brother ate it and loved all of it. I used fresh garden beets and accidentally didn't cook them all the way but other than that I enjoyed it and I don't really care for beets!

Nice variation of what I would call shepherd's pie.  I used fresh beets from my garden.  Very pink.

I substituted vegetarian beef crumbles, fresh beets, and added sweet corn. It was delicious!
