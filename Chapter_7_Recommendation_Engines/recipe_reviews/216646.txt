These were amazing! I used a regular home-made muffin dough (for 12 muffins: 2.5 cups flour, 1.5 cups white sugar, 5 eggs, 3/4 cups 2 tblsp margerine, 2 tblsp vanilla sugar, 2 tblsp baking powder), melted the chocholate and added some cocoa powder just to make the color more even. As I didn't have any toffee bits at hand and don't like nuts, I simply used the triple amount of raspberries. Oh yeah, and I replaced the butter in the frosting by sour cream, just to soothe my conscience about all the fatty calories :)
Chocolaty heaven!

I was looking for a cupcake recipe that would be challenging, fun to do and unique. I found it! My boyfriend and his family absolutely loved them. And this was on the heels of them receiving a batch of professional cupcakes the week prior for a birthday. I highly recommend giving this one a shot. For you creative types, you will discover the versatility of this recipe and all kinds of ways you can make them your own by switching up ingredients. Have fun with this and be ready to wow your consumers!

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. I am new at cooking and so for the exception of putting the filling in the middle this was pretty easy. The filling thing I need to practice.

My wife and I made these cupcakes and it was our very first time making any cupcakes. Dont let it scare you away. ITS WORTH IT !!

We followed the recipe except we didnt mix the raspberries in with the filling , instead we filled the hole about a 1/3 of the way with some of the filling, put a raspberry inside and then topped it off with more filling.
I love white chocolate, she loves raspberries. It coudlnt have been any better for the two of us. 
They where so good i actually helped clean the dishes. Thats a first! :-)

These were delicious.  It does take a little bit of time, but nothing as intimidating as it sounds.  We used a boxed chocolate cake mix with pudding so we didn't add the 6 oz. of chopped chocolate.  We didn't use toffee bits or hazelnuts so we added a bit more powdered sugar to the filling.  We used a melon baller to core out the middle.  We used a reviewer's suggestion of the food processor to mix the ganache - we did so while the cupcakes were baking & cooling so it was perfect texture by the time we filled the middle.   Lastly, splurge a little on piping bags & tips (our grovery store sold 4 tips & 20 bags in a set for $3.99) - it makes the process much faster.   
PS - we used the "left overs" (like the middle of the cupcakes) to make a torte (layer chunks of cupcakes with raspberry cream - alternate & top off with ganache and/or frosting)

Every person who tried these fell over him/herself to tell me how amazing they were. One friend requested them for her birthday, another said I should open a bakery, another said they were the best thing she had ever tasted in her life. Needless to say, I think these were a win. For compliments like that, it was totally worth the 3 hours they took to make!

This recipe is not a quick one, but it's worth it.  I made it three ways - cupcakes, mini cupcakes and I baked a 9" round that I split and filled with the whipped cream.

I wouldn't recommend doing the cake unless you slice it before you chill the frosting too much.  Both layers of frosting get very firm when chilled, which will make them really easy to transport without a lot of damage.

The minis came out nicely, and they're rich enough that it's a good bite.  I'd probably just do those next time.  For the minis though, I'd recommend slicing up fresh raspberries so that it's easier to pipe the cream into them.  Makes a really impressive little dessert - thank you!

I made these for a baby shower! The dad is Italian and their last name starts with a "Z." Zuccotto means "little pumpkin" so I thought that would be appropriate. The filling makes a great mousse all on its own! I would make at least 1/4 less of the frosting next time, and about half the filling! There's too much frosting and filling for 24 cupcakes. Very pretty cake with chocolate flecks. There are several steps, but you can make them in a reasonable amount of time. I used a pastry bag and large French star tip to fill them.

Ohmygoodness! First of all let me say I was a bit intimidated since several of the previous reviewers were "expert" or "intermediate". But if it was good enuf for Kayla's wedding I was going to give it a shot. The one thing I omitted was nuts;too many friends with allergies. Although many steps, so worth the effort.So, I baked the cupcakes & then after I made the filling hubby licked the beaters & was disappointed;he said it wasn't sweet enough. I was starting to get nervous. But after  the cupcakes are filled, then topped with ganache, & then topped with cream cheese white chocolate frosting, believe me! The filling not being overly sweet is a good thing! These are super delish! Thanks so much for sharing...and if an ol' grammy like me can pull it off so can you! By the way, I piped frosting on like Kayla's pic and topped each cake with a fresh raspberry. The "hit" of the party!

For the cupcakes I just threw in semi sweet chocolate chips because I forgot to buy the bittersweet chocolate but it was still amazing! I can't wait to try it again with the correct chocolate.

I made these today following the recipe exactly and they are awesome.  I had only one problem, the frosting.  When I blended the melted chocholate with the cream cheese/butter to lumped up.  The chocolate began to solidify.  Other than that it was pretty easy - time consuming but easy.

This recipe requires ten stars.  Wow!  The filling is too delicious for words!  It was funny to watch people's expression when they bit into the cupcake.  It was as though their taste buds had just struck gold.  For example, my daughter was talking non-stop about her weekend, cupcake in hand.  She stopped mid-sentence to take a bite of the cupcake.  Then, she gasped, "Oh my God.  This is delicious!" . . . She lost her train of thought.  Amazing!

These cupcakes take a lot of work, but are so good! If you follow the recipe as it is you will end up with almost twice as much frosting as you really need...but that's an easy fix- just halve the amount of ingredients you need for the frosting!

My husband LOVES these! Yes they take a little effort and time, but it is SOOO worth it! My husband told me that out of everything I have ever made, desserts, snacks, main dishes and sides, this is his favorite! Every single time he learns I am making them he smiles from ear to ear! The only thing I do differently, is once the cupcakes are done, I sprinkle a little bit of cocoa on the top for decoration. Have fun and definitely try this recipe!

AMAZING! Yes they take a lot of time but WOW they are amazing! I got a ton of compliments and even more requests to make them for different events. I am not a big chocolate fan but these changed my mind! I followed the recipe exactly minus the nuts (we have a lot of allergies) and they were fantastic!

This was really fun to make. A little time consuming but really worth the effort. We used macadamia nuts because our grocery didn't have the hazelnuts.  The filling is awesome. We'll be serving this when we want to wow someone:) And like someone else has said we did end up having a lot of icing AND filling left over.

FABULOUS cupcakes! Followed it to a "T" and I can't believe how good they are! It's all about the raspberry/toffee center that gives it the perfect sweetness! Will be making these again :)

Daaaaaaang!! These were so delicious! I made them for a dinner at my mother in laws and everyone thought I bought them at a bakery. A few things, I left out the nuts because my sister in law doesn't like nuts in anything. I didn't have any white cake mix so I used yellow, which was fine, but I think I'll try white mix next time. I used fresh raspberries instead of frozen. The ganache is perfect. The filling is luscious, and the icing is incredible. All around a perfect cupcake!! Also, although it took a while for the cupcakes to come together, none of the individual steps were all that time consuming and were very easy. But you definitely need to plan ahead if you want to make these. But they are sooooo worth it.

Holy smokes! Quite honestly, the most impressive cupcake I've ever eaten!  Two people  I used as taste-testers thought they were "professional" cupcakes...and demanded to know where I got them. (I LURVE that!)  Now the downside..they are a PITA to make. However, it's worth the trouble for the bragging rights. :)

I followed the directions to a T, although I made the actual "cake" part the day before, as well as the chopping, so I could streamline filling/topping/eating.

As another reviewer posted, when piping in the whipped cream filling, it's best to use a regular storage bag rather than a pastry bag due to the chunky filling.  

The cream cheese and butter NEED to be at room temp or the white chocolate mixture will  start to solidify.

I used a previous poster's suggestion to make a mini trifle using the leftover cupcake/other mixtures. Plenty of leftover whipped filling and frosting...if you want to do the trifle you'll need a bit more ganache.

I feel that the frosting needs something...not quite sure what..but overall, the textures coming together are fabulous...so 9.9 stars instead of 10.

Thanks for sharing, Kayla, and thanks for all the detailed instructions! :)

Followed this recipe almost exactly. Only used fresh raspberries instead of frozen. These are the most delicious cupcakes I have ever had. They are very time consuming, but absolutely amazing. If you don't have a pastry bag for the filling or frosting, scoop it into a freezer bag, clip the corner, and squeeze. Thank you for sharing, Kayla!

Really good recipe - although I likely won't use raspberries in the filling going forward and find something else. But these were loved otherwise, my husband ate 4 before 8 am! Will make it again, but it its intensive and needs a lot of time to prep and complete.

These were absolutely amazing! I made cupcakes, a full-sized cake, and also trifle with the leftover cake pieces and filling/toppings. I had so many compliments at my potluck, where I served the cupcakes. I used chocolate cake mix, instead of white. For the toffee, I used Trader Joe's dark chocolate pistachio toffee. The results were spectacular! I love how the cream cheese frosting is slightly salty, which balances out the sweetness of the cake overall. And a fresh raspberry for garnish just makes the whole thing look so elegant. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Tasted good, liked how the flavors came together.  Probably could have made a better cupcake with less ingredients and way less time.  Also, it was kind of expensive for all the ingredients.  Taste was different and rich.  Probably would not make again only because of the price and time.  Overall it was good.

Well, I must say I was disappointed.  I also follow a recipe exactly the first time before I start tweaking.  For some reason I didn't think the flavors came together well and seemed to lack a focal point.  Overall a good recipe but there was no punch--maybe because there were so many flavors nothing seemed to stand out.  All the fine chopping for the bittersweet chocolate in the cupcakes was totally lost in any flavor--looked pretty, but you couldn't taste the chocolate bits.  Filling was okay, would add a lot more of the toffee bits to step it up a notch.  The ganache was the easiest I ever made but wasn't a standout.  And last, the frosting...didn't do it for me either.  It seems each section (the cupcake, filling, ganache, and frosting) were good on their own, it just didn't come together well.  Although there were a ton of flavors, the cupcake seemed boring.  Was not worth the cost of ingredients or time.  Was fun to make but will keep searching for an amazing cupcake.

I love this recipe! I made the filing, frosting and ganache before I even started the cupcakes, so it was all prepared when the cupcakes were cooled. I couldnt find a box cake with pudding so I just bought a yellow box cake because I really like yellow cake (still followed the ingredients from this recipe, not the one on the box), nor could I find chocolate covered toffee bits to save my life, so I bought those heath candy bars and crushed those up real nice. I dont think I let the white chocolate cool enough before I added it to the frosting because my frosting was a bit on the soft side(even after refrigerating for about 30 min.). I also just pushed a piping bag into the center of the cupcakes and filled them that way instead of pre-cutting a hole. This recipe was fantastic, I love to bake and I was looking for something creative and this was the perfect recipe.

This recipe did take quality ingredients and a lot of time, but it really was as easy as the others are saying.  I made this for a bake sale fundraiser and they were in such high demand.  My coworkers kept telling me that they were just as good as the cupcakes they had from a professional bakery.  I was so pleased, since I am not an expert baker by any means.  Don't be afraid to try this great recipe!

Really good! I got many compliments (people still talking the next day....) I think that next time I make these I'll be using whipped ricotta in the filling to give a little more body. I skipped the nuts and added mini-semi sweet chips because my toffee chips were not choc. coated. All in all, a 5!

Did I do something wrong?   I had a least a cup of filling left over, I could have used 3/4 cup more of ganache and I nearly had double the amount of frosting I needed!    They tasted great though.   Mine did not look like the photo at all, unfortunately.   I did add a lot of white food coloring to the frosting, but it still was a light cream color.   I will definitely make these again, but tweak the amounts, use large cupcake papers (to better cover the cupcakes with frosting), and I'll add fresh raspberries to the ingredient list for a garnish.

AMAZING! The most work-intensive cupcakes, but so many levels of flavor and experience, they were well worth it. Honestly, if you are short an ingredient on this one, don't sweat it - so much going on that they can take it. The family absolutely loved that every time they took a bite was another surprise. PS - This recipe makes way more frosting than you need, unless you pile it on high enough to make a 2-story cupcake!

These were extremely labor intensive however were good but not a showstopper.  brought these to a potluck and people said they were good but left with quite a few to take home where other desserts were raved about and completely gone.  Would not make again due to the effort and was not a huge hit.

Love, love, love. Delicious recipe. Don't hesitate to make- not technical just a little time consuming but SO worth it. 24 of these makes for many happy people ??my suggestion: make the ganache before the cupcake batter so it has time to cool while they bake.

Great British bake off.....that's what people kept saying when eating this....the only change I made was instead of toasted hazelnuts and toffee chocolate bits I used chopped up almond roca, and based off another review used fresh raspberries not mixing them in but putting one in the center bottom before the cream and one to top it off....this recipe is competition ready yo!

These were a huge hit at our Italian-themed college football tailgate. I sprinkled them with black and gold sugar for our school colors. I couldn't find hazelnuts, so I substituted almonds. I also don't have an apple corer. But I do have an "citrus sipper," the kind you push into an orange. It was the perfect size for making the hole for the filling. I think you could halve the icing ingredients and still have plenty for the 24 cupcakes. These were time-consuming but the compliments are worth it.

Good cupcakes. "A little labor intensive" is an understatement. Everyone raved about them, but they were way too much work.  I  don't think that the amount of time was offset by the taste.

These are divine! I made them the night before and popped them in the freezer on a sheet tray, uncovered. I pulled them out at 7 a.m. and let thaw on the counter. No problem with condensation and they were ready to eat by 11 a.m. (thawed four hours.) I used tall, brown cupcake liners which was a good choice since the ganache was still thin when I put it on and the liners held it in place. The liners also made it easy to pull the cupcakes out the pans when done baking -- and transportation was a breeze since I didn't have to worry about the tops bumping each other. I loved the bittersweet chocolate in the white cake. YUM! The filling is really good. Next time I'll add more crushed Heath bars. The toasted hazelnuts were good, but any toasted nut would work. The raspberries added just a touch of freshness (even though they were frozen.) The white chocolate frosting was yummy, but needed a bit of powdered sugar added. I had a bit of trouble piping through an XL star tip -- must have gotten a chunk of hardened chocolate off the bowl, so next time I'll be more careful of that or just use a large round tip. I sprinkled the top with more Heath - pretty! And my daughter made little Italian flags which were the perfect topper as these were headed to an Italian-themed, Freshman finale lunch. I will definitely make these again and again, and since these can be made ahead of time, the four hour prep won't be a big deal.
