I purchased a lemon  cake mix in error, gave this a try. The amount of the orange and lemon zest seems excessive, I cut back to 1 teaspoon of each, I added  1/2 teaspoon ground Cardamom, because I love how it accents blueberries. I baked in a 9 x 14  pan for 38 minutes.  I'm not so big on sweet frosting, I glazed with simple glaze of 1 cup confectioners sugar with 1/4 cup lemon juice. It's a nice change of pace. I will make this again !

Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe. The lemon and blueberry flavors mix nicely. I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I made cupcakes. The cupcakes baked beautifully and were done in 18 mins. I made a thin icing using 3 tablespoons butter creamed with 1 teaspoon lemon zest. Then I added about 2 cups confectioners sugar (add more if you want more sweetness or until desired consistency), 1-2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (to taste), 1/2 tablespoon water, and a dash of salt. Mixed it all together and dipped the cupcakes in to frost.

Five stars for this recipe because everyone who had a piece just raved and went back for a "smidgen more".  Lemon and blueberry are an awesome combo and this recipe delivers.  I would suggest that you flour the pan after greasing it, to make it easier to get out.  In the list of ingredients I would make it easier and list "two oranges: zest one and juice both"  and also "one lemon: zest it and juice it for both cake and icing".  Yes, the blueberries might sink to the bottom, but it made an impressive bottom layer and everyone thought it was planned.  I baked two separate cakes in 8x8 pans, for two separate families, and iced the tops right in the pans with a basic lemon/confectionary sugar icing. Rave reviews! I'm keeping this recipe.

I just made this cake and I'm so mad! All the blueberries sunk to the bottom and stuck the cake to the pan! It sounded so good too. It'll likely still get eaten, but I was going to take it to an event. Fail. I gave it one star, because apparently you can't choose zero...
