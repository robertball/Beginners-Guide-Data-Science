This was a great dish to make on a cold and stormy evening. I excluded some ingredients from the recipe to preparing it. I would gladly make it again with the same changes

I made the recipe as is and we loved it! I had some trouble with the pie crust not getting too done, but I think this would be great crustless as well.
