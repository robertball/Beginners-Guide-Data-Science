I love this recipe.  One suggestion to lighten in up so it's not so dense.  After adding the milk and applesauce to the dry ingredients, beat the egg whites until stiff and glossy and then add to the batter.  Fold the egg whites in gently.  The resulting cornbread will be lighter and fluffier.

As far as traditional corn bread goes I should give the recipe a 2. But since I am a health freak, I think the recipe is good enough for a 3.
Now for the dissection.
I made a few changes to the recipe. I used 2% milk and strawberry applesauce.
The bread is very dense and dry when it sits too long.
I thought the fat in the milk would help it a bit, but it didn't.
It doesn't have as much sugar as the traditional corn bread.
Still....as a health food, it is pretty good tasting straight out of the oven.It should bake in about 17-18 minutes. Don't over bake.I baked it in a 9 inch, square, silicone pan for 20 mins.
This bread should work great for stuffings.

This is great if you are watching your weight and want something for a low calorie soup to add to it. I did not use sugar, I used 2 packs Splenda and I used 1/2 cup light soymilk and 1/2 cup water.That is the only thing I changed and they are approx 90 cal each.

I loved this recipe and will definitely use it again. I made a few changes based on some of the reviews and my own preferences.  I used 1 1/4 cup cornmeal, 2 tablespoons white sugar and 1 tablespoon brown sugar (next time I'll try 1 white and 1 brown), I used 2 eggs with yolk, 1 cup soymilk, and added 1/2 cup of grated fennel bulb. The fennel bulb wasn't as distinct tasting as I hoped.  Next time I might add more and try adding a complimentary spice. We baked as per directions and it could have baked a little longer.

This recipe was the only one I could find without a large amount of shortening. Considering, it wasnt bad. Better topped with jelly or chili than eaten plain. Very dense and moist texture, perhaps less applesauce or none at all?

I rate this between 3-4 stars.  The only thing to make it better I can't use. I think a can of creamed corn would do wonders for more corn flavour - that's all it's lacking in, however I can't because it has sugar in it and my husband is diabetic. we are very pleased with how it turned with the changes I made. :) GS

This was pretty good.  I wanted it to have a bit more flavor, so I used the egg yolks too, and extra Tbsp of flour and cornmeal, and 1 extra tsp. baking powder.  My husband (who is very picky) said he couldn't even tell that it didn't have butter in it!  I'll be making this again.

I followed the recipe as is, doubling the ingredients.  My plan was to make thinner corn bread squares; however, this wound up being way more effort than it needed to be since I didn't adequately grease the pans.  (I used two 13"x17" pans instead of a 9"x9")  The resulting squares were 1/4" to 1/2" thick.  I imagine the normal size serving would be 2-3 times thicker.  I did it this way to reduce calories per serving.  While they were somewhat dry, that didn't bother me.  I was planning on serving them with a very moist chili.  They were mildly sweet, not as sweet as I prefer for cornbread on its own. Adding herbs to make it more savory might be a good idea to improve the flavor if people don't want to add sugar or more applesauce.  Though some degree of sweetness depends on cornmeal; lousy cornmeal can make the cornbread more bitter.  Personally I like my bread a little sweeter and will probably use homemade applesauce or cranberry applesauce in the same proportions as the commercial variety.  Preservatives in commercial applesauce reduce the sweetness, so without increasing sugar for this recipe it is possible to make sweeter cornbread by using fresher applesauce.  I really like "Sarah's Applesauce" here on Allrecipes or "Chunky Cranberry Applesauce" from Cooking Light: Complete Meals in Minutes.

I agree with other posters that compared to regular cornbread - this is a poor comparison - but for anyone on a cardiac diet this is a wonderful recipe! I have a difficult time coming up with replacement foods for my grandparents, and I cook for them frequently. For anyone who needs to cut down on fat and sugar this is a fine recipe. For those of us who don't - yes it is rather bland.

The BF and I thought this was pretty good.  Of course it wasn't as good as full fat rich buttery corn bread but what can you expect ?  For a low-fat recipe I thought this was very good.

This recipe would be 5 STAR IF it added a can of sweet corn, and suggested adding a bit of butter to the center while HOT!!!  It was GREAT tasting, and I didn't feel bad about adding a bit of butter in the middle!  I will never make a high fat corn bread recipe again, its just not worth the calories with a low cal recipe like this!

Followed the receipe except I used one whole egg.  I was mainly looking for a way to leave out the oil.  This bread is delicious and the only fat is the egg!!

Pretty tasty.  I was doing a test drive for Thanksgiving cornbread dressing so next time I will definately add more salt.  At least a teaspoon.  The texture was just right and pretty guilt free since I used egg substitute.

First of all, the cornbread turned out perfectly! It wasn't quite the same as my Mema's, but it was good!  To be as healthy as it is... excellent! It is really good left over too.  I will definitely make it again!

For low-fat cornbread it's pretty good. I would only make this if you're watching your cals or fat, otherwise go with the "good stuff". I made it for our family on a Weds night and it was just good enough for an every-night kind of meal.

I really wanted to love these.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out way too dry.  I ended up tossing most of them.  I might try this recipe again as a base.

Excellent cornbread! I followed the receipe exactly and really enjoyed it :-)
Sept 4th- I added sweet corn kernels to the recipe, used soy milk and made sure to beat the egg whites till nice and frothy. The 2nd time around the corn bread came out nice, fluffy and moist. The tweaks really made a difference!!

I wanted a cornbread recipe that was low in saturated fat but still moist and flavorful. I made a few simple tweaks and this was fabulous.  Increased sugar to 1/4 cup, used 2 whole eggs instead of just egg whites, and used fat-free plain yogurt instead of applesauce. Everyone loved it, and it tasted more like "traditional" cornbread than I expected. Plus, it took about 5 minutes to prep!

I used Trader Joe's carton egg whites ( which do not ship to stiff but I whipped them as much as possible.  I added 1/3 cup frozen roasted corn ( Trader Joe's ) and for the milk used 1/2 water, 1/2 almond milk.  Baked 5 minutes longer.  Turned out really good

I liked this recipe and it turned out well. I made one smal change though, I used 1/2 cup of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of corn flour.

I used whole eggs and oil in place of the applesauce (no applesauce in our house), which I realize made it less than low fat:) We thought it was good, and served it with flatlanders chili (also from this site). Perfection!

This is very good cornbread. I thought it had a bit of a rubbery texture in my mouth but the flavor was good. I love cornbread and don't have a problem trading out my traditional cornbread for this recipe. I would much rather eat a healthier version.  I used spray butter on it so didn't add any more calories.

Cornbread sounded really good as a go-along with the soup that I was having for dinner, but I needed a quick and easy recipe as I didn't have time to make my usual.  I didn't follow this recipe closely and make the bread completely non-fat -- I used whole egg and 2% milk.  Also ate the cornbread topped with butter, so that incorporated more of the taste of "traditional" buttery corn bread.  I'll make this again for something quick - although the texture isn't quite what I'd expect from cornbread.
