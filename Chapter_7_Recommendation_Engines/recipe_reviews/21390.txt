I've used this recipe numerous times and it has always turned out wonderfully. I went with other reviewers using only 2 tblsp cornstarch, and dark brown sugar has too much molasses for my taste so I always use light brown instead. Don't stint on the amounts of sugar and butter too much - they're the ingredients that make it "butterscotch."
 Also, many cooks seem to be having a problem with lumps. Cornstarch has a nasty habit of lumping when mixed with sugar. You can eliminate them almost entirely by mixing the starch in well with the sugar and salt before adding the other ingredients. 
 Lastly, instead of tempering the eggs, mix them well and add them, along with the milk, to the entire recipe before you even turn on the burner. Some recipes are fussy about when certain ingredients are added. This isn't one of them.
 Remember to stir *constantly* once it's on the burner or else the lumps you got rid of from the above step will come back to haunt you! -grin-
 Once again, this recipe makes a delicious pudding and Maryann, I thank you so much for submitting it. It's truly a favorite here at home.

After a few adjustments, this recipe was perfectly good. 2 tablespoons cornstarch was more than enough. I mixed the brown sugar, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and salt in a 1 quart saucepan, then slowly stirred in milk. I brought this to a boil over medium heat while I beat eggs in a smal bowl. When the sugar mixture came to a boil, I removed it from the heat and added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of it into the eggs, beating constantly, and poured everything back to the saucepan. Keeping on stirring, I brought this back to a boil, removed from heat, and stirred in butter and vanilla. It came perfect for me after cooking it this way. I hope it can help!

Easy trick to keep your cornstarch from lumping in any recipe, not just this one.  Mix cornstarch thoroughly with COLD liquid (water, milk, etc.) to dissolve, THEN place on stove & heat, stirring constantly.  You will end up with completely lump-free sauce (pudding, etc.)

Just remember a rule of thumb for puddings...usually the ratio of cornstarch is 1Tbs to 1c milk. ALWAYS mix in cornstarch when liquid is cool. Eggs have to be brought up to temprature VERY SLOWLY. A secret to good butterscotch flavor is browning the butter first in a small pan. Make sure it's a pan with a thick bottom. You don't want it to burn.

Good recipe. Based on the prior reviews, I was a bit sceptical but had to jump in and try it. A few tips....I used yellow sugar instead of dark brown and measured 3/4 cup loosely packed. I decreased the butter to a 2-ish tbsp. To keep the lump-factor to a mimimum, stir with a slotted wooden spoon or whisk. Remove from the heat to add the vanilla and butter. Even if there are lumps, keep stirring/beating/whisking...most, if not all, should disappear. The addictiviness (?) of this pudding is HIGH so beware!! Thanks Mary Ann.

Way to much cornstarch and brownsugar for my taste.  I had clumps of cornstarch in my pudding even though I stirred continuously. I cut back sugar to 2/3 cup and only used 2 tablespoons cornstarch for my second batch.  Stir while cooking and bring to a boil, boil and stir one minute then add remaining ingredients.  It turned out much better this way.

I made this recipe twice, and both times it was WAY too thick.  It is a bit too sweet also, but the main thing is cut down on the corn starch or you'll be making concrete.  The butter and vanilla are nice touches, but even constantly stirring it clumped up and was way too thick.

Wow!  This is fantastic!  Don't turn your back on it for a second though, or the cornstarch will lump.  Came together very quickly and is almost gone now!  Thanks for a great recipe!

good recipe.  use more milk,a little less sugar  and a little less cornstarch to improve this pudding. here's a helpful hint.  I had my mixer handy and right after it thickened I beat it for about a minute with the mixer on medium speed.  all the lumps disappeared and the consistency was perfect.

Although this was certainly very sweet, my biggest problem was too much cornstarch. I think the grit that someone else mentioned might be uncooked cornstarch. I even tried taking it up to a boil a second time, it was better but I could still feel the cornstarch.
The reason why I gave it 4 stars was I remembered a tip. I added about 1/3 cup of Johnny Walker Red Label. I added with the vanilla and the taste was incredible. Next time I  would reduce the cornstarch to about 2 or 3 tablespoons.

Tastes delicious!  I had to turn the heat up in order to get it to thicken, but other than that, it's great.

I used 2T cornstarch--just right!  I used 2/3 cup brown sugar--STILL too sweet!!!  Yowza!!!  And I used vanilla that I made with rum ... yum ... next time, 1/2 cup sugar will be plenty, I'm sure. ... ... ... And the next time, I did use 1/2 cup sugar and it was perfect!  On strawberries ... yum ... hubby had his on blueberries and enjoyed that, as well.  I did of course temper the eggs rather than adding them at the beginning.  Not a lump to be found, just stirring with a wooden spoon.

This was such a good recipe.  I made it just like the recipe was written, and had no issues with it at all.  I used a whisk to stir it and it turned out perfect.  I did add a pinch of extra salt because I used unsalted butter, but those were my only changes.  Thanks, I will make this again.

Good pudding- easy to make and tasty.  It is very sweet, and I cut the brown sugar down to 2/3 cup!  I can't imagine what it would have been like with the full cup...wow.  I used 1% milk and only used 1 tablespoon of butter- I think that is all it really needs.  I made this with my little girl tonight, who wanted "hop-scotch" pudding for dessert.  :)  It is really good with a handful of real white chocolate chips sprinkled on top while still warm, so they melt into the pudding.

This was quite good and I had no trouble. I actively--but not "athletically"--whisked this, and turned down the heat a little bit when I felt it start to thicken on the bottom of the pan. In my case, I did not need to wait for the pudding to boil, as it had thickened (spoon test) before boiling. I will certainly make this again.

I didn't have Dark Brown sugar, so I subtracted around 2 TBSP and added molasses. Like the other reviewer I only used 2TBSP corn starch which I stired into the sugar throughly before adding any liquid. It thickened up beautifully and hubby loved it! I'll use this easy recipe again and again THANKS!

This is very good.  I took advice of some other reviewers and only used 2 TBS cornstarch and I browned the butter before adding it.  I mixed the cornstarch thoroughly with the brown sugar, and had no lumps.

I put 3 tablespoons of butter in the pot first, and then added the sugar.  I heated those together, and added a splash of the milk, then heated that til smooth and hot.  Then I added the cornstarch and milk to the sugar, and then the eggs (per the recipe) I added good rum and vanilla at the end, and it came out FANTASTIC!

I made this recipe exactly as printed without reading any reviews.  The thickness was just right and the flavor was awesome other than it was a tad bit too salty (and a salt shaker is one of my best friends).  Mine did have little lumps and I would have preferred it smoother but I didn't wisk it.  I stirred constantly.  Next time I will try with a little less salt, and blend the conrstarch with a little bit of the cold milk before adding it to the pan to solve the lumpy problem and use a wisk!

delicious! i agree with some of the other reviews: i tempered the egg and reduced the cornstarch. everything else I eyeballed. in the end, I started to get a few lumps, but was able to mix them out easily with a hand-crank egg beater. seriously yummy!

So good and easy to make. Used a wisk while making the pudding. Will try light brown sugar next time, dark was a bit strong.

This was pretty good. It definitely needs all the corn starch stated in the recipe. I followed other reviewers about putting in less, and it was not a smart idea. Don't leave your pudding alone with the eggs in it! Stir constantly, or your eggs are sure to curdle like mine did!

This recipe is just like my Mother-in-law used to make when my husband was a kid.  So much better than store bought and worth every minute.

Like others, I made changes.  I looked at my other recipes for cornstarch puddings; reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, used 3 tablespoons cornstarch.   I made sure to mix the sugar and cornstarch well, then added the egg and 1 cup of milk, then added the rest of the milk.  Cooked it in the microwave in my handy 8 cup measuring bowl in 2 minute increments and then added the vanilla and 2 tablespoons butter.  YUMMY!  Now a fan of butterscotch pudding!

Flavor was perfect, but it's powdery following the directions as written.  I'm sure it's because of how much cornstarch the recipe calls for.  I think I'll stick with the homemade vanilla pudding and maybe just change the sugar to dark brown if I want the butterscotch flavor again.
Thanks for the good flavor!!

This was very good.  I converted the recipe to six servings and followed some suggestions from other reviewers.  I mixed the dark brown sugar with only 3 TBSP of corn starch (conversion called for 1/2 cup + 1 TBSP) and the salt in a saucepan.  Next I mixed in a combo of 1% milk and half & half and the beaten eggs.  I stirred with a whisk until it was heated and thickened.  It did take a while and I had started to wonder if I was going to have to find a way to mix in more corn starch without ruining it.  But, no worries, it thickened nicely.  We ate it warm and thought it was very good.  Thanks Kittyann.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

I made this exactly according to the recipe - holy COW this stuff is good!  I can't believe so much flavor comes out of such simple ingredients!  Mine did come out with a few lumps, will try combining the cornstarch with the cold milk before adding, and will also try making it with a whisk.

I'm sure it's great, but I'm not a great cook and I read *every* single review and tweak of this recipe and it ended up so lumpy i thought it was tapioca. tried all the tricks and did not stop stirring for one minute. maybe i would try a lower temperature. I was using medium low and it took forever but lower might have made it less lumpy? no idea. great recipe i'm sure. just hard to figure out for a novice. great flavor. really strong.

I make puddings and custard on a regular basis, and NEVER have they turned out lumpy... until now.  I mixed and wisked constantly and followed the reviews, but even then it was way too thick.  Tasted good though, I wasnt going waste it!

This was very good, but I think it has a little too much cornstach in it.  I used it as a pie filling, and once it sat in the refrigerator for awhile it was a bit too firm/rubbery in texture.  Next time I make it I think I will cut the cornstarch down to 1/4 cup.

I really like this recipe. I did not find it too sweet at all. I did not have any corn starch, and substituted flour. I think it would have been creamier with the corn starch. I also cooked it in the microwave. This was great served with cake.

It was pretty good- there were LOTS of chunks in it... but I ran it through the blender quick and solved that, completely. 
It tasted kind of salty at the first bite, but after that it tasted better- so maybe it was just me not used to it....   but beware because of all the chunks... but they don't ruin it if you blend it.

Almost inedible. Too much cornstarch by about a mile, so it had a weird, grainy/powdery texture. The flavour wasn't the best, either, with the butter really overwhelming things, and it was far too sweet! I wouldn't even attempt to make this again with changes - there are better recipes out there!

My effort didn't turn out. This was my first try at making a pudding with eggs in it and I wish I had chosen a different recipe with better directions. The recipe here indicates you should cook the eggs in with the milk, however if you look at any other recipe's directions, then you will see that the eggs should be added after the milk mix is off the burner. The hot mix should be added to the eggs slowly so that the eggs don't  cook. Unfortunately, I didn't know this as, this recipe fails to have complete instructions. I had  little lumps all over in my pudding of cookd egg and it tasted off, like sugar eggs. I will try again with a better recipe.

I may have messed this up. Due to other reviews, I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of a full cup - but I only had light brown. I couldn't wait to try it, so I did.

It did get lumpy, so next time I will try the trick of heating up ALL the ingredients minus some of the liquid and the cornstarch. Hopefully it won't lump then. I may also use just 1/4 cup of cornstarch; it just seemed a little thick to me.

It didn't taste lik butterscotch, but I really think it's because I used the wrong sugar. It tasted good, but it was still a little over-sweet. I'll come back on and let you know how the next batch goes!

This is going to be on regular rotation at my house. The recipe calls for way more corn starch than necessary. I used 3 tablespoons the second time and it was perfect. The butterscotch flavor is rich but not overpowering.

I made this last night and it wasn't a success. The texture was grainy and it lumped almost immediately. I dissolved the starch and sugar in cold milk first which often prevents lumping but not in this recipe. I used a whisk frequently and then my mixer with the whisk attachment and eventually saved the pudding.  Two tablespoons of cornstarch are plenty but i'll try adding a bit more milk next time. I am going to give it another go because the flavor wasn't bad, but I like a silky feel in pudding and found this unpleasant. My husband, ate the lot though.  I served this with lightly sweetened whipped cream with a drizzle of maple syrup.

This was delicious! I used flour instead of cornstarch since I didn't have cornstarch. I used  the same amount of flour as the amount called for cornstarch since most reviews said it was too thick otherwise. I will make this again!!

This is delicious! I read the reviews about it being grainy and lumpy so I sifted the brown sugar and cornstarch to get rid of the lumps.  I also only used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (rule of thumb 1 tablespoon cornstarch for 1 cup of milk - learned that from my grandma) This turned out smooth and creamy with a great butterscotch flavor.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I know it is BUTTERscotch pudding, but this had an overpowering butter flavor and was a little thick, maybe 1/8 cup less cornstarch would have been better. I only had light brown sugar on hand so perhaps if I used dark brown it would have more power over the butter flavor.

I really wanted to like this, but my husband took one bite and said "no".    I  ended up dumping the whole batch down the disposer.  I  went exactly by the recipe with the exception of using only 2 tbsp. cornstarch.  I  thought the amount stated was too much.  As it was, the taste coated my tongue and wasn't the smooth butterscotch taste I expected.

really good just a tad on the sweet side,  I'll definitely make it again but I think I'd cut the sugar just a tad. I did however cut it a little and add molasses as I didn't have any dark brown sugar only golden. Sweetness aside it's an amazing pudding!

Easy and delicious. The only change I made was to use 2 Tbp. of cornstarch (1 Tbsp. Per cup of milk). Perfect consistency. The most important thing to remember is to mix the cornstarch into the "cold" milk otherwise you'll end up with lumpy pudding. Will definitely make again.

I reduced the brown sugar to  1/2 cup,  and the butter to 1/8 cup. I mixed 2 TBSP corn starch with water and added it after it had been heating for about 4 minutes. It did not get too thick, but it had a bit of a strong bite to the taste yet, even though it was plenty sweet.  I think next time  I'll sub imitation vanilla for pure vanilla.  My kids ate it better this time than last time, so the modification are helping.

I love this recipe!  The only change I made was used 2 Tblsp. of corn starch.  It came out perfect and no lumps at all.  Thanks for posting this.  I will make many more times.

This recipe was so good and easy too.  I added a little sea salt for a salted caramel taste.

I agree with other comments to reduce amount of cornstarch.  I had to add 3/4 cup more milk at the end of the cooking time as the pudding congealed into a thick, gritty consistency.  I always add heated milk (90 seconds in the microwave) to the sugar and corn starch to minimize clumping and reduce cooking time when making puddings.  I used a whisk on the eggs before adding.  Nice flavor; wouldn't change anything except amount of cornstarch.  Try the warmed milk to eliminate lumps and see how that works for you..

I followed recipe exactly but took advice from previous posts n used 2 tblsp of cornstarch but evidentially was not enough because the pudding was thin n not thick enough. Next time im going to use the amount the recipe says, n see if that works.

I've made this recipe a number of times now. Living abroad, when I want a taste of home, I have to make it myself. It's so good (even better than the packaged sort) that I've turned it into pie filling when I was back home over the holidays- graham cracker crust, fresh whipped cream on top.

This recipe has a lot of potential but it's not one I'll be making as a stand-alone dessert in the future. It is far too rich and sweet to eat by itself except in very small amounts. For that reason I think it would be a good filling for a small tartlet, the kind one sees at tea parties. I'd garnish it with toasted coconut or perhaps slivered almonds. It would make a perfect little bite. Now, having said all that, the reason this recipe is getting 4 stars from me is the consistency. It's not as smooth as pudding made only with cornstarch. I imagine the eggs are added for richness and color but the final texture is slightly grainy. I used a whisk when cooking. Once the pudding began to thicken it turned briefly into a very lumpy mass. I reduced the heat and whisked vigorously until I achieved my desired consistency, added the vanilla and butter, continued whisking, and the pudding became smooth. The slight graininess is not unappetizing but it's not really creamy like a pudding made from cornstarch alone. Finally, the color is a lovely pale caramel color, not the bright "pumpkin" color I'm used to in commercial butterscotch pudding but I only mention this for those who might care about color and presentation.

I used this recipe as a base for a vegan version. It did turn out good. I used full fat coconut milk (from a can) instead of regular milk. I also substituted Ener-G egg replacer for the egg and margarine for the butter. (I would like to try coconut oil next time.) I also used light brown sugar, because that it what I had on hand. The flavor was amazing, but I did notice a bit of a starchy texture to it. I'm not sure if this is because I used the full amount of corn starch or because I used the egg replacer, which is starch-based. Next time, I will change them around a bit (first by removing some of the corn starch) and maybe try using real eggs instead. I think the coconut milk added a nice flavor. (It doesn't taste strongly of coconut, but it does taste different from cow's milk, thus adding a little flavor.) Over all, I am very satisfied with this recipe. For those having trouble with lumps, make sure to stir the dry ingredients together well before adding the liquid. Also, I constantly whisked it, and I had no problems whatsoever.

Just made this easy recipe and it is ok, but not enough flavor for me.  The real test will be when the grandkids try it tomorrow.  I followed recipe, using 2% milk.  No lumps, nice consistency.  But then, I'm a dark chocolate fan.

I doubled this recipe except I used only 4T of cornstarch and light brown sugar. I read all the reviews first and also browned the butter as one reviewer suggested for a deeper flavor. I mixed everything together before heating it up and added the cornstarch with the sugar and salt. I stirred it frequently and ended up with a smooth, lump-free pudding. Many reviewers thought the sugar was excessive, but I did not. It was good, just not great. I wanted a darker, deeper, richer flavor and I think that's where the dark brown sugar will come in. Perhaps even some molasses. Better of course than a box but fell short of my expectations. My own fault for not having/using dark brown sugar and/or molasses. I'm thinking even cooking/browning the sugar as a separate step to carmelize it further for a darker, richer even almost smoky flavor would really put this over the top. I will make it again in the future and report back.

Oh my this is soooo good. I only had light brown sugar so that is what I used. Next time I make it I'm going to try and remember to buy dark brown sugar. The flavor is fabulous and my family flipped over this pudding. Easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used 5 T of cornstarch. Set up perfectly, it wasn't to thick and it wasn't to runny. Yummy. Thanks!

I reduced the cornstarch to 2 TBS and the consistency was perfect. I loved the flavor, though it was a bit sweet for my taste. While warm, it was smooth and creamy. The next day, after being refrigerated, it was still good, but had a grainy texture. This was my first time making pudding so maybe that is normal.

This is absolutly the best tasting pudding. No lumps, not grainy, just smooth goodness.
  To cut fat and calories, I used fat free half and half, Splenda brown sugar and I can't believe it's not butter.  All ending to a great result.
 Thank you.

This is my husband's account but I felt I HAD to comment!  I have never before made homemade pudding.  This was very easy to follow and the pudding turned out FANTASTIC!  I didn't have any real butter but I used "I can't believe it's not butter" and I didn't notice a difference.  It's rich and creamy and doesn't taste like premixed store bought pudding.  I will definitely use this recipe again! THANKS!

OK recipe. Very creamy, and rich, but lacking. Made it as directed, but tempered the eggs. In my opinion, it was good BEFORE the eggs. It thickened before adding them, so it would probably work fine that way. Anyway, finished product, in my husband's opinion was, "just something sweet."

Pretty good. Had to make some alterations, but I was satisfied with it overall. I only had salted butter on hand, so I used that and just omitted the extra salt. I followed the suggestion of 2 Tb. corn starch, and it worked well. No lumps, but I was constantly whisking the mix and I broke up the lumps in the brown sugar/cornstarch before adding any liquid. Also added a splash of Buttershots liquor, and it didn't thin it out so I'll chalk that up for a success. Was a bit overwhelming in flavor, but this was my first attempt at making any flavor of pudding from scratch so that might be the reason. Or the liquor. Hm.

I just made this. While it tasted great, it seemed that I cooked it forever and it never seemed to thicken enough. I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch like suggested. Next time I will try the full amount. I had no trouble with lumps.

I am big on sweets and I thought that this recipe had waaaaayyyy too much sugar. Next time, I will reduce it to 3/4 cup. I thought that the amount of cornstarch was alright, but 3/8 of a cup is difficult to measure, so I will use 1/3 of a cup next time. Also, I was suspicious of mixing the eggs with the sugar and milk before heating it up. Usually, when you make fillings or puddings, you heat the cornstarch, sugar, and milk until it boils and thickens, then mix half of the mixture with the beaten eggs very slowly while beating the eggs. Then pour it back into the pot with the remaining mixture and heat for a few minutes.

Made this for my husband who is a butterscotch pudding lover. I've made it twice and the first time it came out grainy. This time I added everything to the pot before cooking but it was still a bit grainy. Perhaps I'm not cooking it long enough? Not quite sure, but my husband ate the whole batch so it couldn't have been that bad.

This one's just OK. It tastes starchy and perhaps has too much cornstarch in it. I would increase the egg count by at least one and reduce the cornstarch to see if it'll set the same. People enjoyed it though (I used it in a trifle with devil's food cake chunks, butterscotch chips, and walnuts), and it made a pretty presentation against the dark chocolate cake in the bowl.

This tasted wonderful - I LOVE brown sugar - but unfortunately I ended up with a not-completely-smooth texture even though I used a whisk during cooking.  Another thorough whisking off the heat took care of that problem, and the pudding was just the right thickness while it was warm.  After it cooled...it was much TOO thick.   So I guess the amount of cornstarch used depends on whether or not you plan to eat this warm or store in the refrigerator.  Next time I would follow the same cooking method I use for vanilla & chocolate puddings - mix the milk into the dry ingredients and cook until thick, THEN add the egg (tempered with a little of the hot milk) and continue cooking for another minute or so.  Adding all of that butter seemed unnecessary - half of it was plenty for me.

this is delicious.  i cut the cornstarch down to 1/4 a cup, and used a bit less sugar.  i also used soymilk because i'm lactose intolerant- worked fine.  i would recommend keeping a whisk handy.  if it tries to lump, that'll take care of it nicely.

I found this OMG good.  Granted, I made in in an attempt to sate a generalized "pudding" pregnancy craving, but I think it is wonderful.  I went with 2 T cornstarch, I whisked everything well before putting it on the heat, and had no lumps to speak of.  Yum.  I did portion it into 6 ramekins instead of just 4...it's good, but rich.

This was my first time making this kind of pudding and it did not turn out very well(extremely lumpy).  It might have just been me and I think I will try it again to see if I can get better results.

Wonderful recipe.  My husband raved about it saying it was definitely butterscotch and so much better than the box.  We'll definitely make this again.
