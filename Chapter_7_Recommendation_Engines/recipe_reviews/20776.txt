Fantastic Recipe!  I made this for a wedding reception and got great compliments!  The tart was just right to offset the sweet cake and mints.  I added an 8 oz. can of chunk pineapple with the juice.  I froze everything except for the cranberry ginger ale the night before and then left it out to thaw to slush.  When it was time for the punch, I put the slush in the punch bowl and added the ginger ale. The only change I would have made if time had permitted, I would have like to have frozen some of the punch (without the ginger ale) with the pineapple chunks, some strawberries, and a few mint sprigs in a jell-o mold so it could have floated in the punch.

This was a great punch, although I had to alter the ingredients slightly since I couldn't find them all.  I used raspberry soda rather than cranberry gingerale.  Also, I used frozen pineapple/orange juice instead of just pineapple; I couldn't find it.  Thanks!

Made this for my sister's wedding last weekend, and it was a hit! We did an ice ring with flowers and lemon wedges - very pretty.

Made this for a wedding shower.  Everyone seemed to like it but no one made special mention.   I usually love any kind of punch and thought this one was pretty good as well.

I've made this recipe twice (I had two receptions in two countries) and both times it was a success!  This second time the punch was for the children rather than the adults and they enjoyed it very much aswell.  At the end of the evening though, half the punch was still there, so we added two cups of vodka and let the adults finish it off.  Very good recipe!  I will definately use again!

This is my absolute favorite punch recipe! I've made it for company parties, baby showers, etc. I love that it's not overly sweet, like many Hawaiin Punch type punches are. Very pretty pink color too!

Very easy to make and relatively inexpensive compared to other punch recipes.  This punch has a tart kick to it, with a little sweetness. Not overpoweringly sweet like other punches that I have had.

Everytime I make this punch it is a HIT! My hint, I usually use at least one Club Soda to cut the sweet.

I made this for a wedding brunch at my office and immediately after tasting this wonderful, refreshing punch, everyone went running to the copy machine to make a copy of the recipe!!  The first sip may seem a bit too tart, but that's just your taste buds waking up. :-) My grocery store didn't carry the flavored ginger ale, so I just used the regular ginger ale.  Also, my punch bowl is 6 quarts. I mixed the punch in a larger container and filled my punch bowl twice -- so this recipe makes about 12 quarts of punch with the ice.  And it compliments cake and other sweet foods perfectly!!  Enjoy!

I was looking for a punch that wasn't to sweet. This recipe was perfect! Everyone loved it. I just hate sicky sweet punch with cake, this was nice and refreshing. I couldn't find cranberry ginger ale so I just used regular ginger ale.

Perfect blend of sweet and tart.  I used regular ginger ale because I couldn't find any cranberry ginger ale and made an ice ring out of flavored sparkling water and fruit--soooooo good!!

This is really good!  I couldn't get the cranberry ginger ale so I used the regular.  It didn't matter.  I made this at work for a retirement celebration recently and it was a big hit.  Had to keep filling the punch bowl!
I thought for a non work celebration, I would substitute some champagne for the ginger ale!  Then the fun will begin!  Thanks!  (Can you tell I loved it?)

Perfect! I'm not a big fan of the super-sweet  sugar punches, but this punch was excellent - not too sweet- just wonderful and refreshing. Loved it!  Garnish with cranberries (and/or lemons, limes, oranges, pineapple) to make it festive. I had many many requests for the recipe.

This punch is great!  I made it for a baby shower and ran out!  I NEVER run out of punch at parties!  I also had to alter the ingredients slightly since I couldn't find the cranberry gingerale either.  I used one can of rasberry lemonade and one regular.  It turned out really good.  I also floated sliced lemons and put in some fresh strawberries that I froze the night before.  Delicious!  I will be making it again this weekend for my daughter's birthday party.

I added 3 cups of water and used an ice ring (which lasted for about 3 hours).  I used pineapple orange juice and regular ginger ale but I think almost any combination of fruit juices mixed with the cranberry juice and ginger ale will work.  I have also made this recipe with regular lemonade and with out the cranberry juice to avoid stains from spills. Several people have asked me for the recipe and I will continue to make this.

I tried this out at home before I decided to use this recipe for a bridal shower.  The first taste is quite tart, however, the rest of the cup tastes great.  Next time I may add a little orange juice or orange pineapple juice.

I did serve this at the bridal shower and it was a hit!  I couldn't make it fast enough!  I will definitely make this again.

This is the best punch recipe I've found so far. It is tart and sweet, so I always find that I could stand to cut the juice concentrate down a bit. This recipe fills 2 of my punch bowls- but the overall taste (give or take some of the ingredients) is good- and people usually finish it off.

Served it for a fall birthday party. The guests really enjoyed it and I had to share the recipe with several of them. I couldn't find cranberry ginger ale, so I used Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash

I used this recipe for my wedding, my sister's wedding and my other sister's wedding shower.  It was a hit!  I could never find cranberry ginger ale, but regular ginger ale works too.  :) Love it!

i love cranberry juice and so was expecting to enjoy this punch.. however, i wasn't thrilled with the cranberry/lemonade flavour combination.  i made another punch the next day leaving the cranberry juice out, and it was great.

Very yummy! When I started preparing this punch I accidently started preparing the concentrate as a juice. Luckily I only added one can of water, then caught on! :o) Overall it was very yummy. Would be fun to experiment with diffrent flavors. VERY easy!

I served this punch at a baby shower I gave recently.  The color went really well with the theme colors.  It must have been delicious.  The guests drank it so fast, I didn't get to try it.  Needless to say, I will definitely serve it again!

I have made this for countless baby showers and it is always a great hit!  I am constantly passing on this recipe. By the way, I use ginger ale, as cranberry ginger ale is not available at any of my local grocery stores.

This was great and super easy to please a crowd.  I used just regular ginger ale, raspberry lemonade, pineapple orange and it still turned out fabulous - not too tart and not overly sweet, refreshing. Added sliced strawberries and lemons to float on top.  People went for multiple servings and did ask for the recipe!  =)

I liked this punch a lot - served it for a baby shower, and it tasted great and was a beautiful color. I would definitely make this again. Great for weddings, showers, and brunches.

I made this for a Superbowl party and it was a hit!  I couldn't find frozen pineapple concentrate so used regular pineapple juice and regular ginger ale.
