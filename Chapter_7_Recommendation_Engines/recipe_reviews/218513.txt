Notes because allrecipes changed some things:
2. You don't have to go in any silly order--just mix the dry ingredients, then the wet. Then combine the two and add chocolate chips.
3. The edges, unless you didn't use enough cocoa powder, will NOT be golden.

I made this recipe for recipe group 07/30/2011. I thought the cookie sounded interesting, but I honestly really didn't care for these much personally. They tasted like a very cakey chocolate chip cookie mixed with a gingerbread cookie. I made 1/2 the recipe and got 33 cookies which was plenty. I realized the spices called for cloves and it got me worried about the final flavor. I think of Christmas when I think of cloves. So, I decided to do half the cloves suggested. However, it was still way too strong in my opinion. I let a couple of other people try one and one of them said, oh you made gingerbread cookies. So, I realized I was not the only one. I hadn't even mentioned what was in them. I can only faintly see the zucchini. It almost looks likes pistachios and it can't be tasted at all except for their texture a bit. I did eat a couple of them and the taste did start to grow on me as they cooled. It is possible I may have thought differently of the spice of this cookie on a Christmas tray. I don't know.

These were to die for! I didn't even notice the zucchini. I love the spices. Others might not enjoy the strong clove flavor, but I did!

Made this recipe for the *RECIPE GROUP* I thought these were quite good! Made a few changes... I didn't use all of the cloves and cinnamon, added more cocoa powder and forgot to add the chocolate chips. Very good, just not too much flavor. (maybe that's because of my changes, idk, but I didn't want a spice cookie)

Recipe Group selection 7/30/11.  I made half a batch with some changes.  I replaced the margarine with butter, cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup for half a batch and would cut it back to 1/2 cup if I make these again.  I omitted the cloves because we just don't care for them.  I increased the cocoa powder by 1 tbs and probably used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  I love the way the cinnamon flavor plays off the chocolate and generally found them to be moist, but more cakelike than I prefer.  The dough was too soft to roll into balls even after chilling for over an hour, so I just used my cookie scoop and that worked just fine.  You would never know there is any zucchini in these cookies.  Thanks, Bounce for a new recipe.

I thought these were a nice little cake-like cookie but I wanted more of a “chocolate” cookie than a spice cookie.  I thought the spices overpowered the chocolate flavor.  I think the chocolate chips saved it chocolate wise.  I wrung the moisture out of the zucchini to reduce the moisture content before adding it to the batter.  Also, the batter is made with cocoa so don’t plan on waiting until the edges turn “golden”.

I made these for recipe group and would definitely make again.. Mine look a little stringy due to the zucchini being in longer pieces than I realized but it wasn't apparent until it was in the dough and only affected the look. I also don't care for cloves so replaced with nutmeg but then accidentally halved the cinnamon and ended up a little bland. I used butter and white whole wheat flour, as I always do, and replaced the egg with a flax/water sub due to allergies. All in all it sounds like a lot of changes but not really and I ate three right out of the oven so I think with the correct spice measure these would certainly be deserving of 4 stars even though I personally prefer a less cakey cookie.

These were good, but they don't keep that well.  They are cakey cookies - don't expect a chewy/crisp cookie.

2 cups of zucchini divided by 60 cookies does not a health food make (roughly 1.5 tsp per cookie).  It's a decent cookie, though a bit cakey and the cloves were overwhelming.  That is to be expected since cloves are usually used in 1/4 and 1/8 tsp quantities.  I subbed in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and left out the c-chips.

These are excellent and exactly what I was looking for to use up some zucchini!  I read several other reviews which stated there was too much "spice" from the cloves and cinnamon, and since I was looking for a chocolate chip or a chocolate-chocolate chip cookie, I decided to leave out the cloves and only used 1/2 the cinnamon (we really like cinnamon, so I thought that would be a nice background touch).  I also increased the amount of chocolate chips by about a 1/2 cup to make them more of a chocolate chip cookie.  And like another review said, I was worried they weren't done after 10 or 11 minutes, but once they sit for a few minutes, they are absolutely perfect!  I will definitely try the original recipe with cloves soon.  Thanks so much for sharing!

These were delicious. I didn't change anything. Perhaps it is more cakey than brownie because of the two eggs instead of just one, or because of not squeezing the water out of the zucchini first. I'm not sure putting zucchini in these can make them nutritious, though. That must be overweighed by the sugar and chocolate.

You cant taste the zucchini and its good for a chocolate fix.  I had to add a half cup more flour and dropped the cookies instead of rolling them as it was so sticky.

I halved the recipe, swapped in nutmeg for the cloves (I was out), and subbed an extra quarter cup of cocoa for some of the flour. They were delicious, and my chef husband even took some to work to share!

I liked these cakey-treats! I used 2 medium zucchini so I omitted 1 egg, and only used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and no cloves. So not overly spiced, just chocolate goodness. The dough was gooey so I just spooned them onto the cookie sheet but they baked nicely. All my kids loved them.
