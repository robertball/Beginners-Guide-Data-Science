Icy, fruity and refreshing! I cut the recipe in half and added just a llittle crushed ice. Since I didn't have "Silk" or soy milk I just used skim milk. This was so good and proved to be a really nice treat.

Like mine. I actually made a strawberry banana smoothie today but used milk instead of soy milk. I sometimes add the orange juice and sometimes not, but if I do only add it to taste. It would be way too thin of a smoothie if the whole amount listed is added along with the milk. I found that the best button to make the smoothies on is the chop button on my blender for some reason, as it seems to keep the smoothie a little thicker to. This is a very basic but good list of smoothie ingredients. A handfull of frozen strawberries, a banana, some milk, and a little honey is all you need! :)

This is really good and very smooth. I made some alterations, though. I used plain Kefir (a probiotic yogurt found in the milk aisle) instead of almond milk. I also added a kiwi which added some tanginess - really good!

I'll be making this one again!

Made just one serving of this in my rocket blender. Was excited to see a recipe utilizing the milk I drink everyday: Silk Almond Original. The only thing I substituted was agave nectar for honey.

I also used a frozen banana, not a fresh one. Not sure if that made the consistancy thicker than normal, but I did have to start eating this with a spoon until it melted a bit. I'll try a fresh one next time.

Thanks for the recipe!

Only giving it 4 stars because I used real milk instead.  Very tasty!  Not sure if I will put as much orange juice in it the next time, but still a great smoothie recipe.  I love that honey is used instead of sugar!

Wonderful. I liked the addition of the orange juice making it a little more refreshing. I only had fresh fruit so added some ice. Yumm!!!

I am a huge fan of smoothies! I love the refreshing taste of smoothies. This particular recipe used Almond milk: I think it was a little thick for a smoothie. I added a few ice cubes for a thinner smoothie.  I will adapt it next time. I prefer using Barley milk in my smoothies.

This is easy to make and tasts great.  I added some frozen blueberrys to increase the antioxidant content and it tasted just as good.  It also tasts great with hemp milk (found in health food stores or the health foor isle of regular grocery stores) for added omega 3's.

My 8 year old daughter made this for us and we loved it. We mixed kefir/rice milk/yogurt in place of the almond milk, and about 1/8-1/4 c. cranberry-grape juice instead of orange just because we had that. Great base to add supplements, as well (protein powder, raw egg, etc.)

I just made a batch with the blender I received for Christmas and was extremely pleased with both! I made a few changes.  I used Silk Plain Lowfat Soy Milk because that is what we usually drink.  I added 4 packs of Splenda instead of honey, and added only a splash of OJ, which I will probably omit in the future and ad a bit more soy milk.  It was wonderful.  It was so thick I had to eat it with a spoon, which I prefer.  I suggest adding more liquid if you want to sip through a straw.  This is a keeper, which I will have as a treat several times a week.

Really tasty smoothie! I bought pre-sliced frozen strawberries this time, otherwise I usually use fresh strawberries. Perfect strawberry to banana ratio. I added a dollop of fresh whipped cream to the top of mine.
