For some reason this recipe intrigued me so I gave it a whirl.  Can't say I didn't like it, but not loving it either.  I used what I had on hand and combined with half pumpernickel and half sourdough.  Didn't have the store bought honey mustard on hand so I made my own which actually turned out really good!  Other than that followed the recipe.  Have to say, Jenn, that I enjoyed trying out your recipe.  Thanks for submitting!

Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this, it's an unusual combination of ingredients.  It has no canned soup (rarity for casseroles like this, and I loved that), and my concern was that it would be  dry.  The bread cubes are coated with honey mustard, and I think that's what keeps it moist.  I had no swiss, so used a combination of muenster and cheddar which worked well.  I didn't have enough time to let the bread cubes dry out for several hours, so I put them into a 250 degree oven to dry out a bit. When I took off the foil, I put the casserole back into the oven for about 5 minutes to allow the bread cubes to brown a little.  The only thing that I will do differently in the future is cut back on the sweet relish.  The combination of the honey mustard and the sweet relish made this a little too sweet for us (personal taste preference).  I used a ham steak for this recipe, but keep this recipe in mind when you're trying to use up some leftover Holiday ham.  Thanks, Jenn Brown, we enjoyed your casserole!
