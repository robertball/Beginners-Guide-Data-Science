I loved these.  I used fresh beans and boiled them and saved water for the recipe as called for. Was tasty and I love to find a good side dish since I always can pick a good main course but always seem to stumble with what to prepare with it. I will definitely make these again!

Great!!!! A favorite. Made a few changes. Used frozen green beans because I hate the canned taste. Used balsamic vinegar insted of apple cider vinegar and added some white wine. also since im an ex-smoker(after 17 years) I need alitle more seasonings for my taste so I used Seasoned salt and a few dashes of garlic powder. AWSOME This has become a much requested family favorite.

These were sooooo good! Between the salt in the bacon and in the canned green beans, I eliminated the tsp. from the recipe. Other than that, I didn't change a thing and we all agreed that this was a very tasty side that I will certainly make again. Thanks Debbie!

MMMMM! I used frozen green beans instead of canned. If you like that sweet and sour flavor you will love these.

I love these beans!  I use a very similar recipe, although it has a scant cup of sugar and no salt and pepper.  After cooking the liquid until thickened, I add the green beans and sprinkle bacon on top, then bake at 350 until it is bubbly.  Yummy!!

Nice flavor, definitely spot on.  I accidentally added 2 tbsp flour, but thinned out with a little water after I uploaded the picture (the sauce won't be as thick as it appears on the photo).  Quick side dish using canned veggies, reminiscent of old-fashioned down-home green beans.  Really good weeknight dish.  UPDATE 1-30-12  Made these again tonight.  Talk about the great imposter...who would know these came out of a can???  Just really like this side dish!

WOW - this was wonderful!! I used blanched and frozen green beans from last year's garden and tossed in a tomato and some sliced mushrooms that needed to be eaten. What a great way to eat green beans!!

Great recipe!!  This is my favorite green bean recipe.  For a short-cut, you can buy S&W Dilled Green Beans, just add bacon and onions.

LOVE these!  I am always looking for a way to spice up green beans because my husband will only eat them if they have plenty of flavor. Added some garlic and a pinch of Italian seasoning.  Also used balsamic vinegar since I had it in the pantry, and used brown sugar because I thought it lends itself to the smoky taste of the bacon and the flavor of this dish.  It was DELICIOUS!  My new favorite green bean recipe!

A welcome change from the usual green bean casserole and one I will be making again. I did use frozen green beans though, and a bit more bacon. Loved it, and thanks.

My husband loves anything with vinegar and he loved this.  It was a great way to jazz up canned green beans.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the recipe and enjoyed the green beans.  May try frozen or fresh next time.  I didn't find it too salty.  Glad to have another recipe for a green vegetable.  Getting tired of same old, same old.

Looks terrible, tastes amazing! used fresh green beans and turkey bacon. Added a little white wine to the flour part as there wasn't much grease from the turkey bacon. These will definetly become a weeknight veggie staple.

These were yummy! Everyone at the party raved!! I used frozen green beans and doubled the sauce!! Added a tad more vinegar than called for. Taste as you go along and adjust to your liking.  When I added it to the beans it kinda lost it's punch. That's why I added a bit more. It does remind me a lot of german potato salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy to prepare & went well with the beef brisket that we had for Christmas dinner.  Will make again, but may subsitute fresh or frozen green beans & chicken broth.

Excellent! I have a variation of these every year for Christmas Dinner, and they didn't last long today. This version is a keeper.  My hubby wonders why we don't have these more often (me too). The only change I made was no additional salt (I figured the bacon had enough) and a dash of Accent!

Very good. Not overpowering. I used fresh frozen beans from the garden. 1/2 lb bacon. Light brown sugar instead of white. 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar & 1/8 cup Italian Herb red Wine Vinegar.
Made the sauce on a large skillet & added cooked beans and tossed.

If you like warm German potato salad, you will probably like this, since it shares a similar flavor profile. I used frozen green beans, because I don't enjoy the texture of canned. I used chicken broth instead of the can juices. 
I also cooked the bacon bits ahead of time. Then, i cooked one slice of bacon with the onion (for the sake of flavor) and continued with the recipe as stated. I just don't like soggy bacon bits. I also trim most of the fat with kitchen shears, and then cut them into bits and then cook them. It's good with pot roasts.

No beans about it.... these are simply the best green beans.  I did use more bacon and less onion to suit my family's pallette. My son who is not a veggie person devoured them!

This is one of my favorite ways to have green beans! I've made it several times, because it's so easy and flavorful. The only thing I change is to use fresh or frozen green beans.

I felt there was something missing from this recipe. It was ok but I needed a lil more flavor so I added a bit of garlic salt and some chili pepper flakes.I used fresh beans and reserved 3/4 of the water they were cooked in for the juice. Still something tasted a bit off to me, it may just not be my kind of dish. I found it more sweet than sour. Thanks for sharing though! :)

Tastes very similar to the beans my German mother would make. I added a little more vinegar because I am used to the beans being more tart.

Made this for Thanksgiving and used others suggestions to tweak the recipe - fresh beans, brown sugar and balsamic vinegar - delicious and had requests for the recipe which I credited to The All recipes app. Thanks!

I've made it many times before. The only difference is that I use brown sugar.  I wanted to compare ingredient amounts since I usually just dump them in.  My son in law requested them for dinner.

This is just what I was looking for today (Christmas day 20 16) 
*Very good! They are great with Ham or pork of any type. 
Please use fresh green beans. (We also used small New Red Potatoes.
*I  grew up in Pennsylvania eating these in season with fresh green beans...So I did have to make that change.  
*In my opinion one should use fresh green beans when making this, the green beans are better and so Is the sauce (gravy) because you'll be using the  water  from cooking your gr. beans.
*I just added a bit more flour because I like to cook my flour longer to get the warm nutty taste, but the down side is it loses some of its thickening properties, so I compensated for that.  
*With fresh green.beans this is a 5 all the way...I never ate it with canned gr. beans so couldn't give it a 5. (Sorry)
Keep the sugar handy and adjust to your family's taste. Hubby likes it a tad bit sweeter and I like it so sour it turns your lips white. *SO Taste before you add beans so it has a chance to cook if you have to add a bit more. 
Enjoy!

I made this today and it turned out great. I also used fresh beans, cooked them in the microwave with a little water. I don't like my beans overcooked so they were tender but not mushy. I added just a little bit more vinegar, dash more. I like a little stronger vinegar flavor and any vinegar would work. This is really a good recipe. I also used the cooking water from the beans.
