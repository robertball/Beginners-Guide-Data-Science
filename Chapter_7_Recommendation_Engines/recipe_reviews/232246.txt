I made this because I was in a pinch for breakfast and had a lot of zucchini from our garden.  It's moist and tastes like a chocolate cake without icing.  But, I really only made it because I had the extra zucchini and it was quick and easy; so, for those reasons it was good but not quite 5 star worthy.  Also, you may want to note that mine was thoroughly cooked at 40 minutes.  (Normally, my oven takes the full time or longer with most recipes.)

Very moist and delicious. Was looking to make bread with what I had on hand, which did not include chocolate chips, this recipe is wonderful without them! The cinnamon gives it a warm, spicy kick, almost like Mexican chocolate.

This recipe deserves the 5 Stars, it's above all other zucchini bread I've tried and I've been using my garden or the neighbors  harvest since the 70's. 
It has great chocolate flavor, cake like texture, simple and easy, everything I had on hand. Would not change a thing and will keep this recipe! It's a real treat!

Loved it and I don't like  chocolate bread or zucchini!  I think I can easily say this is the best sweet bread I've ever tasted.  It was surprisingly moist with a very rich chocolate flavor.  I've made it twice.  The first time I tried to reduce the amount of oil and zucchini, but found it to be more of a brownie in texture.  On the second attempt I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  So my only advice is not to skimp on anything.  My only complaint is it's addictive.

I baked this in little mini bundt molds and they came out beautiful and very tasty. It takes approximately 20-24 minutes to cook this way. I will be making these again.

I made a few healthy additions and a tasty addition!   I added 2 Tb ground flax seed.   It was not noticeable at all, I may add 4 Tb next time.   I also replaced some white flour with Buckwheat.   I was not sure how it would change the flavor but it too was not noticeable so I may use 1/2 cup next time.   I also added 1 cup of 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate chips and I used organic butter inst√≥ margarine.   It turned out great and my family is devouring it!

Good recipe. Made it gluten free by substituting gluten free flour blend for flour called for in recipe and 1 tsp of xanthan gum. I also had a package of chocolate chips on hand and put half the bag in the dough, and the other half sprinkled on top after pouring dough into the pan. I will be making this again!

Love it!! Used about 3 1/2 cups zucchini and it made it super moist. Not as sweet as the recipe  I usually make but it's just as good and I didn't need chocolate chips.

This is AMAZING!  Love that the recipe makes two loaves.  One did not last any time at all in our house.  I took the second to some new neighbors who just moved in and they raved about it also.  Super easy and really good.  A great way to use up zucchini.  Really, really moist!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe it was very good.
It was perfectly moist . I followed this recipe to the T but for some reason my bread fell in the middle and it stuck to the bottom of the pan even tho I sprayed it down with pam.
I will try this recipe again and next time I think I'll add more flour.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  The cinnamon and nutmeg really highlight the flavor of the dark chocolate.   This is definitely a keeper!

Great recipe!  Has a lighter texture than other zucchini bread recipes I've tried.  Not an over-the-top chocolate, just the right amount.  Baking for 40 min was not enough time, I baked for 1 hour.

I used butter because I never buy margarine, and I used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon because I thought the spice would be too aggressive for our particular tastes.  Because the more chocolaty a dessert is, the better my husband likes it, I added  a cup of chocolate chips to enhance the chocolate flavor and it was a hit.

Mine also fell in the middle and stuck to the bottom despite being sprayed. After thinking about it I realized I forgot the baking powder and a 1/2 c of flour!!!!! REALLY!? Geez. I guess I was distracted with my 9 y.o "helping" me. I think this cake has great potential. It is still tasty even with my fails. I also added some course sea salt to the top after baking. It really goes well with the chocolate.  I'm going to add some dark chocolate next time and some rum!

I loved the flavor.  Mine came out too dry. I overbaked. 
I'm gonna try a different pan next time.

It would help if the recipe were more specific as to the size of the loaf pans (4x8, or 5x9).  I have only 5x9, and all that mix filled each one to only about 1.5" depth.  So I combined all the mix into one pan (about 3" depth).  It's in the oven now.  Fingers crossed!

I love this recipe. It turns out well each and every time I made it. It is good just the way the recipe instructs to make it, but when I have some walnuts at hand I chop them and add them which adds a crunch that I enjoy.
The bread freezes well, I bake it in the smaller loaf pans, so I can take one out whenever I feel like having the bread.
