A good recipe.  Anyone who didn't add the things they truly enjoy to their burritos, only cheated themselves.  Nothing is ever etched into concrete!  First, always please yourself, but don't trash the recipe because you didn't.

Excellent!  I added cheese to the burrito filling and put a bit on top.  Also, put sour cream and shredded lettuce on before serving.

Very tasty with salsa and extra sharp cheddar but a little bland on its own.  A good recipe -- it just requires a little "doctoring" to taste.

I thought the recipe was good. My kids even liked it.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredded that and I used brown rice instead of white.  I served the tomatoes and the green onions on the side so my kids wouldn't complain.  I also through a handful of cheese into the meet mixture right before I filled the tortillas.

Based on the other reviews, I added lots of Chipotle and diced jalepano.  It still wasn't quite spicy enough for me, but I thought it was great. Can't wait to tweak the recipe a little more.

I use a store bought rotisserie chicken that I shred, 1 can hot enchilada sauce and a can of refried beans and mix all of this with the cooked rice.  I wrap up the burritos and top with a little more enchilada sauce and monteray jack cheese.  I bake them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Yum!

I used brown rice instead of white and cooked it longer. It was yummy, the brown rice adding a little nutty flavor. Used sour cream, no gaucamole; still yummy.

I noticed they made some changes to this recipie since an earlier version that I saw. This was an nice simple meal. Next time I may try it with canned chicken -if that works this would be a super easy throw together quick working mom kind of meal!

It did come out nicely as far as texture but was a little bland and dry - I was hoping for a little more "sauce" to it.  The recipe says to put in the tomato sauce twice and so I put it in before cooking - next time will try afterwards.  It's an excellent base recipe to build on.

Even my 4 year old liked this recipe.  I thought it could use more zip, but surely something I will make again.  I used whole wheat tortillas and brown rices (success rice -- it is parboiled).

Very good.  Just the right amount of spice.  I used brown rice.  We fixed them kind of like tacos, using the topping we liked -- shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar, sour cream.  I served it with a side of black beans and corn.

Nice flavor for a classic burrito.  We added black beans, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole to each burrito.  If you do like spice I would add a spicy salsa or taco sauce to it.  My husband and I thought it was great !!!

I have had this recipe for a long time. In fact it's the one my younger brother asks for when he comes over to my house. I actually passed it on to his new wife. They just got married.

This one's great! We'll definitely have this again. Used the HOT Lawry's Taco Seasoning instead -- too hot for me. Tasted even better the next day!

Made a couple of changes, but these were a HUGE hit. I used an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes, added a bit of leftover corn I had in the fridge, and used regular onion in place of the green because that's all I had. I also used chicken broth instead of the water for the rice. Everyone loved them!!

Excellent!  I used hamburger in place of the chicken.  I think each individual can add extra "hot" if needed.  To me, it was jussssst right!  :)

My whole family loved them.  I used ground beef and minute rice to make things quicker.  I also used flax seed wraps to make it healthier.  I just threw it all in a pan until the consistency was right.  We put the cheddar cheese inside each burrito before baking.  I will definately make these again.  We found them very, very filling.

This was GREAT!  I did add another 1/2 cup of shredded chicken, though, and skipped the tomatoes (I don't like them).  Topped it off w/salsa and sour cream . . . mmmmmm.

I would suggest cooking the rice first. Also, the ingredients call for one can of tomato sauce, but the directions call for two. Because we didn't have two, we had to improvise and use salsa, which was okay. Not sure if we'll make this again. Just a basic chicken burrito.

This was good but just not that good.  Husband liked it alot but I just wasnt a fan.  Would have been really good with tortillas, guac, sour cream and maybe lettuce.  But by it self it was just lacking something.
