My dad has been making this since I was little - we LOVE this dish.  Ours is a little different.  We use 8 oz of sour cream (instead of 16 oz).  We do not use the following: milk, parsley, or paprika.  Make sure the onion and green pepper are chopped very fine.  BEFORE adding the cheese on top, COVER and bake at 350 for one hour.  Remove from oven, generously sprinkle with cheddar uncovered, and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes.  YUMMO!

Personally I would have given this 5 stars, I really liked it, but the kids said yuk and my husband and his brother said it was ok, nothing special.  Was a good complement to a grilled steak dinner, good flavor.  I'd make this again for an all-adult crowd. I also liked that it was done and cooking while I was busy with the other food and cleanup.  It was easy to make also.

This recipe was very easy to make. instead of the seasoning i just used a prepared seasoning mix. cooked for around 2 hours. My 2 year old daughter LOVED IT!! I made this for thanksgiving dinner and every single person was raving about how creamy and flavorful it was. REALLY GREAT RECIPE!!

I chose this for a sorority fundraiser dinner.  We served  80 people and the raves flew in.  I baked it a bit longer due to the volume we made. Shredded potatoes taste much better than the cubed. Can't wait to have this again.  Save left overs for breakfast with your eggs.

This recipe was yummy!  I even accidentally bought potato rounds instead of the hash browns and it was great.  I am giving it a 4 because I didn't need to cook it nearly as long as the recipe said.  I cooked it for 1 hour and it was heated through nicely.

Excellent.  Should try a little cheese in the potato mixture in addition to what is on top.  Could probably come out in less time than the recipe calls for.

This is better if you smash the tator tots, leave out the cream of celery, milk and bell pepper and cut way back on the parsley. Add 2 cups shredded cheddar into the mix and top with extra cheddar. Cover with foil and you won't have to cook as long. Take foil off the last few minutes and the top will brown a little.

A four-star recipe as is.  The second time I made it, I used only cream of mushroom soup and omitted the green pepper.  I sprinkled French's french-fried onions on the top and the result was heavenly.  The french-fried onions give it SUCH delicious flavor!

Been making this for YEARS, with only onion and one soup.  It is a must have and always requested for every gathering.    I don't know about green pepper for most, but I'm going to try it.

I have been making a similar recipe for years. I leave out the milk, paprika, and bell pepper and I switch the cream of potato for cream of chicken.  With 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese mixed in, it is fabulous. You can also cook this in the crock pot on low for 5 1/2 hrs or on high for around 2 1/2 hrs.

It was so tasty, reminded me of perfect comfort food. I think you could add just about any veggies to it & it would turn out perfect.

We really liked this.  I followed everything exactly except I didn't have a pepper, paprika, or parsley and it was still fantastic.  Next time I'm going to make sure I have the rest of the ingredients.  :o)

I didn't have 16 oz sour cream so I used another can of soup (cream of broccoli since that's what I had).  I mixed 1/2 cup of cheese into mix too.  Very creamy!  Loved it!

This recipe is very creamy and easy to put together. However, I thought that I had read the recipe incorrectly when it said 1/2 CUP of parsley. I personally think this is too much parsley, and unfortunately was a very overpowering flavor for this casserole. I'll try making this again, only next time I'll use around 1/8 cup of parsley. I also didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, so I used crushed Ritz crackers on top, which gave a nice change in texture to this dish. Overall, an easy recipe, but I would recommend using less than a 1/2 cup of parsley if you don't want that overpowering flavor and actually want to taste the potatoes!

everyone said it was ok but I tweaked it alot.  I didn't feel like going to the store so I used 1 cup rice cooked in beef bullion. I had corn to be added. not everyone in my house likes corn so it became optional. I used cream of chicken soup as the add in, instead of what was suggested. Sour cream was an add in because not everyone in my house likes it. and I added meatballs to it. This may be why they said ok instead of good.
