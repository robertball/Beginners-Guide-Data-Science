I did not have high hopes for this dip - it just didn't seem like the ingredients listed would magically blend up into something with a dip consistency. Was I ever wrong! The flavor is amazing, the assembly couldn't be easier, and the heat is just right. I used an IPA for the beer and the flavor really shined. Give this one a try!

I suggested this recipe to a friend on thebuzz, today.  I don't usually make recipe suggestions that I haven't tried. The longer I thought about this today, I just knew I had to make it, as I knew the men in my family would love.  Well, I was correct.  It says: "Spread tastes best when refrigerated overnight to blend flavors, but it can be served right away if needed."  Well, it wasn't needed right away, but that didn't stop my DH from chowing down with a few pretzels.  I took a bowl out to my dad and he liked it also.  I told them both to wait until tomorrow or Sunday (Super Bowl) and it would taste even better.  I'm taking a larger bowl down to my son in Tennessee to enjoy, and I have no doubt he will like it, also.  I used a Yuengling® Amber Beer for the flavoring. Can't wait to give this cheese dip a try on Sunday!  (Super Bowl XLIX (49) New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks)

I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but it is very bitter, bad texture and overall yuck.

Be advised this IS a thicker cheese spread. You should be able to tell that from the pictures and the DIRECTIONS.  This is not a runny, velveeta cheese dip. If you want those....well there are recipes for that, go find one. Having said that, this dip has a wonderful flavor! You really, really do want to leave it overnight. The cheese flavor gets a little of its own back overnight and the beer flavor mellows out.  Basically, after a night in the fridge, the flavor is spot on.  If you eat it right away, be prepared for it to taste mostly like beer.   I usually use a lager or pilsner....sometimes a light brown beer even.  I let it come to room temperature and serve it with fresh, soft pretzels. There is never anything at all left over.

So quick and delicious! I was in the mood for a beer cheese dip but didn't want the hassle of baking. I didn't really have high hopes for any that weren't baked-how can a speedy dip like this rival a warm gooey baked cheese dip? Believe me, it does! The flavor is great, although I found it a little too spicy so I threw in about 4oz cream cheese to cool it down. It took longer than two minutes to get smooth, but I just let the processor run and it was creamy without a hint of grittiness.  This one's definitely a keeper-and so many possibilities for varying flavors with different beers and cheeses.  Thanks for this recipe John!

It was great! I made two batches. The second batch, I doubled the salt and did 3 teaspoons of Worcestershire and that was the trick to nailing it!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the extra sharp cheddar and beer (I used an IPA) were overpowering. I was hoping the other ingredients would counteract the bitterness of the cheese and beer but they were too subtle.  It was too bitter.

This recipe turned out perfectly and tastes amazing! We didn't modify anything and used Country Boy's Nacho Bait Habanero Blonde Ale for the beer to give it a little extra kick. Incredible. Best beer cheese we've ever had!

I made this recipe for the first time to take to a Kentucky Derby party. It turned out wonderfully delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for using sharp cheddar instead of extra sharp. Also, I used Bell's Oberon Ale which worked well. For a more malty complex flavor, you could use a darker beer and it would still turn out great. I served this dip with crackers and pita bread, although, it would be wonderful with soft pretzels too.

Great recipe!!!  Have used different types of beers and cheeses. My favorite is using the habanero sculpin beer and a fresh jalapeño from my garden.

I love this sort of cheese but I did not enjoy this recipe. I don’t think the garlic powder and possibly the peppers went well with the rest of the ingredients.

I made this for a Christmas Eve party,  simple to make.  There was nothing leftover.  Everyone  loved it.  
I used Ziganbach,   a dark beer  made in Texas,  and it really came through with the flavors I was looking for.  
Highly recommend this recipe

The flavor was good. I don't own a food processor, so I used a hand mixer. It never mixed, even when I heated it a little.  So I put it in the fridge and it was still solid on the bottom, soupy on top.  Then I baked it, nope.  It needs some sort of binder.

Just the right amount of everything in this beer cheese spread. I used an Odell Drumroll for the beer too and it turned out great!

I was attending a birthday party  was last weekend, and I was searching for an appetizer to bring to the party.  One that would not need reheating (I didn't want to occupy her stove).  I found this recipe from my go-to guy, Chef John and the rest was history.  

I found this to be incredibly addicting, from the get-go.... so did all the guests!  I used a Bud Light that was gathering dust in my fridge, but I think I'll try a Sam Adams next just to see what will happen.  The best part is, the day after (when we were hungover on the couch), my guy surprised me by making a grilled cheese for me using this spread and copious amounts of pepperjack.  BEST HANGOVER MEAL, EVER.  Thank you, Chef John!

This was amazingly fabulous!  I don't drink beer but I needed to bring something to a potluck for work and had all the ingredients in the house.  Hands down favorite of the potluck, everyone raved about it and scraped the serving bowl clean!
