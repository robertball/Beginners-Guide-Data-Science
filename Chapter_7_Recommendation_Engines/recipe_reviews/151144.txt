Terrific frosting recipe! It tasted delicious on my gingerbread cookies and when dried, it wasn't at all sticky or tacky~just a great consistency. 

Thank you for a wonderful frosting recipe! =)

Just remember that with the spices the frosting won't be white.  Tastes good and actually enhanced the cookie flavor, which is neat as I tend not to like frosting.  I used it with the Gingerbread Boys recipe by Janice Brubaker.

This is incredible icing!

I wanted to use the Big Soft Ginger Cookies for a fall sandwich cookie and needed a complimentary icing. This was the one. I added a tbsp. of butter and a little vanilla and doubled the recipe. This was the best icing. I could see how this would be good on a pumpkin or sugar cookie, too. It sets up well, too.

Great recipe! Was a great addition to our Gingerbread Men cookie recipe. Added a little more powdered sugar to make it a little thicker so it would stay on the cookies, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Turned out brown, but looked great on the gingerbread cookies with candies and sprinkles on top!
Merry Christmas!

AMAZING!  I added the 1 TBSP of Butter (creamed) and it turned out to be the perfect spreading consistency for Gingerbread... not cookies...Gingerbread cake.  When I took a bite of the gingerbread cake with this frosting it was like a spice explosion in my mouth!  My husband said "You ARE making more of these for Christmas!"  This icing would also be excellent on sugar cookies.

This is a really nice alternative to a typical vanilla glaze. I have made this recipe many times as it has so many good uses, and I'm always asked for the recipe. I would recommend at least doubling the recipe as it only makes about 1/4 cup. I have used this to drizzle lightly on pumpkin gingerbread as well as pumpkin ginger cupcakes, and also to glaze gingerbread cutouts and apple quick breads and muffins.

I thought this was wonderful!!!  I used it to ice the "big soft ginger cookies" from this site.  The only changes I made were to increase it to ice 48 cookies and I added a dash of mexican vanilla.  The taste is delicious and the texture is perfect.  It set within minutes so that I could pack them away before they were devoured!

This frosting was excellent on my Gingerbread cut-out cookies, I thought the taste would be too strong, but the spices blend very well together so it tastes just right. I am sure this would be good with all kinds of sweets!

Perfect on the Big Soft Ginger Cookies!  I did put it in the fridge for a while first to let it firm up.  Also make sure cookies are cooled first.

This was exceedingly easy and required no special ingredients. I substituted nutmeg for the cloves in a pinch, and drizzled the icing over a yellow bundt cake - turned out fantastic!

The flavor is excellent and the frosting sets fairly quickly, though I had a hard time getting it as thick as I would like.  It really picked up some bland anise cookies!

I found this recipe while searching for a spicy frosting that would save my gingerbread cookies from the overwhelming molasses flavor that had turned out. This frosting was great, but still wasn't gingery enough for my molasses flavored gingerbread cookies. So, I pressed a chunk of ginger in my garlic press, mixed in the resulting juice and pulp, and ended up with the perfect balance of spice and heat that made the cookies a hit.

YUM! this frosting has a kick like red-hots. 
I used this on the "Soft gingerbread cookies" and it was the perfect combo. (yes there is a non-teeth-breaking recipe for gingerbread cookies).

Fantastic!  I replaced all seasonings with 1 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning- yum! The color comes out brown, but nothing a little food coloring can't cure... :-)

I made this to frost the "big soft ginger cookies" from this sight and they worked so beautifully together! The spices in the frosting and the cookies worked so well together and made the cookie even more special! Needless to say i got rave reviews about this frosting! Thank you so much.

This was a new concept for me - didn't think to add spices to the frosting.  As far as taste; it's ok, but did get real runny after one day.  Probably wouldn't make again unless we weren't planning on any leftovers.

Needed something in a hurry. Reviews were great help!!!  Mixed creamy cream cheese frosting (yes, from container) with ground cloves & cinnamon according to recipe. Added 1 tsp. Almond extract. Stir well. Great fragrance; still creamy white-ish color. Really blended well with gingerbread.  Cooked cake. Spread icing. Enjoyed praises!

This is the first time I have tried this recipe and contrary to what I typically do, which is to make the recipe the first time exactly as posted, I made some modifications by doubling the recipe, substituting water for non-fat milk, and adding a little food coloring and a tablespoon of light corn syrup.

Pretty good when topped on homemade ginger cookies :)

This is an easy recipe but I found I had to add a little more milk to get the consistency I wanted. An added bonus is It made my sugar cookies taste like spiced cookies!

Tastes great! I used it for gingerbread cookies. Only downside is that because it is brown from all the spices, all the kids preferred using a white icing for decorating. All the adults preferred this icing, though.

This is my go to recipe for frosting my gingerbread cookies every year at Christmas.  Yes, the frosting is brown, yes it is heavy on the spices and yes it is a little thin.  With all that in mind, a little goes a long way on the cookies and it gives them just enough of a different taste to set your cookies apart from all the others.  The biggest bonus of this frosting is that after it sets on the cookies it makes them very moist.  I get lots of compliments on how moist my gingerbread cookies are and how much better they taste than others they have tried.  I always say that the secret is in the frosting.

Evidently "fitmommy" didn't look at the huge picture at the top or deduce that dark-colored spices will result in a dark-colored icing.  smh

This icing is a wonderful alternative to the standard, white gingerbread icing.  It does have a slight kick to it, so if you are working with a very spicy cookie, you may want to cut back just slightly on the spice measures.

Followed the recipe.  I forgot to roll my molasses cookies in sugar so they turned out kind of bland.  This glaze saved them!  I will be  making more of the mistake cookies with glaze in the future.

Used this recipe to top AR's Gingerbread Biscotti. It was perfect as far as taste. I suggest doubling the original recipe unless you are aiming for a paper thin covering.

This frosting is brown, not even close to white or off white.  It is heavy on the spices and very runny.  I triple checked to make sure I had all of the measurements correct & I made it exactly as listed.  I will take the other readers suggestions & add more powdered sugar & butter to try to save it.

Lovely and unique flavor! It is a warm spicy flavor without overpowering your cookies or whatever you put it on. I did not have cloves, so just omitted and found it very nice. I don't think I would add cloves it I had them. Mine was a tiny bit soft - I was trying to decorate cookies, so maybe next time I would add a bit more powdered sugar. Keep it in the fridge or stick it in the freezer a few minutes when working with it.

Really good, but I had no milk, so I used heavy cream and I added more than the recipe called for, only because it was drying out too quickly. The taste was great, though!

I used this with Spicy & Soft Gingerbread Cookies and it was so yummy.  I was quite surprised!  Would definitely make again.
