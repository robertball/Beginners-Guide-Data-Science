I liked this pie. However, I followed the recipe of one of the reviewers. I also used 1/3 C butter and 1/3 C sugar and I also used 6 pears. When I make it again I will add cinnamin to the custard to add a little more flavor. I did sprinkle cinnamin and sugar on the top of the pie once it came out of the oven. that added a little more flavor. My husband LOVED it!

This recipe reminds me of one my grandma gave me that has rhubarb in it, I love the custard. I wanted to use up some pears and this really worked. I used 6 pears instead of 2, used a deep dish pie pan, and a pillsbury pie crust. I also added one egg,to make 3 total changed the sugar to 1/3, the butter to 1/3 and added a dash of salt. It turned out so beautiful, and it used up more fruit. Thanks for a recipe I will use again and again!

This is a fantastic recipe. I used brown sugar in the custard and it had a rich, delicious color and flavor. Sprinkle the tops with a little cinnamon/brown sugar and add ground nutmeg to the pears. Delicious!

This is delicious! I used up about 5 small pears that were just about over-ripe.  I had arranged them in a really pretty pattern, but it was all covered up by the custard- which was ok in the end, as it is absolutely delicious.  Mine made a thin golden-brown meringue layer on the top, and did not take anywhere near the whole hour to bake.
I made butter-flaky crust from this site and made only half the crust recipe to achieve a thin bottom crust.  I also "marinated" my pears in some lemon juice after they were sliced while I prepared everything else, which kept them from turning too brown and added a little flavor as well.  Can't wait to make this for company!

Great recipe! I tried this out on Family Night and everyone loved it! My only suggestion is to use ripe soft pears. I can't imagine this tasting as great as it did with the crunchier pears. I also added a dash of cinnamon to spice it up a bit. The cooking time was a bit longer than an hour, but all in all, a great recipe that takes some time to prepare but so worth it!

The only thing I did different is the crust. I used one cup of flour, one tbsp. of sugar and 1/2 cup of butter. I put it through a processor and then pressed it in the bottom of the cake pan. Then I put the pears on top of it and poured the egg batter over the top and cooked it. Yummmmmmy

I was really surprised how much I like this pie, the only thing I did different was to slice the pears at the bottom of the pie. It was easy to make and everyone liked it!

Very good. Used pears from friend's tree. Now I will have to make it every year:).  Use 1/4 pound butter, not 1/4 cup butter. Also, I cut the white suger to 3/4 cup and changed the Vanilla to 3teasp.+ 1 teasp almond extract.

Great recipe!!  I have a pear tree and have been trying to figure out what to do with the fruit.  To soften the pears, I first diced them up and simmered them with a 1/2C of water on the stovetop.  Once softened, I followed the recipe.  Just a couple of substitutions as suggested by previous reviews:  1/3C butter (margarine) and 1/3C sugar.  Also did 1/2T of almond extract and 1/2T vanilla and added some ground cinnamon.  Loved it!!!

I thought this pie was awesome!  I made this for my husband and father in law, and they loved it too! I used 3 very large bosc pears, pealed them and cut them about 1/2" thick. I let them set in Lemon Juice while prepping other things. I took the advise of some of the other reviews and upped the butter to about 1 & 1/4 sticks, added about 1/4 cup brown sugar, and one more egg (total 3), and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the custard mix.  I also used Splenda instead of sugar (father in law is type 2.)  I sprinkled the top of the pie with Cinnamon Sugar lightly, and it got a very nice golden brown crust. The other thing I did was I thought that maybe the crust would get burned in the oven for a whole hour, so about 1/2 way through, I pulled it out and covered the edges of the pie with foil and it stayed nice and golden brown. Thanks so much for the recipe, I will definitely make this again!

This was a really great recipe.  Use really ripe pears for this.  The custard was delicious and would also be a great base for a mixed berry pie.

This was really good but too sweet. The next time I make this I will cut down the sugar and probably wait for the pears to get supper ripe. Mine were a little crunchy.

I made this pie for my husband's birthday because he is not a cake man.  It was easy to make and got rave reviews.   I read the reviews here and made the following changes before I made it based on some of the recommendations and it came out great  1.  Peeled and sliced 4 Bosc pears that had been marinated in about 2 tbsp lemon juice to prevent them from browning.  The large slices were placed in the outer ring and the smaller slices on the top in the center.  When they were covered with the custard, they made a pretty pattern.  2.  Sprinkled about 3/4 tsp. cinnamon atop pears.  3.   Reduced sugar in custard to 3/4 cup, increased butter to 1/2 cup and reduced vanilla to 1 tsp.   I would add the words "spread the custard over the pie." because mine was not really pouring consistency.  4.  The pie only took about 50 minutes to cook, but I kept my eye on it after 40 minutes.  It is easy to tell when the custard has set and browned.  This recipe is a keeper.  For a gourmet touch, next time I would stripe chocolate sauce under the pie.  I served chocolates on the side this time and the combination of flavours was good.
This custard would work with other fruits too such as plums or peaches.

What a beautiful pie! And delicious too. I sliced my pears before fanning them into the plate. I also added about 2 T chopped candied ginger into the egg mixture before pouring it over the pears. After baking, I cut a couple of the larger pieces of ginger into leaf shapes and arranged them on top of the pie for a Thanksgiving dinner. It was wonderful. Serve it warm if you can.

i made this following the directions the 1st time and it was good, so i tweaked it a little to make it amazing!
I added a pinch of cinnamon,  1/4 tsp nutmeg, and about 1/2 cup milk.  I cut the pears into slices and arranged them like the picture has. I was so good! even my picky little brother liked it! 
 Make sure your pears are very ripe or they will still be crunchy when your custard is done!

I did make some modifications to this, but I thought it was pretty good.  I used two apples and two pears, because two pears alone didn't seem like enough.  I also cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 of great local honey.  I wish there had been more filling, because the filling didn't come up high enough and there was a lot of crust at the top.  Next time I would consider doubling the filling recipe.  It tasted really good though (I used Martha Stewart's pie crust recipe).

Great pear pie. One of the best parts is when the custard near the top/edges caramelizes and has a great rich flavor. Like one reviewer, I used a cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, which made the flavor nice and rich, while still light. I also sliced the pears and arranged them in layers (pears, custard, pear, custard). This made it look really nice when serving slices and allows you to get a good custard/pear ratio throughout.

I tried it once with someone else's suggestion of using 3 eggs and only 1/3 cup of sugar, then I made it again using the original recipe (2 eggs, 1 cup sugar). Using 2 eggs and a whole cup of sugar was way better-tasting, for me. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg.

Fantastic.  Even my picky eater enjoyed it.  After reading changes I made my own.  4 ripe Pears quartered, 1/3 cup butter, 1/3 cup flour, 1 tbs. cinnamon, 3 eggs.  The custard filled the pie crust and after @ 45 min. made a beautiful golden brown topping with a moist center. Not one crumb left.  Thank you for the recipe and thanks to all who left comments about what changes they made.

Great Recipe! Making another one tonight since the one from last night is gone already! Got rave reviews from my bf and roommate...I added crushed pineapple, brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla. Very tasty and gave it more flavor I thought!

Just made the pie and everyone loved it.  1 tsp vanilla instead of 1 T.  2 pears and 2 apples to fill pie shell.  Covered top to keep from over browning.  Cooked 40 min.  Will make often.  Fast and easy

Whole family loved it. A great fruit pie with no top crust which means less work and it looks so tasty!  I added about a cup of frozen cranberries and it made a beautiful holiday pie.  I just made it with frozen peaches and raspberries and it was equally delicious.  I will thoroughly thaw the peaches next time as it was a bit soggy but still looked good.

I started with kind of mushy pears, so I was worried this would be mushy and not good, but the custard firmed up the whole thing and the pears gave a really nice flavor. I served it on Thanksgiving, and got rave reviews. This recipe is a keeper!

This is almost exactly the same as the recipe my husband's grandmother gave me, but her recipe has 1/4 c. cream which I added. Her recipe also calls for 1 c. of sugar, but I always only do a 1/4 cup because I find pears are naturally sweet and I always double the pears. :) The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I think it needs way more than 2 pears....You can also used canned pear halves or slices if it is all you have. It's quite good. I buy the kind in natural pear juice, not syrup.

Excellent recipe with the exception of cutting the sugar(used brown) & butter to 1/3C as suggested by other ppl: adding 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg and a sprinkle of lemon juice to the pears! Delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good dessert.   Used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.   It got a crusty top and left a hole where each pear was placed.   it looked like a picture!  Every one loved it.   I put it in a tart pan and it looked quite awesome.  It was super easy too!

Fantastic pie.  I used 1 cup of flour with 4 Tbsp butter, 1 Tbsp sugar, a handful of walnuts, and lots of cinnamon and nutmeg for the crust, which I made in the food processor.  I pressed that into the 9" pan to make a crumbly and rich crust.  I also used apples instead of pears, which I sliced into eighths and arranged in two concentric circles.  For the batter, I used only about 1/2 cup sugar and a little less butter than called for as well.  It turned out delicious and not too unhealthy. Can't wait to try it with pears.  Served it with vanilla ice cream, but I think whipped cream with diced crystallized ginger will also be great.  Fantastic recipe that lends itself to a lot of variation.

I chopped the pears - otherwise, the pieces are too large and hard to eat. I was also able to use 5 medium pears this way. Thanks - my coworkers raved about it!

This was the 1st time making a Pear Pie and it was super easy! I halved and sliced the pears and added fresh lemon juice to it and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon....then followed the directions. It was a huge hit! Super quick and delicious! Thank you!

This was delicious!  You should not start with sweet pears or it will be too sweet.  D'anjou work best.  You can also cut them into small pieces if you like or chop apples in this recipe.  I have been trying to find this for a long time.  My Mother in Law in the South made this once and I loved it.  She is aging and could not remember how to make it.  It is also called Ozark Pudding.  YUM!

This pie was a big hit! The only thing I did different was how I arranged the pears. Instead of just cutting them in half, I cut them in fourths and then in slivers and arranged them in a triple layer spiral. It was beautiful and delicious. Any time pears go on sale I will definitely be making this pie.

Extremely easy to make.  I recommend as the photos do, slice the pears instead of halving them, they fit better.  Use as many pears as will fit.  IMO, no need to peel the pears.

Amazing! I added some cinnamon, dried cranberries, chopped apples, and a few walnuts. It looked beautiful and tasted even better! Also I didn't peel the pears and it turned out great. 

Super easy! Highly suggest!

This is a delicious pie!  I sliced three pears and coated them with lemon juice then spread onto crust.  I added 1tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the custard mixture.  I meant to add salt, but forgot.  I will add salt next time.  After the custard was spread onto the pears I sprinkled with a little cinnamon and sugar.  Cooking time was about an hour.

Word to the wise, this is definitely a deep dish pie.  I used two regular store-bought crusts and the pies overflowed all of the custard.  Still looks good, but disappointing that it's not quite as 'custardy' as it's meant to be.

This recipe was a success for me, a first for fruit pies I've tried to make. Because I live at a high elevation, fruit pies have turned out very soupy until now. This turned out with exactly the consistency I'd hoped for. I should also mention that this was a pretty forgiving recipe, since I didn't follow the techniques exactly (it being late in the evening and I was in a hurry), but I did use the exact ingredients and measurements. Pears are kind of a different fruit to have in a pie, but they tasted pretty good here (I think the ones I used were Bosc - I don't know my pears very well). Slices of this pie taste great when slightly warmed. I recommend this highly!

I followed the recipe exactly except for the time in the oven. Mine made a crunchy meringue type crust on top but the custard never set, even with extra time in the oven. It is raining outside today, I know that affects cakes....

I made this pie three times (once with apples) and the last version worked the best.  Here is is:-  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Core four pears, slice thinly and arrange fan-style in layers around the unbaked pie shell.  Cream 2 oz of butter with 1/3 cup of sugar.  Add 2 beaten eggs and beat until light and fluffy.  Carefully stir in 1/3 cup of flour. Add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla essence and 1/2 teaspoon almond essence.  Beat the white of one egg until stiff peaks form, then use a metal spoon or knife to cut it into the flour mixture as if making a souffle.  Spoon the mixture over the pears taking care so as not to deflate the air within it.  Sprinkle lightly with cinammon.  Place the pie on a wire cooling rack and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 375 for a further 25 minutes, then lower heat to 350 degrees for a further 20 minutes (one hour in total).  The pie is cooked when the top is golden brown and the custard is set.  If liquid is visible the pie is not cooked.  Remove the wire rack with the pie on it and allow it to cool completely before slicing.  Take care when removing from the oven as the pie is fragile until cool.  The result will be a 'frangipani' type of pear tart, with firm but soft fruit surrounded by a soft custard topped with a crisp slightly chewy and meringue like top.  The recipe can be prepared in the same way with apples but it needs only about 40 minutes baking time, 15 minutes at 425 then 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees.

I thought this was ok. It certainly was nice to have a different type of fruit pie, however, I think I'll look for other pear recipes. I mad this for my husband, parents, and brother, and none of us thought it was really anything special.

I doubled the pears, and added a sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon on top. Everyone thought the pie was goos, just lacking in flavor. My husband suggested soaking the pears in brandy before baking??

Very good.  I cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar instead, and I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon and craisins.  Took much longer to bake than the recipe stated, I had to cover it with foil after about 40 minutes.  Probably took 80 minutes total.

My first time making this pie and boy did my husband love it. Though it was done in about 45~50 minutes 350* and I made the graham cracker crust but I didn't have enough graham crackers so mixed it with ginger snap cookies and also added sliced almonds, add melted butter and some sugar. Oh, I also used light brown sugar not white. For finish used powdered sugar. Very light, not sour but yet not too sweet. Very elegant taste. If you like really sweet, add vanilla ice cream on top or whip cream would be great also.

Pretty good.  I bought pears for Thanksgiving and decided to make this instead of apple pie.  I forgot to put foil over it to prevent overbrowning so it didn't look as pretty as it should but it was good.  Nice and light flavor. It was missing something though.  I think I'll follow other reviews next time and add some spices to the custard filling.  That might help.  Sprinkling the pears with nutmeg was not enough.

This was suprisingly awesome, didnt expect it to be as good as it was.  Had a bunch of pears to use up, company coming, and I needed dessert!  This was a definite hit, the last piece was fought over, and eaten out of the pie plate.  I did use the cinnamon on top, as someone else suggested.

I added some cinnamon and nutmeg and used three ripe pairs, cut into eight slices each.  I also increased the butter to 1/3 cup and used only 1/2 cup of sugar.  I was concerned about the crust burning so I wrapped foil around the edges for the first 40 minutes... delicious and easy.

I was a bit skeptical about how juicy pears would taste with custard. I usually don't like combinations like that. However, I had some pears I really needed to use up, and wanted to try something new. I am so glad I did! I can out soooo delicious! Perfect consistency. Not runny or weird at all. It semed like the custard was more like a caramel which paired perfectly with the pears. Everyone in my family who tasted it loved it! Delicious. Thanks so much for this easy to make no fuss great recipe!

I am not a cook for any kitchen. In fact my husbands family always assigns me the store bought salad for family pot lucks. I had some pears left over from canning and felt ambitious so I tried this recipe out. The only thing I did different was fill the bottom of the pie pan with one layer of pears, sprinkle a little nutmeg over them (like someone suggested) and used 1 tsp of vanilla (cause I've never seen 1 Tbsp of vanilla in anything). It said to cook it for an hour and thanks to my horrible oven, the top was brown by 30 minutes and the center wasn't quite done. We figured we'd try it anyway and we couldn't believe how great it was. The pie was gone in one day and we sneaked bites here or there to hide it from our children. It's a great recipe!

Excellent. I used four pears rather than two and cut them into thin slices, this way they got distributed better throughout the pie. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the custard. This was delicious both hot and cold.

I'm a pretty poor cook, a kitchen klutz and I've made this 3 times now. My whole family are astonished I can make anything this good. My kids beg me to make it. It comes out perfect every time and is so easy. Although the recipe is a little sweet for my liking so I use only 1/2 cup of sugar.

I made this with ~2 medium sized bosc pears sliced thinly, 1/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, 1/4 cup butter.  This was just the right amount of sweetness for my family (we don't like desserts overwhelmingly powered by sugar.)   I used a regular pie crust and the filling was not enough to go to the top.  I would definitely add more custard filling next time and alternate layers of sliced pears with custard instead of pouring custard just on top.  Delicious and easy recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! I used a different type of pastry, fillo pastry and used 4 sheets.  I sprayed light olive oil between the sheets as I layered them.  It worked out fantastically because it was flaky, airy and light. I only cooked it for about 45 minutes and found it cooked thoughout the whole pie. My family loved it!!!  Next time I would only cook it for 30 minutes on 155 fan forced as it was still meringue texture on top

I made this adding cinnamon, but.....forgot the flour.  It was delicious without it.  The top became caramelized and crispy. My two friends said don't change a thing.  I gave 5 stars for several reasons, it is very easy to make, excellent flavor and this can be the basis for many other ingredients.  They both thought it was apple pie.

I've made this pie twice now to great reviews. Because I have a 100 years old heirloom pear tree on my property, I use those pears. They grow very small, however and are hard, unlike many GM pears on the market. I solved the problem by poaching them in a sugar water with a stick of cinnamon and 6 cloves. This solved the problem many cited about too little flavor.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon in the custard as suggested. Very, very tasty.

The reviews all said to up the butter and lower the sugar. I ended up with a gross buttery mess. DO NOT up the butter to half cup as all it did was just ooze out of the cooled pie. I regret following users suggestions as the pie is not tasty at all. I did 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3 eggs (everything else the same). If I ever have over ripe pears on hand, I'll follow the recipe with maybe dropping the sugar a little to like 3/4 cup. I'm definitely bummed!

This was really quite good.  It appealed to me because it was very easy to make it gluten free.  I actually made it with Almond Milk and Gluten Free Flour, it looked lovely, I would add just a touch of cinnamon next time.  I did sprinkle a few Butter Toffee Glazed Almond Accent Almonds on top, this really added to its appearance.  I served it to company first time round which I normally would never do but Id just picked the pears off my tree and wanted to use them.

I made this pie because I had pears about to go bad and I didn't want to waste them. I modified the recipe to be gluten free and added a little cinnamon. Just before I popped it in the oven I sprinkled some raw sugar crystals on top and they made it brown and taste like creme brule. WOW--so good. Why have I never made a pear pie before? I will make it again.

This pie was easy & impressive! Couple things I changed: Cut the sugar to a heaping 1/2 cup (I used a Splenda mix), and use 1 teaspoon vanilla, and a teaspoon almond extract, since I had it on hand. It was perfect! I also sliced the pears instead of halving them and topped the whole thing with cinnamon to make it even more repertoire!

Very very good pie! I did change the butter/sugar amount because a whole cup of sugar would have been much too sweet. I only put in 1/3 cup sugar & 1/3 cup butter. I also sliced the pears & added blueberries & some cinnamon. Then I sprinkled the top of the pie with some sugar before baking. It was so good! You can really taste the fruit & the custard is really light and delicious. I will definitely be making this again and again! I'm sure you can add a number of fresh fruits to make it different each time. Very good with those minor changes

Yum! I made it dairy-free by replacing the butter with margarine and I used more pears than it said. It was delicious, and something different from your standard fruit pie.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did the custard exactly as stated and peeled, halved, and cored 2 pears.  The only thing I adjusted was after I put the pear halves into the pie crust, I peeled a 3rd pear.  I used half, chopped up, to fill in the missing areas of the pie and then added the custard.  I used the other half of the extra pear to add slices to the top.  The pie was delicious.  I used the d'anjou pears and will be making another 2 pies before the end of the weekend.

Best Pie Ever!!! I had never heard of a pear pie, but needed something for a fun girls night with all the ingredients in my fridge.  I had 4 pears so I made an extra for my dad, who LOVES pies, and it was a smash with him and a HUGE hit with my girlfriends! Thanks for sharing! I wouldn't change a bit in this recipie, again best pie ever! I've already been asked to make it again for 2 different events :)

WOW!  I had never heard of pear pie, but had a bunch of pears that needed to be used.  I figured if such a thing existed, allrecipes would have it.  This recipe is great!  I made it exactly as the recipe says, using the "French Pastry Pie Crust" from this website.  I'll be making more of these for tomorrow's church potluck!

Wonderful. Following other reviews, I increased the butter and pears. I had bosc pears, so sliced them thin, used 5 to make 3 spiral layers. The pears kept their shape nicely. Also added 1 tsp. Pampered chef's Cinnamon Plus spice blend (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange peel). I think next time I will try putting the filling on the bottom, then the pears (has anyone tried that?) - the filling covered all my pretty layers. My 6 yr old boy loved it.

I made this pie a few days ago; I think the name of this recipe should be changed from "pear pie" to "pear custard." It was really delicious and really simple.  I didn't see a need to peel the pears, so I didnt'; I just sliced them.  Also, when making the custard, I added a small sprinkle of cinnamon and I reduced the amount of vanilla extract to a dash.  Overall, it was really delicious!!!

Made this with fresh pears that I sliced, instead of halving as the recipe suggests, and it worked great. I used three pears, instead of the two in the recipe, and loved how the pie turned out. Delicious recipe!

i made this pie twice. Once as written and once with the following changes which i thought made it a five star pie. I used six small pears which i soaked in a couple tablespoons of brandy and sprinkled with cinnamon. As others did, i used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup sugar. Upped the eggs to 3 and then i topped the pie with a crumb topping prior to baking using 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 teas. cinnamon.(might have been slightly too much topping) Love the custard in this pie.

Really good.  Made it this evening and everyone enjoyed it.  But I did double the amount of pears.  And after reading the reviews I followed some of them by drizzling the pears with lemon juice and adding a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon before adding them to the pie.  My pie did need 55 minutes to cook perfectly.  Great recipe.

Great and EASY recipe. I let the pears rest in some rum, cinnamon, and nutmeg while I was preparing everything else. Only needed like 30 minutes to cook though, so keep your eye on it.

Wonderful pie, I added some rasins, cinnamon and slivered almonds to the pie and used a butter pie crust, it was a big hit with friends.

This is my new favorite pie! I have made this a half a dozen times and everyone who tries it want the recipe. I did spinkle allspice on the pears and added a tsp. cinnamon to the custard. Thank you for the great recipe!

I swayed and tried this recipe following some helpful hints with cinnamon and added sliced apples to one side. Next time will have to just make separate as both were hits!

This is just divine!! Brilliant flavour :o) I had to use slightly more of everything as I made it in a deep pie dish so it ended up being 3 huge pears and double the custard mixture, I took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled the pie with nutmeg and brown sugar before it went into the oven and it came out perfect! My husband and I have eaten half of this on our own in one sitting - I'm guessing the rest wont last much longer either :o)

I Love this recipe, the only difference was i took the sugar down to 1/2 cup and added half cup brown sugar. Also used can pears, one 15 once can drained.  Best pie i have had in a long time, will recommend it to others.

This is a fantastic recipe, and rather easy to make.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and "marinated" the pear slices in lemon juice while I prepared everything else, then sprinkled a little cinnamon on the top before putting it in the oven.  People at work raved about it!

I did it once exactly how the recipe reads.  It was good - we just didn't like the halfed pears.  So, I do some adjusting - all measurements were the same except that I pealed and chopped 3 pears (I used a sand pear) and spread the chuncked pears in my pie plate and poured the mixture over the pears.  It was delicious.  Adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream is great!

I thought this was delicious. The only changes that I made was to replace the sour cream with butter, since I had no butter. It still turned out quite well I just mixed the sour cream in with the sugar and vanilla and then added the eggs one at a time. Additionally, I used around five pears. I used a basic shortening recipe from Ken Haedrich's book PIE. 
The flaky crust was perfect with the sweetness of the pie.

This was really tasty!  It had thin meringue crust on top that was a perfect complement to the pears.  I added 2/3 cup of sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Really good pie, but a bit sweet. Well prob cut out 1/3 sugar next time. I also sliced the pears into 8ths so the slices small and really tender, laid then on their side in a star pattern starting in the middle and working outwards. Made a very pretty pattern.

Our favorite go to pear pie.  Love the creamy custard.  We have a Bartlett pear tree so I was looking for a recipe to use the pears and came across this one probably about 8 years ago and it is still one of our favorites.  I always add a little love (cinnamon) to the recipe for the taste of fall.

Bomb, better than apple pie... I sprinkled it with powdered sugar once done & on the plate to be served, I also added a splash of butter milk & used half raw organic sugar & half dark brown sugar instead of the recommended cup of white sugar...

I've been meaning to rate this for years and just made the time to do  it. I love this pie. It's so easy to make and comes out great every time. I prefer to use fresh pears, but canned work just as well.  Thank you, PMKLINGBEIL's mother!

This pie wowed.  I added cinnamon over top the pears and then poured the custard on top.

You definitely need 5-6 pears.  and require the 50-60 minutes to cook but be careful to cover the last 15 minutes as the custard browns quickly.

Really amazing pie. It hit the spot for my cravings of creamy fruity dessert pie. The only change I did was to slice the pears instead of just halves. This will make sure we get better ratios of the creamy pie filling and pear. Took this pie to a family event and everyone loved it (I didnt tell them I baked it to get correct reviews). I have made this pie a couple of times now.

This was better than expected. I used 5 smaller pears, they were barely ripe. I cut them in half (cored them) and then sliced them thinly and placed them face down on the pie crust in a fan shape. For the custard, I only used half cup sugar and 1/4 cup MELTED butter which worked perfectly, I did add about a half tsp salt because the butter I used was unsalted. I also added several shakes of cinnamon to the batter along with about a tsp vanilla. Once the batter was poured on top of the pears, I sprinkled additional cinnamon along with a few shakes nutmeg and a handful brown sugar sprinkled on top.  Baked it 350 for a half hour then turned it down to 325 for an additional half hour. The pears (Bartlett) were tender and cooked. Very nice with ice cream or without.

Amazing pear pie. Works well with different pears, and I would recommend using more than 3

eeeh, this wasn't my favorite. I had fresh picked pears so I boiled them to soften. My husband thought it was good, but I'll never make it again.

This was very good.  I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup though and used 3 pears. It took about an hour and 20 minutes to bake.  I'll definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written.  The instructions were complete and understandable.  The pie tastes good, but not something to rave about.  The only thing I will do differently the next time I make this pie is to cover the edges of the crust with foil to keep it from getting too brown.

Excellent recipe! I used more pears because I was trying to use up what I had and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar because I love cinnamon, but I think the recipe would have been fine either way. I don't typically rate recipes but I figured I should since I'm logged in here to bake this pie for the third time in 2 months!

I really liked this pie but my family was just "eh" about it.  I thought the pear was an unexpected but welcome taste in my mouth.  My husband said, "I'd rather have peach pie" and my daughter said she'd rather have apple.  I could definitely see changing just the fruit and using the same recipe (I used 6 pears and could have used more, and changed the butter and sugar to 1/3C ea as suggested by another reviewer, and also added cinnamon.)

made in small ramekins.  Recipe as written.  Something was...off. Need to try with fresh pie crust.  No frozen berries.  Would be good with almond extract instead of vanilla.  Put baking sheet under pie plates since these overflow and run out.  Used soft pears.  Could use canned.  Or apples.

This surprised me--quite good, and worth adding to the rotation.

I hate being one of those people who rewrite a recipe, then rate it.  Alas, here I go. I had four overripe Bartlett pears to use up, so they all went in (tossed in a little lemon juice to prevent browning).  I used a Pillsbury pie crust (not my fave, but a timesaver) and I did increase the custard mixture by adding an egg and increasing butter to 1/2 cup; also added some cinnamon.  I think it would've been fine without the extra butter, but I'll have to experiment to find out.  This is a great use of pantry items when there are pears about to get thrown out (you know, that Costco box that never seems to get eaten fast enough).

Used 5 pears instead of two, added a shy teaspoon of cinnamon, added 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Also increased butter to 1/3 cup and lowered sugar to 1/3 cup.

I use four to five pears in this recipe and fan them out. I get requests for this pear pie now. Everybody, even the kids, love it! I also use a tart pan and add a touch of almond extract.

I found this pie a little too bland.  I used pear and honeycrisp apple, that was my only variation.  Its also a bit runny, I let it cool but maybe I didn't wait until it was completely cold.

Made according to directions, except for fitting gaps with another pear. Really delicious. Maybe a little sweet--but the pears and the crust help that. A big hit--and a great way to use up the pears I bought for after Christmas dinner (that nobody ate).

Discovered after my pears were peeled and ready to go that I had no vanilla left, so I used cinnamon instead. Came out delicious. Used 4 large pears, which I sliced like the current photo shows. Will make again!

I baked this, as written, with the exception of one of the eggs having an extra yolk.  The flavor was delicious, especially right out of the oven.  However, the custard didn't properly set.  I baked it for 50 minutes, since the top began to get dark.  I would definitely try this one again.

I have only tried this recipe this once and I changed it so much I'm not sure how to rate the original. I am infamous for not following directions. I do although love to get a starting point from searching recipes. I used this recipe only I used 6 overripe pears and I peeled and sliced them. I used the directions for the cream only I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2t nutmeg. I then threw in a handful of pecans and a handful of craisins. It was really good. So good it led me to want to try the filling in a crisp recipe!!!

I first made this pie last year, but with just two pears just didn't seem enough so I added more. Curving the pears around one another in a spiral and all around maybe about 5-6 pears sliced like so.  
So delicious....that's the only thing I did.  Now everyone wants a pear pie and this pear pie recipe.

I have made this recipe many times using several different fruits such as apples, berries and one time pitted cherries. It's  always a hit! I used one teaspoon of vanilla instead of the one tablespoon as called for in the recipe.
I also use a shortbread crust recipe for the crust.

Loved the pie and so easy to make. The only things I did different was use 3/4  cup sugar, half white, half brown and I used almond extract instead of vanilla. Next time I'll put in at least one more pear for 2 did not quite fill the pie shell....Emida

This pie was just ok. I used 3 small pears and cut them up into pieces-two were over ripe and a little soft and one was less ripe and harder. The recipe needs more pears and they really need to be overripe since you end up with a lot of crust and not much liquid filling to soften them up. Also, it needs a little more butter and definitely some cinnamon sprinkled on the pears and on the top as well.

Loved it! Second time around I used all changes that were in the reviews submitted. Mainly, used more pears and changed to brown sugar. Also, went to 1/3 cup butter. On a lark, spooned in three tablespoons of pear brandy before adding the filling. To die for!

Pears were on sale @ the store, so i was looking for a recipe to use them up.  This one is a winner, and will be added to my recipe box at home.  I did slice the pears into slices, used only 1/2 a cup of white sugar, and added nutmeg and cinnamom.  I wanted to take a picute of it, but it was already half gone by that time!

Everyone loved this pie. I used very ripe pears and a sugar substitute. I also added cinnamon to the egg mixture. I will make this again.

So yummy! I added a couple of drops of almond extract and added frozen raspberries in with the pears. Also used the basic flaky pie crust recipe and made the crust from scratch. Turned out delicious!

Absolutely amazing! The only thing I did differently was rude 1/3 of the sugar because the pears are already very ripe and sweet. This recipe and totally changed the way I think about baking pears.

Great starting point.   I took the advice of several reviewers and used 3 eggs and changed the sugar to 1/3 and the butter to 1/3 for a deep pie pan.   Other recommendations:use soft Bartlett pears. I've made it with other pears and it doesn't work near as well.   Also, before serving, refrigerate it. We had it at room temperature it was okay but once it was cooled, it was delicious.

The recipe is quick, easy, and delicious. I used canned pears from our pear tree I canned this past summer and that was easy. Also I added a packet of maple brown sugar oatmeal (quaker). This gave it a little more depth, and then I sprinkled cinnamon on the top.

Made this pie yesterday. I had some ripe pears to use up and wanted something a litle different. It was awsome! The only things I did different was to add some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to the filling mixture, then sprinkled a little more cinnamon and chopped pecans on top. Propabaly this best pear pie I've ever had and soooo easy. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will definately make again!

Exquisite. I used 1/2 cup of sugar because the pears I used were very ripe. Mixed a very large teaspoon of cinnamon into the custard. I also used about 4 pears in the pie! Love my fruit.

Made this for Thanksgiving and I did like it but found it a bit bland. That's pears for you though. I even added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg but it still needed something. What really made it better is I made some caramel sauce and whipped cream to serve with it.

I am in the middle of baking this pie right now, and I am not so happy with it erupting all over my cookie sheet right now.  The 4 ripe pears are so juicey they have been flowing up the sides of the crust and over the crust edge taking off these edges, along with some of the custard filling, on the way to the cookie sheet.   I bumped up the pears to 4 and made sure they were ripe per suggestions, I went with 3 eggs & 1/3 cup sugar & butter like suggested, I tossed the pears in some nutmeg and all spice as suggested, and I even topped it off with a struesal topping trying to give it a little something extra on my part..  I am not even sure how edible this will be when whatever is left in the pie crust is done baking, and if I want to bring it for Thanksgiving tomorrow to share with the family.  I am hovering on the disappointed side right now.  I guess I will know more in a few minutes when it's ready to pull out of the oven to cool.  So, I am not sure how anyone fit 6 pears sliced up and the custard into a deep dish pie crust.  The house smells great, but the mess in my oven is not very appealing so I am only giving it 2 stars after my attempt at this pie.

This recipe was fantastic.  I used 5 pears, reduced the sugar, added a 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract and sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of sliced almonds on the top before baking.  Everyone enjoyed it.  My parents raved about it and wouldn't let me take the leftovers home with me!

This was an amazing pie.  Subtle.  I used an extra pear the second time and it came out even better.  I also put aluminum foil around the edges of the pie for the first half of the baking.  Came out perfect!  This will become one of my yearly holiday pies.

This was a little too sweet when I made it the first time.  I liked the general idea though, and the next time I tried it I reduced the sugar, and instead of pears put mixed berries in the pie crust, including blueberries, raspberries, and quartered strawberries. It came out absolutely delicious.

I like this pie, but I find it a bit sweet, so next time I'll use less sugar.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I love the pears in this pie, but no surprise:  I love pears anyway!  Very easy to do, and I didn't have enough crust to cover the pan, so I just did a bottom crust and sprayed the rest of the pan.  Worked out just as well.  thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I sliced up 4 very ripe Bartlett pears & used 1/2 the amount of sugar.  My husband & I ate half of this pie the first night! The custard with the delicate pears was a beautiful combination. I will make this anytime I have a few ripe pears that need to be used up.

I used ripe pears and sliced them thin (instead of halves), but felt that the pears were still too firm in the end. And I'd agree with another reviewer that 1 Tbsp was too much vanilla. I should have covered it somehow to prevent overbrowning.  Maybe baking this 40 mins then turning oven off and leaving pie in for 1/2 hour to "set" would have been better.  My husband did like the taste of the "custard" and one of my daughters devoured 2 pieces.

My husband loved this recipe, but I couldn't eat it (the texture of the pears once they are cooked is WAY too mushy for me).

I loved this pie! We needed to get rid of some overripe pears and only had 1 egg left but it was still great. I have more pears left so I might make another one tonight.

very delicious taste, but a little too much liquid in my pie. I used canned pears, so i could use as much as the pie could hold, and i drained them -the canned pears held up nicely. I would definitely make this again

This is good, but not amazing. I got a merang like crust on mine as well. I had placed a few pear slices on top of the pie before baking to make it look pretty and they sank into the custard and looked odd, so I recommend against trying that.

This was a good pie.  I wish it had tasted a little more peary but it was definitely good.  I made it with frozen pears which made me worry about making the pie runny but it didn't.  I think next time I will use very, very ripe pears and that might make a difference in increasing the pear taste.  Overall, a good, using another fruit other than apple pie.
