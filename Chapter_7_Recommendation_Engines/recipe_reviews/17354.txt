Wonderful, creamy coconut cake.  Just one tip to sort out the Coconut CREAM/ Coconut MILK enigma. Some people here use these terms interchangeably.   Look at the ingredients on the can, and if you see sugar FIRST, and then coconut milk (plus some other fillers) then DO NOT add the condensed milk.  Just use it straight up. If you're can has the ingredients listed as: coconut milk, water, etc (but no sugar), then DO use the condensed milk to sweeten it, but even then try half a can of condensed milk first and keep tasting it until it is to your desired level of sweet.  Then proceed to drizzle this over your warm cake as per the recipe.  I bought  both, I found coconut milk in the sauce aisle at the grocery store, it was just coconut milk and water.  I also bought coconut cream in the alcoholic drink section, and it was already sweetened.  I'm glad I bought both, I warmed them both up separately, and the coconut MILK sweetened with 1/2 can of condensed milk, kept the true tasted of sweet and coconut.  The sweet coconut CREAM is way too sweet (because it's manufactured mainly for pina coladas and needs to offset the alcohol and pineapple juice...)  So, all this to help one soul from making the mistake of adding sweet condensed milk to already overkill sweet coconut cream.  Also, whip your cream with just a hint of sugar, don't try to make it sweet, sweet cream.  The cake will be very sweet as is, and you can make or break it with the whipped cream.  Happy baking!!!

This is such an easy cake, but so good that people will think you have some God-given baking talent. I didn't have any coconut extract and it wasn't missed one bit. I made this for my father-in-law's 80th birthday and it went over so well that within a day I got emails asking for the recipe! My mom and sister have  Crohn's disease that prevents them from having too much roughage in their diets; flaked coconut bothers both of them, as it does many people. You can skip the flaked coconut on top and not miss the coconut flavor at all. YOU SHOULD FOLLOW other reviewers' suggestions and let this cake cool to room temp on the counter after you pour the coconut cream mixture over it, before chilling. If you put the cake in the fridge to cool, it will get soggy. REMEMBER ALSO not to let holes poke all the way through to the bottom of the cake or you'll get a  little puddle of coconut cream on the bottom, which means it didn't absorb into your cake and won't be as moist as you want. Bigger holes work better, so find something as big as a chopstick if you don't have one handy. I used unsweetened coconut cream and just half a can of sweetened condensed milk and it was plenty sweet. I frosted the cake with the Cool Whipped Frosting recipe on this site that has a billion good reviews, and that worked very well. Nice and light tasting. This was such a fantastic cake and so easy to make. Don't miss this one!

The flavors really come out in this cake after 2 days and it continues to get better. I agree with another reviewer this is a bit like a tres leche cake. I added coconut extract to the whip cream and toasted the coconut. It is just wonderful but make 2 days ahead for best results. Coconut cream is used in mixed drinks and will be found in the liquor section of your grocery store.

Just to clear up the confusion on the coconut cream vs. cream of coconut- Coconut cream is NOT sweet, it is called COCONUT CREAM, NOT cream of coconut. This product mixed with sweetened condensed milk is perfect and not too thick OR too sweet. IF you bought cream of coconut instead and mixed it with sweetened condensed milk it would be very sweet and very thick and probably ruin this cake. Coco Lopez and the brands found in the mixed drink section are incorrect for this recipe. Most stores carry all 3 kinds of canned cocnut product; coconut cream, coconut milk, and cream of coconut. The coconut cream is usually located in the Thai/Asian food section with the coconut milk. I did not use quite all of my cream mixture but I used most of it. I also drained some of the excess from the bottom of the pan out before it soaked it all up. Other than this I think the recipe is perfect as is, as long as you know the difference between the coconut products.

Instead of using the oil and eggs as indicated on the recipe, I just followed the instructions on the white cake mix box.

Also, I've made this 3 times each time splitting the recipe into half cupcakes and half into a cake.  It is much tastier as cupcakes and everyone at my work agrees.  Just be careful not to poke the hole all the way down to the bottom of the cupcake so the cream stays inside the center.

Each time I ended up using only half of the cream mixture.

Nice and coconutty! All I could find at my store was Coco Real brand cream of coconut (in the "mixers" section for pina coladas). I don't know if that's the correct ingredient, but it worked. I'd suggest not refrigerating the cake until it most of the condensed milk mixture has a chance to soak in before chilling stiffens the mixture up and slows absorbtion. I used the specified quantity of condensed milk/coconut cream and my cake was moist, not wet, and not too sweet at all. Instead of plain whipped cream, I topped mine with "Easy Whipped Cream" from this site, which is half whipping cream half sour cream. I didn't toast the coconut as some suggested because I prefer the softness of it when it is untoasted.

One word - sensational!!!

I toasted the coconut as suggested by others - just put it in a tray in the warm oven (turned off) after I had taken the cake out.

I did make a day earlier than needed (as suggested by others) and it was fantastic.  I made in 2 cakes rather than one and put the cream and coconut between the cakes as well as on top.  It looked professional and cream and all it was still perfect to serve at my party the next day.

This is a keeper.  Only problem was when one of my guests kept asking where I bought it becase she couldnt believe it was home made it was so good.  Now that is what I call a high class problem to have!

Thanks for submitting

I made this cake for Father's Day and everybody loved it. It is a very moist cake. I personally  think that all the sauce should be added. It is the right amount of sauce. Once I added the sauce to the hot cake, I let it come to room temperature so it could absorb all the sauce that way. After it cooled completely that is when I refrigerated it. Thanks for a great recipe.

Sincerely,
Christina

Personally, I was a little disappointed after reading the rave reviews of this recipe. I thought the cake was way overly sweet and mushy. I've made similar cakes that incorporate pouring a warm sauce over the cake after baking, but I've been happier with other recipes.

Yum!

I have been calling this Coconut Dos Leches Cakes because that's pretty much what it is. Best served cold. Even those who said they do not care for coconut enjoyed this recipe. I cut some of the cake of the top off to make room for the whipped cream (and the lid). I used all the sauce with no problem. I was worried about the big holes the chopcticks made in the cake, but you couldn't see the holes in the servings. The cake held together well, no mush, easy to serve. This one will stay in my personal collection.

I have made this cake about twenty times because everyone I know wants this specific cake for every occasion that comes up.  Half of these occasions have been for teachers at my children's school.  I always use Dunkin Hines Brand cake mix, Coco Lopez cream of coconut milk, Eagle Brand sweetened, condensed milk, Promised Land whipping cream and Angel Flake shredded coconut.  I have tried cheaper versions of each of these items and am usually disappointed.  I also substitute melted butter for the oil.  Make sure after you have poured the milk mixture over the cake that you allow the cake to cool completely before you put it in the refrigerator otherwise the mixture will pool in the bottom of the pan instead of being absorbed by the cake.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I made this for a birthday.  Even people who weren't crazy about coconut loved it.  Since the cake mix and the coconut cream already had plenty of sugar, I omitted the sweetened condensed milk.  The cake was perfect without the milk.  Made it with the cool whipped frosting recipe from this site.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday because my grandmother used to make coconut cakes every Christmas and I wanted to make something special that reminded him of her.  Although I don't think this was like hers it was still really good.  I made my cake from scratch since I prefer them over boxed mixes.  I also reserved about a cup of the coconut cream mixture and added it to 1 cup of heavy cream and whipped it to make my frosting.  I baked it in two 8" round pans and layered it.  I poured the coconut cream over the layers and let them set overnight before assembling the cake the next day.  The finished cake was not only beautiful but very moist and flavorful.  Everyone loved it, even those who don't like coconut.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic flavor! It’s the kind of cake that’s excellent with black coffee in the morning. IMPORTANT TIP:  Definitely do as others suggest and add coconut extract to both the frosting and cake. Too much coconut flavor is never enough! Also, let it sit for 1-2 days before adding frosting. This cake needs a lot of time to absorb the sauce and become flavorful. My tip to add is to over whip the batter on purpose for it to contain air bubbles and create holes in it naturally. Then after poking holes in it, not one cranny of the cake didn’t absorb the sauce. What a wonderful cake! yum

I made this for a birthday party and it was a hit.  EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I had a hard time finding the cream of coconut--finally found it in the ethnic food section under both Asian and Mexican foods.  I was told you can also find it in the liquor section by the pina colada stuff.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

I've made this recipe for nearly 30 yrs.  My mother-in-law gave it to me shortly after I was married, and the first time I tasted it I was in love!  I have changed the way I make it now though.  While I used to pour the entire liquid mixture of sweetened condensed milk and cream of coconut over the cake, now I only use HALF of this mixture, and I freeze the other half for the next cake.  It freezes VERY well!  I've found the cake is a little lighter this way, and just as delicious.

My family loves this cake.  It reminds us a little of my grandmother's coconut layer cake AND our favorite Mexican Food Restaurant's Tres Leches Cake rolled into one.  Definitely 5-star worthy.

This is an awesome little piece of heaven! I couldn't find cream of coconut where I live (didn't realize I should have gone to the liquor store first) so the only thing I changed was mixing in 1/2 can (14 oz.) of coconut milk in with the sweetened condensed milk and it turned out fantastic. I will be trying it with the c.o.c. when I find it, but for now, this recipe is a definite winner with the minor substitute.

This cake is phenomenal.  I made it for my mom's 70th birthday party, and I honestly couldn't believe how easy it was.  I set aside about 7 hours to make 2 elaborate cakes, and started with this one.  When I got into making it, I couldn't believe that it involved only a couple of simple steps-and half the time that I imagined!  But this cake almost didn't happen:

     I was so excited when I first read the reviews and decided to use this recipe.  It wasn't until making my shopping list, that I noticed that it was made from a box cake.  I came very close to scrapping this recipe.  I needed a made-from-scratch-show-stopper for this important occasion, one that presented as well as it tasted.  It was the reviews that swayed me back to trying it...and boy am I glad I did.  Coconut lovers adored it, mild coconut eaters asked for seconds, and everyone who took a bite raved about it.  I agree that it has the consistency of a tres leches cake.  I also agreee that it should be made a day in advance, so the glaze flavors have adequate time to be absorbed into the cake, and set.  In my opinion, it is best served cold.

     I made the cake exactly as per the recipe, down the the coconut cream/evaporated milk combo.  While the sweetness suited me just fine, someone with a lessor sweet tooth might want to use the coconut milk/evaporated milk combo that someone mentioned in their review earlier.  However, like I said, too many people wanted the recipe for me to change one thing!

VERY good cake, but VERY VERY sweet.  After someone told me their teeth actually hurt from the intense sugar, I decided to make just a couple of modifications that really make a difference. First, I replaced the water with coconut milk and I reduced the sweet condensed milk by 2/3.  The cake is still plenty sweet, just not so intense.  The reduction in condensed milk also eliminates sogginess, a problem many reviewers noted.  Second, rather than poke holes in the cake to pour the glaze into, I slice the cake into two layers after it's cooled a bit. Then, I spread 1/2 of the glaze between the layers, sprinkle some coconut, and reassemble. I top the cake with the remaining glaze and add whipped cream on top.

I made this cake and served it today for our Easter dessert.  It was really very good and my Mother just raved about it.  I do want to add that I could not find COCONUT CREAM at our grocery store but I did find CREAM OF COCONUT.  These are not the same thing.  I wasn't sure what the difference was but then discovered that the Cream of Coconut is already sweetened.  I looked online and did find coconut cream and from what I can gather it's of a thicker consistency and would need the sweetened condensed milk to thin it out.  I made my cake and had decided that I would taste the Cream of Coconut before putting it on the cake which is what I did.  It was plenty sweet so I did not add any sweetened condensed milk.  The brand I bought was made by Goya.  It soaked into the holes just fine.  I added just a splash of coconut extract to the whipped cream and I did also add the tablespoon of sugar.  I also toasted some of the coconut topping.  None of us found this cake too sweet nor was it soggy.  It was wonderfully moist and flavored.  I think my my Mother's exact words were, "Oh my, I think I've died and gone to heaven".   I will definitely be making this one again and again.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it!  Coconut milk works great for this recipe as well if you can't get the coconut cream.

Wow, is this cake simply amazing!!  I am a big baker and send alot of my baked goods with my husband to work.  He told me that his co workers said that this cake trumped everything else I ever sent in!!!!!!   I also used all the liquid and did not think the cake was too mushy; quite the opposite........it is moist and delicately coconut flavored. I poured the milk/coconut mixture on the cake when it was warm and I let it sit on my counter until all the liquid was absorbed before I refrigerated.  I did change the topping though; I used the Cool Whip frosting recipe that is on this website.  Just fantastic!!!!!!!  I highy recommend you try this cake.

Absolutely phenomenal! I took another's advice and only used the coconut creme and cut out the sweetened condensed milk. This cake is to die for!

Great Recipe very delicious, wouldn't pour the whole recipe of cream on cake...I'll use 1/2 next time, cream makes it too wet...Also make sure you take cake out of pan before pouring cream.if you don't will have problem with cake sticking to the pan..if you are making cake and it will be outside in a warm climent it's best to add a packet of gelatin to your cool whip frosting makes it thicker and won't melt as fast.

This is fantastic! This is one of my absolute favorites! After making this for everybody, I'm editing my comments to tell my easy way to fill the holes. I mix both milks in my 4 cup glass measuring cup. Then I fill a plastic squeeze bottle, that I  cut the nozzle down to make the opening larger. There's a lot of coconut mixture but I used it all. It's ok if it doesn't all make it inside the holes and some of it sits on top of the cake. I left my cakes right in the pans and after they cooled a bit, I covered the pans with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge. To be sure it sets up nice and firm, chill it overnight. The next morning I made Cool-Whip Frosting from this site. Instead of vanilla pudding I used cheesecake pudding. The vanilla is sort of yellowish and the cheesecake pudding is whiter, so it made for a prettier cake. I also add a bit of coconut extract to the frosting. The frosting does holds up better than plain whipped cream or cool-whip. Cover the top and sides with a little or a lot of coconut. The cake sat in the fridge for several more hours before serving. It was so beautiful and impressive looking  my company loved it. Because it's so rich I will save it for very special occasions. I love when I find a recipe that actually improves after it sits overnight, making it easier on yourself when you have a lot of  special cooking to do.Thanks for a great recipe!

I, too, added more coconut extract than called for and am glad I did. Additionally, I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut since I couldn't find the latter in my grocery store - cake turned out just fine! A suggestion for final presentation: adding pineapple chunks around the cake (and a few on top) ended up being a really well-received idea. The pineapple mixed REALLY well with the coconut flavor. I also suggest baking this in two round pans and then layering (just make sure you make twice as much whip cream so that you have enough for putting in between layers).

This was VERY good. My son said he liked the "sticky stuff in the middle" the best.

Hint!  I wanted mine to look like the picture so I did it in 2 round pans.  If you want to do it this way, I would highly suggest you put the first cake on your serving plate first, poke holes with a knife (giving a small twist to make a larger hole) and then put on the second layer doing the same thing.  I didn't and the weight of the cake combined with the liquid made it extremely difficult to pick up to put onto my plate.  I also iced it as the picture and covered with a combination of white and toasted coconut.  VERY good!  I now see why the recipe called fro the 9x13 cake pan though.  Still like the looks of the layer cake though and would do it again this way by the means I suggested.  Lorrie

This is the best thing I have ever eaten...my family LOVED it.  I followed the directions exactly.  After pouring the evap. milk/coconut cream mixture over the hot cake, I did cool the cake  comletely before putting it in the fridge.  It was totally absorbed into the cake.  Do make it at least a day ahead and please don't even think of putting cool whip on the cake, that would be such a sin.  Make fresh whipped cream-- you will not be sorry.

This cake rocks!!!!!!

This was fantastic! I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  I also used the cram of coconut not coconut milk.  Combined with the condensed milk it made a very thick syrup and was a little difficult to pour over the cupcakes.  I'm sure it would be easier and less messy if I'd make a cake instead.  The only change I made was to add about a teaspoon of coconut extract to the whipped cream icing.  I also used a combination of toasted and untoasted coconut for the topping.  They are wonderfully light and refreshing.  This is a definite keeper!!

This may be the best coconut cake I have ever had. Rave rewiews every time I make it. I usually a little coconut extract to the cake. For the frosting I mix one box of instant vanilla pudding with 2 cups of whipped cream and 1/2 tsp coconut extract. Then add milk a little at a time to get it the right consistancy for spreading. Delicious

Yummy! This was great! I made it for Easter and everyone loved it, even my sister who doesn't like cake had a 2nd piece. I made a round layer cake and was worried about transfering the cakes after they soaked up the milk mixture, but I didn't have any problems. I coated mine in toasted coconut.

I used to make this cake quite often. I never used sweetened condensed milk with it though. I just poked the holes in the cake and poured on the cream of coconut. It was just right. I think using the sweetened cond. milk would make it way too sweet. Everything else was pretty much the same though.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving.  It went together easily.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I toasted the coconut before I sprinkled it on the top. It made for a beautiful presentation.  I however, am not a big fan of sweetened condensed milk. The next time I make this cake, I think I will microwave the cream of coconut until it is runny and pour it over the hot cake without using the sweetened condensed milk.

This is absolutely the best coconut cream cake I have ever had. I made it for a family gathering and one of my cousins literally picked up the cake and hid it so that no one else could have any more!!!  I have had so many requests to make it. Delicious!!

This cake did not come out like I thought it would. The sweet condensed was way to much sugar that is mainly what I could taste. The coconut was not enough it tasted like white cake even after letting it sit over night in the fridge. I will not make this cake again.

This cake is wonderful! I used half in half instead of the sweetened condensed milk. It would be too sweet otherwise. I also doubled the whipping cream. It is great!!!

I have made this recipe for 5 consecutive Easter Sunday's! I do tweek it each time to my own liking when it comes to the amount of cream. COCONUT CREAM is the only thing that works in my opinion for this recipe, I do play around with the sweetness myself. I add vanilla extract and lime zest to the heavy cream. Line the cake with lime slices, I've even shaved some chocolate to sprinkle on top. To me this cake is an overnight serve, I always cream the cake ahead, refridgerate over night and frost just before dinner. It never fails to be the talk of Easter. The cake is amazing as a layered cake, DO NOT POKE HOLES ALL THE WAY! I use a kebab stick and run it half way through each cake. Then, just add some coconut and topping in the middle. Viola! hands down the best coconut cream cake recipe EVER! When you have 20 to 30 school moms begging for this you realize what a gem you have in a recipe. Clip, Print or save it to your phone. YOU WONT BE SORRY!

I made this on Easter and it was wonderful. The reviewer that gave the tip to eliminate the sweetend condensed milk if  the coconut cream had sugar in the mix was spot on. If you like coconut, this is a very good recipe.

Followed the recipe almost exactly...except i forgot to put the coconut extract in the batter.  So, i just put it in the whipping cream instead.  Not overwhelming.  Definitely let the cream work it's way throughout the cake and let cool at room temperature before placing in the fridge overnight.  Then, next day, place the whipping cream and decorate.  I did toast the coconut flakes lightly.  I find that it gives the cake some texture and a slight colour.  People absolutely loved it!

I used the coconut cream that is sweet so I did not use the sweetened condensed milk.  The cake was perfect!  Made the cool whip with pudding to frost it.  My family likes the coconut taste but not the shredded coconut so I just added a little more coconut extract.

Awesome! Made this for Easter. Gone instantly! Although one thing was not clear-could not find coconut cream so I got coconut milk instead (the kind you use for Thai food) and it worked just as well and just as creamy

This has become my new favorite cake! I've made it a few times now, and the only thing I did differently was toasting half of the shredded coconut, I think it makes the cake look nice, and by only doing half it makes it so it's not too crispy. This is always a hit whenever I serve it, and it's really easy to make. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Amazing! I have to be careful, I could easily polish this whole cake off on my own.. lol - the coconut flavour is not as strong as I'd thought it would be. You could easily add more coconut extract to the batter or even the icing. I might try a different whipped cream/icing recipe next time though - tastes great but I'd like something thicker for presentation

After reading many of the reviews, I made this cake and many of the tips were very helpful. I've never really cooked with coconut cream or milk before, so making sense out of all the different coconut comments was a little daunting. My store only sells the sweetened coconut cream for drinks and canned coconut milk. I felt that the recipe called for the unsweetened milk and opted to stay with the recipe. My store sold no unsweetened coconut cream product though, so that must just be a problem with my store. On my first attempt, I used the entire can of coconut milk and the sweetened condensed milk. I used the entire mixture and ruined my cake with too much moisture. It was really just a sticky mess. When you open a can of coconut milk, the top half is just a heavy cream, and the bottom is the liquid milk. On the second attempt I just used the cream out of the coconut milk can and the sweetened condensed milk. The cake came out perfect. The top was still a little stick of course, but once iced you cannot tell. The inside was perfectly moist. I hope this helps someone from making the same novice mistake I did. Good luck, this cake really is wonderful.

I have made this a couple of times now, and getting ready to do so again for a baby shower... while it is on the sweet side, it is a delicious accompaniment to a tropical themed dinner, easter, or any occasion (ours is a monkey baby shower cake)... definitely recommend!

This cake was very rich.  I wish I had read that others only used half the cream or omitted the sweetened condensed milk.  If I make it again, I will do that.  My cake ended up kind of soggy and way too sugar-y.

I used coconut milk and half a can of sweetened condensed milk (didn't have coconut cream) and it was nicely sweet. It really does need to sit in the pan for a couple of days though to really allow the cake to soak up all the liquid. I made it for my husbands birthday, everyone loved it and even ate the piece that fell on the floor!

Amazing cake!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My whole family loved it.  I used the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site and toasted the coconut flakes like suggested in other reviews.  I will be making this cake for years to come.

Very yummy and much easier than coconut cake recipes I have tried in the past.  I wanted to make cupcakes with the recipe and to avoid soaking the paper liners with the coconut milk mixture, I used a baster and injected each cupcake with about 1-2 T of it.  Much cleaner and just as yummy.  Will definitely make this again!

Made a crude version of this -yum! But It didn't have much oil in it, so it crumbled a little. I'd add a tad more: almost half a cup, stirred in well.

Yum!  I made the cake 2 days early and it turned out sooo great!  Like other said, I let it cool completely with the sauce before putting it into the fridge.  Then I left it in the fridge for 2 days before adding the whipped cream and coconut.  The flavor was so great and I while it's very sweet, it's what you expect from coconut cream cake.  Now a day later after icing the cake, it's even better.  I would suggest having the cake completely finished a day before serving it.  So good!

I prepared the cake for a group of friends. The response was great.  several wanted the recipe.  I had made another coconut cream cake using a slightly different recipe, and the cake became dry after the second day. my only suggestion is that if you are taking the cake to someones house make sure that they have room in the frig for it, as it does sort of melt if left at room temp very long

Yum, yum, yum. I made this as a thank you gift and the thank-ees loved it. My grandma even said it quiet possibly is better than her coconut cake. I frosted it with cool whipped frosting instead of the heavy cream recipe provided (used instant white chocolate pudding, cool whip, and mixed in the coconut flakes). I also sprinkled extra coconut on top. 

If you're making a layer cake and add the cream of coconut/sweetened condensed milk while the cakes are in the pans still be careful removing the layers. It's a supersticky (but delish) concoction and gave me a hard time getting the layers out in one piece.

This is my new fav. cake.:D

I bake a cake at least once a month for a birthday club I belong too. There wasn't a birthday for this month and I wanted to experiment with something new. When I saw this recipe and being a coconut lover I wanted to try it. I used all the sauce which I think made it so moist and yummy. Everyone loved it. It got rave reviews. It will be among one of several other choices from now on. Several asked for the recipe. Thank you.

I made this cake for a neighborhood BBQ and everyone loved it.  Even those that aren't huge coconut fan's would enjoy this cake.  Next time I won't use all of the sauce.  It was a little soggy.  Thanks!

Tried this coconut cake and it was delicious!  I only looked at the first two reviews and they were very helpful.  What I had to work around initially was the photo showed a layer cake and the recipe is for a 9x13.  Would like to know other opinions on which works better.  For Easter, I was preferring the layer look.  Much more elegant!  I used the coconut milk (unsweetened) and with almost the entire can of sweetened condensed milk.  The mixture was more runny than I expected.  Because I made the cake in two layers, I put the mixture in a measuring cup and drizzled over the layers, which I placed on a cutting board, side by side.  I was careful to not poke all the way through the layers, and any sauce that ended up on the board was due to it running down the layer and off.  I did not use it all, in total it made a little more than 2 cups and I think about 1/2 cup was leftover.  I did cool it before putting it in the fridge, like was suggested in the second review.  I recommend whipping up the frosting just before you serve it or that morning.  I did not have the time to do that so I had to frost the night before, the cake subsequently ran.  After a little patching the next day it was fine and was a big hit!

I am an amateur baker, so this recipe was not too good because I followed the directions to a tee.  I added all the coco cream/sweetened cond milk.  It just pooled around the edges.  After letting it set all night in the frig, the cake was mushy, wet and not good!  If I had more baking experience, I would have known not to add all the mixture.  I did add plenty of holes, too.  So there was plenty of holes for the milk mixture to run through.  I should only have used half of the mixture.

I have been searching for this cake!   As many others have said it is beyond delicious.  I served it for a BBQ party and will bake another for our 4th of July BBQ too.  I will add strawberries and blueberries to the top of the coconut to make a USA flag.

Just an added note....I poked holes in my sheet cake and used a small funnel to fill the holes with the coconut cream mixture.  Cake was moist not mushy.

This recipe rocks!  I omitted the sweetened condensed milk and it was plenty sweet.  It is moist and yummy.  I added a box of coconut pudding to the cake mix and used coconut pudding in the cool whip frosting from this site.  I am an accomplished baker and cook, as is my husband and he gave it two thumbs up also.

Awesome.  I did follow the other reviews to let the cake cool to room temp before pouring the cream/milk mixture over the top.  I also did not use the flaked coconut.  It's amazing.

Very easy and good. I did a butter cream frosting and it came out good. Although might have been a little too sweet. but I was worried about the whipping cream melting during the course of our BBQ. My other complaint is the picture shows a double layered cake and with soaking the cake in the coconut cream and condensed milk... I did do two nine inch rounds I only soaked for a couple of hours then removed them and placed them in the fridge over night. They didn't get too soggy this way.

The 2 stars is for the idea. I was so excited to try this cake but it was a HUGE letdown.  I love coconut in almost anything  so i thought this would be great.  However it ended up tasting just like box cake mix (ew).  The coconut flavor was totally lost. This tasted like a regular soggy box cake that was too sweet.  If I ever try this again I will definitely make the cake from scratch and use less sugar in the batter and less condensed milk.

Although I substitued Cool Whip in place of the homemade whipping cream, this has been a huge hit with my family and friends. It has been requested at several gatherings.

absolutely wonderful, for a little extra kick I added a tiny drop of coconut extract to the icing. The icing was a bit bland the first time, but the second time I made the cake I put a little extra in the icing and it was wonderful. Keep it refridgerated for the the best results and to keep it from turing into soup

Incredible, delicious cake! And other reviewers are right, it tastes even better after a couple of days in the fridge. I couldn't find cream of coconut, so I just used another can of sweetened condensed milk and mixed in 2 teaspoons of coconut extract. It worked perfectly. Frosted the cake with Coconut-Cream Cheese Frosting, from this site.

If you are not an experienced cooker than you should plan on attempting this cake one time before you serve it. I've done a couple of desserts from allrecipes and this one was one of my challenges that I definitley learned from! Everything is pretty much what its says. When you poke holes make sure you dont poke all the way through. Also if your cake is too small dont worry about useing all the cream you made. I was kind of slow to pick this up and my cake was drowned in the cream and it made it WAY too sweet and WAY to soggy. lol So just make sure you use an enough amount of cream to make the cake part moist and drowned. But this recipe Im pretty sure is amazing when done right. But my dad wont pay for the supplies again :-( even though it was only 10 bucks!

With all the glowing reviews, I made this cake...I wasn't too impress with the final result. It tasted ordinary. I also used 'cool whipped frosting' for the final touch. I suggest letting it sit at room temp for 1 to 2 days...I think refrigeration ruined the taste.

This cake tasted good. It was a little too wet inside.  The fresh whipped cream on top was a nice add.   This cake is very high in saturated fat!

I made this recipe for Easter and it was a major hit!  Very easy even for the novice baker.  A couple of notes gathered from other reviews that might be helpful:  You can use coconut milk instead of cream.  Coconut cream is found in the mixed drink aisle and coconut milk is found in ethnic foods aisle.  Make sure when you add the milk to the cake you don't poke holes all the way through the bottom or mixture will puddle.  Also make sure you cool the cake completely before sticking into the fridge.  The longer it sits the better.  Also - when making the whipped topping, use powdered sugar since regular sugar can be too grainy.  You can also add a tsp of coconut extract to the whipped topping which adds even more flavor.  Yum!  I also toasted the coconut to top the cake and it was pretty and adds a nice nutty flavor.  Excellent for bringing to a dinner - travels well.  A keeper!

I made this recipe for my family's Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I had to make some substitutions not being able to find the coconut cream . I used the sweetened condensed milk and added 2 tsps. cocount extract and that did the trick. Also I used coconut milk instead of regular milk in the cake batter that another reviewer suggested. I also toasted the coconut flakes on top of the cake and it was so much nicer and flavorful.
You must not poke holes all the way through as I did cuz I couldn't get the cake out of the pan and made a trifle instead with cubes of cake and was just as wonderful. I made this twice once using the whipped cream icing that goes with this recipe and the other time with the frozen whipped topping recipe from this site. The family agreed that the frozen whipped topping recipe was the best, so from now on I will use that one. I highly recommend this cake it was delicious.

Wow--this recipe reminds me of the coconut cake my mom made when I was young.  I made it for Christmas this year as a 2 layer cake, and even my "I don't eat dessert" claiming husband has had 2 pieces.  We decorated the top with a few maraschino cherries, and have a new family favorite!  Perfect just the way it is written.

Very good - just on the border of too sweet for my taste though.  Does remind one of a tres leches cake. Be sure to use the Cool Whipped Frosting and follow other reviewers advice of poking large holes and soaking the cake until room temperature then refrigerating.  We could only wait 7 hours to dig in and it was tasty.  Bet it will be GREAT tomorrow.  Oh and I made this in a bundt pan because I didn't want a soggy bottom.

I've made this cake quite a few times now. It is often requested and everyone just loves it. I substitute coconut milk for the regular milk, but other than that I make it as directed in the recipe. It is so easy and so tasty. People can't believe it's homemade. Also, for those intimidated by cake recipes other than simple box cakes... this is not time consuming or labor intensive. It's a great cake and well worth the effort. Enjoy!!

This was a hit! I changed it up a little. I used pineapple cake and cut back slightly on the coconut extract. What a combo. Everyone loved it.

OUTSTANDING!!  I did a yellow cake mix and added a box of coconut creme pudding to the mix.  Also added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  RAVE REVIEWS. Everyone thought there was some type of liquor in it.  That's how tasty it was.  Will defintely make again.  Used cream cheese frosting instead of cool whip and topped with coconut..

This was really easy and delicious. Our local store did not carry coconut cream so I used coconut milk instead. It still turned out perfect. I also like more whipped topping so I doubled the batch. It was a big hit. I will be making this again and again.

I used this recipe to inspire me.  I used Duncan Hines yellow cake mix and followed the directions on the box.  I did mix the coconut cream and condensed milk together and pour over cake after poking holes through out.  I did not use all of the coconut milk mixture b/c it did seem like it was a lot.  I used 3/4 of what it made but next time I think I will add a little more.  I had read from the other review that some thought it made it too moist.  I then used 1 1/2 tubs of cool whip light and spread over the top and sprinkled fresh coconut sprinkles over the top.  It was absolutely delicious.  I generally prefer the taste of yellow cake over white and it worked well with the coconut cream!  Thank you for the recipe and you won't be disappointed!

I made this recipe for a Valentine's Party at my job for today.  Like previous reviews, I too would suggest cutting down on the liquid.  I used about 16oz total.  It was very moist, and mmm, mmm, delicious!  I didn't toast my coconut as suggested, nor did I use coconut cream.  I used coconut milk, and just used sweetened flaked coconut for the topping  and it came out fab!  I uses whipped topping (like coolwhip) instead of the heavy cream and it was delish!  I would definately make it again!!

My husband requested this cake for his birthday.  Of course I could not wait to try it out.  It was wonderful!!!!!  My mother in-law makes this cake but she does not use the coconut cream.  I will have to share this secret with her because I believe that is what sets this cake apart.  If you use a cake mix that has pudding in it, do not use all of the milk and cream mixture.  Just use 1/2 to 3/4.  Your cake will still be creamy with a melt in your mouth taste.  I learned first hand that the whole amount was too much.  I added some toasted coconut along with regular coconut flakes just for color.

This is a delicious cake...very popular at the dinner I brought it to.  But next time I would decrease the coconut sauce by half to take away from the heaviness and double the whipped cream topping to increase the fluffiness.

This cake was a big hit with everyone. I thought it might turn out too sweet but it didn't.  It's so moist it melts in your mouth! After you pour the sauce over the cake it hard not to think that it may turn out all mushy.  Quite the opposite!  It's light and not too sweet...the perfect cake!

I made this cake the other day when two of my children and six of my grandkids were here and this cake is to die for.
It was inhaled.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe. I didn't put the coconut on top even though I love coconut. I let each person put on their own coconut or not.  Some of my grandkids love the taste of coconut but don't like the actual feel of grated coconut.

One of my favorite cakes ever!  I've made it a couple of times with just 2 minor changes.  I substitute the vegetable oil for coconut oil and omit the coconut extract.  It is absolutely perfect!

This cake is AMAZING! I made the cake exactly the way the recipe specified except for one thing. I did not pour all of the sauce over the cake. The sauce is delicious, but it's very sweet, and there is a lot of sauce. I didn't want the cake to be too sweet or mushy so I stopped pouring after I had poured about 2/3 of the sauce. I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars though because the recipe did state at the top that you didn't have to use all the sauce. Overall this cake is really good! My family loved it, and half of them don't even like coconut lol

I followed this recipe exactly. I bought the ingredients, and while I found coconut MILK at 3 different stores, I proceeded to hunt down coconut CREAM at a 4th store, Whole Foods. I did not read the reviews here first, as the instructions were simple and I knew that everyone in my family likes coconut. Hence, I've finished the cake this morning with the whipped cream, and proceeded to have a piece of cake,  I am so disappointed that no one will be able to finish one piece of this 13 x 9 cake.  I love the flavor, but entirely tooooo sweet.

OK, I need to stop eating this cake!  I made it almost exactly like the original instructions except for three things: I used coconut milk instead of cream; I used egg whites instead of whole eggs; and, I baked in two 8" pans instead of a 9 X 13". The only drawback that I did not account for was the cream mixture made the cakes difficult to remove from their pans after the chilling period. So, it got a little sloppy there -- but frosting covers many cake sins!  Especially this lovely, light whipped cream frosting covered with coconut flakes. And I have to stop eating this cake!  Thanks to GPAIN for the recipe and to Allrecipes for highlighting it!

It was incredibly good. Not too sweet (1/2 can condensed sweetened milk and coconut milk)and with a great coconut taste, though I did add coconut extract to the whip cream.

Perfect as long as you half the amount of sweetened condensed milk like others suggested.  I didn't have coconut cream so I used equal amount of coconut milk which also helped keep the over-sweet taste down.  I loved this recipe.

I have made this cake lots of times and everyone who has tried it raves about it.  I do use a butter cake mix instead of the white cake mix. Also have topped it off with pineapple with toasted coconut.  I agree that you need to let it cool first before refrigerating the cake.  Thanks :-)

I made this cake for Easter this year.  I opted to try and make it into a layer cake, like the picture shows, but found it to be a little difficult to accomplish.  I will probably make this as written next time as a sheet type cake.  

EVERYONE LOVED this!  I can't wait to make it again.

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit. I did toast the coconut before putting on top of the cake, which added a deep nutty flavor. Very yummy!

This is a very nice and easy recipe.  I did have a little trouble finding Coconut Cream - which not all stores carry - but I ended up finding it at Walmart of all places.  I made this into 3 loaf pans as I was giving the cake to three different people.  I mis-judged the cream/milk mixture in the first two pans and they came out overly moist, wet actually, and had less mixture for the last pan.  This was actually the best - it was still very moist but more cake like.  Next time, I will use less of the mixture, but I will definitely make this again!

This cake was A-MAZING. I followed the instructions exactly and it came out perfectly. My brother loved his birthday cake so much, I'm going to make it for him every year!
The only thing that didn't go as planned is the removal of the cake. I was trying to do a double layer but the cake was so sticky and moist (which is what makes it so good!) that I couldn't remove it from the pan. It's one of those cakes where you just cut out individual slices and go from there.
I will be trying it again with a spring form pan and see how that goes. 
It's the best coconut cake recipe I've ever found!

I make this cake all the time with everybody asking for the recipe.  I follow the cake mix instructions and I don't use the sweetened condensed milk.  I only use the cream of cocconut and never have too much for a 9x13 cake.

I didn't use all of the sauce as others recommended....probably 1/2 to 2/3 cup was left over and the cake was still moist and delicious.  Since this was our Easter cake, I decorated the top with pastel colored Jordan almonds ...it was beautiful and a big hit with my family.

I'm joining the chorus of oohs and aaahs for this cake! I'm normally a from-scratch baker, but this cake looks like you slaved away all day (and tastes way more delicious than a regular box cake). I made this as a layer cake, baked in foil pans with scalloped sides, and if you only frost between the layers and the top, the cream oozing out the sides looks absolutely beautiful. I made some substitutions to make it a bit healthier: used lite coconut milk for the coconut cream, and non-fat sweetened condensed milk (it's plenty sweet). I also used unsweetened coconut from the bins at my whole foods market, toasted, in between the layers as well as the top. I did use Cool Whip because I didn't have whipping cream, which isn't bad at all, but obviously real cream would make it even better. This is a perfect cake for a dinner party or shower, and I think berries and/or tropical fruit scattered on the cake plate would also cut the sweetness and make it even more elegant.

excellent cake! i would rate as a 5 if i didn't make alterations. didn't use the sweetened condensed milk as cream of coconut is already plenty sweet enough. also didn't have any coconut extract but, of course, the cream of coconut had plenty of coconutty goodness. and lastly, the family loves toasted coconut, so we toasted a bit to go on top.

DELICIOUS! I only used half of the coconut cream/milk in the cake.  I ended up having to trim off the edges because they were a bit soggy. After icing & spreading cocunut flakes I put the cake back in the fridge for 4-5 hours and it was a huge hit. Dinner Guests took it home with them!

When I was making this cake, I had doubts throughout because, not only was it ugly before it was frosted (all the holes and liquid soaking in are not a very appetizing sight), but the color of the cake after it had soaked was almost questionable. However, the cake turned out to be quite a tasty surprise! I would suggest to others who make this recipe that they make the cake 2-4 days before it is eaten. The longer you allow it to sit, the better it tastes. I wasn't too crazy about it the first 2 days, but by the 4th day the cake was absolutely delicious. I frosted it with the cool whip frosting on this site as suggested by some other viewers and it was wonderful, though it did come off as slightly cheese flavored. Also, I toasted the coconut that I sprinkled over the frosting. One note, if you are using this frosting, I suggest you wait to frost the cake until the day it is going to be eaten or the night before because after it sits for awhile, it begins to taste slightly salty, which doesn't really complement the cake. Otherwise, this cake was delicious. A definite keeper!

I made this as a layer cake and can not do it again. Letting the cake set overnight in the fridge makes it unbelievably sticky to the bottom of the pan and impossible to transfer the cake to a serving platter to finish frosting/decorating. Plus, it was soggy on the bottom of the layers.  I also took the suggestions of others and topped it with the Cool Whipped Frosting, which was honestly the best part of the cake.

Very good but to elevate it I made a few changes.  I substituted low fat coconut milk for water, melted room temp unsalted butter for oil.  Between the layers I added toasted macadamia nuts along with the coconut and whipped icing.  For the frosting I increased the sugar as well as added both vanilla and coconut extracts.  This is a very very sweet cake and a small slice goes a long way.

This cake is incredible! I followed the recipe as written and it was exactly what I had been looking for. If you are a fan of coconut, you must try this recipe! I took it to a party and had no left overs, even the kids loved it.  Thanks to the reviewer who said you can find the coconut cream in the mixed drink section of the grocery store.  I wouldn't have been able to find it without that tip!

The cake turned out great! The only problem was that I had a whole lot of cream left that I did not pour over the cake. Even though I did not use the coconut extract (I put some coconut flakes in the cake mix instead), the cake still had a wonderful sweet coconut flavor.

I don't know why this cake gets so many great reviews but it was horrible.  For one, the cake didn't absorb the condensed milk and coconut cream mixture because it was way too thick.  But on the other hand I'm kind of glad it didn't because the milk mixture was way too sweet.  So in essence, we pretty much ended up eating a plain white cake with an extreme gooey coconut milk mixture glazed on top.  Noooo thank you!

Wow! I made this for my future son in law's birthday and let him take home the leftover cake. The next day, I was craving it so bad, I almost called him to bring it back! I didn't change anything other than substituting lime extract for the coconut extract because I didn't have coconut. It worked so well, I'll be using lime extract whenever I make this and I will be making it again and again. Thanks so much for an incredible recipe!

I am not a huge coconut fan but I have to say that this was the best coconut dessert that I have ever tasted.  I made mine in 2-9in. rounds, used half of the coconut cream/condensed milk,and heavy whipping cream for frosting.  The only other thing I added was mini chocolate chips with the coconut on top of the cream.  Everyone LOVED it!!!

I will NEVER make another coconut cake again after finding this recipe.  OMG.  This is without a doubt the BEST coconut cake I've ever eaten.  The whole pan was GONE by the time Easter dinner was over.  Super easy and super wonderful!  I left mine in the fridge overnight, then put the whipped cream on top the next day, and it was fantastic.  I had another piece on Easter Monday, and it was even better because the filling had a chance to soak in even more after 2 days in the fridge.  Thank you!!

The cake turned out great. It was just way to sweet for my liking. The only thing I will do next time (which it seems everyone else did) is pour only half of the coconut cream mixture down through the cake. This way it won't be too sweet. Otherwise the cake came out moist & good.

This cake is AWESOME...if you can find Coco Lopez for the coconut cream in a 15 oz. can in usually where the tonic, club soda, etc. is in the grocery store, that is what you should use.  The stuff in the baking aisle isn't the right stuff.

Best coconut cake recipe ever!  I used this last year & created a lamb cake for Easter.  My in-laws requested I make it again this year.  I'm going to make it into a bunny this time.  Easy, delicious & the kids love helping decorate it.

I'm making this cake for Easter, but I just wanted to tell everyone who doesn't know about coconut cream,to go to the liquor isle in the market and get Coco Lopez. It should be right by the mixers. I can't wait to try this cake!

I was so disappointed after reading all the great reviews.  There was absolutley nothing special about this cake!  It tasted exactly like what it was... a box mix with syrup poured over it.  Was it "bad"? No, but it wasn't fooling anyone either.  And it surely wasn't worth the 4 dollar can of coconut cream.  Won't be making this one again.

Delicious! Definitely reminded me of the latin cake " Tres Leches". I made this cake using 2-9" round and had to double the whipped cream frosting. Next time, I would even triple it! Also, I like just a little flavor in my whipped cream. Maybe adding 1 teaspoon of coconut extract or vanilla.

I wanted so much to love this cake, I did. But it is much too, much too sweet! I even reduced the amount of sweetened condensed milk and coconut cream to 1 cup each. I had to throw it away.

In one word, this cake is AMAZING!  My husband has decided it's his new favorite cake.  My grocery store was out of coconut extract when I needed it, so I used the coconut cake mix instead of the white cake mix and it tasted just fine.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and let it cool all the way before refridgerating, making sure the cake soaked up all the liquid.  I also used the Cool Whipped Topping recipe on this website that was recommended, but used coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla which was perfect.  I prefer to toast the coconut before topping the cake with it - it adds just the right amount of nuttiness and crunchiness to the cake.  Thanks for the great recipe!

If you like coconut then you must try this cake.  It was delicious!  After I added the milks I waited until the cake was at room tempt before I put it into the frig.  To prevent mushiness I let it cool about an hour and then moved the cake from the pan onto a serving tray.  I had it set in the frig about a day and a half before adding the whipped topping. *Round Two* I had a little "help" with the second cake and learned that, yes, there is such a thing as too many pokes.  The second cake had twice as many poked holes than the first and about half turned to mush...still ate it though ^.^

Any recipe that my family requests that I make again is a 5-star recipe! I baked this for my mother's birthday and everyone loved it. I was unable to find the coconut cream after searching 2 grocery stores, so I settled for coconut milk instead. I was skeptical when I saw how the cake became like bread pudding after I poured the coconut sauce over it, but after letting it absorb over night in the fridge, it was delicious and moist by the next day. I made it in two 9" round cake pans but when I assembled the cake, one layer on top of the other with the whipped cream frosting as filling for the center, it was so moist that it hardly held its form. The top layer cracked in the middle but I was able to cover it with frosting. It was surprisingly moist! I wonder if it would have been different if I had used coconut cream instead of the coconut milk. I will definitely make this again. Next time I will just make this in a large rectangular cake pan and serve it from there!

As a coconut cake fan, I was skeptical about using a cake mix for this recipe, but I'm glad I tried it...it was fabulous! Nobody could believe it was a cake mix recipe and it disappeared quickly! The only thing I did differently was to use the recipe for Cool Whipped Frosting for the top instead of the recommended recipe. For the coconut cream, I used the can found in the wine/liquor section and I did use all the recommended liquid, which kept the cake moist without being soggy. After I poured the liquid over the cake, I let it cool completely before refrigerating. After it sat in the fridge for 2 days, we devoured it! Yummy!

This cake is soooo good and very moist.  I was unsure,but I put all the condensed milk/coconut cream mixture on top after cake was baked.  It seems like so much.  It's not!  Very delicious!  Like other readers~Agree that it is better the next day:)

Wonderful!  I didn't use all of the cream (maybe left out about 1/2 cup, or a little more), and it was perfect!!  I was making this cake for a co-worker who was leaving, and she requested cherries on top.  I spooned cherry pie filling randomly throughout the top, and it was delicious (and pretty) - big hit at the office!!  The next time I made this, I left off the cherries, but sprinkled TOASTED coconut all over the top.  Wow!  Tasted so great & was really pretty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist.  Sinci I love coconut next time I will try to stir some into batter (maybe with some crushed pineapple).  I cheated and topped cake with cool whip.  Will make again.

I made this cake several months ago, for a class of mine.  With our upcoming potluck, everyone insisted I share this again.  It has become my favorite cake, moist and delicious.  Thanks for such a great recipe, I give it more than 5*****'s!

WONDERFUL RECIPE!  I can't say enough how good this cake is.  I had everything but the white cake mix so I used Strawberry instead.  It kind of overpowered the coconut but it was insanely good!  My husband and sister in law haven't stopped talking about it since I made it!  *I just made these cakes for my 2 year old's birthday party.  I made 1 Strawberry, 1 chocolate, and 1 confetti white.  They were a huge hit.  I've actually had some of the guests "order" :) some for their children's parties!  Thanks so much!

This was the best cake I have ever made. I used Coco Lopez cream of coconut and sweetened condensed milk. A few reviewers suggested cutting back on condensed milk if sugar was listed in cream of coconut, but I didn't because the cream of coconut I used was basically chopped up coconut in syrup, at least that is what it looked like. I made it exactly as recipe called for. I made this for a coworker's birthday and it went quick. Everyone that has some raved about it. The homemade whipped cream and the strong coconut flavor made this my new favorite cake. I may try it with crushed pineapple in the whipped topping next time.

This is a no fail recipe as it is. 
The freshest, purest flavors work best, thus butter substitutes for oil, use the best vanilla and/or coconut flavoring ( I use both) and freeze your coconut. 
Use ALL of the sweetened condensed milk and Cream of Coconut.
 It's easy to make and never fails to please.
If you don't want a sweet, richly flavored cake, try another recipe. 
I've made this cake for over 15 years.
and like another reviewer said folks that don't even like coconut love this cake!
This one is a keeper!

This was a bit better than ok.  It wasn't terrible.  If i made it again which i won't but if i did i would omit the coconut extract because i don't feel it added any good flavor.  It had kind of an anise flavor to it. I would definitely not add as much of the sauce over the hot cake. Parts of the bottom were too mushy. It wasn't great.  I was expecting better.

I will definitely make this again. It's delicious and turned out very well, not soggy at all. The recipe as written is an excellent guide. My changes were to use melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, to reduce the sweetened condensed milk to half a can, to use two 9" cake pans for layers, and to shortcut on the icing with a tub of light whipped topping. I followed others' advice to toast the coconut lightly in the oven after the cake came out, to poke holes with a chopstick, to cool the cream-covered cakes fully to room temp before refrigerating, and to make it well in advance of eating (2 days). Doing two layers worked fine. Before pouring on the cream, I leveled off the tops with a serrated knife to be ready for them to sit flat later (and thus didn't really need to poke many more holes). I let the two pans chill in the fridge for several hours, and used a dinner plate to flip them out just fine, even given that they were soaked in the cream. Since everything was cold when I frosted and decorated, it all held up fine. I put whipped topping and some un-toasted coconut between the two layers.

I made this cake for Easter Sunday and it was true perfection... All of my family and guest absolutely loved it... They all are true coconut lovers... I didn't need all of the sauce and I also made a double layer instead of the 13x9 pan.  Was not too sweet or not sweet enough... Oh btw I did add a lil coconut extract to the frosting and one more tidbit... ADD 1 1/2 TABLESPOONS OF COFFEE CREAMER... IT KEEPS THE CREAMER FROM SEPERATING... but definitely try this recipe... Everyone will enjoy it and will be so pleased that you took the time to make it! . I submit a picture as well.

Oh. My. God. This is the best cake I've EVER made. Ever. It's THAT good. I didn't have a cake mix, so I just added the vanilla and dry ingredients from my favorite (Betty Crocker) yellow cake recipe, and it worked beautifully. This is going to be my standby cake from now on!

I have to give this 5 stars. I made it last year for my husband's birthday with the help of my toddler. I had a three year old measuring, mixing, poking holes, and spooning goop and still ended up with a cake that was raved about on taste and appearance.

absolutely amazing ...made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it ... I added colored sugar to the top which gave a Nice candy texture along with the coconut flaks all over it ..i didn't use all of the coconut cream mixture I left out about 1/4 cup as people mention ...  I didnt want it to soggy and it came out great .. I prepared it the night before so it had Time to marinate and just become this delicious coconut cream Cake goodness :-) I will definitely be making this again  ...... oh and chopsticks work best for poking the holes in the cake The coconut mixture falls in perfectly .....

Amazing! My husband has bragged about a coconut cake he ate many years ago that he never forgot. I have paid to have some made for him to no avail; I have made some from other recipes to no avail. Finally, this recipe did the magic. He loved it. I baked it for his birthday and success, success..He Loved it, He loved it....yeah!

Back in  April I made this for Easter.  I wanted to see if it freezes well and I must say it tasted like the first day I made it.  Surprisely, I did not think whipped cream would freeze well, but it did.  The the moist and the whipped cream was yummy.  This is a keeper!!

I made this recipe exactly as written with only one change, I toasted the coconut that I sprinkled over it. I read a lot of reviews about the cake being overly sweet, but my family and I didn't think it was at all.  This is definitely a keeper I will make for many years to come!

Wow! This came out amazing. I used Duncan Hines white cake mix and I could only find coconut cream powder at the store but it worked out fine. I made the whipped topping but also had a can of reddi whip and i actually prefer it with this cake since it's not as sweet as the topping from this recipe. Definitely a favorite

This cake is AWESOME!! I made it for Easter and every one just LOVED it. I did have a problem with the milk mixture running under the cake but it was still good; next time I will poke larger holes so it can absorb into the cake instead of running under. I decorated it with green dyed coconut and scattered jelly bean "eggs" over top.

My family insists I bring this cake to any gathering, especially Christmas.  I sometimes feel if I didn't, they would ask me to leave ;-)
That is how much they love this cake.  It tends to be a hit anywhere and super simple.  If you like coconut, you can not go wrong! If you're in a hurry, Coolwhip makes great frosting.  I have also colored the coconut for different holidays. (red and green for Christmas; green and pink for Easter)

Oh, wow, here I thought I had invented this recipe! :) I was trying to match a Tres Leches at a restaurant here in Houston and I got pretty close using basically this recipe. I use Betty Crocker Homestyle Frosting Mix instead of whipped cream. It's a marshmallow-ish frosting that's closer to what the restaurant uses. I add heavy cream to the coconut cream/sweetened condensed milk mixture and then I can call it Tres Leches. I've served it as straight Tres Leches for years, and just in the last few years I've started adding coconut. My friend from up north, who grew up with French instead of Spanish, insisted on pronouncing it "Tre-luscious" instead of "Tres Leches"!

very flavorful cake and easy too! Be careful not to poke holes all the way to the bottom of the pan or the liquid will sit in the bottom making it soggy.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am a coconut addict! This cake is one of my most favorite recipes. I use Trader Joe's vanilla bean cake mix (tastes like home-made). I don't use the full can of condensed milk because I don't like things that sweet. I also add a little coconut extract to the milk mixture. I've also found that this cake tastes better and better each day it stays in the fridge. I like to make it one or two days in advance. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my go-to coconut cream cake, and it always gets a lot of compliments. I make it as stated, but instead of this frosting I make a fluffy cream cheese frosting (1 block of soft cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tub of cool whip). I also leave off the coconut flakes, just as a personal preference.

Delish!! So good and not to sweet!  Like others said, if you can't find Coconut cream, you can get cream of coconut in the liquor section just remember to leave out the sweetened condensed milk.  I used a little evaporated milk to thin out the cream of coconut, and it worked perfectly.

***** I've made this cake many times, using only half of the cream of coconut, and the condensed milk. I decided to make this recipe for the icing. This was my first time using heavy whipping cream. I searched for tips to stabilize it. I added 1 tsp of powered milk and 1 tsp of corn syrup before beating the cream. I then beat on medium until it had thickened and you could see the beater tracks in it. Then I added the sugar, and flavoring and I used confectioners sugar and increased it to 6 Tab. Then I turned my mixer up higher and beat, until it could stand in peaks. Very good. I was hoping by using the stabilizers this would not 'weep' or disappear on my cake. So far, so good. Will see how it does after sitting overnight.

I don't normally write reviews, but this coconut cake was amazing!  I made it for a summer BBQ and everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was I used a little over half of the can of sweetened condensed milk.  It was perfect, the whipped cream topping keeps the cake nice and light with the perfect amount of sweetness in the cake.  Delish!

I used the Coco Real cream of coconut from the alcohol mixer section of the grocery store and mixed that with the sweetened condensed milk.  The mix was sooo much and so sweet was nervous to add all of it and I'm glad I did.  I used the handle end of a wooden spoon to poke (I made a 3 layer round) and it turned out perfect.  Very moist, but not wet whatsoever.  I made this for my mom's birthday and she loved it.  I added a little more sugar to the whipped cream and also added coconut extract to that as well.  Best coconut cake ever.

This recipe is AMAZING!! Let me just tell you, I am horrible at baking!, but I made this for my best friend's birthday and no could get enough of it. My brother said it was the best cake he ever had! Not to mention it was simple. This recipe is great for the baking-impaired, like myself, and everyone will think you're a cake genius! I brought a piece for all the girls in office and they all wanted the recipe.  In conclusion: SOOOOOO GOOD!

EVERYONE who tried this cake, loved this cake. It is going to be one of my favorites for sure. I might try a little less condensed milk (It was on the verge of too sweet). It was very moist, sweet and the whipped icing is a must with the cake itself being so sweet.

I made this cake for my mother who loves coconut cake. I have been trying many different recipes. My Mom LOVED this cake. She was going to take most of it to work because she didn't want to eat the whole thing, but after trying it she decided to keep it all to her self (well she shared three slices with friends). When I told her there was one more recipe I wanted to try, she said why bother? This was the best coconut cake she's ever had. I did make one adjustment...I only used about 3/4 - 1 cup of the coconut milk/condensed milk mixture. It would have been WAY too wet if I had added it all. The cake still turned out very moist and dense. I would like to try this as a layered cake next time, but not sure how that will work out because of adding the liquid to the layers might make it too heavy.

My fiancee, the coconut lover, gives this five stars. This turned out beautiful: incredibly moist with a lovely light coconut flavor, but not too sweet. It baked perfectly in the oven in 30 minutes. I also had the dillema of not being able to find coconut cream, so I mixed together half a can of the sweetened condensed milk and a full can of coconut milk for the cream, and I made sure I only poked holes halfway through the cake. It took me a long time to whip the cream to the right consistency, but the end result was worth it. Added a bit of coconut extract to it and only half the sugar. I made it on a Wednesday night and it sat in the refrigerator until Friday night when I made the frosting, so everyone is right about it being better eating it cold and after letting it sit for a day or two before eating. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome coconut cake recipe - I've made it many, many times and have shared the recipe with several people as well. It's always a huge hit! I make it in a 9x13" oblong glass pan. I use a can of coconut milk (not the lowfat version) and the sweetened condensed milk. I let it rest overnight in a cool place. I frost it with a cream cheese frosting that has a carton of whipped topping folded in to it (1/4 stick of butter, 4 oz. cream cheese, half a box of powdered sugar, 1/2 teasp. vanilla and 1/4 teasp. coconut extract then fold in the whipped topping). I liberally sprinkle coconut on top - but I also toast some coconut to sprinkle on top as well. This is a great recipe - not too sweet and light and lovely coconut flavor!

I made this cake in a 9x13 pan, I was too chicken to attempt a layer cake.  In anycase, I really liked this cake. I am not of big fan of tres leches cakes, but this I liked alot. It was very coconutty, and although it was sweet, it wasn't too sweet. I topped it with the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site I did find coconut cream pudding mix and used that instead of vanilla to bring out the coconut flavor and it paired perfectly. I garnished with fresh strawberries and it was a big hit with my family. Will be making again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  I made the mistake of trying to make a layer cake out of this recipe and duplicate the beautiful picture submitted by Erin.  Not sure how she did it, but for me the cakes stuck to the pans and sorta fell apart.  It was way to good to throw out though, so I used the bits of cake as a base layer for trifle and added fresh strawberries, more whipping cream and shredded sweetened coconut.  It was a HUGE hit!!  Everyone loved it and came back for seconds.  This cake is so moist and delicious!  I'm still rating it a 5 even though it didn't turn out perfectly for me because had I followed the original recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, everything would have been perfect.  It's a big pet peeve of mine when someone deviates from the recipe and then gives it a negative rating.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cake is way too sweet, and despite using the coconut cream it wasn't very coconut in taste.  I would eliminate the condensed milk as I think it over powered the coconut cream.  Probably wouldn't make again as the sweetness is way too cloying.

This cake is amazing.  Even non-coconut lovers will love this cake.  I've taken it several different places and it's gobbled up at each one.  I find that it's best served chilled - but room temperature is fine, too.

I seldom write reviews but this is the most delicious coconut cake I ever tasted.  My family and friends couldn't stop complimenting on how moist and superb it is and the disappointed faces when there was no more remaining just led me to write this review.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I thought I totally screwed this up when the coconut milk was not soaking in but it turned out SO delicious and moist.  I brought it to a work get together and everyone raved about it!  This is a keeper!

I made my own cake mix instead of boxed cake mix.  I used 2 cups flour, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 4 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp salt. Add the 3 eggs, 1/3 cup oil, 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  I put the batter in a greased and floured bundt cake.  When the cake came out of the oven I poked holes with a chopstick and added only coconut cream in the holes and then place in the refrigerator overnight.  Next time I think that I will add the coconut cream with a small funnel after I poked it with a chopstick or the other end of a wooden spoon because it was a little messy on top.  The next day I frosted the cake and sprinkle cake with flaked coconut .  My daughter gave half the cake to her friend and her friend said, "It was so.......good".

This was an awesome cake recipe.  I did use coconut milk instead of cream because some people eating it are watching their sugars.  I ended up tossing about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the sauce out because it stopped seeping in and was just running to the edges.  The cake was still super moist but not horribly soggy (except one corner peice)  Normally I bring leftovers home from BBQ's but not this time.  I even have my second one in the fridge right now for my Mom to try.  If you love coconut, you'll love this cake.  Superb! Would love to try it with banana cake or chocolate cake :)

This cake was pretty tasty, but VERY sweet. Unlike many other reviewers, my cake did take all of the coconut/milk mixture - but I poured it in batches. I poured a little on the cake, then waited a bit, then poured a little more on, then waited etc. until it was all used up. It soaked through the cake and didn't pool at the bottom of the pan at all. I think that's the trick. This cake has a very moist texture - and for some, it can be off-putting. I loved the texture, but my husband said it was like eating cake that someone had already chewed up (but he liked the flavor). I'll definitely do this again, but may alter the amount of sauce I use to make this a bit less sweet.

I made this cake for Mother's Day and it was fantastic!! One brother said he wants it for his birthday and another brother said it was the best cake he has had in years!! I made it in two 8 inch cake pans. I followed some of the other reviews and let the cake soak in at room temp, plus I toasted the coconut for the top and it was delicious.  The cake didnt take all of the sauce-but I saved it served it on the side and we had a blast drizzling over our pieces!  This is a keeper. I will be making this for many years.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love cake and I looove coconut, and so I fully expected to love this recipe. I didn't. That may be due in part to the fact that I couldn't find coconut extract and had to sub in lemon extract. But I think it was due mainly to the fact that the cake was simply much too sweet. Did it taste good? Yes . . . but if I try it again, I will definitely find coconut extract, and I will use coconut milk instead of the coconut cream. I might cut back on the sweetened condensed milk, as well. I would probably also make the white cake from scratch rather than using a box mix, as I don't think that did anything to help the cake.

This was the best (and easiest) coconut cake I have ever made.  And I love coconut so I have tried a lot.  I made a 2-layer cake....the 9x13 would probably have been easier when absorbing the coconut cream/milk mixture.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add coconut extract to the whipped cream.  The whipped topping really made the cake.  Overall the cake was creamy and moist.

I've been wanting to bake a coconut cake for sometime & this didn't disappoint!  I made it for Easter & it came out delicious...moist, fluffy, creamy frosting & just the right coconut flavor.  I followed the cake recipe exactly.  Made 2 9inch round cakes for layering.  Added the condensed milk/coconut cream mixture to the hot cakes right out of the oven, let cool to room temperature & then refrigerated overnight.  I was worried they might come out soggy, but they were perfect & moist. Instead of the whipped cream frosting w/ the recipe, I used the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site (just substituted coconut extract for vanilla) and it was a perfect combination.  Just enough frosting for the layered cake.  Added coconut flakes w/ the frosting in between layers and all over the cake. It looked so pretty & tasted even better!

I think this should be called Aloha Cake! What a dream! This cake is wonderful. Next time I think I will use about 8oz of coconut cream (it's really fattening if you read the label) and 1/2 a can of sweetened condensed milk. All of the milk mixture didn't absorb into the cake. I left my cake in a bundt cake pan when pouring 1/2 the milk mixture in and then with the other 1/2 I had flipped the cake over.  My whipped cream topping came out weird, maybe I whipped it too long, so I made it with the Cool Whipped Frosting that has a ton of great reviews with the whipped cream I just made. Very good cake! Aloha!

I'm not a fan of doctored cake mixes but I must say this one was very nice. Do take the time to use all of the infusing syrup; it is worth the effort. I cooled my cake layers first before adding about half of the syrup and then chilled the cake for several hours (you could do it overnight). In the morning once it had set up better, I added the rest and chilled several more hours. We did a layer cake using a double batch of frosting and the presentation was lovely.

My family loved this cake.  I LOVE coconut so I added twice the flavoring to the cake batter.  I also followed other advice and didn't use all the cream sauce on the cakes.  They were still very moist and didn't lack flavor.  I also layered the cake so I had to make twice the amount of whipped cream frosting, I also only used a small spoonful of 10x sugar in the whipped cream.  I used chipped coconut to sprinkle on the top.  Since it is not sweetened I think it helped to keep the flavor from being too sweet. Very yummy!

OH...MY...GOODNESS!!!!  I consider myself to be a fairly good cook.  In my mind, I'm an even better baker.  However, I have NEVER baked ANYTHING that was as good as this cake!  It was delicious!  I wanted more for the frosting, so I took the advice of chibi chef and used the cool-whipped frosting from this site.  Also, it only took about half of the syrup mixture to completely moisten my cakes.  I would have been afraid to add any more than that.  I will definitely make this many, many more times!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was delicious! Everyone loved it- even people who don't like coconut! I'll definitely be making this again. I'd suggest using a little less sugar in the frosting, since the cake is already rich and sweet. Wonderfully moist and flavorful. Not unlike a coconut Tres Leches cake. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh WOW!!  This was FABULOUS!!  The changes I made were to use a butter recipe yellow cake that I added a tsp of coconut flavoring to and one bite....my family came completely unglued, it was soooooo delicious!!!  I toasted the coconut that went on top as well.  Despite the consternation of the family, I let it sit 24 hours before serving (in the refrigerator) and what a difference I'm sure this made.  The entire lower half of the cake soaked up the condensed milk/cream of coconut and made it extra moist and VERY yummy!!  This one will be a regular in our house!!!

this was excellent and easy!  I agree w/the others that it is even better the next day.  Although we could not wait till the next day and ate it a few hours after we made it and it was still delicious. Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again especially when I have to bring something for potluck since I can make it the day before.

This cake is delicious.  I made it several days before my sons birthday for dessert, and had leftovers in my fridge.  At the birthday party, instead of eating the regular birthday cake, someone got this cake out of the fridge, and then everyone had some of it until it was completely gone.  The birthday cake didn't fare as well!  Everyone loved it!

I'm really glad I tried this recipe!  I got lots of compliments on it and people were in disbelief when I said I made it myself.  I followed the directions except used only about 3/4 of the coconut-cream & sweetened condensed milk mixture to pour on the cakes.  I could have used all of it and it would not have been "too mushy" although I would consider cutting back on the amount of the s.c. milk as it is very sweet.  I followed the cake decorating tips on this site in terms of trimming and frosting and I used the "special buttercream frosting" and added some coconut extract to it.  I decorated the cake exactly as the picture shows with the flaked coconut and the limes and it looked gorgeous!

This cake is easy and very good.  I did take some suggestions and waited to put the whipped cream and coconut on the next day. The reason for the 4 stars is because of the next day frosting; other than that a 5! Thanks for the recipe.

This was an exceptional cake (I try to keep from sneaking bites of the left overs in the fridge!) I didn't have coconut cream and just used the "milk" straight from a coconut and added a little coconut extract in the whipping cream and it was to die for! Not too sweet, very refreshing, a keeper for sure!

I made it for Mother's day and both my parents, my husband, my sister and her husband and even my 6 and 10 year old nephews couldn't finish more than a few bites because it was just way over the top too sweet. Very disappointing considering the other reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and maybe it is better in a few days as some other reviewers said???  If I make it again, I'm going to leave out the sweetened condensed milk or maybe use 1/4 of what's called for in the recipe.

IF RECIPE IS FOLLOWED, this cake is by far the best "not from scratch" cake I have ever tasted, and so easy.  HOWEVER, IT DID NOT START OUT THAT WAY.  I made the cake 2 days ahead as suggested by others which was a good idea.  I then deviated from the recipe and used the "cool whip frosting" recipe suggested by others and that was a flop, literally.  I don't know if it was because I used skim milk, but the frosting literally melted off the sides of the cake.  I scraped it all off the cake, used the whipping cream as directed in the recipe and it worked perfectly. Even my husband who always requests my homemade black forest cake for his birthday says he wants this one next time.  Thanks.  YUM!!!

This cake is amazing! I made it in two 8" rounds to make it like the picture. Following some reviews, I allowed the cake to soak up the sauce for a couple of days before frosting and layering. I also put the limes on it like the picture. Everyone was really impressed! It was gone within minutes.

Delicious! I followed others advice and used all of the sauce and allowed the cake to cool at room temp first before refrigerating. Kept in fridge for 2 days. Whipped up the frosting before serving using powdered sugar instead of granualted as recipe calls for. Frosting was perfect... light and not too sweet, which balances out the sweetness and richness of the cake. This cake is so moist and yummy. My friends accused me of buying it from a bakery!

Ok this was to die for!!!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used a DH coconut supreme mix and then add extract to the cake AND I used skim milk instead of water, I also used about 1/2 package of dry vanilla pudding.  I only had 1/2 can of Coco Lopez so I used it to 1 full can of Sweetened condensed milk (could've used only half). I made 2 8" rounds and only used about 1/2 of the sauce mixture.  It does make alot.  I made 7 minute frosting with some coconut extract as well as vanilla extract to it along with a pinch of fine kosher salt( to cut the sweet).  It was extremely moist yet not soggy!

Thanks for sharing!

this was delicious and very easy and I used nearly all the sauce for the cake.  It is better to find something to make larger holes than a tooth pick and do not pierce to the bottom.  I did not use the frosting but as many other reviewers  suggested used the coolwhip topping from this site and OMG!!! you will not be able to stop eating this!!!!

I made this cake for a friends birthday.  The cake was simply to make and tasted like you had baked for hours.  I bake and try new recipes on a day to day bases and this will definitly be put in my fault of recipes. One quick tip: I would recommend a Kitchen-Aid mixer for the whipping cream and sugar topping.

VERY good. I went ahead and made it 2 days in advance to sit in the fridge. Followed other users' advice and poured the milks on the hot cake and let it come to room temp before refrigerating. Tasted delicious. I doubled the recipe and made a 2 layer 10" cake. USE ALL THE SAUCE!

This cake was very good. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, but it was still good. I couldn't find coconut cream so I used coconut milk also. It absorbed into the cake very well.

I made this cake to Thanksgiving and it was a 100% hit with everyone. A note on the frosting...I used extra creamy Cool Whip Topping, a Half cup of Milk and Coconut Cream Instant Pudding Mix. It was awesome!! As other readers I found it a little hard to remove the cakes from the pan being that it was a bit sticky but they still come out on one piece so I can't be too upset. It cake rocks!

This cake was divine. It is easy to get worried at the amount of sauce there appears to be, but it all soaked up nicely and the cake wasn't soggy at all. I used the Cool Whipped Frosting recipe but forgot to add some coconut extract- next time!

This is definitely better cold than at room temperature.  I think it tastes a lot like those butter milk snack sticks made by Dolly Madison or Little Debbie.  It got rave reviews at the pot luck I made it for.

This cake was okay. I made it for my family for Easter and half of the cake was left over because it was too sweet. Thanks for sharing this recipe though---presentation was great with green coconut "grass" and Peep bunnies/chicks with egg shaped candy.

Yumo is all I can say!  So easy.  I served this at Easter and made it exactly as the recipe called for.  Be warned this cake becons to you from the kitchen.  My husband and I could not stay out of it.  Once a month for our fundraisers I am asked to make a cake for my church and this is going to be my new dessert.

I made this for Easter and the whole family enjoyed it. Bake the cake and pour on the liquid the night before. I used all the liquid and it was just enough to keep the cake moist, but not wet. It was delicious.

AWESOME!!!   I made this cake for Easter and it was a huge hit.  I prepared it exactly per the recipe and it came out moist and delicious.  The most important step is making it the night before so it can set.  I will definitely be making this again!

Made it the night before a pot luck, and I guess it didn't have enough time to set -- since the bottom was still too moist. The next day after that it tasted perfect. 

Only used 3/4 of the milk mix.

My family liked this cake more than I did. I didn't have any coconut crème on hand, so I used coconut milk instead. Because of that, I added 1 tsp coconut extract to the milk mixture. It turned out good because coconut milk doesn't have as much flavor as coconut crème does. I also used only a half of the milk mixture not wanting the cake to be soggy. I should have used the entire thing because it was a bit too dry. I will probably make this cake again but in a smaller pan - 9x13 took us a bit long to finish!

This is a delicious cake that's so easy to make.  Nice and moist; the coconut flavor
is not over-powering.  I'm a spaz in the kitchen and could never mess this up!  Yum.

Made this for Easter and it is beyond amazing. Everybody loved it!  I adjusted the ingredients slightly to adjust to our tastes. I used UNSWEETENED coconut cream mixed with a half a can of sweetened condensed milk and it was plenty sweet enough.  I also added 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the whipping cream. This is my new favorite cake!

Reduced the sweetness and it was a Big hit with the dessert picky work crowd.  I did reduce the sweetened condensed milk by half and used unsweetened shredded coconut.  Wonderful coconut flavor balanced with the lighter sugar and cool whipped cream topping.

Use a can of coconut milk and a can of coconut cream (Coco Lopez), don't use condensed milk. You also don't need coconut extract. Make with two cake pans to layer it. I also liked having a layer of toasted coconut in the middle it was amazing! Adding limes around the outside for decoration and leaving it to sit in the fridge overnight gives it a nice little coconut/lime twist. It's a hit and has been requested many times.

I made this and I added coconut extract to the batter to try to make it taste like a coconut cake. No such luck.  It is just too sweet and sticky on the teeth.

This is a super easy and fast cake to make.  As suggested by another reviewer, I used the Coconut water combined with the sweetened condensed milk, rather than the Coconut Cream and it was delicious.  I got lots of nice comments on the cake and because it's so easy, I will definitely make it again.

Ugh, this recipe is legitimately TERRIBLE. I am a skilled baker and followed the recipe exactly. Cake and cream were made perfectly, but the recipe essentially consists of white cake mix and whipping cream, and that  is exactly what it tastes like....fake, chemical cake and plain whipped cream. Even added more coconut ingredients but still tastes completely PLAIN PLAIN PLAIN and definitely artificial. Almost inedible, and I'm not a fussy eater, especially when it comes to cake. I don't understand how over 400+ people said this was good! Don't waste your money and make something else for dessert!

This cake is like a tres leches cake, but even better! You can control the level of sweetness for the liquid poured over it. I used a whipped topping/milk/vanilla instant pudding topping and sprinkled coconut over it. Delicious and great to look at!

My son and I love anything coconut! So I tried this recipe because I felt it would be quick and easy. It actually isn't really any easier or quicker than some of the more 'from scratch' recipes on this site...[like Aunt Connie's Coconut Cake, for instance]. I've given this recipe 3 stars*** because when frosted and covered in flaked coconut it looks pretty.  But, though somewhat moist, I just couldn't get the 'boxed/artificial taste'  out of the batter and cake when finally baked.  Even tried putting coconut in the batter... Not knowing that the base was from an albeit premium boxed mix, my son said, "Where did you get coconut cake mix?  I didn't know they had that. Thought you always make your cakes from scratch..." ARRRRRG!!!! Oh well, will know better next time.

I was so disappointed. I let the cake and the coconut milk concoction soak into the cake overnight. I did use coconut milk, maybe i should have used cream of coconut. The cake I thought had a nice flavor but the cake was not that firm but wet, also like a tiramisu should of consistency .
If I make it next time I will be sure to add cream of coconut not coconut milk.

I made this cake for my elderly father and everyone loved it!  It was moist and the "frosting" was light enough with a dusting of sweetened coconut flakes!  From my 21 year old son to my dad's 55 year old caregiver, it was a hit!  Would definitely make this again, especially for those coconut lovers!

This cake is amazing! My advice is to make the cake 1 day ahead of time and let the liquid coconut mixture soak into the cake overnight. Frost it in the morning and it's perfect!

This was very good! Made it for my husbands birthday and he loved it. Did not have coconut flavoring and was not missed.  Next time I will poke holes in the cake while hot, but will wait for it to cool before adding the liquid! Delish!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it! A couple of suggestions.....when mixing the coconut cream (I found it in the Asian aisle of my grocery store) and condensed milk, mix a little of the condensed milk at a time and taste as you go because it can be really sweet. Even though the coconut cream is not sweet the cake mix is. Also I only used about 2/3 of the mixture to pour over top because otherwise the cake would have been too mushy! Lastly, I did not put any sugar in the whipping cream topping because I was afraid the cake would be too sweet and I am glad I didn't. My family is now asking that I make this for every get together!

Adding to my review....I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of cream of coconut.  I mixed the solid part of the coconut milk with the sweetened condensed milk to pour on top, and replaced the water in the cake recipe with the liquid part of the coconut milk, adding a little water to make 1 cup.  I also used Cool Whip instead of whipped cream, thinking that it would hold up better.  I will have to try the Cool Whip frosting from this site one of these days.

My daughter asked for coconut cake for her birthday this weekend. I haven't made one in many years. This was easy and an absolutely overwhelming success!!! Even had one guest  walking thru the house with his empty plate asking, if I made it?  When I said yes, he said that he didn't like CCC, but  that this one was SPECTACULAR!! Woohoo!! Not a crumb left over. Will be remaking.  I'm on Weight Watchers.  I ate a whole piece and it was worth every point!!  NOTE: The picture is a 2 layer round. The recipe is a 9 x 13 rectangle.  In my opinion, this would be too moist to  hold well as a double layer. Perfect and quicker as a 1 layer.

Loved, loved this cake!! I did change the recipe a tad bit b/c I like to use milk and butter instead of water and oil but this cake was exactly what I was looking for! My mother in law requested a coconut cream cake for her birthday and I wanted a recipe that was both quick and easy plus rich in flavor. This cake was the perfect pick! Like Nacy Do said, be careful to read the cans before you by them. I found a can of unsweetened coconut cream in the Asian aisle and I used that with the sweetened condensed milk. Perfect variation! I will definitely use this recipe again!!

Easy to make and tastes like a traditional Tres Leches...with coconut!   I added a layer of coconut below and sprinkled on top of the whipped cream topping.  Everyone voted it as a 'do-over'.

Made this for Easter.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe as written.  One caveat--If making a layer cake, which I did, be very careful removing cakes from the pans and assembling the layers.  It's a very delicate cake because it is so moist.  Very good though.

Have made this cake for Christmas Eve the last 2 years.  I use a chopstick to make in a bundt pan and use chopsticks to make the holes for the coconut liquid - best made a day ahead of time.  I don't use all the liquid, about half of it.  I serve with a side of fresh whipped cream that I add a little sugar and coconut extract too, and sprinkle with freshly toasted coconut.  This year I may also serve with some fresh strawberries.

It was wonderful. I used 24 oz of whipped cream to cover this cake. I subbed the water in the mix for coconut milk and added coconut extract to the cake. I made this into a layer cake

This cake was amazing! I have used coconut milk and the consistency was thinner than when I used  coconut cream. I found coconut cream at my local Trader Joe's and it is not sweet. I would recommend using coconut cream and less condensed milk as it can be too sweet.

Wow, wow, wow!!! This is a keeper! I followed the recipe to the letter. Actually, not true. I added a teaspoon of coconut extract to the whipped cream. It was so good!!! The coconut cream I used was Goya and it worked well. At first, the cake was gooey and I was afraid it would be too moist. After it sat in the fridge all day (BEFORE frosting) it firmed up. I will make this again and again!! Thank you!

Made this for Easter and it was a HIT!  Everyone loved it!  So moist, not cloyingly sweet, and just delicious. Easy to make too!  Doesn't get better than that.

I made this for school yesterday, for a faculty breakfast. Everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. There is none left! I wish I had taken a picture-will do that next time I make it. It makes a "picture-prefect" cake and was superb! I may cut the condensed milk in half next time, as it is a really sweet cake.

I have never made a coconut cake before. Since my mother ask for a different kind of dessert for Christmas I came across this one .... OHHHH the reviews that I got. Everyone was impressed with the presentation and the texture and flavor was spot on. The only change I made was that I only used half the cream mixture on the cake. I let in sit in the fridge overnight. I used two round cake pans and frosted the whole cake then covered in mounds of coconut. I finished off the decorations with red cherries as holly berries and green sliced cherries as leaves ..... Not only was it beautiful it was simply divine. Thank you for a wonderful keeper of a recipe. This is going to be a tradition during the holidays

I could not make these work as cup cakes, I worked my way around it & was able to make it semi-okay. Pouring the sweetened condensed milk & coconut mixture over the cupcakes is what made me unable to hand these out to people. I ended up peeling the wrapper off all of them out of the oven & poured the mixture over each cupcake, I will try making this as a cake if I like the cup cakes, they're chilling now & waiting for frosting. I used my favorite white cake recipe the "Simple White Cake" from this site & then just followed along from there. This recipe is great, just not a cupcake recipe. Ive been craving coconut flakes, so excited to try these tomarrow morning.

It's true, this is a great recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it looks and smells wonderful.  I used  the buttercream frosting recipe on the powdered sugar box and added a little coconut extract to it.  It was fun assembling it and the shortcut using a box mix was a great idea.

Such a simple cake and it tastes so good! I ended up using coconut milk and the whole can of sweetened condensed milk and it was a little bit wetter than I would have liked. It ended up having a small amount of syrup left over which I worked into the whipped cream frosting. I decided to make 2 9-inch round cakes and put some of the frosting in between the two so I had to double the frosting ingredients and flaked coconut. I think it ended up looking quite pretty and everybody loved it!

I never make a cake with a cake mix but this sounded really good so I tried it. I have only given this cake three stars because it is made with a box cake.  This cake was okay but I think using a white or coconut cake recipe from scratch would make it a 5+ star cake.  I will try it and see.

Way better than expected, everyone loved it and adding the coconut extract to the cream was perfect. I could only find cream of coconut (instead of coconut cream) but just adjusted the amount of condensed milk to taste.

I love it, I had to make some changes based upon what I had available. I used coconut milk as recommended from another review. I did use the whole thing of sweetened condensed milk and with these two there was too much sauce. I split the recipe into cupcakes and a small cake for two different events and I feel like I wasted the goodness of the mixture. Also, I did not have coconut extract so I used vanilla. This really helped make the coconut taste more subtle and not overwhelming like others complained about. I added more sugar to the whipping cream because I thought it was bland and it turned out great, not too sweet and not underwhelming.

This cake is super easy and super delicious. I used the back of a rubber spatula to punch very large holes in the cake. I added more coconut extract (1 tsp) and it tastes best served cold. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for my father-in-law's birthday and we all really enjoyed it. I made it as a two-layer cake with toasted coconut and it looked really pretty!! I'm giving it 4 stars because the coconut milk/condensed milk combo didn't absorb that well into the cake layers. Perhaps I should've used a wooden spoon handle rather than a bamboo skewer to make bigger holes. Also, where the mixture poured over the edge of the cake into the sides of the pan, the edges got too saturated and started to fall apart like a graham cracker that's been left soaking in milk for too long. Next time I may just use the coconut cream found in the alcoholic beverage section of the grocery store and omit the condensed milk (which seemed too thick to me to be absorbable) and see how that turns out. Per other's suggestions, I also used the Cool Whipped Frosting recipe and used cheesecake instant pudding instead of coconut (couldn't find coconut) and added coconut extract instead of vanilla and it was sooo tasty! Would definitely make again.

I've been making this cake for years and built quite a legendary reputation with family and friends because of it.  A couple of suggestions.  Get the Super Moist whilte cake mix and use the egg-whites-only version on the box.  When it's finished, simply spread an 8oz carton of Cool Whip on top and then spread TOASTED coconut all over it.  You will LOVE the way the toasted, crispy coconut tastes on top of this rich cake.  Enjoy!

Great cake, will make again. Instead of the frosting listed, I used extra-creamy whipped topping and lots of sweetened flaked coconut on top. I also made the cake ahead, fridged it, and on the second day after baking, served it. The flavors had really sunk in and it was awesome. My husband, who loves coconut (and is picky about it) truly liked this cake!

Delicious! Made it today for Mother's Day and she just can't get over it!  I had a slight problem because nowhere in town carries coconut cream. Instead, I read some reviews and in place of coconut cream I used 7 oz of cream of coconut and 7 oz of coconut milk. I mixed this with the condensed milk and it turned out wonderfully! Not at all too sweet! I also toasted the coconut before putting it on, just as a personal preference!  This was also my first time making whipped cream but I followed the directions as is and that turned out perfect as well!

One Fantastic Cake!  I made this Superbowl Sunday along with a chocolate sheet cake which is also to die for!  Everyone raved about the cake and it was gone before you know it.  The frosting being whipped cream makes the cake so light and not too sweet.  I'll make this many times.

This cake is excellent. I didn't use all of the mixture on the cake since I was nervous it would be soggy. It turned out just perfect. Really great cake.

Definitely a winner--but I can't figure out how to infuse the coconut cream/milk mixture and then get the cake to hold together.  Either it's too dry and looks great or is perfectly infused and then won't hold together.   I would recommend using a 9x13 cake pan instead of two rounds.

This was absolutely wonderful. I personally am not a huge fan of coconut but I made the cake for my mom's birthday. She fell in love with it. She said this is now her favorite cake. Everyone who ate it said it was great. I used all the milk mixture( it looks like a lot but does not make the cake soggy) and let it sit on the counter til it came to room temperature then put it in the fridge. I topped it with Cool Whipped Frosting from this site.

This was a really delicious cake - I used a regular white cake mix, left out the coconut extract because I didn`t have any and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  When it was done I cut it in half and made it into a square layer cake using the whipped cream as frosting in between layers and on top of cake.  It tastes really coconutty and is very sweet but seriously delish!!  It was still excellent after 2 days.  I`m not at all a fan of cake mixes but this cake really changed my opinion about using them as a base for something fancier.  Don`t hesitate to try it if you like coconut and white cake.  Even my son who normally doesn`t like coconut loved it!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe

If you make this cake I promise you won't be sorry!!!! This is the best cake ever, I have made it several times and it always I mean always gets rave reviews.  I've made it as the recipe says and I also make it with chocolate cake and almond extract.  It is the best ever!!!! I also use the whip cream recipe on this sight for the frosting with vanilla pudding and cool whip but when I make chocolate I use chocolate pudding and almond extract. This cake has made me famous with my friends and family.

Made this for my twin girls first birthday party - tried to make it round just like the picture but it was tough! The soggy cake was hard to pull out of the pan and hard to stack and even harder to ice! But even with all of the stress making it, we loved the taste. Will give this 4 stars because of the fiasco making it, but would give 5 if I would have made it as directed in the recipe instead of the picture

Awesome cake! I made this for a friend's birthday and she loved it. The only thing I will do next time is cut the cream mixture in half or maybe even a third. It made way too much and the cake would have been very soggy if it was all used.

I made this for my husband's lodge for one of their "potlucks" and it went over beautifully.  There were two coconut cakes and mine was gone within 20 minutes and the other cake only had one slice taken out of it :D I did make some adjustments (couldn't fine coconut cream so I used half cream of coconut and half coconut milk) and I made it in 9x13 cake pan (easier travel).  Using this recipe I did learn that whipped cream can stay fluffy and nice overnight - YAY! I didn't use all of the sugar to sweetened the whipped cream since the cake had all that numminess soaking into it and it turned out great.  I've received requests to make this every potluck! Thanks!!

This cake is AMAZING!  If you make this cake once, be warned that you will be hounded to make it time and time again.  I usually make mine using the butter yellow flavor boxed cake mix, and frost with homemade butter cream frosting (spiked with a little bit of cream of coconut)+ flaked coconut.  Make sure you let the cake sit to soak in the cream of coconut/condensed milk...I usually pop mine in the fridge overnight to sit before frosting.

This cake was very easy to make and came out delicious.  I recommend making this cake the night before so that the coconut cream has time to soak into the cake.  I made the cake for July 4 and prepared it the same day.  I had a two hour commute to my families house and was disappointed that I did not let the cake sit for long.  The moment I got there everyone wanted dessert.  We cut the cake and it was so good.  Three hours later I had another piece and it was to die for.  I have to emphasis LET THE CAKE SIT for several hours before serving.

This was an amazing cake.  I made this for father's day since my dad (and entire family) loves coconut flavored anything.  I made a few minor changes to the stated recipe.  To the cake mix:  I used 2 whole eggs and one egg white, added an 2 TSP of coconut extract, and substituted coconut milk for the water, just to add extra coconut flavor.  I used the entire milk mixture, and let it sit for two days before frosting with a coconut whipped cream that I came up with: 3 TBLS powdered sugar, 2 TSP of coconut extract, and 1 TSP vanilla to one cup of whipped heavy cream.  It was the perfect amount of "icing" for a 9x13 cake.  We don't like the texture of shredded coconut, so I left that out, and didn't feel like the cake was missing a thing.

This was pretty good.  Really rich though.  I didn't sprinkle flaked coconut over the top though as no one likes the texture of coconut.

I've made this several times, and each time it's a hit.  Easy, and it still tastes very gourmet!  I toast the coconut to sprinkle on the top.

This was the best cake I ever had!  I'm not a big cake fan but I love coconut and that is what inspired me to make this cake.  I didn't change much only one thing and that was that I didn't have coconut extract.  The cake still had a nice coconut flavor.  The cake was very moist.  I will be using this cake for company or to take to events from now on.

This recipe was awesome! I made this cake for our Memorial Day cookout and everyone loved it, some said it was the best coconut cake they've ever eaten.  I'm sure it will be on the menu from now on.  THANKS :)

I really loved this recipe; the flavour and simplicity.  I did not use the condensed milk/cream of coconut mixture (I thought it would be too sweet).  I took the advice of other posters, and bought 1 can of coconut milk. I made the cake mix as directed on the box, except I substituted 1/3 of the water with coconut milk.  I poured the rest of the coconut milk in the holes and I toasted the sweetened coconut. We couldn't wait until the next day, so after it cooled completely at room temperature, I put the icing on and garnished with the toasted coconut.  It was sooo good then, but it does taste even better the next day.

AWESOME!!!  I took it to the mother-in-law's house for Mother's Day and it was a HUGE success.   Made the cake as directed, topped it with "easy whipped cream" from this site, and then sprinkled toasted and un-toasted coconut over the top.   Thank you so much for this recipe, GPAIN.  Even after 25 years, it still feels good to impress the MIL!

Wouldn't use all the condensed milk the next time I make it - too wet/moist.  I made it once not using the canned condensed milk and having to make up my own condensed milk recipe and it was awesome.  I also used spray whipped topping instead of the whipping cream and sugar to make it easier and this worked great both times.  Just cut down on the condensed milk unless you want Coconut Cream Soup.  Great recipe!!

I love coconut so I also put some flaked cocnut in the cake mix and used cocnut milk instead of cream. Awesome!!! We ate the leftovers out of the cakepan fighting for the last pieces. My mantra has always been "if you are going to eat something really fattening, make it really good" and this is!

This recipe is WONDERFUL...it's so similar to my mothers 'scratch' recipe.  I frequently divide the prepared batter in half for two (2) 8x8 square cakes and everything works out beautifully.  I encourage you to try this recipe.

I made this for Easter (2009) and it was FABULOUS! I am not a huge fan of coconut, but my husband and 2 (of 3) sons are, so I made this for them and even I enjoyed it quite a bit!  Since I wanted it to be pretty, I baked it in 2 8" round pans instead of the big one it called for.  I used the whipped cream in the middle and did the rest of the icing as directed.  It was maybe the prettiest cake I have ever made. The one change I did make was that I didn't know what "coconut cream" was and it was not with the canned milk at the store, as I expected, so I bought a package of coconut cream pudding, prepared it, and used it instead, with the canned milk, to infuse the cake.  It turned out amazing!  I did it on a rack over a pan with edges so I could get it off and do it again...  Maybe it turned out too thick, who knows, but eventually it all went in and was amazing!

Great cake!!  Super moist and not mushy like I thought it might turn out.  I think a butter cream icing might make it a little better as the whipped cream topping was a little tasteless.  I was also a little scared when I started trying to get the cake out of the pan after pouring the coconut/milk mixture on but it did eventually work itself out and without crumbling.

Absolutely AMAZING cake!  I made this cake for my mom's birthday and my whole family raved over it saying it was the best cake they have had!  I made a few changes:  I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract in the cake mix.  I also added fresh strawberries to my food processor and used the fruit spread in the middle of the cake with coconut.  I iced the cake with whipped cream and topped it with coconut and strawberries.  AMAZING!  Very easy cake to make with such a wonderful, moist, taste.

I followed the recipe exactly but after 30 minutes in the oven in the middle of the cake it was open a little bit and the raw cake mixture was inside still not cooked..I thought that was odd..so I put it in for another 20 minutes and it was fine and wasn't burnt. The cake does not look like anything special before you put the icing & coconut flakes on..When you get to put the whipped cream & flakes on it really looks good and I topped mine with slices of strawberry. It is a very easy cake to make and everything cost me under 20 dollars.

Absolutely Wonderful. Between my fiance and I we would have eaten the whole cake if we thought we could get away with it. This was a wonderful moist cake with sweet coconut flavor. The whip cream topping really lightened things up and helped tone down the sweetness. I did add fresh pineapple slices in the center and drizzled some pineapple juice on the bottom layer. This was so good. Thanks for this SUPERB recipe!

Loved it!  My family is not usually big on coconut - mostly because of the texture of flaked coconut - so I made the recipe as directed and just left off the flaked coconut.  Very moist and tasty!  I couldn't find anything called 'coconut cream' in my grocery store and thus used coconut milk.  It seemed to work fine.

Coconut cream? What is this? I went to 3 different grocery stores looking for this elusive product only to be met with blank stares when I asked grocery store employees if they had any. So...I used coconut milk instead and I think it turned out just fine. I baked in 2 round pans for about 23 minutes. This is a good cake, I did double the coconut extract in the cake for a stronger flavor and am glad I did. I also used Cool Whipped Frosting (from this website) with this cake, making it with home-made whipped cream with coconut extract and it was really good. I will serve this on Easter Sunday!

This is one of our new faves.  I made as directed, only used coconut milk instead of coconut cream, but only because I couldn't find coconut "cream" at the grocery store.  I'm not sure if there's a difference.  When I mixed the coconut milk with the sweetened condensed milk, it appeared a bit thin, so out of concern for having a soggy cake, I only used about 2/3 of the mixture.  I also used the cool whipped frosting recipe from this site.  My fiance and I managed to eat the whole cake in 3 days!  I'm working on the last piece right now :)

This turned out really nice.  I made it as a layer cake so I did not put all of the condensed milk/cream of coconut on because I was worried about stability but it turned out fine and I could have put the whole amount on.  I did use whip cream stabilizer.  Because we made it on Oscar night I sprinkled some edible glitter on the coconut which made it look fantastic. When making it again I will double the extract.   Despite all that I would definately make this again, it was super easy and everyone liked it.

Hello,   I made this cake for work and it was a smash!!!  I used 1 can of cream of coconut and 1 1/2 cans of sweetened condensed milk for a double cake recipe. It was a perfect amount.  This recipes would be good with hot fudge sauce and almonds.  An Almond Joy Cake!  YUM!!!

This cake is awesome!  I made it this past Christmas and everyone loved it.  This really is a no-fail recipe.  You won't be sorry you made it!  I didn't use nearly all of the cream and it was very moist for days.  Don't worry about making this a few days ahead of time.  It gets more and more delicious each day.  Thanks for a keeper!

I completely messed up the recipe & it was still FABULOUS!  (I accidentally poured the whipping cream INTO the cake, along with the cream and extract).  It was super moist, but a total nightmare to get out of the pan.

I followed the directions on the cake mix box and think that this would have looked as good as it tasted if I hadn't screwed up the recipe.

The frosting is yummy--I added extra coconut extract to it and topped it with flaked coconut.

Made this cake to take Christmas Eve to inlaws... they loved it.  Took the leftovers to my parents the next day... EVERYONE went crazy about it.  I think it would be wise to reduce the amount of liquid a bit though.  Great taste... just a bit too soggy.  I was worried about the whipping cream keeping shape so I took a can of whip cream and people added onto their serving it was great!

HEAVENLY! I was a little nervous about it being too moist as one reviewer said, but it was perfect! I made it as directed and let it sit in the fridge for two days before making the easy Whipped Cream from this site. I did double the whipped cream recipe and added a tad of coconut extract! FABULOUS! Will be making this again!

Great recipe!! I made mini-cupcakes for a Halloween party, so they looked like little angel clouds! I followed other reviewers advice and made the mini-cakes two days before and just kept them in the fridge, then I iced them in the morning before the party...Yummy! They were a huge hit! I lined mini muffin tins with liners, scooped about 2tbsp of batter and baked for 10min in the oven.... used a skewer to poke holes and poured the coconut cream over it, let them sit out for about 4 hours and then wrapped them up.... Make sure you use quick release tin foil or the tops of the muffins will stick and break off. I added coconut extract into the frosting, to give it a solid coconut flavor. 
This is a great go-to recipe that is not too overly sweet!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight. However, i have a question to anyone that has successfully made it. I followed the recipe step by step. I poured the coconut concoction over the cake, and let it fully cool. I decided to put it in the freezer, since i wont be assembling my cake until Fri. Now, im wondering where i went wrong. I tried to remove the cake from the pan, and it started to fall apart. (obviously because it was still "soaking") Should i have just put in the freezer pan and all.. and remove it once frozen? I was able to get it out of the pan somewhat intact.. and then just "glued" it back together. Using the moisture to my advantage. After all the rave reviews, im hoping to make it again... Could someone help clarify? 

Thank you

Very nice - I was afraid that adding all the sauce might have been too sweet.  I used all but a cup and next time I will use the entire amount.  The cake was delicious.

this cake was so freaking good!!!! i loved it and so did my whole family and friends! my mother in law who can't stand coconut gave it a chance and LOVED it!! this cake made her a fan :) there's only 2 things i did different. i doubled the heavy cream for more topping because i didn't think one cup was enough the first time. and because i couldn't find coconut cream, i used CREAM OF COCONUT instead. you can find it in the liquor section at your grocery store and it's thicker than coconut milk, and sweeter, but doesn't make the cake too sweet, even w/the condensed milk. and of course let it sink in before putting it in the fridge. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAKE!!!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and it was a hit. I had people asking me the recipe for it. I am not the type to try a recipe twice but I love it so much I am making the same cake for a special friend's birthday.

This cake is awesome.I can't find coconut cream anywhere,so I used coconut milk,and followed other reviewers advice about letting the cake cool before refrigerating.I iced it with whipping cream,which was good,but I may try a light frosting next time.This was a light delicious cake,not soggy at all.In fact I will be making this for my wedding cake!

I reduced the coconut creme and condensed milk by 1/3.The flavor was good but this was still much too sweet. Will try again though, maybe using 1/3 of each.

This cake is so moist and so good! I get asked for this recipe every time I make it. For the frosting I use heavy whipping cream whipped up and a small box of vanilla pudding mixed with 1 cup of milk and fold the two together. Yum!!

I pretty much followed the recipe.  I did however add a little extra coconut extract and toasted 1/2 the coconut.  I'm not sure if the coconut milk I found was exactly what the recipe called for, but it worked just fine.  I used milk, not cream...and I didn't add the entire can, probably about 2/3.  Everyone loved it.  I will make it again for sure!

I have made this recipe three times and my husband LOVES it! The first time I reduced the amount of sauce, fearing the coconut flavor would be overwhelming or the cake too moist, but that was not the case at all. Perfect!

Looked gorgeous - made it like in photo for my dd 11th birthday.  Made 2 days ahead and refrigerated.  Added coconut extract to cake mix and frosting.  I toasted the coconut for a little extra flavor.  The cake turned out very heavy, and barely any one was able to finish a piece.  We all loved the flavor, it looked beautiful, but it was too dense and heavy.

This cake is definitle moist. I think next time I would also make it with milk instead of water. And maybe cut back some on the coconut milk/sw cond milk combo. My cake turned out more like a trifle than a cake although the flavor was really good. I tinted the coconut pastel colors for Easter so it was really pretty.

First time I have ever made this cake. I made it just the way it was written. cake was very wet. Even tho there were no leftovers, I will make one change next time. (yes will make again) Less cream of cocnut mixture, about a third less. It was so rich, could only eat half of a slice. I could hear everyone moaning how good it tasted. (Almost) everyone said it was a little too wet. I made whipped cream and rum frosting. If it weren't for the wet texture, would have rated it 5 stars.

This turned out pretty good--not quite worth all the raving, though, I think. We topped ours with green-colored coconut, marshmallow peeps and jelly beans for Easter, so if nothing else, it looked cute!

Great cake.  Very moist and yummy.  We followed directions as listed but didn't use all the sauce, seemed like it would be too much.  Will make this again.

I made the cake twice.  The first time I made it, I went by the recipe and it was just mush with bad texture.  The second time I made without the Eagle brand condensed milk.  I only used the Coco Lopez coconut cream and it was perfect.  It tastes better if you make it 2 to 3 days in advance.

This was way to sweet for my taste but may try again with a few good suggestions that I have reviewed here.

Great recipe!!!And so easy!!! I simply frosted it with Cool Whip Lite a couple hours before serving, then topped with coconut and refrigerated until time to serve. Everyone loved it.

My husband made this for me for my birthday and it was by far the best coconut cake we've ever had.  It is a sweet cake, but so yummy and moist!  He used the cool whip topping.... absolutely perfect!

This was a fabulous tasting cake!  Super moist and scrumptious -- I will definitely make it many more times. Everyone loved it.  It's truly an award winning recipe.

I added coconut milk instead of vegetable oil and some of the water for even more coconut flavor.  And, like other users, I used the Cool Whipped Frosting recipe for frosting it, but used 1/2 box Instant Coconut Cream pudding and a whole container of cool whip (no milk), then let it sit in the fridge until it solidified, and then added coconut milk (and a splash of coconut cream) to get it to the right consistency.  Never enough coconut, right?  So f'ing good!!

This cake is fantastic!  I made it for Easter and took the leftovers to work where it was quickly gobbled up.  Everyone loved it nad asked for the recipe.  They couldn't believe it was a cake mix.  I couldn't find the coconut cream anywhere so I had to use coconut milk-just make sure to shake the can before opening if you use this because it separates.  I was about to throw it out thinking there was something wrong with it until I read the can.  Also, I added more coconut extract because I love the flavor.

I made this for a baby shower and was asked for the recipe by 6 different people!  Instead of topping with whipping cream, I topped with Cool Whip and toasted coconut.  Will make this again and again!

I am going to give this 4 stars due to the fact it was easy, and had a great coconut flavor.  Though the coconut sauce was just too sweet for my taste.  I think I will make the cake again and leave the sauce off.

Fantastic!  I thought the sauce amount was just right.  Poked holes evenly with chopsticks throughout the cake, and if you let it sit in the refrigerator for awhile, it soaks up nicely.  My kids could not get enough.  Thank you so much Gwen

Excellent cake - very moist. The longer it sits, the more moisture that soaks into the cake, it can become overladen if you wait to long to devour. :)

I took this cake to a work function and it was GONE in 15 minutes!!  Everyone wanted to know who made it.  I added more powdered sugar than the recipe called for to make the icing just a little sweeter and it was FABULOUS.  Making it for my husband for Father's Day.  YOU WILL NOT MISS WITH THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!
