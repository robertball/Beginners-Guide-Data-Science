Very good...but salty.  Will definitely make again but will eliminate the salt and will increase the cayenne pepper - then hopefully it will be 4 or even 5 stars.  Also I used Pillsbury crescent rolls instead of making the dough - I rolled it out, smoothed over the crescent lines then put the meat on and rolled up. I baked following the temp and time on the rolls.

Excellent recipe!  After looking at the other review I decided to add some mustard too.  My hubby loves grainy brown, so I spread some on the dough before putting the meat mix on.  We also sprinkled some mozzarella and cheddar cheese on the meat mix before rolling up the log.  We both agree that the dough is wonderful.  Held its shape well.  I used a older pan....but didn't grease it enough and the pinwheels stuck slightly, but still held their shape.  We are thinking this might be good with a beef/mushroom gravy type sauce to put over them.  I'm also toying with trying to make individual appetizer size wheels.  Thank you for a great Steeler Sunday meal.  Was in a half hour before kick off and we were eating mid way into the first quarter.

As suggested a added gourmet mustard, this was a very nice touch.  However, I did make an Au jou sauce for drenching or dipping.

Great flavor on the meat mixture for the recipe. I made it a little easier by using a prepared, refrigerated pizza dough roll. Worked perfect and much less messy than crescent rolls or from scratch. We also love the hint for the ground brown mustard. The mustard takes the flavor to the next level.

I'm from Pittsburgh, PA & it's a Family Favorite. 
I buy Crescent Rolls to save time. I add onions & mushrooms to the meat mixture. It's also served with grazy...Joni

Instead of using home made dough, I used store bought fillo dough- I pkg from the box. I browned ground beef and chopped onions, added a drained can of mushroom pieces. Laid out the fillo dough , covered it with ground beef mixture, rolled it up and placed on greased cookie sheet. Sprayed margarine over the dough and baked for 15-20 min until dough turned golden. While it was baking I prepared an envelope of brown gravy mix and added a can of cream of ckn soup( itâ€™s what I had on hand) and 1/2 can of water. When the roll was done I sliced it and put gravy on top. YUMMY! Husband LOVED IT!

Very very delicious! These pack well for lunch in an insulated lunchbox. These are also great for a quick snack. I just made these (again) and used ground stew beef instead of ground beef- the pinwheels are in the oven now- and I can't wait to see how they turn out. I find that pinching the edge of the log and rolling it (gently) before slicing it works to keep these pinwheel treats completely circular. Using a very sharp butcher knife helps too!
