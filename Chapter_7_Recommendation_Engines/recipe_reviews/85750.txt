Not the best chicken I have ever tasted.  You don't need to use 2 cans of beer.  One can is sufficient.  The herbs and spices float off the chicken while cooking so it mostly tastes like beer.  I would never make again.

Very juicy chicken, but not much flavor to it. Don't need so much beer. I probably won't make this again.

I prepared this recipe for a family gathering and everyone liked it, though my brother asked if I had any beer left over for drinking and my step-father said it was a waste of beer. It didn't have much of a beer flavor, which is good because I detest beer, but it gave it a mild yeasty flavor and it was moist and fell off the bone. I cooked it closer to two hours because I had two pounds of chicken and it was still slightly frozen.

I give this 4 stars but only because I tweak it. Puncture chicken and marinate chicken in beer, salt and pepper overnight in the refrigerator. Rub with rosemary, parseley thyme, and cloves, and a sprinkle of extra salt and pepper. Bake at 300 degrees for 2 hours.

I know there have been some jokes about this recipe but it WAS really good! It is a  little hard to get it browned b/c of the beer bath but if you put it under the broiler for a few mins, that should help brown it up. The flavor was very flavorful, I added salt and pepper along with some garlic powder. In fact, I am going to make it again tomorrow! Thanks Agnuspillsbury for a yummy way to make the bird.

although i question the validity of this womans profile and claims, i have to say that cooking chicken in beer is indeed very good if done correctly.  try using fresh sprigs of rosemary stuffed into the chicken.  then empty half of a can of beer and sit the chicken upright on the can...bake until falling off the bone delicious.  not a rosemary fan?  season the darn thing with anything you like....its a 100% everytime tender chicken!!

This recipe is somewhat similar to how my husband made our Thanksgiving turkey this past year, though it wasn't quite as good.  I would make it again, but I'm going to try some variations.  I think one problem one of the reviewers had was that they poured the beer OVER the chicken instead of beside the chicken, to keep the spices on the chicken.  I added oregano to mine, which was tasty.  Next time I might try more salt & pepper on the whole pieces of chicken instead of just on the top.

I tried this once already and am making it tonight for dinner again!  YUMMY is all I have to say.  My husband loves it.  The rosemary REALLY gives the chicken a unique taste and the beer well, it made the chicken so tender.

This was a good idea. You definitely don't need two cans/bottles of beer. I only used about 2/3 of a 12oz bottle of Killian's Irish Red. I added probably about 2 tbsp of Worcestershire to the beer. I rubbed 4 large boneless chicken breasts with rubbed sage and garlic salt and baked @ 375 for about 10 mins (chicken was half frozen) then flipped chicken and added beer "sauce". Very tender and pretty good taste overall. Next time I will use more Worcestershire and stronger seasoning! I only give 2 stars for the idea itself.

Here's how you do it.  Get 8 drumsticks, lightly season them with McCormick's Montreal Chicken.  Place in a baking dish that will hold the 8 drumsticks.  I used 11 3/4 x 7 3/4.  Pour beer (not onto the chicken) around the chicken. To half way cover the chicken.
Cook 1 hour at 350 degrees preheated oven. Yummy and cheap!!

I gave this five stars because it's beyond easy. I did spice it up a bit. I had a plethora of rosemary, sage and oregano in my garden so I minced it up in my food processor. I used 5 chicken drumsticks and 3/4 can beer. I put chicken in glass dish, added beer, then sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic then the fresh herb mix. Also put the herbs in the beer. Baked for one hour. It was so good. It browned up nicely in my convection oven. I will make again.
