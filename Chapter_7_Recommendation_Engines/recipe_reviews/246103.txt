I agree with the first 2 reviews. I would next time keep the pasta separate and just top it with the sauce; and possibly less cheese. Other than that, I used garlic from a jar and canned spinach so this was a quick and super easy meal with great flavor. It also contains some nutritional items, which is not always easy to get a 2 year old to eat, but everyone loved it.

I liked this especially the angel hair pasta which I rarely serve. The flavours all work and everyone ate it including a three year old. The only thing is I didn't necessarily like is the amount of cheese that turned into clumps of cheese and pasta. Next time I might make a cheese sauce instead.

This recipe is delicious and simple to make.  I would suggest keeping the paste separate as it doesn't mix well in the skilled. Just put it on the plate, then top with the rest of the ingredients.  Otherwise, enjoy. So  good! One I will make again, for sure.

This was so easy to make--great for a busy weeknight meal. Tasty, pretty, and filling. I made no changes except for adding a bit of the pasta water to the skillet with the shrimp and cheeses. The blend of Italian cheeses was yummy.

I didn’t have cream and didn’t use the cup of cheese. Only put parmesan on top. I like mushrooms, so I added canned mushrooms to avoid adding too much more liquid. The meal still turned out great. I’ll make this again.

I used some colby jack cheese instead of the Italian 4-cheese blend because that's all I had. I also used shredded parmesean. I used whole wheat angel hair pasta for my kids and zoodles for my husband and I (low carb). It turned out fabulously delicious! My kids loved it and so did we. Will definitely make it again - it's so quick and easy too!

I had crisped up some bacon this morning so I used that instead of shrimp and I left out the cheese. It was still great!!!

I am going to have to play around with the recipe a little following the steps it was not as creamy as i would have liked but it was good.  I also added some cajun seasoning to this recipe it was a little bland for my taste.  but over all a good base to start with.  may add a little onion

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because we loved it. Just a few simple steps gives you a really special dish. I will say that I would have preferred it to be saucier. I don't know if it's because the liquid in the 398ml can of diced tomatoes I used was more pulpy than watery, or if I cooked it down longer than I should have after adding the cream. Either way, next time I will stop adding pasta when it has the consistency I like. I don't use angel hair pasta often, but I don't know why because it's so delicate, and I loved the texture. To make a pretty presentation, I transferred the mixture to a platter before topping with the cheese and then placed it in the oven to let it melt. Next time I might double the cheese, because the bites that were heavy on the cheese were my favourites!

It was okay, not the best that I've had. Because there were no spices added it was very bland. I doctored it up a bit and it was much better. Will not be making this again.

I didn't have all the ingredients, so a made a couple of substitutions.  I have to say it has won a regular place in the rotation of meals that I make.  Quick, easy and delicious, does it get any better than that??

I used this recipe for a framework. I knew my family would want a few changes. -- There are 6 of us, all adults. I doubled the quantities as posted (but I tripled the pasta to 1 1/2 pound - I could have used 2 pounds!)  and added 1/3 c. green onions, 1 1/2 tsp. dried basil, 3/4 tsp. lemon pepper (mostly zest), 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, & omitted the cheese blend. I put in these additions after the spinach and before the shrimp, simmering for 2 or 3 minutes then continued. Everyone added more Parmesan and/or red pepper flakes if they wanted. 4 very hungry men, another average hungry guy and a mom ate their fill (as a one dish meal, no extras) and there was still left overs. I think this doubled recipe could easily feed 8 if a side salad and bread where included. It is company worthy but quick and easy to throw together with pantry and fridge/freezer staples.

Used a 5 oz. box of fresh spinach. Seemed about right but Alexa said that 8 cups of spinach is a little more than 8 oz.! Couldn't find CB cheese so used 4 cheese italian mix but it was very stringy.  Used a 15 oz. can of diced toms (had to look that up too!). Very tasty.

Used vermicelli instead of angel hair, and only grated parmesan, so didn't have probs w clumping cheese.  Still turned out great. It's a super easy weeknight recipe and great way to use up a large bag of spinach!

I followed others suggestions and made the sauce with cream and cheeses separate and then added to the shrimp.  The results were a creamy, smooth sauce.

This is great and easy. To the ones that had clumpy cheese—make sure you get a thin shredded blend and don’t mix in until the sauce has stopped simmering or even longer. Warm the cheese gently or it will clump.

I only had a 12oz. Bag of shrimp, so I made 3/4 of the recipe. There’s just the two of us, so it worked out fine.  I made the full amount of sauce, though, and I can’t imagine it with less. I also kept the sauce separate and I liked it that way, better for storing leftovers. It was delicious, easy and quick. Will definitely make again!

Made for Riley's birthday. Used fresh mushrooms in place of spinach and added smoked sausage for non seafood people. We all enjoyed it. Also made with chicken thigh strips and bacon.

Way too bland. Needs more herbs. And adding some more veggies to give it more variety, texture?

I will definitely make it again. I had to change few things though: I used spaghetti instead of angel hair. Added broccoli and red peppers instead of spinach because that's what I had on hand. And I only sprinkled the dish with a quarter cup of cheese (it even tastes good without cheese, so that really makes it optional). Very delish. Thanks for sharing this recipe

The sauce was not creamy enough and it tasted kind of bland. Salt and pepper flakes brought it to life.

Everyone in my family loved this dish! My can of tomatoes was slightly bigger and used it all. Also I ran out of cream and only ended up using 1/3 cup.Regardless it tasted delicious. I ended up stiring my cheeses all throughout to make it more creamy due to the lack of cream. Took the suggestion in the footnotes and added the red pepper flakes as we like a little kick. Garnished my plate with lemon zest and fresh cracked black pepper

Easy tastes recipe! Husband loved it and he's not a pasta man. Substitutions: green onions for spinach. Whole milk and a bit of cornstarch for cream.

So good that I warmed up leftovers for breakfast. I didn't change a thing.

I made this dish for dinner tonight and it exceeded our expectations for sure. The dish was flavourful and very easy/quick to prepare. Next time I made it, I would season the shrimp with salt and pepper, uses fire roasted tomatoes and probably a more sturdy pasta (spaghetti or spaghettini).

You just have to keep a recipe that presents, as this does, in 20 mins.  My family devoured, there were no left overs.
I followed the recipe as is.   Next time I will spice it up at bit with some chilies and fresh herbs.  Cheese combo was perfect.    I love simple cooking like this!

As part of the Allrecipes Allstars, I had the task to make a recipe with CrackerBarrel Shreds .
This was excellent , a nice sauce that both the husband and I liked.. I am not a big fan of leaving tails on shrimp in recipes like this, so I admit, yes I pulled them off first.
I was very impressed on how the CrackerBarrel shreds melted into the sauce to make it rich and cheesy
