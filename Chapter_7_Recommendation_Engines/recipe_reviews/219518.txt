Cooking in college can be difficult on account of time/money, so this recipe was just too easy to pass up. My friends absolutely loved it! I added an extra clove of garlic and used a full tsp of Italian seasoning. I only had cream cheese, but it still tasted great! I'll be making this again soon!

SUPER EASY! I wanted to make something easy with some ground beef and this was it! I didn't have bow tie pasta so I used shells, used cream cheese like the others, and I used frozen onion (because I didn't feel like chopping an onion ;) ). It still turned out great! I toasted some bread to eat along with it too. Next time I'll probably use an actual onion though. Again, great recipe definitely a keeper!

My family loved this! I made it exactly as directed and even my 3 and 6 year old boys gobbled it up. I'm so happy to have found a new yummy, EASY recipe for those I-don't-feel-like-cooking nights!

*Definitely use MILD Picante Sauce if you'll be serving it to kids!

I did not care for this recipe. Tangy and strange. Also looks unappealing. I did not write that and do not appreciate having my original review shortened to just a few words. I did not use the word "unappealing" in my original review. If you thought it (the review) was inappropriate in some way, you shouldn't have included it at all. You should have sent an email with a request to change it if I still wanted to submit it. What's the point of submitting a review if it's going to be changed by you, allrecipes.com? Why don't you just write your own reviews and pretend they're written by users? That's exactly what you did!

I followed the recipe but used what I had on hand which was a can of Rotel instead of salsa and Philadelphia Cooking Creme Roasted Garlic flavor instead of the regular cream cheese.  I halved the recipe using 1/2 pound of ground beef.  It was good and a quick lunch.  Thanks!

Very easy and always a big hit. I have made it according to the recipe, but have also used ground turkey and substituted spaghetti sauce for the picante. The dish is freezer friendly as well.

My husband loved this, and so did I. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used regular cream cheese, as my husband hates low fat anything. It was quick, easy, and delicious!
