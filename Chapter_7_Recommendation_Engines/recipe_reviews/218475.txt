Fabulous spin on classic garlic bread! However, I must say this is WAY too heavy on the herbs and spices which if made exactly as the recipe states basically ruins the whole thing....and that would be a shame because the concept is wonderful and this really IS good! I kept the amount of butter the same and cut everything in HALF! Just by looking at the amounts you could tell it was overkill. I chose to use minced garlic instead of garlic powder and since I didn't have onion salt I used a mix of onion powder with a little salt.  I couldn't find sliced blue cheese so I got crumbled and opted to use sourdough bread which proved to be a winning combination. I think no matter what type of hearty bread you have on hand this is going to be great (especially if you happen to be a fan of blue cheese). This was a great accompaniment to grilled steak and a fresh tossed salad!

YUMMY, EXCELLENT BREAD!!!! I actually had a smaller French baguette, so I did halve all of the spices (using Penzy's 'Spanish Cracked' rosemary, onion powder, as I didn't have onion salt, and adding a dash of salt), but kept the butter as is. Of course the grocery store didn't have sliced blue cheese now that I needed it, lol, so I used crumbled. That worked out great, IMO! This bread really had a great herbacious, cheesy flavor. I served this w/ pasta tonight, but could totally see serving this with a nice steak dinner or hearty stew. I will definately be making this very often! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used a different bread (of necessity) and less spread on each piece (and no onion salt) but oh my goodness, if you like blue cheese, you need to try this. Something magical happens when blue cheese is broiled apparently -- so good! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I had to do as others suggested and cut the seasoning in half.  I put blue cheese only on a couple of pieces, as I am the only one in our clan that likes it.  I preferred the pieces without blue cheese over the ones with it, but I do not believe I would have liked it at all had I used the full amount of seasoning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Mrs. Falvo!
