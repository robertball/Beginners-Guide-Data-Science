Very good pie!  I used 2 cups of gooseberries because that was what I had, and let's face it, what was I going to do with extra gooseberries?  So it was a little more tart than it would have otherwise been, but it was perfect for us.  Does anyone know why the berries in the picture are purple?  All the gooseberries I've ever seen  have been green.

My first home grown gooseberry pie, and it was great. I upped the berries to 2 cups. If you like the tartness and your berries are on the ripe side, I recommend upping the berries to more like 2 1/2 cups, and use a a full size 9 inch pan. Also you might crush about one cup of them before sugaring to keep so many from floating on top of the sour cream..mmm mmm good!

My wife and I made this pie last night and was able to sample it today.  Fantastic!!  As recommended by another member, we upped the amount of gooseberries to 2 cups, and the sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  We have the pink variety of gooseberry purchased from one of the catalogs and when ripe, they have a nice sweet/tart flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I must admit, I was quite skeptical when I prepared the sour cream filling and it was quite runny. However, everything solidified beautifully and it was quite tasty - I have quite the sweet tooth, so it's perfect for me, but if you're not a big fan of sugar then I would suggest lessening the amount of sugar by a bit. Also, I found that it needs many more gooseberries (I upped it to 1 1/2 cups and it still wasn't enough)

I made this recipe yesterday for my family and it was a huge hit!  One person even said it was the best use of gooseberries they'd ever seen.  I used 2 cups of gooseberries and added a little under 1/4 C extra sugar to account for that.  I also used a pate brisee recipe from Martha Stewart for the crust, and I used low-fat sour cream in the filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

What a winner this recipe is.  Will go into the 'again and again' box.  This is the first year the gooseberry bushes have produced in abundance and all the neighbours have their share and also this recipe so the place is awash with gooseberry pies.   Thanks for posting it.

If you like a tart pie, this is a good gooseberry pie. I used two cups of berries, but that wasn't enough. I might mash some of them to better distribute the tartness and use a little less sour cream. Anyway, this pie was pretty tasty but you have to like a very tart pie!

I made the pie following the recipe exactly (except for a pinch of nutmeg in the filling). I had never made anything using gooseberries before. My significant other (who is also a professionally trained chef) said it was delicious and perfect. Too good to share with his best friend - who I usually share my baked goods with. Thanks for the terrific recipe.

I added an extra 1/2 c. of gooseberries for more flavor.  This is a great pie and the sour cream mixture keeps it from being so tart!

I agree with the other reviewers who suggest using 2C of gooseberries and lessening the sugar to about 3/4C.  With that slight alteration, this is as delicious a tart pie as you'll ever eat!  I made two of them this summer and they were both gone in a flash. :)

Pretty good. I got some gooseberries at the farmers market and decided to try this. My husband finished it off.

This was fun to make.  The recipe itself is easy, but depending on the gooseberries the prep time can be very long...removing all the blossom ends from those tiny little berries was tedious. I used wild Colorado gooseberries which were very small.  This recipe would be better with larger gooseberries like I used to see for sale in Midwest grocery stores.  My gooseberries were neither sweet nor tart (kind of bland) and I thought the sugar level was about right.  I'd never had a sour cream pie before, and this was very good.

Great recipe! This is the 1st year that my gooseberry bush produced and it was barely 1-1/4 cups.  I changed this:  I mixed the berries, sugar and a couple teaspoons of water in a pan and simmered for a few minutes, cooled for a bit, and then mixed with the sour cream mixture.  I used a store bought graham cracker crust and baked for 55 minutes as the recipe directed.  It wasn't as pretty as a doublecrust but after it was chilled, the flavor was awesome!

What a great pie! The sour cream gives the pie a custard taste that goes well with the tart gooseberries. Ripe gooseberries are purple and make a beautiful pie. It is hard to get the ripe berries before the birds, but so worth the effort of picking and stemming.

I thought that this would be great, based on the other reviews, but this pie was not good. The gooseberry flavor did NOT mesh with the sour cream mixture AT ALL. I would say blueberries or raspberries would be way better. Perhaps this is because I had green gooseberries, and the pictures indicate that other users used red(?) gooseberries.

This was great! I made it yesterday and everyone loved it. It's just about gone! The pie has a nice tart, but strangely aromatic taste. It's something I've never tasted before and I loved it. I threw a little allspice in there too and I used local eggs and the yolk is so much more yellow, and it gave the pie a kind of bright custard look. I'm definitely going to make this again with every gooseberry harvest!! I attached a picture if you want to see what it looked like!

This was a good pie but the sour cream just didn't seem right in it.  I'm sure it's excellent for those who are used to sour cream pies but this just wasn't the pie for me.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of berries like other reviewers had suggested and crushed about 1/2 of the berries before adding the sugar.  I think this helped mix the flavors together but overall I wasn't a big fan of the sour cream.

Excellent pie, but remember to glaze it.  I had never made a pie before and this came out wonderful, albeit a bit pale from not glazing the crust. I made it using the recipe called "Pastry for Double-Crust Pie"
Tart, sweet, tangy and creamy all in one.  Nice, flaky crust.

This recipe is much better than the traditional gooseberry pie recipe because the gooseberries are not overpowering, but they definitely have a presence.  I'm sure it's good if you follow the recipe exactly.  However, I followed others' advice and increased the berries to 2 cups, mashing half, and increased the sugar by another quarter cup.  I've made it that way three different times and everyone has raved about it.  I think the next time I make this recipe I will try adding cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice.

Wow.  So good!!  I admit I thought it sounded terrible but it had good reviews and I had my first big crop of berries on my gooseberry bush....so I gave it a shot.  So glad I did.  My first gooseberry pie but it won't be my last!!  I followed the recipe except I used 2 cups of fresh berries as others did.

Excellent.  I had a quart of gooseberries and doubled the recipe and it worked out great.  I added a little nutmeg to the sour cream and I liked the addition.  Also, this pie really does need to be a double crust pie, because it is one UGLY pie without a top crust.

I tried this recipe last summer with my home-grown gooseberries that were nice and ripe and purple. I put 2.5 cups of berries and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. It was one of the most delicious pies I've ever tasted. A hit at a family barbecue and not a crumb left. If you have the time, a home-made crust makes a world of difference.

Oh my gosh....the best pie EVER! Just gotta find a way to get gooseberries more often! ...and I don't even LIKE gooseberries! It was extremely easy to make and presents a pretty pie. I have made quite a few pies in my life...but this one takes the cake. :)

I wasn't as impressed with this as I had hoped.  With the tart berries, I don't think sour cream was the best pairing - made it too bitter, in my opinion.  And the texture of the filling wasn't that great.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't gross, I just didn't like it as much as I had hoped to.

I love gooseberry pie.  My mom had looked for gooseberry pre-made pie filling for a year before her death.  So I made this pie to please my father and of course myself.  I was a little afraid of the Sour Cream, but it was GREAT.  
Go ahead and try it, you will be rewarded with great taste

My gooseberries were hard and green. So I put a little water over them and cooked tHem a little (brought them to a boil them shut them off.) I drained the water off and let them cool. Then I made the pie according to the directions. It was good. I did add a little cinnamon too.

This pie was awesome! I did follow the advice of others to add more gooseberries.  I used 3 cups of gooseberries and would have added one more cup if it would have fit in my dish.  3 cups was perfect. I didn't change anything else with the filling. except for taking the advice of shaking some cinnamon over the filling and then some cinnamon sugar over the top pastry.  The pie set up beautifully, which I was excited about since I don't usually have luck with that.

Very good! I used 2 cups of ripe gooseberries, but I could have done 2.5 or 3 cups I think. I also used a little less than a full cup of sugar. I will definitely make it again.

Recipe was tasty, but definitely not worth the time spent on preparing the 1-1/2 C of gooseberries that were in my CSA.

I thought it was an excellent, mildly sour fruit pie, but my husband disagreed. I'll make it for parties in the future so I don't have to eat the whole pie myself.

This was very good, but I, too upped the gooseberries to 2-3 cups.  I liked the tart taste, but you may want to add more sugar if you increase the gooseberries.

Excellent balance of sweet and tart.  The texture was nice as well, not too gooey and not too dry.  I agree with the other reviewers about adding more gooseberries to taste.

I love making pies, and this was a great way to use my gooseberries. I took one to my mom, who said it was the best pie she'd ever tasted! I will cook a bit longer next time, though - we're at 4500 ft., so I should have made that allowance anyway.
