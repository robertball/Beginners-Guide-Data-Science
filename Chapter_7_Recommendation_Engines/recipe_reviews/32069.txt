I was looking for a quick, easy recipe for goose breast when I found this. I give it high marks for quick and easy, however the vinegar taste tends to overpower everything else.  The sauce, while very good, was much too bland for our taste, needs to be spiced up to wake up the flavor of the goose.
A really nice dish, just not very exciting.

My husband hunts so we cook quite a bit of goose and I'm always looking for new recipes. This one is nice however I'd highly recommend using balsamic vinagar instead of the red wine vinegar that the recipe calls for...balsamic takes out the "gamey" taste from the goose. I'll make this recipe again.

Never having had goose breast before I decided to use your recipe. I was very unhappy with the result ie the breasts were not cooked and my Christmas dinner was ruined.  The sauce proved to be very nice on its own with the rice.  My question is that if it takes 2 hours to cook a duck, then 35 minutes suggested by you is nowhere near enough time for cooking.

My family really liked this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of sugar to help tone down the vinegar taste.

The vinegar was too overpowering, but the sauce was tasty.

this was very tasty, I used snow goose for the recipe which can be quite tough, but this turned out tender and juicy. The red wine enhanced the flavour of the goose and the wild taste was very dominant, which is what we prefer. The sauce was light and did not overpower the taste. Very good recipe, thanks I will make it again.
