This was really easy to make and tasted good. We made it exactly as written and would definitely make again.

Pretty good. Use less lemon juice! I added some salt, oregano and Za'atar to the couscous mixture because I used water instead of vegetable broth.

I loved this recipe. I did add dried oregano (about 1/2 tsp.)I also used low sodium chicken free broth instead of vegetable broth. I made it a second time using the Mediterranean Chickpea patties. That worked out great as well

I thought the dish was OK.  The couscous and vegetable part was good, and the amount of lemon was just fine as written.  However, I wasn't sure the cheese and grillers fit with it.  I think I'd make it again as a side dish without the grillers and cheese.
