This is a very tasty French dressing.  Like the other reviewer said, it is too much sugar for most palates.  You could start with 2 tbl and move up to 1/4 cup  if you want it sweeter.  You can add rice flour or cornstarch and it will be creamier and pourable.  If you make it in a blender, it stays homogenized and will not separate for a fairly long time.  (the mustard is an emulsifier)
Onion powder, garlic powder and dry mustard can be substituted and seem to make the dressing  more stable.
This is very close to the famous "Dorothy Lynch" dressing in Nebraska and Iowa which also has celery seeds.

As written maybe just a tad too sweet for me. I recommend starting with 1/4 cup of sugar and add if needed. I'm not really sure what onion juice is so I just chopped a teaspoon of onion and added it along with the "juice" that came with it.  I liked it.  I will make again with less sugar.

I'm partial to tomato based dressings and this one didn't fail me. I followed the recipe but I had to make two substitutions. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic paste. Also I live in a small town and could not find onion juice so I used a teaspoon of onion powder. I'm not sure if onion juice is made any more. Anyway the dressing was tasty except next time I think I'll use less sugar. I was a little sweet. Overall I liked the dressing.
