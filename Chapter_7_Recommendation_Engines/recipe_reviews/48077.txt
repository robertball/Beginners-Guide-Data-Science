This recipe made a pretty simple meal.  The most important thing is to get a really good caesar dressing, because that is where all the flavor comes from.  I used a caesar that was kind of watery, but I think this would be delicious with something a little creamier.

My family prefers the rice and dressing seperate.  Dipping the wrap in the dressing is an easy way for everyone to get their desired amount.

VERY yummy and so easy and quick to make! We actually used a Ceaser Italian dressing which added a little kick to these and it was great! I'll definantly be making these again.
