I used Kalamata olives in place of green olives.  I used mint and basil in place of dill.  The salad was a huge hit.  There were no leftovers.

Too zingy.  Less vinegar next time, but I did enjoy all the vegetables

Left out peppers because I just don't care for them much. At first I didn't add as much dill as recommended thinking it would overpower but once I tasted it, I added more. This is a delicious and filling salad - ate the whole thing myself over two days. Am looking forward to bringing it to a pot luck to share with others.

Had to substitute red grapes for olives as I didn't have any in hand. Turned out great! Can't wait to make it with the olives! I added walnuts just cuz I had them and that was tasty too. Definitely will make again!

Thought this was a great use of summer veggies!  We get a weekly CSA and I think lots of different veggies would work with this.  Very yummy!

I've made this recipe several times and love the briny flavor the jar of olives gives this dish. The second and following times I made this I omitted the tomatoes ONLY because I knew I was going to add additional veggies daily and keep this marinating as long as possible (gets better every day) and didn't think the tomatoes would hold up for a week. I did put kalamata olives in the second time, which was ok, but it didn't wow me until I put the pimento stuffed green in (secret ingredient!). Feta takes it over the top. Thank you for sharing Chef Bevski.

I thought this was a 4, my husband thought 5, and my daughter 3, so this is the average. I think it could have benefitted from something sweet, like golden raisins. There is a lot of chopping involved, and portion sizes are large. I think of it as more akin to coleslaw than to  greek salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a surprising hit w/finicky eaters!  I made this for an impromptu casual dinner party and everyone really enjoyed it, including me.  I doubled the recipe and didn't measure the veggies.  I chose to leave out the olives and increased the vinegar and decreased the oil a bit for personal preference.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used a few tablespoons of dried.  This will be a go to whenever I have extra veggies to use or lose.  THANKS for the recipe!
