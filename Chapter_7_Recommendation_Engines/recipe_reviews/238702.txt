While good, it really wasn't that close to Lawry's seasoned salt. From what I have found online, celery salt  is a key ingredient in Lawry's so I added 1/8 of a teaspoon, which helped. I've seen some recipes that call for more celery salt & less table salt though.

Made this tonight when a friend was out of Lawry's seasoned salt. She was out of turmeric so we did not include it. The blend was a bit salty but worked perfectly!

I stopped buying seasoned salt.  Absolutely love this.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand anyways, mix it up and put it in an old seasoned salt container and the family can't tell the difference!

Close but not quite Lawry's.  Definitely needs celery flavoring. Seemed a little too salty, so had to add more of the other seasonings.  Will try again and maybe cut the salt by teaspoonfuls - can always add more if necessary!

Not quite Lawry’s but delicious! I also tried a batch with smoked paprika and it added a really wonderful flavor.  This is my go to from now on!

Never bought Lawry seasoning salt before but I was making a recipe which called for seasoning salt. I was surprised at the list of spices as I chuckled to myself because I really just thought seasoning salt was salt before I googled it:) Glad I made this my recipe came out great a tad bit to salty but that can easily be adjusted. I did cut the sugar in half as I’m trying to watch. Typically I make all of my own seasoning from scratch due to food allergies and this will now be on my list. Thank you for the recipe!

Was easy and I just added a bit more garlic and didn't have to deal with not having enough in the store brand mix! Made my prim rib stand out ! :)

For a copycat, it really isn't bad. I drench everything in Lawry's so it's nice to know how to make a generic brand lol

Made this as an ingredient for a separate recipe. They both turned out amazing, so I made enough to fill our empty salt shaker.
