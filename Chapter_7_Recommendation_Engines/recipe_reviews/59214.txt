I only used 1 tsp of instant coffee and used real butter instead of shortening.  Mine baked perfect in 35 minutes in my oven.  My kids thought this was a great recipe.  Next time I will add blueberries to the mix!    Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've done it now with blueberries and that is a nice addition!  Still only 35 minutes to done.

It smelled great while it was in the oven, but the bottom 2/3 never bakes. I baked it for 2 hrs, & the bottom 2/3 was still raw dough.

I love coffee so this recipe spoke to me. Sadly, the coffee actually overpowered any praline flavor and made it a tad bitter so I wish I would have omitted the coffee powder altogether. I also think you could double the sugar in the batter to sweeten it up a bit. I used a 9 inch square pan (I don't own a 10 inch) so I had to bake it for about 15 extra minutes. It turned out fine but the overwhelming coffee flavor wasn't our cup of tea :) Thanks so much for sharing.
