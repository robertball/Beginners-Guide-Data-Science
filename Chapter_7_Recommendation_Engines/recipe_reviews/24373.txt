The first time I made it I did it to the letter and it was pretty good.  The second and third times I left off the bananas (my friend didn't like them) and I substituted white peaches.  It was a HUGE hit.  I've made it several times and I never have any leftovers.  I use non-fat yogurt and I haven't had any problems with it.  YUMMM  Thank you for a tasty treat!

Try adding whipped cream (like Cool Whip) to the mixture. I had to make two batches to feed my family they loved it so much! It makes the mixture lighter and a little sweeter. You could even use the low fat whipped creams just fine. For every scoop of yogert, one scoop of whipped cream. DREAMY!

This is my new, favorite recipe. Absolutely simple but delicious. I used a few Tbsp. of strawberry cool whip to mix with the yogurt and put out granola too. Everyone loved it. Even my husband, who typically wouldn't touch fruit salad, when back for seconds. Great recipe...thank you.

I make this almost every morning for my kids. The kind of fruit and yogurt always varies. My kids favor this mix called for in this recipe the best. I like a little homemade granola sprinkled on top. EDITED: This can be made lighter with either Yoplait Light strawberry yogurt or nonfat greek yogurt. The leftovers make an excellent smoothie, if you add just a little fruit juice.

I used strawberries, red grapes & fresh pineapple &vanilla yogurt. I layered it in a trifle dish. yogurt then the fruit then yogurt. I added sliced bananas (that I soaked in acidic water first to keep from browning) to the top right before serving!

I made this for a small dinner party, and was expecting for there to be extras for lunch the next day.  Tasted great when serving, but leftovers were disappointing...the bananas didn't make it through the night, and the yogurt separated and became runny.

Great fruit salad. My father-in-law is on a strict diet and this was the perfect fruit salad.  Low sodium, low fat and really delicious. I used red and green grapes, bananas, strawberries and non-fat strawberry yogurt.  Everyone liked it!

I make this salad all of the time - mainly because it is so easy and tastes sooooo good.  You can use any combination of fruit - I generally go with whatever is on sale.  Like others, I add some Cool Whip and throw some granola on just before serving.  Yummy.  Thanks!

Delicious! I could eat this everyday for breakfast, and usually do - I never have green grapes so I use red grapes.  I sometimes add kiwi or pineapple for a change and sprinkle some wheat germ on top.

Perfect for the preschool potluck.  I added colorful mini marshmallows and it was a hit among the 4-year olds.

I make something similar to this, except I use Pina Colada yogurt and pineapple chunks, apple slices, strawberries, and grapes.  I think the Pina Colada gives it a nice tart flavor.

Really nice fruit combination, but I personally preferred them with vanilla yogurt - I thought the strawberry yogurt tasted weird and artifical with the fresh strawberries. Thanks.

Could life get any simplier? The best part it's so simple you can add to it. Throw in a dash of lemon/orange peel. Garnish with whipped topping or white chocolate shavings. Switch the strawberry flavors out for cherries. Have fun with it!

This recipe was easy and tasty.  But like other reviewers said, the bananas get mushy and the yogurt becomes runny, so only make enough to eat in one night.

Delicious and simple! I used apples instead of bananas and cut all the fruit the night before. Then the morning of the brunch I stirred in the yogurt. Delicious, especially with granola!

I made this (well almost) to go with dinner. I ended up getting grapes that were molded fromt he store, and my poor bananas had already turned to mush.  It was still VERY good with only the Strawberries and Strawberry Yogurt.  Very easy and very delicious!

With a young husband with high colestrol, I am always trying to make things that are healthy, but different. And this one definately scored in our house. We had it as a side with a chicken dish. I got up this morning and was eager to eat some for breakfast, and it was GONE! My hubby ate the REST OF IT for breakfast! I will definately have to make this again. I added red grapes as well, since I already had some.

This is really good.  You can use about any fruit and any flavor of yogart.  It's funny how people who won't eat yogart will eat this fruit salad.  I always feel guilty when they ask what the good stuff on the fruit is.  I sometimes add a little cool whip as was suggested, but I think it's good with or without it.

This salad is perfect for my new son-in-law who has diabetes.  I let people add their own cut up bananas.  That way they don't get brown or mushy if the salad isn't all eaten up the same day.

This is an excellent fruit salad to make as a side dish for dinner. It was very sweet and refreshing. My husband and I love that it is healthy too. We couldn't find fresh strawberries at our local store(considering it's January), but I used 16 oz. of frozen strawberries in its place. I let the frozen strawberries defrost about half way. This was an excellent fruit salad. You can do so many variations to it and it would still be delicious. We will be making this one again!

So quick and easy with delicious results!  I substituted blueberries for the grapes and it was beautiful, light and tasty.  I wasn't sure that 8 ounces of yogurt would hold it together well enough, but it was perfect.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

This is very easy and tastes pretty good.  It's nothing overly special, but we like it.  One thing to keep in mind is that the bananas get soggy after more than 1 day, so it doesn't keep well as leftovers.

I followed a previous reviewer and used strawberries, grapes, canned pineapple, and cut up apple with pina colada yogurt.  Served it for breakfast with cranberry bread (Ocean Spray recipe with craisins) and sausage balls (Jimmy Dean recipe except just used Bisquick, sausage and cheddar cheese).  Yummmy!

Great recipe!  I highly recommend the lemon yogurt, and you can put in almost any fruit that is handy.  Great idea!

I added cool whip as someone suggested in equal amounts with yogurt.  The cool whip may have acted as a stabilizer because mine did not separate or get runny.  I waited to add the bananas and cool whip/yogurt blend until right before my event.  Very good.

I make this for almost every summer party I throw.  It's the easiest fruit salad ever.  I made it using strawberry yogurt, and I've also added in Cool Whip as another reviewer suggested.  All versions end up great.  However, my latest version used 1 container lemon Yoplait yogurt, and I like this combination the best.  I always cut up the strawberries and grapes beforehand, and add the sliced banana and yogurt just before serving.  I just made this for my son's 3rd birthday party, there were about 12 people there and it was a good amount as a side dish.  Last summer I made it for my daughter's baptism.  We had about 30 people and I doubled the recipe and it was a good amount.  I always get tons of compliments with this!

Used 1/2 pint strawberries chopped, 2 bannanas, 1/2 cup each of red and green grapes (quartered) and added 6 oz stawberry yougart and probably 1/2 tub of light cool whip.  Delish, and it dissapeared quickly!  Like dessert!  Want to try w/ granola for breakfast!

I was surprised someone submitted this as a recipe. This has been my favorite for many, many lunches, etc. for 20 years. I guess I just thought everyone knew about this great mix. I also top with any kind of crunchy cereal/granola for a little extra crunch.

When the recipe says to serve immediately, you should listen! Mine was fine for a cookout but turned very liquidy and mushy just a couple hours later. The juices from the fruit and the yogurt combine in the bottom to make a pink soupy mess. But, it still tastes pretty good.

I loved the idea of this recipe, but it just didn't taste sweet enough to me. I have decided that it must have been my strawberries, I don't think they were as sweet as strawberries can be. If you find youself in that situation, I would suggest adding some sugar to your strawberries before throwing them into the pot. Otherwise this was a quick easy fruit salad.

This is a GREAT fruit salad! I make this all the time for dessert & my kids just love it. I just use whatever fruit I have available but our favorites are blackberries, strawberries & nectarines. Just chop into large bite sized pieces & add some yogurt & you're done. I would never have thought a dressing of just yogurt would have been the key to making the best fruit salad!

I served this to my in-laws for brunch.  They were discussing what could be in the salad dressing to make it taste so good.  Imagine their surprise when I had to reveal that "secret ingredient" was strawberry yogurt!  Quick, easy, and tasty.  Does not keep well, though.

This was pretty good, but I'm not so sure I'd serve it for company.  To be fair, I used blackberry yogurt because that's what I had on hand.  I enjoyed it, but was thinking that maybe some light Cool Whip would make it a little less yogurty.  I will try it again because it's SO easy to make, and I love the fresh fruit.

One other thing that is simply wonderful.....Instead of the yogurt, mix a packet of sugar free white chocolate pudding with a container of cool whip.  Add to the fruit.  YUMMY!  I also like to add granny smith apples for crunch.

Great, easy recipe.  I did add more strawberries than called for, only because it didn't look like there were enough compared to the amount of bananas and grapes.  I could only find a 6 oz. container of yogurt, but I thought that amount covered perfectly.

Simple is best is that name here! I've been making this for years. Experiment with different fresh fruits in season and vary the flavor of yogurt. Vanilla or peach yogurts do well. The appearance is always best with just a few fruit selections. I've made this with as many as four and as few as two, but this looks nicest with three cut in larger chunks.

Huge success at family picnic.  I used GREEN & PURPLE GRAPES (grn were cut in half, prpl were small enough to keep whole), cut STRAWBERRIES & 2 fresh cut up PEACHES, along with strawberry yogurt.  It was good but felt it needed something.  So, I added some VANILLA EXTRACT & CINNAMON.  **Big Differance!!** (Guests were trying to guess what the magic flavor was.)  Next time: vanilla or peach yogurt...strawberry was just too ordinary & needed punched up.  Definately making this healthy again!!!

I served this at a party recently. I made it mainly for the kids but it was more popular than the more sophisticated dishes.  I served it with granola (put the granola in a separate bowl so it doesn't get soggy). I now make a batch every week to keep on hand for breakfasts (it only keeps a few days). I usually use strawberries, blueberrys, melon, mandarin oranges and pineapple.  You can use any flavor of yogart but I really like strawberry or vanilla.

Very good and easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand! I used a large container of Strawberries, quartered with a smidge of sugar; an equal amount of red and green grapes combined; a small amount of blueberries; I used a small can of tidbit pineapples, drained; I soaked the banana slices in the pineapple juice

This is a great recipe. I read the other reviews and use strawberries, red grapes and blueberries.  I also fold in fat free cool whip to the yogurt. This is an excellent treat!

I just got done making this and eating a bowl. MMMMMMMMMMM it is soo good. I used Fred meyer brand Lite lemon yogurt. Mainly because I am a big lemon fan but it didn't taste lemony.. it just had that extra zip to it, I guess. So I would say to try the lemon, although next time I make this I may try strawberry. 
     Would even be great for dessert! I know this is going to be a regular dish for our family this summer. It's extremely healthy and extremely delicious.. can't beat that combo!

This recipe was quick and easy.  Next time I will add the whipped topping as others have suggested.  While it was very good a little more sweetnes would have been better. This is a keeper.

I am so excited to make this.  I need to make a fruit salad for 60 for a homeless group and it needs to be able to stand up to being outdoors for an hour.  This looks easy, fast, and delicious.

Maybe I'm a purist, but the fruit tastes better and looks better on its own.  Yogurt did not add anything positive in terms of taste and in fact looked unappetizing.

This is not one of our favorites. However, I do find myself making it sometimes because it's easy and reasonably well-received. Kind of like oatmeal, I guess. You can use whatever fruit and whatever yogurt floats your boat. This is infinitely better with a drizzle of honey, but that kind of defeats the purpose of using yogurt instead of Cool Whip in the first place :) Thanks for the recipe -- it is a stand-by, even if not my first choice!

Loved that this was so simple. I would use just vanilla yogurt next time, as I found too much strawberry flavor to be over powering.

My kids love fruit salad. I goofed in not having strawberry yogurt when I thought I did, but what I had was Organic Greek Yogurt w/Honey. It worked anyway. My feeling is that, the grapes overwhelmed this dish a bit (too many) not the yogurt. And if you didn't serve it immediately the juices from the fruit souped up with the combined yogurt and bananas start to turn colors if waiting to serve. This recipe makes a big batch, which isn't bad if your feeding a good little group of people, I'll make this again but half a batch and only because my son recommended I add marshmellows to it...I had to ask why and he said so the mellows could soak up the juice...makes sense to me. So there you have a cute recommendation from my 10 year old.

Left out the bananas, added some fresh pineapple and mixed a little Cool Whip with the yogurt. It was the only salad at the BBQ last weekend that was GONE! Everyone loved it, kids & adults. This is a new family favorite!

Great and easy recipe.  I used cherry vanilla yogurt (as that was all I had) and added some frozen blueberries that I found in the freezer.  As other reviewers suggested, I also added a dollup of whipped topping when I added the yogurt.  This would also be great with some granola sprinkled on top.  Thanks for sharing.

I used a little less of those fruits and added one kiwi, and a handful of coconut flakes.  It was really delicious.  It could probably be made with a variety of fruits.  I may try it with granola for breakfast, next time.  Yum!  And, really healthy!

I changed this recipe to fit what I had on hand. I used a mixture of cantalope, blueberries, strawberries, and red grapes. I also only had plain yogurt, so I added a little sugar to that and tossed with the fruit---great fruit salad, thanks for the idea! My 4 year old loved it and ate 2 bowls.

Very simple fruit salad. Not very complex, flavor wise, but a good quick dessert or side. Would probably make it again, but will try other recipes.

Made this for a bbq at a friend's house and it was wonderful.  It was so simple, it's the kind of thing you can throw together in under 2 minutes.  I thought the yogurt was an excellent touch to this salad.  Thanks for such a simple and tasty recipe!

Couldn't be easier if it tried and my 2 yr old had 2 bowls with dinner so this one is a keeper in my book :)  not a flashy recipe, wouldn't make it for a potluck or anything like that, but a great way to get some fruit into a picky eaters diet (like the above mentioned 2 yr old LOL).  Works for any meal(s) of the day, Breakfast Lunch dinner and/or snacks.  Sill be a summer staple in my fridge!

This was an good find for a packed lunch. I was looking for something slightly sweet and healthy to. I mixed to taste the yogurt, bananas, and strawberries for 1 serving. I subbed peaches for the grapes as they are not a favorite. I had low fat French vanilla yogurt. I don't think the flavor really matters. I may also try strawberry. ty

I had to make 10 times this recipe for a family reunion and added whipped cream and used bananas, apples, peaches. I whipped raspberries into the whipped cream to add some tarty flavor.

I put this in a tall glass similar to a parfait.  I added non-fat whipped cream to the top.   I was surprised that this easily filled me up.  Make sure to watch the sugar content in strawberry yogurt, some are really high.  Great for breakfast.  My hubby said he could have used a side of granola.

This recipe was OK.  I made a bunch of it for a potluck, and didn't get many raves but I didn't get any complaints either.  I added some blueberries and used low-fat strawberry yogurt, and one low-fat vanilla yogurt.

Easy and really good.  Served this at a baby shower and had someone ask for the recipe.  Instead of strawberry yogurt I used lemon, but strawberry would be good, too.

Fast and simple. I used Trix triple cherry yogurt since it's what I found in the fridge. It went well with all the fruit and this was very fresh tasting. Thanks, this was a perfect light breakfast.

You gotta love "whatever you got" recipes.  Its just the two of us, so all I chopped up was 2 bananas, a couple strawberries, and an orange. Threw the bananas with some lemon juice, and used half vanilla yogurt half strawberry. Put it in a pretty dish and set er on the table.  He loved it! I got up this morning to have some for breakfast, and the tupperware was in the sink lol Howie says thank you! :)

This is such a simple recipe that I had my doubts as to how amazing it could possibly be.  Boy, were my doubts unfounded!  I omitted the grapes because I didn't want to have to slice them in half, and I substituted blueberries instead.  This was so delicious and refreshing.  It's so simple, but it tastes so special.  Delicious!

It was okay.  However, the mixture of the yogurt made it look less appealing in my opinion.

This is yummy and easy (it could be better with a little more work though that's not the point or the recipe).  Also adding some citrus, oranges, grapefruit, etc will help lengthen the life of the bananas, or just add a splash of OJ to the mixture.

Just wonderful.  Like most people are saying, any fruit works.  I too did the 1/1 ratio of yogurt and berry medley cool whip.  I added 1 cup of crushed walnuts as well.  There were ZERO leftovers.  I think that's the idea.  Very tasty, very healthy, very easy and VERY popular.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent, quick fruit salad.  I, too, added cool whip (1:1 ratio w/yogurt).  And as others have mentioned, it doeesn't sit well for very long (it gets runny and the bananas turn).  However, with that said, it was a favorite for Christmas morning breakfast, and with the red strawberries, green grapes and yellow bananas, the colors couldn't have been more festive.  Thanks for the great recipe - we'll have this again, I'm sure!

Fantastic! This salad has become a family favorite and I make it at least twice a week. I usually use bananas, green apples, and grapes with strawberry yogurt. I live in Kenya and those are the least expense fruits. When I make this I never have leftovers! Thanks, Cathy, for sharing this recipe!

It is amazing how the simplest of ingredients make the best recipes. I made this using half a pound of strawberries, half a pound of green grapes, and one Gala apple instead of the banana. I used strawberry banana yogurt to give a banana taste, as I was weary of the reviewers that said the banana got soggy. I will make this again and again, trying different fruits as they are available. Thank you for your creation!

Just finished making this.  Took the advise of another reviewer and added equal amount of cool whip to the yogurt ratio, however, when I first tasted it, when done making it, it tasted too sweet & rich.  But once it sat in the fridge for a few hours, it was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.  Besides adding regular cool whip, also replaced the strawberry yogurt for vanilla Greek 80 cal./8 oz. Used, blackberries, green & red grapes and raspberries.  

Thank you for sharing this wonderful tasting & easy fruit salad with us.  I will be making this again & again.

It's kind of silly how easy this is, but a great idea doesn't have to be complicated.  I made this for my daughter's kid birthday party.  I used one big bag frozen strawberries and a small bag each of blackberries and raspberries, then I addd in some fresh green and red grapes so all the fruit wouldn't be frozen.  Used low fat strawberry yogurt.  The kids ate it up.  It tasted like a smoothie.  So easy it's crazy.

This is my go-to fruit salad recipe when I'm having guests.  The only change I make is to add blueberries so that the salad matches the picture.  Delicious, healthy and a crowd pleaser.

This was so delicious!  I just followed the recipe and put in the fridge and gave it time to "marinate" for a bit and everyone raved about it.  It is definately a keeper and will be made many more times this summer.  I even used a light yogurt which made it even better.  Yummy!

This was very easy to make and very good.  I used white peaches instead of bananas and used vanilla yogurt since my husband doesn't like strawberries.  I did add about a tablespoon of sugar to make it a little sweeter.  I will definitely bring make this again in the future.

Thank You Cathy Byron : I enjoyed this so much that I sent to all of my 5 sister's. I added my own unique fruits by using just 2 canned fruit: pineapple tidbit's & mandarin orange's with the fruit above but no banana's. Then I also used angel food cake shaped like a loaf & Kraft's non-dairy Cool Whip. My yogurt choice was vanilla. I liked how the yogurt & fruit natural juices w/ no sugar added. Made a little sauce which I poured over the cake & added topping. I enjoyed this so that I use the fruit to go w/breakfast, and mini parfait's. I made this just for me, next I'm changing it for 3 servings.

Made this a few times now; when I make it to the recipe (when I'm in a hurry) it's always a hit, but changing things up is popular too!  Try it with any or all of the following: Kiwi, peaches, apples, watermelon, pineapple, blueberries, mangos, pears, and plums.  Really, any fruit would probably go great in this recipe, no matter what I try, everyone has to fight to get a serving before it's all gone!

Peaches instead of bananas  (another cooks suggestion) is a good change and will not turn dark.  Thank you for the great recipe.  We are busy and looking for tasty AND simple.  A hit.  Sharon

this was quick and easy.  I added apple and for a bit of crunch and it weas great.  Next time I will reduce the yogurt just a bit and add whipped cream which I think will make it even better.  Also great using frozen strawberries letting them thaw out but remain super cold

Took this for Christmas celebration. Nephews raved about it (!) and it went fast. I did not used about half as much yogurt as was recommended and added in drained canned pears. So nice that the calculator helped me know how much to buy!

I'm not sure why this recipe has such a high rating.  The yogurt just makes the salad messy and adds nothing to the taste.  No one in my family would eat it, and we are all fruit salad lovers.  It would have been much better without the yogurt!!

I made this for work the other day and everyone loved it.  I added a little strawberry cool whip with the yogurt and it was really good.  Based on another comment I added some peaches and they were a great addition.  This is an easy, healthy go to recipe that I'll use a again.

I made this for our Monthly famly get together yesterday. It was quick and easy and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. All if the kids loved it as well. This is definitely a keeper. I used red and green grapes. Adding Extra Creamy Cool Whip is a must. It lightened up the sauce and really gave it an extra fluffiness and sweetness. This ia a permanent resident in my recipe box.

I have already made this several times, for my family and a huge portion for my husband's high school basketball team.  Everyone loved it.  The basketball boys kept coming back for seconds and thirds...don't know how successful everyone is at getting high school boys to eat fruit, but this is one way to do it!  Very easy and delicious!

I pretty much followed the recipe.  I liked having the yogurt in there... it added some flavor and was good... much better than just adding in sugar (which is what my mom always did growing up).

adding fruit to yogurt is not really a recipe in my opinion... but its good anyway ;-)My french boyfriend said it was 'too american' and barely touched it. LOL It doesnt save well for the next day, the yogurt gets runny.

I used this recipe as an idea and made it my own. Instead of grapes I used pears. I didn't like the thought of strawberry yougurt with strawberries already in it so I used lowfat vanilla. I also sprinkled alittle sugar on it to sweeten it and my bananas were a tad green so they wouldn't turn to mush as quick. It turned out very yummy!

Fruit and yogurt -- what's not to like about this combination?!? Plenty of flexibility to "play" with this one. I used mandarin oranges, bananas, grapes, apples and kiwi and it was great for a quick brunch accompaniment for brunch. Very "pretty" too!  Thanks!

This is a great, refreshing salad.  It is a variation of an "Apple Salad" recipe I use with Lemon Yogurt and Cool Whip Free (apples & green grapes).  I haven't seen lemon yogurt mentioned here, but lemon yogurt and cool whip makes a delicious fruit dip or salad!

This is a great and easy recipe. Plus you can substitute the yogurt flavor for a different taste or change the fruit to seasonal favorites. The people at my work loved it! Add granola or slivered almonds for a little crunch!

I personally don't like grapes so I substituted apples and they worked very well. I also included granola and non-fat cool whip. I found the cool whip overpowered the taste of the vanilla yogurt, but I didn't mind because it was more delicious. Unfortunately, the fruit salad doesn't hold up long. After a day, the bananas and granola were mushy. Next time I make this I will only include strawberries, apples, and cool whip. Just my personal preference.

So easy, and a big hit with the family.  Even my meat and potatoes husband went back for seconds.  I'm not a big yogurt fan but when mixed with the cool-whip it was a winner.

So yes, I’ve altered this a bit as most of the others have. This is my 100% easiest go-to menu for events and family gatherings. I use half honey flavored or honey/vanilla Greek yogurt, half whipped cream. Mix them together to my desired taste, then add blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and halved grapes. I add a side of granola or chopped candied walnuts/pecans as an optional topping. This is an excellent and super easy dish!!!

So easy! So good! I used no fat vanilla yogurt 'cause that's just what I prefer. And I added blueberries for contrast colour and flavours.  This was an awesome fruit salad served alongside grilled pork chops.  It does not carry over the next day well if you add bananas. I may just leave those out next time.  Loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was amazing, both the vanilla yogurt and strawberry yogurt versions! I added a scoop of lite cool whip for each scoop of yogurt. It was a hit at Easter, especially with freshly picked strawberries!

Love this recipe. I didn't use bananas, and I squeezed fresh lemon on it. I used the yogurt and smashed up some Special K for a topping. I try to make this weekly.

Really easy and good.  Forego the bananas because they get mushy.  Use any fruit in season that you like.  Put yogurt on just before serving, or it gets watery.

This is a quick and delicious salad...I make it often for breakfast, only with one twist.  I stir some preserves into the yogurt to make the 'dressing'.  Currently my favorite is peach preserves with jalapeno into plain Greek yogurt.  So good over the fruit.  I  also like to add pineapple and blueberries to the fruit.

The thing I like about this idea is how versible it is. Based on seasonal fruit or personal tastes. I use vanilla yogurt because it goes with anything. Use bananas only when I know there won't be leftovers. Bananas don't do well on day #2.

This was really good. Cool and refreshing. I used lemon yogurt and purple grapes. Our store didn't have any green grapes that day. I think this would be good with blueberries in it too.

Ugh. I didn't think this was very good. I guess I'm not a fan of yogurt as a dressing. I didn't think it looked very appetizing, either. Won't make this again.

This was really good.  I made it for a brunch, and the others loved it.  I accidentally bought yogurt with sucralose in it (yuck!), but the fruit flavors masked it, luckily for me.

As the recipe states, it's just OK.  The second time I made it, I added blueberries, to the mix.  I then topped it with raspberries and candied pecans.  PERFECTION after the quick fixes, and lots of compliments on the dish!

Easy & versatile. I was planning on making fruit salad but didn't have my usualy standby mixins (peach pie filling or vanilla pudding), and was looking for something to give my fruit salad a little oomf. This did it. Delish!

Made this for a family reunion - everyone loved it. I used strawberries, pineapple, grapes and blueberries with strawberry yogurt and whipped cream. There wasn't any leftovers. Couldn't have been more simple and easy to take for a picnic.

This recipe is wonderfully customizable. Add any fruits you'd like (except oranges, because that's be gross). Then add strawberry yogurt until it's an even and healthy coating. SO SIMPLE!!

This a fruit salad which I have made for years using kiwi and mango from a jar instead of bananas and  each time I add another variation such as some crushed almonds for that needed crunch. Recently my granddaughter wanted me to add some chocolate chips and to my surprise it was deliciously different. We added a dollop of whipped cream on top and did not mix it in.

i make this quite often, using what ever fruits are available.  often peaches, pears, bananas, grapes strawberries etc.  but instead of yogurt, which i do not care for, i use sour creme with a dash of vanilla.  tastes great.

This is soooo easy and very YUMMY.  I use soy-based yogurt, as I don't do milk-based yogurt.  Nobody cares either b/c it is so good.  Thank you Fit&Healthy mom!

good for a fast to make, fast to eat salad. I loved the idea to add the yogurt! Definitely added something to it, but it does get runny quick. The second time I made it I added fresh apples and oranges and about 3 tbsp of sugar. Very good dish!

this was so easy and fun to make!  i brought it to a work party and it was gobbled up.  i recently tried making it again, but substituted the given fruit for raspberries and plums.  i wanted to find peach yogurt, but can't seem to find it in a large container, so went for strawberry again.  i had to add a little sugar, because the plums were pretty tart, but it worked out really well!  I can't wait to try out other fruits. thanks!

I don't like fruit salad, but had to make it for a gathering.  I picked this because it seemed easiest.  Everyone loved it!  Used strawberries, blueberries, apples and grapes.

This was ok. I may try it next time with vanilla yogurt. I found the yogurt made it a little runny.

My boyfriend who rarely eats fruit said it was the best fruit salad he's ever had.  I crushed a couple of Italian amaretto cookies on the top for some crunch and it was sooooo GOOD!!!

This was amazing! When doing my weekly meal planning, I planned for this to be a side dish on one night and have it's leftovers as a side the next....there wasn't any left after the first night! This was really good, next time I might add a few more fruits!!!

This is really good fruit salad. I like the addition of strawberry yogurt to the fruit. I did add about 4 oz. of Cool Whip, since I like the flavor with fruit.

Very good.  I did take other reviewer's advice and did 1:1 with the strawberry yogurt and cool whip.  I'm glad I did!

I made this recipe this weekend for my sons 3rd bday party, definitely a success amond kids, no leftovers at all.
I did not add the yogurt in all the mixed fruit, I kept it  on the side for parents to take as needed.
Also the strawberries from the local store were really good, actually nice dark red and sweet so yogurt was not an immediate necessity.
thanks for the easy recipe once again.
