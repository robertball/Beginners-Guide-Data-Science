Note to the person saying these cookies were too salty, this recipe has no salt.. so how does that work out?  Follow the recipe and you will get a great bunch of cookies.
Anyway, my wife made these and added chocolate chips and they were fantastic (also make sure you cool the batter in the fridge before trying to bake, that way they don't flatten out)

these cookies were good to me because i like it having a lot mint flavoring. however the rest of my family said that all they could taste was the mint. so i tried it again and reduced the amount of mint extract i used. the second time it was delicious and everyone loved it.

This recipie sucks.
It isnt thick enough to make a cookie, and its taste sorta rubbery. Doesnt really cook all the way thru either.

It was the consitency of a cake recipie.
Will not make again.

Way too salty.  I would decrease amount of salt.  Cookies are also flat and crumple easily.  I would use 2 eggs instead of one.

I loved these cookies. They came out better then I thought they would be. I accidently messed up the melting of the chocolate, and it was all chunky and clay like (not silky and smooth), but I mixed everything together anyway and it was reaaaally good in the end. The size I made mine were not big, a little medium sized I guess, and at 17 minutes in the oven they were perfect. Also, just in case anybody was wondering, I used Junior Mints. 2 boxes is perfect.

I thought these were good, although I would have liked to have had a bit more of a mint taste.  I followed the recipe, using York Mint Patties chopped up.  Maybe Andes or Junior Mints would have worked out better.  Thanks for the recipe!  It is very nice and chocolatey!

I LOVED these cookies! Light and fluffy, yet crunchy all at the same time! I replaced the mint chocolates with four tsp. of peppermint extract, and it was wonderfully minty. Also instead of chocolate pieces I used dark chocolate chocolate chips. It helped amplify the mint flavor. I will definitely make this again!
