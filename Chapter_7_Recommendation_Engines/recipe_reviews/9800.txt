I read the recipe and read the reviews and saw where people were mildly to severely disappointed with this one.  I laughed a little bit as dutch pastries are sometimes hard to make and me being a dutchie myself I thought I would see what I could do with this one.  Im honestly not sure if this really is dutch or not honestly.  Once I read what they had to say I took a closer look at the ingredients and measurements.  This is a shortbread type of cookie, which usually is on the crumbly or firm side.  So you cant realistically bake this into bars and cut it without having crumbs.  However I took one review that said to add in the egg other than brush the top of it and then instead of bars (for reasons mentioned above) I rolled it into cookies by hand and pressed sugar and almonds in the tops of the cookies and in about 25 minutes they were ready.  Being that its a shortbread it doesnt really "brown" nor change color from dough to cooked form for that matter so when u can press the cookies and they do not give they are ready.  I gave this one 4 stars after my alterations to the recipe.  Hope this was helpful!

Easy to make, although they seem a little dry.  A lot broke apart when cutting them.  Maybe tweak the recipe a little to make is more soft??

This recipe does not work the way it is printed.  If you do not add the eggs to the mixture you get crumbs!  Try to make it the way it says and you get a big mess!

I have mixed feelings over this one, and I think I've learned my lesson about not reading reviewer comments first...  LOL!  This was rather dry and crumbly while mixng, but I followed directions as written.  The end result is a tasty little treat, nice with some fresh fruit and yogurt on the side.
