I made a few changes, but this was wonderful!  First, I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, parsley, and oregano prior to dredging to give the meat some more flavor.  I also added some minced garlic to the oil for a few minutes before putting the meat in.  Then, I doubled the amount of broth and used 48 ounces of beef gravy in place of the red wine.  I also used red potatoes instead of celery.  There was enough liquid in the pot to completely cover the entire meal.  It simmered for 2.5 hours and it was delicious!  The meat just fell apart and the potatoes and carrots had an amazing flavor!  I served it with a side of fresh green beans and french bread and this meal just disappeared!  This will be added to my permanent cookbook!  5 stars!!

I made a few changes to this recipe and it was superb!  During the searing process, I placed the onions, garlic and a tablespoon of gravy master underneath the roast and then seared all sides.  I substituted 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar  (which acts as a natural meat tenderizer) during the searing process, for the wine and excluded the berries.  Also, I added the fresh vegetables (baby carrots, sugar snap peas and new potatoes) about an hour before serving- anything earlier and they turned too mushy for my taste.  I added fresh mushrooms to the mix and I used olive oil because it is the healthiest of all the oils. Very good I gave this 5 stars!

This is outstanding!  We loved this!  My past experiences with beef, in general, have ranged from the laughable to the disasterous, but this recipe has changed all that.  This is THE recipe that will benchmark my beef cookery.  It was tender, flavorful, moist.  I did season simply the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder before dredging the beef; browned it in a cast iron skillet, added the wine (cabernet sauvignon), and let it simmer for maybe 10 minute or so before adding it all to my electric fry pan with the remaining ingredients.  I tasted the broth, thought it lacked "a little something" and decided to add 1/2 tsp of sugar.  That, for me, was the missing ingredient, and now the flavors were a melody upon the tongue, sweet, salty, tart.  Linda, thank you SOOOO much for this submission.  There shall be no other pot roast recipe for me.  This one is it!

Meat turned out super-tender after 3 hours. Subbed potatos for celery though and it came out incredibly.

I thought this was great!  Much faster than putting it in a crockpot and just as tasty.  I added bay leaves and dried onion flakes and I didn't add the veggies until the last 45min of cooking time - I thought they would be mush after a couple hours.

The best pot roast I've ever made! I used red potatoes instead of celery and doubled the carrots (and added them during the last 45 minutes). The suggestions to season the beef before browning and adding a little sugar to the broth were helpful. Used a flour roux instead of cornstarch to thicken.

Very good.  Much better than the recipe I used to follow for pot roast.  I add potatoes and substitute bay leaves for the allspice.

This was very good.  Did not have whole allspice berries so substituted a teaspoon of ground allspice and used a red cooking wine ... very good

Eliminate the allspice and add  3 bayleafs, some canned tomatoes and a tablespoon of paprika for that traditional North Eastern dish.

This is sooo good!  Didn't change a thing!  Everyone loved it...the recipe doesn't mention to salt and pepper the meat before dredging...so make sure to do that.  I did change the order of cooking.  Sear meat then take out of the pot...then carmalize the onions and garlic in the remaining oil add the celery to the last couple of minutes of carmalizing, add wine to deglaze the pan, add back the meat, add the carrots and broth, cover and enjoy.  I made a 3# English roast and forgot about it...so cooked for four hours on accident...still very tender and juicy.  this is my go to pot roast recipe now!

I followed this recipe exactly how it's listed and this is DEFINITELY going in my recipe box.  It was the first time I ever made pot roast and hubby loved it!!  The only thing I'd change is that I removed the meat when I added the veggies just to saute them some.  Then, put the meat back in and continued on.  THANK YOU!!!

I browned the meat in a skillet and then transfered everything to a crock pot.  After 3 hours, the beef still was not tender.
The flavor was very good though and I will fix this roast again.

This was a good pot roast, I only wish I had followed the recipe more!  I ran out of broth, so I substituted the balance with water and onion soup mix.  I think the onion soup mix may have been a bit too overpowering to the general taste of the meal.  It was good, just not as great as I thought it would be.  Most likely, however, due to my modifications!

Made it as listed but without the allspice berries because I couldn't find mine. Even without them, it was quick to throw together, easy, and delicious.  The gravy was fabulous!

I normally like pot roast cooked in a pressure cooker. Decided to give this a try and was very pleasantly surprised. Roast was very flavorful and the gravy was outstanding, the only downside for me... the vegetables were a little mushy.

Very yummy!  We used Clos du Bois Cabernet Sauvignon for the red wine, and it tasted fantastic.    The only problem was the cooking time.  I used a thermometer to check the temp and it read 153.  I thought it'd gotten to the center of the roast, but when we went to cut it (after the 10 min resting period) it was bloody and pink in the middle!  OOPS.  I drained out about 1/3 of the broth, cut the roast into smaller chunks, and put it back into the pot on medium heat for 20 minutes-- 10 with the lid on, and 10 with the lid off, stirring occasionally.  Being a newbie at cooking, I also wasn't sure what to do with the veggies and broth when it came time to make the gravy.  I used a slotted spoon to remove the carrots and much of the onion and celery, but a bunch of the onion and celery stayed in the pot.  I drained off most of the liquid into a big bowl (to save for soup later in the week) and tried thickening the rest with corn starch.  It didn't quite get as thick as I'd hoped, but it was still very yummy.

Fantastic pot roast.  It can also be made in slow cooker for ease of preparation.  Red wine can be replaced by pure organic apple juice or cider if desired.  I like to cook mashed potatoes separated so clear broth isn't cloudy.  Great however it's made!

Hey folks, this is not a "Crockpot" pot roast. It is a classic stove top pot roast. If you transfer to a SLOW cooker then of course it won't be finished in 3 hours! Good flavor, make sure you generously salt & pepper the roast prior to searing

Tried this method of cooking a pot roast, as I didn't have the time for the slow cooker. The roast was so tender and had tons of flavor.  The only thing I did different was I did  add potatoes. This  is really a good recipe and I plan to use it often.

This is a fav of my husbands at a local resturant...He was skeptical of making it at home, but once he tried it, he said this recipe was better then the restaurant version.  He told me to definately put this in the "keeper" recipe file!

This is a terriffic recipe and very easy.  I've made it 4 times and perfection every time.  I added a little more beef broth, just enough to cover the roast.  I tried one reviewers suggestion of substituting red potatoes for the celery, result was a loss of flavor.  I think it would be ok to add  add potatoes if you really wanted, but the celery is needed to balance the flavor of the broth.  Someone mentioned adding sugar, but I can't see that either as the carrots provide a very nice sweetness. Why try to fix something that already works?

I really didn't enjoy the flavor of this.  My husband thought it was ok, but not great (and he's not that picky).  Probably just a matter of taste though.

Excellent.  And the leftovers & broth made a great soup after skimming off the fat.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband said he enjoyed it more than the expensive standing rib roast we had the week before.

Good recipe and loved by my whole family. I didn't use the berries, added Gravy Master and a bit of worst. sauce for flavor and more seasonings. Carrots cooked in this wonderful gravy don't get much better than this. Thanks a bunch Linda!

I tried this with Tara G's alterations and it was very good.  It was a bit too "soupy" for me, but still delicious!

Turned out great.  I used port wine and needed one extra tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  My pot lid is extra tight, so very little liquid was lost during cooking.  I did not have celery on hand, so that was left out.

Made this and it was ok.  If I do make it again I will use a slow cooker as meat was not as tender as we would have liked.  Be prepared to use a thickening agent above and beyond what is called for.

I will make this again.  This is a good, basic recipe to start with.   It turned out great.  I didn't have corn starch, garlic cloves or allspice berries.  I skipped making the gravy and used garlic powder and cloves instead.  My roast was over 5 lbs, so extra everything went into the pot.  I also added about a dozen small yellow potatoes, cut in half.  This is a delicious way to turn a less expensive cut into a hearty feast.

I didn't make any changes because I like to rate and review the recipe as written. That said, I would  make a few changes to suit my taste. My son and daughter- in law both enjoyed it.

This did not turn out great for me - the meat was not tender at all. I used 48 oz of beef broth instead of wine (as suggested below) and there was FAR TOO MUCH liquid.
