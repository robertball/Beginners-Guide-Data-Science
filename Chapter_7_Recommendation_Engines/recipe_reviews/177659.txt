Sorry Campbell's, but I didn't use your broth, though I did use the vegetables and method as directed. I just lightly dressed the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper and Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning (yey, Fox Point, Wisconsin!) Hubby grilled these in an open grated grill pan till they were crisp-tender and charred. Tossed a little fresh thyme in just before serving. Delicious!

This was very good. I have a fry pan with holes in it for the grill.[Otherwise I lose them] The flavor of the veggies really come out. I used beef broth, it's what I had on hand. The broth kept the veggies moist, not all dried out. I just lightly sprinkled with salt when they were done. Will make again.

These were great!  I marinated the zucchini, yellow squash and peppers overnight in the broth which made them very tasty and kept them from drying out.  I also mixed in some cherry tomatoes with the onion and mushroom that I grilled separately (I didn't marinate them because I didn't want the onion or mushroom to get soggy).  I will definitely use this again!

This had wonderful smoky grilled flavor. Nice flavor in this dish. I used frozen pre cut veggies and had hubby grill them in a little foil boat until they were tender, so we didn't get the pretty grill marks. The flavor was great though. Thanks!

Grilled vegetables are always awesome! I omitted the broth and used a balsamic vinegar with a touch of EVOO. I like them just slightly crunchy. MmmMmm!
Also, you can use frest vegetables in season, like Asparagus and whole garlic. Or even small chunks of red potatoes (they have to be put on first as they take longer to cook). Use your personal taste and imagination.

i ended up dumping everything in a baking dish & baking it in the oven (the grill was out of gas). it was so bland, but that could have been from baking and not grilling.

I find it easier to drizzle soy sauce and garlic or whatever seasonings you prefer and wrap the veggies in foil, then you only have to flip the foil packet and you don't lose any veggies!

I thought these veggies would have much more flavor than it did. Normally I love grilled vegetables so I'm not sure what went wrong exactly. Maybe I was just expecting something a little more exciting, I dunno. They weren't bad, and they were definitely edible, but at the end of the day they were just...vegetables. Maybe it was the combination of ingredients that just didn't work, or maybe they just need more herbs or spices to make the flavor come out a little more.
