Very easy and delicious recipe! I used 5 whole eggs in place of just using egg whites in addition to whole eggs.  I think next time I would add some garlic powder (or minced garlic and cook it with the onion and pepper) and maybe some pepper jack cheese too. The primary flavor of this is cumin, so if you're not a fan, you might want to lessen it a bit--but we very much enjoyed it as-is. Topped it with salsa and fresh oregano and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

As usual on Sundays we always have breakfast at about noon, so I'm glad I saw this before I started breakfast today.  We both thought it was outstanding and a healthier version of the normal frittata, my only addition was a sprinkle of garlic powder.

Delicious for Sunday brunch.  I sauteed bacon and cut it into little bits and added to the vegetables, then I added the egg mixture.  Thank you for the recipe

This was sooo good for a Sunday brunch with Bloody Mary.  We did follow some reveiws and added pepper jack cheese to top before baking. Also never seperated eggs used 6 whole due to amount of veggies. The salsa topped it off. We also severved with bacon. Awsome. Will be a favorite

It's so great to find a recipe for an egg dish that is not drenched in cheese.  I also used 5 whole eggs instead of the egg white/whole egg combination and i added a bit of chopped garlic.  Came out very well.

Very good, although not necessarily my favorite frittata I've ever made. Still gave it five stars because of ease and overall it was still pretty yummy. I agree that the salsa really finishes it off! I did cook some bacon crumbles in addition to the onion and peppers. I liked it, but also think it would have been just fine without (and a nice vegetarian option). I also just went with five whole eggs and just a little milk, just my preference. The beauty of frittatas is that you can cater to your own palate. Thanks for the recipe!

Great simple little recipe. So tasty, and just enough for four quality servings. I added Jimmy Dean sausage to this (cooked off three 1/2 inch patties before, then cubed and added to pepper and onion mix during  cooking.) Could also be gently topped with shredded cheese late in the bake to add a cheesy top crust. 

Highly rec. either as is or with your own experimentation!

Yes, I used five whole eggs and added a tooth of minced garlic.  It was yummy.

I used more eggs and more cumin than the recipe called for and added a finely chopped jalapeno pepper.  I will likely add green chilies next time.

Good but since my eggs were small, I added one more and more vegetables than called for, i.e., Red bell pepper and then some bacon

Very good and easy to make. I had all the ingredients at home so that was a plus. I didn't use egg whites, just 6 eggs like another review mentioned. I also added sliced jalapenos. We like our food spicy. And sprinkled cheese on top.

Very yummy although certainly makes more than one portion as written 
Only change I made was to add the salsa to the mix instead of on top. 
Would cut down a bit on the added salt since the salsa makes it salty enough

I don’t care for eggs so  I was looking for some way that I could disguise them. Decided to try it for my husband and he absolutely loved it and I did too! It’s amazing with a little bit of Mexican cheese mix on  top while it’s still hot. The salsa made it extra yummy!  I will make this often.

I followed other recommendations and added some chopped cooked bacon and garlic. Also did all the sautéing of the vegetables in a cast iron skillet, added the egg mixture to the vegetables and baked it in the that. Very tasty.

I followed some of the other changes people made, I added some pepper jack cheese and some back bacon as that was all I had at the time but will try some spicy sausage next time.  Family loved it!

I added butter to the oil and made this in my cast iron skillet. So instead of moving everything to a casserole to cook I just put the skillet in the oven. I know that egg whites are lower calories but I never know what to do with the leftover yolks. Otherwise this was a great breakfast idea!
