A very basic, refreshing smoothie with a convoluted name. Made this with optional coconut. Without either of the optional ingredients, this smoothie would be rather ho-hum. I think the three reviews preceding mine over a 3 year period is a function of the odd name given to this recipe since it does not pull up in a ingredient search of ‘smoothies’ or under AR’s ‘Banana Smoothies’ collection. That’s a shame because you can make a tasty smoothie, clean-up the blender, and be out the door with it in less than 5 minutes.

This is a very refreshing cocktail for a hot weather. Following the recipe, I realized it needs a little sugar for me. I added 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar and it was perfect. I tried to add a little coconut milk for the next portion and liked it too. The cocktail is close to refreshing iced drinks with fruit flavor that serve some bars at the beach.

I loved this. I made it without the optional ingredients, and it was a good refreshing drink for the sweltering hear. I'll definitely make this again.
