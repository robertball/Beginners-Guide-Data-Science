Good recipe, but I added a few things- becaue it was kind of boring otherwise.  I cooked the hamburger in some garlic and onion powerdf.  Then instead of worschestire sauce I used A1 steak sauce becuae I didn't have any worschestire.  Also added a little bit more brown sugar.  My family likes more saucy sloppy joes so I only used 1 pound of hamburger.

Tasted just like I remember and how I thought a simple Sloppy Joe would taste! Added some garlic powder and onion powder and salt and pepper. Will be making again.

Kid friendly recipe indeed or for those picky eaters that don't like onions and peppers!  I've tried different ways of making it, this one has good flavor to it although I add a bit of onion powder and garlic powder to the hamburger when browning.  For a twist you can add a can of pinto beans or kidney beans as well.

I was looking for my "first" homemade sloppy joe recipe.  This is it - I add a bit of onion and garlic powder and green pepper but otherwise I follow the recipe to a tee and it's FANTASTIC.  No more manwich in this house....Thanks!

I had planned to only make half the recipe with one pound of ground beef for me and my husband.  After I added half the soup concentrate, I decided that wouldn't be enough sauce.  So used the same amounts for the sauce for half the ground beef.  Glad I did it that way - it was quite tasty.  Will be making this one again...

I like it as a base. I heated all ingredients and before serving I sampled it. It was a bit bland. I added some Sriracha chili sauce and a little mustard. Perfect!!

I have been looking for this recipe.  It tastes so much like what we had in school.  Most of the kids would ask for a second serving, they were that good!  I made this for our nephew, a very fussy eater, and he came back for more.  He even came back for the leftovers the next day!  I love it.  Will make again and again.  The only ingredient I changed is the soup, I used the tomato bisque, my fave!

Overall it was a good recipe.  Needed some additional seasoning I thought.  So I added 2 cloves garlic, celery salt, 1 shallot, some ketchup, barbeque sauce, & a smidge of honey mustard dipping.  I didn't have any worcestershire sauce, so i used sweet baby rays barbeque instead.  Overall it turned out pretty good I thought.  Just needs something more..

I always change or add ingredients based on our tastes.  This is good but I added diced onion, celery, tomato paste and some ketup.  I also added 1/2 lb. sweet italian sausage to the 1 1/4 lb. ground chuck.  I simmered longer and it was delish.  Simple but good!

These were okay but rather bland and needed quite a bit of doctoring up to suit our tastes. Very kid friendly though as there is no green pepper or onion or any chunks of any kind in this.

Less ground meat makes it saucier. Added a little more worcestershire and a little chopped onion and green pepper, yum.

I hadn't eaten sloppy joes in decades, but wanted to try to make some.  I started with green peppers and onions from another recipe, but didn't have the chili sauce it called for, so I sort of finished with this recipe.
I added meat, tomato soup and didn't have Worcestershire, so I added Heinz 57 sauce.  Added a bit of oregano and mustard.  They were good!  But too sweet.  I would eliminate the sugar next time (or perhaps add just a tiny bit)

Really good recipe! I tweaked it a bit more to our tastes, especially since I had 2.5lbs of ground beef. Added a can of tomato sauce, some onion powder, garlic salt, and pepper, added 2 more tbs of vinegar and added some ketchup. The base recipe is great, but you can certainly tweak it to your tastes! We will be keeping this one for sure!

I added some onion salt and mushrooms, plus I always use ground turkey instead of beef. I ran out of ketchup and needed a recipe without it. This was good. I'll definitely make it again.

Yummy! We like saucier joes, so we use 1 lb of ground turkey with a can of tomato soup and half the other ingredients for a healthiness factor. My husband puts pickles on his sandwich for a salty addition. And we make fries for a side. Definitely recommend!
