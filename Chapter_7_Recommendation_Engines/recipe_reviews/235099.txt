My husband is from Saudi and loves this dish, I used this recipe as a base and made just a few changes. First I doubled all the spices and sprinkled them on onion and let the onion simmer in the oil, then I added 5 cloves of chopped garlic and 1/2 a chopped jalape√±o. Then added the beef and cooked until brown, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 4 cups of water, 4 cups of beef broth, frozen okra and 2 dashes of lemon juice. And then followed through with the rest of the cooking instructions. My husband did request that I add eggplant towards the end. We loved it, the meat was very tender, lots of flavor and my hubby said it taste like home.

It was very good. Followed the recipe, and I usually don't. My husband even liked it  and he doesn't care for okra.  I served it over cauliflower rice. I made it last summer and froze some . Got it out around Thanksgiving and it was just as good. Planned to make it this summer when the okra started coming in, but it hasn't yet. I'll have to make a trip to the farmers market.

I'd spent some time in Afghanistan and Northern Iraq (Kurdistan) and at every dinner I was invited, this dish was included in their feast. I remembered eggplants in some, so I added the Japanese type eggplants and this came out as I remembered it - delicious. I also used chicken (thighs and or drum sticks) instead of beef. I'd poured it over Jasmin rice or just drink as soup/stew - enjoy.
