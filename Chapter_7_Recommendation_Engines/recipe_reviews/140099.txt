This was a great recipe and very easy.  I used ground venison instead of beef, added alittle extra garlic, topped with mexican cheese and sour cream. it will definately be a regular chili recipe in my house.

A thick, meaty chili.  Very quick to make, which is nice for a weeknight meal.  My dh loved it (probably because it was so meaty), but I thought it needed something (fritos!).

This recipe was a winner.  Tripled the recipe for a lunch gathering.  Instead of Italian-style stewed tomatoes, I used a can of regular stewed tomatoes, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Used 1 can of kidney beans and 2 cans of chili beans w/sauce. Also added a small can of diced jalapenos for a little extra heat.

I used the 19 oz. can of beans, and the 19 oz. can of tomatoes, and added a diced green pepper.  Spice is nice, not too hot.  I will make it again.

Did not like it. It might be the brand or type of Tequila used.

I browned the meat, drained then added to the rest of the mixture in a crockpot on high for about 30 mins.  So delicious with sour cream and  cheddar shreds!

Mmmmm!  This recipe is a keeper!  It's easy to make and has a really nice flavor.  I made the recipe as stated (and I always add cheese and sour cream on top in my bowl).  My husband and I kept going back for extra helpings.  Now we only have enough leftover for one of us to eat tomorrow.  I'll have to make this again soon!

This was wonderful.  I didn't have the tomato sauce so I made it without that and it was great.
