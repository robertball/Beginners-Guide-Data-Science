I made the recipe for my brother's birthday and he loved it. He was so proud of having a homemade ice-cream pie that he invited all the neighboorhood kids to taste it.

This was great, although my store didn't have just the toffee so i had to get the toffee/chocolate mix and it turned out great.

Superb recipe!  I tried it with chocolate ice cream and used broken SKOR bars within the ice cream layers and also skattered on top.  The caramel sauce is terrific too!  My friends said it was a "recipe to die for!"  Really satisfies the chocolate craving.  Next time I'll try it as written.  I'll bet it's just as great.
