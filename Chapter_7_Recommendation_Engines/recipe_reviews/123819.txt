This was pretty bad.  I ended up tossing it out and making a new recipe.

I found this recipe to be very good but thought it needed a little brown sugar. Also, I cooked it in a crock pot and it cooked all day so it was a little too dry for me and I added a can of Rotel tomatoes at the end. My teens and I really liked these sloppy joes.

I liked this recipe but I'd suggest a couple of modifications - use only half the mustard, and add a few tablespoons of bbq sauce.  I also added some jalapeno sauce along with a small amount of brown sugar to balance the heat.

I really didn't like this recipe.  It was not for us at all.  It tasted too much like mustard.  My husband didn't even try it because he doesn't go near stuff with mustard in it.
