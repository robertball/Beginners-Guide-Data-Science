I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect and tastes delicious. I got four half pint jars.  It might help to know that 1 lb. of rhubarb=3 c. chopped (found this info on this site, rhubarb info.) I can hardly wait for next year's rhubarb, will definately make again.

I love Rhubarb, but don't care to mess it up with berries or anything.  This jam, with the added orange zest, and I use fresh squeezed orange juice from that orange that I grate, adds that little something special.  My daughter loves it so much, she eats it with a spoon.  It's too good to waste on bread.  I put a drop or two of red food coloring in it, and watch it carefully, as the cooking time is too long.  I usually watch it and can tell when it's ready, about 20 minutes after it comes to a boil. Yum !

This was the first time I made jam. It was simple and it turned out amazing! THe only thing I did different was omit the water and mixed the sugar and rhubabrb & let it stand in the ffridge for several hours (It was an unintentional necessity). I gave my mom a jar and she had it gone that night.

I was trying to find a good pectin recipe because I've never been a fan of using jell-o in a jam.  This one uses neither and it works wonderfully!  I used 1/3 c orange juice concentrate instead of the juice and zest because it didn't have enough orange flavor (and I forgot to buy an orange).  I think 1/3 c concentrate was too much though!  Next time maybe 1/4 c.

This jam is the perfect balance of sweet and tang. I made the recipe using 3 lbs. of rhubarb and adding 1/4 cup more sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon. I think this made for a more jammie consistency (adding more rhubarb).Fresh orange juice and zest is the key. I zested my orange over the pot to get those essential oil in the pot as well. I also figured if I was going to take the time to make jam I might as well process it in jars as well. I did that by sterilizing the jars then filling the hot jars with the hot jam and topping the jar with the lid and ring and processing the jars in a boiling hot water bath for 15 minutes. This is an excellent recipe I will make this again.Thanks!:)

This is the best recipe.  I however added a little cinnamon and about 1/2 package of pectin to thicken it..I tried it without the orange juice once and it wasn't as good.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Super yummy.  I have an excess of  rhubarb in my freezer and was wondering what to do with it when I came across this recipe.  I had roughly 24 cups of rhubarb and got almost 10 - 500ml jars from 2 batches.  I bag my rhubarb in 8-cup bags which is roughly the 2lbs as the recipe stated.  I used the suggestion of orange juice concentrate as my oranges didn't yield that much juice.  I also cut back on the sugar, adding half  stirring and then adding more until I got it right sweet/tart flavor I like.  I perked up the color by adding some red food coloring too.  It took awhile to make, but all in all, this is a keeper in my new jam recipe box.

Apparently orange peel & juice is very high in natural pectin and causes this recipe to jell.  I've also read that apples are high in pectin.  I think I will try a test. One w/ apples and one w/ oranges to see which taste I prefer and whether they set the same.

WOW! I love this!  I love that it can be made from start to finish in under an hour.  I love the full rhubarb flavor not diluted by the orange that is in it or any other fruit that are in so many recipes. My husband wanted a sweet enough jam for his taste, so since I increased the sugar until he thought it was enough (4 cups...and I know, holy cow!) to suit his taste.  I also increased the rhubarb by 1/2 cup.  Since one orange did not yield enough zest, instead of cutting up another orange I added a small amount (maybe half a handful) of orange bits of pulp in place of the missing 1 teaspoon of zest only for the added orange taste and the pectin.  It worked perfectly.  I always cook my jam by doing the cold plate test, because after one minute on the cold plate from the freezer you know that is how thick or thin the finished product will be.  This way I always know if I should add more water to thin it or cook it longer to thicken it.  Great stuff, will make sure I always have this on hand, might be hard since I know my son will surely steal it all when he comes to visit!

Excellent! Be sure to use fresh orange juice if you can, it makes a world of difference. My test batch went quickly, so I can't wait until next rhubarb season.

I needed to use up some rhubarb so thought - what the heck - give it a try. I didn't have any oranges, so I used apple juice instead as one reviewer mentioned as an acceptable substitue for a pectin source. Can I just say...hubby is licking the spoon and pot clean that I used to cooked it in as I type. I think this will be a keeper. Thank you for this super easy and delicious recipe!!

I made it as written except that I doubled the recipe. I loved the flavor with the orange and the fact that this recipe had all basic ingredients (nothing processed except the sugar).  However, my jam turned out rather runny.  :(  The doubled recipe made 12 jars (8oz jelly jars) with the 5 pounds of fresh rhubarb.

Excellent results & simple recipe to follow. I eliminated the water and instead premixed the rhubarb & sugar overnight which gave it a syrup consistency. Once boiled, I then reduced the medium-low heat cooking from 45 minutes to 30 minutes. Turned out with a very nice smooth medium thickness. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you!

Just made this Rhubarb Jam and it is fantastic, tastes just like the one my Grandma used to make.  At the end of the cooking time I took out a jar for myself and then added a 1/4 of a cup more sugar becasue my family likes it a bit sweeter than I do.  It makes 3 medium size jars so next time I will double the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe.  ENJOY!!

This was really good!  I did make some changes though, I doubled the batch and was short a little rhubard, so I added a can of crushed pineapple, drained the juice from it and used the pineapple juice in place of some of the water.  I also added one package of Certo to help with the thickening.  This is a really good recipe!  With doubling it, I got 12 3/4 250ml jars.

This tastes just like the filling in my grandma's rhubarb pie.  I did a half batch, otherwise following the recipe exactly, and ended up with one pint jar and a smaller jelly jar.    Really, really great!!

Perhaps I didn't have the full amount of rhubarb, but this had too much orange flavor for me.  It set up perfectly, though.  I would leave out some of the sugar to make it more tart, but that could really vary depending on your rhubarb.

Really tasty, but it didn't "jam" up.  More of a fruit sauce.  I suspect it's due to the long cooking time and will try it with a shorter cook time and a bit of pectin.  But the taste is really great!

Wonderful flavor.  It didn't really seem to thicken well for me, so I'm trying it again without the water as one reviewer suggested.  Has anyone let it cool down, ladled it into freezer jars, let it cool to room temp, and then put them in the freezer?  I'm going to try that today....:)

I had enough rhubarb to double the recipe. After reading the reviews, I omitted the juice/zest and used OJ concentrate plus a package of pectin. I processed it in a water bath. Not sure how long it takes to "set up", but the jam seems really runny to me.  Tasty, though.

This is good! It only took about 20 minutes of boiling to be done. I'm used to strawberry rhubarb jam, so this is pretty tart compared to the sweetness of the other...but it's good in it's own way!

Loved this, I made one batch with half of the zest (all I got from the orange) and it was good, made another batch without the zest because I did not have any more oranges and it was good too. The batch with the zest turned out more brown in color and the batch without was more green, not sure why but both tasted good. This is my rhubarb jam recipe from now on!

The best rhubarb jam I have ever made! The fresh orange juice and zest add a delicious brightness!  I did not put the full 2 cups of sugar in because I ran out and it tasted just fine!

I cut the recipe in half since I wasn't sure we would like it. It was very easy to make, thickened up nicely with the juice squeezed from an orange, and tastes yummy. I'll be keeping this one!

We made this recipe using three pounds of fresh rhubarb because that is what we picked that day. The recipe stayed the same otherwise. This is so easy and delicious. We used Cara Cara oranges for the zest and the juice. It's a hit with everyone who has tasted it.

Delicious.  First time I made jam and it was super easy.  Next time I think I will use a little less sugar and orange zest.  Would like it to be a little thicker but the kiddos loved it.

This is great!  Easy to make and if you like marmalade (not too sweet and made with orange peel) you will love this jam.  No need for pectin.  Something a little different to do with my bumper crop of rhubarb.  I would make a bigger batch next time.

This was very simple to make, but it has a strong orange flavor (more than I was anticipating). It's great for my husband who loves marmalade, but I was hoping for a pure rhubarb flavor.

Rhubarb + Orange = Delicious! I love rhubarb—and the fact that this doesn't need pectin or gelatin or strawberries or anything else. The orange zest and juice just give the rhubarb flavor a sunny little boost.

Ammmmmmmmmazing! This turned out absolutely delicious. Only change I made was using half rhubarb and half strawberries. I let it boil for the full 45 minutes and then let it cool on the counter for about 10 minutes before putting in jars. The consistency was more like a fruit spread or preserve rather than jam, but I prefer that more.

Delicious! I would recommend reducing the sugar like some other reviewers have mentioned, and squeezing your own orange juice is a must. Also, watch it...the cook time was much too long for my batch. We ate it right up, and there was no need to jar it, we just spooned it into a Tupperware! It was gone by the next night.

I love this jam! The orange juice and orange zest make it awesome. Like another reviewer, I mixed my rhubarb and sugar and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before cooking, and didn't need to add any water. I also added half a pack of low-sugar pectin to help it set up more firmly. I mixed some of mine with some strawberry jam that I made, so I had strawberry rhubarb jam too, and that was also really good.

This is the third year making this recipe. Love it because it's simple, tasty and you really don't need to do the whole sterilized jar thing if you're making a small quantity. Keeps very well in the refrigerator for a couple of months. Buon Appetito!

I made this recipe twice, last year to use the last cutting of rhubarb, and this year with an abundant first cutting. I didn’t mess with the ingredients. It cooks until thickened, which is 20-30 minutes for my area. (Altitude can make a difference in cooking time.) what I appreciate most about this recipe is that it uses less sugar and no pectin and that is similar to the European jam and recipes that I use. Thanks for sharing! It is a very yummy recipe!

amazing recipe! I used green rhubarb growing in my garden and doesn't change the colour green. I doubled the recipe and reduced for 3 hours, it made it thicker but obviously you get less. Ended up with 7 full 280ml jars. My jam snob friends say it's the best rhubarb  jam they've had!

I love the taste of this jam... It is the perfect balance between sweet and sour. It shows off the best that rhubarb can be. But, although I followed the recipe exactly as written, I thought that it was much thinner than I thought it would be. Not at all like a butter.  I also had to add some red food colouring because otherwise this jam would have been a nasty grey/green colour that my kids would reject. The exact measurements resulted in 6 1/2 pints of jam. On the whole, I would definitely make this jam again (because of the amazing taste and to use up our fresh rhubarb), but I might add some sour cherries for the natural red colour, I'd not add water, and I would let it cook down much longer, perhaps 75 minutes. I may also consider blending the mixture before cooking to eliminate the fibres for a better "butter" texture.

Delicious!

I didn't have a lot of rhubarb (a little over 2 cups uncooked) so I scaled down the recipe as I could. 

It turned out perfect!

I only had 13 oz of rhubarb to work with so I only added 1 cup of sugar, a splash of water and 1 teaspoon oj concentrate.

Very good!  I used 8 cups of rhubarb and 1 3/8 cups sugar.  With the addition of orange zest and a dash of cloves and ginger, it smelled like Christmas!  Didn't have orange juice, but the 1/2 cup water seemed to work fine.

If this didn't taste so much like orange marmalade I would give it 5 stars. I like orange marmalade so I liked it but the orange flavor was overpowering the rhubarb. I used the fresh squeezed juice from the orange, maybe I should have used ready made orange juice. It jelled nice and is easy to eat though. Thanks for the easy recipe. I would make it again but might try a new rhubarb jam recipe before this one again.

I really loved this recipe, It was my first time trying this and it was awesome I used half a package pectin though to make it jell more then what it did w/o the pectin... none the less I went out just to pick more rhubarb to, make this again and try to save some of it ") P.S it tastes a lot better if you use a fresh orange with this and it's zest

This turned out so delicious!  We used it as ham but also on pork chops. Absolutely lovely texture. I used 2/3 of the sugar so it did not turn out quite as thick. It’s a favorite!

Fantastic and easy. Doesn’t set hard like a normal jam but is delicious just like a sweet spread. Otherwise could be kept as a base to mix with plain yoghurt or go on top of granola. 

I added 4 drops of real vanilla, a good chunk of ginger and cinnamon for a bit extra taste. 

Also cut down the sugar to 2/3rds if recipe as full 2 cups was too sweet for me. 

Delicious!

had the rhubarb but didn't have the orange juice, but gave it a try just encreasing the water, basically, enough water to cover the cut-up rhubarb, cooked it outside on the gas grill attached to the BBQ, cooked it until it stopped steaming, so most of the liquid was gone. My Mom used to make rhubarb jam, never a fan.  this has made me a convert it was great.

OMG This jam is awesome. Just the right amount of tartness, with a touch of sweet. I used double the amount of orange zest. That was the only change I made. I will be making more for gift giving at Christmas.

Delicious recipe! The orange zest and juice took it to a new level, and it's quite good. It's just sweet enough and like all rhubarb jams/stewed rhubarb - it's not too "jelly" like, but slightly on the liquidy side. As a result, it spreads easy on toast and bread but is also good for adding on top of a scoop of ice cream!

Cooked up in no time and love that I didn't have to go find my pectin. Couldn't go 5 stars as it turned out sweeter then I expected, but will cut down the sugar to 1 cup next time.

I made this last year and ran out of it in late winter, much to my disappointment. This year I'm making a double batch. The only thing I change is that I substitute the water with more orange juice. It's awesome.

Yummy!  I used lemon zest & juice instead of orange since that’s what I had and it turned out great!  Also added a dash of cinnamon just for fun.    I thought it was a bit sweet so will cut back on the sugar next time.

Loved it!   I've tried a few different recipes and this one is the best.  I did make 2 changes.  I like my rhubarb jam very tart and a little thick so I cut the sugar and water in half.  Also only needed to cook it for about 25 minutes.

Tasty and easy. I love the combination of orange and rhubarb, but wanted  more orange flavor and added a little orange extract at the end. Next time I'll add the grated orange peel near the end of the cooking time to keep the flavor fresher and will use the juice and peel of 2 oranges rather than the water. I also thought the jam needed a little acidity and added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice at the end of the cooking time. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of butter to keep the jam from foaming. I've seen in other reviews that others added a little cinnamon. I'll try that next time along with a little nutmeg.

This turned out great!  I did add cinnamon and 1/2 box of pectin, as others suggested.   It only made 4 jelly jars of jam, so I hope my rhubarb keeps growing so that I can make another batch.

Absolutely delicious! I got a tiny bit less than 6 cups for my two pounds of rhubarb. Perfectly sweet and tart- just as it should be. I processed the 4 half pints I got out of the recipe in my boiler canner for 15 min (3000ft altitude). I will make this again and again!

I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough rhubarb and used 3 medium sized mandarin oranges (so I probably used a little more juice than the recipe called for). It turned out perfectly sweet with a hint of tartness and really nice texture. My husband loves it and wants to try it on some ice cream.

I made this somewhat exactly as stated.  I accidently misread the directions and only put one pound of rhubarb.  I grated two oranges and used the juice from one.  It turned out sweeter (obviously) than I expected BUT it was still really good!  My first time ever canning but I did it with this recipe.

I wish I had listened to some of the reviewers! It was a little too sweet and a little too orangey for me, but I love just rhubarb. I used 10 cups rhubarb, which I had frozen from fresh. I mixed it with the sugar and let thaw. Omitted the water. Turned out thick as the photo, not runny at all, was great warm over ice cream! Next time will decrease zest to 1-1.5 t, fresh squeezed oj to scant 1/4 c, sugar to 1.5 c and see how it goes. Thanks for the recipe!

I've never made jam before.. I used 10 cups of rhubarb, 1 whole pectin package and didn't ladle... very excited to see how it turns out! Hope a whole pck or pectin wasn't too much but the store had no orange zest?!?!? Oh and I got 6 250ml mason jars. Suggestions???

The flavor is there but this is definitely NOT jam. This has the consistency of sauce. It's frustrating to go through the effort to cook and can something that is described as a jam but actually be a sauce. I made it according to directions, it never thickened or set up. I opened the jars, recooked it, adding pectin this time and it still hasn't set up, even though it's cold and hours have gone by since I canned it the second time around. This is a rhubarb orange sauce, not a rhubarb jam. This is not a recipe for jam.

My jam did not set. The only differences from the recipe I made were extra orange zest and eventually, a longer cook (because it didn't seem thick enough. Any thoughts?

It was very zippy! I thought the orange was a bit over powering, next time I'll either reduce the amount of orange juice, or I'll press some straight out of the fruit to see if it makes it helps make that flavor more mild. Mine did not gel.

Loved this recipe.  I love rhubarb and don't like when the taste gets masked with strawberries.  I'm terrible at following recipes, so had to change this up a bit.  Instead of sugar, I added about 3/4 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup of honey.  I added much more orange zest, just because I love it in recipes, and used more orange juice instead of the water.  Delicious blend of sweet and tart.  Will make again, when my rhubarb regrows!  

One note, my rhubarb was green, so the final product wasn't very pretty.  Added just a few drops of red food color for looks.

So easy to make.  I thought that there would not be enough sugar in this recipe, but it was just right, giving just the right amount of sweetness, keeping the taste of the rhubarb to shine through.

Loved this recipe.  I had lots of rhubarb to use this year, so I made two batches of this to give away at Christmas. The only thing I did differently on my second batch was to add a bit of pink food coloring to make it look prettier.

It was good, and I love the tanginess. But it took forever to get thick, might try adding a bit of pectin next time. If you use green rhubarb also it looks bad kind of looks brown and unappealing.  I added red food coloring to make it look as good as it tastes!

Made it just as the recipe stated and it turned out great. Seemed thin at first but thickened after refrigerated. The only down side for me was that my rhubarb variety happened to be green instead of red, so it isn't very pretty, but it still tastes great. Also, I froze mine instead of canning, which is a lot easier!

I followed suggestions of other reviews and omitted the water. The jam set up perfectly. I got five 8 ounce jars of jam. Definitely will make again.

Had a rhubarb fiasco the other day, and this was the second attempt with the huge stalks from the garden.  Made half the recipe and less than half the sugar, is exactly as promised, thickened up to an apple butter consistency and is delicious.

This was delicious!  I am a rookie canner, and this was my first time making jam or preserves. It wasn't as thick as I thought it would be, but it tastes great and I think it will thicken up as it cools.  The color was completely different in my batch - more orange than red - that may have to do with the color of the rhubarb. I love that it isn't too sweet. I followed the directions exactly, and will make it again.

I made it exactly as per the recipe.  I liked it OK but it tastes exactly like marmalade.  The orange is overpowering the rhubarb flavour.  It is nice and tasty but I think I'll look for another recipe that doesn't have orange in it.  Oh...and it made 5 jars (250mL or half pint jars).

Not a regular jam maker so I needed more pectin. Came out good though! 
1 lb. rhubarb =  3 cups chopped. Per Connies note. Thanks!

I am not a fan of rhubarb, however, this recipe has changed my mind. It is extremely easy to make and the orange zest and fresh squeezed juice adds a delightful flavour to it.  My family can't get enough of it.

Just made it.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 for a trial batch.  I made a few adjustments.  I didn't have any oranges.  I juiced a tangerine.  I cooked brought it to a boil, reduced to medium and let it simmer about 10 minutes until the rhubarb was cooked.  I added 1 TBL of chia seeds and a drop of Wild Orange essential oil.  Stirring occasionally as it cools.  Love it!

This is a mad good recipe.  Very easy.  I used some strawberries to make up for shortage of rhubarb.  My new favorite easy jam.

I was raised with rhubarb sauce. My mother used orange extract if an orange was not available. However,I simply slice the rhubarb, add a bit of water and sugar to taste and cook until it is thickened. It is wonderful on toast or biscuits.
