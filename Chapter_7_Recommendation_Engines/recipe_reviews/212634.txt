I absolutely loved this recipe although I made several changes.  Because I have small children I normally do not cook with wine, so I reduced the wine to 1/2 cup, and used 1/2 cup of beef broth as well.  I also added 1 stalk celery, a mix of seasonings including italian, one package onion soup mix, 5 small red potatoes cut into quarters and 1/2 cup of peas at the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  I served it over buttered egg noodles with a loaf of french country bread.  YUMM!!!

I made this exactly according to recipe and it's great.  I served it with mashed potatoes since there is quite a bit of gravy.

YUMMY! This was very very good. I did change a bunch of stuff tho, but it was still incredible. I didn't brown the meat because i figured it would become overcooked since it was going to cook for 10 hours. I covered it in the flour and pepper and put it in the bottom. I didn't have red wine so i used cherry wine, and i just added basil, oregano,cumin,white pepper, and this complete seasoning instead of the standard italian seasoning. I also added potatoes, sugar snap peas, leeks, capers, and a can of diced garlic and basil tomatoes w/the sauce. I threw in some chorizo sausage and added some lemon juice to give it some acidity. It was INCREDIBLE! We absolutely could not get enough! def a staple in this kitchen from now on.

This dish was delicious! I made it last week and loved it sooo much I'm making it again this week. This time I am going to add a few potatos in there too.

I make this recipe exactly as written with one exception: My hubby does not like cooked carrots, so I use red-skinned new potatoes (halved) instead. What a fabulous recipe! He absolutely LOVES this stew, and has asked me to make it on several occasions. I follow the directions exactly and this meal comes out great every time. Thanks Campbell's!

Very tasty... but definitely needed salt!  I ended up adding about 1/2 teaspoon of salt at the end because the broth was quite bland.

Really good. We put over rice. We will double the recipe next time, and triple the sauce.

Fantastic! We had enough for two meals, the first time I didn't serve a starch on the side and it seemed something was missing. The second time I made rosemary red potatos and served the stew poured over them, which was absolutely perfect! I would make this all winter long!

This was missing something, we all agreed.  I don't believe I'll make it again to try to figure out what it was though.

We really liked this stew.  I changed it slightly.  Doubled everything!  Didn't brown the meat.  Just thew it in the cooker.  In the end it was just too soupy so I took about a third a cup of the stew/soup and mixed it with about a tablespoon of flour (no lumps please).  Added this back to the pot and turned to high.  Let cook for an additional 30 minutes and it thickened up.  Needs some salt too.  Served over rice.  Very hearty meal!

It was good...but didn't make it as a stew.  I used same amount of liquids then added some flour to thicken gravy.  Made a pot roast out of it.  It was good.  My family enjoyed it.

I made this stew tonight and it didn't take long to disappear! I added frozen peas and green beans to the crockpot an hour before serving time. This is a great recipe that is now a family favorite.

Hit with family.  Per other reviews I added a packet of onion soup mix.  I doubled the onion soup can because I had a larger size roast.  I also used a can of beef broth instead of water.

I thought this was just ok. Don't get me wrong, I will make it again when it is cold outside and I need something to warm me up, but the flavor was lacking a bit. I ate it over mashed potatoes. May try a different type of wine next time. It will def. fill you up!

We liked this. It was easy and the meat came out very tender. My only complaint is that it was a bit bland. This was easily remedied by adding salt (about 1/2 tsp). After browning the meat and removing it from the pan, I deglazed the pan with some of the wine and scraped off the fond, then poured this into the slow cooker. Don't want to waste those flavorful brown bits! We served this over egg noodles, but it would be good with mashed potatoes too.

This turned out great!  Another one that the kids and hubby raved about.  I used 16 oz of beef boullion and a sliced onion instead of the Campbell's soup.  I had fresh green beans to use up and threw those in during the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I let it cook for 10 hours while I was at work and it turned out perfect!

Pretty good. The only changes I made was 1/2c burgandy, 1/2c sherry because I ran out of the burgandy. I also added two red potatoes. It was pretty good, smelled great too. Would I make it again? not likely, but definately worth a try. The broth wasn't as thick as I'd like, add some cornstartch if you want it thicker.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because there were several changes I made to the recipe. There was not enough salt as some reviewers said..so I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder before coating with flour and browning in the oil(not enough). I didn't have a roast or stew meat so used carne adada meat(thin and cut in strips) so it only took 3 hrs to cook, 1 on high and 2 on low...I also didn't have the condensed soup, red wine, pearl onions or regular mushrooms or carrots, so I used beef broth, sherry wine,  chopped onions and portabello mushrooms and baby carrots. I found it needed alot more liquid than stated. I was really glad I had homemade beef broth on hand. It smelled amazing while it was cooking and tasted great for dinner. I served it over egg noodles and the family all loved it.

This is a good starter recipe.  I added 2 potatoes and canned vegetable as well.  Since I added 3 cans of vegetables I added a cup of water when I put it all together so it wouldn't get dry or thick too soon.  I was a little worried after I added the wine because it was very strong but it all cooked out and the end result was very good.  I served it with biscuits.

I didn't have pearl onions so I quartered half of a yellow onion. Also I cooked on high for 5 hrs, not low for 11. Easy, delicious, and everything came out very tender.

I made this exactly as listed, and it was very much the worst stew I've ever eaten. My son hated it, my husband only ate a few pieces of meat, and I couldn't finish my bowl either. I will not be making this again.

I used everything but the whole small onions (chopped up half a full-sized yellow onion instead) and it came out wonderfully.

Awesome recipe.  I made it for my hubby & parents, and we all really liked it.  Just a note though, we wound up with 2 extra for dinner, and I then wished I'd doubled the recipe.  Even if it had just been the 4 of us, leftovers would have been GREAT!

This is an amazing recipe for beef stew. It adds a degree of sophistication but is so simple to make. I did add some celery and green beans. The flavor is fantastic.

Added garlic and made the sauce creamy just before serving. husband said he wanted it more creamy not brothy. Takes a little prep the night before. Nice recipe for a cold Winter dinner coming home from work.
