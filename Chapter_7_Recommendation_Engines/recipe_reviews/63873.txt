Fast & delicious! My husband and I love spicy food and I served this with roasted tomato salsa and cheddar cheese as garnish. A great soup course for six adults, or main course for 2-3 adults. If you don't care much for whole beans in your soup, try pureeing 2 cans of beans instead of one.

It was ok, but missing something. Made it exactly as directed. We both had to eat it with a good size heap of sourcream, shredded cheddar cheese, and salsa. With out those three things we wouldn't have been able to eat as much as we did.

I was very happy with this recipe even if though I didn't puree the can of beans. On leftover day, I threw in a cup or so of leftover cooked rice while reheating. Absolutely delicious both ways!

Basic recipe was fair to good.  Second time I made it I added 2 oz. of salt pork, diced, and sauteed that in the oil.  I substituted sour cream for the salsa and that did the trick.  Next time I may add a little hot sauce for some extra kick.

If you want EASY restaurant style black bean soup this is the perfect recipe!  I've made this recipe several times and have made a few adjustments of my own.  I use an additional can of whole beans and about half a can of chicken or vegetable broth.
