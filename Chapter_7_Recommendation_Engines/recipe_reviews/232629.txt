I followed the recipe pretty close (more curry! and other stuff adjusted by what was on hand), and this is delicious.

Original poster here.  casadam suggested that the dish "needed more flavor."  The recipe calls for only "1 teaspoon curry powder, or more to taste"; I *always* add more -- closer to a tablespoon (or more, sometimes!).  Add curry powder and keep tasting until it's enough flavor for you.  Plus, there's no salt included in the recipe, but I usually salt once it's on the plate.

felt like it needed more flavor.
