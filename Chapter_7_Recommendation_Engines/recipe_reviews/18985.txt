Hi Karen
Excellent trifle.  Exactly like my mother-in-laws.
Now I don't have to ask her to make it anymore...plus she would never give me the recipe.
I guess that's a mother-in-law thing!!!
Thanks again
PS My husband thanks you too!

I don't use port flavored gelatin but sherry instead. I use either chopped up angel cake or 'Ladys Fingers Sponge', place them in a bowl first and soak with sherry (or port) and I use a strawberry or raspberry jelly (jello). Depending on what state you live in, I know Publix & Albertson's in FL have a British section that sell custard in powder or ready made version or you can make your own custard. Trifle is so easy to make as you can tweak it to suit your palette.

Hey lovestocook. You can find Bird's custard powder at British speciality food stores, or in the British section of the ethnic food aisle (if your store has one). I've never seen port wine flavored gelatin but when I make trifle, I use raspberry jello. Works great. Hope that helps.

A light, pretty dessert. Next time I'd pour some liquid over the cake - the cake stayed a bit dry. I didn't have port wine gelatin, I used strawberry gelatin and replaced 1/3 c. of the liquid with wine. I also doubled the custard - next time I'd triple it, since the trifle could have used more custard.
