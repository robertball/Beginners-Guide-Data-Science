I made these exactly as directed, but the shortbread crust is not correct, in my opinion. It's way too dry, and too thick compared to the caramel and chocolate layers. I think there is too much flour, and maybe it needs an egg yolk or something? I knew that something wasn't right after I pressed it into the pan, and tried to prick it with a fork. There was no pricking it with a fork, as it just flaked up from the flour. The caramel and chocolate layers were tasty, and the right thickness, in my opinion. I ended up cutting these into squares, and using a serrated knife to trim off some of the shortbread layer that was too dry and thick. After doing that, they were edible. I'd make these again, but find a different recipe for the shortbread layer. Sorry!

This is a really good and easy recipe! The shortbread is more crunchy, like a Twix, and the caramel made with sweetened condensed milk is very good. Wow! I'll make these again.
