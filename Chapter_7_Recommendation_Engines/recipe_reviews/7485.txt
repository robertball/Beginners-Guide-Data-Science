I've had many Bienenstich in Germany over the years, and this recipe didn't compare. Its hard to find the actual duplicate!!

Ok, here is my take on the Bienenstich. I baked it two extra minutes because it seemed doughy under the glaze in the center. I should have taken it out two minutes sooner. So, I felt it was a bit dry but not ruined by any means. I made this for a German gathering and was applauded. They said it was very similar to the Bienenstich's (I guess they differ from bakery to bakery there)in Germany. So over all, this is a very good recipe and I will make it again now that I know better....

I went to a lecture by 2 German bakers and they had this to sample.  This recipe tasted as good as that one.  Tips - be sure to have the warm water to dissolve the yeast no warmer than a baby's bottle and sprinkle the yeast on top of the water.  Mine almost quadrupled in quantity.  I also added 1 tsp of sugar to the yeast. Make sure everything that it calls for to be at room temperature is exactly that.  My butter was a little too cool but I put it in anyway - that was a mistake.  It all curdled.  I had to throw it away and start over.  This is pretty labor intensive but in the end I was very happy with it.  Just follow the directions closely.

I lived in Germany for most of my life and have had both bakery and homemade Bienenstich and the only thing this cake has that is similar to real Bienenstich is the almond topping (once a few more almonds are added to fully cover it). Bienenstich should have a very creamy filling, all through out. It really shouldn't be very cake like at all. Almost like a true combo of whipped cream, pastry cream and a very light cake. And then of course the almond crust that covers it in a creme brulee style. Mmmm!!! The only reason I'm giving this one star is because despite the fact that it is NOT Bienenstich it actually is a good cake. But since it took me half a day to make I can't say I will keep the recipe.

I've made this twice, several years apart, and I've gotten rave reviews from my family both times.  Thanks for a great recipe! :-D

You cannot bake this at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. Mine started to burn at 18 mins. Try 375!
The recipe for the filling is a standard cornstarch pudding and has the correct amount of milk; you just have to cook and stir continuously until it is thick.
My cake developed hills and gullies, but I suspect that was because I didn't knead it for 20 minutes. Considering all the work, this was not worth it.

We liked this, though missed the crunshiness on the topping (followed the recipe to the letter)

Fantastic cake! Much more time to make than stated and didn't realize it was 2 cakes! Also some instructions not spelled out, so played it by ear and still came out great!! Will definitely be a repeat in our home.
