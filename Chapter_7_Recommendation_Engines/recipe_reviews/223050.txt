My wife and I made these last night. My wife is typically not a sloppy joe person, but she and I both absolutely loved them. Great flavor with a little bit of zip, and not overly heavy like some sloppy joes can be. We cooked the turkey a couple of extra minutes at the start, and only added 1/4 cup of extra water later in the recipe just to make sure the mixture had enough liquid to get some good cooking time. We had them with some watermelon, made for a great meal.

If you are anything like me you often cruise these reviews to see what can be added or left off. I don't have a functioning stove so let's start right there. I made this in the crockpot. I probably wouldn't add the water next time because it came out really watery but OMG, it's so freakin good! I added some green pepper cause I had to use it, in lieu of brown sugar I used 1T white sugar with 1T maple syrup, but otherwise I cooked it as directed. I ate it straight out of the pot without cheese, green onion, or the roll. I will make this again, and again, and again. Maybe it will even make it onto a bun or two ;)

Hubby is giving 'Sheriff John's" recipe 5 stars!  (Is this another Sheriff John recipe?)  LOL...He is a happy man.  This took me a bit longer than stated - probably not the recipes fault, it was just me wanting to make sure the seasoning was gently cooked into the meat.  I served this on a toasted whole wheat bun with spicy sweet potato fries.  It was a hit!

It's obvious that this recipe was designed by a chef. The combination of ingredients, even the seemingly unconventional ones such as cocoa powder, make this recipe sing. The sweet, almost exotic flavor make it a very interesting recipe. That it's made from ground turkey and as such, presents a healthier eating option, is purely a bonus.

Chef John, my family loved your Turkey Sloppy Joes.  I increased the recipe to make 24 servings to feed mine and two other families with whom I do a weekly meal swap.  My family, including my daughter who does not like traditional Sloppy Joes, agreed this recipe is a repeat.  Bravo from one turkey lover to another!

What a delicious recipe. A very nice change from what has become very boring sloppy joe night.  Everyone in the family devours it. I double it to feed our 3 almost grown kids, and there is enough leftover for hubby's lunch the next day.

I wasn't in the mood to cook tonight. Made this recipe following Chef John's video, adding ingredients to taste rather than following this recipe. I was surprised it tasted so good considering the amount of effort I put in. That rarely happens! Don't omit the cayenne or cocoa.

I made it tonight and it was very good!! I made some changes though; In place of water I used a 1/4 cup of red cooking wine. I also added a can of petite tomatoes and a couple teaspoons of Dijon mustard, one teaspoon of white vinegar and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Note: I increased my ground turkey to 3lbs. Delicious!!! Thanks, Chef John!

By far the best Sloppy Joe, Tom, 
Dick or Harry I've ever had - the consistency was perfect, maybe because of the water? The ONLY thing I will change next time is to cut the amt of sugar in half. Too lazy to buy buns, just toasted a piece of whole wheat bread and spooned the mixture over; excellent!!

I am sorry. My family all agreed the sauce tasted more like Beef Stroganoff than a Sloppy Joe. We grabbed this recipe because of high stars and followed it exactly. Saw a review about adding vinegar and I wholeheartedly agree... that was what was lacking.

Recipe was pretty decent, except I made a few changes! First or all I added fresh minced garlic and a half of a chopped green bell pepper when I sautéed the onion.  This definitely enhanced the flavor! Then I also added a couple tablespoons of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce when I added the ketchup, as well as a can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. Also probably a teaspoon of yellow mustard was added. I omitted the cocoa powder because I didn't have any, and I don't think I really needed it!

Chef John these were really good! Normally, your recipes are a little too hot for me. So, I just did 1/8 tsp. of cayenne. I learned from experience on that. I used 1 lb of all white ground turkey meat and organic ketchup from Trader Joes. I suppose they would be only better tasting, if I used a fattier turkey choice and sweeter ketchup. I also only had approximately 1/4 cup left of green onion and it worked fine. I got enough filling for 8 buns instead of the 6. As this was quite easy, I would make them again. ty

Made it tonight and it was a hit. Added garlic and celery salt. Didn't have brown sugar so I used a sprinkle of Splenda to give it a little sweetness.

None of my family likes sloppy joes but they all loved this. It was a bit spicy so I would cut down on the cayenne a smudge. I did tell them that it was "loose meat hamburgers" instead of sloppy joes...lol.

I've never eaten Sloppy Joe's, but my nephew Pete likes this recipe so I tried it.  I would NOT change a thing.  I love the onions sauteed in real butter!  This is a 5 Star Keeper.  Thanks Chef John and thanks to nephew Pete!

Very good, but just a shade too sweet for my taste.  If I do this again, I think I'll do a little less sugar than called for here.

These are better than the sloppy joe's made with ground beef imo. They do have a mild flavor. Only change I made was to use only about 1/2 cup of h20 to simmer.

These are without a doubt the best  sloppy joes I've ever had. I'm not generally a fan of ground turkey, especially when ground beef is available but these are perfection. Keep up the great work Chef John!

Fantastic! I did switch the brown sugar to Splenda brown sugar, skipped the cheese and green onions-I cut calories where ever I can.  And cheese on sloppy Joe's wasn't appealing or seem necessary, didn't need it. It was so good my sister who hates ground turkey dishes, ate 2 sandwiches and raved about the flavor!! It's a keeper!

Definitely add the vinegar and garlic powder that was recommended by the top review. If you do that, your family will ask for this OVER and OVER and OVER!

I just made this for my kids, it turned out delicious! The only change I made was that I used tomato paste instead of ketchup because I didn't have any, but it was still good. Thank you Chef John for sharing your recipe!

Really good. The kids (6 and 9) loved them. They each had two giant buns. It was a really good sloppy joe and I don't think they even noticed it was turkey. I found it lighter than beef, which was nice.

This was great! My picky husband and son didn't even know it was turkey until I told them. Perfect amount of spice. I served the boys on sourdough rolls, which have a great texture for the sauce. I had mine in a lettuce leaf to be "low carb". Made as instructed and it was perfect.

I don't eat ground turkey, and the smell when I was cooking this was making me queasy.  I was shocked when my husband said it was the best thing he's ever had and proceeded to eat all 1.25 pounds of it.  Guess it was just that good!  Followed the recipe except for the cayenne pepper since I wanted to make sure my 10-year old would try some... and she did!

Delicious! Made mostly as directed except added a diced green pepper when browning the meat. Slightly misread the instructions and added the meat, onion and half cup water all at once, didn't seem to matter though. Served with some tater tots. Will definitely make again!

Nice blend of flavors. Added a diced jalapeno pepper into the onions for some extra heat. A real winner, Chef John.

When I think of sloppy joes I don't think spicy and these were spicy. My kids wouldn't eat them and normally they love them. I used half of what to recipe called for. Disappointing!

Perfection! BF and I loved it! I didn't have cheddar,used Havarti-Jalapeno. Used white wine instead of water. Next time 1/2 cup ketchup, not 3/4. But that's just me. The recipe is GREAT. 2nd time I made it....I used 3/4 ketchup, but a tad less brown sugar. No one NEEDS to change this recipe....they may want to but it's really perfect as is. I've stopped changing it.

I absolutely loved this recipe as I wanted something for ground turkey...this was a winner! I didn't have butter so I used olive oil and added some minced garlic and 1 TBS apple cider vinegar for a kick.
I noticed the 1/2 cup of water made it to soupy so I won't add it next time.

I wasn't sure I would like the cocoa powder, but this was good.  My only changes were to use just a sprinkle of cayenne because my kids don't like spicy food, and I skipped the green onion.  Also I used a small chunk of smoked cheddar, diced.
Kids ate on toasted buns, I ate it on a bed of kale because I'm weird and healthy that way.

Oh my goodness,we loved these Sloppy Toms!! Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only having 1 lb of turkey and using monterey cheese because it was the only cheese on hand. Chef John's recipes are always delicious.

I typically put less onion than called for in most of my cooking, and I'm glad I did that here, as 1/2 an onion was more than enough for me. The only other variation I made was adding about another 1/4 cup of ketchup after tasting it at the start of the long simmering process. At that point I felt the onion was dominating the flavor more than I wanted, so I just squeezed in some more ketchup and it balanced out perfectly to my taste. It had a nice spicy heat that lingered, but not a real sharp initial bite to it. The turkey was very tender and moist, and I didn't miss the beef at all. I only had to add about 1/2 cup of water over the whole simmering time, which I did for a little over 30 minutes. I also made this in a 5 qt dutch oven instead of a skillet/saute pan, because my stove/burners are not level and I worried that it would slop over the side. I think it made the simmer take a bit longer, but it was easier to control and stir without making a mess.

This was a very good way to eat turkey. In fact, my husband loved it- he loves spicy things. I gave it 4 stars because, as printed. it was a bit too hot for my son and I. We'll definitely make it again, probably with a pinch less cayenne.

Personal note - skip onions for the kids.  Instead,  caramelize and crisp some onion in oven to put on top.

I've made this several times.  I love spicy food, so added a little more cayenne pepper than the recipe.  Once on the bun, I like to top with canned, fried onions to add some crunch.  Delicious!

We liked this recioe.   Next time I will add a fraction of the brown sugar and increase the Worstershjre sauce.  Also, 1/2 t. Of cayenne would overpower this for me, I added about 1/8 t. And that was just enough heat for me.

We make this often. It's easy and scrumptious, and has a unique tangy flavor. I usually add a little tomato paste to give it more of a tomato flavor, and I also double the Worcestershire just because I like it.  (Don't add extra cocoa though -- I tried that and it tasted too chocolatey.) I find you don't have to simmer it for as long as the recipe says.

Best sloppies ever!
A few changes:
olive oil vs butter
dehydrated onion vs fresh
tomato paste vs ketchup
no sugar
Definitely making again!

I had only 1lb. ground turkey so I made minor adjustments.  I agree with other reviewers--don't add so much water in the beginning.  You can add later if needed.  Why so skimpy on the Worcestershire?  I added a little more.  Turnec out kind of sweet but I liked it.  A less sweet ketchup may help tamper the Sweet.  Next time I'll use better and leaner ground turkey, too.   Good recipe!

They were delicious! I did half regular ketchup and half jalapeno ketchup for a little added spice; everyone LOVED them! I knew it was a home run when my stepson, who is a very picky eater asked for more!

How did anyone think this did not have any flavor????? This was good and HOT. Spicy HOT! Whoa! I think the cayenne to taste is exactly that! I put too much and gotta cut back next time! This is definitely one I will do again, just with less cayenne! Delicious!

Very good but a little too sweet. Go slow and add to taste at the end. Probably depends on the brand of ketchup! I used ground beef instead and drained the fat.

Very good flavor. Easy to make. Sometimes turkey can be bland but this has the perfect amount of heat. I will definitely keep this in the routine rotation.

Amazing! I came across this after my husband randomly asked for Sloppy Joe’s and I didn’t want the canned stuff. I added 2tsp white vinegar, like I read in the reviews, and 3 cloves of garlic. It’s perfect, not too spicy but with a kick. I was nervous about the cocoa, but it definitely added to the flavor. New weeknight staple!

I had my doubts using turkey, but this recipe is spot on.  Heck, even my kids loved it and I easily packed away two hefty sandwiches. I left out the green onions for the kids portion and sprinkled them on mine. I would suggest using close to the full 1 cups of water to get the sauce very thick.  

It doesn't matter if you use brand name ketchup and you can definitely add some zing by adding mustard or a touch or BBQ sauce to the mix as well, but this is perfect as is.

I will definitely make this again. I was searching for a day before grocery shopping lunch idea and came across this. I had to make a couple of changes due to lack of ingredients. I had to omit the green onions but will make sure I have them on hand for next time. I substituted gouda for the cheddar. I didn't have cocoa powder but did have unsweetened bakers chocolate so I used that. I also just used plain white bread. Only thing I would change on purpose is I will fully brown the turkey before adding other ingredients. I prefer a firmer bite. Don't be afraid to try it!

Made according to recipe other than that I browned the chicken rather than "boiled" it in water. Added only about 1/2 c of water as I added the ketchup. And only 1 tbsp of brown sugar.
Used my home-made ketchup

I always wanted to make sloppy joes but I stay away from tomatoes or anything very acidic in the can since the acid eats at the can cause the BPA and other toxins to get in the food. I was very pleased when I found sloppy Joe recipes on here. The family really loved it. I did not have the cocoa powder and it still turned out great.  I also left out the green onions and used slices of provolone cheese instead.Thanks for the simple recipe. It was easy to make and did not take long.

Love this recipe!  I'll never buy sloppy Joe sauce from a can again.   I add a tablespoon or so of tomato paste to bump up the tomato flavor and to give it some extra thickness.  I also double the Worcestershire sauce.  You don't have to cook it for quite as long as it says.

I've eaten and made quite a few Sloppy Joes in my life, and these were the best!  They had the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.  I only had 1 lb of ground turkey (rather than the 1 1/4 lb called for) but I used the amount of spices and other ingredients called for, so mine may have come out just a bit spicier than the recipe contemplated.  But this was fine with my family.    This will be my "go to" Sloppy Joe recipe from now on.

Best sloppy Joe I’ve eaten!  This was my favorite meat-based meal growing up. This was my 11&9 year olds’ 1st time eating sloppy Joe’s    they liked them.  My husbands not a big sloppy Joe fan, but he said it was good. That would be the best to get out of him. Who knew turkey could taste so good!  I used 2# of ground turkey  to feed 5 of us healthy portions, Two  of us having seconds.

We do not eat beef or pork in our home and I am constantly looking for American comfort recipes to satisfy my husband. I’ve made this many times. He loves it!! Said it was the best he’s EVER had! Made this for a friend of his who was also blown away! This is in my rotation of recipes! Thank you for a keeper that will definitely stay in the family.

it was pretty good. My first time to make sloppy joes with Turkey and without a prepared mix from the store. I liked that about too.I did add some vinger as some suggested.I added one very large red bell pepper.Thank you for making this recipe. Also its not too sweet which I liked. Very easy instructions. Thank you for sharing

Other than using olive oil instead of butter and adding green peppers, I followed the recipe as it is and was definitely not dissapointed. A quick and tasty dinner for a busy week night and healthier than your average sloppy joe. Will make again!

Delicious!! This is now the new "house" sloppy joe recipe! The addition of the cocoa powder is genius.
I thought it was odd to specify 1 1/4 lb of ground turkey as most packages are 1 lb. I used 1 lb only and went with half the water and  onions. I used red onion because that is what I had.

I added garlic and used 1/4 c bbq sauce and 1/2 c sugar free ketchup and nixed the cup of water at the end and it was a HIT. Definitely a winner.

My husband and I love this recipe.  It is delicious and easy.  I usually have all the ingredients which makes it nice to have this as a last minute meal when we don't know what we are having for dinner! I have made it just as the recipe states, no changes.

I liked this recipe for a weeknight meal.  I liked the flavors, I learned how not to dry out ground turkey, and will try this recipe again.  I did over use the black pepper, so it was spicy.

My family LOVED this recipe! I mean everyone in the family loved it-momentous occasion-LOL! I  followed the recipe verbatim except that after adding water with the turkey, I didn't need to add any more water. One other minor change-I added a little (1 T) apple cider vinegar. These sloppy joes were so good.

Absolutely delicious!  Will make again.  Not a huge turkey fan and this is a great recipe to add flavor.  We are dieting in this house and eating more turkey and chicken. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  

Love it!

Great recipe, my wife loved it and said it's a keeper. I love the flavor. I added just a little bit (1/4 cup) of pepper jack cheese in addition to the white cheddar. I also mixed a spoonful of corn starch in cold water and poured in maybe 2-3 tableblespoons of the mixture in the meat sauce to thicken it up after 20 minutes. I will make this again.

These are delicious! The cocoa powder gives it depth and is so good. I didn’t change a thing! We prefer to toast the buns and my kids add a slice of cheese.

Excellent!! I used ground chicken instead of Turkey (we’re not fans of turkey) and WOW  is this amazing !!! I double the amount of ketchup bc it looked too bland/beige  (& not like traditional sloppy joes).  Adding more ketchup or even tomato paste gave it a more rich look. My husband had NO clue he was eating ground chicken. I didn’t tell him bc he wouldn’t touch if he knew it was ground chicken. The cocoa is a must. You won’t know its in there but made it once w/out cocoa (forgot to buy it) and something was lacking. I also added a tablespoon of applecider vinegar (like other reviewer) & it kept chicken juicy & not dry.  This recipe doesn’t make a lot (there are 3 of us & there was barely enough).  Truly amazing by how good this was!

Excellent recipe. I never really enjoyed the super tomato-ey taste of the canned stuff, so this was a welcome change. A little sweet, a little complex, and great the second day. I made the recipe as written and wouldn’t change a thing.

This was edible but I probably won't make again. Followed recipe exactly and it came out  tasting way too much like onion. All around, not a favorite.

I make this recipe at least once a month; it's quick and tasty.  I like a little stronger tomato flavor, so I usually add a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.

This is in my regular rotation - it is truly excellent comfort food and we all love it! Often we serve it or mix in quinoa and green beans on the side - no bun for a healthier option.

I have never ever rated a recipe and this was so disgusting I had to.  Super super duper sweet I had to throw the whole thing out.  I even cut the brown sugar by half a tablespoon and it was still that bad!

I followed the instructions exactly and it was way too sweet & not enough of the “tomato-ish” base that is in most sloppy joe recipes. I had to doctor it up and added about 1 tsp minced garlic, a pinch of celery salt, & a little apple cider vinegar and it turned out much better. Would definitely make again just reducing the Brown sugar by half.

I was so excited to find a quality recipe that uses turkey instead of ground beef.  I made exactly as instructed though I found that the turkey cooked and sauce reduced a lot sooner than the time listed.  I added a bit more of the white cheddar cheese today when I warmed it up as I find it helps calm down the spiciness from the cayenne.  I also just put the buns in the toaster rather than heat up the oven.  This recipe will replace my old beef focused one as it's less greasy and more flavorful!

I was super surprised by all of the positive reviews after making these myself.  They're easy, for sure, but very much lacking in flavor.  In my opinion, they had no "tang factor" like you expect from sloppy joes, so I doctored them up with a tablespoon or two of cider vinegar and a couple of teaspoons of prepared yellow mustard.   I'll be sticking with my other standard allrecipes sloppy joe recipe!

Made this as sliders instead which worked perfectly. I also added Ground Black Pepper and Cayenne Pepper while the onion started to cook so it would get some of the heat from the peppers.

I used ground chicken instead of turkey. The flavour  was great but I found that it was too sweet. Maybe next time I will decrease the amount of brown sugar.

I consider myself an experienced and competent cook and never thought there was much to make a sloppy joe, but  this was a great "adult" version of the dinnertime favorite. ! My partner was still talking about it 2 days later! I kept mine to a more traditional drier texture consistency for speed and visual appeal IMO. It also does not note to drain  the ground turkey after it's browned (or at least I did). Finally, I started with half the cayenne, and it was plenty spicy for us. But I think I will go with the amount tonight. Try this recipe out if you have teens at home, or it's just adults. Why else is it rated 5 stars? :-)

This is awesome with one specific note.  Use the Jennio Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey.  I have made this multiple times, but one time I used plain ground turkey and it was just okay.
Make sure to add the Cocoa powder.  It adds a depth of flavor that also makes this recipe.  I also add a chopped jalapeno.
Chef John rocks!

Chose this recipe because of the reviews it received. & wasn’t disappointed.  Worried how my grandchildren ages 2 & 6 would like it because I wasn’t in the mood to make something else for them. No problem, except for the “hotness” from the cayenne pepper.  Next time I’ll tone it down a little, but that’s a personal preference.  The cocoa was an unexpected flavor plus.  Two adults & two little ones inhaled these healthy Turkey Sloppy Joes.  Good job!!!

A 5 star turkey recipe.  How can that be warranted?  Well, it is!  I amped up the cayenne pepper.  That would be me using it "to taste".  Awesome!  My husband and I both loved it.  If I could give it ten stars, I would.

I tried this instead of my usual sloppy joe recipe and it's a definite winner with both my hubby and me!  I followed the recipe except my hubby can't eat onions so I had to substitute onion powder- try cooking without onions :-( , but it was still delicious. Not too sweet like some and just enough heat.  Thanks Chef John

Luv the technique of adding water to soften the ground turkey, also adding cheese made it nice & creamy. Also liked the addition of cocoa.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  A bit sweet for me, so added 1 Tbsp. Bull’s Eye BBQ sauce.

This is the most flavorful Sloppy Joe mixture I have ever had, and I appreciated that it was not overly tomatoey-tasting. I doubled the recipe and used a Dutch oven to facilitate stirring without the contents spilling over the lower sides of a skillet. I added one cup cold water initially with the ground turkey and there was no need to add additional water at any point. I added about one Tbsp of minced garlic from a jar to sautée with the onion. I did mix two tsp white vinegar into the ketchup. I rarely use cayenne pepper as my palate is sensitive to spicy things, but I did add one tsp: suffice to say that I coughed quite a bit while tasting my first two small spoonfuls, lol... next time I will add only one half tsp for the doubled recipe. The doubled recipe yielded a heaping four cups of mixture for me. I will surely prepare this again and may add a can of chickpeas next time just for a fiber/nutritional boost. GREAT RECIPE!!!

It was very delicious. My 9 year old was in love but thought it was tiny bit too hot. I will half the cayenne pepper next time. I did use apple cider vinegar in place of the water and a dash of garlic powder.

I didn't add any salt as I'm trying to reduce sodium and there is lots in the ketchup already.  It has a nice bite from the cayenne  (but not too much and that's good because I don't like things too spicy) and a sweetness from the sugar.  If anything I'd reduce the sugar a bit the next time.   Very nice flavour overall.  My partner said "we're going to have this every week"!

I made this with only two modifications. per other reviews, I added 2tsp. red wine vinegar, and reduced the sugar to 2T. other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Even my picky teenage son gave it a thumbs up.  I'll make this again.

I have used many recipes from this site but this is the first time I have been compelled to review a recipe. This was the worst recipe for sloppy Joes I have ever tried. It was so sweet and flavorless, it was absolutely inedible.  I had to doctor it up with a packaged taco mix and lots of chili powder to make is edible for my family as I didn't want to throw away all that meat.  It was beyond disappointing.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe. It was so, so.

The second time, I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, and finely chopped carrots and celery. I also reduced the brown sugar by half. Much better, and the family loved it.

Halved the cayenne but still neither of my teens (15 & 17) would eat it after a couple bites to try. I thought it was good but not great.

No real changed, cept I didn't have white cheddar so I put a piece of Monteray Jack on the bun when broiling and we ate it open face. "Very good" was the review from my audience.

made a double of this recipe. only had 2 lb of ground turkey so I threw in a 1/3 of a cup of lentils. I added garlic and green pepper when I was sauteing The Onion. I cut back the brown sugar to 1 tbsp and I added a whole tin of tomato paste as I felt it tasted like meat with ketchup still. after Browning meat in a frying pan I put it all in a slow cooker with only 1/2 cup of water and it turned out great. none of the 11 people could tell it was Turkey. everyone from the kids to the adults liked it.

We had Chef John's beef Sloppy Joes last week and they were a big hit!  I wanted to try the turkey, and I see why it gets such excellent ratings!  I added a couple beef bullion  cubes to the meat as it browned.  My husband could not tell that it was turkey and stated that it was as good as the ones he had earlier, which were beef!  Thanks for a really good healthy recipe!  I am a new Chef John fan!

This was an excellent recipe. I've read almost every review and it baffles me when I read a review that said "no flavor " or "it was bland ".  I have to tell those cooks to either restock your spice rack or have a doctor check your taste buds. This recipe was exploding with flavor from the sweet to the spicy and everything in between.

I have made this over and over, it is amazing!! The recipe is delicious as is, but I like spicy and sometimes I'll add a finely chopped, hot pepper (if you can find spicy banana peppers, YUM!) A very simple recipe and reasonably healthy

Outstanding flavors, even before my suggestions for modifications. Reduce brown sugar to 1 tbsp, and if you like "heat" increase cayenne to taste. These changes will take this already GREAT recipe to a 6-star! This is the absolute best Turkey Sloppy Joe I have ever tasted! Hands down.

I modified the recipe - left out the extra water and the sugar, used a lot more Worcestershire, doubled the cocoa. It is part of the regular recipe rotation here, which means it gets made about every 3 or 4 months. Good food.

We liked this very much. I did make one change and added diced green and red pepper to the saute with the onions. It is just a taste we enjoy. We both thought it a bit sweet so when I make again, I will cut back on the brown sugar. 

Nice easy prep and good flavor. Thank you.

WOW! Absolutely wonderful. Don't change a thing in this recipe. It was so perfect. We put it on wheat buns and paired it with a small spinach cherry almond salad. I seriously can't say enough about this recipe. It is a keeper, Thank you Chef John!!!

Awesome recipe! First time making and it was great, a little sweet and spicy. Very nice. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks a bunch. Oh yeah I forgot to add the additional cup of water at the end, just to let other cooks know, and it still turned out, sloppy good!

Very good as written. If you want it to taste a little more like regular sloppy joes you can use beef stock instead of water! My roommates couldn't even taste the difference.

I did half the cayenne pepper and skipped the cheese.  Fabulous! I served it on the Honey Wheat Rolls recipe on this site.  Absolutely amazing!!!

I made this tonight on a whim because I was looking to try a recipe that used cocoa. It was absolutely delicious!   My husband and I loved it.   We served it on an onion bun that was toasted. I will definitely make this again.

I had to dial back the cayenne but aside from that this recipe is fantastic. My whole family loves it. And it's not too hard to make. I like that I only have to buy one or two items ever when planning to make it since most ingredients are part of my regular pantry inventory.

Made these for a Christmas Eve gathering, everyone loved them and could not believe they were turkey.  Even had one grandchild warm that  "mom cannot eat these, she doesn't eat beef!"  Good stuff.  Does not taste great till you add the green onion and cheese at the end, so wait till then to taste and judge!

My husband and I are on a low salt diet. We left out the salt, used more black pepper,  used more caramelized the onions, used red and green peppers  (approx. 1/2 to 3/4 cup), cumin, parsley  and a bit more Worchestershire sauce and absolutely loved it with a slaw salad!!!! If you do attempt in in a crockpot, I do agree that no water is needed. Thank you for suggestions and for Chef!!!!!!

I am always looking for ways to incorporate ground turkey into our diets in lieu of ground beef.   We thought these sloppy joes did not taste as sweet and spicy as we are used to, but, they were very good! I did add a little green pepper at the request of my husband.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and barely had enough for left overs, and there are only 2 of us;). My husband said he had to eat as an open faced sandwich (I think so he could just have more). Very, very flavorful!!!

I made it with the following additions and changes:

Olive Oil vs butter.
Added green pepper. 

If you are leary about the taste of turkey this recipe disguises it very well. Loved it. If you want it spicier add a bit more cayenne as suggested.

Had a craving for a good sloppy joe and was remembering Manwich that was in our rotation in the mid 80's after being recently married.  This recipe met all my expectations and more,  nice and spicy and our 22 year old son loved it too!  We will use it again and even  add it to an option for our family gatherings.   Very easy and very tasty!

Very very good! Made exactly as shown here, no changes. Except I added a dash of Frank's Red Hot. Oh, and I omitted the green onions and cheese at the end and just bunned the sloppy part. It was delicious, an we'll do it again, in a bigger batch next time!

Delicious!  I added 1 clove garlic with the onion & 1teaspoon whiskey when I added the Worcestershire.  My gram always added whiskey to her sloppy joes  & love the flavor that it adds. I will make these again, but cut the brown sugar in 1/2.

Dis not follow directions to the tee but it was excellent. We only added 1/2 c of water added 1 tbsp yellow mustard oh and added red pepper and minced garlic. No cocoa powder. It was so good will make it again. Oh and had it over brown rice.

My kids love it! It tastes so good and different than regular sloppy Joe. Saute onion in butter and cacao powder made it gourmet! I skipped the brown sugar and added 4 tbsp. of BBQ sauce instead. I have been making this twice a month at least.

Made this for a family get together and it was a big hit. Easy to make a double recipe and delicious. The only change I made was omitting the water and in fact drained the turkey after browning because there was so much liquid and I wasn't going for soup. Ended up the perfect consistency. I also served the cheese on the side due to dairy intolerance issues and it wasn't missed. Will make again!

I followed this exactly and it was a bit too sweet for me. A bit like a sweet BBQ flavor. Good, but not quite what I wanted. I added some extra paprika and cayenne and next time I will leave out most of the brown sugar - I think that was too sweet along side the ketchup.

This recipe was amazing!! We used half turkey/half beef and  tasted incredible!  I would never have thought to put those ingredients together but it works so well!

This was so easy and had wonderful flavor! A definite in the future. I did alter the cayenne to 1/4tsp instead of the mentioned 1/2tsp since we are a "low heat" family. Give it a try, you will be thankful.

I really liked this one!  Made it almost as stated, less butter & brown sugar, used onion powder because I was out of onions and green onions.  Served it over angel hair .  I'll make it again!

Well, since we bought our ground turkey pre-packaged we got more than the recipe called for. Rather than find another use or waste it, we just went ahead a used the extra. The sauce looked a little thin, spread over too much meat, but even so the taste was really good. Everyone in the family liked it.  We will surely make again.  Also, it is a pretty darn simple recipe, making it good for week nights.

An easy recipe and the best SJ's ever.  I like to chop a Serrano chili in mine to kick it up a notch.   Also, if you make too many, just make the sandi, cover it in plastic and nuke it for 40 seconds later.

This is a great alternative for beef sloppy joes.  However, next time I think I will leave the cayenne pepper out.  It was too spicy for my kids.  Thanks for the recipe though.  

I loved this recipe the second time.  Did everything the same, but only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  Much better, changing my rating rom 3 to 5 stars.  There was no leftovers tonight as my family of four gobbled it up.

Quite yummy! I doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it, and separated into three batches before adding the cheese and green onion (one batch plain, one batch with cheese, and one batch with cheese and green onion) for my picky eaters. They all gobbled it up! I liked the cheese/green onion version the best because it had that bit of freshness. I did find that it was a bit sweet after doubling, but I just added a little white vinegar and it changed it up pretty quickly.

I added peppers as well just because I like the veggie and used olive oil instead of butter just because I didn't have any. Great kick with the cayenne and was good as leftovers with pasta too

Works with beef, too! I've made this recipe several times with ground turkey, but I went to the freezer tonight and realized I didn't have any. So I tried ground beef instead, and it turned out pretty good! I kept the ingredients all the same, but bumped up the cocoa and worcestershire sauce a little bit, figuring that the more powerful beef flavor would require it. Super!

I really liked this.  It was so much better than the canned stuff.  It was a touch sweet .  I may cut down on the brown sugar next time.  The only extra thing I added was a clove of crushed garlic right at the end of cooking the onions and two teaspoons of white vinegar.  I will make this a lot in the future.

Made this x5 for my son's birthday party tonight.  Really delicious.  I added green pepper and garlic powder.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I think I'll cut back the brown sugar next time and add more worcestershire sauce.  My brother told our mom it was better than her sloppy joes so that added some conversation to the meal as well.

Guests were using it as dip for tortilla chips too.

This was just.... wayyyyy too sweet. I'd omit the brown sugar for sure. I added vinegar before finishing the sauce because I tasted and it was too sweet but that didn't fix it. I didn't notice the cocoa and wasn't able to taste the cheese either.

I've made this now several times. I'm totally in love. Super fast, sweet, a little spicy...just perfect. I'm not sure the water is needed when adding the turkey but if you cook it long enough, it will cook out.

Followed the recipe pretty closely.  Only modification was I added 1 red pepper with the onions, cooked the onions/red pepper in 1 T of olive oil (instead of butter) and only used 1 lb of ground turkey.  This turned out very good.  Left off the cheddar cheese and topped with homemade coleslaw instead.  Very nice and very easy to prepare.

Made this tonight and it was terrific! My husband is not a fan of ground turkey, but this won him over. I cut way back on the cayenne since we don't like things too spicy, but I would put in a little more next time, maybe a quarter teaspoon.

I made this yesterday and I gotta say:  Yum!  I didn't add as much cayenne pepper as the recipe called for, but I think I could next time around as it probably would have been okay for our taste buds.  My husband slicked it up, and then asked if there was going to be enough for the next day.  We are very happy with this recipe.  Thank you, Chef John!

This was delicious. I followed the directions exactly.  My boyfriend does not usually like sloppy joes but he LOVED these. I served them on toasted whole grain bread with fresh green beans. It is important to add the second batch of water slowly (you may not need it all) and let it cook down and thicken. This keeps the turkey moist. Watch Chef John's video. It is very helpful.

It is a keeper!!!!!! My son and I loved it.  I am lactose intolerant so I decided to try it without the cheddar cheese.  It is super delicious no regrets whatsoever. So fresh and right on point with the juiciness of the meet.  I did not have cocoa so I did not add it.  I am so pleased, I will never eat my turkey ground beef if it is not in a sloppy joe like this one or anything as good.

These were really good.  My 10 yr old said he liked these even better than the homemade beef sloppy joes.  I made the recipe as stated but next time for our taste I will cut down on the green onion just a bit and maybe a tad less sugar too.

Yummy! 3lbs turkey for double the sauce recipe, just cook up the turkey with the 1 onion for double recipe, mix together everything else for the sauce and add to the cooked turkey, made exactly but didn't add water and use rounded 1/4 tsp. cayenne for double recipe if kids are eating.

We all LOVED this dinner! My husband asked why I haven't made it more often (which is funny since this was my first time making it). I used ground venison instead but followed it as is just adding only 1/4 tsp cayenne (my husband doesn't like things too spicy) and 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I didn't have green onions though. I ate mine just spooned onto a plate without a bun, YUM!!! my hubby and son ate theirs on onion buns. This is a definite keeper!!! And soooo easy!!!

I added green bell pepper but otherwise made the recipe as stated. I'm not a huge sloppy joe fan, but my husband wanted it and he really liked it. He thought the meat was a little dry, though. Not sure if it's because I used super lean meat or if it's from boiling the meat. Or maybe it's that we live at a higher altitude and in a desert climate. We will likely try this recipe again, though, so maybe next time it'll be better. It's better than what my mom made when I was a kid.

Amazing! You can spice it up or down with the amount of cayenne.  I like adding shredded mozzarella cheese on top!

I used regular ground beef, I thought this was excellent until I added the green onion and cheese.  It was way better without those two ingredients.

My teenage boys loved it and they're as picky as toddlers these days.   Adding the cheese at the end give it a great texture. That little bit of chocolate give a great  depth to the flavor.

Very yummy! If you are sensitive to heat, use half the amount of cayenne pepper. My hubby ended up eating two helpings he loved it so much.

I don't usually post reviews on here (sorry, I know I should) but I felt the need to post one here. I have to say that I was a bit skeptical about Turkey "sloppy joes" but I decided to give this a try since it's what I had available to cook and the reviews seem to be all for it. MAN AM I GLAD I TRIED IT!!! These were absolutely AMAZING. I have to say that I followed the recipe exactly as stated (except the cheese, I didn't have any at the time). My husband could not believe that I made turkey sloppy joes, needless to say, he went in for seconds. The cayenne pepper gives it a spicy kick which is great for spicy lovers. If you are not into spicy, omit that portion altogether and you still have a great dish. This was extremely quick and a new family favorite. Thank you Chef John!!!

This was the best sloppy joe I've ever had ( sorry mom )! It was sweet and a little spicy. Lots of flavor. Followed the directions as written except I decreased the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and decreased the remaining water from 1 cup to 1/2 cup when cooking it down.

My extremely picky 11 year old loved it. As did my 8 year old and husband. A winner! My son (11 year old) doesn't like meat or vegetables, and he devoured this and a salad. Best family dinner time ever. 

It was easy to make, and I let it simmer for quite a while to cook down. Only deviation in the recipe is that I used soy sauce in place of Worcestershire, as I didn't have any. Terrific!

Omitted the butter, coco and cheese - I either didn't have it on hand and I wanted this recipe to be a little healthier.  While this was was good, I have found other sloppy joe recipes on this site that are better.

Love this recipe and it's super easy to make! I loved watching John's videos, they crack me up! I reduced the cayenne to 1/4tsp because otherwise it was too spicy for my little youngsters. Served with a side of tater tots and it's a wonderful meal for a cold day.

We liked it but found that 1/2 teaspoon was too much cayanne pepper. And it was way too sweet for me. I may or may not make again.

Loved it! Throwback to my childhood, but healthier and tastier! Watched the video. Your method of cooking the turkey (with the water and sautéed onions) was spot on for a very tender filling. I added just a pinch of cayenne to account for my family's sensitive taste buds, adding a bit extra Worcestershire sauce instead, but no other changes. Thanks Chef John!

Loved these! I have a regular recipe that I use and always substitute turkey for the ground beef, but thought I would try a recipe that was originally based on turkey. We all loved it and will definitely be making this again...many times!

This was amazing! I didn't include the green onions, as I didn't have any, and I added a bell pepper. SO good!

Cocoa powder adds such a great deep flavor and color without being able to identify it as cocoa at all. Genius ingredient used here as it makes the lean turkey taste richer...you won't miss the ground beef. Also cayenne elevates the flavor too, balances the sweet. I buttered brioche rolls and toasted them and made a quick pickled red onion with just vinegar and s&p to put on top. I actually forgot the cheese, wished I remembered it.  I did leave out the water when I was browning the turkey but added a cup at the end per the recipe to make it saucy. An easy 5 star recipe with such little effort.

This recipe was delicious!  We had some turkey and didn't know what to do with it.  I added just a touch of cayenne, since I have a young, non-spicy eater. My husband and kids enjoyed it, so I'll definitely make it again.

I used half as much onion and butter, out of personal preference; half as much brown sugar, because I have to watch my carbs; and half as much cayenne, because I'm a wuss. :-)  I still found the finished product to be a little sweet and a little hot, but my goodness, SO delicious! I knew as soon as I saw cocoa in the ingredient list that I would love it, and I do. Thank you so much for sharing this creative and easy recipe, Chef John!

I still like my beef version better but this is definitely decent for a turkey version. I'll add more cayenne next time.

Oh lawd, I tried it and did exactly what the recipe said except that I added a little more ketchup to counter the cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard powder and 1/4 cup finely chopped celery sticks. The thing was the bomb

This was the absolute BEST sloppy joe ever! I would say it's a sophisticated sloppy joe that your kids will still LOVE!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written although I left out the green onion just because I thought there was enough onion in it already....and I am cooking for a 4 year old!  I am now going to look for more Chef John recipes!!

So I know 99% of my reviews are positive but I think I've just been picking fantastic recipes to try :) But this...wow. Seriously. Family seems to want something different all the time (the nerve! lol) and I had a massive amount of ground turkey in the freezer. I'd already tried the turkey meatloaf on here and wanted something different. Reviewers are spot on with the positive raves..this is incredible! As someone said, this is clearly chef created. The cocoa and cayenne add something you can't quite put your finger on when they are all blended together. I used extra lean turkey but barely needed any water (around 1/4 cup if that) cause we like it chunky rather than soupy. I needed to stop myself from eating it all out of the skillet! You won't be disappointed!!

This was another great recipe by Chef John, haven't tried one that is bad yet. Like some other reviewers, I did add a little white vinegar and some garlic powder, but that's it. Was good fresh and just as good, if not better, heated up for lunch the next day. I had several co-workers who came over to find out what smelled so good!

This was really tasty and quite easy. I left out the cheese and green onions so the kids would eat it. Everyone ate it all up without noticing they were eating turkey so its a winner in my book. Be mindful of the cayenne for the heat sensitive.

I think there was too much ketchup and too much water.  I used 1/2 c ketchup and 1/4 cup of water and it was still very soupy.  I couldn't taste the cheese with only 1/2 c in there so I think I will leave it out next time.  Other than that, great flavor and I will make it again.

Delicious! I cut the cayenne down to 1/4 tsp since my kids don't like spice and it was perfect! Sweet, spicy, cheesy goodness on a roll.

I made this exactly as written and it is hands down the best sloppy joes I have ever had in my life. I can't believe it's turkey. Also we have had it over polenta which was sinfully good (I'm wheat free) AND no mess. I can see this being excellent as something you make before hand and warm up in a slow cooker. I found the flavors were ever better two days later.

Made this as written except I omitted the cheese since my husband doesn't like it. 5 stars from the adults, but the 6 year old said it was too spicy. Honestly it was barely spicy to me and my husband didn't even notice any spice, but next time I'll cut back on the cayenne for the kids.

All I have to say is OMG!!!. I followed the recipe actually how it was and they came out perfect. I love the taste the green onions gave it along with the cheese. I swear it taste like I was eating a cheesesteak but a healthy version.  Can you tell I'm from Philly?  Love, love, love!!! I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Really tasty and easy to prepare.  Make sure you take the time to separate all the ground meat before it cooks.  My first attempt was a little chunky, and therefore, a smidge drier than it would be otherwise.

After seeing the reviews and how simple this was, I made this after church today. I followed the recipe exactly and my kids loved it. I am not a manwich or traditional sloppy joe lover but I'm taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Later tonight I'm making Chef John's  Hot Tamale and peach cobbler. Thank you for giving me some new ideas and a desire to cook again!

This is a great alternative to a turkey-burger, which is often unsatisfactory to me.  A beef-free partial week is necessary for a medical test, so this was perfect.  Unbelievable what a little cocoa powder and some cayenne pepper can do!  I could have skipped the onions, but I think they are needed.  Mine did not disappear, as in the video, but  it was just delicious!!  Fussy Hubby liked it too!

Delicious.  I added a touch of cinnamon instead of cocoa powder because that's what I had on hand.  In addition, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar. Used Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular.  Enjoy!

Very yummy meal!  I made these exactly as described in the recipe and they were very good.  I toasted bakery buns with a little olive oil and that really finished them off.  Thanks for a great recipe that was enjoyed by my entire family!

First time using ground turkey to make sloppy joes. Reduced brown sugar to 1 T. and only used the first 1/2 cup of water which I added the cocoa to. I thought these were delicious and my husband even commented on how good they were. 
 
Thank's Chef John.. I'll be using this recipe alot!

great weekday meal!  I kept going back for more and my family of 3 devoured the whole dish!  Might scale back the br sugar next time.  it was great as is but think it would be just as good and a tad lighter if the sugar was knocked back a notch or two.

Will definitely make this again.  Only used the 1/2 cup of water...did not add any extra.  I also cooked my ground turkey considerably longer than 2 minutes before adding water and sauce ingredients.  Cooked until turkey was almost done, added the rest and let sit on stove for 15 minutes on med-low. Next time I might mix the 1/2 cup water with sauce ingredients and add when the turkey is almost done...it was kind of gross adding it into the not cooked turkey.  Used a large shallot and fresh garlic instead of onion.

These were good, although a bit on the dry side.
