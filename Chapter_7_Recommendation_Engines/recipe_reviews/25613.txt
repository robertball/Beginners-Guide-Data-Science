I was trying to come back to this recipe.  I made it for my daughter's first birthday.  I did exactly the way it was intended and it came out soo perfect.  I was a little hesitant about 2 tbsps of lemon extract, but it was awesome!!!  I doubled the recipes and it stayed moist for almost a whole week after. I will definitely be using this recipe again!  Thanks!

I tried this b/c it was way easier and simpler than my other recipe - and it was sooo good!  I like that it uses shortening (you can buy trans fat free shortening, and then you can feel good about using it!) which atays room temp and there's no planning to it.  Baked up wonderfully in a bundt pan, cooled for 20 min. in the pan and flipped over.  SO, SO pretty when you cut it. Delicious flavor.  I did 3 T. of lemon juice in place of the 2 T. lemon extract b/c I was out.  Great recipe!!

This is a great recipe!  Very moist and rich.  I put some hot lemon sauce over it, too.  But I have added one teaspoon of baking poweder to it.  Haven't tried it without though...

This is a very nice pound cake, reminiscent of the one my grandmother made when I was a child. Made 1/2 recipe and baked in a loaf pan; still takes the full baking time! I followed the suggestion to reduce the sugar (3 cups seems like a lot, even for the larger cake) so I added 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups as would be enough for a half recipe. Quite sweet, good texture, and the outside a little bit crispy, as it should be. Don't make this if you're looking for somethine exotic, but very good as a base for ice cream, strawberries or any other topping. Thanks!  My grandmother would  be proud!

All in all a good receipe but I found the cooking time WAY off.  I took it out after an hour and 15 minutes and it was already dry.  Maybe my oven but I would certainly recommend checking it after an hour.  I followed the receipe exactly with the exception of using sour cream instead of milk and omitting the lemon extract.  Will make again but really watch it next time!

This was my 1st attempt at baking a pound cake. My family and I loved it. Thanks for posting it. It really took about 1 1/2hrs to bake, and it was worth it. Only pound cake recipe I will ever used. I did glaze it mixing 3tespn lemon juice,1/3 cup water and 1cup powdered sugar.

I had to make this recipe three times. The first time I made it I wasn't realy impressed, I went went out to eat and when I returned the cake was gone, but three of my fiance's friends were looking a little too satisfied to see me. I asked if they knew what happened to the cake they told me it had been eaten and asked if there was any more. So I had to make two more only I used Butter flavor shortening and imitation butter extract plus upped the lemon extract

Tried this recipe today. It was awesome! It was so light and fluffy with that Old fashioned taste that reminds me of my mother and Aunts cooking. It is an easy recipe and the ingredients are usually already in your pantry. Thanks for sharing.

I like the way this cake came out but it ask for to much lemon! If you like your pound cake to taste like a lemon cake then by all means follow recipe as is but next time I will only put in a half teaspoon of lemon extract. Sorry I am not a big fan of lemon pound cakes...

I was having problems with my pound cakes cracking on top and falling. I decided to  follow this recipe and put a piece of foil over top while it baked. Then removed the foil the last 15-20 minutes of baking. The foil seemed to help the cake cook evenly and top did not crack. Cake turned out perfect very happy, Thanks Sylvia For submitting your recipe, You saved me today :)

I had a similar problem as some previous reviewers in that there was far too much batter for my tube pan. I was able to make the cake plus a dozen cupcakes from this recipe as written. It was delicious though! I'll probably pull it out of the over close to 40min next time because the outside was a little more cooked than I prefer, but I will b making this cake again and again.

This is a very tasty cake however after baking for 1 hour 20 minutes the outside was a bit overdone and the inside was fine. I followed the recipe to the tee. next time i think i will lower temp to 325.

Loved it! Awesome color, great flavor, very moist. After cooking this recipe a couple times, although it's great each time, I found the best results are when cooked in stoneware.

This was great, a keeper in my recipe box for special people only. Was looking for a quick, no fuss pound cake recipe.  Had all the ingredients and didn't have to run out to buy anything I thought. Shortening? Recipe called for shortening the one thing I did not have.  Thought cake won't come out quite right without shortening. As in Crisco (the white stuff in the blue can). Was not sure of what to substitute. Discovered vegetable oil, canola, peanut oil, lard or butter would do.  Elected butter for original butter flavor.  Scaled back on the sugar, added some sour cream to the recipe.  Nirvana!!! Took it to a church meeting.  Didn't want to face the guilt of devouring an entire cake by myself.

there could be definite improvements to the recipe, but it's a good base.  I left out the lemon, adding almond extract and vanilla instead.  If you like the butter taste, I would recommend adding some butter flavoring as well.  I did, and it really added to the recipe.  Turned out pretty good, but I was expecting a denser cake. I also iced it with a thin vanilla icing, which really made the cake.  It tasted better after letting sit for a day or two.  All in all I just wished it was heavier.  It helped to not mix the batter too long.

This is a pretty easy recipe.  My modification was using Splenda instead of sugar.  I also made muffins from this batter and they blossumed up and tasted pretty good. The remainder of batter I made a cake.  The Cake has better body and flavor than the muffins.  Be sure to follow the directions closely.  I messed up and failed to add the eggs to the Splenda/shortening batch.  I added the eggs at the end and it was tough.  It all worked out though.  Not sure if the blending in the flour and milk would have gone better if the eggs were in the splenda/shortening mix like directed. My family is really enjoying the recipe. Thank you.

I wanted a pound cake as base for the berry trifle recipe on this site, so omitted the lemon, kept everything else the same. This was wonderful and held up very well for 3 days in the trifle! The remaining cake was great on it's own too!
Thanks for sharing.

This pound cake was very delicious and had the perfect texture.  It was moist and the outside had the perfect crunch.  I will definitely make again.  One change that I made was that I used 3 teaspoons of vanilla and 4 teaspoons of lemon. The flavor was not overly lemony.  I also only cooked the cake for about 1 hr and 15 mins. The recipe does make a lot of batter.  In the future I will use one 10 inch bundt pan and possibly a half loaf pan.

Very good.  Backed off the lemon a bit, but sooooooo good.  Especially under a fresh, juicy fruit salad.

I LOVE this recipe! I did use butter instead of shortening - 1st because that's what I had but also that's how I've always made pound cake.  I did not need to cook it as long - about 70 minutes and it's perfect.  Moist sweet decadent top, yummmm

The recipe is perfect, it rose very high even without the use of baking powder. Totally disagree with the previous one star comment, my cake stay moist as any other cake using perfect recipes. Based on my preference, I use only 2 cups of sugar (3 cups is way toooo sweeet).  Since i dont have any shortening, I use my stock of margarine plus butter. I think this will be my basic pound cake recipe starts from today. Thank u for sharing it!

This is my first time using this pound cake recipe. I was never very good at baking pound cakes. This one turned out perfect! My husband had to admit the cake was delicious. This is the new family recipe.

Fabulous!!!  I used about 3T fresh squeezed lemon and added about 3T lemon zest (left out vanilla) to make a lemon pound cake.  This recipe yielded two loaf pans plus 4 jumbo muffins.  Took the muffin pans out at 35 minutes, and the loaves out at 60 minutes.  Beautiful texture, color and taste!

this recipe was so easy to make . I choose it because it didn't require alot of extra ingredients, and you did not have to separate everything into 20 different bowls before you combined the ingredients.  Its in the oven now so we will so how she turns out.
