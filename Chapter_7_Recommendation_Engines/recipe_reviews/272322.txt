Omg this is quite easily one of the best recipes I’ve had in a long time! Let’s be honest new recipes with no reviews and no ratings can be kinda scary. I made no changes at all, and absolutely loved this recipe!!! Absolutely company worthy! I served it with chicken herb rice and glazed baby carrots. Yum yum!!!

Thanks DailyGourmet for your encouragement to try a new recipe. This was a mammoth hit! Truly, my partner told me several times how much he liked it (and I cook a lot).  This has a much more subtle lemon flavor than picata. I subbed boneless, skinless breasts, so I skipped the browning step. I also subbed dry thyme and fat-free half & half, 'cause it's what I had and to cut the fat content. Worked fine. Great recipe!

This was both good and easy.  I made out exactly as written.  Overall, I'd give the flavor an 8.

I had a little cream to use up and this was on my feed that day.  Good flavor but very greasy.  I’ll remove the skin next time.

Oh my so absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!  This is a keeper!!  I would change absolutely nothing!  So flavorful.  I did cook it a little bit longer… per my meat thermometer.  Can’t wait to make it again.

This was really tasty and easy to make. The recipe is flexible, as I had no cream or fresh lemon, so used a bit of cream cheese and bottled lemon juice,, and it turned out just fine. Tasty, rich and delicious.

WOWZA, this was good! Didn't change a thing except I did add a little olive oil to the butter so the butter wouldn't burn and I used  6 thick chicken breasts. I cooked them about 5 minutes on each side to brown.  The sauce was soooooo amazing, I'm going to double it next time around. I left it in for 30 minutes, turned off the stove and kept it in there for 5 more minutes. I'm wondering if next time I should cover it to keep it a little moist? My guys loved it and my brother came over for dinner and loved it! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a big hit and I would certainly serve this to guests. Plated over wide buttered egg noodles and side of steamed broccoli. Thanks for posting!

Excellent recipe, great flavor. However, I'm one person and not twelve, so I changed the amounts to make it for one person. I found that for one serving, the baking was completely unnecessary and would have dried out the chicken and sauce too much if I'd left it in the full 30 minutes. The next night I tried it again and set the chicken aside while I cooked the sauce, then added the chicken back for a minute or two to coat it, and it was just as good.

Woooow... I DO NOT leave reviews, so me leaving one means it’s going to snow in the middle of July. This has got to be one of the best recipes I have made in a while! The simplicity of the ingredients makes it a winner alone IMO. My whole family loved this meal and will be a staple for a long time to come. I added mushrooms to the butter and just a tad bit more wine and parmesan cheese.  Do not hesitate to make this recipe if you’re looking for a great tasting meal to impress your family and friends.

We love this chicken! We've now made it twice in the last 5 days. We've had it with white rice, rice pilaf and varied veggies. I love the flavor that the wine and the garlic gives, my kiddos love how flavorful the chicken turns out. It's a hit! We really only needed to pick up the fresh thyme, the cream and the chicken - such a fun and easy recipe for such great taste.... One change I did try was to brown both sides of the chicken - the Mrs. prefers crispy chicken and it's a tip of the hat to her, but, it's still in the oven as I write this so I don't know what effect that has on the chicken....

This was really good. I read the other reviews and I think it could have more lemon in it. Hubs loved it.

I made this exactly as written except for cutting the recipe in half and using all chicken thighs.  It was delicious!  I wasn't at all sure about the lemon because I really don't care for citrusy meat, but the dish didn't taste lemony at all.  The lemon just added a nice tang and mixed with the paprika it was perfect.  Will definitely make this again!

Good recipe. I didn't make any changes other than using unsalted butter. My sauce was a little thin. I could have thickened it a bit more in the pan, but wanted to get it in the oven. It did thicken a little more in the oven, but not much. The only changes I would make is to add dried thyme to the spice mixture on the chicken and add more sprigs of fresh thyme than stated. I really like thyme, though. I served it with roasted baby Yukon gold potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This was very good!   The only substitutions I made were to use boneless skinless chicken thighs and dried thyme.   It was just a tad bit salty, so will use less salt next time while seasoning the chicken.
