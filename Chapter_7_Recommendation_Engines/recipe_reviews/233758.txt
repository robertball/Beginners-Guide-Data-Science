Wow - feta cheese and scrambled eggs together! This made for a light yet filling breakfast with a tasty combination of flavors. I did sautee the spinach along with a little onion and garlic then added the rest of the ingredients. I opted to use egg beaters which worked out nice and fat free feta cheese. Perfect with a side of whole grain toast and fresh fruit!

This recipe is sooooo easy AND flavorful. I decide to sauté the fresh spinach and cherry tomatoes before cooking the egg whites. However, next time, my husband wants me to try it without the sauté step. My husband does not eat many veggies but he likes this recipe!!! I made it twice this week already! It's good with and without the feta cheese. By the way, I use garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper when I whisk the egg whites. I wonder if we can call this a Greek egg white omelette? "I'm strong to the finish, 'cause I eats me Spinach, I'm Popeye the sailor man! (toot, toot)"

Used egg beaters just to try it out lol I love egg whites so next time I'll use that but I used a little oil to sautée the vegetables. I used bacon bits, mushrooms, green bell peppers, onions and jalapeños. :)

I used this recipe as a base to copy an omelet I liked from diner. I used the whole egg, coconut oil in the pan, salt and pepper, but skipped the tomato because I didn't have any. It was delicious!

I normally wouldn't consider taking the yolks out of an omelette, but after making eggnog I had lots of whites to use. This turned out to be very good, with the flavorful fillings. I used butter to coat the pan instead of cooking spray, and the omelette had a nice crisp outer edge.

Really nice easy recipe. Make sure you use a non-stick pan and also add in a little basil into the mix kicks up a flavor.

This is so good! I only added some cayenne because I like some heat and turmeric. This tricks the eye with adding some yolk color and is super good for you so I add it a lot when I cook. The 1st time I made it I put way too much tomato and spinach in so it didn’t look pretty but tasted great still! The second time I backed down a bit and it looks more omelette like.

My daughter and I loved it, didn't change anything.  Except I didn't have any fresh spinach so I left it out.  It was still amazing and filling.

GREAT BREAKFAST - but why just egg whites?  What is wrong with the yolks?   My chickens lay the best eggs...used the entire egg and it was awesome.

This was really good! I cooked the spinach and tomatoes with some cooking spray on a frying pan for a minute and then added it to the egg omelet. The feta cheese adds a lot of delicious flavor!

We enjoyed this--of course a couple of revisions. Used six egg whites in a large pan; chopped green onion in egg; a little Italian Seasoning over all. Delicious and quick!

I substituted pretty much everything in here; used whole eggs, parmesan, romaine, and cherry tomatoes, because we had plenty of ingredients but nothing prepared for dinner. Feta probably works better than parm, I believe. The instructions on when to fold the omelette was really valuable. I'm trying to go vegetarian, and I will turn to this recipe time and again for omelettes!

My new favorite fast food breakfast!  I used 2 whole eggs (I can't get into the anemic look of egg whites alone) I sautéed the tomatoes to make their flavor pop and just tossed in the spinach for a second to get rid of their rawness and I did use feta.  My husband who generally won't touch spinach loves this dish.

Excellent! Very easy to make and tasty. A good basic omelette, too, for other fillings. I advise watching the salt . It doesn't need as much as a full-egg version.

I used 2 eggs instead of whites, roma tomatoes instead of cherry, and queso fresco instead of feta. i also topped it with salsa verde because again, Latino. I'm very happy with the end result, was gonna skip the tomato all together but I'm glad I didn't, it adds to the bright and fresh of the omelet all together.
