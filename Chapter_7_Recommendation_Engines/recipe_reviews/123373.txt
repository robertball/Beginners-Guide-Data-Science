I was looking for a low sugar macaroon and this did the trick.  Very good.  I used an Apricot Fruit spread to keep the white sugar down.  I also added chopped pecans to some of them.  Instead of the glaze, I sprinkled additional coconut on the top before baking to give them a more festive look.  A very nice, light but satisfying macaroon.  Thanks!

These were great cookies. Mine turned out somewhat hard on the outside and kinda soft on the outside and the flavors came slowly to my mouth and it was great. My whole family loved them. I did add like 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract but it probably didn't even need it. I strongly recommend the almonds on top, lovely. Just so anyone wants to know, I had only (whipped) cream cheese so It was 6 tbs of that I put which is much the same thing. Try it.

These are yummy! The dough seems dry when you are mixing it, but don't worry, they turn out moist, chewy and great!

I guess I'm in the minority here, but I made these last year at Christmas time and I didn't care much for them. I felt that you couldn't taste the apricot or coconut enough and they had a wierd texture, IMO. Some of my family liked them, but most did not. It was nice to try something new, but this will not be something I would take the time to make again. Thanks for sharing. :)

These cookies are amazing!  I made these just to get rid of some apricot preserves and WOW, what a pleasant surprise!  I made the recipe just as is and it was perfect. I may add almonds like another reviewer suggested.  Fantastic!  Thanks so much for this recipe!
