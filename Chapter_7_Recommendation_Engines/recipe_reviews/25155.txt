Can I give this one 6 stars?  Wonderful!!!  I did change a couple of things..used 1/2 miracle whip & 1/2 sour cream, used green onion instead of regular onion and added some shredded cheddar cheese.  This is close to the Baked Potato Salad that the gourmet deli sells.  Great for family reunions, not the same boring potato salad.  Thanks Donna.

I use three potato salad receipes from this site and here is another keeper - it is starting to get stressful trying to figure out which kind to make!!!!  All our problems should be so little!  Almost every reviewer loved this one and so many said not to change a thing - so I didn't. And I agree.  This is a bit time consuming - although I was trying out two other new recipes today so mayble that is why I think that.  I had some leftover today and my bacon is not soggy - so I think the key there is to make sure your bacon is very crisp (not burned - just crisp!).  Oops, I lied!  I did make one minor change - I too used green onions instead of regular - I always use scallions instead of onions in all my potato and macaroni salads. I feel the green onions give salads a better crunch. Thank you submitter.

I have made lots of potato salad in my time, and this one is one of the best!  I made only a few small changes...I used green onions, and less bacon.  I also chopped up the potatoes while they were still warm, and then mixed it with the mayo.  I find when they are still warm, the spices and flavours blend really nicely.  I made it the same day I served it, as I was worried about soggy bacon, and it was all gone in an hour!  This is a definite keeper, and I am making it again this weekend!

I'm rating this recipe a 5 because I think the bacon makes it wonderful!  I added a few "extras" though. I cut the potatoes into bite size pieces before boiling.  When potatoes were done I spread them out on a large cookie sheet and sprinkled with some fresh chopped dill and a little red wine vinegar.  While they were cooling I mixed 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, chopped dill pickles, chopped eggs and green onions in a small bowl. When the potatoes cooled I put them in my serving bowl and poured my mayo sour cream mixture over the potatoes and mixed just enought to cover. I kept it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors mesh together and added bacon just before serving. Delish!

Is the amount of potatoes correct; or is there a typo? 2 cups of Mayo, 6 eggs and a pound of bacon for only 2 lbs of potatoes? That seems excessive to me. To start I'll try 1 cup of Mayo... (Hellman's of course), 3 eggs and 1/2 a pound of crispy bacon, I can always add more if I think it's needed; or I could probably use 4 to 5 lbs of potatoes. I'll post an update after I make this recipe. UPDATE: I made this recipe today, July 3rd. As written I found 2 lbs of potatoes just wasn't the proper ratio to the amounts of mayonnaise, eggs and bacon. I wound up using about 5 lbs of potatoes. I also added more celery, 3 ribs, 2 green onions thinly sliced, and a small green pepper, seeded and dice fine. With these additions, the 2 cups of mayonnaise and 6 eggs were the perfect amounts; although next time I would only use 1/2 lb of bacon, 1 lb was still a bit too much. I'm sure this will taste even better tomorrow, for our July 4th cook-out.

Delicious!  I cubed the potatoes before boiling because I figured it would be easier to get the right consistency.  I always seem to cook potatoes too long.  I also only added 4 eggs because I didn't want it to be too eggy.  I received many compliments and will definitely be making this again.

This is an excellent recipe! I used bacon bits and added a little mustard, too.  The lady that wrote it had too much celery apparently made the same mistake I did one time--confusing one stalk of celery for a BUNCH of celery. One stalk makes approximately 1/4 cup.

This is hands down the best potato sald I have ever had! Everyone else thought so too! It was a hit! I did change some things, I used red onion and lightly sauteed the onion and celery in the bacon fat. I cut up the potatoes before cooking them and I drained the celery and onion on top of the potatoes in the strainer. I added a heaping tbs of sweet relish and spicy mustard and a dash of Italian seasoning. I only used 4 eggs and I used 1/2 regular mayo and half miracle whip. Awesome!!!

Awesome!!!  Can't get enough of this - just made a 4x batch for 50!  Altered ever so slightly.  Cubed the potatoes, tossed in a bag with olive oil, pepper, seasoned salt, paprika, garlic powder and dill weed.  Roasted on a baking stone until tender.  1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream as so many have so wisely recommended, 1/2 the onion but added fresh chives to it.  Only needed 1/2 the bacon for my tastes - but dear hubby put a handful of the leftover bits on his one serving!   Added 1/2 the sauce to the potatoes when I made it so it could blend overnight but not get soggy and then the other 1/2 the next morning to freshen it up.  Will use this recipe forever more - so much better than traditional potato salad!!  To all those who mentioned it's a lot of prep work - all good homemade potato salad is, but with this one at least you don't have to do all that peeling! :)

I've been looking for the ideal red skinned potato salad and I think I found it.  This was straight forward, simple and delicious.  I added a couple more eggs, used green onion, half mayo and half miracle whip.  It's goes great with BBQ chicken!

We enjoyed this one, its a welcome change.  I made it per recipe, but next time, I think I'll use green onion, and a squirt of mustard.  Yummy salad!  Thanks Donna!

I used Miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and it still turned out really good.  It was the first time I made potato salad!  Success!  I will definitely make it again.  However, I would layer the potatoes, bacon, and dressing before mixing.  I got chunks of bacon in some spots and in others--there was none!

Here is what I did to make one large bowl (4 quart size) of potato salad.  5 pounds of red potatoes, scrubbed and diced BEFORE boiling.  Boiled for about 15 min till fork tender.  After boiling, drain potatoes and placed on a cookie sheet to cool.  After cooled I added:  6 diced, hard boiled eggs,diced into little pieces one 2.52oz box of Oscar Meyer pre-cooked bacon (warmed in microwave to make crispy), diced 2 stalks of green onions, diced 3 celery stalks (not 3 bunches, just 3 stalks!), 2 tablespoons of prepared mustard, 1 cup of Miracle Whip, 1 cup of mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Sprinkle top of salad with paprika.  It was DELISH!!!!!  Everyone loved it and I'll always make it exactly this way!  This served 10 people with some left over!

Okay, I think I have PERFECTED this recipe! Here are my changes: I use half mayo, half sour cream (both light), 3 eggs, 2 celery stalks, and 3 green onions.  I mix this all together and then add about 3 tablespoons of mustard. After I boil the potatoes, I wait until they are cool enough to handle but still warm, and then slice them and pour about 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar on the potatoes. I then season with salt, pepper, and about a teaspoon of dried dill. I also use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. If you cook up turkey bacon really crisp, it will soften, but it won't be as bad as regular bacon. It stays crisper in the recipe longer. Whenever I make this, I get asked for the recipe! It's delicious!

It's great, but why the one hour prep time?  One of the best things about it is that it is quick (although the one hour in fridge flavors melding time is mandatory.)  Most folks have more than one burner on their stove and can multi-task.  Boil the potatoes the fifteen minutes(or prick the skins and nuke for five to ten minutes, depending one the strength of your microwave. You can quarter the potatoes to achieve really quick cooking time)  Do the eggs at the same time, while also cooking the bacon, which is actually what takes the longest time.  I used jarred, but REAL bacon bits once when really in a hurry. And, for pity sake, chop the onion and celery while everything else cools. If you do cook the bacon from scratch a tiny (1 tsp or less) bit of the fat is a great addition.

Great!  I made this recipe with a little less celery but wished I would have used more.  It was wonderful.  I brought it to a picnic and received many compliments.

Everyone liked this potato salad, but man, was it time consuming!  And given all the work that went into it, I didn't think it stood out THAT much above other potato salads.  I used half mayo and half sour cream, green onion instead of white, and added some garlic paprika dip mix that I had on hand.

This is very much like my mom's key recipe without the bacon and onions. She liked it sort of bland, but I do not! I use everything in this recipe with 2 more stalks of celery (I love the cool crunch of celery). Instead of plain pepper I use the lemon-pepper seasoning by McCormick. Another switch I make is celery salt instead of regular salt. It doesn't add as much sodium but twice as much flavor!

Probably a little too much mayonnaise but we LOVE mayo so it didn't stop us from scarfing it all down!  Absolutely delicious.  I would make this for company but next time will start with a cup of mayo and add more if needed. Also, I wish I had made this the night before because the potatoes didn't have enough time to really soak up the flavors when I served it but the next day the potato salad was so much better.  So if you can, make ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  YUMMY!!
UPDATE: Cut the mayonnaise in half the next time I made it and it was wonderful. And we normally LOVE mayonnaise but it was just too much. This time, my husband couldn't stop eating it! He had two helpings at dinner and I caught him getting into the fridge more than once after dinner so he could scoop out a big bite-full with his finger. So yummy!

My sister thinks she makes the best potato salad in the world, and I was bound and determined to make a better one.  After trying this recipe, I think I've succeeded!   I was making it for a large crowd, so I doubled most of the ingredients except for the bacon (kept that at 1 lb) and the mayonnaise (3.5 cups plus 2 tbsp spicy dijon mustard).  After reading some of the other reviews, I also added a few snips of dill. This potato salad was to die for!!!  It is easy to make, but rather time consuming.  Next time I make it, I'll cook the potatoes and eggs the night before, and just do the chopping and assembly the day I'm going to serve it.  YUM!

One reviewer seemed irate that lots of folks were ranking this recipe 5 stars all while listing their several modifications to the recipe; to that reviewer, I say "pfffft!" If you know your flavor profiles & know what you like, GO FOR IT! I took many of the suggestions & incorporated them into what turned out to be the MOST delicious salad I have tasted. I cut 3lbs potatoes into cubes and boiled for 12 minutes. Added 1/2 cup white onion, 1 cup green onion. 3 celery stalks. 6 eggs. 1lb bacon, pan fried to VERY crispy. Dressing was 3/4 cup mayo, 3/4 sour cream with a tablespoon of creamy horse radish. Mixed together with fresh chopped dill, salt & fresh ground pepper. I will say, mix well together first & then add the salt as I did not account for the saltiness of the fried bacon. BIG FLAVOR IMMEDIATELY & BIG HIT AT THE PARTY for those who like the bolder flavor profiles. I'm still ranking this recipe a 5 star since it gave me the base for a 6 star potato salad!

This was very nice. I have to confess however that I changed the dressing a bit.( I know... it makes me mad when people review a recipe, and change this, omit that, double that, etc, etc.) The only thing that I did that was different was to make the dressing with mayo and ranch dressing. It was very tasty. I cant tell how much of each, as I just went by taste.

This potato salad is the best I've ever made. There are two reason I give it 4 stars and not 5:  #1.Too much mayo. I was careful to weigh the potatoes and use exact measurements so if you do this, I suggest cutting the mayo back 1/2 cup and it would be just right.  #2. Be careful what you serve this with as the large amount of bacon has a strong flavor. It is DELICIOUS potato salad but it will compete with other meats. We served this salad at Christmas with ham (another salty meat), and the two meats were a little much. Next time I make this I will serve it with milder meats, or cut back a little on the bacon.

My first time making potato salad with red skinned taters and after the 2 thumbs up I got from the husband, I'll be using red skinned taters from now on. I had no bacon in the house ( the world is surely ending soon) so had to leave it out and I had to add a giant squirt of mustard. Old habits die hard. This is a simple, tasty recipe. I might also add that after the taters have boiled long enough, I submerse them in cold water to stop the cooking process.  This recipe is a keeper. Sorry, there's no photo. The husband inhaled the tater salad before I could get a good one.

Great  recipe! I chopped the potatoes and bacon before I cooked them,  made it a lot easier.  I also boiled my potatoes in chicken broth.  Added a little parsley for color and was good to go.

I was cooking for 18 people so I used 3 lbs of potatoes & 8 eggs & adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. I used real bacon bits (about a cup) & lite mayo & I was sure to mince the eggs, onions & celery very fine. I made this the day before but didn't add the bacon until I served it. And I made a couple of additions (couple of tbps. of spicy brown mustard & about 2 tbps. of chopped fresh dill). This resulted in the perfect potato salad! At least that what's nearly 15 people told me. ;o) Almost everbody at the get-together proclaimed this the best potato salad they had ever had. I'm throwing out all my other potato salad recipes!!!!

after following the directions and ingredients as the recipe stated, i changed a few things to my liking. first, the potatoes need to boil for at least 20 minutes, otherwise they are still too raw. i like a lot of eggs in my potato salad, so i actually doubled those. i would also reduce the amount of onions a 1/4 cup and instead of chopped celery I would use a tbsp of celery seed. i ended up using light mayonnaise and more than the recipe calls for. i also used a little miracle whip too. i was surprised it didn't call for any mustard and like this recipe better with 1 tbsp of dijon mustard added. finally, add a dash or two of paprika, garnish with sliced eggs and paprika, and its perfect. this was a good starter recipe for me and i think the red potatoes are key to the classic potato salad taste.

MY FAVORITE... and a HUGE hit at the BBQ. I will definitely be making this again... and again. Instead of onions, I did use scallions. Don't forget to salt/pepper. YUM YUM YUM... Thanks for sharing.

Oh man, was this potato salad yummy! I made it on the 4th of July for 8 guests, and I should have doubled the recipe. There were no leftovers, and I was really hoping for some! I did make a few changes suggested by the other reviewers. I used just 3/4 of a pound of bacon, and just 1 1/2 cups of mayo. I substituted green onions, and added a dollop of mustard, as well as a tablespoon of pickle juice. I also cut my potatoes into bite-sized pieces before cooking them, and cut the boiling time down to 12 minutes. I will definitely be making this again.

We love this potato salad. To make it more personal, I like to add in chopped green onion, a little hot sauce, dijon mustard, maybe a little chopped chives and sometimes I'll use half mayonnaise/half sour cream. If I have it, this is also good with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. This gets better the longer it sets, so make it early in the am before your potluck/family dinner.

Excellent!  I believe that using just mayonnaise, as in the recipe, is the best way to make this.  I made mine with Golden potatoes. (They're my favorite.) And as many a cook will tell you, the secret to great potato salad is cooking the potatoes whole and skins on, then chopping.  They have a much creamier texture!  Also, my hint on cooking the bacon is to cut it into cubes before cooking.  Much easier. Way to go Donna! Incredible recipe!  p.s.  My very picky boyfriend called this (along with Baked Slow Cooker Chicken Recipe) the best meal he's had in a VERY long time!!

Family enjoyed this potato salad.  I did omit the celery, since none of us care for it.  I added diced dill pickles instead to keep with the green color and crunch.  We loved the addition of the pickles.  This was a great side to our turkey burgers and was very easy to make not having to peel the potatoes.

I'm asked to bring this salad to a lot of get-togethers! Not too much bacon, perfect! I also sauteed the onions in olive oil to take some of the kick out of them.

although I did not use red potatoes- this recipe was NOT the best, and it DID lack in a LOT of ways... good BASE... but not much more. 
to start- making it easier is to chop the potatoes into chunks and then boil. definitely cool... CRUCIAL! the eggs were on par, but I already had some boiled. BUT... THE EGG COUNT IS TOOOO MUCH! even making half the recipe- TOO MANY EGGS! Start with 1-3 and add more as needed. I would also recommend adding the rest of the 'dressing/seasoning' ingredients as needed. the full amount of some is terribly overpowering! there is also NO paprika mentioned... a TRUE potato salad has paprika... AND MUSTARD. add in a little bit of chopped green onion for a kick, but this is just a standard recipe that lacks what a REAL potato salad with what ensures people say, "WOW- THAT WAS GOOD!" 
I added a bit of mustard, a touch of garlic powder, a small bit of diced sweet(or dill) pickles, less egg, less mayo, more pepper, some paprika and a bit of shredded carrot & pimentos, diced. 
if you want it simple- skip the garnish and just add the mayo, mustard & seasonings to desired taste. add extra garnish for a kick. but this is NOT a 5 star... this needs work and not just the basic ingredients. sorry. I had to modify this to meet expectations. the recipe, as written, is the equality of less than store-bought value.

This tasted great when I made it, but I only gave it 3 stars because it has some obvious flaws. 2 cups of mayonnaise would have been disgusting. I only put 1 and it was plenty moist. The other problem was that I tasted too much onion. I only put about 3/4 an onion and also added some green onion. I would probably back off on the amount of hard-boiled eggs in the recipe too.

I liked these, but thought that the mayo was a bit overpowering.  I will take another reviewer's advice with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I loved the bacon with the potatoes...the crunch was just the right touch and flavor.  Great recipe, thanks for the post.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  This is the best potatoe salad I've ever had.  Even better the 2nd and 3rd days.  It takes a while though to make, and I cook my potatoes longer than the recipe states - I'm very picky about my potatoes being done.  My husband begs me for this about once a week.  YUM!!

This recipe was alright.  Though more people at the party liked it than not I found it a little heavy on bacon and low on flavor.  Others agreed.  I have a TON of leftovers.  I wouldn't make this again.  The rave reviews actually baffled me.

This is an excellent concoction. I'm giving it 4 stars because when I followed Debbie2's advice, substituting Miracle Whip and sour cream for mayo, it was more amazing! The proportion was 1.5:1. I think celery has an aftertaste and didn't use that. Used finely diced sweet onion. Separated the yolks from the white when the eggs were chopped. I made the dressing mixture in a separate bowl. Whisked the egg yolks, salt and pepper with the dressing. Then gently mixed the dressing into the  bowl of dry ingredients.

Made how stated, except added one-package dry ranch dressing mix and a little milk to the mayo to thin it out, and added scallions in stead of just plain ol' onion.  Yummy!

This is an amazing recipe.  After reading some of the reviews that it was a little bland i was a little worried so I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting down the mayo by 1/2 cup and did use fresh bacon and not bacon bits.  I feel the real bacon (a little bacon grease) is what gives this recipe the perfection it needs.  Make sure you refrigerate the salad so all the ingredients can marry.  I wish there was a 6+ star rating.  I will definitely keep this recipe for years to come.

Thank you Donna, you posted a recipe that will be passed down to my daughter in the years to come.

Made this recipe several times with all rave reviews from friends and family.  It's a 5 star as written.  I've added a pound more potatoes to stretch and would still rate a 5!  Only change is I add 1 Tbsp of mustard to the mayo.

LOVED THIS! I made this for a party where there were 3 other potato salads.  Everyone asked who made mine, they loved it!  Thank you!

Great recipe!! The one thing I would recommend is a seasoning by McCormicks called Salad Supreme. 2 to 3 tablespoons will give an amazing flavor to an already great recipe!!

Hands down, this is THE best potato salad that I have ever eaten!  The texture is perfect when you follow the instructions exactly.  The potatoes stay firm, the eggs are in just the right amount and the bacon ... well the bacon just takes it over the top!   No need to serve with meat.  It's complete as is.  I can no longer eat plain old potato salad.  This has ruined us for anything but.

For sure a 5! We had stop-in guests at our house and I happened to have made the potato salad because someone had just given me a lot of small red potatoes.  The gentleman said that this is probably the best potato salad I've ever tasted! I did add two tablespoons of Ranch Dressing and used one less cup of mayonaisse (I use Miracle Whip) 1 tsp of vinegar and 1 tsp of sugar. Everyone took more than one helping.I did not use onion and used an extra stalk of celery and some chopped green peppers I had on hand.With the small red potatoes, I did not even have to cut them up, just chopped them when they were done cooking.

This was a great potato salad. Got rave reviews and was all gone at the last party I served it. The only changes I made were to use 3 pounds of potato and I add some chopped spring onions. Definitely a keeper.

We made this for the Super Bowl to serve along with ribs, and it came out great. I used a red onion just because that's our personal preference and added a tiny bit of yellow mustard too. We loved it and will definitely make this one again. The bacon is a great touch!

I didn't add 2 cups of mayo, I used about 1/2 cup of mayo and some sour cream, lightly coated, the flavor comes through when it isn't heavily sauced.

I love this recipe!! I served it at a pig roast, and every one loved it. The only change I made was to the onions. I don't enjoy raw onions, so I sauteed them in some of the remaining bacon fat before adding them to the salad. Not at all healthy, but deliscious!!

Easy to make and oh so delicious! My future mother in law loves this potato salad! Every time I make this I honestly make a double batch so that we have some leftovers. The review about the bacon not getting soggy (if you crisp it well) is true! I use to make the classic potato salad but this is all I make now!

WOW WEE!! This is so delicious, I cannot even begin to tell you. I made it last night for a bbq dinner tonight, and I cannot keep from going to the fridge to grab just one more bite. I think what really makes it is the bacon. I did add a little bit of mustard, and used the new olive oil mayo to cut a bit of fat out of it. Absolutely fabulous. I will not use another recipe ever!!

Very Good Potato Salad as is. The secnd time around I had no bacon in the house so made it without - requires more salt when bacon is left out but still very yummy. I always make my potato salads 1-2 days prior to serving as the flavors meld and become more tasty! Thank!

very much like my own and very adaptable.  if you dont want the calories etc then use bacos or turkey bacon & fat free sour cream or greek yogurt with a low fat mayo.  honest you get the same results.  I sometimes use feta cheese in mine.  it all depends how your family made it whether you add the pickle relish or not.  I love mine just like the recipes reads.  thanks for sharing.

Way too much mayo, it actually upset my stomach when I tried a cup.  Maybe needed more potatoes, and pickles or something.  The mayo was just too overpowering for me.

My best friend, my husband, and I all agree this is the best potato salad any of us have ever had!!! I could eat this stuff by the truck load, so addicting. I followed the recipe almost exact, making sure the bacon was extra extra crispy and crunchy. My only additions were to do about one part sour cream and two parts mayo, about 2 tsp dijon mustard, and about 2 tsp red wine vinegar. It was so so soooo yummy.

Wow! This was a huge hit at my friends' cookout. I thought we had twice as much as we needed but there was only scoop left at the end! I added paprika and cayenne pepper, definitely think it needs that. I thought it might have had one too many eggs but several people said the amount of eggs was perfect. Yum, will definitely make this again.

I have been making this salad for about 2 years.  It is the best recipe.  It is better than a traditional potato salad.  I added some yellow mustard and green onions.  Also, I cook and dice the potatoes, add salt and pepper and let set in the refrigerator over night.  Thnak you for sharing with us.

Very tasty!!   I brought this to a fathers day bbq, and everyone loved it!!  I did make a couple of changes.  I boiled the potatoes and eggs the night before, then assembled about 3 hrs before the bbq.  I did use half light mayo and half fat free sour cream, only used about 1 1/2 c. total.  Added dill, fresh black pepper, garlic salt and about a cup of finely shredded 2% cheddar cheese.  This made a ton, and I had some left over, it was just as good the second day.  I will definately make this again.  
A great recipe, thanks!!

My grandma taught me how to make this potato salad.  SOOO good!  I use a sweet vidalia onion and saute it in the bacon grease with a few teaspoons of vinegar.  Mix it all together and eat some while the potatoes are still warm.  YUMMY!!

This recipe is great, I always get compliments on it and am asked to make it for family gatherings (and I don't even like potato salad, so I wouldn't know if it tasted good or not!). The only changes I've made are to chop up the potatoes before cooking them, and to use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayonnaise. Thanks for submitting it!

This recipe is fantastic. This was my first time making potato salad and all my guests raved about it and everyone wanted copies of the recipe.  In accordance with other reviewers, I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  I also added some garlic powder.  I used the real bacon bits you buy at the store and that was a big time saver.  I will definitely be making this again.

I love this! The bacon is a neat touch that everyone likes.  I get requests for this dish.  My mom likes marinated potatoes in her salad, so once I let the potatoes sit in Italian dressing over night then followed the rest of the recipe and that was good too.  THANKS!!!

Five star recipe!  Great potato sald and I should know, I'm from Idaho!  This should be eaten fresh.  Try adding different things like radishes, olives or bits of cheese and see how verstile this salad is!

Loved this recipe. I didn't add the celery but instead added a few chopped dill pickles. I also diced the potatoes before cooking to speed up the process. Added a small amount of yellow mustard to give it alittle tange that my family likes. Everyone loved the bacon in the salad. The bacon does get soggy the next day but the salad was still great!!

I had no idea making pot salad was so easy! I cut the potatoes before cooking- they cook evenly & faster. I like onions & bacon, but will use less next time.

Tripled this recipe for a party yesterday.  Great success.  Changes based on reviews: used a bunch of green onions in lieu of the onion, tripled the celery and added spicy mustard.  Prepared the day before, sliced and fried the bacon as well, but did not combine until one hour before the event.  In the future I will also reduce the amount of mayo.

Very oniony, but otherwise amazing! I just think the next time I do it I will use one half of an onion and then substitute with a little more celery.

EDIT: Added one tablespoon of spicy mustard, an extra pound of potatoes, replaced one cup of mayo for sour cream and also added a dash of paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.

This was pretty good. It's really nice looking in the bowl, but there is something missing for the flavor. It was a bit too mild for my taste. I may add some sour cream or something next time.

Good Base Potato Salad. Did not have much flavor with the recipe as listed. So I Added 1 C. Sour Cream, 1 C. Hellmans, Added Bunch of Green Onion Chopped, Dried Dill, Mustard and Relish to taste. I also used turkey bacon extra crispy. In place of regular bacon. With those changes the recipe is flavorful and delicious.

Awesome and so easy to make.  I didn't have any bacon, but I did have some ham and baked chicken.  It tasted really good and I'm sure I will get comments from coworkers!

I didn't think this was that good.  I thought it sounded really good.  I don't know.  The bacon kind of took away from the pototo salad flavor, and I'm all for something a little different but  I just didn't think the flavors meshed well together.  I won't be making this again.

This was a pretty good recipe. I added a few of my own ingredients like mustard and banana peppers to get more of a tangy taste but overall it was very tasty.

This salad is so simple and delicious! I made a couple alterations and it still turned out great! I opted for ham (we didn't have any bacon) and red and green peppers rather than celery and onion (again we had none). Thanks for posting!

I used three pounds of potatos instead of two and two cups of mayo would have made potato mayo soup. Maybe I'm just not used to soupy mayonaisie potato salad, BUT the bacon redeemed it.

Added fresh chives and parsley. Used a mix of mayonnaise and miracle whip. Replace the onion with 4 green onions. Only added the bacon before serving the salad so it wouldn't get soggy.

This recipe is excellent.  the only change I made besides scaling it down to 3 servings was to add a little yellow mustard.  I also made one mistake.  I chopped the veggies too large.  Other than that it was perfect.   whole family loved it.

This is the best recipe I've found for potato salad on this site so far. The bacon really tops it off. It is a little time consuming but yummy in the end. I would've used a little more celery and then left out the salt (the bacon already makes it salty).

This was a huge hit when we last entertained!  4 people devoured the whole batch within 2 days!  I diced the potatoes before boiling, used BACOS instead of bacon, used 1/2 miracle whip, 1/2 light sourcream as others said, green onions, and then I let my dog eat the egg yolks and only added diced egg whites!  Hard to believe that you can have an excellent tasting, nearly cholesterol free potato salad!  Hats off to an excellent recipe that is already being requested again!

This was really good - I used all the ingredients, but in slightly different amounts.  I did use half Duke's mayo and half sour cream (and not nearly 2 cups total).  I made it the night before our party and crumbled bacon on it right before serving.

I gave this 3 stars AS WRITTEN -- too much mayo & celery -- but with some modification, I think it can become the pot salad I've been looking to replicate.  The changes I made to this recipe and ended up with a pretty good salad (hubby loved it!): no eggs (Hate 'em!), 1/2mayo-1/2sour cream, some fresh dill, and about a teaspoon white wine vinegar (this is the KEY!)  Next time I'll use even less mayo, more sour cream, less celery, and absolutely the vinegar -- it lighten and livens up a too rich pot salad.

My husband and I thought this was the best potato salad. I used 5 eggs instead of 6. I used Hellmann's low fat mayo and only used 1 1/2 cups, which was plenty. I also used a little less bacon because my daughter and her friend ate a few slices before I put it in the salad. Make this a day ahead of time.

Based on taste, this recipe is 5 stars - but it is labor-intensive!  I did the 1 cup mayo & 1 cup sour cream mix, and I also used green onions vs. a regular white one.  Put in a little dill, celery salt and white pepper as well.  The taste is really fantastic, and will likely be the only recipe I'll ever use in the future.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

Excellent potato salad! I cooked the potatoes for 20 min because they were still crunchy after just 15 min. Also, I lightly sauteed the onion and celery instead of putting them in fresh. And I substituted sauteed mushrooms for the bacon. With these minor variations, the recipe is superb!!

I found this to be a disapointment. I read the reviews and thought it was going to be great. Everyone i had over for dinner did not like it. It has way too much celery. Sorry, won't be making this again.

This potato salad was great. Very interesting flavor. I substituted Miracle Whip for the mayo. I would suggest half Miracle Whip and half mayo. With it all Miracle Whip it was way too tangy. Loved the bacon taste! I used real bacon bits instead. If you don't cut up the potatoes to cook them, it has to boil for about 45 minutes. Definately a keeper.

I needed something quick for a Fourth of July barbecue that was planned at the last minute.  Having never made potato salad in my life, I looked for something quick and easy made with ingredients I all ready had.  I left out the celery, used one less egg, used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, used only a third of an onion (I don't like onions in most dishes), and I had to serve it rather warm.  The potato salad was good on the Fourth, but I really, really liked in after it had a few hours to cool.  My husband and I ate almost the entire recipe in just a couple of days.  It was delicious. I wouldn't change a thing!!

This is a very nice recipe for potato salad that I plan on making again soon. I used "light" mayonaise, & I cut the potatoes before cooking. This way I don't have to allow them to cool, and they are also easier to cut.  Thanks Donna for a great recipe!

This salad was great!  But next time I would advise boiling the potatoes longer than the recipe called for.

Super delicious. I followed advice of others and used green onions and I used half mayo half sour cream. Oh and I added carrots too because I wanted something else in there for color and health benefits. Turned out great! Thank you for sharing and great tips this salad was a hit and it makes a lot! The green onions and carrots made it super pretty to set out on the table too.!

If I could give this zero stars I would.  15 minutes was not a long enough cook time.  I boiled the potatoes for an extra 3 minutes.  That was not long enough.

I tried this and found it to be kind of bland. Bacon and mayo are a good combination, but I like some chopped green pepper, a little mustard and a splash of cider vinegar give potato salad better flavor.

This came out really good, the only thing I added was about 1/2 cup more mayo only because it was a little dry for my taste. definitely a keeper.

Thanksgiving 2017. Really good!! I tried another users idea and cubed the potatoes first. I did add bacon bits and only 1 cup of mayo. It is soooo good! 

Back again: This was a request from my daughters for Christmas 2017.  Added turkey bacon and that was a no go, trial and error. Since my girls don't do pork, i'll just leave the bacon out period. Oh and I didn't use the yolk, only the white of the egg.

I tried this recipe twice and loved it each time. For those questioning the mayo to potatoes ratio, I believe it is spot on. The first time I made it, I made it just like the recipe said and it was 5-Stars. Second time, I added a bit of green onion, 2 teaspoons of mustard, and 2 teaspoons of creamy horse radish. I liked it just as much! Really great recipe. The only issue, is that I found that my red potatoes had to be cooked a bit longer. I also had very big red potatoes though.

I've made this for multiple gatherings and have been begged for the recipe. Such a unique twist on a classic! I usually make a dish with and without onion to appease everyone and both always come out empty.

Delicious! A little too much mayo.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup Hellmans and 1/2 cup Miracle whip.  Then add more to taste. I did not use bacon, but added 3 stalks of celery for extra crunch.

Everyone really liked this. I did what someone else had done by useing some sour cream in place of some of the the mayo. I also used green onions instead of regular onions.  I fixed the entire 3 lb bag of potatoes when I fixed this so I used 1 1/2 cups mayo and 1 cup sour cream. As with most things like this you mix up the sauce or coating and taste it till it taste goods.  Then you know it will be good when you add the main ingredient

All the raves are true!  This is one of the best potato salads I've ever made.  I usually make the recipe just as written the first time, but this time my husband bribed me, saying that he would wash the bacon pan if I would add a little mustard.  Who can turn down an offer like that?  So I added a couple of tablespoons of yellow mustard, which gave it a nice subtle bite.  I wish I had saved out half of the bacon to add right before serving.  The crunch from the bacon was great when I first made this and tasted for seasoning.  By the next day at picnic time, that crunch was gone, though the whole thing had a good bacon-y flavor.

5 stars for the recipe AS IS. (Although I reduced the mayo a tad)  This was delicious and well balanced.  All 5 in my family loved it.  
3 stars for the leftovers, though. The next day the onions took over & the bacon turned chewy.  If you aren't serving 12 people, cut the recipe!

This recipe was delicious! I had never made potato salad before and was very doubtful about my abilities. I chose not to use the eggs because I'm not a fan, and I followed some of the reviews and used green onion instead of white, which gave it an amazing flavor. The salad was even better the second day as left overs! I highly recommend this recipe to everyone, especially those of you who have never made a potato salad before. It's easy, cheaper, and more delicious than anything you can buy at the market.

So far, five stars!  I did as someone suggested and used half sour cream, green onions, and added some grated cheddar.  I can't keep my fingers out of the bowl!  Stuffed it into the fridge until dinner, I think the combined flavours could only get better sitting in there a while.  Next time I'll mix in the mayo, sour cream and bacon while the potatoes are still warm, but I'm not disappointed as it is.  Thank you!

Really liked the recipe but cut the mayo down by half and that was still quite a bit. Also added 2 tablespoons of mustard. The bacon really makes this yummy.

made this last night and was thinking it was only a 3 star recipe when I had it for dinner a couple hours after I made it. It was good, but too mayonaisse-y for my liking.

However, When I ate it again for lunch today it was AMAZING. the flavors really melded together overnight and it just tasted so much better.

I also didn't wipe the excess grease from my bacon. i just took  them out of the pan and put them on a plate to cool. then i chopped the bacon into small pieces and put the greasy bacon in the salad. probably not necessary, but the bacon flavor in the salad is AWESOME. and who doesn't love bacon??

This potato salad turned out great! I made very few modifications -- only green onions instead of yellow (per other reviewers) and I used half mayo and half sour cream (gave it more of a "loaded baked potato" taste). I was also in a rush, so I chopped the potatoes first and pressure cooked them for 4 minutes. Will definitely do this one again!

This is excellent and my new go to potato salad to take to a picnic.  I followed the suggestion to cut the potatoes cut into bite sized pieces seasoned with fresh rosemary, salt and pepper and drizzled with olive oil.  I used 1/2 of the mayonnaise cutting the onion early in the day, placing it into the mayonaise to mellow the flavor.  I added a very small amount of Dijon mustard and omitted the bacon as it was already too good and didn't need it.

I have made this several times and everybody loves it! The last time I made it I sauteed the onion in the bacon grease and used green bell pepper instead of celery. I think it was the best tasting yet!

First, I must say that I do not really like potato salad; I do not like eating food with mayonnaise that other people have made. That being said, I made this because my husband wanted potato salad with our beef and chicken kabobs today and he was going to buy it from the grocery store. Since I had 3 lbs. of red skin potatoes sitting around, I thought I would have a go at it and see how good I could make it. I can't really rate this recipe in its pure form because I didn't add the bacon (per husband's request) and I used light miracle whip 1-1/4 cup), light sour cream (1/2 cup) and Mucky Duck mustard (1/4 cup). I also added garlic powder, salt and pepper, and topped it off with Hungarian paprika. So as I made it, I would say that it was pretty good-definitely much better than anything commercial. I think I would have liked it better the first day if I had used either more sour cream or regular mayonnaise. The Miracle Whip made it a little too tangy. On day 2, however, it was great and I would give it 4.5 stars (not 5 because I'm still notthe biggest potato salad fan).

This was very good.  I cut the mayo down to 1 1/3 cups and it was plenty creamy.  I also added some garlic powder and, like many people here, changed the white onion to green onion and it tasted great!

This Potato salad was simply a cut above and beyond other potato salads Ive made.
The only things I changed was use a bacon that was thick in nature and has lots of smoked flavor.(You can get a good grade of bacon from your butcher.) I also cooked my potatoes about 3/4 of the way so they had a bit of crunch to them. Also use fresh ground pepper.Wonderful recipe that did not last.I will use this recipe time and time again!

This is the great. Best if you serve same day and do not Refrigerate before serving. Perpare everything a head and then assemble. Most important use fresh mayo that has not been put in the frig either. Trust me, It is the best way.  I use Hormel real bacon bits also

The potato salad needed some zing so I added a couple Tbl spoons of relish.  It was very well liked at the party I hosted.

I've been making a potato salad similar to this for the last 50 years, it was my mom's recipe.  I add a shredded carrot for color and a small breen bell peper, chopped, for flavor.  I never had soggy bacon ever.  For the sauce I use spicy mustard, worcestshire sauce a splash of hot sauce, a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and about a 1/2 cup of milk, salt and pepper and mayo, of course.  I incorporate the eggs and onion (it cuts the sharpness of the onion that way) into the dressing and mix it all together in a blender.  Its always been a favorite and I get request to make it for family gatherings and I get lots of requests for the recipe.

Very good.... but next time, to make it better, I will omit half of the bacon (and I do really like bacon), lessen the total dressing amount, use sr. cream for half of the mayo, and add a dash of vinegar or mustard for a little tang.

This is the same potato salad passed down through generations in our family. It is the Perfect potato salad. IMO, we step it up a notch by taking a clove of garlic and rubbing it all over the bowl before putting the ingredients in it. We also use green onions instead of regular. Yum, can't wait to have some tomorrow - it always tastes better the second day!

Excellent!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  I have to be honest, I do not care much for potato salad but this was delicious.  I did not have celery but I did use 1/4 cup of relish.  Thank you!

This was maybe the best potato salad I've ever eaten, and I'm definitely a "my Momma's potato salad is the best of all" kind of guy.  Very versatile too; with a few tweaks, you can make it sweeter or tangier depending on your preferences.  Absolutely LOVED it.  Thanks!

very good recipe. I don't like bacon so i took that out and I added a splash of red wine vinegar to brighten it up (since it now didn't have the smoky aspect from the bacon). I also used Yukon gold potatoes because it is what i had lying around and i am a broke college student but it worked out well with them too.

I used the recipe for a big costume party. I thought I should double the recipe.  Then I had about 7 pounds of potatoe salad.  Yet to my utter astounsishment it was all gone in 2 hours, and was the rave out of the spread.  Took a long time to make, but well worth it.

I've been making this salad for a couple years now and it's still our favorite. It's a bit time consuming, but totally worth it! I get asked to make this for all sorts of events and have given out the recipe multiple times. For us we've found it's key to use Best Foods Mayo (Regular or Light works, but the Low Fat changes the flavor too much) and Bar-S brand bacon (1 pack). I've found it helpful to cut the potatoes before boiling them, and to slice the bacon into 1cm pieces before cooking instead of trying to crumble it after.

Very, Very Good Potato Salad! Followed recipe exactly and everyone really liked it. Even some of the little ones that usually pass on potato salad asked for seconds. Remember to plan enough time for it to rest in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving so flavors can marry. Thanks for sharing!!

Warning: DO NOT FREEZE.  One mistake I will not be making again.  Of course, I was an idiot and didn't realize that mayonnaise does NOT freeze well.  Since I'm a single person I like to freeze everything I make, and don't even bother with this dish if you are planning on keeping it over a few days, doesn't keep well and gets gross-looking in just a few days.  Use right away if you make it.  First time I made this I made the potatoes too 'mushy'.  Red skinned potatoes are not to be undertaken lightly!  Second time I made it, the potatoes were too hard.  Don't know if it is my own taste when it comes to potato salad, but this is definitely not it!

Absolutely amazing! Crispy bacon is essential! SOOO good! You have to try it. I tried it as is and it was great(minus the celery b/c im not a huge fan) i tried it again with chopped dill pickles, a little sugar, a little evaporated milk and a spoonful of mustard...it made it nice and moist without watering it down. Amazing!

I'm not a potato salad eater, but my family loves it so I decided to make this. I tried it and it was awesome.The mix of the eggs in it enhanced the mayo flavor and the bacon added a nice saltiness and smoky flavor that really make it yummy!! I may be a potato salad eater afterall - thanks to this recipe. Note it taste better once it set s for a few hours.

Great as is, did use green onions and only a 1/2 lb bacon...also had to boil potatoes for a tad longer than 15 minutes. Very good

Five * all the way (w/ my mods, of course!)!!!!! I LOVED this!!! Took a lg., heaping bowlful to my friend's cookout last Sun. I have a little leftover (there were only 4 of us) - but not much :) Unfortunately, my fiance didn't care for this. He blamed the "yuckiness" on the cheese.... I too like wifeyluvs2cook, gave Donna's recipe an updated twist by making it a "loaded" baked potato salad. By mistake, I picked up russetts instead of reds (oops!), but in the end, I think that was a good move. I found that cubing my potatoes into small pieces & then boiling in salted H2O for ~ 8 min. yielded a perfect, tender consistency. After my potatoes were cooked, I immediately drained & placed them in a lg. bowl in my fridge while I mix. the mayo/sour cream together (a little less than 1 c. ea. as it was all I had on hand) & chopped an entire bunch of green onions. To streamline prep, I used 1/2 of a 3 oz. pouch of real bacon pieces (i.e. Hormel) & nearly an entire pkg. of Kraft cheese crumbles (a combo of cheddar, colby & monterey jack is all I could find at my local grocer). A final seasoning of garlic powder, a pinch of paparika & s/p to taste produced the BEST potato salad I have EVER tasted (really!). I think it would be fun to mash some of the potatoes (leaving the rest cubed) for a "smashed" potato salad & will definitely try that technique next time. Donna, thank you SOOO, SOOO much for providing this great, basic potato salad recipe :)

Swimming in mayo with the full amount, but cut the mayo in half and it is PERFECT! I made this recipe exactly, except for the mayo. I also tried doing half mayo and half sour cream. That was great. The huge amount of mayo is the only thing that I think is faulty in this recipe, otherwise I think it is GREAT!

AWESOME potato salad! I did put some additions though, in a bowl i put 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream, added some paprika, garlic powder, salt, pepper.  I boiled the potatoes already cubed, in salted water.  Then drained and cooled.  Added them to the mayo mixture, with the chopped bacon that i cooked in the oven til crisp, the green onions, and lots of crumbled cheddar cheese.  Stired all together. YUM YUM YUM, tasted like a big mixed baked potato! loved it thanks!

My family's reviews were "onion overpowering", "tastes bland", "needs mustard or something", "what about adding relish." 

I guess I have a tough crowd.

Awesome!! I did use scallions instead of regular onions and did 2/3 mayo, 1/3 Sour cream. Everyone raved about it!! Can't wait to make it again! Thanks! Update: I have made this numerous times and have tweaked it a bit. I season the potato salad with onion, garlic powder, celery salt, season salt, white pepper and whatever else sounds good at the time. I never measure but taste as I go. Also, I have learned from experience that potato salad can lose some flavor when the mayo is mixed and sits for a few hours. I always taste right before serving to see if it needs anything added.

This is a GOOD recipe, even for me...I really don't like bacon in my potato salad. My hubby & daughter ate it up and couldn't stop raving over it. I took it to our last family reunion on Saturday and it was ok, (there was so many other foods there, that it was hard to tell) but over 1/2 of it was gone so I'm thinking people loved it! I would give it 4 and a 1/2 stars but my hubby & kid loved it so I'm gonna give it 5. (...anyone know of a GREAT potato salad recipe without bacon? can you holla please?) Thanks.

This was really good potato salad.  I don't like mustard in my potato salad, so this one fit the bill.  The dressing was a little bland, so I added some celery seed to it.  I also left out the hot sauce (personal preference).  Will make this again.

This was a little too bland for our tastes. So, I added sweet pickle relish and regular mustard to give it that tart taste. I will make it again with the additional ingredients.

I have finally found the perfect potato salad recipe!  The potatoes weren't mushy and I think that putting them in the fridge too cool is the key.  The only changes I made were to use 1 tsp. of celery salt (my husband can't eat raw celery), omit the salt, and I only used 8 slices of bacon.  It was perfect and I will certainly be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT potato salad! I recommend cutting the potatoes into bite-sized chunks before boiling them.  I used Miracle Whip light instead of Mayo. I added about a 1/4 cup dijon mustard, as well as a few dashes of dill. Also, if you use a sweet onion and chop it fine, it becomes a perfect addition without being overpowering. We were out of eggs but this potato salad was so tasty, the eggs were not missed. Tasty stuff!!!

Another was I make red-skinned potato salad is to cut scrubbed red potatos in small bite-sized pieces with skins on and put on a sprayed cookie sheet and bake at 400 degrees for about 25 mins. til done. Let cool. Add your favorite ingredients. In addition to the ingredients listed, I put in frozen cooked peas and shredded cheddar cheese.

One of the best potato salads I have had!!  I loved the addition of the bacon.  I did substitute about 1/4 c. of mayo with mustard, but that was the only change I made.  Delish!

LOVED IT!!

I replaced 1/2 cup of the mayo with ranch dressing, added some stone ground spicy mustard, and doubled the celery. The best potato sald I've ever eaten! Even my daughters (not big potato salad fans) raved over it. Thanks for a great recipe. :)

This was my first time making potato salad and i'm happy to say it was a huge success!!  I followed the recipe exactly, however, i cooked the potatoes a bit longer - 25 minutes and added a bit of pickle juice at the end.  I also used 1 cup regular mayo and 1 cup light.  My husband gave it "two thumbs up" and my sister, who normally doesn't like potato salad, liked this a lot. :)  Definite Keeper!

This is the potato salad recipe I've been searching for!  FANTASTIC and a keeper for sure!  I used 1 cup low-fat mayonaise about 1/2 cup buttermilk ranch dressing to give it some kick as previous users suggested and added just a bit of spicy brown mustard.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous!  I tried fat-free sour cream instead of mayonnaise to make it healthier and it is just delicious.  Using the sour cream makes it quite a healthy dish.  I took it to a potluck gathering and had requests to bring it again at thanksgiving.  It always disappears rather quickly.

First attempt to making potato salad and I couldn't have been happier with the results! I made a few minor adjustments after reading other reviews. I used white potatoes - all I had. I added sour cream and mayo. Used real bacon bits. And totally forgot the onion. Next time I make this, I will use red potatoes and instead of sour cream use honey mustard. And I know I added more garlic powder than called for. Very good recipe, the taste is not your traditional potato salad, but I liked that about this recipe.

Made this for a Labor Day party - it's the best potato salad I have ever had.  Did make a few minor changes - used the green onions as someone suggested.  Also, added about 1/4 apple cider vinegar to the mayonnaise and about 2 tablespoons sugar, just to give the mayonnaise a little kick.  Everyone loved it and had several people ask for the recipe.

One of the nicest potato salads I've made. The bacon is a great touch! I used half sour cream/half mayo as many suggested. My husband asked me to make it again for him, and said it was better than his Grandma's. How can you do better than that? Thanks for a simple, yet wonderful potato salad! YUM!!!

It was a good recipe, a very classic potato salad.  crunchy and yummy.  Maybe just ever so slighly needing a little somethin'-somethin' so i added a little mustard and vinegar.  If i'd had some dill i would have thrown that in.  But overall a very, very good recipe.

I doubled this recipe still using only 1 onion plus I used the sour cream and mayo combo and it was a huge hit at my BBQ!  I would give it a perfect score!  Everyone was so impressed that it was homemade and they all wanted the recipe!

Great Potato Salad Recipe.  I followed what some others said and used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  Used both light varieties and still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.........VAE

Best potato salad I ever ate.  I made this for a large gathering and everyone loved it.  I used half mayo and half extra tangy sour cream and to this I added about 1 - 2 tbsps. of dijon mustard and added a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  Definitely a keeper!!

This was my first attempt at potato salad and it was delicious.  I did make two changes though.  First, I cut the bacon in half and second, I used 1 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 cup Newman's Own Italian Dressing.  A lady I know makes the best potato salad and she said her secret ingredient is some Italian dressing.  Try it!   Thanks for the recipe, it will be used again and again.

Wow, even I who have never made better potato salad than "just OK" for my potato-salad-lovin' hubby pulled it off with this recipe.  He's requested a few times since.  One change I made is cut the mayo and bacon in half; alternatively, double the amount of potatoes.  I also used red onion instead of white and added olives.  Great recipe to play with!

Absolutely delicious.  It is perfect as it is, but I usually make it with half the amount of light mayo to cut the calories a bit and it still tastes great. Great recipe -- makes ordinary potato salad pale in comparison.

This potato salad was perfect and a big hit with my family. Every recipe can be tweaked to match your customer's fancy.  I used a 3-lb bag of reds and increased the mayo proportionately and the onion, but left the rest of the recipe the same. I used a red onion.  I used lite, NOT low fat mayo and added a few chopped up kosher dills, mustard, salt, onion and garlic powder. No one could tell I used lite mayo.  I added the bacon right before it was served.  I used low sodium bacon and it was still very tasty. This is the only potato salad recipe I will make again.

I left out the bacon and used less egg, but I loved it.  I also added some paprika on the top!  Really easy for a first-timer like me! Update: This is now my standard potato salad recipe and I always get compliments on it.  It's so easy, but I think the paprika is the key to adding a little extra flavor. Next time I'll try the new smoked paprika seasonings. I've even mixed in a little creamy ceasar salad dressing to use up a bottle and it was still good.

Excellent  everybody loved.  I added  1/2 cup of sour cream and white pepper to give it a little bit more flavor.
I also agree that  the potato salad tasted better the next day.

This was a very tasty salad.  I used hickory smoked bacon, which was not a good choice.  Avoid that flavor in the salad.  However, I do recommend this recipe.  The bacon and red potato's really make this salad yummy!

Best potato salad, ever. Every place I've ever taken it, and my people at home have said it's incredible. I do add spicy mustard, but even without it this is the easiest and tastiest dish.

Really good just the potatoes need to be in for a longer period of time I would say 25 minutes so it can be soft and well done. Otherwise great recipe, thanks!

This is my absolute favorite potato salad recipe. I have made it almost exactly as is. The only change I make is using light miracle whip instead of mayo since my family prefers it. Also a whole pound of bacon never makes it in since I can't resist eating a couple slices. My husband doesn't like onions and celery, so when I'm feeling nice I will leave them out. It's still pretty good without them, just not as yummy.

This is delicious as written but I always have to change based on my own preference.  My modificaiton is use green onions or purple onion, add a couple of tablespoons of Dijon mustard and instead of celery I cut up baby dill pickles.  Also, I think it is important to make this and blend while the potato and eggs are still warm, then chill it once it is assemble. IMO, all the flavors blend better when warm verse chilled and then mixed.

Very good an easy.  I cut up the potatoes before boiling and after cooling for a bit put them into a gallon ziploc bac with 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  Shake the bag a couple of times to mix.  The vinegar helps cut through the fat of the mayo.

Only other thing is to make sure that your bacon is extra crispy. I've found cooking it in the oven is the easiest way to get it crispy without burning.

I tried this recipe and found the celery had a nice crunch to go with the bacon.  The flavor of the mayo and egg is fantastic mixed together with the potato.  Will definitely be making in the future! Thanks.

I love this recipe. It was so easy and absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and cut back on the mayonnaise. My family loved it!  Wish I could call it my own.

I have made several times, and making today for the holiday weekend. It is the best ever. I use about 3-4 pounds of potatoes and  a bit less bacon. And I add  3 tablespoons of yellow mustard

I made this for a 4th of July picnic, and it went very quickly.  Not a drop left!  Everyone was telling me how much they enjoyed it.  I really liked the bacon in it.  I made only one change that other reviewers had suggested and that was half miracle whip and half sour cream.  Delicious!

Best Potato Salad that I have ever tasted! I've made this one twice and I'll definitely be making it for the rest of my days! I followed the recipe word for word except I used the already made fresh bacon bits that come in a bag. I'd give this recipe 10 stars if it was possible! It's amazing!

Just a hint if you have problems hard boiling your eggs after potatoes are boiling in water add your Eggs i use a spoon and cook only for 10 minutes and take them out run under cold water it keeps eggs from cooking and your yolks are a nice yellow color. Use this for devil eggs or hard boil ones. No more Gray Color. Enjoy

I absolutely loved this recipe - but as someone who is closely watching her calories, I get frustrated when the serving says 1/12 - what I'm much rather see is 1/2 cup, 1 cup, etc.  Sure wish recipes would make it clearer as to the portion amount!

I must say my one frustration is people who rate a recipe and have made so many changes it is unrecognizable from its original version.  It is pointless to rate a recipe if you have made changes to it.  I want to see your ratings when you made it as listed - and then perhaps suggest something you might change for your next time.

i've made this a couple times now. its a nice change up from traditional potato salad. Go easy on the salt...the bacon really adds the flavor. I learned the hard way. Also, you want crispy bacon so it holds up in the dressing.

Absolutely Delicious! I love the bacon ingredient. Took a little time to make, but worth every bit.  Taking to a Family Reunion.  I am sure it will be a hit.

This is the second time ever making potato salad, and I'm so proud of the compliments I received! I halved the recipe as I was only serving 4 (as a side dish for lobster!), and, what can I say? Yummy! I didn't have any bacon, so I crisped up some prosciutto I had left from a sauce I made earlier in the week, and I switched in leeks for the onions...oh! I added a touch of fresh parsley from the garden as well....we all loved it!!! Will definitely be making this one again!

Great recipe, but saw that someone suggested Miracle Whip, instead of mayo.  Heaven forbid putting that disgusting, fake stuff in it - or in any recipe. That's nauseating. Talk about ruining a recipe, in one simple step. Stick to real mayo (or mayo and sour cream, if desired).  Oh and I eplaced the bacon with a bi of grey poupon, for the vegetarians and healthy eaters.

This is the most amazing potato salad. It is always a hit, and I'm always asked for the recipe. I bake the potatoes rather than boiling them and boil the eggs eighteen minutes, maybe mine are larger. I also add the bacon right before serving so it's crunchier. It is best made the night before it leftover, but always incredible. Best part is that when made with homemade mayo this are safe for my whole food-allergy-filled family!!

Delicious! I made 11 pounds of this for a birthday party and it was completely gone by the end of the night. I used half ranch and half mayo for extra flavor but the bacon is what got the attention.  Excellent recipe.

Love this potato salad.  I make this for every potluck-type event and always get compliments.  Instead of two cups of mayo, I actually add one cup of mayo and one cup of horseradish mayo to give it a bit more of a kick.  I also add three stalks of celery rather than just one.

This is about the same recipe my family has used for the past 50 years or more. We have always used green onions and hellmans mayo, and before adding the mayo to the salad we mash up the eggs and mix with the mayo and it seems to make it a different texture.  Just make sure the bacon is very crisp and you wont have to worry about the bacon getting soggy.

First time I have made potato salad. I was nervous taking to a family get together. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Not a bit left! The bacon is what makes it a hit. This will be a summer staple now at our house.

Thank you for this recipe. Now every time my family has a barbecue, party, or picnic, they ask me to bring potato salad!  I make 24 servings, use 2 cups of mayonnaise and 1 cup of sour cream, about 4 green onions sliced thinly, and about 24 slices of thin maple bacon.  I microwaved the bacon in batches--6 slices of bacon for about 6-7 minutes on high between paper towels on a paper plate until it was crispy and then used scissors to cut the bacon up in small pieces.  I used 2 ribs of celery diced. A dozen eggs.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with paprika before serving.  Yum.

As is this would be way too much mayo for my liking! Reducing the mayo to 1 1/2 cups, with only 1/2 lb of bacon, and substituting green onions for white (sauteed with the celery in a little bacon fat) made this awesome potato salad!!

This potato salad was awesome!!  I served it at Easter and it went over great.  My only complaint is that I had to cook the potatoes more like 40 minutes than 15 minutes to get them tender.

Best potato salad I ever put in my mouth. I didn't put onions in it because my husband can't stand them so I used onion powder instead. Even he loved it and he's kind of hard to please sometimes. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very very good!  I cut this down a lot because I was in the mood for potato salad, and I'm cooking for just myself.  I used 2 potatoes, 1 egg, 2 1/2 slices of bacon, a half a stalk of celery n about 1/4 of a small onion.  I also eyeballed the mayo.  So same ingredients just in significantlly smaller amounts.  It's delicious!  Thanks for the recipe - very similar to my own but I usually add mustard.  It's a nice change up!

I love this recipe! My mom actually said it was better than my grandmothers :) I did alter it just a tad but nothing huge. i used green onions instead of another variety. I also used one cup of mayo and one cup of sour cream. Very yummy! And also a great base for experimenting with other flavor additions. A real keeper :)

Classic! I left out the bacon...I divided the end result in two halves and added a few teaspoons of dijon mustard to one of the halves. There was a mayo and a mustard potato salad, yellow and white, side by side, they were awesome!!

Easy and delish - I cubed the potatoes before cooking them and it was so quick to put together.  Would not change a thing on the ingredients.

Great recipe. I am doing it again next week-end but this time I will substitute the onion for green onions to try it out. I didn't take a whole stalk of celery, only a couple sticks is good.

I always use allrecipes, rarely stick to the directions, and have never posted before, but this recipe has got me more compliments than anything else I have made.  We bring it to virtually every barbeque that we go to, and it is the #1 dish every time.

I know that there are a ton of ways to lower calories on this dish, but I just make it exactly the way it shows (although I top it with paprika), and I only make it for parties.

One key I've found is to use the most heavy-duty mayonaise that you can find (dukes, old south, ect) as it makes it extra good (unhealthy).

10 star dish, thanks Donna!

This is a great, simple potato salad recipe.  I have done it as written and also with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I prefer the sour cream blend.   Don't skip the bacon - it is a key ingredient!

This was the first time making patato salad and it was AWESOME!  I've always been nervous making my own and after using this recipe I can honestly say I don't know what took me so long to do it! My mother-in-law was visiting and I wanted to make something easy for a bbq. She told me that from now on when they visit Im to make this potato salad. :o)

I did what some others suggested....cut potatoes first, then boiled and layed on cookie sheet to cool .  sprinkled with red wine vinegar and some dill.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 miracle whip.  I did add some bacon bits for added crunch and flavor!!!  YUMMY.

I was skeptical of this potato salad because of the amount of mayo and lack of any other real seasoning. I followed the recipe exactly and I was pleasently surprised at how good it was. Do not skip the bacon, it definitely gives it a nice flavor as well as adds to the texture.

this was so yummy. i can only give it a 4 because i changed it a little. i was looking for a recipe close to my grandma's and this was the one i found. Instead of mayo i used 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, and 1/4 cup mustard. I used 1 cup green onions, and 1/2 cup radish, as well as 2 tbsp relish, i added garlic powder as well. everyone at todays pot luck loved it...include someone who hates bacon and who is a nutritionalist

I made this yesterday to accompany dinner with close friends... THE BEST potato salad I've ever had! Even one guest who is not fond of potato salad had SECONDS! I hope she sees this review, as she requested I send her the recipe. Minor modifications to my liking- only 1 3/4 c. Mayo, added yellow mustard to taste (probably 1-1 1/2 Tbsp), replaced onion with green onions, minced the celery since it's not a favorite for some, used "real" bacon bits for ease, and omitted salt and pepper so my guests can add as much to their liking as necessary (although no one added any!). Thanks for sharing!

Easy recipe, however, this needs something else to counteract the extreme mayo taste.  Some reviewers recommended 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo... some added miracle whip.  I added miracle whip and quite a bit of spices to counter the icky mayo-- afterward, it was quite good.  Thanks for the basic, easy recipe.  TOO much mayo though... jeez!

This is a great recipe! I stuck more or less to the original recipe aside from the following changes: I used 2 stalks of celery for more crunch, about a third a pound of bacon (more would be nice but I think this was better to cut back on fat and still taste good), added 4 radishes finely chopped and some fresh dill. I also roasted the potatoes in the oven with EVOO and rosemary rather than boiling which makes an incredible flavour in this salad. My only complaint is the 2 cups of mayonnaise - that's WAY too much! Luckily I started with 1 cup so my salad wasn't ruined but I think I'll try 3/4 cup next time since this is still an awful lot of mayo. Aside from this change the recipe is just great - thanks for sharing Donna!

Just made this today and it's delish! =) Only change I made was to use turkey bacon. I just used a little bit of oil to make the bacon crisper. Then used paper towels to remove the grease off the bacon. Thanks for the great recipe Donna.

Used  a combination of 1 cup of mayonnaise and sour cream, but found the quantity was too much. Next time I will cut back and use the light or non-fat. It tasted better the second day.

This was a good START to an awesome recipe. It needs seasoning. I added ground mustard and garlic powder and that definitely helped it!

The best potatoe salad ever.  My daughter made it for a 4th of July Bar-b-que and it was soooo good she made another batch for home.  Was a hit, everyone wanted the recipe.  Did not change a thing.

Good base recipe, but I exchanged a homemade dressing for the mayo and used peas instead of celery (hey, gotta use what's in the house!). I made a homemade dressing out of fat-free greek yogurt, sour cream, brown spicy mustard, and a splash of vinegar. It turned out wonderfully!

Very good potato salad. I was well received at the party it took it to. Used half mayo and have sour cream, some dill pickle juice, and precooked bacon bits. What was nice was to be sitting next to someone commenting on the great potato he was  eating not knowing that I made it! I mean most people don't thing a guy makes potato salad!! LOL

My first foray into making potato salad... It's resting in the fridge, but I've snitched enough to tell you that i'm going to be very popular this 4th of July evening in Iowa!

Time consuming, for sure (cooking the bacon, etc). I diced the potatoes to about 1/2" cubes BEFORE cooking in well-salted water (no other salt added to this dish) poured hot water over to cover, and they were nearly done when they came to a boil.  So, a big time saver, but easy to get mush if you aren't careful. 

I made the entire dressing, half Helman's and half sour cream, to which I added the celery and green onions, and black pepper, then layered cooled potatoes, chopped egg, dressing, several times, so that I did not have to over-stir and there were no pockets of ingredients.

As good as this tastes now, I think it will be even better tonight after it comes together a little.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!  I'm concerned that people are going to ask me to bring this dish to more gatherings now, but I suppose that with practice, I'll get faster at it :-) Happy fourth, everyone!

The recipe calls for way to much onion and too many eggs.  All I taste is onions and three eggs would have been plenty.   I've always gotten rave reviews from mine but I wanted to try something different.  Keep out the bacon and save that for the German potato salad.

I don't typically review recipes, but after making this potato salad, I had to.  It is FABULOUS.  I took other reviewers suggestions and ended up using less eggs, adding green onions and combining 1 cup mayo with 1 cup sour cream.  I am not going to put the bacon on until just before serving (and possibly some finely chopped jalapenos).  Will definitely be adding this to my favorite recipes.

I did not make this recipe. However, somehow just reading it inspired me to make the best potato salad of my life, despite using the same old recipe as I always have. I'm not sure if it reached back into the space-time continuum to retroactively make my recipe better, or if I used the same ingredients but slightly altered instructions (e.g. mix some chopped egg into the salad, as well as putting some sliced egg on top.) Either way, for the inspiration, I give five stars!

really good, the only change I made was exchanged some of the mayo for sour cream.  I thought it had a little too much dressing on it, i will cut it down next time, but I will definately make it again!

This was my first time making potato salad and OMG it was delicious!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I took it to my parents' house for dinner and my husband kept going back for more.  He said it was the best potato salad he'd ever eaten.  I would have to agree.  I'll be making this over and over this summer.

Great salad!  I took the advice of others and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I also added dill pickles, and used green onions instead.  Completely shows up the store potato salad!  Thanks for the recipe!

Recently, I was charged with the responsibility to cook for 50 men.  I needed a simple potato salad that had quick prep time and yet a big taste.  This one was a home run!  They kept coming back for extras.  It went well with the home made bar-b-que chicken.

I use this recipe every time I do bbq on the smoker. Its probably the best I've ever had and the best others that have eaten it at my house have had. I do a few things differently. I went on other reviewers suggestions and use 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream, shredded cheese and green onions. Only I also add 2 tbsp of spicy brown mustard 1 tbsp yellow mustard and 1-2 tsp of creamy horseradish. I suggest making this as soon as possible your family will never forget it!

This salad was very tasty.  I made it for a birthday party and got rave reviews.  I did triple the amount of potatoes, used a dozen eggs, used a jar of mayo (I like my potato salad creamy) mixed with Dijon mustard and sweet relish.  Will definitely make this again.

My family really enjoys this potato salad.  I use 1 cup mayo and 1 cup of Miracle whip.  Once I chop up the onion, I sautee it in the bacon grease.  Also, I add some finely chopped green onions.  The pound of bacon is devine!  Great recipe!

Enjoyed every bite of this.  Served it to friends and they loved it so much they asked for the recipe.  Even my kids liked this one.  The only change was to do a fraction of the onion.  Just enough for flavor but only about 1/4 of a medium onion was plenty.

I really enjoy this potato salad.  I made it to go with pulled pork and loved the addition of bacon.  Will have to try with green onions next time.

I've made this at least 3 times now and each time it's a hit!  Super simple!  The revisions I made were 1) I skipped the celery because I don't like it and 2) I did half mayo and half sour cream.  Everyone loves the bacon.

I'm not a big potato salad person but this potato salad was very good.  I used both red and yellow potatoes.  I also used low fat mayo and it tasted fine.

Everyone in my house seemed to enjoy this salad and nobody but me is big on potato salad, Personally I have had better, but this is a great recipe if you just want something basic. Thanks so much!

This is very good. A nice twist on traditional potato salad. I used half the amount of bacon called for (about 6 slices), green onions and added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. And instead of 2 cups of mayo- I used 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream and 2 tbs dijon mustard. I sprinkled garlic salt and fresh ground pepper in the mayo/sour cream dressing. Very tasty--my husband loved it!

I love this recipe. The only things I had to change is instead of an actual onion, I used onion powder (my husband is weird about actually crunching on onion) and then instead of celery I used a dash of celery salt (mostly b/c I didnt have celery on hand). Fantastic!

The bacon is what makes this recipe a success.  Still, I found it to be a bit bland.  I added dry dill to add some flavor, as well as red onion and chopped bell peppers.  It helped, but I still felt it was missing something.

Great flavor!  Not the usual sweet and/or vinegary potato salad.  My tips: mince the onions so they aren't too strong & crunchy, and add some fresh chopped parsley for color.

Fantastic! Wouldn't change a thing. Really watch the salt, esp. if your bacon is on the salty side. I did cut back the mayo to 3/4 cup and it was still VERY creamy. To speed things up I always keep cooked bacon in the freezer, so all I had to do was chop the bacon. The eggs were cooked at a gentle boil for about 12 minutes and put in very cold water for 5 minutes,then chopped(it saved about 15 minutes doing it this way). I also mixed the salad while the potatoes were very warm and it speeds up the flavors blending. I chilled the salad one hour before serving.

This was great and will replace my traditional family potato salad recipe. I will definitely make again but will take other reviewers advice of adding cheddar cheese to make it taste more like a baked potato salad.

Only change - scallions (green onions) instead of onion & prepared nite before to get flavours well mixed. Brought it to a poker party - several compliments on a fantastic potato salad including from a self-professed Gourmet who said it was the best he'd ever eaten - and he meant it.

This recipe is quickly becoming a legend in my house! I've made this recipe for a family fish fry, multiple church potlucks, and school lunches. I had little ladies come up to me, who I'd never met before, asking for my secret. One lady said, 'this is the best potato salad I've ever had, and I know potato salad.'  I only have a couple of tips for this recipe. First off, when you fix your eggs let them boil for about five minutes before turning off the stove and letting them stand. Secondly, for extra bacon flavor I put a teaspoon of the bacon grease in with my potato mix. This recipe already has a rich bacon flavor, but bacon lovers might be interested in giving this recipe an extra punch.

LOVED this recipe! Even thought I had overcooked the potatoes, but it turned out fantastically! We think one of the keys was to use a good brand of mayonnaise (Pams Classic Mayonnaise American Style for New Zealanders). Worth the effort!

Potato salad is my favorite side dish of all time! I have never been able to make a potato salad to my liking at home though! This was sooo delicious! I loved it! I followed the recipe EXACTLY, using red onions. It was so creamy and rich, magnificent! It's a keeper!

Very good recipe. The only thing I would criticize about it is that the potatoes would be better baked. Other than that it is a classic recipe.

Like many have said this is a great recipe!  Made it for the first time last night and I would make the following changes for the next time...like others have suggested use green onions(scallions) instead of regular onion-although they tasted fine, start with half the mayo and then add as needed-i love some mayo but 2 cups was too much if you're serving it that day, and I would make it a day ahead of when I'm going to serve it-although it tasted fine yesterday it tastes even better after a night in the fridge!

Fantastic.  I used half sour cream half mayo, green onions, and about a 1/4 cup of red bell pepper for color.  sprinkled paprika, bacon, and green onion on top for presentation.

I've made this potato salad twice now to take to BBQs and both times I came home with a completely empty bowl! I didn't change a thing...but did use a Vidalia sweet onion. Other than that, I went right by the recipe. It was absolutely wonderful and I'll be making this for many more BBQs and other functions. Thank you so much!

First off, I'd like to ask why are eggs even included in this recipe? 6 eggs?? 1 lb bacon? This recipe was very plain. It tasted just like mayo & sour cream mixed together with some egg that didn't even need to be there. I suggest to cut the recipe in half. Do not use eggs. Find some kind of seasoning because just pepper & salt alone don't work (unless you use tons). I think adding in some dill would be a good choice.

I am sure glad I did not modify this. It is very tasty!!! At first look at the ingredients list left me wondering why it was getting such great reviews. The temptation to add pickles and mustard and a number of other things were hard to overcome because it looked so...bland? NOT so my fine gourmet friends. This is definetly not your grocery store potato salad. I used a light mayo and a high quality peppered bacon and yes a whole onion. Seems a bit much but use a sweet one and this will knock your dirty socks clean off the wall.

The bacon adds a great twist on plain old potato salad.  I also added a couple dollops of sour cream.  Excellent!

We replaced half of the mayo with fat free sour cream. Also, make sure to buy all of your potatoes the same size! We took this to a potluck and received many compliments. It was delicious, and I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe.  I have a special family recipe potato salad that I always make but I was looking to make one with the red potatoes and I hit the jackpot with this one.  I did alter a few things as many other did as well.  After cubing up the potatoes I poured just a little of Newman's Organic Italian Dressing over them and let it set in while I prepared the rest of the ingredients.  I also switched the onions for green onions and I added an extra stalk of celery and I halved the amount of eggs.  I did one cup of mayo and 3/4 cup of sour cream.  I only had real bacon bits so that's what i went with and then I finally mixed in a little garlic salt and it was perfect!  My husband is going to love it.  Perfect for our beach camping trip this weekend.  Thanks!

First time I made it to the exact specifications.  Second time I used an 'everything but the kitchen sink' approach and also added 1/4 cup relish, fresh chives from the garden, dill, rosemary, 2 tbsp mustard.  Both times were delicious!

This is a wonderful potato salad and is perfect with the red potatoes. I make it as written and I get lots of requests for this recipe. It is also good warmed in the microwave, much like German potato salad.  It really brings out the flavors...quite addictive! :) Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I LOVED THIS potato salad.  Bacon in my potato salad is a must so this was perfect.  My husband wondered where the tang was since I always used vinegar in prior recipes.  I might put a tad in this recipe next time I make it (which will be today) but other than that I thought this was just an awesome recipe.

this is by far the best potato salad recipe I have ever made!! I followed the recipe exactly with no modifications (which is what I usually do first) and it was delish! The bacon is the key in my opinion, it gives it such a nice flavor, and it got better the next day. I highly recommend...

This was good but a little bland for us.  Next time I will use 1 1/2 cups of mayo plus 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Will add some green onions, garlic powder and garlic pepper for more flavor.

Would give this 10 stars if I could.  A very yummy potato salad and a huge hit with everyone, it was the first dish gone and everyone was asking for more.  Will be making this again - might reduce the mayo slightly next time.  I thought it was just a tad too much.

This is the best potato salad ever.  The bacon does it. I made it for my in-laws visiting for New Years and they loved it.  I am making it for Super Bowl dinner to go with wings.  I left out the celery and used a small amount of celery seed - only because I don't like celery.  I also used 1/2 - 3/4 cup chopped green onions instead of a regular onion.  I suggest making it further ahead so that the flavors have time to blend together.

I really have never like mayonaise potato salad - I think because it is usually bland.  I wanted to make some for the first time and boy was it a hit.  My brother in law, who is very picky got seconds, and my brother could not stop raving about it.  I halved the recipe for six adult and everyone had enough for seconds.  The next night we entertained again and I made the full recipe because we WANTED to have leftovers!

Great recipe! I did it as is and it was great, but I did end up adding some celery seed and yellow mustard for my own personal taste and I think it was a necessary improvement.  My family LOVED it!  It was gone that night!

We really enjoyed this potato salad.  I have been searching for a recipe for a long time and this is our favorite.  I recently made it for a family gathering of 35 people and have had many requests for the recipe.  I did make a few changes following the advice of other reviewers:  added red wine vinegar to the potatos while cooling, used green onions, added a little pickle relish, used half sour cream half mayo, added lavender pepper, and garlic salt.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!! I only used 1 & 1/2 cups of Miracle Whip, I used green onion instead of regular onion and I also added a handful of fresh dill which my family loved :) Tip: 2lbs of potatoes is about 6-8 medium sized potatoes.

Skipped the bacon, used 1c mayo, 1c sour cream, and generous amount of dill weed. Turned out very good although I prefer mustard or southern potato salad.

This potato salad came out great. I made it for a work BBQ and I only had a little leftovers.  My husband, who ate the leftovers said it was great.  I did change some things.  I doubled the recipe. I omitted the bacon, used green onions instead of regular onion, added paprika, only used half the mayo and used yellow mustard to taste.  The only thing I would change is I would cook the potatoes a little bit longer. The smaller potatoes were perfect but the larger ones were still a little hard in the middle.  Next time I will cut them in half before boiling and cook maybe a few minutes longer.  Also, make sure you wait till the potatoes are cold before you cube them, it works much better that way.

Very flavorfull, the bacon makes this dish excellent.  I will keep this recipe as my main potato salad.  The bacon stayed crisp for quite a long time, but make sure its extra crispy when you cook it (not burnt) I used thick sliced bacon.  My only change was scallions in place of onions.

This was my first attempt at making potato salad and it was wonderful, it tasted like I remember potato salad before all the stuff that gets added in. Did not have any bacon, and was short 1/2 c salad dressing, so added real mayo.It is now something I will make again. Thank you.

Best potato salad I've ever made or ever eaten.  Made a triple batch for our Memorial Day cook out and to my dismay, had no leftovers for me to enjoy later.  A definite keeper....thanks for sharing.

This potato salad is excellent as-is and with any of the modifications suggested in the reviews.  One interesting twist that went over well at several large gatherings is substituting 1/2 C ranch dressing for some of the mayo.  I also like to add a lot of spice - cayenne pepper and paprika to taste add a nice kick

OMG this was sooo good!  It tasted like a baked potatoe with all the works.  I didn't have celery so I substituted it with celery seed and used half sour cream half mayo.  It was perfect.

A very good salad however I found it a little heavy on the bacon. Would cut back by 1/4 next time. Also did not use 2 full cups of mayo-more like 1 1/2-2/3. Went over very well at a church picnic.

Very yummy! A salty, not sweet potato salad which my whole family enjoyed.  I dont eat potato salad as a lot of people before have mentioned, but this gives a different take on the recipe.

Very good if you add dill I would add more bacon! :)

This was the best potato salad I've ever had.  I made it for a party, and everyone raved about it.  The only change that I made was that I used green onions instead of a regular onion.  It turned out wonderful!  This will be my standard.

I can only give this recipe 4 stars because I edited too much of it.  It was a fantastic base, but it needed some tweaking.  I added 3 celery stalks instead of 1; I used 2 shallots instead of the onion; I used 1-1/2 cups of the mayo instead of 2; I also added red pepper, fresh dill, and fresh chives.  Now it is a 5-star potato salad!!!!

This was fantastic! I added a hint of minced garlic, a bit of mustard, and dill weed. I also used green onion instead of the regular onion. Everyone loved this, even my kids, and I ended up making it again a few days later for our annual Father's Day BBQ at my aunts! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I only rated this recipe two star because the flavor was very bland.  I took other reviews suggestions of adding mustard (1 heaping tbsp) and about equal amount of vinegar.  This definatevely made it more tasty.  I will definitevely make again, but with mustard and vinegar.  Chopped pickles might even make it more flavorful.

Really good, took it to a BBQ and everyone loved it - only used about half the mayo called for and it was still delicious and much lighter.  Added just a touch of mustard and vinegar for a little tang, but was great without it too.

I've made this several times, with rave reviews always.  Make it just as is, although I do cube the potatoes before I cook them, as it makes them cook a little faster.  Plan on making again  this weekend for a winter picnic!

I use this recipe as a base for my potatoe salad.  I have made it several times and it has always been gobbled all up.  I use half sour cream and half mayo, a few squeezes of mustard, a couple teaspoons of vinegar, I just use the Real Bacon Bits (saves some time).  It's been a big hit.  Thanks a lot.

Great basic recipe. I only used half the bacon and 1 1/2 cup of mayo. I also added 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar to give it a little kick. Perfect!

YUMMMY!!! I only used 1/2 pound a bacon and it was bacon-y enough for me. This was the first potato salad I ever made and got compliments from my extended family (who of course didn't know it was my first)! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a bbq I had and everyone loved it! They kept saying how good it was. I recomended it to my mom and she got the same reviews. We love how you don't have to peel tons of potatoes either. Yumm.

Update: I have started cutting up the potatoes before I boil them so I don't have to wait for them to cool. I also use the Hormel bacon from Costco (already cooked and chopped). Both of these steps make it go much faster. Also, I use a shallot instead of the onion because I hate raw onion. I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. This is so yummy!

Wow...this recipe for potato salad was wonderful.  This was my first time making potato salad and it turned out perfect.  I doubled the recipe, but I didn't double the bacon...I still only used 1 lb. and it was just enough.  I also didn't want a lot of onion, so I only used 1/2 of a large onion.  I made this for July 4th and it went quick.  Thanks for a great recipe :-)

I needed a potato salad for a bbq and this fit the bill! I also cubed the potatos before cooking and did not use 2 whole cups of mayo- maybe one and half. Yum!

7/04: Made this for a large backyard party (75 people). It was the first dish gone, and I tripled the recipe and had one other potato dish there.  Have been asked to bring it to several parties since.  8/06 additional comments:  I quadrupeled this recipe for our annual party this year and ran out again!  I was invited to a picnic tomorrow by one of the guests and they asked me to bring this salad.  You just can't lose with it.

I get nothing but raving compliments over this salad!  Do not add or omit anything or try to adjust amounts-it is perfect as is!  Make sure to FINELY chop onion and celery as stated. You cant go wrong with this one!

I'm new to making potato salad and this recipe made me known for my salad on the first try.  I used half the bacon called for and used just a little over half the mayo called for as well. Mmmm, it was GOOD! A word of caution to new potato salad makers: if you double this recipe you will end up with one seriously HUGE bowl of potato salad.  That' not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, considering how good this is.  ;)

Great potato salad.  So simple, yet very tasty.  My husband said it ranked as high as his Mother's potato salad, which is out-of-this-world!!

This recipe was delicious. I made a half recipe for our labor day party, and it went so fast that I should have made more. I added garlic powder and mustard powder, which I thought it needed.

This has got to be the best potato salad recipe out there, even my kids loved it and they are extremely picky. I did alter it like others using sour cream and have to say that this will now be a regular on our table. Thank you for the recipe.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times in the last two months for barbeques and parties....by request.  My boyfriend, who doesn't really like potato salad, swears he can eat the whole bowl in one setting.  I cut the bacon and onion required in half and added a dash of celery salt as well.

I took another reviewer's advice and used 1 C sour cream and 1 C light mayonnaise in lieu of 2 C mayo.  This was delicious!  Although it was really tasty after an hour or so in the fridge, as with all potato salads, it was even better the next day!

I get asked for this recipe ALL THE TIME. I changed mine up a little bit - I took out the celery, use half sour cream and half mayo, use green onion instead and sprinkle a little garlic salt. Sometimes I spice it up and add chopped jalepeno - great!

Oh my gosh.. I used half the bacon and found it was more than enough!.. It was excellent, nice and creamy, yet a little crunchy with the onion and celery. I usually like to add spices and herbs, but this did not need it. I will make it again and again!...

Wonderful potato salad recipe!  I made it yesterday for a party and everyone loved it.  My fiance, who doesn't even really care for potato salad, said this one is a keeper.  I found that the red potatoes I used needed to cook longer than 15 min., maybe because they were the larger red potatoes and not the small ones.  Also, I used a little less than 1 and 1/2 cups mayo, and a scant 1/2 cup sour cream and it was wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe, it will be part of my permanent recipe folder!

Very good recipe. Such a nice twist on an old standard at our family picnics. The bacon is the key, and also chopping the onion and celery very finely. Thanks for sharing!

I used plain peeled potatoes, red onion for green (didn't have any), and 1/2 light may and 1/2 light sour cream.  It was very tasty.  Even my mother liked it -- and she is pretty picky!

I only used 4 eggs and half a pound of bacon, but this was a winner at a recent BBQ for 20 people!
I'd DEFINATELY make this one again.
Oh, and I used green onion instead of onion.. the guests were not onion friendly!
YUMMY

Pretty good. I think I added way too much onion though. I used a half of a large white onion, and half of a small red onion to add some color. Also, this one may be a bit too creamy for me. Next time I'll use Miracle Whip instead of real Mayo, and probably cut back to 1 1/2 cups or so. But, overall this is a nice change of pace to the standard potato salad.

I personally do not know how to make very many salads, like macaroni or potato.  I was asked to make potato salad for a Thankgiving get together, and I panicked.  I look for recipes on-line and found this one.  I tried it and boy was it great!!!  Thank you for saving me!!!

Although I didn't make this myself, my friend did. She used half Miracle Whip and half mayo and it was perfect.  She only used 1/2 pound bacon and we both agreed it needed more.  This is now my only potato salad recipe!

This was very yummy!  I used only two large eggs, 1/2 c low fat mayo and 1/2 c fat-fortified (for the hubby).  Also real bacon bits vs. bacon for convenience.  It is very good - can't wait to serve at my cookout.

This was really good.  I made it for my daughter's birthday party and the adults especially loved it.  I used red onion and seasoned salt.  I am generally not a potato salad eater, but I really enjoyed this.  I will definitely make this again.

I love this potato salad. I've made it enough now that I can just wing it. I do generally use the Costco bacon bits to make it even easier. I have substituted the yellow potatoes when that's all I've had and they are good too.

This is a great recipe.  This was my first time to make potato salad and it was a hit!  My husband said he could eat these everyday.  My oldest son doesn’t really care for potato salad but he loved this recipe.  Thank you for posting such a great recipe

Every time I make this dish everyone loves it. It's always what my family asked me to bring to a BBQ. I cook the bacon in the oven it is easier and browns evenly.

Boil the potatoes longer than 15 minutes. Most of mine were still too raw. Cut them in half vs boiling them whole if you want them done in 15 minutes.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly for a pot luck at my husband's work, and it was almost gone by the end of it. It is super time consuming, and does have lots of steps so I won't be making it all the time, but it had great flavor! The only thing I changed is that we are living overseas and I couldn't find bacon, so I used smoked Pancetta instead that was already chopped and cooked it like I would bacon and it was fine. I also used Light Hellman's to help with the calories/fat content.

Be careful with the onion. I used a large onion and it was way to much. It was overbearing and almost inedible. If you are using a large onion used 1/4-1/2.

This was the first potato salad I have ever made. It was very good but I would cook the potatoes 20 minutes vs. 15. My boyfriend really liked the bacon in it.

Huge hit at my 4th of July table. Did as others suggested and used more potatoes, subbed green onions for half of the red onions, and added mustard and relish. Even better the next day!

This is a great recipe!  Never have any left cause people can't get enough. I've made it many times and have slightly changed the recipe. I add red onions and green onions adds more color and is less potent than yellow. I also cut back on the mayo and use a little sour cream too. I also use yellow mustard and stone ground mustard for a bit more flavor and finish with a bit of paprika.

For best results: Use 4-5 lbs potatoes. That's a better ratio to the balance of the ingredients. Cook that bacon in microwave (yes, the microwave!) until HARD. So hard it's nearly inedible. If only cooked til crisp-tender, the texture when chilled gets chewy, weird, gross, & rubbery! Otherwise follow the remaining instructions for a nearly perfect potato salad!

This recipe is crack and should be illegal! I think I just ate a pound of it. Made it last night to go with Memphis Style Dry Rub ribs and it was delicious then. But today - OMG! It is even better. 

I used red onions because they were all I had. This will be the new standard in our house.

This is a wonderful potato salad "as is" or as a base for your own version.  Love it the way it is but in the summer when I have my own herb garden I snip a bit of this and that and add it to the salad...SO delicious!  Thank you for this great recipe!

This was very good.   My first time making potato salad, and it was a hit at a graduation party.  I did split the mayo and added 1/2 sour cream.  Will make again for sure!

Wow, excellent potato salad.  I bought a 3# bag of little red potatoes and just cooked all of them.  I used a 12 oz package of bacon.  I also used green onions and this was absolutely delicious.  Will be making this again.

I made this for my daughters 3rd birthday party and it was a huge success! Everyone kept asking, "who made the potato salad?" I gladly raised my hand ?? I used green onions instead of a regular onion and I added a smidge of spicey mustard. Everyone LOVED it & my mom asked me to make it again next weekend for our camping trip!

When I made this and we ate it, it was very tasty. However, after sitting in the refrigerator the bacon got limp & gave off a texture of uncooked bacon. Probably won't make again. So sorry

This is so good. I did add some extras, I put in 1/4 of a green bell pepper and 1/4 of a sweet red pepper, I used two ribs of celery, I put two dill pickles in it, I used Hellmanns mayo with olive oil and I also added a little mustard and wow so good.

I just wanted to mention that a stalk of celery is the entire bunch.  I think what is meant here is a "rib" of celery.

My first Memorial Day Party and Huge bash at our house turned out to be a great success.  I got rave reviews from everyone who had this potato salad.  I have made it at least 2 other times since Memorial Day and once was for my boyfriend who brings a dish to work every Wednesday.  Someone who hates potato salad decided to try it because it had bacon in it.  Well, I received an email while lunch was going on and was told he loved it.  Best recipe ever.  I will make this for every summer gathering.  Huge hit with everyone.  Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend LOVED this. I only used 1/2 pound bacon, but next time will use the whole pound. I will keep the extra half pound reserved and sprinkle on each serving. I also used 1/2 lite mayo, half sour cream and only 3 eggs. Also used green onions. So I did change a lot as suggested by reviewers.

1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream double potatoes added splash of dill weed.  New Red Potatoes come in a variety of sizes, I cooked mine longer pulling the smaller ones out after 20+ min and I had very hard potatoes.

This was good.  Halved recipe, used 3 slices of bacon, white & green onions.  We felt it needed a little more seasoning, so we added a little granulated garlic, some paprika, and a squirt of horseradish mustard.  Husband loved the addition of bacon.  Thanks so much for recipe!

Best potato salad ever!! I'm not usually a potato salad fan, but needed a salad to serve at a lunch for a large group. Got rave reviews from company. Made almost as written, except for using half mayo/half sour cream. Will definitely make again, but will probably omit the eggs, because I think they add more in labor and prep time than they do in flavor or texture.

This was delicious. I used green onion, and replaced half the mayo with low fat sour cream. I also added 5 ounces of crumbled blue cheese.

This is my first time trying a potato salad and it seemed easy enough!  I made a few alterations going off of other reviewers and cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces and cut the bacon before I cooked it (only used half the bacon).  I agree with another reviewer, that 2 cups of mayonnaise seemed too much...I started with 1 cup and then I added a little from there.  After mixing everything together, something still seemed to be missing, so I diced a carrot and boiled the pieces until they were 'al dante' and threw in a handful of frozen peas.  Sprinkled the bacon pieces on top, with paprika to finish it off...Voila!  A somewhat 'authentic' potato salad!

We certainly enjoyed it! Like others, I cubed the potatoes prior to cooking. I used regular new potatoes. As suggested by others,  I used 1 cup of mayonnaise and 1 cup of sour cream, and green onions instead of yellow. I also added in a second stalk of celery and a dollop of Dijon mustard. I also only had half a pound of bacon, and found that it was just the right amount. Nice combination of flavours! Thank you for posting.

I love the reviews that say I didn't change much then basically totally changed the recipe with additions like dill and other big flavor changers.....LOL!!!  I'm just as guilty.  I thinned the Hellman's (we don't allow Miracle Whip in this kitchen...) with a little sushi rice vinegar, used red onions AND scallions (scallions were the top garnish) minced the bacon raw and cooked it nice and crispy straining off the rendered bacon fat with a fine seive.  Lots of pepper mill ground pepper and sea salt......mui delicioso!!!  It didn't last long .......thank you for it!!!

I made this for a huge family reunion, and it was devoured! I've never made potato salad before, and this was a great one! I made a few slight changes...I cut down on the eggs and mayo, and used green onions. I made it again the same way for different group of people, and the bowl was empty this time as well. Such a simple, easy recipe. Thank you!

I was concerned about the ratio as well.  I used 3 lbs of potatoes, about 3 green onions and 2 celery stalks.  The rest was pretty much right on.  This salad is not only very tasty, it is gorgeous to look at!  Love it.

My husband loved this potato salad.  I made a few changes according to Debbie2's suggestions: used a combination of 1/2 miracle whip and mayo & 1/2 sour cream.  Used green onions and added some shredded sharp cheese.  These changes makes it sort of a loaded baked potato salad.  Very good!

I was looking for a new potato salad to add to my repertoire and notice that this recipe seemed well received. And for good reason! This recipe is my new favorite... and following the instructions to the 'T' even if you increase the serving size to 20, it still comes out PHENOMENAL!! All I ask is you try it once and then you'll see what I am talking about. Amazing!

This salad is awesome! My hubby HATES potato salad but I decided to make it anyway since we had company coming and I wanted a new recipe. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I took the advise of other reviewers and used green onions instead of white and I added about a tbls of Dijon mustard. Other then that I made it as the recipe called for. I even made it a few days in a row because we loved it so much and there was none left after the company was over.

Our family is a bunch of potatoe salad eating machines. We eat it with gumbo, bbq, and just about everything on a weekly basis. Just for kicks I tried this recipe last night. I followed everything except took a reviews suggestion and substituted a red onion. 
Now, I have been using All recipes for 10 years, & this is my 1st review.  I had to let Y'all know that myself and my Southern Louisiana family have never tasted a better tater salad in our lives. Thank you! This will be on our table from this day forward!

Love this recipe. Red potatoes avoid the worst part of making potato salad, which is peeling the skins. How can you go wrong with bacon. I use 1 cup Miracle Whip, 1 cup Mayo, sprinkle a little paprika on top other wise I make it per the recipe.

Outstanding. I followed the recommendation of sub the onion for green onions. Instead of 2 cups may...use 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. Added in some sharp cheddar cheese and it was PERFECT. Will be making again for sure!

My family loved this recipe, the only problem was not having more. This was the only dish I didn't have leftovers from.  I did use green onion as some other posters suggested, yummy, yummy, yummy.

This is outstanding, and I'm extremely picky about my potato salad!  I made a triple recipe for a backyard party and had leftovers of everything but this.

I used 4 lbs potatoes, 4 celery stalks, 7 eggs, 3 cups of mayo, and I also added dill.  It was a hit :D

Best potato salad recipe I've found.  Using double smoked bacon is the only change we make.
(update)  This still is a go-to recipe for potlucks or summer salads.  Never get tired of this recipe

I never made potato salad and this is the first one I tried because it had such great reviews.  It truly was a wonderful potato salad.  I followed the tips from one review saying she sauté the celery and onion.  I don't like crunchy in my potato salad so it worked out great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe

I brought this to a dinner and everyone loved it. I followed an earlier review and made 5lbs of potatoes. I also used turkey bacon instead of regular. Everything else was kept the same. This will definitely be made again!!!

This is the BEST potato salad I have ever had or made.  The only change I made was I used 2 stalks of celery.  I did cook the celery & onion in about 3 TBL of the bacon grease for about 3 minutes to soften.  I only used about 5 eggs instead of 6. Thank you!!

Very yummy I have had no complaints on this salad! My only changes were that I chopped my potatoes before I cooked them, I used green onion instead of regular onion, I added some dry mustard and dry dill weed! This is my new potato salad everytime:) enjoy

I loved this recipe and so did my sister. I gradually added the mayonnaise and ended up using 1 1/2 cups. I have a healthier version but this one of those occasional splurge recipes.

I made this a few days ago but didn't put celery in it and I used russet potatoes since I didn't have any red on hand. OMG this salad tastes AMAZING! I didn't have to add much salt since the bacon makes it salty enough. I make a mean potato salad but have to say that this one might be even a wee bit better!

I just made this potato salad recipe for a BBQ party and everyone loved it, but to me the bacon was "chewy" (even though it was crisp when I crumbled it and added it that same day). Also 2 lbs. of potatoes was not enough, I used 4 lbs. and where I live in SoCal bacon doesn't come in 1 lb. packs, it comes in 12 ounce packs(3/4 lb.)so that's what I used instead. When recipes call for "1 onion" they should say instead 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup (or whatever) because onions can differ in size by quite a bit.  Anyway cooking is all about making it your own and tasting as you go, so I did, and it was good.

Someone has stolen my recipe!  HAHA  I hope my son does not find out.  He always requests his Mom's special potato salad when we have a get-together.  I use more potatoes but don't know the exact amount.  I just fill up the pot.  I am sure everyone will enjoy this recipe.  I sometimes add celery seed but my son-in-law doesn't like them.  My son says he has been my son longer than he has been my son-in-law.

I make this receipe all summer. Everyone loves it.  I make a couple changes though..instead of regular onion I use green onions and add a small squirt of yellow mustard to the mayo.  I do not use the celery, but may try it. As for 2 cups of mayo? I've always eye balled it. But I only use Hellman's.  The bacon is a must! Make sure it's crisy too.

Loved this recipe. I used a preservative-free peppered applewood smoked bacon, added extra celery (I like more crunch), omitted the salt and pepper (the bacon had a lot of pepper and I prefer not to add salt to food until I eat it), and added some McNess Potato Salad Seasoning. It was a hit at our BBQ. I definitely would recommend adding more seasonings than just S&P, such as mustard powder, thyme, dill, garlic powder, etc.

I didn't use the full amount of mayonnaise called for, I used about a cup and a half. Likewise, I only used a half pound of bacon. I substituted green onlon for the normal onion and also used a little red onion. I also added paprika, and about a half of a green pepper

This was my first time attempting potato salad and I was surprised on how delicious this was. I added onion and garlic powder along with cumin. The cumin brings the flavor together!

MOST EXCELLENT!!!  I was feeding about 14 people so I used 4.5 lbs of potatoes, one pound of bacon, 9 eggs, green onions and enough mayo to make it moist.  Everyone loved this!!!  I made it the night before and next time I'll mix the onions in right before serving so it has a more gentle onion flavour.  I mixed the bacon in just before serving too.

Perfect As Is!! If you have the means try smoking the hard boiled eggs for 10-15 minutes, and adding a little horseradish sauce, but those are only personal preference.

With over 1500 reviews, you know it's good. But heck, why not add one more great review. It is GREAT. I love bacon. 1 pound was perfect, but I think I really used 3 pounds of potatoes - and they were on the big side, not so new. I did fiddle with this a bit - no eggs in mine, added scallions and used red onion. Also added a splash of vinegar to the mayo before adding. It's now my go-to summer picnic, potluck sharing dish and EVERY SINGLE TIME people ask for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe just like it said (except a bit more bacon since you can't go wrong with bacon).  This is the best tasting potato salad I've ever had!

This is the best potato salad we have ever had and the first potato salad I made. I do add more celery (our preference) and I add some of the bacon grease (the amount varies per taste). Since I add the bacon grease I do not add the salt. It would have to be a hard sell to convince me to make a different potato salad. Again, BEST EVER!!

We loved this.  Used 1 cup mayo and approx. 1 cup sour cream.  Did not use 1 lb of bacon--maybe 2/3 or 3/4 lb and sprinkled some on top for decoration along with some chopped parsley.  Also added some chopped parsley to the body of the salad and only used 2 eggs as that was all I had.  Added 2 full stalks of celery since I didn't have as much egg.  Super YUM!!  don't always make Potato salad so this turned out GREAT and everyone enjoyed it.  The bacon really adds something.

First I must say we all have our preferences in potato salad dressing- and this is a great recipe and can be adapted easily to your taste!! I did the 1/2 mayo/1/2 sour cream mixture with some chives (I very lightly dressed it) . I also followed the recommendation of cubing the potatoes before cooking and cooling them on a cookie tray- sprinkling with red wine vinegar and seasoning with fresh herbs.  WOW!! Those were fabulous suggestions- This was the HIT of the party!!   ENJOY!

Just served this red skinned potato salad for a family get together.  Used green onions as suggested by previous user.  Everyone agreed it was a keeper; absolutely delicious.

I do not know how another recipe I reviewed ended up with this one but...This is a great potato salad recipe.  Forget what I said about a cake being an Epic Failure it was but that has nothing to do with this recipe!
This is going to be a requested recipe for most gatherings. 
Now I have to go find the cake recipe and find out what review ended up there ;)

I LOVE the addition of bacon because, quite frankly, bacon makes everything better.  I took other suggestions and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, which I liked.  I then added a little yellow mustard and pickle juice, which I didn't care for.  Even though that is typically how I make my potato salad, it seemed too tangy in this recipe.  I am hoping that, after it sets overnight for my July 4th bbq, the flavors will blend more.

Very good. One has to add or subtract what their preference is for onion and celery amounts are for this or ANY salad for that matter. As far as I am concerned, salad is just a mixture of whatever you like mixed into one dish (basically), and if you like it a certain way, then that is how you'll lean towards. I liked this recipe, it was not complicated. It was a handful of ingredients that we usually have anyway and it was something I could do w/ my kids.  I used more celery, added about 1/4 pound of potatoes, and 1/2 cup LESS mayo. Just my preference. I think it'd be good no matter what, it has BACON in it! :)

I've made this recipe for a couple of years now, whether for dinners at home or extended family get-togethers and it always disappears FAST!!  Everyone loves it.  I've tried it both with and without the celery as some of the relatives don't care for it, but it's definitely better with...

Have made this a dozen times now and it seems to keep getting better.  Procedurally, I mix all the ingredients in a bowl together and let sit in the fridge while the potatoes are boiling.  I prefer chopped green onions and my extra addition is chopped fresh dill (about 4-5 tbsp).  I pkg of Hormel chopped bacon bits works great!  It's amazing! I then add my potatoes as the final step and mix together.  Delicious!

I thought it was awesome.  An instant classic.  I did use three corn cracked pepper, green and red onions mixed, removed half the yolks and added diced dill pickle and radish to the mix as well as yellow mustard, trimmed the fat off the bacon, and used 1/2 mayo or plain yoghurt and 1/2 ranch...I mean, come on!  Nobody says no to ranch, right?  The whole family loved it.  To mix it up, I usually add crumbled feta with oregano or grated parmesan with basil to give it a Mediterranean flair

Fabulous!! First time making my own potato salad, and this recipe is absolutely delicious!! I did part miracle whip, and part sour cream for the dressing, as well as a bit of dill mustard! It was really good, I'll definitely be making this all summer :)

It is a fine basic recipe to start with for potato salad, but definitely lacks depth, flavor, and appeal. The only way to make this flavorful is to spice it up and make changes/additions (according to most of the reviewers...and is my opinion as well).

Four stars as is. I tried it again with some relish and a small amount of spicy ground mustard and it took it to a whole new level. I also cut back on the onion and celery the second time around. It's all about suiting a recipe to you and your family. I always recommend making the recipe as directed and then adjusting it from there. Regardless, this is a keeper.

I have been Searching for the Ultimate Potato Salad...This is it ! with a couple modifications for personal preference......  Cut the Bacon in half, added 12 diced Black Olives, and did add only 2 chopped Eggs ....  Mayo was half cup Kraft Cracked Pepper Mayo and half cup Reg Mayo blended with 1 cup of Miracle Whip (personal preference) Positively the best.

This was pretty good. Next time I'll leave out the bacon. It was way better before I put the bacon in. Or, as a friend said, the bacon was way better before the potato salad. It got really soggy and chewy and it was really unappetizing. And I make sure my bacon was nice and crispy before I added it, too. I'll definitely make again, though. It was a hit with the party guests.

We really liked this, but you have to like eggs in your potato salad.  I liked it because it was easier to make than regular potato salad.

Simply the best, 3 times for different family dinners. 

my secret? I use 1cup helluva good dip (jalapeno cheddar or garlic) and 1 cup mayo.

 I also chill potatoes for an hour before mixing it all up so that the potatoes are firmer.

I made this for a friend's birthday getaway weekend we were having and the only request he had for a gift was homemade potato salad. I had never made potato salad before and everyone loved this recipe! I did add some mustard to the recipe. I will definitely be making this more often and no longer will be buying potato salad. Thanks for the great recipe!

I typically don't like potato salad, but this is definately a keeper.  My husband has requested this dish several times.  Wow.  He has never liked creamy salads.

My husband, who doesn't generally like potato salad LOVED this...  My children, who are incredibly picky eaters asked for seconds.  With the eggs, bacon, and mayonnaise, I realize this isn't the healthiest of "salads"... but it will be my GO TO recipe for Memorial Day and 4th of July picnics!  Twice a year won't block anyone's arteries!!!  :)

Used 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 sour cream. Added garlic to the dressing. Roasted the potatoes in the oven in the bacon grease. Tasted sooo yuummy. Like a summer baked potatoe.

OMG, this was delicious.  Only change I made was I used celery seed about 2 TBS, I forgot to write celery down, so I didn't feel like running back to the store for that.  It was a hit amongst everyone.  Will be making this one again!

I have never made potato salad before. Ever. I chose this for my first try and will never use another!  My husband was skeptical of the bacon until he took the first bite.  The bacon MAKES this dish, so flavorful and adds nice texture.  The only thing I did different was to use green onions instead of regular.  And to make sure it blended evenly I mixed my mayo, onions, celery, s&p in a separate bowl before adding to my potato/ egg mix.  Bacon on top and stirred in.  I cook my bacon very crisp and had no problems with it getting soggy, even after a couple days.  Yummy!!

This was great!!! I did make this with a few changes as other users have suggested. I used about a half an onion and then green onion. And I used a cup of Mayo and a cup of Sour Cream. Also, if you have a food processor I would advise to use it! I used it to get the celery and onions really fine and to crumble the bacon. It was a huge hit at my fourth of july party, even the kids loved it!

oh my......delissssh! I made it with 1 lb bag of small reds, 2 eggs, 6 pieces of bacon, 1 celery stalk (which I almost forgot), some red onion and green scallions. Mayo, salt and pepper.....fantastic!!! btw, we had peas on the side which mixed in well too so I threw the left overs in for tomorrow!!! Will be making this for a BBQ of the future! (Key though as always is to make ahead (around noon) so that it all has enough time to chill!)

this was my first time making this type of patato salad.. it was totally delish! i also used have mayo n half sour cream, DO NOT leave out the Bacon, it does give it the distinct flavor, i also used white onion but cut back on it.. to speed the making up I cubed the potato then boiled them while i baked the bacon in the oven on a baking sheet..  Thanks for a GREAT RECIPE Donna :)

This was a big hit at a holiday get-together!  I only used 3 eggs and prefer the shortcut of precooked bacon pieces, but I didn't really change anything.  We will be having this on Easter Sunday!

Yum! Thanks for the recipe! I used a little less bacon (I get sick of cooking it. Lol) I only used around 8oz Mayo (the olive oil version) and then used a creamy Balsamic Vinaigrette in addition to that. That gave it a nice zesty taste to it. I am sure it would have been delicious without the changes though!

This is my go to Potato Salad recipe!! I do cut up the potatoes before cooking them up. I also sub the real celery for celery salt and add some garlic salt too. You can not leave out the bacon!! That's the key! Also it tastes even better if you can make at least a day a head. I'm making mine today 12/23 for Christmas! It will have plenty of time to reach full flavor! OMG ... I'm drooling just thinking about it!

I made this recipe "as is" for my wife's birthday party.  Several people were impressed enough to want to take some home.
Next day, it was even better.  So my only suggestion is to make it a day ahead of time and let all the flavors mingle.
My wife HATES Miracle Hwip so I didn't add any in her serving, but I added just a touch to my servings and I gotta say...GLORIOUS!
My wife has decreed that this recipe is now a staple in parties we throw and we attend.  It's now OUR dish.  Gotta love new family traditions.

The BEST Potato Salad I've ever made!  I have made this a few times for family events and people describe it as "gorgeous".  The only thing I changed is 1/2 pound of bacon instead of the full pound and it is delicious!

I made this potato salad as a side dish for about 25 people and ended up making several photo copies of the recipe for people to take home! I followed the advice of other reviewers by: cutting the potatoes before boiling, and using scallions in lieu of onions. Although I chopped the celery ahead of time, I completely forgot to add it and the end result was still a hit! To save time, I used pre-cooked bacon and nobody noticed the difference!

I made this salad without the celery.  It was okay, I think it needs more flavor.  I do like the bacon in it.

This was my first 'real' attempt to make potato salad. It got rave reviews at my granddaughters baptism. Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe. 
    I too like some of the others substituted sour cream for some of the mayo. In addition I did peel the potatoes after cooling since we have a couple of picky budding gourmets. After peeling and cutting the potatoes I added 1/2 cup of ranch salad dressing to 'marinate' them before adding the dressing. 
    Several of the guest asked if I could adopt them so I could make this salad for them on a regular basis.....  thanks again!

Shamefully, I admit this is only the second time in my life to have made potato salad, but this experience was much better than an attempt at the age of 21.

Like many others, I substituted one cup of sour cream for the mayonnaise, too. I will definitely make this again, though next time I'll be sure to cook the potatoes just a tad longer, or cut them into smaller cubes before boiling. As for the bacon, I thought a full pound might be overwhelming, but by the time it is cut up and distributed, it is fine. Next time I will cut the bacon into smaller pieces as well. 

Not much of a raw onion fan, I used only half an onion and borrowed the fabulous idea from another Allrecipes member to place the onions and celery into a strainer, then pour the hot water from the boiled potatoes over them. This reduced the raw crunch of the onions, for which I am not a fan. 

My apologies, I don't mean to sound as though I'm picking this recipe apart. It is more a matter of preference, which can easily be changed to suit. A good basic recipe that is safe to tweak. 

Many thanks!

Love this potato salad! I only had about half the bacon the recipe called for but other than that I followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful! I may try green onions next time and see how it turns out!  YUMMY!

Pretty Good.  I used a tablespoon of mayo. 8 or 6 oz Fage 0% Plain Greek Yogurt and a nice helping of Dijon mustard (that really gave a nice flavor).  I also used about 1/4 cup white onion and 1/4 cup green onion.  I was unsure how it would taste using the greek yogurt and mustard but my bf actually liked it.. and he's pretty picky.

Excellent recipe!  I made this for 4th of July family get-together and everyone commented on how good it was.  Tasted even better the next day.  I skipped the bacon this time and added 2 dill pickles.

I have never made potato salad before but this recipe was easy to follow and turned out delicious.  I had about 6 people tell me it was the best potato salad they have ever had.  I took another reviewers advice and cooked the chopped onion in the bacon grease for a couple minutes.  it cut back on the sharp onion taste and gave everything a delicious flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

Loved it! I did only use five pieces of bacon because that sounded like a scary amount of calories but I will definitely add more bacon next time.  It gives it a really nice flavor.

This is delicious! I used green onions, which gave it a mild onion flavor as well as a punch of color.This salad was a big hit. I will definitely be making it again soon.

Wonderful Recipe! I whipped some heavy cream and substituted half of the mayo for the whipped cream, used spring onions instead of regular onions and added dill to taste! I love the boiled eggs and bacon. Wonderful recipe. Thanks!!

Hey, this is my basic potato salad recipe!...with a few additional items:you gotta chop up a sweet green pepper, and mix a tsp. of dijon mustard and 1 or more grated garlic cloves to the mayo before gently mixing in with the veggies. I also cut the bacon and egg amounts in half, but that's really dependent on your taste. One last suggestion, use Vidalia onions. Not to be vain but this is by far THE BEST potato salad I have ever eaten. The tweeks are my own but my 1st Mother in law gets the credit for the basic recipe.

This was awesome.  My family usually doesn't like onions in potato salad, but this was a hit.  I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup Miracle Whip to add extra zip.

Am giving only 4 stars, only because I deviated from the original recipe.  Used 1 c Miracle Whip and 1 c reduced fat sour cream for 3 lbs baby reds.  Added 3Tsp yellow mustard, a bit of garlic, sliced radishes and used minced onion instead of fresh, not as over powering.  In the fridge chilling, am thinking my husband will love this one!!  Flavors were awesome even before chilling.  Good variation from my usual potato salad!

This is only my 2nd time making potato salad, but this was missing something. I did make some modifications as others suggested:

1 cup mayo 1 cup miracle whip - while the zip gave it a good flavor I think it was just a little too mayonnaisie. Maybe next time I'll do 3/4 of a cup of each.

Used green onion instead of yellow.

Omitted the bacon and celery.

Added a pinch of dill, a tsp of sweet relish and about a 1/4 tsp of mustard. 

However, the mayo/miracle whip pretty much over powered everything. Not sure how everyone else will like it. It's edible, but just lacks something.

Fantastic! I looked at other reviews and substituted 4 green onions for the onion. Other recommendations to mix 1 tsp dill with the mayo and add 1 tsp celery seed to the mayo in lieu of the salt were helpful. Hellman's Light Mayo worked for us. Excellent dish - now I'll be asked to make it over and over for a picnic contribution!

WOW!!! Yummy!! I did have to make a few changes because, I didn't have just regular bacon, I used peppered bacon, a little less onion and slaw dressing instead of mayo (I don't like mayo!) But all the flavors mingled together soooo delicious!!! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!! :-)

I made this yesterday...I went over very well. I did not follow the recipe exactly, no celery, added chopped chives and I eyeballed the potatoes and eggs, mayo as well and sub'd part of it for sour cream. I also added a tablespoon of jalapeno sour cream and a touch of garlic powder. FABULOUS! A definite keeper.

I have been making this version for 30 years. The only difference is I add thinly sliced radishes to give it a little more crunch. Then I mix Plotchmans stone ground mustard, to taste, to the mayo before mixing. And then use seasoned salt and white pepper. This will take a little longer but everyone loves this at family gatherings.

My Mom's potato salad is nearly identical. Only changes are she peels the potatoes after boiling and uses Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Awesome salad!

This is the recipe I've used for years for potato salad. There are never leftovers! The only things I do differently are: Cook the potatoes with crab boil (we're in New Orleans, what don't we cook with crab boil!) and I add some dill. Everyone always loves this potato salad! I have to set some aside for my husband to have the next day.

This potato salad is delicious! I made almost as the recipe states except I did not use as many eggs and I cheated and used the bacon pieces that are already cooked! I also added a squirt of mustard to some tangy! Highly reccommend this!

This is just how I like my potato salad - on the chunky side, not too gooey creamy, not too heavy on the mayo, with a good crunch from the celery.  I made half the recipe tonight with a "lighter hand" on everything:  2 eggs instead of 3 (although I would have liked a tad more of that, so I should have done 3), not quite half a pound of bacon crumbles, used green onion rather than white, and did what other reviewers recommended using half mayo/half sour cream.  Yum-my!  This may be the winner for our annual 4th of July bbq.

5 stars with a few modifications...used 2/3 of the bascon, used green onion instead of regular onion, added some shredded cheddar cheese and would 1/2 to 2/3 the sauce changing it from just mayo to a combination of mayo, ranch, and sour cream.  No salt needed...overall delicious!

Only giving this 3 stars because I also use the milder  green onion & a squirt of mustard.  I always separate the yolks & fully mash them with mustard & add to mayo.  Then finely chop the whites.  We call this Red Devil Potato Salad in our family.  The yolk i the dressing gives it a deviled egg flavor & is our traditional family potato salad.

Yum! The addition of bacon makes a nice change from your regular potato salad. This is the one that the whole family requests at that first BBQ of the year. I wouldn't change or add a thing, it's perfect as is. Nice job Donna!

This was the best potato salad I've ever had! It was a big hit at this year's Easter dinner, and there was none left by the end of the night. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to have less mayo and less celery.

Wonderful recipe. I did substitute sour cream for half of the mayo, and green onions for the regular onion. I added some ground red pepper and a little seasoning blend. Other than that, I followed it exactly. I think this is the best potato salad that I have ever eaten. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Made this for a shower and still am getting asked for the recipe. I did as others and used yukon potatos and green onions. Did cut the fat with low fat mayo and also used tablespoon of dijon mustard. Very good recipe will make over and over.

This is  really good basic potato salad. I thought it was missing something and my grandmother (who is a wonderful cook) said to mix a little sugar and white vinegar in the mayo. I will try that next time. This recipe is a great place to start!

Out of all the recipes I've tried so far on Allrecipes.com, I must say that I was most impressed with this dish.  Although it doesn't look like it'll be that difficult to make, I found myself juggling a few steps.  It could be that I was also in charge of burgers, but you definitely have to multi-task a little bit.  The end product is sooo worth it.  VERY yummy potato salad!

I have made this recipe numerous times now and this is by far the best potato salad which I have ever tried. Eggs and bacon amounts can be adjusted to taste (I tend to lessen the eggs to 4 but have made it as written as well).

First time I made this one and it came out awesome! I changed a few things... I used green onions instead of a regular onion, threw in some Fresh parsley and did one cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream! Totally worth making!

Hands down the best potato salad ever.  Followed the recipe to a T except went easy on the onions.  I used Hellmen's for the mayo and cheated by using Hormel Bacon pieces bc I didn't have time to make the bacon.  SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!

I followed this recipe with the exception of only using 3 eggs and about 3/4 lb of bacon. Directions were great, I should've followed more closly to cooking the potatoes for only 15 minutes...mine were a little soft- which my husband preferred, but I didn't like the presentation. Also, it may help to have them cool completly before chopping, or follow others advice to pre-chop potatoes then cook. All in all this was a great recipe for my 'first' batch of potato salad (ever!) and it was a hit a my household. Will definately be making this again!

My guests said this was great, but I was a little disappointed. I did the 1/2 sour cream and I think that was a mistake. Would have been better with all mayonnaise. I wish I had followed the original recipe rather than the reviews. Also, I think I should have added more salt. I think I'll probably try it again with the original recipe.

I made this potato salad this afternoon and as of the moment haven't served it to my family however I've been doing some tasting and it's yummy. I love the bacon it really adds that little extra something. I read the reviews ahead of time and took some pointers from the other home cooks. I added mayo to taste, put some dill in the mix and a little mustard. I like. I like.

Delicious simple, classic salad for BBQ!  I substituted green onion and cut the mayonnaise to 1 cup with a squirt of yellow mustard which was still more than creamy enough - YUM will make again and again ...

This was okay, but not a knock-your-socks-off salad! I would have boiled the potatoes a tad longer, and there is definitely something else missing...mustard? Some sort of flavor, for certain. I need to tinker with it a little.

Made this using multi-colored potatoes. Flavor is good. I added more salt for myself, and my wife added dill to her serving. It was extremely easy and very tasty, and looks very versatile to meet any palate. Already added to the Recipe Box.

I honestly never liked potato salad since it always tasted like plain mayo but I made this for a bbq and loved it.  I changed it a bit according to other reviews.  I left out the bacon and celery and used 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of miracle whip and added cheddar cheese.  I would have used the bacon but some people at the bbq did not eat bacon.  Everyone liked it and I will be making it again for my sons birthday party.

Delicious!!  This was my first time ever making potato salad, and it was an absolute hit.  My husband declared it the best potato salad he'd ever had! :) The only change I made was quartering the potatoes before cooking them, and starting them in cold water instead of boiling (because that's how I was taught to cook potatoes).  Otherwise, I did just as it was written.  Yummy!

This was very good, probably the best Potato Salad I've ever made! I didn't make any changes at all, I just didn't add as much mayo as the recipe called for because it was way too much for me. Definately a keeper!! Thank you!!

Made as is, this is a very good recipe! I've also changed it a bit to make it even better! I sometimes use Yukon Golds instead of reds and I peel half of them to make it easier for my toddler to eat. If Im pressed for time I use ready cooked bacon and just cut it into bite size pieces. I use green onion (better flavor and adds color). Not a fan of celery in potato salad so we leave that out and I sometimes use half sour cream and half mayo. I also sprinkle in a little paprika and celery salt! Delicious!

Was an "OK" recipe; I have had better. I followed the recipe exect and found that it seemed dry and lacked flavor. It was still an acceptable dish, just not the best that I have had/made.

We love this potato salad! We skip the celery as we don't like it, and used half a red onion and then a bunch of green onion, chopped. I also only needed 1.5 cups mayo, and added some dried dill.

This is exactly how grandmother made potato salad, except I add 2 tablespoons of Marzetti slaw dressing. It gives it a little something and makes it a little less bland. Thanks for bringing back  memories of making potato salad with my grandmother!!

My husband and I can not eat raw onions anymore so I MADE MY salad DIFFERENT:  Used 6 med. to smallest red potatoes, NO ONIONS INSTEAD 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder, NO BACON INSTEAD cooked 4 slices of Turkey Bacon crisp and crumble it, Used 2 stalks of the Celery chopped, 3 EGGS instead of 6 chopped. Not sure how much mayonnaise as I just added slowly mixing carefully until it was to my liking.  Also, along with salt and pepper, I also added 1/4 cup of sweet relish.

with a few modifications I turned this into a twice baked potato salad.  I didn't have bacon on hand so I substituted with bacon bits.  I used sour cream and mayo, added chopped green onions I had on hand and sprinkled a shredded cheese mixture I has in the fridge.  Since I made some changes I couldn't give it 5 stars but an excellent source for inspiration and as a base for twice baked potato salad!

This is absolutely a keeper. I have now made this potato salad for every family event, potluck, BBQ, and anything else in between! The ONLY change I made was to add 1/2 C Mayo and 1/2 C miracle whip, because I like the flavor miracle whip adds. It isn't necessary though, this recipe is fabulous as is! Thank you for sharing it!!

This is the best potato salad I've ever had, everyone in my family agrees.  I can't even go to any kind of family gathering without bringing this, it's simply wonderful.  The only changes I've made is to use half Miracle Whip and half Mayo, and also add a little mustard.

This recipe was pretty perfect but I made a couple changes...I cut back on the egg and instead of bacon I used a 1/2 lb panchetta from the deli-its stays crispier in the dish and has much more flavor than bacon.

This potato salad was awesome!  Definitely make this with regular onions instead of green onions (as others have swapped ingredients in their reviews) - this only enhances the texture and flavor of the potato salad.  Surprisingly delicious with just salt and pepper for flavor enhancement!

My new most favorite potato salad recipe!!!  I only made minor changes...I cut the taters before I cooked and cooled them in water (for time) I used the Oscar Myer real bacon bits instead of frying bacon for convienence sake and I used 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream.  I also added a little more than one stalk of celery for more crunch!!!  AWESOME recipes..thanks!!! Oh yeah...I used green onions too!!

This is the first potato salad I ever made and it was sooooo good!  I used green onion instead of regular.  It looks prettier and its all I had on hand.  I also added just a little bit of mustard.  Absolutely amazing.  It was even better the next day after I let it sit overnight, the bacon adds some great flavoring!

Fine potato salad.  Added a couple of tbs. of sweet relish because I think that's how my mom makes her famous potato salad.  Only used six slices of bacon because that's all I had.  Not sure about the weight of the potatoes- I just used what I had but it was probably two pounds, maybe a little more.  I used half Yukon and half red because that's what I had and the whole point of making this was to use them up.

This is one of the best potato salads I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing.  Everyone now asks me to bring it to every event.

LOVE IT!, made it "to the letter" and was very suprised how simple and flavorful it was. I Iced my eggs after they had cooled some so I could peel them faster.  Next time I will try the green onion as others have suggested

I have made this several times and have always gotten good comments from my guests on it. I have used real bacon (which can be time consuming) and I have used bacon bits store brought. Both were fine. However, I thought that with the bacon bits the day after wasn't so hot. They get a little chewy.

Delicious.  I made this recipe first as written.  The second time I made it I substituted creole seasoning (Tony Cacherres) for the salt.  I took it to a company picnic and got rave reviews.  Several people asked for the recipe.

Very good!  I love potato salad and this is super simple easy recipe.  I didn't add 2 cups mayo.  I just added until everything was coated well.  Forgot to add the bacon and it was great just on it's own but then went back and added it b/c that was the reason I choose this recipe.  Thought the bacon was a good addition.  I ended up buying "real bacon" bacon pieces (peppercorn) to make it faster.  It was a great addition!  Not sure I will spend the time to make the bacon next time since it was so good with the bacon bits!  Thanks!!  Will make again and again!

I made this potato salad for my son's school luncheon and then sent the leftovers to work with my husband. I received phone calls and e-mails from people wanting the recipe. This is a fantastic, creamy potato salad. My only change was I added green onions instead of regular onions. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

WOW! This is by far the best potato salad I've ever had. I omitted the celery cause frankly I can't stand the stuff. I love the smoked hickory flavor the bacon adds to this salad. A lot of potato salads have a real eggy taste but this one is perfect! I might try adding chives next time as I will be definitely making this again!

I made this "as is" with no changes and it was great! I think the potatoes might have needed an extra minute to cook, the larger ones were a little under done. I will make this one again!

DELICIOUS - everyone loved it. NEXT TIME, though, I will boil the potatoes for longer. They were still a little too firm after 15 minutes.

I thought it was good but not wonderful. I used half mayo/half sour cream and thought there was too much dressing for my taste. I did like the bacon and red onion. I think I'll try again with less dressing.

I made this potato salad today and it was pretty good.  I do not care for the bacon flavor in the salad - however I will try just putting bacon bits on top of the salad the next time.  I used red onion and put about 2 tablespoons of sweet relish in.  Other than that - I would not change it.

I would have given this receipe 5 stars if I hadn't altered it so much. I used only 4 eggs and 1/2 bacon. Instead of 2 cups of mayo I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I also added a TBS of balsamic vinegar to give it more complexity. With these changes this was excellent!

I was seeking a potato salad to experiment with as I wanted to try grilled/smoked potatoes.  This one was excellent! Followed exactly except I Par boiled the reds and put on kabob skewers. Grilled them on direct heat with mesquite wood chips until easily pierced with fork. Tendious but worth the lovely, smoky flavor!

This is the best potato salad recipe I've tried so far. I did add a dollop of sour cream, and I used half garlic salt and half regular salt. I haven't tried it with cheese added yet, but I think it will make this dish even better (if possible!)

I absolutly loved this recipe!!!  I used a combonation of regular onions, red onions and green onions, just to give it a bit of color...I also made a vegetarian version of the dish for a few of my guests and I personally thought it tasted better without the bacon...in the end this was a great recipe and I will definitly make it again!

This is a very delicious and very pretty potato salad.  I'm vegetarian, so I skipped the bacon and the taste was still very good.  Like others I used green onions because I had them on hand.  However, if you want to use onion but not have the powerful taste of raw onion take over your recipe you can soak the chopped onion in cold water while the potatoes are boiling.  Like others I wanted to add mustard flavor, but I added about a teaspoon of dry mustard to the recipe instead of store bought yellow mustard.  I got this idea from an egg salad recipe on this site.  It adds the flavor and pretty yellow hue without also adding the vinegar taste found in store bought yellow mustard.  I only added a cup and a half of mayonnaise.  This one is really up to personal preference.  I'd say add a cup, if it is not enough, add another 1/2 cup, etc until it suits your creaminess index!

Excellent!  I've never been able to find a great potato salad recipe... until now.  This is perfect!  I (like others) did green onions instead of white, increased the celery a bit (love celery), and added 1/2 teaspoon dill.  Yum!

This is so so good. I did as other reviewers recommended and substituted green onion and used half sour cream, half mayo. I also used bacos to keep it vegetarian and added some Dill for flavor. It was Delicious! My husband prides himself on his original potato salad and admitted that this was even better. He even asked me to make it for him again the next day. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Delicious!  I made some changes based on personal preferences: used yukon gold potatoes (the store was out of red!), used green onions and omitted the celery.  I also added 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

Oh this is a great recipe!!! I used 'real' mayo and turkey bacon- cooked extra crisp. Only thing I would have done dif would be to cook the eggs way earlier so that I could mix them in cold with the others warm!  I will make this again and again!

This is the best potato salad ever!  Three family parties in the past month and they keep asking for more.  This is especially good a day later.  Some changes I made: used 1/2 Kraft Light Mayo and 1/2 low fat sour cream, use THICK bacon (crumbled), green onions and plenty of dill weed.  I leave out the celery as we're not big fans.  Even family members that don't like potato salad love this.

Perfect for my birthday barbecue. I used simulated bacon bits (mixed in to the mayo) and green onions. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This is fantastic!   I made exactly as stated except I used a mixture of mayonnaise and miracle whip.   Perfect!  I received tons of compliments on this and many requests for the recipe.   I wouldn't have believed it - but, it does make a difference boiling the potatoes whole and then chopping after cooling.  It's a little messier, but, the "dressing" seemed to soak more into the potatoes and the consistency was perfect.  Definitely try this one!

I made this without the bacon and it was a 4 star recipe. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, knowing that bacon usually adds a star to any recipe ;)  I added a titch of mustard and topped with chive, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Yum!

This was a big hit at a family barbecue recently! It was the first thing to go, and everyone went for seconds and even asked for the recipe. When we were putting everything together we just added ingredients to taste; we used 2 lbs of potatoes, 3 green onions, about 3/4 of a pound of thick-cut pepper bacon from the butcher, 4 eggs, 1 stalk celery, and about 1 1/2 cups of mayo. It didn't need any extra salt or pepper because of the bacon. So good!

This recipe is very good! I didn't really measure everything out just salted and peppered to our taste. Instead of cooking bacon, which is so messy, I used real bacon bits...Costco has a bag that we keep on hand for when recipes call for crumbled bacon. I just added enough for flavoring throughout.  And I added a little more celery than was called for. Our company and my kids said it was the best potato salad they have ever had.

This is fantastic. I tweaked a bit and added some dill, fresh parsley and green onion. Also, the second time around, I substituted the mayonnaise for sour cream and roasted garlic dip, making it a little bit more low fat.

I have one word for this: AWESOME! I made it a couple days ago for a picnic and received a lot of compliments. Best potato salad I've tasted so far. Oh, yes, only addition I made: I added one apple in small cubes.
Edited to add: for time and effort saving purposes I place my bacon on a baking sheet over aluminum foil in the oven @ 350 for as long as my potatoes rest and while I do everything else. If I'm in a crunch, I've even microwaved my bacon (watch for splatter though). Honestly nobody can tell the difference.

The salad was really really good but there was way too much mayo in the salad (I thought).  Unfortunately, there wasn't anything I could do after it was all mixed because it was too late to boil more potatoes.  I will make it again, just using less mayo.

This potato salad recipe was sooo yummy.  The only thing I did differently to it was to add some green onions to the recipe.  I also used three celery stalks instead of just one, but they were small, and egg was delicious added into it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I got great reviews from all. My wife says it is the best she has ever tasted and I agree with her. The only change made is with the egg yokes. Recipe did not mention them so I mashed them and add them to the mayo before adding it to the salad. Great great recipe Donna. Chef Roy.

I love this recipe and have gone back to it three times since first making it.  Tips:  Make sure to cook the bacon well so that it is crispy.  Also, don't undercook the potatoes.  I did that last time and it wasn't so great! :( This is pretty much a perfect potato salad recipe.  After eating this, everything else seems bland and boring!

This was good and I'll make it again, but it was a bit bland. Next time I'll add a bit more egg, definitely another stalk of celery, and maybe a little seasoning or vinigar.   Subs: Used turkey bacon and no one was the wiser ;)I also boiled the celery for two minutes so it wasn't so crisp.

I make this all the time and everyone loves it!!  It's the only potato salad recipe I use.  Sometimes I like to experiment though; Last time I used less mayo, added a bit of red wine vinegar and eased up on the onions.

Okay, so I know this is going to sounds strange but I added about a half cup of pine nuts and omitted the celery. Instead of adding the onion I chopped up some green onions - a lot because I like it that way and made sure the bacon was extra crispy. I see a lot of people used miracle whip - YUCK! I hate miracle whip. so I stuck with the mayonnaise but added some sour cream for a lighter, healthier texture. Instead of red skinned potatoes I used regular brown ones.

This is sooo delicious and easy to make! I used just potato, mayo, eggs, salt, and pepper, mostly because I didn't have the other ingredients. Anyhow, the recipe still came out great. I think this potato salad is best when served warm instead of cold.

I love this recipe and now make it quite often.I have to say that the best point about this one is BACON, it complements the potatoes very well, and the whole recipe comes out very creamy and delicious.

The bacon is the secret ingredient.  It really makes this dish different than other  tater salads.  I didn't put the eggs in due to time but it still came out fantastic.

I made this potato salad to go with burgers at our Halloween party last night and this was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about the potato salad and wanted the recipe.  It is very simple to make and delicious!  I didn't change one ingredient.  It will be a staple side dish for burgers and bbq in our house from now on!

I'm usually not a potato salad fan, but I do enjoy this recipe and my husband LOVES it. The only change that I make is to add some dijon mustard to the mayo. Great recipe - thanks!

Very tasty!! I added ranch, omitted the celery because my family does not like it, used red onions, added seasonings, and shredded cheese. Very good, like one review had stated, it was like a baked potato salad. YUMM! Will make again in the future.

I took this to a picnic potluck, and it received really favorable reviews.  

I varied only slightly from the recipe as written.  I cut the potatoes to cubes before boiling (and it still took around 16-17 minutes to get them tender).  I substituted green onions for the regular onion.  I omitted the eggs.   I also used 1 cup of light mayo (Duke's!) and somewhere between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup light sour cream, instead of the suggested 2 cups of mayo.  Finally, I baked the bacon in the oven at 400 degrees--a lb of bacon is a lot to cook evenly on a stovetop.  I just put some foil over cookie sheets, and so it was less cleaning up!

Thanks for providing a great recipe to add to my collection!

This potato salad recipe is one of the best that I have ever had.  The only changes that I made was that I used red onion and I used 1/4 cup of sour cream and I only used 1 3/4 cup of mayo.  Next time I might also add some chives for color.

I've made this a few times and it is always great.  I omit the eggs b/c I'm not a fan, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  I always make it the night before.

Only potato salad recipe I use. It is easy, and does not all need to be done at once. My suggestion for ALL mayo based salads, MAKE THE DAY BEFORE, it will be sooo much more yummier! Right before I served this, I put in the last egg and fresh chives. It seems to make it POP!

This potato salad is delish.  I altered a few items though- I used 1c mayo and 1c sour cream instead of all mayo, and I also added some shredded cheddar cheese.  This was sooooo good.  Just like a loaded baked potato.  Thanks for the recipe- I will be adding this to my favorites.

This was very good.  I did, however, make a few substitutions.  I did not put celery in it.  I also do not like the consistency of onions in potato salad, so I used onion powder, instead.  I also used a bag of Hormel real bacon crumbles to save time.   I will definitely make this again.

I have never really liked any potato salads I have made in the past because I think they had too much seasoning in them.  This recipe stands on its own.  However, I wanted to make enough for a large serving for a funeral and  a serving enough for several people in my family.  I achieved that by boiling 6 lbs. of potatoes.  I doubled the other ingredients and used 2/3 mayo and 1/3 miracle whip, because I ran out of mayo.  It took the largest metal bowl I had but worked great.  I like the method of boiling eggs.  they seemed easier to peel and cooked perfectly.

I made this for a family BBQ everyone liked it and it was pretty much devoured but for some reason I really didn't care for the Red Potato taste in it. Funny thing is that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Red Potatoes......  It could have been the brand that I got? I don't know but I intend on just using russet potatoes next time.  You can't go wrong with them.  OH and I used Turkey bacon instead of Pork. (Hubby doesn't eat pork) - Although I can eat a pig from the roota to the Toota!

Great salad! Made for 4th of July party and everyone raved - I did add some sour cream in w/the mayo so it wouldn't taste like ALL mayonnaise, besides that, I wouldn't change a thing - Delish!

Based on reviews I used half mayo, half sour cream, a squirt of dijon, some fresh garlic, and a dash of dill.  Scrumptious!  It's a really unusual and interesting potato salad.  Love it!

Normaly I am not a fan of potato salad. This I loved as did my family when I made it for a holiday meal. I did omit the celery because I didnt have any, but it came out great. Next time I am going to try cooking the onionn so it doesnt cause heartburn for those that cant have raw onions.

This recipe was great just as is, however, to give it a little more zip, I used 1/2 Mayonaise and 1/2 Miracle Whip.  I didn't have any problem with my bacon getting soggy, but I used the pre-cooked bacon you buy at the store, it worked out perfectly!

Absolutely delicious!  I used light mayonnaise and only half a pound of bacon to try and make it a little lighter.  I also used scallions instead of onions as recommended by other reviewers.

I've been making a salad like this for year make this without the bacon and everybody LOVES it!  Besides dessert it's my number one requested dish to bring.
I've thought about adding bacon to it in the past, after reading this I will for the 4th!

This was the first potato salad I have ever made, and judging by the fact that there was none left for me to try I would say it was a big hit.  I made it for a family cookout and it was gone in an instant!  My sister-in-law said it tasted like the best baked potato she had ever had.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband really liked this recipe.  I made one small change - I used baby red potatoes and just halved or quartered them, depending on their size. I've never cooked a hard-boiled egg that like before that it worked great. Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing! Kicked it up a notch by adding:
Green onions instead of regular(1 stalk)
Red onions (1/2 cup)..adds sweet/acidy
Too much mayo! (1 cup mayo + 1/2 cup sour cream)
Dill to taste
Some pickle juice
Shredded cheddar
Garnished top with chopped chives and paprika

I don't know why I ever bothered making other potato salads! The only changes I made was using green onions and turkey bacon. This has now become our Sunday dinner side dish. Tasty!

the best potato salad ever! the crunchiness of the bacon, onions and celery goes perfectly with the soft potatoes and eggs.  I liked it better when the bacon is fried until it's kind of dry and crispy

This was a nice change of pace! I, too, went with half mayo/sour cream. 6 eggs seemed a bit much, so I used 3, and I also used green onion (essential). Addinging a half pack of ranch dressing mix and a couple dashes of dill weed are great additions, too.

I made this for our Memorial Day BBQ. It was good, but I had to tweak it a little to suit our tastes. I added a little mustard and used less eggs than called for. This was good though with those alterations (the only reason I gave 4* instead of 5*). I will be making this again. Thanks!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I would however boil the potato's a bit longer and maybe cut them up before boiling them.  My husband also suggested adding some shredded cheese, and it was so good.  I had to have some for breakfast the next morning.

I highly suggest you start with 1 cup mayo and work up from there. I had to steam some extra potato's so it wasnt so mayo-ey. I ended up using 3 pounds of potato's but would have added more if I had some. I first made it as stated the let it sit over night and tasted before making changes, upon which I added cider vinegar, dill, garlic and a wee bit of mustard.

Very easy to follow and it turned out great!  I made a smaller batch but added more onion, celery, and hard-boiled egg.  Instead of mixing the bacon into the salad, I just sprinkled the pieces on the top of the salad prior to putting it into the fridge so they wouldn't get too soft.  To ensure your potatoes aren't mushy, try steaming them for about 15-20 minutes. The potatoes turned out great!

Really yummy and easy to make.  I didnt use a whole cup of mayo.  I only used half and that itself was alot.  I also used half a cup of sour cream like others suggested.  The bacon added a nice crunch but next time, I think I will use bacon bits instead just to save time.  Other than that, it was really good!

Best potato salad I've ever had with few changes:  Like others, I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Green onions instead of regular onion.  Added about 1 TBS of mustard.  Sprinkled just a bit of paprika on it.  Delicious!!

This potato salad was really really good.  The bacon is definitely the key ingredient!  I gave it 4 stars because I was expecting a bit more because of all the other rave reviews.  But I will definitely be making this again!  The only changes I made was cutting the potatoes before boiling them, and I added lots of spices such as paprika, garlic powder, a little bit of dill, and celery seed.

I made this salad tonight to serve with BBQ ribs and we liked it just fine, but it wasn't anything spectacular.  I cut the recipe in half (which would easily have served 5 people), but added the full amount of celery and onion (I used green onion).  Instead of mayo, I used Miracle Whip and used much less than 1 cup.  The end result wasn't terrible, it just wasn't that exciting.

WOW! This is by far the best tater salad I ever had. The bacon is what makes it so delicious. Made it for my girlfriend and her family who are all in the restaurant business and they were all impressed. Will continue to make this for sure-thanks Donna.

Made this for a BBQ & EVERYONE loved it!!  Used green onions and I think the key was I poured the bacon grease over the diced potatoes before mixing everything together.  Highly recommended!!

I thought this was pretty good but my guests weren't too carazy about it. The potatoes took alot longer to cook (about 20 minutes) and still weren't the right texture. Maybe next time i will cut them first and then boil them. Make sure you cut them into small pieces. I cut up my bacon before I cooked it for easier and faster cooking. The overall taste was pretty good. I might make this again for myself, but I'm going to stick to a more traditional one for my next party.

DELISH!!! I would only make sure you cut the potatoes into bite size pieces after cooking, use green onions and make sure you let it sit at least one hour, overnight is even better. Thanks so much Deborah, its a keeper!

I got more compliments on this than on any potato salad I've done before. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to it & made it a hit. I've made this with both the reds & Yukon potatoes. Winner with both kinds of spuds.

This was good! I did make some changes though...I used red and white potatoes instead of just red. I also used a red onion. I added mustard, paprika, and parsley. Next time I will use less mayo and less onion.

This was probably the best potato salad I have ever had! Delicious! It was a hit at our Father's Day BBQ. I used green onions instead of regular onions, and used bacon bits instead of real bacon (pressed for time.) Thank you for such an easy and fabulous recipe!

Made this for Memorial Day cookout, everyone loved it! I took advice from other reviews and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and green onion instead of white onion. I'm going to make it again for Father's Day this weekend.

This salad came out great. I did cut the recipe in half because we had alot of side dishes. I also liked the bacon flavor and will keep this recipe in the regular file.

It was okay - but great after substitutions.  I left out the celery and onion.  Replaced half of the mayo with sour cream and added yellow mustard and a little sugar (to taste) to the dressing.

This is the best. I think it would be just as good even without the bacon in it (plus it would be less work). This was very good!!!!

We almost made ourselves sick pigging out on this. It's so good. I was worried that salt and pepper wouldn't be enough seasoning, but it had so much flavor as written. Also, the proportions are perfect even though it sounds like a lot of bacon, eggs, and onion, it turns out just perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, now I know what to serve at summer bbqs!!

Actually this was the first time I ever made potato salad.  Very easy...very good. I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo (instead of 2).  Maybe next time will some mustard.

this was the very first time I made a potato salad, and not only was it easy - it was creamy, and smooth.  I did substitute with green onion instead of a regular onion, and halved the mayonnaise with sour cream.  I might have left the bacon out until an hour before serving next time - but it was FANTASTIC... and our company asked for the recipe - so you get 10 stars from us!

This salad is awesome, my sweetheart said it's the best he's ever had and I really can't argue with him.  I put green onions in it and reduce the amount of the regular onion just to add a little more color.

This is the most amazing potato salad ever!  I have always hated potato salad until I tried this.  THe ratio of the ingredients is what makes it so superb. Yummy bacon and eggs!  It has been a hit with family and friends since I found this recipe here a few years ago now!  Thank you Donna!

This is the most awesome potato salad.  My husband and our friends are not potato salad eaters and they could not get enough!!!!  My adjustments to the recipe are as follows:  I sauteed the onions in the bacon grease with 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar.  1C of mayonnaise and 1C of  sour cream like suggested by another viewer.  I used horseradish mustard instead of stone mustard.  Use sweet vidalia onions. We are not huge lovers of eggs so we didn't use any and didn't miss them at all.

I am not a big potato salad eater but I made this for the 4th of July, only suggestion I'd make is cutting the recipe down as it made a ton and I still had some leftover a week later.

I have made this several times, most people like it.  I would recommend adding a little miracle whip to this to give a sweeter taste.  I also recommend using only 3/4lb bacon, still gives a huge bacon flavor.

Excellent. I added seasoning salt and cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes. Do not leave out the bacon - it adds a unique flavor and really makes the dish.

This potato salad is fabulous!  My teen hates potato salad, but we were able to get him to eat this one.  I also brought this potato salad to serve with ham at our church Christmas dinner; it was a big hit! A well seasoned cook in our church that ate this, told me that it is by far the best potato salad she has ever had, even better than her mother's and that was the best she could remember.
I had many people asking for the recipe, because the salad was real creamy. I didn't change anything from the recipe given.

I made this for yesterday's brunch and it was very good.  I am personally not much of a potato salad fan but I thought it was really tasty.  It was much better than the usual perhaps due to the bacon.  I added two extra celery ribs and used low fat mayo to make it slightly healthier.

Excellent simple recipe. Really can be used as a base for about any vegetable. Add peppers, carrots, etc for color and a different twist. There are never any leftovers with this dish! *****!

This is a good potato salad. I added a small red onion and still found the flavour a bit too strong for my taste. I also decreased the mayo to 1.5 cups. Will make this again. Thanks.

I'm not a huge fan of potato salad, but I liked this recipe a lot.  It has a really good mix of flavors.  I might add scallions next time.  It's also a very good recipe.  I got it right the first time around.  Thanks for sharing, Donna!

Potato salad has never been my strong point, but my husband was craving potato salad, and I decided to surf the net. Thank goodness this recipe was there! I have it in the refrigerator now to chill for an hour, but my husband's already tasted it and thinks it's delicious! Thanks-- I think he's already given me a gold star by my name. :)

I will start by saying this recipe is not for everyone.  I made this recipe with the 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo...  It is my new favorite salad.  My family loved it and we cleaned the serving bowl... I served it at my 4th party (exact same setup) and it was hardly touched.  This salad has a unique flavor that I absolutely love, if you are serving a picky crowd and you have not made this before I would make a test batch the week before and see how you like it.  This recipe will be made over and over in my house! 5 Star Salad.

Great salad.  I did the 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayonnaise.  I only used 1/2  of a red onion and chopped it finely.  I also added two more yolks as my family loves yolks.  It was rich and creamy.  The bacon gave it a great surprise and I used the pre-made stuff to save time.   Oh and I used half red potatoes and half russet as I didn't have enough red.  I added a teaspoon of dill and of cayenne with lots of pepper.  Everyone loved it.

My husband is not a big fan of potato salad, but I knew I found a winner when he got up for a second helping! Thanks for a great recipe...a definite keeper. Per others' suggestions, I did use the 1 cup sour cream/1 cup mayo and red onion. Perfect.

The best potato salad I have ever had!  Per the suggestions, I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup mayo for the dressing.  I also used 3/4 lb bacon, but thick cut (less fat, more meat).  Also used red onion, which added a little bite.  Thanks for the recipe Donna!

This is a good start for potato salad...I left the skin on and added some vinegar and mustard and additional seasoning.  But it was nice to have something to go on as a starting point.

The only things I changed in the recipe was using red onion instead of white and I didn't peel the potatoes. This is by far the best potato salad I've ever had--and it was so easy to make. I didn't even have leftovers to try the next day. This is definately a keeper. Thanks Donna!

This has a great creamy texture, but the flavor is kind of bland.  I used half sour cream and half mayo as suggested by other reviewers.  You need to add a lot of seasonings to this recipe, but it's a good starting point.

I wanted a red skinned potato salad recipe that would be easy...this definitely was. I did alter it a bit though, I did not put in any eggs (personal preference) and instead of 2 C mayo, I (like others) used 1 C mayo, 1 C sour cream (light). I picked up about a 1/2 C of bacon crumbles at the salad bar of my grocery store (one less step!), and seasoned up the whole mix with about 3T dill weed, a bit of celery salt and onion. I was told that people who didn't normally eat potato salad loved this!

This is the best potato salad I have ever had.  I added a pinch of celery seed for extra flavor.  It would have been perfect as is.  I don't want to lose this recipe.

What a delicious recipe.  Made it for 4th of July and it was all eaten up.  I followed other peoples advice and changed mayo to 1 cup and added 1 cup sour cream and also added a little relish.  Will definately keep in my recipe file.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I quadrupled this recipes for a graduation party.  I followed other peoples recommendations of using half sour cream and half mayo.  Next time I make it I think I will use only 1/4 sour cream and the rest mayo.  I thought the taste of sour cream was a little strong but everybody LOVED it.  Will definetly make again!

This is the best.  I also took the advice of others and used half the amount of mayo.  Replacing it with sour cream.  The dill was also a nice extra.

Made this today for Easter dinner tomorrow and as I was making it I was tasting it and it was fabulous.  I also tweaked it and used less mayo and added some sour cream and fresh dill to it.  If using smaller potatoes cook less.  I can't stress enough using fresh parsley and dill vs. in the jar spices.  Does make a bif difference.  Also to let your cooked/diced potatoes get cold before adding anything else helps them stand up in the salad better.  I can't wait until tomorrow's dinner!!  Thanks.

Wow! What a great potato salad!  It was a *HUGE* hit at my daughter's birthday party.  Everyone wanted a copy.  Even the husbands were asking me to get copies to their wives.  Really and truly a delicious salad. I had to boil the potatoes a little longer though, at 15 minutes, they were still a little too firm. Otherwise, it was a delicious creamy blending of flavors.  Thanks to Donna for helping to make the menu for our party a real SUCCESS!!!

This is a nice potato salad - very similar to the way my mother made her salad. I've tried it with red and regular idahos - and it makes up great either way. Even cutting this back to 6 servings left plenty for leftovers (which didn't last long!). Thanks Donna!

This was a great potato salad recipe.  I'm not a big fan of potato salads but I loved this one.  I added some chopped green onions which added a much too strong flavor as the flavors blended.  This recipe doesn't need any tweaking.  It's great.

Wow! This was really good! I have never been a fan of mayo-based salads, but try to cater to the many people in my life who are. This potato salad has just about converted me. I added dill, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. Everyone loved it!

Very good recipe, and so simple.  Not very healthy, but great for those few occasions throughout the year that call for a real celebration cookout.  Angela

I made this for a church potluck. I thought it tasted great and I received great reviews on it.  Being high fat, with all of the bacon and mayonnaise, the leftovers went home with another person.  Not on my eating plan.

This was easy!  I took advice of another reviewer and used half miracle whip and half sour cream. Omitted onions because I don’t like them. Added salad cubed pickles, paprika and parsley.  I did all the prep yesterday and put it together tonight.  I’ll drive tomorrow.   It’s good!!!

I didn't follow measurements so much as i followed ingredients.  I added finely chopped RED onion and fresh dill. Less mayo and sour cream.   Colors popped nicely.

Made this last night, the potatoes required a longer cook time and I did quarter mine. Prepared as the recipe as described but add 1 cup sour cream. Bacon adds that something and sauteed the onions and celery. Perfect, and chilled in fridge before serving. 
Note: Before I combined the mayo mixture with potatoes I sprinkled the potatoes with Old Bay Seasoning!

made it today and I like to play with recipes. I added 4 cups chopped eggs, I added McCormick salad toppings to the salad as I had no bacon but there is bacon bits in the salad topping which gives it crunch. I added dill weed onion powder,  mrs dash,dill mustard 1 cap of white vinegar,  mixed up well and chilled. perfect. I may just do the recipe as is next time but I am pleased with the results today.

This was delicious!  I added another stalk of celery and also altered the dressing a bit.  I used 1 cup sour cream and 2 cups Kraft mayo—mashed my egg yolks and added to their mixture.  For seasoning I used Johnny’s Seasoning salt and pepper .  Will definitely make this again!  It was so creamy and has a ton of flavor .

I doubled the recipe. I used two cups of sour cream and two cups of Hellman's mayonnaise. Instead of chopping an onion I used a small bunch of green onions. I also added maybe a cup of mixed cheddar cheese. I decided not to add the eggs as my family prefers it without them. I feel like the red potatoes hold their shape better in this recipe. 5 stars with my changes its our new potato salad recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, and it was absolutely delicious. It's rare that I actually even like potato salad, but I went back for seconds of this. I'll definitely make it again.

I did take the advice of others & add 1/2 sour cream.  I am not really sure how many potatoes I had, but I put 2 eggs and 1/2 onion with the celery.   I thought this recipe is a great guideline!!

Super delicious. I made this with half the bacon and about a cup and a half of mayonnaise. It turned out delicious. Next time I will only use half the onion because I felt there was a little too much onion. Otherwise it was delicious.

Unlike others, I love bacon in my potato salad, but I think it's a little bland as is and too many onions for me.  I cut back on the onions and celery (just don't care for it)  Added some paprika, garlic powder, and 2 thinly sliced radishes.

I tweak it a bit based on other reviews.  
 I pre cut the red potatoes into  bite sizes then cooked them.  In a  separate bowl I mixed 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 sour cream, added a dash of mustard,  some dried chives and since my bacon was salty I only added pepper.

I ended up using almost 4 lbs of potatoes, and cooked my onions a little before adding which added a nice flavor. Added some garlic powder and paprika as well.
Next time i will definitely dice my celery finer.

I have only tried it warm so far - and it was excellent. Looking forward to seeing how it is chilled. (:

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I omitted the celery because I’m not a fan and reduced the onion to 1/2 and it was perfect for me! My family really enjoyed it and I will be making this again in the very near future!

Loved this, did make a few changes as I have a "non egg lover" in my family therefore I boiled eggs , chopped and left on the side for people to add in.  I used about 1/2 a 5 lb. bag of red potatoes, cubed them before boiling - the 15 minutes was perfect.  I added a TBSP or so of mustard and a dash of vinegar to mayo mixture and used 1 bunch of Green onion.

Simple and great! I always use half mayo half miracle whip on any salad that call for mayo. Gives it a little extra tangy zip.

I boiled the eggs normally and refrigerated them. I used 5lbs. Potatoes for this recipe and I diced the potatoes into bite sized pieces and boiled them for 10 minutes  only. I diced the bacon before cooking. To the salad I added 1/2 red bell pepper, I used 1/2 yellow onion and a whole bunch of celery. I also added 1/4 c. Dijon mustard. Everyone loved it.

I used less mayo... maybe 2 cups with a squirt of mustard. I mixed 1/2 a vidalia and 1/2 a sweet onion. No celery because I don't like it. I added a variety of spices: garlic powder, Cajun, cayenne in addition to the pepper and very light salt. I did not have the bacon but think that would have also tasted good. The potatoes could have used a few more minutes boiling. I added the seasonings in layers as I cut the potatoes. Once chilled, the dish seemed more bland. Without my spin, I think it would have tasted too mayonnaisey.  Overall it was a great side dish that really stood out.

Except for using a red onion instead of regular I made no other substitutions. I read the reviews and took someone’s advice about sautéing the onions and celery in the bacon grease- great idea!! This came out delicious!! I don’t even care for potato salad that much but I loved this one! Definitely a keeper ;)

The only thing I did different was russet potatoes instead of red, didn't have red skinned.  I chunked the potatoes before I cooked them and they were perfectly done, usually some  pieces are overdone and some not done. I don't even like potato salad that much and this recipe was wonderful. My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I thought there was going to be too much mayonnaise, but glad I didn't change it. My mother always sprinkled paprika over the top of her potato salad, I sprinkled this recipe with smoked paprika. Made it very tasty.

It was very good . The recipe is very close to the one I usually make. I did make two changes - I used celery seeds in place of celery and I added yellow mustard which has been done in my family for at least four generations. Everyone liked the red potatoes with the skin on - there was none left to bring home.  I will make it again.

Very good recipe! Great flavor with simple ingredients.  The only change was  3 scallions instead of regular onion. Also used turkey bacon for family preference. Definitely saved in favorites.

This was my FIRST potato salad I have ever made and boy was it DELICIOUS !!!  I did what others recommended and reduced the amount of mayonnaise to 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream plus a tablespoon of French's yellow mustard.  I received SO many compliments about this potato salad !!!  To cut down the amount of prep time, I boiled the eggs, cooked the potatoes, and cooked the bacon all at the same time on 3 burners.  I also substituted the onions with 3 stalks of green onions finely chopped.  Thank you for this recipe !!!  It's truly a KEEPER !!!

I made this for a family gathering today and it turned out awesome! The only change I made was using half onion and half green onion (just because I had some green onions that needed to be used.) Everyone LOVED this salad and especially loved the bacon in it. The flavors of this salad were excellent together. Thank you for the recipe!

This is now requested at EVERY family gathering ever. For the last few years or so. Only tiny change I make is to add a splash of ranch dressing while mixing in the mayo. It is time consuming and waiting to it to "meld together" requires patience, but this is so good.

My family loved this potato salad.  I made it with bacon bits instead of frying up regular bacon but it worked.  I can't wait to make this potato salad again.  We'll never buy store bought again (unless it's marked down to less than $1)

Excellent! I used mayonnaise, 4 eggs, green onions, and half a pound of bacon. I also let the potatoes cool before adding the other ingredients. That way the mayonnaise wasn't totally absorbed with the warm potatoes. Delicious!

Without a doubt the best potato salad ever!  I've been making this for years.  I thought it was an old family recipe. LOL.  We only use Hellmann's mayo.  I think any other brand would not be nearly as good.

Great potato salad. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I won’t add the bacon, I don’t think it really added anything to the salad.

Potato salad is potato salad.  Not much to boast about.  Adding bacon is a nice touch.  However I wash and dice my potatoes first  THEN boil them.  Never understood why anyone would cook them first.  I'm certainly am not going to follow this recipe to the "T" !  Everyone should put their own special touches on their tater salad.  It's not rocket science!  Have fun!

Dang this is good. I usually make my potato salad with relish and mustard, so I was a little skeptical at first, but I’m never going back. This was amazing. The bacon gave it a nice salty crunch. I did use green onions instead of a regular onion just because I like the color it gives but I’m sure it would be the same either way. Delicious.

So I made this recipe and found the directions to be a little off.  For the potatoes, 15 min isn't nearly long enough unless you want hard potatoes in your salad.  I would recommend quartering the potatoes and cooking until they're soft.  I followed the advice of others and used green onions and I used half sour cream, half mayo.  To make the bacon cook more crisp, I put the package in the freezer for about 20 min, then chopped all the bacon up, before cooking.   It was quite delicious!!!

Delicious! Following the suggestions shared by others,I substituted green onions and added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I also used only a half pound of bacon. Although it took some preparation, it was well worth the time!

This recipe was exactly what I wanted and what I remembered of the one my mom made. It turned out perfectly. I only added one strip of bacon because that's all I had on hand, but it was still delicious. I did add a little bit of yellow prepared mustard because our family is a mustard potato salad family, and I used a bit less mayo, more like a cup and a half.

I did make a change... I added 1 1/2 cups of mayonnaise and it was fine. The next time I may add a bit more salt as I was afraid of making it too salty because of the bacon already in it. But I would rather have to add salt as I am eating it, then trying to fix a too much salt situation. We baked our bacon in the oven on racks so the fat would drip under it in large 14 by 10 pans. We baked it at 400 for 20 minutes but had to keep adding time as our bacon was somewhere between thin and thick. It is Delicious!!!!!! This will be my "always" recipe for potato salad!

Another great recipe for Summertime! Made this on a Friday evening for consumption during the whole Memorial Day weekend. The minor adjustments made were just 1 cup mayo, half cup sour cream, a couple tbsps of dijon mustard, fresh dill and sprinkled paprika on top. Will amend review following the Holiday weekend.

5/25/18 I used scallions and not any celery. I used 3lb. of red potatoes and 1/2 mayo and 1/2 reduced fat sour cream and only 1/2 of the bacon.  I just made it and so far it seems bland even though i added dill, Laurey Salt and some sea salt. I hope that by the time I take it to the pot luck, the seasonings will have added  some flavor.

Great base recipe, but it had too much mayo and not enough seasoning... so I started out with less mayo (adding until it was a good consistency-- ended up being around 1-1/4  cups) and after tasting, added fresh dill and a tiny bit of fresh thyme.

2 lbs of salad devoured in a day. My hubby loved it. I added dill and parsley, and prepared mustard for more flavor. Topped with paprika. Lovely recipe, will make again.

This is our family's go to potato salad recipe and we love it so much! We do like to split up the mayo with sour cream, and I like to use both the green onion with some crunchy onion together as well. My husband swears by adding just a bit of mustard, and it really does add a depth to this dish.

This potato salad is the BEST ever!! The small red potatoes really are the best, and the bacon and red onion really added the flavor!  Like some suggested, I did add about 2T. of dill relish and some of the juice, and used 1 c. Hellman's plus 1 c. reduced fat sour cream rather than 2 c. Hellman's.  But I think it would have been just a delicious without these minor changes.  I had a bowl before putting in the frig for a cookout tomorrow.  Can't wait to serve it.  I'll never make plain mustard potato salad again!

I made this salad today for the first time, and stuck pretty close to the directions. The only thing extra I added with celery salt for flavor. Also, I mixed up the bacon as instructed, but are using additional four pieces crumble across the top for looks. Super easy super good!

I made this exactly as it was listed. I made a double recipe for my son's Blue and Gold ceremony yesterday. (I let the potatoes chill overnight instead of 1 hour that is recommended.) The potato salad was a huge hit. Only a small bite was left in the big bowl and my son finished it.

Thanks for sharing. I'm saving this recipe for the future.

The Red Potato Salad came out great. I followed the recipe except I didn’t add the bacon. Next time  I’ll buy already cooked bacon and crumble it. . I refused to cook the onions in the bacon. At all costs I wanted to avoid the bacon grease. . I thinly coated the pan of onions with olive oil and cooked until they were lightly browned. I chilled for three hours and served. Everybody when for seconds and thirds. I am glad I made more servings than people. I will definitely make it again.

Best potato salad I have ever had, my family devoured it. Only change I made was to add some diced sweet pickles and a shot of pickle juice, because that’s home my mom did it. Making this again tomorrow for the Super Bowl!

We've been searching for a potato salad recipe for years with little success.  I was a bit skeptical about this recipe because I thought there weren't enough ingredients.  I was wrong.  This recipe was absolutely fantastic - better than we ever expected.  We may try tweaking it a bit (mayo/Miracle Whip, adding cheese and maybe mustard) - even without those tweaks, this recipe is absolutely fantastic!!

I have had lots of potato salads in the past from homemade to store bought, from ones made with miracle whip to ones made with helmans, and this recipe stopped me in my potato salad hopping tracks!! I haven't and won't change a thing about it! I get so many compliments when I make it and I triple the recipe (5lb bag of potatoes) and it's always gone by the next night hahaha. Love love love this recipe and highly recommend making it if you like to show off your cooking skills at the family parties lol

Love potato salad and this is a great recipe. I substitute green onions for onions like most recommendations, but I'm thinking the cups of mayonnaise are a bit excessive. Going to try adding some mustard you this as I like mustard potato salad more

This was a delicious hit at our Sunday School retreat!! My daughter and I enjoyed the little bit of leftovers afterwards! This was very easy to make and I prepared a bunch of it the day before. My only thought is to cut up the potatoes before boiling them as the 15-17 minutes left them a little crunchy.   While that is fine with me (I eat raw potatoes sometimes), the others commented on it.  Otherwise,  it was perfect!

This was a big hit! Definitely a keeper for my family!  I did use green onions only because I was lacking the large.  Also I split the mayo by using 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayonnaise.  I don't think it did a thing to hurt the flavor!  With all that bacon you can't go wrong!  I sprinkled it with smoked paprika as well!  Yum!

I cannot fairly rate this recipe as I made several changes using this as the base.  First we omitted bacon, we find it gets a little soggy the next day. Second we used miracle whip and yellow mustard to taste omitting the mayo. We added dill relish and a splash of vinegar.  Finally after the dish is finished we topped with paprika and sliced eggs. Thanks for getting my creative juices going!

Everyone loves this salad!  I usually use more potatoes and less bacon.  It always comes out great.  I never measure the mayo ...just keep adding until it's wet enough!  Sometimes I add a dollop of miracle whip.

Made this for a 4th of July party and it was a hit!  I followed a few suggestions from other reviews and subbed green onion and 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo.  The bacon really made it and gave it the perfect "baked potato" taste in the form of a salad.  Will definitely be making again.  I want to try subbing out the mayo entirely with Greek yogurt and sour cream.

I made this potato salad for a family gathering for the Fourth of July.  Everyone loved it!  I used a combination of Yukon Gold and Red Potatoes because that is what I had on hand. Tasted great!  I did not use nearly the amount of mayo - probably cut it in half.  I think it tasted more homemade  that way since the prepared potato salads always seem to have too much mayo.

Really enjoyed this recipe at a family BBQ. I only gave it 4 stars, because I think the ratio of potatoes to other ingredients is off. I used 1/2 of everything else to 2 lbs. of potatoes and it was perfect. Everyone loved it!

Really liked this potato salad recipe. I cut the mayo down to 1.5 cups and used Dukes (which is awesome!). I also added about a tablespoon of sweet relish. Tasted FANTASTIC! Was great for our 4th of July party!!

This was sooooo good. I made this with gold potatoes because for whatever reason I couldn't find red potatoes in the grocery store. Still good! I couldn't keep myself away from this stuff. I was worried about adding in all the bacon because I thought it might get soggy, although it did lose a little bit of its crunch, it wasn't off-putting at all. This has a permanent place in my recipe box!

I've made this a few times now and it is really very good and is even better with a few tweeks. I too used half mayo and half sour cream which softens down the mayo quite a bit. I sauté my onions in some of the bacon drippings but i leave the celery raw for that awesome little crunch. I add a little paprika, basil, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano and a tiny bit of cayenne for a bit of a loaded potato taste and a bit of colour.  This has gotten rave reviews, especially from my hubby who is a self professed connoisseur of potato salads. This is best eaten the next day for all the flavours to meld but is great too with a few hours of refrigeration time. I always make this with pulled pork with a cole slaw topping with apples and a bit of pineapple for a quirky punch. Perfect summertime combination.

I made the changes like the other reviewers said to do. I used green onion, used half mayo/half sour cream, added bacon at the end, and cooled potatoes with red vinegar. I also seasoned it with seasoning salt and celery seed. It received rave reviews from fam/dinner guests and I'd definitely make it again.

Classic, simple flavors that really please the taste buds! I used what I had on hand which was red onion and Trader Joe's applewood smoked bacon with Best Foods mayonnaise, plus eggs and celery. This recipe seems like it would be easy to have substitutions like different onions, the addition cheese. Just don't forget the bacon!

Made this early in the morning for dinner. I let the flavors meld all day and it was delicious. I used the recipe as a base; I added the following: green onions, extra celery, mustard, cayenne pepper and a tablespoon of dill relish. It came out delicious, looking forward to making this one again. This is my new go-to potato salad. Next time, will use less mayo, by 1/3 cup or so.

So I was looking for a potato salad that didn't have mustard in it at my wife's request. This one looked delicious so I tried it. I made a few changes and it turned out great. I used 7 pounds of potatoes, 2.5 pounds of bacon, 7 eggs, 2 stalks of celery, 2 white onions, 1-30oz jar of mayo, and 1.5 cups of sour cream. It turned out far better than expected and it tastes like a baked potato.

Excellent! I've made this many times. As written it's wonderful. Sometimes I put a little sour cream with the mayo. I add garlic salt, and green onions. I usually omit the celery because I rarely use it in anything. when I remember, I buy peeled hard boiled eggs from the store to save time. I always get rave reviews when I make this dish. the bacon puts it over the top!

Love this recipe the bacon was something different for us. I did add mustard as my mom always had mustard in her potato and macaroni salad. Good without the mustard also

I used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of mayo and red onion. Yum! Next time I am going to try green onion.

This is absolutely best potato salad recipe. I've been making it for about a year now and my son requests it all the time. Only thing I change is using green onions instead of regular onions as I have a few in my crew that won't eat onions.

I've made this numerous times with excellent feedback! Recently I've removed the potatoes and added 1 head of roasted cauliflower florets to make it low carb, and EVERYONE has asked for my recipe!

The recipe didn't indicate as to the kind of onion used, however I used red and it turned out amazing.  At first I thought, hmmm, potato salad without mustard.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It paired well with grilled chicken and corn on the cob.  I highly recommend it!!

I've tried many potato salad recipes and this is by far the best....I did make some minor adjustments as we like crunch in our potato salad I used green onions 1 red bell pepper  and 1 green bell pepper both diced and uncooked just to give this a little extra crunch

This was wonderful! I did not have bacon so I used real bacon bits instead. I also added sour cream for a little extra creaminess. Even without those changes, I believe this would have been great! All of my kids liked it so it must be good...

Great!  Only change for us was the package of bacon was only 12oz and we used a red onion.  People were saying it was the best potato salad they ever had, and were fighting over the last bit left.

I made this per the directions and it was just ok. Not very flavorful. I ended up adding more celery, Dijon mustard and fresh parsley.

Made this recipe as indicated & didn't think it was very flavorful. Made it again with one cup each sour cream & mayo, a big scoop of sweet pickle relish, a big dollop of spicy mustard, dried dill, spring/green onion, shredded cheese, & one small package each of Hormel peppered & original crumbles. With these changes I was told, "it's the best potato salad I've ever eaten."  I'd say it's a good basic recipe to change up and make your own.

This a was the first Potato salad I have my. It was super good! I don't think I used as much mayo as the directions called for and I think next time I'll use less onion. But I'll definitely make it again!!!

I made no substitutes, served on christmas. Everyone enjoyed it, and I was asked for the recipe by one family member. The recipe didn't state what kind of onion to use, so I used an "all purpose" bulk yellow onion. The onion flavor seemed very sharp for this recipe, so I would make it again but will try using a red onion.  This is one of the easier potato salads I've made.

Made as is. Could have cut back on the mayo. Could have added a bit of celery salt. Will try both next time. But was still yummy as described.

This was by far the best potato salad recipe I have ever tried or eaten. Only a few subs. I used green onions instead of white and I used a cup of sour cream instead of the mayo. With a little extra seasoning to taste

We loved this potato salad, it was a nice change from our regular potato salad. The bacon was a nice addition along with the celery. I was nearly out of mayo so added some sour cream. Yum!!!!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!!! This is seriously the best mayo based potato salad I've EVER had!!! I do recommend cutting up the potatoes prior to boiling, because the skins don't hold on well after boiling and trying to chop them cooled. Dont be afraid to season the potatoes well while boiling with salt!  This is my GO TO potato salad for any get together or even just because. I'll NEVER make it any other way now-and I've been making this recipe for years now!!

Delicious! I love this potato salad. I made it without bacon or celery. Just potatoes, eggs, green onion and mayo! It's so simple, but so good. My go-to potato salad recipe! A tip: I grate my hard boiled eggs - easier than chopping!

Incredibly easy and I had more compliments on this salad than on anything I've made! I did make a couple changes. I used 5#red pots and increased mayo to 3 cups. Fabulous!

Made this for a BBQ and it was a big hit.  I omitted the bacon because of some vegetarians attending and used only 1 1/2 cups of mayo (light).  Otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks Donna

Very good! You can definitely use less mayo. Next time I'll use only use 1.5 cups of mayo. I omitted the bacon and added some fresh dill and used Lawry's instead of salt. Will make again.

I am not a really good cook, but this recipe hit the spot.  Everyone thinks I am a genius.  I did not use all 2 cups of mayo and I split it half and half with sour cream.  Probably used only 1 to 1.5 cups.   I was determined to find a good potato salad recipe so we ate a different one several times a week for a month.  This one won.

I have made this innumerable amount of times.  My hubby wont eat any other recipe!!  I too mix 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and I add diced green peppers, cause I want the crunch and the color......The rest I follow.  I do cheat with  bacon but that is just because how can you cook a pound of bacon and not eat one or 2 pieces.  I CAN'T......You are a much stronger person than me if you can resist.  Thank you so much for a great recipe and one that has been served over and over and over again!!!

I finally found a great potato salad recipe that I can't mess up! You really have to make sure the potatoes are cooked long enough.  They were still hard after the cooking time suggested in the recipe .  But otherwise I loved all the ingredients - I will definitely make this again!

My first time to make potato salad other than my grandmother's recipe. This one is fabulous. The bacon gives it a little extra flavor, not the traditional potato salad flavor.

I made some this morning. I will post back after the family tries it. I used all ingredients listed but did add a pinch of garlic powder, parsley and heaping TBL. of spicy brown mustard. It tastes delicious to my taste buds! Now if I get the thumbs-up from the kids tonight I will be a happy camper! Thanks for sharing!

     Edit: Man what a hit this was! Everyone liked it so much I'm making it again tonight. This might replace my go-to recipe for potato salad!

Followed recipe without any changes. Should have doubled the recipe as the family demolished it and was asking for more. Only downside is that it is a bit time consuming to make (but well worth the time!).

I loved this recipe!! I use my new potatoes that I raised myself. My husband loved this salad and asked me to make it again. I use bacon bits instead of frying bacon, it tasted great!! I will defiantly  make again :-)

I nixed the celery and added a little bit of mustard. Still delicious with great texture! I also cubed the potatoes before boiling, and it came out great.

Using bacon in potato salad gives it a great additional flavor.  I am not a big fan of mayo so I started with one cup and then added in more as I stirred.  I would say I did 1.5 cups.  I also put in a half a cup of mustard to give it a little more of the traditional taste.

This is a wonderful recipe that guests raved about. I followed others' suggestions and used scallions instead of onion and they added both color and wonderful flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Just made this potato salad which was my first. After reading reviews, I halved the mayonnaise and made up the rest with mustard and sour cream. Added sweet relish, dill weed and celery salt (because I didn't have celery).   Delish!

I have made this recipe 5 times now with slight modifications.  I used Japanese mayonaise with sour cream.  I added paprika for color & taste.  Used Costco's Kirkland Signature Bacon bits and bought hard boiled eggs (saved some time).  I added shredded cheddar cheese & parsley.  I used red onion and green onions.   I traditionally make 2-2.5 times the recipe.   I keep getting asked to make this for BBQ's.  Yummy!!!

This is my favourite potatoe salad! I made it as a warm potatoe salad and get high reviews every time I make it. I've made it on 3 separate occasions. I used baby red potatoes, cooked them whole, then sliced them in half once they were cooked. My only change that I did was use an aioli (from Costco) instead of mayo. I can't rave enough about this salad.

I have made this recipe multiple times and it is a favorite in our house.  Although it appears to be too much bacon and mayo for the 2 pounds of potato, do it!!  It is an amazing recipe. The only thing I change is the onion for green onions. It's delicious. I use a whole "bunch" of green onions in the place of white onions. Comes out perfectly.

OMG so yummy! We usually but pre made from the store and this is worlds better! I will defn be making this again,l. I set the recipe for 15 as I needed it for that many and used all the ingredients as written EXCEPT I used a teeny bit less mayo as my husband doesn't like the taste as much. It seems like a lot of stuff when you are prepping but when you add together it works perfectly. Left the bacon off until the day of serving and crumbled on top so it wouldn't get soggy. Lots of compliments on this one, thank you for sharing this recipe!

A success the first time I made it, easy to make. I cooked the onions in the bacon grease, I added corn and I topped with fresh green onions. My husband and I both loved it.

I made one small change, replaced about 1/4 cup of the two cups mayo with Dijon mustard.  I also replaced the salt with garlic salt.   Very good salad and expect it will be even better the next day.

Wow - delicious.  I made it about 8 hours ahead of time and it was so delicious.  Even better the next day I think.  I made it exact per the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  I did put some bacon crumbles and green onions on the top though for presentation.  This is one of our family's favorites and I'll take it to all future summer BBQs!!

This is the best potato salad ever.  I've found that people who think they don't like potato salad end up loving this recipe.  It's now become a staple for all my cookouts.   When I'm trying to whip this up quickly though, I tend to use a bag of real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon from scratch.  Taste the same either way.

HUB loved it because it had so much bacon in it. I used uncured no-sugar added bacon which tastes so much better than packaged bacon sold at grocery stores.  The uncured no-sugar added bacon flavor is really intense if you want to really kick it up.  I also added Celery Salt like I do to any cold salad to really keep it tasting even better. We will keep this outstanding recipe and continue to make it for many years.

I like the overall recipe. 2 cups of mayo was way too much!! I started with a cup and wish I could remove some of it. I would say 1/2 c to 3/4 c at the most.

Was a Memorial Day hit.  One person stated it may have needed a tad more salt but when you think about it most barbecue is already seasoned, so the potato salad added a refreshing change.

Very tasty.  A fresh approach to potato salad.  Will reduce mayo next time by 1/4 to 1/2 cup for better consistency and so it won't turn watery after several days in the refrigerator.

I've made this a dozen times.  People rave about it at parties and my wife who was not a potato salad fan frequently asks for it to be made.  

This is a recipe that can be made just as written and you'll have great success.

Ended up using 5 lbs potatoes, heavily salted water, so no additional needed, next time try 1.5 lbs bacon,  8 eggs. Don't use food processor to chop celery, too small. Didn't measure mayo, next time mix onion powder in with mayo first

I'm always looking for great recipes that I can prepare at home the day before and take to the boat and this one does that.  It  is a really great Potato Salad.  After reading reviews I made a few changes .... Used Green Onions as opposed to white onions.  Instead of two cups mayo, I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Besides those two changes, I kept it the same.  Very Good ~ Will make again.

Huge hit! Things I did different: carmelized the onions before adding them + mixed the egg yokes in with the mayo. My one criticism is that for my taste there was way too much mayo, so I would start with half and see if you want more.

I think this is a great starting point for Potato Salad. I made this, but I skipped the onion, added some paprika, garlic salt and pepper, and about 1/2  c of mustard and sour cream. I also chopped the potatoes before boiling, which I think gives them a  better texture and makes them cook faster. Over all tasty none the less.

We loved it!  I only changed: used 4 eggs, 1 cup mayo. 1 cup sour cream, poultry seasoning, pickled relish and 1/4 cup of dill pickles juice, paprika, mustard, and did not use celery. I can't tell you exact on the seasoning...just added to my liking. I used all other ingredients listed above. This one is a keeper!  Everyone at the party went for seconds!

Incredible!  The only thing I changed was omitting the celery since my family isn't a fan of the taste.  One that my husband asks me to make all the time and a regular dish to bring to potlucks and get togethers.

I was excited to make this since it got good reviews and I love potato salad but I was disappointed. It was just OK. It was kinda bland. The only thing that saved it was the bacon. I wouldn't make this again.

I cut the mayo in half and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I also only used 3 boiled eggs and green onions. All I could taste was the mayo, so I ended up adding garlic powder, dill, and way more salt than I'm comfortable with.

This creamy, delicious side dish was perfect. This recipe is simple enough to tweak it to your liking without making it more difficult. I'm not a fan of onions so I omitted them and added green onions as a topping for those that wanted some.

This was a super easy and super delicious potato salad!! I thought the measurements were spot on. I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup fat free plain Greek yogurt, and green onions. I will definitely make this again!! Made plenty for our family to have as a side dish for a couple of nights!

this is a good recipe! keep in mind though... the onions overpower the taste of everything else. I followed the recipe, tasted it, and would have enjoyed it more with half the amount of onions that are supposed to be added. aside from that, the recipe is fine.

Don't you love finding a recipe that other people ask you to share? This is a crowd pleaser. I use another reviewer's tip of substituting half of the mayo with sour cream. Delicious. Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I made it AS IS and give it 4 stars due to my OWN preference on the onions.. 

I changed the onion for all future makings of this to 1/2 cup green onions (white and green parts) and 1/3 cup Purple onion. I also only use 5 eggs. I also add more celery.  Again- just MY preference.  I am asked to bring this EVERY time it's pot luck. People dig it! 

PRO-TIPS for noobs:  Cut up the bacon into small pieces BEFORE cooking for crunchy bacon pieces.   Boil the potatoes whole until cooked, cool and the skin slides right off IF you don't want skins on. I cut them up while warm and add mayo, etc while warm.  Chill overnight if you can!

While the combination of ingredients was pretty good,  the cooking time for the potatoes turned mine into a "mashed potato salad." Oh well.

Let me start by saying this was my first attempt at potato salad ever so overall I call it a big win. However I have a list of things to revise for next time that I wanted to share. First, too much mayo in my opinion some have suggested splitting the mayo with miracle whip, in my family that's blasphemy, next time I'll use a cup and a half of Hellman's. Absolutely use a pound + of bacon I used about third quarters of a pound (all I had at he time) and it was really lacking. Finally, I'm going to follow some others suggestions and use green onions, that amount of white onion was a little over powering for some. Overall great recipe and hopefully the beginning a beautiful potato salad making life. Thanks for sharing!

This was the best potato salad I have ever made.  I doubled the potatoes to about 5 pounds. Cut them before boiling to roughly same size by quartering or halving. After boiled and cooled, placed on cookie sheet to drizzle with red wine vinegar and dill. Used two cups of lite mayo and one cup of lite sour cream which was plenty moist to me. Mixed most bacon in salad but reserved some for the top and ringed with sliced cherry and yellow tomatoes. Yum!

Good starter recipe. I boiled my potatoes in water that had 10 bouillon cubes. The potatoes absorb the flavour and add to the overall taste of the salad. Also, I only put in enough mayo to make it creamy, the amount called for is too much for me.

The only tweak this recipe needs is a good dose of Celery Salt - perfection.

This was great. Perfect egg to potatoe  ratio. I did use turkey bacon,  it's more lean, and I cooked well done used 1/4 of a red onion because I don't think I could handle too much onion flavor. Next time I will try green onions instead. This is a great recipe. It's a must try and I will make it again.

Excellent potato salad recipe. Considering how simple it is, I wasn't expecting it to be so flavorful. Bacon is truly the miracle ingredient!. You can use bacon bits, but I think using a quality bacon is what helps this so much. That said, if you don't eat it all in a day or two, some of the bacon may get a little soft and change that crunch factor a little. I didn't do it, but I might consider adding some sliced black olives next time but it doesn't "need" it.

I had never made potato salad before, this was amazing!  I normally don't even eat potato salad.  So good a hit with everyone.  I didn't add as much mayo and added some avocado...this is on the permanent list of foods!

Excellent recipe.I made it exactly as written the first time and everyone loved it.I always make the dressing separately so as not to risk breaking up the potatoes when mixing it and to get a smooth dressing.Next time I made it,I added 2 tsp of dry mustard to the dressing and halved the bacon( I thought a pound made the primary flavor too overwhelming)This tweaking was exactly what I wanted.

Wanted to try a potato salad with bacon, and it worked really well. BUT, I used Hormel REAL Bacon Bits ( I know, but they are so convenient and taste good, not like fake ones) just chopped a whole jar smaller and voila'!
This is very basic-tasting salad, I think for a little zing next time will add sweet-hot mustard to the mayo. I also added sweet mini chopped gherkins for sweetness, and red onion, as others did. Good base for a salad you can add your own touches to.

It was OK - I used 1/2 real mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Next time will use Miracle Whip to add more flavor. Also add celery seed.

I think the ratios are way off on this. There's no way I used 2 cups of mayo for 2 lbs. of potatoes or everything would have been swimming. I used about 1 1/4 cups and it was still wet. Good basic recipe other than that.

This recipe is a very good one for potato salad. The only ingredient that I added to give it some zing, was some yellow mustard.  Otherwise this is a very good potato salad recipe.

What an amazing recipe!  I haven't made potato salad in a long time so wanted an easy "refresher" recipe for a summer BBQ.  Instead of bacon, onion and mayo, I substituted turkey bacon and green onions, olive oil mayonnaise and only used 4 eggs.  Everyone at the BBQ raved about the salad!!  Definitely a keeper!

Modified it quite a bit for the second try. Reduced mayo to 1 cup and added 1/3 cup Sour cream and 3 tbsp yellow prepared mustard. Added 1 tsp  crushed rosemary,  1/2 tsp each of thyme leaves, dill, and ground cumin. 

Came out much better. The recipe as-is is a bit bland.

I ended up using only 1-1.25 cups mayo and thought that was plenty. Overall, a very tasty recipe!

This is a potato salad for everyone! I don't usually like potato salad, but this one is yummy. I've have several friends (also not fond of potato salad) ask for the recipe. I subbed Cajun seasoning for the salt and pepper.

I used this recipe for a friend's wedding to make potato salad for the first time in my life. People were RAVING about it! I made about 40 servings and by the end of the wedding it was gone. 

Only differences I did were instead of mayo, I used miracle whip and instead of onions, I used green onion for a bit of a crunch.

This wasn't the recipie I was looking for but it was close enough... I also added a half cup of shredded Asiago cheese, a quarter cup of crumbled grilled cheese (you can use same amount of white cheddar Cheeze-it Crackers). And instead of boiling the potatoes I tossed them in a little olive oil and salt and grilled them... Also for the dressing I added a tablespoon of white balsamic vinegar, a teaspoon of Wasabi paste, and a half teaspoon of siracha. Mmmm...

Absolutely delicious! I made a few minor changes... Used green onions and regular onion, threw in a handful of cheddar cheese, no celery, seasoned with cracked black pepper and seasoning salt, and 2 parts mayo, 1 part sour cream.  Mix it all together while potatoes are still warm. Soooo very delicious!!

I received nothing but compliments on this dish.  I increased the potatoes from 2# to 5# and left all the other ingredients the same.  In my opinion the increase would change the servings to 16 people or more.

I could only give 4 stars because I made a lot of changes that made it completely different.  By itself the recipe is great but I can't see a recipe and make a few twists.  I didn't use one full pound of bacon and like others needed more potatoes.  I added a tablespoon of worcestershire, 2 tablespoons sweet relish, 1/2 an onion, shallots, green onions, an extra celery stalk, and a teaspoon of hot sauce.  Turned out AMAZING!

I'd always been scared to make potato salad because I heard it was time consuming. This was very easy and so delicious! I followed other reviewers recommendations 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 sour cream, a few extra potatoes, sharp cheddar and green onions. I mixed the miracle whip and sour cream with garlic powder, pepper and parsley and let it sit overnight for a little extra flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

Good.  Worth trying out with about 3 tbsps. of lemon juice.  Optionally, sprinkle either condensed milk or sugar/syrup.  If you don't like eggs, try cubed apples, or even pineapple chunks.

it's so good & better than buying potatoes salad at the deli with very little amount for $8.00 !!! I will be making many of those over the summer.... & if you don't have green onions, I'd sautéed the onion with olive oil... :)

Used russets (red potatoes next time) and cubed and boiled them for 15 minutes. Used miracle whip light instead of mayo and halved.  Added a little yellow mustard, but would be good without. Also less bacon, more celery.

Great recipe! I think the first time I made it I didn't have everything so I deviated a lot. This time making it the only thingI did ddifferent was to add some of the bacon grease in, and used green onions.  It worked well and I will def try it without any changes, sorry.

Just made this  and it was the best potato salad I have ever made.  I had to adjust the measurements of each ingredient and I used the baby red potatoes which worked very well.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was great!  I cut the potatoes before boiling, and tossed them with the other ingredients while they were still warm.  I did not use any hard boiled eggs, since I do not like them at all, and I halved the mayo.  Even with half the mayo, it was plenty creamy.  By using pre-chopped celery, and crumbled bacon from my grocery store's salad bar, I saved extra time as well!

This was wonderful.  I doubled the amount of potatoes but kept all other measurements the same, and there was still a little too much dressing.  I also used half sour cream, half mayo, and added a little ground mustard.  I don't usually enjoy potato salad, but this is a serious exception.  Thanks for sharing!

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would! Amazing! I followed it exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. My boyfriend is a hardcore potato salad junkie and is VERY particular about the ratios between mayo, potato, egg, and crunch. Every time he grabs some from the fridge he has to comment on how unique and utterly delicious it is, which makes me quite happy. Lots of prep time is totally worth it for such a scrumptious salad! :) PS. The bacon has stayed pretty crisp after a few days in the fridge!

Okay... so I changed a lot on the recipe, but it turned out wonderful! This was the first Potato salad I've made myself and needed a "base" to work with and this recipe fit the bill. I used 2 lbs potatoes, 4 hard-boiled eggs, 2 1/2 pickles diced, cocktail wieners sauteed in a homemade sweet BBQ sauce then diced, 2-4 tsp of Cholula hot sauce, 2-3 tbsp lemon juice, 4 pinches of dill weed, 8 oz of cream cheese, 1 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup ranch dressing.  WOW!! This will be something I make for every kind of occasion. Especially if I'm looking to impress! ;)

I'm a big fan of red skinned tater salad. Just wish my husband was. He's not that fond of skins in his potato salad.

I have made this recipe a ton and it is by far my favorite!!!  I always add a can or two of already chopped olives, a few pickles and a squirt or two of mustard.  I also sprinkle some paprika on it when its all done and its delicious.  I have had tons of people ask for the recipe!

I like to use this recipe as a base to add more ingredients. I can't believe this potato salad didn't call for any Dijon mustard or paprika. Those two things make an average potato salad into something so much more flavorful! I added these extra ingredients according to taste as well as some chopped pickles.

This is a good recipe, and red potatoes work better than the standard baking potatoes I think. I did make some changes. I used only 1/2 lb of bacon to cut out some of the fat and sodium, and only 3 eggs instead of 6. I used chopped green onion instead of standard white onion. Then I also added 1/2 cup of chopped dill pickle and half a cup of shredded lowfat Sargento 3-cheese mix. Finally, instead of mayo (which I don't particularly like) I used a cup of lite ranch dressing, which adds a whole different dimension to the flavor.

I used this as a basis for my own healthier version of potato salad. I used one cup mayo instead of two and used 4 egg whites (even 6 egg whites seemed too "egg-y" for my crew). To keep the salad moist without adding extra fat, I added about a quarter cup pickle juice and about 2 tablespoons mustard. I also upped the veggies by using 3 stalks celery and 1 shredded carrot. The texture was great and had a nice crunch.

AMAZING!!! However I did use miracle whip lite in place of mayo. I have had potato salad twice in my life and my boyfriend asked me to make him some. I made this for him and it smelled and looked delicious so I tried a bite...one turned 10!! This has to be the best potato salad I have ever had and will only eat, he loves potato salad and says it is the best ever....later that evening at bed time he said he can't wait for tomorrow so he can have some potato salad..well worth it! Thanks!

Great recipe! Even those that aren't typically potato salad people couldn't get enough. Didn't change a thing and didnt need to! Edit - I have made this a number of times and my large family loves it. I do find that I use about half the mayo from the recipe...just start there and add if you like more. :) delish! They fight for leftovers!

Awesome! Not too difficult, and not to much mayo either, which I was worried about. Served it with pulled pork (another allrecipes recipe) and corn for a dinner party, and got a ton of compliments!

Very bland as written. Added 1 1/2 Tbsp dried dill, 1 tsp paprika, 2 Tbsp yellow mustard, 1/2 C sweet pickle relish, 2 tsp sriracha, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 tsp worcestershire sauce . Double the celery.  Absolutely phenomenal with changes.

I'll use this as a good start. Way too bland for me, but something I can use to get creative with. I think it needs more flavor and some kind of acid.

Love this recipe. I did change a couple of things. I didn't use celery, as I don't care for it. And I added in some cheese and some brown mustard. Brought this to a bar-b-q a couple of weeks ago and got a lot of compliments.

I followed the proportions, per the recipe and it came out perfect! My regular family recipe uses mayo, and in place of bacon we use pickle. I LOVE this recipe!! Use all the mayo, if you are a mayo fan, because, as you mix it, it becomes creamy from the breakdown of the potatoes, which should be tender enough that they slip off a fork easily when pierced. I didn't chill the potatoes or eggs, but when they were about room-temperature, i mixed everything together. I sprinkled a little smoked paprika on top as decoration. THANKS for a GREAT potato salad recipe!! This is definitely a keeper!! :)

OMG!!  Finally a potato salad that my husband likes!  I did omit the celery (since hubby doesn't like it) and use more potatoes, but other than that pretty much followed the recipe.  A bit time consuming, but soooo worth it.  The whole family loved it!

My husband and I loved this potato salad!! We cooked the bacon so that it was nice and crispy, and the cucumbers coupled with the bacon gave it a nice crunch. We used more red skin potatoes because I'm not a huge mayo fan, and it turned out nicely!! Enjoy!

I'm very picky about potato salad and this recipe is great. I used red onion and added a dash of Mrs Dash, Italian seasoning, chopped black olives and some spicy deli mustard for an extra zing.

This is basically the recipe I've always used for potato salad.  No onions, I can't eat them and I usually do as others have said and use a blend of sour cream and mayo, which hubby and I prefer. Just realized I usually put in a little prepared  mustard and left it out per the recipe. Boy, did my hubby like the changes of no mustard and BACON!  Will definitely make this slight but significant change very often!

This recipe is terrific! I took it to a party yesterday and everyone was raving about it. I shoud have cubed the potatoes beore boiling.. I will do this next time. I added a few extra potatoes and cut out one egg. I also added a little bit of steak seasoning for flavor... but, not too much - maybe 1/4-1/2 tsp. This is a new staple for pot lucks!

Yes, I agree this is an excellent recipe! However, I was always under the impression "1 stalk of celery" was the whole stalk. 1 "branch" of celery was one piece of the stalk. Makes more sense that way I think.

Fabulous!  The second time I cubed the potatoes and steamed them to short cut a little and - because of my son - I added a wee bit of spicy brown mustard.  Good as original with a twist.

I have made this recipe (minus the bacon) for years. My husband thinks it's the best.  Next time I will add bacon.  I usually buy the small red potatoes and add some dill. Thanks for the new twist.

Yummy potato salad! I used half mayo and half sour cream and added a bit of Old Bay seasoning for extra kick, and used turkey bacon as I don't eat pork. It is really good stuff! I also cut the recipe in half - there is only two of us so I didn't need so much. I will definitely make this again for next year's family reunion!

Was a hit at Easter, make sure and salt the water liberally with Kosher salt and add 3-4 crushed cloves of garlic.  I only used 2/3 of the amount of mayo I'll try the olive oil mayo next time - simple and very good!

Love this recipe. I have made it 3 times altering it slightly. I reduced the mayo to about 1 cup,  adding a 
tablespoon Dijon mustard and using some miracle whip. I also marinade the celery, 3 stalks and red onion in red wine vinegar. This gives it more crunch with a little acidic bite. I use 5 pieces of good bacon mixing three in and adding the other to the top so it stays crunchY. I get nothing but rave reviews.

This definitely tastes better after the flavors have had time to meld. On day 1, I would have given it 3.5 stars. From day 2 onward, I would rate it 4 stars.

I have made this dish several times.  The only changes I made were to use green onion instead of regular (always preferred in my house) and to add a little extra bacon (never a problem).  I've never made this dish w/o people asking for the recipe.  I would recommend making several hours ahead of time so that it has time to chill in the fridge.  It gives the ingredients time to meld and it tastes better cold.  If I could give this more stars I would.

It only got a four because I had to alter the ingredients. Instead of 2 cups of mayo I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also add 1 Tbsp malt vinegar and use chives instead of onion. I did make it once according to the recipe and found there was too much mayo for the amount of potatoes and other ingedients. But it wasn't a bad recipe, just not to my taste :-)

I don't like potato salad and my son doesn't even like potatoes so I just whipped up a batch for my husband... DELICIOUS! Even DS loved it. DH went to work and boasted about it and commited me to making three more batches for his parents and some clients. I had to make another batch as soon as the first one was gone, which was no time at all. Both times I made this, I used less mayo and the second time around, I added small cubes of cheddar cheese which I think did actually make it a little better. So good! Will never, ever need another potato salad recipe.

Used extra potatoes and celery, and there was still too much mayo.  Subbed a bit of miracle whip for a bit of the mayo, added a squirt of mustard and a bit of pickle relish and dill weed.  Good starting point, but the proportions are off as written here. Recommend that you start with about half the sauce, and then stir/add more as you need it.  As written here, it comes out very sloshy.

This is my go to potato salad recipe!  Even though it's February, I decided to do a summery meal last night and made this with pulled pork sandwiches.  My boyfriend suggested I add bleu cheese crumbles to the potato salad this time and boy that is a nice addition if you like bleu cheese!  I think I probably only used 1/4 cup since it's such a pungent flavor, but will be adding it again from time to time!

OMG this is delicious!!!!!  I made this for my in-laws and we were all in LOVE with this potato salad.  This was my first time ever making homemade potato salad and it was easy and the end result was way better than anything you would get in the store.  The bacon is the perfect touch!!!

I doubled this recipe (with the exception of the onion) and took half to my office party and left half at home with the family.  There were no leftovers from either place and I received many requests for the recipe.  Very easy with a great flavor.  I used a tip from a co-worker to cook the bacon ... place the entire pound on a foil-lined jelly roll pan, bake for one hour at 350 degrees, turning the bacon over at the half hour.  It was a great time saver and clean up was a snap.

Loved this tasty homemade potato salad recipe although I did make a few changes.  I used more celery - 4 smaller stalks diced very small to add more crunch to the potato salad.  I also added the cooked potatoes (after rinsing with cold water) directly to the mixture -- I find that the flavors just blend together so lovely when it's slightly warm.  Additionally, I used a few more potatoes than the recipe called for.  I would think that with only 2 pounds of potatoes to 2 cups of mayo would be a bit too much mayo for my taste.  I used more along the lines of 3 1/2 to 4 lbs. of potatoes and added 1 additional cooked egg.  Wonderfully tasty and so very easy to make!

This is now my standard go-to potato salad recipes.  It gets requested year-round, not just for summer BBQs.  I use 5 lbs of potatoes, leave out the eggs, and add celery seed and garlic powder.

I believe that the world is a better place with bacon so this recipe was right up my alley.   It is absolutely delicious as the smokey flavor comes out in every bite.  I added a couple of tablespoons of spicy mustard to give it an added kick.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the recipe w/ 5 lbs of potatos and made the following changes:
1/2 Mayo 1/2 Sour Cream, Green Onion instead of regular onion, added Shredded Cheddar Cheese.  I got a lot of compliments on it and a request for the recipe.  I think others liked it better than I did, though.  I think I prefer old fashioned potato salad.  I will probably make this again, at the request of my family and friend.

This is the most simple recipe but yet it's the best potato salad I ever had! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I made it for a birthday cookout and everyone raved about it. So now it's requested that I make the potato salad from now on!

This is a great potato salad, but I only gave 4 stars due to the ingredient ratios. I used 5lbs of potatoes to the listed ingredients, which came out wonderful. I can't imagine how mayonisey and eggy it would be if I hadn't done this. It was perfectly sticky, and I received tons of compliments. I used 1/2 white onion and 5 stalks of green onions. I also sprinkled with cheddar cheese.

I have never made potato salad before, but this was good and really easy. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and used green onions and 1/2 Miracle Whip 1/2 sour cream. I also used turkey bacon, as that's what we use, using about half a pound. I also did not follow the directions given for cooking the eggs, as that resulted in underdone eggs. I followed my Joy of Cooking's directions for hard boiled eggs.

I have gotten so many compliments on this dish- it is the greatest potato salad I've ever had. Leaving the skins on the red potatoes adds it's own special dimension. Thank you Donna!

Just finished making this recipe and my entire family happily approves.  Two things I did differently were that I substituted garlic chives for the onion and thinly sliced chopped ham for the half of the bacon.  We love bacon but I wanted a little less of the cholesterol especially since there's a significant amount of eggs in it.  Still tastes great, better than the red potato salad from Costco that my kids love.  Thanks for sharing such a terrific recipe.

Fantastic potato salad! I didn't use red potatoes though. I also put seasoned salt and garlic salt in place instead of the salt and pepper. Deliciousness. I might say its better than my secret family recipe potato salad.

I made this recipe for friends we had over for dinner.  The husband said it was the best potato salad he had ever had.....and I agree, it was amazing!  Only changes I made were I substituted half of the mayo for sour cream and used turkey bacon (just make sure you really crisp it up)

this was excellent!  I used what I had left over in the kitchen, so I used sausage instead of bacon and green onion rather than onion.  I also used less eggs and less mayo.  Very delicious and the 2 men I live with absolutely ate it up!

This is just like my mom used to make.  I added celery seed and some dill pickles, just because I like the taste of them.  It's delish and perfect for summer gatherings! Thanks for sharing.

I made this using only half an onion as another reviewer suggested.  I couldn't taste much onion so next time I would add in more but not quite a whole onion.  I also used 1 cup plain greek yogurt in place of the mayo and didn't notice a difference.  The whole thing came out bland, maybe because I only had half a pound of bacon on hand.  It does get soggy so it helps to crumble it really small as another reviewer recommended. I also added garlic powder, dried dill and chives.  Turned out to be a wonderful salad.

My husband gives this 5 stars, and he is the potato salad lover, but I would only give 4 stars.  I lightened it up with nonfat plain yogurt instead of mayo and used turkey bacon.  Still a very hearty potato salad, and he said the recipe is a keeper! I am just not a big potato salad person, I guess.

Made this today for our July 4th dinner. It was a hit. Fairly easy to make and put together. I think next time I make it I will cut back on the mayo. A little too creamy for me but, still, the taste was fantastic. Reminded me of salads my mom made when I was a kid.

Yum! I made it as-is with just a few modifications. It was perfect without any changes, but I decided to experiment. My changes were a combination of potatoes (red, blue, regular/white), red onion, and adding 2 tbsp of Dijon mustard. Fantastic.

Bacon makes it good... :) Great recipe for a classic potato salad. Rave reviews from friends at a cookout. I used 1/2 the amount of bacon and it was just enough. But more bacon is better I expect.

USE HELLMAN'S REAL MAYONNAISE AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.  If you want to lighten up the recipe, use half Hellman's Mayonnaise/half sour cream & chives.  I've also used green onions instead of regular.  Delicious!

Let's get this straight; I'm not at ALL a fan of Potato Salad.  It's something I skip at every BBQ get-together all summer long...but after reading through this recipe and remembering that bacon makes everything better--I decided to give it a shot.  TOTAL SUCCESS.  

I'm a "taste and add" type cook so I fudged a few things here and there (less mayo / fat free sour cream / plain yogurt) and added some additional Salad Supreme seasoning.  I also only added the yolk from two of the eggs (I think too much is overwhelming)--it was DELICIOUS.  

This salad does taste like it came from a gourmet deli.  It definitely needs the whole pound of VERY CRISP bacon (I ended up cooking the other 1/2 of the package after tasting)--and is even better the second day.  Also good with shredded carrot added!

Would make again!

This is a great, basic potato salad.  The bacon is a nice touch!   I too cut the potatoes into bite size chunks and boil for only 6 or 7 minutes.   I've been using a very similar recipe for many years and the only difference is, after draining the potatoes and cooling slightly, add of 1/2 cup of zesty italian salad dressing to the still warm potatoes, then put them in the fridge to cool completely before adding the other ingredients.  The dressing soaks into the potatoes and gives it a nice zest.

I've been looking for an easy but full of flavor potato salad recipe and this is it!!  I saw the ingredient list and thought 'this potato salad doesn't have much to it...I bet it isn't too great'.  I read the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it and I'm SO glad I did!  I took it to a church potluck and the bowl was empty in no time and people were asking me for the recipe!  Great job!!!!

My husband wanted to make a traditional potato salad.  This recipe was his first time making potatoe salad and it came out wonderful. 

He received the ultimate compliment for a cook.  People kept coming back for more and complained when it was gone

This is a great recipe for potato salad but I did substitute some of the ingredients. I didn't put any onion or celery, instead I used fresh chives. For the bacon I used Boar's Head bacon (this really does have a different taste than other bacon) and I added small blocks of sharp cheddar cheese. Also, I thought using 2 cups of mayo was a bit much so I used 1 1/4- 1 1/3 cup. I used Pink Himalayan Sea Salt, a tiny bit of fresh ground pepper, and paparika (according to your taste). Came out devine! My friends and family ate all 2lbs and that's a LOT of potato!

I don't eat potato salad, something to do with cold potatoes and mayo - but I was going to a party and was asked to bring some. Made this, it was unbelievable, it was all I could do to get it to the party, I kept sneaking tastes. I guess I do like potato salad after all.

In my opinion, it was way too mayonnaisey and oniony. My husband loved it that way and apparently most of the people at our BBQ thought it was good too. I would cut down on the mayo by at least a half a cup. Apple cider vinegar should be added to the potatoes right after cooking. Dry mustard is another thing I would like for more flavor. Also there is too much egg. The amount should be cut in half.

DELICIOUS! This was a hit at my cookout this past weekend. I used Hellman's for my mayo. I followed the recipe exactly as is and this turned out perfect. The bacon and eggs really added a ton of flavor. No leftovers at all. Two thumbs up!!!

I was looking for a new potato salad to make for dinner tonight and stumbled on this one and due to the number of positive reviews, decided to try it.  I made it as listed with only one small change...I had some fresh dill that I needed to use up so I threw some of that in.  After I made it, I gave it the taste test and said "WOW!" to myself, put it in the fridge to meld the flavors and wait for dinner.  My son and daughter in law were here and when they took their first bite, my son said "This is the BEST potato salad I have EVER eaten, and I am NOT kidding!"  His wife said the same.  And then there was my picky husband who said "This really IS the best potato salad I have ever eaten!"  I think the bacon is the secret ingrediant...I have never put bacon in potato salad before.  If you are looking for a potato salad that will "WOW" your guests or family, this will do it...I promise!  :D

FINALLY! I have been making different potato salad recipes for years and have never been satisfied. But this one is the only one I will make from now on. It was simple and delicious, everyone loved it! The bacon was a nice touch, like a little crunchy surprise.

I am rating this 5 stars because what I ended up with was awesome and I am sure if I was able to follow the recipe completely it would have been perfect. I was short on supplies so I had to cut the egg portion in half, I was short 1/3 the amount of bacon and had no celery. What I did to offset this was increased the potatoes and added a tbsp on celery seed. It turned out great even though I was short on ingredients but was a pain in the butt to make. To make your bacon crispier place them on a baking sheet in the oven.

I did a bag of real bacon (the large crumbles for cooking) and omitted the celery and onion in favor of chopped green onion. I also added a half cup of honey mustard. It was delicious. My husband LOVED it. Will make this one again!

This is an awesome recipe.  Served it at my daughters first birthday party and people couldnt beleive it was home made.  I did put in extra hardboiled eggs, 10 instead of 6, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.

FABULOUS potatoe salad. I added what others' recommended, more potatoes, less dressing and make dressing 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. I doubled the potatoes without adding more dressing. Added 1/2 c sliced black olives. Added 1 TBSP dijon mustard and 2 TBSP sweet relish, did lightly cover the cooked potatoes in red wine vinegar and freshly diced dill. Added the bacon (reduced to 12 ounces here) just before serving the salad. Used celery salt and lemon pepper. AWESOME potatoe salad.

Best I've ever had.  Used 37oz potato instead of 32 - was still perfectly creamy.  Used red onion.  Bacon added all the saltiness that was needed.  Truly spectacular - can't wait to see my guests' reactions!

I use this recipe all the time now, but I marinate the potatoes overnight. I use 1 cup white wine vinegar, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil in microwave or stove, mix to dissolve sugar and pour over cut hot potatoes. Refridgerate overnight and drain before adding remaining ingredients.

This took me a little more time than advertised, but then I cooked 5 pounds of red potatoes.  I used green onion and added about three table spoons of dijon mustard.  I also cut the potatoes before boiling.  It still took 15 mins to boil them.  Next time, I will let the eggs boil another three minutes or so because the shells did not separate very well.  Excellent recipe!  It's a keeper!

I thought this potato salad was very simple and easy to make, however, I added mustard (wholegrain) to my mayonnaise and it added that extra kick! Plus, for those of my family who do not particularly like celery, I used celery salt.

My favorite potato salad recipe. My only embellishment: I add a bit of Dijon mustard, proportionately reducing the Miracle Whip (instead of mayo), and I think it's tastier than pickles, etc. Terrific and so easy.

This sounds a lot like my salad (from my Mom of course), but we also include pickles, sliced green and black olives, pickle juice and some mustard.  Always good and never fails to please.  Give it a try!

This is something like the one that I always make except that I add a small amount of mustard and a taste of sugar and a sprinkle of vinegar  (or pickle juice) to the mayo.  Gives it a little zip.  Only thing is....everyone always gets me to make it for the family get togethers.

I have been making this recipe forever and it is great and always a winner.  I do not use the celery due to personal taste but I do use Hellmans Mayo, the only one for this recipe.  Great potatoe salad

Great potato salad. Only changes I make are:
Use green onion instead of regular. Use 2 (or maybe even 3) stalks of celery. Instead of all mayo, use 1/2 c. miracle whip.. and even add a little mustard.

This recipe was aweseome and really easy. I used green onion in place of the onion as well as mini purple potatoes and mini idaho potatoes. This dish was colorful and addcting. Couldn't put the fork down!! Perfect to bring to a cookout. WILL make again.

This is the best potato salad I have ever had....I've made it twice in the last week!!!  I don't think I'll ever go back to the old standby with mayo, mustard, pickles....Made it right by the recipes...:-)

This is the best potato salad I've had.  It's a staple at our cookouts and I always get huge compliments when I bring this to a get-together (I never have any left no matter how much I make!).  I'm not a fan of mustard at all and this is a refreshing version full of all the good stuff.  This is much better the next day.  Enjoy!!

I made this for a picnic yesterday and received a unbelievable number of comliments on it. It was delicious! I substituted green onions and used a 12 oz. package of bacon rather than a full pound. Excellent!

Love this potato salad!  The crispness of the celery and onions, the firm red potatoes, and the BACON make this delicious.  I added dill weed for an extra zip, and sprinkled a bit of paprika over the top to pretty it up.  Good stuff!

Very good dish. First time i have ever made a tater salad and wow, very easy. I took the advice of other chefs and used the green onions. Also used tbsp of low fat mayo and a tbsp of low fat miracle whip with sour cream. Awseome stuff, just like baked potato salad. It's chillin in the fridge as i type this and gonna top with shredded cheese for dinner.

I just did a small test run on this because I'm making a TON of potato salad for a baby shower this weekend.  It was delicious!  So I've found the recipe I'll use!  SO glad to find one that I feel confident to share with a bunch of other women whom I consider to be great cooks!  I did use green onion instead of regular onion because I have a weakness for green onion...but the green added some nice color into it and tasted wonderful!

Love this potato salad. I did not have any celery and I am sure it adds something, but was fine without. I used a medley of red, purple and yellow potatos. I am not a potato salad fan but his one is a winner. Yeah!!

This is a WONDERFUL red skinned potato salad recipe.  It is very easy to make - if you are new to cooking, this would be a great recipe for you to bring to a BBQ as a side dish and amaze everyone with your cooking skills!  : )  Follow this recipe to a "T", you honestly cannot go wrong.  I omit the bacon only because everyone I know is vegetarian!  : )

Excellent! My dressing has one T dijon, 1 t. worchestershire and 1/4 t. tabasco added to the 2 cups of mayo. Gives it just the right kick! I sometimes put in dill pickles or shredded cheese.

Very good! I subbed one cup of ranch for the mayo and used green onions instead of regular. I didn't cook the potatoes long enough but that was my fault!!!

Great potato salad! The crumbled bacon was a great addition. I was limited on time so I bought the microwave bacon and it worked perfectly. I also I diced the potato ahead of time and cooked it a little less so it still held its firmness. Definitely keeping this recipe!

I have been making this recipe since last year( when I first found it) It is by far the best I've had. My family goes crazy over it .I don't like onions, but I cut the celery and the onion so small, you won't bite into a hard pieces of them. But instead of cutting by hand, i put the onion and celery in the blender, also works with the bacon. This saves a lot of time with the prep. Just don't blend to much!

THIS IS THE GREATEST POTATO SALAD EVAH. Seriously, I've made this recipe three or four times , and I still love it. If you're short on ingredients, you can always omit the celery or the eggs, and it still tastes amazing.

SO DELICIOUS!!! I made this for a 4th of July party and I can't tell you how many compliments I received. It's perfect because it's really simple to make... I cut down some time by using REAL (emphasis on real) bacon bits and it still came out amazing. Will make again!

I have made and reviewed this twice, and I have found both times it being too oniony. The first time I followed it exactly. The second time, I used all of the ingredients, but added them to taste. This time, I only used about 1/4 of onion and it was still too much, taste wise. It is very dominant.

Very good, I added tbs of dill pickle relish, 2 tbs mustard and cut the mayo to 1 cup.  Came out perfect!  I also cubed the potatoes before cooking.

YUM! MAde this last night for 4th July BBQ.  Really great. I think the red skinned potatoes make a difference. I use organic b/c I think they taste better.  I used bac'n bits b/c I hate cooking bacon. I used a little less mayo and added Grey Poupon.  I substituted onion powder for fresh b/c I don't like overpowering onion taste or the bitterness of raw onions.  Also reduced eggs to 2.  YUM YUM love this.

Great recipe!!! Family loved it! The only things I changed was, I used scallions in place of white onions and I always replace half the mayonnaise with ranch salad dressing in my potato salads! Mmmmm.....Yummy

I'm not known for my cooking skills, but this recipe changed my reputation when I made it for a picnic with friends today!  Really delicious with lots of flavor.  I substituted turkey bacon and used light mayo.  Glad to finally have a good potato salad recipe in my back pocket.

I've made this twice: exactly as the recipe states and with the following adjustments, per my personal taste. Both versions were excellent and family & friends loved them!  Cut mayo to 1.5 cups / substitute green onion for white onion / add 1/8 tsp. of white pepper

This was a great salad...Different from the norm. I loved the bacon and red potatoes.. I used green onions in this and the flavor was terrrific. I always go half and half on mayo and salad dressing. I think mayo makes it too bland. Mixing in the salad dressing (mircle whip) makes it a little more zippy and flavorful.. Great recipe and will make this again. Im sure I will have too by the way the husband ate it up!

So good! I made this salad using turkey bacon and olive oil mayo and subbed green onion for the regular and it came out great. Everyone at my BBQ loved it and one guy even made sure we weren't putting it away too early.  I know, I'm kinda rating a different recipe since I tweaked it, but it was still great!

Wow great recipe but I tweaked mine a bit. I added a tablespoon of garlic. When it called for 2 cups of mayo, I did one cup of mayo and one cup of miracle whip. I also took the celery out because my family doesn't like the crunch in their potato salad, so I substituted a teaspoon of celery salt. The family just raved about it.

I did like this recipe and only gave it 4 stars, as I changed a few things.  I've been looking for an easy potato salad recipe and I had some red potatoes to use.  I made some slight changes.  I used about 1 lb of poatoes, so I halved the other ingredients and eye balled some.  I do not like my potato salad really creamy, so I used about 1/2 cup of mayo and it was fine.  I thought the idea of just mayo seemed bland, so I added a splash (about a 1T) of white wine vinegar.  I also did not have bacon, so I substitued pancetta, which I always have in my freezer.  The pancetta added a wonderful flavor to it.  I also used scallions, rather than onion, as others have.  I prefer that flavor and it adds some color.  I also added paprika, a little garlic and onion powder (not salt).  A good base recipe that can easily be tweeked and changed to taste.

This is great! I served it at a large BBQ last year and everybody liked it, some have even requested it later. I used one of the tips and made one with half mayo, half sour cream and one with only mayo. Both were equally good. Neither me nor my guests could pick a favorite. The bacon gives it an interesting touch, but remember not to put it in till right before serving it, or it might get soggy.

I added yellow mustard, as I do with my own potato salad recipe.  It adds a tang.  The raves were endless - everyone loved this recipe!

Everytime I have made this, I'm always asked for the recipe! This is by far the best potato salad I've ever had! I add ranch dressing and shredded cheddar cheese to put this over the top!

Super yummy!  I use miracle whip instead of mayo out of personal preference.  It turns out great everytime and looks pretty with all the colors.

I guess I must be a potato salad purist because I don't care for bacon in mine.  I also like fresh dill, a bit of mustard and I use green onions, not white or yellow.  Also, you have to have pickle in it!  I like my dressing a bit thinner than mayo on its own, so I thin mine down with a quarter cup of milk and add a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, along with a TBS of sugar, mixed in the mayo and milk.  It gives the salad a great "tang" that seems to be missing from this salad.  Overall, it was rather bland tasting, but better if you spruce it up with some flavor.

This recipe turned out really well and everyone enjoyed it! I just chopped up a green bell pepper and added it to get it some more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I did not as as much bacon or mayo as called for, and it still turned out great... I made it for a party, and I have already been asked to make it again!

Fantastic potato salad.  Second only to my 'famous' potato salad I have made for 50+ years, using all purpose potatoes.  I can't wait to try it out on my 'adult' children.  Small Red potatoes was all I had, so I gave this a try.  I scaled it down to serve 4.  It's only me and my hubby so we had leftovers.  Delicious.  I certainly will be making this again and I highly recommend it.  D'nini

I usually make my mom's potato salad (which, by the way, is wonderful), but I was looking for something different this time.    After making this, I'm now converted and will never use another potato salad recipe.  This was most excellent, the flavors were perfect.  I loved that I didn't have to peel any potatoes, and the addition of bacon was divine.

I haven't tasted all the potato salad recipes in the world but I've had a few. This was hands down the best. I'll be hard pressed to try another. I didn't change a thing and probably won't for the next fifty times I make this.

Enjoyable potato salad!!!  Made it for a dinner party and it was a hit!!  However, I finished it off with crumbles of bleu cheese and omitted the salt and pepper. It also makes great leftovers, and so enjoyable on the palate.

This was an excellent recipe-- used part sour cream/part mayo, and added green onions instead of regular.  I'd definitely increase the celery next time for some extra crunch.

This is a wonderful, flavorful potato salad. The change I made was I sauteed the onion and celery and then added it to the salad. Then chill. Perfection!

I love this! It's great alternative to the standard potato salad. I usually use microwave bacon it tends to get very crispy and crumbles easy. In a pinch, I use Bacon Bits...tastes great too.  I try to make this as directed, but you can easily change this recipe to reflect your taste.  Adding paprika, a dash of chili pepper, and some red pepper flakes adds a nice kick for those who like it.  Great recipe!

I made this for the first time yesterday, and my husband declared it the best potato salad he's ever eaten. Except for using green onions I didn't change a thing. It is time consuming, but worth every minute. Expect rave reviews from everyone you serve this to.

I was looking for a great potato salad for the crowd at work, who of course are mostly wonderful cooks. This potato salad went over fabulously; it actually inspired one of the senior members of the team to wax philosophic about the proper potatos for a salad and why this recipe was such a great example of the perfect potato salad! You know it's good when people are driven to poetry! :-) I also substituted green onions, about 7 or 8. And I added a scant Tbsp of vinegar sprinkled over the potatos before adding the mayo. Two weeks later people are still talking about it!

This was my first attempt at potato salad, and it was a hit. Using the red potatoes saved time, and gave a nice color to the salad. The only thing I changed was replacing the onion with a few scallions.  It had a milder oniony flavor. My family is already asking for another batch!

This was SO good - only thing that I changed in the recipe was the bacon - I used a bottle of the real bacon bits.

This is known at our parties as my famous potato salad.  Even though I have made only twice and everyone loves it.  For consistancy in flavors I buy the pre-cooked bacon bits.

This dish was awesome! Everyone loved it at the potluck i brought it to.  The only change i made was using less mayo than the recipe asked for.  We didn't want it to be too rich, and it turned out fine.  This will be the only potato salad recipe i use from now on!

Such good potato salad  -- and down here in the south, we're used to the good stuff!  My husband said this was better than any restaurant -- and that is saying alot!  I used onion - and not as much bacon.  I also did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream - but I don't think that made that much difference.

This was really good. I did increase the amount of potatoes to almost double, to make more for a family gathering. I increased the mayo and added a little milk to thin and get it to stretch. I also put extra bacon on the top as a garnish.

This is the first, and only, potato salad I ever made, and now I have made it dozens of times.  I absolutely love it and I never come home with leftovers when I bring it to a picnic!  Here are the changes I like to make: 1)I use half fat free sour cream and half low fat mayo instead of all mayo (You can't tell the difference, trust me-just healthier!) 2)green onion instead of the regular kind 3)I like to season it with ranch dressing powder, gives it the best flavor ever, I don't even use salt or pepper...yummy, I made it last night for a picnic today - tastes so much better the next day!!  Some time I will try it with cheddar cheese crumbles instead of egg, with all my other changes...Try this recipe, so worth the effort!

My father gave this recipe to one of my classmate's mothers on the day I graduated from Delaware Valley Academy; and she was VERY excited to get it. the only difference in her recipe and my grandmother's (& my great grand father Ortlip's) was these steps:    1lb. bacon [fozen, cut into cubes, then cooked and then cooked to crisp... (Oscar Mayer) Lean Bacon]... 1 dozen eggs  [boiled & cooled in fridge overnight (in shell)]... 2 stalks celery, minced... 10 lb. red skin pot's [boiled & cooled in fridge overnight]... 1 lg. minced onion... celery seed, salt & pepper (to taste)... Qt of (Hellman's) Mayonaise... and he would mix it with his hands (thoroughly cleansed, of course) *I give great-grandad's version six stars*

This is good, but I think is too bland for my taste. I added paprika, cayenne pepper, and chili powder which seemed to give it more of a pop, but even then it still wasn't 5 star worthy.  I will make again though so I can hopefully, make this a 5 star recipe.

From what I got to taste of this salad it was great. Since I live in a house with 8 guys the double batch I made lasted about 5 minutes before it was devoured. Ive been asked to make it again about a million times so Id say its a keeper for sure. Definatly a hit with hungry boys

The bacon makes this great! If you are not a bacon lover, don't bother. Leaving the skin on gives it a nice texture.  A real keeper.

Yum! Very good, simple potato salad recipe. I used half green onions, half sweet yellow onions. I decreased the mayonnaise to half, because we're not big on 'saucy' dishes.

This potato salad is wonderful. I have made it many times in the past and everytime I am so impressed I feel as though I must write a review, I am finally getting around to it!  The only things I change are that I bake the bacon on a broiler pan in the oven (400 degrees 17-20 mins) so this way I can have the eggs and the potatoes going all at the same time on my tiny stove.  I also omit the celery, do the 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream suggestion, and I also chop fresh dill throughout the salad.  The fresh herb flavor and bright green coloring really adds a lot to the dish.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I am sure this is fantastic as is, too. I, however, added a few things. Garlic Powder, Green Onions, Splash of vinegar, and Sour cream. THIS IS THE BEST POTATO SALAD EVER!!!! Everyone raves about it every time I make it. Delish!

I've made this a million times now.  Always a hit.  Of course I tweak a bit:  3 pounds of potato, maybe only 1/2 lb of bacon -- however much I have.  Red or green onions instead of white.  Shallots are good too.  And instead of just mayo, I mix about 3 to 1 mayo and ranch dressing.  Bacon ranch is even better.  This recipe is great even as written.  Thanks for sharing!

I also made just a couple of changes to the recipe.  I used half mayo and half sour cream.  I also used bacon bits instead of frying the bacon myself (out of pure laziness), and it turned out SUPERB!  It's definately my new favorite potato salad.

Great recipe.  Made just a few modifications based upon other reviewers. *substituted 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 sour cream for the mayo to cut down on calories *substituted green onions for the onion *didn't wait for eggs and potatoes to cool, just chopped up and mixed everything together *substituted Lawry's Seasoned Salt for the table salt Yummy!

This is hands down THE BEST potato salad I have ever made.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I tweaked it a tiny bit, added green onion, cut the amount of bacon about in half, and only used about half the recommended mayonnaise.  It's TO DIE FOR!!!!

This was my first recipe tried on this wonderful website and it was the BEST potato salad I ever had. I did use green onions instead of regular, 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, did not use celery and it was a hit! None left and I wish I had some now, it is HOT!

I really enjoyed this dish, as well as eveyone that was over visiting this weekend. I used green onion, a little sweet and dill relish and 8 eggs, But I had a 'big' pot of red potatos. I also seasoned it up with red pepper, garlic salt, and celery salt. (omitted the celery and boiled the onion with the potatos as my son doesnt like the cruchies.  We just harvested our red potatos and this being the first year we planted, I have been searching for red potato recipes.  Thanks, this is a keeper.

The recipe calls for a lot more mayo then actually needed. I made slightly more than half the recipe, and used only 1/2 cup of mayo and it was plenty. Like other suggested, I used green onions.

Made this a couple of weeks ago and it was very good.  It doesn't have a "zing" per se, but still very good.  I ended up sprinkling Tony Chachere's on top for some oomph.  Will make again and will experiment with some vinegar.

I really enjoyed this, and so did the whole family. I followed reviewer suggestions and did 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I sub.ed the bacon for vegetarian fake bacon. Served as a side to veggie burgers.

Very good recipe.  Followed it exactly and it turned out very yummy.  However, it was time consuming, next time I may use the pre-cooked bacon to save some time (and dishes).

This tuned out fantastic! The only changes I made was I used green onion instead of the regular onion, and light mayo.  Next time I think I will peel the potatoes but that's just a personal preference, and I might use half mayo half miracle whip to add a little zing.  Will definitely be making this again!!

Very good - I did use green onions instead of the regular onion and used half low fat sour cream and half low fat mayo.  Added just a bit of shredded chedder cheese and some chives and this was wow!

Very good basic recipe.  The only changes I made was that I omitted bacon (we had a vegetarian at our party) and added a bit of mustard.

It was good, I think it would have tasted better if served warm.Maybe next time mix the sauce ahead of time and allow the flavors to meld then add to warm potatoes.

Because of all the work involved, I do not make potato salad from scratch. I buy it from the grocery store, ready made. So, when I was tasked with potato salad for Thanksgiving, I was feeling pretty daunted. Of course, I went straight to allrecipe.com to find a good recipe. 

I followed the recipe exactly and I was extremely happy with the results. If I had not been, I would not haved taken it to Thaankgiving dinner! Everyone else loved it, too. 

The only thing I would add next time is some mustard. I do like mustard flavor in my potato salad. Personal opinion, though. as is, this potato salad is wonderful. Besides the potato boiling and cubing, it was easy.

Even though I hate the work... I will make this again. Definitely.

10 stars! I made this for a churh potluck. It was the only dish that was completly empty when finished. Actually I had to make two batches as my kids ate the first. They ask for it all the time. I did as some sugest and added a little sourcream and mirclewhip to give it more pazza's I also used jared bacon pieces as a time saver. Oh also make sure to use red new potatoes as red tatoes doesn't cut it. THANKS

This salad was perfect.  I only made a half batch, as I only had about 1 lb of red potatoes.  I also cut them and cubed them prior to boiling them.  Other than that I made according to the direction.  It was delicious.

Got rave reviews at the table.  I used thick cut bacon to make it stand out from the other ingredients a little.  Definitely my go-to potato salad recipe.

This is a great salad! Our family has been making this same recipe for years but with the addition of crab.  We prefer the real deal but imitation works well also.  It's been a requested favorite at all family get togethers. Be sure to let it set for at least a couple of hours before serving...better yet, make it the day before. Enjoy!!

I absolutely love this recipe. Thanks to Donna for the specific instructions (I'd never cooked boiled eggs like that before, and I usually either under or over cooked the potatoes). The only change that I made was I sub'd turkey bacon, and used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup of mayo. The first day it was absolutely delicious.   I was disappointed, however, that the next day the leftovers were soggy/watery and some of the flavor was lost. Not sure what happened with that, as the potatoes were drained and chilled as instructed.

Okay, this it like the best thing I've ever tasted!!  So good and perfect just the way it is.  Not the healthiest, but when you're eating potato salad, you're obviously not interested in health, huh? 
So yummy, and easy.

I wanted to make something a little different than the standard potato salad (russets, eggs, pickles and mayo) and this was it. We accidentally purchased low fat mayo for this and still got rave reviews! The bacon is key.

Excellent! I did however change the onion to green onion. Also the potatos need to be cooked longer than 15 mins. Mine we're still hard and I din't realize until after it was too late! But, the flavor was to-die for!

It was the first time I made potato salad and my kids loved it! I added a lil mustard, just to shock the taste buds, but other then that followed the direction as given. I would also layer the potatoes, bacon, and dressing before mixing.

WOW! I cannot keep this stuff in the house because I will eat it until it is gone. It is just awesome. When I first read the recipe I thought it looked a little fattening but I wanted flavor not health food, and flavor is what I got. I took this to a BBQ for my husband's office and everyone loved it.

Fantastic potato salad...I have tried many recipes before and this is the last one I will ever try! Great recipe! For bacon, I put aluminum foil down onto a baking sheet and cook the bacon in the oven, this reduces the mess but you still get crisp and delicious bacon. The only other thing I changed is to add garlic salt to taste, 2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon of minced onion. Those measurments aren't exact, just really unti you get the desired flavor. So good! I now make this for every picnic potluck!

I made this potato salad for a July 4th family event.  These are extremely picky eaters and on top of that, 4 people were visiting the States from Germany. I trusted the reviews and made this potato salad. It was a huge hit. Two people asked for the recipe and I got more compliments from these picky eaters than I ever have in several years!

The only thing I changed was to add 2 Tablespoons of vinegar and 1 teaspoon of sugar to the mayo.

I made this potato/egg salad recipe for a pot luck at work! It was awesome! No leftovers whatsoever! I did switch it up a little bit however. Instead of 2cups of mayo, I just kept adding miracle whip til coated well, then I added a couple dollops of sour cream! I kept the bacon on the side, as the pot luck was for a coworker who is a vegetarian! Thanks submitter!

So everyone loved this, I just liked it.  I missed the tanginess of pickles (but it juts me because I love pickles!).  The textures were great though.  Oh and no 2 cups of mayo for me!

Amazing!  This went over extremely well with very conservative food critiques! I was asked to make this for Father's Day again by my father as his gift!  I just finely chopped up the onions and egg b/c of the texture issures some people had and added a bit of dill to the cooling potatoes.  EXCELLENT

Heavy, even if it is potato salad. I think the bacon added to that heavy taste... a lite or fate-free mayo and some granny smith apples would've probably helped.

Okay recipe. I used half miracle whip, and half sour cream like others suggested.  I loved the bacon, it was good, I just felt like it was missing something, it was a tad bland for me.

Yum!  This recipe was perfect, simple and so delicious!  It was my first time making potato salad and I'm sticking with this recipe for years to come.  I had to make it in a hurry and used the refrigerated pre-cooked bacon and left out 1/2 cup of mayo.  Everyone absolutely loved this dish!

This recipe makes awesome potato salad!  I made the exact recipe except I left out the celery and did half sweet onion and some green onion.  I highly recommend this recipe for a simple, tasty potato salad.  Thanks!

This recipe got rave reviews from my family.  The only thing I did differently was leave the onions out.  I will definitely make it again.  It also makes for incredible left overs.

Very good recipe.  Not too time consuming to make, either.  I used green onion instead of onion, out of personal preferance.  Next time I may leave out the bacon.

This was so good. I may never use another potato salad recipe again. I used the small little red roaster potatoes so I didn't even cut them. It was pretty and tasty. I will use this many more times I am sure.

I made this for Easter and it's the first potato salad I have ever made. It got rave reviews. I will fix this again! My only changes...I used a little less onion (sweet), I used 12 oz. of low sodium bacon and I cut my potatoes up before I boiled them. I will check them at 10 minutes next time. Someone suggested adding grated cheddar and I think that would be a good addition.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I grate the eggs on a cheese grater so they mix in finely with the salad.  I also add a shake or two of beau monde and dry mustard.  Everyone loves it!

What a wonderful salad!  I made a few changes.  I added only have the mayo and I used Miracle Whip instead.  I also added some mustard to give it a little flavor as well as a little dill.  This sald got huge raves.  Everyone said it was the best potato salad they ever had and my husband who hates potato salad inhaled it.

Made this twice already and everyone keeps asking me to make it again.  This was my first time making potato salad and I found it be quite easy.  I did make some small adjustment such as adding sweet pickled relish, dill weed and like someone earlier had suggested, I used half mayo and half sour cream. It comes out perfect every time.

Very tasty.  Potatoes need to cook longer, as they weren't chopped before cooking.  And the amount of mayonnaise called for seems too high; we used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup yogurt to keep the calories and fat content reasonable.

I thought it was a bit bland but everyone at the BBQ thought it was great.  It was my first potato salad so it turned out good.  I used green onions, that is the only change I made.  I think next time I may experiment with some seasonings to give it a little boost.  It's a good basic salad and the bacon is a fantastic touch.

I added a lot of blue cheese crumbles to this and it was delicious. I also seasoned with a few dashes of Old Bay seasoning, which kicks up the celery flavor a few notches.

Delicious....but I made some changes to taste. My extra additions were: apple cidar vinagar, chopped carrot, scallions, dijon mustard, used only 2 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 lb. bacon, and used 3 lbs. of baby red skins. We all loved this potato salad. Will make again!

This recipe was a big hit.  Since I'm not a real fan of potato salad, this was my first attempt ever.  Even I enjoyed this recipe and will be making it again in the future, especially with summer on its way !!  I left out the bacon since I don't like bacon, but I am sure everyone would have enjoyed it either way.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great potato salad! I usually don't care for potato salads because they have too much mayonaise and are too mushy. This one turned out really chunky. I used turkey bacon because I prefer it. I also like this salad because you can alter the ingredients to suit your taste, and it still turns out great! I added an extra stalk of celery and used a bit less mayonaise.

This was actually a surprise.  When I made this, it seemed like the mayo proportion was way too low and it was going to end up dry.  And even though it wasn't a really moist type like what I usually like, it surprised me and was pretty good.  I really think the bacon made it.  I nearly always use fat-free Miracle Whip for anything calling for mayo (in fact, I just call it mayo w/out thinking), and I cut up the potatoes first, partly because they cook faster and partly because I despise cutting up cooked potatoes.  I use turkey bacon a lot, but think I may have used real bacon for this.  This might sound silly, but I do appreciate a recipe with a more realistic "prep" time.  I made another recently with 15 minutes on it; yeah, sure, as long as everything's already cut up and cooked!

Very good salad, but i did reduce the amount of onion, and replaced some of the onion with green onion. I then added a bit of garlic, and a bit of sour cream in replacement of some mayo... maybe a 1/4 cup. 
I then reduced the bacon a bit and added shredded mexican 4 cheese blend, very good, huge hit!

This was a decent potato salad - but not the best.  Perhaps it could use a little more mayo or some mustard to bring it up a notch?  I made it for a picnic and didn't really get any feedback.  I think I might have undercooked the potatoes a bit - which might attribute to it being a bit dry.

I used 1/2 mayonnaise & 1/2 sour cream.  Also added red bell pepper, olives, and a little mustard for flavor.  Definately needs mustard.  I only used half of the bacon.  With the additions, it tasted good.

ABsolutely fantastic!  The bacon adds so much flavor and my family loved it.  My mom is allergic to gluten and this potato salad is gluten-free.  She had me make it all the time so she can snack on it.

I brought this salad to a bbq and everyone liked it! The bacon is what sets it apart from "regular" potato salad! I need to add more salt next time, and cook the potatoes a little longer--I cooked them for 20 minutes but they could've used 5-10 more since I was making so much. I might also add green onions. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great potato salad!  I just changed a couple of ingredients.  I used green onions and added mustard.  Received many compliments and plan to make this again!

This was good.  I actually didn't add the bacon, but put in more eggs.  I also added some mustard, and I used green onions instead of regular.

I found this recipe to turn out tasting like the potato salad I usually make. I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, cut down the bacon to 2/3 package (could probably cut down to 1/2. I also added a touch of deli style mustard and dill as suggested by another reviewer because I really like these flavors. Maybe this is why it tasted just like the potato salad I usually make (without a recipe). I like my salad to have a little crunch or a little something unexpected. If I were making this just for myself I would probably add some diced red pepper, olives, and garlic. I didn't need to add salt and it made a nice fair sized bowl.

This recipe is so fantastic!  The bacon really does it.  I never thought I would like any potato salad better than my Grandma's.  This one won me over though.  Don't tell Grandma.

I made this Sunday morning for an evening BBQ and it was quite bland.  However, today the flavours have melded and it is tastier.  I added a little dill pickle and juice today to give it even more oomph.

This recipe is wonderful!!  Would HIGHLY recommend~Even my husband who is not a big potato salad fan loved it.  This recipe makes a lot of salad-We have family of five with generous helpings and still could have fed another family:)  Leftovers are great next day after flavors blend.  Great make ahead dish for summer parties.

I used light ranch dressing instead of mayo.  It gives it the kick it needs, plus it is real simple.  Guests don't even know it is ranch dressing!

This recipe was really great.  I took this dish to an Easter get-together yesterday and it was great!  I will use half the amount of onion next time because it was a little strong, but other than that it was easy to prepare and yummy as well.

I really love the bacon in this, but it still really needs a kick of some sort.  Other than the bacon, I felt like it was pretty bland.  I also think it needs more than 1 stalk of celery.  Presentation was nice though.

I really liked this recipe. I made the suggested changes - 1/2 c of mayo and sour cream, used green onions instead, added sweet relish and ommitted the celery. I made it over the 4th of July weekend and it worked well. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this using half sour cream/half mayo as suggested-delicious, those who never ate or liked potato salad loved it.  I used 3/4 lb bacon and a 1/2 a white onion. I used more potato, probably closer to 3.5 lbs, judging by what was left in a 5 lb. bag(no scale to weigh) and made sure to finely chop onion as someone else suggested and cut the potato small.  I'm making it again for the 4th.

This was really good potato salad.  My husband doesn't like red skinned p.s. but he liked this one.  Brought a large bowl of it to a family reunion and it disappeared quickly. I also used a little sour cream (about 1/2) in place of some of the mayo, green onions, and ready made bacon bits (the real ones).  Thanks!

Great potato salad recipe.  I don't understand all those who "added" mustard...this is a nice change from mustard based potato salad. I did do 1/2 mayo 1/2 s cream as others suggested.  Love the bacon, I used Oscar Meyer Real Bacon Pieces to cut down prep time....Love the crunch from celery added another stalk...tasted better the 2nd day.

Very good with a big dollop of dijon mustard and some dill for extra flavoring.  With the mustard, you can cut back on the amount of mayo you use.

This is the recipe for which I've been searching.  It really was wonderful.  I made it for an impromptu cookout tonight, didn't alter the recipe, and it was a HIT.  People went back for 3rds and said it could hae been a meal unto itself.  This is fabulous!

5+++++++++  Yum, yum, yum.  Hardboiled the eggs and fried up the bacon the day before, so putting it together went quickly.  Did not change a thing and it was absolutely delicious!  Thank you.

This is the BEST potato salad. I also followed others advice and went with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. I'm throwing out my other potato salad recipe!

Delicious! The bacon gives it a unique flavor---better than the plain old regular potato salad. Big hit at our family gathering. --Would suggest fat-free mayo to help reduce fat/calories. Otherwise, wonderful recipe as-is! Definitely recommend at least trying (you WILL make it again!!)

This is the first time I have made potato salad and it was a big hit!  I took it to a family picnic and got many compliments.  Made it without bacon because several family members are vegetarians, but will put it in next time!  It was delicious without it anyway.

This is the first time I made potato salad & had it turn out right!  I used scallions instead of a white onion and added parsley and only 1/2 the bacon.  I also used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1 1/4 cup mayo as suggested.  REALLY good...thanks!

This was absolutely delicious - I took it to a family potluck and even though I quadrupled the recipe it was all gone. We loved it. I didn't make any changes, and my nine year old stepdaughter really did most of the work - it was very easy to make :) Yummy yummy.

Very good variation of potato salad. I also cut up the potatoes before cooking them which made it easier.

Good potato salad -- everyone really liked the bacon.  Next time, I think I'll try adding a little mustard with the mayo for a bit more tanginess.

I used low fat mayo and real bacon bits.  I also added paprika to the recipe.  I made this for the 4th of July, and my whole family really liked this recipe.   We plan on making it again this week.  It is definitely a keeper.

I usually am not a fan of potato salad, but I have already made this one twice in two weeks.  Very, very good.  I am passing this recipe on!
