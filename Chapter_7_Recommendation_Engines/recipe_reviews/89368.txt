This dip is delicious and different. I brought it to a party and got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe. All the flavors blend together and the corn and walnuts blend in and don't sort of jump out on their own. I did tweak the recipe..I added a blend of olive and corn oil and extra lime juice. I used smoky hot ancho chile powder and paprika instead of the red chile powder. I also added the spices slowly to taste, rather than all at once. Oh, and I used thawed frozen corn instead of canned (I think canned has an odd flavor) and I toasted the walnuts, and used my Kitchenaid mixer to blend it all together really well.

Hmmm, didn't think this dip was one to rave over.  The cream cheese sets up very firm after it has chilled; hence many broken chips.  Maybe could thin with milk or sour cream?  Used 1 teaspoon cayenne and it was plenty spicy.  Had a LOT leftover after party, so must not have been a big hit.  Tasted better after a couple days.  The corn/walnut is still something of an acquired taste though.

This was a success at my company's pot luck.  Many people enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  I used green onion to give the dish a bit more colour.

My family looked at me funny when I told them about the dip, but when they tried it they loved it.  I was concerned about a whole tablespoon of red chile pepper, so I only added about 3/4 of it (cayenne) and it was still plenty spicy.  Maybe those who said it was bland used chili powder instead.  That certainly wouldn't give it enough kick.  I will definitely make it again and have already shared the recipe!

I'm sorry but this wasn't very good.  It makes a ton but then I had to throw out what wasn't eaten and that was a lot.  I followed the recipe exactly but it certainly wasn't a hit. Too much onion and very "flat" tasting.  Maybe we just aren't big fans of southwestern cuisine here in the south.

We had a heck of a time getting the cream cheese and lime juice to combine, but it ended up being well worth it. There's a little something missing, but I will continue to make this, as it was a big hit at my company get-together.

Wow, kind of an odd combination of ingredients, but everyone LOVED it.  It was a huge hit and success.  This one is saved to the recipe box.  I will make it again.

We have appetizer night once a month at my house. I paired this with tortilla chips. It was the hit of the night. It was super easy to throw together. It was complete before the frozen appetizers we bought were finished heating in the oven! I will add to the appetizer rotation. Thanks!

I made it for a 4th of July party and everybody loved it! I used garlic powder instead of salt to give it extra flavoring. I also cut back a little on the cream cheese to make it a little bit more chunkier. It was a huge hit and I'm definitely going to make it again.

This has become a "regular" whenever I make an appetizer as it is so different and unexpected.  I did have to cut down on the red chile pepper.  I usually serve it with the "scoops" chips and a little knife or spoon so there are fewer broken chips.  Everyone raves about this recipe!

Huge hit for a work "food day".  I had several request for the recipe.  I added 1 more can of corn and omitted the walnuts.

This would be a really good addition to a Southwest or Chili dinner party.  It's definitely different but tasty.  Very easy to make, I'd serve it with tortilla chips or spoon it in to the scoop shaped tortilla chips for finger foods.

This was really well received at my party.   It is a tad hard when you first take it out of the fridge, but softens quickly.  I served it with Ritz.  Delious.

This was pretty good. Everyone who tried it liked it, they just didn't eat much. If I make it again I will probably leave out the walnuts. I am just not a big fan of them.

Not too spicy, just right.  Might add more walnuts next time, the flavor wasn't quite prominent enough for me.  And I've tried frozen corn but will probably go with the canned corn next time as recommended.  Lots of people ask me for this recipe at parties.  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!
