I used vanilla almond bark for the chocolate and for flavoring 1 tsp butter flavor and 1/2 tsp rum flavor. This made it taste like a lifesavor butter rum candy to me.  This is  easy  to make and easy on the wallet.:)

I made this fudge to sell for charity along with several others. I've had many compliments on this one. I enjoyed the mellow flavor with white chocolate.

I found this fudge to be mediocre at best.  It took a while (overnight) to set, and even then was rather soft.  Also, I did not care for the flavor that much.  I'll be sticking to my traditional recipe from now on.

This was 5 star ease, with 4 star flavor.  Just a basic vanilla fudge.
