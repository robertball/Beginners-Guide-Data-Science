Made this for a luncheon at work today...it was a HIT!! Served it with scoop Frito's - everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!  Super easy to make too! It doesn't make very much so if you're serving a crowd you need to double the recipe.

This was incredibly easy to make and really good. I halved the recipe and added 6 slices of my own cooked bacon crumbled instead of the bacon bits. Served with crackers.

Really enjoyed this dip. Just don’t short yourself on the bacon or you will end up wishing you added more!

This dip is so incredibly simple and addictive!!! I didn’t have enough cheddar cheese so I added in some Monterey Jack. It was creamy and delish. I made it for a party, but had to seat my family away because they couldn’t stop devouring it. Next time I will double it for sure. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

I have made this several times and it never disappoints!  It is the dip that goes the fastest. I do use fresh bacon for preference and I do recommend doubling as it goes fast. Thank you!

Made it exactly like it said, just doubled the recipe because it was a large Super Bowl party and it doesn't make too much if you don't.  The boys said, "I  give it a ten out of ten" and the ladies asked for the recipe :)  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made this for tailgating at my nephew’s football game. It was a hit! In fact, my sister-in- law asked me to make it again  for Thanksgiving. So here I am making it again on Thanksgiving morning! The only thing I did differently is add 2 cups of cheese because I bought the packaged shredded Mac and Cheese blend and that was the amount in the package, so I added about 1/4 extra cup of mayo. Super easy and very yummy!

This was very tasty and smells wonderful! I followed the steps but for some reason it had a LOT of grease on top. I kept trying to drain/sop it up but it was a bit of an issue. Didn't take away from the taste, just the appearance. Will try again and use a different shredded cheese.

Delicious and a crowd pleaser! We have made this recipe 3 times and even served it at our open house, keeping it warm in a ‘little Dipper’ Crock Pot. That was a test and this dip held both flavour and consistently for the whole night! A winner!

I have to give it five stars for the fact that everyone who ate this LOVED it. I took it for a cookout at my work. I used real bacon instead of the bacon bits. I however did not care for it. I thought it to be greasy (probably from the bacon) but also it was just plain for me. I may make it again but stuff some jalapenos with it.

I love this recipe.  My family and friends ask for it now.  It always goes fast.  I replace the mayonnaise with sour cream and use cooked think cut crumbled bacon instead of the bacon bits.  Turns out perfect every time.  For a crowd I double and triple the recipe.  I serve with crackers and veggies.  Will be making it for a Christmas party this weekend.  It will be gone at the end of the night.

This dip was awesome!  My girls and I made this dip as an extra dip so we could try it out.  No one could stay out of it, it was completely gone!  We didn't have an oven available to us, so we just heated it up in the microwave and it was still wonderful!
