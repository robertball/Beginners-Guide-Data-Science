I suppose this is called strawberry fields, because it tastes like strawberries and a little like the grass in the fields! Either way, I don't care it was healthy and it still had a slightly fruity taste. I made 1/4 of the recipe and got about 1 cup. I subbed kale for the spinach as my only real change and my banana was frozen. I had to use 1/2 cup of water for 1/4 of the recipe to get my blender to budge and I used a Vitamix. Plan to add a little more water. This is more for the advanced smoothie drinker with the added vegetables. Note, the color is brown.

It is healthy but took me a lot longer than 15 minutes to prepare! Worth it though to have something healthy for breakfast

Great recipe!! I just got back from the farm store and was searching for a simple smoothie with spinach and fruit. I came across yours and it was great! I just used apple juice instead of water because I don’t have any water at the moment but still was good I didn’t have to add apples. I am new to smoothies and juice making. I blended the spinach first and then just a small handful at a time of the ingredients. I am saving this one :)
