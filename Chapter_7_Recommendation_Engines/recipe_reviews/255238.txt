I left out the tomatoes due to personal preference so because of that I added a bit more chicken broth and rice. I felt the recipe needed more herbs but maybe that was my own fault for not using the seasoned tomatoes. I ended up adding some Italian seasoning but that was all. I really liked the hot pepper flakes and will double them next time. This was a good soup and one  I will make again. It was super simple and is one that is easily adjusted to fit your tastes.

I needed a veggie soup fast for my baby girl's supper. Therefore, I just chopped everything super small, including the chicken, and brought the stock with 2 cups of water to a boil. I reduced to a simmer and continued cooking until the vegetables were soft. I used a can of Italian seasoned tomatoes for extra flavour. This soup is delicious! It had tons of flavour and my girl ate two bowls full. I pur√©ed it after cooking for her.

Didn't stray from the recipe and was So delicious. Easy, Comforting, and best of all gluten free! My husband ate almost all of it and he's not gluten intolerant.  Thank you for a great tasting homemade soup.

I will definitely make this again.  I used high quality broth and chicken thighs. I think that helps.  Simple and yummy!

Used turkey instead of chicken. I added more rice but failed to add more liquid ended up with a turkey, rice and vegetable goulash! Wonderful flavor and filling

I added thinly sliced red-skin potatoes in with the frozen veggies (corn and french cut green beans) for the last hour.  Made it a bit heartier and fed a group of 25 with great reviews.

Delicious! Really nice flavor and it's tick and hearty. Next time I will add some extra rice.
