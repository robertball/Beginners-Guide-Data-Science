We prepared with chicken thighs to improve the flavor and skipped the feta. We cubed the chicken and stirred everything together into one dish and it was delicious.

This was excellent when fresh. However, leftovers did not turn out, so that's the reason for only 4 stars. The cucumber salad sort of "wilted" with the dressing on it for the next day. I will try to leave off the dressing and add to leftovers when ready to eat and see if that is better.

Delicious! My wife picked it out and we made it for her dad, who also enjoyed it. We all liked the way  the lemon sauce carried through all three parts of the meal, and the olives in the couscous were amazing. We'll be making this again soon.

This was a winner! I loved all the flavors and how it came together. Using thin-sliced chicken breasts worked perfect. I'd make this again for dinner/work lunches. Instead of adding the parsley to the final dish, I chopped it up and added it to the tomato/cucumber salad.
