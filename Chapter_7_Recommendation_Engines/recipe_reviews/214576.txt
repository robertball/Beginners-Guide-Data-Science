Perfect side dish, perfect comfort food.  To tell you the truth, have this with nothing more than a tossed green salad and some good bread and you've got yourself quite a meal.  Simple perfection.

Commend sense is needed here, never cook bacon in olive oil! Cook the bacon until crisp,drain. Cook garlic in about 1Tb of the olive oil until soft but not brown. Toss garlic and bacon in spaghetti along with any veggies you like and the parsley. Then drizzle good olive oil to taste over all and toss. I like to add a few pepper flakes. Not greasy and very good this way. Also added parm and onion.

I make this all the time for a quick easy inexpensive meal or side. I throw chopped up onion, mushrooms squash or any combination of vegetables on hand while sauteing. Always a hit and an easy way to get veggies in kids...what kid does not love spaghetti!!

I add a whipped up raw egg to the hot pasta along with the bacon and 1/4 c Parmesan cheese. Easy and delicious.

Meh. This was okay but really bland and needed something like oregano or rosemary added for flavor. Maybe some parmesan too? It was just grease and pasta with a little garlic taste, not too impressive.

Actually you do not need oil. Put the cut bacon in the pan and stir until crispy.  Then put garlic and/or onions. The oil from the bacon shall be sufficient.  Try putting chopped fresh basil leaves too.

I am going to rate this a 4, but it was a one timer at our house.  Flavor was good just not our style.  A couple of MUSTS:  Cut the oil WAY back, add additional veggies/spices.  I added broccoli, onion, red&green bell peppers.  And lastly make sure bacon is crispy.

This recipe rocks I think!!!  Nothing annoys me more than when people rate and review a recipe and say how much they disliked it and how much they tweaked it!!  What's the point of even reading any of the recipes if folks completely change them?  
I have to comment on Imogenesue's review,  I believe you were trying to say common sense,  which by the way is very rude in my eyes to word your comment that way,   but you said  (typed) commend sense!!  I would think  proof reading would be common sense!!  HaHaHaHa

I made a tad healthier version. I used whole wheat spaghetti, added 2 large leaves of fresh basil chopped, used pre-cooked bacon (so there wasn't as much grease) and added 1 13.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes. The family went wild!! Definitely will become a regular at our house. Oh and parmesan makes it even better.

Made this for dinner last night and it was good.  Very kid friendly.  I added extra salt and a little pepper and topped it with Parmesan cheese.  Also, I used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh.  Served with steamed broccoli & cauliflower & carrots.  Very economical.  Will make again.

This is one of my "go to" recipes for a busy day.  I like to reserve the bacon, crumble it, and serve it on top of the pasta with Parmesan cheese.  You also may be able to get by with a bit less oil--experiment with the amount to your liking.

I couldn't believe it when I saw this in my email this afternoon!  My grandmother made this (well very close to it) when we were kids.  We called NBC - Noodles Bacon and Cottage Cheese.  Obviously, the missing element on this recipe is the cottage cheese.  My grandmother would mix breadcrumbs with the bacon (and some of the grease) - we called those sprinkles.  I didn't know anyone else on the planet ate anything even close to NBC.  I loved it, my kids love it, me and my wife will have it once in a while.

Thanks for stirring up a fond memory.

I did not care for this dish.  Cooking the bacon in olive oil should have been a clue, but tried it anyway.  Too greasy.

I'm not sure about this one...I didn't put all of the olive oil on because it was mixed with the bacon fat.  I added italian seasoning, but it still seemed like it was missing something.  It needs some veggies or more spices.

This was good.  I added some salt and freshly ground black pepper, and topped with grated cheese (an Italian Blend).   I used 8 ounces of pasta, so I cut down on the other ingredients, too.  The timing seemed a little bit off for me, the garlic was starting to brown too much before the bacon was crisp.  next time, I won't add the garlic so early.  Also, I think I won't add the oil until it's time to mix it with the pasta, maybe I won't need so much.   But over all, it was really good!

It was a good base recipe. I made a few changes. I cooked the bacon (with no added oil) with a chopped onion in a skillet, boiled the spaghetti with salt (you should always do this, but precious reviewers mentioned they didn't because they weren't told to), tossed cooked spaghetti with bacon onion mixture, added diced tomatoes and then added a small amount of basil infused evoo (maybe a few tablespoons, way less than 1/4 cup). And then some fresh spices, salt & pepper to taste. It was a nice, easy, cheap comfort meal served with a simple salad. I would probably make it again should the urge to eat bacon pasta arise again.

We are bacon fans so we loved this.  We used it for a side dish with chicken.  I recommend using using olive oil to cook your bacon, it keeps it from sticking and burning.  It doesn't take a lot, but it really helps.

As written it is just OK.  I like these additions to up the flavor LOTS.....BUT only costs a tiny bit AND ONLY 2 minutes more.  Add  1 cadiced tomatoes WITH OREGANO, GARLIC, AND BASIL( perfect blend of herbs & tomatoes...No guessing).  Just dump in 1 or 2 cans . Heat  t.Toss in a goodcl handful of parm cheese

This was a pretty good dish, I think it would have been more flavorful if I had salted the pasta water. Would also be good as a side dish or served under some sauteed chicken cutlets.

My family really enjoyed this dish. Very simple and hearty. I added some chopped sautéed onion which was my only alteration and it gave a slight sweetness to the bacon flavor in the pasta. Will be making again.

I haven't made this in years! Thank you for the reminder. Spaghetti, garlic & olive oil, with whatever else one wants to add, whatever variations. The three-ingredient base is the essence of comfort food!

This was a delicious recipe!! I made it my own with lots of different veggies, made it with turkey bacon and whole wheat pasta. Made the bacon separately, sautéed the veggies together, tossed the bacon, veggies and pasta all together with lemon olive oil. I bought Italian Focaccia, drizzled Italian Olive Oil over it and used it to dip in the Italian Olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar. Will definitely be making this again!! :)

I've tried this twice now, first as written and then again with additions.  The second time I added onion, fresh basil. red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  I also reduced the olive oil slightly.  Just a suggestion, this recipe is great as is.

I made this several weeks ago, and it didn't turn out as good as I had hoped. It was edible but not amazing.

I used a couple of the suggestions, such as using the bacon grease instead of olive oil, and then I used onion in place of garlic because I dislike garlic!  Delicious, I'll make it again!

Really great although I changed it up quite a bit and I would still change it slightly. Drain off at least half of bacon grease and could be replaced with half the amount of oil recommended if not less. I added an extra clove of garlic, half an onion, and a tricolor blend of peppers (which I might leave out next time) and I would instead add  fresh tomatoes and a sprinkle of Parmesan at the end. Delicious and my dad loved it;))

This is now one of my favorite recipes! I add sun`dried tomatoes and "mock seafood-crab" as well. I never have fresh parsley on hand so I do substitute dried. Always taste test before leaving the range top. You may want to add more garlic.

Loved it...Fixed this for some company we had last night...took a few other suggestions and added about half a can of diced tomatoes as well as a cup of the boiling water from the noodles and let that cook with the bacon and garlic.  Was hoping to dilute the greasiness that others were talking about.  That did the trick or I just used a lot more pasta, not sure which, but i served in individual pasta bowls with some fresh Parmesan on top, then a little sprinkle of parsley followed by some grated Parmesan cheese.  It was a hit and wasn't too greasy...I do agree that a little more seasoning may need to be added to taste but other than that, I'll be holding on to this recipe for future uses

This is spaghetti carbonara without the eggs and shredded parmesan cheese. I would cook the bacon separately, not in olive oil. Some combination of Italian seasonings wouldn't hurt either. Quick, easy and tasty.

I would advise people to cook pasta according to the direstions on the box/wrapper. 12 minute spaghetti would be msh to the bite, meethinks. I would certainly cook the bacon separately and use a very smount of the grease for flavor, if that.

Very quick & easy.  After reading other comments about being too greasy, I drained some of the grease before mixing with the pasta. Also only had dried parsley to use but still turned out very good.  Will make again!!

This was ok. The recipe seemed like it would be so flavorful and easy, but it took a lot longer to cook the bacon and I had to kick up the seasoning a LOT! I added fennel, basil, Italian seasoning, oregano, onions,  pepper, more bacon and smoked sausage.  Finished it off with Parmesan cheese. That was the difference-maker.  I also used cavatappi noodles instead of spaghetti.  I also agree with other reviewers  that there's no need to cook the bacon in olive oil. I enjoyed the dish with the changes.

We found this was a good basic recipe.  Having read some of the reviews before making it, I used only about a tablespoon of oil.  I added some onions, peppers and squash.  Next time my husband wants to add some cherry tomatoes and we'll probably continue to experiment with different herbs, spices and veggies.  The recipe lends itself well to variations.

The only changes I made were to sauté the garlic, and to add a beaten egg to the hot spaghetti.  We LOVED it - it will be a side dish I will make again.

I have made this before and always add halved grape tomatoes and basil.  Another variation is to add the egg yolk and Parmesan for true carbonara.

Great dish! no need to substitute anything at all, any kind of pasta will do. I do have to agree with another reviewer that you dont need to add any oil when cooking bacon...it definitely has its own.
Topped with a sprinkle of parm is a must

My sweet Italian grandmother made this all the time, when money was tight. She could feed 20 people with 3 strips of bacon (if she had to ration) some garlic, a little olive oil, crushed red pepper and pasta! But, she would finely dice the bacon, then cook it, and add an onion, diced, and some shredded cabbage. Season it well, then toss with hot, drained noodles, or whatever pasta you want, and finished it with a generous drizzle of great olive oil, and freshly grated Parmesan. The amount of pasta was where she could stretch the meal. She used as much pasta as she needed to feed the number of people at the table. As long as the pasta water was well salted, whatever she tossed with the base of bacon, onion, cabbage , garlic and crushed red pepper all tasted divine! I never knew we were poor!

This is a 'poor mans' spaghetti carbonara which I prefer. The carbonara is no more difficult or time consuming but uses raw egg, I do use pasteurized eggs which my local Safeway carries when I make the traditional spaghetti carbonara.

Loved it! Based on some of the reviews, I decided to make a few changes. First, I cut the noodle quantity in half and doubled the olive oil. I added fresh mushrooms as well along with oregano and garlic salt. I also used peppered bacon. Delicious.

Noodles, garlic, and olive oil with added bacon! Great side dish :)  As others suggested, don't cook the bacon in olive oil. Use some of the excess bacon grease to saute garlic, onion, and other vegetables once bacon is cooked and set to drain on some paper towel. Sprinkle with a bunch of parmesan cheese. I also added about a cup of cream with some flour, salt, oregano, rosemary, and thyme. Bring cream mixture to a boil for about one minute. (I will add some basil next time.)  Poor over noodle, bacon mixture. Enjoy!

As is, this was pretty bland, but it's a great base for a great dish. I eat turkey bacon, so used that and it was fine. To jazz it up, I also added basil, and shrimp. Next time I might try some clams with the juice to kick up the I notch on flavor...or add in some cherry tomatoes and grated Parmesan cheese, or even some fresh spinach. But as the recipe is in itself, I'll give 3 stars.

This is a perfect side dish for chicken or pork chops. I read other reviews that said it was kind of bland, so I sprinkled it with powdered ranch dressing mix, and that was the trick it needed! Great recipe for quick, easy and cheap!

This is absolutely one of my favorites, there's a million things you can do with this dish and still keep it simple and tasty. I enjoy sun dried tomatoes chopped and mixed in with the garlic and parsley. Then a good glass of red wine and you are in heaven.

Too much oil. Used Pam instead of evoo. I put parsley and garlic in Minnie food processor . Mixed with pasta and sprinkled with fresh parm. Add salad and crusty bread.  Family approved.

Made for the family for the first time!  Daughter of 3 had seconds and husband thought it was a lot better with a pinch of salt to taste.

This recipe is a takeoff on a favorite it Italy, Spaghetti alla Matriciana (spelling unsure).  I think the only thing different in the actual rendering of it is that onion is always included.  It i a quickie and always tasty but has never been a favorite of my husband.  I think it's worth 4 stars if for no other reason than speed and that's good enough for me!
