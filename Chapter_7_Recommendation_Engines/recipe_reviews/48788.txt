The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I changed it a bit.  I browned the meat with some onion,fresh garlic and Montreal Steak Seasoning before adding it to the pasta.  I only used 1/2 the pasta it called for and it was plenty!!  It was enough for 4 adults and 3 kids with just enough leftover for my hubbies lunch.  I used 1 can of diced tomatoes in their juice and 1 1/2 cans of tomato sauce mixed all together with Italian seasoning and some dried parsley.  I also reserved some of the cheese for the top(last 10 minutes of baking)and also added some crushed Ritz Crackers on top for extra crunch!  My husband loved it! It was super yummy and my picky 4 and 6 year olds gobbled it up.  Thank you Kelli for the post.  I will definitely make this again mabye adding some veggies next time. It is a good base to start.

I did not think this would taste better than it looked. My family and I, really enjoyed it (especially my husband). At first, when my husband looked at it, he frawned, lol. But when he smelled it cooking, and tasted it, he had seconds! He said its way better than the processed, canned stuff, which I had to agree with him on! I usually dont like beefaroni, but making it home-made, make it taste good! lol) 

I made some changes to the recipe, to make it more tasty and look presentable: 1) I added more cheese to it. (My family loves cheese, lol) 2) Added chunky spagetti sauce with mushrooms (had some spices). 3) Added some spices, that wasnt in the spagetti sauce (use spices that you like and use, in an Italian type dish) I didnt make the sauce that went to this recipe. 4) I layered it more like a lagnasa, mixing just some noodles into the meat mixture, instead of mixing it all together. It turned looking and tasting really good! 

This is a great recipe, if you want to make a different, and simple, italian-taste dish for your family. Hope this helps, cause the beefaroni version I made to this recipe, will make it taste better, as well as make it hold well, together...when presenting it, instead of it looking like one, big slop!

Very good throw-together dish.  I did make some additions;  sauted a chopped onion, bell pepper and minced garlic with the meat.  Seasoned it up a little with some Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and worchestshire.  I also put some stewed, diced tomatoes in for a little chunkier sauce.  Not gourmet, but so much better than a box mix!!

Although this sounds good, the recipe as it was made in the early 1970's for our family it was called Skillet Macaroni and Beef.  All prepared and cooked in one skillet. The first part in the directions are the same...then remove the meat from the skillet and add 1/2 pound elbow macaroni, minced onion and chopped green pepper until onion is soft, (if needed, add a little oil) return meat to skillet and for 1-1/2 lbs ground beef or ground turkey add 16 ounces of tomato sauce, water, salt and pepper, 1-1/2 Tablespoons Worcestershire Sauce. Cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until macaroni is cooked to taste.  Yum-Yum...children loved it.

I modified the recipe alot because I thought the dish would need something more.  Overall this is a good starter recipe that you can modify easily.  It's also a fast and easy recipe to make if you are tired and don't really feel like cooking or if you are a beginner cook.  I added 1 chopped red pepper, 1 chopped onion, 2 jalapeno peppers chopped, 3 cloves garlic, seasoned salt and pepper.  Since I didn't have Shredded Cheddar, I had to use 4 cheese mexican shredded cheese.  I added a little bit of salt and pepper when cooking the ground beef and a little more just before I put the dish in the oven. The meal was great and still fast to make since I cut the other ingredients while waiting for the water to boil and while the meat was cooking. This dish could have used another pound of ground beef, but that depends on you and how much meat you want in the dish.  A mistake I made was thinking it needed more tomato and added a few spoonfuls of a can of diced tomato...this was slightly too much tomato.

This was Awesome. I did add some cajun seasoning (slap ya mama) to it. along with some garlic powder while cooking the meat and after it was all mixed up. I mixed 2 cups of the cheese in the dish and added about a half cup to the top. The boys loved it! EASY to make too. I used about 14 ounces of elbow macaroni.  will make again.

Simple recipe for fantastic comfort food.  I add chopped onions and garlic powder to the meat.  This is easy to make during the work week, and much better than boxed hamburger meals. A hit with the whole family, toddler to adult.  We make this regularly. Thanks for sharing!

This was a hit with my family. I think it's a good base recipe. It was easy and fast..which makes it a hit with me. After reading the reviews, I only used 11oz of pasta, added some garlic powder and italian seasoning to the ground beef as it was browning, and I used a 28 oz jar of spaghetti sauce because I didn't have the tomato sauce. I also mixed all ingredients in the pan before placing it in the casserole dish..it was easier to mix that way. Following others advice I held some of the cheese back and topped the casserole the last 5-10 minutes. This is a recipe my teenaged daughters could easily make so it will go in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I followed the recipe, accept I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Worchestershire Sauce, two cloves of garlic, and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  It made a lot of food, I didn't think we would be able to finish it, but we did.  Awesome.

This is an easy, filling dinner if you just season things to your taste.  I sauteed onions and minced garlic in olive oil and white wine before adding my beef to the pot, and I seasoned the beef with salt, black pepper, red pepper, and garlic powder. After draining the browned beef, I mixed in a jar of pasta sauce and added Italian seasoning, basil, and more minced garlic.  After the macaroni noodles were done, I drained and returned them to their pot, mixed in the butter and cheese (cheddar jack), then dumped it into the big pot with the meat sauce and stirred it all together.  No need to bake it and dirty another dish; we served it straight from the pot.  My husband and I ate it with garlic bread and were both quite full and satisfied.  Good basic recipe that only needs some personal touches for flavor.  Will use again, thanks!

I thought this was really easy and yummy.  Not a gourmet meal or anything but my kids and I had several helpings.  I used whole wheat spirals and I also added onions and garlic to the meat while browning.  It is not "saucy" so cut back on your noodles if you want more liquid.

Too lazy to go to the store, so was looking for something to make with things I already had. I changed two things, and don't usually like to rate recipes when I do so, but this is worthy. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used some leftover Velveeta that I had from the "Outrageous Warm Chicken Nacho Dip" (from this site)-try it..so good!! Everything else kept the same. Kids went crazy over this and they usually hate to try new things. This made quite a bit, but they polished it off the next day and said it tasted even better. I'll be making this again for the kids often the way I did it, but if for me, I would probably add some onion and garlic to the meat while browning. Since I found something new that the kids like I won't be changing it though.

What a quick and easy recipe. It reminded me of something I had growing up. Simple and delish! But I can see adding some corn, garlic and oregano to it. But as it, my family ate 3/4 of the batch. Thank you, this recipe is a keeper. Oh...and I forgot to add the butter. So I don't think it affected the outcome.

My kiddos loved it.  It took about 15mins to throw together, and they snarfed it up! Served with some salad and fruit to balance it out, it was great.  Totally a kid meal, and pretty good for the adults (but a little on the bland side for my tastes).

I appreciate the five ingredients or less for those with limited resources.  It is an excellent base recipe.  I put pasta sauce and added more herbs such as Italian mix and basil.  I had also put some cheese in the mix as well as on top.  Parmesan is also added for taste. Onion and garlic is a must when browning the meat.  Thanks for the fabulous formula.

This was great.  I didn't have cheddar, so I used mozzarella.  I spiced the meat to my liking.  I used one can sauce, one can undrained diced tomatoes and omitted the butter.  After reading other reviews about baking it dry, I baked it anyway, and I'm glad I did!  It blended beautifully and wasn't overly dry or dripping in sauce.  Great recipe!

This is an ok recipe, but would be much better with revisions as others have done.  I followed the recipe exactly, but will add spaghetti sauce and more cheese next time I make.

This is a kids meal, at best.  It didn't taste anything like beefaroni to us.  If it was called something else I might rate it higher, but had expectations of the real beefaroni, which it was not.

We really love this simple dish. I add corn to make it how I remember eating it when I was a kid.

Edit: I've also used mozzerella instead of cheddar and it's delicious that way too.

This is pretty good, but I adjusted it quite a bit based on other reviews and my own preferences.  I browned the beef with onions, peppers, and garlic then added a bit of worcestershire.  I chose to complete this on the stovetop, so I added 1 can of tomato sauce and a 15 oz can of stewed tomatoes to the beef even as the pasta cooked.    I used cavatappi and drained it a little shy of al dente, then added it to the heated beef and tomato mixture.  I let that warm up all together, added a little broth to keep it moist then served with cheeses on the side.  Personally, I mixed cheddar in and enjoyed it quite a lot.  My husband topped with parmesan and also enjoyed his variation.  I will likely make something like this again but I'll continue to adjust.  Thanks for a great base recipe though.

Excellent. I made a couple adjustments. I added salt, pepper, minced onion, garlic powder and oregano to the meat as it was browning. I used 2 cans of condensed tomato soup and one 8oz can of tomato sauce. Only used 1 cup of cheddar mixed in the hotdish and it was AWESOME! Great comfort food. Will make many, many times in the future! Thanks for the recipe.

Like others, I added diced onion, a shallot and some garlic to the ground beef.  Everything else did the same.   Surprisingly tasty and it came together easily on a weeknight.  I'm taking the leftovers for lunch today :-)

Fairly bland as written.  I made it a second time and browned the meat with sweet onions and 2 cloves of garlic. When mixing everything I added some Worcester sauce and some ketchup to give it a little more zip.  With these additions this is now a regular addition to our family's meals.

Because some reviewers said this was dry and bland, I used an additional can of tomato sauce, 1/2 pound of ground beef and sprinkled 3/4 cup cheese on top before baking.  Make sure you add plenty of your favorite spices, brown the meat with some minced onions and garlic powder, and it turns out wonderful!  Tastes even better the next day.

Easy to make. I chose to add some things, like minced garlic and some seasoning, but both my husband and I agreed that it "needs something." It was pretty bland, so we probably won't be making this again.

Yummy Yum Yum.. The only suggestions I would add to enhance the flavor is sauted green peppers, onions, and garlic.  I would also add mozarella and parmesan cheese when baking. For ease you could also add a jar of your favorite pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce.

I had to laugh.  The kids weren't too excited about dinner when they heard what I was making, but they wiped it out!  I did add some chopped bell pepper and onion to the ground beef simply because I needed to use up some odds and ends before they went bad.  Very simple, very filling, very delicious!

Very tasty and easy!   I didn't have enough tomato sauce, so I used one can of tomato soup, one small can of sauce and added half and half to the right consistency for sauce.  I also sauteed some chopped onion and garlic in butter and added a little worchestershire sauce.  Will make this again.  Even the kids love it.

I did what some others did I added chopped garlic, onions, and Italian seasonings into the ground beef while cooking, after I added the sauce it was delicious! I used only half of the pasta recipe called for which was enough. I added the cheese before I putting into the oven. I regret putting the pasta and meat mixture into the oven because it dried out the dish. Next time I'll just make Beefaroni on the stove and leave it at that.

Its funny how this made it to your table. My mom's mom was so poor and had very little to give to her own.So with out the cheese witch is a plus they had it often. And it followed her daughter and her kids and still to this day it is ask for often. I'm not sure if it was been out of love, are we just like it. Grats.. Picky 10 year old chef. Some great things are simple. And loved

i'm going to give this 4 stars as the recipe is written, but i think the way i made it tonight upped it to 5 stars for sure.  i added a can of drained diced tomatoes to make a chunkier sauce.  I also omitted the butter, i don't see the necessity for that.  just stir the pasta into the sauce immediately after draining and it won't stick.  i enjoyed the addition of cheese in this recipe and i think the seasonings are right on.

This is a great dish that is quick and easy. I make mine using onion and green pepper when browning the beef and I use garlic powder also. I also mix in a jar of spaghetti sauce. I also mix in chunks of velvetta cheese which melts great. I bake it in the oven and it always comes out great. Takes me back to my childhood, Thanks!

I gave this 3 stars because I'm kind of neutral.  I actually would have given it 3 1/2 if I could have.  Besides spicing the ground beef, I only made 2 alterations; Instead of using a 'package' of macaroni, I used 2 boxes of 'mac n cheese' noodles, and then added one packet of the cheese mixture to the noodles.  It helped a lot.  Also, As reccomended, I put ritz crackers on top (also used whole crackers instead of a spoon or fork).  I would recommend adding sour cream to this (my boyfriend agreed.. he also added tabascco for an extra kick).

I give this meal 4 stars, it's quick and easy on a crazy night, and it tastes really good!!  I'll spend the extra prep time for homemade beefaroni, it's much better than the stuff in the can!!  I did make one modification, I saute`ed onions in the meat as I browned it and it added a nice flavor, I could tell that it would be good w/out them but we're an onion family!!  Keep ground beef, shredded cheese and macaroni on hand and make this the next night that you didn't plan a meal or don't have time for what you planned, you won't be disappointed.  My husband seems to think that it would be good with sour cream added in at the last minute, or in each bowl if you have picky eaters, just a suggestion.  Thanx for a quick and easy last minute meal with a great taste!!!

This is a very versatile recipe that can easily be tweaked to your own personal tastes.  I followed the recipe as written, and it (to me) had too many noodles and not enough sauce.  Next time, I think I might decrease the noodles, add a layer of cheese on top, add some onion or spices and a can of veggies.  Thanks for a good recipe, Kelli!

My entire family loved it and asked me to make it again very soon. :-) I did make some changes as we like seasonings. 

I used 2 pounds of ground beef instead of 1 pound.  When cooking the beef I added chopped onions and garlic. For the sauce I used one can of herb tomato sauce and one can of plain tomato sauce. I added fresh basil, Italian seasoning,  fresh parsley, 1 green pepper, a tsp of sugar, chili powder, and a couple of bay leaves to the sauce. I warmed the sauce while the meat and macaroni were cooking. 

I also used a bit more cheese as I put some on top of the casserole. 

It was a huge hit!

It has been many years since I made this dish.  Because we love Italian, I added/changed a few things (this is the four star).  I sautéed onions in a separate pan along with minced garlic for the last minute.  Combined that with the ground beef (turkey is nice, too) and only used 1 can of tomato sauce along with 1 can of tomato paste and pesto as the sauce.  I had some fresh basil on hand and stirred that in as well and 8 oz of macaroni noodles.  On the top I sprinkled the shredded cheddar cheese along with shredded fresh mozzarella I had on hand and baked it in the oven for twenty minutes covered with aluminum foil at 350 degrees. Not a gourmet dish, but a standby staple in the kitchen to utilize ingredients which are on hand and so much better than that boxed stuff in the grocery store!

pretty good, I used ragu 3 cheese sauce and no need for the oven,
just add macaroni to the beef in a pot on the stove and your sauce 
and heat for 5 minutes. you can also add baby swiss cheese slices on top
in the pot instead of the cheddar and put a lid on for 5 to 10 minutes
and melt it.

I am fairly new to cooking, but I've been wanting to make this dish for quite a while now & honestly... I LOVE IT!!!!

Made this for dinner. Followed the recipe, except for 2 things. I used 1/2 the pasta it called for. I also added some steak seasoning to give the ground beef a little flavor. I added extra cheese on top, during the last 5 minutes of baking.

My boyfriend loved it! :)
It goes great with breadsticks!!!

I'm only putting down 4 stars till after we actually eat dinner!  I tasted a bit on the way into the oven, and thought it was pretty good.  I did make a few changes, though.  I sautéed onion in olive oil, adding a few cloves of garlic right before throwing the ground beef into the pan.  I didn't have 15 oz. cans of sauce - only 2 8 oz. ones on hand, so I also added a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes NOT drained.  I used a mix of cheese (a few different cheddars, some shredded mozzarella, and a good sprinkling of grated parmesan) because my daughter got into the cheddar while "helping" in the kitchen and there wasn't enough of it!  We're always of the opinion that more cheese is better, no matter what.  I also think there was probably more than 1.5 pounds of ground beef in the package I used, and with a whole box of macaroni... that's a HUGE casserole!  I have it baking covered with foil right now, and will uncover for the last 10 minutes.  Since I had less sauce, I didn't want to chance having it come out dry.  I have a VERY picky 10 year old, and if she eats this, it'll get 5 stars.

Really simple and yummy. We use ground turkey.  Not great as leftovers. The kids love it.

Not bad--just a basic casserole here, but easy and relatively quick.  The only macaroni I had in the house was a box of old macaroni and cheese, so I decided why not and made the mac and cheese, then mixed it up with everything else in the recipe. I did brown the meat with onions and garlic. Hubs commented that this is basically Hamburger Helper, but that didn't stop him from eating almost all of it in less than a day.  We have one serving left already, and I think it makes a lot of food!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night and while preparing it I kept thinking "great this looks so glad I'll probably be eating cereal for dinner" however it was quite a shocker! SO DELICIOUS! I used lean turkey, whole wheat pasta, and added just a little italian seasoning.  SO easy yet soooooooo delicious!!!

My four year old ate it up and I really liked how simple it was to make I did double the amount of cheese and the sauce as I read other reviews that said it was kind of dry. I also cooked the ground beef with onion and minced garlic !

I thought this recipe was pretty good (certainly better than any cafeteria Beefaroni I've ever eaten).  My 2 1/2 year old loved it and that's saying a lot because he doesn't normally like meat of any kind!

Used well broken spaghetti noodles, a little worcestershire sauce in the spaghetti sauce and used a little extra noodles/cheddar. Added garlic to the browned beef. Fit perfectly in a 9x13. I think the key to this recipe is to like your spaghetti sauce, the cheddar isn't going to transform it enough to make it taste good so season your spaghetti sauce well and make sure it isn't too acidic. Edit: The kids all ate this meal (5 children 9 and under) - my husband said next time he'd like to try this with macaroni noodles, some hot sauce and jalepenos in his. Thanks!

I agree with everyone else--this is definitely a starter recipe! We seasoned the heck out of the meat and used gouda cheese (because that was all we had on hand), and it still was lacking a little "something", so I can't imagine doing it as-is. However, it wasn't bad! I will definitely add it to my go-to list of quick dinners, and experiment more with spices. I used two cups of macaroni, which was PLENTY for two people, plus a leftover lunch or two. Also, I baked it for about five minutes just to see how it would go, and it dried out a little, but not too bad. If you decide to go the oven route (and I think it'd be fine either way), make sure to keep an eye on it, because it dries out FAST.

Very good!  My husband was looking on the website and came across this, so he asked me to make it for dinner. It makes a TON!! I followed it to a T except that I seasoned the meat with some garlic powder, and I didn't bake it since it was very moist right from the stove and I didn't want to dry it out by putting it in the oven.  It was an easy, great meal that made me feel like a kid again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing dish! Simple in that it doesn't involve too many ingredients. Tip: If your tomato sauce is closer to a tomato paste (heavier/less liquid-like) then add some water to it or else your beefaroni will turn out rather dry but still delicious=)  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was quite good.  I used 2 cups of elbow macaroni, and that was quite enough.  I also added some Emeril's essence while cooking the beef, and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  The recipe made enough to feed myself and my wife for two rather large dinners, and it was very good.  We WILL make this recipe again.

After reading the other ratings, I chose to use 12 ounces of pasta.  This was just the right amount.  I used one can of tomato sauce and half a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I added one clove of minced garlic and about 1/4 cup of chopped onions to the meat.  Even with these additions, I found it a little bland.  Overall, it was VERY simple to make and pretty tasty!  I don't have any children, but would imagine that this would be a really kid-friendly dish!

I loved this recipe. It was easy to follow. I made this because of the little bit of items being used. Of course to any recipe everyone will add more than what is on the recipe. All I added was spices. It came out great. I have a picky 2 1/2 year old and he ate it all.

Bland and dry. Very dry. I will not make this again. However, if I were to, I would not bake it. It's fine, or even better, just mixed together on the stove top.

This isn't gourmet, but that's fine by me and my family!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, but I did have marinara sauce, so I used that, and it was great.  I also used a cheese mixture that had cheddar, mozzarrella and monterey jack.  In future, I might use all whites cheeses because I find they are less greasy when they melt. White cheese like mozzarella also fits with the marinara.  I also didn't have macaroni noodles,so I used penne, which was just fine.  It came out almost like a baked ziti the way I made it.  Very good, basic recipe that's easy to change up!

My family really liked this, I was ok with it. I used 1.75lb hamburger, 3 cloves garlic, 1 small onion, grill mates seasoning. Did not have tomato sauce so I substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes and 3 tbs of paste. Used 1 c. cheddar, 1 c. mozzarella cheese. Baked about 30 mins. Husband is now on 3rd helping.

I made this as directed and it was really good. My 5-year old really liked it because "it wasn't too spicy". I thought there wouldn't be enough sauce, but when the cheese melted it contributed to the sauciness of the dish so it turned out well. Thanks, my son asked for me to make this "20 times" and I probably will!

My family loves this recipe, once I've modified it to fit our tastes. I diced a sweet yellow onion to cook with my ground beef, and made my spaghetti sauce from scratch with fresh tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes, and minced roasted garlic. I also added a can of tomato soup, not the condensed kind, but a good one. Then I added shredded carrots and broccoli, and I used colby jack cheese, and mild cheddar. This is a great recipe to modify to your tastes, probably never gets made the same way twice. I've done this a few times, and I add more to it every time.

this is ok--i only had a small can of tomato sauce, so i used a jar of 4 cheese pasta sauce. it came out tasty (my daughter and i both had two helpings), but the chunky sauce was un-beefaroni-ish. next time i'll make it with the plain tomato sauce. i also am thinking about slightly undercooking the pasta--it swells a lot during baking--which might require a bit more sauce.

This was good. I did, however, alter the recipe only a little. I added crushed garlic to the beef while it was browning, once it was browned, i added a whole can of diced tomatoes with their juice, and a sprinkle of lawry's seasoned salt, and i let it simmer until the juice from the tomatoes was pretty much evaporated. Then, I mixed all the ingredients before putting in the casserole, and sprinkled the top with mozzarella. yum. It was enough to serve 4 hungry adults. Very delicious. Will definitely try again, maybe next time, i will add cream cheese.

I make a slight variation of this recipe for my family.  I use 1 lb. ground turkey & 1/4 lb. ground turkey italian sausage.  I cook the meat with a little chopped onion, garlic, pepper and italian seasonings.  1 jar of pizza sauce and 1 8 oz. can of Basil, Garlic, Oregano tomato sauce.  I use Kraft Pizza Cheese (Mozarella & Cheddar).  3/4 of a package of elbow macaroni.  No butter.  I cut little stacks of pepperoni into quarters and mix it all together in a pan until the cheese is melted.  I don't bake it because all the ingredients are already cooked, but you can.

I agree with previous posters on some changes that really improve the dish. We add garlic and chopped onions to the meat as well as any other seasonings we have on hand (oregano, italian seasoning). We also substitute diced tomatoes for tomato sauce to add more chunkiness. We also replace regular pasta with whole wheat or multigrain pasta and it is just as great. I also reserve some of the cheese to put on top during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. Great, simple, easy-to-prepare meal that everyone I have served it to has loved.

I listened to others about adding onion, garlic and oreango. It still was unappetizing. There were way to many noodles. I only could use half the box. I would rather have the can. My husband couldn't even eat it.

This was okay.  For all the time and effort, the result was just about the same as what you would get out of can.  My picky 3 year old did not eat it.  I know I won't make this again.

My nephews could never get enough of this recipe. It was one of the few things that I make that they just don't complain about, and the little one is a very finicky eater! 

I can't wait till I get the correct corningware container so I can cook this for my friends here in college... they will flip over this one!!! Homecooked meals are a truly welcome sight here. ;)

My hubby and I do South Beach, so this was easy to modify just by using whole wheat pasta.  A little plain, but we both really liked it, and it make plenty for leftovers!

Thanks Kelli for a great recipe.  I also did some tweaking:  I used ground buffalo that I browned with a little Mrs. Dash, 8 oz can of sauce and a 12 oz can of diced tomato, which I added to the browned meat along with 1-1/2 tsp Italian seasoning and let simmer a bit, covered, while I cooked 1/2 pkg of the elbows.  Even the reduced fat cheddar cheese tasted good in this dish!  Next time I'll try adding the worcestershire sauce.

This dish was ok. I gave it four stars because, while IMO the original wasn't that tasty and the ratios of ingredient were not correct, it has a lot of potential. I would definately cut back on the macaroni; I didn't use all the macaroni it called for and I STILL had way too much. Personally, I think I will cut back on the beef, too, because I'm not a meat person. I will increase the amount of sauce next time. I knew the sauce would be bland, so I included a bit of onion and minced garlic and italian seasoning and garlic salt (and my secret ingredient in everything: soy sauce!). I think I will possibly add more onion next time, and maybe black pepper and other spices. The cheese didn't really melt into the sauce; it was still in chunks. I shredded cheese over the top, and it was a nice touch. This recipe was really flexible and open to a lot of personalization.

This is a great basic recipe easily adaptable to specific tastes.  After reading the reviews, I substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce and a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce; added garlic, oregano, and basil; and omitted the butter.  Fast and easy and I had the ingredients on hand!  After dinner, I emailed the recipe to my son in college.  Thanks!

Made this for a quick weeknight meal. I omitted the butter and added garlic and onion powders. Once I put this in the pan I realized it needed more sauce. I poured a can of Hunts Traditional Spaghetti Sauce over top and added another thin layer of cheese. Served with breadsticks and salad. This was an ok dish. Thank you.

Adults might think it's missing something, but I made this for kids and they LOVE IT! I used spaghetti sauce and skipped the butter. I think the cheddar cheese is great in this. Next time I might add a can of corn or peas to get the kids to eat their veggies. I will be making this often for my daycare kids.

With a couple of changes this was a really good recipe.  I changed the cheddar cheese to mozzarella and instead of plain tomato sauce, I used my own spaghetti sauce which basil and a little red pepeper, garlic and onion in it.  My husband loved it.

I did put a small onion and 1 garlic into it as well. I also sauted the onions and garlic before the beef and mixed it in the beef before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients. Loved it. My kiddos I babysit for also loved it.

I would've given it more stars but it sounded kind of plain.  I seasoned my beef, added ricotta cheese to the tomato sauce and added fresh  shredded Parmesan cheese. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out wonderful !!

I had made an inferior version of beef a roni previously, but it's so easy I wanted to take another shot. This one worked out much better, the kids loved it and asked me when I'm going to make it again, so mission accomplished.

I added salt and pepper to the ground beef, and then garlic salt and Italian seasoning to the mixture before I put it in the oven. I melted cheese on top right before I pulled it out of the oven. Needless to say, everyone loved it and there were no leftovers! Yum!

I always make this when the paycheck is wearing thin and it makes enough to last my fiancé and I until payday. It's delicious! The only different thing that I do is before I put the ingredients into a casserole dish, I mix everything in a big pot and get the sauce, meat, and cheese in there really good. After I put it in the fish, I put MORE cheese on top! It's so good ??

Fry a medium onion and a clove of garlic, both chopped, with the meat.  Drain the meat and add 2/3 cup beef broth (use a cube)the tomato sauce and some spice.  1tsp of Oregano should work.  Simmer until slightly reduced.  Add the buttered pasta and 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar.  Turn into a 8x8" pan and top with 1/2 cup of Parm (real, not shake).  Bake and enjoy.

The recipe sounded a little bland so I added a few things like chopped bell pepper and onion, sliced some Conecuh sausage,  and used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also added a packet of chili seasoning to my sauce before adding the pasta. I bought shells instead of elbows by mistake, sprinkled some shredded Cheddar cheese on top and baked as directed. My family went wild! Very good!

Thanks for sharing! This was a simple recipe, although I just couldn't use salt and pepper...too bland. When I cooked the ground beef I added minced garlic, dattle pepper hot sauce (just a hint), all-purpose seasoning and goya seasoning. I add goya too alot of dishes for extra flavor. It turned out great! It was seasoned well and tasted great. Don't think it would of been as good if I just used salt and pepper, so I kicked it up a notch!

This recipe is so yummy! I changed a few things though. I seasoned my hamburger with garlic salt. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top before I topped it all with, my favourite, colby jack shredded cheese. Currently enjoying this delightful creation :)

Perfect.  I use a lot of garlic a lot of onions . Cooked and season them well first before adding the beef . Seasoned the beef then drain them . Put it all back in the pan then add the tomato sauce and half cup of water and cooked it and seasoned it to my taste ( a bit of chilli and sugar . Salt. Pepper . Italian seasoning ) then add the elbow Mac in . Taste it and it was great . Add a table spoon of butter the have a nice butter flavor . Put in baking pan and add 2 layers of chaser cheese ( 1 in middle , 1 on top ) baked for 30 min.. Came out super flavorful and tasty ... If it taste good before it has cheese on it then it will taste great after you bake it with cheese . Don't forget

I knew this would be bland just by reading the recipe.  I added chopped onion that I browned with the beef and I subbed a can of petite cut tomatoes with roasted garlic and olive oil for one can of tomato sauce......still  bland.  The next day I added some corn and black olives.   A little better, but needs major tweaking.  My kids would have loved this when they were toddlers.

I always mix the tomato sauce with 1 can of campbell's cream of mushroom.  I also use wide egg noodles instead of elbo macaroni.  I ate this a lot growing up and I make it for my husband and he loves it.

I was looking for an easy recipe for a Sunday dinner which this is.  I sautéed some onion along with browning the beef for some added oomph, but it was still on the bland side.

This was a great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I made some changes based on others reviews and the due to me having high blood pressure. First let me start my saying I never measure unless I am baking. Here are my changes; I subbed ground beef for ground turkey. I sautéed some onion and green pepper before browning the meat. I used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. I seasoned with Ms. Dash (blood pressure), garlic, Italian seasoning and fresh basil. I put down one layer of beefaroni then added cheese. I did this for two layers. It was really yummy.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I did add green peppers and a little garlic powder. I also add a can of whole tomatoes, cut up. My husband, who dislikes casseroles in general, loves this and requests it often. It reheats in the microwave like a dream.

This is the 2nd time I have made this recipe. 1st time followed recipe exactly as written- kind of bland. This time seasoned the meat (1 1/2 lbs) with lots of garlic, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, etc. Used two cans of Hunts Garlic & Onion pasta sauce- which I did not season at all. 2 cups cheddar mixed with pasta and meat/ sauce. Then 2 cups cheddar on top last ten minutes of cooking. Made a big difference in flavor. Everyone loved it.Will def be making again- mabe using a little more sauce next time so leftovers aren't as dry.

Not sure who liked this more, the kids or hubby! ;) I did add some fresh minced garlic to meat when cooking it along with some other spices. I noticed it got a little dry in the oven too. Next time I will just throw the cheese in the pan and let it be done stove top. Great quick meal that everyone seemed to love. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a huge hit with my entire family....my 16 month old devoured and my 6 year old said that I was the best cook ever!  I did add a can of roasted tomatoes and sprinkled extra cheddar on top.  Next time, I might do this as a chili flavor!!!

Found this recipe last night and it was an instant hit! My kids couldn't get enough and devoured it in no time. We have a family of 5 and I recalculated for 16 servings. That wasn't enough because my son couldn't get enough and ate more than the rest of us.  And he's the picky eater!

I made this last new years eve for the boy and he loved it.  I personally did not notice the cheddar at all though.  It was pretty good, but I wouldn't make it again unless requested.

This recipe was okay.  I did take the advice of others to add extra flavoring and I think it helped.  NOt sure that I'd make again.  But, it is something you can throw together in a bind with ingredients you probabaly already have in the cabinets.

A quick and tasty meal! However I did as the others, kicked it up a notch. I browned the meat with onion and three different types of bell peppers. I used Italian seasoning and wild garlic (in German Bärlauch) to season the sauce. I omitted the butter and used mozzarella instead of cheddar due to not being able to find it here in Germany. And of course I used salt and pepper. I would definitely make it again.

Made this for a PICKY ten year old boy who complained and complained while I cooked but really liked it despite himself.  I used rice noodles to make it gluten-free and marinara sauce for a few more veggies. He gave it a 3.5 stars.

I thought the kids would love this recipe, but instead they found it kind of bland.  I followed recipe exactly except for browning the ground beef with a little garlic and onion.

This is a good recipe but tastes exactly like Hamburger Helper in my opinion. Next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and add vegetables and more seasoning to the beef.

Will definitely make this again. I used 1/2 whole wheat pasta for a healthy kick and did as others suggested and used spaghetti sauce for more flavor. I will definitely do this one again, but want add more fresh veggies next time.

This was definitely one of the best meals I have prepared! Two healthier choices I made were using lean ground beef and omitting the butter (though one less healthier thing I did was add a whole package of cheddar cheese instead of just 4 cups). It tasted even better than it looks, and on the side I served corn, garlic bread, and sweet iced tea. Plus, it tastes even better as leftovers! I cooked the cold casserole a tiny bit in a frying pan and added a mixture of mild and sharp cheddar cheeses, as the cheese it is originally baked with eventually completely melts into the pasta. Yum!!

I cooked onion with some olive oil, drained the oil and left it in the strainer.  I cooked the beef, drained the grease. Then sauteed the onion with some garlic with the beef.  I used 16oz tomato sauce and the rest some leftover tomato basil pasta tomato sauce (had chunks of tomato, the pre made sauce).  I used two cups of shredded cheddar cheese and mixed it with the cooked noodles, tom sauce, and beef, and then toped with another 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  So EASY. so GOOD.

I give this five stars because it's a simple weekday meal, and the recipe can be memorized so when grocery shopping you can pick up the basic items. I've changed it around of course, adding some green bell peppers while cooking the meat, adding spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and different kinds of cheeses. I also change the noodles up a bit instead of just macaroni all the time. It's yummy and it's always a hit.

This was good and just what I needed to throw what I had in the house together. I did add onion and garlic pepper. Only one can of sauce and a cup of marinara sauce for extra flavor. I also added peas. Baked for 20min and then added cheese to the top and baked for 10min longer. My husband enjoyed it and so did my 2 year old.

I made some additions to this recipes I added the Worchestire sauce, Italian seasoning, red pepper, garlic powder, garlic salt.  I added green peppers and onions.  Instead of using the tomato sauce I used a can of the Traditional spaghetti sauce.  I don't drain all of the grease out of the meat, because draining takes away from the taste of the meat(leaving it very dry). After adding the green peppers and onions plus the sauce, I added some brown sugar without it, it left a bland taste.  I layered by putting the meat on the bottom then the pasta, cheese, meat.  I let it cook through about 20 minutes then topped it off with the cheddar cheese and let it cook about another 10-15 minutes.  This was a delicious recipe once these additions were made. My kids love it and so did I. A+++

This is a decent base recipe but it was really bland as is. I made it a second time and simmered the saucee with some minced onion and garlic and oregano. I used a little more cheddar cheese since that's what we prefer. Like I said, a good base recipe. I just tweeked it to our taste is all.

Good base recipe.  I followed it and added my usual spices- garlic, garlic powder, chili powder, red pepper powder, cumin, soy sauce, pepper, and worchester sauce.  I also didn't bake it, because we were hungry and the ingredients were cooked anyways.  But the boyfriend said "This is good."  and we ate all the leftovers.

This wasn't too bad.  Nothing very exciting and my kids didn't enjoy this very much. I did add a little italian seasoning, and onion powder to the tomato sauce, which seemed to help give it some more flavor, but it still seemed to lack something. I added a little pat of butter  to my own plate, which I enjoyed more. I  will try to improve on this recipe. It is a good start.

Great recipe.  I used McCormick Taco seasoning with ground turkey.  I put some Frenches French Fried onion rings on top about 5 minutes before it was finished.  The kids loved it.

I took the advice of others and added onion/garlic to meat, and only used about 12 oz. of pasta. It turned out very good. Next time I will probably add some italian seasoning for a little added flavor.

I think this recipe lends itself well to alterations/additions. I used 1 pound of ground sirloin, a jar of Tomato and Basil spaghetti sauce, and added 3 cloves of minced garlic and onion powder to the meat while it was browning. I also added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and 1.5 tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce. I also used 11-12 oz of pasta instead of 16, since I prefer more saucy pasta dishes. With these changes, it was quite tasty.

This was really good! I didn't really change much...just cooked the beef in a basil infused canola oil for extra flavor and added a couple of seasonings. Very easy to make and would definitely make it again!

I substituted a diced one lb. keilbasa sausage for the ground beef and added a can of diced tomatoes with peppers and one jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  Tasty!

I really didn't like this recipe.  I thought it had no flavor - after I cooked it and we started to eat it, I dumped Spaghetti sauce over the remaining in the pot to give it some flavor.  It was to bland for me.

I used 1 can of tomato sauce and then spaghetti sauce for the rest. I also added fresh minced garlic and used mozzarella instead of cheddar. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a great basic recipe.  I added some Worcestershire sauce. I added a whole bell pepper, 1/2 vidalia onion, 1 garlic clove, and some basil to the hamburger and cooked that all together.  Instead of 2 cans on tomato sauce, I used some spaghetti sauce and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Throw some mozzarella cheese on top at the end

I've made this twice now and I just can't seem to find what's missing in this. I've added a chopped up onion,2 cloves of garlic and even added italian seasonings but there's still something missing.It sure is quick and easy to make though.

This is a great make ahead meal for those busy evenings when you just need to throw something into the oven. The recipe didn't call for many seasonings but I used quite a few to liven this up a bit. I also left out the butter as I didn't see the need for it. Quick, easy and definitely kid friendly. Thanks Kelli!

I used to make this for my kids all the time. The only difference is I didn't use the butter, I did use more chopped meat and just for a change, sometimes I put grated mozzerella cheese on top.  This recipe is even better the second night.  I love this recipe.
