This was very good, lots of taste.  I halved the recipe for the 2 of us.  Also, after adding the soy/sugar mixture I added a little water, covered and steamed it to be a little more tender.  Lastly added the lemon juice and toasted almonds. -Susie

Hubs made this for us tonite - left out the sugar and forgot the ginger.  Nevertheless, or maybe because of it, this will make a broccoli lover out of ANYbody.  Make this exactly as directed...except leave out the sugar and maybe "forget" to include the ginger.

This recipe has so much flavor and is so good. I had some extra stuff around that i added. I put in some shredded chicken soaked in soy sauce, green peppers, and celery.  I only used about 3 cups of broccoli and then served it over brown rice.  It was so great!

I have tried a large number of recipes on this site, and I believe this is the first vegetable side dish that I've given 5 stars. I made the recipe as is, and it is the best broccoli that I have ever tasted. Thanks!

This was an easy, tasty broccoli dish that, as promised, retained it’s beautiful green color.  Leftovers, however, did not fare well with broccoli and almonds alike turning an unsightly soy sauce color.  If you are a broccoli lover, you probably won’t have leftovers anyway!

This was a very good dish. It was easy to make and had a great, full flavor. I love serving fresh, healthy vegetable and get tired of the 'same ol same ol.' This definitely was a good change. I might sub the almonds for sesame seeds. But it is't necessary.

This was easy to put together and tasted good. I halved the recipe to suit two people tonight. I also drizzled soy sauce (eye-ball the measurements), sprinkled sugar and then I squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over the broccoli before serving. I also garnished with a sprinkle of toasted almonds. This is a tasty and nice way to dress up broccoli. Loved the toasted nuts, hint of lemon, soy sauce and slight sweetness. I served this with, "Amber's Sesame Stir-fry," and "Orange Rice Medley," also from this website.

I made this nearly exactly as written, and wasn't extremely impressed with the results, but it wasn't too bad, either. I was out of white sugar, so I used brown instead. I also accidentally used a whole tsp. of ginger instead of half...but even so, the ginger wasn't overpowering or anything. My 1 year old sister really loved this...but everyone else thought it was just okay. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I don't think I'll make it again, but I am glad I tried it this one time.

Good but nothing out-of-this-world.  Made as listed but added water as suggested.  A bit too crunchy for my husband who likes softer broccoli.

a stirfry that is robust and flavorsome rather than delicate and subtle. Used sesame oil, skipped lemon juice, added thin sliced baby corn strips for texture and a generous sprinkling of chilli flakes to balance the sweetness.

This was a fantastic way to make broccoli! I halved the recipe since there was only 2 of us (but kept the amt of garlic the same, LOVE garlic!!)The only thing I did differently was I steamed the broccoli in the microwave for about a minute before putting them in the pan, this made the texture/crispness absolutely perfect!

Wow! For so simple of ingredients, I am very (pleasantly) surprised at how tasty the sauce is.  I always try to put a million ingredients in my stir fry sauces.  Anyways, everything came together beautifully and the almonds were the perfect compliment.

I served this to "vegetable haters" who positively raved over this recipe.  What a great balance of flavors and textures!  I have also made this with a baby carrot / broccoli floret mix, but the carrots take a bit more cooking time.  BEST OF ALL?  A very easy recipe.  Also works with Splenda instead of sugar.

Easy, Simple, and Delicious. Everyone loved it! The almonds give it a nice flavor and texture....just make sure not to burn them when you toast them or they will taste...well, burnt.

Very good!  I didn't add the lemon and almonds but will try next time.
