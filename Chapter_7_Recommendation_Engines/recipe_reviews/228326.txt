These waffles were great, my entire family loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time, I will probably add about 2 tablespoons of palm sugar (to go with the coconut theme) since the waffles had no sweetness what so ever.  I will also reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 t or even 1/4 t since it was salty to my liking.  Also, after carefully measuring out my canned coconut milk, I realized that 1.75 C of coconut milk (I guessed it but I had to be sure) was exactly a can of coconut milk so people who are making this in the future can just pour it directly into the bowl.  I will also sift spelt flour in the future.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!!! My only change was to use quinoa flour to make these gluten free and they were by far the best gf waffles I have made. Served with real maple syrup, they don't need any sugar in the recipe. Thanks :)

These are really good waffles. I had to substitute the flour for a gluten free blend and added 2 Tbs palm sugar to sweeten them up a bit. Everything else was the same. Served them covered in fresh strawberries, whip cream and toasted coconut flakes.  Best gf waffles yet!!!

These waffles are excellent! You cannot taste the coconut milk. I added milk (about 1 cup), 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 2 tsp blackstrap molasses. I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp and baking soda to 1 tsp; as I do not like to taste baking powder. They were very light, fluffy and crispy. My kids loved them too.

Love this recipe. I used 1/3 buckwheat flour to 2/3 spelt to reduce the gluten level. Also we use the canned coconut milk with solids rather than a boxed coconut milk “beverage”. Also, don’t confuse the coconut water beverages with coconut milk. Completely different product!

I made the spelt version and a gluten free version . They were amazing. No sugar needed. I had everything needed on hand. Great recipe.
