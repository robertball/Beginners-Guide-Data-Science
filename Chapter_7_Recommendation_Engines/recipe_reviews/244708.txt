This is definitely a five star keeper! It's so simple, you probably have all the ingredients at home and it's easy to make. I used vegetable broth and basmati rice. Between the butter and broth and roasted vegetables there was enough flavor that I didn't need to add salt or seasoning.

This was so good!! I made a few slight changes to mine, though. I opted for the faster route and used instant rice, added a little pepper, parsley and basil. It was perfect! I also made this a second time the exact same way, but made it with tacos, so I added one can of diced tomatoes with chiliâ€™s and it was INCREDIBLE. So simple and so good!

This was really good. I added shredded parmesan cheese at the time of serving.

Family & I thought this dish could use more seasoning and the cook time was off by 40 min for us, since its based on the type of long grain rice you use. We used long grain brown rice for the recipe, hence the darker rice color.  We added chopped chives at the end too for a pop of color and flavor.

I did add scallions after the fact. It was a big hit with my family and will definitely be making again!
