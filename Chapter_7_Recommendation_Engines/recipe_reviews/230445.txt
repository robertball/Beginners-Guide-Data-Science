This was a really good recipe and my guests enjoyed the cheesecake very much. If I make this again though I would not bother with the sour cream topping. Instead I think I would try to make a seasonal topping- perhaps a sauce with dried cranberries or at least a raspberry or strawberry sauce. Yummy!

Absolutely disgusting.  Worst recipe I've made off the internet. Cost was closer to $1.85 each.  

I'm not a newbie to baking and this recipe was easy to understand and follow.

I used every listed ingredient in the correct volumes and made it to the letter.

Repugnant, vile garbage.  I can't speak to those who gave it a higher rating, but I suspect they lied.

Wouldn't recommend.

Great recipe. I doubled it for a work party, but managed to get enough filling for 3 cakes.
