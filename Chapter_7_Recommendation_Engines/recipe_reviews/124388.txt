Oh my is this stuff ever good!!! And, it really brings back memories because my Grandma Jean used to make homemade applesauce all the time and it was incredible!  Well, tonight I was making her "double breaded pork chops" and nothing but homemade applesauce would do for a side dish. I doubled this recipe using 4 large Granny Smith apples and threw in a couple Red Delicious for good measure.  I also added 1/2 cup of water.  It took about an hour in the oven and was very easy to mash with a fork. The house smelled great as it was baking and while it might not be my Grandma's according to my husband - "it was awesome"!

I always boil the cores and shavings of the apples in order to do Agua de Manzana (Apple Water), as we call it in Peru. I also pure, through a siever, some of this in the applesauce if necessary. I am the kind that uses the whole product if possible.

I loved this. It will go perfect with hubbies oatmeal. I used a mix of Splenda & Brown Sugar Splenda. Added in my homemade pumpkin pie spice. Drained a bit of the juice. It's so good! I did use 4 gala apples.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I added about 1 t ginger, 1/4 t cardamom, 1/4 t nutmeg and used honey in place of some of the sugar...oh, and the above amounts are for a nearly tripled recipe - I had a lot of apples on hand!  I just ate some over ice cream - delicious!

For almost sixty years my family has loved my applesauce.  But this recipe went over the top!  I will probably never make it the "old" way again.  Everyone went nuts over this recipe.  Thanks much, Mary.

The only change I made was substituting brown sugar for half of the sugar.  This was a hit at Christmas dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Soooo good! Made this today to serve alongside tomorrow night's dinner (I'm making Cathleen Bushman's cinnamon pork tenderloin - it's marinating right now!). The two will pair nicely together! I like the fact that this makes a small amount. I usually purchase apples to keep on hand for snacking, and at any time will have at least two on "stand-by." It's now easier than ever to turn them into homemade applesauce, not to mention there are sooo many uses for it - as a healthy snack, a side to go with dinner or a dessert (think ice cream topping... yum) to name a few. My apples cooked perfectly in 45 minutes. A slight mush with my potato masher produced a beautiful, chunky applesauce. I can't WAIT to take more than a "test" bite of this tomorrow! NOTE: You MUST eat this warm... PERIOD! Thanks for reminding me of my favorite time of year, Mary! This will forever be a repeat at my house. :-)

Our family is applesauce snobs because my mother-in-law's homemade applesauce is so delicious, we can't even look at store-bought anymore.  I made this recipe for my in-laws this week, and they loved it - it got rave reviews from the queen herself.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Well my boyfriend's mother used to make homemade applesauce for him all the time, but he hasn't seen her in years. I made him this and he loved it, I only got a few spoonfuls but I loved it too. Thanks for helping me to make his day! Enjoy the recipe I know I did, and will again.

Made in crock pot for family party, to accompany grilled pork chops. Followed recipe exactly, though I did multiply ingredients to yield 20 servings.  I sprayed crock pot with pam spray and started pot on low until apples had rendered some juice.  then I stirred it and turned to high.  I served a little warmer than room temp (because that's how we like our apple sauce).  I thought the sugar proportions were just right.  Perhaps this is because I used tart (granny smith) apples. I didn't have to mash the apples, they broke apart when I stirred them.  This made the kitchen smell fantastic while it was cooking.  I will make this again. thanks!

I added 3 T of brandy and used only 1/2 the sugar.  I used 2 each of 3 different types of apples.  It was a tiny bit boring but - aside from all the peeling - super easy to make, so I'll make it again.  I think next time I will stick with the more tart varieties of apples (more granny smith).

This was far too sweet.  I thought 3 tbsp of sugar per apple sounded like too much, so did 1.5 tbsp per apple--but it was still horribly sweet.  Next time I would use 1/2 tbsp of sugar per apple.  Or maybe just lightly sugar the tops of the apples before baking.

I'm not sure why someone suggested adding water. I did and it did not need it - I had to drain it out in the end. A bit sweet, I will use less sugar next time, but still good.

I would give more stars if I could! I made a larger batch using 10 apples of all different varieties that we just picked. Let's put it this way, I burned my mouth (more than once) "tasting" this after it came out of the oven. I almost dont want to give it to the kids b/c I know they will gobble it up! Cant wait to make this for thanksgiving!

So delicious and easy. It baked in the oven, while I prepared the rest of dinner. I had 4 medium sweet apples, so I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla and used just 2 Tbl. of sugar (didn't really need the sugar at all). We had some by itself, and also spooned some over vanilla ice cream. Perfect autumn treat!

I doubled the sugar cinnamon and vanilla extract since I was using 5 apples. It ended up being a little too sweet for me, but my 4 year old couldn't get enough! Definitely very tasty and definitely serve warm! Yummy!

Wow!!! We had a bunch of mixed "mystery" apples from our apple picking outing going bad and decided to give homemade applesauce a try. I used at least a half a dozen, then tried to guesstimate the spice quantities. This is probably one of those "forgiving" recipes - just do what you think looks right! I used Truvia instead of sugar and added a little bit of cloves into the spice mixture. Delicious!

Delicious. I used 2 granny smith, 1 gala, 1 honey crisp. I also left about 10% of the skin on. Made a double batch with pumpkin pie spice and fresh grated nutmeg instead of only cinnamon. Mashed in a bowl with potato masher. Very Very good recipe, thanks Mary.

I made this applesauce and it was amazing. My mother, grandmother and husband all thought it was too sweet though. I think they are just used to store-bought applesauce. My uncle, brother and I all loved it though.  I'll be making it again, but I'll probably use half the sugar and cinnamon just to appease the other people in the house. :)

This is the best applesauce that I have made so far. I think that baking is the key instead of boiling. (I learned that while making my own baby food).

Simple and delish!  I use xylitol instead of sugar (and lower the amount, because apples are already naturally sweet) to lower the glycemic load.  It makes a wonderful dessert, although I have to multiply the recipe, because my family wants more, more, more.  Good problem to have, I suppose.  It's great with pork on a Fall evening and makes the house smell wonderful.

I adjusted this recipe using 10 apples and it was delicious.  I was a little skeptical when I was sprinkling the sugar on that it may be too sweet. It was fine! I consider it more of a dessert than a side dish for a meal.  My husband said it tasted like an apple pie and that's the best way to describe it. I don't have a potato masher so I just used my electric mixer to mix it up to the right consistency. Try this one, you won't be sorry!!!!!!

This was AMAZING!! I wanted an applesauce that reminded me of "fall" and this hit the spot! :) I did have to put them back into the oven because the apples were still hard when the bake time was over. I went out and bought more apples today to make lots of it tomorrow to can! I think I'm going to try it in the slow cooker to see how it turns out. The house will smell sooo yummy! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Great applesauce, and so easy! I scaled this recipe for 10 apples and used over half of it in the baked apple pies from this site.I took the rest to work the next day.  I didn't have a hand masher so I used a meat cleaver! Whatever works! I also added a little brown sugar which I probably won't use next time. It was so sweet. Sooo good! Will definitely make again.

Wow, this was AMAZING! I sliced the apples thinly and added slightly more vanilla and cinnamon  than the recipe calls for. When I took it out of the oven, I mashed it very lightly and then left it. I actually liked this with big chunks/slices. I made more apple slices/chunks than applesauce, but it was a huge hit! Sooo delicious. Just to note, this uses a LOT of apples. The recipe calls for 2 large apples for 2 servings, but I think it's more like 4 large apples for 2 servings.

I grew up with baked apples and was actually looking for a recipe for them when I found this and decided to give it a go... Very much the same and quite yummy... I used about 1/2 the sugar and added raisins.  I've made it twice in a week - having peeled the skin once, and not the next and can't decide which I prefer... it's a keeper !

I liked the addition of the vanilla. I didn't like the omission of other spices I normally use in applesauce (ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice). I subbed brown sugar for what I can only assume is white sugar (since it doesn't actually specify, I guess it might not have been a sub). Though I diced my apples very finely and baked longer than 45 minutes, then let them wait in the turned-off oven, my apples were still fairly firm. Not a problem for me, as I like them any way they come, but others may want to cook them a bit longer before mashing. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe worked perfectly. I only did 2 things differently. I did not add sugar and then I blended the mixture in a food processor. I wanted to use it as a replacement for oil in recipes so this worked better for me

This tasted more like apple pie filling than applesauce, but was ok just not what I had expected.

In a word... FABULOUS!  I used 5 apples (2 Red Delicious and 3 Ambrosia), 5 tablespoons of Splenda, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground clove and 1/3 of a freshly grated nutmeg nut along with a splash of vanilla extract.  I checked it at the 30 minute mark and gave it a goooooood stir.  When it was all baked (45 minutes) I gave it another gooooooo stir then used the immersion blender to make it smoother but left it rather chunky since that's the way I like it.  Again, in a word... FABULOUS!

Made this last night with roasted Pork Loin.  My husband always said that pork makes his stomach hurt.  I remember hearing that if you eat apples with pork it aids with the digestion.  Besides tasting awesome he said that this was the trick and the pork loin didn't cause him any stomach aches what-so-ever.   I'm not sure what variety of apple I used.  We live in Okinawa and I just have to buy what they have on the shelf when it comes to apples.  Most of the apple varieties here are different than anything I've ever seen before.  I have yet to find what I would consider a tart apple.  Regardless, this recipe is awesome!  Try it with some pork chops or a roasted pork loin!

I made this for Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and it was a hit!  I adjusted the recipe and used 6 apples of different varieties (granny smith, honey crisp, fuji, etc.).  I also used half regular sugar and half brown sugar.  I didn't mash the apples after it was cooked.  I left them chunky to serve as a baked apple side dish.  It was easy and tasted awesome!  I plan to make again for Thanksgiving.

I had some apples that were a little too mealy for eating out of hand, so I needed something to do with them. I didn't notice that we were supposed to cover the baking dish, so I added a little bit of cider with ten minutes or so left and covered it with tin foil. I served it very chunky with a drop of heavy cream. A big hit with a group of hungry actors!

Kids had so much fun with this one!  I think the flavor was much better than a traditional boiled recipe.  The flavor was intense!  I would cut back on the sugar, it definently didn't need as much.  We cut our apples in rings using a corer + knife.  Will be making this again and again!  Try using it as a desert filling or in pie or as we did with a crumb topping, vanilla ice cream, and caramel sauce!

I made this applesauce today for a recipe and we couldn't stop eating it. My kids and I both loved it. I just threw it in the food processor after it was done baking, and it was the perfect consistency. Thanks for the recipe, I will be using it often.

This is a great recipe. I added some cloves and ginger just because I made it first during Christmas time. It will probably be my primary recipe now.

So simple.  So fabulous.  I have shared this recipe with several friends and relatives and they all rave about it.  The only change make is to decrease the sugar to 2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons.  Be sure to spray or grease the baking dish well.  Perfect!!!

Awesome recipe and so easy to make. I made this dish as a side for thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I added ripe pears to the mix for the last 10 minute of baking. It added a nice flavor and made it go further. Highly reccomend trying this dish!

It was a little too sweet for us, but it was so easy!!!! I told my husband I doubt I'll ever BUY applesauce again.
I served it with baked pork chops and acorn squash. The apples were so soft I'm sure if I had stirred them in the casserole they would have made sauce, but I left them as is. Thanks for sharing!

My 3 yr old and 2 yr old were licking their bowls clean.  I'm going to make up a huge batch this week.  I may never buy storebought again.  The apples mashed perfectly after baking I just used a fork.

My 18 month old goes crazy for this! I cut down on the sugar a bit. Great to pair with ranch pork chops or just eat a bowl on it's own. thank you for sharing!

Very good. I was lazy and didn't want to dig out my apple peeler so I did it by hand. I won't do that again my hand was hurting quite a bit by the time I was done. I will just make sure to dig out the peeler next time I make it. I am not a fan of store bought applesauce but I love homemade sauce.

This is the first thing I make when the apples come into season and we've made a day trip to the country orchard.  I find that with a nice mix of "baking" apples, I can reduce the sugar.  I also leave the chunks really large to retain some "lumpiness" in the sauce.  The vanilla is a must!  I make a huge batch in a roasting pan to share with neighbors.  THE BEST!!!
