This smells amazing while cooking and tastes even better. I really dislike walnuts so I used almonds and also used mini chocolate chips. Since there are only 2 of us I made 4 small loaves( this changed the cooking time to 40 mins.) I absolutely love both cherries and chocolate and this is the “ bread” for you! Glad I made small loaves or it would all be gone!  Yum!!

This came out even better than I expected!  10x better than banana bread!!  The recipe calls for plain yogurt but I used french vanilla and it was fantastic.

This loaf is yummy! I had to find a use for some mediocre cherries and this bread was exactly what I needed. I followed the recipe with a couple of minor edits: I didn’t have walnuts on hand so I increased the chocolate chips and cherries a bit and I did not use the frosting. The loaf is so moist and delicious! I love the flavor combo - something new. I ate is as dessert last night and with coffee for breakfast this morning.

Disappointing!  For starters, the cake turned blue!  I read that some brands of baking powder can cause that.   If I were to make it again (doubtful) I would leave out the chocolate.  It didn't seem to go with the cherry flavor even though I usually like that combination.  I made it in 3 smaller pans and adjusted the baking time accordingly.   I also substituted almonds for the walnuts just because of personal preference.

Didn't make any changes.  The chocolate overpowered the cherries.  Maybe because of the type of cherries.  I was given cherries from Traverse City, MI.

I always like Chef John's recipes.  This recipe was fabulous.  Made it just as read. When I make it again, I'll be sure to have a cherry pitter as he had suggested in his video.  A photo is attached, but we've already been into the loaf.  It's almost gone!  Next, I think I will try his Banana Bread recipe.

Just didn't seem to have the flavor I thought it should. Could taste the chocolate but cherries got loss. Maybe a tart cherry is the answer.

The combination of cherries, chocolate, and walnuts is delicious.  I followed the bread recipe as written (I did use chocolate chips), but instead of the glaze, I sugared the loaf pan (same method as flouring a pan, but use sugar instead of four).  That gave a slightly sweet taste to the browned sides of the loaf.  I served it for dessert, but I'll make it for a brunch soon.

This was good but not great. Considering the time it took to pit the cherries it just wasn't worth it. I'll stick to chocolate chip banana bread!
