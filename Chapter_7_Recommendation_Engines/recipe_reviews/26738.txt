I'm sorry, but I find it really rude to rate a recipe 2 stars because one of the ingredients ''isn't something you would use''.  The rating system is for recipes you have actually tried. Giving a recipe you haven't tried 2 stars because one of the ingredients isn't to your liking is just wrong.

i've made this for years but my version is a little easier & healthier:  put 1 block lite cream cheese in bowl, stir together w/shredded chicken, green onions, and a smidge of milk just so it's a little "stirrable" (no butter) - sprinkle garlic salt on top of puffs before baking.  excellent on their own OR with chicken gravy!  yum!  talk about comfort food!!

I have had to make these by request for almost every gathering since I first discovered them over 3 years ago! They are fairly easy and make a good traveling snack too! I've sent them along with my husband in the cooler for fishing trips, the guys LOVE them cold right out of the cooler! One thing I can suggest to make them easier is to not worry about the shape of your finished puff. By the time they rise in the oven they are all pretty symmetrical. Just be careful not to get the filling on the outside and be sure to pich the seals together good.

These were just too good to be true!! SOOO Delicious!! My suggestions is for the crescent rolls:  By enough cans so that the amount equals 30 ounces, and then buy an extra can.  That way, you won't run out of dough before running out of chicken mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make these again

I have made these for years but with a few slight differences.  I use chive and onion cream cheese.  I also saute mushrooms with garlic and toss it in the mixture as well.  I omit the butter.

I have been making these for a long time!  I use 3 good size bone in breasts, boil them for about 15 to 20 min's, then shred when cooled.  I chop an onion into small pcs (not minced), saute them in butter and add salt and pepper. ( I do not add butter to the cream cheese just with the onions to saute and then just poor it all into the crm chz mixture) Add to chicken in a bowl with 1 large cream cheese and mix together, then bundle them in the crescents.  Brushing them with egg white gives them a nice shine.  The onions make ALL the difference!!!!

This was delicious. I used garlic and basil while cooking the chicken and added it into the cream mixture. Also, this may seem like a no-brainer, but let the chicken cool a bit before you mix it with the cream as mine got really melty and it was hard to get them into the dough. They still turned out great tho!

They now sell solid sheets of crescent dough, so you don’t have to press the individual rolls together. Cut each sheet into 4 pieces, makes it a lot easier to use. Also, line your pans with parchment paper for easier cleanup, should you have any leaks. I make these with the chicken, onion and garlic, and then add frozen chopped spinach (defrosted and squeezed dry), mixed with parmesan cheese and enough mayonnaise to moisten. I don’t use cream cheese or butter. I often use a Calzone filling, of onion, bell pepper and crumbled Italian sausage (cooked & well drained) mixed with pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Cubed ham, broccoli and Swiss cheese is also good. You can substitute just about any combination of cooked meat, vegetables and cheese, mixed with enough mayonnaise, sour cream, or any type of sauce to moisten; even creamed soup (undiluted)) will work. Served with a salad, makes a nice dinner or cut into quarters for an appetizer. And don’t forget dessert, use fresh fruit, sliced and mixed with sweetened cream cheese. Drizzle baked and cooled puffs with a simple powdered sugar glaze. The possibilities are endless!

I used canned chicken breast because it's much easier! I've also made this recipe using garlic flavored crescent rolls, and it turns out great too...very easy, and still good as leftovers!

5 stars!!!  If I was rating this on the overall recipe I would have to give it a 2 based on the sheer calorie and fat grams,  however with that aside, and reading through the recipe, you already know this prior to making the dish. I took the easy route and used leftover chicken (store bought rotissere chicken is a quick fix for expediency as well) and added the chive and green onion cream cheese to the mix instead of the chopped onion.  I think you could probably get away with reducing the butter by half with little loss of flavor....  Next time, I'll try the garden vegetable cream cheese and add cooked broccoli and diced red pepper OR make a buffalo chicken and add a little blue cheese to change it up.  The variations are endless!  NOTE:  The puffs were good served cold as well as hot!  Calorie and fat content aside this was a good recipe overall.

A little to cream-cheesy, but otherwise good. Don't use reduced fat crescent rolls--they don't cook quite as well as te regular.

I made these last week for a surprise graduation party for adults.  They were excellent when they had just come from the oven!  However, increased heat and humidity made them soft and not as tasty the next day.  I would heat them up next time if they are not served warm from the oven.  They are excellent nonetheless!

These are a family favorite, even the picky 3-yr-old loves them!  I've made them many times, tweaking it a bit each time until I found the "perfect" recipe for us.  Scaled down to 4 (1 roll crescent dough):  2 c. cubed cooked chicken, 4 oz. onion & chive cream cheese (omit onion, garlic, & butter), salt and pepper to taste.  I put the filling on 1/2 the dough rectangle, fold the other side over and pinch the "pocket" closed (I stuff them pretty fat, @ 1/2 c. filling each).  Brush with 1 Tbs. melted butter and sprinkle with crushed croutons (which give it an awesome bit of crunch), bake 25-30 minutes at 350 until golden brown.  They look beautiful and are sooo yummy (and filling) -- it has quickly become a favorite "comfort food" around here!!  (Everyone is always excited when we're having "Chicken Pockets" for dinner!)

For those of you having trouble with these being a mess, try making them in mini or even regular muffin tins. Just press the cut up cresent dough down into the muffin tin, lining it like a pie crust, fill with filling, and sprinkle top with cheese. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes or so

My mom has been making these for years and now that my sister and I are married we also make it for our families.  Our recipe calls for salt and pepper to taste, if not used, it is too bland.  We also sprinkle crushed croutons on it altough I have used seasoned bread crumbs.  For an appetizer party, I used puff pastry squares in mini muffin tins and then filled the shells and sprinkled bread crumbs on top and they were not only tasty bites, but pretty too.

I too have had this recipe for years!  Everyone loves it.  I have made a few adjustments over the years...It tastes the same even if you use lite cream cheese and  lite croissants.  I also crush garlic flavored croutons, put in a bag, dip puffs in a tiny bit of melted butter and roll around in the croutons.  The last thing I do is make a gravy to go over them.  1 can of healthy choice  cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup lite or no fat sour cream, a little milk to thin, and salt and pepper to taste.  Heat in a sauce pan and serve with noodles or rice.  You can put the gravy over the puffs and rice.  So yummy!

Nice basic recipe but a little bland.  I'd suggest making maybe half the recipe first and adding your own touches to it before you serve to company.
I cook 3 oz sliced fresh mushrooms along with the chicken then mix in a scant 1/4 C shredded Asiago Cheese.

I, too, have been making these for years from a recipe called "Chicken In A Biscuit" from a 1980 Southern Living Cookbook.  I use one 8 oz pkg crescent rolls, separating dough into 2 rectangles, pressing perforations to seal and cutting each rectangle in four 4 x 5" rectangles.  Use a heaping tablespoon of filling in each rectangle, bring moistened sides and ends of dough toward center, then shape into biscuit.  Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with Italian-style breadcrumbs. We always enjoyed these little "biscuits".

Really good! Note to Sabrina, yes, you can use Puff Pastry, just be careful it doesn't burn. As other reviewers have mentioned, I have changed  the fillings (ham, cheese and broccoli; chopped steak, mushrooms and grilled onions; and veggie version with grilled veggies).Yum.

Here is the original recipe that my sister-in-law and I submitted to Pillsbury 20+ years ago. Give it a try, you'll love it (gravy and all). Poach 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (or use a large can of white meat chicken, drained, no need to poach) in chicken broth for approx 20 mins, cool and shred. Lay out 8 crescent triangles and stretch them a bit at wide end. Plop a blob of shredded chicken at wide end (maybe 2 tblsp) and a pinch (maybe 1 tblsp) of finely shredded cheddar cheese on top of the chicken. Roll up the crescents like normal, but fold and pinch the tips when rolled. Curve them in normal half moon shape and place in 9x13 glass baking dish (un-greased, 2 rows of 4. In the large bowl with the remaining shredded chicken (if any), pour in 1 - 10 3/4 oz can cream of chicken soup, and 3/4 of that can of milk. Mix well and evenly pour over and around crescents. Be sure to cover them completely by spooning sauce. Sprinkle another tblsp or so of shedded cheddar on top of each crescent and a little over the surrounding sauce. Bake in pre-heated oven (temp according to pkg directions) for approx 25-30 mins). Cheese should be brown and bubbly and crescents risen. I usually serve with peas or cheesy broc. Hope you will give our original a try. P.S... we named them "Chicken Doodles" (which is what we still call them today), but Pillsbury re-named them.  Enjoy! -Rosanne (aka ALPARO)

To the actual puffs themselves, they were delicious. I made this with my cousin who wanted us to cook something that she could help with (she's only 8) and this was perfect and enjoyed by all the family. I used jarred garlic and some leftover chicken for simplicity and it was great.

This is one of my kids' favorite recipes. Instead of bothering with the onions and garlic, I use an 8oz tub of cream cheese with chives and onions. It make the recipe very good and VERY easy.

I've modified the recipe a little bit. It is a great starting base!   I use equal parts chicken breast and brocolli, pulse them in a food processer. I use herb and garlic cream cheese. Sprinkle a little granulated garlic on top of the puffs and away we go.   I also concur re: don't use low fat croissant dough, it doesn't work as nicely.

I have been making this for years.  I add a diced red pepper and broccoli and I leave the cresent rolls together in a rectangle on a cookie sheet spread the filling down the middle and make a braid.  Bake 20 - 25 Min.  My family loves this.

I added extra onion and some frozen peas and seasoned with black pepper, oregano and smoked paprika.  I had leftover wonton wrappers so I used those instead of crescents.  I brushed the "wontons" with olive oil and baked at 350 for 12 min and they ended up nice and crispy. The filling was delicious!!

I made these for Super Bowl----was so dissapointed.  Seems like all bread and just a little filling after they swell up while cooking.  The filling was delicious, might try it with something else.

I got a similar recipe from my mother in law years ago and have tweaked it myself, thought I'd share that version with all these other great ones : )  If you like texture to your filling, try dicing up some small carrots or celery... and if you like spice, add a FEW minced jalapenos to the cream cheese mix. My husband loves me to dip the wrapped croissants in butter and then roll them in bread crumbs too.  They are excellent!!! (as long as you don't mind the few extra calories hee hee...) And this version is great served right out of the oven or cold from the fridge too!!

This is a great recipe. I used more garlic to give it a little more "taste," but it is always a hit when I make it!

These are just ok, at best.  I'm surprised by the ratings a little-they are just very plain and a little on the bland side.

These are absolutely delicious!! I have been making these for several years (my mother-in-law inspired me). The only difference, is whne short on time or ambition, I substitute canned chicken.As long as you use quality canned chicken, there is very little sacrifice on taste. My kids take these in there lunches for school...if there are any left after dinner.

This recipe has an excellent flavor.  I thought wrapping the rolls was a little tedious, and because you can't put that much mixture into each roll ( it pours out if you overstuff ) they can be a little dry.  I made them exactly like the recipe using just one tube of rolls to test it out. I ate them for lunch the next day and they were very  tasty. Since I had most of the chicken mixture left over I experimented with it a little.  I added a small container of sour cream which made it much easier to stir, some pepper, a little celery salt and poured it into a bottom of a 9 inch pie pan.  Then I made the traditional bisquick topping ( 1 egg, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 cup of bisquick put into a blender for 2 minutes ) and poured that over the top of the chicken mixture !!  Bake it in the oven for 30 minutes and you have a great tasting variation of a chicken pot pie !!  The family ate it up, I wish I had made 2 of them !!  I will make these again both ways.  If I am taking them to an event I will make them as puffs.  If I make them for dinner again I will make them like a pie, it's much easier.  I will also always add the celery salt ( tastier ) and the sour cream ( much easier consitency to stir ). The next time I may experiment with the mixture  in a pie crust, roll it up and slice it like pinwheels before baking it.   I did enjoy the recipe and will have fun with it.  Thanks for posting it.

I have been making these for years and my family loves them.  My trick is to buy the cream cheese that already has the chives and/or onions in it.  I also add a bit of milk.  I top the puffs with a sprinkling of Italian style bread crumbs. So fast and easy.  Made them with canned white tuna too and they were delicious!

Delicious!  I rated this four stars since I did make some changes and took some advice.  Since it's only myself and my hubby, I used one can of 8 butter flavor crescent rolls, one 4 oz tub of chive and onion cream cheese, and two large boneless chicken breasts.  I first baked the chicken breasts at 350 for an hour, allowed them to cool then shredded them.  I mixed the shredded chicken with the cream cheese and added a teeny bit of milk to make it easier to mix.  Since I didn't want it to be runny I didn't add liquid until "stirrable", rather I mixed with my hands.  I seasoned with pepper and seasoning salt.  Then, I added a good amount of the mixture to my crescent rectangles (I wanted them to be dinner sized) and I added enough for the rectangle to be able to seal but they were stuffed full.  Brushed my puffs with olive oil and sprinkled crumbled cheddar french fried onions on top (anything crunchy would work.)  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  YUMMY!  My hubby cleaned his plate.  A tip:  your can of crescent rolls will make half that number of puffs (can of 8 will make 4 puffs, etc.)  If I had to do it again I would have bought two cans b/c  I had filling left over.  I will be using it tomorrow though!  Great recipe.

Delicious! Made this several times. Took the advise of others reviews. Used a leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco took the short cut. Mix it with green onion & chives cream cheese flavor. Gave hubby some & loved it. The possiblites of stuffing crescent rolls are endless.. made sausage, eggs & cheese , ham, turkey & cheese, like mini hot pockets, mini calzones & so many more using leftover roasts & meats.

This is a great recipe. Easy and very tasty. I had a friend make it and marinate the chicken in Lawry's Grill mates dry marinade with olive oil. It was the tequila flavor and it was incredible. The chicken was very moist and it was a huge hit.

This recipe is a lot of fun. You can really get creative and add your signature touch.

I agree that canned chicken breast makes this dish a lot easier. It shreds and blends with the cream cheese very well.

Follow some of the suggestions in the reviews, because they take this dish from good to delicious.

I have been making these for years, a little differant. With the crescent rolls, I pinch 2 triangles together to make a square and fill with cooked,shredded chicken,cream cheese,steamed,cut up or chopped broccolli and some cream of chicken soup  pull them up,twist the top and bake according to crescent roll directions. Heat extra soup for a quick sauce to pour on top. Family favorite for years!

These puffs are pretty tasty, but could be improved by adding different things. I added some chopped broccoli to mine and most everyone finished theirs.  After pressing the two triangles together to form the rectiange, I cut it into two squares and made them like turnovers.  I was able to reheat them in the toaster that way.  They were even better on the second day too.  I will keep this recipe and try stirring in different things.  Not too complicated, and fun to experiment with.

I used the crescent rolls from a can, stretched them out a bit, put the filling in the middle, and brought the ends up to the center. Then popped them in a greased muffin tin to bake, which was perfect. These were good, although the filling was a tad bit bland and the butter seemed too much. Next time I will substitute a different warm chicken salad mixture I have for the filling. All said, though, the family ate them up and leftovers work well cold or reheated a bit in the oven.

Ive made this recipe for years, except I make it a little different and its de-lish!   I add vegetables and more cheese and my husband and son loves them.  I usually dont use garlic or onion but I think Ill add some the next time.  I add a bag of shredded swiss cheese and a bag of cooked frozen mixed vegetables to the chicken mixture.  Use two triangles of the crescent rolls to make one rectangle and add 2 scoops and ball it up.  Oven set at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Serve with chicken gravy.  Makes approx. 8.

If you like this you need to try Savory cresent chicken also found on this site. You can have this for dinner not just as an appetizer. Also crused crutons on top make this so much better.

This looked delicious and sounded delicious but somehow did not taste delicious.  Tasted kind of bland and for some reason cream cheese and chicken did not pair well for my taste. The pastry also  seemed at odds with the other flavors.

Going to Christmas party Sat. night and looking for recipes everywhere...found this one and realized I have a similar one but only difference is you add little lemon juice and dried ranch dressing mix in addition to cream cheese...brush those puppies with a little melted butter and honey before baking, too - heavenly!  Just thought y'all would like to know!

I thought these were great as is, and even better with the spices and herbs I prefer. Because it's such a simple, tasty, basic recipe it can be changed however you like. In my house It's become a sunday night leftover staple used for lunches in the week. This week is leftover chicken, mixed "Zen Garden" veggies, green onion, cubed medium chedder, and a quick chicken broth gravey with herbs and lots of garlic. Take for lunch with baby carrots, celery or a salad, and it's perfect cold or warm.

These flew off the plate as a Thanksgiving appetizer!  Literally gone in 10 minutes.  Three family members asked for the recipe.  A number of them also appreciated that it was liked by their little ones.  The puffs were super big (still delicious!) when using the rectangles the recipe suggests (once with an 8 oz can of crescent rolls, once with 10 oz).  The third time I made them I just cut the triangle in half and pulled up the corners and wrapped them around the filling.  It's definitely a funky shape to work with but I liked the smaller, two-bite size.

these were easy and delicious, I sauted boneless, skinless thighs in the butter instead and then shredded them when they were cool. I used shallots instead of onions and instead of crescent rolls, I used buttermilk biscuits, they puffed up beautifully and came out wonderful, and tasted just as good the next day for lunch!  My daughter wants these every day now!

I added about 1/4 cup sour cream (lite) to the (lite) cream cheese and about 1/4 cup sharp cheddar. I didn't have crescents in the house, but had "Grand-Jrs.) and rolled them out. I baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes. They turned out perfect!  I'll make this recipe again and again and again.

I followed some other reviews suggestions. I used the canned chicken breast, omitted the butter, used onion powder instead of chopped onions, used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, added a splash of milk, used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls. All I can say is FANTASTIC!

I made this as directed the first time and it was wonderful.  The whole family loved it.  The second time I added a little basil pesto to the mix and it was even better.  Accidentally bought the croissant dough in the full sheet for recipes so instead of wrapping up the chicken I cut squares from the dough and placed them in cupcake pans with the four corners sticking out of the cup.  They were so easy to fill and baked up beautifully.  Served them at a family party and they were a big hit with everyone!

These puffs turned out GREAT, everyone loved them. I did, however, make a few of my own modifications. I cooked the chicken in a little bit of chicken broth for added flavor. Instead of fresh garlic, I used jarred Roasted Minced Garlic. I also used an entire 8oz. container of Chive and Onion Cream Cheese, instead of the regular. Once the puffs began to brown, I took them out of the oven and brushed them with some melted butter before putting them back in the oven to finish them.

This was only ok.  The only changes I made were to cook as per the crescent roll instructions and decrease the butter to 2 tbsp since it seemed like way too much to use 6 tbsp.  The crescent rolls came out perfectly, but I wasn't a fan of the mixture inside.  As much as I love garlic, there was an overpowering garlic flavor and there was just so much cream cheese instead of chicken.

UPDATE:  Made again with following modifications and really enjoyed it (****).  (1) Doubled chicken, precooked it in the oven (35 min at 350), shredded it, and then sauteed with onion and garlic for a few minutes for flavor.  (2) Only used one clove of garlic.  (3) Used 4 oz. cream cheese.  (4) Did not use any butter.  (5) Baked in oven as directed by package of rolls.  Only needed 2 pkgs. to make the rolls.

I omitted the butter like some reviewers, used canned chicken, and added some chopped black olives since that's what my friend put in hers when I first tried chicken puffs. Instead of rolling into balls, she puts the filling in the middle of the rectangle and brought the 4 sides of the crescent roll together on top and twisted; then sealed any open edges. When making these as appetizers, you can put the filling on a triangle piece of crescent roll, pull the 3 corners up, and twist.

I cut the serving size down to four and used one tube of crescent rolls.  I also used canned chicken (10 oz), and followed the rest of the recipe.  I served the left over filling as an extra "snackable" side dish.  Next time, when making four pockets, I plan on cutting back on cream cheese by at least two ounces.

I usually don't review recipes if I have added or altered them, but is time I am.  First, these are great.  I make something similar with beef...the changes I made are as follows:  I  cooked the chicken as directed, but added some fresh rosemary just before it was done.  I didn't use butter at all and used 6 oz of light cream cheese.  I also took two of the crescent rolls and made them into a square instead of the triangle, so they were just bigger. Delicious recipe.  Family gobbled them up!

This was a good recipe, I was just looking for something new and different and my husband gave it 2 thumbs up....I only altered it by adding fresh mushrooms as recommended by others.
Quick, easy once u get the hang of it, and simply delicious! My 1 year old seemed to enjoy them as well.

I've also been making this for YEARS but I use left over chicken (baked drumsticks) but I strip it off the bone then blend it! I put the chicken, the cream cheese Everything in the blender & then put about a table spoon & half in each roll!!! I have a 3 yr old a 6 yr old & a 9 yr old they love these & by blending it cuts down the risk for choking on big pieces of chicken! Plus I just much perfer the homemade chicken paste!!! Just have fun & experiment it's the best way to find what you and your family like the best god bless all & good luck!!!

My boyrfriend looooves crescent rolls, so this was a quick recipe I was able to throw together tonight for dinner. While I was making this, it screeeeamed to me "add buffalo wing sauce!!!" So I did. And I'm SO glad I did! I'm surprised the recipe doesn't call to season the chicken, which I did, and couldn't imagine it without (bland, tasteless). Overall, this was good - nothing super special, but easy enough. I chose to press the seams together of two triangles, then put the mixture on top, then place two more triangles on top, sealing the edges. This worked like a charm.

very rich, but very tasty... works best with small cubes of chicken, or perhaps try shredded chicken.  Also, bake at the recommendations on the package of crescent rolls, not the 325 for 12 mins listed in the recipe.

These turned out pretty well. I made a lot of changes. I shredded 2 chicken breasts instead of cubing them and used 8 oz of onion & chive cream cheese. I didn't use any butter, but added a little bit of milk to the cream cheese to make it stirrable. I also added a little bit of garlic powder to the dough for flavor. They needed about 22-24 minutes to brown, and probably could've even stayed in longer. Overall they had an odd taste, but the flavor of the chicken was still noticeable, which is what I had hoped for. Overall, not great, but decent.

This was a good recipe and fairly simple. I used a rotisserie chicken since I was short on time. Also added
corn and peas along with the onions and cooked them in a skillet with the garlic and a little olive oil. Everyone enjoyed, thumbs up.

These were great - filling little appetizers that everyone enjoyed!  I did make a few changes (I just can't help myself!), and, maybe I overstuffed my crescent rolls, but I only used 2 8oz cans.  A bit time consuming, but I will probably be making this again when we have a cocktail party.

I found two things that bugged me about this recipe, one there is a lot of the chicken mix and then the other was that the triangles were to small to hold enough mixture. I would change the type of bread so it could hold more of the chicken, other wise I thought there was to much bread.

I used 1 12.5 oz can of chicken, and the remaining ingredients as listed, then added a TBSP of sour cream with ranch.   I would suggest unrolling the cresents, then rolling or pressing the lines out of them and thne cutting them into squares using a pizza cutter, its just easier...

Very very tasty. I skipped the butter like others suggested and used a little milk in place. Shredded the chicken as well. Had some 8oz cans as well as 10oz. The 8's made good snack size and the 10's good meal size. Will be making these again and trying some other veggies mixed in as well. Almost like a chicken-pot-pie-puff. Thanks for sharing this one!

Yuuuuum these were SO good! And easy!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect. The only change I had to make was I had to bake them for about 20 minutes to get them golden. This is a great base recipe too- next time maybe I'll add spinach or cheese or tofu instead of chicken. Love it!

My kids love these and they are quick to put together.  My addition is using the garlic butter recipe here to spread on top of them before putting them in to bake...sooo good!  It's the right blend of bland and kick that brings no complaints at the dinner table where I'm always hearing "it's too spicy!"

These are great!  I didn't measure out anything specifically, which is one thing I LOVE about this receipe is you don't have to do that.   I used an onion and chive flavored cream cheese, along with the onion and garlic...we love those flavors.  I omitted the butter, and never missed it.  The second time I made them I chopped up some brocolli and added in with the mixture.  It turned out great, makes it a great little meal that way and made them feel a little more healthy too. :)  These will be a staple in our house now.

I have been using this recipe for the longest time.  I first saw it on Mr. Food, a local news chef in Chicago.  My kids have always loved this recipe.  You can rework this recipe to your liking.  Your imagination is the only limit!

This is also good when you add shredded cheese to the chicken mixture in place of the cream cheese and top with chicken gravy mixed with cream of chicken and a 1/2 cup of milk for the right consistency. Yum!!! People beg me for more!!!!

I did a rendition of this using 1 large can of chicken (drained) with lowfat chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain. It's faster than cooking chicken and tastes great!  You can also use Purdue short cut chicken with great results...

C'mon people.. How can this be bad with these ingredients? But sometimes you also have to use a little imagination in cooking. I could tell by reading it that it did not have enough flavor, some said bland, but that's no reason to "never make it again! I used the recipe as a base, I used 3 average chicken breasts instead of 2 and I sauteed them, the onion and garlic in a little olive oil, then I added salt and pepper (really that should be a given), then I also added to the cream mixture a liberal sprinkling of onion powder and Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb. I cut the butter, could tell with the cream cheese it wasn't needed. Instead, I pulled them out of the oven about 2 minutes from being done, brushed them with melted butter, sprinkled on parmesan cheese and some parsley and finished them till browned. Very good!

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I added chopped mushrooms when sauteing the garlic and onions and it gave it that extra special touch which took it from great to superb! i disagree with the posts that said not to use reduced fat croissants. I did and the recipe came out beautifully. Very rich, but worth it....will definetly make again. thanks for sharing.

The filling in these is perfect; however, I much prefer it wrapped in puff pastry rather than canned croissants. The croissants tend to make them doughy rather than light and flaky.

My mom made these often when I was a kid.  As an adult, I've discovered the quickest and easiest way to make it is to purchase a rotisseried chicken from the store, chop or shred it into little bits, add a can of cream of celery soup and an 8 oz cream cheese brick, stir that all together, add it to your crescent rolls and bake.  It takes most of the work out of it and it's still AWESOME.  My husband and kids love it too.

This recipe was fairly bland. There seemed to be too much bread for the amount of chicken. I don't think we'll make this again.

Sort of a mix between a pot pie and a hot pocket... really yummy!  The mix freezes very well!  We tend to make double or triple batches and freeze in dinner serving sizes so it's easier to make whenever we want them.

Super and easy.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic, lemon pepper and adobo.  I then cooked with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I cut the chicken up into little pieces and added 1 block of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I wrapped about 1 tablespoon into each reduced fat crescent roll.  My husband and I loved them!

I made this the other night...Yummy! Great with chicken gravy. I actually used a store bought rotissorie chicken and just shredded that so I could skip cooking the chicken myself.

I wanted to add that I started using the larger crescent rolls when making this recipe. I put the mixture in the middle and then stretch the crescent over the flling until all the corners of the triangle meet in the middle. Make sure it is sealed and then turn the puff over and wha la, you have formed a perfect round puff!

I used a pound of chicken tenders, chunking them before cooking (in a little olive oil and the garlic. couldn't find the onion so used onion powder). I used whipped chive cream cheese, no butter, and 3 tbsp green onion in the mix. I only needed 2 cans of dough (8 rectangles), but at 350 they took 20 minutes. My husband and I both loved them and I look forward to having the leftovers!

Quick and easy! I made them a little more calorie friendly by using reduced fat crescents and reduced fat cream cheese.

i thought they were good but very time consuming. i was constantly putting my hands in flour so the dough wouldnt stick to the and the dough wasnt shaped right where some were really big and some small, im sure i could use the same ingredents and find a much easier way to make this meal.

the idea is good, but the taste is ok.  I tried a little cream cheese with chives and it gave it a little more kick, but i think if uplay with it a little more u can find a better taste.  Also way to much butter and i only used half the amount of butter mentioned and i still felt it was to much!! the cresent rolls already have enough butter in them anyhow.

I stuck to the recipe, but found it difficult putting the mixture into rectangluar dough. If I make it again I will cut the dough into squares instead. I added freshly crushed peppercorns and I put my onion into the food processer so they wouldn't be very big b/c my husband doesn't like onions. Overall it was good and easy and will probably make again!

OMNOMNOM Definitely a yummy appie. I got rid of the butter but added some crumbled bacon. I also used red onion.   Instead of using egg white to give it a browner crispier top, I just use some of the Pam Non stick spray. Just a light touch of the spay was perfect.

These are soooo good!!!!!  I don't know what else to say about them.  I pretty much did exactly what the recipe says except I added a little bit of garlic powder to the finished mixture.  These would be great with some chopped broccoli in them, that might be what I try next.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These were wonderful!  Everyone raved about them.  I used minced garlic and onion.  To make it easier on me, I bought a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store's deli.  I used that for the chicken in the recipe.

These were great!  I took other people's advice and did NOT use the butter but DID use Cheddar Cheese.  I used a little oil to cook the chicken in the pan too.  Also, I only needed 2 cans of the Pillsbury Croisant Rolls.  We like more stuffing than dough and it worked great.  Any less stuffing and you really get the flavor of the stuffing... it would have been all dough.  Oh, I also added some of McCormick's Season All for spice.  It's a bland spice but adds flavor.  I'm definitely making these again but next time, I'm going to throw a little Salsa to the mixture. I bed it'll be awesome!  In total, this recipe made 8 puffs for me.  Again, 2 8oz cans was more than enough unless you like it doughy.  Lastly, I brushed egg white on top so it came out golden brown.

We will make these again!  I cooked the chicken in EVOO with garlic, salt and pepper.  I then shredded it and mixed it up with cream cheese and garlic powder.  I didn't have croissant dough, but I did have some home style biscuit dough.  I took each biscuit, rolled it out into a flat circle and put the chicken mixture in the middle.  I rolled another biscuit and put it on top of that.  I used a fork to press the edges together and brushed with EVOO and then some garlic salt.  This was so pretty and easy!  I won't even try this with crossiants, only biscuits.  A great meal for picnics or weeknight.  You could make the chicken mixture the day before and just throw it together.  I might put green peas into it next time for some color.  Serving this with gravy was key!!!

Wow - these are incredible.  Out of all the reviews and hints I can't believe that the 2 issues I had were only mentioned once each by 2 people.  I'm glad I listened to the one about cooking these at 375 degrees as required on the crescent roll directions instead of 325 on this recipe.  I can't even imagine they would be done in 12 min. at 325 cuz mine could of even cooked a few minutes more at 375 and been fine.  The one hint I didn't listen to I wished I would have was to buy more crescent rolls.  I had so much chicken mixture left over I think I could of used 2 more cans easy.  Things I will do different next time, besides buy more crescents, is to cook the chicken then shred it.  I think that would just work so much better in these.  I will also back off on the butter.  I think 2 tbls. would be sufficient.  My mind is imagining so many additions to these.  Veggies, green chilies, mushrooms, etc. etc. A very versatile recipe with so many potential incredients.

I have always added lemon pepper to my recipe like this and we serve them over rice.  We also heat up some cream of chicken soup with 1/2 c. of milk to pour over the top when finished.  Yum yum!

I have been making these for years.  My kids love them.  I use a 10-12 ounce can of chunk chicken, 3 oz cream cheese and 2 T. butter and bake at 350 until golden brown.  Very delicious and a great, quick easy meal.

I added dried basil and steamed broccoli. And you can always cut the calories significantly if tofu "cream cheese" is used. Thank you.

These were weird.  I made some with crescent rolls and some with biscuits and I still thought they were weird.  There wasn't nearly enough filling in each one, and I thought the filling itself was very bland.  I will try again with modifications, but I only gave it two stars "as is"!

I definitely think this is a recipe everyone should try, and then modify according to his/her tastes and dietary needs.  I used light cream cheese and half the butter - still tasted very rich and creamy.  The only hiccup is that it needs a little more kick for my family's tastes.  I added some red chili paste, but maybe I'll just add chopped green onions and some more salt next time.  But definitely, this recipe is a keeper!!

Used 1 large can chicken, 1-8 oz cream cheese, splash of milk and cheddar cheese, and onion powder and garlic powder. Next time try solid sheet of crescent roll dough. needs to bake at 350 for 15 to 20 minutes. Gets soggy quickly.

Made these tonight and they were delish!  Next time may use less cream cheese, add more chicken, and veggies.  May also try and omit cream cheese and use cream of mushroom so it's sort of like mini pot pies.  I did use reduced fat crescent rolls and they turned out great.  Baked at 350 till golden brown.

So good! I used only about 4 ounces of reduced fat cream cheese and 2-3 tablespoons of butter. I thought you would need more than a tablespoon of filling for this to be substantial enough, but really no more than a tablespoon will fit, and it turns out to be a good amount!

Good... I made it with the added goat cheese per a previous review.  I think it would be better left at the cream cheese only. Only good fresh, very heavy and soggy if reheated.  If you are making enough to eat immediately then worth a try.

Delicious! I sauteed the chicken in dairy free margarine and seasoned it before adding it to the cream cheese mixture. I also used vegan butter and cream cheese instead of traditional and it still came out great! Will definitely be making this again.

We followed recipe exactly, but something must have went wrong!  We put more of the chicken mixture in crescent dough that was called for, but did not taste the flavor as much as we did the dough.  Made it with a tomato bisque and dipped it.  That was yummy!  Next time, we will thin out dough to get more chicken flavor.  Took about 25 minutes to bake.

I didn't like these that much because I thought that the cream cheese and butter over powered the taste of the chicken and other ingredients.  So "as is" I think they r 3 1/2 stars.  After reading the reviews, I could see that people were making them to their liking, so I changed the recipe to have 1/4 light + 2/4 regular cream cheese + 1 Tbsp butter & 1 Tbsp milk.  Kept the same amount of onion and added 2 1/2 Tbsp of chopped green chilis.  Used garlic powder b/c that is what I had on hand. A few minutes before removing from oven, I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Now, they are a 5 star.  I'm very Thankful that you shared this recipe. I believe the possiblities r endless.  I am not a great cook, but this recipe makes it possible for any one to make a chkn puff the way they like.  Again thanks for the recipe.  Also, thanks for the reviews -- they helped me with this recipe and how to use the dough to make a puff.

These are fantastic. I added 3 slices cooked bacon for kicks and about 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese for a little zing. I made 10 puffs and there was a LOT more than one tablespoon per, so they took a full 45 minutes to cook. Worth the wait though!

Way too much cream cheese & butter (the ratio of cream cheese/butter vs. chicken is off), and not enough flavor.  Not worth the calories!

These puffs were absolutely fantastic and they have become a family favorite!!! The cream cheese keeps the filling moist and makes sure it does not dry out. Thank you for this great recipe!!

We couldn't believe how good these were. I was worried they would be overly rich, but no so. I didn't have much time to get dinner going, so it's great that this has such a quick prep and cook time.  I only used 1 package of crescents to make 4 puffs, so I scaled everything else back accordingly but used 1 chicken breast.  There was a little too much chicken to fit into just 4 rolls, so I'll just heat that up and have it on crackers today. For convenience, I even used dried minced garlic instead of fresh, and frozen chopped onion because I was in a hurry.

Absolutely delicious. I made it exactly how the recipe called for except I added some seasoned salt and pepper to the chicken. Wonderful recipe and very flavorful. I would make this again.

I'm eating these as I type, and they're fantastic! Super easy and delicious. I added the cream cheese to the chicken/veg mixture in the pot, rather than transferring to a bowl. This melted the cream cheese and made it easy to stir. I left the butter out all together, and I can't imagine they would need it, given the butteryness of crescent rolls and all that cream cheese. Rather than a little tablespoon of the filling, I used about as much as each pastry could hold. Ended up cooking for about 20 minutes. Delicious Puffs is more like it. However, next time I will use less cream cheese, and add more veggies to the filling.

so good! I softened up the butter and cream cheese so they blended together. perfect for an appetizer, especially in the fall/winter. Very comfort food tasting. I had to bake them 4 minutes longer than recipe called for. A eggwash on top would probably be wonderful!

We found these OK ... a bit bland, the recipe doesn't even call for salt and pepper, which I definetly added. I also added some chili paste to pep it up some.

20 Minutes to bake! Used one can crescent rolls with left over mixture. Seal tightly.For left over mixture am Going to use 2 more cans crescent rolls and NOT cut them, but use 2 triangles to make larger pot pies to send to work with my Husband for lunches. tasty. for the bland palette. Great for kids or someone that does not like spicy foods. Enjoy!

I have been making this recipe for years and it is my husbands all time favorite. The only thing I do differently is use a can of condensed cream of chicken soup as gravy to pour over the top. Awesome!

I made these & they were very good. I used Chive & Garlic flavored cream cheese which gave it a very nice flavor. I will make these again as an appetizer for a party.

Yum.  Made a couple of changes...used 4 oz of cream cheese, 4 oz of lite onion & chive cream cheese, 3 tbls of butter, 3 tbls of 98 % fat free cream of chicken soup and used 3 - 5 oz cans of pre-cooked chicken and added shredded mild cheddar cheese.  Next time I'm going to try using 6 tbls of lite cream of chicken soup instead of butter and see how that goes.

This was an awesome and easy recipe!! I did season my chicken more while cooking with garlic & onion powders, black & cayenne pepper, and a dash of salt (was worried it would taste too much like cream cheese). Other than that, I left the recipe as it was given.  EVERYBODY loved it!! Will definitely cook again!!

This was Great! It makes alot (for a family of 4) and I only used 2 cans of crescent rolls. I added a little bit of cayenne, but not enough to give it a kick. I'd like to spice it up some or add some carrots & peas next time. Overall - Super!

This was great! The kids loved it! It was very easy to make, but make sure that you seal the dough up good and tight so that none of the filling oozes out. I added bacon to my mix and some extra shredded cheese. It was a hit, and I will be making this again for sure:)

Awesome with chicken gravy.  Made the simple version of this using canned shredded chicken, green onions, and  softened cream cheese ...even husband who never eats anything that has cream cheese ate these and went back for seconds!  Thinking of making a pizza version, or chicken pot pie version...we'll see  : )

These were alright, mine took almost 20 minutes to bake through though... the taste was ok but not outstanding, I'd like to play with this recipe a little and change the seasonings up.

Very delicious. I added 3/4 tsp of dried oregano, but I didn't taste a difference. Didn't need it anyway. The onions and minced garlic were perfect. Not too cream cheesy (and I'm not a cream cheese fan). The crescent dough is the perfect shell for the filling. This has been added to our menu rotation. :) Thanks!

Just okay, not TOO much flavor.  I would definitely take some of the other recommendations and use a flavored cream cheese and add some spices.

very good! For a lighter version, i used low-fat cream cheese and 33% less fat crescent rolls. I didn't add any butter and added basil and oregano to mixture for added flavour.

Made these for dinner and everyone loved them.  Went to a party at Christmastime and I was asked to bring and appetizer.  I made these into little balls and made a honey mustard dip.  Had to make eight copies of the recipe to give to people there.

I wanted to like these, I like the idea of them, they are just really bland.  I figured they would be a little bland, so I added some horse radish to the cream cheese and even that didn't help.  I found it more benefical, since these weren't appetizers but a meal, I made these more like calazones.  I put the spread on one crescent roll and then put another on top and pinched the sides closed.  These were easy to make and tasted fine, but there is nothing exciting about this one at all.

This is a great recipe!  My kids loved it and I have trouble finding meals they will both like.  I did make some changes.  I reduced the butter to 3 tbsp. and added chopped spinach.  The second time I replaced chicken with italian turkey sausage and added 1 tbsp cream of chicken soup and sprinkled shredded cheese over the puffs before wrapping them.  That was a huge success as well.  Very versatile for different moods but simple, thanks!

OMG perfect absolutely the way it is. I would only increase the baking temp to 350 (i was using pilsbury croissants and the dough came out a little undercooked after the 12 minutes, canister then said 350, not 325). But i followed the recipe word for word, increased the time for a little longer (or change temp). but FANTASTIC. my picky 2 year old asked for more! AND THAT'S EXTREMELY RARE. I think next time i'll sneak in some chopped up broccoli. and next time is NEXT WEEK. Thanks!!!!!!!!

These are very good, easy and my family liked them, even my husband who does not like cream cheese. I gave it only 4 stars because I changed the ingredients a little, making it better like the other reviews. I used onion and chive cream cheese instead of the plain and left out the onion and garlic cloves but used garlic salt and pepper when I cooked the chicken. There are many things that can be put in the "puffs" and so next time I'm going to add broccoli and use broccoli cheese soup instead of cream cheese. My husband said wanted to make a pizza one! yum!

I had really high expectations after reading the reviews and this didn't quite deliver as much as I'd hoped, but it was still pretty good. I think the recipe as written is a little confusing- it's not clear how to cook the chicken. What I ended up doing was boiling it and then shredding it- if you go that route I recommend seasoning the shredded chicken as I found the overall dish somewhat bland. I think next time I will add a small amount of salt and replace the garlic with green onions or chives as I felt the garlic was sort of a weird flavor with the cream cheese. All in all, a neat recipe and pretty easy to make too. I plan on applying the crescent dough technique to other fillings!

Made this for my family for dinner tonight.  So quick and simple to throw together and very delicious.  I grew up with a version of this that uses cream of chicken soup, onion, chicken, and cheddar cheese and it has become a staple in my household today.  This was a nice change-up from that recipe.  My three year old daughter wanted to help and it was an easy recipe that she could participate in...And then her "usually picky self" ate it right up!!!  The only change I made was using Chive and Onion cream cheese instead of the regular, as others suggested.  I thought it added a really nice flavor without being too overwhelming.  Definitely recommend!!!

These were great. I took a shortcut and used a 12 ounce can of all natural chicken. I used two rectangles of dough per puff and filled them with two heaping tablespoons of chicken mix to make 4 large chicken puffs. No need to dirty a bowl, I mixed the cream cheese into the warm pan after cooking. Also added a little chopped celery to the onion mix while cooking. My sweety gave it two thumbs up. Thanks :)

I've made these for years. I've also added defrosted and drained frozen green peas, and sauteed mushrooms. I always add garlic to everything and poultry seasoning makes it more savory. As another reader mentioned, shredding rather than cubing the chicken is easier and it also makes the texture better. Also, the original recipe calls for brushing the tops with a bit of butter and sprinkling crushed croutons (you pick the flavor) which gives a nice topping. Great the next day and freezable too.

Pretty yummy! I had to bake it twice as long, though - about 22 minutes - and I did the "lower fat" version as well. It was sweet from the cream cheese, though; something I wasn't expecting.

I made a few changes- shredded chicken, added green onion, salt,pepper and and didn't cook the onion and garlic with the chicken.  I thought they were ok, but my family (My son in particular) loved them. Will most likely be making them the next time I have leftovers.

Our family LOVES these! Even my picky little ones (ages 5, 3, and 1 1/2) can't get enough. I've used the "puffs" idea to make other recipes too. Sloppy joes puffs, barbeque beef puffs, etc. Works well with lots of ingredients and my kids think they're fun to eat. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This was deliscious. Really! I made the following changes based on the suggestions of others here.  I sauteed my chopped chicken with garlic and chopped mushroom. No butter in the filling. I used onion and chive cream cheese and a little milk. I also found seemless crescent dough which I was able to cut into large squares, rather than pressing pre-cut triangles together.   Using chicken and cream cheese in the amount listed below I made 6 large puffs but only used 2 cans of dough not 3 as stated.

I have made this twice. First time exactly as listed. This time I used lipton onion mix, crumbled bacon and leftover turkey, cream cheese and farmers cheese as the filling. It was fantastic.  They have already requested this again at the office.

I really wanted to like this dish...but it was way too rich. Maybe good as tiny hors d'oeuvres, but I'm definitely not going to make this again. We disliked it so much we took the leftover chicken filling mix and baked it with macaroni and shredded cheeses to salvage the ingredients we had used to make this.

These were really good; we changed quite a few things though.  We used 2 cans of crescent rolls instead of 3; we used 4 large cloves of garlic along with one small diced onion.  We also diced the chicken instead of cubing it; and lastly, we used "garden vegetable" cream cheese instead of regular (this gave it a really nice flavour!)  In the end, these bites weren't hard to make...but they were time consuming to roll up. In saying that, I won't hesitate to make them again because everyone really liked them!

great recipe..I did add just a dot of red pepper flakes to the mixture for flavor. Also used cream of chicken soup with a tad of red pepper flakes in it as a gravy. served for dinner..add the gravy as you eat them, leftovers are good snacks without the gravy..yum yum

AWESOME. Just love these. I've made them three times now. They are my GO TO recipe for appentizers. And they NEVER last long! Try them! You'll LOVE them.
I didn't add the onions (yuck) or garlic. But I did add a 1/4 cup of shredded cheese!
Also, a little advice with the dough. When you roll it out and it is in triangles, press the two triangles together and cut that now rectangle in three. They get PLENTY big enough in thirds.

This is just okay. I don't think I'll be making this again per the instructions - I'd probably double the chicken and half the cream cheese.

I thought this was very tasty.  I would definately make this again.  The recipe was for 12 servings but mine made 8. I bought a can of reduced fat croissant rolls (of 8) and rolled them a little thinner and layed them into cupcake holders, filled them and just folded over the ends of the croissant and baked them as directed. I used all the filling.  You can use this idea with lots of other fillings.  Thanks!

I have made this forever but I cut my crossiants in half and bring up the three ends. Everyone absolutely loves these and no matter how many I make they are always gone. I also use canned chicken. I have also done them with tuna.
I ony use chicken, garlic and creamcheese I don't use the onion as I have family that cant eat onion and they are still so very good.

I made this recipe this weekend, got it from a friend, and after stuffing the puffs I rolled them in egg and covered them with bread crumbs. Then made a simple sauce of whipping cream and red bell peppers, just put it on the stove for about 10-15 minutes, then stuck it in the blender and poured it over the puffs after they were done. So good!

This was right up my husbands alley- creamy, flakey, pastry-y.  I used less butter, a cup of shredded parmesan, and a cup of frozen chopped broccoli that I microwaved and drained well.  I will make this again for sure, but I may try to figure out a way to use puff pastry instead.  The crescent rolls are a bit heavy. Also, I will used cooked chicken, maybe rottisere.  But this was sooo delicious!!

I used pillsbury crescent roll dough and added cheese. This recipe was great -- really rich (read fattening) and delicious and tasty.  Highly recommended.

I incorporated this recipe with another recipe that I received from my cousin. I used minced onion instead of chopped onion (due to timing) and did not add the 6 tbsp of butter. I also added cheese to the chicken mixture and thought that this was a must. (I added gouda because that's what I had, but cousin uses cheddar). Cousin also adds a sauce on top. (Cream of chicken soup and sour cream warmed together.) The jumbo crescent rolls work great and give you a triangle puff. The presentation is wonderful. Thanks!

I've lately been experimenting with recipes for the Super Bowl, and everyone in my family enjoyed this one. It wasn't quite our favorite, though - sort of in the middle. I'll probably make it again, but maybe not for the Super Bowl itself. There was a strange amount of filling - not enough to warrant 3 cans of dough, but too much for just 2. They came out feeling over stuffed. We had cooked garlic, chicken, and onion in the house, so we skipped step 1, but that was our only variation on it.

Okay, this recipe needs something extra!

Add a small package of sliced almonds (I browned mine in a skillet.) If you need even more crunch than that, cut some apples into tiny chunks and toss some of those in there. 

Delicious! These are also fabulous when served cold.

This recipe is delicious as is, but also has other possibilities. Instead of butter, I mixed about a half cup of sour cream to chive and onion cream cheese, and added garlic, onion, and poultry seasoning. Sprayed with oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds before baking. The homestyle flavor is reminiscent of chicken pot pie so you could easily add carrots and peas, glaze the tops with rosemary jelly, or add cheese. Alternatively, to lighten it up, you could add chopped fresh basil or a few tablespoons of pesto sprinkle the tops with grated parmesan and serve it alongside a fresh marinara. You could also add cumin and chili powder and serve it with a cilantro cream sauce. Puff pastry would be divine as well. Substantial yet inexpensive protein for a party. Two chicken breasts yielded about 20 palm sized balls.

My kids love these!  I always adjust the recipe depending on what I have on hand, but I add the butter and cream cheese as stated.  Tonight I added sauteed mushrooms, left out the onions and added garlic salt and swiss cheese.  I also always double the batch and the roll the leftover in wax paper (like cookie dough) and then I just slice and put them in the crescent rolls and bake.  No thawing involved and a quick meal for busy kids on the run!

This is an awesome recipe - thank you so much.  I did salt and pepper mine while cooking chicken, and after mixing I steamed broccoli to add 
to mix.  I served this as a meal so I did not cut each triangle leaving 
them as they were so I could stuff them more and served them with salad.  This was definitely a hit in our house and I will be making it again.

very good everyone liked them, Denver was iffy and Dave never had a chance to try them, I thought they were good cold to. For the recipe I only used half of a 8 oz. block of cream cheese and seemed plenty, used cayenne pepper and some other seasonings to spice it up,

Easy and delicious! Next time I will make a sauce/gravy, but the inside was creamy. I cut down on the butter and only used 2 tbsp and it was still creamy and wonderful filling. I sprinkled the outside with garlic salt before baking. Will definitely be making these again.

These chicken puffs are simply outstanding and a huge hit w the family. The only problem is I can't stop eating them.  It can be a little tricky getting triangle shaped crescent roll dough around a large spoonful of the filling so I recommend making the dough yourself and cutting it in squares or circles.. Enjoy!

These were delish the first time around so we made them again! Something I noticed is that you seem to need a little more dough than what is called for. Also, canned chicken worked wonderfully and the second time around we added sauteed broccoli! These are highly fattening so I try to make them seldom but when I do they are so hard to resist! Yum! Would love to find a alternative to the pillsbury dough though....I'm not much into processed foods etc. Overall....amazing and filling!! :)

I really thought I'd love this recipe but it got the big thumbs down in my household.  With the butter and cream cheese (even light versions), it was just too creamy and didn't really have much flavor.  I would have preferred the mixture with something that offset the creaminess and added crunch like a veg.  

The crescent rolls are very doughy so it really needs something savory and not just bland creamy chicken inside.  

I definitely will not be making this again.

This turned out great. I did add mushrooms to the mix. When I unrolled the crescents they formed to rectangles and I just pinched the middles and made logs instead of little bundles.  The gravy made the dough soggy and a couple people didn't really like that while others didn't think it detracted at all. I served this with a Cauliflower salad

I have made these many times. They are always a hit . . . a simple appatizer that doesn't look like much, but as soon as you eat one you are hooked. Everyone asks for the recipe. I've used chicken, salmon, ham and turkey. Great when warm and still tasty the next day.

I loved the filling, but this is way to much bread and the puffs are huge. I'm going to try again, but this time I'm going to cut the rolls in half before filling, making 8 out of a single can. If that is still to big, I'll try putting the filling on the top of a triangle and rolling the indivual croissants

These were really good but the filling needed something with a little more zest!  But all my kids ate them right up.  (ages 2, 3, 5 & 7) They loved them just the way they are.  Next time I make them, I'm going to eat them with something extra.

I made these and I was very skeptical at first. I wanted to cut the recipe in half, but I couldn't because there is no way to save opened crescent rolls. I forgot to add the garlic and used green onion instead of white. I took the left overs to work the next day and everyone LOVED them. They all asked for the recipe. I know what to take to my next potluck at work!

Love this recipe!  I used leftover turkey and didn't have garlic, but it came out great all the same!  I ended up cooking them for about 28 minutes to get the dough nice and crispy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good and super easy to make, but I wound up making a few changes. I added celery, carrots and some herbes de Provence and used a yogurt-based spread to cut down on the fat. I also used puffed pasty dough instead of the crescent roll dough (because German supermarkets don't seem to have pre-made crescent roll dough). Made 6 pocket shaped puffs and they turned out really good. I will be making these again!

I made this tonight for dinner. My picky 2 and 4 year olds enjoyed it, as did my husband. They are much more filling than they look, but I may have made mine bigger than I was supposed to. As others have recommended, I added a few extra spices, green onions, and I did brush the egg on top of half of them and sprinkle onion powder. We liked these much better than those I did not brush with egg, so I would highly recommend that change! I also made turkey gravy and it took a good meal to outstanding! The gravy really added the extra taste I thought was missing. Still, overall, I made very close to the original recipe and it was very good. The small changes just made it GREAT!

Everybody (husband and three kids) loved it!  How could they not?  I cooked the chicken in the onions, but then separated them before mixing the chicken with the cream cheese and butter (since the kids would revolt about the onions), and serving the sauteed onions separately.  I plan to make over and over!

I loved them.  My only problem was the definition of cubed chicken.  Apparently my cubed is alot larger than necessary.  They have to me about 1/4 to 1/2 have inch cubes.  Otherwise extremely delicious

I prepared this and put it in the fridge (minus the almonds) and left instructions for my family to cook while I was at work.  They actually called me to tell me that all three of them liked it! (They are the picky-est eaters in the world) I tried it and thought it was good, not something you would want to eat all the time, but it is tasty!  The red peppers and dill really make it!

I've used this recipe for 30+ years except (there's always an except isn't there??) I use left over turkey in them. Great way to use up all of the little pieces and shreds that are a shame to waste but too little for a sandwich! I like to use cream cheese with chives but it's getting harder to find!

They were ok. Too strong of a cream cheese flavor for me, it was overpowering.

I made larger puffs so it was probably me that caused the dough not to get done completely. But be careful to lengeth the cook time if you try to make bigger puffs. My family wasn't so crazy about the cream cheese filling.

This is good but needs more 'kick' so it is not too rich or too bland.  I added two cups of fresh spinach while sauteeing the onion. When mixing all the ingrediants, threw in a half cup of walnuts, to give it some texture and crunch so its not too mushy.  It was really good, almost like hot chicken salad in a pastry puff.

These were fabulous and fun!  My family really enjoyed these, so I shared the recipe with a friend.  Her family loved them as well.  We are both excited about the possibilities of this recipe.  I can't wait to experiment with what veggies to add to this puff.  I paired it with the Corn and Zucchini Melody from this site, and it was the perfect meal.  

Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe that will be added into my normal menu cycle!

*Edit*  I would recommend cooking these puffs per crescent roll directions instead of 12 minutes at 325.  I think they crisp up better.

These are really good! I added chopped green onions, 3/4c. shredded cheddar cheese, and half of a Ranch dressing packet to the mixture. It was like having a party in your mouth! Huge hit!

Yumm!!  The only thing I changed was to cook them a bit longer than the recipe called for.  I found that mine were still a little doughy and needed a bit more cooking time. Good, easy dinner any night of the week.

Awesome. This was the first time I made it, and it turned out really well. I made it for a poker game and it vanished. Everyone loved it. Two tips: i) let the mixture cool before putting it in the dough; ii) dividing the crescent rolls was a major pain so I just made wonton style in the preshaped crescents which worked out really well. This one will be made again and again.

This is great with some modifications! To only use 2 chicken breasts and 3 packages of dinner rolls seems like too much bread. I only used one clove and half of the butter to saute to onions and garlic.  Add milk to the cream cheese mixture to make it thinner to coat the chicken.It takes a little longer to cook the crescent rolls to avoid being soggy in the middle. I used 4 -5 chicken breasts and only two packages of crescent rolls for a dinner portion. It goes great with steamed asparagus!

I love this recipe it is so tasty! Definitely not an every day thing as it is so rich-- maybe next time I can try it with tuna fish & mayonnaise, yumm. :-)

I'd also like to say that:
-at 325* it has to stay longer than 12 minutes. Could depend on the oven because some of the newer models have different settings for each level the pan is on. I had mine in for 20 min and decided to raise to 375* as that is what the crescent rolls instructions say. 

-The chicken of course should be seasoned. I don't ever cook anything w/o seasoning the meat. I added some adobo, black pepper, a little salt, 1 packet of sazon, maggi chicken bouillon seasoning, and a little sprinkle of Mrs.Dash's Italian seasoning mix. 
-Don't add the liquid after cooking the chicken into the cream cheese & butter mixture as it would be way too runny.

My family actually ate this...so it deserves all 5 stars!  I used the full 8 oz of cream cheese and added a little extra chicken.  I also used green onion and added a little bit of shredded carrot and diced celery.  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Very good but I can only give it 4 stars because I altered the recipe. I used 4 oz regular cream cheese and 4 oz of onion and chive cream cheese. I used fresh grated garlic because I think it blends better than when it's minced. I also used margarine instead of butter and used garlic butter croissants. I added black pepper to the mixture. Came out great but I think it would have been pretty bland without all the variations I made.

It's also a lot more time consuming than I realized so make sure you have ample time.

Not bad...A little too much sour cream and missing something. Probably a little garlic salt on top would do the trick. Prep time is much longer than stated too. I boiled the chicken first so that took prob 20 min. Rolling these things up prob took 15-20 min alone.

A good base recipe. I used puff pastry sheets, rolled a little thinner and cut into 1/4's. I sauteed green onions, celery thin cut, mushrooms thin cut, cayenne pepper, garlic and lemon pepper. Used shrimp instead of chicken and wrapped mixture like a beggar bag, brushed with milk and baked at 375 25 mins. or until golden  brown.

These were just ok. I added a few seasonings based on the reccomendations of other reviewers but they were still rather bland. Also, a bit too much bread. I will make them again and perhaps roll out the crescent rolls to be a bit thinner. I also made balls out of them as per the instructions but I see from the photo that the dough has actually been folded up and looks much thinner than the version I made. All in all, a decent basic recipe...just needs some more flavor.

Fantastic.  I used no butter and half a block of cream cheese.  Two chicken breasts and two rolls of crescent rolls.  I put two triangles of dough together to make a big triangle and put the mix in that.  It made just about the right amount for the dough. It was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased with how they turned out. The only challenge for me was getting them into a good shape for baking. Any way you roll them, they will be delicious. I am now asked to make these for every event/get together.

This was really good. I did make revisions, but this is normal. Everyone has their own tastes. #1, I cooked my chicken outside on the grill for extra flavor. #2, Instead of cubing the chicken, it was a lot easier to shred the chicken in a food processor. #3, Instead of cutting the croissants into halfs, I nixed this and just rolled them up as normal. #4, I added Lots of Green Onion to the chicken mixture, #5 I also added some green chilis and garlic to the mixture. #6, I also left out the butter and replaced that with a little milk to make the mixture creamy. For my tastes, I cut down the cheese almost in half so I could taste the Chicken more.

It's not very often I get a lot of feedback on dinner.  My family usually tells me it's good or they like it.  Tonight, they raved about it!  My almost 10 year-old said it was "Epic!" and my husband said it instantaneously went on his list of favorites!  I did change one thing; I had garlic crescent rolls from Pillsbury, so I cut back just a little on the garlic in the chicken.  I did need to cook them for about 17 minutes, but they came out awesome!

Easy to make, and all of the family enjoyed them. Spiced them up with Cajan seasoning, and red pepper when I cooked the chicken & onlions. Really enjoyed them.   Make one at a time for the hot filling will start to "melt" the dough and make it harder to fold up. Other then that, Easy to make and fairly quick dinner.

it was a huge hit with my family!!! added a lil more garlic, salt pepper, and some homemade seasoning that i have. also used round cresent rolls which makes it very easy to fill, just flatten out and put the filling in there. for the most part was a very good base recipe

My only suggestion would be to shred the chicken and put in less cream cheese mixture, since it was very messy, and maybe a some pepper to kick it up a little since it was a little bland. My husband downed half of these and then took the rest for lunch the next day. So they were obviously very good.

I had read reviews about how there was way too much filling left over at the end and I should buy an extra can of crescent rolls - good thing I didn't!  I felt like there was barely enough filling to put into the crescent rolls that I had!  I used someone else's recipe of light cream cheese with milk and green onions but there just wasn't much flavor.

I made these for the first time the other night. I more than tripled the recipe because I was feeding a big family. Other than needing to be in the oven a bit longer it is a great recipe! Everyone was skeptical about them at first, but they loved them and they dissapeared fast. I thought they were delicious cold too! Will definately make these again.

Recipe great as is.. felt like it needed a little something extra? Still can't put my finger on what though. My family's having the leftovers cold for lunch today, as recommended by a previous reviewer. This is a healthy alternative to a hot pocket...

I just made 1/3 of the recipe to try them myself before serving to guests.  I wanted more of an appetizer size, so once I had 4 rectangles from my roll of crescents, I turned them into 8 squares.  I took others' advice and left out the butter and used a little bit of milk.  So simple and very tasty.

Thanks for this recipe!  I made the other day, added fresh thyme to the chicken thigh meat and did as a braid like someone suggested in the reviews  It was a hit.  So easy, now I wanna try as a sweet version maybe with peaches.

These were really great and so simple.  I wanted shredded chicken so I boiled the chicken breasts then shredded them and mixed it in with the onion and garlic. I also added salt and pepper. When I put the mixture onto the crescent rolls, I added some shredded cheddar cheese before rolling for more flavor. Great recipe! Served with broccoli w/cheddar and chicken rice.

This is quick and easy!  I used less than half of the butter suggested however, and they were still very flavorful/moist.  Will use this recipe again!

I felt guilty the whole time this dish was melting in my mouth! My husband and son loved it too, both their eyes lit up with the first bite. I added some cheese and a can of corn to the filling and we all agreed it would be great with brocolli or just about anything.

This is not a new recipe. Pillsbury came out with this recipe in some magazine over 30 years ago. There is more to it then just cream cheese. Cubing the chicken is a lot harder then it looks. Shredding is easier and I use to double the recipe. I have not made this recipe in years due to the fact it does call for milk to make it a creamy consistency and I over used the milk. Very yummy but don't expect the picture to come out looking like yours. Sealing these crescents can be a lot tougher then it looks.  Otherwise, great recipe and thanks for the memories.

Making this turned out to be a huge mess.  I probably had the mess from trying to add too much filling, but it still wasn't enough.  The pastry was overwhelming...I could barely taste the filling, but adding more filling would have been even more mess.   There ended up being much more filling than I needed, and while it tasted good, it was not anything exciting.  Also, 325 degrees left my puffs as still raw dough after 12 minutes.  I think that should read 375, which is what I tried the second time around, and it worked. I used the remaining filling over toast. Overall, this was kind of boring, and not worth the hassle and mess.  I seriously considered only 2 stars, but since the mess was probably my fault (although an attempt at a better product), I added a star on.

It's a good base recipe, but the cream cheese taste is overpowering.  I'll probably try it again, but with a little mozzarella and a bit of heavy cream, leaving out the cream cheese entirely.

My family named this Chicken COR-DON YUM!!!!:) Hope the name tells you what we thought. The only thing I did different was added a bit of spices and pepper. I Had some left over mixture after filling all the rolls, so i made some white rice and threw in the left overs, made a great and easy side to go with. This will now be a once a weeker:)

Excellent... be sure to use unsalted butter.  I also added 2 slices of turkey bacon and 1/2 cup of monterey jack... thoroughly impressed.  Furthermore, I tried the Pillsbury Crescents with garlic butter (new product) and they were delectable!  My dad who is not a huge fan of garlic opted for the plain butter flake crescents... both along with this recipe are scrumptious!

What fun and unique recipe! This was a perfect Friday night dinner of savory comfort food that my family needed. Served with steamed veggies and even gravy over the top of these fresh out of the oven. Loved them and will definitely make again.

A nice change of pace. Very simple and I loved the sauce. I think I am going to try it with crab meat and make smaller puffs for appetizers at my next card party. Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe is very good.  I did as others suggested, I used a little bit of milk to thin out the cream cheese and forgot all about the butter, its not needed.  I also added some frozen spinach to the chicken and cheese mixture.  I use any way I can to sneak veggies into food.  My husband and kids loved this dish.

We have been making these for years, we call them Chicken Things! Only thing that we add is soom green onion and after we roll them up wash some melted butter over them then roll in cruched up stuffing mix!! Adds a nice crunch, and we always serve with chicken gravy, YUM!

Have been making it several times since discovering this recipe, just added some mushrooms to the filling and used puff pastry because i cannot get crescent rolls dough here. Just great!

This was really yummy! We really enjoyed it. I used some leftover canned chicken that I had in the fridge, gave them a nice egg wash and coated them with some coarse salt and sesame seeds and they were quite attractive. Served with chicken rice and glazed carrots. We will be having this again. Oh Yeah, as one reviewer said the onion does make this dish!! *UPDATE* If this recipe turned out runny for you.....YOU did something wrong. This recipe is perfect the way it is. Try it atleast once the way it is written before making any changes, you wont be disappointed. Its not runny, bland, or dry. They are super yummy give it a shot.

These were a huge hit with my husband and our neighbors.  The only change I made to use the cream cheese with chives and onions which was recommended by another reviewer.  Very good and very filling!

This recipe would be 5 stars with less butter, maybe 2 tbsps or none at all.  The first bite is delicious, but then it gets too rich.

EXCELLENT!  Impressive for company!  I did this:  1 block lite cream cheese in bowl, stir together w/shredded chicken, green onions, and a smidge of milk just so it's a little "stirrable" (no butter) - sprinkle garlic salt on top of puffs before baking.  I only wish I'd made more!

Here's what I did: With the chicken I put 2 Tbs dried minced onion, minced 4 cloves fresh garlic, 1 Tbs dried basil and a dash of garlic salt.  OMIT the butter- it's not needed at all!.Cooked all through, then added 1 handful fresh spinach to wilt.  Removed from heat to cool slightly, and added almost a full 8oz Chive & Onion cream cheese.  Someone had mentioned not to do this while it's warm- but the chicken melting the cream cheese is the whole point!  I only had 2 cans of crescent roll dough- this divided beautifully into 8 puffs!  And the smell while preparing and cooking these is heavenly!  Note* these took MUCH longer than 12 minutes at 325, temp should def be changed to 375!  Came out so warm and yummy, not bland at all and these are now going on our regular rotation! THANKS!

Like most other people, I altered this recipe some.  I used 4 oz. cream cheese, 1 can cream of chicken soup, a little milk, and about 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar for the filling.  Used some of the suggested spices (parsley, plenty of garlic, seasoning salt) and topped with egg white, a sprinkle of bread crumbs, Parmesan, and garlic powder.  Baked according to crescent rolls, which was 350 for about 20 minutes.  Cooked them over a bit because I didn't want them at all doughy.  Delish!

My Husband and I LOVE this dish! I changed a few things though... I added a little more garlic for flavor, and instead of crescent rolls, I buy the pre-made dough pie shells, and we make a pie out of the mix. I line the pie shell with shredded cheese, add the mixture, then add another layer of cheese (we like cheese) put on the top of the pie crust and bake! It is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! Great flavor!!  Thanks for the recipe!

i followed heromaine's suggestions and used only shredded chicken, cream cheese and green onions..along with a dash of milk (no butter needed!). they turned out great! i mixed some egg white with garlic powder and brushed the puffs before putting them in the oven...it gives it a pretty appearance (as well as tasty!) :)

I really liked this recipe. I had a little trouble at first getting 2 crescent rolls to not come apart and split down the middle, so I just decided to make smaller puffs by stuffing individual rolls. Worked great!

I thought this was okay and my family didn't like it, didn't even finish what was on their plates. I make something similar to this recipe using ground beef which they love so I thought this would be a nice change.   Won't make it again

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  But it seemed to be missing something to give it some punch.  It was rather bland.  Maybe adding some broccoli and cheddar to it.  Or bacon and chives.  It just wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  I also had to up the oven to 350 and add on some cooking time.

We LOVED this recipe!! My son kept asking for more.  I used way less butter and put sauteed fresh garlic into the mixture.  Definitely need two cans of Croissants.

We loved these! I used a lemon-herb flavored rotissary chicken from Superwalmart to save on time and just shredded the breasts. I think that this added so much more flavor and the chicken just melted in your mouth. So easy, and I will be making lots more!

Really good recipe!.. I did omit the butter as another reviewer suggested and I dont think they missed it at all!  Flavorful and good!  I used a cream cheese with chive and the extra large crescents (6 per tube) and they were nice size!  I also followed the directions on the pkg. of crescents for temp. and baked until golden brown. Costco's Kirkland chicken in a can made them super quick and easy!  ****** Made again tonight; I used the regular sized crescents and the amounts were perfect to a T of filling...  I decreased cream cheese and added shredded cheese...  I over creamed everything and it was missing texture.  Next time I will try to leave the chicken a bit chunkier.  Everyone agreed they would be better not so soft!

To save time, I used 2 large cans of chicken.  Added a little rosemary, parsley & tarragon.  They were awesome.  I guess I didn't put enough of the chicken mixture on the rolls at first, because I had leftover mix.  I put it between 2 canned biscuits.  They were good too, but the cresent rolls were better.  For the onions, I used chives.  Oh, I didn't leave the cresent rolls in rectangles.  I tore them as if I were baking the regular cresent rolls.  So, mine were smaller.

I only rate recipes when I find them very, very good (if they're not 5 star I can't blame the recipe as I tend to 'punt' w/seasoning, adding stuff, etc. so not fair to rate something I changed).  
I used the whole 'triangle' rather than cutting in half as I was getting short on time w/dinner prep.  Plus, my 7 yr. old was helping with the 'wrapping' and was easier with a bigger dough.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with 32 'helpings'.  I cooked them for 18-20 min. to get the nice golden brown.  The only thing I changed was seasoning a little more with plain ole seasoning salt and garlic powder (I don't know how to cook w/o garlic powder!).  They were fabulous and will in the future make them for potlucks or large get-togethers.
Thanks for sharing your recipe w/us!

I am giving this recipe a 3 because it is missing something.  I made recipe just as writen.  I did however change the way I put it together.  I didnt' want such a big appitizer so I took each cresent roll and using a rolling pin flattened it out a bit.  Then I made a pouch with that.  I took the long end and made a knot on top.  They did look good.  They tasted good also, but that is all just good.  So will I make this again as written?  Probably not, would I make it again and revamp it?  yes.

We loved these at my house. I kinda "wung it" though and didn't realize these were supposed to be small appetizers. I ended up making huge ones and we ate them for dinner.. Lol. Will make them smaller next time- loved them!

Family approved! We ran out of croissants and used biscuits. They worked well too! I also added Franks hot sauce and shredded cheddar cheese to the last bit for buffalo chicken puffs! They were a hit!

Fun recipe for the kids to eat.  I made a few modifications, I added 1/2 cup Marsala sauce and let it cook out, then I added a can of cream of chicken soup and some heavy cream to thin it out some and added a small can of carrots.  I brushed the puffs with egg white and sprinkled some poultry season on top. Very tasty.

I made this to take to a bunco get together, and everyone loved it.   My teen daughter got to taste test before hand and she asked me to make it again.  I did do as one reviewer suggested and brushed them with beaten egg, mainly to make them look prettier, and sprinkled with garlic.  The next time I made them, I added broccoli to the mixture and those were delicious as well.  Will definitely be on my list, both for family dinners or something to serve friends, as it tastes great and looks pretty, also!

Very good. I usually add thawed out broccoli florets to the mix to get some veggies in.

Good comfort food! Quite easy to make (you spend a bit of time squishing the triangles together, but it's totally reasonable). I struggled with fitting any amount of mixture into the triangles when I cut them into 12's, so I just left them in the shape that they come in from the tube (8's) - I was able to fit more into each one and it saved time squishing the triangles into rectangles and then cutting more triangles out. Thanks for the recipe! Will absolutely make again :)

Good but very buttery. I would recommend cutting the butter in half or even to a quarter of what is called for.

Made these last night, followed the recipe exactly.  Although the recipe states 12, I'm not sure where that number comes from.  I had 24, which was 3 cans of croissants.  Anyways, they are amazingly delicious!  One reviewer suggested letting the chicken cool first, which is sound advice because my mix was very runny and I had a really hard time sealing up the edges.  I had a fair amount of leakage during the baking process, but they were still perfect and delicious.  Will def make a again!

My husband and I really liked these I might decrease the butter and increase the cream cheese next time though. I did use chive flavored cream cheese so the flavors were fairly strong, but my husband and I like it that way.

Wonderful, but one catch: The printed recipe says to place the mixture "on each rectangle," but the video shows and says "triangle." May want to revise for less experienced cooks who may get confused and think that two perforated triangles on the dough should be combined to make one rectangle.

Mmm I can already tell these won't last long at my house! I used the healthy recommendation of some reviewers and didn't use butter, just a little splash of milk. I also used low-fat cream cheese and crescent rolls. They taste amazing and I can't wait to customize with new fillings! I used Perdue Short Cuts to make it easier too. Definitely will make again!

I was really disappointed since all the reviews were so great...
No body liked them. And I followed the recipe exactly... Maybe if the dough was homemade and not the pre made rolls it would have been better.

I'm not going to lie, I did this with lots of shortcuts. I used a can of chicken, a tablespoon of dried, minced onion, a half teaspoon of garlic, 4oz of onion and chive soft creams cheese spread, and a quarter cup of ranch dressing. I spread it thickly on unrolled crescent rolls and sprinkled some chopped red pepper on top. Baked it for 10-15 minutes and it was DARN  tastey.  Has a lot of potential as an appetizer or dip. The peppers were awesome with it.  Next time I may add spinach.  If you like the chicken and biscuit crackers, this is has the same flavor only hearty and much more satisfying.

The taste was great, however, I had to bake them for quite a bit longer than the 12 minutes at 325. It may have just been my oven, but I ended up baking them for almost 20 minutes before they browned. I used canned chicken breast, and browned it up in the pan with the onions and garlic, added a little Italian seasoning, and added some chopped broccoli in with the cream cheese and butter. They were magnificent!

Quick, easy and delicious. Next time I'll cut the onions by a third. I had to low broil for 3 minutes to get it to brown up. I'll be trying it with spinach added next time as well. A keeper.

These are okay if you double up on the chicken in the filling but I don't like the store bought biscuits in the recipe.  They make it taste really overly buttery. If I make these again they will be made with homemade biscuits. Just not feeling buttery chicken.

My kids really loved this.  Of course, I made quite a few changes.  I poached my chicken the night before in broth to keep them moist.  I diced them cold and while I did that I sauteed baby bella mushroom and onion (diced) in olive oil.  I mixed the three and then added Philadelphia Cooking Cream in Savory Garlic.  (http://www.kraftrecipes.com/philadelphia/cooking-creme/savory-garlic.aspx).  Just seemed easier than mixing.   Rolled them into individual crescents and baked about 15 minutes (took longer than package says).

I baked this for the first time tonight for dinner.  We have a 5 person family - my husband and I, and our three boys.  I usually have to make recipes that are designed for 8-10 people.  With this recipe I actually have leftovers for a change. Not a single one of them left the table hungry tonight either.  They kept saying over and over about how good the "Chicken Rolls" were, and that I should make them again soon.  Gotta love it!  Thanks for making me feel like Super-Mom!

The only suggestions I would make are, if you are cutting the triangles in half, only use one rounded teaspoon of mixture for each.  Otherwise, use the tablespoon for the full triangle.  Also, you could easily use half the suggested amount of butter and get the same result.  Rolling/folding the balls is a little awkward at first, but you will get the hang of it as you go.

My hubby and I loved this recipe. We used Light butter to make it a tad more healthier and instead of making them into balls, we folded the sides over one another and it cooked up very nicely (uploaded a pic).

I will definitely make this again. A great base recipe to try other fillings as well!

Tried this recipe out on my family.  They loved it.  After two bites of it, all were asking when the next time was could have this.  I left out the garlic (food allergy) and used onion powder instead of the onion to flavor the mix.  I also added florets of broccoli (chopped small).  As it turned out, my husband enjoyed them so much we made a trip to other members of our family in the local area to share with them.  
This is a wonderfully flexible recipe to use salmon, beef, pork, etc... and it is sooooo easy.  I plan to use this also for an upcoming family reunion that we are hosting.

Fantastic!  My fiance loved this!  :)
Next time I will add a few more spices, maybe some curry!  
Thank you for sharing this easy, delicious recipe!

as is the filling is pretty good. I jazzed it up a little: subsituted the small amount of goat cheese (chevre) I had in the fridge for on of the TB of butter. I only made a half batch with a small family...so was about 2 TB butter and 1 TB chevre. I doubled the  (red) onion...used 3 TB to a half batch and used 1 tube of crescent rolls for the half batch........they were well stuffed with chicken! 5 stars with more onion and the goat cheese for added flavor,\

Had I given this review an hour ago, it would've been totally different.  My daughter and I tasted these out of the oven and decided the cream cheese was totally overpowering. 

However, I packed some to go and took them to a friend's house for his opinion.  He actually thought they were pretty good.  

When I returned home, I was hungry and had another.  They actually taste better after they've cooled off.  Some of the cheese soaks into the bread and takes a bit of the cream cheesiness away...

So I would serve these room temperature.  I made these as directed except I added garlic salt to the chicken while browning it and added poultry seasoning to the chicken/cheese mixture.  I also made 1/2 the batch on a cookie sheet and the other half in a muffin pan to see which I prefered.  The cookie sheet  produced a "cuter" result which was nice and brown on the bottom.  They can also be cut into halves or quarters.  The muffin pan puffs must be served whole.  If you use the muffin pans, remove them as soon as they cool or they will get soggy at the bottom if you let them sit. 

I rate it 4 stars because though these taste decent enough, I'm not sure these are worth effort of playing with the crescent roll dough.

I tried this recipe last night.  I left out the onions because I am not a fan, and as others suggested, left out the butter.  It was amazing! My boyfriend and I really enjoyed them! Thank you for the great recipe!

My friends and family like their food spicy and flavorful, so I added diced jalapeños, and a little curry powder to the chicken/ creamcheese mixture. I also baked some in muffins tins in addition to using a cookie sheet. The ones on the cookie sheet were crispier on the bottom, which I prefered. Overall, everyone thought they were delicious. I would make them again... They're also good cold, and make good leftovers.

I made these one night to try something different. I tried to make it as easy as possible so I used a large can of Tyson canned chicken chunks. It cut down on the time a lot. I also put the leftovers in the fridge and gave them to my mother the next day and she is still raving about them!

Im not much of a "measurer", but im also not perfect, so the way I threw together this recipe, it left me with more chicken mix than rolls. My husband used to chicken mix cold and made sandwiches out of them, very tasty.

I used chicken thighs and added some fresh chopped parsley to the filling. They were great. Only issue I had was that I had to bake them for about 18 mins to make sure the croissants weren't "doughy".

Wonderful recipe, thank you! I made my own dough using the dough setting on my bread maker, adding  2Tb of Italian Seasoning. I used canned chicken (2-12.5 ounce) I had no chicken on hand. So I had to variate the first steps. I added mushrooms to my saute, along with the onions and garlic, while I set aside the already mixed chicken with cream cheese. It made 18 chicken puffs for me. Caution: do not butter pan. Also if you make your own dough, make sure the bottom has enough dough to make a nice bottom crust.

My family has been makinh these for years. I usually skip the onion and garlic and instead add Garlic Garlic from Tasefully Simple and brush the crescent dough with melted butter, top with crushed garlic cheese croutons and when done pour heated cream soup over- mushroom or cream of chicken are our favorites. The filling is so versatile, i have added a packet of ranch dressing mix, italian seasoning (which I served with homemade alfredo sauce poured over) and even leftover fajita seasoned chicken and peppers. I usually use 4 oz of cream cheese and 1 cup cubed cooked chicken for each roll of crescent dough.

Terrific recipe.  Quick and easy.  Simple to change the yield down to 4 and change up the ingredients to suit your tastes.  I'll bet spinach added is good, as a couple of people have suggested.

These are pretty good and have good flavor however I would definitely consider them an appetizer!  Perfect as a meal starter when entertaining guests or for a football get together!  I will add some green pepper finely chopped next time for more flavor!

This is a great recipe!  I made this for the first time and my family loved it.  I used 3 tbsp of butter but I think next time I will eliminate the butter all together and use milk instead.  I definitely will be putting this recipe in my monthly rotation!

GREAT recipe! My boyfriend raved about these, and even said he wanted to give the recipe to his mom (who is supposedly the best cook he knows ;) ) I added mushrooms in the chicken/onion pan, and sprinkled fresh parsley on top, for color. Definitely a 'do-again.'

This was so awesome! I rarely cook at all, we eat out all the time, I decided to get a couple recipes and try something and it was so great! And best of all my boyfriend actually liked something I made, he ate almost all of them, he rarely likes my attempts at cooking.

Loved them!!  We made these for our dinner with a nice salad, made exactly to recipe.  Next time I might reduce the butter a bit, but perfect aside from that. Also they were fast and easy to prepare.

Awesome chicken mix recipe. I would change 2 things 
1st, add spices while sauteing chicken to add flavor
2nd ditch the crescent roll dough and use pre made biscuit dough and roll out a little and then enclose chicken mix in the dough. That was the worst part of the recipe the crescent roll dough! Otherwise totally awesome ..big crowd pleaser in our home of 11 people !!!

Loved this recipe!  Very easy to prepare and they turned out great!  I used boiled chicken tenders cut up.  I sauteed the onion and garlic and then mixed the chicken and cream cheese all together in the same pot until blended.  Most of my family loved them, but my little ones weren't thrilled.  I used a pie shell out of the freezer and mixed broccoli and cheese in with the remaining chicken mixture.  It made an awesome pie for lunch today.  Will definetly add this recipe to the box and I"ve shared it on my Facebook page already with several of my friends.

I made this recipe just as it called for, but made the puffs bigger, so it was dinner portion.  I was not crazy about it.  Wasn't bad, just wasn't really very flavorful.  Make sure that you use really good dough, I think that would make all the differnce in the world. I would try this again and make some adjustments to it.

I made this for dinner tonight. The only thing I changed was I added mushrooms. My husband loved it and we had a little extra sauce to pour over the Puffs right out of the oven, which took it to a whole new level.

I used to make this all the time, I had a craving for it and I'm glad I found it again. I make my inside a little different. I boil and shred the chicken. Put in the cream cheese a dash of milk, (not butter) and add pepper, green chiles, green onions, cheddar cheese and occasionally broccoli and they turn out delicious.

My husband decided to get creative with this recipe the night it was his turn to cook.  He added 1 finely diced stalk of celery which gave an interesting crunchiness.
Then he brushed the tops of the rolls with butter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  WOW.  Turned this really good recipe into something even more special.

These were pretty good.  I added some diced zucchini because I wanted a vegetable in it.  I added the zucchini to the chicken/onion after about five minutes of cooking time so that it was not overdone.  It was perfect.  I think in the future I might add broccoli or maybe even diced potato.  I also will use a touch less garlic.

Great recipe. The puffs are delicious.  Time consuming so one day I really wanted them but had little time so I used a 13inch pan and placed a layer of croissant on the bottom, filling in the middle and topped with croissant and cooked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Not as good as puffs but still very good and quick on top of it.

I didn't have crescent rolls, just a can of buttermilk biscuits. I rolled them flat and put the chicken mixture in them, and they worked just fine-cooking for only 8 minutes.  For the chicken I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash's chipotle seasoning and left out the butter. They turned out so YUMMY!

Made these last nite and my family really liked them. It was really good! I had chicken mixture left over. The only thing I did differently was that I had cooked a whole chicken in the crockpot to use dark meat for checken and dumplings this weekend.  I just used the breasts from that and put them in the skillet with the onions and garlic to mix (along with about quarter cup of reserved chicken broth) since the chicken was already cooked. We did have about half left over since we are trying to watch our portions. I also increased cooking time to get rolls to brown more instead of brushing with eggwhite but they still turned out awesome!!

My son said to make these again! he's my true tester.
I followed recipe,but instead of real onion,added onion flakes and green onion. Was a tad bland but still
pretty good with the crescent roll. Will make these again but next time add some more flavor. Thanks !

These were fun to try out, but I agree that they were a little bland. It didn't stop us from eating them all though! I think maybe the dough was a little too doughy afterwards, and next time I might try to add some cayenne pepper to make it nice and spicy. Fun to make and eat though! I'll try it again!

We love these! I've easily made these several times with leftover shredded chicken. To work in some veggies and make more of a mini potpie I added 1/4 c peas, 1/4 c shredded carrots, and 1/4 c finely chopped celery. They're a hit!

I've made this several times now. The great thing about this recipe is that it can easily be played with to suit your taste. I used lower-fat cream cheese, eliminated the butter completely, added some chives and also used onion powder to bypass the complaints of four kids who hate onions. Everyone loves this, which is amazing for a picky family of six, and they taste even better the next day!

Good recipe as-is but like it better as a chicken pot pie! I reduced the amount of cream cheese (used 'light' cream cheese), eliminated the butter, added some cream of chicken soup (or cream of broccoli/asperagus, etc. - low sodium is best) and par-boiled veggies and baked as described. I get 4 large "pies" from a single "jumbo" crescent dough tube. Easiest chicken pot pie ever!

I added a few things to this.  First, I used rotisserie chicken (chopped).  Cooked mushrooms and onions in butter until soft.  Added chicken, garlic, cream cheese, chives and cooked through.  Added half and half instead of the butter.  My husband LOVED THIS!  I think next time I might add frozen peas and maybe even bacon.  A little wine would be a nice touch too!

I've made these for years. Perfect to make ahead of time for those kids' sports nights. They get a healthy meal instead of quick junk! Add some curry to the mixture and season the outside of the roll with a touch of garlic salt/butter before baking...a winner with my kids and their friends. Always make a double batch. They'll eat seconds and thirds!

So there's a recipe on this sight similar to this that uses Puff Pastry instead of Crescent rolls....so what I did that "differed" was I just used the cream cheese with chives and onions already mixed in (save a step!)....cooked up the chicken with some mushrooms and onions and voila! Was definitely a hit. Thank you for the suggestion of the crescent rolls, made the recipe much easier and was VERY delicious!

This was very good. I prefer grilled chicken, I put the breasts into a bag with oil, salt and garlic powder. Then I grilled them and let them cool a little. They were delicious.

Will make these again!  I used slow baked chicken thighs which have more flavor than breasts, and sauteed finely chopped onion and red bell pepper in garlic herb seasoning, 5 peppercorn blend pepper, and salt with about 4 Tbsp butter and added it to the chicken.  I added regular cream cheese to the chicken mixture until I basically had chicken salad.  I added a few splashes of whole milk in between stirring to make it a little creamier. I then added 4-5oz of Italian cheese blend(mozza and parmesan).  I found crescent roll sheets without the perforations so all i had to do was roll out the sheet and cut them into wide strips and wrap them around heaping spoons of filling.  I baked at 325 until turning light golden then brushed with melted butter and baked some more until deeper golden.  I added a little more melted butter over the top after taking out of the oven.  The pockets were moist, the filling wasn't runny and tasted amazing.  These were a huge hit!

This was so tasty! I loved how creamy it was, however the sauce was so runny that it was very difficult to put it all in a ball. When we add the chicken from the saucepan to the other ingredients, the sauce became thin and hard to manage into the small balls. Overall a great recipe that I can't wait to use again!

This was fantastic. As most will do I did add some seasoning to the chicken to suit my own tastes. I also used 4ozs of onion and chive cream cheese and 4ozs of regular cream cheese. I forsee this becoming a regular meal for my family. Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.

i got this via email as a must try dish...yeah didn't really do it for me....the chicken mixture ideal is fine,but to put the cream cheese with the cresent rolls, it's just too much, not really sure what you're eating...but then again I haven't really found any dish made with crescent rolls, biscuits or any other type food like that, that i enjoy...just too processed I guess, I make most things from scratch

Unique, tasty dish. Made no changes other than using low fat chive cream cheese. and less butter. Found I had to leave them in the oven longer than the 12 minutes (more like 15-20 min).

these were excellent, but i had to make a few modifications - which is why they received four stars.  my changes: i took the advice of others and use chive and onion cream cheese. i doubled up on the onions and garlic. i added mushrooms as well. the recipe doesn't say to cut up the chicken, but you'll need to do this as well. i used half the amount of butter and waited for the chicken mixture to cool before adding the cream cheese and butter. i had to cook my puffs longer - but i used a glass pan just in case they spilled over. i dusted the tops with butter and added garlic powder. YUM!   some comments i received from the husband: they could be spicier. I think i'll add in some pepper or cayenne.

Hello Heaven!!!  These are absolutely delicious!  I used a rotisserie chicken and just shredded the chicken off until I felt there was enough chicken in the bowl.  I used chive cream cheese, so yummy!!!  This will be a regular, it was so delicious and so simple!  This is a must try!

Either I did something wrong or these are just bad.  What it so great?  They are over-crusted, there is no flavor inside.  Thought of putting something else-like some spice.

THese were ok. Very cream cheesy. The croissants made it sweet. I added basil and pepper for spice, and carrot and celery for veg. Maybe I'd try again with cream of chick. soup instead of cream cheese & butter, and biscuit instead of croissant?

I really liked this recipe I would have to say it turned out a little bland next time I think ill add broccoli and a bit of pepper. Very easy to make and the little ones liked it too.

I REALLY like cream cheese, but honestly these were so cream cheesy they were hard to ingest in my opinion, maybe because they're so rich.  I made these for dinner, but they really might be better appetizer-sized and served on a buffet.  I used 2 chicken breasts (in retrospect 3 maybe would have cut down on the definitive cream cheese taste) and 2 cans crescent rolls.  I caramelized a whole sweet onion and used an 8 oz. garlic and herb cream cheese spread.  I combined all ingredients in my stand mixer and let set in fridge for 30 minutes before placing about 1/2 c on each of 6 rectangles and folding into a ball.  I brushed with a whole egg and let stand in fridge until I cooked them later that night.  No one in the family cared for these.  I still have some in the freezer and I don't think I'll be making, again.

This was good.  I don't recommend making at the last minute because you do need time for the chicken to cool before adding the cream cheese, or it will be runny and difficult to wrap.  Had to cook for twice the length of time - next time I'll follow the cooking instructions on the crescent roll pack.  After reading reviews that said it was bland, I added extra onions to my chicken, and also a pinch of basil, marjoram, thyme, salt and pepper.  Also added a bit of parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture.  DH called them pot pies, and that is what they tasted like.  Next time I won't get the large size crescent rolls, though.  If you end up with extra crescent roll dough, don't throw it out, just roll them up and make crescent rolls - they're good!

Great! I used biscuit dough instead of crescent and I used green onion instead of yellow. I also added some chicken grill seasoning and forgot the butter. Even with all these changes it was a great recipe!

This was enjoyed by all, served with mashed potatoes, and broccoli.  I was confused on the dough directions, so I decided to take one can, lay it out as a bottom crust in an 8x11 pan, pushing the seams together.  I baked it for about 15 min.  Then poured the chicken mixture in...and then topped with a second can of dough.  I baked a second time for about 20-25 minutes, and it was perfect.  Thanks!  I bet it would be tasty with some mixed veggies thrown in, a la chicken pot pie.  Yum!

Husband and kidlets really liked this. Sent two chicken puffs in kidlet's lunchbox the next day too. The only thing is I wish I could put more stuffing in the puffs. Next time, I would like to try layering like a cream cheese danish and see how it works out. Served with "Bacon and Tomato Cups" and mixed veggies. UPDATE: This recipe is really good but I do prefer "Savory Crescent Chicken."

My mom made this recipe while I was growing up and it is now one of my husbands favs.  We put celery in the mixture to add texture.  Then roll the bundles in butter and bread crumbs before baking.  Finally, we top the bundles with a gravy made of 1 c. sour cream and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  Muy delicioso!

Loved the recipe as is but I loved the filling so much that i made some alterations to the recipe and had to share! I turned this into a pasta dish with linguini noodles and it is so rich and delicious. I used the filling recipe and just added a can of rotel tomatos with chiles, it added some spice and a little tang. DELICIOUS!! Thanks for the recipe.

YUM-mee!!  I minced some leftover broccoli to add mostly for color but it gave a nice texture too.  I froze the leftovers and they made handy lunchbox fare.  Microwave, wrap in foil, then a sandwich baggie and it's good to go.

Everyone ate them at dinner. (So nice)
And enjoyed them. (Even nicer)
I followed the recipe exactly. So this is a true rating. I laid out all the 12 rectangles to fill,(2 croissant triangles together), and put about 1 Tablespoon of filling in the center as called for. Just so you know it really is more like 2+. It honestly doesn't matter, but I just thought for the people who fill one at a time and roll instead of fill them all then roll, it may be of help, so you are not left with tons of filling.

This is just ok. It's a good base, def needs tweaking. The filling tasted a bit bland. I used up only 2 cans of the crescent rolls.  Will probably make again, but will add more seasoning to the fillings.

These were interesting. I like the change from our normal routine. Use lots of garlic or the garlic cresants. If you don't like cream cheese I don't think you'll like these. I will make again.

These turned out wonderful!  I did make several changes though.  As Judy Jones (in a previous review) recommended I boiled 2 bone in chicken breast in ck. broth for about 25 min. Mean while I sauted diced white onion in 1T of butter and a pinch of garlic powder and added to the cream cheese (3/4 block).  I omitted all the rest of the butter.  I will definately make these again!

These are very good, they take a bit of time to prepare but here are a few tips:
Buy the crescent roll sheets not the individual ones as they tend to ooze at the seams and rather than try to make them into a ball just fold the short sides up and in over the filling some then fold the long sides in to meet in the middle and tuck them around and under the sides, makes kindof a pocket but is much easier to transport to the baking sheet and has much less chance of splitting. I look forward to making them again and will boil and shred the chicken then saute with the onions.

I love this recipe! Although Im trying to get the kids to eat more veggies so I added some dry ranch and finely chopped broccoli, corn, peppers and some parmesan.
I also made them bigger like a hotpocket!

They LOVED it!
Thank you!

These were really good, though admittedly, I tweaked them slightly.  I baked the chicken ahead of time with some fresh mushrooms, then chopped into small pieces.  I added the cream cheese, maybe 2 tablespoons of Smart Balance, the garlic, some chopped pimentos, a little pepper and seasoned salt.  I also baked them at 375 for about 25 minutes, and they were PERFECT!!  We all loved them, thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was pretty good.  I think next time I make it, I am going to add some finely chopped veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, and/or carrots to make it a meal in one!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were great!  I sauteed half a large onion and 3-4 heaping Tbsp garlic in a little olive oil and added whole chicken breasts with a little salt and pepper.  Shredded chicken and mixed with an entire packet of cream cheese, no butter.  The first time I attempted to use the croissant dough, I had a hard time seaming it all together and ended up with large hot pockets.  The next time, I used the individual triangles and brought the 3 corners up together - much easier to manage.  I can't wait to make these for Bunco night this weekend!

These were good, but not great, although my daughter ate them until she was so full she was ill!  I will make again, but will alter a bit, maybe some shredded cheese or other additions to give it a little more flavor.

Why does everyone say chicken breast halves when the packages at the grocery store say chicken breasts? I bought a smaller package, but had the intention of doubling the recipe, thus only came out with half the expected amount. However, very delicious!

These turned out good but lacked a lot of flavour.  I did enjoy them but when I make them again I will try some changes.

Made these again last night with a couple of additions: I added fresh baby spinach, garlic powder and salad herbs (ClubHouse has a nice blend).  I served this to company and they took home leftovers!  This is a make again...and again. :)

we have been making these for years.  we call them chicken things. we serve ours with chicken gravy on top.  try taco things by filling puffs with taco meat, black beans, rice, and cheese.  serve these with melted cheese sauce on top.

I have made these for a few years now.  I am the mother of two small children and they love them.  Also, instead of chicken breasts I use one large can of white chicken.  It is found where the tuna is.  I don't use the onions or garlic.  I make a gravy to go with it.   That consists of 8 oz of sour cream and one can of cream of chicken soup.  Heat slowly.  This is a huge hit.  My nephew whom is very picky even eats them.

My family has enjoyed these for years. I add a small can of mushrooms, chopped, and pimentos. I top with a "gravy" made from a can of cream of mushroom soup and a half can of milk, combined and heated through.

A good feels like home meal. I agree that there is too much cream cheese..but I still liked it! I might try to add some broccoli the next time I make it.
When you making it...you might think that there is too much garlic...there is NOT! The cream cheese tends to over power the garlic and onion flavors...so don't skimp on them. I used non-fat creamcheese and the new 50/50blend of butter by SmartBalance to reduce the fat content.

Love this recipe.  Was so easy and my four small boys thought it was great too.  Changed a few things to make it work with what I had.  Added garlic salt, onion powder, and paprika to one side of each (whole)chicken breast.  Cooked 3-4 min each side.  Removed and chopped.  Sauteed onion and garlic in same pan.  Combined with shredded cheese instead of cream cheese and 4 T butter.  Stuffed mixture in two cans of refrigerated biscuits instead of croissants.  Flatten each biscuit and put T mix in fold up and pinch together.  Seal side down on pan.  Cooked 12 min.  Great!

I learned almost the exact same recipe from a friend years ago and everyone loves it. Really the only difference is that I add two celery stalks, it adds a little crisp to it. I also brush the tops with butter and add crushed croûtons before baking and top with gravy. If you are in a hurry, canned chicken works really well with this recipe, just mix all the ingredients, add the mixture to the crust, close them up and stick them in the oven according to the croissant cooking instructions or golden on top. No need to cook the other ingredients first. We called them chicken squares :)

I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I was a little disappointed because like other cooks, I found it a little bland.  I will definitely make it again, but will add spinich and some spices.  Overall, very nice recipe..

My family loved this recipe, I changed a couple things.  I used grand buscuits and rolled them out and made them bigger.  I put a little shredded cheddar cheese on the rolled out buscuit before adding the chicken mixture.  I rolled them up, and added spadel ranch seasoning on top.  My 15 year old daughter is a picky eater, and she had seconds, no left overs!!!!!

Next time I'll add a bit of GREEK flair using marinated grilled chicken, broccoli and feta cheese. I'll also do the braided rolls.  Instead of gravy I'll use taziki sauce. Your mouths watering huh!

My family loved these & so did I. Only 2 things that bothered me. 1. They take a long time to make and 2. they don't keep well. Only make what you can eat as they will be soggy the next day but still tast good if you like soggy... Update: I have now made these a few time per my Ug's request and it is not as hard to make as I first thought and they were less soggy the next day. My Ug takes them with him to work and has told almost everyone there about them. I have had to send a few copies of this with him for his buddies. So, he has asked me to up it to a 5 star so for him I will do this for him but for me it is still a 4 star...

I felt it was similar to a crab rangoon, but softer in texture, and with chicken.  I will make again, but will play with the recipe.  Needs some spices.

Love this recipe :) I made some modifications for my family.  I use low fat cream cheese and low fat crescent rolls.  I also add a bit of black pepper and basil.  Plus I make a packet of chicken gravy to moisten it up a bit.  This is a great recipe and people just love them!  I am asked to bring them every time we have a potluck.

Instead of chicken use 1 1/2 cups of chopped, well drained "WHOLE" clams (freshly steamed or canned).

Now you have instant clam puffs. Try using chive or salmon cream cheese.  Ray

I have also made these for years after someone else introduced them to me.  One other thing that I do is, before putting them in the oven, I spritz them with spray butter and then sprinkle bread crumbs on top.

Great idea! I added cooked diced potato, basil, ground black pepper, shredded cheese (1/4 c.), and used herbed cream cheese. Next time, I will add some more spices for a little "kick" and make the puffs smaller so that they can be bite-size appetizers. Otherwise, great chicken pockets for on-the-go lunches! :)

The recipe was easy  but was bland.  It needs an ingredient or two to make it more flavorful but have not figured ou what that would be.  It also lacked color so maybe adding fresh spinach to the chicken mixture is the answer.

Fabulous!  Everyone loved them.  Followed the suggestions of others .  I didn't use butter but added a little milk, brushed with egg and sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs.  Don't forget to line your pan with parchment paper.

My family and I really liked this recipe. The only things we are gonna change next time is use two cans of dough since there is only two of us and add a little more mixture to the balls. We also think they need to be cooked longer then 12 minutes

This is a great weekend meal for movie night or game afternoons. We’ve made this many times and prefer it with less garlic. It’s a great way to use canned chicken if you’ve bought a ton from the bulk store. One large can usually works.

I really like this recipe but don’t do it often because of the calories. Since we use cubed chicken, I recommend that you bump the crescent rolls up to 2 or 3 instead of 1 can. Then you can actually have them as dinner.

So, I added celery, and cooked the chicken in a white wine, and used Boursin rather than cream cheese, and skipped the butter.  It took 4 cans of crescent rolls,  and they really needed to bake 16 minutes to get that nice golden brown. (The egg wash helped.)

Everyone loves this recipe. It's so easy to throw together for a quick dinner. My daughter's friends love it and want their moms to make it too. I have given it to more people than I can count. The only change I made was to use biscuits instead of crescent rolls. It was what I had on hand. I do prefer folding them over like a turnover rather than in a round ball. Just personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!

It's really hard to go wrong with this recipe. If you have the chicken, cream cheese and crescent dough, you should be at 4 stars already. I like to saute onions, celery and garlic and add it to the cream cheese and chicken mixture. I season to taste with salt and pepper. And that's it. It's super easy and sooo good.

I substituted Jamaican Pulled Pork I had made a few days earlier slow cooked in the crock pot.  The extra spice mingled nicely with the cream cheese and butter.

Turned out GREAT.  Hubby loved them, easy to freeze for company.
 Needs a few more minutes than recipe said ...

These are great and my 4 year olds helped me make them- even better! I seasoned the chicken with onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper. We cooked them a bit longer in the oven, about 14 min cooked the dough through. Thanks for the great recipe- it's a keeper!

Way too greasy.  Needs more chicken or cut back on the butter/cream cheese combo.  I ran out of filling with only one tube.

My family loved these!  After reading other reviews I shredded the chicken and used whipped onion and chive cream cheese and the crescent roll sheets and garlic.  It was so easy to make that my 10 year old did pretty much all of it.  The only reason is not 5 stars is because my husband and I both felt that there was some kind of flavor missing.  We couldn't quiet figure out what it was missing, but it needs a little something.  Either way, everyone requested I make it again.

Easy to make with few ingredients. Next time I'll reduce the amount of cream cheese and butter used by half.

I didn't have canned croscent rolls or time to make them from scratch, so I made biscuits (my favorite recipe, from the Complete Step by Step cookbook). It took a batch and a half of the biscuits to use up the filling, making 9 chicken puffs (and leaving me with some dough to make biscuits for beakfast). The only adjustment I made was the oven temp. The biscuits cook at 450°F and I cooked them for 10-12 minutes.
I loved this recipe and plan to make it again.

I really liked the concept of this recipe, but following the recipe as it is stated was not very good to me. I felt it was bland. For as much fat as is in this meal, I thought it would have been more flavorful. There is no mention of salt or pepper, but it needed it. And the cream cheese was also just too mild to really notice. Next time I will try shredding chicken and adding some green onions, sharp shredded cheddar cheese and seasoning. The butter seemed pointless to me and gave unnecessary calories I didn't feel like I could really taste. Two stars for the idea, but just didn't like this specific recipe.

It was just too rich for me. Maybe I would make them again as an appetizer, but I'd shred the chicken, cut out some of the butter and maybe substitute greek yogurt. Plus I'd add some more spices to it to give it some kick.

Everyone in my house loves this recipe! I add a little more cream cheese and chicken and really fill up the crescent rolls...sometimes I also add fresh chopped mushrooms.  There are so many ways to tweak this recipe! One time I even accidentally dropped cheese from au gratin potatoes into the bowl with the chicken mix and decided to go ahead and see what it would taste like...everyone really loved it!

It tastes great! It's very easy to make.  If you're not a huge onion or garlic fan you may want to cut back a little here. 

Also, you'll definitely need more food as these are rather small, (but I guess that depends on how big you make them). Overall it was a great recipe that we will be making again.

I changed LOTS about this recipe so it's probably not fair to rate it a five.
I cooked two small in onions in about 4T butter over low heat. Added about five medium carrots cut into small pieces and cooked until tender. Added 4T flour and cooked about 3 minutes. Added a cup and a half of warm milk along with some nutmeg and fresh rosemary and cooked until thickened. Then I added about two cups of grated zucchini and cooked another few minutes. I boiled the chicken - three large breasts - and added it in. When I put them all together I had quite a bit of filling left over, but I probably could have stuffed them more. Alternately I could have used less zucchini.
I baked them in a muffin tin which worked really well. I'm think that next time I'll make one big pie instead of fussing around with all the little bitty puffs.

Liked this.  It is a simple comfort food.  Good for a rainy day lunch.  We served it with soup.  I put rolls on parchemnt paper, as one reviewer recommended.  Also, i cooled the chicken before i mixed it with the cream cheese.  Try to put as much filling in each roll as you can.  The second time: I followed the advice of others to make them with less calories.  I used low fat sour cream and low fat mayo in place of cream cheese and i used NO BUTTER.  Sautéed canned mushrooms with the garlic and onions.  Yum.

My teenage stepson couldn't stop eating these. I used chive and onion cream cheese. I omitted the onion but added chopped cooked broccoli and 1/4 cup of parm. cheese to the mix, brushed top with egg whites. Delicious! Even warmed up the next day.

This was a great recipe, and like others mentioned, only benefits by adding flavor.  I boiled the chicken breasts in water with salt and seasoning salt, then added a small amount of the broth to the cream cheese mixture.  I also omitted the butter but sauteed the garlic and onion in coconut oil, which added more, subtle flavor.  My 5-year-old asked me to serve it every night!

Use frozen puff pastry sheets in place of the crescent rolls - you don't get the greasy, fake buttery flavor you get with the rolls and it puffs up much better.

I loved these. I made my own little adjustments... I chopped jalapeno and cooked it with the chicken. Also, I only used 3 tablespoons of butter and a whole package of cream cheese. It was so good. My husband and I loved it. We ate our chicken puffs with some broccoli and spinach, yum.

Filling tastes great alone. The crescent dough ruins it and makes this overly rich and bland . If I made again I would roll the dough thinner and maybe add more garlic or hatch peppers to the chicken mixture....

it also took me about 27 minutes on 325 to get these browned due to dough thickness.

Good recipe - try adding cooked chopped broccoli !  I make my recipe a little different using Crazy Janes mixed seasoning instead of adding onions and garlic.  Also I use a little less butter and add a few teaspoons of milk.

I made this recipe the other night for my family and it was awesome the kids and adults alike loved it, mine was a bit runny because I had cooked up some frozen chicken breasts and didn't drain the water enough so we had a lot left over because I had to add more chicken and cream cheese. I sent the extras home with my mom and she mixed in a package of dry ranch seasoning and said it was even better that way.

These puffs received hearty approval at my house.  I baked them in a muffin tin rather than on a baking sheet so my husband thought they were little pot pies.  This observation gave me the idea of adding some frozen vegetables to the mixture next time.  I also brushed the puffs with olive oil and then sprinkled on butter buds and Mrs. Dash garlic and herb blend.  Delicious!

It was a little bland. I think a little cheddar cheese could help. My picky 5 year old enjoyed it though!! Will make again and put my own spin on it.

I made this for my husband last night.  He took one bite and said, "I love you".  I think he likes it. This is going in the rotation.  Instead of using butter I used a full package of cream cheese and they turned out great.  Sprinkling the top with garlic salt was a great addition too.

Not a huge hit at our house.... these are also time consuming and the recipe directions are vague, I had to watch a video on how to roll these, in the video it said to place these seam down which I did. Flavor was just ok..

This was an absolute hit. We did add some chicken mesquite rub for taste. Even our picky eater loved it. She had 4 of them! I will definitely be making this again.

They're tasty, I'll give them that. Filling too. Bit too much cream cheese for my tastes though. My only gripe is it takes far longer to make than what the recipe says, closer to an hour total.

This was really good.  I added some diced zucchini since I had some and wanted some veggies with it.  I didn't use the butter but added some plain yogurt.  It turned out well and the family liked it.

Myself and my picky men loved this. I didn't have cream cheese so I substitited Chobani plain yogurt, sour cream, ricotta and I threw in a little cheddar cheese.  Was a bit bland for us so I added garlic salt and salt-free Mccormic reg seasoning. THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!!  YYUUMMMMMM!!!

Great base recipe!  I use green onion (food allergy) instead of regular and I precook the chicken and shred it so that it's not lumpy.  Also, a little cayenne and dijon mustard make great additional flavors.  Just for fun, I used this same premise when I had leftover Italian Beef for Sandwiches (another excellent recipe on this site) - used ricotta and parmesan cheeses instead of cream cheese and put a dollop of pizza sauce on it before I sealed them. Little sprinkle of Italian seasoning on to and VOILA!  YUM!!!  Thanks for the great inspiration!

Delicious!! Comfort food indeed :))
I pretty much followed it to a 't' except for the chicken breast part... I forgot to get chicken breasts at the store, but had drumsticks at home... baked the drumsticks (I know, added process) and then flaked the chicken into the cream cheese mixture and THEN baked the puffs w/ filler inside... still good!!

These were meh. I think next time I will use canned or slow-cooked shredded chicken rather than chopped, because the chunks were too chewy. There also wasn't much flavor, although I can see how it would be a good vehicle for almost any seasoning. Will try again another time!

I made these last night for my boyfriend...he absolutely loved them and has already asked when I will be making them again. I did everything exactly how the original recipe goes, but I used chive cream cheese instead and added a couple of spices to the chicken filling. They were easy to make and super delicious!

So good! I really liked these chicken puffs and even made some extras and froze them for my husband to bake when I'm not home. The only thing I did differently was half the garlic. It seamed like a lot and next time I will do the same and mince the garlic even finer so there are not bigger pieces of garlic to eat. I also think that it would taste great with cream of chicken drizzled over them.

My entire family LOVED these. I have never really cooked before, but i decided to try these just because of how good these looked. The are really easy to make, and the only difficult thing is wrapping them. After I got it down, they lured my roommate from upstairs from the smell. Amazing recipe, but I might try pre-minced garlic next time as that is what took the longest.

This is a great recipe.  Made it tonight and the kids loved it.  I added frozen leaf spinach to the mix.  I added it to the chicken while it was still sauteing on the stove to thaw and warm it up.  When I told the kids that the original recipe did not call for spinach they said they really liked having the spinach in it.

Fairly easy to make and really tasty! I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons and added a ton of basil, salt, and pepper.
I was unsure about trying this dish because I generally don't like cream cheese in food dishes (like cheesecake, crazy I know) and I was anticipating it to be heavier than it was.
I served it with broccoli and salad. If you're unsure, just give it a try! Don't be afraid of getting your hands a little messy, it's good!

I used the "light" option someone suggested (no butter, add milk to create a creamy texture). It was DELICIOUS. I had some trouble keeping my chicken mixture from oozing out the sides but they were mess-free to eat and super easy. Family LOVED them. Much like a mini chicken-and-buscuits. I would love to make them a larger size and add peas!

These were a big hit with my 4 year old. He ate 6 of them. That's a huge deal because we usually can't get him to eat. In my opinion they were good, but not fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. I'll make these again!

My family LOVED these! I did use canned chicken & added green peppers.  The kids took them for lunch the next day & I shared the recipie with my sister who made them that night & loves them too!  I always say that anthing with cream cheese has to be good!  Any left over filling would be good on a sandwich too :)

Love this recipe! My veneration: omit the butter and add light Mayo instead. Great additions: chives or green onions, pimentos, seasoned bread crumbs to roll the bundles in before baking. If you are in a hurry, skip the croissant dough and make grilled sandwiches instead (like a grilled cheese sandwich). Just warm the filling in the microwave a bit before spreading on the bread.

If you are a garlic/onion fan like I am, this is an amazing recipe.  If you are not, you may want to start by halving the amount of garlic and onion.  This is an awesome base recipe that has endless possibilities.  After reading other reviews, I did cheat and used canned chicken to save time; I also did not have croissants, so I used biscuits.  I don't usually rate recipes that I make changes to, but since I prefer real chicken to canned and croissants to biscuits, I cannot imagine how good this will be when I make it the 'correct' way next time!

Try buttering the tops and rolling them in dry stuffing mix before you bake them. Chopped mushrooms in the cream cheese mixture are also tasty, if you like that sort of thing.

Wow!  So delicious.  I didn't have croissants so I used Pillsbury pie crust...so they were more like a pasty.  I used 3/4 of an onion cooked in 3 T butter, garlic powder, and salt...all to taste.  I boiled my chicken and then cubed.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Easy and not alot of cleanup.

Super!  I had a cook them a little longer, but they turned out great.  Family enjoyed them as well.  I eliminated the butter a took suggestions from other reviewers; such as, adding milk to chicken and cheese mixture for better stirring and using egg washing then sprinkling with garlic powder before cooking.  I am thinking of doing a beef and a thai chicken version!

Good and different recipe for tailgating.  I made them one week and my son insisted I make them again the next weekend.  I ground the cooked chicken in the food processor to make easy to mix and eat.  I took them to a football game in the traveling casserole dish with the heated pad in it to keep them warm even though they are still pretty good cold.

Delicious! I added mushrooms, red pepper, green peas and sweet potato and used only 1 pkg light cream cheese and 6 chicken breasts. I omitted the butter as well. Thanks for the inspiration! The whole family loved them!

I used a bit more stuff in making mine. I cooked the chicken and used onions and garlic, but i threw that in a blender with some chipotle sauce. I mixed in cheddar a mozzarella cheese by hand. I rolled out regular biscuits and added a big spoon before i rolled it and put in oven. Husband and I liked it. it was simple and good.

DELISH!!! Got raves from my boyfriend, who is a meat and potatoes/casserole type of guy. I added some garlic/herb seasoning to the chicken mixture while cooking. I also spread melted butter and garlic powder on top before baking.. This is definitely a keeper!!!

all in all it was good. However, i do suggest you drain the chicken juices after it's been cooked. I am a beginner cooker and i examined the recipe like a hawk because something never goes right and the filling was extremely runny .... and unfortunately being a beginner and knowing nothing... i didn't know and it took almost an hour to prepare the meal :-( but it turned out ok... it ended up being croissants flavored in creamcheese and pieces of chicken inside.

I was surprised that I and my 6 year old liked this.  We are both picky eaters, but this turned out pretty good.  I did follow some others and did a few tweeks.  I sauted the chicken with the garlic and onion, but added some chicken seasoning salt, sage, and paprika.  Then I added a crushed up chicken boullion cube to the cream cheese along with chives.  Those additions seemed to tone down the cream cheesiness.

This was awesome!  My kids loved it.  I actually used my food processor to cut up some of the chicken into smaller pieces (only one or two pulses) just to make it fit into the crescents better...definitely a keeper!

I loved them but i did do a couple of changes ... since i wanted there to be more than just chicken i added a couple of veggies like carrots and peas ALSO .. instead of using a whole block of cream cheese what i did was that i got some chicken cream and used about 1/3 cup of that and then used half of the cream cheese block  and its like a lil chicken pot pie to go .. my family loved it and my little girl who tends to be very picky also loved them too and they are great b.c she can hold them(after being cooled )

These were so bland.  I went exactly to the recipe.  When reading other reviews I saw the "no brainer" one about letting the chicken cool before mixing in with the cream cheese.  That would have been nice to know in the recipe itself.  Some of us are not so savvy to figure that out.  I actually thought it was supposed to be hot in order to make the blending easier.  So when I put the tablespoon of mixture onto the rectangle it oozed all over and made forming into a ball impossible.  Still, my very picky child liked it okay.  For me it was terribly bland.  I will try it one more time but will do what another rater said that would be to add chives, lite cream cheese.

Yum!  I did change the proportions a bit.  I cut the butter in half and didn't find I needed to add anything else.  I also used lower fat cream cheese.  I also made fewer and increased the amount of filling.  A tablespoon per puff seemed like it might be skimpy.  So I made four bigger puffs (and have some filling left over).

Really enjoyed the filling but found the croissants to be too sweet.  I think next time I'll use the filling in a vol-au-vent case.

These were just o.k. as is.  I love cream cheese but it seemed overwhelming.  I like the idea and will use a buffalo chicken approach next time.  They do make a nice appetizer, if you just do little versions.

I found this pretty tasty. I did use the light cream cheese and added some sauteed carrots and red pepper. I will probably add more the next time as it gave it a nice crunch and snuck in some veggies.  I will also try and roll out the dough so it is thinner than how it comes. As I found the dough a little thick for my liking especially on the ends where I had to pinch it. I had one today that was chilled and I did like it cold also.

Love this meal- it's quick and my 3 children LOVE it as well.  However, I melt 2tbs of butter and baste the tops of my crescent rolls and then sprinkle bread crumbs on top and THEN bake them!!  It is just a great finishing touch!

These are really good.  You can lighten up by using less "lite" ingredients.  I served these to guests and they were gobbled up in no time.

This was very yummy to me. But I came across an issue... My crescent roll pack only made 6 triangles or 3 rectangles. (and I got the right size). This was an issue since I had company coming. I ended up makign a total of 15 (out of the triangles) and threw away the rest of the crescent roll dough because that is all the mixture I had. I did ad some fresh parm cheese and used my hand wand on the mixture. Was good but the stress of perhaps not having enough for my company was no fun 30 minutes before they got here.

You've got to like cream cheese.  I modified as others suggested and they turned out fine just bland.  The kids liked them.  This is a good basis idea for then modifying to suit your families tastes.

Tasty!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but used the same general concept.... I can see how this could be pretty versatile... you could add mixed veggies and use cream soup instead of cream cheese for little pot pie puffs, too!

These were okay. I liked the idea but not liking cream cheese i wasn't the biggest fan. I also thought they were kind of messy, best part of them was the condensed soup mix.

These turned out pretty good. they are sort of "plain" though.  I think some veggies in the mix would have helped.  I mixed the filling in my stand mixer and it was almost like a shredded chicken filling once mixed.  I'd make it again, but next time I think I'll add some veggies.

I would rate these a 3 the way I made them, so i'm giving them a 4 and adding some advise. I tried to make these healthier by omitting the butter and they were, not surprisingly, very dry. I also did not care for the warm cream cheese but i'm sure that's just personal taste.

Would have been a 5 if it included these changes...no butter in mixture, before puting them in the oven brush with melted butter and sprinkle california style garlic salt over top, and finally garnish with green onion.  Mmm, mmm good!

I would really give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. My very picky husband and my 2 kiddos loved it. I made it just like the recipe except when I put the chicken in the cream cheese mixture it became so runny that I couldn't spoon it out without it leaking everywhere. . .so I lined a 9x6 (?) with the crescents, spooned the mixture over, put a little garlic salt on top of that and the other crescents on top of that.  Turned out great but took longer to cook.  Great recipe!

These are good.  As written, I think they are kind of bland, but it's a really good start.  You can add lots of different fillings to suit your taste.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the garlic rolls are great with this.

I wish I had read to reduce or skip the butter.  I did reduce to 4T but still too much butter.  I am not sure the baking time/temp was correct.  I baked first batch at 325 and had to bake for 16 minutes.  I made another batched and used the temp on the crescent rolls package which was 375.  I baked that batch for 12 minutes and it seemed about right.  This recipe is pretty good.  I think eliminating the butter and adding cheddar would both be good ideas. I subbed Morningstar Farms soy chicken for the real deal -- just sort of chopped it up.

My family loved the chicken puffs. Including my picky 6 year old! I doubled the cream cheese (Next time I will use just a little less - but still more than the recipe calls for).  My husband and kids have been asking for more ever since.

I reduced the butter by half and used reduced fat cream cheese as well.  I guess my chicken breasts were on the small side, because I only had enough to fill 2 cans of cresent dough.  Served these at my election night party and they were a hit.

This was easy and a lot of fun to eat.  My kids loved it and so did it.  I just put too much into my puffs and next time I will just put a little less.  This was great as a meal.

These were pretty good.  We halved the recipe which made 2 for each of us using 1 can of crescent rolls.  I used onion and chive cream cheese as well.  Since we were serving as an entree, I added a lot more filling to each rectangle.  I'd say it was at least 1/3 cup for each.  I folded the corners of the rectangles over the filling making sure to press together any openings in the dough and then flipped them over and baked. Served with steamed green beans.

Yum! These are really good!  I made them for dinner & my husband didn't really like them too much, but I sure did!  I will make these again but as an appetizer and bring them to an upcoming potluck.  Can't wait to see how they go over there.

I thought these were kind of gross. But, my fiance loved them to death, so I'll compromise and give it three stars. I think I'd make them in the future with regular cheese instead of cream cheese maybe.

So good.  Hubby loved it . . . I didn't measure anything just eyed it & fantastic.  I threw the chicken, garlic, & some seasoning salt in the pan w/the onion & butter when onion was tender.  Used low-cal everything & turned out great!

They were gobbled up by all!
I ended up cooking boneless chicken breasts in sour cream and cream of chicken soup in the crock pot for about 4 hours on high (or 8 on low)until the meat fell apart. That gives the "stuffing" great flavor.

My Mom used to make these and now so do I.  It's one of my husbands favorite meals.  It's also very simple to make.

My husband absolutely loved them, but I thought they were a little salty. I took another reviewers advice and added garlic salt to the outside, don't, they don't need it! I will add a little brocolli to the chicken/cream cheese mixture next time though.

I thought this was just ok.  I skipped the butter to cut some of the fat and added a little black pepper, but it seemed very bland and doughy.  I won't be making them again.

My husband and I liked these, the kids were reluctant to try them for some reason.  A bit time consuming to put together and it makes a lot!  I felt like I was jumping up every few minutes to get another pan out of the oven.  Great warmed up the next day as leftovers.

I have made these twice and everyone who has tried them loved them!  They are so easy to make and taste great.  I used the garlic butter cresent rolls and they were really good.  The first time I made them I used a whole chicken breast and the second time I used two cans of white meat chicken.  Both were delicious!  Next time I'm going to try adding some veggies.

These were VERY GOOD!!! This was the first time I had made these, but the base recipe seemed to need an extra kick. I followed the recipe but I added the following.
1 tsp Dill Weed
1 tsp Parsley
1 tsp of lemon juice
I kinda eyeballed those but the measurements are approximate.
I also found that baking these in a gas oven @ high altitude took a bit longer.
I baked them at 375 deg for about 15 min.
Very tasty. I will add this one to my cookbook!!!!!!

I made this recipe for my family recently and I got my son to eat chicken...he didn't even know it was in there!! My husband and older son both loved them.  There were 4 of us, and we had plenty left over.  Great recipe for a cool fall night!

This was a good recipe, but I had to use the whole crescent roll instead of cutting it in half, putting about 2 T. in each netting 12. There were only 8 rolls in ea. can I bought, so I don't know if there is a brand with larger ones that you can cut in half, also I cooked the chicken one night, mixed the ingredients then next day then rolled them up, I think it would be hard to work with this if the chicken was still warm when you went to wrap them. All in all, GREAT recipe, will make it again!

I made these for my family to eat today as a munchie for watching football.  They were gone before they were cooled down! My husband said they were rich, which I think is a good thing.  I will definately be making these again and will probabaly need to double or triple the recipe next time.

Very Unique and delicious.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the recipe is off.  I followed it too the T and the timing is definitly off.  If cooking at 325, it will take longer than 10 minutes.  Make sure the WHOLE puff is golden brown before removing them from the oven.  Also, I doubled the garlic and the taste was delicious!

These were so good!  I made them for a gathering at my home and everybody went back for seconds and kept saying how good they were.  I did not add the butter, I just didn't think it was necessary.  The serving size said 12, but it made more than that- although it didn't use up all 3 crescent roll cans.

This was edible but nothing more.  It was pretty easy to make but the flavor was just lacking and I even added 5 cloves of minced garlic.  Sorry but I will not be making this again.

I made these because I dropped a container of crescent rolls and it popped open so I needed to use it quickly and didn't want to make the more involved thing that I had planned to use the crescent rolls for. My family loved them. My picky daughter kept asking if she could have more. I think she would have eaten all of them if I hadn't told her to save some for her sister and father.

These were so simple, the ingredients were on hand and they're yummy! I followed the recipe exact except for cutting it down for use with only one tube of crescent rolls. I think I will add some chopped broccoli next time per my husbands suggestion and brush them with an egg wash just to make them more attractive.

Thanks for sharing the recipe. It's a hit in my house!

I made these with left over turkey.  I used the onion chive cream cheese spread(about 2/3 of the container).  I added a couple tablespoons of milk.  I placed the mixture on half of the crescent roll and folded over-pinching the edges with a fork.  they baked beautifully.  Great flavor.  A new favorite.  So quick and easy.

Great recipe! I have one similar myself that has a few differences that would work well here too - I add a can of crushed pineapple, use green onions/scallions instead of regular onion, and omit the butter.  In the recipe I use it called for biscuit dough and you balled up the biscuits and put them in mini muffin tins, hollowed out the middle, and put a spoonful of the mixture inside to bake.  I like the crescent rolls MUCH better, and like the fact that they are sealed.  It was much less time consuming than rolling all the little balls!  Thanks!!!

I may have been doing this all wrong.The mixture was soupy and the crecent rolls didn't seal properly.

This was so good my husband asked for it two nights in a row! I left out the butter and added fresh basil and green pepper from the garden. We are having a small retirement party and I'll be making these for our guests! Thank you so much!

I like it!  I did change it just a little.  I decreased the amount of butter by 1/2 and added some low-fat shredded co-jack cheese.  They were kinda hard to put together, since I had used jumbo rolls and they were SO big.  They would be better as stated, in small rolls.  Thank you for the great recipe!
peace!
