FANTASTIC! The combo of apples, honey and fish sounds gross but this is a great recipe! My husband says it's the best fish he's ever eaten, and he's a staunch "keep it simple" New Englander. The dish is like having dinner and dessert on one plate. I used real butter VS. margarine so added some olive oil to raise the frying temp for the fish without burning the butter. The crust came out a bit blackened for me but it was not "burnt" but "caramelized". Hubby gave this five stars, so do I!

Tried this tonight, jan 19-03, on my executive VP girlfriend and she loved it, put it with creamy mashed potatoes and balsamic/walnut brussel sprouts, which gave a sweet/sour accent to this sweet/fish dish. I would reccommend a viognier to go with this, like napa Arrow-wood or sonoma's Christopher creek viognier.

Like the others, I was a little skeptical of the combinations in this dish.  It came out wonderful! I used striped bass, and I think you can experiment with many different white fish types and have good results with this dish.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic.  I didn't have enough apples on hand, so used half peeled apples and half peeled nectarines and it was wonderful. Also, being a bit health conscious, I sprinkled a little wheat germ in with the bread crumb.   Tried this recipe on my husband, who loved it, and now can't wait to serve it to company.

Ugh! This didn't work at all. Cooking times were waaaay off. Also, butter burns much too quickly for the fillets to cook through. This recipe should stipulate that fillets must be very thin for them to cook through before the butter starts to burn. Fillets must be approximately 1/2 inch. Otherwise, what you can do it simply pan-sear the fillets and when they are fried, put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe (I used catfish), but my kids didn't like it at all.  I would make it again but would tweak the recipe slightly.  First, I would saute onions with the apples for the topping.  Second, I would substitute something else for the bread crumbs -- maybe crushed buttery crackers -- because I didn't care for the bread crumb flavor.  (If using bread crumbs; two cups is excessive; 1 cup would be adequate).  Oh, and make sure somebody else has clean up duty because this recipe uses a lot of dishes!

I was nervous about making this dish, and rightfully so.  Like some other reviewers, I thought 2 cups of breadcrumbs was way too much.  I also managed to burn the outside and have the inside raw.  I have to take credit for this part of the screw-up ;D  In the end, the apples were good but the Sea Bass (very expensive) was absolutely tasteless.  I would do this recipe again, but with pork chops instad of Sea Bass.  Sorry, I don't normally give bad reviews but I really, really didn't like this.

I was skeptical of this recipie, but had a beautiful piece of Sea Bass to use. Didn't want to go out shopping and had apples and honey - who doesn't? It was wonderful and very easy. Only addittions were a smidge of red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs for an bit of zip and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to the apples while frying. As another user suggested, I would add ground nuts - almonds, pistachios, walnuts - whatever to crumb crust if I have them on hand. To the user who complained about dishes - use wax paper for flour/crumb step. While my boyfriend raves about everything I prepare, he is still talking about this one. Will definately make again - soon. Thanks

Absolutely incredible!!! However, I think it could almost be called Bass Schnitzel! Never the less, we served the dish with rice (cooked in half chicken broth and half water) and sprinkled lemon on the rice. We also sliced the Bass into 2-3 inch slices, used 2 eggs, and combined all of the dry ingredients except for the cayenne pepper. We put the cayenne pepper on the fish while it was frying. Lastly, instead of using bread crumbs, we crushed high-end stuffing that added a lot more taste and texture. This was an EXCELLENT dish and I can't wait to thank my dad for catching the bass for me! :)

Great!
Do not waste the bread crumbs, it calls for way too much.  I poured 2 cups of bread crumbs in the dish and breaded 6 fillets.  I less than 1/2 of the bread crumbs.

Wonderful flavor!!  My husband is sometimes hard to please when it comes to fish.  In fact when I was making this dish he looked very nervous, but he loved it.  In fact he keeps asking me when is the next time we are having that apple and fish thing!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very good! I used catfish and ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs, and did marinate the fish in milk and hotsauce for a couple hours in the fridge before prepping. All I would change next time is to add a lot more hot sauce/cayenne in the recipe somewhere, as the spice goes really well with the sweet. I served it with acorn squash and new potatoes.

I made this tonight for dinner for my husband and I.  It was very good.  I was surprised that the combination of honey, apples and sea bass tasted so good.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I will make it again.

I've decided I don't like to pan-fry fish.  Not a good recipe for someone with Toddlers.  Too time consuming.  The flavor isn't bad, but just too much work.

Made this last night, and was thrilled with the outcome.  Added a small handful of pecans to the apples and used real butter but followed the recipe otherwise.  This is a keeper!!

This was sweet & wonderful.  I also sprinkled pecans over the apples.  I used cod since I had no sea bass.  Now I have to go out & get sea bass to try it again!

This was a great meal!!  We love the fish even on their own and the apples add just the right extra flavor and moisture.  I too was worried about the combination. But it was fantastic!  Only change is I might cut back on the butter.

The Honeyed apples were a treat, but cooking the fish requires a little more direction.  I would use Olive oil with less butter to fry the fish so that the butter does not burn.  I used Panko bread crumbs and that worked well. Make sure to peel the skin off the sea bass fillet.

I was running late and didn't have time to bread it (plus no bread or breadcrumbs on hand) so I fried it with salt and pepper. Next time I'll be use to bread it I think it would be better. Use fresh local honey and the sauce was great. Not too fond of the bass I had so I think next time will be with cod instead.

I love fish. I enjoy cooking what I catch. Usually it is either deep fried, fried on the stove or sometimes grill in foil on the  gas grill. Whatever the case, I generally have plenty of tarter sauce on hand to accompany the dish.
This recipe however DOES NOT need anything else. Aside from my undercooking the Stripped Bass fillet due to the thickness, it turned out to be a real hit with everyone at the table. Great job!

The apples in this recipe were great on their own. The sea bass didn't come out very well. I think my piece was too thick, it didn't pan fry in the time allotted and ended up burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. I might try it again with a thinner piece of fish.

Quick and easy to do.  I used panko instead of breadcrumbs and it gave it a little more crisp.  Love it.

This was great!   My wife loved it, and she's usually not all for mixing fruit and meat.  Served it with rice and squash.  I used Catfish to great satisfaction.  I agree with the previous posts that 2cups breadcrumbs is way too much - you can also do with less butter.

I really liked this recipe. My husband was so-so. My six year old? Forget it. Anything new and he won't have it. He liked the fish though. Here are the changes I made. I don't care for bread crumbs. I used Ritz crackers. I also added some onion to my apple mixture. I think it would have been better if I hadn't added so much. (An entire Vidalia.) I wouldn't omit it all together though. I deep fried my fish. Mmmm, good! To the lady that said clean-up was a hassle. Use ziploc bags for the flour, egg and cracker dips. Then just throw them away. Good recipe.

Anything voted keeper by my husbands standards gets a 5 with me.  The only changes I made were the type of fish.  The market had no sea bass and the halibut didn't look good so I ended up with sole.  I also added chopped pecans to the apple topping.  Quite tasty!

I used real butter in place of margarine, careful not to allow the apples to set too long or they will be over saturated with butter.  I also coarsely chopped some walnuts, about ½ cup and added them to the honey sauce.  To the fish I added a generous amount of vanilla to the beaten egg, about 1 TBS per large egg.  I will make this recipe regularly!  Thanks for sharing Lola!!  Love it!

Very interesting combination of foods, but tasted great.  I used halibut instead of sea bass, and butter instead of margerine - it browned perfectly.  The sweetness of the apples made me not need to have dessert afterwards!

This was amazing. I only had 1 apple, so after reading some reviews decided to do a nectarine also. It turned out wonderful. My husband loved the nectarine. Definitely going in my recipe box.

Looooove it!  I've made this recipe several times.  I find that the fish is a lot more filling.  When sea bass is not available, I substitute halibut or orange roughy and it works perfectly.  The only change that I make it to half the amount of apples and honey.  Otherwise, I use the leftovers the following day over plain yoghurt.

this was just such a different taste that it makes it hard to rate. i used tilapia and crushed ritz instead of sea bass and bread crumbs, and cut down on the toppping (i had 2 small fillets and used half a large apple, and it was plenty). i used the tilapia mainly because it really absorbs flavor, but next time i will go looking for sea bass. i made this for myself (i cut the recipe way down) for rosh hashuna, when it is traditional to eat dishes with apple; my family made a chicken dish, but i don't eat meat. i think this may become my rosh hashuna dish of choice, but perhaps only for the holiday.

Let me begin by saying that I did alter the recipe a little, so my rating may not apply.  I did not have sea bass, instead I had Mahi Mahi.  Also, I used real butter instead of margerine.  Regardless, it was not what I hoped for.  The 2 cups of bread crumbs were entirely way too much.  I would say that even 1 cup will do.  The apples were good, but again way too much for four filets. (maybe my apples were bigger than the recipe called for.  I might use the apple part with say some pork chops, but I will never make this again.

Fish turned out great - I used corn flakes instead of flour.
I found the apples too overpowering for the fish, I would cut way down on the amount of apples for this dish. I'm giving a four because it could have been the fish I used - Turbot. Next time I will try a stronger fish, like catfish as suggested.

EXCELLENT!!!!!!  I used frozen bass from Costco and canned fiji apples so I didn't have to cut and peel the apples, and I used a tasty fish seasoning mixture instead of just regular flour, salt, and pepper.  This was excellent!!!! Yum Yum.

Great recipe.  We used fresh sea bass and it turned out very tasty.  The crispy breading was delicious and the apples were just another wonderful addition to the fish.  I will cook just the apples in the future to top ice cream, pork chops or other white fish.

We really enjoyed this dish, it was different but in a good way. I would maybe in the future leave the apple peels on to add more texture and color as the apples did sort of look bland.

This was sooo good and pretty easy to prepare.  My fish was pretty thick so it took more like 10 minutes on each side but it came out great.  I made my own bread crumbs which made it delicious and very easy to do (just blend a couple of pieces of bread and add some italian seasoning or whatever spices you like).

turned out great (i save 5stars for really special recipes). i used butter and a little olive oil instead of margarine, watched the fish, and had no burning.

I used thin filets which turned out well. Apples turned out well and tasted great too, but ate the apples more as a side then directly with the fish. Just wasn't sold on eating the apples and the fish in the same bite.

this was probably my third time making this in 5 years.  it's an awesome recipe, instead of margarine I used butter.  Chilean sea bass is expensive and hard to find so this is always a special treat for hubby and I.

We loved this recipe. A very nice change from my normal baked, seasoned fish. I followed recipe exactly. Perfect!

This was a delicious surprise.  My husband likes the fishy taste masked.  Well the honey and apples were wonderful on top of the beautifully crusted fish.  This is a dish I'll make again without any changes.  As for too many dishes to prepare, well I use the styrofoam  and toss after.  Ps to the burned butter comment....ALWAYS add olive oil to decrease burning the butter.
