I love this recipe! I had a couple cans of beans in the pantry one day and needed to use them up, so I searched for a recipe and found this one. I had everything on hand minus the bay leaf, but the soup was amazing without it. I do like to add a small diced potato to it as well, but it's definitely not necessary. Great recipe!

Gotta tell you, this certainly was quick and easy and pretty darn tasty too.   I had a box of chicken stock in the fridge, so I used that instead of bouillon granules and water which I think ramped up the flavor (and reduced sodium content, as well).   Found no need to add any salt, plenty salty for us.  I still love my homemade bean soup, but this will be my "go-to" recipe if I want a quick bean soup on the table in a half an hour.  Thanks HARRYMARTINII for sharing your recipe.

I varied the recipe a bit as others have done.  I started with chicken broth - about 6 cups (making for more people).  I put a ham bone in and brought to a boil.  I simmered for a few minutes and then added the spices and vegetables.  No salt needed.  I also added the beans and a can of diced tomatoes.  I put in some basil too as I liked that suggestion by someone else here.  I let it all cook for 30 minutes.  Then I added the cooked ham I had previously taken off that ham bone and anything else that came loose on the ham bone.  I let it go for another 20 minutes and then took out the bone and served.  It was great!

I made it this evening and haven't had any yet but my husband said it's delicious.  I didn't have 2 cans of red beans so used just one and added some potatoes to compensate as another reviewer had mentioned.  Besides that, I thickened the base with cornstarch.  I will definitely make this again.

I used chicken broth instead of granules and water.  I also used dried celery leaves instead of celery which made it easier and still added that taste, which is very good in this soup.  This is fast, delicious and easy.  This is the one I will save and use regularly.

This  recipe makes a pretty tasty soup for not having a ham bone or soaking beans overnight.   I used two bay leafs and I added Thyme (because we like that additional flavor).    I increased the garlic and black pepper and left out the salt (this is just adjusting it to our taste buds).   At the end, I thicken the soup with a little broth and corn starch.     I will definitely make it again.

This was great and so quick. No more ham bones for me. I doubled it, used chicken stock, ham that came cubed in a package, added a bit of dry mustard, thyme and onion powder ... and it was delicious!   Definitely making again.

I made this with left over ham from Christmas. I cooked the ham bone and soaked white beans the night before.  I added the ingredients in the recipes but also added ham bouillon cubes and 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I did not add salt. I wanted a thicker sauce so to thicken the sauce I used a handheld soup blender.and place it down into the soup in the crock pot and blended some of the beans and ham. This made a smoother thickened soup.

I had some left over ham and some chicken stock which were perfect for this soup. Very easy and quick. I added fresh basil and some thyme as suggested by other reviewers. Very good soup. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this. We added more veggies and more chicken bouillon and water so it would be more of a soup than a stew, and it’s one of our new favorites. Highly recommend!

Nice and simple as written. Since it was just Thanksgiving and I had lots of homemade Turkey stock, I used that instead of the water for a bit more richness. I did add a pinch of Thyme as well .I always forget to remove the bay leaf and it always ends up in my wife's bowl.  Kind of a tradition now so I leave it in on purpose now. LOL

In the past I made ham and bean soup in the crock pot, which took forever but was very good. This soup was just as good (i.e. Very Good) and easy to make.  I did triple the recipe because I knew it would go fast! It did!

I used chicken broth and added potatoes also cooked soup with the bone for a while. After boiling just the bone I removed the bone and boiled the potatoes ,onions,celery and carrots then mixed ham, beans and broth  
With other vegetables and water together simmered for 30 minutes and it was delicious.

Made exactly as written for a very satisfying and FAST to put together soup. Very good! Made it a second time with beef broth instead of chicken bullion and water (all I had) and I actually liked it even better! Five stars for the recipe written as is and five for my modification. Either way, everyone was happy. Served it with the Sour Cream Cornbread recipe by Emily Hughes on this site. Yummy.

This was a pretty good recipe!  I followed the recipe with only a few changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water and left out celery and salt.  I also used cubed ham.  An all around good recipe when you don't have all day to cook.

I love this soup!   For the two of us I use only 1 can of beans and drain the juice from that can to add part of the broth.  Marilyn

It was okay.  My daughter loved it, I didn't care for it.  I even followed some of the changes people made.  Guess I like the long cooking method, but it made my daughter happy.

loved it and super easy to make. I did a few things different though by using a carton of chicken broth a teaspoon of basil and about a tablespoon of bacon grease.  I will definitely be making this again.
