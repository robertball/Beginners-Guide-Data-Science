This is my great grandmother's receipe.  I thought I would add a note.  This is a dense cake and I never bake it in round pans I think it is do heavy to make a good layer cake.  I always make a sheet cake out of it.  I also usually serve with warm berries and whip cream.  I mostly use blackberries and blueberries.  I heat them in a sauce pan on low until they start to "melt down" then I add some honey and bring it to a boil.  I then thicken it into a sauce with cornstarch.  Thought I would add that note!  Hope it helps those looking at this recipe.

My 11 year old daughter (a great cook!) made this for her father's birthday cake.
She DOUBLED the recipe to get enough batter for 2 round pans and the layers were just the right height. I can see where using the recipe as is would produce very thin layers.  She also upped the vanilla a bit, and used lactose-free milk and Smart Balance instead of butter for her lactose intolerant sister.  The cake was moist and flavorful, more yellow than white, and great with chocolate frosting and surrounded by strawberries.

I am a 3 time award winning sous chef. A note of advice to others who have rated this recipe, look at the history behind it. I made this cake today for my husbands birthday...and I think it turned out great! I used a melted coating of chocolate and peanut butter and served with fresh strawberries couldn't have asked for better! The cake did not stick, as I floured the bottom of the cake pan. Bottom line is I think it is wonderful, the history behind it is beautiful...and if you want Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines, go to the store. If you want to indulge in a little history...use this a a keeper! :)

I was quite dissapointed with this cake.  

I set out this morning to make a poke cake for my son's 2nd birthday.  I read the previous reviews and made the changes suggested, including really greasing the pan so the cake would come out well (still stuck), and I added a 3rd tsp of baking powder to avoid the flat cake problem the others had (still quite flat and heavy).  The cake was also VERY brown around the edges (my oven temperature is correct).

I will say that the cake had a good flavor, but i will not be making this one again.  

Off to buy a cake at the bakery.

This is a dense cake. It's supposed to be. If you want a lighter cake, use cake flour. The ratio is 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of cake flour to every 1 cup of AP flour. I've made this cake both ways and have even mixed the flours. I liked mixed the best. I also add 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla extract because I like it that way. This is a very good recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Alright. I was in a hurry to get a recipe that I had the ingredients for, and due to the rating of this cake, I didn't read the reviews. I suppose I should have. Mine turned out, like others, flat and crisp around the edges. Although this could be a decent cake with tweaking, it needs so much tweaking that I'm not going to bother. It's less work to find another recipe. It was still edible,  with a liberal application of icing and blanched slivered almonds, but it was still pretty tough. I don't think I'll make this again.

Simple and delicious!  I've made it twice and both times I added a little extra almond flavor.  The second time I baked the cake I added a fresh strawberry  sauce (recipe follows)to the cake fresh out of the oven.  I arranged fresh strawberries on the top of the cake and received many compliments, not only on the look but especially on the taste!

INGREDIENTS: 
1/2 cup sugar 
1/4 cup water 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
3 tablespoons butter or margarine 
1 pint basket of strawberries, halved

DIRECTIONS: 
In medium skillet mix sugar, water and lemon juice. Stir over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and mixture comes just to boil. Add butter; stir until melted. Mix in strawberries; heat through, but do not cook.

What a waste of frosting!  This cake did not rise much, so I cut the layers in half and made a four-layer half cake.  Looked great, tasted awful.  Very heavy, with an eggy taste.  I'll stick to Duncan Hines from now on.

This is a very good and reliable basic white cake, made even better, at least for me, with a couple of small tweaks - 1/2 cup butter rather than 1/3, and 1/2 cup milk rather than the full cup called for.  Also, since some reviewers reported this didn't rise as much as they would have liked I felt that, excluding the obvious cause of expired baking powder, perhaps there was too MUCH baking powder, which then could have resulted in the opposite of the desired effect - so I reduced the amount to 1-1/2 tsp. rather than 2 tsp.  A pinch of salt for me was 1/4 tsp. I baked these as cupcakes and was very pleased.  (To finish them I removed a plug from each cupcake, filled them with strawberry jam, then frosted them with Strawberry Buttercream - sinful)

I wish I had read the reviews before I used this recipe! I made cupcakes for a fundraiser and they were flat,tough, and not really sweet. The most people could say was the icing is good. Now I have to try and save my baking reputation!!

I've made this cake several time now and it has always come out perfect. i do only make it in a 9x13 pan and do really grease the pan. Instead of grease and flour I use grease and suggar to coat the pan. Delicious moist and dense cake that ready for berries or frosting. Most of the time it is gone before I ever to add anything. Great recipe!!!

Was looking for a white cake to make from scratch. I was hesitant to make this because of the reviews. I am so glad I made it. I had no problems, and the cake turned out YUMMY! It was gone within 2 days. Got one in the oven cooking now.

Super easy, super delicious!  I must admit, I was a little concerned by so many who'd said this didn't rise properly, but I didn't have that problem at all.  I made this cake yesteray for my husband for Valentine's Day.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used my heart-shaped layer cake pans (that are supposed to be the same volume as 8" round).  I did do one thing which could have aided better rising - I used my Kitchen Aid mixer, and whipped it for several seconds both after adding the eggs, and then again after all ingredients were added.  It rose perfectly, made a deliciously moist white cake.  (I wonder if those for whom it didn't rise were using either expired baking powder or a margarine product instead of butter?)  I wanted a very old-fashioned result, so I used a simple cooked brown sugar icing, and sprinkled some candy hearts around the perimiter of the plate to add "Valentiney-ness" - the result was exactly what I wanted, and my husband (and I) loved it!  Thanks to Nany for passing down her fabulous recipe to MeaganColleen :)

This is a fabulous cake!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully delicious.  This is not a light and fluffy cake.  It is dense and moist.  I baked it in a loaf pan to serve with berries and cream...YUM!  We served it at a pre-Independence day lunch...it did not last long.  I am in the process of baking another for my family.

I added some blackberries and raspberries to the inside of the cake. I made a third layer and floded some almonds into it. With a bit of cream cheese frosting, it made a really light, very yummy desert!

Read the reviews and made in anyway and boy am I glad!  
I was really finicky though-I used scoops for measuring the dry ingredients, completely levelled them, and only measured the milk using a measuring cup.  I also used whole milk as a recipe from a great granny is likely not of the skim or 2% era! I also greased and floured my pan as usual. The cake turned out a gorgeous light golden colour on the outside, didn't stick, and was delicious with chocolate frosting.  Can't wait to try it with seasonal berries and cream!
Kudos to granny :-)

Tatse is good, but this batter does not rise in the slightest! Completely flat! I had to make another batch just to make it the height of a "normal" cake. Will not make again.

We made this cake twice! It was delicious and we didn't have to change any of the ingredients. Would definitely recommend as a layer cake or in smaller pie tins. Makes a great sugar-crust on top : )

I was looking for a dense yellow or white cake to serve with strawberries and whipped cream, and this is very close. It went over well as our Easter dessert, this recipe is a keeper as it is so quick and easy.

I did not like this. The cake was very tough and had a bland bread taste. Tried to make a birthday cake with this.
We skipped the birthday cake, thank goodness I also had a fruit salad to serve.

Excellent cake! I only made changes for our high altitude and pan size (I used a 9x13). Cake is very flavorful and moist. After we ate some plain, then we made a Poke Cake out of the rest with all natural strawberry jello. Great both ways. Thank you for this great recipe!

I tried this and split down for 8" cakes and they cam out real thin. You need to make a double batch and then maybe it would make a thicker cake.

Great cake for creating design cakes. It holds together well but I would not split into 2 pans. I did one recipe as is in a bowl and one as is in a 9 in square to make a Mario Bros. 1 up cake for my 5 yr old's Super Mario Birthday. It is a dense cake but that is what I needed. Would also be great with a cream sauce and berries. Really great recipe thanks!

This was very good, but I would consider this more of a cake to layer with whipped cream and fruit. It isn't quite what I would call a "birthday cake" It is very heavy, but still tastes great! Instead of using milk I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup water and mixed together. This is a great alternative to milk if you don't have any when you are making a cake. You can also use 1/4 cup mayonnase and 3/4 cup water and mix together.

I just thought this recipe was ok.  I looked for over an  hour for the best rated white cake and this one seemed to be it.  It was just small family cake for my sons birthday so I wanted it to be extra special and I thought it was just fair.  It was easy so if I ever needed a cake to put fruit and cream on I would make it agin, but not as a cake with frosting.

The cake turned out very dense (like a dense pound cake), not fluffy. It also was not very sweet. I split the batter into 2 pans (like the recipe stated) and ended up with two very shallow cakes (about 1 1/2"). I was hoping to use it for a birthday cake. Oh well, at least we had cookies. I will not try this recipe again.

I only had small eggs so I used three eggs instead of two and the batter was a bit runny so I used two cups of flour instead of one and a half.  I added multi-colored sprinkles in the batter and it came out perfect!!!  I will definetly be making it again!

Just found this recipe last night and had to make it today.  I love these old fashioned cakes like I made when I was very young.  They still taste the best to me.  I let my KA cream the butter and sugar for 3 or 4 minutes, then beat well after each egg was added. The texture of this cake is so light, certainly not dense or heavy. I frosted this cake with fudgy frosting and it is delicious.  Thanks, Megan, for a great recipe that will be made often.

My kids and I made this cake last night. It looked like something easy for them to help me with, and it was. We followed the recipe exactly, then added milk chocolate chips. The chips, of course, all sank to the bottom (I thought they would). The cake was delicious! We didn't frost it, but I did serve it with vanilla ice cream. My mother used to make a "one-egg cake," and this was similar, but with a stronger vanilla flavor. The cake was on the dense side, but was very moist. I plan to use this recipe again, and I also want to try making it into a marble cake. I've stopped buying boxed cake mixes, so this recipe is definitely going into my binder!

I was looking for a simple white cake recipe and found this one. I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/2 cup butter and adding a tsp of almond extract along with the vanilla. The cake turned out fluffy and tasty. This recipe was easy to follow.

Love this cake... No idea what people were talking about it not rising enough- mine was perfect the couple of times I've made it.  In fact, I add an extra egg when stacking (with fruit filling in between) to keep it from falling apart.

It tasted good cake yet heavy and dense. I can see why she uses it with fruit, but not good for a birthday cake which I used it for.

I was making this for a small party and I was mildly disappointed.  I first made one batch of it and it didn't rise enough and it stuck to the pan a little bit. HOWEVER, it tastes very good. It has a good flavor and texture.  I wound up making a second batch of it because if I didn't it would only be 1 inch tall.  For the second batch, I put a bit more grease in the pan and I used 2.5 teaspoons of baking powder instead of just 2 and it rose more and worked a ton better.

i made this cake a few days ago. i read about people having problems rising and it being dense and several other complaints. first off, i had to make a double batch, because a single batch only filled one and one eighth of an eight inch cake pan. i had no problems with the cake rising whatsoever. i overfilled my pans a little and it came over the top by about a quarter inch. the cake tasted great, but it was so dense that it destroyed how dense you would think a white cake should be. if you dont mind a dense cake, then go ahead,

This cake was perfect for what I needed!  I used this recipe to make a cake that was like a Samoa Cookie (in a bunt pan), so the density was just right.  Very simple recipe, too.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday. It was wonderful. I doubled the recipe to make 2 8" rounds. I cut each cake into 2 layers and put in a raspberry jam layer. In between the bottom cake and top cake I added a layer of mascerated fresh strawberries sliced thin. I frosted with homemade buttercreme frosting.

The cake was moist and dense. I had no trouble with the rise or the texture of the cake. I will definitely be making this cake over and over.

I have used this recipie a lot. I love this cake and so does everybody else. I do add dry cooked vanilla pudding to mine and I also sift 1/2 of the flour and spoon the other 1/2 of the flour into the batter. I do also add a little more baking powder also. This does not get tough or dry and it is not so dense either.

I added a small package of French vanilla pudding, as one of the other reviewers did. I didn't add any extra liquid. My cake was yellow and was very similar to a yellow box cake. I used two pans, I'm not sure which size, and the layers were plenty large enough. I did add the baking powder after I had added all of the other ingredients. That may be why my layers were a decent size; my cake was also fluffier than a box cake. I was hoping this cake would be denser and not so sweet. But, I do think this is a good cake for what it is.

I actually like the thickness of the cake in this recipe. I added a little extra butter which made for a moister cake. Because it is a heavier cake I didn't choose to use the traditional butter creme frosting, instead I just made my own creme cheese frosting which was a yummy addition to the cake. I did use a round cake pan for this recipe and thinned the batter out a little bit and the cake turned out great.

This Recipe Is Great. This Is My First Time Doing It From Scratch. I Did What Your Recipe Side But Added A Package Of Dry Strawberry Pudding Mix. O Man It Even Smalls Like A Strawberry Cake You Get From Betty Crocker And Other Comps. The Reason For Me To Try This Out Is Because They Don't Sale Are Make Strawberry Cake Mixes Here In Germany. Like They Do Back Home In The States Like Tx. Thats Where Im From. I Miss That Cake A Lot. And Now I Can Make That And Enjoy To.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I added a pkg of instant french vanilla pudding to this mix. This helped with the moisture, and added a rich vanilla flavor to it. And then I topped it off with cream cheese frosting.  Very delicious!

This made a great cake. I use this when I need a shortcake base like for strawberry shortcake. It only made two THIN layers though, and they weren't really thick enough to split in two easily so I left them as is. This is a heavier denser cake and more suited for fruit and cream or another topping but not so much frosting as this is a heavy dense cake. Thanks for sharing this turned out wonderful!

This cake is great! The only thing I canged was that I put it in a 8in square baking dish and baked it for about 10 more miniutes (about 40 min.) It is so so good, moist, delicious. My husband LOVES it. Also, I frosted it with the creamy white icing found on this website, perfect match. LOVE IT, thanks!

We got through half of the preparation of this cake when we discovered we didn't have any milk. Upon reading the other reviews which all said that the final product emerged very dense, I decided to go for the gusto. The two of us closed our eyes and poured a can of sweetened condensed milk in instead. The final product was like a brownie blondie rather than cake, but it was still very good.

WOW!!!  This is a great recipe.  I only had 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, so I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Since I keep my butter in the freezer, I used 1/2 cup of unsalted butter instead of a 1/3 cup.  Also, I used butter and sugar instead of butter/flour in the pan.  I baked it in a 10 inch round pan.

This is the second time I've tried this cake and both times I've been very satisfied with it.  I find it is reminscent of childhood cakes that I've eaten.  Wonderful!  The first time I used one cup of sugar (bit too sweet for me), the second time I used half cup sugar (not quite sweet enough).  Next time I will try three quarter cup and I'm sure it will be perfect.  This cake didn't stick to the pan, at all.  I greased and floured the glass pan and it came out like a dream.  Yes, it doesn't rise as much as cake mixes, but height is not what it's about for me.  Thanks for submitting Nany's White Cake.  It's a keeper!

This is a fantastic cake!!!  When I made it, I added lime juice to the mixture and then, after baking and cooling, I devised me own recipe for a glaze made with lime, coconut, and walnuts that was absolutly delicious!  Thanks for the great white cake recipe!

So glad I didn't read the reviews or I might have skipped this wonderful cake!  Made 6 perfect mini- roses (Nordic) - they fell right out of the pans, and the cake is light and perfectly sweet!  Thanks to Nany!

I loved this recipe, it was very simple and I didn't need to go out and buy any special ingredients which is what I liked about it the most. I made the cake in a 9x13 pan, it turned out very moist. I did alter it a little by adding a couple of TBSPs of peanut butter. I used a peanut butter frosting on the cake when it was still warm and let the frosting harden.

I just made this today for Father's day!!  Although I cut the sugar to 3/4 C. it was still too sweet for my dad who prefers really light cakes.  i found it okay tho.  i also cut the milk in half and used soy since my mom is lactose intolerant.  still came out great!  as if i bought a premixed box!!  i unfortunately didn't oil the pan enough and the cake came out in pieces.  but nevertheless, tasted great frosted with whipped cream and topped with strawberries!  thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made this cake today on a whim as I had all ingredients on hand.  It is wonderful.
I followed the recipe to the "T". I had left over vanilla bean cream filling and whipped cream from my cream puffs, so I filled with the cream filling, and topped it with the whipped cream. Delicious. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe to a T. It was AWFUL! Truly the worst cake I have ever made. Dense in a bad way, flat, and tasted like dough. What a waste of a time, money, and food. This was for my husband’s birthday. I threw it in the trash after one slice.

Well I was so happy with the results! Read lots of reviews and made several of the suggestions. 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup milk, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 1/2 tsp.vanilla. So fluffy and moist! I made cup cakes instead of sheet cake. I really beat the butter and sugar a long time. I think that's the key. Not dense or heavy at all. The first from scratch cake I've ever made, and I've been baking for 45 years!!! Lol!!!!!

This is actually a great recipe. The mistake made here is mix until light and fluffy. That is why the cake is dense. The key is to not over mix your cake batter. Just either stir by hand kind of folding or put your mixer on a low setting. I hope this helps.

Delicious!  I actually made into cupcakes,  it made about 18.  I made no changes to the recipe but they turned out much less dense than I was expecting from other reviews.  The texture and flavor were great, will definitely make again.

I made for my grandsons birthday. I made it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out about 1/4 inch thick. I had to make another one to put on top like a layer cake with a strawberry filling. I will not make it again.

I am very torn on whether I love or just kind of like this cake. The texture is good (if you're getting a dense/dry cake you're probably over-mixing after adding the flour), but what is the deal with the crust that this cake gets? Also, this is a not-quite-white cake, which I expected when I saw butter and whole eggs as ingredients instead of shortening and egg whites. At the end of the day, it's fine for a random dessert, but I wouldn't make this for a special occasion.

I was torn between giving a 2 or 3 but decided on the 3 because the taste wasn't bad plus I don't want to disrespect Nany.  The consistency is all wrong, as others said it didn't rise and it has the feel of a very dense and sweet pancake.  I followed the recipe to a tee so not sure what went wrong.  At least the taste isn't so bad.

I loved this cake recipe! I used it in cake pops and it was amazing. Melt in your mouth good! It was fluffy and moist (but not too moist) and very flavorful for a white cake. I will absolutely make this again. It was even better than the pillsbury white cake mixes!

I was looking for a simple white cake recipe to go with cream cheese coconut frosting and came upon this. So simple, and so delicious. Just what we were looking for. We like substance, and this cake has that. I made no changes to the recipe.  I should have taken a picture immediately upon frosting, but that moment passed and the cake disappeared.  I'll definitely be making this again.

this cake came out very flat, even as a double layer it really isn't and bigger than a single layer cake. i haven't ate it as it is my daughters smash cake but it does feel very dense.

i've done this recipe a few times and it's still my go-to for cupcakes--but that's all i use it for.  i've tried using it for a layer cake, and as others have said, it doesn't rise much, and you end up with flat, kinda chewy layers.  for cupcakes, though, since the volume's lessened, they rise just fine.  

HOWEVER, if you want to try making a layer cake with this one, here's what i'd do.  add a teaspoon of baking soda and up the baking powder to a tablespoon.  you could also cut the milk back to 3/4 cup and add an extra egg, which will also help it rise.  

if the flavour's not to your liking, and you don't mind altering the colour a little, use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and double the amount of vanilla.  should boost the flavour a little without making it overly sweet.  but i almost always end up using brown sugar instead of white in any recipe i can, as i find it adds both flavour and sweetness instead of just that straightforward sugary taste.

best wishes with your baking!

This is not a "thick" cake.  I had no problems with it rising.  Followed the directions and ingredients exactly, except I made it in a 9x13 pan.  I am eating it plain, because I wasn't sure if I would like it and didn't want to waste my time making icing.  Very happy with this cake and would make it again.  I might try adding a little more vanilla next time.

I made this cake last week for the first time. Everyone in my house just loved it. I made it again yesterday and it was gone by this morning. If you like a cake that is dense and moist this is the cake you need to make.

I needed a white cake that would be able to hold a serious chocolate frosting so I looked around and spotted this one. Read some of the reviews and gave it a go.
It tastes phenominal, the cake is moist yet it is robust enough to hold gobs of super heavy frosting, so its great for birthdays and special occasion decorating.
Thank you for sharing! A++

Delicious cake. Definitely more dense than your store bought cake, but one of my friends said it was the best cake he had ever eaten. The rest of them were moaning over the deliciousness of this cake. (It was my friend's bday cake.)

I don't understand why people rated this cake so high. I wanted a 2 layer white cake for my birthday and needed one that was relatively easy for my fiancee to bake (he leaves this sort of thing to me, usually, but wanted to bake me a cake for my birthday). Thank God this cake is only for me because if I had needed a cake for someone else and made this I'd have been too embarrassed to take it anywhere. The layers aren't even a half inch thick.  I guess it would have been fine if I'd doubled the recipe, unfortunately I was rushing to find him a simple recipe and he wouldn't let me help. Too late now, the (pan)cakes are already baked and sitting on my cooling rack waiting to be frosted. We'll see how it tastes, but judging by the crispy edges I'm not expecting much.

I didn't read the reviews first. When I poured the batter into the 2 round pans it didn't half fill the pans. Like other reviewers have said the cake came out flat and is heavy tasting rather than moist and fluffy. If I'd read the reviews first I'd have doubled the recipe. I have skim milk in the house so I'm not sure if its the wrong kind of milk for the recipe. The cake tastes OK. I tried a chai buttercream recipe I found here with it and I halved that recipe and everything tastes fine. Its just a little weird having 1" layers on a cake. I might bake this cake again but I'll probably try other white cake recipes first.

The flavour of this cake was flat and floury. The texture was dense and crumbly. The layers barely rise and the recipe would have filled one pan. While some folks might like a dense texture, even a dense cake should have good flavour. Covered in a lot of icing it was passable--but I certainly wouldn't make it again.

I was caught in a bind when I used Betty Crocker cake mix for my twin's birthday.  The cake puffed in the middle and looked too flat in the aluminum pan (I didn't have a cake pan).  I had to find a recipe that was easy to add another layer onto the cake.  I substituted three eggs whites for 2 eggs to get a lighter cake.  The edges did brown a bit and the center caved in slightly but the cake was pretty flat.  I cut off the bulge from the first cake and placed this cake on top.  It made a perfect two layer cake.  I used vanilla pudding to spread between the layers.  I added double cream to a Betty Crocker frosting to make it less surgary... I also needed more frosting.  The cake came out surprisingly well!!  I didn't have a chance to taste it until everyone had gone and I didn't read the reviews until later.  I agree that this cake seemed a little heavy but I think the egg whites helped.. plus it's so easy and much tastier than the Betty Crocker white vanilla cake mix.  It saved me from running out to buy a cake for my twins' birthday.

VERY DRY CAKE!  I also don't think this recipe was meant for 9" cake pans as each layer was about half what it should have been.  It DEFINITELY had an interesting flavor, though, and would be well worth trying again with more milk as other reviewers recommended.  However, for what I was after, I'm gonna keep lookin.

I made this cake as a base for an English trifle,which it is perfect for. I ate so many squares of this with sliced strawberries whilst assembling the trifle I'm surprised I had enough left. It was beautifully moist. I intend to make it again soon. Many Thanks.

Easy, tasty with a good consistence. I confess, I used this recipe as a base with some modifications. I substituted one quarter cup of flour with one third cup finely chopped macadamia nuts. I thought it turned out great--subtle flavor and not too sweet.

this cake was a great cake to eat on it's own, but i added some filling and felt that it was too heavy for that particular recipe. Next time i'll try a lighter cake mix. But its a great recipe with jus enough flavour, will be baking it for simple occasions!

Delicious and simple.  I found the cake had just the right amount of flavour, yet it was still neutral.  I plan to make it for my daughter's first birthday party.

This was a great recipe... I'll definately use this again.
The only thing I'd do different is to use cake flour as opposed to all-purpose flour, to make the cake a bit less dense.
I would also suggest a sweet frosting, as this cake doesn't have a very strong flavor!
Overall, YUMMY!
