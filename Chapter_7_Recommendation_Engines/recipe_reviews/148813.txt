I made these potatoes for Father's Day for a party of 14 and everyone loved them!!!! The only difference is that I doubled the sauce ingredients and used a whole yellow onion instead of the red onion.  I used about 10-11 idaho potatoes and thinly sliced them, layered the potatoes and the sauce.  Delicious!!! I would make these again.... thanks for the recipe!!!

The was absolutely fabulous!  The potatoes had a great tanginess.  I used red skinned new potatoes and sliced them and used lots more garlic than called for.  This is a wonderful departure from regular potatoes.  I did not find the recipe to be a lot of trouble as referred to by a previous reviewer.  Certainly, any extra "trouble" this may be to prepare is very well worth the effort.

Fabulous dish!!!!!  I was a bit concerned when making this because the flour/butter roux mixture was VERY thick and then when I added the shredded cheese to it, it got even thicker.  Not to worry, because once it baked in the oven it turned out fabulous!!!!!!  It was creamy and luscious and the potato cheese flavors were just right!  My family loved it!!!  I made only one small change to this recipe.  I used diced hash browns (thawed) instead of going through the extra time and work of cooking potatoes.  I will be making this dish often!!!!!

They turned out really well...I threw in some sage and rosemary as well as used a whole lot more onion than called for-- love onion.  I tented the caserole because I was afraid it would dry out, there wasn't alot of liquid.  Don't do this...it took forever to cook and I didn't have big chunks of potato either.  After the hour of cooking I removed the tent and let it cook for a good half hour more and there were still some harder chuncks.  I will definitly make it again though, loved it.

Soooo good-buttermilk makes the difference! Occasionally I add a little Havarti cheese with dill and/or caraway cheese. Leftovers I turn into chunky potato soup. I make this often, thanks!

GREAT recipe!  I found this recipe while trying to use up some buttermilk.  I did not peel my potatoes as I used small new potatoes.  I just sliced and added to the pan.  The mixture of the buttermilk and Parmesan cheese is a nice combination.  Most certainly will be making them again.  I served this with 'Tangy Pork Tenderloin' from this site.  Thanks BELFLOREK for sharing your recipe.

Love, love, love them! I ended up using only 10 small potatoes & 1 1/3c of shredded parm because that's what I had on hand & needed to use up. I kept all other measurements as written. Just fabulous-love the subtle flavors!

I'm giving 5 stars even though mine didn't come out as they should.  My potatoes must have been too new because they would not soften for me no matter how much I baked them.  Despite crunchy and somewhat raw potatoes, I could tell if the potatoes had cooked right, they would have tasted amazing.  I will definately make again but this time boil my potatoes first get them 'a cookin'.

This recipe was what I was looking for. I do not like creamed soup recipes, this was perfect and simple, I admit I 'changed' it a bit -but only used thinly sliced potatoes, and layered..Delicious! Not too cheesy but with a creamy texture - everyone loved it!

I'm eating this as I type, and it turned out well. :-)  I used 1/2 a large onion and 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish to try to get a little zip without overpowering the parmesan.    This would be a good way to use up any leftover cheese, but what makes this so different and good is that it's NOT the standard cheddar.   Feta I think would be yummy.    And to those of you who are fretting over the buttermilk, just do what I did:  make your own!  1 tbsp cider vinegar (or lemon juice) to one cup of milk, and let it sit 5 minutes.  Voila.

Yum. The ultimate comfort food. I did add more salt but that's because I know when it comes to salt, you need to be heavy handed. I also used half asiago and half parm as that is what I had. Soooo yummy. Thanks!

Good recipe, but a little bland as written. I would recommend increasing cheese and/or adding herbs like dill or rosemary and more garlic. I will try again with these changes.

I don't know what to think about this recipe. It didn't have tons of flavor and my potatoes basically soaked up just about all of the liquid. However, they were filling, something different, and I liked the cubed texture. I ended up adding a little garlic salt at the end, to add a little more flavor, as my only change. On the other hand, they are very time-consuming. Cook time alone is 1 hour and 20 minutes. That is more cook time than I will typically spend on a holiday side dish. Also, 14 small potatoes is slightly misleading. That will result in different outcomes. I would have just listed the amount of cups of cubed potatoes with the approximate amount of potatoes needed. I baked this in a 13x9 pan lined with thick foil and sprayed with PAM. Made clean-up super easy. A little heavy and time-consuming, so not a repeat dish, but I used up a lot of leftover potatoes.

With a few modifications based on other reviews, this was a nice change from standard au gratin potatoes.  I increased garlic to 4 cloves, used 1 small onion sliced into rings, increased the buttermilk to 1-1/2 cups and added 1 Tbsp. dried Rosemary, crushed.  I  also topped with Italian style bread crumbs and drizzled a little olive oil over the top.

Very good.  I would have given it 5 stars but it needs more flavor. I am going to work on this one.  Maybe herbs or a nice cheese. Will have again.

I made this last night, it was taste but I did add extra garlic, cheese, and a bit of paprika. I also put bread crumbs on top.  Downfall is it took too long to cook, even after an hour and a half they were barely cooked. Son loved them.

These were ok.... They did not WOW me but were good. Not a whole lot more flavor than the canned soup recipes, and for the time and cost involved in fresh Parm and buttermilk I'd stick with a 79 cent can.

The sauce recipe was particularly good.  I used 3/4 cup buttermilk and 1.5 cup 2%milk.  Only 1/2 cup Parmesan.  I also added shrimp and frozen, chopped spinach.  We ate it as an alfredo sauce on spaghetti squash instead of baked with potatoes.  Delicious!  Be careful of the salt though, the cheese adds its own saltiness so you don't want to overdo it.

This is my favorite potato side dish. Recipe is easy to adjust.  Also works with powdered buttermilk and yellow or white onion. It’s not fussy. Invest in good Parmesan and grate it yourself. Yummy

I’m not sure if the buttermilk curdled while cooking (I followed exact directions), but this wasn’t great. I imagine some tweaks with cook time would fix that, but it was a fair amount of work, so not necessarily worth the effort.

This recipe is a great variation with the addition of the butter milk. It has quickly become a family favorite. I didn't stir after the first 1/2 hour. I just put it all together and covered with foil for the first half and uncovered for the second half. It came out great. Thank you for the recipe!

I had leftover potatoes and sausage from a crab boil, so I sliced the potatoes and fine diced the sausage.  Didn't have to add any seasoning, but made the cream sauce and added the cheese.  After the casserole was heated thoroughly I added a shredded Cheddar &  Monterey cheese blend over the top and put back in the oven to melt the topping.  This was a big hit!  Will make it again.

I loved these!!  I did have to add a little more milk to the flour mixture.  I also added a tiny bit more salt....  But I will definitely be making these again!!

This is a fine recipe, although a bit dry.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 but did still use a full cup of buttermilk.  It didn't make that big of a difference.  I ran out of parmesan, so I topped it with cheddar and bacon bits the last 20 minutes. That actually made it more flavorful, but as written it was pretty bland.

These turned out very good! I didn't have any buttermilk so I used cream instead. Also added more parm cheese.  I sliced red potatoes instead of cubed b/c I thought they'd cook quicker. Had wonderful creaminess.  Will make again!

These potatoes were a lot of work! However, they were quite tasty. After they were done I sprinkled fresh parsley on top as a garnish. They go very good with chicken or pork. I will definitely make this again.
