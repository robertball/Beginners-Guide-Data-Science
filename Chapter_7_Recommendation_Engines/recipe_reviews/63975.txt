This was good, but I prefer the recipe from my Betty Crocker cookbook over this.  As I remember, the only difference is using a can of evaporated milk (not the condensed) and 1/2 cup sugar.  I think I may have over-cooked this, because it turned pretty hard upon hitting my ice cream.  I would suggest only cooking it until it incorporates together fully.  Five minutes may be too long.

I wanted to drizzle fudge sauce on a cake that I was making and came across this recipe. It was very easy to make and came out great. Everyone commented that the fudge tasted good. I have extra left over and can't wait to try it warmed of course, over some ice cream.

Good!  Very thick and rich.  When it cools in the fridge over night, it is almost like pudding!  I kept sneaking spoonfulls of it cold.  Makes the best brownie sundaes ever.  Will definitely make again.

Not as good as cooking a sugar based sauce. Consistancy more like pudding. Using chocolate chips eliminates the use of premium chocolate. On the plus, it's very easy to prepare and quick and better than most brought. Wegman's is much better, but homemade cooked with sugar and really good unsweetened chocolate is best.

This is an excellent recipe. Works best in the microwave but keep an eye on it because it will easily boil over. Like any candy recipe it is very hot and because it is thick and sticks to you, don't come into contact with it when it is boiling. NOT FOR KIDS TO MAKE UNLESS WELL SUPERVISED.

NOTE: A little black walnut flavoring makes all the difference in the world if you want true hot-fudge flavor. Makes excellent gifts.

Yummy, and I even used the fat free Eagle Brand Sweetened condensed milk instead of the regular!  I did add a handful more of the chocolate chips since my husband thought it needed to be a little more chocolatety.  We won't buy store bought anymore now that we can make this right at home.

I tried this recipe last night. My husband who doesn't eat fudge sauces normally, tried it and loved it. the only thing I changed was the water. I used milk in place of it. The next time I'll decrease the vanilla by half and see how that does, since I thought it was to much vanilla taste.

This is a very simple recipie with very good results. I served it over pannacotta. I put what was left in the fridge and it was like pudding, as someone else mentioned!

I substituted milk chocolate chips for semi-sweet. Took this to PTO board meeting with white chocolate pound cake(recipe from The Cake Mix Doctor by Anne Bryn--A MUST HAVE) and fresh strawberries. Everyone loved it with many requests for the "chocolate sauce" recipe. Re-heats well in the microwave.

This is a really good recipe but a bit too semi-sweet for my families taste buds.  I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe and had great success.  I reduced the semi sweet chips buy 2 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of milk chocolate chips and instead of 2 tablespoons of water, I did 1 tablespoon water and 1 tablespoon milk.  My family went nuts over it. A word of advise, which ever recipe you use, lower the cooking temperature.  I actually burned my first batch.

Excellent hot fudge recipe!!!  I used the microwave directions and it turned out perfectly.  I added a tiny pinch of salt (that seems to be needed in most hot fudge recipes).  It was fast and delicious.

Excellent.  The texture was nice and gooey after it cooled with the ice cream.  We also dipped cream puffs in it.  Yum.

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmm!!!!  I had a need for some chocolate sauce for the vanilla ice cream that was calling my name!  I came across this, happened to have all the ingediants, and found Heaven on Earth!  This is the BEST!  (I forgot to add the water, so it is kind of thick).  We put it in the microwave a serving at a time just until heated and more saucey than pudding-y.  The family has declared...No More Store Bought Chocolate!

ThiS was very creamy but it didn't taste like hot fudge to me. The taste wasn't bad but it wasn't hot fudge either. I think using Ghiradelli's Double Chocolate Chips may help.

This is a wonderful recipe. The only thing I did differently was to heat on low for a little longer than 5 minutes using an electric stove. I then added about 2 tbl. peanut butter. Very smooth taste.

Quick and easy, smooth, rich and creamy, this is close to the real thing and hit the spot when we were craving a hot fudge sundae.

This is a solid, quick hot fudge recipe.  (Nothin' beats making a true hot fudge sauce though with light cream, good chocolate, and sugar, though.)  I thought it was too sweet as made, so I added a square of unsweetened chocolate.  And, as I usually do with chocolate recipes, subbed coffee for the water (probably added about 3 TBSP of coffee).  Made a huge difference in the chocolate-y flavor.  

As a side note I like dark, dark chocolate--80-90%.    And, to combat the temp issues many note, I used a double boiler to cook it.  (Made it easy to keep warm while waiting for brownies to finish, too!)

I made this for our ice cream social at work. Everyone loves it! I make it the night before and then put it in a crock pot so it stays warm. Yummy!!Sometimes I melt crushed almond joys in the fudge.

Very good, but the texture was not quite as smooth as I'd like it to be. Definitely go by instinct rather than strictly by time when cooking it. I drizzled it over Panna Cotta (another allrecipes.com recipe) and topped it all with fresh strawberries. Deliicious!

This was so easy to make.  I used Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet, but I think it would be 5 stars made as the recipe states and more "fudgy-tasting".  I will check more carefully next time to make sure I actually have the semi-sweet chips.  The texture is incredibly smooth and is nice and thick.  I will definitely make this again.
