The girls LOVED this for a treat after dinner tonight! Of course, I wasn't camping, so I just put everything on a plate and put it in the microwave for about a minute until everything was all melt-y and gooey. I also used mini chocolate chips b/c that's all I had on hand, which worked great. Perfect little treat that would satisfy any sweet tooth...a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I didn't like this. Warm banana like this got runny and made a perfectly fine banana taste rotten.

Banana boats are a great camping treat that is very fast and easy to make.
