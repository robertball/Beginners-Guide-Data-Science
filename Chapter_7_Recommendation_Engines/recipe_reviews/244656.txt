Delicious!  Warning though, google search the best way to peel acorn squash lol!  It was painful for me.

Absolutely delicious! I've made it twice now- once without the sugar and alcohol during a Whole 30 venture, so it wasn't truly sauce, but still delicious!  This time I made it full out (no nuts though) and it's spectacular. Definitely making it for Thanksgiving this year.

While there are things I don't quite understand about this recipe to make it close to as pictured. The flavor was really good. I used pecans instead of almonds in mine. It was a hit at Thanksgiving this year, and it is an incredibly fragrant dish so it made the whole house smell good.

This dish is a delicious side dish or appetizer! The squash, by itself, is delicious; the sauce brings it up to amazing!
