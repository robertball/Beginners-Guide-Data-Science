My husband and I have been making variations on this recipe whenever we need something quick and easy.  We use more olive oil, less butter, more artichokes and cook it longer until the artichokes brown lightly - more flavor.  Also we add what's on hand which could be mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes or left-over cooked chicken.  We like pine nuts sprinkled on top at the end. Surprisingly we've never added basil, but now I will try that.

It seems a little silly to review this recipe, since I changed so many things.  Still, the result was very good, so I'll just detail the changes.  

I used 8 ounces of pasta, 2 T. of olive oil, and left the butter out entirely.  3 cloves of garlic, dried basil instead of fresh, and a 12 ounce package of frozen artichoke hearts instead of the canned ones.  I added salt and pepper to taste, and at the last minute when I mixed everything together with the pasta, I added 4 ounces of cream cheese.  I served it with parmesan cheese, and it was REALLY good.  Do be sure to cook the artichokes until they're just starting to brown - the flavor is more intense that way.

This is a really good dish.  We used a whole box of pasta, 6 garlic cloves, a 14 oz. jar of artichokes, calamata olives and then topped it with parmesan cheese.  Great recipe!

Perfect in a pinch - this recipe was fast, delicious and the only ingredient you might not already have in the pantry is the artichoke hearts. A light but rich flavor.
Like other reviews, I too added more garlic than recommended and topped with parmesean, but I probably bleed garlic and olive oil so play with it to taste.

i used this recipe for the first time almost a year ago. it has become a regular dish for me since, but when making it last week i realized i never paid attention to the butter and oil amounts in the recipe. i've been using easily half that much of both, sometimes even less. this time, i decided to try it with the prescribed amounts. i couldn't believe how oily it turned out! terrible.

this is a wonderful recipe, please try it with less oil and butter. when i make it, i add chopped onion, some sliced baby bella mushrooms and fresh baby spinach. you really only need half to one tablespoon to sautee these. especially if you use the veggies, they have moisture in them so the mixture won't be dry. 

another note: when i make this i add a good amount of parmesan to the pasta at the end, and i mix crushed red pepper flakes into the artichoke mixture. it's wonderful. 

except for the oil/butter recommendations, this is a five star recipe!

I added green onions, a little fresh lemon juice, red pepper flakes and sundried tomatoes and this recipe was awesome -- so light and at the very end I added just a tablespoon or two of the pasta water to it to give it a little more of a saucy feel.  It was GREAT!

Absolutely the best!  Of course, I did add extra garlic, chopped sundried tomatoes, and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  We didn't find it oily, it's a typical, tomato sauce-free pasta dish!

i make a version of this by using a whole box of farfalle, two small jars of marinated artichoke hearts, black olives, white wine, fresh basil, 2 or 3 garlic cloves, half a sweet onion, lemon pepper, juice from 2 lemons and parmigano regiano cheese. saute the onion and garlic in olive oil then stir in the rest. add the fresh basil and cheese after you have mixed the sauce with the pasta. yum.

This was delicious and so simple.  I doubled the recipe using a 14 oz can of artichoke hearts.  The only other thing I changed was to season it with salt and pepper after combining the pasta and sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

I only used half of the amounts of olive oil and butter to cut back on the fat and still found it to be enough.  I also added sun-dried tomatoes for color and sprinkled with pecorino romano cheese.  Very tasty and quick--will definitely make again!

Simple ingredients, uncomplicated preparation and uncommonly delicious, particularly if you use good quality ingredients.  I used an excellent pappardelle pasta, and some chopped fresh parsley but forgot the basil, which I intended to add at at the last minute.  Didn't miss it.

This is simple, delicious, inexpensive, and amenable to what you have on  hand. Like many other reviewers, I made some modifications but came up with great results! My changes included the addition of pine nuts, white wine, a bit of lemon juice, and pepper. I also used artichokes marinated in oil, subbed whole wheat spaghetti, and skipped the extra olive oil and butter (since the artichokes I used already had oil). Yum!

This was great. I think I will add asparagus next time to make it even better. I did use less butter and more olive oil to make it healthier.

Excellent! We have made this numerous times now and my husband is always asking for it! Just had to change a few things for our tastes: We use half of the butter/oil and it is still more than enough, we use a little bit more pasta and a LOT more garlic! We love garlic though, so we really load it on. A great recipe to make after a day at work!

Great recipe. but needed salt. Maybe because my artichokes were organic(?) I added sundried tomatoes as well. Next time I will make it with chicken and add much more basil (I am growing fresh from potted seeds). I thought the garlic was perfect, but we LIKE garlic...

I thought this was very good. I added +- 1/2 cup of pasta water to the oil/butter mixture, cause the hubby likes lots of sauce. I also sauteed 1 pound of shrimp and placed on top. Also added shredded parm to finish. Pretty easy and satisfied my pasta craving.

Really good recipe.  Yes, I tweaked it a little bit like other users, less butter and oil (1/2 less), more artichokes and garlic.  It was really good.  My kids thought it was spicy?!  Go figure (garlic, I suppose)  Thanks for an easy, good recipe.

Pretty good! It's a keeper. We added some sun-dried tomatoes and some kalamata olives. I'd also add some extra basil.

This was quite good.  I used probably half the oil and butter, and it turned out just fine.  I also used the marinated artichoke hearts, for a little added flavor.  Next time I'll use more garlic, but we LOVE garlic.  I also added some chicken breast pieces that I sauted in the olive oil, garlic, butter and basil.  I topped with parmesan cheese before serving.  Even my picky eater ate it all...including the artichokes!  Very good recipe

Very easy.  Next time I think I'll use more than 1 sprig of Basil and for some reason the marinated artichoke hearts had some tough to chew parts to it but all and all this was very good.

i added some mushrooms, used a little more garlic and also used whole wheat pasta and "fake" butter...turned out great and much lower fat and carbs.

Very tasty!! I made a few changes. Omitted the butter and used extra olive oil, garlic, basil, diced tomatoes and a dash of rosemary. Also used couscous instead of pasta. Could be eaten on its own or add some chicken. Will make again.

I made this one night for a quick dinner and it was great. I did add salt and pepper, red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and more garlic.  I used with large shell pasta which was just my preference.  The basil really brings out the artichoke flavor.  Will make this again.

VERY VERY YUMMY!!  My 2 & 5 year old children ate it right up but my husband and I felt it was a little too oily.  This will not keep me from making this dish again and agin.  I will reduce the amount of olive oil next time and I will also add more garlic.  I also added parm cheese.  I served it with Italian Style Orange Roughy from this site and we all pushed back from the dinner table very happy and very full.

This is easily 5 stars as side dishes go.  I made this as a side to turkey burgers.   I quadrupled the garlic and cut the EVOO/butter in half and increased the pasta to a pound.  I added kalamata's and crushed red peppers.  FABULOUS!  Will definitely make again!

I only gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons--I thought it needed a little more olive oil and more artichokes. I used probably 4 1/2TB of olive oil and a 14oz can of artichoke hearts. I also added a little garlic salt and some salt and pepper. Topped it off with some parmesan cheese and it was wonderful. I'd definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time this week. I made small adjustments...added extra garlic, used less butter and more oil, threw in red pepper flakes. It came out delicious! Next time I will use an extra can of artichoke hearts, a little more garlic and a little less oil. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

I thought this was excellent. The artichoks from a can are still tasty as long as you heat them for a bit with the other ingredients! I added more garlic than called for. After I had already cooked the sauce, I separated the artichoke leaves - I think next time I'll do that while it's cooking, to spread out the flavor even more and make it easier to eat. Very good recipe! Two of my housemates tried noodles and really liked them.

I found out that canned artichokes aren't very tastey...other than that salty tasting vegetable, the sauce was pretty good. I added more garlic too.  I probably will make this again, without the artichokes.

I made this with wheat penne because that is what I had on hand.  I added zucchini and onion as well.  I didn’t have fresh basil so I used dried.  I would have added more garlic cloves if I had them because I love garlic.  I added garlic powder with parsley after everything was in tossed together.  I also reserved some pasta water and used that to keep it from drying out but now I wished I’d reserved the artichoke liquid!  I also added Parmesan cheese to melt and on top when serving as well as healthy amounts of salt.  I will make again and probably use spinach and mushrooms too! Good starter recipe!

Loved it, easy peasy, have made it twice now. The second time I added more garlic (I like garlic).  Must have fresh grated parmesan cheese on top.  DELISH.  Also, I used bow-tie pasta the second time as I found the small uncooked seashell pasta much too small.

This was a great, simple pasta recipe! Instead of using artichokes, I used sliced mushrooms and diced onions, as well as baby spinach. I also added a fair amount of parmesan cheese at the end, and used dried basil instead of fresh. I also only used olive oil (no butter), but not sure how much as I just threw in what looked good. Overall, I would definitely make this revised recipe again!

My son is on an anti-inflammatory diet and can't have tomato sauces so I was so happy to find a pasta dish with healthy olive oil instead of red sauce. This was so delicious as a base recipe. I tweaked it and threw in chicken and onions and mushrooms and someone suggested spinach and or asparagus so I might try that next time. It was a big hit at dinner. Will make again!

I really enjoyed this.  The only thing I will do next time is cut back on the butter and oil, it was a bit too much for my taste.  I will also see if I can't find reduced sodium artichoke hearts, they were a bit salty from the can.

this was pretty good...i had to use dried basil bc i didn't have any fresh...had a little mishap with that as the basil spilled in my sauce mixture so the sauce had more basil than was really needed...despite this it still tasted pretty good...i did add mushrooms simply bc we love them!

I threw in a tomato just for the heck of it. It was quite tasty.

A bit oily if you are oil-conscience, but still very tasty.  Could use more artichokes.

Bland and not very impressive. :( But then again, I like a lot of flavor. If you don't mind blandness, then this could be ok for you.

This dish tasted excellent.  I think the proportions of sauce to pasta may be slightly off, but I plan on making it again and my husband really loved it too.

I made this last night & my husband & I both really enjoyed it.  4 oz didn't seem like enough to serve 2 people so I doubled the recipe & it was the perfect amount. I also added chicken & sprinkled some fresh parmesan over the top before serving.  It turned out really good!
