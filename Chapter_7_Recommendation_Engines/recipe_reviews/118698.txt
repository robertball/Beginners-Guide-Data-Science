Different and flavorful.  I baked at 350 for about 25 min. instead of broiled.

The low calorie count is what originally drew me to this recipe.  I found the slight "tang" of the balsamic vinegar a pleasant surprise!  This was my first time using BV.  If you're looking for the typical "heavy" stuffed 'shrooms, this recipe is definitely NOT for you... for a light, tasty appetizer though, I loved it.  I actually made only two servings, and the second serving was almost as tasty even reheated in the microwave.

These were very good. I think that the flavour of the basalmic vinegar was a little on the strong side, even at just 2 tsp!  I will add more hot sauce next time and only use 3 "scant" Tbsp of sour creme and perhaps heaping Tbsp of the mayo to make up for it.  I love sour creme but find that it often makes the dish almost too light and takes away from the body. I was going to sprinkle a bit of cheese over the top - but forgot.  Made them the night before, covered with foil, took the foil off to pop in the oven next day. Like I said - I forgot to add the extra spinkle of cheese when I ran them under the broiler, which, again my mistake, I should have left them there just a tad longer, but the shrimp were ready! An Excellant recipe which will definetly be made again.

We just didn't care for these.  While I loved the idea of a low fat stuffed mushroom the balsamic vinegar taste overpowered everything.  My husband who loves mushrooms didn't even eat his.  I considered taking the Balsamic out, but then worry they would have no flavor.

I made this recipe for a family dinner one night and everyone loved it - although they could only eat a few at a time because of the rich flavour. I did edit some, though. I left out the chives and cut the vinegar in half because I dont care for the taste. A great, healthy alternative to restaurant options.

I didn't have chives or hot sauce, but I rolled them in olive oil, salt and pepper, and added minced garlic to the stuffing mixture. I put them in a muffin tin and sprinkled mozzarella on top before broiling. Very easy to make before hand and pop in the oven for 5-10 min.

This was VERY good!  I added crab, Italian seasoning, salt & pepper, garlic, and additional Parmesan cheese on top.  The whole family love this!

These were just okay.  They were missing something.  This time, I did add crab to the mixture like another reviewer suggested and put a small piece of bacon on the top of each one.  That did make them better.  I would also definitely add minced garlic next time (about 2-3 tsp) and maybe a few other fresh herbs (maybe some fresh basil and oregano).  That may give the mushrooms the extra boost they needed.

I just used this as a starting for my mushrooms. I used the cheese, sour cream, etc but didn't add the mayo. It was good! My husband really liked it.

OMG Excellent. I only had one portabella mushroom. I didn't have all the ingredients but I did have bread crumbs, onion, mayo. sour creme, and Parmesan cheese plus a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Next time I will use some CRAB in my filling.

I gave this recipe 5 stars just because of how fast and simple it is to prepare. I didn't broil them either. I put them in 400 degrees temp. for about 20 mins.

Wow, these are so good.  Honestly, the list of ingredients seems a little strange, but the reviews were all so positive that I decided to try them.  Glad I did! I modified very little.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and a few grinds of fresh pepper.  That's it. I did add the hot sauce and the final product was not spicy at all.  Mushrooms can be pretty bland after all, so the sauce helps.  The vinegar taste is certainly noticeable and really makes the recipe in my opinion.  It also makes it so you don't need salt. I had just the right amount of stuffing for the mushrooms.  I baked them at 400 for about 20 mins (I wanted the mushrooms to be pretty soft) and then broiled a little to get the filling browned.  Perfection!

Might not want to use the balsamic vinegar. Also didn't use chives. They tasted fantastic! A great twist on a beloved dish.

There isn't anything exactly WRONG with this recipe. My boyfriend found and prepared the recipe pretty much precisely as written (he used low-fat sour cream instead of fat free and our mushrooms were baby bellas since the recipe doesn't say a specific type). The stuffing was just sort of blah. It just tasted like seasoned bread crumbs! The lack of garlic really surprised me. We initially broiled them, but after tasting discovered that the mushrooms were barely heated through, so we stuck them back in the oven to bake. I love stuffed mushrooms, so maybe I'm just being too picky, but the stuffing just didn't do it for me at all! It would be nice to see a veggie (I don't really count 2 T of chives as a veggie) or two in the mix just to add a little texture! I think that without additions and substitutions it's just really bland...

This was so yummy! The balsamic vinegar really is what does it! I doubled the recipe and used it with portabella mushrooms and grilled them for about 6-8 minutes. Fantastic!

I made this somewhat by recipe. Fresh mushrooms, Club cracker bread crumbs, fresh garlic, fresh onions, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion salt, pepper and butter. My husband loved them.

These are some mighty tasty stuffed 'shrooms! I bought a bunch of very large white mushrooms yesterday, with the intention of making stuffed mushrooms. This recipe is similar to what I usually stuff my 'shrooms with, but I've never added mayo/sour cream/hot sauce to the mix. I followed this recipe with the exception of substituting 2% fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream (as I usually do), and adding a diced green onion for a bit of color and flavor. I broiled them for 5 minutes, then turned them over and brushed a little olive oil on the bottoms, and broiled them for a couple minutes more to brown the bottoms a bit. Topped with chives, they were gorgeous and we ate every last bite!

I made these because they sounded easy and flavorful, not because I was looking for something low cal. The filling was very easy to put together and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. I used all the stems and 6 TBL. of shredded Parmesan for the cheese. My bread crumbs were unseasoned so I added some garlic powder. The balsamic vinegar was quite noticeable, but nobody complained. Next time I might try white wine instead of balsamic vinegar for the liquid. Will definitely make these again!

I find mushrooms can be under cooked or soggy, so I broiled the caps upside down for 5 minutes, then stuffed them.  I broiled them the second time after filling. They were a hit! I substituted sour cream for non dairy Tofu Sour Supreme. Perfect! Loved the balsamic vinegar especially!
