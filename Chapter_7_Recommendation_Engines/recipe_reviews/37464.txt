my family (including me) loved this cake!  i added some pineapple tidbits while mixing the cake batter and used real whipping cream.  the only other thing i would change next time would be to add either some orange zest or orange flavoring for extra flavor.
But, we loved it the first time!  I will definitely make this one again.

This cake is excellent!  I've made it the last two years for Easter and always receive rave reviews with evidence of an empty plate!  Very moist and easy to make.

Yummy. The sugar/milk mixture tastes like sweetened condensed milk. Easy to prepare. I didn't wait the 6 hrs to serve. I served after 30 mins and it still was great. The kids loved it too.

Delicious! My husband really raved about this one! However, next time I make this, I think I'll add another coconut layer in the middle since it was so delicious!
