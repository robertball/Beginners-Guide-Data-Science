This is a wonderful salad with a pleasing combination of orange and fennel.  I used a ready to use herb salad mix, and it was warmly received at a dinner for eight.

Absolutely delicious! I used fresh fennel from my CSA as well as a dark, leafy lettuce. I love the combo of the fennel and orange. For the dressing, I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used a little regular yellow mustard and used apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar.

The orange vinaigrette for this recipe was "out-of-this-world" delicious. I had no lemons, so I used lime juice and about a tablespoon of cranberry juice for color, along with the orange juice and vinegar specified. This is such a refreshing and unusual salad. Perfect for summertime barbecues or for winter holidays - when oranges are at their peak of perfection. Yum.

I made this using my own red leaf lettuce from my garden.  I loved the dressing and the pairing of the fennel and orange.  What I could do without was the kalamta olives.  I love them, no doubt, but they had no place in this light, crisp salad.  I would leave them out in the future!!

Added feta cheese squares. And used Trader Joe's Orange Champagne Vinegar as the salad dressing starter. Tasted lovely. Will definitely make this again.

Thank you so much! My husband and I both gobbled this up. I sprinkled some pepitos on top for extra crunch. Next time I will make this with an arugula salad blend and add more Kalamata olives. This is a gorgeous blend of sweet, sour, and salty flavors and crunchy and soft textures. So fun to eat!

I didnâ€™t   use olives because of guests preferences.  Sprinkled with dried cranberries and thin slices red onion.  Made again for dinner guests and will make again.  Very good

Delicious, I didn't have rice vinegar but used white balsamic and eliminated the sugar, good even leftover (without dressing of course).  Oh, by-the-way,  any kind of toasted nuts would be great on this salad.
