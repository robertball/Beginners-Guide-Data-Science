This is delicious as a brownie. I made it with 30 crushed Ritz crackers instead of only 20 crackers. I baked it in a rectangle baking dish. Cut into squares.

11.16.19  I’ve never had cracker pie before or even heard of it, my curiosity got the best of me, and I had to try it.  Not sure quite what to say about it or even how to say it, but I’ll try to give you the bad and the good IMO.  It certainly is non-traditional for a pie, and you can’t even serve it like a pie because it crumbles and falls apart (maybe a more descriptive name would be Cracker Crumble I?) .  After it came out of the oven, the top was all cracked, and when I tried to cut a slice, it just broke apart.  So that’s the bad.  And now the good.  It is crazy easy to make, and actually tastes pretty decent.  Filling leans toward the texture you’d have in a pecan pie, just firmer and drier.  There a pleasant sweetness from the dates and a little crunch from the walnuts.  We ate it in a bowl with a  dollop of whipped cream, not as a slice of pie on a plate.  We all eat with our eyes even before the first bite, and this has very poor eye appeal.  And that’s the bad, at least for me.  It actually tastes OK, that’s the good, but it’s not good enough for me to make again.  Could be this is the way cracker pie should look, I don’t know, so I don’t want to discourage others from trying it, but it just didn’t work for me.
