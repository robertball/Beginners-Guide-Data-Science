Thanksgiving2018 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262024/honey-baked-spiral-ham-in-the-slow-cooker/ ... Halved the recipe & halved the honey: 1/2c brown, 1/4c honey, 2T mustard,1/ 1/2t cinnamon,1/4t nutmeg. Studded ham with whole cloves. Baked too high, not long enough to crisp, if it was gong to. Low & longer if I make again. Tried before using full amount of honey & too honeyish.
