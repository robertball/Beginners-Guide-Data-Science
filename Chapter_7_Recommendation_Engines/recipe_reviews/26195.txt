Excellent! My kids, my husband and I, and my in-laws all LOVED this bar!  I simplified it by mixing the chips in the batter, then baked it at 350 for 18 minutes. I totally skipped the frosting and no one missed it. My mother-in-law made sure she had this recipe when they left!  I made this twice in one weekend - this is definitely a keeper!

These were just like the bars I had in elementary school growing up! My dough did not spread to fill out the whole pan, but it didn't matter. I broke up chocolate bars instead of using chips. I did half with milk chocolate, and the other half with semi-sweet. Everyone had their favorite! I had to eat 4 bars before deciding I didn't have a favorite! Everyone asked me for the recipe. Peanut butter bars are not known here in England (or they just aren't popular), but they were a big hit with all my UK friends- even with the people who don't like peanut butter!

made these for the church luncheon.  they were ok, but thin.  I would put them in a smaller pan to make them thicker and cut them into smaller squares.

I made a couple of small changes, but regardless this is a great recipe from what I tasted. I cut the recipes in half using the recipe calculator. I added the chips into the batter, but I used some cinnamon chips that I had leftover. I didn't add the icing because I just ran out of powdered sugar making cupcakes a few days ago. These bars are crumbly, so be warned about that, but the taste is amazingly delicious!

Thanks so much for posting this recipe! My daycare used to give us these, and I found a recipe for it a few years ago, but it got lost (along with a whole lot of other recipes). Just lately I've been REALLY wanting these. 
I've never heard of these with the chocolate on top, but it is just as good!! Thanks so much!

I put them in a 9x13. They taste like oatmeal cake with a little peanut butter flavor. They are good, but not what I was hoping for. If I make them again I will cut the oatmeal by 1/4-1/2 cup.

A new family favorite.  Followed the recipe and had no problems at all.  I love the addition of the oats, and my kids loved the peanut butter frosting!

These are good. Nothing to rave about. Good with a glass of milk. May or may not make them again but glad I tried them.

These were not anything special in my opinion, the bottom was very dry and the top didn't quite make up for it. If I was going to make them over, I would have put the chocolate chips in the dough.

Wasnâ€™t as popular at the Pot luck as I thought it would be. Made it exactly by the recipe.

Very good. I used natural peanut butter so I added more salt to the bar cookie layer and the frosting, and a little vanilla to the frosting too. As another reviewer said, bake at 350 18 min   And I ended up drizzling on the frosting but they look great.

Yummy bars and easy to make. The bottom was a little dry but the melted chocolate and the peanut butter glaze made up for it.
