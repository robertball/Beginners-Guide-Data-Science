I didn't have any of the problems the other reviewers had with this recipe.  I did add a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/4 cup less butter.  I also used granola with raisins in it already so I added an additional 3/4 of that instead of raisins alone.  My boyfriend suggested chocolate chips next time.  I will make these again.  Yum!

I really enjoyed these cookies after following other reviewer's advice.  I added an extra 1/2 c flour per recommendation. My granola had raisins already included, so I added and extra 1/2 c of granola (Those who really like granola, may want to add a full cup, but reducing the amount of granola, suited my tastes..still gave them a nice crisp crunch w/o being overly granola-y).  I substituted 1 cup chocolate chips for peanuts.

This recipe was a wonderful way to use up some granola cereal that the kids didn't like. I doubled the recipe then threw in  a bit of leftover mashed banana because I didn't have any peanuts. Awesome!

The absolute best!  I also added 1/2 cup flour to this recipe plus 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp allspice & 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  The granola I used had raisins and slivered almonds.  I still added the 1 cup of raisins but I did not add the peanuts.  I will be making these again for sure!

These were easy to make. I loved the idea of using leftover granola. My husband raves about them. Can make variations with this recipe thanks

The flavor was good, but I am not sure there was enough flour or something.  They spread out paper thin all over the pan and got dark very quickly.  My kids tried to eat them anyway, but I won't be making them again.

I'm not really sure the best way to rate this as far as stars. What I made turned out AMAZING. Perfectly round cookies - delicious texture and flavor...
That said, however, I made a few changes thanks to other reviewers' suggestions.
I used 1 cup white all purpose flour and 1 cup wholemeal. I also replaced the peanuts with chocolate chips.
I would definitely make this recipe again with those changes.

The cookies were good and the kids loved them, but they were too flat and stuck to the cookie sheet. (Partly, it may have been caused by high-altitude) I am going to play around with the recipe until I get it right, subtracting butter and/or adding flour and baking soda, because I have a lot of left-over granola that even I didn't like. :)

These cookies taste good but they look terrible. I think there is too much butter and not enough flour. They are so thin it is hard to get them off of the cookie sheet. I probably won't use this recipe again.

Will definitely make again. These were great tasting and so easy to make. The kids loved them and the youngest even talk them to school. They stayed lovely and fresh in our biscuit barrell the few days it took to eat them. The only thing I didn't add were extra roasted peanuts as the granola I had at home had mixed roasted nuts.

These cookies were great.  I did add 1/2 cup extra flour to keep the cookies from getting too flat.  My granola had blueberries in it, so I didn't add raisins, just more dried blueberries and craisins.  YUM!  These are so good!  A good recipe to build on and get creative with!

They are awesome! I even baked them then froze them and they are so good straight from the freezer. They taste like toffee. Excellent recipe! I crushed up an extra 1/2-1 cup of my granola and that made the 2nd batch even better. My granola had raisens too but I still added more.  No peanuts though.  I wanted them more like an oatmeal cookie with more crunch. 2nd batch even better then first.

I wasn't expecting much based on some of the reviews, but these turned out awesome for me! I cut the recipe above in half (just making a small batch). I added extra flour until the dough seemed the right consistency. I also used a whole egg instead of a half. Baked for 12 minutes and they were perfect. Puffed up nicely and got golden, not flat or greasy. Really, really yummy. We'll see if they stay chewy. If they do, this will be my go-to recipe for raisin cookies.

(Note: I used the pumpkin flax-seed granola from Costco in them, as well as golden raisins. Perfect!)
