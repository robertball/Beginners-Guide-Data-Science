Not creamy at all.  I've been in search of a great vanilla fudge -- like from the Jersey Shore.  This is NOT it.  It tastes like hardened confectioner's sugar.

The fudge was great, I have made two batches of it now, I used heavy cream instead of milk, made it extra creamy, also added chopped walnuts.

This recipe is always very soft, and will not harden.  But it tastes alot better if you add more butter and vanilla than the recipe calls for.

Sure it is easy but it was so runny that my husband and I added in 7 ounces of marshmallow fluff and then it turned out good.

I try not to give bad reviews, but this recipe wasn't great.  I made it last night and it did taste mostly like hardened confectioner's sugar.  Today, after sitting, it's a little better.  So maybe it will be even better tomorrow, but I won't make it again.  Mine did harden okay though, no problem there like in some other reviews.

The consistency was just fine. Take your time, cook slowly on low heat, and use real butter. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if it looks thin you add a little more sugar too thick- add more cream/ milk. It does, however, need more flavor, and the color is bright-white, not like the picture. This is a great versatile base that allows you to add different flavors (peanut butter, coconut, brown sugar. maple, peppermint...).  You can go wild with your own creativity.

this fudge was tasty and creamy but more like a frosting than a fudge. i tried the recipe with 3oz of dark chocolate added in which made it set much better and it turned out more like a fudge.

I've never made any kind of fudge before, I don't think, and I've hardly ever even tasted vanilla fudge either, so I may not be a good judge of this recipe. It was pretty quick and easy, and tasted okay to me. The vanilla flavor was fairly noticeable, and this was on the sweet side. I was a little surprised that the fudge had a slightly grainy texture to it (I guess the sugar transformed somehow). In little portions, it lasted me for over ten days. I probably won't make this again (I think I much prefer chocolate or even peanut butter fudge), but I can at least say this is worth a try.

It was amazing! I herd some veiws that it's best to put it in the freezer, but I didn't understand that... I put it in the fridge and it was perfect! I added a pinch more vanilla. My family and I love it.

This was delicious! I read the other reviews which said that "no matter what they did they could never get it to harden". For anyone else making this recipe, what I did was put the fudge in the freezer! It hardened all the way! Yum!

This recipe is very poor.  I have tried it twice now to make sure it wasn't something I did!  It wasn't.  I am sorry I wasted ingredients a second time.  It didn't set, it was a mess to clean up, not at all what I know as vanilla fudge.

This would have to be the worst fudge that I have ever tasted. I read some mixed reveiws on hear, but decided to take a chance any way. It is not fudge it is not at all creamy hardened confectioners sugar. DO NOT TRY TO MAKE THIS RECIPE! you will just be disapointed.

This really is NOT awful.  It is very sweet, but as stated fudge is sweet.  I think the word creamy;  however, does not apply.  Reminds me of a vanilla fudge Russell Stover used to make....but not like the Jersey shore.  It is a very easy fix for a sweet tooth craving...just not something you would serve to friends.

This tastes like cheap icing. If you don't cook it long enough, it's runny, if you cook it too long, it flakes and hardens. But it really does taste just like hardened confectioner's sugar.

I just made this...it turned out great and was quite tasty with a creamy texture. I added some brown sugar and about 1/2 tsp of molasses to give it a richer flavour. I would not hesitate to offer this to guests.

It definitely wasn't a proper fudge but whatever it was, we loved it! It was very easy, but if you're looking for a proper fudge then use some other recipe but if you want to, like me, just make a delicious dessert then this is perfect!

This is wonderful. Although the directions do not say it, I cooked the recipe until it reached soft ball stage on a candy thermometer. It was fabulous. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. It came out tasting like a cinnamon bun icing. My kids loved it.

We tried this recipe at our family holiday baking day and loved it.  As a matter of fact, we are all already out of it and I have to make another batch.  It is sweet, but isn't all fudge?  It is super easy to make! I would recommend bringing back to room temperature after refrigerating before cutting it.

if you need a quick fudge fix, this is it!  while it reminds me somewhat of cake frosting set at fudge, my son and I really enjoyed it.

This is the worst fudge recipe I have ever used. It as soon as I take it out of the refrigerator it starts to melt. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. Its grainy not creamy...its horrible.

this recipe was easy, but the taste was very sugary.  It wasn't very creamy, but if other ingredients were added, the powdered sugar flavor could be masked.

I used 3tbsp sweetened condensed milk, a splash of almond milk (it was getting a bit thick), and matcha powder. Gonna sprinkle crushed cashews atop.

This fudge turned out well, I followed the recipe except use a small amount of the mixture in a separate bowl and added 1 1/2 Tablespoon of peanut butter to it and that too was very tasty.
Thanks I will be using this recipe again.

I was hopeful. I really wanted to like it, but it's just too sweet. It needs something to dilute the taste of sugar.

Husband enjoyed it very much and others have called it good and not bad.  very soft though, I highly recommend NOT using wax paper to make layers in a dish, you'll either eat paper or end up throwing it away.  Super easy to make though!

It's not even worth a star at all.  I made this "fudge" exactly how the recipe reads and I may as well have opened up a can of sweetened condensed cream and spread it out into a pan because that's what it tasted like.  It was left in refrigerator 24 hours to harden but never did.  Maybe ingredients were omitted from the recipe, I don't know but I do know, I will never make this again.

YummmO   I made this Vanilla Fudge  tonight.  I was looking for something sweet to make, and not having alot of ingredients on hand at 5:00 AM, I looked up Vanilla Fudge because I thought I had enough ingredients for a simple, quick vanilla fudge.  I made this one and it was easy, firmed up nicely .. and it tastes yummy. I put in the freezer for a little while and then in the fridge.  I did add extra vanilla, but that is all extra. One thing I should say is that I used skim milk and it did not alter the recipe at all, although I do know whole milk or cream would have made it even better and creamier.  I am just as happy with it like it is.  I love it and would make it again.  Thank you.

Did not harden. Tastes like butter and sugar. I never made fudge that didn't harden until now. You always bring to a boil and boil until it hardens when you drop some in a cold glass of water. I knew this but followed the recipe anyway and viola mushy fudge.

I think the problem people are having with the consistency has nothing to do with the recipe, but more to do with how long thei they're cooking it. The sugar needs tie to break down. I cooked mine on medium heat, stirring constantly until I saw steam. Then I turned it down to low and stirred it until the consistency seemed to be more runny than creamy.  I walked away for a second to put a dish in the sink, when I came back, the top had slightly crusted. I to that as a cue it was ready. 

I poured the majority into a small pyrex pan, and used a red gel did coloring with the rest. I drizzled that over top, and used a skewer to swirl it a little and give it character. I piped it in the freezer and within an hour it had set! Definitely mite of a fudge consistency than I expected from the reviews.

All in all, it is pretty sweet, but if that's what you're looking for, this is great!

***note: I used REAL pure vanilla, not extract**

I was not sure how long to cook this recipe? I cooked it all together and poured it in my pan, I am not sure if it is going to set up. It was all creamed together when I poured it but not very thick. I am really hoping it sets up. Can someone tell me how long to cook the mixture? Also should it come to a boil? Thanks

I liked this fudge because it's an easy and simple way to quickly satisfy a sweet tooth.  I only made a small amount of the recipe as a treat for myself so just made individual candies in mini cupcake papers.  Also added peanut butter for extra flavor and a dollop of chocolate syrup on top before I popped the fudge in my mouth!

This product didn't turn out quite as I had hoped, too soft, however I popped it in the freezer after cutting into squares, whatever size suits you, while I melted some semi sweet chocolate chips and when it was frozen really hard I dipped each piece into the melted chocolate and placed each piece on a parchment paper covered cookie sheet. The fudge needs to be kept as frozen as possible prior to the chocolate covering it, or it's too soft to coat, but once hardened they are more like a vanilla soft centered chocolates...  Pretty tasty :0)
